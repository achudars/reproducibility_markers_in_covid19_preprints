Abstract
Changes in CO2 emissions during the COVID-19 pandemic have been estimated from
indicators on activities like transportation and electricity generation. Here, we instead use
satellite observations together with bottom-up information to track the daily dynamics of
CO2 emissions during the pandemic. Unlike activity data, our observation-based analysis can
be independently evaluated and can provide more detailed insights into spatially-explicit
changes. Specifically, we use TROPOMI observations of NO2 to deduce ten-day moving
averages of NOx and CO2 emissions over China, differentiating emissions by sector and
province. Between January and April 2020, China’s CO2 emissions fell by 11.5% compared
to the same period in 2019, but emissions have since rebounded to pre-pandemic levels owing
to the fast economic recovery in provinces where industrial activity is concentrated.

Main Text
In the first half of 2020, most countries in the world have imposed stringent policies to
slow down the spread of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), closing businesses and factories,
restricting travel, and issuing stay-at-home orders. Such lockdown measures have helped to curb
the spread of the virus (1) and meanwhile caused large reductions in global demand for fossil fuels
(2). In turn, levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and other air pollutants have also fallen across the
globe (3-5), and global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions declined by an estimated 8.6%, based on
indicators of energy use between January and April of 2020 as compared to the same period in
2019 (6). If history is a guide, though, such reductions in air pollution and CO2 emissions could
be temporary: global CO2 emissions have rebounded and resumed their former rates of growth
after every financial crisis in the fossil fuel era (7, 8). Indeed, economic activities are already
increasing in many places, and governments and central banks have already passed or proposed
large economic stimulus packages to spur recovery (9) without any climate mitigation co-objective.
Yet the COVID-19 pandemic has come at an important moment in the centuries-long timeline of
fossil energy use, and for that reason as well as the pandemic’s outsized disturbance to social and
economic systems (10), it may mark a turning point in the world’s energy and economic
structure—one with lasting influence on the trajectory of global CO2 emissions.
However, annual, country-level inventories of CO2 emissions (11) are plainly insufficient
to monitor variations in the sources and dynamics of CO2 emissions during fast-evolving periods
like the COVID-19 pandemic. Nor can such annual estimates support adaptive and agile climate
and energy policies going forward, as countries and other jurisdictions seek to finetune such
policies to achieve environmental goals in a rapidly evolving technological and economic context.
Increasing the frequency and resolution of data on CO2 emissions is thus a research priority.
Unfortunately, the data streams required to conduct continuous carbon monitoring with the high
temporal and spatial resolution are yet very limited. Bottom-up approaches to estimate daily CO2
emissions at the country level using activity data and energy use indicators have recently emerged
(6, 12, 13), but gaining access to reliable daily statistics of sector-specific fossil fuel consumption
is a challenge, and activity proxies such as traffic congestion indices and heating degree days must
be used in those recent studies to empirically analyze the relative changes of emissions. Moreover,
such bottom-up estimates lack independent validation.

3

Near real-time observations from ground- and space-based platforms thus represent an
attractive means of supplementing and validating bottom-up estimates with direct measurements
(14-18). However, CO2 concentrations are sparsely sampled in time and space, even for the carbon
satellites (14, 15), and natural variability in ecosystem carbon fluxes and atmospheric transport
prevents unambiguous detection of fossil fuel CO2 emissions over time scales of weeks to months.
Moreover, the current generation of carbon monitoring satellites often returns significant errors in
single soundings data (14, 15). Satellite observations of NO2, a species co-emitted with CO2 during
the combustion of fuels, have broader coverage than CO2 observations, especially from the
recently launched TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) onboard the Copernicus
Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite (19). Due to the relatively short lifetime in NOx, the satellite is
capable of detecting the short-term variability in NO2 columns (3, 5). Satellite NO2 columns have
been widely used to retrieve the spatial patterns or temporal trends of NOx emissions (e.g., 20-23).
There are also attempts to infer CO2 emissions from satellite-based NO2 observations (24-26),
however, such a method requires good knowledge of CO2 to NOx emission ratios that are regiondependent, sector-specific, and dynamically changing (27).
Here, we develop a novel approach to infer a ten-day moving average of anthropogenic
CO2 emissions from TROPOMI NO2 merged with bottom-up information. Details of our data
sources and methods are provided in the Supplementary Materials. In summary, we first develop
a preliminary bottom-up estimate of sectoral NOx and CO2 emissions in 2020 based on the Multiresolution Emission Inventory for China (MEIC) in 2019 (28) and near-real-time statistics and
proxies in 2020. Based on the high-quality NO2 column observations from TROPOMI, we then
separate the meteorological effects and model the local sensitivity of NO2 column to surface NOx
emission changes (29) with the nested-grid GEOS-Chem chemical transport model (30), to assess
NOx emission changes in 2020 compared to those in 2019. Next, we use the top-down estimates
to correct the sectoral distribution in the preliminary bottom-up emissions, based on the emission
differences revealed by the grid cells dominated by a single source sector. Finally, the TROPOMIconstrained NOx emissions and the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of emission sectoral information
are combined with the spatially-explicit, sector-specific ratio maps of CO2 to NOx emissions to
infer ten-day moving average CO2 emissions from specific sectors. We use this integrated satellitebased emissions monitoring approach to track NOx and CO2 emissions in mainland China over the
period from January to April 2020 as the coronavirus lockdown was imposed and relaxed.

Daily Dynamics of NOx and CO2 Emissions
Figure 1 presents 10-day moving averages of NOx (Figures 1A and 1C) and CO2 emissions
(Figures 1B and 1D) from January to April in 2019 and 2020. The 2019 emissions are directly
derived from the MEIC inventory, which is also the base for estimating the NOx and CO2 emissions
in 2020 constrained by TROPOMI observations. The 2019 emissions data show a reduction in the
daily NOx and CO2 by 30% and 38%, respectively, from 1st January to the Chinese New Year
2019 (5th February) and a rebound in emissions twenty days later when the holiday ended and
people returned to work. The larger decrease in CO2 than in NOx is because the major driver of
emissions decrease is the reduced activities in the power and industry sectors (where emissions
ratios of CO2 to NOx are large), while transport emissions (with low CO2 to NOx emission ratios)
decreased much less because travel demand was still high during the holiday.
The 2020 daily emissions constrained by TROPOMI observations, however, show much
faster decreases than those in 2019. During the period from 1st January to the Chinese New Year
2020 (25th January), NOx and CO2 emissions are estimated to have dropped by 58% and 51%,
respectively. The larger decrease in NOx emissions than in CO2 is due to a much larger decline in
the transport emissions than power and industrial emissions during the COVID-19 lockdown as
we will show in the following analysis. The daily emissions of NOx and CO2 in 2020 are estimated
up to be 50% and 40%, respectively, lower than those in 2019, and they did not return to the preholiday levels until two months later.
The divergence of the daily emissions between 2020 and 2019 corresponds to the timeline
of the virus control measures. The sharper emission declines in 2020 started on 20th January 2020,
when the most stringent control measures were activated by the National Health Commission. The
Wuhan lockdown began three days later on 23rd January 2020, which was followed by similar
measures in the other Chinese cities within the next few days. These lockdown measures did not
ease until about one month later when the lowest-risk regions and cities slowly reopened some of
the less exposed industries and businesses. About two months after the Chinese New Year 2020,
most of China’s cities had lifted the control measures including Wuhan that reopened on 8th April
after a 76-day lockdown. During the Wuhan lockdown period (grey shades in Figure 1), China’s
emissions were lower than the 2019 emissions by a cumulative of 892 kt NOx (21.9% net reduction,
green shades in Figure 1) and 348 Mt CO2 (16.2% net reduction, blue shades in Figure 1).

5

The total reduction in China’s CO2 emissions over January–April 2020 is equivalent to a
−11.5% decrease over the corresponding period of 2019, a bit higher than the estimate of −7.8%
(−3.6% to −12.9%) from (6). The largest emission reductions occurred in February, while the
emissions rapidly rebouned in March and April (Table S1), and the CO2 emissions in April 2020
is estimated +2.7% higher than that in 2019. The emission reductions over January–March 2020
are −15.6% compared to the the same period of 2019, which is higher than the the bottom-up
estimate of −10.3% from (13). Overall, our TROPOMI-constrained emission estimates present
larger emission reductions during January–April than the bottom-up estimates (6, 13).
We also used the bottom-up approach (see Methods) to estimate daily NOx and CO2
emissions in 2020 (dashed curves in Figures 2A and 2B), which are broadly comparable to the
TROPOMI constrained inversions but still reveal large discrepancies. The differences in the NOx
emissions mainly occur over the regions dominated by the emissions from transport (blue curve in
Figure 2C) and industry (yellow curve in Figure 2C), while the power sector also contributes to
the discrepancy in the CO2 emissions (red curve in Figure 2D). The bottom-up inventory tends to
overestimate industrial and transport emissions during the lockdown period, especially at the
beginning of lockdown, while tends to underestimate emissions for the power sector when
lockdown gradually lifted in March. Since the complete statistics of daily fuel combustion are not
available for the bottom-up inventory (see Methods), which relies instead on the daily data for 12%
of China’s power plants and some proxies such as the daily traffic congestion indices and monthly
industrial Gross Domestic Product (GDP) combined with the daily coal use in the power sector to
represent the relative changes of daily emissions, which is inevitably associated with uncertainties.
Drivers of CO2 Emissions Drop and Rebound
We decompose the difference in the ten-day moving average of CO2 emissions between
2020 and 2019 into power, industry, transport, and residential sectors (Figures 3A and 3B). The
industry sector was the major driver of the CO2 emissions changes. During the Wuhan lockdown
period (grey shades in Figure 3), the cumulative CO2 emissions from the industry sector declined
by 24.3% compared to those in 2019, accounting for 72% of the total reduction in CO2 emissions
for that period. The transport and power sectors are estimated to have experienced cumulative CO2
emissions reductions by 31.1% and 5.0%, respectively, contributing 18% and 10% of the total CO2
reduction. The emissions decline in the power sector was possibly driven by the lower demand by
industry that consumes more than two-thirds of the total electricity in China. Residential emissions
6

increased by 1%. The population-weighted heating degree day in 2020 winter was estimated 3%
lower than that in 2019 due to the high air temperature, therefore the larger residential emissions
in 2020 are mainly due to the more energy consumed when people were forced to stay at home,
especially at the beginning of the lockdown period. After the lockdown measures lifted, the
recovery of the industry and transport sectors rapidly pushed CO2 emissions back to pre-lockdown
levels.
The regional decomposition (Figure 3C and 3D) also confirms a CO2 emission dynamics
that was dominated by industry. China’s provinces were classified into three categories
distinguished by its increasing share of industrial GDP in the provincial total GDP and the length
of lockdown. The provinces dominated by the industrial economy were more sensitive to the
lockdown measures, with both a deeper drop and a faster recovery in emissions. The CO2
emissions declined by 8.2% in the provinces where industrial GDP contributes less than 34%
(median value of all the provinces) of the provincial total GDP (pink bars in Figure 3C and 3D).
However, the emission decreases were more than twice higher in provinces where the share of
industrial GDP is larger than 34%. The industrial provinces with a lockdown longer than 40 days
(dark blue bars in Figures 3C and 3D) show comparable reductions of CO2 emissions (−20.2%)
than those (−21.2%) with a shorter lockdown period (light blue bars in Figure 3C and 3D).
Response of Provincial Emissions to COVID-19
Half of China’s provinces are estimated to have reduced their cumulative CO2 emissions
by more than 15% from 23rd January 2020 to 7th April 2020 compared to the same period in 2019
(Figures 4A and 4B). Since the industrial sector was the major driver of this emission decline,
provinces with larger shares of the industrial economy experienced more CO2 emission reductions
than others (Figure 4B). The provinces of Jiangsu and Anhui that have the largest industrial
economies both reduced their CO2 emissions by more than 30%. We also observe large CO2
reductions in the Hubei Province whose capital is Wuhan and in Beijing and Shanghai,
significantly higher than the other provinces with similar economic structures due to the stringent
virus control measures in these provinces. It should also be noted that the CO2 emissions from
Guangxi Province located in the southwest of China are estimated to have increased by 5% during
the lockdown period. This is because the generation of hydroelectric power from Jan to March in
2020 was 27% lower than that in 2019 due to the severe drought in this region, which has caused

7

an increase in the generation of thermal power by 16% (http://www.stats.gov.cn/). The droughtinduced increased fossil fuel use in power plants offset the emissions decrease due to lockdown.
With China’s industry slowly recovering from the coronavirus, CO2 emissions from most
of China’s eastern provinces have returned to their pre-COVID-19 levels by April 2020, which are
higher than the emissions in the same period of 2019 (Figures 4C and 4D). The provinces whose
economy is dominated by industry restarted emissions rapidly, mirroring their larger drop during
the lockdown. The provinces that had experienced stringent lockdown did not rebound their CO2
emissions significantly, such as Hubei, Hebei, and Tianjin, although these provinces were
dominated by the industrial economy. These provinces stayed at the highest emergency response
levels against the coronavirus for more than 90 days. The emissions from Beijing and Shanghai
were 17% and 22%, respectively, lower than that in 2019 at this period, which exhibited
comparable and even larger reductions in CO2 emissions compared to the previous two months.
The Guangxi province, still suffering from the drought in April 2020, increased CO2 emissions by
29% compared to those in 2019, corresponding to the 30% increase in thermal power generation.
Discussion
This study presents the first-ever estimates of the ten-day moving average CO2 emissions
from satellite observations, derived from the near real-time and high spatial-temporal resolution
NO2 retrievals from TROPOMI, state-of-the-art chemical transport model GEOS-Chem, and CO2
to NOx source emission ratios from a detailed inventory of Chinese emissions, MEIC. The
substantial short-term variability in emissions due to the COVID-19 lockdown creates an
unmistakable signal despite known model uncertainties and satellite observation errors, providing
a unique opportunity to develop and validate satellite-based carbon emissions monitoring.
The uncertainties in our results lie in satellite observations of NO2 column densities,
determination of the NO2 column response to surface NOx emission changes by the GEOS-Chem
model, differentiating sectoral NOx emissions from satellite-constrained estimates, as well as CO2
to NOx emission ratios. Using spatial-temporal average and the relative difference of TROPOMI
data is expected to cancel a major part of the systematic errors in satellite observations. The
robustness of the response factor between NO2 column and anthropogenic NOx emissions is proved
by a series of sensitivity runs of the GEOS-Chem model. Corrections on sectoral emissions are
also tested through different definitions of the grid-cell dominant source sector and the inversion
results of ten-day mean CO2 emissions are found to be stable (Fig. S12). The influence of CO2 to
8

NOx ratios on the estimates of CO2 relative reductions from the 2019 MEIC data to the 2020
inversions is marginal as we use the consistent sector-specific ratio maps with MEIC. The
robustness of our estimates could also be demonstrated by the broad consistency of our estimates
with previous studies (6, 13) and with independent economic and industrial statistics data collected
on the monthly scales (Fig. S14). More details about the uncertainty analysis could be found in
Supplementary Materials.
Our findings show that although the COVID-19 lockdown dramatically reduced China’s
CO2 emissions during the first two months after the virus outbreak, the emissions rebounded
quickly as lockdown measures were lifted. In the first month after Wuhan reopened, which
essentially marked the end of the country lockdown, China’s CO2 emissions again reached preCOVID-19 levels and exceeded the level of emissions in the same period of 2019. These trends in
emissions were strongly influenced by the industry sector, which was the main driver in both the
decline and rebound of Chinese CO2 emissions over the short period. It is difficult to predict the
long-term effect of the pandemic on energy use and thus CO2 emissions. Lockdowns in some other
regions are now being relaxed, and economic stimulus packages are now being implemented in
China and other countries affected by COVID-19. But our results show that the effects on energy
and emissions depend on the strictness and duration of lockdowns in different regions, the
economic structures and recovery stimulus programs of those regions, the effectiveness of such
stimulus, and also whether and where a second wave of the virus and lockdowns recur. Regardless,
the method we have developed and demonstrate here will support efforts to monitor changes in
energy systems and emissions in near real-time as we navigate into that uncertain future.

Integrated modeling framework
This work integrates a detailed bottom-up inventory, high-quality spaceborne constraints,
and a chemical transport model to estimate 10-day mean dynamic changes in China’s NOx and
CO2 emissions from January to April in 2020, as depicted in Figure S1. We first develop a
preliminary bottom-up estimate of daily NOx and CO2 emissions in 2020 based on the Multiresolution Emission Inventory for China (MEIC, http://www.meicmodel.org/) (1, 2) in 2019
and relative changes in activity data and emission factors from 2019 to 2020. We then use a
nested-grid GEOS-Chem model (3, 4) at the horizontal resolution of 0.5°× 0.625°to establish
the spatial-temporal varied local relationship between the changes in surface NOx emissions
and changes in NO2 tropospheric vertical column densities (TVCDs). Such a relationship is
applied to changes in the satellite observed NO2 TVCDs from 2019 to 2020 derived from the
TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) (5) to infer high-resolution NOx emissions
in 2020 on the ten-day moving average scale. Prior to the top-down emission estimation,
changes in satellite NO2 TVCDs contributed by meteorological variations have been excluded.
Next, we use the top-down estimates of NOx emissions in 2020 to correct the sectoral emission
dynamics in the bottom-up emission estimates in 2020, based on the emission differences
revealed by the grid cells dominated by a single source sector. Correction in the emission
sectoral information helps capture the dynamics of the CO2 to NOx emission ratio in 2020,
which is different from that in 2019. Finally, the TROPOMI-constrained NOx emissions with
the constrained dynamic sectoral emission changes are combined with sector-specific ratios of
CO2 to NOx emissions to infer the ten-day moving average of CO2 emissions in 2020 from
specific sectors.
Bottom-up estimates of daily NOx and CO2 emissions
Daily emissions in 2019
The daily emissions of China in 2019 are derived from the MEIC model developed by
Tsinghua University (1, 2). MEIC is a technology-based emission model that tracks the
evolution of the manufacturing and pollution control technologies for more than 700
anthropogenic emission sources in China, which can be integrated into five source sectors of
power, industry, residential, transportation, and agriculture. The coal-fired power plants in the
power sector (6, 7) and the cement plants in the industry sector (8), the two important sources
of NOx and CO2 emissions in China, are treated as point sources with accurate geographic
locations, where emissions are estimated using the facility-level activity data and emission
factors. The other emission sources are all estimated as area sources using the province- or
2

county-level parameters (9, 10), and the emissions are downscaled on the grid cells at the
horizontal resolutions of 2°× 2.5°and 0.5°× 0.625°, respectively, to run the GEOS-Chem
global and nested grid simulations. At such spatial resolutions, the MEIC emission inventory
has an accurate representation of emission spatial distributions (11, 12) and emission annual
trends (13, 14), evaluated by satellite observations.
The MEIC model uses monthly and daily temporal profiles including electricity
generation, industry factory operating rate, traffic volume index, and heating degree day to
disaggregate the annual emission estimates to daily emissions. The daily sectoral NOx
emissions from January to April in 2019 are shown in Figure S2a. The CO2 to NOx emission
ratio varies substantially by source sector. According to the MEIC model results in 2019, the
CO2 to NOx emission ratios are on average 979, 623, 917, and 141 for the source sectors of
power, industry, residential, and transport, respectively. The largest value for the power sector
accounts for the pollution control on NOx in the coal-fired power plants, which has reduced the
NOx emission factors significantly. The large value for the residential sector is because the
residential stoves with low combustion efficiency generate less NOx per fuel burnt than the
high-efficiency boilers used in the power and industry sectors. The low CO2 to NOx emission
ratio of the transport sector is due to low carbon content of petroleum-based fuels and the high
emission factors of NOx from diesel vehicles and nonroad equipment. The CO2 to NOx
emission ratios distinct between source sectors combined with the daily emission variations in
these sectors further drive the daily dynamics of the national average CO2 to NOx emission
ratio as shown in Figure S2b. The low values around the Chinese New Year in 2019 are due to
the reduced activities in the power and industry sectors during the holiday.
Daily emissions in 2020
The daily emissions from January to April in 2020 are estimated on the base of the 2019
MEIC emissions data combined with the relative changes in activity data and emission factors
from 2019 to 2020 according to the method of (15). The 2020 emissions are estimated based
on the four source sectors in MEIC, which are power, industry, residential, and transportation.
The monthly emissions in 2020 are estimated first and are then disaggregated onto the daily
time scales.
The monthly growth rates of electricity generation, cement production, iron production,
and industrial Gross Domestic Product (GDP) from 2019 to 2020 are used to represent the
relative changes in the activity data of power plants, cement plants, iron and steel plants, and
the other industries, respectively. The monthly statistics data are derived from China’s National
Bureau of Statistics (http://www.stats.gov.cn/). It should be noted that several assumptions had
to be made to make the emission estimates in 2020 possible. First, the statistics data for January
3

and February were combined together, so we assume that the activity changes in these two
months are the same. Second, the growth rate in the electricity generation is only available for
all of the thermal electricity, which includes coal-, oil-, and natural gas-fired electricity that
cannot be further split. We assume that the activity data of all of the thermal power plants
follow the same monthly changes from 2019 to 2020. Third, the industrial GDP is used to
roughly represent the relative change of the industrial activities, although the economic values
may not directly reflect the changes in the fossil fuel burned. These three assumptions
mentioned above could cause uncertainties in the estimates of monthly emissions in the power
and industrial sectors in 2020.
For the residential and transport sectors, there are no monthly statistics of how much fuel
has been burned in each month of 2020. We rely on the population-weighted heating degree
day (HDD) and on the Baidu population migration data, respectively, to represent the relative
changes in the activities of these two sectors from 2019 to 2020. For the residential sector, we
calculate the population-weighted HDD for all of China’s cities in each month of 2019 and
2020 to represent the relative change of the residential energy use in each city. The gridded
population data are exploited from Gridded Population of the World, Version 4 (GPWv4) (16),
and the surface temperature data are derived from the ERA5 dataset produced by ECMWF
(17). The reference temperature is set at 18 ℃ (18). For the transport sector, we use the Baidu
migration data (https://qianxi.baidu.com/2020/) within each city to represent the relative
change in activity data of the transport sector from 2019 to 2020 in each city. There could be
uncertainties in using Baidu migration data to estimate transport emissions because the Baidu
location-based services track all of the surface transport within cities including walk, bicycles,
vehicles, and subways. And the way we use this index to predict activity changes in both the
road and nonroad sources also involves uncertainties.
We multiply the monthly growth rates in the activity data of each emission source sector
mentioned above by the emissions in the corresponding month of 2019 and the change of NOx
emission factors from the beginning to the end of 2019 given by the MEIC model to estimate
the monthly NOx emissions from January to April in 2020. The emission factor of CO2 is
assumed unchanged so the monthly CO2 emissions are estimated just based on the activity
growth rates. The monthly emissions in 2020 are split into the daily time scales based on several
proxies. The emissions from power plants are split into daily scales based on the daily coal
consumption of the six major power generation groups in China (Fig. S3a), which accounted
for 12% of China’s coal consumption in the power sector in 2019. The industrial emissions
from iron and steel plants, coke plants, and coal mines are split into daily scales based on the
daily operating rates over the whole of China (Fig. S3b to S3e). All the other industrial
4

emissions are split into the daily scale on the base of daily coal consumption in the major power
generation groups (Fig. S3a), which causes uncertainties in the daily emission estimates of the
industry sector. The monthly emissions from the residential and transport sectors of each city
are split into daily emissions based on the daily variation of the population-weighted HDD
(Fig. S4) and the Baidu index (Fig. S5) in each city.
10-day mean NOx emissions inferred from TROPOMI
Relative changes in NO2 TVCDs between 2019 and 2020 from TROPOMI
Relative changes in NO2 TVCDs over China are retrieved from TROPOMI (5).
TROPOMI is the single sensor onboard the European Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P)
satellite launched in 2017. The instrument provides nearly daily global coverage and ascends
across the equator at approximately 13:30 local time. We use NO2 TVCDs from the official
TM5-MP-DOMINO

version

1.2/1.3

offline

product

(http://www.temis.nl/airpollution/no2col/data/tropomi/) (19). Only pixels with quality
assurance value above 0.5 and cloud fraction below 30% are kept to reduce the retrieval errors.
NO2 measurements are then aggregated to a spatial resolution of 0.5°× 0.625°to match the
grid of GEOS-Chem (Fig. S6a and S6b). During the first four months of 2020, the satellite NO2
TVCDs decreased in most places over China, especially in Wuhan and the surrounding area
(Fig. S6c). On average, the national NO2 TVCDs drop over China is 22% compared to the same
period in 2019.
The unprecedented spatial coverage and resolution of TROPOMI retrievals enhance the
capability of tracking the changes in satellite NO2 TVCDs on a high spatial-temporal scale (20,
21). To smooth out daily fluctuations in NO2 TVCDs caused by random errors and increase the
sample number and spatial coverage, we calculate the 10-day moving average in each year
(Fig. S6e). Figure S7 shows the distribution of the valid sample days in each grid cell for each
10-day period. Note that grid cells dominated by natural sources (defined as NO2 TVCDs below
1×1015 molec/cm2 in this study), which are more than half of all grid cells in China, are
excluded in the following analysis because we mainly focus on anthropogenic emissions (22).
In the remaining valid grid cells, the average share of grid cells with more than 5 valid sample
days could reach 87%, and they cover 81% of national anthropogenic NOx emissions over
China (Fig. S7c), indicating that the 10-day moving average value used in this work are
representative for the emission estimates over China.
Dynamic local relationship between changes in NOx emissions and NO2 TVCDs provided by
GEOS-Chem
NO2 TVCDs are strongly related to surface NOx emissions since 1) the lifetime of NOx is
short and 2) NO2/NOx ratio is high in the boundary layer. Previous studies have used chemical
5

transport models to build the relationship between changes in surface NOx emissions (E) and
changes in NO2 TVCDs (Ω) and rapidly update NOx emissions based on satellite observations
(23-26). Following such a method, we use the nested-grid GEOS-Chem model to establish the
relationship between changes in NOx emissions and NO2 TVCDs.
We use the GEOS-Chem version 12.3.0 (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2620535) driven
by assimilated meteorological fields from the NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation
Office’s Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications Version 2
(MERRA-2) (27). For the simulation over China, we use the nested-grid configuration over
Southeast Asia at a spatial resolution of 0.5°×0.625°(3, 4), with boundary conditions adopted
from a 2° × 2.5° global simulation. We use the “tropchem” mechanism that simulates full
chemistry in the troposphere. Vertical mixing in the planetary boundary layer is simulated
using a nonlocal mixing scheme (28).
For the baseline simulation in 2019, anthropogenic emissions over Southeast Asia are
taken from the MIX inventory (29), while emissions in mainland China are replaced by
emissions from the MEIC model for the year 2019 as described in the previous section. GEOSChem includes additional NOx emission sources such as lightning (30), soil and fertilizer (31),
shipping and aircraft. Figure S8 shows the comparison between coincidently sampled
simulated and satellite-retrieved NO2 TVCDs for the baseline scenario. The spatial pattern of
the baseline simulation is very similar to the NO2 TVCDs from TROPOMI, and they agree
very well with R2 = 0.89 and slope = 0.98.
Following Lamsal et al. (23), we also conduct a perturbation scenario with anthropogenic
NOx emissions over China reduced by 40%. Then we get:
𝛽𝑡,𝑖 =

Ω𝑡,𝑖,𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑡𝑢𝑏𝑒𝑑,2019 −Ω𝑡,𝑖,𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒,2019

where subscript perturbed and base represent the perturbation scenario and the baseline,
respectively and t represents each 10-day period. Ω𝑡,𝑖,𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑡𝑢𝑏𝑒𝑑,2019 and Ω𝑡,𝑖,𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒,2019 are
model simulated NO2 TVCDs on 10-day period t over grid cell i in 2019. ∆E is the 40%
emission perturbation. 𝛽𝑡,𝑖 is a unitless factor that represents the local sensitivity of changes
in NO2 columns to changes in NOx on 10-day period t in grid cell i.
Figure S9a shows the spatial variation of four-month averaged β coincidently sampled
with the TROPOMI data. Generally, β tends to be less than one in polluted regions such as
the North China Plain, the Yangtze River Delta, and the Pearl River Delta, because an increase
in NOx emissions consumes OH and increases the NOx lifetime. While in clean areas where an
increase in NOx emissions decreases the NOx lifetime, β tends to be greater than one. Figure
S9b shows the 10-day moving average of national β over China. β is smaller in winter when

6

the concentrations of OH and RO2 radicals are lower, and increases in spring, which reflects
longer NOx lifetime in winter time.
Sensitivity tests of β value
Error in β is one of the sources of uncertainty in our overall approach. Therefore,
sensitivity tests are conducted to test the robustness of β obtained from the model simulation.
Lamsal et al. (23) used the global GEOS-Chem model to perform several tests and proved
the stability of β. For example, they find that a perturbation of 30% NOx emissions instead of
15% changes global averaged β by <2%. Increasing anthropogenic VOCs and CO by 15%
increases the global value of β by 2.8% and 1.0%, respectively. When NOx emissions are only
perturbed for a single grid cell in Ohio, β in neighboring grids is affected by 2–6%, which
indicates that β is barely influenced by the transport of NO2 from other grid cells at the
resolution of 2°× 2.5°.
In this study, we use the nested-grid model with higher resolution than the global model
used in Lamsal et al. (23), which are believed to better resolve the nonlinear NOx chemistry
and heterogeneous emission sources. However, β obtained from smaller grid cells might be
more affected by the transport of NO2 from neighboring grids or background area, especially
during winter time when the NO2 lifetime is longer. We therefore conduct a sensitivity test
using the global GEOS-Chem model to simulate β as a comparison. Results show that the
national average value of β is similar in different model resolutions, and the estimated NOx
emissions are within 2.6% difference.
We also find that perturbing NOx emissions by 30% or 50% instead of 40% only changes
β by –0.7% and 0.8%. We also conduct sensitivity scenarios with an additional 20% decrease
in CO and a 40% decrease in VOCs, which increase β by 2.5% nationally. The results of the
sensitivity tests show that the β value is quite robust.
Excluding meteorological influences in NO2 TVCDs changes
Variations in meteorological conditions contribute to the changes in satellite observed
NO2 TVCDs between 2019 and 2020, especially on short-term time scales. To exclude
meteorological impacts, we conduct a model simulation with anthropogenic emissions fixed in
2019 driven by meteorological fields in 2020 (fixemis). Then we get:

cell i for the fixed emission scenario and baseline, respectively. The relative changes between
2019 and 2020 excluding the influence from meteorological variation are shown in Figure S6d.
Compared to the sharp drop of NO2 TCVDs during this time, the influence of meteorological
changes is minor.
10-day mean NOx emissions inferred from TROPOMI
We use the 10-day running average β value from equation S1, changes in NO2 TVCDs
between 2019 and 2020 contributed by anthropogenic emissions from equation S2, and bottomup emissions in 2019 to infer NOx emissions in 2020, as shown below:

where 𝐸𝑡,𝑖,𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑑,2020 represents the TROPOMI-constrained NOx emissions in 2020 and
𝐸𝑡,𝑖,𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚−𝑢𝑝,2019 indicates the bottom-up estimates of 2019 emissions from MEIC. Here we
emphasize again that we limit our calculations only to grid cells dominated by anthropogenic
emission sources, which is defined as tropospheric NO2 columns above 1×1015 molec/cm2.
10-day mean CO2 emissions inferred from NOx emissions
Sectoral NOx emissions inferred from TROPOMI constraints
Since the CO2 to NOx emission ratio depends on the source sector, it is important to know
sectoral NOx emissions to convert TROPOMI-constrained NOx emissions to CO2 emissions.
Our bottom-up emission estimates in 2020 provide sectoral emissions at the daily scales, while
the imperfect daily statistics data we used leave uncertainties in the sectoral emissions, which
show discrepancies in total NOx emissions compared to the TROPOMI-constrained estimates
(Fig. S10a). Here, we use the TROPOMI-constrained NOx emissions to correct the biases in
the sectoral emission distributions from the bottom-up inventory in 2020, which finally makes
the bottom-up emissions data match top-down estimates (Fig. S10a). Our method is described
as follows.
First, we subtract the bottom-up estimated NOx emission map in 2020 from the
TROPOMI-constrained NOx emission map at the time scale of the 10-day moving average.

where t is the time on the base of the 10-day moving average from January to April in 2020, i

grid i in time t, NOxt,i,bottom-up is the bottom-up estimate of NOx emissions at grid i in time t,
∆NOxt,i is the gridded emission difference between TROPOMI-constrained and bottom-up
emission estimates.

Next, we classify grid cells based on the dominant emission source sector in each grid
cell. Before the COVID-19 lockdown (23rd January 2020), we assume that the dominant sector
in each grid cell in 2020 is consistent with that in the same period of 2019. We calculate the
average percentages of emissions from power, industry, residential, and transport sectors in
each grid cell using the MEIC emissions in January 2019. The dominant emission source sector
in each grid cell is defined as the source sector that accounts for more than 50% of emissions
in that grid. Figure S11 shows the examples of the grid cells dominated by power, industry,
and transport sectors, where the TROPOMI can observe large NO2 column enhancement at the
locations of point sources and road networks. We also try the threshold values of 60%, 70%,
and 80% to test the sensitivity, which will be discussed later. Then we calculate the differences
in national emissions estimated for each source sector in 2020 (Fig. S10b).

NOxt , s   NOxt ,i , s

where t is the time before 23rd January 2020, s is the source sector (power, industry, residential,

bottom-up emission estimates in time t at the grid cell i where the NOx emissions from the
sector s accounts for more than 50% of emissions, ∆NOxt,s is the emission difference between
TROPOMI-constrained and bottom-up emission estimates in the sector s for the whole country
in time t. Very few grid cells are dominated by residential NOx emissions, so we do not consider
this sector here.
Then, we want to know how much emissions from each emission source sector should be
corrected on the basis of ∆NOxt,s. We calculate the contribution of the grid cells dominated by
one single sector to China’s total emissions of this sector. The grid cells dominated by power,
industry, and transport emissions account for about 25%, 32%, and 34%, respectively, of the
total NOx emissions from each sector (Fig. S10c). We rely on these values to estimate
correction factors for the NOx emissions from each source sector.

𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑑
(𝑁𝑂𝑥𝑡,𝑖,𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚−𝑢𝑝
).

The corrections described above are made day by day for the period before 23rd January
2020. After 23rd January 2020, the lockdown has influenced the emissions from each source
sector differently, therefore the method to determine the dominant emission source sector in
each grid cell cannot be performed based on the 2019 emissions anymore. Therefore for each
day, we use the corrected sectoral emission maps on its prior day before we identify the
dominant source sector on that day. And using the same method described above to constrain
sectoral emission maps for each day.
Figure S10b shows the differences in NOx emissions between the preliminary bottom-up
estimates and the TROPOMI-constrained inversions over the grid cells dominated by different
source sectors. These results suggest that the uncertainties in the bottom-up estimates mainly
occur in the transport and industry sectors. The preliminary bottom-up inventories in 2020 tend
to overestimate emissions during the lockdown, especially at the beginning of the lockdown
period, while slightly underestimate emissions after the end of lockdown. This is due to the
imperfect knowledge of the changes in the daily dynamics of the transport and the industrial
activities, and the proxies such as the people migration index and the industrial GDP are not
accurate enough to predict emissions. The power sector shows smaller uncertainties because
we have monthly electricity generation and the daily coal use in the power plants that account
for 12% of China’s power sector coal consumption. However, due to the uncertainties in these
data as discussed before, the power sector emissions are still slightly underestimated in the
bottom-up inventory.
The emissions differences shown in Figure S10b are estimated on the grid cells dominated
by a single source sector, and these grid cells contribute about 20-50% of the emissions of this
sector (Fig. S10c). Using this information, we have corrected the NOx emissions from power,
industry, and transport sectors, while the residential emissions are not changed. We already get
the daily sectoral NOx emission maps constrained by both the bottom-up information and the
top-down constraints. The corrected bottom-up emission results match better with the
TROPOMI-constrained emissions than the preliminary bottom-up estimates (Fig. S10a), which
suggests that the grid cells dominated by different source sectors we selected represent the
emission dynamics of each sector well. It should be noted that the remaining differences
between the corrected bottom-up estimates and the TROPOMI inversions include the biases in
the residential emissions that we ignore in the sectoral-level corrections above. Therefore, we
scale the corrected sectoral bottom-up emission maps to be consistent with the TROPOMIconstrained NOx emission maps, which could partly correct the biases in the residential sector
10

emissions and finally achieve sectoral NOx emissions maps that are consistent with the
TROPOMI constrained total NOx emissions.
Sectoral CO2 emissions inferred from TROPOMI constraints
We estimate the CO2 emissions from the TROPOMI constrained NOx emissions according
to the following equation:

where CO2t,i,TROPOMI represents the TROPOMI constrained CO2 emissions at grid i in time t,
NOxt,i,s,TROPOMI represents the TROPOMI constrained NOx emissions from sector s (power,
industry, residential, and transport) at grid i in time t, CO2i,s/NOxi,s is the ratio of CO2 to NOx
emissions for sector s in grid i, Ai,s represents the activities of sector s in grid i, EFCO2i,s and
EFNOxi,s represent the emission factors of CO2 and NOx, respectively, of sector s in grid i,
EFCO2i,s,MEIC2019 and EFNOxi,s,MEIC2019 represent the emission factors of CO2 and NOx of sector
s in grid i derived from the MEIC 2019 data, and rCO2i,s and rNOx i,s represent the reduction
ratios of CO2 and NOx emission factors, respectively, from the beginning to the end of 2019.
First, we get the CO2 to NOx emission ratio maps (EFCO2i,s,MEIC2019 and EFNOxi,s,MEIC2019)
from the MEIC emission model for power, industry, residential, and transport sectors in China
averaged from January to April in 2019. We adjust these emission ratio maps according to the
pollution control progresses on NOx (rNOxi,s) that occurred in China in 2019, which reduced
NOx emission factors of the power and cement plants by 6–10% from 2019 to 2020. The
information on the emission control measures and the impacts on the NOx emission factors are
both derived from the MEIC emission model. Since the CO2 emission factor of each sector is
assumed stable (rCO2i,s equals to zero), those pollution control measures slightly increased the
CO2 to NOx emission ratios, which were taken into account in our analysis. The adjusted CO2
to NOx emission ratio maps are multiplied by the TROPOMI-constrained sectoral NOx
emissions to estimate the CO2 emissions in 2020. These calculations are based on the 0.5°×
0.625°GEOS-Chen model grid cells and on the time scale of the 10-day moving average.
Figure S12 presents the CO2 emissions estimates using different threshold values for the
definition of the dominant source sector. We use the threshold values from 0.5 to 0.8, while the
11

cumulative CO2 emissions from January to April only vary by less than 4%. The results suggest
that the identification of the dominant source sector according to different threshold values
does not significantly influence the CO2 emissions estimates.
We compare the ten-day moving average CO2 to NOx emission ratios between 2019 and
2020 for the whole country (Fig. S13). The largest difference is that the CO2 to NOx emission
ratio slightly decreased during the Spring Festival holiday in 2019 while increased over the
same period in 2020. This is because the transport emissions decreased substantially during the
Spring Festival holiday in 2020 due to the stringent lockdown measures. The CO2 to NOx
emission ratios are much lower in the transport sector than the other sectors, so the average
CO2 to NOx emission ratios are estimated to have increased during the holiday and the
lockdown period in 2020. After the lockdown measures eased, the average CO2 to NOx
emission ratios in 2020 returned to the same levels as in 2019. In normal years like 2019, the
travel demand is still high during the Spring Festival holiday, therefore the transport emissions
change much less and the CO2 to NOx emission ratios decrease driven by the reduced power
and industrial emissions.
Uncertainties
Our results are subject to a number of uncertainties and limitations. The uncertainties in
estimating the top-down NOx emissions mainly come from errors in the satellite NO2 TVCDs
and uncertainties in β. The dynamic sectoral distribution of TROPOMI-constrained NOx
emissions and the CO2 to NOx emission ratios used to convert NOx emissions to CO2 emissions
introduce additional uncertainties in the final results. The uncertainty in each step of our
analysis is discussed below.
First, the satellite retrievals of NO2 TVCDs usually suffer from uncertainties in the
radiative transfer model and in the ancillary data utilized for calculating the stratospheric NO2
background and the air mass factors. For example, the TROPOMI single-pixel errors are
typically ~40-60% in winter time (32). We use spatial and temporal averaging in our analysis
to reduce the random errors. Meanwhile, TROPOMI NO2 is found to be systematically
underestimated over China (33), especially over polluted regions. However, relative
differences between 2019 and 2020 are used to derive NOx emission changes, which could
cancel out a major part of the systematic errors.
Second, the β value simulated by GEOS-Chem model reflects the feedback of NOx
emissions on NOx chemistry, which could be affected by a lot of factors, such as the model
representation of chemical and physical processes (e.g. transport and deposition), the model
resolution, and changes in emissions of other species involved in the NOx chemistry. We
evaluate the model simulation against satellite data to prove the model’s ability to capture the
12

characteristics of NO2 columns. We also conduct several sensitivity scenarios to show the
robustness of β value, as discussed in previous sections. The variations of β when
considering different perturbation magnitude of NOx emissions, influences from other species
and different model resolutions are small and β is proved to be quite robust.
Third, since the CO2-to-NOx ratio is sector-specific, we need to capture the dynamic
sectoral distribution of NOx emissions from Jan to Apr in 2020 for the conversion from CO2 to
NOx. We use the TROPOMI-constrained NOx emissions to correct the sectoral emissions from
the bottom-up estimates, based on the grid cells dominated by one single emission source, as
discussed above. The thresholds used for the determination of dominant source sector in each
grid could be the largest error source here. Sensitivity tests using threshold values from 0.5 to
0.8 obtain similar CO2 emission estimations (Fig. S12), reflecting the robustness of our method.
Finally, the sector-specific CO2-to-NOx ratio maps we achieved from the MEIC emission
model also include some uncertainties, which could influence the absolute magnitude of the
CO2 emissions estimates. The uncertainties in NOx emission inventories are typically higher
than those in CO2 emissions inventories, while the MEIC NOx inventory we used in this study
has revealed a good performance when modeling with the GEOS-Chem model and comparing
it to the TROPOMI NO2 column observations (Fig. S8). Besides, the influence of the potential
uncertainties in the CO2-to-NOx ratios on the estimates of CO2 emissions reductions from 2019
to 2020 is relatively marginal, because we use consistent sector-specific CO2-to-NOx ratio
maps with the MEIC model and the comparison is also performed with the MEIC emissions.
We also compare the CO2 emissions estimated from the TROPOMI-constrained NOx
emissions with the economic and industrial statistics data collected on the monthly scales (Fig.
S14). The relative changes in the 2020 CO2 emissions compared to those in 2019 are consistent
with those indicators of the industry in China, which independently evaluate our estimates of
the CO2 emission changes.
