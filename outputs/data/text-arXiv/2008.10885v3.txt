Abstract
We develop a novel temporal complex network approach to quantify the
US county level spread dynamics of COVID-19. The objective is to study
the effects of the local spread dynamics, COVID-19 cases and death, and
Google search activities on the US stock market. We use both conventional
econometric and Machine Learning (ML) models. The results suggest that
COVID-19 cases and deaths, its local spread, and Google searches have impacts on abnormal stock prices between January 2020 to May 2020. In addition, incorporating information about local spread significantly improves
the performance of forecasting models of the abnormal stock prices at longer
forecasting horizons. On the other hand, although a few COVID-19 related
variables, e.g., US total deaths and US new cases exhibit causal relationships
on price volatility, COVID-19 cases and deaths, local spread of COVID-19,
and Google search activities do not have impacts on price volatility.

1. Introduction
After the COVID-19 pandemic started spreading worldwide, the US stock
market collapsed significantly with the S&P 500 dropping 38% between
February 24, 2020 and March 20, 2020. Similar declines have occurred in
other stock indices. A number of recent studies attempt to assess the imPreprint submitted to Elsevier

pact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the stock market. Nicola et al. (2020)
provide a review on the socioeconomic effects of COVID-19 on individual
aspects of the world economy. Baker et al. (2020) analyze the reasons why
the U.S. stock market reacted so much more adversely to COVID-19 than
to previous pandemics that occurred in 1918 − 1919, 1957 − 1958 and 1968.
Wagner (2020) gives a picture of post-COVID-19 economic world. Onali
(2020), Zaremba et al. (2020), Arias-Calluari et al. (2020), and Cao et al.
(2020) perform statistical modeling to analyze the effect of COVID-19 on
the stock market price and volatility, and Cox et al. (2020) study the effects
of policy announcements on the stock market during the early period of the
pandemic.
However, there are still a number of important questions that need to be
investigated. For example,
1. How can we quantify the local spread dynamics of COVID-19 and do
the local spread, e.g., US county level spread of COVID-19, affect stock
prices?
2. Do the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths influence stock prices?
3. Do the local spread, the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths influence the stock market’s volatility?
4. Do the Google search volumes related to COVID-19 exhibit any relationship with the stock price and volatility?
5. Do the local spread of COVID-19, the number of cases and deaths, and
Google search volumes convey any additional information about the
stock price dynamics, given more conventional economic variables?
In this study, we assess to what extent local spread affects the stock
market price and volatility. In order to quantify the local spread of COVID19, we introduce the concept of temporal network and network motifs. The
network structure allows us to leverage much richer data set that includes
information not only about the total number of cases, but also about the
spread across counties over time.
The stock market reacts to different local and global major events. Cagle
(1996), Worthington and Valadkhani (2004), Worthington (2008), Cavallo
and Noy (2009), and Shan and Gong (2012) study the impact of natural
2

disasters, e.g., hurricanes and earthquakes, on the stock market. Hudson and
Urquhart (2015), Schneider and Troeger (2006), Chau et al. (2014), Beaulieu
et al. (2006), and Huynh and Burggraf (2019) evaluate the effect of political
uncertainty and war on the stock market. The influences of the outbreak of
infectious diseases, e.g., Ebola and SARS, on the stock indices are assessed
in Nippani and Washer (2004), Siu and Wong (2004), Lee and McKibbin
(2004), and Ichev and Marinč (2018).
Investor sentiment is another crucial determinant of stock market dynamics. However, quantifying investor sentiment is not an easy task because of its
unobservable and heterogeneous behaviors (Garcı́a Petit et al. (2019), Gao
et al. (2020), Baker and Wurgler (2007), Bandopadhyaya and Jones (2005)).
In recent years, due to data availability, Google search volume has become
a popular index of investor sentiment (Bijl et al. (2016), Kim et al. (2019),
Preis et al. (2013)). Bollen et al. (2011) determine Twitter feeds as the moods
of investors and use the Twitter mood to predict the stock market. Alanyali
et al. (2013), Schumaker and Chen (2008), Bomfim (2003), and Albuquerque
and Vega (2008) evaluate the relationship between financial news and the
stock market and find that news related to the asset significantly impact the
corresponding stock price and volatility. Cox et al. (2020) use a dynamic
asset pricing model and high-frequency policy announcement news to study
the effects of policy on the stock market during the COVID-19 crisis, and find
that movements during the crisis have been more reflective of sentiment than
substance, with the response to sentiment being a more important driver in
the stock market than the responses to the actual policy actions.
Similarly, the economics literature has shown that the inclusion of additional predictors for regional and local variables substantially improves nowcasts and forecasts for aggregate activity (Hernández-Murillo and Owyang
(2006)), with the gains typically being concentrated during periods of large
negative movements (Owyang et al. (2015)). Because local spread may be
indicative both of disruption in local economic activity and might be linked
to local sentiment, we augment the standard aggregate models with variables
that capture the local spread. We introduce the concept of network motifs
to model the local spread. This allows us to utilize multi-source information
to quantify the impact of the spread on the US stock market. The rest of
the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data, constructs a
temporal network for COVID-19 spread, and defines the variables used in the
study. The methodology is described in Section 3. Section 4 presents findings
and a discussion of the results. Finally, Section 5 provides a conclusion.

2. Data and Variables
The S&P 500 closing price from June 3, 2019 to May 29, 2020 data are
obtained from Yahoo! Finance (Yahoo! (2020)). Google search data from
January 2, 2020 to May 29, 2020 are obtained from Google Trends. We get US
County level COVID-19 case data from the New York Times (NYT (2020))
and US county information from the US National Weather Service (NWS
(2020)).
2.1. Abnormal stock price and volatility
We evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on abnormalities in the S&P 500
index. We define the daily abnormal S&P 500 price (AP) between January
2, 2020 and May 29, 2020 by subtracting the average price of the last seven
months from the daily price and by dividing the resultant difference from the
standard deviation of the last seven months (i.e., 148 days) as follows:
Pt −

σP
where, Pt is the daily closing price for day t, σP is the standard deviation of
the closing price in the last 148 days (Kim et al. (2019), Bijl et al. (2016)).
We use daily squared log returns of prices Pt as a proxy for daily volatility

2.2. COVID-19 cases
We study the impact of a number of COVID-19 variables (C), e.g., daily
US total cases, daily US new cases, daily World total cases, etc. on APt and
V olt . For a complete list of COVID-19 variables see Table 1. We standardized
each COVID-19 variable on the basis of a rolling average of the past 7 days
and corresponding standard deviation as:
CVt =

C t − µC
,
σC

(3)

where, Ct is a COVID-19 variable (e.g., US total cases) at day t, µC and
σC are the mean and standard deviation of the corresponding variable within
the sliding window of days [t − k, t − 1].

2.3. Local Spread through complex network analysis
A complex network represents a collection of elements and their interrelationship. A network consists of a pair G = (V, E) of sets, where V is
a set of nodes, and E ⊂ V × V is a set of edges, (i, j) ∈ E represents an
edge (relationship) from node i to node j. Here |V | is the number of nodes
and |E| is the number of edges. The degree du of a node
P u is the number
of edges incident to u i.e., for u,v ∈ V and e ∈ E, du = u6=v eu,v . A graph
G0 = (V 0 , E 0 ) is a subgraph of G, if V 0 ⊆ V and E 0 ∈ E. The largest
connected component (GC) is the maximal connected subgraph of G. The
elements of the n × n-symmetric adjacency matrix, A, of G can be written
as
(
1, if (i, j) ∈ E
Aij =
(4)
0, otherwise.
A higher-order network structure, e.g., motif, represents local interaction
pattern of the network. In a disease transmission a network motif provides
significant insights about the spread of the diseases. For example, the presence of a dense motif or fully connected motif can increase the spread of the
disease through the network, while a chain-like motif can decrease the spread
of the disease (Leitch et al. (2019)). A motif is a recurrent multi-node subgraph pattern. A detailed description of network motifs and their functionality in a complex network can be found in Milo et al. (2002), Ahmed et al.
(2016), Rosas-Casals and Corominas-Murtra (2009), Akcora et al. (2018),
and Dey et al. (2019b). Figure 1 shows all connected 3-node motifs (T) and
4-node motifs (M ).

Figure 1: All 3-node and 4-node connected network motifs.

Temporal Network is an emerging extension of network analysis which appears in many domains of knowledge, including epidemiology (Valdano et al.
(2015), Demirel et al. (2017), Enright and Kao (2018)), and finance (Battiston et al. (2010), Zhao et al. (2018), Begušić et al. (2018)). A temporal
network is a network structure that changes in time. That is, a temporal
5

network can be represented with a time indexed graph Gt = (V (t), E(t)),
where, V (t) is the set of nodes in the network at time t, E(t) ⊂ V (t) × V (t)
is a set of edges in the network at time t. Here t is either discrete or continuous. Figure 2 depicts a small 15-node temporal network with time t = 1, 2,
and 3.

Figure 2: A changing network shown over three time steps.

In order to quantify the county level spread of COVID-19 we construct
a complex network (Gt ) in each day (t) between Jan 2, 2020 to May 29,
2020: G = {G1 , . . . , GT }, where T = 130. We evaluate the occurrences of
different motifs in each Gt . An increase number of motifs, i.e., T and M , and
other network features e.g., E, indicate a higher spread in a local community.
These increases of higher order network structures have potential impacts on
AP and V ol.
Let C be the set of counties in US, I is the set of COVID-19 new cases
identified in C on a day t, and D is the pairwise distance matrix in miles
among centroid of the counties in C. We use the following three steps to
construct the COVID-19 spread network (Gt ) at time t and compute the
occurrences of motifs in Gt :
1. Each County in C with γ or more COVID-19 new cases, γ ∈ Z+ , makes
a node in the network (Gt ).
2. Two counties (i.e., nodes), i and j, are connected by an edge if (1)
both counties have λ or more COVID-19 new cases, λ ∈ Z+ , and (2)
the distance between i and j is less than δ, δ ∈ R≥0 . Therefore, the
adjacency matrix, At , is written as
(
1, if Ii , Ij > λ & Dij > δ
Atij =
0, otherwise.

cases (γ = 5) on April 11, 2020. (b) Represents the corresponding spread network (λ = 5,
δ = 100) with 514 nodes and 3831 edges.

3. We compute occurrences of nodes (Vt ), edges (Et ), different 3-node
motif (T (t)), different 4-node motifs (M (t)), and size of the largest
connected component (GC(t)) in Gt .
In this study, we choose γ = 5, λ = 5, and δ = 100. That is, if two
counties both have 5 or more COVID-19 cases and if the distance between
these two counties is less than 100 miles they are connected by an edge.
However, any appropriate choice of the parameters γ, λ, and δ can also be
used to construct the COVID-19 spread network (Gt ). For illustration, Fig. 3
shows the COVID-19 spread network in US counties on April 11, 2020. We
consider different network features e.g., E, T , M , etc. as metrics of the local
spread of COVID-19. We normalize each of the network variables based on
Eq. 3 as
SPt =

Nt − µN
,
σN

(6)

where, Nt is a network variable (e.g., E) at day t, µN and σN are the mean and
standard deviation of the corresponding variable within the sliding window
of days [t − k, t − 1].
2.4. Google Trend data
A number of studies, e.g., Preis et al. (2010), Bijl et al. (2016), and
Kim et al. (2019), show that there is a significant correlation between stock
7

variables (e.g., return, volume, and volatility) and related Google searches,
and Google search data can be used to predict future stock prices.
We investigate whether Google trend data affect the abnormal price, AP ,
and volatility, V ol. We obtain the volume of the COVID-19 related daily
Google searches (e.g., “Coronavirus”) from Jan 2, 2020 to May 29, 2020. We
select the location of a query in “US” and in the “World”. We standardized
each Google search variable similar to Eq. 3 as
GTt =

Gt − µG
,
σG

(7)

where, Gt is a Google search variable at day t, µG and σG are the mean and
standard deviation of the corresponding variable within the sliding window
of days [t − k, t − 1]. Table 1 provides an overview of the data sets and
variables that are used in this study. 1

In a robustness check experiment, we also consider Google Trend searches for various
economic policy variables, and the news based economic policy uncertainty index from
Baker et al. (2016) as additional explanatory variables. However, while these variables
were significantly correlated with abnormal returns, they did not have a causal relationship
at any lag. For brevity, the results for the additional policy variables are reported in the
Appendix.

3. Methodology
We investigate the impact of COVID-19 cases and deaths, local spread of
COVID-19, and COVID-19 related Google search volumes on the abnormal
stock price and volatility.
3.1. Correlation and Causality
A correlation test is widely used as an initial step to evaluate the relationship between the stock market and a potential covariate (Preis et al. (2010),
Alanyali et al. (2013), Preis et al. (2013), Kim et al. (2019)). In this study,
we use Spearman’s rank correlation to study correlation between stock data
(AP and V ol) and each of the COVID-19 related variables.
To assess potential predictive utilities of COVID-19 cases, local spread,
and Google search interests on abnormal price formation (AP ) and V ol,
we apply the concept of Granger causality (Granger (1969)). The Granger
causality test evaluates whether one time series is useful in forecasting another. Let Yt , t ∈ Z + be a p × 1-random vector (APt or Vt ) and let
t
= σ{Ys : s = 0, 1, . . . , t} denote a σ-algebra generated from all obF(Y)
servations of Y in the market up to time t. Consider a sequence of random
vectors {Yt , Xt }, where X can be either COVID-19 cases, local spread or
Google search volumes. Suppose that for all h ∈ Z +

t−1

Ft+h ·|F(Y,X) = Ft+h ·|FY ,

(8)



t−1
where Ft+h ·|F(Y,X) and Ft+h ·|FY
are conditional distributions of
Yt+h , given Yt−1 , Xt−1 and Yt−1 , respectively. Then, Xt−1 is said not to
t−1
Granger cause Yt+h with respect to FY
. Otherwise, X is said to Granger
cause Y, which can be denoted by GXY , where  represents the direction
of causality (White et al. (2011), Dey et al. (2019a, 2020)).
We fit two models where one model includes X and the other does not
include X (base model), and compare their predictive performance to assess
causality of X to Y using an F -test, under the null hypothesis of no explanatory power in X. For univariate cases we compare the following two
models:

If V ar(et ) is significantly lower than V ar(ẽt ), then x contains additional
information that can improve forecasting of y, i.e., Gxy . We can also fit two
linear vector autoregressive (VAR) models, with and without X, respectively,
and evaluate the statistical significance of model coefficients associated with
X.
3.2. Predictive Models
To quantify the forecasting utility of the covariates (X), i.e., COVID19 cases, US county level spread of COVID-19, and Google searches, we
develop predictive models with and without X and compare their predictive
performances. In order to conduct such a comparison, Box-Jenkins (BJ) class
of parametric linear models are commonly used. However, different studies,
e.g., Kane et al. (2014), Dey et al. (2020), show that flexible Random Forest
(RF) models often tend to outperform the BJ models in their predictive
capabilities. We present the comparative analysis based on the RF models.
However, any appropriate forecasting model (e.g., autoregressive integrated
moving average (ARIMA(p, d, q)), can also be used to compare the predictive
performances of the covariates.
A RF model sorts the predictor space into a number of non-overlapping
regions R1 , R2 , · · · , Rm and makes a top-down decision tree. A common dividing technique is recursive binary splitting process, where in each split it
makes two regions R1 = {X|Xj < k} and R2 = {X|Xj ≥ k} by considering all possible predictors Xj s and their corresponding cutpoint k such that
residual sum of squares (RSS) (Eq. 11) becomes the lowest.

RSS =

X

(yi − ŷR1 )2 +

xi ∈R1 (j,k)

X

(yi − ŷR2 )2 ,

xi ∈R2 (j,k)

10

(11)

where ŷR1 and ŷR2 are the mean responses for the training observations in
the region R1 (j, k), and in R2 (j, k), respectively. To improve the predictive
accuracy, instead of fitting a single tree, the RF technique builds a number of decision trees and averages their individual predictions (Hastie et al.
(2001)). RF is a non-linear model (piece-wise linear). Therefore, if there
is any nonlinear causality (Kyrtsou and Labys (2006), Anoruo (2012), Song
and Taamouti (2018)) of X to AP and V , a RF model captures this causality.
We compare the predictive performance of a baseline model (Model P0 ),
which includes only the lagged values of the abnormal price, with other proposed models which additionally include a set of covariates. The covariates
are selected based on their significant correlations and causalities. Table 2
represents a description of the five models we use in our analysis.

RM SE = t(1/n) (yt − yˆt )2 ,
t=1

where yt is the test set of abnormal price (AP ) and yˆt is the corresponding predicted value. We calculate the percentage change in prediction error

(12)

where Ψ(Pi ) and Ψ(P0 ) are the RMSE of model P0 and model Pi , respectively. If ∆ > 0, the covariate (X) is said to improve prediction of Y .
We compare the ∆ for different models, calculated for varying prediction
horizons.
3.3. Analysis of Volatility
We evaluate the utility of COVID-19 cases and deaths, US county level
spread of COVID-19, and Google searches in predicting stock market volatility. Let the conditional mean of log return of S&P 500 price (rt ) be given
as
yt = E(yt |It−1 ) + t ,

(13)

where It−1 is the information set at time t − 1, and t is conditionally
heteroskedastic error. We build two exponential GARCH (EGARCH (p, q))
models, Model 0 and Model X, where Model 0 is a standard EGARCH model
with no explanatory variables, and Model X includes a set of explanatory
variables:

t = σt ηt ,

4. Results
We investigate the effect of COVID-19 public health crisis on the stock
market, in particular, on the S&P 500 index. We primarily focus on the
impact of COVID-19 cases and deaths, local spread, and COVID-19 related
Google searches on S&P 500. Figure 4 shows the movements of abnormal
S&P 500 price and volatility from January 13, 2020 to May 29, 2020. The
top panel illustrates the precipitous drop of S&P 500 price compared to the
movements in prices during the last seven months (Eq. 1). The historic high
volatility (Eq. 2) is depicted in the bottom panel.
We start our analysis with the Spearman’s rank correlation test. We
calculate correlations between the daily abnormal S&P 500 closing price, AP
and the daily COVID-19 cases and deaths, and daily occurrences of higher
order structures in the spread network at different time lags. For example, at
lag 1 we compute correlation of AP at day t with COVID-19 cases and deaths,
and higher order network structures, all at day t − 1. These lag correlations
evaluate the directionality of the relationships. Figure 5a shows the box
plots which combine correlations between each COVID-19 cases and deaths
variable and AP at different lag. Here we build two box plots at each lag:
one for COVID-19 cases and deaths in the US (four variables), and another
for COVID-19 cases and deaths in the World (four variables). Similarly,

1, 2, · · · , 6. However, there is no significant correlation between COVID-19
cases and deaths in the entire world and abnormal S&P 500 (p-value > 0.05)
14

in any lag (see Table 7 in Appendix). We also find that all the local spread
variables are significantly (negative) correlated (p-value < 0.05) with abnormal S&P 500 in every lag = 1, 2, · · · , 6. That is, US county level spread
of COVID-19 adversely affects the price of S&P 500. However, it is anticipated that the strength of correlations of local spread variables will gradually
decrease in higher lags, which is also reflected in Figure 5b. Some of the
COVID-19 related Google searches, e.g., “Covid-19” in US and “Corona” in
world are also significantly correlated (p-value > 0.1) with abnormal S&P
500 in different lags (Table 12 in Appendix).
We also investigate the potential impact of COVID-19 cases and deaths,
its local spread, and related Google searches on S&P 500 price formation
and risk, i.e., volatility. Table 3 and Table 4 present summaries of the
Granger causality tests for predictive utility of COVID-19 cases and deaths,
and county level local spread, respectively. Here the direction of causality is
denoted by .
We find that US total new cases and US total death have significant predictive impacts on price and volatility. US total number of cases have predictive relationship only with volatility in few lags. Among world COVID-19
cases and deaths only total new deaths have causality on price and volatility.
Almost all the local spread variables have predictive impact on price, but
none of them except # Edges at lag 1 have causality on volatility. That is,
county level spread of COVID-19 significantly influence abnormal price formation, but, surprisingly, they do not have causal linkage with the volatility.
Table 10 in Appendix shows that a number of Google search variables have
causality effects on abnormal price. However, only “Coronavirus” US and
“Covid 19” US have predictive impacts on volatility at very few lags. The
price level responds to local spread and to sentiment, whereas the volatility
is mostly affected by national factors.
Now we turn our analysis to compare the predictive performance of models described in Table 2. Table 5 percents prediction errors based on Eq. 12
calculated for varying prediction horizons h = 1, 2, . . . , 6. For short term forecasting horizons (h = 1, 2, and 3) model P3 , which is based on Google search
variables yields more accurate performance. For longer term forecasting horizons (h = 4, 5, and 6), model P2 containing information from local spread
delivers the most competitive results, followed by model P4 , which contains
information from COVID-19 deaths, local spread, and Google searches.
Figure 6 represents a comparison of the observed data with fitted values
from baseline model (model P0 ) and four other models, i.e., model P1 , P2 ,

accuracy followed by model P4 . For 2 day horizon, although it is expected
that the prediction performances of all models deteriorates compare to their
performances for 1 day horizon, model P3 again delivers the best prediction
accuracy.
We now evaluate the influence of COVID-19 cases and deaths, US county
level spread of COVID-19, and Google searches on S&P 500 volatility. A

comparison of the two EGARCH models, Model 0 and Model X (Eq. 15),
including the estimated parameters of the explanatory variables for Model X
are presented in Table 6. All EGARCH coefficients except the constant term
(ω0 ) are statistically significant in both models. However, the coefficients
estimates of all the covariates in Model X are not statistically significant.
We also examine the goodness of fit of the two models by comparing their
log likelihood, Akiake Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information
criterion (BIC). We find that Model 0 tends to describe the S&P 500 volatility
more accurately than the volatility model with covariates, Model X. That is,
COVID-19 cases and deaths, its local spread and Google searches do not
significantly influence the S&P 500 volatility. Figure 7 also suggests that
Model 0 captures the spikes of the price returns more accurately than Model
X.

COVID-19 related factors do not seem to play a role when it comes to
explaining the dynamics of the volatility. One potential explanation for this
is that the movements in the volatility are driven by national-level sentiment
about policy or about policy uncertainty. As a robustness check, we perform
an experiment where we explore the correlations and Granger causality between Google trend searches for macroeconomic policy variables. Because
the data for the COVID-19 spread is available at daily frequency, we use
daily data in all of our specifications. Therefore, we proxy for investor sentiment about policy by using Google Trend searches and the policy uncertainty
index from Baker et al. (2016) rather than higher frequency 30 minute windows around policy announcements as in Cox et al. (2020). The results are
reported in the Appendix. Our results are very similar to the results for
the benchmark specifications with the volatility being affected by national
factors. While sentiment about policy is correlated with abnormal prices, we
18

only find Granger causality in several cases related to fiscal policy searches,
and only at higher lags. On the other hand, sentiment about policy Grangercauses volatility at all lags.
5. Conclusion
The aim of this paper is to evaluate whether COVID-19 cases and deaths,
local spread of COVID-19, and Google search activity explain and predict
US stock market plunge in the spring of 2020.We develop a modeling framework that systematically evaluates the correlation - causality - predictive
utility of each of the COVID-19 related features on stock decline and stock
volatility. In order to quantify local spread of COVID-19 we construct a
temporal spread network and study the dynamics of higher order network
structures as a measure of local spread. We find that COVID-19 cases and
deaths, its local spread, and Google search activities related to COVID-19
have contemporary relationships and predictive abilities on abnormal stock
prices. Our results indicate that COVID-19 cases and deaths, and its local
spread not only unprecedentedly disrupt economic activity and cause a collapse in demand for different goods but also they make investors panic and
increase their anxiety. The anxiety is also reflected in Google search intensity
for COVID-19. These shocks affect investment decisions and the subsequent
stock price dynamics. On the other hand, very few COVID-19 variables have
19

causal relationship on volatility. However, standard EGARCH models for
the volatility show that COVID-19 cases and deaths, its local spread, and
Google search volumes do not have impact on volatility. Different forms for
the volatility measure Molnár (2012), Kim et al. (2019), Bijl et al. (2016)
lead to the same conclusions.
Overall, the volatility is mostly affected by national factors and incorporating higher-order information about local spread does not significantly
improve the forecasting performance of the models. However, the local spread
are significantly linked to abnormal price returns. Furthermore, incorporating information about the local spread significantly improves the predictive
performance of the models for the abnormal price level.
