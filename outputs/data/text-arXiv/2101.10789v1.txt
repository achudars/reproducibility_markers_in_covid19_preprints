The aviation industry is of great importance for a globally connected economy. Customer satisfaction with airlines and airport performance is considerably influenced by how much flights are
delayed. But how should the delay be quantified with thousands of flights for each airport and
airline? Here, we present a statistical analysis of arrival delays at several UK airports between 2018
and 2020. We establish a procedure to compare both mean delay and extreme events among airlines
and airports, identifying a power-law decay of large delays. Furthermore, we note drastic changes
in plane delay statistics during the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, we find that delays are described
by a superposition of simple distributions, leading to a superstatistics.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The aviation industry was a rapidly growing sector until recently, prior to the current COVID-19
pandemic. Economic growth led to higher average yearly distances travelled, as well as higher air
traffic volumes, robustly observed among several regions worldwide until 2019 [1, 2]. But both the
ongoing pandemic [3] and also the push towards more renewable options in aviation [4] may induce
a considerable change in the industry in the future. This makes the industry a very interesting
object to study as it transforms.
As a passenger, an important benchmark for evaluating travel options, e.g. in terms of airports,
airlines or even modes of transportation (train vs plane) is the punctuality of each option. In particular, flight delays severely decrease customer satisfaction and might lead to customers choosing
a different airport or airline, especially if a timely arrival is urgently required [5]. Generally, it
is important to quantitatively understand delay-risks both in terms of the expectation values but
also in terms of the extreme events, i.e. quantifying how likely a very early or very late arrival is.
The study of delays in aviation is already an active field of research. Previous, simple, investigation frameworks to classify and categorize delays have been proposed [6] but mostly relied on mean
values. In other cases, stochastic models of plane delays [7] were developed without considering
the corresponding probability distributions or assuming simple Normal or Poisson distributions [8].
More recent work also includes the application of machine learning techniques to aviation data, e.g.
via recurrent neural networks [9]. One problem of any data-driven approach is that many articles
on aviation research solely rely on proprietary data: In a recent review investigating 200 research
articles, 68% were based on proprietary data [10]. Hence, to enable the broader applicability of
machine learning applications, more publicly available data are still required.
To quantify delay statistics, we will go beyond the oft-used averages of delays [6] and instead
investigate the entire probability density function, as it encodes the full range of delay information,
from highly negative delays (i.e. flights arriving significantly earlier than their scheduled arrival
time) to severely positively delayed flights. To explain the emergence of heavy tails, i.e. extreme
deviations from the mean, we will utilize superstatistical modelling [11]. Such an approach has been
successfully applied in transport before, for modelling train delays [12]; it has also attracted recent
interest when describing fluctuations in the energy system [13] and air pollutant concentrations
[14] and it has been extended to the general framework of diffusing diffusivities in nonequilibrium
statistical physics and biologically inspired physics [15].
In this article, we present new data collected from 2018 to 2020 at several UK airports, with a
particular focus on Heathrow, being the most important international hub in the UK. The data

were publicly available from the arrival information of each airport, given out on their websites each
day but had to be collected and processed for further usage. We analyse the full probability density
of delay distributions and introduce certain performance indices to describe these distributions,
such as the mean delay, the exponential decay rate of negative delays, and the power-law exponent
of large delays. These indices are then compared for the different UK airports and the different
airlines operating at these airports, to understand the main features of the delay statistics in a
more systematic way. Finally, we deal with a theoretical model to explain features of the delay
statistics. We show that the power law of large positive delays can be linked to a superposition
of exponential delays with a varying decay parameter, in a superstatistical approach. On the
contrary, negative delays (early arrivals) do not exhibit any power laws but simply behave in an
exponential way, with extremely early arrivals exponentially unlikely. Throughout this article, we
assume that passengers prefer to arrive as early as possible, i.e. with as little positive and as much
negative delay as possible.

II.

NEW DATA

We collected flight details from a number of different airports. For the purposes of this article,
we have taken into consideration the top five UK airports, in order of passenger traffic [16], namely:
London Heathrow Airport (LHR), London Gatwick Airport (LGW), London Luton Airport (LTN),
London Stansted Airport (STN) and Manchester Airport (MAN). For a period of time lasting
between Autumn 2018 and Spring 2019, we collected a combined total of approximately twohundred and twenty thousand (2.2 × 105 ) flight-arrivals from all five airports mentioned above.
Furthermore, we continued collecting flight-information from London Heathrow during the 2020
COVID-19 pandemic, to illustrate the effect the lockdown had on the delay distribution. For each
flight, we recorded the airline company operating the flight along with the corresponding flight
number, departure and arrival airports, as well as scheduled and actual landing times. The delay
is then computed simply as the difference between an aircraft’s scheduled arrival time and its actual
arrival time. We made all collected data publicly available. For details of the data processing and
availability, see Methods.
The main body of our data (about 85%) is sourced from London Heathrow, making it the chief
focus of our analysis simply due to its size. London Heathrow is an international airport operating
flights of 80 different airlines in total, which fly to 84 different countries around the world, as of 2019
[16]. Of course, in addition there are domestic flights within the UK. The passenger nationalities
are 48% European and UK and 52% from the rest of the world. It is the busiest airport in Europe
by passenger traffic [16].
The empirical probability density function (PDF) of all delays is a key characteristic to monitor,
see Fig. 1 for all Heathrow delays. There, we compare the data collected from 2018 to 2019 with
more recent data collected during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic (during the first lockdown in
Spring to Summer 2020), which led to a drastic reduction in air transport [17, 18]. There are
two interesting observations: Firstly, the delay statistics under COVID-19 are shifted to the left,
indicating overall smaller delays (including more negative delays); secondly, the general shape of
the distribution does not change drastically. In particular, we observe a fast decay of the PDF of
negative delays on the left side and a much slower decay of the PDF on the right side for positive
delays. In the following sections, we will analyse this behaviour in much more detail.

III.

QUANTIFYING DELAY STATISTICS

Starting from a histogram of the flight delays, we derive three indices/measures to quantify flight
delay distributions: Mean delay, exponent of left exponential and power-law exponent of right qexponential, as explained below in detail. We will use the LHR data previous to any COVID-19
influence as our main example.

FIG. 1. Flight delays follow a broad distribution with large negative and positive delays. We display LHR
delay histograms prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic, both normalized. As the COVID-19 LHR
data set is significantly smaller in size, compared to the regular LHR data set, it contains many gaps,
where no data were recorded. The COVID-19 data set is significantly shifted towards the left (smaller
delays) as compared to the pre-pandemic time.

As a first step, we split the full histogram at its peak value into two histograms, a left flank of
dominantly negative delays and a right flank of dominantly positive delays, see Fig. 2. Based on the
shape of the empirical distributions, we use exponentials and q-exponentials as fitting functions,
see also Methods for details.
The left flank is observed to be well approximated by an exponential function of the form
p(tL ; λ) = λe−λtL , λ > 0,

(1)

where tL are the normalized arrival delays on the left flank, see Methods for details. The exponent
λ here quantifies the exponential decay of the probability of early arrivals. Therefore, a large λ
implies that few flights arrive very early while a small λ indicates that very large negative delays
are observed. Hence, typically, we assume a small λ to be desirable.
The right flank of the delay distribution obeys a power law, i.e. a slow decay of p ∼ tν , with
ν negative. To quantitatively describe the right flank, we use a q-exponential function [19] of the
form
1

p(tR ; q, λq ) = (2 − q)λq [1 + (q − 1)λq tR ] 1−q ,

(2)

where tR are the normalized arrival delays on the right flank, see Methods for details. The powerlaw exponent, i.e., the rate at which the probability density decays for high (positive) delay values,
is given by ν := 1/(1 − q), 1 < q < 2. Note that the scale parameter λq > 0 is relevant for
the precise fit but will not be used as a delay index as its influence on the delay distribution is
limited. Contrary to the left-flank exponential decay, the absolute values of the right-flank power
law exponent ν should be as large as possible. Large (absolute) values of ν imply a rapid decay of
positive delays, i.e. fewer extreme events of very delayed arrivals.
Finally, we note that the two flanks describe the tails of the distribution well but overestimate
the peak, i.e. the most likely value, see Fig. 3. Hence, we complement the two previous fits by
using the mean delay µ as a third index. Since we assume that passengers wish to arrive as early as

possible, the mean µ should be as small (or as negative) as possible. In the case of LHR, the three
delay indices that we introduced are λ = 0.131, µ = −5.06 and ν = −5.371. We also introduce a
continuous smooth fitting function for the full range in Section VI.
Note that the mean value µ can be easily manipulated by airline companies by scheduling flight
arrival times later then actually needed, hence always causing a negative mean delay, which may
artificially improve their performance. On the contrary, the tail behavior truthfully represents the
extreme event statistics for both positive and negative delays and cannot be easily manipulated
by the operators.

COMPARISON OF AIRPORTS AND AIRLINES

We here use the previously developed framework to quantify and compare delay statistics for
different airlines and airports. Intuitively, we expect that long-distance flights would, on average,
yield more extreme early or late arrivals, compared to the corresponding short-distance ones. Thus,
we distinguish between short-distance airlines, covering mostly domestic and European destinations, and airlines that include long-distance, international destinations, as well as destinations
within Europe. We first compute the three indices λ, µ, ν for each of those airline groups and then
compare full airport statistics, aggregating all airlines.
There are several factors impacting the delay distribution for each airport or airline: Airline
policies, flight routes, technical defects or issues with documentation contribute to 27% of all delays
[20]. Specifically, overseas flights are more sensitive to wind (head wind or tail wind), as well as
unstable weather conditions (storms, fog) and military exercises. Airlines operating international
flights, as illustrated in Fig. 4, exhibit considerable variations in their flight delay indices. Note
that while a low left exponent λ may be regarded as a desirable property (flights often arrive
very early), the mean µ and the right exponent ν should definitely be as small as possible (low
mean delay and few very late arrivals). Since both quantities tend to be negative, their absolute
values should be large. Comparing the airlines, we observe a “grouping” behaviour for some of the
carriers. On the one hand, airlines having a blend between short-distance (e.g. domestic or EU)
and overseas destinations, such as Iberia, British Airways (BA), Aer Lingus and Finnair, appear
to follow a similar trend for each index. On the other hand, airlines that do not possess such a
spread of destinations tend to perform well only in some of the indices. As an illustrative example
we choose Air Canada and United Airlines: Although both their left and right exponents are in a
similar range to the other airlines, their mean delays are substantially less negative than those of
their competitors.
Characterization of short-distance flights shows a strong grouping of the delay behavior for
some airlines. As seen in Fig. 5, comparison of five of the largest low-cost domestic and European
providers, reveals a systematic similarity between Wizz Air, easyJet and Ryanair. All three airlines
manage to perform well in the left exponent metric, minimizing early arrivals, while they maintain
an acceptable negative average delay (with easyJet performing worst here). Again, they follow a

similar right-exponent trend, translated to a certain number of overall late arrivals. Furthermore,
Jet2 outperforms all other short-distance airlines in λ left-exponents and mean delays. Finally,
Vueling resembles Wizz Air and Ryanair values in the λ and µ metrics but seems to have less late
arrivals as per its high right exponent ν.
Comparing the long distance airlines with the short-distance ones, we notice some differences:
Airlines covering long distances tend to display lower (more desirable) left exponents as well as
higher negative mean delays. Meanwhile, the right exponent behavior is similar between the two
groups with Vueling and Qatar Airlines as the ”outliers” in their respective category. Whether
this behavior is due to company policies or flight distance remains a question for future research.
Studying the indices for individual airports yields interesting insights as well. Airports populated
by airlines flying mainly to domestic and EU destinations, such as LTN and STN, score fairly well
in both early and late arrivals, with an approximately net zero mean delay, see Fig. 6. On the one
hand, STN is characterized by the minimum λ value, showing the best performance in early arrivals
in the group of airports, while LTN attains an acceptable value. On the other hand, it can be
seen that LTN scores the second best ν value while STN lies very slightly above the median group
ν. Interestingly, mean delays at MAN airport are net positive, contrary to LHR and GAT where
arrivals are scheduled in such a way that the mean delay is negative. Furthermore, MAN seems to
not perform that well in the early arrivals index, having the worst score, but does outperform all
the rest of the airports when compared under the extreme positive delays. International airports
such as LHR and GAT (with the exception of LHR COVID-19) tend to cluster around similar
values for all delay indices.
LHR during the COVID-19 pandemic outperforms all airports on the mean delay index by a large
margin. The reason behind this is that the dramatic reduction of flight traffic worldwide saw many
flights arriving too early. Interestingly, the left exponent, i.e. the decay of early arrivals, did not
change substantially, compared to business-as-usual since the shape of the delay distribution on the
left did not change much but was only shifted to more negative values. The right flank behaves quite
differently: Both business-as-usual and LHR during the COVID-19 pandemic, recorded heavily
delayed flights, which arrived more than 3 hours late (see also Fig. 1). The right index reveals
the likelihood of these extreme events. In the case of LHR under COVID-19, the low mean delay
suggests early arrival but the extreme events are still present and hence the right exponent reveals
this poor performance.

SUPERSTATISTICAL MODELLING OF DELAYS

As we have seen previously, the right flank of the delay statistics exhibits heavy tails and is
well-described by a q-exponential. Let us now explore a potential explanation for this particular
distribution by employing the framework of superstatistics [11, 21, 22]. Superstatistics is relevant
when an aggregated system (e.g. a long time series) displays heavy tails, but the system may then
be disentangled into many smaller sub-parts (e.g. short time periods of the trajectory). These
sub-parts then are no longer heavy-tailed but follow a simple local distribution, for example an
exponential or a Gaussian. This idea has been successfully applied, for example, to train delays
[12], electric power systems [13] and intermittent wind statistics [23].
Assuming for now that the right-flank delays are indeed q-exponentially distributed and follow a
superstatistics, we should be able to observe “local” exponential densities, with a decay parameter
λ. Superimposing all these λ, we get a q-exponential if the λ themselves follow a χ2 -distribution:

Γ 2
Here n denotes the number of degrees of freedom characterizing the fluctuations in λ and λ0 is
the sample mean of λ. Indeed, choosing an adequate time scale to separate the trajectory (see
next paragraph), the heavy tails of delay distributions vanish and instead the distributions are well
described by simple exponential functions, see Fig. 7.
Let us explain how to extract the relevant time scale T on which we locally observe exponential
distributions. Since we know that an exponential distribution has a kurtosis of κexponential = 9, we
test time windows of different size ∆τ and compute the local average kurtosis [11] as

where τmax is the length of the time series u and ū is the mean of the time series. We denote by
h. . . iτ0 ,∆τ the expectation formed for a time slice of length ∆τ starting at τ0 . For the LHR data,
we show how to determine the long time scale T in Fig. 8.
Next, let us carry out an important consistency check: As explained above, the mixing of
numerous local exponential distributions with exponents following a χ2 -distribution leads to a

q-exponential. Now, we can make a histogram of the λ-distribution and fit it with a χ2 - and
an inverse χ2 -distribution. Next, we derive the q-exponential from the fitted χ2 -distribution and
compare it with the direct fit of the q-exponential and the original data. This is illustrated in
Fig. 9.
We note that the empirical λ-distribution is slightly better fitted by an inverse χ2 - than a
2
χ -distribution, as also observed in other application areas [14, 24]. Overall, the superstatistical
description seems consistent, given the short time series of flight delays under consideration. The qexponential derived from the χ2 tends overestimate the PDF at low values, which is understandable
as we also exclude them for the fitting of the q-exponential via MLE (see methods). Still, the tail
behavior of the q-exponential based on the χ2 matches the real data and the MLE fit nicely.
This means the observed power laws of the right flank are essentially explained by a suitable
superstatistics which describes changes in the microvariables on a time scale of T ≈ 1.5 hours.
VI.

CONNECTING THE FLANKS

So far, we focused our attention on describing and fitting the tail aspects of the distribution,
namely the left, approximately exponential, flank and the right, approximately q-exponential,
flank. Both these functions combined overestimate the peak of the distribution and hence, we also
included the mean delay as the final metric in our framework. Now, let us consider how the two
tail distributions could be merged in one smooth-fitting function.
First, we note that the so far mostly ignored central part of the delay distribution might be
approximated by a Gaussian distribution, based on the parabola shape in the log-scale plots. We
use this insight to propose the following continuous fitting function

the previously derived χ2 distribution, we again derive a q-exponential with right exponent νχ2 ≈ −5.296,
compared to the fitted one of νMLE ≈ −5.371. Hence, while the low delays are not perfectly matched by
the χ2 -based q-exponential, the tail behavior is decently captured.

with expq (t) = (2 − q)λq [1 + (q − 1)λq t] 1−q being the q-exponential function. Here, Ae and Aq are
amplitudes, C is a curvature parameter, describing the approximately Gaussian part in the center,
tpeak is the delay at the peak of the delay distribution, where we split into left and right flank and
t are the delay values, see Methods for fitting details.
The resulting fit is a smooth function, covering the full delay range, see Fig. 10. Since the new
curvature parameter C also influences the general shape, the new values for q and λ, now named
q̃ and λ̃, are slightly different from the ones solely focusing on the tails (empirically we tend to
observe a slight reduction in λ and increase in q). Still, the general observations using the delay
indices and comparing airlines, such as in Figs. 4-6, remain mostly unchanged. Equation (5)
provides an alternative approach to the three delay indices introduced so far. If one is interested
in describing the full distribution as accurately as possible, we recommend using equation(5).
Meanwhile, to compare performance of individual airlines or to obtain a general impression of the
delay distribution, the three delay indices are a simplified framework, allowing easy and robust
estimation and comparison. Finally, note that the full curve is not strictly a probability density
function as we did not enforce that its integral equals one. While theoretically making it easier by
reducing the number of parameters, that would make the fitting more difficult in practice as the
integrals cannot be evaluated analytically by hand but only impose additional constraints during

10
the fitting. Also note that our observed flight delays live on the finite interval [-100,210], whereas
the fitting function is defined on [−∞, ∞], which makes the normalization outside the interval
ambiguous.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

In summary, we have analysed a newly obtained data set of plane delays for various British
airports, which contains tens of thousands of flights, aggregated over multiple months. This is a
substantial improvement to some earlier studies which only investigated a few days of measurements and a couple of thousand flights, thereby greatly underestimating the contribution of the
tails to the probability distribution [25]. Interestingly, we find that all investigated airports and
even individual airlines at each airport follow a qualitatively similar distribution, namely an approximately exponential decay on the left flank (of negative delays) and a slowly decaying power
law on the right flank (of positive delays). To characterize these distributions and systematically
compare airlines and airports, we have developed a framework to quantify delay performance.
Critically, we do not only use the mean delay but also consider extreme events of both positive
and negative delays via their respective flanks in the empirical probability distribution. Applying
this newly developed framework, we find substantial differences between airlines serving short and
long-distance routes.
We offer an explanation for the emerging power law on the right flank via superstatistics: The
local q-exponential distribution with its heavy tails seems to arise from many superimposed exponential distributions. In particular, we identify the long time scale T as approximately 1.5 hours,
during which delays fall off exponentially. Comparing to other superstatistical results [21, 22], we
note the relevance of both χ2 -distributions and inverse-χ2 -distributions for the scale parameter,
similar to the ones observed in air pollution or cancer [14, 24], stressing again the universality
of superstatistics. Finally, we propose a continuous function to capture the full delay statistics.
While this introduces additional parameters and the superstatistical theory mentioned previously
is no longer applicable, this fit does describe the full distribution with high accuracy.
Our framework of three delay indices to characterize flight delay distributions can be applied
quite generally to measure the punctuality of flights, going beyond an analysis based on just the
mean. Crucially, while airlines or airports might be able to “game” the system of mean delays,
this is not possible with the left and right exponents. Companies could shift their flight schedule,
i.e. announcing intentionally that flights will take longer than they do in practice, and thereby

11
systematically record early arrivals so pushing their mean delay to negative values. However, such
a procedure would still leave the remaining two indices (left and right exponent) untouched so that
they provide a stable way of measuring performance.
One remarkable result is the impact of the global pandemic of COVID-19 on the delay statistics. Heathrow (LHR) under COVID-19 conditions (travel restrictions, quarantine upon arrival
etc) displays an impressively low mean delay, while the left flank decay was mostly unchanged.
Interestingly, LHR still experienced some heavily delayed flights during the COVID-19 pandemic,
which leads to pronounced heavy tails towards the right and thereby a poor performance in the
right exponent. These observations demonstrate that given fewer flights, the existing infrastructure
is able to perform much better in some aspects (mean) than under “business-as-usual” conditions,
while others (extreme delays) still can be improved. Aside from the upsides of COVID-19-related
lockdown measures on air quality [26, 27] or CO2 emissions [28], we find that having fewer flights
also improves delay statistics.
We have assumed throughout this article that negative delays are preferred by all passengers.
However, some passengers might value arrival at exactly the predicted time more highly than
arriving early. This would change the interpretation of the left index slightly: Instead of desiring
low exponents, airlines and airports should aim for high exponents. Similarly, the absolute value
of the delay should be zero, i.e. the arrival on time should be the default. Regardless of preference,
the indices, as introduced, provide a sufficient framework to measure the delay performance.
In the future, we would like to apply our framework to delay statistics at other airports in
different countries, and investigate how delays are related to geographical distance of the flights.
In particular it would be interesting to see how our three indices differ between years, countries
and so on. From a more fundamental perspective, we aim to further understand correlations
in the flight delays. Preliminary indications from the British data are that on “typical” days
correlations decay quickly but on some “exceptional” days (perhaps those where external factors
affect many flights) the autocorrelation function can settle on a non-zero value for some time and
many flights have long delays which contribute to the tail of the probability density function.
Long-range temporal correlations and memory effects have been studied in many other physical
and non-physical systems [29, 30]; modelling such effects here is challenging, since the build-up of
delays at one airport may be influenced by earlier flights to and from completely different airports,
but practically important since controlling the “cascading” of delays would lead to a significantly
improved passenger experience.

METHODS
Data processing

As we mentioned in the main text, for each flight, we recorded the airline company operating
the flight, the flight number, the departure and arrival airports as well as the scheduled and actual
landing times. The data was cleaned and organized according to the delay, computed as the
difference between scheduled arrival time and actual arrival time for each flight. We kept data
for each arrival airport as well as a summary of the overall delays, independent of the arrival
airport. A “negative” delay occurs when the actual aircraft arrival is earlier than the expected
one, according to the scheduled timetable. After examining the data it became evident that a
reasonable cut-off point as to how early or late an aircraft can arrive at the designated airport
should be implemented. This prevents over-representation of individual extreme events in the
resulting probability distributions. We decided that the delays (in minutes) would have to be
contained in the interval [−100, 210].
Theoretical distribution fitting

Here we explain the fitting procedure in more detail. We approximate the empirical distribution
of the left flank, where negative delays are dominant, with an exponential distribution of the form
p(tL ; λ) = λe−λtL , λ > 0.

(6)

As we have seen earlier, the observed distribution curves towards a Gaussian distribution around
the peak value and thereby deviates from an exponential distribution. Hence, we restrict our
fitting to values deviating from the central area as follows. Let tpeak be the delay at which the
distribution reaches its highest PDF value and tmin the smallest delay we observe. Then, we
restrict our exponential fit to any delay falling in the interval [tmin , tpeak − 0.3|tmin − tpeak |], where
|...| indicates the absolute value. Following this restriction, we define the left flank delay values as
tL = −t + tpeak − 0.3|tmin − tpeak |, t ∈ [tmin , tpeak − 0.3|tmin − tpeak |].

(7)

We now turn to the right flank of the empirical distribution, i.e. the data set that constitutes
the majority of the positive delays. The q-exponential is much better at incorporating parts of the
Gaussian central distribution on the right-hand side than the exponential distribution is on the
left flank. Hence, we only exclude the smallest 10% of the data, i.e. we consider delays t in the
interval interval [tpeak + 0.1|tmax − tpeak |, tmax ], where tmax is the highest delay observed. Hence
the right-flank delays to be fitted are defined as
tR = t − tpeak − 0.1|tmax − tpeak |, t ∈ [[tpeak + 0.1|tmax − tpeak |, tmax ].

(8)

Our theoretical distribution choice is now a q-exponential
1

p(tR ; q, λq ) = (2 − q)λq [1 + (q − 1)λq tR ] 1−q ,

(9)

with parameters λq and q.
Note that both tL and tR are defined such that they start at 0 and continue towards positive
values to keep the fitting functions easier.
These two functions (exponential and q-exponential) are fitted to the data using a maximum
likelihood estimate (MLE), i.e. maximizing the Likelihood L(θ, x). Here, x indicates the data we
wish to fit and θ the set of parameters that are being optimized. The likelihood of a parameter
setting θ on a given one-dimensional data set x = x1 , x2 , ..., xN is computed as
L(θ, x) =

i=1

p(xi , θ),

with probability density function p(xi , θ), dependent on the parameters θ. Technically, we carry
out the MLE using the scipy.stats module in python with custom PDFs, see also Code availability
(below) for a link to the code.

Fitting the smooth combined function

To obtain a smooth fit, combining both flanks, we employ the following procedure. We first
estimate the exponential decay rate λ based on the lowest 70% of negative delays, then estimate
q and the q-exponential decay rate λq based on almost the full right-hand side of the histogram.
This is identical to the procedure for the individual flanking fits. Next, we estimate the central
curvature C, which we assume to be identical for both intervals, and the amplitudes Ae and Aq ,
as well as λq using least squares fitting. While carrying out this least-square fit, we also allow
the parameters q and λ to vary up to 10% from the MLE-optimal value determined earlier. The
reason to allow any variance is to ensure a continuous fit and we want to keep the change from the
optimal MLE parameters small, hence, we restrict it to 10%. Technically, we use the scipy.stats
module to perform the MLE fits and the least square fit; continuity is ensured using constraints in
the symfit package.

Airline data

In Figs. 4 and 5 we compared several airlines. Let us briefly list how many flights we analysed
to derive our delay indices: For the short-distance airlines ’Wizz Air’: 2428, ’easyJet’: 15449,
’Ryanair’: 13488, ’Vueling’: 1034, ’Jet2’: 1215 and for the other airlines we have ’Iberia’: 12892,
’British Airways’: 38257, ’Aer Lingus’: 7331, ’Finnair’: 8560, ’American Airlines’: 23119, ’Air
Canada’: 7247, ’United Airlines’: 6797, ’Japan Airlines’: 5966, ’Qatar Airways’: 5935. For all
airlines we have at least 1000 flights and often several thousand flights.
