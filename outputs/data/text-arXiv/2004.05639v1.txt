Introduction

With the purpose of predicting the evolution of infectious diseases under uncertainty or lowquality information, just as happened in the initial scenario during the spread of CoVid-19 in
China and Europe, a new model has been presented in [1]. To achieve this goal, the model
implements the following four key characteristics:
1. It keeps track of the date of infection of a single individual.
2. It uses stochastic distributions to aggregate individuals who share the same date of
infection.
3. It uses two types of infections: mild and serious.
4. It keeps track of the number of Carriers, Infections and Recoveries.
The kernel of the presented model consists of four differential equations: two for Infections
and two for Recoveries. This kernel is complemented with additional differential equations,
one for each sanitary event to be predicted: among others, deaths and demands of ICUs or
mechanical ventilators under different restraint policies.
Since there are new data available, this paper revises the model and the prediction made in
[1] using the new data reported by reference [2] and incorporating also data from reference
[3].
The calculations in this work are made with the only purpose of assessing the model: input
parameters may require further study and predicted results might suffer changes. However,
it is anticipated that the proposed predictive model holds good agreement with reported data.

Differential equations

The kernel of the proposed model, detailed in reference [1], is condensed as follows

In these equations, subindex 𝑖𝑖 indicates the type of infection (in this case, 1=mild, 2=serious);
𝐶𝐶 is the number of carrirers, 𝐼𝐼 is the number of infections and 𝑅𝑅 is the number of recoveries;
finally, 𝑃𝑃, 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 , 𝜔𝜔�, 𝛾𝛾 and 𝜙𝜙𝑖𝑖 are model constants which can be selected to model different
scenarios or restriction policies.

are added to the contagion path: this fact can be considered by increasing the value
of 𝑃𝑃 at any time.
𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 is the proportion of carriers of type 𝑖𝑖 who are isolated (at home or hospital) and
cannot propagate the virus: the carriers propagating the virus are ∑𝑖𝑖(1 − 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 )(𝑡𝑡) with
� and 𝛼𝛼 =
0 ≤ 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 ≤ 1. When there are two types, it is possible to define 𝜔𝜔 = (1 − 𝛼𝛼1 )𝜔𝜔
(𝛼𝛼2 − 𝛼𝛼1 )/(1 − 𝛼𝛼1 ), which are the parameters proposed in [1]. It is convenient to clear
𝛼𝛼1 = (𝛼𝛼2 − 𝛼𝛼)/(1 − 𝛼𝛼) and 𝛼𝛼2 = 𝛼𝛼1 + 𝛼𝛼(1 − 𝛼𝛼1 ) to find that −∞ < −𝛼𝛼1 (1 − 𝛼𝛼1 )−1 ≤ 𝛼𝛼 ≤
𝛼𝛼2 ≤ 1. When 𝛼𝛼 ≤ 0, 𝛼𝛼2 ≤ 𝛼𝛼1 holds, that is, type-1 (mild) infections are more isolated
than type-2 (serious) infections and/or that serious infections are more contagious
than mild ones. As long as these parameters are obtained by means of a fitting
algorithm, only two parameters are needed: 𝜔𝜔 and 𝛼𝛼 (instead of 𝜔𝜔�, 𝛼𝛼1 and 𝛼𝛼2 ).
𝜔𝜔
� is the number of persons that an average non-isolated carrier finds per day. As said,
for fitting purposes, it is better to use 𝜔𝜔 = (1 − 𝛼𝛼1 )𝜔𝜔�, which is the number of persons
that an average carrier finds per day. It takes into account how people move and
come closer.
𝛾𝛾 is the contagion success. It measures how many persons in a healthy group become
infected when keeping in physical proximity with an infected person. It takes into
account the efficiency of the transmission channel: the use of masks, for example,
will reduce this number.
𝜙𝜙𝑖𝑖 is the fraction of infections generated of type 𝑖𝑖 . In a group of new infected people,
it measures how many of them will be of each type. For two types, 𝜙𝜙2 = 1 − 𝜙𝜙1 = 𝜙𝜙𝑟𝑟
is the fraction at risk.
ℎ(∆𝑡𝑡, 𝜇𝜇𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅 ) is the stochastic distribution for each event and it is described in [1], where
preliminary values were assumed as a first attempt. So far, it has not been necessary
to change or improve it.

The model is completed with the differential equations associated to the medical events (first
symptoms, ICU admission, discharging, death, etc.). In general, these equations are of the
following form
𝑡𝑡
𝑡𝑡 𝑑𝑑𝑋𝑋 (𝑡𝑡 − ∆𝑡𝑡)
𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑(𝑡𝑡)

In these equations, 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼(𝑡𝑡) is the number of people which is an input for the service 𝐻𝐻, 𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂(𝑡𝑡)
is the number which is an output for the service 𝐻𝐻 and 𝐻𝐻(𝑡𝑡) is the people who are using the
service 𝐻𝐻. The function 𝑋𝑋𝑗𝑗 denotes one of the previous calculated functions: 𝑋𝑋 ∈ {𝐶𝐶, 𝐼𝐼, 𝑅𝑅} and
𝑗𝑗 ∈ {1,2}. In reference [1] it was assumed that only type-2 carriers (𝑋𝑋 = 𝐼𝐼 and 𝑗𝑗 = 2) become
users of the medical service and the same is assumed here, 𝑋𝑋 = 𝐼𝐼 and 𝑗𝑗 = 2. In addition,
following [1], deaths are a constant fraction 𝑡𝑡𝐷𝐷 of the people leaving the hospital, so that

Previous results

Reference [1] studied three different initial dates and shown that, as expected, the longer the
time available for viral spreading, the greater the exposed population. Moving the date from
February 5th to January 25th (eleven days) increases the susceptible population from 0.129
million to 13.8 million: a change of two orders of magnitude! This fact gives a tremendous
importance to the date of the first infection because it fixes the number of immune people,
which is crucial to determine the contagion spreading after removing the mobility
restrictions. Without knowing the number of people who have passed the infection, that is,
without testing the population to determine the fraction who has developed immunity, this
number cannot be definitely established, it can only be guessed. The work in reference [1]
stated the plausible initial date as February 3rd (please, note that this is a plausible date, not a
fact). This plausible scenario is drawn again in Figure 1, where the new available data has
been added. The figure shows that the trend is good although the real data is rising above
the estimation. Next sections discuss this situation.

Comparison with new real data

Real data in the previous work was obtained from reference [2], which has the advantage of
reporting the death rate every day since the beginning. Although they use official data they
are not official; the official data comes from the Spanish government [3]. However, reference
[3] does not give the death rate, that is, the number of deaths per day, but reports, without
stating when the death happened, the accumulated deaths until such date. Thus, as reference
[3] advises: death rates cannot be directly extracted from the given data and anybody who
will use it for such purpose will do so at their own risk. In addition, the first 28 deaths are all
accumulated on March 8th, which reduces the information available for estimating the
trending slope during the first days. Figure 2 shows the difference between both sets of data
(reference [3] minus reference [1]).

Death rate difference

As can be seen, on April 11th there exists a difference of 366 deaths but the difference was
as high as 616 deaths on April 1st: reference [2] has a delay reporting the deaths. This partially
explains why the real data is going above the calculated curve in figure 1: as long as reference
[2] reports less deaths, the parameters fitted by [1] slightly underestimate the data reported
by [3]. This can be seen in figure 3.
Figure 3 shows the real data from reference [3] where the lack of data during the first days
appears. This lack of data contributes to make less accurate the determination of the plausible
initial date. However, the rising of deaths at the end is significantly high. As said, a partial
explanation comes from the difference between the deaths reported by references [3] and [2]
but there must exist another reason. Three plausible reasons could be argued:
1. The proposed mathematical model does not properly describe the propagation.
2. There exists a significant delay reporting the deaths: there are deaths reported on one
date which happened on a previous one.
3. There exists an increment of the available population: for some reason, areas of
population which were hidden to the contagion are suddenly connected to the
infectious path.

Option 1 is discarded since the model has been written to avoid this possibility: an effort was
made to incorporate all the major effects; only minor effects could be added, and they would
not change significantly the results. Option 2 cannot be checked and hence it is also
discarded. Option 3 could be plausible since on March 8th there were many demonstrations
that could have spread the virus to isolated regions. Next section re-adjusts the model
parameters to incorporate this possibility.

New fitting

The data from reference [3] has been used to re-estimate the model parameters. This fitting
has been made for three plausible initial dates, February 3rd, February 5th and February 7th.
The restriction of movements imposed by the government is described with a reduction of
𝜔𝜔 in such a way that after March 15th, one day after its official publication, 𝜔𝜔 is divided by 𝑟𝑟1
(reference [1] used 𝑟𝑟1 = 10). On April 3rd the restriction was tightened (following the new
regulations imposed by the government on April 2nd) dividing 𝜔𝜔 by 𝑟𝑟2 >𝑟𝑟1 .
The effect of increasing the available population which is susceptible to contagion is
incorporated using two values of 𝑃𝑃: 𝑃𝑃1 before March 9th and 𝑃𝑃2 after March 8th.

The values of the parameters 𝑃𝑃1 , 𝑃𝑃2 , 𝛼𝛼, 𝜔𝜔, 𝑟𝑟1 , 𝑟𝑟2 and 𝜙𝜙2 which minimize the logarithmic error
are collected in Table 1. The rest of the parameters remain equal to those estimated by
reference [1].
As long as the number of available empirical data is greater, the logarithmic error is also
larger, near 4.2 for the three cases (the error in [1] was near 2.1). The differences in the error
obtained in the three cases are less than 0.5%, what makes very difficult to use this error to
determine the initial date.

As can be seen, the change of ±2 days in the initial date produces a change in the susceptible
population of several millions, from 3.11 (February 7th) to 48.8 (February 3rd). As discussed
in [1], the parameter 𝜙𝜙2 suffers similar changes, from 0.236 to 0.0016. This is a severe change
respect to the value 0.167 estimated in reference [1]. The rest of parameters have not
significantly changed with respect to those of reference [1]: 𝜔𝜔 has increased and
𝑟𝑟1 decreased.

In the three cases, the fitting algorithm has increased the susceptible population from 1.4
million to 3.1 million using February 7th as the initial date and from 21.1 million to 48.8
million using February 3rd as the initial date. Again, without testing the population it is
difficult to infer the people who have developed immunity and hence the initial date has to
be indirectly determined. In this case, as long as February 7th leads to a value of 𝜙𝜙2 closer to
the plausible limits which reference [1] estimated, it seems a more plausible initial date than
February 3rd. This fixes, as a plausible option, 3 million people who have passed the infection
and 20 thousand final deaths.
Next figures show the calculated curves for the three initial dates. It is interesting to compare
them with the calculation on figure 3. One of the changes is the lower slope that the death
rate curve has after its maximum. The other effect is the higher duration of the decay, which
is near one week longer.

Again, it has been shown that the main source of uncertainty is the initial date or,
equivalently, the fraction at risk. Plausible values for both parameters have been used in this
article but it is important to remark that, according to the presented model and to the
available information, they are only plausible values. With these values, the model have
shown its ability to theoretically describe the death rate in Spain. The punctual increment of
the susceptible population (obtained by fitting) keeps the results close to the actual data: no
other actions have been necessary. So far, the proposed differential equations hold and the
input parameters are still meaningful. However, further study is still necessary to assess the
potential of the new model.
