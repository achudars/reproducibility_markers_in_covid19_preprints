Abstract
Behavioral responses to pandemics are less shaped by actual mortality or hospitalization risks
than they are by risk attitudes. We explore human mobility patterns as a measure of
behavioral responses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results indicate that risk-taking
attitude is a critical factor in predicting reduction in human mobility and increase social
confinement around the globe. We find that the sharp decline in movement after the WHO
(World Health Organization) declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic can be attributed to risk
attitudes. Our results suggest that regions with risk-averse attitudes are more likely to adjust
their behavioral activity in response to the declaration of a pandemic even before most
official government lockdowns. Further understanding of the basis of responses to epidemics,
e.g., precautionary behavior, will help improve the containment of the spread of the virus.

In Thackeray’s novel Henry Esmond, for instance, this dread informs the narrative. The heroine, Lady
Castlewood, contracts the disease as an adult. Her husband had been a brave soldier in combat, but
he was unable to face a malady that he could not fight and that threatened him not only with death,
but also with disfigurement. Unwilling to put his pink complexion and his fair hair at risk, Lord
Castlewood took to his heels and deserted his household for the duration of the outbreak. But he was
not part of a mass exodus, even though Henry Esmond declares that smallpox was “that dreadful
scourge of the world” and a “withering blight” and “pestilence” that “would enter a village and
destroy half its inhabitants.”

The central features of modern global society make us more vulnerable to the challenge of
pandemic diseases and their global implications, as viral transmission can trigger large-scale
responses (1)1. Epidemics such as COVID-19 threaten our social fabric (2), thus it is
important to understand such occurrences from a risk behavior perspective. Scholars have
emphasized how social and behavioral sciences can offer important insights into how the
COVID-19 pandemic may be understood and managed (3). Risk behavior has been
predominately analyzed in relation to the HIV/AIDS pandemic (4,5). Studies have also tried
to model the effects of risk perception on the spreading of an epidemic (6), and have explored
how different levels of awareness may help to prevent an outbreak (7). Other studies have
explored the implications of risk attitudes in disasters (8–10) or extreme situations (11).
Risk-taking attitudes and behavior are important elements of human behavior as they
determine a range of decision-making strategies (12) and contribute to navigation of the
complexity, uncertainty, and dangerous world where risk looms large. For example, research
has shown that risk aversion can result in the over-weighting of risk factors and risk-seeking
can result in the under-weighting of risk (13–17). Advanced civilizations dating back to the
Asipu in Mesopotamia in 3200 B.C. had risk management strategies in place to estimate
profits/losses or successes/failures ((18) discussed in (19)). Another early example of risk
analysis and risk management is the Code of Hammurabi2 issued in 1950 B.C. (19). Our
cognitive apparatus has equipped us evolutionarily to survive our daily activities (20), while
enduring and recurring risks in the environment have required evolutionary adaptiveness as a
core selective factor of survival (21). The implication is that we must remain safe to

In the Middle Ages, for example, monasteries were vulnerable to plagues. Their status as central hubs meant
they acted as nodes in the grain trade; linking villages and settlements together, and attracting a substantial
community of people who lived close by. In addition, monasteries served as a place of refuge (1, p. 42).

guarantee our survival. It is no coincidence that we are all well aware of the proverb “Better
safe than sorry”.
Risk entails a complete probabilistic knowledge of something occurring, which allows
a decision regarding what action to take. However, not only are we boundedly rational human
beings (22) subject to emotions (23) such as fear, but the complexity of the environment and
situation, the limited available information on contextual factors of other humans, or dynamic
changes may not allow us to have a clear idea about the actual probability we face3. In
addition, calculating the probability of risk is not the same as actually perceiving it, and
humans use less accurate heuristics to make judgments that also include perception of risk.
Our biases often disrupt our risk assessments in both positive and negative ways by limiting
access to information (searches), limited cognitive understanding (noise), and through our
own personal experiences. Thus, subjective perceptions or emotional responses may be
triggered by human traits or other factors. For example, we adjudge risk differently based on
the physical distance between ourselves and the danger, i.e., we feel safer if the danger is
further away, and we are less likely to continuously monitor it over an extended duration
(24). This may work relatively well for traditional dangers like fires or floods, but the spread
of a pandemic is invisible, and only media reports of those in hospital give any rough clue to
its presence. As such, it is likely that we fail to correctly use local transmission (infection)
rates as a guide of its proximity or distance to us and the level of threat it poses. Risk as a
feeling is less driven by actual probabilities and more by our instinctive and intuitive reaction
to danger (20, p. 70). Risk-taking has often been classified as a stable personality trait (25),
although situational or contextual factors can also matter (see, e.g., 26–28). An individual’s
risk type and their perception of risk are highly correlated, such that they interact to

Looking historically at plagues, professions such as street vendors, physicians, priests, gravediggers or
washerwomen were more seriously at risk of acquiring or transmitting diseases when moving from place to place.

exacerbate the underlying risk type. That is: risk seekers are likely to have a worse perception
of risk and not only are they willing to accept more gambles, but their estimations of the
gambles are underweighted, leading to greater adoption of risk than the individual intended
(29). In addition, we humans are also subject to framing biases, reacting differently
depending on the way in which information is presented (e.g., positively or negatively, see
30)4. This framing can increase or decrease our willingness to take or avoid risk, especially
where losses are concerned – the loss of life from contracting the virus is the ultimate loss.
Thus, preferences are not set in stone and are open to change, especially after we experience
losses; i.e., an individual may be more risk-seeking following losses and risk-averse
following gains (10, 31–33).
Feelings elicited during a pandemic have an impact on everyday activities (34) and
individuals are required to make trade-offs that are affected by their risk behavior. Is it safe to
go out shopping, to the park, to use public transportation etc.? What are the chances of
getting infected? How do we need to respond? Risk attitudes matter as individuals are aware
that going into public places increases the possibility of being infected; if there was to be an
infection, this would be subsequently regretted. Risk-averse individuals may respond more to
unfamiliar risks that are perceived as uncontrollable (35). During pandemics, states also may
become more controlling – historically, social mobility restrictions or regulations are
common in pandemics. For example, anti-plague regulations banned funerals, processions,
sale of clothing, and gatherings in public assemblies, all of which reduced opportunities for
trade, and imposed severe penalties when those rules were not followed. Community bonds
might be destroyed if people lose the opportunity to, for example, grieve, pay final respects,
or assemble (1). The level of social mobility in our current situation is interesting, as during

death.

this phase there is no real treatment or vaccination, which means that citizens need to rely on
precautionary behavior. As the reality of the COVID-19 outbreak emerged, we saw that states
started to introduce social distancing and isolation measures to deal with the pandemic and
the lack of a vaccine.
In this article, we take a look at key social or human mobility factors related to retail
and recreation, grocery stores and pharmacies, parks, transit stations, workplaces, and private
residences. To measure risk-taking attitude, we use the Global Preference Survey (36,37),
which analyzed risk at the country level by combining experimental lottery choice sequences
using a staircase method (choice between a fixed lottery in which individual could win x or
zero and varying sure payments) and self-assessment based on the willingness to take risks
(see Method section for more details). We then extended this data to obtain regional level
information. Exploring how risk attitude affects social mobility at the regional level is
interesting as risk behavior can be seen as the product of an interplay between individuals,
actions of others, and the community or social environment (4). Risk is therefore deeply
embedded in specific sociocultural backgrounds (38), with country and geographical
differences in risk-taking reported by scholars such as (36) (e.g., higher risk-taking values in
Africa and the Middle East while Western European countries are relatively risk-averse). In
the context of a pandemic where a population is attempting social isolation or are in
lockdown, we see that shopping behaviors change (drop) and large swathes of the workforce
have lost their jobs, which means that the entire population has been directly affected by the
pandemic if not the virus. It is therefore interesting to explore how citizens’ responses to an
epidemic are driven by risk attitudes or preferences at the community or regional level.

In particular, we are interested in how individual behavior responses to global
announcements – such as the COVID-19 outbreak classification as a pandemic5 by the WHO
– can be shaped by risk attitudes. We suggest that people in risk-taking environments may be
less likely to respond and engage in behavioral change which reduces risk. We are also
interested in comparing situations with higher or lower opportunity costs in human mobility.
The opportunity costs of staying home are defined as the cost incurred by not enjoying the
benefit of going out (benefits associated with the best alternative choice). For this, we explore
differences between weekdays and the weekend. As many individuals are still working
during the week, even while being at home, there is more psychological pressure to be active
during the weekend, which increases the opportunity costs of staying at home. Not going out
requires more psychological costs to fight against previously formed habits, as it is difficult
to abandon the way in which we are accustomed to act. We therefore hypothesize that regions
with higher risk attitudes are less likely to follow precautionary strategies when opportunity
costs are higher and are therefore are less likely to deviate from their outside activities during
the weekend relative to the baseline. Lastly, we also examine whether people adjust their
behavior when living in a population with a larger proportion of older people at greater risk
of more serious illness from contacting the virus. We expect that regions with a higher share
of over 65 individuals would show a greater reduction in mobility. In particular, risk-averse
regions may display stronger mobility deviations from their original baseline (stronger
reduction).

Results
We examined the relationship between the changes in human mobility during the outbreak of
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the average risk preferences of individuals in 58
countries (with 776 regions from 33 countries with subnational regions data)6. Our main goal
is to see if individuals in areas with higher (lower) levels of willingness to take risks are less
(more) likely to reduce their exposure to social interactions by going to public places between
15 Feb 2020 and 09 May 2020. The outcome variables measure the daily changes (in
percentage) in location visits compared to the median value of the same day of the week in
the 5-week baseline period, during 3 January and 6 February 2020. To see whether mobility
changes are related to risk tolerance, we first regressed the each of the six mobility measures
on risk-taking preference, namely, Retail & Recreation, Grocery & Pharmacy, Parks, Transit
Stations, Workplaces, and Residential. In each regression, we controlled for whether the day
is a weekend, an indicator distinguishing our sample time period by the day when the World
Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic (11 March 2020),
the total number of confirmed cases per 1,000 people, number of days since the first
confirmed coronavirus related death in the country7, percentage of population over 65,
population density (per squared km of land area), percentage of urban population, average
household size, unemployment rate, per capita income (in logs), daily average temperature,
and a set of indicators on government responses that covers recommending and requesting
closure of school, workplace, public transport, stay at home, cancellation of public events,
and restriction on gatherings and internal movement (39). Consequently, our results regarding
risk attitudes can be interpreted as independent of government lockdown measures. To this
end, we employed a random-effects linear model to estimate the linear effect of risk-

preference on mobility and linear interaction effects of risk and other covariates, namely,
pandemic declaration, weekend, and the share of population over 65.
As expected, we see an overall reduction in visits to all localities for almost all
regions other than residential places, particularly in the earlier weeks in the sample period
(see Fig. 1). Interestingly, a large proportion of observations showed an increase in visits to
parks, even in the earlier phase. Examining the general relationship between risk attitude and
the change in mobility in the entire sample period, we find some evident relationship to two
locations. Particularly, risk-taking is positively associated with the change in visitation to
places classified as retail and recreation (β=2.873, s.e.=1.180, CI95%=[0.561;5.185], P=0.015)
and parks (β=7.667, s.e.=2.577, CI95%=[2.616;12.718], P=0.003), which indicates that in
areas with higher average risk-tolerance, an individual is more likely to visit these places (or
less likely to reduce their frequency of visits). On the other hand, there is no apparent
relationship between risk preference and change in mobility to grocery and pharmacy (β=0.481, s.e.=1.060, CI95%=[-2.559;1.597], P=0.650), transit stations (β=1.352, s.e.=1.350,
CI95%=[-1.294;3.998], P=0.317), workplaces (β=0.306, s.e.=0.848, CI95%=[-1.355;1.967],
P=0.718) and residential areas (β=-0.241, s.e.=0.374, CI95%=[-0.973;0.492], P=0.519).
Most control variables report the expected effect on change in human mobility.
Specifically, there is a reduction in outings and an increase in staying home as severity
increases, such as after the WHO declared coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic, increase
in the number of case per population (except for parks and residential, in which the
relationship is positive and significant at 10% level and not significant, respectively), and
most lockdown measures8 (see Supplementary Table S1). We also find that, on average, there

In almost all cases, mobility is negatively and significantly correlated with the strictest confinement measure
(e.g., require closing of all non-essential workplace). The exception being restriction on gatherings, in which the
effect is not precisely estimated. Some social isolation recommendations (stay at home and work place) and
intermediate restrictions (schools and gatherings) reports the opposite effect on mobility to expectation.

is a greater reduction in visits to retail and recreational places (β=-4.386, s.e.=0.132, CI95%=[4.645;-4.127], P<0.001), grocery and pharmacy (β=-3.969, s.e.=0.167, CI95%=[-4.295;3.642], P<0.001), parks (β=-4.543, s.e.=0.446, CI95%=[-5.417;-3.669], P<0.001), and transit
stations (β=-0.791, s.e.=0.189, CI95%=[-1.162;-0.421], P<0.001) on the weekends, in contrast
to weekdays, while at the same time a reduction in visits to workplaces (β=8.277, s.e.=0.215,
CI95%=[7.855;8.698], P<0.001) and staying home (β=-3.284, s.e.=0.110, CI95%=[-3.501;3.068], P<0.001) is stronger in weekdays, compared to weekends. We note that while the
number of days since the first death in the nation decreases significantly with going to transit
stations (β=-0.387, s.e.=0.138, CI95%=[-0.658;-0.117], P=0.005), it had no effect or positive
effect on mobility to other localities. Decline in visits to grocery and pharmacy (β=-0.715,
s.e.=0.141, CI95%=[-0.992;-0.438], P<0.001), transit stations (β=-0.304, s.e.=0.166, CI95%=[0.629;0.022], P=0.068), and workplaces (β=-0.361, s.e.=0.092, CI95%=[-0.542;-0.180],
P<0.001) is stronger for countries with a higher population density.

change in visit to locations classified as retail and recreation (β=2.873, s.e.=1.180, CI95%=[0.561;5.185],

P=0.317), workplaces (β=0.306, s.e.=0.848, CI95%=[-1.355;1.967], P=0.718), and residential (β=-0.241,
s.e.=0.374, CI95%=[-0.973;0.492], P=0.519), compared to the respective baseline values over average individual
risk preference. Estimates of the risk-mobility relation are obtained from random-effects linear regression (Table
S1). Markers represent the daily change in visits to the six locations for each region during the entire sample
period9, with different colors showing observations over time (from most blue (first week of the sample period)
to yellow (middle of the sample period) to most red (last week of the sample period)).

Does the pandemic declaration increase the effect of risk-attitude? We examine the
interaction between willingness to take risks and pandemic declaration to assess if the effect
of risk-taking on mobility is evident. We find evidence suggesting the declaration is a strong

moderator of the risk-mobility effect. It is relevant to note that the declaration of the
pandemic precedes lockdown measures of most governments.
We see that the reduction in outdoor activities (or increase in staying home) can be
observed before COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the WHO, especially for visits to
places classified as retail and recreation, transit stations, and workplaces (see Fig. 2). The
magnitude of mobility change has indeed increased after the declaration. For example, there
is a further 11.3 percentage point (pp) drop in visits to retail and recreation locations (β=11.328, s.e.=0.879, CI95%=[-13.051;-9.606], P<0.001), 7.3pp drop in going to parks (β=7.303, s.e.=1.379, CI95%=[-10.006;-4.600], P<0.001), 12pp drop in going to transit stations
(β=-11.998, s.e.=0.833, CI95%=[-13.631;-10.365], P<0.001), and 8pp drop in going to
workplaces (β=-8.103, s.e.=0.642, CI95%=[-9.361;-6.846], P<0.001), respectively, compared
to the period before pandemic declaration (Fig. 2, Table S1). In contrast, we find an average
of 3.6pp increase in staying in a residential area (β=3.602, s.e.=0.285, CI95%=[3.042;4.161],
P<0.001) after declaration. Interestingly, the pandemic declaration did not have a severe
impact on visits to grocery stores and pharmacies (β=-0.987, s.e.=0.705, CI95%=[2.368;0.395], P=0.162)10.
We find that, with respect to risk preferences, the changes to visitation patterns
(compared to their respective baseline) are relatively greater for areas with lower average
willingness to take risk, following the pandemic declaration. Specifically, we find the
reduction in visits to grocery and pharmacy, transit stations, and workplaces prior to
declaration is negatively correlated with willingness to take risk. However, interrogating the
interaction terms between risk-taking and pandemic declaration revealed a more interesting

Nonetheless, the findings in our robustness checks (Table S8) suggest that visits to grocery and pharmacy also
decreased significantly after the pandemic declaration, which is also in line with the estimate obtained from
Table S1.

behavioral pattern; that is, the additional reduction in out-of-home activities after the
declaration is much more dramatic for areas with more less risk-tolerating individuals. We
found a statistically significant interaction effect on each of the outcome variables except for
residential places (retail and recreation: β=6.715, s.e.=1.166, CI95%=[4.430;9.001], P<0.001;
grocery and pharmacy: β=5.983, s.e.=1.013, CI95%=[3.998;7.968], P<0.001; parks: β=11.910,
s.e.=2.449, CI95%=[7.110;16.711], P<0.001; transit stations: β=7.168, s.e.=1.422,
CI95%=[4.381;9.954], P<0.001; workplaces11: β=4.020, s.e.=0.871, CI95%=[2.313;5.726],
P<0.001; see Fig. 2). It is also important to note that the pre- and post-declaration change in
visitation pattern differences are smaller for higher risk-tolerance areas and vice versa,
indicating that areas with higher average risk-taking are less likely to respond to the negative
change in environmental status.

11

One should note that in two out of the three robustness checks (Table S8), the interaction effect on workplaces
is not precisely estimated.

Fig. 2 | Change in visits to six location categories predicted by average individual risk preference before
and after pandemic declaration. The six panels show the predicted percentage change in visit to locations
classified as retail and recreation, grocery and pharmacy, parks, transit stations, workplaces, and residential,
compared to the respective baseline values, before and after WHO declared COVID-19 as a pandemic on 11
March 2020, over average individual risk preference. Estimates are obtained from Table S2, for illustration,
predicted changes are calculated over five points of the risk-taking variable (at the 1st, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 99th
percentiles of the distribution), which we categorized into five levels of willingness to take risk: very low, low,
neutral, high, and very high, respectively.

Mobility patterns weekdays vs. weekends. Next, we examine whether the tendency to change
the frequency of visits to different localities during weekdays and weekends is mediated by

risk attitude. As Fig. 3 shows, our earlier results are confirmed. Compared to weekdays,
individuals on average further reduce their visits to places (compared to the same day of the
week in the baseline period) classified as retail and recreation by 4.3pp (β=-4.272, s.e.=0.130,
CI95%=[-4.527;-4.017], P<0.001; see Fig. 3), grocery and pharmacy by 3.9pp (β=-3.915,
s.e.=0.164, CI95%=[-4.236;-3.594], P<0.001), parks by 4.4pp (β=-4.392, s.e.=0.450, CI95%=[5.273;-3.511], P<0.001), and transit stations by 0.7pp (β=-0.723, s.e.=0.185, CI95%=[-1.085;0.361], P<0.001), compared to the baseline. In contrast, the reduction in going to workplaces
is larger during weekdays (β=8.342, s.e.=0.213, CI95%=[7.925;8.759], P<0.001), while
individuals are more likely to stay home (places classified as residential) in general, the
(percentage point) increase of staying home is higher during weekdays compared to
weekends (β=-3.346, s.e.=0.109, CI95%=[-3.560;-3.131], P<0.001). The coefficients of the
interaction terms provide strong evidence that regions with lower risk-tolerance have a larger
reduction in mobility during weekends than in weekdays, compared to those who are more
risk-tolerant (retail and recreation: β=2.011, s.e.=0.318, CI95%=[1.388;2.634], P<0.001;
grocery and pharmacy: β=0.916, s.e.=0.411, CI95%=[0.110;1.722], P=0.026; parks: β=2.261,
s.e.=1.015, CI95%=[0.272;4.250], P=0.026; transit stations: β=1.181, s.e.=0.502,
CI95%=[0.197;2.165], P=0.019; workplaces: β=1.375, s.e.=0.506, CI95%=[0.384;2.367],
P=0.007; residential: β=-0.789, s.e.=0.260, CI95%=[-1.298;-0.279], P=0.002). Results from
robustness checks also confirm our findings (see Table S9 in SI Appendix).
Moreover, we find that the mediation effect is more apparent after the declaration of
pandemic, suggesting the effect manifests alongside severity. Specifically, we reran the
analysis including the interaction between the risk preference-weekend mediation effect and
pandemic declaration dummy (triple interaction term). We visualized the results in Fig. 4,
showing the difference in average marginal effects of weekends (in contrast to weekdays)
before and after the pandemic announcement, over levels of risk-taking (pre- and post-

declaration average marginal effects of weekends is shown in Fig. S1 and predicted change in
mobility in Fig. S2). We find that the tendency to reduce going out during the weekends
compared to weekdays increases significantly with the levels of risk-tolerance for all nonresidential and work locations, particularly in the post-declaration period (retail recreation:
β=5.036, s.e.=0.707, CI95%=[3.651;6.421], P<0.001; grocery pharmacy: β=4.273, s.e.=0.698,
CI95%=[2.904;5.642], P<0.001; parks: β=5.989, s.e.=1.532, CI95%=[2.985;8.993], P<0.001;
transit stations: β=4.697, s.e.=0.884, CI95%=[2.965;6.429], P<0.001). It can also be seen that
regions with higher risk-taking attitude have a larger pre-post-declaration relative weekendsweekdays difference in mobility for workplaces (β=4.008, s.e.=0.665, CI95%=[2.705;5.312],
P<0.001) and residential places (β=-1.397, s.e.=0.290, CI95%=[-1.966;-0.829], P<0.001).
These results are highly robust to our checks (see Fig. S3 and Table S10 in SI Appendix).

Actual risk. Next, we examine the relationship between mobility changes, risk attitude, and
proportion of elderly in the population to test if the relationship between mobility and risk is
moderated by the share of population at higher risk of dying from COVID-19. We thus

regressed change in mobility on willingness to take risk and share of population over 65 and
the interaction between the two (see Fig. 5). We found that areas with a larger population at
fatal risk (elderly) have larger cutback in going to grocery and pharmacy (β=-0.597,
s.e.=0.164, CI95%=[-0.918;-0.277], P<0.001), transit stations (β=-0.364, s.e.=0.153, CI95%=[0.664;-0.063], P=0.018), and workplaces (β=-0.447, s.e.=0.096, CI95%=[-0.636;-0.258],
P<0.001), as well as a decrease in staying at home (β=-0.128, s.e.=0.049, CI95%=[-0.224;0.033], P=0.009)12, even though the size of the coefficients suggest the magnitude of the
effect is quite small (e.g., with 1pp increase in share of over 65s in population, mobility
change for staying home decreases by 0.1pp). While we did not find a significant (negative)
change in mobility to retail and recreation (β=-0.226, s.e.=0.148, CI95%=[-0.517;0.065],
P=0.128) and parks (β=-0.561, s.e.=0.484, CI95%=[-1.511;0.388], P=0.247) due to population
risk level, results from the robustness checks show the negative effect is significant (see
Table S11). Moreover, we found a significant interaction effects on mobility of retail and
recreation (β=-0.388, s.e.=0.169, CI95%=[-0.719;-0.056], P=0.022) and residential (β =-0.183,
s.e.=0.050, CI95%=[-0.281;-0.086], P<0.001). This suggests that in areas with more riskloving individuals and a larger proportion of population at risk, people seem to have further
reduced going to retail and recreation places, however, regions with less risk-takers and
larger older population increase their time staying home. Nonetheless, for mobility changes in
other localities, the effect of risk-taking attitude does not seem to be moderated by the actual
population risk factor.

12

In our robustness checks excluding regions with censored mobility values due to insufficient data traffic, we
found a weakly significant positive (at 10% level) effect.

Discussion
As with Plato’s cave, there are stark differences between how we perceive risk and the reality
or the calculated level of risk, which can result in totally different behavioral outcomes. Risk
attitudes clearly shape behavioral responses to pandemics. The actual health risks of the
COVID-19 pandemic are (most likely) low for most groups apart from the elderly (40,41). In
terms of mortality, the overall health consequences of Covid-19 could be similar to a
pandemic influenza13 (42). Nevertheless, risk attitude – rather than actual risk – influence real
behavioral activity. Our results demonstrate the sharp shifts in the relation between
behavioral activity and risk attitudes before and after declaration of COVID-19 as a
pandemic, as well as shifts before and after the first related death was recorded. The first
thing that becomes apparent is that behavior and our willingness to take on risks have both
shifted dramatically since the baseline period in mid-February. At this stage, only three
deaths were recorded outside mainland China14 (one in Hong Kong, Japan, and the
Philippines) and life was proceeding as normal. There was no imminent perception of a threat
of the worldwide pandemic to come, reflected in the baseline reporting of behavior and the
willingness to take risks. However, when we compare this to the first and second sample
period, we observe mostly negative shifts in behavior (excluding residential) but a mixed set
of reactions to risk. Several categories saw a substantial negative shift in visits, including
Retail & Recreation, Transit Stations, and Workplaces; compared to the baseline, visiting
behaviors had already started to drop off before the pandemic announcement but dropped off
again afterward. During this first period, we can see that social distancing and work from
home was starting to make an impact, as people stopped travelling to and from work

13

Nevertheless, with immunization uncertainty and lack of vaccination and treatment, hospital can be
overcrowded rapidly resulting overinflated infection and mortality rate.

(especially through crowded transit stations) and also stopped engaging in non-essential retail
shopping (therapy). After the pandemic was officially announced, we see a second wave of
behavioral shifts as more people reduce their travel, shopping and more either lose their jobs
or are in shutdown mode. However, we do observe an interesting shift in risk attitudes across
these three categories as they all exhibit a slightly positive trend in the period before the
announcement, but they all shift to a much stronger negative risk trend after the
announcement. Given that ‘flattening the curve’ was the strategic focus for most
governments, the social distancing message appears to have been received even prior to most
lockdown measures. Conversely, Grocery & Pharmacy, Parks, and Residential had much
smaller shifts both before and after the announcements when compared to the baseline.
However, the shifts in Grocery & Pharmacy and Parks – while much smaller than the other
categories – appear to undergo a large risk preference-mobility shift; that is, the first set of
behavioral changes results in a positive sloping risk function that flipped into a negative
sloped function after the pandemic announcement.
While seemingly at odds with expectations, one may want to consider what the
announcement of the pandemic would have meant to most individuals. With a looming threat
of lockdown and isolation, at this point individuals would have ramped up shopping to stock
up for likely upcoming government lockdown. In addition, those with an affinity for the
outdoors may have wanted to enjoy their parks and outdoor lifestyle as much as possible
before it was banned. This is in line with the reported shifts in the number of visits, which
while still negative overall, indicate that the change to number of visits is less negative than
prior to the announcement. The odd one out is the Residential visits category; while small, we
can still observe double increases in visitation numbers both pre and post the official
pandemic announcement, and there is no change in the function representing the willingness
to take risks.

When interpreting these statistics, we need to bear in mind the ‘normal’ weekly habits
of people; that is, work during the week and undertake other activities/pastimes on the
weekends. In order to ensure we capture the shift in behavior, we compare the weekday
behaviors and risk attitudes to that of the weekends. Our result demonstrates that there are a
few differences between weekdays and weekends, as one would expect that on weekends
there are slightly more activities taking place other than work. Furthermore, we see little
variance in the slopes of weekdays and weekends risk attitudes. The large negative shifts
across all categories except workplaces after the official declaration, but much smaller
variations between weekdays and weekends before the declaration, further supports the
discussion above: that the behavior had already started to change well before the declaration
of a pandemic, with many individuals starting to increase their weekend activities. However,
after the pandemic was announced, a raft of measures that tried to limit the spread of the virus
resulted in a very large change in most economies due to closure of businesses and job losses.
This fundamental change in economic activities and loss of work left very little to
differentiate weekends from weekdays for a large number of people, which is reflected in the
large negative changes in the comparisons. Prior to the announcement, we see that the
function on willingness to take risk is fairly flat or slightly downward sloping, but risk
perceptions change significantly for all categories after the announcement. The most
interesting changes are in Workplace and Residential, exhibiting a relatively large increase in
the willingness to take high risks: this could be explained through people wanting to visit
family and friends or the increased willingness to work despite the risk of infection.
In general, throughout our analysis we observe that less risk-tolerating regions more
actively adjust their behavioral patterns in response to the pandemic. Risk seeking regions are
less responsive to protective measures. Thus, the tendency towards being more careless or
more cautious carries substantial behavioral implications that is also affected by different

levels of opportunity costs, as evidenced by the weekend effect. Regional differences seem to
matter, offering support for a “regional personality factor” in risk taking. As with individuals
who allocate themselves to more risky professions there are regions that are likely more
likely acting as “stunt persons”, “fire-fighter”, or “race-car driver regions”.
Risk takers therefore seem to demonstrate a lower preference for their own and
communal safety, as demonstrated that risk averse regions with higher percentages of 65+
people are more actively to increase social isolation by staying at home. Such behavioral
differences due to risk preferences may indicate different levels of homeostatic responses.
Risk aversion seems to promote a stronger fluctuation around a target level. For example, if
you are driving on a motorway and it starts to rain or snow, what do you do? Our result
would imply that risk averse individuals may be more likely to slow down to reduce the
likelihood of having an accident. Risk averse individuals have a higher need for risk
compensation. Thus, the level of risk at which a person feels best is maintained
homeostatically in relation to factors such as emotional or physiological experiences (19).
Overall, the lack of adjustment among risk taking regions is interesting, as many
settings that explore risk taking behavior are connected to the possibility of attracting social
fame and praise, financial gains, or other potential positive outcomes. In our setting, the risks
are strongly attached to the loss of their own and other’s health or life without achieving
major gains, although positive utility gains also arise from not restricting one’s usual
activities. It seems like the risk takers are more “pathologically” stable during such
environmentally challenging circumstances. It is almost as if risk taking regions are more
determined to maintain settings as activity-oriented, while risk averse regions are more goaloriented in achieving social distancing.

The current analysis is interesting, as a large number of studies exploring the
implications of risk are based on cross-sectional samples or between-subject designs in
laboratory settings. In this case, the danger is more prolonged, lasting over several weeks or
months, compared with other risk situations such as driving a car. Automatic or response
“scripts” become less relevant as individuals have the chance to think about their actions and
adjust their behavior accordingly. Strategic, tactical, or operational factors become more
dominant while perceptual, emotional, and motivational factors remain active. In addition,
individuals do not face a single “either-or” decision but are required to constantly evaluate
their choices to go out or stay at home. Thus, cognitive reevaluation is a core feature in our
setting, and is based on dynamic feedback loops. Risk loving regions are also less likely to
adjust their behavior based on external stimulus such as the WHO announcement of
classifying COVID-19 as a pandemic.
A core limitation is that we are only able to explore human behavior at the regional
and not individual level. Studies that use individual data could focus in more detail on
individual differences such as age or gender or differences in affective reactions or perceived
locus of control and could try to disentangle perceptions (risk preferences) partly from actual
risk as statistics provide detailed information on the actual age risk profile. Such a study
would provide a better understanding of habit changes, as well as potentially reveal
motivational reasons for behavioral changes or behavioral stickiness. To reduce levels of
uncertainty or ambiguity, individuals will try to gain control over a situation or they will
change their preferences to better the fit the situation, and thus try to gain control in a
secondary way (19). Other psychological factors such as overconfidence may also matter. In
addition, we do not have information about the actual level of social mobility in the baseline
time period. If that information were available, one could argue that those who had the
highest levels of mobility prior to the lockdown have had the largest relative loss; we should

therefore observe this group exhibiting the most risk seeking behavior and breaking the
lockdown rules. On the other hand, those who previously had the least amount of social
mobility have in relative terms only suffered a small loss – and should be much less likely to
break the lockdown rules. However, this may adjust over time, as individuals habituate to the
changes and reset their reference points. This fits nicely into the suggestion that “a person
who has not made peace with his losses is likely to accept gambles that would be
unacceptable to him otherwise” (29, p. 287), which is consistent with risk preference changes
in a disaster situation (10).
Risk is a fascinating topic as we have two forces in place. Based on evolutionary
theory, people are risk-inclined but also control-inclined. Risk taking is necessary to cope
with environmental changes and the constant level of uncertainty and danger. On other hand,
control of the environment is required to reduce risks that go beyond the desired levels or that
may pose danger to one’s survival (19).
The pandemic declaration caused a fundamental shift in behavior, independently of
government lockdown measures. Future studies could explore in more detail how information
dissemination and media reporting are connected to behavioral responses and the level of risk
taking within regions. Removal of the lockdown policies is likely to be undertaken cautiously
and slowly rather than via one large change. It is unclear at this stage how changes –
particularly among the risk averse regions – have already led to new habit formation that will
not readjust to previously normal settings. Future studies will provide more insights into such
a question.

Material and Methods

Mobility. We obtained the mobility measures on country and regional level from the
COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports (43), assessed on 16 May 202015. The dataset
consists of six location-specific mobility measures for 132 countries between 15 February
2020 and 09 May 2020. For 51 out of the 131 countries, the mobility measures are also
available at the regional level. For the United States, both state and county level is available,
although we did not include county level in our analysis as risk preference is not available at
the county level. The resulting number of sub-national regions included is 1,207. Based on
anonymized and aggregated data from Google users who have opted in to their Location
History service, each mobility measure records the percent change in visits and length of stay
to places classified as Retail & Recreation, Grocery & Pharmacy, Parks, Transit Stations,
Workplaces, and Residential within the geographic area. The percent change is compared to
the median value of the same day of the week between 3 January and 6 February 2020. For
privacy reasons, Google censored values if the traffic volume is not high enough to ensure
anonymity. While the median number of censored values for each mobility measure is zero,
about 48% (n=619) of regions have at least one censored value for any of the six mobility
variables on any given day in the sample period. To ensure our results were not caused by the
unbalanced sample due to censored values, we reran our results by excluding regions with
various thresholds of daily values censored, finding that the results remain highly robust to all
exclusions (see Table S7 to S11 in SI Appendix).
Risk attitude. We obtain the measure of risk preference from the globally representative
Global Preferences Survey collected in 2012 using the Gallup World Poll (36, 37), which is
aggregated into the country (n=76) and regional (n=1,126) level. Risk preferences of the
respondents were elicited through a qualitative question (self-rated perceived risk preference

15

Before Google officially release of the mobility data file on 15 April 2020, an earlier version of the data was
obtained from (44, https://osf.io/rzd8k/), based on values extracted from each PDF file of the Mobility Reports
using WebPlotDigitizer (45).

on a 11-point scale) and a set of quantitative questions using the staircase method, where
respondents were asked to choose between varying sure payments and a fixed lottery, in
which the individual could win x with some probability p or zero. The responses from the
two questions were combined (with roughly equal weights) to produce the overall individual
risk preference measure (37). For subnational regions where both mobility measures and risk
preference measures are available at the region levels, we employed the regional aggregated
values (average of standardized values at the individual level), otherwise country aggregated
values were used.
Covid-19 cases and deaths statistics and government response indicators. Country-level
statistics on the daily number of cases and deaths were sourced from the European Centre for
Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Together with the set of indicators on government
responses, these data were obtained from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response
Tracker (OxCGRT) (39, assessed on 18 May 2020), available for 167 countries recorded
daily from 01 January 2020. Out of the 17 response indicators available from the OxCGRT,
we take seven indicators on policies regarding social isolation and confinement, including
school, workplace, and public transport closures, public events cancellation, stay at home
requirements, and gatherings and internal movement restrictions. Each indicator has various
levels of response, from no measures taken to recommendation and implementation of the
policy, recorded on ordinal scale. For example, workplace closure is classified into four
levels (1 – no measures; 2 – recommend work from home; 3 – require closing for some
categories or sectors of workers; and 4 – require closing for all-but-essential workplaces)16.
We dichotomously coded each response to be included in our regression analysis. OxCGRT
also records if the policy is applied nationwide; for robustness checks, we recode the each

more detailed definition of each containment and closure policies variable.

response indicators as no measures taken if policy is targeted to a specific geographical
region (see SI Appendix).
Control variables. Population. Population density (people per squared km of land area),
percentage of urban population, share of population ages 65 were obtained from the World
Development Indicators (46) and are available at the country level. We also collected the
average household size (average number of usual residents per household) from the Database
on Household Size and Composition 2019 (47). Economic indicators. We also obtained the
latest available estimates (as of May 2020) of unemployment rate (% of total labor force),
based on estimates from the International Labour Organization, and per capita GDP (2010
US$ constant, in natural log form) from (46). Weekend. We employ the definition of working
week across countries according to (48). Daily average temperature. Temperature data is
obtained from the GHCN (Global Historical Climatology Network)-Daily database (49, 50),
assessed on 19 May 2020. For each region, the daily average temperature (in tenths of degree
Celsius (°C)) was calculated from taking the mean17 of the average temperature recorded
from all weather stations located within 50km from the centroid of the region.
Combining datasets. To join datasets together for our analysis, we use regions defined in the
Google Mobility dataset as our point of reference. In general, for regions with mobility
measures but not from another dataset (i.e., risk attitude or average daily temperature is
unavailable for that region), we employ its country values. The resulting number of countries
in our final sample is 58, after merging all variables used in this study, with a total of 776
subnational regions from 33 countries (see Table S6 in SI Appendix). The total number of
region-day observations ranges from 58,284 to 67,073, depending on the availability of
mobility measures.

17

Using median does not change our results.

Analyses. To examine the main question of how mobility patterns during the COVID-19
outbreak change according to risk attitude, we analyzed the data using random-effects linear
model. Standard errors are clustered on the smallest geographic unit in each regression. Data
and codes used in this study can be found on Open Science Framework
(https://osf.io/7bxqp/).

S11 for the six sets of regressions conducted in the main text, respectively. The first two
checks concern including regions with censored mobility value in the sample of the analysis.
We impose two restrictions on sample inclusion 1) regions with at least one censored value
for the outcome mobility measures are excluded from the corresponding regression and 2) a
more restrictive criteria with regions at least one censored value for any of the outcome
mobility measures are excluded from the analysis. The first criteria excluded number of
regions ranging from 54 (Workplace) to 217 (Residential), depending on the outcome
mobility measure used while the second criteria reduce the number of regions to 484. The
third check concerns if estimates are sensitive to whether government response is general by
recoding indicators as no measures taken if the movement restrictions (or recommendation of
restrictions) were not applied countrywide. In general, our main findings are robust to all
three checks.
For the overall risk-mobility relationship (comparing estimates from Table S7 to
Table S1), imposing sample exclusions increases the strength of the relationship for all
mobility measures except for transit station under the first exclusion rule (first exclusion rule:

β=0.251, s.e.=0.427, CI95%=[-0.587;1.088], P=0.557). Transforming the government response
indicators slight reduce the size of the coefficients while leaving the statistical significance
unchanged (retail & recreation: β=3.724, s.e.=1.225, CI95%=[1.324;6.124], P=0.002; grocery

residential: β=-0.481, s.e.=0.374, CI95%=[-1.213;0.252], P=0.199). The coefficient estimates
for our main control variables (pandemic declaration and weekends) are also close to those
found in the main results, apart from % population 65+, where the negative effects on
mobility change to non-residential places are more prominent in the restricted samples
(checks 1 and 2).
For the declaration moderator effect on the risk-mobility relationship, the results
(coefficients of the declaration x risk preference term) remain highly robust except for
residential, where statistically significance is drop when regions with censored values were
removed (first exclusion rule: Retail & recreation: β=4.965, s.e.=1.210, CI95%=[2.593;7.337],

s.e.=0.494, CI95%=[-0.053;1.882], P=0.064), workplaces (first exclusion rule: β=1.316,

s.e.=0.494, CI95%=[0.147;2.083], P=0.024), and residential area (first exclusion rule: β=1.141, s.e.=0.305, CI95%=[-1.739;-0.543], P<0.001; second exclusion rule: β=-1.255,
s.e.=0.321, CI95%=[-1.884;-0.626], P<0.001; government response indicators transformed:
β=-0.724, s.e.=0.259, CI95%=[-1.232;-0.215], P=0.005). Transforming government response
indicators rendered the significance of the interaction effects for going to grocery and
pharmacy (β=0.466, s.e.=0.420, CI95%=[-0.356;1.289], P=0.267; first exclusion rule: β=0.697,
s.e.=0.406, CI95%=[-0.099;1.494], P=0.086; second exclusion rule: β=0.800, s.e.=0.454,
CI95%=[-0.091;1.691], P=0.078). This suggests that the tendency to further reduce mobility
on the weekends than during the week for low risk-tolerance regions (as compared to high
risk-tolerance regions) is evident before pandemic declaration. Moreover, we see that the
results with triple interactions between risk preference, weekend, and pandemic declaration
resembles to that in the main text, albeit for regions with very high risk preference, the preand post-declaration difference in the weekend reduction in mobility is less precisely
estimated in the second sample restriction, in particular for retail and recreation, grocery and
pharmacy, and parks.
Lastly, we found some of the estimates of the risk preference-risk pool interaction
terms is similar to that in the main analysis. For retail & recreation, the first exclusion rule
(β=-0.365, s.e.=0.185, CI95%=[-0.729;-0.002], P=0.049) and second exclusion rule (β=-0.550,
s.e.=0.176, CI95%=[-0.894;-0.205], P=0.002) both result in significant interaction terms, while
transforming the government response indicators, the significance disappeared (β=-0.046,
s.e.=0.163, CI95%=[-0.365;0.273], P=0.777). For residential area, the negative interaction
terms is highly robust (first exclusion rule: β=-0.167, s.e.=0.060, CI95%=[-0.284;-0.050],
P=0.005; second exclusion rule: β=-0.189, s.e.=0.063, CI95%=[-0.313;-0.066], P=0.003;
government response indicators transformed: β=-0.268, s.e.=0.045, CI95%=[-0.355;-0.181],
P<0.001). For other localities, the coefficient of the interaction term is consistently not
statistically significant.
