Abstract
The study aims to understand Twitter users’ discourse and psychological reactions to
COVID-19. We use machine learning techniques to analyze about 1.9 million Tweets (written in
English) related to coronavirus collected from January 23 to March 7, 2020. A total of salient 11
topics are identified and then categorized into ten themes, including “updates about confirmed
cases,” “COVID-19 related death,” “cases outside China (worldwide),” “COVID-19 outbreak in
South Korea,” “early signs of the outbreak in New York,” “Diamond Princess cruise,” “economic
impact,” “Preventive measures,” “authorities,” and “supply chain.” Results do not reveal
treatments and symptoms related messages as prevalent topics on Twitter. Sentiment analysis
shows that fear for the unknown nature of the coronavirus is dominant in all topics. Implications
and limitations of the study are also discussed.

Introduction
WHO declares COVID-19 as a global health pandemic. Social media has played a crucial
role before the virus outbreak and continues to do so as it spreads globally. After China took strict
quarantine measures as an intervention (e.g., cities on locked down, school closure, and employed
self-isolation), Chinese social media platforms (e.g., Weibo, WeChat, Toutiao) become the lifeline
for almost all isolated people who have been housebound for 30+ days and relying on these
channels to obtain information, exchange opinions, socialize, and order food [1]. Existing studies
[2-5] show that Twitter data can provide useful information for epidemic disease (e.g., H1N1,
Ebola), including tracking rapidly evolving public sentiments, measuring public interests and
concerns, estimating real-time disease activity and trends, and tracking reported disease levels.

2

However, these studies have limitations, with only qualitatively manual coding a very small
number of Tweets. They require more advanced techniques to improve accuracy and precision for
examining public opinions and sentiments. In addition, it remains unknown about public reactions
to the COVID online. The vast majority of searched articles about COVID-19 and 2019-nCoV
focus on epidemic control, such as the transmissibility of the virus [6], clinical characteristics of
the infected cases [7], and patient screening [8].
The present study uses tremendous amounts of collected Twitter data to respond and add
knowledge to our understandings of the pandemic. Aiming to explore the public discourse and
psychological reactions during the early stage of COVID-19, we use a machine learning approach
to examine (1) What latent topics related to COVID-19 can we identify from these Tweets? (2)
What are the themes of these identified topics? (3) How Twitter users emotionally react to COVID19 pandemic? And (4) How do these sentiments change over time?

Methods
Research design
We used an observational study design and a purposive sampling approach to select all the
Tweets contained defined hashtags (e.g., #2019nCoV) related to COVID-19 on Twitter. We used
natural language processing methods to find salient topics and terms related to COVID-19. Our
Twitter data mining approach included data preparation and data analysis. Data preparation
consisted of three steps: (1) sampling; (2) data collection; and (3) pre-processing the raw data.
After pre-processing the raw dataset, we proceeded to the data analysis stage, including (1)
unsupervised machine learning, (2) qualitative method; and (3) sentiment analysis. The unit of
analysis was each message-level Tweet posted on Twitter.
3

Sampling and data collection
We purposely selected a list of 19 trending hashtags related to COVID-19 as key search terms
to collect Tweets on Twitter (S1 Tables). We used Twitter’s open application programming
interface (API) to collect Tweets published between January 23, 2020, and March 7, 2020. We
used the Python code provided by Twitter Developer [9] to access the Twitter API. Shown in Fig
1, a total of 20 million (n=20,370,854) Tweets were collected. After we removed the non-English
Tweets (n=9,694,320), duplicates and retweets (n=7,731,035), 1.9 million (n=1,963,285) Tweets
were our dataset for this study. The following features were collected for each single Tweet
message (1) each message-level tweets (full text); (2) function features of (a) hashtags; (b) the
number of favorites; (c) the number of followers; (d) the number of friends; (e) number of retweets;
(f) user location; and (g) user description.

Pre-processing the raw dataset
We pre-processed the raw data to ensure quality. We used Python, a programming language,
to conduct data analysis. The pre-processing plan was as follows:

4

(1) We removed the hashtag symbol and its content (e.g., #COVID19), @users, and URLs
from the messages because the hashtag symbols or the URLs did not contribute to the message
analysis.
(2) We removed all non-English characters (non-ASCII characters) because the study focused
on the analysis of messages in English.
(3) We removed repeated words. For example, sooooo terrified was converted to so terrified.
(4) We removed special characters, punctuations, and numbers from the dataset as they did
not help with detecting the profanity comments.

Data analysis
Unsupervised machine learning
We used unsupervised machine learning to examine data for patterns because this approach
was commonly used when studies had little observations or insights of the unstructured text data.
A qualitative approach had challenges analyzing the large scale of Twitter data. Unsupervised
learning derived a probabilistic clustering based on the data itself, allowing us to conduct
exploratory analyses of large unstructured texts in social science research. We configured topic
modeling, an unsupervised machine learning method, to generate top latent topic distributions.
Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) [10] was a probabilistic model of word counts that analyzes a
set of documents. We used LDA to identify patterns, themes, and structures of the Tweets texts
and examine how these themes were connected. It enabled us to efficiently categorize the large
bodies of data based on patterns and features. LDA had been used to do sentiment analysis of
Tweets related to health [11]. Topic modeling had been widely used to gain a descriptive
understating of unstructured Twitter big data in social science research [12].

5

Qualitative analysis
We triangulated and contextualized findings from unsupervised learning in the study. We
employed the qualitative approach to support deeper qualitative dives into the dataset, such as
labeling popular words and Tweet topics, assigning meanings and themes to the topics, interpreting
the themes and patterns identified from the Tweets [13], and inductively developing themes for
the latent topics generated by machine algorithms. The qualitative approach relies on the diverse,
in-depth interpretations from human, which allows for inductive, exploratory analysis, and the
application of theoretical approaches [14].

Sentiment analysis
Sentiment analysis was a computational and natural language processing-based method that
analyzed the people’s sentiment, emotions, and attitudes in given texts [15] and an essential
method in social media research. The sentiment analysis in the present study was based on a
machine learning model for predicting emotions from English Tweets [16]. This model classified
each tweet into eight pairwise emotions in Plutchik’s wheel of emotions [17], including joysadness, trust-disgust, fear-anger, and surprise-anticipation. This method returned one emotion
from the eight categories for each given Tweet.

Results
Descriptive results
After pre-processing the collected tweets, our final dataset consisted of 1,963,285 Tweets
after removing the duplicates mentioning at least one of the nineteen hashtags from January 23 to

6

March 7, 2020. Fig 2 presented the number of Tweets under the top 9 hashtag by dates
(“#Coronavirus”, n = 1,405,254, “#Wuhan”, n = 144,240, “#Wuhancoronavirus”, n = 73,393,
“#Coronaoutbreak”, n = 73,147, “#2019ncov”, n = 60,278, “#ChinaCoronavirus”, n = 19,188,
“#Chinavirus”, n = 17,865, “#CoronavirusChina”, n = 16,371, “#Wuhanoutbreak”, n = 10,548).
The number of Tweets using hashtag #coronavirus gradually increased since February 14 and
dropped on March 1 when the hashtag #wuhanoutbreak suddenly increased for four days.

COVID-19 related topics
The automated machine learning LDA approach generated commonly co-occurred words and
also organized them into different topics. We calculated the most appropriate number of topics
based on the coherence model – gensim [18]. We chose the number of topics to be 11 returned by
LDA for this dataset because it had the highest coherence score. Fig 3 showed the coherence score
for the number of topics returned by the LDA model.

COVID-19 related themes
We generated some representative Tweets on each topic to explain the themes of these topics.
Two authors discussed the bigrams and representative Tweets in each of the 11 topics and then
categorized them into ten themes (Table 2). In addition, we computed the topic distance [10] and
presented a 2D plane of the intertopic distance [19] in Fig 4. Each circle represented a topic from
Topic 1 to Topic 13 in the study. The centers are determined by computing the distance between
topics. In the visualization, these circles were not overlapped, which cross-validated the
classification of the ten themes.

Notes: PS: principal component. The circled areas are the overall prevalence, and the circle
center is determined by computing the distance between topics.

Table 2 presented the identified topics and themes, and each row of bigrams represented one
topic under the theme. We identified ten themes, such as “updates about the number of COVID19 cases (confirmed cases, total confirmed, cases reported),” “COVID-19 related death [(new
deaths, total deaths) and (people die, death rates)],” and “preventive measures [(toilet paper, selfisolate), (face masks, panic buying), travel bans, and (washing hands, test kits, 20 seconds, soap

Sentiment analysis
Tweets contained information about people’s thoughts and emotions [20]. We presented
individuals’ emotional reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic in Fig 5. It represented the proportion
of emotional tweets over daily tweets by date. Fear (yellow line) was consistently the dominant
emotion over time, which was about 50% of daily Tweets from the Wuhan outbreak to early March.
Proportionally lower than feeling of fear, Tweets on trust (brown line) slightly increased over time.

Fig 5. Emotions trends during the early stages of the COVID-19

Sentiments within 11 topics
Table 4 showed the percentage of each emotion within each of the 11 topics. Across all topics,
we observed that the feeling of fear has been prominent. For example, fear for the unknown nature
of the COVID-19 consisted of almost 50% of the Tweets in all eleven topics. Approximately 24%
of the emotions within Tweets under Topic 1 related to the public’s trust for the health authorities.
Since fear was prominent in all eleven topics, we further ran a one-tailed z test and assessed
if each of the eight emotions was statistically significantly different across topics. We used a pvalue smaller than .001 as a threshold and presented the results in Table 4. For example, fear for
the uncertainty about COVID-19 was found to have a higher probability of being prevalent in
Topics 1, 4, 9, and 11. Trust expressed in Tweets was statistically significant prevalent in Topics
1, 2, and 10. Surprise for the pandemic was statistically significant frequent in Topics 1 and 11.
Joy was statistically significant widespread in Topics of 5, 7, 8, and 11.

Discussion and conclusion
This study shows Twitter users’ discussions and sentiments to the COVID-19 from January
23 to March 7, 2020. Our findings facilitate an understanding of public discussions and sentiments
to the outbreak of COVID-19 in a rapid and real-time way, contributing to the surveillance system
to understand the evolving situation. The study overcomes the limitations of the traditional social
science approach, which relies on time-consuming, retrospective, time-lagged, small-scale surveys,
and interviews. The identified patterns and emotions of public tweets could be used to guide
targeted intervention programs.
First, early recognition of COVID-19 cases and a potential outbreak in New York City were
identified among a massive number of tweets, suggesting that the Twitter community has
acknowledged the disease severity as early as February. A small peak of the Tweets volume is
identified between Feb 10th and 14th, and then gradually increase again after Feb.14th. This finding

16

is also timed with the very first CDC’s warning on Twitter (@CDCgov) on February 10, 2020: “If
you’ve recently from China, know the symptoms of #2019nCoV. These include mild to severe
respiratory illness with fever, cough, shortness of breath. See bit.ly/38zjnYo.” An increasing
number of Tweets may be followed with CDC’s post, suggesting a good opportunity to guide the
public to take action to take preventive measures in February. Rapidly identifying and utilizing
social media messages may help the public and authorities to respond to the spread of the disease
at the early stages.
Second, discussions of COVID-19 symptoms (e.g., cough, fever, difficulty breathing) and
treatments (e.g., vaccine, rest and sleep, drink liquids) were notably missing from our collected
Tweets from January 23 to March 7, 2020. One study selects Tweets (n=35,786) associated with
COVID-19 symptoms (e.g., diagnosed, pneumonia, fever, cough) from March 3 to 20, 2020, and
finds that the volume of signal Tweets for symptoms increases over time [21]. The inconsistent
findings suggest that Twitter is not widely used as a platform for posting symptoms or seeking
medical help. Findings inform that more treatment-related messages can be posted as an
educational tool for the public on social media Health authorities or public health communities.
Third, fear is a dominant emotion in all topics during the early stages of the COVID-19
pandemic. Results are consistent with other studies [22-25], which shows that COVID-19
significantly impacts individuals’ psychological conditions. Sentiment analysis of the COVID-19
pandemic related content contributes to our understanding of the dynamics of online users’
concerns and feelings during the epidemic. Our findings have implications for health authorities
that mental health and psychosocial well-being support is needed during this time [20].
There are several limitations to the study. First, we only sample a trending of 19 hashtags as
search terms to collect Twitter data. Some new hashtags have become new trending terms for

17

Twitter users to group topics over time. For example, #COVID19 has been widely used after it
becomes the official name for the virus. Second, Twitter users are not representative of the whole
population and only indicate online users’ opinions and reactions about COVID-19. However, the
Twitter dataset is a valuable source for understanding the real-time Twitter user-generated content
related to COVID-19 disease activities. Third, non-English Tweets are removed from the analysis,
and results are limited to a particular population. Future studies are recommended to include Italian,
Germany, and Spanish languages for COVID-19 analysis.
