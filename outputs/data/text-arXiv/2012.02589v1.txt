ABSTRACT
We consider the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 which is characterized by two distinct features.
One is the existence of asymptomatic carriers which is a hidden variable in the problem. The other is
the issue of latency which means that among the symptomatic carriers there could be a fraction
whose symptoms develop after a couple of days. Our modelling is restricted to what we call the
Phase -1 of the disease. During this phase the disease sets in and the number of infected people
starts growing fast ( the number of new cases per day keeps growing on an average ) and then it
slows down ( the number of new cases per day starts decreasing ) with the number of new cases
decreasing to about one tenth of its peak value or even smaller). We define Phase-1 to be over when
the daily cases start rising once again. We write down a Henon-like map to take various effects into
account for this first phase. Our principle findings are:
i) The initial growth rate of symptomatic patients is slow if the probability of resulting in an
asymptomatic patient as a result of contact between a healthy person and an infected person is high
ii) If the testing and isolating efforts of the government can lead to successful quarantining of the
symptomatic patient then the evolution of the disease will be checked very effectively even if the
quarantining of asymptomatics is less than successful
iii)By comparing the evolution dynamics of our map with the evolution dynamics of a country like
New Zealand we conclude that the ratio of asymptomatic to symptomatic patients will be close to
unity
iv) The same procedure for a typical European country like Austria shows that this ratio will be a
factor of two or higher
v) Specifically, for India we predict that the Phase 1 will continue to the middle of March 2021
leading to a total number of (12.5 ± 0.7) × 106 symptomatic patients.
vi) The latency effect will cause an increase in the initial growth rate but a slower approach to the
final steady state

I INTRODUCTION:
In December 2019 a new epidemic started spreading across the world with two unique features. To
recall the simplest scenario for an epidemic , consider a community with two kinds of people on a
given ( let’s say the nth ) day- xn ,the fraction of healthy (virus free)but susceptible people and yn
the fraction of infected people. If we ignore the number of deaths and assume that on a given day
the number of new infected people will be jointly proportional to the existing number of infected
and uninfected people, we get the logistic map [1] describing the spreading of a standard influenza
virus. More sophisticated versions of this are the Ross model [2] and the SIR model [3]. With this
new virus (COVID-19) there are two dangerous twists.
A) There are two kinds of infected people- one group which does not show any symptoms but
can pass it on over the next couple of weeks (i.e. several days). These are the asymptomatic
spreaders – the hidden variable in this problem.
B) The other twist is that those who are symptomatic may take a certain number of days
(could be as long as three or four) to develop the symptoms. Hence this group will have
been infecting people not just on the n-th day but also on n-1, n-2 th day if the latency
period is taken to be 3 days. This latency period implies that any map (or differential
equation) will have to have an in-built delay.
The standard literature [4-6] of the dynamics of the spreading of infection has been very
nicely summarised in Ref 7. Extension of the SIR models to SEIR models have been carried
out in Refs [8-10] and the number of deaths have been included in the SEIRD model of Ref
[11]. The dynamics is traditionally written in terms of differential equations. The simplest is
the logistic equation [1] corresponding to the map described above. The more complicated
variety ( the analogue of the Lotka- Volterra population dynamics ) is the Ross model [2] for
spreading of malaria and the popular SIR ( susceptible- infected- recovered ) developed by
Kermach and McKendrick (3). None of these models include the two vital issues mentioned
above. In the SEIR ( susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered ) model [8-10] where a
distinction is made between the susceptible population and those that have been exposed
to the disease but are not infectious. A significant variant of the SIR model is the stochastic
SIR model [12,13] which is an important variation and was used in the early stages of the
present disease [14-15]. Variations of the stochastic SIR model have been recently studied to
model the dynamics of the disease in China [16] and make predictions about its spread in
India [17]. More recently a model consisting of a set of delay differential equations was
written down which includes all the new features mentioned above [18]. A simplified
version which is a logistic delay equation with the various features of the epidemic included
and particularly suitable for taking into account the interventions on the part of the
government ( e.g. imposition of lockdown, requirement of social distancing etc ) has been
studied in [19,20] . An interesting variant, starting from a different premise, is the work of
Cherednik [21] and a discussion of the early mathematical models pertaining to COVID -19
can be found in Ref [22]. A very early analysis of the importance of the asymptomatic
transmitters [23] in the South African context was done by Anguelov et al [ 24]. The most
detailed models are the agent-based models [30] which in principle can capture every aspect

3|P a g e

of this problem. However, they require a huge amount of computer time to be reasonably
useful.
As far as we can tell, maps have not been used to model this particular dynamic except for
the work of Jahedi and Yorke [25] where a one-dimensional non-autonomous logistic map
was used to suggest “the best pandemic models are the simplest”! In this work, we will write
down a Henon like map for the spreading of this infection with the existence of
asymptomatic but infected people taken into account. Our goal is simple. We want to point
out that the inclusion of the asymptomatic infected drastically alters the fixed-point
structure and clearly indicates the very important role of this hidden variable in the
transmission dynamics of this disease problem.

Fig 1a: - (Type 1 country) New Zealand daily cases.

Fig 1b: -(Type 2 country) Austria daily cases.

Looking at the first four months of the spread of this disease ( approximately from early
March 2020 to early July 2020 ) we find that for a large number of countries, the total
number N (t ) of infected people ( time is measured in days ) typically shows two different
kinds of behaviour. In both cases there is an initial fast rise. Subsequently ‘flattening of the
curve” occurs and the rate dN / dt ( physically the number of people infected on a given
day) deceases. In some cases ( Type -1 countries in our work) the rate actually goes to zero
and stays at zero for a few days and then starts rising again ( Fig 1a). In other cases ( we call
them Type -2 countries), dN / dt decreases to a very small value and remains at that small
number for a few weeks and then the slope changes to a larger value ( Fig 1b). In both cases
the day at which the slope starts increasing again (whether from zero or from a small
positive value) marks the end of “Phase -1” ( our terminology) of the spread of this disease.
After a brief lull, the number of infected persons has been rising very strongly again and this
is in our nomenclature Phase -2. It should be noted that several countries like South Africa,
USA, Mexico, Brazil and India have not reached the end of Phase -1 yet. However, countries
like South Africa, Brazil and India appear to head for a reasonable completion to Phase-1 in a
few months and we can make some predictions about them. Countries like USA have seen a
very strong resurgence in the number of cases well before the completion of Phase-1 and is
not a part of our modelling. Among the type -1 countries are New Zealand, Switzerland etc
and among the Type-2 countries are Austria, the Scandinavian countries, UK etc.

Fig 2 a: - We have N/Nmax of Austria in vertical axis
and t / t1/2 in horizontal axis.

Fig 2 b: - We have N/Nmax of New Zealand in
vertical axis and t / t1/2 in horizontal axis.

We focus on two specific countries ( one from Type-1 and the other from Type-2) in this
work which we take as New Zealand and Austria respectively. We now re-plot the N (t ) vs t
data in a scaled form in Fig 2. We look at the value N max of N (t ) which is the value at the
end of Phase -1. The ratio r = N / N max should not be sensitive to fluctuations in the testing
efficiency etc and should be a somewhat robust quantity. We plot it along the y-axis. Along
the x-axis we plot the number of “scaled” days. We do this scaling by taking the data from
day zero to the day when N = Nmax and defining a half way point as t1/2 the day where

N = Nmax / 2 . The variable  = t / t1/2 is what we call “scaled “days and this is our x-axis. We
will resort to this type of plotting in Sec IV.
In Fig 2 we show r vs.  for New Zealand and Austria and note that the primary difference
is when the number of infections have become high ( r > 0.5). We attribute this
fundamental difference between Type -1 and Type-2 largely to the ratio of asymptomatic
carriers to symptomatic ones. In Sec.II we set up a Henon map to describe the propagation
of the epidemic and in Sec.III discuss its fixed points and stabilities. We present the time
series from the map in Sec.IV and give a brief conclusion. Some technical issues are
discussed in Appendix A.

2.Basic model of Henon map:
On any given day we consider the population to consist of four distinct sets of people. The set {X}
consists of people who can be infected. The set {Y} consists of people who have been infected but
are asymptomatic while the set {Z} comprises the infected but symptomatic. The fourth set {Q}
consists of people who are self-quarantined or hospitalized and are no longer part of the process.
Instead of dealing with the actual number for each set we will consider the fractions obtained by
dividing by the total population. We ignore the deaths which so far has fortunately been a very small
fraction. We take three kinds of people at large on the n-th day– the healthy fraction, the
asymptomatic infected fraction and the symptomatic infected fraction. The fourth fraction is not an
active part of the dynamics. For practical purposes we identify {Y} as the set of people who are
infected and hence transmitters but have not been tested as they have no symptoms. The set {Z}
consists of those who have symptoms and have tested positive. We want to know how the fraction

yn of infected but untested since asymptomatic people on day ‘n’ changes on day ‘n+1’. The
fraction yn will increase due to interaction of a member of set {X} with a member of set {Y} or {Z}.
We assume that these interactions change {X} to {Y} with a probability p and to {Z} with probability

1 − p . We also assume that the frequency of these interactions are proportional to xn yn and xn zn
respectively. We assume that yn will decrease as the asymptomatic people get cured and also if
there is an interaction between a member of set {Y} and a member of {Z}with a small probability of
sending people to the {Z } class. This frequency we take to be proportional to yn zn . There will be
some loss in yn due to recovery from infection and also may be due to contact tracing ( the contact
tracing effect for no symptom people is negligible in reality ) as well and subsequent removal from
the set {Y}. Thus, we get
𝑦𝑛+1 = 𝑦𝑛 + 𝑝(𝑎𝑥𝑛 𝑦𝑛 + 𝑏𝑥𝑛 𝑧𝑛 ) − 𝑐𝑦𝑛 𝑧𝑛 − 𝑙𝑦𝑛

(1)

The number of people in the set {Z} increases with probability 1 − p due to interactions between {X}
and {Y} and between {X} and {Z}.It is possible that it can also increase due to interaction between
{Y} and {Z} mentioned above. The loss in the number in this category is due to removal from scene
on testing positive and recovery. We have
𝑧𝑛+1 = 𝑧𝑛 + (1 − 𝑝)[𝑎𝑥𝑛 𝑦𝑛 + 𝑏𝑥𝑛 𝑧𝑛 ] + 𝑐𝑦𝑛 𝑧𝑛 − 𝑓𝑧𝑛

(2)

It should be noted that the difference between ′𝑙′ and ′𝑓′ is a measure of the government’s
intervention. In general f would be somewhat higher because it is easier to quarantine the
symptomatics but ′𝑙′ can become significant if the number of asymptomatics is higher and the
government does a good job of tracing them quickly. Finally, we have the quarantined set {Q} who
acquire people from the set {Z} and {Y} and through treatment or self-recovery ultimately restore
(this effect we are not interested in because the set {Q} takes no active part in the dynamics) people
to the healthy set X over a long-time scale. Consequently,

qn+1 = qn + fzn + lyn − dqn

(3)

6|P a g e

with the coefficient d much smaller than the other coefficients. The change in xn occurs because
of its interactions with {Y} and (Z)

xn+1 = xn − (axn yn + bxn zn ) + dqn

(4)

ensuring the conservation law (since deaths have been ignored)

xn + yn + zn + qn = 1

(5)

At this point it is reasonable to assume that the qn is composed of some fraction of yn and some
fraction of zn so that we can write using two coefficients 1 and  2

qn =  2 zn + 1 yn

(6)

This makes our conservation law constraint give

xn = = 1 − (1 + 1) yn − (1 +  2 ) zn

(7)

We still have one more factor to contend with – the fact that the symptomatic patient may not be
symptomatic for two to three days. This implies that the terms xn zn , xn yn and also the term yn zn
must be augmented by terms such as xn−1zn−1, xn−2 zn−2 , xn−1 yn−1, xn−2 yn−2 , yn−1zn−1, yn−2 zn−2 etc .
Instead of considering both subscripts n − 1 and n − 2 , we consider only one term namely with
subscript n − 1 with an effective coefficient. We will refer to these terms with subscript n − 1 as
“delay” terms. The term xn ( yn +  zn ) will now be augmented by  xn−1 ( yn−1 +  zn−1 ) . We define b=

 a , c = a , l =  a and f = a so that “a” can be an adjustable scale parameter. Finally, we have
our version of the Henon map as
𝑦𝑛+1 = 𝑦𝑛 + 𝑎𝑝[𝑦𝑛 + 𝜂𝑧𝑛 ][1 − (1 + 𝛼1 )𝑦𝑛 − (1 + 𝛼2 )𝑧𝑛 ] + 𝑎𝑝𝜀[1 − (1 + 𝛼1 )𝑦𝑛−1 − (1 +
𝛼2 )𝑧𝑛−1 ][𝑦𝑛−1 + 𝜂𝑧𝑛−1 ] − 𝑎𝛽𝑦𝑛 𝑧𝑛 − 𝑎𝛽𝜀𝑦𝑛−1 𝑧𝑛−1 − 𝑎𝜇𝑦𝑛
(8)
𝑧𝑛+1 = 𝑧𝑛 + 𝑎(1 − 𝑝)[𝑦𝑛 + 𝜂𝑧𝑛 ][1 − (1 + 𝛼1 )𝑦𝑛 − (1 + 𝛼2 )𝑧𝑛 ] + 𝑎(1 − 𝑝)𝜀[1 − (1 + 𝛼1 )𝑦𝑛−1 −
(1 + 𝛼2 )𝑧𝑛−1 ][𝑦𝑛−1 + 𝜂𝑧𝑛−1 ] + 𝑎𝛽𝑦𝑛 𝑧𝑛 + 𝜀𝑎𝛽𝑦𝑛−1 𝑧𝑛−1 − 𝑎𝛾𝑧𝑛
(9)
The parameter  is expected to be much smaller than unity in the above equations. This factor
comes from the possibility of an asymptomatic person becoming symptomatic on receiving more of
the virus through an interaction with a symptomatic. The parameter  which describes the effect of
delayed appearance of symptoms will have to be significantly smaller than unity. We define

1 = 1 + 1,2 = 1 +  2 for subsequent use.

III Fixed points and their stabilities
We begin by looking at the fixed points ( y* , z * ) of the map written down in Eqs (8) and (9).
These are the quantities of primary interest in the sense that z* denotes the total fraction
of the symptomatic infected population in the full course of the epidemic which is obtained
simply by testing symptomatic people for the virus. If P is the total population of the region
considered ( city , state , country etc), then z = N / P and the ratio r introduced in the
previous section is r = z / z* . Similarly, the fraction of infected but asymptomatic people is

Na / P where N a is the actual number people of this variety. The fixed point y *
corresponds to the maximum value of the asymptomatic infected. The ratio A = y* / z* is a
very important parameter of the problem but not easily amenable to direct measurement.
We will see that A can be inferred from the time series of the variable z . We begin by
examining the fixed points of the map.
The fixed points ( y0 , z0 ) of the map given by Eqs (8) and (9) are found from the following
relations
𝛽

𝜇

(1 + 𝜀)𝑦0 (1 − 𝜂1 𝑦0 ) − (1 + 𝜀)[𝜂𝜂1 + 𝜂2 + 𝑝 ]𝑦𝑜 𝑧0 − 𝑝 𝑦0 + 𝜂(1 + 𝜀)𝑧0 − 𝜂𝜂2 (1 + 𝜀)𝑧0 2 = 0 (10)
And
(1 + 𝜀)𝑦0 (1 − 𝜂1 𝑦0 ) + (1 + 𝜀)[

− 𝜂𝜂1 − 𝜂2 ]𝑦0 𝑧0 + [𝜂(1 + 𝜀) −

𝛾
1−𝑝

]𝑧0 − 𝜂𝜂2 (1 + 𝜀)𝑧0 2 = 0

(11)

The stability of a fixed point ( y0 , z0 ) can be found from the following set of equations obtained by
linearizing the dynamics around the fixed point
𝛿𝑦𝑛+1 = [1 + 𝑎𝑝(1 − 𝜂1 𝑦0 − 𝜂2 𝑧0 ) − 𝑎𝑝𝜂1 (𝑦0 + 𝜂𝑧0 ) − 𝑎𝛽𝑧0 − 𝑎𝜇]𝛿𝑦𝑛 +
𝑎[𝜂𝑝(1 − 𝜂1 𝑦0 − 𝜂2 𝑧0 ) − 𝜂2 𝑝(𝑦0 + 𝜂𝑧0 ) − 𝛽𝑦0 ]𝛿𝑧𝑛 − 𝜀𝑎𝑝[𝜂1 (𝜂𝑧0 + 𝑦0 ) − (1 − 𝜂1 𝑦0 − 𝜂2 𝑧0 ) +
(𝛽/𝑝)𝑧0 ]𝛿𝑦𝑛−1 + 𝜀𝑎[𝑝𝜂(1 − 𝜂1 𝑦0 − 𝜂2 𝑧0 ) − 𝑝𝜂2 (𝑦0 + 𝜂𝑧0 ) − 𝛽𝑦0 ]𝛿𝑧𝑛−1
(12)
𝛿𝑧𝑛+1 = 𝑎[(1 − 𝑝){1 − 𝜂1 𝑦0 − 𝜂2 𝑧0 − 𝜂1 (𝑦0 + 𝜂𝑧0 )} + 𝛽𝑧0 ]𝛿𝑦𝑛 + {1 + 𝜂𝑎(1 − 𝑝)[1 − 𝜂1 𝑦0 −
𝜂2 𝑧0 ] − 𝑎(1 − 𝑝)𝜂2 (𝑦0 + 𝜂𝑧0 ) + 𝑎𝛽𝑦0 − 𝑎𝛾}𝛿𝑧𝑛 𝑎{𝜀(1 − 𝑝)[1 − 𝜂1 𝑦0 − 𝜂2 𝑧0 ] + 𝛽𝜀𝑧0 − (1 −
𝑝)𝜀(𝑦0 + 𝜂𝑧0 )𝜂1 }𝛿𝑦𝑛−1 + 𝑎{𝜀(1 − 𝑝)[1 − 𝜂1 𝑦0 − 𝜂2 𝑧0 ] + 𝛽𝜀𝑦0 − (1 − 𝑝)𝜀(𝑦0 + 𝜂𝑧0 )𝜂2 }𝛿𝑧𝑛−1
(13)
It is clear from Eqs (10) and (11) that there are four fixed points in general. One of them is easy to
read off. It is the fixed point (0,0). The dynamics around it is obtained from Eqs (12) and (13) as
𝛿𝑦𝑛+1 = (1 + 𝑎𝑝 − 𝑎𝜇)𝛿𝑦𝑛 + 𝑎𝜀𝑝𝛿𝑦𝑛−1 + 𝑎𝑝𝜂𝛿𝑧𝑛 + 𝜀𝜂𝑎𝑝𝛿𝑧𝑛−1

(14)

𝛿𝑧𝑛+1 = 𝑎(1 − 𝑝)𝛿𝑦𝑛 + [1 + 𝜂𝑎(1 − 𝑝) − 𝑎𝛾]𝛿𝑧𝑛 + 𝜀𝑎(1 − 𝑝)𝛿𝑧𝑛−1 + 𝜀𝑎(1 − 𝑝)𝛿𝑦𝑛−1

(15)

and

8|P a g e

Trying the solutions  yn = A and  zn = B , where A,B are constant coefficients and
n

n

 is the

growth rate or the ‘eigenvalue”, we get after elimination of A and B,
{𝜆2 − 𝜆[1 + 𝑎(𝑝 − 𝜇)] − 𝑎𝜀𝑝]}{𝜆2 − 𝜆[1 − 𝑎𝛾 + 𝑎𝜂(1 − 𝑝)] − 𝜀𝑎(1 − 𝑝)] − 𝑎2 𝜂𝑝(1 − 𝑝)(𝜆 + 𝜀)2 = 0 (16)

The above is a quartic equation for the eigenvalue  whose magnitude has to exceed unity for the
destabilization of the fixed point. In the absence of delayed response i.e. the small parameter  set
exactly equal to zero, two roots are zero which says that for small  , these two roots will be O ( )
and hence play no role in the stability analysis. We obtain the other two roots at
quadratic equation

 = 0 from the

𝜆2 − 𝜆[2 − 𝑎𝛾 + 𝑎𝜂(1 − 𝑝) + 𝑎(𝑝 − 𝜇)] + 1 − 𝑎𝛾 + 𝑎𝜂(1 − 𝑝)(1 − 𝑎𝜇) + 𝑎(𝑝 − 𝜇)(1 − 𝑎𝛾) = 0

(17)

For instability, we need the magnitude of  to be greater than unity and from the above
quadratic equation for  , this turns out to be
𝛾(𝑝 − 𝜇) + 𝜇𝜂(1 − 𝑝) > 0

(18)

The above condition is very important. Our primary focus in this work is the stability of the non-zero
fixed point since we want to see how the number of infected people reaches a saturation value. But
in the normal course of an epidemic it is clear that the end point is a return to the healthy state
when all the infected people have been cured. The above condition tells us how that happens. Once
we are very close to the non-trivial fixed point there will be extremely few people getting infected
and consequently the recovery rates will be higher and also the probability of producing
asymptomatics will go down and the above inequality will be violated allowing the origin to become
a stable fixed point. The trivial (no infected people) and non-trivial (finite number of infected people)
fixed points have finite basins of attraction in the parameter space and small changes in parameters
( which will happen when one is not encountering new cases of infection ) can take one from the
vicinity of one to the other.
To understand the role of the delay terms which are the terms with the small parameter  in the
coefficient, it suffices to consider the model with no asymptomatic patients. In other words, we set

y = 0 and work only with the variable z . We now have (defining a (1 − p) =  , a =  ,1 +  2 = 

zn+1 = zn (1 −  ) +  [ zn (1 − zn ) +  zn−1(1 − zn−1)]
For

(19)

 = 0 this is the standard logistic map. For   0 , we can call it a logistic map with delay. There
*

are two fixed points of this map given by x1 =0 (the trivial fixed point) and

x2* = [ (1 +  ) −  ] /  (1 +  ) (the non-trivial fixed point). The trivial fixed point is unstable if
 (1 +  )   . The nontrivial fixed point is the saturation fraction of infected people if there are no
asymptomatics. The eigenvalue for this fixed point is 1 +  −  (1 +  ) which has to be less than
unity for stability of the fixed point. This fixed point corresponding to a finite number of infected
people will be approached more slowly as the parameters become such that the eigenvalue heads
towards −1 . A finite value of  ( by definition a positive quantity) takes the eigenvalue closer to −1

9|P a g e

and thus delays the approach to saturation. Hence the physical role of the “delay” is to slow down
the approach to the stabilization point which is the “end “of the infection.
We point out as an aside that the fixed point is destabilized if  (1 +  )  2 −  and a two-cycle
emerges. A change of variable casts Eq. (19) in the more recognizable form

un+1 =  [un (1 − un ) +  un−1(1 − un−1)]

(20)

 = 0 , the well-studied Feigenbaum map where the trivial fixed point is destabilized at
 = 1 and the non-trivial fixed point is destabilized at  = 3 giving rise to a two-cycle. The two
cycle is de-stabilized at  = 6 + 1 and a cascade of period-doubling bifurcations follow leading to
an onset of chaos at   3.5699 . The same period doubling sequence is seen in Eq. (20) and is dealt
This is for

with in Appendix A which concentrates on the role of the delay.
Having understood the role of the small parameter
dynamics of Eqs (8) and (9) by setting

 in the dynamics, we can now simplify the

 = 0 . We also need to reduce the number of free

parameters. The constant 1 which is a small appears in the combination 1 + 1 and then 1 can be
dropped. The constant  2 , on the other hand, is O(1) and we will set it equal to unity. The
parameter  has been introduced to account for any difference between the nature of interaction
between a healthy person and a symptomatic infected and a healthy person and an asymptomatic
infected. As of now, this difference is not established and we will set  = 1 . Our system
consequently reduces to

yn+1 = yn + ap( yn + zn )(1 − yn − 2 zn ) − a yn zn − a yn

(21)

zn+1 = zn + a(1 − p)( yn + zn )(1 − yn − 2 zn ) + a yn zn − a zn

(22)

The parameter a can be thought of as an overall scale factor that sets the time scale. The parameter
p is the probability of producing an asymptomatic infected person ( 1 − p is the probability of
producing a symptomatic infected person), the parameter  is the strength of the interaction
between an asymptomatic and a symptomatic infected person with the interaction strength
between a healthy and infected ( either variety ) set to unity. This parameter is expected to be small.
The parameter  is the recovery rate combined with the quarantining on detection rate for the
symptomatic infected while the parameter  is a measure of the recovery rate of the asymptomatic
infected . Having understood the qualitative effect of the delayed appearance of symptoms we have
deliberately kept the small parameter  out the present discussion.
A constraint on the non-trivial fixed points is obtained from Eqs (21) and (22) as (for z0  0 )

z0 =

 y0 (1 − p )
p −  y0

(23)

If  → 0 , then z0  0 implies y0 =  p /  and if  → 0 , we end up with

10 | P a g e

z0 =

 y0 (1 − p)
p

(24)

Use of Eq.(23) leads to the cubic equation given by
2𝛽 2 𝑧03 − 𝑧02 [𝛽2 (1 − 𝑝𝛾) − 3𝛽𝛾𝑝 − 4𝜇𝛽(1 − 𝑝)] − 𝑧0 [𝛾𝑝(𝛽 − 𝑝𝛾) + 2𝜇𝛽(1 − 𝑝) − 3𝜇𝛾𝑝(1 − 𝑝)
−2𝜇2 (1 − 𝑝)2 − 𝜇𝛽𝛾𝑝(1 − 𝑝) − 𝜇𝛽𝛾] − 𝜇𝛾𝑝(1 − 𝑝) + 𝜇2 (1 − 𝑝)(𝛾𝑝 − 1 + 𝑝) = 0 (25)
The above cubic equation is not very transparent. The parameter  is small but it quantifies an
effect that has not been considered before. Its role can be examined best by studying the limit
 → 0 . We will return to this speculative situation in a later publication. In the rest of this work we
focus on  = 0 .
This leads to the dynamical system

yn+1 = yn + ap( yn + zn )(1 − yn − 2 zn ) − a yn

(26a)

zn+1 = zn + a(1 − p)( yn + zn )(1 − yn − 2 zn ) − a zn

(26b)

The fixed points ( y0 , z0 ) satisfy the constraint shown in Eq. (24) and now apart from the origin
there is only one non-trivial fixed point which is given b
𝜇(1−𝑝)

𝑧0 = 𝑝𝛾+2𝜇(1−𝑝) ×

𝜇(1−𝑝)+𝛾(𝑝−𝜇)
𝜇(1−𝑝)+𝑝𝛾

(27)

To examine the stability of this fixed point, we need to linearize Eqs (26a) and (26b) about this fixed
point and the eigenvalue  (instability if |  | 1 ) satisfies

 2 − Tr + Det = 0

(28)

with

Tr = 2 − a( +  ) + a[ p(1 − 2 y0 − 3z0 ) + (1 − p)(1 − 3 y0 − 4 z0 )]

Det = (1 − a )2 + a(1 − a )[ p(1 − 2 y0 − 3z0 ) + (1 − p)(1 − 3 y0 − 4 z0 )]

The instability condition is Tr  1 + Det and so long as the parameters are chosen such that the
fixed point is stable, the evolution with the dynamics shown in Eqs (26a) and (26b) will give us the
transmission dynamics of the type shown in Figs 2a and 2b. This is what we discuss in the next
section.

IV. Evolution of the Henon map trajectories and comparison with the
trajectories of COVID-19 transmission
In this section we show the relevance of the Henon map shown in Eqs (26a) and (26b) by
plotting the total fraction ( zn / z0 )of population who are infected and symptomatic ( this is
the number who test positive for COVID-19) against the number of iterations n which
corresponds to the number of days. The parameters have to be such that zn / z0 starts from
a very small initial value (start of the epidemic) and then saturates at unity (reaches the
fixed point of evolution). We have four parameters in our model of which a is an overall
scale factor for the duration of the evolution we will fix at unity for now (it will need to be
adjusted when confronting real data). Thus, we need to vary three parameters p,  ,  to get
a feeling for how the evolution occurs. We present results for different parameter values in
Figs (3-5).

p=0.5, 𝛾 = 0.5, a = 0.5

The above evolution figures clearly indicate the following
From Figs (3) and (4), we see that with all other parameters remaining the same the parameter ‘a’
determines how spread out the evolution of the disease will be. This is natural as it was cast as an
almost overall scale factor in Eqs (8) and (9). It is clear from Figs (3) and (5) that the parameter ‘p’
determines the initial growth rate. Larger the value of ‘p’, we expect from Eqs (8) and (9), that in the
initial stages when the values of ‘y’ and ‘z’ are small the growth rate is proportional to (1-p) for the
symptomatic patients. It is also apparent from Figs (3) and (5), that the saturation ratio of
asymptomatic to symptomatic patients increases as the value of ‘p’ increases as seen clearly from
Eq. (24). We also note that the removal rate ‘gamma’ of the symptomatic patients from the scene is
vital in slowing down the spread of the disease. We see repeatedly from Figs 3-5 that if gamma is
greater than mu, the saturation is reached faster for the symptomatic infected fraction. Thus, we
establish the first two points mentioned in the abstract.
We now actually seek the parameter values which give a good description of the evolution of the
pandemic in New Zealand and Austria. The results are shown in Figs 6 (Austria) and 7 (New Zealand).
We have shown these plots against the scaled variable  = t / t1/2 which we discussed in Sec I. This
has the advantage of comparing the time evolutions of the two nations easily. It is clear from a study
of Figs 6 and 7 that the pandemic saturates in New Zealand significantly faster than in Austria. It is
also clear from these figures that for low values of  the course of evolution is not too different
from the absence of this effect

Given that we can find the evolution of the epidemic in Phase 1, the question arises –can we predict
the course of the evolution for those countries which are yet to complete phase 1. This can be done
by estimating the parameter “p” from the initial growth rate and since this corresponds to a ratio
p / (1 − p ) significantly greater than unity we use the curve for Austria as a universal curve to predict
the future of the pandemic in India. We estimate that the t1/2 corresponds to the last week of
September 2020 and from that , using the logic of Sec I , conclude that the number would reach an
6
end of phase-1 value of (12.5  0.7) 10 in the middle of March 2021. Thus, we arrive at the last

point of our abstract. This should be compared with the result obtained by the SEIR model used by
Agarwal et al [26]. We would like to point out that similar results have been obtained in our case
with a far fewer number of parameters.
In conclusion we would like to point out that the technique used so far in modelling the Covid-19
dynamics have been SEIR models [26][27][28], delay differential equations [29] and the computer
intensive agent-based model [30]. We present an alternative approach using maps which appears to
be successful for the phase 1 of the disease spread.

Appendix A:

A logistic map with delay

We return to the Henon map as written down in Eqs. (8) and (9) and change it to a onedimensional system by ignoring the presence of asymptomatics – this makes the system
𝑧𝑛+1 = 𝑧𝑛 + 𝑎(1 − 𝑝)𝜂[𝑧𝑛 (1 − 𝜂2 𝑧𝑛 ) + 𝜀𝑧𝑛−1 (1 − 𝜂2 𝑧𝑛−1 )] − 𝑎𝛾𝑧𝑛

(A1)

The right-hand side has linear and quadratic terms in zn and zn−1 we can carry out usual
rescaling to write the system as
𝑢𝑛+1 = 𝜌[𝑢𝑛 (1 − 𝑢𝑛 ) + 𝑐𝜀𝑢𝑛−1 (1 − 𝑑𝑢𝑛−1 )]

(A2)

Without any loss of generality, we can set the numbers c and d equal to unity and work with the
map (a different variation of a logistic map with delay)

un+1 = [un (1 − un ) +  un−1(1 − un−1)]
The fixed points of this map are u0 = 0 and u0 = 1 −

. Straightforward algebra shows that
 (1 +  )

the former is destabilized for   (1 +  )−1 . As for the latter, it is destabilized for

  1 = (3 −  ) / (1 −  2 ) , which can be shown by writing un = u0 +  un in Eq (A3) and linearising
the resulting equation in  un . This yield

 un+1 =  (1 − 2u0 )( un +  un−1)
Writing the increment  un as A n , we have

2 = (

(A5)

Instability occurs when  = −1 and gives the above value of 1 .
We now show that the state for   1 is a periodic state of period 2 which can be represented as

un = A + (−)n B . Inserting this form in Eq. (A3) and equating terms with coefficient unity and terms
with coefficient ( − ) on either side of the resulting equation we obtain

(A7)

As expected Eq (A5) shows that the two cycle comes into existence at  = 1 = (3 −  ) / (1 −  2 ) ,
the point where the fixed point loses stability. If we keep increasing the value of  , we anticipate
that the two cycle loses stability and to obtain the critical value  2 for this to happen , we set

un = A + ( − ) B +  un where  un is an infinitesimal perturbation and ask for the linearized
n

dynamics of  un . This leads to

 un+1 = [1 − 2{A + ( − ) B}] un + [1 − 2{A + ( − )

(A8)

We define C = 1 − 2( A − B) and D = 1 − 2( A + B ) . Anticipating that the 2-cycle will lose stability
to a 4-cycle, we use n = 2m + 1, 2m, 2m − 1 and 2m − 2 obtain (to linear order)

 u2m+2 = C u2m+1 +  D u2m

(A9a)

 u2m+1 =  D u2m + Cu2m−1

(A9b)

 u2m = C u2m−1 +  D u2m−2

(A9c)

 u2m−1 =  D u2m−2 + C u2m−3

(A9d)

Our aim is to write a “period-doubled” form of Eq (A4) where we relate the (2n + 2) th increment to
the 2n th and (2n − 2) th ones. We find from the above set

 u2n+2 = [  2CD +  D] u2n +  3C 2 D u2n−2

(A10)

This is the period doubled form of Eq (A4) and the growth rate  is given by

(

)

 2 =  2CD +  D  +  3C 2 D

(A11)

Correct to O ( ) , the critical value  2 for the onset of the 4-cycle ( obtained by setting  = −1 ) is

2 = 6 + 1 −

+ O( 2 )

(A12)

The onset point for chaos through period doubling can be found by noting that two successive
doublings follow from the conditions ( for   1) from 2 −  − 1 = −1 and

4 − 2 − 22 + 22 = −1 . The merging of two successive bifurcations ( the onset of infinite period
which is equivalent to onset of chaos ) would consequently occur (to O ( ) ) for

4 − c2 + 2c − 2 = 2(1 −  )2 − c (1 −  )

 = c where

(A13)

To the lowest order in  , the onset of chaos occurs at

c =

(A14)

We show below the 2-cycle at  = 3.02 , the 4-cycle at  = 3.48 and chaos at  = 3.68 for  = 0.1
. It is interesting that while the onset of two cycle and four cycle is slightly delayed at O ( ) ,the
onset of period doubling chaos is slightly delayed beyond its  = 0 value.
From Eq. A1 We get the following interesting curves:
