Abstract
We model the COVID-19 coronavirus epidemic in China. We use early reported case data to
predict the cumulative number of reported cases to a final size. The key features of our model are
the timing of implementation of major public policies restricting social movement, the identification
and isolation of unreported cases, and the impact of asymptomatic infectious cases.

Introduction

Many mathematical models of the COVID-19 coronavirus epidemic in China have been developed,
and some of these are listed in our references [4, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. We develop here a
model describing this epidemic, focused on the effects of the Chinese government imposed public policies
designed to contain this epidemic, and the number of reported and unreported cases that have occurred.
Our model here is based on our model of this epidemic in [5], which was focused on the early phase of
this epidemic (January 20 through January 29) in the city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the early outbreak.
During this early phase, the cumulative number of daily reported cases grew exponentially. In [5], we
identified a constant transmission rate corresponding to this exponential growth rate of the cumulative
reported cases, during this early phase in Wuhan.
On January 23, 2020, the Chinese government imposed major public restrictions on the population
of Wuhan. Soon after, the epidemic in Wuhan passed beyond the early exponential growth phase, to a
phase with slowing growth. In this work, we assume that these major government measures caused the
transmission rate to change from a constant rate to a time dependent exponentially decreasing rate. We
identify this exponentially decreasing transmission rate based on reported case data after January 29.
We then extend our model of the epidemic to the central region of China, where most cases occurred.
Within just a few days after January 29, our model can be used to project the time-line of the model
forward in time, with increasing accuracy, to a final size.

This system is supplemented by initial data
S(t0 ) = S0 > 0, I(t0 ) = I0 > 0, R(t0 ) = 0 and U (t0 ) = U0 ≥ 0.

(2.2)

Here t ≥ t0 is time in days, t0 is the beginning date of the model of the epidemic, S(t) is the number of
individuals susceptible to infection at time t, I(t) is the number of asymptomatic infectious individuals
at time t, R(t) is the number of reported symptomatic infectious individuals at time t, and U (t) is the
number of unreported symptomatic infectious individuals at time t.
Asymptomatic infectious individuals I(t) are infectious for an average period of 1/ν days. Reported
symptomatic individuals R(t) are infectious for an average period of 1/η days, as are unreported symptomatic individuals U (t). We assume that reported symptomatic infectious individuals R(t) are reported
and isolated immediately, and cause no further infections. The asymptomatic individuals I(t) can also
be viewed as having a low-level symptomatic state. All infections are acquired from either I(t) or U (t)
individuals.
The parameters of the model are listed in Table 1 and a schematic diagram of the model is given in
Figure 1.

Model parameters

We assume f = 0.8, which means that 20% of symptomatic infectious cases go unreported. We
assume η = 1/7, which means that the average period of infectiousness of both unreported symptomatic
infectious individuals and reported symptomatic infectious individuals is 7 days. We assume ν = 1/7,
which means that the average period of infectiousness of asymptomatic infectious individuals is 7 days.
These values can be modified as further epidemiological information becomes known.
In our previous work, we assumed that in the early phase of the epidemic (January 20 through
January 29), the cumulative number of reported cases grew approximately exponentially, according to
the formula:
CR(t) = χ1 exp(χ2 t) − χ3 , t ≥ t0
with values χ1 = 0.16, χ2 = 0.38, χ3 = 1.1. These values of χ1 , χ2 , and χ3 were fitted to reported case
data from January 20 to January 29. We assumed the initial value S0 = 11, 000, 000, the population of
the city Wuhan, which was the epicenter of the epidemic outbreak. The other initial conditions are

These parameter formulas were derived in [5].
After January 23, strong government measures in all of China, such as isolation, quarantine, and
public closings, strongly impacted the transmission of new cases. The actual effects of these measures
were complex, and we use an exponential decrease for the transmission rate τ (t) to incorporate these
effects after the early exponential increase phase. The formula for τ (t) during the exponential decreasing
phase was derived by a fitting procedure. The formula for τ (t) is
(
τ (t) = τ0 , 0 ≤ t ≤ 24,
(4.1)
τ (t) = τ0 exp (−µ (t − 24)) , 24 < t,
where January 24 and µ = 0.12 are fitted from on-going reported case data after January 24. In Figure

Model simulation

We numerically simulated the model (2.1) to project forward in time the time-line of the epidemic
after the government imposed interventions. We set τ (t) in (4.1) to S0 τ (t)/1, 400, 050, 000, where S0 =
11, 000, 000 and 1, 400, 050, 000 is the population of mainland China, excluding Hong Kong, Macao and
Taiwan. We set S(t0 ) in (2.2) to 1, 400, 050, 000. We set t0 = 5.0, I(t0 ) = 3.7, U (t0 ) = 0.2 and R(t0 ) = 0.
In Figure 4, we plot the graphs of CR(t) (cumulative reported cases), CU (t) (cumulative unreported
cases), R(t), and U (t) from the numerical simulation.

In Figure 5 we plot the graphs of the reported cases R(t) and the infectious pre-symptomatic cases

turning point of the day by day weekly reported data is approximately day 38.
Our model transmission rate τ (t) can be modified to illustrate the effects of an earlier or later implementation of the major public policy interventions that occurred in this epidemic. The implementation
one week earlier (24 is replaced by 17 in (4.1)) is graphed in Figure 6 (top). All other parameters and
the initial conditions remain the same. The total reported cases is approximately 4, 500 and the total
unreported cases is approximately 1, 100. The implementation one week later (24 is replaced by 31 in
(4.1)) is graphed in Figure 6 (bottom). The total reported cases is approximately 820, 000 and the total
unreported cases is approximately 200, 000. The timing of the institution of major social restrictions is
critically important in mitigating the epidemic.

Figure 6: Graphs of CR(t) (black), CU (t) (green), U (t) (blue), and R(t) (red). Top: The major public
policy interventions were implemented one week earlier (January 17). Bottom: The major public policy
interventions were implemented one week later (February 1). The one week earlier implementation
resulted in a final size of approximately 5, 750 total cases, with turning point day 34 = February 3. The
one week later implementation resulted in a final size of approximately 1, 234, 000 total cases, with turning
point day 47 = February 16.
The number of unreported cases is of major importance in understanding the evolution of an epidemic,
and involves great difficulty in their estimation. The data from January 20 to February 15 for reported
cases in Table 2, was only for tested cases. Between February 11 and February 15, additional clinically
diagnosed case data, based on medical imaging showing signs of pneumonia, was also reported by the
Chinese CDC. Since February 16, only tested case data has been reported by the Chinese CDC, because
new NHC guidelines removed the clinically diagnosed category. Thus, after February 15, there is a gap
in the reported case data that we used up to February 15. The uncertainty of the number of unreported
cases for this epidemic includes this gap, but goes even further to include additional unreported cases.
We assumed previously that the fraction f of reported cases was f = 0.8 and the fraction of unreported
cases was 1 − f = 0.2. Our model formulation can be applied with varying values for the fraction f . In
Figure 7, we provide illustrations with the fraction f = 0.4 (top) and f = 0.6 (bottom). The formula
for the time dependent transmission rate τ (t) in (4.1) involves a new value for τ0 and µ for each case.
The final size of the epidemic when f = 0.4 is approximately 164,700 cases, and the final size of the
epidemic when f = 0.6 is approximately 110,700 cases. From these simulations, we see that estimation
of the number of unreported cases has major importance in understanding the severity of this epidemic.

I(t0 ) = 7.32, U (t0 ) = 1.20, R(t0 ) = 0.0, and the basic reproductive number is R0 = 5.03. The final
size of the epidemic is approximately 65, 900 reported cases, approximately 98, 800 unreported cases, and
approximately 164, 700 total cases. The turning point of the epidemic is approximately day 41 = February
10. Bottom: f = 0.6, t0 = 5.0, τ0 = 4.254 × 10−8 , µ = 0.123, I(t0 ) = 4.88, U (t0 ) = 0.53, R(t0 ) = 0.0,
and the basic reproductive number is R0 = 4.25. The final size of the epidemic is approximately 66, 500
reported cases, approximately 44, 300 unreported cases, and approximately 110, 800 total cases. The
turning point of the epidemic is approximately day 41 = February 10.
The number of days an asymptomatic infected individual is infectious is uncertain. We simulate in
Figure 8 the model with ν = 1/3, which means that asymptomatic infected individuals are infectious
on average 3 days before becoming symptomatic. The result is a small decrease in the final size of the
epidemic, as compared to the case that ν = 1/7.

We illustrate the importance of the level of government imposed public restrictions by decreasing the
value of µ in formula (4.1) for τ (t). In Figure 9 we set µ = 0.09 instead of µ = 0.12, and the result is a
significant increase in the number of cases.

Discussion

We have developed a model of the COVID-19 epidemic in China that incorporates key features
of this epidemic: (1) the importance of the timing and magnitude of the implementation of major
government public restrictions designed to mitigate the severity of the epidemic; (2) the importance of
both reported and unreported cases in interpreting the number of reported cases; and (3) the importance
of asymptomatic infectious cases in the disease transmission. In our model formulation, we divide
8

infectious individuals into asymptomatic and symptomatic infectious individuals. The symptomatic
infectious phase is also divided into reported and unreported cases. Our model formulation is based
on our work [5], in which we developed a method to estimate epidemic parameters at an early stage
of an epidemic, when the number of cumulative cases grows exponentially. The general method in [5],
was applied to the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan, China, to identify the constant transmission rate
corresponding to the early exponential growth phase.
In this work, we use the constant transmission rate in the early exponential growth phase of the
COVID-19 epidemic identified in [5]. We model the effects of the major government imposed public
restrictions in China, beginning on January 23, as a time-dependent exponentially decaying transmission
rate after January 24. With this time dependent exponentially decreasing transmission rate, we are able
to fit with increasing accuracy, our model simulations to the Chinese CDC reported case data for all of
China, forward in time through February 15, 2020.
Our model demonstrates the effects of implementing major government public policy measures. By
varying the date of the implementation of these measures in our model, we show that had implementation
occurred one week earlier, then a significant reduction in the total number of cases would have resulted.
We show that if these measures had occurred one week later, then a significant increase in the total
number of cases would have occurred. We also show that if these measures had been less restrictive on
public movement, then a significant increase in the total size of the epidemic would have occurred. It is
evident, that control of a COVID-19 epidemic is very dependent on an early implementation and a high
level of restrictions on public functions.
We varied the fraction of unreported cases involved in the transmission dynamics. We showed that if
this fraction is higher, then a significant increase in the number of total cases results. If it is lower, then
a significant reduction occurs. It is evident, that control of a COVID-19 epidemic is very dependent on
identifying and isolating symptomatic unreported infectious cases. We also decreased the parameter ν
(the reciprocal of the average period of asymptomatic infectiousness), and showed that the total number
of cases in smaller. It is also possible to decrease η (the reciprocal of the average period of unreported
symptomatic infectiousness), to obtain a similar result. It is evident that understanding of these periods
of infectiousness is important in understanding the total number of epidemic cases.
Our model was specified to the COVID-19 outbreak in China, but it is applicable to any outbreak
location for a COVID-19 epidemic.
