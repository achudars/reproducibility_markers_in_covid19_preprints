ABSTRACT
The recent zoonotic coronavirus virus outbreak of a novel type [COVID 19] has necessitated the
adequate understanding of the evolutionary pathway of zoonotic viruses which adversely affects
human populations for therapeutic constructs to combat the pandemic now and in the future. We
analyzed conserved domains of the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV2] for
possible targets of viral entry inhibition in host cells, evolutionary relationship of human
coronavirus [229E] and zoonotic coronaviruses with SAR-CoV2 as well as evolutionary
relationship between selected SARS-CoV 2 genomic data. Conserved domains with antagonistic
action on host innate antiviral cellular mechanisms in SARS-CoV 2 include nsp 11, nsp 13 etc.
Also, multiple sequence alignments of the spike [S] gene protein of selected candidate zoonotic
coronaviruses alongside the S gene protein of the SARs-CoV2 revealed closest evolutionary
relationship [95.6%] with pangolin coronaviruses [S] gene. Clades formed between Wuhan
SARS-CoV2 phylogeny data and five others suggests viral entry trajectory while revealing
genomic and protein SARS CoV 2 data from Philippines as early ancestors. Therefore,
phylogeny of SARS-CoV 2 genomic data suggests profiling in diverse populations with and

without the outbreak alongside migration history and racial background for mutation tracking
and dating of viral subtype divergence which is essential for effective management of present
and future zoonotic coronavirus outbreaks.

INTRODUCTION
Coronaviruses [CoVs] are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome
belonging to the Coronaviridae family [1]. CoVs are divided into alpha, beta, gamma, and delta
groups, and the beta group is further composed of A, B, C, and D subgroups [2]. The virus
belongs to the 2B group of the betacoronavirus family, which includes SARS-CoV and Middle
East respiratory syndrome coronavirus-MERS-CoV [3].Their entry into respiratory and
oesophageal routes accounts for mild to severe acute respiratory syndromes which has led to
global epidemics with high morbidity, mortality and immense economic losses in affected
human populations [4,5]. Encoded within the 3′ end of the viral genome are the four main
structural proteins of coronavirus particles : spike [S], membrane [M], envelope [E], and
nucleocapsid [N] [6] as shown in Fig 1 .Phylogenetic analyses of 15 human CoV whole
genomes revealed 2019 novel CoV genome shares highest nucleotide sequence identity with
SARS-CoV [79.7%] while its two evolutionarily conserved regions [envelope and nucleocapsid
proteins] had sequence homology of 96% and 89.6% with same respectively [3]. Hence, the
nomenclature for the novel type of the coronavirus outbreak. Surface proteins which sticks out
like crown tips [spikes] on coronaviruses binds to host cell receptors- angiotensin converting
enzyme 2 [ACE 2] in epithelial cells in hosts. The S1 subunit [N-terminal] of the surface protein
facilitates binding to the ACE2 receptor while the S2 subunit [C-terminal] mediates host cell
entry through the binding of the viral S protein to human dipeptidylpeptidase 4 [DPP4], marking

onset of infection [7, 8]. Interestingly, conserved domains of CoVs have been indicated in
literatures as vital entry targets in vaccine and drug development [9, 10].However, growing
variability and mutational changes in viruses can cause lack of specificity and reduce efficiency
of therapeutic measures. Recombination serves central function in virus replication and evolution
in viral infections such as HIV, Ebola, and MERS [11,12] while molecular mechanisms[RNA
fragmentation and trans-esterification reactions] are possible causes of RNA fragments ligation
and subsequent increased novel recombination frequency observed among various RNA viruses
[13]. Diverse host factors accounts for a great deal of genome variability in viral recombinants
which ranges from multi-resistance to evolutionary novelties [14]. The emergence of novel viral
variants trafficked by humans and animals alike through global travel has remained a constant
threat in public health and increasing complexity of host-viral interactivity in viral adaptation
and evolution [15 ].
Methods and materials
Comparison and analyses of conserved domain of 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 protein
Reference number [initial entry with refSeq number NC_045512.1] SARS-CoV2 was retrieved
from NBCI database and query for its conserved domains was launched using CDS resources.
Proteins with similar conserved domains were included in the subsequent multiple sequence
alignment of spike gene of zoonotic coronaviruses investigated in this study.

[https:// www.ebi.ac.uk/] with default parameters in Clustal W2 and Clustal Omega respectively.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Four out of 29 domain hits generated from 2019nCoV/SARS-CoV 2 CDD query were selected
based on the E-value scores [Table 1] . These are: non-structural protein [nsp 11], Coronavirus
RPolN terminus, non-structural protein [nsp 13], and Corona S2 super family. The region of
2019 nCoV domain which encodes nsp 11 spans from about 18046-19824bp.It was indicated in
countering host innate antiviral response via inhibition of type I interferon [IFN] production
using NendoU activity-dependent mechanisms in porcine reproductive syndrome viruses [16].
The nsp 11 is also associated with pathways such as programmed cell death evasion, mitogenactivated protein kinase signaling, histone-related, cell cycle and DNA replication and the
ubiquitin-proteasome through RNA microarray analysis [17,18,19,20] and few nsp 11 inhibitors
include papain-like proteinase[plPRO] and 3C-like main protease-3CLpro[21]. Coronavirus
RNA-directed RNA polymerase [RdRp] terminus covers the N-terminal region of the
coronavirus. It spans from about 13480-14538bp in SARS-CoV2 and its interaction with nsp3
has been indicated in viral replication especially during early onset of infection [22]. The
inhibitors of coronavirus RdRp include ATP inhibitors with mfScores lower than –110 [21]. The
nsp 13 is regarded as a highly conserved and multifunctional helicase unit and its spans from
about 20662-21537 in the SARS-CoV2 isolate [23]. They are SARS-CoV helicases that are
chiefly concerned with RNA processing, DNA replication, recombination and repair,
transcription and translation [24]. A few potential inhibitors of nsp13 have been identified
[25,26] and they act by interfering with its unwinding and ATPase activities. The Coronavirus S2

super family spans from 23546-25372 and forms the characteristic 'corona' after which the group
is named. CoV diversity is reflected in the variable spike proteins [S proteins] and evolves into
forms differing in receptor interactions and response to various environmental triggers of viruscell membrane fusion [27].The C-terminal [S2] domain directs ectodomain fusion of all CoVs
spike proteins following receptor binding [28,29]. The level of interactions between the S
protein and the virus receptor controls the host cell range [30]. A study showed a switch of
species

specificity via a mutant

mouse hepatitis virus[MHV] construct which conferred

horizontal gene transfer and ability to infect feline cells which were initially absent in wild MHV
cells [30]. This was achieved via the substitution of the spike glycoprotein ectodomain. Another
research [31] also indicated role of natural mutations in reactivity between the receptor binding
domain of spike and cross-neutralization between palm civet coronavirus and SARS-CoVs.

Protein phylogeny assembly of SARS-CoV2 isolates
Identification of the origin, natural host [s] and evolutionary pathway of viruses which causes
pandemics is essential to understand molecular mechanism of their cross-species interactivity
and implementation of a proper control measure [32]. Protein sequence alignment analyses
reveals the closest evolutionarily conservation between 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin
S protein with 95.6% similarity and 92.1% identity while 46.8% similarity and 31.2% identity

was observed between SARS-CoV-2 and Bat S protein [Supplementary File 2]. This finding
therefore agrees with reports indicating pangolin as a more recent ancestor of SARS-CoV2 than
bats [33, 34] which could have arisen as a result of recombination [chimera] or interactions
between Pangolin-CoV-like virus with a Bat-CoV-RaTG13-like virus going by the homology
and subclade of SARS-CoV 2 and pangolin S genes from Bat S-gene seen in this study [Fig 2].
Although, some computational analyses prediction of the improbability of direct binding
between receptor binding domains (RBDs) in SARS-CoV2 and ACE2 in humans suggests
otherwise [35,36], studies have shown demonstrations of cross-species interactivity through
structural [in-silico], in-vitro and in-vivo mechanisms [37-39,31]. Series of in-vivo and in-vitro
RNA recombination leading to vast genetic variability of positive strand RNA viruses has also
been reported [13]. Domestication, consumption and wildlife activities which results in natural
selection on a human or human-like ACE2 receptor [33, 36] raises the possibility of SARS-CoV
2 emergence from pangolin. The receptor-binding domain [RBD] in the spike protein and
functional polybasic [furin] cleavage site at the S1–S2 boundary [40,33] directs viral-host cell
interactivity. Earlier reports of “no interactivity” between the S glycoprotein of bat-CoV with
human receptor ACE2 [which is essential for cross-species transmission] was founded on
significantly low levels of sequence similarity [79 to 80%] between bat-CoV and SARS-CoV in
genes encoding the viral spike [S] glycoprotein [41]. However, the higher homology score
[95.6%] in the receptor S-gene region obtained in this study suggests pangolin as the most likely
intermediate host of SARS-CoV 2 than bats with 46.8% score [Supplementary file 2] .

Fig 2: Spike gene phylogeny of zoonotic CoVs with 2019 nCoV/SARS-CoV 2
Possible host-viral genetic recombination [42] could account for the increased level of
evolutionary divergence observed in submitted entries of the recent SARS-CoV-2 genomic data
during time of the study (Supplementary data 2-entries from December 2019 till 4 th April).
Evolutionary patterns observed between Wuhan SARS-CoV 2 data and other five geographical
locations reveal trajectory of infection from reported source of outbreak. Mobility patterns of
both humans and animals alike are major factors influencing zoonotic disease outbreak amongst
populations [43].This amongst others, necessitates the strict travel bans, laws and confinement
strategies adopted in different countries to curb its spread. Surprisingly, genomic and protein
data from Philipines suggests otherwise (Figs 3 and 4). Despite the limited data used for SARS
CoV 2 genomic profiling in this study, we found viral subtype divergence (considering distance
metrics of SARS-CoV2 with entries) [Figures 3 and 4] suggesting a population-specific post
translational modifications which could have been influenced by genetic makeup. This is
presumed based on subclades formed between protein sequence data from Philippines [BCA
37476.1 and BCA37477.1] and another between China [QHD 43415.1] and Philippines
[BBZ90167.1]-countries in the same continent [Figs 4 and 5]. Empirical data points to genetic
and epigenetic factors in SARS-CoVs evolution, incidence and infection rates amongst diverse
populations and across different racial backgrounds [44].

CONCLUSION

Viral cellular mechanisms are vital factors necessary for replication during infection. Hence,
identification of domains of viral entry and evasion of antiviral mechanisms in host cells is
essential for development of effective therapeutic measures. Conserved domains that are vital
targets sites for inhibition of SARS-CoV2 viral entry and replication in host cells found in this
study include nsp11, nsp 13, RdRp and corona super family while compounds such as RNA
aptamers, ATP inhibitors, papain-like proteinase [plPRO] and 3C-like main protease-3CLpro etc.
are viable indicated inhibitors of these domains. Also, understanding the evolutionary pathway of
the novel coronavirus transmission will not only help combat the current pandemic but assist in
mutation tracking for identifying future zoonotic coronaviruses threats. The phylogenetic
analyses of candidate zoonotic coronavirus [S] gene with SARS-CoV 2 revealed pangolin as the
most recent ancestor which formed a subclade with bat S –gene indicating interspecies
recombination of CoV in bats and pangolins resulted in SARS-CoV2. Evolutionary pattern
observed between SARS-CoV 2 genomic data from source of outbreak with recent entries
analyzed in this study showed relative trajectory course of infection from source to other places
except protein data from Philippines suggesting earlier existence of SARS-CoV 2 which should
be further investigated. Also, genomic and protein data revealed racial viral subtype divergence
and rapid rate of mutation despite the novelty of the outbreak. Precise dating of viral subtype
divergence will enable researchers correlate divergence with epidemics and pandemics via viral
sequence sampling for proper time-scale measurements of zoonotic threats in human
populations. Therefore, there is an urgent need for large scale analysis and profiling of genetic
data of SARS-CoV2 in affected populations especially in Africa where there is paucity of
genomic SARS-CoV data for effective therapeutic measures.
