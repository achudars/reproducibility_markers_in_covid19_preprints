ABSTRACT
Usage of a face mask has become mandatory in many countries after the outbreak of SARS-CoV2, and its usefulness in combating the pandemic is a proven fact. There have been many
advancements in the design of a face mask and the present treatise describes a face mask in which
a simple textile triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) serves the purpose of filtration of SARS-CoV2. The proposed mask is designed with multilayer protection sheets, in which the first two layers
act as triboelectric (TE) filter and the outer one is a smart filter. The conjugated effect of contact
electrification, and electrostatic induction of the proposed smart mask are effective in inactivating
the span of virus-ladden aerosols in a bidirectional way. Five pairs of triboseries fabrics i.e. nylon
- polyester, cotton - polyester, poly(methyl methacrylate) - PVDF, lylon - PVDF and
polypropylene - polyester have been optimized in this study in terms of their effective triboelectric charge densities as 83.13, 211.48, 38.62, 69 and 74.25 nC/m2, respectively. This smart
mask can be used by a wide range of people because of its simple mechanism, self-driven
(harvesting mechanical energy from daily activities, e.g. breathing, talking, or other facial
movements functionalities, and effective filtration efficiency and thus, it is expected to be
potentially beneficial to slow down the devastating impact of COVID-19.

1. Introduction
While the ongoing outbreak of 2019-2020 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2, previously known as 2019-nCoV) gains significant prevalence worldwide,
scavenging a curative remedy has become the main thrust to all scientists across the globe. Alike
personal protective equipment (PPE), usage of homemade do-it-yourself (DIY) cloth mask has
attracted global attention to combat novel coronavirus. Though the performance of various fabrics
used in such a homemade mask is still under observation, their response is likely to be anticipated
for combatting severe respiratory issues caused by the novel pandemics. In regards to the present
scenario, the recent report by Konda et al. illustrated the filtration efficiency of differently
combined fabrics depends on the particle size of aerosol, and its found to be promising for the
wide bracketed size (10 nm- 6µm) particles. Their study unveils aerosol filter made by the
combination of chiffon and silk that are significantly efficient.1 Therefore, a hybrid combination
of non-woven fabrics having different threads count per unit shows effective filtration efficiency
fornanosize particles. Improper and loose-fitting might prevent the working of that mask as the
filtration is based on the principle of static electricity.
Kutter et al. have well demonstrated the variation in the size of respiratory droplet, which are well
known as aerosols (<5 µm) and droplets (>5 µm).2 Among these, water droplets and liquefied gas
droplets come into play as a medium on which SARS-CoV-2 can traverse over a long distance
when the size is relatively small,. Otherwise, larger droplets can settle down easily without
traveling a large distance.
Based on the available knowledge of various aspects of infection spread by SARS-CoV-2 virus,
the initialspreading is likely to be spread by direct contact, or by providing a transmission path to
land the large virus-containing droplets,3 which are found to remain stable for more than 24 hrs.4
3

COVID positive patients can also passively spread viruses to the people surrounding them. As per
the underlying precaution made by WHO 2020a, wearing a face mask is mandatory to combat
COVID-19.5Another route of transmission might be of either only in passing or by traversingvirus
contained aerosols. So in that case, the liquefied dropletsstart to evaporate immediately after the
expiry of droplets and, someofthe smaller sized dropletstransported by air discharge field rather
than gravitation. Such small virus-loaded droplets get enough liberation to traverse in the air
several meters from their route.6 Following five basic steps of aerosol filtration, the electrostatic
attraction takes predominant role alike gravity sedimentation, inertial impaction, interception, and
diffusion.7-8 All these mechanisms are solely size-dependent, i.e. gravitational forces come into
play for larger sized droplets (> 1µm), whereas sedimentation and impaction are only applicable
for medium-sized particles (> 1µm to 10µm). Lesser the size of the particles (100 nm- 11µm),
higher will be the tendency of those particles to get diffused by mechanical interception, and
Brownian motion.Interestingly, nanosized particles can easily slide between the opening network
of non-woven fibers.9 In such cases, electrostatic attraction (EA) takes significance to bind and
cling such particles to the fibers. The newly invented principle of fusing EA with nanogenerators
capable of generating triboelectric charges from the wasted mechanical energy from our daily
activities (respiration, talking, or any other facial movement) can be utilized favorably in mask
design,10 which has been conceptualized in the present study.
In this context, we present the design and simulation of a novel self-powered triboelectric
nanogenerator (TENG) fused smart mask, in which the viruses are killed in the electric field and
the wearer can combat the deadly novel coronavirus. Recent findings on the use of cloth mask
during the outbreak of Influenza in 2009 appeared to be inadequate to conclude the selection of
fabrics having significant filtration efficiency.11-12 Though the recent study by Konda et al. have

4

envisaged that the thread counts of respective non-woven fiber play a key role in electrostatic
filtration, but does not guarantee for the case of inhaling viral particles coming from the
environment.

2. Proposed design of face mask
The proposed face mask is composed of multilayers, out of which inner and middle layers comprise
of tribo-series materials (TSM). The prototype design of the self-powered smart mask is shown
in Figure 1(a). Since TENGs exhibit quadratic relation between power density, and triboelectric
charge density, increasing the tribo- charges is a challenging issue.13-16 That can be done using
structural optimization of different tribo-series materials, surface modification, etc.17 Interestingly,
nucleocapsid protein crowned SARS-CoV-2 possesses surface electrostatic potential
characteristics, that reinforced the present design concept.18 Keeping all these in mind, five
combinations of readily available non-woven TSM have been chosen, each with a pair of positive
TSM and negative TSM followed by a self-powered smart layer. As a good energy harvester, vocal
energy exerted during talking, or any other lip activities have been utilized as the prime source of
power to induce static electricity in between the inner and middle layers of the proposed mask.
The detailed characteristics of the five pairs of TSM are illustrated in the next section. The selfpowered induced potential allows the thin metal framing of these layers to transfer charges
between them. The layer is capable of acquiringthe static charges so that any viral particle having
surface charge can easily be inactivated in the outer layer.19 The activated outer or smart layer can
adhere electrically the charged viral particles coming from the close vicinity of the wearer. The
novelty of this design lies in the self-activation of the smart layer through the vocal activities of
the wearer and has provision to deal with aerosols as well as droplets (gaseous, liquid). The essence
5

of the proposed multilayer self-powered smart mask is low-cost, comfortable texture,and wide
accessibility thatassures no internal respiratory problem (breathing problem) to the wearer.

layer). (b) Schematic representation of working mechanism TENG- based smart mask. The
proposed mask can filtrate virus contained aerosols both during breath in and breath out
condition. The outer smart layer gets shorted due to the charge generated by TENG. The
short-circuited net mesh can fetch viral particles having surface charge within its filter layer.
Consequently, the particle becomes inactive through electrocution in the outer layer. The
6

tribo-layers provide extra protection to the mask wearer. Here Cs indicates storage
capacitor, and RL is the load resistor.
In this paper, the simple mechanism of auto harvesting energy, contact electrification, and
electrostatic induction enabled TENG have been utilized. The comparative study of reported
design face mask is explained in Table 2. The corresponding features of triboseries fabrics
belonging to the positive and negative series of the tribo-series is described in Table 1 . To boost
up the output charge of TENG, combination of nylon - polyester, cotton - polyester, PMMA PVDF, lylon - PVDF and polypropylene - polyester have been studied. Based on this, the
electrostatic simulation has been carried out.
3. Theoretical simulation of the self-powered smart mask
The principle of TENGs isfusion of contact electrification and electrostatic induction. Static
polarized charges are mainly induced through contact electrification which further triggers the
energy conversation from self-harvested vocal energy to electrical energy through electrostatic
induction.
Initially, the separation distance (𝑑) between two tribo-pairs can be varied according to the activity
of the liops of the wearer. The mechanical force exerted by the lip activity makes them come in
contact with each other. The material in each tribo-pairs share opposite tribo-charges as aresult of
contact electrification. The insulated construction of each layer (Figure 1 b), confirms that the
charges can only transfer between tribo-layers (TL) through external circuits. If ‘+𝜎’ denotes the
transferred charges between TLs, one TL will acquire transferred charge – 𝜎 and the other TL will
have the transferred charge of +𝜎. In Figure 2A, the separation distance between the TLs is ‘𝑑’
with an area of ‘𝑆’. We consider the size of the virus-loaded particle to be 1µm. The electrical
potential difference between the TLs of TENG is supposed to contribute two major components.
7

The induced polarized TE generates charges and voltage , which is a function of ‘𝑑’. Considering
the induced voltage to be 1V, the outgoing viral particles will be under very high electric field
(E), i.e. 106 V/m, as calculated using equation 1.
𝑉

E= 𝑑

(1)

Therefore, the generated higher electric field is capable enough to make a contact between these
TLs, since the air discharge field is 3×106 V/m.

Figure 2. (A) Alignment of three-layer of the proposed smart mask. (B) Considering four
holes in the inner layer with another hole in the opposite side.

A deep insight into the converter circuit illustrates that the voltage output of the TENG gets
rectified using the bridge rectifier. The charging capacitor (Cs) stores the accumulated charge into
it for future use. It removes the unwanted AC components of the output signal. Thus, a pure DC is
obtained across the load resistor RL.The smart filter of the proposed mask is connected across the

8

RL. Therefore the induced tribo charges can be discharged for R LCs time (sec). This finding
provides the wearer extra protection while the wearer are at rest.
The other perspective illuminates that the viral respiratory droplets are of conducting nature, hence
their resistance will be smaller (1kΩ). Also, 1mA current through the human body is sufficient
enough to inactivate the surface charge of the virus. Therefore, the two TLs of 1µm apart with selfgenerated voltage in the mask is around 1 V, that indicates the aerosolized droplet can easily be
burnt through short-circuiting in the third smart layer. If the test droplet does not contain critical
amount of surface charge, then also water particles make the layer shorted.
It’s imperative to measure the safety of the wearer concerning the generated heat energy,illustrate
this, four holes (p, q, r, s) are considered in the front side, whereas the hole in the opposite side the
respected layer is depicted by ‘A’ (Figure 2B). The tendency of the incoming droplets entering
through any of the holes (p, q, r, s) to emanate through the hole ‘A’ in the opposite side of the
layer. During the passage from TLs to the smart layer, the droplet has to adhere to the mesh of the
smart layer that has already been energized highly. Therefore, the high field induced in the smart
layer capable of electrocuting the outgoing droplet by heat burning. The produced heat would be
in the order of 1fJ/µm3/ºk (considering the air specific density ̴ 1kJ/m3/ºk). This phenomenon
further assures the heat energy produced to electrocute the outgoing particles would not create
much heat to initiate any breathing problems to the wearer.
4. Power management of self-powered smart mask
It has been illustrated in Table 1. based on this mask design based on static electricity,
triboelectricity, etc. Analyzing the electric characteristics, and material properties of TE
materials can conclusively give a deep insight into the material dependent voltage, current,

9

developed power in the TENG.Considering the the normal respiration rate for an adult 12-20
breaths/ min. at rest. In order to calculate minimum available energy, the frequency bandwidth
(fmax-fmin) of the expiration phase is 0.2-0.33 Hz. Since, one complete breathing cycle
requires5 sec, inspiration and expiration ratio (I:E) would be 1:1 (2.5 sec each) during active
phase of the wearer. Therefore, the effect of a variation in inspiration and expiration times
subjected to a pressure difference of 1kPa (Supplementary Information, Note S1).

Since the novelty of the proposed mask lies in the smart layer, the utilization of the developed
charged between TLs should be sufficient to allow electrocution in the smart layer.

indicating the constant separation distance ‘d’ between the two TLs with area of each layer

In order to analyze the charge density of two TLs based TENG, average energy available from
breathing can be calculated as 5 𝑥 105 × 𝑘 J (considering 𝑆~ 5 mm), as shown in Figure 3.
Available charge during each breathing cycle supply charge (𝑑𝑞 ) of 5 𝑥 105 𝑘 × 𝑛C/ breathing

(‘𝑛’ denotes the effective triboelectric charge density of respective pair, TECD). Therefore, the
important parameter ‘𝑘’ signifies the variation of energy required for charging which depends on
theinternal properties of TSMs under study. Table 1 is illustrating the TECD of nylon - polyester,
cotton - polyester, PMMA - PVDF, nylon - PVDF, and polypropylene - polyester. It can be
understood from Table 1 that the pair of cotton- polyester TLs likely to be the suitable tribo-pairs
with highest effective TECD.The proposed design of the proposed mask thus optimized to the pair
ofcloths such as a cotton and non-woven polyester fabrics.Besides, the relative charge available
during active phase of the wearer can be calculated as 500 〖dx〗^2.n C/breathing, where the relative
separation distance (dx) has been varied in the range of 2-20 µm.

case.

The proposed design explains that the outer smart layer, the tribo-charges induced through contact
electrification and triboelectrification between tribo-pairs is likely to be utilized using the smart
12

layer to kill the incoming SARS-CoV-2 contained aerosols. The storage capacitor (𝐶𝑠 ) hold the
induced charge in a way to be utilized in two different ways. It can serve effectively when the
wearer is at rest and to retain the excess charge when incoming and outgoing aerosol contains no
SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the incorporation of the smart outer layer provides extra protection to
the wearer considering the case when incoming aerosol contained with SARS-CoV-2. In such
cases, the charged SARS-CoV-2 can be killed by electrocution in the smart layer giving double
protection through middle and inner TLs in self-powered way. In summary, the proposed
technology can block the novel coronavirus through double action of charge adsorption, and
electrocution by triboelectrification, thus providing effective protective role to combat the deadly
impact of

SARS-CoV-2. In light of this context, the reported masks based on different

technologies have been illustrated in Table 2.

5. Conclusion
While the whole world has been suffering from the devastating COVID-19, safety precausion
becomes a key concern to live life in the adverse situation. The present report illustrates the design
of three-layered TENG based facial mask. The different combination of TSMs have been
experimented in order to get better filtration efficiency in terms of TECD. The combination of
easily available cotton and polyester fabric can be utilized in designing self-powered smart mask
based on its highest TECD and induced power (0.38W per second). The study has also brought
light into the voltage-current-power generated by the contact electrification of the TLs. The
prototype mask can be activated through breathing cycles (and/or talking or other relevant facial
gesture) without the need of any external power source. The accumulated charge can powered the
smart layer upto 0.38 W which is sufficient enough to destroy the viral particles possibly by
electrocution. The present design of facial mask can preferably reach the breakthrough in terms of

16

cost-effectiveness, active-powered, double protection, and most importantly the wearer can reuse
the mask throught their life span as it takes energy from the human body itself.

Supplementary Information, Note S1
Note S1:
Work done by exhaling is given by
dw = P.dv (assuming pressure inside the plates to be constant)
and, dv = A.dx
Where, A = Active area.
dx = Relative displacement.
P = Atmospheric pressure.
If ‘F’ be the force exerted on the plate due to extra pressure,
Then,
dx= kdF (k is TSM dependent proportionality constant)
Considering,


Volume of air/inhaling= 0.5L



Breathing pressure= ±5 cm of H2O (water)



Maximum pressure change during one breathing cycle =100 mm of water



Normal air pressure=760 mm of Hg = 1.01325 bar
Therefore, pressure variation during breathing is 1kPa.
