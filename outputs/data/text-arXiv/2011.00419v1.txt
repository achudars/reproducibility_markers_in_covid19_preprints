Abstract

increase in overall traffic volumes [3], in some cases resulting in
peaks in round trip latency in some countries (e.g., Italy) that were
approximately 30% higher than normal [11]. Because users were
less mobile, downlink traffic volume decreased by up to 25% for
cellular networks in the UK [15]. While some of the characteristics
of shifting traffic demands are known, and certain aspects of the
Internet’s resilience in the face of the traffic shifts are undoubtedly a
result of robust design of the network and protocols, some aspects
of the Internet’s resilience are a direct result of providers’ swift
responses to these changing traffic patterns. This paper explores
these traffic effects from a longitudinal perspective—exploring traffic
characteristics during the first half of 2020 to previous years—and
also explores how service providers responded to the changes in
traffic patterns.
Service providers and regulatory agencies implemented various
responses to the traffic shifts resulting from COVID-19. AT&T and
Comcast have made public announcements about capacity increases
in response to increases in network load [1, 5]. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) also announced the “Keep Americans
Connected” initiative to grant providers (such as AT&T, Sprint, TMobile, U.S. Cellular, Verizon, and others) additional spectrum to
support increased broadband usage [9]. Web conferencing applications Zoom and WebEx were also granted temporary relief from
regulatory actions [9]. These public documents provide some perspectives on responses, but to date, there are few independent reports
and studies of provider responses. This paper provides an initial view
into how some providers responded in the United States.
We study the effects of the shifts in Internet traffic resulting from
the COVID-19 pandemic response on Internet infrastructure. We
study three questions:

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in dramatic changes to the
daily habits of billions of people. Users increasingly have to rely
on home broadband Internet access for work, education, and other
activities. These changes have resulted in corresponding changes to
Internet traffic patterns. This paper aims to characterize the effects of
these changes with respect to Internet service providers in the United
States. We study three questions: (1) How did traffic demands change
in the United States as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic?; (2) What
effects have these changes had on Internet performance?; (3) How
did service providers respond to these changes? We study these questions using data from a diverse collection of sources. Our analysis of
interconnection data for two large ISPs in the United States shows a
30–60% increase in peak traffic rates in the first quarter of 2020. In
particular, we observe traffic downstream peak volumes for a major
ISP increase of 13–20% while upstream peaks increased by more
than 30%. Further, we observe significant variation in performance
across ISPs in conjunction with the traffic volume shifts, with evident
latency increases after stay-at-home orders were issued, followed
by a stabilization of traffic after April. Finally, we observe that in
response to changes in usage, ISPs have aggressively augmented
capacity at interconnects, at more than twice the rate of normal
capacity augmentation. Similarly, video conferencing applications
have increased their network footprint, more than doubling their
advertised IP address space.

Introduction

• How did traffic patterns change as a result of COVID-19? Traffic
volumes and network utilization are changing as a reaction to
changes in user behaviors. It is critical to measure the exact
alterations in a long time span.
• What were the resulting effects on performance? Considering
an expected surge around the dates when states issued stayat-home orders or declared states of emergency, we seek to
observe possible changes in the latency and throughput of
network traffic across locations. Further, different ISPs also
have different capacity and provisioning strategies, which
provides us a finer granularity based on these differences.
• How did ISPs and service providers respond? Finally, to deal
with the usage boosts and performance degradations during
the COVID-19 response, operations and reactions of ISPs

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in dramatic shifts in the behavioral patterns of billions of people. These shifts have resulted
in corresponding changes in how people use the Internet. Notably,
people are increasingly reliant on home broadband Internet access
for work, education, and other activities. The changes in usage patterns have resulted in corresponding changes in network traffic
demands observed by Internet service providers. Many reports have
noted some of the effects of these changes from service provider
networks [1, 5], application providers [18, 22], and Internet exchange
points [19]. Generally, previous findings and conventional wisdom
suggest that while overall traffic demands increased, the Internet
responded well in response to these changing demands.
Previous work has shed light on the nature of the resulting changes
in traffic patterns. In Europe, Internet exchange points saw a 15–20%

and service providers were taken which may explain the
changes in network performance. The answer to this question
informs us of the networks robustness and their effective
disaster provisioning strategies. These questions have become
increasingly critical during the COVID-19 pandemic, as large
fractions of the population have come to depend on reliable
Internet access that performs well for a variety of applications,
from video conferencing to remote learning and healthcare.

in the United States saw less congestion [17]. Due to decreased user
mobility, cellular network patterns have shifted [15]: The authors
found a decrease in the average user throughput as well as decreased
handoffs. Feldmann et al. [11] observed that the fixed-line Internet
infrastructure was able to sustain the 15–20% increase in traffic that
happened rapidly during a short window of one week.
Our work differs from and builds on these previous studies in
several ways: First, this study extends over a longer time frame,
and it also uses longitudinal data to compare traffic patterns during
the past six months to traffic patterns in previous years. Due to the
nascent and evolving nature of COVID-19 and corresponding ISP
responses, previous studies have been limited to relatively short
time frames, and have mainly focused on Europe. Second, this work
explores the ISP response to the shifting demands and traffic patterns;
to our knowledge, this work is the first to begin to explore ISP and
service provider responses.

To answer these questions, we study a diverse collection of datasets
about network traffic load, through granular measurements, proprietary data sharing agreements, and user experiences, as well as
extensive baseline data spanning over two years.
Summary of findings. First, we study the traffic pattern changes
in the United States (§4) and find that, similar to the changes previously explored for European networks, our analysis reveals a 30–60%
increase in peak traffic volumes. In the Comcast network in particular, we find that downstream peak traffic volume increased 13–20%,
while upstream peak traffic volume increases by more than 30%.
Certain interconnect peers exhibit significant changes in the magnitude of traffic during the lockdown. Second, we observe a temporary,
statistically significant increase in latency lasting approximately two
months (§5). We observe a temporary increase of about 10% in average latency around the time that stay-at-home orders were issued.
Typical latency values returned to normal a few months after these
orders were put in place. We also find heterogeneity between different ISPs. Finally, we explore how service providers responded to this
increase in traffic demands by adding capacity (§6). ISPs aggressively
added capacity at interconnects, more than 2x the usual rates. On a
similar note, application service providers (e.g., video conferencing
apps) increased the advertised IP address space by 2.5–5x to cope
with the corresponding 2–3x increase in traffic demand.

Application Measurements during COVID-19. Previous work has
also studied application usage and performance, such as increases in
web conferencing traffic, VPN, gaming, and messaging [11]. Favale
et al. studied ingress and egress traffic from the perspective of a
university network and found that the Internet proved capable of
coping with the sudden spike in demand in Italy [8]. Another paper
used network traffic to determine campus occupancy at the effect
of COVID-19 related policies on three campus populations across
Singapore and the United States [24]. The cybercrime market was
also statistically modeled during the COVID-19 era to characterize
its economic and social changes [23].

Network measurements of other disasters. While COVID-19 responses are ongoing and evolving, making measurement efforts
incomplete, network responses under other disastrous events can be
informative. In 2011, the Japan earthquake of Magnitude 9.0 caused
circuit failures and subsequent repairs within a major ISP. Nationwide, traffic fell by roughly 20% immediately after the earthquake.
However, surprisingly little disruption was observed from outside [4].
In 2012, Hurricane Sandy hit the Eastern seaboard of the United States
and caused regional outages and variances over the network [14].
For human-caused disasters such as the September 11th attacks, routing, and protocol data were analyzed to demonstrate the resilience
of the Internet under stress. Their findings showed that although
unexpected blackouts did happen, they only had a local effect [20].
Oppressive regimes have also caused Internet outages, such as a
complete Internet shutdown due to censorship actions during the
Egypt and Libya revolts [7], where packet drops and BGP route
withdrawals were triggered intentionally.
Although there have been several preliminary measurements of
the effects of the COVID-19 response, none have holistically studied
traffic data, performance analysis, routing data, and ISP capacity
information together, as we do in this paper. It is crucial to collect
and correlate such information to better understand the nature of
both traffic demands, the effects of these changes on performance,
and the corresponding responses. This paper does so, illuminating
the collaborative view of responses of service providers in the United
States.

Related Work

The pandemic response has modified people’s habits, causing them
to rely heavily on the Internet for remote work, e-learning, video
streaming, etc. In this section, we present some previous efforts in
measuring the effects of COVID-19 and past disaster responses on
networks and applications.
Network Measurements during COVID-19. Previous work has largely
focused on aggregate traffic statistics surrounding the initial COVID19 lockdowns. Traffic surged about 20% in Europe for broadband
networks [11]. In the United States, a blog post [17] reveals that
the national downstream peak traffic has recently stabilized, but in
the early weeks of the pandemic, it showed a growth of 20.1%. For
wireless networks in the US, volume increases of up to 12.2% for
voice and 28.4% for data by the top four providers were shown in
an industry report [6]. Mobile networks in the UK reported roughly
25% drops in downlink data traffic volume [15]. Industry operators
have self-reported on their network responses largely through blog
posts [1, 5, 13, 16].
For traffic performance changes, different patterns appear in different regions. Facebook shows that less-developed regions exhibited
larger performance degradations through their analysis of edge networks [2]. Network latencies were approximately 30% higher during
the lockdown in Italy [11]. According to an NCTA report, networks

Traffic Demands and Interconnect Capacity: Internet Connection
Measurement Project. We leverage a dataset that includes network
interconnection statistics for links between anonymized access ISPs
and their neighboring partner networks in the United States. The
dataset consists of IPFIX-based statistics over five-minute intervals,
including: timestamp, region (as access ISPs may connect to a partner network in multiple geographic regions), anonymized partner
network, access ISP, ingress bytes, egress bytes, and link capacity.
The dataset contains roughly 97% of links from all participating ISPs.
All of the links represented in the dataset are private (i.e., they do
not involve public IXP switch fabrics). Each five-minute interval
includes the sum of the utilization of traffic flows that were active
during that interval. We also calculate secondary statistics from the
dataset, including: timestamp for the peak ingress and egress hour
for each day on each link in terms of usage, ingress/egress peak hour
bytes, and daily 95th and 99th percentile usage.

Performance Data: Federal Communications Commission Measuring Broadband America (MBA). We analyze the FCC’s ongoing nationwide performance measurement of broadband service in the
United States [10]. The raw data is collected from a collection of
distributed measurement devices (named Whiteboxes) placed in volunteer’s homes and operated by SamKnows. Measurements are conducted on an hourly basis. The dataset includes raw measurements
of several performance metrics, such as timestamp, unit ID, target
server, round trip time, traffic volume, etc. Each Whitebox also includes information pertaining to its ISP, technology, and state where
it is located. We also define dates related to the status of the pandemic
response (e.g., stay-at-home orders, state of emergency declaration,
etc.). Based on these, we can compute more statistics for specified
groups (e.g., break into ISPs): average and standard deviation among
Whiteboxes, daily 95th and 99th percentile latency/throughput.
To keep the network capacity consistent and to record eventual
changes solely based on utilization factors, we pre-process the MBA
dataset with several filters. First, we filter the non-continuous data
within the dates of interest (Dec. 1st, 2019 to June, 30th 2020, and
the previous year) to capture successive shifts. Then, we eliminate
the Whiteboxes which do not aggregate a statistically significant
amount of data, such as some states, ISPs, and technologies with
limited data (e.g., satellite). Finally, we choose the measurements
from Whiteboxes to the top 10 most targeted servers across the
United States to represent the overall US performance. These servers
are sparsely located in major cities of the US and they have the most
Whiteboxes (over 200 for each ISP) connecting with them.

How did traffic demands change?

Because most previous studies [3, 11, 15] focus on Europe, we begin
our explorations by validating whether similar traffic changes are
observed in the United States. We consider peak hour link utilization from the Interconnect Measurement Project as a measure of
traffic demand. We pre-process the interconnect dataset and remove
anomalous data points that are caused by failures in the measurement system. In particular, we do not analyze dates that are greater
than two standard deviations outside of a 60-day rolling mean for
each link.
Figure 1 shows both the absolute utilization and the utilization
normalized against the link capacity for two anonymized ISPs. For
each ISP, we plot the value corresponding to the 99th percentile link
utilization for a given day. We observe from Figure 1a that ISP A saw
a dramatic increase in raw utilization at roughly the same time as the
initial COVID-19 lockdowns (early March 2020), with values tapering

IP Prefix Advertisements: RouteViews. To gain insight into changes
in IP address space, we parse Internet-wide BGP information globally from several locations and backbones via RouteViews. Raw
RIBs (Routing Information Bases) files were obtained from RouteViews [21] data on a weekly basis. The average of each Tuesday is
computed to represent that week. The RIBs are then parsed to obtain
IPv4 Prefix-to-Autonomous System (AS) relationships, including
mappings of IP prefix, prefix length, paths of AS numbers. In Section 6.2, we compute the total advertised IPv4 spaces for AS numbers

What was the effect on performance?

The surge in interconnect utilization poses a challenge for service
providers, as high utilization of interconnects can potentially introduce high delays for interactive traffic, packet loss, or both. These
effects can ultimately be observed through changes in latency (and,
potentially, short-term throughput). To examine whether we can
observe these effects, we look into the latency and throughput reported by the Measuring Broadband America (MBA) dataset [10].
We explore these effects over the course of several years to understand whether (and how) performance anomalies that we observe
during COVID-19 lockdown differ significantly from performance
anomalies observed during other time periods.

off slightly over the summer of 2020. ISP B, on the other hand, saw a
smaller raw increase in utilization for its 99th percentile links. To
better understand whether ISP B’s smaller increase is a byproduct
of different operating behaviors, we explore possible trends in the
normalized data (Figure 1b). Here we see that both ISPs experienced
significant increases in utilization in March and April 2020.
We also investigated how traffic patterns changed between ISP A
and each of its peers, in both the upstream and downstream directions. For this analysis, we focused on the dates around the utilization
peaks shown in Figure 1. We compared the peak hour download
and upload rates on all of ISP A’s interconnects on (1) January 15,
2020, and (2) April 15, 2020 (Figure 2). In general, we see that traffic
patterns to peers do not vary greatly between the two dates. We do
see, however, that traffic volumes to (and from) some peers change
significantly—some by several orders of magnitude. The identities
of the peers are anonymous in the dataset, but some patterns are
nonetheless clear: For example, some peers show an increase of
upstream utilization by two or three orders of magnitude. Such drastic changes may be attributable to users working from home and
connecting to services that would cause more traffic to traverse the
peer link in the upstream direction. We confirmed these results with
the operators at ISP A and report that they observed that streaming
video traffic decreased from 67 to 63% of the total traffic, but video
conferencing increased from 1% to 4% as a percentage of overall
traffic.

5.1.1 Longitudinal evolution of aggregate, average round-trip latency.
Figure 3 shows a seven-day moving average of average round-trip latencies between all Whiteboxes in this study. We observe an increase
in average round-trip latency by as much as 10%, this increase in
mean latency is significant, corresponding to 30x standard deviation
among all Whiteboxes. At the end of April, latencies return to early
2020 levels. It is worth noting that, although this increase in average latency is both sizable and significant, similar deviations and
increases in latency have been observed before (see the Appendix
for comparable data from 2018–2019). Thus, although some performance effects are visible during the COVID-19 lockdown, the event
and its effect on network performance are not significantly different
from other performance aberrations. Part of the reason for this, we
believe, may be the providers’ rapid response to adding capacity
during the first quarter of 2020, which we explore in more detail in
Section 6.

How performance changed after lockdown.

To better understand how performance changed as a result of changing traffic patterns during the COVID-19 lockdown in the United
States, we explored how latency evolved over the course of 2020.
To establish a basis for comparison, we show the time period from
late 2019 through mid-2020. The Appendix also contains a similar
analysis for the 2018–2019 time period. We compute the average
latency per-Whitebox per-day, and subsequently explore distributions across Whiteboxes for each ISP. (As discussed in Section 3,
we consider only Whiteboxes in fixed-line ISPs for which there are
an adequate number of Whiteboxes and samples.) We use March
10th1 , the average declaration of emergency date [12], to mark the
beginning of the COVID-19 pandmic phase (red shaded for figures).

overall changes in performance, we also explored per-ISP latency

and throughput effects before and during the COVID-19 lockdown
period. Figures 4 and 5 show these effects, showing (respectively) the
95th and 99th percentiles of average round-trip latency across the
Whiteboxes. These results show that, overall 95th percentile latency
across most ISPs remained stable; 99th percentile latency, on the
other hand, did show some deviations from normal levels during
lockdown for certain ISPs. Notably, however, in many cases the same
ISPs experienced deviations in latency during other periods of time,
as well (e.g., during the December holidays).

capacity was added to the networks in Section 6). As the transition
continues, SO appears to be a point in time where latency stabilizes.
Figure 9b shows that distributions of throughput measurements are
more robust, although the upper end of the distribution is clearly
affected, with maximum achieved throughputs lower. The median
and minimum have negligible changes during time periods in late
April suggesting (and corresponding to) aggressive capacity augmentation, which we discuss in more detail in Section 6.

Throughput-latency relationship

How did service providers respond?

In this section, we study how service providers responded to the
changes in traffic demands. We focus on the capacity changes during
lockdown by inspecting two data sources: (1) to understand how
ISPs responded by adding capacity to interconnects, we study the
interconnect capacity of two large ISPs in the United States; and
(2) to understand how video service providers expanded their network footprints in response to increasing demand, we analyze IPv4
address space from two major video conference providers—WebEx
and Zoom—and find that both providers substantially increased
advertised IP address space.

High latencies can sometimes be reflected in achieved throughput,
given the inverse relationship between TCP throughput and roundtrip latency. To explore whether latency aberrations ultimately result
in throughput effects, as well as how those effects manifest at different times of day, we explored the distribution of latencies before
COVID-19 emergency declarations (ED), after the ED but before
the stay-at-home order (SO). Our hypothesis was that we might
see higher latencies (and lower throughputs) during “peak hours”
of the day from broadband access networks, with the peak hours
effectively expanded to the weekday working hours, in accordance
with previous descriptions of these effects [5].
We explored these metrics for a baseline period predating COVID19, the time between state declaration of emergency and stay at
home ordered [12], after stay-at-home declarations were ordered,
and two months after stay-at-home ordered. Because these dates
differed across states, we used known dates for each state [12] and
matched the corresponding dates for each state against the known
location of the Whiteboxes.
Figure 9 shows the distribution throughput and latency distributions across all Whiteboxes for four time intervals, plotted in
four-hour intervals. From Figure 9a, it is clear that the quantiles,
median, and maximum latencies all exhibit effects that correlate
with these time periods.
The period between ED and SO corresponds to abrupt routing
changes, and the latency data thus reflects a corresponding degradation during this time interval, perhaps at least partially due to
the fact that providers cannot immediately respond after the initial
emergency declaration (we discuss the timeframes during which

Capacity increases at interconnect

We begin by exploring how ISPs responded to changing traffic demands by adding network capacity at interconnect links. To do so, we
use the Interconnect Measurement Project dataset. We calculate the
total interconnect capacity for each ISP by summing the capacities
for all of the links associated with the ISP. To enable comparison
between ISPs that may have more or less infrastructure overall, we
normalize the capacity values for each using min-max normalization. We again filter out date values that are beyond two standard
deviations from a rolling 60-day window mean. To show aggregate
infrastructure changes over time, we take all of the data points in
each fiscal quarter and perform a least-squares linear regression
using SciKit Learn. This regression yields a slope for each quarter
that illustrates the best-fit rate of capacity increases over that quarter.
We scale the slope value to show what the increase would be if the
pace was maintained for 365 days (i.e., a slope of 1 would result in a

doubling of capacity over the course of a year). Figure 6 shows the
resulting capacity plots.
The overall trend shows how these two ISPs in the United States
aggressively added capacity at interconnects—at more than twice
the rate at which they were adding capacity over a comparable time
period in the previous year. Second, both ISPs significantly added
capacity in the first quarter of 2020—at a far greater rate than they
were adding capacity in the first quarter of 2019. Recall from the
usage patterns shown in Figure 1, ISP A tends to operate their links at
nearly full capacity, in contrast to ISP B, where aggregate utilization
is well below 90%. Both ISPs witnessed a jump in usage around the
lockdown; the response of aggressively adding capacity appears to
have mitigated possible adverse effects of high utilization rates. The
increase in capacity was necessary to cope with the increased volume:
although network performance and utilization ratios returned to
pre-COVID-19 levels, the absolute traffic volumes remain high.

(such as video conferencing apps, email, and messaging) after lockdown [11]. It has been reported informally that many application
providers expanded serving infrastructure, changed the routes of certain application traffic flows, and even altered the bitrates of services
to cope with increased utilization.
While not all of these purported responses are directly observable in public datasets; however, RouteViews makes available global
routing information, which can provide some hints about routes
and infrastructure, and how various characteristics of the Internet
routing infrastructure change over time. This data can provide some
indication of expanding infrastructure, such as the amount of IPv4
address space that a particular Autonomous System (AS) is advertising. In the case of video conference providers, where some of
the services may be hosted on cloud service providers or where the
video service is a part of a larger AS that offers other services (e.g.,
Google Meet), such a metric is clearly imperfect, but it can offer some
indication of response.
To understand how service providers announced additional IPv4
address space, we parsed BGP routing tables from RouteViews [21].
For each route that originates from ASes of certain application
providers, we aggregate IP prefixes and translate the resulting prefixes into a single count of overall IPv4 address space. We focus on

Increased advertised IP address space

To cope with abrupt changes caused by COVID-19, application service providers also took action to expand their infrastructure. Previous work has observed shifted traffic in communication applications

two popular video conferencing applications, Zoom and WebEx,
since they are two of the largest web conference providers in the
United States—as also recognized by the FCC in their recent order
for regulatory relief [9]. We track the evolution of the advertised IP
address space from the beginning of 2019 through October 2020.

This paper has explored how traffic demands changed as a result of
the abrupt daily patterns caused by the COVID-19 lockdown, how
these changing traffic patterns affected the performance of ISPs in
the United States, both in aggregate and for specific ISPs, and how
service providers responded to these shifts in demand. We observed
a 30–60% increase in peak traffic rates for two major ISPs in the US
corresponding with significant increases in latency in early weeks of
lockdown, followed by a return to pre-lockdown levels, corresponding with aggressive capacity augmentation at ISP interconnects and
the addition of IPv4 address space from video conferencing providers.
Although this paper presented the first known study of interconnect
utilization and service provider responses to changes in patterns
resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, this study still offers a somewhat limited viewpoint into these effects and characteristics. Future
work could potentially confirm or extend these findings by exploring
these trends for other ISPs, over the continued lockdown period, and
for other service providers.

Conclusion

Figure 7 demonstrates how each provider added advertised IPv4
address space from before the pandemic through October 2020. After
the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, both Zoom and WebEx
rapidly begin to advertise additional IPv4 address space. Table 7
enumerates the absolute values of advertised IP address space: Zoom
and WebEx increased advertised IP address space by about 4x and
2.5x respectively, roughly corresponding to the 2–3x increase in
video conferencing traffic.

Longitudinal Latency Evolution for
2018–2019 (Previous Year)

Longitudinal evolution of per-ISP latencies. We further break the
aggregate results into the granularity of ISPs. We report both 95th and
99th percentile latencies here. Note that in the 95th percentile plot,
we show the groups differently, mainly because of major differences
of latency for Mediacom and AT&T. From Figure 10, we find that
the majority of ISPs performed stably, while Mediacom has a large
variance in the average RTT. They both have a tail that contributes
to what we observed in 8. Figure 11 is grouped the same as Figure 5,
which shows that for certain ISPs, they experience similar deviations
during similar periods of different years.

This section provides a basis for performance comparison in Section 5. Following the same analysis, we choose the exact same time
period in the previous year (i.e., late 2018 to mid-2019) in the United
States. We compute the average latency per-Whitebox per-day, and
subsequently explore distributions across Whiteboxes for each ISP.

Average RTT (milliseconds)

Longitudinal evolution of aggregate, average round-trip latency.
Figure 8 shows the aggregate average latency per-Whitebox per-day.
The previous year has an overall latency of about 6ms lower than
2020. We observe that the latency keeps stable until the end of April,
where a deviation of about 2ms is shown. The rate of increase is of
about 10%, echoing similar effects around lockdown.

Throughput-latency relationship

We put a supplementary figure referred to in Section 5 in this appendix. It shows the distributional changes in latency and throughput
on a 4-hour basis. Detailed explanations are in the main text.
