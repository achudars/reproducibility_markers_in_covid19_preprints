Abstract
The novel COVID-19 pandemic is a current, major global health threat. Up
till now, there is no fully approved pharmacological treatment or a vaccine. In
this study, simple mathematical models were employed to examine the dynamics of
transmission and control of COVID-19 taking into consideration social distancing
and community awareness. Both situations of homogeneous and nonhomogeneous
population were considered. Based on the calculations, a sufficient degree of social distancing based on its reproductive ratio is found to be effective in controlling
COVID-19, even in the absence of a vaccine. With a vaccine, social distancing minimizes the sufficient vaccination rate to control the disease. Community awareness
also has a great impact in eradicating the virus transmission. The model is simulated on small-world networks and the role of social distancing in controlling the
infection is explained.
Keywords: COVID-19; SIRS model; social distancing; community awareness;

Introduction

There is a growing interest in the study of mathematical epidemiology using a wide variety
of mathematical models [1]-[4]. Epidemic models explains well the dynamics of both the
transmission and the control of an infection. Numerous modeling approaches can be
integrated to form a clearer picture of an infection and to establish measures on how to
eradicate it. Epidemic models can be greatly improved when combined with real data.
The COVID-19 pandemic that reportedly originated in Wuhan, China, in December
2019 [5] has now become a major global health threat, as well as a focus of interest in
1

many researchers and the entire global community [5]-[11]. COVID-19 is found to be
easily transmitted via close contact with an infective person, even during the incubation
period [8]. The basic reproductive ratio (R0 ) is the average number of secondary infections
arising from one infective person; it is a measure of the infectiousness of a disease. A recent
study [9] showed that COVID-19 has an R0 of 3.28 in average; however, this has to be
confirmed in further studies due to the novelty of the virus. Additionally, this pandemic
has brought the concepts that community behavior has a primary role in the transmission
or containment of the virus, and even the competing organizations have to collaborate
among each other to contain the crisis [10, 11].
Developing a COVID-19 vaccine is a very costly and time consuming process, where
its effectiveness and safety have to be thoroughly ensured before public use. In some
cases, vaccine-induced immunity wanes with time. Also, some viruses learn to mute and
evade the immunity induced by vaccines. In the case of containing COVID-19, the most
suitable strategy, for now, is to reduce its infectiousness by limiting contact with infective
people and polluted surfaces in what is contemporarily popular as ”social distancing (SD)”
including the quarantine of infected individuals. The degree of SD can be regarded as
the fraction of the entire population complying with the policies. Another interpretation
considers the gradation of SD policies, i.e., closing borders to international travel; partially
closing social venues, large malls, schools and universities, and prayer places; or total
lockdown. The awareness of the community in applying these policies will have a great
impact on the viral transmission control.
Adaptive behavior is extensively seen in multiagent biological systems [12], where the
behavior of agents is coupled by their environment interaction. Such a coupling can be
modeled by the Sato-Crutchfield formulation [13, 14] which corresponds to memory decay.
This formulation can also be equate to personal mistakes or environmental effects based
on the community awareness.
Different mathematical modeling approaches for COVID-19 have been proposed [15][17]. A compartmental model is used in the present study, because of its simplicity and
its ability to study many features of the dynamics of disease transmission and control.
It should be noted that studying the equilibria of the associated dynamic system and its
stability is of crucial importance as it helps in collecting information around the infection
dynamics. As immunity to reinfection from COVID-19 lasts in a short time [18] and, the
virus can mute and evade the immunity, the SIRS model is suitable to examine the spread
of COVID-19.
The significant role of the spatial aspect of the dynamics of infection transmission is
emphasised by simulating epidemic models on networks [19]. Regular lattices can display
the clustering property only, while random graphs can show the long-range interactions.
Small-world networks [20] is one of the most important structures that interpolates between regular lattices and random graphs. Thus, both local and non-local interactions
are combined. Small-world networks are used for studying many features of epidemics
[3, 21].
2

This study aims to develop simple compartmental models for COVID-19, which will
be used to investigate the important roles of SD and community awareness in controlling
the infection transmission. In Section 2, a discussion of the SIRS model for the spread of
COVID-19, with notes on the equilibria and the corresponding stability of the dynamic
system is covered. The roles of SD, community awareness, and vaccination are explained,
with provided calculations on the sufficient degree of SD and vaccination ratio to control
COVID-19 transmission. Then, the model is simulated on small-world networks. In
Section 3, a nonhomogeneous population model is introduced; and the nonlocal interaction
is highlighted. Some conclusions are summed up in Section 4.

Homogeneous population

Assume that a homogenously mixed population of constant sufficiently large size can
be divided into three compartments: susceptible (S), infective (symptomatic or asymptomatic) (I), and removed (isolated or recovered) (R). Infection is transmitted via direct
contact between susceptible and infective individuals at a constant rate β. Infective individuals are removed at a constant rate γ. Meanwhile, removed individuals lose their
immunity at a constant rate ν. Given these parameters, the basic reproductive ratio is
defined as R0 = βγ . Herd immunity is considered an important concept for an infection
when susceptible individuals have enough immunity to prevent the spread of the infection.
Thus, let the condition for herd immunity to occur be R0 S < 1.
The evolution of the fractions of the population S(t), I(t), and R(t) can be described
as a dynamical system
dS
= −βSI + νR,
dt
dI
= βSI − γI,
dt
dR
= γI − νR,
dt

(1)

which has two equilibria, firstly, the disease-free equilibrium (1, 0, 0) that is stable when
R0 < 1 and unstable when R0 > 1, and secondly, the endemic equilibrium

provided that R0 > 1. The endemic equilibrium is stable when present.
An infection can be contained if the disease-free equilibrium is the only possible stable
equilibrium. For the COVID-19, R0 = 3.28 [9], which implies that the disease-free equilibrium is found to be unstable. If the endemic equilibrium is reached, it will be stable,
3

the disease will persist, and herd immunity will not be effective. Thus, there is an urgent
need to contain the COVID-19 before the endemic equilibrium is reached. The two most
important strategies to control the transmission are SD and vaccination.
The COVID-19 has been found to spread even during the incubation period [8]. The
policies of SD reduce the probability of contact with both infective individuals and polluted objects. SD can be integrated in the SIRS model, by assuming that only (1 − µ) of
the susceptible individuals are in contact with the infective individuals, where 0 ≤ µ ≤ 1
is the degree of SD. Here, the dynamical system (1) transforms to
dS
= −β(1 − µ)SI + νR,
dt
dI
= β(1 − µ)SI − γI,
dt
dR
= γI − νR.

(3)

Note that the reproductive ratio becomes (1 − µ)R0 , which implies that the infectiousness of COVID-19 can be lessened by increasing the degree of SD. Further, it can
be reduced to half for µ = 0.5. Accordingly, two equilibria are present: the disease-free
equilibrium that is stable when (1 − µ)R0 < 1 and the stable endemic equilibrium

COVID-19, µ0 = 0.69. A degree higher than µ0 should be maintained for a sufficient time
to ensure the robustness of the stability of the disease-free equilibrium, and to not reach
the endemic equilibrium.
An interesting limit is when µ = 1. From system (3), because I exponentially decays
as
I(t) = I(0)e−γt ,
(6)

The sufficient SD degree to control the infection can be defined as µ0 = 1 −

the spread of the infection is stopped.
Figure 1 shows the results of the computations when β = 0.65, γ = 0.02, and ν = 0.05.
In the absence of SD policies (µ = 0), the proportion of infective individuals I increases
4

exponentially with time until the peak (Imax = 0.333) is reached at time (tImax = 1218
time steps). In contrast, because of herd immunity, I decreases exponentially with time
until the spread of the virus is prevented. I has been determined to respond differently
with various degrees of SD applied. For µ = 0.3, I increases at a slower rate than when
µ = 0, the peak is reduced by 39%, and the peak time delayed by 53% (Imax = 0.204 and
tImax = 1865 time steps). For µ = 0.5, Imax = 0.092 and tImax = 2911 time steps, see Fig.
1, when µ is increased, the peak is reduced correspondingly (dues to lower herd immunity
threshold), and there is more delay in the peak time. These results are important as
they offer the opportunity for more studies and more time to develop a vaccine, while
simultaneously reducing the patient loads in hospitals and intensive care units.
At the beginning of an epidemic, S is approximately the whole population, and can
be considered as a constant S(0), then from system (3)
I(t) = I(0)eβ(1−µ)S(0)t ,

(7)

which explains the initial exponential growth of I.
Both morbidity and mortality are commonly used measures that determine the severity
of an infection. The morbidity m(t) is calculated as
m(t) = I(t) − I(t − 1).

(8)

Figure 2 shows the results of the numerical simulations for m(t), with the same values of
the parameters of the model as Fig. 1. It is clear that increasing µ decreases morbidity,
and thus mortality associated with COVID-19.
In the presence of a vaccine, if a fraction p of the susceptible individuals is vaccinated,
then only 1 − p of them will be exposed to infection; the reproductive ratio becomes
(1 − p)(1 − µ)R0 . The sufficient vaccination ratio for controlling an infection is modeled
by
1
(9)
p0 = 1 −
(1 − µ)R0
which depends on the infectiousness of the disease and the SD degree applied. The ratio
p0 decreases rapidly with an increase in µ, and it approaches zero when µ = µ0 . This
is advantageous as vaccination can be applied to only a small fraction of the population,
provided that SD policies are applied.
References [13] and [14] model mistakes by adding coupling terms to system (3); these
coupling terms represent the individuals’ interaction with the environment. Here assume
that the degree of community awareness is 0 6 α 6 1. As a general rule, the least aware
community would commit more mistakes. The dynamical system (3) is modified to the

Figure 3 presents a numerical investigation for system (10) when µ = 0.3, β = 0.65,
γ = 0.02, ν = 0.05, and a varied α. Note the advantages of SD are lost once the
degree of community awareness is slightly lowered to 0.9; moreover, the peak increases
to 0.236, and herd immunity is destroyed, allowing the infection to preset. Further, the
infection is expected to get worse when the community awareness drops to α = 0.5 and
then to α = 0.1 (see Fig. 3). This implies that the infection will grow through the
population, which confirms the important role of community awareness development in
reducing COVID-19 transmission.
Finally, the spatial aspect is included by simulating the model on small-world networks.
In our simulations, a connected one-dimensional lattice of size 106 , with periodic boundary
conditions is assumed. With probability φ, some randomly chosen vertices are connected
by some shortcuts to randomly selected non-nearest neighboring vertices. Every vertex
interacts with its nearest neighbors and the distant neighbor, if present. It is clear that
SD practices reduces the chance for shortcuts. The numerical simulations are performed
using the same values of the model (system (1)) and different values of φ. For φ = 0,
the behavior of I is approximately similar to that of Fig. 1 for µ = 0. As φ increases,
the infection becomes endemic see Fig. 4. Of course, applying SD policies reduces φ,
therefore do not allow reaching the endemic phase.

Nonhomogeneous population

The nonlocal interaction is widely observed in the epidemic spreading, especially in the
recent COVID-19. Here we use the Lajmanovich-Yorke model [4] which combines between
both local and nonlocal epidemic spreading. The population is divided into n patches.
Let Ii be the fraction of infective individuals in the i-th patch, βji be the infection rate
within the i-th patch due to an infection from the j-th patch, and γi be the recovery rate
of the i-th patch individuals. Then the model is given as follows
n

dIi X

(11)

Let I = (I1 , I2 , . . . , In )T , and A = (aij ), such that aij = βji , i 6= j; and aii = βii − γi , then
the system (11) can be written as follows
n

X
dI

βji Ii Ij .

j=1

(12)

Let λmax = max1≤i≤n Re(λi ), where λi , i = 1, 2, . . . , n are the eigenvalues of A. According
to Ref. [4], there are two possibilities: either the disease-free equilibrium (Ii = 0, i =
1, 2, . . . , n) is asymptotically stable if λmax ≤ 0, or there exists an asymptotically stable
endemic equilibrium when λmax > 0.
When n = 1, the system is reduced to the homogeneous population situation. The case
n = 2 is worthy of investigation because it represents the situation when the population
is divided into two subpopulations: inside and outside a certain region. For simplicity, we
can assume β11 = β22 = β, β12 = β21 = β́, and γ1 = γ2 = γ. The system (11) becomes

The conditions for the asymptotic stability of the disease-free equilibrium become
(β − γ)2 − β́ 2 ≥ 0.

Then

Equation (15) can be written as
where R0 and Ŕ0 are local and nonlocal reproductive ratios, respectively.
By applying a SD program with degrees, µ locally and µ́ nonlocally, the condition for
the asymptotic stability of the disease-free equilibrium become
(1 − µ)R0 + (1 − µ́)Ŕ0 ≤ 1.

Therefore, applying an external SD program with an appropriate degree reduces the required degree of the internal SD program to prevent approaching the endemic equilibrium.
This is beneficial from a domestic economy point of view. The effect of both internal and
external SD policies is investigated in Fig. 5. The variables are setted as follows: β = 0.6,
β́ = 0.3 and γ = 0.3. It is clear that the proportion of infective individuals in the endemic
phase is lowered by increasing the SD degrees µ and µ́. Also, the disease-free equilibrium
can be obtained at suitable values for µ and µ́.

Conclusion

In the absence of a vaccine, an appropriate degree of SD and a high level of community
awareness can help in controlling the spread of COVID-19. SD policies in particular can
reduce the peak of infection and delay the peak time leading to offer ample time for the
development of a vaccine, and prevent hospitals from reaching their maximum patient
capacity. Moreover, SD policies can reduce the effects of non-local interactions that can
turn the infection to be endemic. With a vaccine, SD practices can reduce the vaccination
rate required to eradicate infection. Subsequently, vaccine priority can be given to the
health-care providers and those in direct contact with infective individuals. Long-term
SD practice is crucial to avoid a relapse, as immediately loosening SD rules may provide
an avenue of recurrence of the infection. Community awareness is also important in
the transmission process; low community awareness destroys the herd immunity, which
spreads the infection endemically. Appropriately implementing an external SD program
reduces the degree required for the internal SD program to contain the infection, which
has a positive impact on the local economy.
There are some probable risks. Firstly, COVID-19 can become endemic especially in
the poorest regions around the world. Secondly, COVID-19 will return in some regions;
this case often refers to the second wave of infection. Thirdly, the possibility of creation
of new strains, which can be slowed down as the number of infected individuals decreases.
When such risks happen, the virus gets retransmitted to the recovered areas. Thus, it is
important that poor countries should be assisted in controlling the transmission of the
virus. Appropriate levels of long-term external and internal SD practices are also strongly
recommended.
Some SD practices can benefit in other issues. For example, COVID-19, though not
sexually transmitted, can be passed easily through sexual activities with an infective
person. Thus, SD practices only allow spouses living in the same household to perform
sexual activities. This will help powerfully in reducing the sexually transmitted infections
which have a profound impact on human health.
