equally-sized groups — one who is very unlikely
to have COVID-19, and one who is quite likely.
Imagine these groups are easy to tell apart —
one group is showing COVID-19 symptoms, for
example, and one group is asymptomatic. 5%
of the asymptomatic patients have COVID-19,
regardless of their race. 50% of the white symptomatic patients have COVID-19, and 75% of
the Black symptomatic patients have COVID19. Finally, imagine there is no racial bias in
who is tested: everyone who is more than 10%
likely to have COVID-19 is tested, regardless
of race, so the same probability threshold is applied to both races. All symptomatic patients
will be tested, producing a positivity rate of
50% for white patients and 75% for Black patients. We will incorrectly conclude from the
higher positivity rate among Black patients
that they are being under-tested relative to
whites — that is, tested only when they are
more likely to have COVID-19. But in fact, in
this hypothetical, everyone faces the same 10%
testing threshold. We reach this misleading
conclusion because the statistic we’re measuring — the positivity rate — is not the same
as the probability threshold at which patients
are being tested. (We note that positivity rate
analysis can also yield a misleading result in the
opposite direction, where it fails to show racial
disparities even though there are disparities in
testing thresholds.)
In general, if two race groups have very different risk distributions (in the hypothetical
example above, the Black risk distribution is
right-shifted) simply looking at the positivity
rate may yield misleading conclusions. Figure 2 illustrates this graphically for continuous
risk distributions. In the case of COVID-19,
infra-marginality is not a hypothetical concern:
per capita infection rates are much higher in
Black populations than white populations, so
it is plausible that there might be dramatic
differences in the risk distributions.
This threshold which people are tested is
hard to measure — unlike the positivity rate,
it’s not a simple fraction directly observable
from the data, but a latent quantity that must
be inferred. Threshold tests attempt to in-

rying contraband, but searching Black drivers
at a lower threshold of evidence. In lending, the
outcome is whether someone granted a loan repays it: if white loan recipients pay back loans
only 10% of the time, but Black loan recipients
pay back loans 90% of the time, it suggests
that Black applicants are receiving loans only
when they are very likely to pay them back, at
a higher threshold of evidence. In COVID-19
testing, the outcome is whether a COVID-19
test comes back positive; if tests of Black patients find COVID-19 90% of the time, but tests
of white patients find COVID-19 only 10% of
the time, it suggests that Black patients are
being tested only when they are much more
likely to have COVID-19, at a higher threshold
of evidence. In all these examples, then, racial
differences in outcomes are concerning because
they suggest racial differences in the probability
thresholds people face — to undergo a police
search, to receive a loan, or to get a COVID-19
test.
But the previous literature on outcome
tests also illuminates a problem with simply
examining the positivity rate, called inframarginality (Ayres, 2002), which we explain by
adapting an example from Simoiu et al. (2017).
Imagine that there are two races — white and
Black — and within each race there are two

Generative model. On each day, the probability p that a person of race r in county d has
COVID-19 is drawn from a race and countyspecific risk distribution – a probability distribution on [0, 1]. p represents the probability a
person has COVID-19 given their relevant observable characteristics - for example, whether
they are coughing and whether they have recently been to large gatherings. Each person
gets tested if p exceeds a race and countyspecific testing threshold, zrd .
We let Prd denote the random variable corresponding to the risk distribution for each race
and county. The probability a person of a given
race in a given county will get tested, frd , is
the proportion of the risk distribution that lies
above the threshold, p(Prd > zrd ), that is, the
complementary cumulative distribution function of the risk distribution. The probability a
test will be positive, grd , is the expected value
of the risk distribution conditional on being
above the threshold: E(Prd |Prd > zrd ). The
observed data are drawn as as follows:

The latent parameters of the model are the
thresholds zrd and the parameters of the risk
distributions. Following Pierson et al. (2018,
2020), we parameterize the risk distributions
as discriminant distributions, which are twoparameter distributions on [0, 1] that facilitate fast inference in this setting. We allow
the risk distributions to vary by race and by
county to accommodate the fact that the true
prevalence of COVID-19 can vary by race and
county. To complete the Bayesian specification,
we must place priors on the latent parameters,
which we describe in our full model specification, available online.1 We infer posteriors over
the latent parameters using Hamiltonian Monte
Carlo (Neal, 1994), implemented in the probabilistic programming language Stan (Carpenter
et al., 2017).

Threshold tests for policing, proposed in Simoiu
et al. (2017) and applied in Pierson et al. (2018,
2020), use a Bayesian model to simultaneously
infer the race- and location-specific risk distributions and thresholds. For brevity, we refer
the reader to Simoiu et al. (2017) for a description of the original threshold test in the
context of policing, and here describe only our
adapted generative model for the COVID-19
context; Appendix A.2 details further how the
two models differ.

three pieces of information for all race groups r

cases (positive tests) for the race group in the

disparities, but they are less consistent, and
this analysis is not robust to infra-marginality.

5. Future Directions
There are broader potential applications of
threshold tests both in COVID-19 and in other
medical conditions. While we focus here on
racial disparities in COVID-19, one could assess COVID-19 under-testing across locations
or across other demographic dimensions like
age. Beyond COVID-19, threshold tests could
be used to measure racial disparities in undertesting and under-diagnosis in medicine more
broadly, an issue of known concern in cardiac
conditions Schulman et al. (1999), attention
deficit disorder (Coker et al., 2016), chronic
obstructive lung disease (Mamary et al., 2018),
depression (Sorkin et al., 2011) and other psychiatric conditions (Kunen et al., 2005). Assessing racial disparities in medical testing with
threshold tests thus offers a fruitful area for further research.

cases with known race. (All these quantities are reported in the raw data.) The
definitions for tests rather than cases, and
for non-Hispanic Blacks rather than nonHispanic whites, are analogous. We define

disparities in the entire population, and must
therefore model and make use of population
information (eg, from Census data). While the
number of police searches cannot exceed the
number of police stops (and the original authors therefore model the number of searches
as a Binomial draw from the number of stops),
the number of COVID-19 tests in a county can
exceed the number of people in a location (since
each person can be tested multiple times), so
a Binomial model is unsuitable. Pierson et al.
(2018) proposes a version of the threshold test
which incorporates population information, but
makes use of only the proportion rather than
the absolute population of each race group in
each location: eg, the population information
provided to their model is that “in County X,
40% of people are Hispanic, 20% are white, and
40% are Black”. This is unsuitable for our setting, because intuitively our inferences about
COVID-19 testing threshold and prevalence
should be very different in a county with 100
people and 10 tests, compared to a county with
10,000 people and 10 tests, even if the relative
fractions of each race group remain constant.
In the COVID-19 setting, we incorporate
population information by modelling the number of tests for each race group in each county
as a Poisson draw (whose rate parameter is proportional to the population of that race group
in that county). Our use of a Poisson bears
some similarity to the Poisson regression setting, in which a Poisson whose rate parameter
depends on covariates is used to model rates
in a population; a natural direction for future
work is to extend our model to accommodate
overdispersion via, eg, a quasi-Poisson or negative binomial model (Gardner et al., 1995).
As a further robustness check (Table A1), we
ensure that our primary results remain robust
when we replace the Poisson with a Binomial
distribution (which is similar to the original
specification in Simoiu et al. (2017)), even
though the latter makes less sense conceptually.

(weighted mean across counties, weighting by total tests conducted in the county)
for one specification: one data processing method (first column) and one model
(second column), with the primary specification which is used to generate all results
in the paper in the first row. The next three columns report the inferred thresholds
(reporting the mean of the posterior MCMC draws, followed by 95% confidence interval
