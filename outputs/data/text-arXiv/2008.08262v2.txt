In the context of the recent COVID-19 outbreak, quarantine has been used to "flatten the curve" and slow the
spread of the disease. In this paper, we show that this is not the only benefit of quarantine for the mitigation of
an SIR epidemic spreading on a graph. Indeed, human contact networks exhibit a powerlaw structure, which
means immunizing nodes at random is extremely ineffective at slowing the epidemic, while immunizing
high-degree nodes can efficiently guarantee herd immunity. We theoretically prove that if quarantines are
declared at the right moment, high-degree nodes are disproportionately in the Removed state, which is a form
of targeted immunization. Even if quarantines are declared too early, subsequent waves of infection spread
slower than the first waves. This leads us to propose an opening and closing strategy aiming at immunizing
the graph while infecting the minimum number of individuals, guaranteeing the population is now robust
to future infections. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only strategy that guarantees herd immunity
without requiring vaccines. We extensively verify our results on simulated and real-life networks.

INTRODUCTION

Most real-life networks, from the technological (the Internet [15, 44], train routes [70], electronic
circuits [39]) to the biological (neural networks [81, 82], protein interaction networks [40]) exhibit
a powerlaw structure. Human networks are no exception (the film actors network [7, 81], the
telephone-call graph [3, 4], the sexual contact graph [49, 50]). Recent tracking studies have confirmed
that the network of proximity contact follows the same distribution [41, 68].
When it comes to epidemics, this has terrible consequences. In particular, this means that the
epidemic threshold is vanishing [62], which implies that measures to reduce the probability of
infection (hand-washing, social distancing, etc.) can slow the spread of the disease, but not stop the
outbreak. It also implies that an outbreak is likely to start anew even from a single infected individual
(𝑒.𝑔. a traveler). Only measures that break the structure of the graph (such as quarantine, closing
restaurants and parks, prohibiting groups of more than 10 etc.) can stop the spread. Moreover,
powerlaw graphs are incredibly resistant to 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑜𝑚 failures [6], which means that removing
individuals at random (for instance if they received a vaccine, or if they caught the disease and

developed immunity) will not change these properties. As most countries affected by COVID-19
are relaxing quarantine while many infected individuals remain infected, one might think that the
second wave will be identical to the first wave.
However, if powerlaw graphs are resistant to random failure, they are very susceptible to targeted
immunization [6]. As shown in the previously mentioned paper, vaccinating only a small percentage
of the nodes of the graph (the nodes of highest degree) is enough to achieve herd immunity, while
it is never achievable with random immunization. The key observation here is that epidemic spread
is 𝑛𝑜𝑡 equivalent to random immunization. In particular, nodes of high degree get infected much
more quickly than nodes of low degree [62]. If we let the epidemic run its course, this superspreader
phenomenon would just help the epidemic spread rapidly to all the nodes in the network. However,
if the epidemic is temporarily halted, say because of a mandatory quarantine, in the SIR model
this implies that nodes of high degree will become immunized without having had the possibility
of spreading the infection. Multiple quarantines can then become an ersatz to achieving herd
immunity (or at least slow its spread and "flatten the curve") before a vaccine is developed.
Note that if we let the disease spread and infect the entire population, we would technically
achieve herd immunity. Our goal is then to balance how many people get infected while guaranteeing the population gets immunized. Leveraging results from random graphs analysis and
percolation theory, we theoretically show that even a 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑙𝑒 well-timed quarantine can be used to
achieve herd immunity and significantly reduce the fraction of the infected population.
1.1

Relevant work

The study of epidemics on graphs is an active field of research. An important body of work assumes
the underlying graph is known, and focuses on modeling epidemics [17, 20, 33, 51, 83, 86], detecting
whether there is an epidemic [8, 9, 42, 47, 56, 58, 59], finding communities [65, 84], localizing the
source of the spread [21, 71–73, 76, 77, 80] or instead obfuscating it [27–29], or controlling their
spread [22, 23, 30, 35, 45, 63, 79, 85]. The inverse problem, recovering the network from epidemic
data, has also been extensively studied [1, 19, 34, 36, 43, 61, 64].
This paper is interested in immunization strategies. [6] already showed that immunizing about 3%
of the nodes of highest degree is enough to reach herd immunity for any powerlaw graph, no matter
the exponent. [18] proposed a local strategy in case the global structure of the graph is unknown: we
pick a fraction 𝜌 of the population; each of those individuals then names someone they personally
know. It turns out that the person selected has a higher chance of being well-connected than the
person who nominated them, following the well-known principle stating that "your friends have
more friends than you." This paper relies on a similar idea: someone infecting someone else is
similar to someone nominating someone else, which explains why nodes of highest degree get
infected faster. Other immunization strategies have been proposed [13, 16, 37, 69].
Many scientists have joined the fight against COVID-19, and work has been done to predict
the evolution of the epidemic [12, 24, 32, 74], predict diagnostics [2, 75], analyze the spread of
misinformation about the pandemic online [5, 60], design tracking algorithms and technologies
[11, 14, 53], analyze testing and interventions policies [25, 26, 52, 54], and more. One other work
[31] has analyzed quarantine strategies, albeit without taking into consideration the impact on the
graph, which is our main contribution. This work aims to analyze quarantines and emphasize their
impact as a targeted immunization strategy, which would be robust to future reinfections (contrary
to contact tracing strategies, for instance).

• While quarantines have been introduced to slow the spread of COVID-19, we show that they
transform the structure of the human contact graph, and negatively impact the diffusion of
the disease during the subsequent waves.
• We characterize when to declare the quarantine in order to achieve herd immunity. For
simple powerlaw graph of exponent 3 in the configuration model, this corresponds to when
about 8% of the graph is infected.
• While the number above is higher than what we would hope, it is important to note that after
this single quarantine, outbreaks cannot start again from a constant number of individuals.
As such, this is the first long-term immunization solution which is robust to reinfections but
does not require a vaccine.
• If we have some limitations on the maximum number of infected individuals (𝑒.𝑔. a limited
number of hospital beds), we experimentally show that we can declare multiple quarantines
and recover the result from a single quarantine.
• We experimentally confirm our results on a wide range of simulated and real-life networks.
While our theoretical results are proven on a specific random graph model, we experimentally
show that relaxing the theoretical assumptions we require in our proofs (infinite graph,
vanishing clustering coefficient, etc.) does not qualitatively impact the results. In particular,
well-timed quarantines are a valid targeted immunization strategy for real-life networks.

PRELIMINARIES
Notations

The epidemic spreads on a (possibly infinite) directed graph 𝐺 = (𝑉 , 𝐸), where 𝑉 is the set of nodes
and 𝐸 the set of edges. If |𝑉 | < ∞, we write |𝑉 | = 𝑁 . When considering a random graph drawn
from a specific distribution D, we denote by 𝑃𝑘 the random variable representing the number of
nodes of degree 𝑘 in the graph, 𝑝𝑘 the fraction of nodes of degree 𝑘, < 𝑘 > the average degree
(𝑘+1)𝑝
given the graph, and 𝑞𝑘 the fraction of nodes of excess degree 𝑘, defined by 𝑞𝑘 = <𝑘> 𝑘 . As a

Model

SIR model on graphs: We consider the spread of a Susceptible → Infected → Removed (SIR)
epidemic on a directed graph 𝐺 = (𝑉 , 𝐸), possibly infinite. Each node belongs to one of these
three states. Infected nodes can infect the susceptible nodes with which they share an edge, also
called their 𝑛𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑏𝑜𝑟𝑠 in the graph. Each infection along an edge is independent of other infections.
Infected nodes spontaneously transition to the Removed state after a non-deterministic time. Once
in the Removed state, nodes do not interact with the epidemic anymore.

Spreading model: The results presented in this paper are spreading-mechanism agnostic. Our
theoretical results do not rely on restrictions on the spreading process. While our experiments are
shown on classical continuous-time SIR spread, we do not believe the spreading process would
change the outcome.
Configuration model: Our theoretical results are established in the configuration model [62], an
established setting to study random graphs. In this model, we specify the number of nodes 𝑃𝑘 of
degree 𝑘. We assume the sum of all 𝑃𝑘 is even. We then assign stubs to nodes, such that the number
of nodes with 𝑘 stubs is exactly 𝑃𝑘 . Following this, we pick two stubs at random, and connect
them. We repeat the process until no stubs are left. We say the resulting graph was drawn from the
∞ .
configuration model with degrees sequence {𝑃𝑘 }𝑘=0
Powerlaw graphs: We emphasize the results on powerlaw graphs. A powerlaw gaph of exponent
𝛼 is a random graph with degree distribution following the law 𝑝𝑘 ∼ 𝑘𝐶𝛼 .
Simple powerlaw graphs: We say a graph is a simple powerlaw graph of exponent 𝛼 if its
1 1
distribution follows exactly 𝑝𝑘 = 𝜁 (𝛼)
𝑘 𝛼 for 𝑘 ≥ 1, 𝛼 > 1.
Barabási–Albert (BA) graph: A Barabási–Albert (BA) graph of parameter 𝑚 is constructed by
adding nodes one by one, each new node attaching 𝑚 new edges to previous nodes, picking the
node to attach to at random with probability proportional to the degree of the previous nodes (preferential attachment). These graphs follow the configuration model by construction. In expectation,
these graphs have powerlaw distribution with exponent 3, with exact degree distribution given by
2𝑚 (𝑚+1)
𝐶
𝑝𝑘 = 𝑘 (𝑘+1)
(𝑘+2) ∼ 𝑘 3 for 𝑘 ≥ 𝑚.
2.3

Known results in the configuration model

We recall known results in the configuration model, which we use in the rest of our proofs.
Claim 1 (Exponential growth, proved in [62]). In the configuration model, the reproductive
number 𝑅 = 𝑐𝑐 21 , which represents the number of 2𝑛𝑑 neighbors divided by the number of 1𝑠𝑡 neighbors,
𝑁 . Its value is:
can be computed from the sequence of degrees {𝑃𝑘 }𝑘=0
𝑅=

E[𝑘 2 ] − E[𝑘]
.
E[𝑘]

Claim 2 (Herd immunity, proved in [62]). In the configuration model, an outbreak is possible if
and only if 𝑅 > 1, or equivalently:
E[𝑘 2 ] − 2E[𝑘] > 0.
If the above equation is not satisfied, we have achieved herd immunity.
Lemma 1 (Disparity in infection rate by degree, proved in [62]). In the configuration model,
let 𝑢 (𝑡) be the expected fraction of nodes of degree 1 in the susceptible state after time 𝑡. Then as a first
order approximation, the expected fraction of nodes of degree 𝑘 in the susceptible state is 𝑢 (𝑡)𝑘 .
Remark: The lemma above is a approximation. In particular, it takes into account how many
nodes of degree 𝑘 become Removed because they got infected, but not that the number of nodes
of degree 𝑘 decreases as their neighbors gets infected (as their degree becomes lower than 𝑘) and
increases whenever nodes of degree 𝑘 + 𝑐 get 𝑐 neighbors in the Removed state.

Known results for powerlaw graphs

We start by recalling the definition of epidemic thresholds:
Definition 2 (Epidemic threshold, proved in [62]). For SIR epidemics on graph, there exists a
phase transition. If the parameters of the epidemic are above the epidemic threshold, outbreaks occur;
otherwise, the epidemic dies out quickly. The closer we are to the epidemic threshold (from above), the
smaller the outbreak is.
The crucial result about human networks is that epidemic threshold for infinite powerlaw graphs
is 0.
Lemma 2 (Vanishing threshold, Proved in [62]). Infinite powerlaw graphs with exponents
between 2 and 3.4788 have a vanishing epidemic threshold.
The higher the reproductive number 𝑅 is compared to the epidemic threshold, the more likely
an outbreak occurs, and the bigger its expected size is. When the epidemic threshold is 0, this
means that changing the parameters of the spread (for instance by enforcing hand-washing or
masks-wearing) can slow the spread of the disease and reduce the total number of infected people,
but not prevent that there will be an outbreak. It also means that a single infected traveler can
restart a major outbreak. In practice, real graphs are finite, which implies the epidemic threshold is
bounded away from 0. However, the larger the graph, the lower the epidemic threshold.
Claim 3. The generative function of the degrees 𝑔0 and excess degrees 𝑔1 for an infinite powerlaw
graph of parameter 𝛼 is given by:

3 ONE QUARANTINE
In this section, we prove our main result, which is that for certain types of graphs, it is possible
to achieve herd immunity by timing a single quarantine adequately. We therefore study the effect
of quarantine timing on the structure of the graph. We are particularly interested in whether it
is possible to achieve herd immunity, and how to minimize the total number of people who have
been touched by the epidemic. For the remainder of the paper, we study perfect quarantines, as
defined below:
Definition 3 (Quarantine). We call perfect quarantine (henceforth just quarantine) the complete
halt of the spread of the epidemic. During a quarantine, all Infected nodes transition to the Removed
state, and no new nodes become Infected.
3.1

The quarantine operator

In the configuration model, the expected behavior of the spread of epidemics is governed by the
𝑁 −1 . We start by studying the impact of a quarantine on that sequence of
sequences of degrees {𝑃𝑘 }𝑘=0
degrees.
Lemma 3. Let 𝑢 (𝑡) be the fraction of nodes of degree 1 that are susceptible after letting the epidemic
spread for time 𝑡. Suppose we declare a quarantine when 𝑢 (𝑡) reaches the value 𝑢. Let 𝑇𝑄 : N𝑁 → R𝑁
be the operator representing the transformation of the expected number of susceptible nodes after one
iteration of letting the epidemic grow, then declaring a quarantine. Then:

𝑇𝑄 ({𝑃𝑘 }𝑘=0
) = {𝑃𝑘 · 𝑢 𝑘 }𝑘=0
.

Proof. This is a direct implication of Lemma 1 from the Preliminaries.
As it turns out, the number of nodes in the Removed state can be computed easily from the above
result.
Claim 4. Let 𝑔0 (𝑧) be the generative function of the distribution of degrees. The expected fraction
of nodes in the Removed state after one quarantine 𝑅𝑄 is:
𝑅𝑄 = 1 − 𝑔0 (𝑢).
Proof. Let 𝑝𝑘 be the fraction of nodes of degrees 𝑘 in the graph, so that 𝑃𝑘 = 𝑁 · 𝑝𝑘 . Notice that
for 𝑘 ≥ 𝑁 , there exist no nodes of that degree, so 𝑝𝑘 = 0. The generative function of the distribution

Achieving herd immunity

3.2.1 General graphs. It is possible to give general results for any graph in the configuration model,
which we do in this section.
Claim 5. Let 𝑢 be the remaining fraction of susceptible nodes of degree 1 when we start the
quarantine. We achieve herd immunity for 𝑢 such that:
𝑢 2𝑔0′′ (𝑢) − 𝑢𝑔0′ (𝑢) ≤ 0.

However, further analysis requires better knowledge of the network topology. We now focus on
specific types of random graphs.
3.2.2 Simple powerlaw graphs. Here, we provide our first numerical results for simple powerlaw
graphs, and show that well-timed quarantine can guarantee herd immunity while drastically
reducing the fraction of Infected nodes.
Claim 6. Let 𝑢 be the remaining fraction of susceptible nodes of degree 1 when we start the
quarantine. For an infinite simple powerlaw graph of exponent 3, we achieve herd immunity for
𝑢 ≤ 0.940599.
Proof. We want to find 𝑢 such that:

Where 𝐿𝑖 2 (𝑢) is the polylog-2 function. Solving this equation numerically yields 𝑢 ≤ 0.940599.
We now look at the total number of nodes in the Removed state in this case:
Claim 7. For a simple infinite powerlaw graph of exponent 3, if we declare a quarantine when
a fraction 𝑢 ′ = 0.940599 of nodes of degree 1 are still in the susceptible state, then by the end of
quarantine, at least 𝑅𝑄 = 92.2912% of the nodes are still in the susceptible state.
Proof. Remembering that 𝐶 =

where 𝜁 (𝑥) =

Combining Claims 6 and 7, the network can therefore achieve herd immunity while infecting a
bit less than 8% of the nodes:
Theorem 1. For simple infinite powerlaw graphs of exponent 3, min-degree 1, it is possible to
achieve herd immunity by declaring a single quarantine when a bit less than 6% of the nodes of degree
1 are Infected. In this case, less than 8% of the nodes will be Removed at the end of the quarantine.
Remarks:
• Far from only "flattening the curve", quarantines can be used to achieve herd immunity.
• The result above is both positive (only 8% of Removed nodes) and disappointing: this is the
best achievable, in the sense that nothing else we can do in this optimistic quarantine model
can reduce the fraction of Removed nodes at the end. In most cases, 8% of the population
being Infected represents millions of people, and is not desirable. In the case of COVID-19,
however, the fraction of Infected people has passed this number in a number of countries.
• The result above is valid for simple powerlaw graph. The exact percentage varies widely
with the type of powerlaw graph, as we see below, and in section 4.

3.2.3 Barabási–Albert (BA) graphs. BA graphs are a well-known family of random powerlaw
graphs. We show below that quarantine-based immunization strategies require a higher number
of Removed nodes by the time we achieve herd immunity than simple powerlaw graphs (despite
having the same min-degree). The exact value of the gain depends on the sequence of of degrees
𝑁 −1 , but the qualitative behavior remains the same.
{𝑃𝑘 }𝑘=0
Claim 8. Let u be the remaining fraction of susceptible nodes of degree 1 when we start the
quarantine. For a Barabási–Albert (BA) of parameter 𝑚 = 1, we achieve herd immunity if we declare a
quarantine when:
𝑢 2 − 4𝑢 + 3𝑢 log(1 − 𝑢) − 4 log(1 − 𝑢) ≤ 0.
Solving numerically, we obtain 𝑢 ≤ 0.776621.
Proof. Let 𝑔0 (𝑢) =
𝑚 = 1. We know 𝑝𝑘 =

Since we need 𝑢 2𝑔0′′ (𝑢) −𝑢𝑔0′ (𝑢) ≤ 0 according to Claim 5, this is equivalent to 𝑢 2 −4𝑢 +3𝑢 log(1−
𝑢) − 4 log(1 − 𝑢) ≤ 0. Numerically, we obtain 0 ≤ 𝑢 ≤ 0.776621.
Theorem 2. For a BA graphs of parameter 𝑚 = 1, it is possible to achieve herd immunity by
declaring a single quarantine when a bit less than 23% of the nodes of degree 1 are Infected. In this
case, less than 33% of the nodes will be Removed at the end of the quarantine.
3.2.4 Non-powerlaw graphs. The fact that quarantines can be used as a targeted immunization
strategy is a direct result of the heavy-tail distribution of human networks. Here, we illustrate that
if contact networks had a different graph structure, we could not achieve herd immunity using
a well-timed quarantine without infecting most of the graph – if not the entire graph. We prove
this for Poisson graphs, which do have a tail, albeit lighter than powerlaw graphs, and 𝑑-regular
graphs, which do not have a tail.
𝑘 −𝜆

Proposition 3. For Poisson graphs of parameter 𝜆 in the configuration model, i.e. with 𝑝𝑘 = 𝜆 𝑘!𝑒
for 𝑘 ≥ 0, it is possible to achieve herd immunity after one quarantine. To compare with BA graphs of
parameter 𝑚 = 1, we pick 𝜆 = 2, so that both graphs will have same average degree. In this case, a bit
more than 63% of nodes will be in the Removed state when herd immunity is achieved.
Proof. For Poisson graphs in the configuration model, we have:

Using Claim 5, we need to declare a quarantine when the fraction of nodes of degree 1 𝑢 is such
that:
0 ≥ 𝑢 2𝑔0′′ (𝑢) − 𝑢𝑔0′ (𝑢)
= 𝑢 2 𝜆 2𝑒 𝜆𝑥−𝜆 − 𝑢𝜆𝑒 𝜆𝑥−𝜆
= 𝑢𝜆(𝑢𝜆 − 1)𝑒 𝜆𝑥−𝜆 .
The epidemic threshold is therefore achieved after one quarantine declared when 𝑢 = 𝜆1 . In this
case, the total number of nodes in the Removed state at the end of the infection is, in expectation,
1
1 − 𝑒 𝜆 𝜆 −𝜆 = 1 − 𝑒 1−𝜆 . When 𝜆 = 2, we obtain 1 − 𝑒1 ≈ 63.2121%.
□
While the tail of Poisson graphs is not as heavy as powerlaw graph, it is still possible to achieve
herd immunity, albeit at the cost of infecting a larger fraction of the population. For random
d-regular graphs, however, it is impossible to use quarantines as a targeted immunization strategy:
Proposition 4. For random 𝑑-regular graphs in the configuration model, i.e. with 𝑝𝑑 = 1 and for
𝑘 ≠ 𝑑, 𝑝𝑘 = 0, it is possible to achieve herd immunity after one quarantine for 𝑑 > 2.
Proof. See Appendix.
3.2.5 Summary. We summarize the results above in Table 1. We notice that experimental value are
always below our theoretical predictions. As expected, on powerlaw graphs, Quarantine/ExperimentsQ perform worse than High-degree, but significantly better than Random, although they do not
require any vaccines. For graphs with lighter tail however, Random performs better. Using quarantine as a targeted immunization strategy is therefore only possible thanks to the very specific
distribution of human networks.

Table 1. We show immunization strategies on multiple network topologies: two powerlaw graphs (heavy-tail),
a Poisson graph (lighter tail) and a d-regular graph (no tail). The number represent the number of nodes we
need to immunize, either by vaccinating them (for Random and High-degree) or by just letting the epidemic
spread (for Quarantine). In the Random strategy, we immunize nodes at random. In the High-degree strategy,
we immunize nodes by decreasing values of degree. The Quarantine column represents our theoretical
predictions, and Experiments-Q the values observed experimentally.

Minimizing the final number of Removed nodes

Below the epidemic threshold, the expected fraction of the population in the Removed state by
the end of the epidemic is 0. However, above the epidemic threshold, not all nodes may become
Infected by the end of the outbreak, and outbreaks tend to be of small size just above the epidemic
threshold. Instead of timing quarantines to reach herd immunity, we might instead allow small
outbreaks after our quarantine, provided that it reduces the final number of nodes in the Removed
state. In this section, we study how to minimize this final number of Removed nodes, even if that
means no reaching herd immunity.

In general, the expected total number of nodes in the Removed state at the end of an epidemic is
in general given by:
Claim 9 (From Newman [62]). Let 𝜙 be the probability that an Infected node infects its susceptible
neighbor, and 𝑔0 be the generative function of the degrees of the nodes in the graph, and 𝑔1 the generative
function of the excess degrees. Then the expected number of Removed nodes at the end of the epidemic
𝑆 is given by:
𝑆 = 1 − 𝑔0 (𝑣),
where 𝑣 is the solution of the equation:
𝑣 = 1 − 𝜙 + 𝜙𝑔1 (𝑣).
Notice that if 𝑣 = 1, we are below the epidemic threshold, and 𝑆 = 0. We can compute the
generative functions of the degrees and the excess degrees of the graph after a quarantine has been
declared:

Now, it is possible to express the total number of Removed nodes 𝑅(𝑢) as a function of 𝑢, the
fraction of susceptible nodes when we declare the quarantine:
Lemma 4. Suppose we declare a quarantine when a fraction 𝑢 of nodes of degree 1 remain susceptible,
then have an outbreak start again after the quarantine. The total expected fraction of Removed nodes
𝑅(𝑢) is given by:
𝑅(𝑢) = 1 − 𝑔0 (𝑢 · 𝑣),
with 𝑣 solution of 𝑣 = 1 − 𝜙 + 𝜙

𝑔1 (𝑢 ·𝑣)
𝑔1 (𝑢) .

Proof. Let 𝑅beforeQ (𝑢) be the number of Removed nodes at the end of a quarantine, and 𝑅afterQ (𝑢)
be the expected number of Removed nodes if an outbreak starts again after the quarantine. The
total expected fraction of Removed nodes is given by 𝑅(𝑢) = 𝑅beforeQ (𝑢) + 𝑅afterQ (𝑢). We know,
according to Claim 7, that:
𝑅beforeQ (𝑢) = 1 − 𝑔0 (𝑢).
We now position ourselves in the graph composed of only the nodes in the Susceptible state after
the first quarantine. Notice that this graph is composed of a fraction 𝑔0 (𝑢) of the nodes of the
original graph. According to Claims 9 and 10, we also have:


𝑔0 (𝑢 · 𝑣)
𝑄
𝑅afterQ (𝑢) = 𝑔0 (𝑢) · (1 − 𝑔0 (𝑣)) = 𝑔0 (𝑢) · 1 −
= 𝑔0 (𝑢) − 𝑔0 (𝑢 · 𝑣),
𝑔0 (𝑢)
𝑔 (𝑢 ·𝑣)

𝑄

with 𝑣 solution of 𝑣 = 1 − 𝜙 + 𝜙𝑔1 (𝑣) = 1 − 𝜙 + 𝜙 𝑔1 1 (𝑢) .
Combining the two results, we get 𝑅(𝑢) = 1 − 𝑔0 (𝑢) + 𝑔0 (𝑢) − 𝑔0 (𝑢 · 𝑣) = 1 − 𝑔0 (𝑢 · 𝑣), which
conclude the proof.
□
The equations above do not have closed form solutions in general, nor for powerlaw graphs in
particular. However, we see in the experiment section below that 𝑅(𝑢) always seems to exhibit a V
shape. If the expected size of an outbreak after a quarantine is very small, it might be better in term
of the total number of Infected nodes to declare a quarantine early: letting the infection spread
before a quarantine is declared (i.e. when the epidemic is probably in its exponential growth phase)
would infect more nodes than having a small outbreak after the quarantine. Minimizing the total
number of Infected nodes 𝑅(𝑢) is therefore related, but not equivalent to reaching herd immunity.
We study 𝑅(𝑢) in more details in the next section.
4 EXPERIMENTS
The remainder of this paper focuses on empirical validation of our theoretical results on a variety of
networks, both synthetically generated and taken from real world data sets. We begin by describing
the networks examined and the simulation technique. Then we validate the major premise of this
work: that higher degree nodes become Infected much more rapidly than lower degree nodes. Then
we qualitatively and quantitatively describe the optimal time at which a single quarantine should
be enacted, ablating on a variety of simulation parameters. Finally we discuss what is attainable in
simulation when multiple quarantines are allowed.
4.1

Networks and Simulation Technique

Simulation setup: We first describe the simulation environment. All simulations are run using a
continuous-time event-driven algorithm modeling an SIR infection [57]. The infection parameters
are 𝛽 and 𝛾 corresponding to the infection and recovery parameters respectively. We initialize an
infection by uniformly randomly selecting 𝜌 nodes to be Infected. When a quarantine is enacted,

111:12

Hoffmann and Jordan, et al.

every node in the Infected compartment is moved to the Removed compartment and we reinitialize
the infection by randomly selecting 𝜌 susceptible nodes to be Infected after the quarantine. As
opposed to the previous section, in which quarantines were declared based on the fraction of
Susceptible nodes of degree 1 remaining, here we declare quarantines based on the fraction of the
general population that has already been Infected (i.e., in the Infected or Removed state, but not in
the Susceptible state). We refer to a "quarantine threshold" as the fraction of the general population
not in the Susceptible state when we declare the quarantine. All simulations are run until there are
no more Infected nodes. Unless otherwise noted, we examine synthetic graphs with 10K nodes
and set 𝜌 to be equal to 10. By default, we set the recovery parameter 𝛾 to be 1 and primarily focus
on the modest regime with infection parameter 𝛽 as 12 . This places us in the regime where the
infection typically spreads throughout the entire population, though we also ablate against varying
𝛽
ratios of 𝛾 .
Synthetic Networks: We run our simulations on a wide variety of synthetic networks. We describe
these classes of networks here, briefly describing their structure and construction, and finally
discuss a realistic choice for parameters.
The classical model proposed by Barabasi and Albert produces a graph with a power-law degree
distribution with exponent 3 [10]. This model operates via an incremental growth mechanism
leveraging preferential attachment: new nodes are added incrementally and connected to a fixed
number 𝑚 of existing nodes, where the probability of connection to a node is proportional to the
degree of that node. There are two parameters of interest here: 𝑁 , the number of nodes, and 𝑚, the
number of edges added upon the inclusion of a new node. We refer to such graphs as BA graphs.
While BA graphs have, by design, scale-free degree distributions that emulate many real-world
networks, they typically do not have the clustering behavior of real world networks. The clustering
coefficient introduced by Watts and Strogatz quantifies this behavior as follows. The local clustering coefficient of node 𝑖 in a network is defined as the number of edges contained within the
neighborhood of node 𝑖, divided by the number of edges in a clique of the same size. The global
clustering coefficient is the average local clustering coefficient over all nodes in the network. The
Watts Strogatz network model generates a random graph with small average path lengths and more
realistic clustering coefficients, however does not yield a graph with a scale-free degree distribution
[81]. We refer to such graphs as WS graphs.
To rectify this situation and yield a network with a scale-free degree distribution and controllable
clustering coefficients, Holme and Kim modified the BA network model [38]. This graph model,
which we shall refer to as the power-law cluster, or PLC, model, follows the incremental growth
and preferential attachment steps of the algorithm used to generate BA graphs, with one additional
step: upon adding a new edge, say to node 𝑗, with a specified probability, a new edge is added to a
neighbor of 𝑗. This network model has three parameters: 𝑁 , the number of nodes; 𝑚, the number
of edges added by the preferential attachment step; and 𝑝, the probability of adding a new edge to
a neighbor. The clustering coefficient is controlled by the parameter 𝑝.
Similar to the PLC model is the random-walk model, RW, first introduced by Vázquez, which
aims to generate a network in a method that emulates organic edge creation in a social network
[78]. New nodes are added incrementally, where each node selects a random extant node to perform
a random walk on. At each step, the random walk terminates with fixed probability, and each node
in the random walk is connected to the new node with a fixed probability. This model generates
networks with scale-free degree distributions and tunable clustering coefficients. The model has
parameters: 𝑁 , specifying the size of the graph; 𝑞𝑒 , the probability of continuing the random walk;
and 𝑞 𝑣 , the probability of adding an edge for each element of the random walk.

Table 2. Summary of Synthetic Networks considered. The parameters used for construction are provided,
and summary statistics of the average degree, clustering coefficient, and average length of shortest path
between two randomly selected nodes. We also use cumulative binning to estimate the powerlaw exponent
for the degree distribution. All networks have 10k nodes. While these networks are randomly constructed,
the summary statistics concentrate tightly around the reported values.

Finally, we consider the Nearest Neighbor model that emulates the behavior that two people with
a mutual friend are more likely to become friends [78]. New nodes are connected to a random extant
node and a random selection of 2-hop neighbors of the connected node. We use the modification
where we also connect 𝑘 pairs of random nodes upon addition of each graph. This process yields
networks with scale-free degree distribution, and tunable clustering [67]. This model has parameters:
𝑁
Synthetic Network Parameter Selection: Each of the network models described above have at
least one tunable parameter in addition to their parameter controlling network size. This begs the
question of how these parameters should be chosen to emulate real-world social networks, such
that a reasonable epidemic simulation may be performed. Fortunately, there is depth of prior work
in fitting random network models to real world networks [55, 67]. We typically use the parameter
as specified in [67] that have been fit to a region-based subnetwork from a private Facebook social
graph. These parameters, as well as the average degree, clustering coefficient, and best-fit scale-free
parameter are described in Table 2.
Real-world networks: We also perform simulations on three main classes of social networks. First
we consider the large social network datasets on Facebook and Deezer, as presented in [66]. For
Facebook, an edge denotes a mutual like for a verified facebook page of a particular category; for
Deezer, edges are friendships. Next, we consider the Arxiv physics collaboration datasets taken
from [46]. The data covers papers on Arxiv from the period of January 1993 and April 2003. Here
nodes represent authors and a node exists between two authors if they appear on a paper together.
All datasets were collected via SNAP [48].
4.2

Groupwise Survival Rates

We start with an experiment that motivates the premise of this work: higher degree nodes are
more readily Infected, and lower-degree nodes survive much longer. This was shown in [62] in
the configuration model, but we verify that it still applies even when the configuration model
assumptions are violated (e.g. for real-life networks). As mentioned in 2.3, this behavior is an
approximation. We verify the approximation holds for a real-world Facebook graph in Figure 1
(left). In this plot, we have grouped the 1,3,5% of nodes with highest degree and the nodes with the
lowest degree, e.g. 10 for the BA graphwith (𝑚 = 10). The vertical axis corresponds to the fraction
of that group that resides in either the Infected or Removed compartment, and the horizontal axis
corresponds to the fraction of the entire population in the Infected or Removed compartments. The

rates. Observe that the higher degree nodes become Infected much more quickly than the population average.
On the right, we observe the proportion of simultaneously Infected population versus time. The Blue curves
indicate the no quarantine setting; the green curves minimize the peak height, whereas the red curves
minimize the total number of Infected nodes.

dotted line corresponds to the case where the group considered is the entire population. Curves
that lie above the dotted line indicate groups that are Infected more rapidly than average nodes.
We plot a similar result for a synthetic BA graph with (𝑚 = 10) in the appendix. We remark that
the considered Facebook graph is even starker than the BA graph, suggesting that this effect is
stronger in real networks than some of the synthetic networks considered.

Single Quarantine Results

We first present results when only a single quarantine was enacted. Throughout we focus our
attention on the GEMSEC Facebook Artist network, a real-life network. Most experiments are also
conducted on Barabasi-Albert networks with parameter 𝑚 = 10, and can be found on the Appendix.
We ultimately demonstrate that the trends exhibited in these networks also are present in the other
networks described in Tables 2 and 3.
We outline our single quarantine results. First we demonstrate the curves of the number of
Infected nodes versus time to demonstrate the effects of a well-placed quarantine. Then we describe
what happens to the total and maximum number of nodes Infected as we vary when the quarantine
is enacted, arguing that there are three distinct qualitative quarantine regimes. Next we focus more
closely on the structure of a surviving network once an optimally placed quarantine is applied.
Then we describe the properties of the second wave of an epidemic that occurs after a quarantine
is enacted. Finally we ablate against the infectiousness parameter to demonstrate how a weaker or
stronger infection affects the aforementioned results.
4.3.1 Survival Versus Time. We consider the GEMSEC Facebook artist graph. For this network, in
Figure 1 (right) we plot the number of nodes currently Infected versus time under three quarantine
settings. In blue, we plot the no-quarantine scenario as a baseline. In red we plot the quarantine
strategy that minimizes the total number of nodes who become Infected, and in green we plot
the quarantine strategy that minimizes the maximum number of nodes who are Infected at any
one time. The blue curve describes one potential goal for controlling an epidemic: minimizing the
total number of people who ever are Infected by the disease. Whereas the green curve describes
another potential goal that gained particular attention in the COVID-19 pandemic: ensuring that
the medical system was not overwhelmed at any one time. A similar plot is shown in the Appendix,
where we note these curves are qualitatively similar between the real and synthetic networks.
4.3.2 Varying the Quarantine Threshold. Continuing with our primary examples of GEMSEC.fb.artist
and BA10 graphs, we plot the total number of nodes who were Infected versus the quarantine
threshold in Figure 2. In each plot, the red curve represents the maximum number of simultaneously
Infected nodes, whereas the blue curve represents the total number of Infected nodes. We notice
three distinct regions along these curves. The first region occurs when the quarantine occurs very
early and not enough of the high-degree nodes of the network have been affected. In this case, the
second epidemic dominates and the "second wave" has a larger peak. The minimum of the red curve
denotes the boundary between the first and second region and corresponds to the situation where
the peak-height of the first and second waves are balanced. The second region occurs between the
minimum of the red and blue curves and represents the situation where the first wave has a larger
peak but the quarantine is effective in reducing the total number of Infected nodes. The optimal
number of total Infected nodes is attained at the earliest quarantine that ensures that there is no
second wave. This is observable by noticing that the blue curve in the third region is colinear with
the identity line: if there were a secondary infection, the blue curve would lie strictly above the
identity line. In the right-hand plot of Figure 2 we note that there is a flat region of the blue curve
when the quarantine threshold is very high: this is because the epidemic parameters are such that
the population is never entirely Infected.
To demonstrate that the trends shown above do not apply only to these archetypal networks,
we present the total number of Infected nodes versus quarantine threshold for the entire suite
of synthetic and real networks in Figure 3. Notice that each of these networks display the same
qualitative features but differ in their height, maximal benefit of quarantine, and location of optimal
quarantine threshold.

Fig. 2. Proportion of population Infected in total (blue curves), and maximum simultaneously Infected
population (red curves) versus the quarantine threshold. The left plot is for the BA network, and the right
plot is for the GEMSEC Fb.Artist network. Notice that these graphs are qualitatively similar and there are
three distinct regions. In the first region, the quarantine is enacted early and the second wave dominates. In
the second region, the quarantine is enacted such that the second wave is larger than the first wave, and in
the third region there is no second wave. To minimize the number of Infected nodes in total, there should be
no second wave.

Fig. 3. We plot the same graphs as in Figure 2, for the whole suite of synthetic networks (left), the GEMSEC
networks (middle) and the Arxiv Collaboration networks. We only plot the total Infected curves (blue in Figure
2). We note that while varying graphs may have various quarantine strategy and efficacy, the qualitative
properties remain.

4.3.3 Structural Changes After a Quarantine. Now we examine the structure of the remaining
subgraph after an optimal quarantine has been enacted. In Table 4 we compare various graph
metrics between the original network and the network that results after performing the singlequarantine that minimizes the total number of Infected nodes. We consider the average degree
and average shortest path. Average shortest path is taken by considering 100,000 random pairs
of nodes in the largest connected component and computing their shortest path. We notice that
for all synthetic graphs, except Watts Strogatz, the average degree reduces dramatically with the
optimal-quarantine networks having degrees between 1 and 2. The shortest paths increase by

small-world-effect, thus it is no surprise that a second wave cannot occur. In table 5 we show
similar results for real networks. This indicates that the reductions in average degree and increase
in shortest path length under an optimal quarantine are present in a realistic setting as well, albeit
to not so drastic an extent.
4.3.4 Characterizing the secondary infection. If a quarantine is enacted before herd immunity is
reached, there will be a second "wave" of the epidemic upon reinfection. In Figure 4 (left), we
plot the probability that second wave occurs at all, versus the quarantine threshold. We define a
second wave occurring as the event that at least 5% of remaining nodes after a quarantine become
Infected. Notice that there is a sharp threshold for which a second wave becomes impossible as
the quarantine proceeds, and after the optimal quarantine threshold, no second wave occurs at all,
which means this quarantine threshold guarantees herd immunity. In Figure 4 (right), we plot the
width of the second wave relative to the width of the no-quarantine setting. Width is calculated as
the full-width at half-maximum. We observe that the second wave becomes wider as we increase

Fig. 4. We plot the probability of a second wave occurring for the BA network and GEMSEC Facebook Artist
network (left). Observe that there is a sharp dropoff as the quarantine threshold approaches the optimal. On
the right, we plot the FWHM width of the second peak relative to the width of the infection curve in the

the quarantine threshold, indicating that it takes longer for the infection to propagate through the
population, even if the quarantine is enacted suboptimally.
Weaker and Stronger infections. Until now, we have rather arbitrarily selected the ratio of infection
𝛽
to recovery parameters, 𝛾 to be 0.5, such that the entire population becomes Infected if no quarantine
is enacted. To clarify that the empirical phenomena we have discussed are not particular to this
setting of infection, and to describe the effect of a stronger and weaker infection, we have run
all of our simulations under the same setting where the infection parameter is varied between
1 1 1 1 1
{ 32
, 16 , 8 , 4 , 2 , 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32}. In Figure 5 we plot the total number of Infected nodes for these
varying ratios. We note that for exceptionally weak epidemics, the data is very noisy and essentially
flat, indicating that epidemics are very unlikely to propagate at all. Next we observe that as an
𝛽
infection becomes stronger, in the sense that 𝛾 is larger, the optimal quarantine threshold is higher
and the quarantine is less effective. Indeed, for comparatively stronger epidemics, the trough in each
V-shaped curve is shallower and further to the right. We posit that this is because the chance of the
infection propagating along any single edge is much greater for strong epidemics and thus everyone
becomes Infected even networks with extremely light-tailed degree distributions. Hence, even
when the high-degree nodes quickly become eradicated early during the course of the epidemic, the
remaining susceptible subnetwork will allow every node to become Infected, regardless of where
the quarantine is applied.
4.3.5 Clustering and Nodes. Our theoretical results have been established in the configuration
model, when networks are infinite and the clustering coefficient is vanishing. By varying the size
of the network and the clustering coefficient, we prove those assumption have negligible impact on
the final fraction of Removed nodes. See Appendix for exact plots.

Fig. 5. We ablate across the infection paramaters 𝛽/𝛾 for the BA network (left) and GEMSEC Facebook Artist
network (right) by plotting the total proportion of population Infected versus quarantine threshold. The
qualitative properties do not change as the infection parameters are varied, though weaker infections have
an optimal quarantine threshold that is earlier than a stronger infection.

Fig. 6. Effect of two quarantines on the GEMSEC Facebook Artist network. The left plot displays maximum
number of Infected nodes, and the right plot displays the total number of Infected nodes. The vertical axis
corresponds to the proportion of the population who has been Infected at the time of first quarantine.
The horizontal axis corresponds to second quarantine threshold, in terms of the proportion of the (total)
population who has been Infected since the first quarantine. Observe that there is an optimal strategy in the
two-quarantine setting that does better than the single-quarantine setting for the maximum Infected nodes,
whereas it in general impossible to do better than the single quarantine setting for minimizing total number
of Infected nodes.

Fig. 7. In the left plot, we map plot the number of Infected nodes versus time when multiple quarantines are
allowed. The quarantine strategy is chosen to keep peak heights roughly equal. Notice that the final peaks
get wider and there is diminishing returns in peak reduction as quarantines are increased. On the right, we
plot the total number of Infected nodes when a hard infection threshold is enacted. Notice that the final
number of nodes Infected is greatly dependent upon the number of nodes Infected by the final wave, and the
optimal situation is to have an impotent final wave.

4.4

Multiple Quarantines

4.4.1 Two Quarantines. We examine the effects of performing two quarantines. We plot these
results for the GEMSEC Facebook Artist graphs in Figure 6 (see Appendix for similar result on
Barabasi-Albert graphs). A two-quarantine simulation is run in a similar fashion to a singlequarantine simulation, where the second quarantine threshold refers to the proportion of the
original network that becomes Infected between the first and second quarantine. The heatmaps
in Figure 6 display the first quarantine threshold on the vertical axis and the second quarantine
threshold on the horizontal axis, thereby recovering the V-plots of Figure 2 in either the left column
or the top row of the heatmaps. From there, we can conclude that having two quarantines can
reduce the maximum number of Infected nodes, but not the Total number of Infected nodes. On one
hand, this is disappointing, as we cannot reduce the final number of Removed nodes 𝑅(𝑢) by using
more quarantines. On the other hand, this means that if we need to declare a quarantine earlier
than at the optimal time, say because of a constraint on the maximum number of simultaneously
Infected nodes (e.g. hospital beds), we can recover all the benefits of a single well-timed quarantine
with two well-timed quarantines. We now extend this observation to more than two quarantines.
4.4.2 More than two quarantines. Finally we turn our attention to the case when more than two
quarantines are applied. In Figure 7 (left) we plot the proportion of Infected nodes versus time for
the BA10 graph under various scenarios with multiple quarantines. The quarantine thresholds are
chosen to roughly equalize the peak heights. Naturally we notice that the peak heights decay as we
increase the number of quarantines we’re allowed, however the improvement in peak height has
diminishing returns. We also notice that the latter peaks are wider than the initial peaks, echoing
our observation in the single-quarantine setting.
In Figure 7 (right), instead of declaring a quarantine based on the fraction of nodes not in the
Susceptible state, we declare it when the number of nodes in the Infected state reaches a certain
threshold, and then restart a new infection after each quarantine. We then plot the final number
of Removed nodes after these multiple quarantines. Notice that this strategy does not need any
knowledge of the graph (not even the degree sequence). A multiple value of the threshold allow us
to recover the result of a well-timed single quarantine. However, if the threshold is poorly chosen,

the final number of Removed nodes can be multiple times greater than the optimal achievable. The
higher the threshold, the worse this strategy can behave. Nevertheless, if quarantines are declared
early (when a small fraction of the population is Infected), we are always within a factor 2 of the
optimal number of nodes in the Removed state. Multiple quarantines can therefore be used as a
targeted immunization strategy even without any knowledge of the contact graph, as long as they
are declared early.

APPENDIX

A.1 𝑑-regular graphs cannot be immunized through quarantines
Proposition 5. For random 𝑑-regular graphs in the configuration model, i.e. with 𝑝𝑑 = 1 and for
𝑘 ≠ 𝑑, 𝑝𝑘 = 0, it is possible to achieve herd immunity after one quarantine for 𝑑 > 2.

Proof. For random 𝑑-regular graphs in the configuration model, we have:
𝑔0 (𝑥) = 𝑥 𝑑 .
Using Claim 5, we need to declare a quarantine when the fraction of nodes of degree 1 𝑢 is such
that:
0 ≥ 𝑢 2𝑔0′′ (𝑢) − 𝑢𝑔0′ (𝑢)
= 𝑢 2𝑑 (𝑑 − 1)𝑢𝑑−2 − 𝑢𝑑𝑢𝑑−2
= 𝑢𝑑 𝑑 (𝑑 − 2).
This inequality cannot be satisfied for 𝑘 > 2, so quarantining is not a valid immunization strategy.

BA graphs

We first compare groupwise survival rates for BA graphs and a social network, then the proportion
of simultaneously Infected nodes versus time. The behavior is similar for both networks.

Fig. 8. Groupwise survival rates for a BA graph (left) and a social network (right). Observe that the higher
degree nodes become Infected much more quickly than the population average.

Fig. 9. Proportion of simultaneously Infected population versus time for a BA network with parameter 𝑚 = 10
(left) and the GEMSEC Facebook Artist network (right). The Blue curves indicate the no quarantine setting;
the green curves minimize the peak height, whereas the red curves minimize the total number of Infected
nodes.

The behavior of a double quarantine is also very similar to the behavior on the GEMSEC Facebook
Artist network.

A.3

Relaxing theoretical assumptions

Even though our theoretical results have been established in for infinite graphs with vanishing
clustering coefficient, our empirical results hold for finite networks, and we demonstrate empirically
that modifying the clustering coefficient doesn’t have a noticeable effect on quarantine efficacy. In
Figure 11 (left), we plot the total number of Infected nodes versus quarantine thresholds for a series
of PLC networks, where we alter only the parameter 𝑝 which controls the clustering coefficient. In

Hoffmann and Jordan, et al.

Figure 11 (right), we consider a series of BA networks with the same parameter 𝑚, but differing
sizes. In both cases we notice that the differences across either series are negligible, indicating
that the qualitative results we’ve empirically demonstrated do not depend upon the clustering
coefficient or size of the network.
