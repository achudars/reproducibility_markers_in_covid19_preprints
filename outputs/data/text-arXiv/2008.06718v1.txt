Abstract
In this paper we analyze the effects of commuting and social inequalities for
the epidemic development of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). With this
aim we consider a SEIRD (susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered and dead
by disease) model without vital dynamics in a population divided into patches
that have different economic resources and in which the individuals can commute
from one patch to another (bilaterally). In the modeling we choose the social
and commuting parameters arbitrarily. We calculate the basic reproductive
number R0 with the next generation approach and analyze the sensitivity of
R0 with respect to the parameters. Furthermore, we run numerical simulations
considering a population divided into two patches to bring some conclusions on
the number of total infected individuals and cumulative deaths for our model
considering heterogeneous populations.
Keywords: COVID-19, Commuting, SEIRD model, Heterogeneous

1. Introduction
In the beginning of December 2019 a new type of coronavirus disease was
identified in the city of Wuhan, the largest city of the Hubei province in China.
Currently known (officially) by the name COVID-19, this novel coronavirus was

only reported to the world by the end of the same month [1]. According to
the World Health Organization, with the data published by February 21st, just
three months since the first case, over 75 thousand cases were reported just
in China, with a fatality ratio around 3%. Also, at that same time other 26
countries have confirmed infected cases [2].
Since then, the spread of the COVID-19 became one of the most problematic
public health case of epidemic diseases around the world, causing relevant socioeconomic impacts: primarily by the relatively high death rate causing deaths
by the health complications or even by the saturation of health care systems,
and secondarily since this is a new type of coronavirus, so the majority of the
individuals are susceptible to the disease. Hence, until the the development of
the vaccine, it will stagnate the entire system of social interaction leading to the
increase in unemployment rates, weakening the health of the population and
many other complications.
At the present time, early August of 2020, the World Health Organization
[3] reported over 18.6 million confirmed cases of infected including over 700
thousand deaths. The Americas concentrate over 50% of all infected cases with
over 380 thousand deaths, Europe concentrates the highest mortality rate with
approximately 18, 5% of all infected cases with over 216 thousand deaths representing over 30% of all death cases. In total, COVID-19 is affecting 213 countries
and territories around the world and 2 international conveyances [4].
Many efforts have been made by the scientific community around the world
in an attempt to propose models that allow mapping the spread and predictions
about numerical issues involving this current pandemic. Although these models
do not portray reality with absolute precision, they have helped us guide control
measures (such as quarantines and educational campaigns of social distance, use
of masks, cleaning and hygiene tips, and many others) to minimize the effects
of the pandemic with relative success.
In [5], the author proposes a SEIR model with a partial differential reactiondiffusion system to explain the spread of COVID-19 in France and analyzed
the different situations without lockdown and with partial lockdown scenarios.
2

In [6], the authors developed a forecasting model of COVID-19 outbreak in
Canada using time series analysis with a machine learning approach. In [7],
an age-structured SEIR model was studied and the efficiency of age-oriented
control strategies were assessed. In [8], the authors present an optimal control
result for an age-structured SEIRQ model by using quarantine strategies as the
control force.
For results more connected this work, one can see [9], where the authors
investigated a model for spatial epidemics and analyzed the effects of human
mobility patterns to spatial spread of an infectious disease. Also, in [10] the
authors proposed a SEIRA model for the spread of COVID-19 in a heterogeneous population. Finally, as we can see in [11] and [12], studies have indicated
that pandemic scenarios affectsdifferently Afro-Americans and immigrants in
the United States due to unfavorable socioeconomic conditions. It is stated
that African Americans represent three-quarters of the total deaths in U.S.
In Brazil, as in many other Latin America countries, due to the great socioeconomic inequalities and the partial lockdowns adopted with relatively low
time of implementation (together with the large underreporting of cases) it is
expected that the dynamics between locations with greater and lesser financial
resources will also have great divergences in the epidemic scenarios since individuals with fewer resources in addition to not having large and efficient access
to heath facilities, may not be able to comply with isolation measures (such
as quarantines) and precautions (such as the use of masks). Inspired by the
above comments, in this paper we present a SEIRD model for COVID-19 with
a population divided into patches and we analyze the influence of two important
factors: social inequalities and commuting between patches.
This work is organized as follows: In Section 2 we present our SEIRD model,
explain the epidemic parameters and compute the basic reproductive number
R0 by the next generation approach. In Section 3 we fit the parameters to
real data from Brazil and analyze the sensitivity of R0 with respect to them.
In Section 4 we present numerical simulations considering the dynamics with a
population divided into two patches and analyze the effects of commuting and
3

social inequalities. Finally, we present the conclusion of this work in Section 5.

2. Model structure and basic reproductive number
As proposed by [9], we consider a population that is divided into n patches,
which could represent countries, regions, cities, or even parts of a city. People
from one patch can travel to other patches, and the model distinguishes individuals by their home locations. Residents of patch j that are presently in patch i
commute to patch k at a rate mjki . A diagram for the n = 2 case for a generic
population denoted by X is displayed in Figure 1.

Figure 1: Diagram for commuting in a population divided into 2 patches.

The population of residents of patch j which are presently in patch i is also
divided into four epidemiological classes. These are the susceptible, exposed,
infected and recovered individuals, denoted by Sij , Eij , Iij and Rij . We also
include Dij to represent deaths due to the disease. A diagram for the n = 2 case
describing the commuting dynamic in one of the patches and the progression in
classes is displayed in Figure 2.
Our SEIRD model is, then, composed of 5n2 equations, described in (1) for
1 ≤ i, j ≤ n.

All parameters are nonnegative. For C ∈ {S, E, I, R}, representing a generic
epidemiological class, mjki (C) is the commuting rate from patch i to patch k
for individuals of class C that are residents of patch j. It will be assumed that
mjii (C) = 0 for all i, j since there is no commuting in these cases. We denote a
generic parameter ρji for residents of patch j, presently in patch i. The remaining
5

parameters are described in Table 1. It is assumed that the total population
is constant because the analysis considers only a short time in comparison to
the demographic time scale. Hence, the equations in (1) do not include vital
parameters.

We now show how to calculate the basic reproductive number, R0 , for model
(1). This will be done by a next generation approach. Due to the high number
of dimensions, we only consider the case n = 2. Firstly, we need to find the
disease-free equilibrium, which is defined by Eij = Iij = Rij = 0 for all i, j. The

Notice that the total population in each patch is constant. At the equilibrium
S11 = S11∗ ,

S21 = S21∗ ,

S12 = S12∗ ,

S22 = S22∗ ,

we have
S11∗ + S21∗ = S11 (0) + S21 (0),

S12∗ + S22∗ = S12 (0) + S22 (0)

m212 (S)S22 = m221 (S)S12

(4)

and

m112 (S)S21 = m121 (S)S11 ,

Solving the system that arises from (3) and (4), one can see that the diseasefree equilibrium is

m1 21 (S) + m2 11 (S)

Due to the complexity of K and its eigenvalues, we do not give an explicit
formula for R0 , which would not have much analytical use with so many parameters. Instead, we perform a numerical sensitivity analysis in the next Section.

3. Data fitting and R0 sensitivity analysis
In this Section we consider model (1) with 2 patches, which represent two
regions of a given large city of Brazil. The parameters for these patches will
be chosen arbitrarily to model social inequalities. One patch will consist of
wealthier individuals, who are better able to self isolate and have greater access
to hospitals.
In order to allow us to choose the parameters better, we start by fitting the
number of infected people in Brazil for the first 20 days of the outbreak in a
SEIR model with only one patch. The data from [4] is shown in Table 3. The
model is

γ to the data in Table 3. Since the latency period is estimated to be 5.2 days
[15], we assume that σ = 1/5.2. The minimization algorithm is an adaptation of
one that is available in [14], starting with an initial guess of β = 1 and γ = 0.1
and initial conditions S(0) = 200.000.000, E(0) = 0, I(0) = 1 and R(0) = 0.
The results are
β ∗ = 0.9230,

γ ∗ = 0.0458.

(7)

The data from Table 3 and the infected curve with the parameters chosen
as above are shown in Figure 3.
We assume that patch 1 is the wealthier one. For C ∈ {S, E, R}, we assume
that
mkij (C) = mkij ,

i, j, k ∈ {1, 2},

(8)

i.e., the commuting rates do not depend on the epidemiological class for noninfected individuals. In their case, we suppose that the symptoms reduce their
mobility, so we take
mkij (I) =

mkij

spend much more time in their base locations, and that m121 << m212 , i.e.,
residents of patch 2 are more likely to go to patch 1 than the other way around.
In a specific case, this can be seen as follows: patch 1 concentrates more places of
entertainment and commerce compared to patch 2. For our numerical analysis
of R0 and the simulations in the next Section, we take
m121 = 1/9,

m112 = 1,

m212 = 1.5,

m221 = 3.

(10)

We also assume that the number of residents in each patch is 30000. From
(5), the disease-free equilibrium is, then,
S11∗ = 27000,

S21∗ = 3000,

S12∗ = 10000,

S22∗ = 20000.

(11)

For the epidemiological parameters, we suppose that β11 = β12 , β21 = β22 ,
k
σij
= σ ∗ for i, j, k ∈ {1, 2}, γ11 = γ21 and γ12 = γ22 . This means that the

transmission coefficients will be considered as a property of the patch in which
individuals currently are, whereas the recovery rates depend only on the patch
they live in.
Our choices, then, will be β11 = β12 = β ∗ , γ11 = γ21 = γ ∗ and β21 = β22 =
(1 + p)β ∗ , γ12 = γ22 = γ ∗ /(1 + p), where p > 0 is a parameter that reflects the
social inequalities between the two patches. We consider p = 0.5. A summary
of parameter values is available in Table 4.

ρ = 0.1, then a

1% increase in ρ increases R0 in 0.1%. After computing the partial derivatives
numerically, we find the results displayed in Table 5.

Notice that the effect of changes in the commuting rates on R0 is small in
comparison to other parameters. This shows that, even though travel restrictions are useful methods of controlling the spread of as epidemic across patches,
they are not as effective as measures that affect the transmission coefficient
(such as wearing masks and social distancing) and the recovery rate (such as
screening measures and the isolation of infected individuals) [18].
However, the rates corresponding to the mobility of residents of the poorer
11

patch induce percentage changes in R0 around five times those corresponding
to the wealthier patch. Moreover, we see that leaving your base patch decreases
R0 , whereas returning home increases it.
On the other hand, we see that a 10% reduction in p produces a 5.1%
reduction in R0 , so reducing social inequalities is paramount in regard to the
control of future epidemic outbreaks.

4. Numerical simulations
In this Section we use the parameters from Section 3 to gather information
about the disease spread in a population divided into two patches. We aim to
answer the following questions:
(i) How does the maximum of the infected curve depend on the parameter p?
(ii) How many deaths are due to traveling between patches?
(iii) How are these extra deaths distributed in the populations of the two
patches?
As initial conditions, we consider susceptible populations as the equilibrium
values from Table 4, zero exposed, recovered and deaths, and one infected individual, which is a resident of the wealthier patch. This happened in a few large
cities of Brazil such as São Paulo [19] and Recife [20], where the first cases were
infected after trips to Europe.
To analyze the first question, we plot, in Figure 4, the maximum of the total
infected curve
I11 (t) + I21 (t) + I12 (t) + I22 (t)
as a function of p ∈ [0, 1]. Notice that, as p increases, the maximum also
increases. However, if we do the same for
I11 (t) + I21 (t)
and
I12 (t) + I22 (t),
12

we see that the maximum is essentially constant with regard to p for residents
of the wealthier patch, so the increment in the overall maximum comes at the
expense of the poorer patch.
A bigger number of simultaneously infected individuals poses a serious problem, because it could lead to the saturation of the healthcare system [21]. Figure
4 suggests also that the more unequal societies are, the bigger the toll on hospitals and other facilities is on the poorer regions, whose residents already have
less access to it to begin with.

The second question is answered with Figure 5. On the left, it shows plots
of
D11 (t) + D21 (t) + D12 (t) + D22 (t)
for p = 0.5. The blue curve is the solution that arises from the parameters from
Table 4, whereas the red curve represents a situation with no commuting, i.e.,
m112 = m121 = m212 = m221 = 0.
This scenario represents a situation in which the borders of each patch are
closed, for example, in an attempt to stop the spread of the disease. As such,
there are people outside of their base places when the travels are stopped, which
explains why, in the following simulations, there are cases and deaths of patch
2 residents even though there were no infected residents from this patch in the
13

initial conditions.
The case fatality ratios considered in patch 1 were c11 = c12 = c0 = 0.05, that
is, 5% of infected residents from this patch die from the disease. In patch 2, we
assume that the case fatalities increase with p in such a way that, when p = 0,
we have c21 = c22 = c0 , and when p → ∞, we have c21 = c22 = 1. Hence, we take
c21 (p) = c22 (p) =

p + c0
.
p+1

(13)

The plot on the left of Figure 5 shows that commuting increased the total
number of deaths, given by the equilibrium values of the two curves, in around
2.5 times. In order to determine if this was a property of the specific value of
p that was chosen, the other two plots of Figure 5 exhibit the total number of
deaths as a function of p ∈ [0, 1], with and without commuting, and the ratio of
the numbers of deaths with commuting to without commuting. The resulting
curves indeed reveal that the travels amplify the total number of deaths as social
discrepancies rise.

for p = 0.5 and scenarios with and without commuting. In the middle, the number of deaths
is plotted as a function of p. On the left, the ratio of deaths with and without commuting as

This leads us to Figure 6 and the answer to our last question. The plots display the cumulative number of deaths of residents from each patch as functions
of time and p. Notice the discrepancy in how the travels increases the deaths

in both patches. Moreover, the deaths do not change as p varies in patch 1, so
the extra deaths we saw on Figure 5 come at the expense of patch 2.

(on the left) and of the final number of deaths as a function of p (on the right). Scenarios
with and without commuting are considered for residents of both patches.

In patch 1, whose residents are richer, the final number of deaths was multiplied by a factor of 1.11. On the other hand, this factor was 3 in patch 2 so, once
again, the disease has much worse consequences for poorer individuals. Finally,
we look at the percentages of deaths coming from each patch. For p = 0.5, the
results from Figures 5 and 6 are presented in Table 6.
Once again, the effects of travel among patches are felt in a much harsher
way in the poorer patch.

5. Conclusion
In this paper we developed a SEIRD model for the COVID-19 epidemic in
a population distributed in different patches. We assumed that individuals can
travel between patches and also that the patches have different socioeconomic
resources and studied the effects of commuting and social inequalities on this
dynamic. The residents of each patch were divided in four epidemiological
classes of a SEIR model without vital dynamics and we included a D class to
represent deaths from the disease.
We calculated the basic reproductive number using a next generation approach. To fit the parameters, we used data of the infected people of the first
20 days of the pandemic outbreak in Brazil in a SEIR model with a single patch
and a minimization routine based on the least squares method and then we
analyzed the sensitivity of the R0 with respect of these parameters.
This analysis pointed to many interesting facts. The mobility rates of residents in the poorer patch causes percentages variations in R0 around five times
higher when compared to the wealthier one. Also, the travels provoke different
variations on R0 : leaving your base patch reduces it whereas returning increases
it. Another result is that the mobility rates between patches cause only small
variations in R0 , thus indicating that avoiding commuting is not as effective a
strategy as measures that directly affect the infection or recovery rates. For
p, the parameter reflecting social inequality, the analysis is quite different. We
observed that reductions of 10% in p causes reductions around 5% in the basic
reproductive number, indicating that the reduction of socioeconomic inequali16

ties is an effective strategy in the control of epidemic outbreaks.
We did numerical simulations of the proposed model considering two patches
and supposing that one is wealthier then the other. These results (present in
Section 5) lead us to some important conclusions. The first one is that social
inequalities play an important role in the concentration of infected individuals.
To be more precise, the maximum of the infected curve increases as the parameter p increases. On the other hand, the total cases of the wealthier patch remain
almost constant with the variance of p, therefore the most affected patch is the
poorer one.
The second is that mobility between patches directly contributes to the increase of the cumulative number of deaths. It is important to observe that in
this situation there is a vast difference in the death rate when we compare commuting and no commuting scenarios in each patch: in the wealthier one we have
a difference around 11%, whereas the approximated difference is of 200% in the
poorer one.
The percentages of deaths coming from the poorer patch decreased in 15% in
a scenario with no mobility between patches, for p = 0.5. Therefore we conclude
that both human mobility and social inequalities represent important facts to
be considered in future models.
We expect that our model with the results presented in this paper help the
scientific community to a better understanding on how human mobility and
social inequalities affect the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic and similar
structures, which could lead the authorities to better public-health policies to
control or minimize the effects of epidemics. Finally, it is important to mention
that one can adapt our model to consider important others dynamical processes
in Epidemiology, Ecology or Biology.
