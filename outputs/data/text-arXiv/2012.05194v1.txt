Abstract. A simplified method to compute Rt , the Effective Reproduction Number, is presented. The
method relates the value of Rt to the estimation of the doubling time performed with a local exponential
fit. The condition Rt = 1 corresponds to a growth rate equal to zero or equivalently an infinite doubling
time. Different assumptions on the probability distribution of the generation time are considered. A simple
analytical solution is presented in case the generation time follows a gamma distribution.

1 Introduction
The Effective Reproduction Number Rt is one of the main parameters that controls the evolution of an infection. It
recently gained importance during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak and is used as one of the indicators to determine
restrictive measures such as regional or national lock-downs.
Different algorithms for its computation are available [1] [2] [3] [4] [5], some of which are very CPU intensive.
Implementations are also available as software packages [6] for a number of algorithms, and results are presented
on websites [7] [8] [9] with regular updates.
CPU-effective algorithms offer the advantage that estimates can be derived in real time as soon as new data are
published. Often, results of simplified algorithms don’t differ too much from the results of more accurate methods, in
particular due to the limited quality of input data.
The following proposes a simplified approach to the estimate of Rt based on a determination of the doubling time,
or equivalently the growth rate, which can be simply achieved with a regression procedure.

2 The Effective Reproduction Number, Rt
We assume It is the number of infected persons at the time t, measured as number of days from a conventional
beginning of the epidemic, defined as t = 0.
Each contagious person can infect other people during his infection period. We assume that a person that got
infected at a day d will infect, on average, a certain number of other persons that become infectious at the day t > d
with a discrete probability distribution ws , with s = t − d. The newly infected people, on turn, may infect more people
with the same mechanism. s = t − d is defined as the generation time in literature and corresponds to the time interval
between infector-infected pair.
The probability distribution ws is normalized to unity:

In practice, after a sufficiently large amount of time, i.e.: for a sufficiently large value of s, ws becomes negligible. An
estimate of ws from Italian infection data, unfortunately from a limited number of cases, is published in [10] where
ws is approximated with a gamma distribution.
At a time t, the expected number of infected persons, E[It ] can be determined from Id , d = 0, · · · , t − 1, according
to [3], as:
t−1
X
E[It ] = Rt
Id wt−d ,
(2)
d=0

or, equivalently, defining s = t − d, as:
E[It ] = Rt

t
X

It−s ws .

(3)

s=1

The simplest assumption on ws is a constant generation time g, which is equivalent ws = δgs where δgs is a
Kronecker delta, i.e.: wg = 1 and ws = 0 for s 6= g. In this case, Eq 3 becomes:
E[It ] = Rt It−g .

(4)

For COVID-19, the average generation time, defined as the mean value of a gamma distribution fitted to the Italian
data, is g = 6.7 ± 1.9 days [10]. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) takes instead for Germany the value g = 4 that
gives a very simple estimate R̂t of Rt [4] 1 :
It
R̂t =
,
(5)
It−g
or the smoother ratio of the moving averages over g days:
Pt
R̂t = Pt

d=t−g+1 Id

d=t−g+1 Id−g

.

(6)

Usually, the moving average over few days does not sufficiently smooth the distribution of the number of daily
infected cases It . In particular, the lower number of swab tests taken during the weekend causes a “ripple” structure
that requires a further smoothing to be applied to the input data before evaluating Eq. 6.
Figure 1 shows the number of daily confirmed cases, It for Italy according to public COVID-19 Italian data from
the Italian Dipartimento di Protezione Civile. The large dispersion of data is clearly visible, in particular around the
more stable moving average over 7 days, also shown in the figure.

3 Relation between Rt and doubling time
Another indicator of the growth of the epidemic is the doubling time τ2 defined as the time required to double the
number of infected persons, assuming an exponential growth.
Given n consecutive counts of infected people, It−n+1 , · · · , It , the following function model can interpolate the n
counts:
It = A eλt ,
(7)
or, equivalently:
It = A 2t/τ2 .

(8)

The growth rate λ is related to the doubling time τ2 by:
τ2 =

log 2
.
λ

(9)

Estimates of A and λ, or equivalently τ2 , can be determined with a numerical fit procedure. In particular, the
exponential fit can be conveniently implemented as a linear regression on log It .
Assuming Rt = R constant during the considered time interval, the evolution model in Eq. 4 represents an
exponential growth. In a time period formed by a number of days n which is an integer multiple of g: n = N g, we
have:
E[It ] = R N Ih ,
(10)
1

We tested this algorithm over the Rt values computed by RKI for the German cases as reported in [11], and we found an
excellent agreement with the data published by the RKI.

(13)

hence the estimate R̂ of R is:
R̂ = egλ̂ = e(g log 2)/τ̂2 ,

(14)

where λ̂ and τ̂2 are the estimates of λ and τ2 , respectively.

4 Simplified algorithm
We studied the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, considering the data published on daily basis by
Italian Dipartimento di Protezione Civile [13]. For each day t, we perform an exponential fit to the n last days’ counts,
It−n+1 , · · · , It . We determine an estimate τ̂2 of the doubling time τ2 , or an equivalent estimate λ̂ of the growth rate
λ, from a fit of the model in Eq. 7 or Eq. 8. Then, assuming a reasonable estimate g of the average generation time,
we estimate Rt according to Eq. 14 as:
R̂t = egλ̂ = e(g log 2)/τ̂2 = 2g/τ̂2 .
There are some advantages of Eq. 15 compared to the simplified model from Eq. 6:

(15)

#### Page 4 of 10

Eur. Phys. J. Plus #####################

– Eq. 15 can also be applied in case g, the average generation time, is not an integer, while Eq. 6 must approximate
g to the nearest integer.
– The exponential fit better follows an exponential growth in the considered time interval, as it is the case when Rt
is a constant, with respect to a moving average.
At the cost of a modest increase in the computing time, yet maintaining very good speed, we consider the method
proposed here to be more flexible and reliable compared to the method adopted in [4]. Moreover, the data smoothing
can be tuned by including a sufficient number of points in the fit. In this way, no preliminary smoothing of the data
is needed before the application of the algorithm.
In the following sections, we will introduce extensions of Eq. 15 that allow a more precise determination of R̂t than
with the simplified assumption that ws = δgs , i.e.: s is constant and equal to g.

5 Uncertainty estimate
Given Eq. 15, the uncertainty on R̂t is determined by the uncertainties on λ̂ (or τ2 ) and the uncertainty on g. Namely,
if σλ̂ and σg are the uncertainties on λ̂ and g, respectively, within a Gaussian error approximation, the variance of Rt
is given by:
!2
!2
∂ R̂t
∂ R̂t
Var[R̂t ] =
+
σλ̂
σg
= (geλ̂g σλ̂ )2 + (λ̂eλ̂g σg ) = (eλ̂g )2 (g 2 σλ̂2 + λ̂2 σg2 ) .
(16)
∂g
∂ λ̂
The error on R̂t is:
σR̂t =

q
q
Var[R̂t ] = R̂t g 2 σλ̂2 + λ̂2 σg2 .

(17)

The uncertainty on λ̂ derives from the exponential fit procedure, while the uncertainty on g depends on how well
the probability distribution of the generation time ws is known. From [10], the estimate of ws and its average g for
COVID-19 in Italy is known from a limited number of cases.
In particular, when λ̂ = 0 (infinite doubling time), which corresponds to R̂t = 1, σg doesn’t contribute to the R̂t
uncertainty. This means that an imperfect assumption on g does not affect the condition R̂t = 1 which is important
to determine the turning point of infection, from growing to receding, or vice versa.
The uncertainty computed in Eq. 17 does not take into account the systematic uncertainty due to the assumed approximation that the generation time s is constant, and equal to g. Moreover, the assumption of Gaussian uncertainties
may not hold for an asymmetric distribution.

6 Effect of finite width in the ws distribution
The deviation of ws from the hypothesis of a constant generation time s = g may be approximately estimated in the
continuum approximation. Eq. 3 for a continuous time variable t may be rewritten as:
Z t
i(t) = ρ(t)
i(t − s) w(s) ds ,
(18)
0

where ρ(t) and i(t) are the continuum equivalent of R and It , respectively.
The normalization condition is:
Z ∞
w(s) ds = 1 .

(19)

0

If s is a constant equal to g, we have w(s) = δ(s − g), where δ is a Dirac’s delta function. Hence:
i(t) = ρ(t) i(t − g) .

(20)

Assuming an exponential growth i(t) = A eλt , one has:
A eλt = ρ(t) A eλ(t−g) = ρ(t) A eλt e−λg ,

(21)

which gives the continuous version of Eq. 15, where ρ(t) = ρ is a constant:
ρ = eλg .

(22)

Eur. Phys. J. Plus #####################

#### Page 5 of 10

Assuming, instead, that w(s) deviates from the Dirac’s delta assumption and has average value g and standard
deviation σ, we may write Eq. 18 applying a series expansion of i(t − s) around s = g:

Z t
1
i(t) = ρ(t)
i(t − g) w(s) − i0 (t − g) (s − g) w(s) + i00 (t − g) (s − g)2 w(s) + · · · ds .
(23)
2
0
We assume that w(s) ' 0 for s > t, so that the integration can be extended from 0 to ∞ instead of 0 to t.
After the integration, in the first term the normalization condition of w(d) can be applied. The second term
vanishes, and in the third term the definition of standard deviation σ of w(s) can be applied. Eq. 23 becomes:


σ 2 00
i(t) ' ρ(t) i(t − g) +
i (t − g) .
(24)
2
If we assume again i(t) = A eλt , hence i00 (t) = A λ2 eλt , Eq. 24, becomes:


σ 2 2 λt −λg
λt
λt −λg
A e = ρ(t) A e e
+A λ e e

The term A eλt simplifies. If λ2 σ 2  1, we may write, approximately:


λ ' ρ e−λg eλ σ /2 ,
2
hence:
ρ = eλg−λ

σ 2 /2

.

(25)

(26)

(27)

Equation 27 has already been reported in [12]. This result implies the width of the distribution ws has the effect
to replace g in Eq. 22 with an “effective” generation time g eff that is somewhat smaller than the true average value
and depends on λ according to:
σ2
(28)
g eff = g − λ .
2
In order to take into account more details of the distribution, more terms may be added to Eq. 23. Those would add
a dependency of ρ on the higher moments: skewness, kurtosis and possibly more, if required by the desired accuracy.
Those cases are not considered in the present work.

7 “Exact” solution
If we assume, as in the previous section, that i(t) is an exponential function, or at least that it can be approximated to
an exponential function within a time interval that is at least as wide as the time range in which w(s) is not negligible,
ρ(t) can be computed “exactly”, and is constant within that interval.
If we assume i(t) = A eλt , Eq. 18 becomes:
Z t

This result is also reported in [12].

The normalization of w(s) implies ρ = 1, regardless of the details of the probability distribution w(s).

8 The case of a gamma distribution
In [10], w(s) is approximated to a gamma distribution:
w(s) =

sκ−1 e−s/θ
,
θκ Γ (κ)

(33)

where κ and θ, the shape and scale parameters, are determined with a fit to the Italian data. Equation 31 becomes:
ρ = θκ Γ (κ)

where the integration can be performed analytically:

ρ = θκ Γ (κ) −
(λ + 1/θ)κ

s=∞ −1

.

(35)

s=0

With some simplification of the Γ functions, the result is:
ρ = (1 + λθ)κ .

(36)

The above equation is valid for −1/θ < λ < ∞. Again, λ = 0 corresponds to ρ = 1 for any values of κ and θ, as
demonstrated in general in the previous section.

9 Rt and τ2 as indicators of the epidemic evolution
Rt is often used as indicator of the epidemic evolution. As we have seen, there is a very close relation between the
Effective Reproduction Number and doubling time. The estimate of the doubling time τ2 can be determine directly
from the number of infected people, while Rt also requires an estimate of the average generation time g, which
propagates an extra uncertainty with respect to the estimate of τ2 .
The main feature of Rt is the passage through the threshold value of one: Rt > 1 indicates a growing phase, while
Rt < 1 indicates a receding phase of the epidemic. Those conditions are equivalent to τ2 > 0 and τ2 < 0, respectively,
as evident form Eq. 15. In the case λ̂ = 0, R̂t is not affected by the uncertainty on the estimate of g.
For this reason, we consider τ2 , or equivalently λ, a better indicator of the situation of the epidemic compared to
Rt , which may be of interest for other epidemiology purposes.

10 Results
Figure 2 shows Rt , evaluated with the presented algorithm assuming a constant generation time, using the public
Italian COVID-19 data released by the Italian Dipartimento di Protezione Civile [13]. Different values of the average
generation time g have been assumed, from 3 to 7 days.
The magnitude of the dependence of Rt on g gives also a clue about the uncertainty on Rt due to imperfect
knowledge of g, which mainly affects the regions where Rt is significantly different from 1.
Figure 3 shows instead the evaluation performed with the three models discussed above:
1. Eq. 15, assuming a constant generation time of g = 6.7 days;
2. Eq. 28, assuming a mean value of 6.7 days and a standard deviation of 4.88 days;
3. Eq. 36, assuming a gamma distribution having parameters κ = 1.87 and θ = 3.57 days, respectively, as determined
in [10]
Note that the mean of the gamma distribution is equal to the product κθ.
All three methods give similar values for Rt close to 1, but exhibit some discrepancy at more extreme values.
Compared to the “exact” solution that assumes a gamma distribution (Eq. 36), assuming a fixed generation time
(Eq. 15) gives a result that is about 9% larger at the highest value and about 4% larger at the lowest value. Including
the contribution of the standard deviation term (Eq. 28) gives a reduction of about 12% at the larges value and 3%
at the lowest value. Using (Eq. 15) with a lower “effective” g may improve the agreement with the “exact” solution
at higher values at the cost of a poorer agreement at lower values. This is effectively done in the implementation of
the RKI algorithm.

Fig. 2. Rt evaluated on the public COVID-19 Italian data released by the Italian Dipartimento di Protezione Civile with the
presented algorithm assuming different constant values of the generation time g from 3 to 7 days.

Figure 4 shows the application of different algorithms to the official Italian COVID-19 data published by the Italian
Dipartimento di Protezione Civile [13]. The algorithm presented in this paper is noted as CovidStat and assumes a
gamma distribution with the parameters reported above. It is compared with algorithms by Wallinga and Teunis [1],
Bettencourt and Ribeiro [2], Cori et al. [3], and RKI [4]. Algorithms by Wallinga and Teunis and Cori et al. use
the details of the probability distribution ws and are here implemented assuming the same ws as our algorithm.
Bettencourt and Ribeiro uses a fixed time, that we have set to 7 days.
The method proposed here has been implemented with an exponential fit to the last 14 days. The RKI algorithm has
been applied with generation time g = 5, since the original implementation with g = 4 showed significant discrepancy
with respect to the other algorithms, consistently with what can be noted in Fig 3. A smoothing of the infection data
with a Savitzky-Golay filter [14] using a time window of 15 days and a third-order polynomial was also applied to the
infection data before applying the RKI algorithm.
The comparison of the proposed method with other algorithms shows a good agreement, considering the possible
source of uncertainties and the intrinsic “ripple” structure of the data that may depend on the applied smoothing.
In particular, agreement of our method is very good with the Wallinga-Teunis and with the Cori et al. algorithms.
The agreement with the Bettencourt-Ribeiro is also good, considering that it includes a “ripple” structure due to the
data fluctuations. The agreement with the RKI method is also reasonable after the assumed constant generation time
is “tuned”, with a residual disagreement for the cases where Rt < 1. This feature is consistent with what can been
observed comparing the “exact” solution computed for the gamma distribution to the one computed assuming a fixed
generation time “tuned” to the more convenient value g = 5.5, as shown in Fig 5.
Figure 6 shows the estimated growth rate λ and the corresponding Rt for Italy data. Estimates are done with an
exponential fit over the last 14 days. For Rt the contribution to uncertainty due to the propagation of the statistical
uncertainty on λ is, in most of the range, much smaller than the total uncertainty that also takes in to account the
uncertainty on the parameters that model w(s), according to the estimate from [10]. This contribution to the total
uncertainty is particularly large as the values of Rt depart from one. For Rt = 1, as noted before, the uncertainty

contribution form the parameters that model w(s) is null. The magnitude of the total uncertainty is comparable with
what is obtained from the algorithm by Cori et al. that tales into account the uncertainty on w(s).

11 Conclusion
A simplified method to determine an estimate of Rt based on a local exponential fit is presented. The method can
be applied assuming a fixed generation time, including the contribution of the standard deviation of the generation
time distribution, or assuming a functional form for the probability distribution of the generation time. If a gamma
distribution is assumed, a simple analytic solution is reported. The method offers some advantages compared to the
simplified method adopted by the Robert Koch Institut, yet preserving good computing performances that makes it
suitable for a real-time evaluation.
Results of the method applied to the public Italian COVID-19 data have been presented. The proposed method
shows a good agreement with other, more complex, algorithms available in literature and implemented in public
software packages.
We note a close relation between Rt and the doubling time of the number of infections τ2 , or equivalently the
growth rate λ. In particular, the condition Rt > 1 is equivalent to τ2 > 0 or λ > 0. Since the determination of Rt
is affected by additional uncertainty sources compared to τ2 , we consider τ2 or λ to be a more sound and simpler
indicator of the condition of growing or receding epidemic compared to Rt , while Rt may have more importance in
other contexts of epidemiological interest.
We publish in real time daily estimates of Rt as computed by our algorithm and by all the other algorithms quoted
in this article for the cases in Italy and all the Italian regions under [9]. Daily values for the major world countries are
also reported.

Fig. 6. Growth rate λ (top) and Rt (bottom). For the growth rate λ, the statistical uncertainty band at 90% Confidence Level
is shown. For Rt the contribution to uncertainty due to the propagation of the statistical uncertainty on λ at 90% Confidence
Level is shown together with the total uncertainty at the 68% and 90% Confidence Level, that also takes in to account the
uncertainty on the parameters that model w(s). All data refer to Italy according to public COVID-19 Italian data from the
Dipartimento di Protezione Civile.
