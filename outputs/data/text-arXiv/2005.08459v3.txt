Abstract
A key challenge in estimating the infection fatality rate (IFR) is determining the
total number of cases. The total number of cases is not known because not everyone
is tested but also, more importantly, because tested individuals are not representative
of the population at large. We refer to the phenomenon whereby infected individuals
are more likely to be tested than non-infected individuals, as “preferential testing.”
An open question is whether or not it is possible to reliably estimate the IFR without
any specific knowledge about the degree to which the data are biased by preferential
testing. In this paper we take a partial identifiability approach, formulating clearly
where deliberate prior assumptions can be made and presenting a Bayesian model,
which pools information from different samples. When the model is fit to European
data obtained from seroprevalence studies and national official COVID-19 statistics,
we estimate the overall COVID-19 IFR for Europe to be 0.47%, 95% C.I. = [0.34%,
0.63%].

Keywords: selection bias, partial identification, evidence synthesis.

Introduction

If someone is infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),
the pathogen that causes COVID-19, how likely is that person to die of COVID-19? This
simple question is surprisingly difficult to answer.
The “case fatality rate” (CFR) is a common measure that quantifies the mortality
risk in a certain population, and is given by the ratio of deaths (D) over confirmed cases
(CC) during a specific time period. However, because many COVID-19 cases are never
diagnosed, the CFR almost certainly overestimates the true lethality of the virus. Instead,
the better answer is captured by the infection fatality rate (IFR) (Kobayashi et al., 2020;
Wong et al., 2013). The IFR, also a simple ratio, differentiates itself from the CFR by
considering all cases, including the asymptomatic, undetected and misdiagnosed infections,
in the denominator. For instance, if 20 individuals die of the disease in a population with
1,000 infections, then the IFR is 20 / 1000 = 0.02 = 2%.
Evidently, a key challenge in calculating the IFR is determining the true total number
of cases. The total number of cases (C) is not known because not everyone is tested
in the population (P ). A naı̈ve estimate of the IFR might take this into account by
simply considering the number of tests (T ) and estimating the number of cases as: C ≈
(CC/T ) × P . However, diagnostic tests are often selectively initiated, such that tested
individuals are not representative of the population at large.
In most countries/jurisdictions, those with classic COVID-19 symptoms (e.g. fever,
dry cough, loss of smell or taste) are much more likely to be tested than those without
symptoms. Due to this severity bias, the reported number of cases likely includes mostly
people whose symptoms were severe enough to be tested and excludes the vast majority of
those who are mildly- or asymptomatic. Even when testing is made equally available to all
3

individuals (e.g., Bendavid et al. (2020)), there is potential for “selection bias” if people
who have reason to believe they are infected are more likely to volunteer to be tested. We
refer to the phenomenon whereby infected individuals are more likely to be tested than
non-infected individuals, as “preferential testing.” (Hauser et al. (2020) and others use the
term “preferential ascertainment.”)
If the degree of preferential testing in a particular sample is of known magnitude, bias
adjustment can be achieved by appropriately altering the estimated rate of infection and
its uncertainty interval. However, the degree of preferential testing is typically unknown
and likely highly variable across different jurisdictions. An open question is whether or
not it is possible to reliably estimate the IFR without any specific information about the
degree to which the data are biased by preferential testing. And, if we have some samples
for which testing is representative and others which are subject to some unknown bias
from preferential testing, is it better to use only the representative data or to combine both
kinds of data in a joint analysis? In this paper, we address these important questions by
considering a Bayesian hierarchical model for estimation of the IFR. We demonstrate with
an application in which we fit the model to European data from seroprevalence studies and
national official COVID-19 statistics.
Bayesian models have been previously used in similar situations. For example, Presanis
et al. (2009) conduct Bayesian inference to estimate the severity of pandemic H1N1 influenza. More recently, Rinaldi and Paradisi (2020), and Hauser et al. (2020) use Bayesian
models for disease dynamics in order to estimate the severity of COVID-19. To address the
issue of preferential testing bias, Hauser et al. (2020) apply susceptible-exposed-infectedremoved (SEIR) compartmental models to age-stratified data and, in order to establish
parameter identifiability, assume that all cases of infected patients aged 80 years and older

4

are confirmed cases. The Bayesian model we propose is more general and allows one to
obtain appropriate point and interval estimates for the IFR with varying degrees of prior
knowledge about the magnitude of preferential testing and the distribution of other explanatory factors (e.g. age, healthcare capacity).
This paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we introduce required notation,
discuss distributional assumptions and review key issues of identifiability. In Section 3,
we formulate our Bayesian model and present a small illustrative example. In Section
4, we describe how the model can be scaled for larger populations and can incorporate
covariates. In Section 5, we present a simulation study and in Section 6, we present an
analysis of COVID-19 data from Europe. We conclude in Section 7.

Notation, distributions, and issues of (un)identifiability

2.1

Notation and distributions

Suppose we have data from K independent groups (i.e., countries or jurisdictions) from a
certain fixed period of time. For group k in 1, . . . , K, let:
• Pk be the population size (i.e., the total number of individuals at risk of infection);
• Tk be the total number of people tested;
• CCk be the total number of confirmed cases resulting from the tests; and
• Dk be the total number of observed deaths attributed to infection.
We do not observe the following latent variables. For the k-th group, let:

5

• Ck be the total number of infected people (cases) in the population;
• IRk be the true infection rate (proportion of the population which is infected), which
is the expected value of Ck /Pk ;
• IF Rk be the true underlying infection fatality rate (IFR), which is the expected value
of Dk /Ck .
Therefore, we assume that:
Ck ∼ Binom(Pk , IRk ),
Dk |Ck ∼ Binom(Ck , IF Rk ),

and:

(1)
(2)

where, in the k-th group, the unknown number of infections, Ck , and the known number
of deaths, Dk , each follow a binomial distribution. Note that there are latent variables on
both the left hand side and the right hand side of (1).
For each group, CCk is recorded, instead of Ck . Even in the absence of preferential
testing, CCk will be smaller than Ck because not everyone is tested. In other words, the
confirmed cases (CC) are a subset of the total cases (C). We assume that the distribution
of the confirmed cases depends only on the actual infection rate (C/P ) and the testing
rate (T /P ) but not on the infection fatality rate (D/C) or other information. In other
words, we assume that the conditional distribution of (CC|C, T, P, D) is identical to the
conditional distribution of (CC|C, T, P ).
This assumption is similar to the assumption of “non-differential” exposure misclassification in measurement error models and may or may not be realistic; see De Smedt et al.
(2018). For example, COVID-19 is thought to be deadlier amongst the elderly. If this is
6

true, the non-differential preferentiality assumption would fail if elderly individuals were
just as likely to be infected as others, yet more likely to be tested (given covariates).
The goal is to draw inference on the relationship between the number of deaths, D, and
the number of cases, C, having only data on D, CC, P , and T . This is particularly challenging since the number of confirmed cases in each group may be subject to an unknown
degree of preferential testing.
In the absence of any preferential testing, if one assumes that the population sizes
are finite, then the number of confirmed cases will follow a hyper-geometric distribution
(Prochaska and Theodore, 2018). The hyper-geometric distribution describes the probability of CCk confirmed cases amongst Tk tests (without any individuals being tested more
than once), from a finite population of size Pk that contains exactly Ck cases. Wallenius’ non-central hyper-geometric is a generalization of the hyper-geometric distribution
whereby testing is potentially biased with either cases or non-cases more likely to be tested
(Fog, 2008). We therefore consider the distribution of CCk |Ck as following a non-central
hyper-geometric distribution:
CCk |Ck ∼ N CHyperGeo(Ck , Pk − Ck , Tk , φk ),

(3)

where the degree of preferential testing corresponds to the φk non-centrality parameter.
When φk > 1, cases (i.e., infected individuals) are more likely to be tested than non-cases
(i.e., non-infected individuals); when φk < 1, cases are less likely to be tested than noncases. When φk = 1, we have that the probability of being tested is equal for both cases and
non-cases, and the non-central hyper-geometric distribution reduces to the standard hypergeometric distribution. In this parameterization, the φk parameter can be interpreted as
an odds ratio: the odds of a case being tested vs. the odds of a non-case being tested.
7

2.2

Partial identifiability

Given the assumptions detailed above, for each of the K groups, there are three unknown
parameters (latent states), IRk , IF Rk and φk , that must be estimated for every two observed quantities (Dk /Pk and CCk /Tk ). This suggests that a unique solution may not be
attainable without additional external data or prior information.
The problem at hand is sufficiently rich and complex that forming intuition about the
information-content of the data is challenging. In the Appendix (Section 8.1), we consider,
in depth, an asymptotic argument for partial identifiability. We determine that, depending
on the range and heterogeneity in the degree of preferential testing across groups, the data
can contribute substantial information about the infection fatality rate. Data from any
single group may only be weakly informative about the IFR, in the sense that only lower
and upper bounds for the IFR are estimable. However, we show that in some circumstances
there is very considerable sharpening of information when these bounds are combined across
groups, provided it is a priori plausible that the IFR heterogeneity across groups is modest.

A Bayesian model for small-P data and an illustrative example

3.1

A Bayesian model for small-P data

Bayesian models work well for dealing with partially identifiable models; see Gustafson
(2010). We describe a Bayesian model which assumes standard Gaussian random-effects
allowing both the infection rate (IR) and infection fatality rate (IFR) to vary between

8

groups with:
g(IF Rk ) ∼ N (θ, τ 2 ),

and

(4)

g(IRk ) ∼ N (β, σ 2 ),

(5)

for k in 1, . . . , K, where θ is the parameter of primary interest, τ 2 represents between group
IFR heterogeneity, β represents the mean g(infection rate), σ 2 describes the variability in
infection rates across the K groups, and g() is a given link function. For mathematical
convenience, we will adopt the complimentary log-log link function though there are many
sensible choices. Note that, alternatively, a simpler “fixed-effects” version of the model
arises by setting τ = 0 such that g(IF Rk ) = θ, for k = 1, . . . , K.
Putting together the assumptions for p(Dk |IF Rk , Ck ), p(CCk |Tk , Pk , Ck , φk ) and p(Ck |Pk , IRk )
defined in Section 2.1 along with prior distributions, Bayes’ Law takes the form:
p((θ, τ 2 ,β, σ 2 , C, IFR, IR, φ)|data) ∝ p(data|θ, τ 2 , β, σ 2 , C, IFR, IR, φ)

k=1

× p(θ)p(τ 2 )p(β)p(σ 2 )p(φ).
We are left to define prior distributions for the unknown parameters: θ, τ 2 , β, σ 2 , and φ.
Our strategy for priors on IR and IFR is to assume uninformative priors for the mean
of IFR and of IR and for the variance of IR but a strongly informative prior for the variance of IFR. This strategy reflects the assumption that the infection fatality rate varies
across jurisdictions much less than the infection rate itself (especially after accounting
9

for population level sources of heterogeneity; see Section 4.2). The priors are set accordingly: g−1 (θ) ∼ U nif orm(0, 1); g−1 (β) ∼ U nif orm(0, 1); τ ∼ half-N (0, 0.01); and
σ ∼ half-N (0, 1).
The only remaining component is p(φ). Our strategy for a prior on the degree of
preferential testing is to assume that cases are more likely to be tested than non-cases (i.e.,
φk > 1), that all values of φk are equally likely across jurisdictions, and that there is an
upper bound, 1 + γ, on degree of preferentiality. For the upper bound parameter, γ, we
assume an exponential prior, such that:
φk ∼ U nif orm(1, 1 + γ),

for k in 1, . . . , K; and γ ∼ Exp(λ = 0.5).

The prior specification therefore assumes that the uniform range of possible values for φk
is itself unknown. Setting λ = 0.5 implies that, a priori, a reasonable value for the φk odds
ratio is 2, (i.e., since E(γ) = 1/λ and E(φk ) = (1 + (γ + 1))/2). In the Appendix (Section
8.3), we illustrate this approach with an application to the artificial dataset introduced
earlier in Table 4.
In some scenarios, we might have some groups for which φk is known and equal to 1
(i.e., have data from some samples where testing is known to be truly random). Without
0

0

loss of generality, suppose this subset is the first k studies, such that for k = 1, . . . , k , we
have φk = 1. We will use this approach in the Europe data analysis (Section 6), in which
we assume φk is known and equal to 1 for data from representative seroprevalence studies.
We must emphasize that the performance of any Bayesian estimator will depend on
the choice of priors and that this choice can substantially influence the posterior when
few data are available (Berger, 2013; Lambert et al., 2005). The priors described here
represent a scenario where there is little to no a priori knowledge about the θ, β, and φ
model parameters. Inference would no doubt be improved should more informative priors

10

be specified based on probable values for each of these parameters. We briefly consider the
impact of priors in the simulation study in Section 5, where we look to different values for
λ.
We must also emphasize that, due to the partial identifiability issues (Section 2.2), a
delicate trade-off exists between the priors for the τ and φ parameters. For instance, if large
values of τ are made a priori plausible, then the posterior estimates of the φ parameters
will be driven downwards towards 1 (due to the γ ∼ Exp(λ = 0.5) prior). A relatively
homogeneous across-group IFR is central to identifiability and, as such, the aforementioned
“fixed-effects” version of the model (essentially equivalent to fixing τ = 0) may be more
feasible in situations when identification is particularly challenging (e.g., when there is very
little prior knowledge about the θ, β, and φ model parameters).

4.1

A Bayesian model for large-P data
Distributional approximations

When populations are large, we can simplify our model (in order to reduce the computational complexity), by replacing the non-central hyper-geometric distribution with a binomial distribution as follows:
CCk ∼ Binom(Tk , 1 − (1 − IRk )φk ),
Ck ∼ Binom(Pk , IRk ),
Dk |Ck ∼ Binom(Ck , IF Rk ),

11

(7)
(8)
(9)

for k in 1, . . . , K. Note that the φk parameter above no longer corresponds to an odds ratio,
yet the interpretation is similar. The odds ratio (OR) describing the association between
testing status and infection status is
log(OR) = log(1 − (1 − IR)φ ) − φ × log(1 − IR) − log(IR) + log(1 − IR).
For fixed IR, approximating this with a Taylor series in log(φ), about zero, gives: log(OR) ≈
cIR log(φ), where cIR = − log(1 − IR)/IR. Note that cIR → 1 as IR → 0. Therefore, in
the rare-infection realm, φ is indeed approximately the odds ratio for testing and infection
status.1
We can further simplify by marginalizing over the cases. Since we have the distribution
of Ck and the conditional distribution of Dk given Ck , and since both of these are binomials,
we have that unconditionally:
Dk ∼ Binom(Pk , IF Rk × IRk ).

Including group-level covariates

The proposed model can be expanded to include covariates specified as covariates at the
group level. These might be factors that are correlated with the probability of becoming
infected with SARS-Cov-2, with the probability of being tested, with the accuracy of the
test, and/or with the probability of dying from infection.
Suppose that X[1]k , . . . , X[h]k are h different group-level covariates that explain the k-th
1

We could have alternatively substituted the non-central hyper-geometric distribution with the known
Gaussian asymptotic approximation to the non-central hyper-geometric (Stevens, 1951). However, the
Gaussian approximation requires solving quadratic equations and therefore, might not necessarily help
reduce the computational complexity of our model; see Sahai and Khurshid (1995).

12

group’s infection rate, and that Z[1]k , . . . , Z[q]k are q different covariates that explain the
k-th group’s IFR. Then these can be incorporated as follows:
g(IRk ) ∼ N (β + β1 X[1]k + . . . + βh X[h]k , σ 2 ),
g(IF Rk ) ∼ N (θ + θ1 Z[1]k + . . . + θq Z[q]k , τ 2 ).

(11)
(12)

Age is a key factor for explaining the probability of COVID-19-related death. One
might therefore consider median age of each group as a predictor for the IFR, or perform
analyses that are stratified by different age groups (Onder et al., 2020). The latter strategy
has, for instance, been recommended to make accurate predictions for respiratory infections
(Pellis et al., 2020). With regards to the infection rate, time since first reported infection,
or time between first reported infection and the imposition of social distancing measures
might be predictive (Anderson et al., 2020).

4.3

MCMC

For the large-P model, Markov chain Monte carlo (MCMC) mixing can be slow because
different combinations of φk , cloglog(IRk ) and cloglog(IFRk ) can yield similar model probabilities. This is related to the identifiability issues discussed in the Appendix (Section 8.1).
To improve mixing and reduce computational time for the simulation study, we wrote this
model in the nimble package (de Valpine et al., 2017), which supports an extension of the
modeling language used in JAGS and makes it easy to configure samplers and provide new
samplers. Details of the MCMC implementation for nimble are presented in the Appendix
(Section 8.3). We also implemented the large-P model in the popular Stan package which
employs Hamiltonian MCMC algorithms (Carpenter et al., 2017).

Simulation study

5.1

Design

We conducted a simulation study in order to better understand the operating characteristics
of the proposed model. Specifically, we wished to evaluate the frequentist coverage of the
credible interval for θ, and investigate the impact of the chosen prior for the magnitude
of preferential testing (i.e., the impact of selecting different values for λ). As emphasized
in Gustafson et al. (2009), the average frequentist coverage of a Bayesian credible interval,
taken with respect to the prior distribution over the parameter space, will equal the nominal
coverage. This mathematical property is unaffected by the lack of identification. However,
the variability of coverage across the parameter space is difficult to anticipate and could be
highly affected by the choice of prior. For example, we might expect that, in the absence
of preferential testing (i.e., when γ = 0), coverage will be lower than the nominal rate.
However, if this is the case, coverage will need to be higher than the nominal rate when
γ > 0, so that the “average” coverage (taken with respect to the prior distribution over the
parameter space) is nominal overall.

We simulated datasets with K = 20 and k = 8. For k = 1, . . . , 8, population sizes were
obtained from a N egBin(20000, 1) distribution with a mean of 20,000 and for k = 9, . . . , 20,
population sizes were obtained from a N egBin(200000, 1) distribution. Parameter values
were as follows: θ = cloglog(0.02) = −3.90, β = cloglog(0.20) = −1.50, τ 2 = 0.005 and
σ 2 = 0.25. The testing rate for each population was obtained from a U nif orm(0.01, 0.10)
distribution so that the proportion of tested individuals in each population ranged from
1% to 10%. We considered eight values of interest for γ: 0, 1, 4, 11, 22, 34, 52, and 80 (for
simulation); and three different values of interest for λ: 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75 (for estimation).

14

The number of confirmed cases (CCk ) were simulated from Wallenius’ non-central hypergeometric distribution as detailed in Section 2.1. Note that with high γ levels, the vast
majority of tests will be positive (when γ = 52, positivity is about 75%; when γ = 80,
positivity is about 80%). The 12 “unknown” φk values, for k in 9, . . . , 20, simulated from
a U nif orm(1, γ + 1) distribution.
We fit three models to each unique dataset: M1 , M2 , and M3 . All three models follow
the same large-P framework detailed in Section 4.1 but consider different subsets of the
data. The M1 model uses only data from the samples for which φk is unknown, i.e., {Pk ,
Tk , CCk , and Dk } for k in 9, . . . , 20. The M2 model considers the data from all the groups,
i.e., {Pk , Tk , CCk , and Dk } for k in 1, . . . , 20. Finally, the M3 model uses only data from
the samples for which φk is known and equal to 1, i.e., {Pk , Tk , CCk , and Dk } for k in
1, . . . , 8. To be clear, the M2 and M3 models make the assumption of (correctly) known
φk = 1 for k = 1, . . . , 8.
We simulated 200 unique datasets and, for each, fit the three different models. The M1
and M2 models are fit 24 different times (= 3 × 8) for each unique dataset, each time with
λ assuming one of the three values of interest, and with one of the eight different sets of
CCk numbers (for k in 9, . . . , 20), corresponding to the eight γ values. For each case, we
recorded the width of the 90% highest posterior density (HPD) CI for θ and whether or
not the CI contained the target value of cloglog(0.02) = −3.90.
We specifically chose to conduct 200 simulation runs so as to keep computing time
within a reasonable limit while also reducing the amount of Monte Carlo standard error
(MCSE) to a reasonably small amount (for looking at coverage with 1 − α = 0.90, MCSE
p
will be approximately 0.90(1 − 0.90)/200 ≈ 0.02); see Morris et al. (2019). For each
simulation scenario, we used nimble to obtain 100,000 MCMC draws from the posterior

15

(20% burn-in, thinning of 50).

5.2

Results

Figure 1 plots the simulation study results. First, note that coverage for model M3 (based
on only the unbiased data) is approximately 0.90 as expected; see dotted black line on
Figure 1 lower-left panel. Results from the M1 model (upper panels, dashed lines) show
that the model provides at or above nominal coverage when γ = 1, but not otherwise. In
contrast, results from the M2 model (lower panels, solid lines) show that the model provides
at or above nominal coverage for a wide range of γ values. This suggests that, when some
representative data is available, appropriate estimation is achievable even in the presence
of a substantial and unknown amount of preferential testing. When γ = 11, the odds (on
average) for a case to be tested are more than six times the odds for a non-case (the average
φk value is equal to (1 + (γ + 1))/2), and yet the model is able to appropriately adjust.
Note that when γ = 0, coverage is well bellow nominal levels. This is likely due to the fact
that the true parameter sits on the boundary of the parameter space.
Results from the M2 and M3 models suggest that for a given range of γ values, the
M2 model (which makes use of all the data) is preferable to the M3 model (which uses
data only from those samples where testing is known to be representative/random). Both
achieve nominal coverage, but M2 does so with narrower interval widths. However, there
is a limit to the “added value” that the “non-representative” data provide. For example,
for γ ≥ 22, M3 intervals are narrower compared to M2 intervals (for all λ).
Finally, note that overall the interval width is much narrower for M2 relative to M1
(compare dashed lines in lower-right panel to those in upper-right panel of Figure 1) which
0

confirms that the k = 8 representative samples are very valuable for reducing the uncer16

tainty around θ. With regards to the COVID-19 pandemic, this emphasizes the importance
of conducting some amount of “unbiased testing” even if the sample sizes are relatively
small; see Cochran (2020).

Application- IFR of COVID-19 in Europe

Reducing uncertainty around the severity of COVID-19 is of great importance to policy makers and the public (Ioannidis, 2020b; Lipsitch, 2020). Comparisons between the
COVID-19 and seasonal influenza IFRs have impacted the timing and degree of social distancing measures and highlighted the need for more accurate estimates for the severity of
both viruses (Faust, 2020). The current lack of clarity means that policy makers are unsure
if cross-population differences are related to clinically relevant heterogeneity (i.e., due to
large τ 2 ) or to spurious heterogeneity driven by testing and reporting biases (i.e., due to
large γ).
We demonstrate how the proposed model could be used to estimate the IFR of COVID19 in Europe. Note that the main purpose of this analysis is to demonstrate the feasibility
of the proposed model. As such, we keep things relatively simple. For instance, we only consider countries belonging to the EU/EEA (European Economic Area), the United Kingdom,
and Switzerland, as these could be considered a reasonably homogeneous group. However,
we exclude Belgium since, uniquely, the country counts all suspect deaths in nursing homes
as COVID-19 deaths (Lee, 2020).
0

We selected k = 5 studies for which we assume there is no preferential testing. To do
so, we considered all European seroprevalence studies reporting an IR estimate (along with
a 95% confidence/credible interval) listed in the systematic review by Ioannidis (2020a).
From these, we selected only those studies that claimed to achieve a representative or
random sample from their study population.
It is important to note that the seroprevalence studies were conducted amongst populations which were particularly hard hit by infection. The result is that these populations
are not necessarily representative of the overall European population. It is unclear how this
18

might impact our model estimates. Also, while some of the seroprevalence studies report
the exact number of tests conducted (T ) and the number of confirmed cases recorded (CC),
to obtain estimates for the infection rate, there are numerous adjustments (e.g., adjusting
for testing sensitivity and specificity). Rather than work with the raw Tk , and CCk numbers published in the seroprevalence studies, we calculate effective data values for CCk and
Tk based on a binomial distribution that corresponds to the reported 95% CI for the IR.
By “inverting binomial confidence intervals” in this way we are able to properly use the
adjusted numbers for each of the five seroprevalence studies. This is a similar approach
to the strategy employed by Kümmerer et al. (2020) who assume that the IR follows a
Beta distribution with parameters chosen to match the 95% CI published in Streeck et al.
(2020). In the Appendix (Section 8.4), we go over the seroprevalence study data in detail.
We obtained, national official COVID-19 statistics as reported by Our World in Data
(OWID, 2020). Complete data was available for 26 countries which brings the total number
of groups to K = 31. The CCk and Tk numbers were selected as reported on May 1, 2020
(or the earliest date during the following week for which data was available). Numbers for
Dk for k = 6, . . . , K, were obtained from 14 days afterwards, to allow for the known delay
between the onset of symptoms and death. Note that our Tk numbers are not ideal since
some countries report the number of people tested, while others report the total number
of tests (which will be higher if a single person is tested several times).2 Also note that, as
stated in Section 2.1, the K different groups should, in principle, be entirely independent
samples. This is clearly not the case with the European data (case in point: there are three
different groups from within Switzerland; k = 2, k = 5, and k = 30).
We included several covariates about each country’s population (hospital capacity, out2

see ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing

19

break timing, and lockdown timing) to explain variation in IR and IF R. Specifically, for
the IR, we consider: (1) the number days since the country reported 10 or more confirmed
infections (“Days since outbreak”) (as reported by Hale et al. (2020)); (2) the number of
days between a country’s first reported infection and the imposition of social distancing
measures (“Days until lockdown”) (calculated based on when the Government Response
Stringency Index (GRSI) reached 20 or higher as reported in OWID (2020)); and (3) the
population density (“Pop. density”) (as reported by OWID (2020) and other publicly available sources3 ). For the IF R, we consider: (1) the share of the population that is 70 years
and older (“Prop. above 70 y.o.”) (as reported in Ioannidis (2020a) or OWID (2020)); and
(2) the number of hospital beds per 1,000 people (“Hosp. beds per 1,000”)4 . Tables 1 and
6 list all the data used in the analysis.

Using only seroprevalence studies

Using only the seroprevalence studies (i.e., only the first k = 5 studies listed in Table 1),
we fit the model as described in Section 4.1 without any adjustment for covariates. (With
only K = 5 groups there are few degrees of freedom available for including group-level
covariates). The model was fit using Stan (Carpenter et al., 2017), with 4 independent
chains, each with 10,000 draws (10% burn-in, thinning of 50). Figure 2 plots, in red, the
posterior estimates obtained for the IRk and IF Rk variables (for k = 1, . . . , 5) with 95%

Using all the data

We fit the model as described in Section 4.1 to all the data (listed in Tables 1 and 6) with
0

k = 5, K = 31, h = 3, and q = 2. Covariates were defined as the centered and scaled
logarithm of each metric as follows: X[1] = center-scale(log(“Days since outbreak”)); X[2] =
center-scale(log(“Days until lockdown” + 1)); X[3] = center-scale(log(“Population density”));
23

Z[1] = center-scale(log(“Prop. above 70 y.o.”)); and Z[2] = center-scale(log(“Hosp. beds per 1,000”)).
Standard normal priors (N (0, 1)) were used for each of β1 , β2 , β3 , θ1 , and θ2 . All other
priors were defined as in Section 3.1 with λ = 0.5.
The model was fit using Stan (Carpenter et al., 2017), with 4 independent chains, each
with 10,000 draws (10% burn-in, thinning of 50). Table 3 lists posterior estimates with
HPD 95% CIs for the main parameters of interest. The positive value obtained for θ1 (0.02,
95% CI = [-0.15, 0.20]) suggests that countries with older populations have higher IFRs,
whereas the negative value for θ2 (-0.44, 95% CI = [-0.63, -0.26]) suggests that countries
with more hospital beds are associated with lower IFRs. The positive values for β1 (0.23,
95% CI = [-0.06, 0.55]) and β2 (0.42, 95% CI = [0.16, 0.72]) suggest that the IR increases
with increasing time since the initial disease outbreak, and with increasing time between
the first reported infection and the imposition of social distancing measures. Finally, the
positive value for β3 (0.72, 95% CI = [0.44, 0.99]) suggests that a higher population density
is associated with a higher IR. Note that, as with a standard multivariable regression
of observational data, coefficient estimates are subject to the possibility of unobserved
confounding and multicollinearity.
Figure 3 plots the posterior estimates obtained for the IRk and IF Rk variables (for
k = 1, . . . , 31) with 95% HPD CIs. We also plot the posterior estimate of g−1 (β) and
g−1 (θ) (“Overall”). We obtain an estimate for overall IFR of g−1 (θ) = 0.47%, 95% C.I. =
[0.34%, 0.63%]. Note that we repeated our entire analysis setting the prior for γ with both
λ = 0.25 and λ = 0.75 and obtained estimates for the overall IFR of 0.50% (95% C.I. =
[0.37%, 0.67%]) and of 0.44% (95% C.I. = [0.30%, 0.59%]), respectively.
Our model can no doubt be improved by using appropriately specified informed priors
for the φ parameters based on what is known about COVID-19 testing. For example, in

Table 3: Posterior parameter estimates (posterior medians and 95% HPD CIs) from model
fit to data from only the seroprevalence studies (left) and from the full dataset (right).
related work, Grewelle and De Leo (2020) assume that testing capacity is directly proportional to the case load in each country (testing capacity, is estimated by tests performed per
positive case).5 As another example, the “H2 index” (Hale et al., 2020), which purportedly
reflects official government policy on who has access to testing within a given country, could
also be used to define informed priors for the φ parameters in a more sophisticated version
of our model.
We were curious as to whether the posterior model estimates we obtained for φk (for
k = 6, . . . , 31) were predictive of the H2 index. Using the data made available by Hale
et al. (2020), we calculated the average H2 index for each country in our analysis, for the
period between February 1st, 2020 and April 1st, 2020. Roughly speaking, a high H2 value
indicates broad access to testing (i.e., available to the general public) whereas a low H2
5

Grewelle and De Leo (2020) are thereby able to infer the “global IFR” using simple weighted linear
regression (i.e., regressing log(Dk /CCk ) ∼ log(IF Rk ) + β1 (CCk /Tk ), for k in 1, . . . , K, where β1 is an
unknown nuisance parameter).

26

value reflects a testing policy that restricts testing to only those who have symptoms or
meet specific criteria. Thus, countries with high H2 values should, in theory, have small
values of φk and vice-versa. That prediction is generally supported by the results seen in
Figure 4, although Iceland, Slovakia and Croatia appear to be exceptions.

Discussion

7.1

Model limitations

Estimation of the IFR is very challenging due to the fact that it is a ratio of numbers where
both the numerator and denominator are subject to a wide range of biases. Our proposed
model seeks to address only one particular type of bias pertaining to the denominator: the
bias in the number of cases due to preferential testing. With this in mind, we wish to call
attention to several other important sources of bias.
Cause of death information may be very inaccurate. To overcome this issue, many
suggest looking to “excess deaths,” by comparing aggregate data for all-cause deaths from
the time during the pandemic to the years prior (Leon et al., 2020). Using this approach
and a simple Bayesian binomial model, Rinaldi and Paradisi (2020) are able to obtain IFR
estimates without relying on official (possibly inaccurate) data for the number of COVID-19
deaths.
Some people who are currently sick and therefore at risk will eventually die of the
disease, but have not died yet. Due to the delay between disease onset and death, the
number of confirmed and reported COVID-19 deaths at a certain point in time will not
reflect the total number of deaths that will occur among those already infected (rightcensoring). This will result in the number of recorded deaths underestimating the true risk
of death. The denominator of the IFR must be the number of cases with known outcomes.
The model, as currently proposed, fails to account for the (unknown) number of false
positive and false negative tests. When both the test specificity and the infection rate is low,
false positives can substantially inflate the estimated infection rate and as a consequence,
the IFR could be biased downwards. In principle, the model could accommodate for this

28

by specifying priors for test sensitivity and specificity; see Kümmerer et al. (2020); Gelman
and Carpenter (2020) and Neil et al. (2020).
Finally, because the model uses data that are aggregated at the group level, estimates are
potentially subject to ecological bias (Pearce, 2000). While including group-level covariates
may help reduce variability in the estimates, adjustment using group-level covariates can
also lead to biased, misleading results (Li and Hua, 2020).

7.2

Concluding remarks

We demonstrated our proposed model with an application to European COVID-19 data,
in which we relied on data from seroprevalence studies that self-reported as representative.
When combined with data from nationally reported statistics, this data enabled us to obtain
appropriate estimates for not only the overall IFR but also for country-level IFRs and IRs,
as well as for the association of these with various explanatory factors. We note that our
estimate for the overall IFR (0.47%, 95% C.I. = [0.34%, 0.63%]) is somewhat lower than
an estimate obtained by the meta-analysis of Meyerowitz-Katz and Merone (2020) from
European seroprevalence studies (0.77%, 95% C.I. = [0.55%, 0.99%]) and reiterate that the
primary intention of our analysis was to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed model.
Existing efforts to better understand the distribution of SARS-CoV-2 infection (and
its lethality) at the population level are unfortunately met by recruiting challenges (Gudbjartsson et al., 2020; Bendavid et al., 2020), leading to an over-representation of people who
are concerned about their exposure and/or an under-representation of individuals who are
self-quarantining, isolating, or hospitalized because of the virus. Obtaining representative
data, while challenging and costly, is however, possible. In Spain, a nationwide populationbased seroprevalence study was recently completed (Pollán et al., 2020) and by combining
29

these data with available excess mortality data (recorded at the provincial level from the
Instituto Nacional de Estadı́stica (INE, 2020)), researchers should be able to obtain relatively unbiased and accurate estimates of the COVID-19 IFR for the Spanish population.
Outside of Spain, in the absence of large-scale unbiased data, researchers must work with
whatever data is available. Our model suggests a coherent way to do just this. Indeed, we
demonstrated that, when fit with an appropriate model, biased data can supplement any
available representative data in order to refine one’s inference and shed light on the impact
of explanatory factors.
In a typical situation of drawing inference from a single biased sample, obtaining appropriate estimates is challenging, if not impossible, without some sort of external validation
data. Intuition suggests that one might only be able to do a sensitivity analysis with respect
to the impact of bias. Indeed, applying prior distributions for the degree of preferential
testing and proceeding with Bayesian inference could be regarded as a probabilistic form
of sensitivity analysis (see, for instance, Greenland (2005)). What is perhaps less intuitive,
and what we demonstrated with the proposed model, is that, if one has multiple samples
of biased data, each subject to a different degree of bias, the “heterogeneity of bias” can
help inform what overall adjustment is required for appropriate inference.
The aggregation of data from both biased and unbiased samples is a problem that
applies to many types of evidence synthesis (and is often overlooked) (De Angelis et al.,
2015; Birrell et al., 2018). In that sense, the solutions we put forward may be more broadly
applicable. Future work will investigate whether the “heterogeneity of bias” principle of
can be used to derive appropriate estimates in a meta-analysis where individual studies are
subject to varying degrees of bias due to unobserved confounding or measurement error.

Issues of (un)identifiability

Table 4 provides a small artificial dataset to help illustrate the type of data being described
and the impact of different degrees of preferential testing. In this dataset, we have K =
12 groups and the (unknown) infection rate varies substantially from 13% to 53%. The
unknown infection fatality rate only varies slightly, from 0.017% to 0.022%. Values for φk in
this dataset are evenly distributed between 1 and γ + 1, for four different values of γ = 0, 4,
11, and 22. When γ = 0, the number of true cases (i.e. actual infections) is approximately
14 times higher than the number of confirmed cases. In contrast, when γ = 22, the number
of true cases is only about 5 times higher than the number of confirmed cases.

Here we present an asymptotic argument which lays bare the flow of information. Consider a situation in which an infinite amount data are available. In so-called “asymptotia,”
we have that populations are approaching infinite size (i.e., for k in 1,. . . , K, we have
Pk → ∞), and that the number of tests also approaches infinity (i.e., for k in 1,. . . , K, we
have Tk → ∞). Recall that a hyper-geometric distribution is asymptotically equivalent to
a binomial distribution. As such, we consider the following:
Dk ∼ Binom(Pk , ak ); and
CCk ∼ Binom(Tk , bk ),
where ak = IF Rk × IRk and bk = 1 − (1 − IRk )φk .
Note that ak simply follows from the conditional binomial distribution. However, this
particular parameterization of bk does not emerge from the limit of the non-central hypergeometric distribution. As we discuss later in Section 4.1, we have simply chosen a convenient parameterization for bk with the important connotation that φk = 1 corresponds to
testing at random, but as φk increases, the testing is more preferentially weighted to those
truly infected. For example, with an infection rate of IRk = 0.01, the binomial sampling
probability, bk , is approximately 10 times larger than the infection rate if φk = 10, and
about 18 times larger if φk = 20.
Presume that the a priori defensible information about the preferential sampling in the
k-th group is expressed in the form
φk ∈ [φk , φ̄k ],

(13)

i.e., φk and φ̄k are investigator-specified bounds on the degree of preferential sampling for
that jurisdiction. If one is certain that cases are as likely, or at least as likely, to be tested
as non-cases, φk = 1 is appropriate. If testing is known to be entirely random for the k-th
37

group, one would set φk = φ̄k = 1.
Note that for fixed (ak , bk ), IF Rk is a function of φk with the form
IF Rk (φk ) =

ak
.
1 − (1 − bk )(1/φk )

(14)

Examining (14), knowledge of (ak , bk ), in tandem with (13) restricts the set of possible
values for IF Rk . In fact it is easy to verify that (14) is monotone in φk , hence the restricted
set is an interval. We write this interval as Ik (ak , bk , φk , φ̄k ), or simply as Ik for brevity. This
is the jurisdiction-specific identification interval for IF Rk . As we approach asymptotia for
the k-th group, all values inside the interval remain plausible, while all values outside are
ruled out; see Manski (2003). This is the essence of the partial identification inherent to
this problem.
Thinking now about the meta-analytic task of combining information, we envision that
both φk and IRk could exhibit considerable variation across jurisdictions. However, the
variation in IF R could be small, particularly if sufficient jurisdiction-specific covariates are
included (see Section 4.2). That is, after adjustment for a jurisdiction’s age-distribution,
healthcare capacity, and so on, residual variation in IF R could be very modest. When
modeling, we would invoke such an assumption via a prior distribution. For understanding in asymptotia, however, we simply consider the impact of an a priori bound on the
variability in IF R. Let τ be the standard deviation of IF R across jurisdictions. Then we
presume τ does not exceed an investigator-specified upper bound of τ̄ , i.e., τ ≤ τ̄ .
The jurisdiction-specific prior bounds on the extent of preferential sampling, and the
prior bound on IF R variation across jurisdictions, along with the limiting signal from the
data in the form of (a, b), gives rise to an identification region for the average infection

38

fatality rate, IF R = K −1

PK

k=1

IF Rk . Formally, this interval is defined as


I(a, b, φ, φ̄, τ̄ ) = IF R : τ ≤ τ̄ , IF Rk ∈ Ik (ak , bk , φk , φ̄k ), ∀k ∈ {1, . . . , K} .

(15)

Again, the interpretation is direct: in the asymptotic limit, all values of IF R inside this
interval are compatible with the observed data, and all values outside are not. The primary
question of interest is whether this interval is narrow or wide under realistic scenarios, since
this governs the extent to which we can learn about IF R from the data.
In general, evaluating (15) for given inputs is an exercise in quadratic programming
nested within a grid search, hence can be handled with standard numerical optimisation.
However, the special case of τ̄ = 0 is noteworthy in terms of developing both scientific and
mathematical intuition. Consequently, we explore this case in some depth in what follows.
Scientifically, τ̄ = 0 represents the extreme limit of an a priori assumption that, possibly after covariate adjustment, IF R is a ‘biological constant’ which does not vary across
jurisdictions. If the prospects for inference are not good when this assumption holds, they
will be even less good under the less strict assumption that the IF R heterogeneity is small,
but not necessarily zero. Mathematically, the case is much simpler, with (15) reducing to
I(a, b, φ, φ̄, 0) = ∩k Ik (ak , bk , φk , φ̄k ).

(16)

As intuition must have it, without heterogeneity, a putative value for the ‘global’ IFR is
compatible with the observed data if and only if it is compatible with the data from every
jurisdiction individually.
To illustrate, consider a scenario with K = 12 jurisdictions, with a constant infection
fatality rate of 2%, i.e., IF Rk = 0.02, for k in 1, . . . , 12. Say that the infection rates for
39

these jurisdictions lie between 0.132 and 0.526, as per Table 1. Furthermore, say that the
unknown φk values range between 1 and 23, as per the rightmost column (γ = 22) of Table
1.
Now say the investigator pre-specifies (φk , φ̄k ) = (1, 40) for all k. As such, the a priori
bounds are correct, for all jurisdictions. The resulting jurisdiction-specific identification
intervals, Ik , are depicted in the bottom left-hand panel of Figure 5. (The top and middle
left-hand panels correspond to the identical situation but with φk values listed in the γ = 4
and γ = 11 columns of Table 1 respectively.) Also depicted by the green rectangle is
the global identification interval, i.e., the intersection of the individual intervals. In the
present scenario (γ = 22), this is indeed narrow, ranging from 0.0200 to 0.0328. (For
the γ = 4, γ = 11 and γ = 22 scenarios, the global identification intervals are [0.0200,
0.1419], [0.0200, 0.0606], and [0.0200, 0.0328], respectively.) Thus, depending on the range
and heterogeneity in φk values, it appears that data can contribute substantial information
about the (constant) infection fatality rate.
As can be seen immediately from Figure 5 (left-hand panels), in the present example
the binding constraints arise from the first and twelfth jurisdictions, which happen to have
the least and most amounts of preferential testing. However, this pattern does not hold
in general. One can easily construct pairs of infection rates for which the jurisdiction
with more preferential testing has a smaller upper endpoint for Ik and/or a larger lower
endpoint. Thus the values of φk alone do not determine which two jurisdictions will provide
the binding information about IF R.
Figure 5 (right-hand panels) shows how the global identification interval is wider when
τ = 0.002. For reference, for the IFR values listed in Table 1, τ = SD(IF R1:12 ) = 0.00124.

the green rectangles are [0.0139, 0.1483], [0.0137, 0.0670] and [0.0137, 0.0386], respectively.
Now consider the evaluation of (15) for τ > 0, i.e., where a limited heterogeneity in
IF R is permitted. Recall that quadratic programming constitutes the minimization of a
quadratic function subject to linear constraints, and these may be a mix of equality and
inequality constraints. Let x be a candidate value, which we will test for membership in
the identification interval. To perform this test, we use a standard quadratic programming
package (quadprog) to minimize the quadratic function V ar(IF R), subject to the equality
constraint IF R = x and the 2K inequality constraints which restrict IF Rk to the interval
Ik for each k. By the definition of (6) then, x belongs in the identification interval if and
only if the minimized variance does not exceed τ 2 .
Thus a simple grid search over values of x numerically determines the identification
interval. Note that so long as a and b arise from values of φ within the prescribed bounds,
the underlying value of IF R must belong to the identification interval. Thus two numerical
searches can be undertaken. One starts at the underlying value and tests successively larger
x until a failing value is obtained. The other starts at the underlying value and does the
same, but moving downwards.

Illustrative example

We illustrate the proposed model with the simple artificial dataset introduced earlier in
Table 4. The dataset considers K = 12 groups with average populations of 2,000 individuals
(Pk obtained from a N egBin(2000, 1) distribution). The data were simulated such that,
across all 12 groups, the expected overall IFR is 2% (i.e., icloglog(θ) = 0.02; θ = −3.90),
and the expected overall IR is 20% (i.e., icloglog(β) = 0.20; β = −1.50). Variability

We fit the model (M1 ) as detailed in Section 3.1, where k = 0, and K = 12, and also
fit the model where γ = 0 is fixed (M{γ=0} ), corresponding to a situation in which one
assumes that none of the populations are subject to any preferential testing. Each model is
fit using JAGS (just another Gibbs’ sampler) (Kruschke, 2014), with 5 independent chains,
each with 500,000 draws (20% burn-in, thinning of 50). The results, including posterior
medians and highest posterior density (HPD) 95% credible intervals (CI), are listed in
Table 5. Figures 6 - 7 plot a selection of diagnostics for the MCMC; the prior-posterior

When γ = 0, note that the 95% CI for g−1 (θ) is much wider with M1 compared to with
M{γ=0} . This reflects the additional uncertainty of not knowing about the absence/presence
of preferential testing. Otherwise, when γ > 0, we see that ignoring preferential testing has
significant consequences. With the M{γ=0} model, the 95% CI for g−1 (θ) fails to include

the 95% CI for g−1 (θ). This suggests that, with limited data, there is an upper bound on
the degree of preferential testing for which the model can adjust.

nimble MCMC details

Using nimble, we applied two sampling strategies for the trio (φk , cloglog(IRk ), cloglog(IFRk ))
for each k in 1,. . . , K. In all cases the univariate sampling method was adaptive randomwalk Metropolis-Hastings. For notation, we drop the subscript k and define η1 = cloglog(IRk )
and η2 = cloglog(IFRk ).
First, we included a block sampler on (φ, η1 , η2 ) for each k, along with the usual univariate samplers on each element of the trio. Second, we included samplers in two transformed
coordinate spaces.

Define transformed coordinates (z1 , z2 ) = (h1 (η1 , η2 ), h2 (η1 , η2 )) =

(exp(η1 ) + exp(η2 ), exp(η1 ) − exp(η2 )). (Based on the cloglog link, the quantities exp(η1 )
and exp(η2 ) may be interpreted as continuous time rates.)
Now z1 represents the more strongly identified quantity, so mixing in z2 can be slow.
Hence we wish to improve mixing in the z2 direction. To do so, a sampler can operate in
the (z1 , z2 ) coordinates while transforming the prior such that it is equivalent in (z1 , z2 )
to what was specified in the original coordinates, (η1 , η2 ). Using P (·) for priors, we have
log(P (z1 , z2 )) = log(P (η1 , η2 )) − log(|J|), where |J| is the determinant of the Jacobian of
(z1 , z2 ) with respect to (η1 , η2 ). In this case, |J| = 2 exp(η1 + η2 ).
The other transformed coordinates used were (z1 , z2 ) = (log(φ) + η1 , log(φ) − η1 ). Note
that log(φ) + η1 = log(− log((1 − IR)φ )). Hence z1 represents the more strongly identified
quantity, so we wish to improve mixing by sampling in the z2 direction. We have the same
formulation as above, with |J| = 2/φ.

Seroprevalence study data

Consider the Europe data, for k = 1, . . . , 5:

• k = 1: Gangelt, Germany- Streeck et al. (2020) estimated the infection prevalence
from a “random population sample” obtained between March 31st, 2020 and April
6th, and provide a 95% CI for the IR of [12.31%, 24.40%].6 This uncertainty interval
is equivalent to a binomial distribution with 27 confirmed cases from 153 tests. The
relevant number of deaths is 7 (recorded on April 15th, 2020), as listed by Ioannidis
(2020a). With a total population of 12,597, this corresponds to a crude frequentist
95% CI for the IFR of [0.10%, 0.97%].
• k = 2: Geneva, Switzerland- Based on the data collected by Stringhini et al.
(2020), Perez-Saez et al. (2020) estimate a 95% CI for the IR of [8.15%, 13.95%]
for a “representative sample of the general population” of the canton of Geneva
(enrolment between April 6th and May 9th).7 This uncertainty interval is equivalent
to a binomial distribution with 48 confirmed cases amongst 440 tests. The relevant
number of deaths is 243 (recorded on April 30th, 2020), as listed by Ioannidis (2020a).8
With a total population of 506,765, this corresponds to a crude frequentist 95% CI
for the IFR of [0.30%, 0.67%].
• k = 3: Luxembourg: Snoeck et al. (2020) “recruited a representative sample of the
Luxembourgish population” between April 16th and May 5th, and obtained a 95% CI
of [1.23%, 2.77%].9 This uncertainty interval corresponds to about 23 confirmed cases

Streeck et al. (2020) reports two different 95% CIs, obtained with an without applying a “correction
factor”: [15.84%; 24.40%] and [12.31%; 18.96%], respectively.

Population number for the canton of Geneva obtained from Perez-Saez et al. (2020).

Ioannidis (2020a): “For the number of COVID-19 deaths, the number of deaths recorded at the time
chosen by the authors of each study was selected, whenever the authors used such a death count up to a
specific date to make inferences themselves. If the choice of date had not been done by the authors, the
number of deaths accumulated until after 1 week of the mid-point of the study period was chosen.”

Snoeck et al. (2020) report two different 95% CIs, obtained with an without adjustment for age, gender

from 1,213 tests. The relevant number of deaths is 92 (recorded on May 2nd, 2020),
as listed by Ioannidis (2020a). With a total population of 615,729, this corresponds
to a crude frequentist 95% CI for the IFR of [0.44%, 1.49%].
• k = 4: Split-Dalmatia County, Croatia: Jerkovic et al. (2020) conducted serological testing for antibodies from April 23rd to April 28th, and obtained a 95% CI for
the IR of [0.64%, 2.05%] (from “a representative sample size for the Split-Dalmatia
County population, which could reflect a relatively realistic antibody seroprevalence
in the county”). This uncertainty interval corresponds to about 12 confirmed cases
from 937 tests. The relevant number of deaths is 29 (recorded on May 3rd, 2020), as
listed by the Croatian Institute of Public Health (www.koronavirus.hr). With a total
population of 447,723, this corresponds to a crude frequentist 95% CI for the IFR of
[0.22%, 1.47%].
• k = 5: Zurich, Switzerland (May): Emmenegger et al. (2020) estimate a 95%
CI for the IR of [0.6%, 1.8%] for “the first half of April 2020” and note that “the
prevalence reported here is truly representative of the population under study.” This
uncertainty interval corresponds to about 13 confirmed cases from 1,166 tests. The
relevant number of deaths is 127 (recorded on May 15th, 2020), as listed by Ioannidis
(2020a). With a total population of 1,520,968, this corresponds to a crude frequentist
95% CI for the IFR of [0.39%, 1.66%].
