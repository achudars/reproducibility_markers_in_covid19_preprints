Abstract
The sudden rise of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
pandemic early 2020 throughout the world has called into drastic action measures to
do instant detection and reduce the spread rate. The common diagnostics testing
methods has been only partially effective in satisfying the booming demand for fast
detection methods to contain the further spread. However, the point-of-risk accurate
diagnosis of this new emerging viral infection is paramount as simultaneous normal
working operation and dealing with symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 can become the norm
for years to come. Sensitive cost-effective biosensor with mass production capability is
crucial throughout the world until a universal vaccination become available. Optical
label-free biosensors can provide a non-invasive, extremely sensitive rapid detection
technique up to ~1 fM (10 -15) concentration along with few minutes sensing. These
biosensors can be manufactured on a mass-scale (billions) to detect the COVID-19 viral
load in nasal, saliva, urinal, and serological samples even if the infected person is
asymptotic. Methods investigated here are the most advanced available platforms for
biosensing optical devices resulted from the integration of state-of-the-art designs and
materials. These approaches are including but not limited to integrated optical devices,
plasmonic resonance and also emerging nanomaterial biosensors. The lab-on-a-chip
platforms examined here are suitable not only for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein detection
but also other contagious virions such as influenza, and middle east respiratory
syndrome (MERS).

I. INTRODUCTION
A. Importance of highly sensitive point of care detection
The Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and its rapid growth rate has
driven an unprecedented worldwide demand for measures to mitigate its fast spread rate1–3.
Adding mandatory large-scale policies like social distancing and extreme antiviral
disinfection measures and protocols in coping with infected patients, it becomes paramount
to have detection and curing system developed in a catastrophic crisis state of which very
few mankind alive have experienced before. It is a commonly held view that pressures of
war have stimulated advances in engineering, science, and medicine. Therefore, the new
invisible battle against SARS-CoV-2 virus infection can stimulate major breakthroughs in
the development of diagnosis and treatment systems. SARS-CoV-2 highly contagious
infection is hard to detect as patients can be present with clinically inapparent symptoms
including fever, cough, or shortness of breath 4. The worldwide morbidity and mortality of
SARS-CoV-2 plus no available vaccine or guaranteed treatments on the horizon as of mid2020 bolds the necessity for researchers to probe various medical interventions. Immediate
cost-effective point-of-risk measures like identification, diagnosis and isolation of the
infected individual is still regarded as the single best viable solution to slow down
this pneumonia pandemic.
B. Structure of the SARS-CoV-2
SARS-CoV is an enveloped, single stranded RNA virus, that exists in humans and animals,
and is mainly transmitted through aerosols and nearby interpersonal contacts 5,6. Once the virus
enters the body, it sticks to primary target cells which provides plenty of virus receptors, the
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2)

5,7

. Its genome RNA infusion into the cell results in

the formation of protein building blocks consist of spike, envelope, membrane, nucleocapsid,
and proteins8–10. Thus, human SARS-CoVs relies heavily on ACE2 for infusion into the target
cell for which S glycoprotein trimeric spikes on the surface mediates the entrance into the host
cell11. The S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV is therefore the main target for neutralizing antibodies
(nAbs) 12. Similar SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 amino acid identity in their S proteins makes
them prone to have analogous Immunogenic surfaces on these antigens 13. Coronaviruses
demonstrate a complex pattern for receptor recognition7,14,15 (Figure 1.c). The attempts to block
the infusion of virus has been carried out through targeting mainly spike protein of SARSCoV-2 and the receptor binding domain (RBD). Antibodies developed specifically for these
3

regions can expand the potency and power and chance of success against the infusion of SARSCoV-2 in the host cell. Once the virus enters the body through the cells, it replicates and virions
are then set free to infect new target cells16,17. SARS Infectious viral particles can be found in
respiratory secretions, urine and sweat. SARS-CoV infection harms lung tissues resulting in
pneumonia with rapid respiratory deterioration and failure and in almost %5 of cases, death18,19.
Development of effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 can be effectively applied through S
protein and especially the receptor binding domain (RBD) as they induce highly potent
neutralizing antibody to block virus binding and its membrane infusion or forming immunity
protective layer against viral infection5.

provide great affinity to bio receptors functionalized on the surface of biosensor. (b) (A) Life cycle of pathogenic
human SARS-CoVs. The virus enters the target cell through respective cellular receptor angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the

membranes of host cells. Viral genomic RNA is then unveiled in the cytoplasm and

translated into viral polymerase proteins. Viral RNA and nucleocapsid (N) structural protein are replicated and
transcribed in the cytoplasm to form a mature virion, then released from host cells 12. (c) The virus enters the target
cell by first

binding its S glycoproteins to the respective cellular receptor

protein (red) mediates the virus entry into host cells. It binds to the angiote nsin converting enzyme 2 (blue) and
fuses viral and host membranes.

C. Detection mechanisms for SARS-CoV-2 viral infection
The most standard procedure for identifying pathogens like SARS-CoV-2 relies on real-time
reverse transcription- polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in which the virus ribonucleic
acid (RNA) molecules (Fig. 1) go through a time consuming labeling procedure known as
reverse transcription (RT)

20

. For patients who present late with a viral load

below the

detection limit of RT-PCR assays, serological diagnosis with less sensitivity is also used.
The aforementioned process and similar clinical diagnosis requires advanced laboratories,
equipment and expertise hard to be found in under-developed remote areas that are more
prone to the outbreak20–24.
The test is done for a qualitative analysis of nucleic acid from the SARS-CoV-2 gathered from
people who meet SARS-CoV-2 virus clinical infection signs and symptoms (Fig 1.b). It has
also been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can be clinically detected from saliva, blood, and urine
samples in 30 to 45 minutes. Considering the high cost and time-consuming nature of clinical
diagnosis procedure like RT-PCR (minimum 3 hrs25) and test kit requiring samples generated
by urine, saliva, blood and nasopharyngeal swabs (minimum 30 minutes9–11), the need to
develop a fast-accurate detection method for SARS-CoV-2 is better recognized. Biosensors
can provide the next best alternative reliable solution to clinical diagnosis with much faster
real-time detection without compromising sensitivity and accuracy29,30. Optical biosensors are
particularly likely to become the future COVID-19 diagnostic tools31–35. By exploiting the
strong light-matter interactions, one can create an ultra-sensitive label-free real-time detection
platform for novel SARS-COV-2. Primarily, an optical biosensor translates the capture of the
target analyte in a measurable alteration of a light property, such as refractive index (RI),

6

intensity or resonance shift, through different methods such as resonators and interferometers
(Fig. 2).
However, due to time-sensitivity and shocking nature of the COVID-19 pandemic,
early efforts for detection have been mainly based on how existing systems can be integrated
together competently to outperform the existing processes in respect to sensitivity and timeconsumption. It has been demonstrated by Chen et al. and Alam et al. 36,37 that deep learning
methods can be efficiently used to aid radiologists in real-time accurate diagnosis of
COVID-19 infection from computed tomography (CT) images. Artificial intelligence (AI)
technology have been implemented to thoroughly process a large group of patient's
characteristics by four different algorithms to come up with the 18 diagnostic factors relating
to COVID-1938. Zhang et al. reported the use of graphene field effect transistors (FETs) in
combination with selective antibodies to develop coronavirus immunosensors 39.
Combination of plasmonic photothermal effect and localized surface plasmon resonance
sensing transduction has also been proposed as promising for COVID-19 diagnosis29.
D. Principle of lab-on-a-chip optical biosensors
To spot and monitor the real-time binding of small numbers of biomolecules such as
proteins, biosensors with ultra-high sensitivity are required.

Fig 2. Schematic working principle of a lab-on-a-chip (LOC) optical biosensor.

Optical transducers have been extensively researched, commercialized and deployed in
hospitals. Label-free optical biosensing can provide sensitive and durable point-of-care testing
(POCT) device which is imperative for SARS-CoV-2 epidemic containment as it also can be
easily operated at the point-of-risk by individuals without specialty training40 (Fig. 2). On top
of that, label-free optical biosensors have exhibited a strong conceivable potential to grow
expeditiously in healthcare and biomedical fields as they provide a condensed accurate
analytical tool to promote mass-scale screening of a broad range of samples through different
parameters35,41,42. Optical biosensing does work in different physical transduction principles
such as interferometers, resonators and plasmonic43 and has been investigated to monitor many
viruses with a good accuracy in different studies31,44,45.
E. Surface functionalization strategies
The difficulty of measuring physical features of biological analytes in a biosensor has led
to label-based techniques in which an additional molecule is attached to immobilized target
molecules, viruses, or cells to enhance quantitative signal41. In a typical biosensor, the specific
bioreceptors are immobilized on the chip sensing area to detect the targeted pathogens or
proteins. Only the target biomolecules will be bounded to their corresponding biomolecular
receptor upon introduction of analytes into the sensing area.
Notable examples of labels used in biosensing are dye molecules, a fluorescent tag, or enzyme.
Various types of bioreceptors-targets coupling mechanisms have been also demonstrated in Fig
3 including antibody-antigen binding, enzyme-substrate catalytic reaction and cDNA-DNA
hybridization. These labels require sophisticated reagent selection and modification that in turn
come with the drawback of perturbing the assay and making final detection a challenging task.
On top of that, labeling chemistry is both expensive and time-consuming. Thus, recent
development in biosensing systems have been more intrigued by unlabeled or unmodified
biomolecules (label-free biosensing)35,41,46,47in which native molecular properties like
molecular weight and RI are utilized for sensing. Label-free detection does have its own
shortcomings for example, it requires low non-specific binding43 and sufficient signal to be
generated upon targets binding35. However, its benefits such as providing real time analysis
by simplifying assays and reducing time and number of steps required as well as eliminating
experimental uncertainty far exceed its limitations48.
The sensing transduction signals in Optical label-free biosensing platform functions
based on miniscule changes in refractive index resulting from the attachment of biomolecules
to the immobilized bioreceptors. It is of vital importance to have a highly sensitive

8

biorecognition layer on the transducer surface in a label-free optical biosensors43,49,50. It goes
without saying that the biosensor final sensitivity and specificity is strongly dependent on the
immobilized molecules and the accessibility of target analytes to them. Therefore, the
optimization of sensing surfaces and their biofunctionalization strategies is a significant factor
for an accurate label-free optical biosensor where the sensitivity and accuracy are highly
necessitated43.

virus binding to ACE2 receptors on a human cell (Inset shows the coronavirus spike protein (red) mediates
the virus entry into host cells. It binds to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (blue) and fuses viral and host
membranes).

The diverse range of target molecules and biosensor applications make it extremely
difficult for a universal surface biofunctionalization procedure to be obtainable; hence, the
procedure needs to be custom designed consequently. In a graphene-based Field Effect
Biosensing(FEB), the surface is functionalized for protein immobilization with anti-Zika NS1
mouse mAb 6B1 developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention51. Polyethylene
glycol (PEG) has been studied particularly for removing proteins from the surface of silicon
based biosensors as it provides a stable and anti-absorptive block against undesired nonspecific interactions52,53. Detection of specific antibodies directed to viruses such as SARSCoV-2 is another choice of identification for spotting infection. It is widely accepted that
9

immunoglobulin M (IgM)and G (IgG) provide the first line of defense during viral infections27.
However, it has been shown that for SARS infections, the IgM and IgG antibody could be
detected in patients’ blood after 3–6 and 8 days, respectively. Thus, targeting antibodies is not
a suitable method for screening early cases of COVID-19. Detection of COVID-19 viruses in
the range of picomolar (pM) to attomolar (aM) concentrations are possible if the biosensor
provides a sensitivity range of 10−6 ~ 10−7 refractive index units (RIUs). Slow light-based
biosensors are tremendously sensitive to refractive index variations and can determine the
interactions with receptor biomolecules with the pM level. Most commercially available
POCTs like home-use pregnancy and influenza test are based on immunostrips with the
sensitivity level of nanomolar54. Both observation of the resonant shift or the reflectivity
change will fulfill the requirement of the sensitivity.
The two-dimensional AuNIs functionalized with cDNA receptors (RdRp-COVID-C)
can perform a selective detection of the RdRp-COVID through DNA hybridization29. The
surface functionalization of sensor surfaces has resulted in sensitivity improvement and
suppressing the nonspecific bindings29. The virus-like particle absorption has resulted in more
SPR peak shift on non-functionalized surfaces compared to functionalized one simply as there
are a greater number of adsorption sites on it53.
Different structures have their own advantages and disadvantages. Elisa-based sensing requires
additional secondary binding anti-body usage while it limits the application for fast detection
requirements.
II. INTEGRATED OPTICAL BIOSENSORS
Here, we explore the most well-defined bio-photonic sensing mechanisms based on
functionalized waveguides, interferometer, and resonance shift in microcavities.
A. Evanescent wave sensing: refractive index and absorption variation
Due to its immunity to electromagnetic interference (EMI), compactness and high
selectivity, optical waveguides have attracted special attention as a basic biose nsing
system55,56. The interaction of target molecules with bioreceptors on the surface leads to
effective index and absorption coefficient change (Fig. 4 (a)). The effective index change or
loss change is a function of the concentration of biological or chemical targets on the surface.
Effective mode index change for a perturbed waveguide can be calculated through the variation
method47:
Δ𝑛𝑒𝑓𝑓 =

2 −𝑛2
𝑛𝑚
𝑐

𝑍0 𝑃

∬|𝐸(𝑥, 𝑦)|2 𝑑𝑥𝑑𝑦
10

(1)

where 𝐸(𝑥, 𝑦) is the electric field, 𝑍0 is the free space impedance and 𝑃 represents the light
wave power, 𝑛𝑐 and 𝑛𝑚 are the refractive indexes of the aqueous solution without analyte, and
molecular adsorption layer, respectively.
The vertical distance from the interface z does reduce the strength of the evanescent
electric field exponentially. The penetration depth (d) can be calculated from the incident
wavelength (λ) and incident angle (𝜃) using the following formula:
𝑑=

𝜆

(2)

4𝜋 √𝑛0 𝑠𝑖𝑛2 𝜃 −𝑛12

Sensitivity (S) and limit of detection (LOD) are the two main criteria for evaluating the
performance of the evanescent field sensor, which in turn depends on the strength of the
interaction between the substance and light in a solution or on the surface 56. In waveguidebased sensors, the expression of surface sensitivity (𝑆𝑊𝐺 ) is defined by the change in the
effective refractive index (𝜕𝑛𝑒𝑓𝑓 ) of the surface vis-a-vis the change in the additional layer of
thin molecules (𝜕𝜌):
𝑆𝑊𝐺 =

𝜕𝑛𝑒𝑓𝑓

(3)

𝜕𝜌

The surface sensitivity to specific target molecules is not suitable for general
comparisons between sensors operating with different biosensing assays.
Figure 4 illustrates several different types of typical waveguide-based biosensors. Surface
perturbation will cause change in absorption coefficient, which can be monitored in the output
intensity (I) of waveguide. Optical waveguides have been extensively explored in different
platforms including, but not limited to, rectangular waveguides57, tapered fibres58 and more
sophisticated structures such as photonic crystal waveguides (PCW)

47,59–68

, subwavelength

grating57,69 and Bragg grating70. As shown in Fig. 4 (b), Klimant et al. integrate a sensor-based
planar waveguide with a 460 nm light emitting diode (LED), compatible with inkjet or screenprinting processing technologies. Correspondingly, the photodiode can be processed from the
solution through printing technology, so that the sensor itself can be easily integrated into a
single chip. The sensitivity of the optical sensor can be enhanced by extending the optical path.
On the other hand, by simply depositing a gold layer, the device concept can be used for a
surface plasmon resonance, which can improve the LOD even further71. Lear et al. reported an
organic nanofilm based on optical waveguide biosensors (Fig. 4 (c)). The evanescent field is
coupled to an integrated detector array that is buried beneath the waveguide. Toward the
addition of nanofilm on the surface of the waveguide, the optical sensor exhibits a sensitivity
of 20% modulation per nm. The device is capable of sensing multiple analytes

11

simultaneously72. Another interesting approach have been introduced by Shi et al. They
reported a variety of analytes with integrated fluorescence based on multi-channel sensors (see
Fig. 4d). A broad linear response range was measured; 0.36 µg/L to 2.50 µg/L with a LOD of
0.21 µg/L is reported. This idea provides a method for measuring MC-LR in actual water
samples73.

Fig 4. (a) Schematic of a waveguide-based biosensor facilitated through biorecognition element attached on
its surface to bond with COVID-19 molecule. (b) Side view scheme of an optical sensor. This device provides
an easy method to couple light into the planar waveguide free from prisms or gratings. The entire sensor can be
fabricated by inkjet or screen-printing techniques71. (c) (left) Schematic view of the array coupled biosensing
device working based on the field localization redistribution which happens when a waveguide cross-section

(top-left) Photographic image of light propagation along the waveguide-based sensor and (bottom-left) A crosssectional view of the waveguide-based sensing, isolation layer and location of the surface chemistry (right) Using
anti-MC-LR monoclonal antibody (MC-LR-MAb, 8C10), a linear dynamic response range of 0.36 µg/L to 2.50
µg/L with a LOD of 0.21 µg/L is determined, crucial for measurement of MC-LR in real water samples73.

In order to maximize the sensitivity of the waveguide-based biosensor, the speed of
light can be reduced even further. For this reason, the group velocity of the input pulse can
be reduced by designing the photonic crystal structure 35. Photonic crystal waveguides slow
down the speed of light and introduce other enhancement factors, thereby enhancing
absorption-based sensing on the surface of the waveguide.

12

B. Integrated interferometer sensing
Integrated interferometer photonic is one of the most practical architectures for sensing
applications. It is based on splitting the input beam into two arms through a Y-junction, one
arm is completely retained as the reference arm, and the other arm contains the target. The
interaction of electromagnetic waves on the sensing arm will cause a phase difference with
respect to the reference arm, and recombination of the two beams in the output will cause
constructive or destructive interference, see Fig 5 (a).
Output intensity 𝐼𝑂𝑢𝑡 of the MZI is described as follows 34,74,75:
𝐼𝑂𝑢𝑡 = 𝐼𝑠𝑒𝑛 + 𝐼𝑟𝑒𝑓 + 2√𝐼𝑠𝑒𝑛 𝐼𝑟𝑒𝑓 cos (𝜑0 + Δ𝜑)

(4)

where 𝐼𝑟𝑒𝑓 and 𝐼𝑠𝑒𝑛 are light intensity in reference and sensing arms, 𝜑0 is initial phase
difference between two arms without external perturbation. The sensitivity of the MZI-based
sensor is related to the phase sensitivity relative to the length of the sensor arm:
∆𝜑

𝑆𝑝ℎ = ∆𝑛

𝑒𝑓𝑓 𝐿

(5)

In an imbalanced MZI, considering the phase matching condition, vis-a-vis the wavelength
sensitivity, we can approximate the phase sensitivity of the MZI-based sensor:
𝑆𝑝ℎ =

2𝜋 𝑆𝐹𝑆𝑅
∆𝜆

𝐿

(6)

where, ∆𝜆 is the free spectral range (FSR) and 𝑆𝐹𝑆𝑅 is the spectral sensitivity.
Chemical and biosensing via Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZI) have been widely
exploited76 and judicious design of imbalanced interferometers based on waveguides and
photonic crystal waveguides explored by a lot of research groups35,59,61. Fig. 5b shows an MZI
biosensor with a silicon nitride strip waveguide as the reference arm, and a silicon nitride slot
waveguide as the sensing arm. Park et.al76 designed a slot waveguide in the sensing arm to
maximize the overlap between light and target analyte (see Fig. 5c). They reported a wide range
of linear tests with concentrations ranging77 from 19 fM to 190 nM, R2 = 0.979177. The
asymmetry of the MZI array is used to detect miRNA in human urine samples, and its linear
fitting curve is R2 = 0.997. Pavesi et. al78 demonstrated detection of Aflatoxin M1
functionalized with antibody fragments. They demonstrated a volumetric sensitivity of 104
rad/RIU, leading to a LOD below 5 × 10-7RIU (see Fig. 5d).
As shown in Fig. 5e, Morthier et. al have shown a polymer based on a lateral bimodal
interferometer. They used two transverse modes in the waveguide to create the interferometer.
The overall sensitivity of the manufactured interferometer sensor with a sensing length of 5
13

mm is reported to be 316π rad/RIU, and the extinction ratio can reach 18 dB. This method is
promising for future commercial development. However, reliability of polymer needs to be
further studied. Figure 5g shows the schematic structure of a spatially resolved resonant
waveguide grating (RWG) for single cell detection. The sensor consists of (1) glass substrate,
(2) a grating part, and (3) a waveguide with high refractive index. Owing to total internal
reflection after the light guides in the waveguide, the light propagates out of the waveguide.
Note that the wavelength of the resonance is unique to the coupled light and is sensitive to the
local reflection index, which is proportional to the density of the target analyte in the
penetration depth of the biosensor. The mechanism of RWG device can be also considered in
the resonance-based biosensors. Figure 5 h,i illustrate a bimodal waveguide (BMW) sensor.
BMW sensor is a universal path interferometric device based on the principle of the evanescent
field detection. When we use it in mixture with a bio-recognition element it can directly detect
the analyte of interest. The bimodal waveguide supports two transverse modes at the center,
while single mode waveguide forms the input and output at the two sides of the bimodal
waveguide. Various reports have shown sensitivity up-to tens of part-per million (ppm) level
(Fig. 5h) for gas sensing as well as bio sensing (Fig. 5 f, i). Figure 5i, shows Si3N4 surface of
a BMW device used to enhance the performance of the biosensor. The propagation mode is
caused by the sudden increase of the waveguide core, which changes from single-mode
operation (150 nm) to double-peak operation (340 nm). Fundamental mode operation relies
more on the propagating wave at the core than the excited mode. Thus, both modes are affected
differently through their evanescent field leading to waveguide output interference because of
biorecognition event happening on the sensor area surface. This change can provide the
sensitivity of the system. Analogous platform with a laser-based bimodal waveguide
interferometer is proposed to detect the COVID-19 via changes in the sensor's evanescent light
field (Fig.5 f).

waveguide grating for single analyte detection. Due to the total internal reflection after the light guides in the
waveguide, the light propagates and reflects out of the waveguide. Wavelength of the resonance is proportional
to the coupled light and is highly sensitive to the local reflection index, which is directly related to the density of
the target analyte within the penetration depth of the biosensor. (h) Schematic of the nanoZIF-8-based BMW
sensor with the sensitivity level of tens of ppm, and (i) Interferometric mechanism of the BMW sensor. Further
enhancement of the sensitivity is expected by introducing the slow-light effect into BMW sensors.

C. Resonance shift sensing
Contrasted to waveguide-based sensors that rely on light wave absorption, resonant
displacement in functionalized microcavities provides a wide range of ultra-sensitive optical
biosensors79,80. The magnitude of binding is determined by De Feijter’s formula81 that relates
the absolute quantity of adsorbed molecules M with the change in the refractive index as:
𝑛

𝐴−
𝑀 = 𝑑𝐴 𝑑𝑛

𝑛𝑐

⁄𝑑𝑡

(7)

where dA is the thickness of the adsorbed layer, nA is the refractive index of adsorbed
molecules, nC is the refractive index of cover solution and dn/dc is the change in the refractive
index of molecules, which is proportional to the shift dλ in position of the resonance peak. The
size of the resonance wavelength shift is proportional to the number of adsorbed biomolecules,
thus providing a label-free method to quantitatively determine the target analyte.
1. Ring Resonators
Although high quality (Q) ring resonators can be achieved with a larger radius, the tradeoff between the Q and the free spectral range (FSR) limits the radius for a given FSR, which
should be large enough for effective recognition of the sensing signal from the adjacent
interference signals or for large scale on-chip multiplexing sensing applications. Wang et al.
82,83

proved through experiments that the Q-enhanced SWGMR was specially designed using

a trapezoidal silicon column (T-SWGMR)( Fig 6). According to the report, the SWGMR has a
Q of ~5600 even with a large radius of 15 μm, smaller radius provide much higher Q.
Contrasted with conventional rectangular silicon pillars comprised of SWGMRs (RSWGMRs), an asymmetric effective refractive index distribution is created, which can
significantly reduce bending loss and thus increase the Q of SWGMRs.
The experimental results show that the applicable Q value of T-SWGMR with a radius
of 5 μm is as high as 11,500, which is 4.6 times the Q value (about 2800) provided by RSWGMR with the same radius, indicating that the propagation loss is reduced by 81.4%. To
go one step further, Yan et al.84 proposed a T-SWGMR biosensor and demonstrated the unique
stable surface sensing characteristics through a demonstration of miRNA detection at a
concentration of 1 nm (Fig 6b)
In addition to utilizing the unique stable sensing characteristics of SWGMR and the
enhanced Q of T-SWGMR, Chang et al.

69

showed a pedestal T-SWGMR biosensor that

maximizes the mode volume overlap by implementing an asymmetric refractive index
16

distribution along the vertical direction on the silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform, thereby
further improving sensitivity( Fig 6.d). Both theoretic analysis and experimental proofs show
that the volume sensitivity and surface sensitivity have been significantly increased by 28.8%
and 1000 times, respectively. For streptavidin, a spectrometer with a resolution of 0.01 nm is
used, and its LOD is about 400 fM. Owing to imperfect manufacturing process, experimental
Q estimate of T-SWGMR with a radius of 10 μm and FSR of ~13 nm is 1800. The optimized
SWGMR with symmetric coupling demonstrated by Huang; et al. 85 estimated Q to be 9800.

2. Microtoroid
Microtoroids are resonators with a Q of >108 and a small mode volume which can be
fabricated on silicon using standard microelectronics techniques86. However, microtoroids
need to be strictly aligned with the tapered fiber waveguide to achieve high coupling and cannot
meet our needs for high-throughput multiplexing sensing. Vahala; et al.86 demonstrates the
possibility of detecting unlabeled single molecules and higher concentrations on a single
platform (Fig 7a, b). According to reports, the quality of performing planar lithography is about
1.83×108. The author reports that by using the IL-2 solution, the micro-ring sensor can provide
a dose response of 10-19M to 10-6 M and a working range of 5 aM to 1 µM. In another report
for a microtoroid with a diameter of 90 µm, authors reported87 that a measurement lifetime of
43 ns corresponds to an inherent quality factor of 1.25×108 (Fig 7c, d).

response of 10−19 M to 10−6 M and a working range of 5 aM to 1 µM.

3. Photonic Crystal
For micro-cavity photonics crystal (PhC) sensors, we mainly use 2d-PhC biosensors,
which have the advantages of design flexibility, compact size (surface area of about a few
square microns) and strong light interaction with the analyte of interest. As shown in Fig. 8 ab, Chen; et al. recently confirmed the work of practical pancreatic cancer detection by using
nanopore-assisted high-Q (22000) and high-S (112nm/RIU) L13 PhC cavities60. The detection
results show that a concentration of 8.8 femto-molar (0.334 pg/mL) pancreatic cancer
biomarker was successfully detected in patient plasma samples, which is 50 times more diluted
than conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). To go further, by designing
and developing multimode interference (MMI) separators47,62,64–66,88, high-throughput and
multiplexed biosensor arrays have been proposed and demonstrated, (Fig. 8 a, b47,64–66). The
integrated scheme and array method proposed and proven improve the multi-parameter and

18

multi-function detection capabilities of the sensor and can be used in practical diagnostic
applications.

Our team has extensively described the functionalization of silicon surfaces using
various probe biomarkers in past research47,

64-66

and their use in the detection of specific

conjugated biomarkers using our silicon photonic crystal microarray structure. Previously,
we demonstrated a multimode interference coupler architecture shown in Fig. 9a,b also
shows the series and parallel integration of 64 sensors on the silicon chip. Multiplexed
sensing with specificity of lung cancer cell line lysates were demonstrated. We have also
demonstrated experimentally that the silicon photonic crystal sensor chips can be fabricated
in a commercial foundry for high volume manufacturing. For COVID-19 testing, the silicon
chip manufacturing process and sensor functionalization process will be the same as before.

Label-free microarrays are particularly exciting because it simplifies biochemistry
significantly when probe-target binding conjugations can be studied without steric hindrance
associated with fluorescent or radioactive tags. In Fig. 10, we compare our photonic crystal
microarray approach with other research performed using photonic crystals (PCs) and show
that our microarray has the highest sensitivity to small changes in concentration. It summarizes
sensitivities and detection limits demonstrated in our system compared to other label-free
methods, including surface plasmon resonance (SPR), opto-fluidic ring resonators (OFRR),
ring resonator (RR) Pedestal SMGMR and photonic crystal (PC) devices, as function of sensing
area. Sensitivities of PC microcavity structures demonstrated at Omega Optics (OO) and
University of Texas (UT), Austin is indicated by UT/OO.

Our photonic crystal microcavity not only has high sensitivity and low detection limit,
but also can achieve dense integration of sensors due to its small geometric size. In Table 1
below, we compare our proposed PC microarray platform with commercially available benchtop systems for water monitoring such as inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, for metals), gas
chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-and GC-MS for organics) and ELISA (for all
analytes with bio-signatures). We compared the technical advantages of our proposed platform
with other platforms and showed that our platform can provide comparable sensitivity to
existing desktop systems, while also being portable.

III. PLASMONIC OPTICAL BIOSENSORS
A plasmon can be described as a collective oscillation of a free electron or a quantum of plasma
oscillation. Propagation of electromagnetic waves along the surface of a metallic surface or
surface plasmons (SP) can be understood as a strong interaction between conduction electrons
of the metallic surface and electromagnetic waves, which leads to resonance modes trapped on
the surface, also known as surface plasmon resonances (SPRs)31,44,45. SPR propagation along
the conductor surface produces a charge density distribution, which enhances the light matter
interaction on the nanoscale. Such enhancements, so called “hot spots”, occurred at the
interface between a dielectric and metallic surface offer the higher sensitivity for plasmonic
biosensors. Many types of optical biosensors based on plasmonic platforms have been studied
as fascinating candidates for biomedical and chemical sensors 28,29,46,103–113. The selectivity of
the plasmonic-based biosensor can be achieved by using immobilization of the various
bioreceptors; depending on the target analytes, specific bioreceptors can be selected to be
immobilized on the surface of the sensor and react or bind only to its counterparts. Based on
the device configurations, plasmonic biosensors can be divided into two groups, SPRs and
localized SPRs (LSPRs).
A. Surface plasmonic resonance (SPR) sensor
Fundamentally, when the phase matching condition between the incident light and the
SP wave guided along the metal/dielectric interface is reached, the incident light can be coupled
to the surface guided mode. Note that the resonance condition between the incident light and
22

the conductive electrons at the metal/dielectric interface with a fixed angle of incidence is only
achieved at a specific wavelength. The guided light will be absorbed by the conducting
electrons that resonates, which will significantly reduce the reflected light at that particular
wavelength. Therefore, once the target molecule is attached to the functionalized metal film,
the refractive index does change, causing a shift in the resonance wavelength. Consequently,
SPR angle alteration can be characterized as the main sensing mechanism. Several coupling
methods have been proposed, including a grating coupler, a waveguide coupler, and a prism
coupler, but the prism coupling method has been used as a standard configuration based on the
Kreichman configuration114. Figure 11. shows the schematic of the conventional SPR sensor
configuration.

Fig 11. The schematic illustrations of the standard SPR based biosensor configuration.

The wavevector of the evanescent field of the incident electromagnetic wave
propagating along the prism-metal interface is shown in the following equation115,116 :
𝑘𝑖𝑛 =

2𝜋
𝜆

𝑛𝑝 sin (𝜃)

(8)

where 𝑛𝑝 is the refractive index of the prism, 𝜆 is the wavelength of the incident light, 𝜃 is the
incident angle. The wavevector of the SP wave propagating along the metal/dielectric interface
is as below116,117 :
𝑘𝑆𝑃 =

𝜔
𝑐

𝑛 2𝑛 2

√𝑛 𝐷2 +𝑛𝑀 2
𝐷

𝑀

(9)

where 𝜔 is the angular frequency of the wave, c is the speed of light in vacuum, 𝑛𝑀 and 𝑛𝐷 are
the refractive indices of the metal and dielectric. As aforementioned, the resonance condition
is met when 𝑘𝑖𝑛 = 𝑘𝑆𝑃 , so we can calculate the SPR angle in the following equation:
23

𝜃𝑆𝑃𝑅 = 𝑠𝑖𝑛−1 (

1
𝑛𝑝

𝑛𝐷 2 𝑛𝑀 2

√

𝑛𝐷 2 +𝑛𝑀 2

)

(10)

The sensitivity of the SPR devices are determined by the resonance shift with respect to the
change of the refractive in the absence and presence of the target analyte 118–122:
Δ𝜆

S=Δ𝑛

(11)

where Δ𝜆 is the resonance wavelength shift and Δ𝑛 is the change of bulk refractive index
including the target analyte.
B. Localized SPR sensor
On the other hand, nanostructures in conductive thin films are among the essential
building

blocks of LSPR

plasmonic biosensors

(see

Fig.12).

These nanoscale

geometric/periodic lattice factors bring huge advantages over conventional SPR devices.
Contrasted with SPR occurring along the propagation surface, the attenuation length of the
local electromagnetic field is much shorter. These strict restrictions, with a shorter subwavelength structure, can achieve ultra-low mode volume resonance, making it sensitive to
environmental refractive index changes, which are particularly helpful for the detection of tiny
biological molecules. Also, an incident light can be directly coupled to SP wave on the
conductive structures without any external couplers, e.g., prism or gratings, which ameliorates
the complexity of the entire system and enables the sensor miniaturization123 and the
absorbance, transmittance, and reflectance-based sensing42,107–109,124–126.

Fig 12. The schematic illustration of the resonance wavelength shift sensing based LSPR sensor configuration.

Moreover, LSPRs can be utilized for various types of resonance modes and detection
methods,

including

surface-enhanced

spectroscopy

(SER)28,112,

photo-

luminescence/fluorescence50,111, and mid-infrared spectroscopy106, by tuning the resonance
24

wavelength for a specific light-matter interaction. Table 2 shows the comprehensive
comparison between the conventional SPR and LSRP biosensors.

Table 2. The comparison between SPR and LSPR sensors.

1. Resonance shift sensing
Figure 12 shows the basic configuration of the LSPR device based on the resonance
shift sensing. The metal nanostructure on the dielectric substrate is used as a resonator, and due
to the above-mentioned advantages, the sensitivity can be further improved compared with the
conventional SPR resonance shift device. The sensitivity and the figure of merit of LSPR
resonance shift sensors follows the same definition of SPR’s as in eq. (11). Another important
performance factor of resonance-based sensor is the quality factor (Q), which is defined as
127,128

:
𝜆

𝑜
𝑄 = 𝐹𝑊𝐻𝑀

(12)

where 𝜆𝑜 and FWHM are the wavelength and full-width half maximum of the resonance peak,
respectively. To enhance the sensing performance, a higher Q value is desirable because of the
reason that sharper peaks with high Q values are much easier to detect. Considering all these
factors, the inherent detection limit (ILOD) of the resonance displacement sensing device can
be defined as follows80,129 :
𝜆

𝑜
ILOD = 𝑄∙S

(13)

which indicates that both the higher sensitivity (S) and Q factor are required to minimize the
limit of detection of the sensors.

25

Although these so-called hot spots provide higher sensitivity for LSPR biosensors, their
performance is greatly limited due to the basic limiting factors of ohmic losses in metal
surfaces. In other words, compared to other photonic biosensors, the absorption loss in the
conductive nanocavity leads to a low Q value, so research has been conducted to achieve lowloss devices by using advanced materials or optimizing the geometry of metamaterials.
2. Plasmonic perfect absorber

Fig 13. The schematic illustration of LSPR perfect absorber-based sensor.

On the other hand, the concept of a plasma perfect absorber (PPA) sensor was
introduced to overcome this intrinsic limiting factor130–134. Figure 13 shows the typical
configuration of PPA sensor consists of periodically arranged metallic nano antennas
(metamaterial) on top and thin metallic ‘mirror’ layer on the bottom separated by dielectric
spacer132. The basic concept is to have a perfect absorbance at the operating wavelength and
make a ‘zero’ transmittance by maximizing the metamaterial losses; in other words, the losses
are served as an advantage in the PPA sensors. In this structure, most of the incident light at
the operating wavelength is absorbed by top nano antennas operating as a resonator through
impedance matching, and the metallic bottom layer act as a ‘mirror’ to eliminate the
transmittance. As a result, the reflectance of light can be characterized for sensing as in figure
13, and the figure of merit (FOM𝑃𝑃𝐴 ) is defined as below133 :
𝑑𝐼(𝜆𝑜 )/𝐼(𝜆𝑜 )

𝐹𝑂𝑀𝑃𝑃𝐴 =|

𝑑𝑛(𝜆𝑜 ).

|

(14)

where 𝑑𝐼(𝜆𝑜 )/𝐼(𝜆𝑜 ) is the relative intensity change of reflected light at a fixed resonance
wavelength 𝜆𝑜 , which is induced by a refractive index change 𝑑𝑛(𝜆𝑜 ).
26

Moreover, it has been shown that the perfect absorption (>99%) of incident light at
working wavelength can be remained over a wide incident angle and insensitive to the
polarization (TE/TM) of incident light133.
3. Surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy

Fig 14. The Intensity change of transmitted light based LSPR sensor; typically adapted for mid-infrared absorption
spectroscopy.

Another important detecting method using LSPR is surface-enhanced infrared
absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy. Based on the molecular absorption spectroscopy and the
fundamental vibrational-rotational transitions of chemical bonds in the wavelength of 3 - 20𝜇𝑚,
mid-infrared (MIR) absorption spectroscopy has been studied vigorously for the label-free
detection and identification of molecules in the optical sensor domain. Especially, unlike the
near infrared wavelength region, the molecular fingerprint region (700−1500 cm−1) in MIR
wavelengths contains many absorption bands related to bending and stretching of chemical
bonds (such as −C−C−, −C−O−, −C−N−, etc.) that allow the unique identification of
biomolecules with high sensitivity and specificity.
Amongst many types of optical based molecular absorption spectroscopy platforms,
SEIRA spectroscopy for LSPR devices has been shown its great promise for detecting thin
layer of surface-bound nano-molecules due to its tight confinement of surface plasmons on
metallic nanostructures, which can significantly enhance the IR absorption of small molecules.
Figure 14 shows the typical configuration of SEIRA spectroscopy using LSPR sensor. When
the plasmonic resonance peak generated by the metallic nano-antennas is matched with the
fundamental vibration signatures of chemical bonds in the biomolecules, the coupling of
molecular transitions with the LSPR field on the surface makes significant absorption of
27

corresponding wavelength, so the decrease of transmitted light can be characterized as a
sensing result. To obtain more intense IR absorbance, researches have shown various
nanostructures including nanorod antenna 135, coaxial-nanogaps136, and nano cavities137–139 to
enhance the optical confinement and field enhancement of MIR light.
Taking all these device structures and detection methods into account, a number of
nanostructure designs have been studied and optimized to apply the plasmonic resonance
sensor for the label-free real time detection of various bio-analytes. As shown in Fig. 15a, Lee
et al. have shown a multiplex biosensor for cancer biomarkers detection based on the resonance
shift of LSPR single gold nanoparticles; the selective sensing results with LOD of 91 fM, 94
fM and 10fM for the α-fetoprotein (AFP), carcino embryonic antigen (CEA) and prostate
specific antigen (PSA) analytes are reported by antibody-antigen binding42. Amanda et al.
reported the detection of Alzhimer disease biomarkers from clinical samples as shown in Fig.
15b; Using surface-confined Ag nanoparticles and sandwich assay, the LOD of < 100 fM for
amyloid-â derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs) detection with the specific anti-ADDL
antibodies is reported by LSPR induced wavelength shift 109. To increase the refractive index
sensing of LSPR, plasmonic gold mushroom arrays were introduced approaching the
theoretical limit of standard SPR configuration with gold surface by Yang et al.; Fig. 15c shows
the schematic structure and SEM images of gold mushroom arrays with the detection result of
cytochrome c and alpha-fetoprotein, with their LOD down to 200 pM and 15 ng/mL,
respectively140. Pengyu et al. reported the multiplex serum cytokine analysis by immunoassay
enhanced using nano-plasmonic biosensor microarrays (Fig. 15d). Periodically arranged gold
nanorod microarray conjugated with corresponding antibodies of each cytokine species (IL-2,
IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-γ, and TNF-R) results in LOD of 5-20 pg/mL from a 1 μL serum sample
within 40 min124. The hemagglutinin (HA) proteins derived from avian influenza virus
detection using SPR device was also reported from Emi et al., with 3.125 nM LOD as shown
in Fig. 15e141. Recently, Daehan et al. reported the SEIRA spectroscopy using an array of
coaxial nano-apertures resonators reported a strong IR absorption enhancement factor of
104 ~105 , and observed ~58 % suppressing of transmitted IR signals from 5nm thick silk
protein film as shown in Fig. 15f 136. Infrared PPA sensor has been reported as in Fig. 15g; Na
et al. reported experimental demonstration of Infrared PPA sensor with 99% absorbance at the
wavelength of 1.6 𝜇𝑚, and 𝐹𝑂𝑀𝑃𝑃𝐴 (eq. (15)) of 87, and 400 nm/RIU sensing sensitivity from
glucose solution133.Intgeration of graphene with SPR sensor as reported by Shuwen et al. have
shown an ultrasensitive sensing (Fig. 15i); they reported the LOD of 1 aM for 7.3 kDa 24-mer
28

single-stranded DNA142. Moreover, ultrasensitive SPR sensor based on halloysite nanotubes
(HNTs)/MoS2/black phosphorous(BP) atomic layers on gold films have been introduced by
Guang et al., with the angular and phase detection sensitivities up to SA = 77.1 RIU-1 and SP =
1.61×105 RIU-1, respectively143.

4. SARS-CoV-2 sensing Application
Here, we review the most up-to-date advances, especially for the coronavirus sensors
in plasmonic domain, and introduce well-established plasmonic SARS-CoV-2 biosensing
systems. Researchers have demonstrated that using SPR/LSPR-based sensors and
corresponding binding biological receptors can effectively and selectively detect
coronavirus103,105,113 (Table 3). Moreover, several researches have already reported SARSCoV-2 sensing results as in figure 16 29,126.
Table 3. Summary of applications of various plasmonic biosensors for Coronavirus family.

configuration, coated with a peptide monolayer to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and the graphs show the
sensor-gram and SPR sensing results with the limit of detection value of 100 ng 𝑚𝐿−1 ; Reprinted from126.

A recent article reported the dual-functional plasmonic photothermal biosensors for
SARS-CoV-2 detection29. The authors demonstrated a highly sensitive, fast, and reliable
SARS-CoV-2 virus detection capability by integrating the plasmonic photothermal (PPT)
effect and conventional LSPR sensing transduction on a single gold nanoislands (AuNI) chip.
The two-dimensional AuNIs functionalized with cDNA receptors (RdRp-COVID-C) can
perform a selective detection of the RdRp-COVID through DNA hybridization, and the LOD
down to the concentration of 0.22 pM is reported. Lately, Djaileb et al reported the antibody
detection specific against SARS-CoV-2 in undiluted human serum using SPR sensing126. A
SPR sensor coated with a peptide monolayer detected anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the
nanomolar range (LOD of 100 ng 𝑚𝐿−1 ) was performed and analyzed within 15 minutes.
Furthermore, several researches reported that the sensitivity and the signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) of conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or fluorescencelinked immunosorbent assays (FLISA) tests can be significantly improved by applying the
‘add-on’ plasmonic particles without altering their workflow50,103. As the ELISA test is widely
used for precise SARS-CoV-2 detection103, plasmon enhanced ELISA/FLISA tests can be
applied to COVID-19 sensing as well.
Although aforementioned SARS-CoV-2 sensing applications29,126 have shown great
performances of sensitive and selective sensing, a huge potential for more sensitive, accurate
and fast on-chip sensing with less complex system is still remained in LSPR biosensor domain.
For example, the sensing systems in Fig. 1629,126 require the prism coupler to couple the
incident light into SPR device with an accurate incident angle. It requires very sensitive
alignment of optical devices which makes the overall system complex and hard to be integrated
with sources and detectors. However, as described earlier in Table. 2, the incident light can be
coupled into LSPR sensors directly without the external couplers, and this normal-incident
angle can make the alignment easier, in turn mitigate the complexity of the system and make
the possibility of fully integrated on-chip sensing; moreover, due to the capability of sensor
miniaturization through LSPR nanostructures, label-free, real-time, and parallel detection with
multiple channels with high-specificity are achievable. Furthermore, improving the sensitivity
by applying advanced materials has incited a great interest for various optical biosensor
applications. For plasmonic biosensors, the ultrasensitive graphene and 2D material enhanced
SPR devices have been reported as shown in Fig. 16 (h) and (i)142,143, and the experimental
sensing result with LOD value approaching 1 atto M has been shown142,144. Accordingly, the
31

advanced material enhanced LSPR biosensors are anticipated to enable the possibility of highly
sensitive, accurate and fast point of care lab-on-a-chip integrated sensor with unprecedented
high sensitivity. The detailed discussion of emerging nanomaterials for optical biosensors are
described in section V.
IV. SARS-COV-2 BIOSENSOR: DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION
To develop an accurate estimate of COVID-19 biosensing functioning mechanism, a
simulation model need to be first designed. Here, in a proposed simulation model, COVID-19
is approximated to be a solid sphere core containing RNA covered with a membrane protein
with radiuses of r1 and r2, respectively (Fig. 17a)45. Thus, the effective RI of the virus is
calculated by taking a volume weighted sum of the two refractive indices:

n1V1
n2V2
n1 + n2 ( 3 − 1)
neff =
+
=
, r2 =  r1 ,
V1 +V2 V1 +V2
3

(x)

where n1 (V1) and n2 (V2) are the total RI of the RNA and the membrane protein volume,
respectively. As the RI of the virus is determined mainly by material composition rather than
its geometrical size, η is a constant value for the same kind of virions. (ηCOVID-19 =1.25 average
value of several measurements of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) pictures145). We
use the SWGR design to simultaneously take advantage of the enhanced binding surface and
strong light-substance interaction. As shown in Fig. 17 c and e, the energy mode is distributed
between the gratings as well. In order to further improve the SWG waveguide functioning in
the sub-wavelength range, the grating period Λ, the waveguide width w, and the fill factor are
designed to be 230nm, 1.23μm, and 0.5μm, respectively. For the SWGR, the radius R is set as
5μm with the corresponding FSR57 of 25nm at 1550nm. Here simulation system includes a
220nm-Silicon top-layer with a 3μm buried oxide (BOX) wafer and a liquid solution, with the
refractive index of nclad to be 1.3531. Adopting our previous designs features38,39, we optimized
a high-Q SWGRs by utilizing a trapezoidal (T) silicon pillars and reducing bending loss by
~50% compared to a conventional rectangular silicon pillar. We therefore set the SW
waveguide width to be 0.5µm (correlated to the fundamental mode of transverse electric (TE))
and studied the effect of the trapezoidal width. It is noted that to obtain the lowest bending loss
of the T-SWG waveguide, we employ the particle swarm method for the optimization process.
Three parameters (w, A1, A2) are optimized and are defined as the width, the tuning factor of
the outer and inner filling factor of the SWG, respectively (as shown in the inset figure of Fig.
17b). Considering the limitations of the design for fabrication, the slot between gratings are
pre-set to be larger than 60nm, thus A1 and A2 are limited to be (1, 2) and (0, (1-60nm/Λ)/f),
32

respectively. At the same time, to keep the SWG working in subwavelength regime (Λ<<
𝝀/2neff), Λ is safely set to be 230nm and f is simply set to be 0.5 with no optimization.
Furthermore, to make the SWG waveguide work as a single or few mode waveguide, the width
of the gratings is set less than 2μm. All in all, the ranges of w, A1, and A2 are set to be (0.5μm,
2μm), (1,2), and (0, 0.522), respectively. The FOM is defined to achieve the lowest bending
loss with the bend radius of 5μm. Based on the optimization measures taken, we finally
achieved a bending loss as low as 0.0279 dB/cm with the optimized (w, A1, A2) = (1.23µm, 1,
0.522). By adjusting the coupling gap between the insertion SWG waveguide and the designed
SWGR, the Q can be as high as ~50000 (the resonance at 1557.6nm) with a broad FSR of 25
nm, as shown in Fig. 17a. We also optimized the 10µm radius SWGR (not shown in the Fig.17f,
achieving a loaded Q of ~75000 (the resonance at 1552.1nm) with the FSR of 11nm with (w,
A1, A2) = (1.23µm, 1, 0.522), at the same waveguide-ring cross-coupling coefficients. Needless
to say as quality factor of the ring becomes higher, the fabrication tends to be more challenging.
Bulk RI sensitivity (shown in the Fig.11f inset figure) in the buffer solution is calculated to be
𝛥𝜆

𝑆𝑟𝑒𝑠 = 𝛥𝑛 𝑟𝑒𝑠 = 400 𝑛𝑚/𝑅𝐼𝑈. Thus the iDL can be calculated as low as ~7.5e-5 RIU. Note that
𝑐𝑙𝑎𝑑

iDL performances can be further improved by exploiting a larger radius ring or by further
achieving the critical coupling condition given the predictable higher Q, while making tradeoff between the performance and the sensor size or the resonance peak extinction ratio.
Surface sensing: To evaluate the specific sensing ability of the proposed device for COVID19, surface sensing performances are analysed by considering the device immersed in buffer
solution, bonded by several surface layers (generated in the sensing preparation process)
including the ~2-3nm surface oxide layer, ~10nm functionalization layer and bonded antibody
(protein layers), and the bonded virus particles layer in detection process. In simulations, the
preparation process generated layers are further simplified to be a uniform layer (RI: 1.45) with
a thickness of 15nm, and the bonded virus layer is simplified as a uniform layer with a thickness
of 125nm (the maximum diameter of the COVID-19 virus) (Fig. 17a). It is noted that the
equivalent RI of the virus layer (nbinding) depends on the number of bonded virus, which is a
function of the virus concentration and binding processing time, and is dominated by the
concentration in real sensing process with a given binding time. Thus, the SWGR sensing
performance can be evaluated by calculating the nbinding response of the device, with the nbinding
ranging from 1.35 (no binding) to 1.5 (full binding). Simulation results in Fig.17f shows the
functionalization and the full binding process induces a shift of 3.41nm and 1.14, respectively.
The obvious simultaneous measurable shifts in the FSR range (𝛥𝜆𝑟𝑒𝑠 < 𝐹𝑆𝑅) and experimental
33

values (𝛥𝜆𝑟𝑒𝑠 ≫ 1𝑝𝑚) indicates the promising potentials of the proposed device in detecting
the COVID-19 virus or simply being as a chemical/bio-sensor in future practical applications.

V. TWO-DIMENSIONAL MATERIALS OPTICAL BIOSENSORS
Latest major advancements in preparation, development, and utilization of new lowdimensional materials has been attractive for development of modern miniaturized biosensors
and immunosensors. Graphene and its analogous 2D materials such as transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDCs), carbides and nitrides(Mxenes), hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN),
black phosphorus (BP) and transition metal oxides (TMOs) have attracted great attention to be
used as transducer due to combined high sensitivity and selectivity for biosensors.
A. Graphene and graphene oxide (Gr and GO)
Graphene has been regarded a revolutionary material ever-since its first introduction in
2004146, given its extraordinary optical and electronic properties 32,147–161. Since then, graphene
34

has also shown an immense potential in different applications and a great deal of graphene
based biomolecular sensors have been specifically developed by paying especial attention to
its biocompatibility and high specific surface area45,162–164 . On top of that, unique and ideal
optical properties such as broadband and tunable absorption and polarization-dependent
nonlinear optical effects make graphene a promising candidate to be employed for optical
based biosensors (Fig 18).

The introduction of advanced biosensors through graphene

electrical and optical qualities in general has delivered extraordinary sensitivity, detection
level, resolution and response time in many devices (Fig 18. c and d)32,106,151,152,154,163–167.
Point-of-Care biosensors has also shown enhanced sensitivity in graphene based
electrochemical biosensors as well168. While pristine graphene has seen applications in
biosensors devices, its derivative GO has been subjected to a wealth of investigation for
rapid detection, disinfection of pathogens and enzyme assays, making it a key material for
a variety of biomedical applications. Graphene oxide has been a suitable precursor for
graphene and its biosensors applications especially due to its attractive distinctive properties
like good water dispersibility, facile surface modification and to be more specific photoluminescence for optical biosensors. Jin et al demonstrated a functionalized graphene oxide
wrapped around SiO2 which possess superior RNA sensitivity and limit of detection up to 1
fM with the potential to show even higher sensitivity values169. They showed the high electron
conduction and higher surface area in spherical morphology has been specially effective to
improve the sensitivity and limit of detection169. Graphene unique electrical properties has also
been exploited effectively to develop different transistor based label-free biosensors including
COVID-19 detection system39 (fig 18.a). Aside from the field-effect-transistor-based graphene
biosensor, which relies mainly on current changes, providing easier mass-scale production with
satisfying sensitivity, it’s limited sensing capability along with being damaging to living cells
make its application limited compared to analogous optical ones170 [Table 3].

functionalization with CSAb vs non-functionalized graphene on increasing sensitivity to COVID-19

close proximity to each other for forming the plasmonic slot waveguide d) Measured responsivity vs bias
voltage of graphene photodetector. Inset shows a broadband responsivity from 1300 to 1400 nm. The spectral
response of the graphene-slot detector is mainly limited by the relatively narrow metallic grating coupler
operating bandwidth.

The interaction of graphene with light is a determining factor in effectiveness of
integrated graphene with different photonic and optoelectronic devices including
biosensors; a high-quality graphene-based biosensor requires a strong interaction between
graphene and light. An undoped graphene monolayer has a constant broadband absorption
equal to %2.3171. It has been shown that the Fermi level of graphene can be tuned by either
electrical or chemical dopant beyond half of the photon energy156,172,173 (Fig 18) which is
critical for sensitivity enhancement in a graphene based label-free biosensor. This happens
as a result of graphene becoming transparent due to Pauli blocking effect. This in turn leads
to significant refractive index change (RI) and phase shift of the input light. High
nonlinearity in graphene opens the door to a broad range of graphene based nonlinear
plasmonic sensor applications 174.

B. Graphene Surface Plasmon Resonance
Researchers have investigated plentiful ways of enhancing the sensitivity of the SPR
sensor, including but not limited to the use of resonant structures such as metal nanoparticles
and optical gratings. As shown before, in a typical SPR or LSPR biosensor, a thin metallic
film like Ag or Au gets deposited on prism to separate it from the sensing area. The deposited
metallic film brings out the propagation of surface plasmon at visible light frequency. Gold
is preferred as it provides better resistance to oxidation and corrosion in different
environments. The intrinsic defects in gold and silver-based biosensors like oxidization of
metal, poor adsorption to biomolecules and hence limited sensitivity and accuracy leads
researchers to seek methods of alternatives. In view of the defects of biosensors based on
gold and silver film, graphene-based biosensor has been developed. Graphene provides a
highly sensitive non-oxidizing receptor substrate to analytes 152,166,175. Moreover, graphene
also helps to adsorb biomolecules better, because of π-π stacking, which increases the
system’s affinity for these molecules (Fig 19)

Schematic of a SPR biosensor functioning mechanism(Reprinted 44).

37

The graphene plasmonic nano-islands can demonstrate nonlinearities two orders of
magnitude higher than the their non-graphene counterparts of equal size 174. These nanoislands can be used as nonlinear plasmonic biosensors, as the presence of an individual
molecule is sufficient to trigger a large change in the nonlinear response of the graphene
plasmons. The effect of functionalization on the sensitivity enhancement of graphene and
using it especially for biosensors have been discussed in detail 29,176–179.
C. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs)
Transition metal dichalcogenides(TMDs) are a class of materials including but not limited
to MoS2, MoTe2 and TiNb. Bulk crystals of TMDs have been long known to researchers
throughout the world but the new discoveries in isolation of their two-dimensional(2D)
structures has led to a plethora of new properties Unique physical and chemical properties
of 2D TMDs including high surface to volume ratio, sizable bandgap and high absorption
coefficient along with high potential for redox reactions on its surface m akes them capable
of superior molecular sensitivity 180.
MoS2 has recently found widespread applications as a fluorescence probe in the detection
of various biological and environmental analytes. As discussed in the previous section,
MoS2 possesses good optical properties like fluorescence and have been utilized to design
various sensing devices. The possession of PL characteristics provides the possibility of
using such structures in fluorescence-based applications, which can be used to trace, image,
and sense biological components. The Raman characteristics of the MoS2 monolayer is also
a function of the dimension and permittivity of the environment. Attaching biological
components may alter such characteristics and thus can be used as a biosensing principle.
VI. CONCLUSION
Emerging pandemics and epidemic diseases like COVID-19 brings out a high demand in
advancement and research in medical detection and treatment methods. The optical
biosensors provide a fast detection (< 1min) of such a virus at very low concentrations (~1
fM). However, they need to be designed and functionalized to be the most absorptive to the
target analyte. The ideal label-free biosensor is cheap, disposable, or reusable, compact,
and semi-automatic. Although most efforts in biosensors have been focused on protein
biomarkers, other targets such as small molecules and nucleic acids are crucial in expanding
the application of biosensors including optical ones. A common challenge for optical

38

biosensors is to reach the capability of performing the measurement in real complex
samples, avoiding, or limiting the sample preparation phase. Developing label -free
biosensor is aligned with that purpose as the need for on-site detection techniques is boosting
as the world post-COVID-19 pandemic will never be like before.
