Abstract
A recent work (DOI 10.1101/2020.05.06.20093310) indicated that temporarily splitting larger populations into smaller groups can efficiently mitigate the spread of SARSCoV-2 virus. The fact that, soon afterwards, on May 15, 2020, the two million people
Slovenia was the first European country proclaiming the end of COVID-19 epidemic
within national borders may be relevant from this perspective. Motivated by this evolution, in this paper we investigate the time dynamics of coronavirus cases in Slovenia
with emphasis on how efficient various containment measures act to diminish the number of COVID-19 infections. Noteworthily, the present analysis does not rely on any
speculative theoretical assumption; it is solely based on raw epidemiological data. Out
of the results presented here, the most important one is perhaps the finding that, while
imposing drastic curfews and travel restrictions reduce the infection rate κ by a factor of
four with respect to the unrestricted state, they only improve the κ-value by ∼ 15% as
compared to the much bearable state of social and economical life wherein (justifiable)
wearing face masks and social distancing rules are enforced/followed. Significantly for
behavioral and social science, our analysis of the time dependence κ = κ(t) may reveal

1

an interesting self-protection instinct of the population, which became manifest even
before the official lockdown enforcement.

Introduction

In the unprecedented difficulty created by the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, 1 mathematical modeling developed by epidemiologists over many decades 2–7 may make an important
contribution in helping politics to adopt adequate regulations to efficiently fight against the
spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus while mitigating negative economical and social consequences.
The latter aspect is of paramount importance 8 also because, if not adequately considered
by governments currently challenged to deciding possibly under dramatic circumstances and
formidable tight schedule, it can jeopardize the healthcare system itself. As an effort in this
direction, we drew recently attention 9 to the general fact that the spread of the SARS-CoV-2
virus in smaller groups can be substantially slowed down as compared to the case of larger
populations. In this vein, the time evolution of COVID-19 disease in the two million people
Slovenia certainly deserves special consideration, as on 15 May 2020, concluding that this
country has the best epidemic situation in Europe, Prime Minister Janez Janška declared
the end of the COVID-19 epidemic within Slovenian borders. 10 Subsequent developments
(only four new cases between 15 and 24 May, 11 cf. Table 1) have fortunately given further
support to this declaration. Attempting to understanding and learning from this sui generis
circumstance is the very aim of the present paper.
Thanks to long standing efforts extending over many decades, a rich arsenal of theoretical methods of analyzing epidemics exists. Most of them trace back to the celebrated
SIR model 2–7 wherein the time evolution of the numbers of individuals belonging to various
epidemiological classes (susceptible (S), infected (I), recovered (R), etc) classes is described
by deterministic differential equations. Unfortunately, those approaches need many input
parameters 12,13 that can often be reliably estimated only after epidemics ended, 14 which un-

2

avoidably compromises their ability of making predictions. As an aggravating circumstance,
one should also add the difficulty not encountered in the vast majority of previous studies:
how do the input parameters needed in model simulations change in time under so many
restrictive measures (wearing face masks, social distancing, movement restrictions, isolation
and quarantine policies, etc) unknown in the pre-COVID-19 era? Estimating model parameters from data fitting in a certain time interval to make predictions can easily run into a
difficulty like that described in the first paragraph of Section 2.3.
As shown below, our approach obviates the aforementioned difficulty. We will adopt a
logistic growth model in a form which is different from that often employed in the past 15–19
(see Sections 2.3 and 3 for technical details). This model is considerably simpler than SIR
flavors, and already turned out to be an appealing framework in dealing with current COVID19 pandemic issues. 9,13 Logistic functions (see equation (2) below) were utilized for studying
various problems. 20–25 Studies on population dynamics of epidemic populations 26–32 were
also frequently based on the logistic function.
Nevertheless, as anticipated, there is an important difference between the present approach (Section 2.3) and all the other approaches of which we are aware. The latter merely
justify the logistic model by the fact that recorded disease numbers followed a sigmoidal
curve. Shortcomings of this standpoint are delineated in the beginning of Section 2.3. The
strength of the approach presented in Section 2.3 is that we do not use data fitting. Rather,
we use raw epidemiological data to validate the logistic growth and straightforwardly extract
the time dependent infection rate, which is the relevant model parameter for the specific case
considered and makes it possible to compare how efficient different restrictive measures act
to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic, and even to get insight significant for behavioral and
social science.

Brief COVID-19 Timeline in Slovenia

Before proceeding with the data analysis let us briefly summarize relevant public heath
measures, social distancing and movement restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 crisis
in Slovenia. 11,33
The first case of coronavirus was confirmed on March 4, 2020, imported via a returnee
traveling from Morocco via Italy. 34 On 10 March, the government banned all incoming flights
from Italy, South Korea, Iran, and China; the land border with Italy was closed for all but
freight transport; indoor public with more than 100 persons were prohibited, sporting and
other events with more than 500 participants were allowed only without audience.
On 12 March, the nationwide COVID-19 epidemic was proclaimed in Slovenia. On 14
March the Crisis Management Staff of the Republic of Slovenia established by the new
government led by Prime Minister Janez Janša, confirmed on 13 March amidst the coronavirus outbreak, suspended unnecessary services. On 15 March all restaurants and bars
as well as the Ljubljana Zoo were closed. On 16 March educational institutions, including
kindergartens, primary and secondary schools were closed down, and public (bus, rail, air)
transport was stopped. On 18 March public services (libraries, museums, cinemas, galleries

5

were closed. On 19 March public gatherings were limited; gatherings in higher educational
institutions and universities were prohibited; border checks (temperature, certificates of being healthy) were introduced. On 20 March de facto quarantine was established in Slovenia.
Significant easing occurred starting from 20 April. Border crossing gradually reopened
(6, 22 and 24 April). Public transport resumed (27 April), some pupils returned to schools
(27 April), all bars and restaurants as well as small hotels (up to 30 rooms) reopened for
the first time since the shutdown was enforced in mid-March. On 30 April, the general
prohibition of movement was lifted.
Concluding that his country has the best epidemic situation in Europe, Prime Minister
Janez Janška declared on 15 May the end of the COVID-19 epidemic within Slovenian borders
and allowed EU citizens free entrance.

2.3

Logistic Model with Time Dependent Parameters

The (blue) curve of Figure 2a depicting the evolution of total COVID-19 infections in Slovenia
(underlying data are collected in Table 1) has an appealing similarity to the logistic S-shaped
curve depicted in Figure 1. One would be therefore tempting to follow numerous previous
authors, 26–32 who claimed that the logistic model applies merely because of the (apparently)
good data fitting.
Still, to claim that a description based on a model like that of equation (2) is valid,
checking that the model parameters do not depend on the fitting range (t1 , t2 ) is mandatory.
For the specific case considered here, this means that fitting numbers of infected individuals
in time range t1 < t < t2 should yield, within inherent statistical errors, values of N and
κ independent of t1 and t2 . And, like in other known cases, 35,36 this is just the stumbling
block for the logistic function approach delineated in Section 2.1. In particular, the infection
rate κ should not depend on how broad the is the range (t1 , t2 ); however, we checked by
straightforward numerical calculations that it does.
Given the real epidemic timeline delineated in Section 2.2, the infection rate must indeed
6

depend on time, κ = κ(t). If the contrary was true, all containment measures would be
useless. But when κ depends on t, equations (2) and (3) no longer apply; they were deduced
by integrating out equation (1) assuming a time-independent κ.
Fortunately, rather than merely inquiring how good the fitting curve based on equation (2) is, we are able to directly check (and demonstrate, see below) the validity of a
time-dependent logistic model merely based on the real epidemiological reports. To this aim,
we recast the differential equation (1), which is the basic definition of the logistic growth
(not to be confused with the logistic function of equation (2)), as follows

ṅ
n
=κ 1−
n
N

(4)

When put in this way, one can straightforwardly get insight in how to proceed. One
should plot the ratio of the daily new cases to the cumulative number of cases (numerator
and denominator in equation (4), respectively) as a function of the cumulative number of
cases and inspect whether the curve is linear or departs from linearity. Is the decrease linear
(like anticipated in the ideal simulation presented in Figure 1b), we have the demonstration
that the logistic growth model applies.
The curve constructed as described above using the COVID-19 epidemic reports for
Slovenia (Table 1, ref 11) is depicted in Figure 2a. As visible there, letting alone the strong
fluctuations (possibly also due to the different methodology of reporting cases 11 ) in the
initial stage, there is a transition from a high-κ regime to a low-κ regime. Definitely, the
COVID-19 restrictive measures worked. Interestingly (or, perhaps better, significantly), the
low-κ regime appears to set in on 17-18 March (n = 275 − 286), suggesting a population’s
prudent reaction even prior the official lockdown enforcement (20 March). This is even more
important given the fact that, in view of the finite incubation time (∼ 5 days), reported
cases pertain to infections that occurred earlier.
An overall linear trend is clearly visible in the low-κ regime of Figure 2a. Equation (4)

7

makes it then possible to estimate the carrying capacity N from point where the (extrapolated) straight line intersects the x-axis, while the intercept (or slope) can be used to deduce
the infection rate κ.
Noteworthily, the low-κ regime comprises two periods: lockdown and lockdown easing.
To quantify the differences between these two periods, we used equation (4) to analyze the
epidemiological data from 18 March to 20 April (78 ≤ t ≤ 111) and after 20 April (t > 111)
separately. We could not find any significant difference in N. With the value N = 1470
(to be compared with the cumulative number of cases 1468 on 24 May) in hands we have
computed via equation (4) the time dependence of infection rate

κ(t) =

ṅ(t)/n
1 − n(t)/N

(5)

A slight difference could thus be obtained (κL ≃ 0.122 day−1 versus κE ≃ 0.140 day−1 ),
leading to the schematic representation depicted in Figure 2b.
We used the piecewise linear approximation of Figure 2b for the time dependent infection
rate κ → κ(t) to numerically integrate the differential equation (1). Results of this numerical

Figure 2: (a) In the short initial phase of the epidemic, the number of infected individuals
growths exponentially in time, which allows to estimate the initial value of the infection
rate (κ = 0.464 day−1 . The curve of the logarithmic derivative d ln n(t)/dt = ṅ(t)/n(t)
(blue line in panel b), which is merely obtained from epidemiological reports without any
theoretical assumption, exhibits a linear trend that validates the description based on the
logistic model. The carrying capacity N(= 1470) is obtained from the intersection with
the x-axis. The curve of the time-dependent infection rate κ = κ(t) (blue line in panel c)
deduced by means of equation (5) suggests a piecewise linear approximation. Noteworthy,
the infection rate κE = 0.140 day−1 after lockdown easing is only slightly larger than the
value κL = 0.122 day−1 estimated for strict lockdown.

peak around t = 73 day−1 does not represent a spurious effect of fluctuations. It is a real
effect reproduced by numerical simulation (green curve), which nicely demonstrates how
restrictive measures enforced stopped the explosive (unrestricted) evolution depicted in red.
The orange curves depict results that could have been achieved if, instead of severe lockdown,
the much milder restrictions effective on 20 April were imposed starting 20 March.
In addition, we also show there simulations of how the Slovenian COVID-19 epidemic
would have evolved if:
(a) no restriction measure had been enforced. The (red) curves indicate that the result
could have been grim: 769 new infections in five days or 493 new cases in three days. Again,
restriction measures were definitely necessary.
(b) instead of severe lockdown, much more bearable restrictive measures as effective on
20 April would have been imposed on 20 March. The rather modest differences between the
orange and green curves suggest that, unless the healthcare system capacity is overwhelmed,
(justified) face masks and social distancing rules can be comparably efficient in mitigating
the SARS-CoV-2 virus spread with draconian lockdown while obviating paralyzing economic
and social life. From this perspective, the “German model” appears to have an efficiency
comparable to that of the “Italian model”.

Conclusion

We believe that especially the two results shown in Figure 2b — solely based on epidemiologically reported data without any extra (possibly speculative) theoretical supposition — are
of extreme practical importance, as they could help setting adequate policies in the difficult
period of the current COVID-19 pandemic:
(i) Regarding the infection rate, it is worth emphasizing that, while substantially smaller
than without imposing restrictions (κ = 0.464 day−1 ), the value κL = 0.122 day−1 during
shutdown is only very slightly smaller than the value κE = 0.140 day−1 . after easing measures effective on 20 April. The important message conveyed by this finding is that the
efficiency of hardly bearable unselective quarantine and remain-isolated-at-home measures is
very questionable. As one can intuitively expect, and what the present estimates do quantify,
is that what really matters is not to keep everyone at home (“Italian approach”) but rather to
impede virus transmission (“German approach”), e.g., by wearing masks, adequate hygiene,
and social distancing. Infection transmission does not strongly increase upon easing as long
as face masks and social distancing prevent SARS-CoV-2 virus spreading. One should add
at this point — an important fact that appears to be currently inadequately understand —
that, along with a less pleasant effect of a short-term slight increase of the daily new cases,
a moderate increase in the infection rate also has a positive impact. It reduces epidemic
duration; compare the right tail the green and orange curves in Figure 3b.
(ii) The fact that the carrying capacity N does not change upon lockdown easing is
equally important. This is the maximum number of individuals that can be infected in
a given environment. Rephrasing, the maximum number of infected individuals does not
increase when the lockdown is released; the total carrying capacity of a given environment
does not change.
From a methodological perspective, one should emphasize the important technical strength
of the approach proposed above, which made it possible to arrive at the aforementioned
conclusions. It is only the differential form, equation (1), of logistic growth employed that
10

obviates the need for any additional theoretical assumption. The traditional approach of validating the logistic model by blind data fitting using its integral counterpart, equation (2),
does not work for COVID-19 pandemic applications because the model parameter κ can and
does depend on time. This time dependence κ = κ(t) is essential to properly assess and
make recommendations on the efficiency of the restriction measures to be enforced against
SARS-CoV-2 virus spread.
And just because, in its differential form utilized here, the logistic model merely requires
directly “measurable” epidemiological quantities (daily reports ṅ(t) and cumulative number
of cases n(t), cf. equation (1)) makes in the present unsusual situation this model an alternative preferable to other more elaborate SIR-based flavors. The latter models contain a series
of quantities that cannot be directly accessed “experimentally”. Governments confronted
to taking decisions under unprecedented time pressure cannot await confirmation of often
speculative theoretical hypotheses needed in data processing.
Before ending, let us also note that monitoring the κ(t)-timeline allowed us to get insight
also relevant for behavioral and social science; the self-protection instinct of the population
became manifest even before the official lockdown enforcement (cf. Section 2.3).
