Abstract
An outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus is ongoing from December 2019. As of July 22, 2020, it has caused an epidemic outbreak with more than 15
million confirmed infections and above 6 hundred thousand reported deaths worldwide.
During this period of an epidemic when human-to-human transmission is established and
reported cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are rising worldwide, investigation of control strategies and forecasting are necessary for health care planning. In this
study, we propose and analyze a compartmental epidemic model of COVID-19 to predict
and control the outbreak. The basic reproduction number and control reproduction number are calculated analytically. A detailed stability analysis of the model is performed
to observe the dynamics of the system. We calibrated the proposed model to fit daily
data from the United Kingdom (UK) where the situation is still alarming. Our findings
suggest that independent self-sustaining human-to-human spread (R0 > 1, Rc > 1) is
already present. Short-term predictions show that the decreasing trend of new COVID19 cases is well captured by the model. Further, we found that effective management
of quarantined individuals is more effective than management of isolated individuals to
reduce the disease burden. Thus, if limited resources are available, then investing on the
quarantined individuals will be more fruitful in terms of reduction of cases.

1. Introduction
In December 2019, an outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, was first
noted in Wuhan, Central China [1]. The outbreak was declared a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020 by WHO. Coronaviruses belong to

the Coronaviridae family and widely distributed in humans and other mammals [29].
The virus is responsible for a range of symptoms including dry cough, fever, fatigue,
breathing difficulty, and bilateral lung infiltration in severe cases, similar to those caused
by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections [29; 25]. Many people may experience nonbreathing symptoms including nausea, vomiting and diarrhea [3]. Some patients have
reported radiographic changes in their ground-glass lungs; normal or lower than average
white blood cell lymphocyte, and platelet counts; hypoxaemia; and deranged liver and
renal function. Most of them were said to be geographically connected to the Huanan
seafood wholesale market, which was subsequently claimed by journalists to be selling
freshly slaughtered game animals [2]. The Chinese health authority said the patients
initially tested negative for common respiratory viruses and bacteria but subsequently
tested positive for a novel coronavirus (nCoV) [15]. In contrast to the initial findings
[16], the 2019-nCoV virus spreads from person to person as confirmed in [15]. It has
become an epidemic outbreak with more than 15 million confirmed infections and above
6 hundred thousand deaths worldwide as of 22 July 2020. The current epidemic outbreak
result in 2,85,768 confirmed cases and 44,236 deaths in the UK [4]. Since first discovery and identification of coronavirus in 1965, three major outbreaks occurred, caused by
emerging, highly pathogenic coronaviruses, namely the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in mainland China [26; 36], the 2012 outbreak of Middle
East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in Saudi Arabia [22; 41], and the 2015 outbreak
of MERS in South Korea [20; 32]. These outbreaks resulted in SARS and MERS cases
confirmed by more than 8000 and 2200, respectively [34]. The COVID-19 is caused by a
new genetically similar corona virus to the viruses that cause SARS and MERS. Despite a
relatively lower death rate compared to SARS and MERS, the COVID-19 spreads rapidly
and infects more people than the SARS and MERS outbreaks. In spite of strict intervention measures implemented in the region where the infection originated, the infection
spread locally in Wuhan, in China and around the globally.
On 31 January 2020, the UK reported the first confirmed case of acute respiratory
infection due to corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and initially responded to the
spread of infection by quarantining at-risk individuals. As of 28 June 2020, there were
3,12,654 confirmed cases and 43,730 confirmed cases deaths, the world’s second highest
per capita death rate among the major nations [4]. Within the hospitals the infection rate
is higher than in the population. In March 23, the UK government implemented a lockdown and declared that everyone should start social distancing immediately, suggesting
that contact with others will be avoided as far as possible. Entire households should also
quarantine themselves for 14 days if anyone has a symptom of COVID-19, and anyone
at high risk of serious illness should isolate themselves for 12 weeks, including pregnant
women, people over 70 and those with other health conditions. The country is literally

2

at a standstill and the disease has seriously impacted the economy and the livelihood of
the people.
As the 2019 coronavirus disease outbreak (COVID-19) is expanding rapidly in UK,
real-time analyzes of epidemiological data are required to increase situational awareness
and inform interventions. Earlier, in the first few weeks of an outbreak, real-time analysis
shed light on the severity, transmissibility, and natural history of an emerging pathogen,
such as SARS, the 2009 influenza pandemic, and Ebola [17; 18; 24; 37]. Analysis of
detailed patient line lists is especially useful for inferring key epidemiological parameters,
such as infectious and incubation periods, and delays between infection and detection,
isolation and case reporting [17; 18]. However, official patient’s health data seldom
become available to the public early in an outbreak, when the information is most required. In addition to medical and biological research, theoretical studies based on either
mathematical or statistical modeling may also play an important role throughout this
anti-epidemic fight in understanding the epidemic character traits of the outbreak, in
predicting the inflection point and end time, and in having to decide on the measures to
reduce the spread. To this end, many efforts have been made at the early stage to estimate key epidemic parameters and forecast future cases in which the statistical models
are mostly used [39; 35; 14]. An Imperial College London study group calculated that
4000 (95% CI: 1000-9700) cases had occurred in Wuhan with symptoms beginning on
January 18, 2020, and an estimated basic reproduction number was 2.6 (95% CI: 1.5-3.5)
using the number of cases transported from Wuhan to other countries [30]. Leung et al.
reached a similar finding, calculating the number of cases transported from Wuhan to
other major cities in China [6] and also suggesting the possibility for the spreading of
risk [10] for travel-related diseases. Mathematical modeling based on dynamic equations
[43; 42; 33; 8; 40; 11] may provide detailed mechanism for the disease dynamics. Several
studies were based on the UK COVID-19 situation [21; 19; 7; 31]. Davies et. al [21]
studied the potential impact of different control measures for mitigating the burden of
COVID-19 in the UK. They used a stochastic age-structured transmission model to explore a range of intervention scenarios. These studies has broadly suggested that control
measures could reduce the burden of COVID-19. However, there is a scope of comparing
popular intervention strategies namely, quarantine and isolation utilizing recent epidemic
data from the UK.
In this study, we aim to study the control strategies that can significantly reduce
the outbreak using a mathematical modeling framework. By mathematical analysis of
the proposed model we would like to explore transmission dynamics of the virus among
humans. Another goal is the short-term prediction of new COVID-19 cases in the UK.

2. Model formulation
General mathematical models for the spread of infectious diseases have been described
previously [38; 23; 28]. A compartmental differential equation model for COVID-19 is
formulated and analyzed. We adopt a variant that reflects some key epidemiological
properties of COVID-19. The model monitors the dynamics of seven sub-populations,
namely susceptible (S(t)), exposed (E(t)), quarantined (Q(t)), asymptomatic (A(t)),
symptomatic (I(t)), isolated (J(t)) and recovered (R(t)) individuals. The total population size is N(t) = S(t) + E(t) + Q(t) + A(t) + I(t) + J(t) + R(t). In this model,
quarantine refers to the separation of COVID-19 infected individuals from the general
population when the population are infected but not infectious, whereas isolation describes the separation of COVID-19 infected individuals when the population become
symptomatic infectious. Our model incorporates some demographic effects by assuming
a proportional natural death rate µ > 0 in each of the seven sub-populations of the
model. In addition, our model includes a net inflow of susceptible individuals into the
region at a rate Π per unit time. This parameter includes new births, immigration and
emigration. The flow diagram of the proposed model is displayed in Figure 1.

Susceptible population (S(t)):
By recruiting individuals into the region, the susceptible population is increased and
reduced by natural death. Also the susceptible population decreases after infection, acquired through interaction between a susceptible individual and an infected person who
may be quarantined, asymptomatic, symptomatic, or isolated. For these four groups
of infected individuals, the transmission coefficients are β, rQ β, rA β, and rJ β respectively. We consider the β as a transmission rate along with the modification factors
for quarantined rQ , asymptomatic rA and isolated rJ individuals. The interaction between infected individuals (quarantined, asymptomatic, symptomatic or isolated) and
susceptible is modelled in the form of total population without quarantined and isolated
individuals using standard mixing incidence [38; 23; 28]. The rate of change of the
susceptible population can be expressed by the following equation:
dS
S(βI + rQ βQ + rA βA + rJ βJ)
= Π−
− µS,
(2.1)
dt
N
Exposed population(E(t)):
Population who are exposed are infected individuals but not infectious for the community. The exposed population decreases with quarantine at a rate of γ1 , and become
asymptomatic and symptomatic at a rate k1 and natural death at a rate µ. Hence,

Figure 1: Compartmental flow diagram of the proposed model.

Quarantine population (Q(t)):
These are exposed individuals who are quarantined at a rate γ1 . For convenience, we
consider that all quarantined individuals are exposed who will begin to develop symptoms
and then transfer to the isolated class. Assuming that a certain portion of uninfected
individuals are also quarantined would be more plausible, but this would drastically complicate the model and require the introduction of many parameters and compartments.
In addition, the error caused by our simplification is to leave certain people in the susceptible population who are currently in quarantine and therefore make less contacts. The
population is reduced by growth of clinical symptom at a rate of k2 and transferred to
the isolated class. σ1 is the recovery rate of quarantine individuals and µ is the natural
death rate of human population. Thus,
dQ
= γ1 E − (k2 + σ1 + µ)Q
(2.3)
dt
Asymptomatic population(A(t)):
Asymptomatic individuals were exposed to the virus but clinical signs of COVID
have not yet developed. The exposed individuals become asymptomatic at a rate k1 by a
5

proportion p. The recovery rate of asymptomatic individuals is σ2 and the natural death
rate is µ. Thus,
dA
= pk1 E − (σ2 + µ)A
dt

(2.4)

Symptomatic population(I(t)):
The symptomatic individuals are produced by a proportion of (1 − p) of exposed
class after the exposer of clinical symptoms of COVID by exposed individuals. γ2 is the
isolation rate of the symptomatic individuals, σ3 is the recovery rate and natural death
at a rate µ. Thus,
dI
dt

= (1 − p)k1 E − (γ2 + σ3 + µ)I

(2.5)

Isolated population(J(t)):
The isolated individuals are those who have been developed by clinical symptoms and
been isolated at hospital. The isolated individuals are come from quarantined community
at a rate k2 and symptomatic group at a rate γ2 . The recovery rate of isolated individuals
is σ4 , disease induced death rate is δ and natural death rate is µ. Thus,
dJ
dt

= k2 Q + γ2 I − (δ + σ4 + µ)J

(2.6)

Recovered population(R(t)):
Quarantined, asymptomatic, symptomatic and isolated individuals recover from the
disease at rates σ1 , σ2 , σ3 and σ4 ; respectively, and this population is reduced by a natural
death rate µ. Thus,
dR
= σ1 Q + σ2 A + σ3 I + σ4 J − µR
dt

(2.7)

From the above considerations, the following system of ordinary differential equations
governs the dynamics of the system:

3. Mathematical analysis
3.1. Positivity and boundedness of the solution
This subsection is provided to prove the positivity and boundedness of solutions of
the system (2.8) with initial conditions (S(0), E(0), Q(0), A(0), I(0), J(0), R(0))T ∈ R7+ .
We first state the following lemma.
Lemma 3.1. Suppose Ω ⊂ R×Cn is open, fi ∈ C(Ω, R), i = 1, 2, 3, ..., n. If fi |xi(t)=0,Xt ∈Cn+0 ≥
0, Xt = (x1t , x2t , ....., x1n )T , i = 1, 2, 3, ...., n, then Cn+0 {φ = (φ1 , ....., φn ) : φ ∈ C([−τ, 0], Rn+0 )}
is the invariant domain of the following equations
dxi (t)
= fi (t, Xt ), t ≥ σ, i = 1, 2, 3, ..., n.
dt
where Rn+0 = {(x1 , ....xn ) : xi ≥ 0, i = 1, ...., n} [47].
Proposition 3.1. The system (2.8) is invariant in R7+ .
Proof. By re-writing the system (2.8) we have

Then it follows from the Lemma 3.1 that R7+ is an invariant set.
Proposition 3.2. The system (2.8) is bounded in the region
Ω = {(S, E, Q, A, I, J, R) ∈ R7+ |S + E + Q + A + I + J + R ≤

Proof. We observed from the system that

Hence the system (2.8) is bounded.
3.2. Diseases-free equilibrium and control reproduction number
The diseases-free equilibrium can be obtained for the system (2.8) by putting E =
0, Q = 0, A = 0, I = 0, J = 0, which is denoted by P10 = (S 0 , 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, R0), where
S0 =

Π 0
, R = 0.
µ

The control reproduction number, a central concept in the study of the spread of communicable diseases, is e the number of secondary infections caused by a single infective
in a population consisting essentially only of susceptibles with the control measures in
place (quarantined and isolated class) [45]. This dimensionless number is calculated at
the DFE by next generation operator method [46; 23] and it is denoted by Rc .
9

For this, we assemble the compartments which are infected from the system (2.8) and
decomposing the right hand side as F − V, where F is the transmission part, expressing
the the production of new infection, and the transition part is V, which describe the
change in state.

Theorem 3.1. The diseases free equilibrium(DFE) P10 = (S 0 , 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, R0) of the system (2.8) is locally asymptotically stable if Rc < 1 and unstable if Rc > 1.

Then G11 (0) + G12 (0) + G13 (0) + G14 (0) + G15 (0) = G1 (0) = Rc < 1, which implies
|G1 (λ)| ≤ 1.
Thus for Rc < 1, all the eigenvalues of the characteristics equation G1 (λ) = 1 has negative real
parts.
Therefore if Rc < 1, all eigenvalues are negative and hence DFE P10 is locally asymptotically
stable.
Now if we consider Rc > 1 i.e G1 (0) > 1, then
lim G1 (λ) = 0.

λ→∞

Then there exist λ∗1 > 0 such that G1 (λ∗1 ) = 1.
That means there exist positive eigenvalue λ∗1 > 0 of the Jacobian matrix.
Hence DFE P10 is unstable whenever Rc > 1.

Theorem 3.2. The diseases free equilibrium (DFE) P10 = (S 0 , 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, R0) is globally
asymptotically stable (GAS) for the system (2.8) if Rc < 1 and unstable if Rc > 1.
Proof. We rewrite the system (2.8) as
dX
= F (X, V )
dt
dV
= G(X, V ), G(X, 0) = 0
dt
where X = (S, R) ∈ R2 (the number of uninfected individuals compartments), V =
(E, Q, A, I, J) ∈ R5 (the number of infected individuals compartments), and P10 =
( Πµ , 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) is the DFE of the system (2.8). The global stability of the DFE is
guaranteed if the following two conditions are satisfied:
1. For

2. G(X, V ) = BV − G(X,

where B = DV G(X ∗ , 0) is a Metzler matrix and Ω is the positively invariant set with
respect to the model (2.8). Following Castillo-Chavez et al [12], we check for aforementioned conditions.

3.4. Existence and local stability of endemic equilibrium
In this section, the existence of the endemic equilibrium of the model (2.8) is established. Let us denote
m1 = γ1 + k1 + µ, m2 = k2 + σ1 + µ, m3 = σ2 + µ,
m4 = γ2 + σ3 + µ, m5 = δ + σ4 + µ.
Let P ∗ = (S ∗ , E ∗ , Q∗ , A∗ , I ∗ , J ∗ , R∗ ) represents any arbitrary endemic equilibrium point
(EEP) of the model (2.8). Further, define
β(I ∗ + rQ Q∗ + rA A∗ + rJ J ∗ )
N∗
It follows, by solving the equations in (2.8) at steady-state, that

Substituting the expression in (3.4) into (3.3) shows that the non-zero equilibrium of the
model (2.8) satisfy the following linear equation, in terms of η ∗ :
Aη ∗ + B = 0

(3.5)

where
A = µ[m2 m3 m4 m5 + γ1 m3 m4 m5 + pk1 m2 m4 m5 + (1 − p)k1 m2 m3 m5 + k2 γ1 m3 m4
+ (1 − p)k1 γ2 m2 m3 ] + σ1 γ1 m3 m4 m5 + σ2 pk1 m2 m4 m5 + (1 − p)k1 σ3 m2 m3 m5
+ σ4 k2 γ1 m3 m4 + (1 − p)σ4 γ2 k1 m2 m3
B = µm1 m2 m3 m4 m5 (1 − Rc )
Since A > 0, µ > 0, m1 > 0, m2 > 0, m3 > 0, m4 > 0 and m5 > 0, it is clear that
the model (2.8) has a unique endemic equilibrium point (EEP) whenever Rc > 1 and
no positive endemic equilibrium point whenever Rc < 1. This rules out the possibility
of the existence of equilibrium other than DFE whenever Rc < 1. Furthermore, it can
be shown that, the DFE P10 of the model (2.8) is globally asymptotically stable (GAS)
whenever Rc < 1.
From the above discussion we have concluded that
Theorem 3.3. The model (2.8) has a unique endemic (positive) equilibrium, given by
P ∗ , whenever Rc > 1 and has no endemic equilibrium for Rc ≤ 1.
Now we will prove the local stability of endemic equilibrium.
Theorem 3.4. The endemic equilibrium P ∗ is locally asymptotically stable if RC > 1.
Proof. Let x = (x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 , x6 , x7 )T = (S, E, Q, A, I, J, R)T . Thus, the model (2.8)
can be re-written in the form dx

Here, we use the central manifold theory method to determine the local stability
of the endemic equilibrium by taking β as bifurcation parameter [13]. Select β as the
bifurcation parameter and gives critical value of β at RC = 1 is given as

The Jacobian of (2.8) at β = β ∗ , denoted by JP10 |β=β ∗ has a right eigenvector (corresponding to the zero eigenvalue) given by w = (w1 , w2, w3 , w4 , w5 , w6 , w7 )T , where

in [13], a transcritical bifurcation occurs at RC = 1 and the unique endemic equilibrium
is locally asymptotically stable for RC > 1.
The transcritical bifurcation diagram is depicted in Fig. 2.

3.5. Threshold analysis
In this section the impact of quarantine and isolation is measured qualitatively on the
disease transmission dynamics. A threshold study of the parameters correlated with the
quarantine of exposed individuals γ1 and the isolation of the infected symptomatic individuals γ2 is performed by measuring the partial derivatives of the control reproduction
number Rc with respect to these parameters. We observe that

From the previous analysis it is obvious that if the relative infectiousness of quarantine
individuals rQ will not cross the threshold value rγ1 , then quarantining of exposed individuals results in reduction of the control reproduction number Rc and therefore reduction
17

of the disease burden. On the other side, if rQ > rγ1 , then the control reproduction
number Rc would rise due to the increase in the quarantine rate and thus the disease
burden will also rise and therefore the use of quarantine in this scenario is harmful. The
result is summarized in the following way:
Theorem 3.5. For the model (2.8), the use of quarantine of the exposed individuals will
have positive (negative) population-level impact if rQ < rγ1 (rQ > rγ1 ).
Similarly, measuring the partial derivatives of Rc with respect to the isolation parameter γ2 is used to determine the effect of isolation of infected symptomatic individuals.
Thus, we obtain
∂Rc
rJ β(1 − p)k1
rJ β(1 − p)k1 γ2

∂γ2

−
(γ1 + k1 + µ)(γ2 + σ3 + µ)2
Thus,
where

∂Rc
∂γ2

< 0 (> 0) iff rJ < rγ2 (rJ > rγ2 )

0 < rγ2 =

δ + σ4 + µ
σ3 + µ

The use of isolation of infected symptomatic individuals will also be effective in controlling
the disease in the population if the relative infectiousness of the isolated individuals rJ
does not cross the threshold rγ2 . The result is summarized below:
Theorem 3.6. For the model (2.8), the use of isolation of infected symptomatic individuals will have positive (negative) population-level impact if rJ < rγ2 (rJ > rγ2 ).
The control reproduction number Rc is a decreasing (non-decreasing) function of the
quarantine and isolation parameters γ1 and γ2 if the conditions rQ < rγ1 and rJ < rγ2 are
respectively satisfied. See figure 7(a) and 7(b) obtained from model simulation in which
the results correspond to the theoretical findings discussed.
3.6. Model without control and basic reproduction number
We consider the system in this section when there is no control mechanism, that is,
in the absence of quarantined and isolated classes. Setting γ1 = γ2 = 0 in the model

We will follow the convention that the basic reproduction number is defined in the absence
of control measure, denoted by R0 whereas we calculate the control reproduction number
when the control measure are in the place. The basic reproduction number R0 is defined
as the expected number of secondary infections produced by a single infected individual
in a fully susceptible population during his infectious period [9; 23; 28]. We calculate R0
in the same way as we calculate Rc by using next generation operator method [46]. Now
we calculate the jacobian of F and V at DFE P20

Following [27], R0 = ρ(F V −1 ), where ρ is the spectral radius of the next-generation
matrix (F V −1 ). Thus, from the model (3.7), we have the following expression for R0 :
R0 =

βk1 (1 − p)
rA βpk1
+
(k1 + µ)(σ2 + µ) (k1 + µ)(σ3 + µ)

Thus, R0 is Rc with γ1 = γ2 = 0.

(λ + k1 + µ)(λ + σ2 + µ) (λ + k1 + µ)(λ + σ3 + µ)

We rewrite G2 (λ) as G2 (λ) = G21 (λ) + G22 (λ)
Now if Re(λ) ≥ 0, λ = x + iy, then
rA βpk1
≤ G21 (x) ≤ G21 (0)
|λ + k1 + µ||λ + σ2 + µ|
βk1 (1 − p)
≤ G22 (x) ≤ G22 (0)
|G22 (λ)| ≤
|λ + k1 + µ||λ + σ3 + µ|
|G21 (λ)| ≤

Then G21 (0) + G22 (0) = G2 (0) = R0 < 1, which implies |G2 (λ)| ≤ 1.
Thus for R0 < 1, all the eigenvalues of the characteristics equation G2 (λ) = 1 has negative
real parts.
Therefore if R0 < 1, all eigenvalues are negative and hence DFE P20 is locally asymptotically stable.
Now if we consider R0 > 1 i.e G2 (0) > 1, then
lim G2 (λ) = 0.

λ→∞

Then there exist λ∗ > 0 such that G2 (λ∗ ) = 1.
That means there exist positive eigenvalue λ∗ > 0 of the Jacobian matrix.
Hence DFE P20 is unstable whenever R0 > 1.

Theorem 3.8. The diseases free equilibrium (DFE) P20 = (S 0 , 0, 0, 0, R0) is globally
asymptotically stable for the system (3.7) if R0 < 1 and unstable if R0 > 1.
Proof. We rewrite the system (3.7)as

where X = (S, R) ∈ R2 (the number of uninfected individuals compartments), V =

is the DFE of the system (3.7). The global stability of the DFE is guaranteed if the
following two conditions are satisfied:
1. For

where B = DV G1 (X ∗ , 0) is a Metzler matrix and Ω̂ is the positively invariant set with
respect to the model (3.7). Following Castillo-Chavez et al [12], we check for aforementioned conditions.

4. Model Calibration and epidemic potentials
We calibrated our model (2.8) to the daily new COVID-19 cases for the UK. Daily
COVID-19 cases are collected for the period 6 March, 2020 - 30 June, 2020 [4]. We divide
the 116 data points into training period and testing periods, viz., 6 March - 15 June and 16
June - 30 June respectively. We fit the model (2.8) to daily new isolated cases of COVID19 in the UK. Due to the highly transmissible virus, the notified cases are immediately
isolated, and therefore it is convenient to fit the isolated cases to reported data. Also we
fit the model (2.8) to cumulative isolated cases of COVID-19. We estimate the diseases
transmission rates by humans, β , quarantine rate of exposed individuals, γ1 , isolation rate
of infected individual, γ2 , rate at which quarantined individuals are isolated, k2 , recovery
rate from quarantined individuals, σ1 , recovery rate from asymptomatic individuals, σ2 ,
recovery rate from isolated individuals, σ4 , and initial population sizes. The COVID19 data are fitted using the optimization function ’fminsearchbnd’ (MATLAB, R2017a).
The estimated parameters are given in Table 1. We also estimate the initial conditions
of the human population and the estimated values are given by Table 2. The fitting of
the daily isolated COVID-19 cases in the UK are displayed in Figure 3.

Figure 3: (a) Model solutions fitted to daily new isolated COVID cases in the UK. (b) Model fitting
with cumulative COVID-19 cases in the UK. Observed data points are shown in black circle and the
solid red line depicts the model solutions.

Using these estimated parameters and the fixed parameters from Table 1, we calculate
the basic reproduction numbers (R0 ) and control reproduction numbers (Rc ) for the UK.
The values for R0 and Rc are found to be 2.7048 and 2.3380 respectively. Rc value is
above unity, which indicates that they should increase the control interventions to limit
future COVID-19 cases.
5. Short-term predictions
In this section, the short-term prediction capability of the model 2.8 is studied. Using
parameters form Tables 1 and 2, we simulate the newly isolated COVID-19 cases for the
period 16 June, 2020 - 30 June, 2020 to check the accuracy of the predictions. Next,

Figure 4: Short term predictions for the UK. The blue line represent the predicted new isolated COVID
cases while the solid dots are the actual cases.

We calculate two performance metrics, namely Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root
Mean Square Error (RMSE) to assess the accuracy of the predictions. This is defined
using a set of performance metrics as follows:

23

Mean Absolute Error (MAE):
Np
1 X
MAE =
|Y (i) − Ŷ (i)|
Np i=1

Root Mean Square Error (RMSE):
v
u
Np
u 1 X
t
(Y (i) − Ŷ (i))2
RMSE =
Np i=1
where Y (i) represent original cases, Y ˆ(i) are predicted values and Np represents the
sample size of the data. These performance metrics are found to be MAE=206.36 and
RMSE=253.72. We found that the model performs excellently in case of the UK. The
decreasing trend of newly isolated COVID-19 cases is also well captured by the model.
6. Control strategies
In order to get an overview of most influential parameters, we compute the normalized
sensitivity indices of the model parameters with respect to Rc . We have chosen parameters transmission rate between human population β, the control related parameters, γ1 ,
γ2 and k2 , the recovery rates from quarantine individuals σ1 , asymptomatic individuals
σ2 and isolated individuals σ4 and the effect of diseases induced mortality rate δ for sensitivity analysis. We compute normalized forward sensitivity indices of these parameters
with respect to the control reproduction number Rc . We use the parameters from Table 1
and Table 2. However, the mathematical definition of the normalized forward sensitivity
index of a variable m with respect to a parameter τ (where m depends explicitly on the
parameter τ ) is given as:
τ
Xm
=

∂m
τ
× .
∂τ
m

The sensitivity indices of Rc with respect to the parameters β, γ1 , γ2 , k2 , σ1 , σ2 , σ4
and δ are given by Table 3.

parameter σ2 by 1%, the value of Rc will be decrease by 0.4692% keeping the value of
other parameters fixed. Therefore, the transmission rate between susceptible humans and
COVID-19 infected humans is positively correlated and recovery rate from asymptomatic
class is negatively correlated with respect to control reproduction number respectively.
In addition, we draw the contour plots of Rc with respect to the parameters γ1 and
γ2 for the model (2.8) to investigate the effect of the control parameters on control
reproduction number Rc , see Figure 5.

Figure 5: Contour plots of Rc versus average days to quarantine (1/γ1 ) and isolation (1/γ2 ) for the
UK, (a) in the presence of both modification factors for quarantined (rQ ) and isolation (rJ ); (b) in the
presence of modification factors for isolation (rJ ) only; (c) in the presence of modification factors for
quarantined (rQ ) only and (d) in the absence of both modification factors for quarantined (rQ ) and
isolation (rJ ). All parameter values other than γ1 and γ2 are given in Table 1.

The contour plots of Figure 5 show the dependence of Rc on the quarantine rate γ1
and the isolation rate γ2 for the the UK. The axes of these plots are given as average
days from exposed to quarantine (1/γ1 ) and average days from starting of symptoms to
isolation (1/γ2). For both cases, the contours show that, increasing γ1 and γ2 reduces the
amount of control reproduction number Rc and, therefore, COVID cases. We find that
quarantine and isolation are not sufficient to control the outbreak (see Figure 5(a) and
5(c)). With these parameter values, as γ1 increases, Rc decreases and similarly, when γ2
increases, Rc decreases. But, in the both cases Rc > 1, and therefore the disease will
persist in the population (i.e. the above control measures cannot lead to effective control
of the epidemic). By contrast, our study shows that when the modification factor for
quarantine become zero (so that rQ = 0), the outbreak can be controlled (see Figure
25

5(b) and 5(d)). From the above finding it follows that neither the quarantine of exposed
individuals nor the isolation of symptomatic individuals will prevent the disease with the
high value of the modification factor for quarantine. This control can be obtained by a
significant reduction in COVID transmission during quarantine (that is reducing rQ ).
Furthermore, we study the effect of the parameters modification factor for quarantined
individuals (rQ ), modification factor for isolated individuals (rJ ) and transmission rate
(β) on the cumulative new isolated COVID-19 cases (Jcum) in the UK. The cumulative
number of isolated cases has been computed at day 100 (chosen arbitrarily). The effect
of controllable parameters on (Jcum ) are shown in Fig. 6.

Figure 6: Effect of controllable parameters γ1 , γ2 and β on the cumulative number of isolated COVID-19
cases. The left panel shows the variability of the Jcum with respect to γ11 and γ12 . The right panel shows
Jcum with decreasing transmission rate β.

We observe that all the three parameters have significant effect on the cumulative
outcome of the epidemic. From Fig. 6(a) it is clear that decrease in the modification
factor for quarantined and isolated individuals will significantly reduce the value of Jcum .
On the other hand Fig. 6(b) indicates, reduction in transmission rate will also slow down
the epidemic significantly. These results point out that all the three control measures
are quite effective in reduction of the COVID-19 cases in the UK. Thus, quarantine and
isolation efficacy should be increased by means of proper hygiene and personal protection by health care stuffs. Additionally, the transmission coefficient can be reduced by
avoiding contacts with suspected COVID-19 infected cases.
Furthermore, We numerically calculated the thresholds rγ1 and rγ2 for the UK. The
analytical expression of the thresholds are given in subsection (3.5). The effectiveness of
quarantine and isolation depends on the values of the modification parameters rQ and
rJ for the reduction of infected individuals. The threshold value of rQ corresponding to
quarantine parameter γ1 is rγ1 = 0.9548 and the threshold value of rJ corresponding to
isolation parameter γ2 is rγ2 = 0.9861.
From figure 7(a) it is clear that quarantine parameter γ1 has positive population-level
impact (Rc decreases with increase in γ1 ) for rQ < 0.9548 and have negative population
level impact for rQ > 0.9548. Similarly from the figure 7(b), it is clear that, isolation

0.9861. This result indicate that isolation and quarantine programs should run effective
so that the modification parameters remain below the above mentioned threshold.
7. Discussion
During the period of an epidemic when human-to-human transmission is established
and reported cases of COVID-19 are rising worldwide, forecasting is of utmost importance
for health care planning and control the virus with limited resource. In this study, we have
formulated and analyzed a compartmental epidemic model of COVID-19 to predict and
control the outbreak. The basic reproduction number and control reproduction number
are calculated for the proposed model. It is also shown that whenever R0 < 1, the DFE of
the model without control is globally asymptotically stable. The efficacy of quarantine of
exposed individuals and isolation of infected symptomatic individuals depends on the size
of the modification parameter to reduce the infectiousness of exposed (rQ ) and isolated
(rJ ) individuals. The usage of quarantine and isolation will have positive population-level
impact if rQ < rγ1 and rJ < rγ2 respectively. We calibrated the proposed model to fit
daily data from the UK. Using the parameter estimates, we then found the basic and
control reproduction numbers for the UK. Our findings suggest that independent selfsustaining human-to-human spread (R0 > 1, Rc > 1) is already present in the UK. The
estimates of control reproduction number indicate that sustained control interventions
are necessary to reduce the future COVID-19 cases. The health care agencies should
focus on successful implementation of control mechanisms to reduce the burden of the
disease.
The calibrated model then checked for short-term predictability. It is seen that the
model performs excellently (Fig. 4). The model predicted that the new cases in the
UK will show decreasing trend in the near future. However, if the control measures are
increased (or Rc is decreased below unity to ensure GAS of the DFE) and maintained
27

efficiently, the subsequent outbreaks can be controlled.
Having an estimate of the parameters and prediction results, we performed control
intervention related numerical experiments. Sensitivity analysis reveal that the transmission rate is positively correlated and quarantine and isolation rates negatively correlated
with respect to control reproduction number. This indicate that increasing quarantine
and isolation rates and decreasing transmission rate will decrease the control reproduction
number and consequently will reduce the disease burden.
While investigating the contour plots 5, we found that effective management of quarantined individuals is more effective than management of isolated individuals to reduce
the control reproduction number below unity. Thus if limited resources are available,
then investing on the quarantined individuals will be more fruitful in terms of reduction
of cases.
Finally, we studied the effect of modification factor for quarantined population, modification factor for isolated population and transmission rate on the newly infected symptomatic COVID-19 cases. Numerical results show that all the three control measures are
quite effective in reduction of the COVID-19 cases in the UK (Fig. 6). The threshold
analysis reinforce that the quarantine and isolation efficacy should be increased to reduce
the epidemic (Fig. 7). Thus, quarantine and isolation efficacy should be increased by
means of proper hygiene and personal protection by health care stuffs. Additionally, the
transmission coefficient can be reduced by avoiding contacts with suspected COVID-19
infected cases.
In summary, our study suggests that COVID-19 has a potential to be endemic for
quite a long period but it is controllable by social distancing measures and efficiency
in quarantine and isolation. Moreover, if limited resources are available, then investing
on the quarantined individuals will be more fruitful in terms of reduction of cases. The
ongoing control interventions should be adequately funded and monitored by the health
ministry. Health care officials should supply medications, protective masks and necessary
human resources in the affected areas.
