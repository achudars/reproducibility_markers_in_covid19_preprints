ABSTRACT
Tropical climates provoke adaptations in skin pigmentation and in mechanisms controlling the
volume, salt-content and pressure of body fluids. For many whose distant ancestors moved to
temperate climes, these adaptations proved harmful: pigmentation decreased by natural selection
and susceptibility to hypertension emerged. Now an added risk is lung inflammation from
coronavirus that may be furthered by innate immune differences. Hypertension and coronavirus
have in common angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which decreases blood pressure and
mediates virus entry. In keeping with less detailed studies, a long-term case-report shows that
decreased blood pressure induced by blocking a primary angiotensin receptor is supplemented,
above critical blocker dosage, by a further temperature-dependent fall, likely mediated by ACE2
and secondary angiotensin receptors. Temperature-dependence suggests a linkage with tropical
heritage and an influence of blockers on the progress of coronavirus infections. Positive
therapeutic results should result from negation of host pro-inflammatory effects mediated by the
primary angiotensin receptor and concomitant promotion of countervailing anti-inflammatory
effects mediated by ACE2 through other receptors. These effects may involve innate immune
system components (lectin complement pathway, NAD metabolome). Black vulnerability – more
likely based on physiological than on socioeconomic differences – provides an important clue
that may guide treatments.

1. Introduction
Humans whose distant ancestors lived in tropical regions can differ biochemically and
physiologically from those whose ancestors were in temperate regions. Increased sunlight and
heat engender not only evolutionary differences in skin color (Jablonski, 2002), but also in
cooling mechanisms that regulate the volume, salt-content and pressure of body fluids (Roman,
1986; Crandall and Wilson, 2015). This has influenced recommendations for treating
hypertension, a disease to which those with dark skins are prone (Rostand, 1997; Rostand et al.,
2016; Williams et al., 2016). To these major differences in responses to sunlight and heat, the
coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has added another – an increased mortality of those infected, often
from inflammatory complications of lung disease.
Thus, at an early stage of the present epidemic (April 12th 2020) the Chicago Department of
Public Health reported that, while the percentage mortality in other groups was around 4%, for
non-Latino blacks mortality was 22.7%. This extreme difference has been corroborated
elsewhere (Kendi, 2020; Li et al., 2020). Since those with pre-existing conditions are particularly
vulnerable, the higher mortality could be explained in terms of general ill-health or
socioeconomic factors (Burch, 2020). However, given the degree of the disparity, specific
differences in underlying physiology could play a role.
As a component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) (Jia, 2016), angiotensin II (Ang II) is
fundamental to the regulation of blood pressure (BP; Fig. 1). The degrees to which
countervailing Ang II receptors are activated could influence, not only BP, but also coronavirus
therapy. SARS-CoV-2 enters cells by way of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)
(Hoffman et al., 2020), which is generally protective for lung infections (Jia, 2016). Increased
ACE2 gene transcription occurs during SARS-CoV-2 infection (Butler et al., 2020;
Vaduganathan et al., 2020; Zhuang et al., 2020; Ziegler et al., 2020). Thus, there is a relationship
between coronavirus and a host’s physiological mechanisms for the control of the volume, saltcontent and pressure of body fluids. Such mechanisms should be most severely tested in hot
countries (e.g. sweating with loss of salt and water; Cappuccio and Miller, 2016). It would be
expected that, over evolutionary time, just as skin pigmentation became a fixed (non-inducible)
adaptation in hot countries, so the fine-tuning of cooling mechanisms by natural selection would
have resulted in stable, more extreme, adaptations than in temperate regions.

Fig. 1. Regulation of BP and inflammation by countervailing receptors in the renin-angiotensin
system (RAS). The vasoconstrictory/pro-inflammatory pathway (thick grey arrows) is impeded at
the level of the primary Ang II receptor by ARBs. Accumulated Ang II then drives the
vasodilatory/anti-inflammatory pathway. Having entered by way of ACE2, SARS-CoV-2 causes
lung inflammation that should be opposed by the ARB-induced arrest of pro-inflammatory
activity and stimulation of anti-inflammatory activity. The dashed arrow indicates an ARBdependent activation of the secondary Ang II receptor (Bosnyac et al., 2012). The fine dotted
arrow indicates the same result achieved by way of a β-arrestin pathway (Manglik et al., 2020).

5

However, being advantageous at one location at one point in time is not a guarantee of
permanence. Adaptations may further evolve in diaspora. Skin pigmentation proved
disadvantageous when populations moved to temperate climes and needed to synthesize vitamin
D. Pigmentation was decreased by natural selection, yet it could still be induced to return, albeit
at lower levels (tanning), in response to radiation (Jablonski, 2002). Likewise, cooling
mechanisms might prove counter-adaptive when challenged, either less severely by temperate
climates, or more severely by pathogenic microorganisms. A combination of the two challenges
could be fatal.
Knowledge that a RAS component, ACE2, was the SARS-CoV-2 receptor suggested that
existing drugs employed to treat hypertension might be repurposed, or modified, to treat
coronavirus infections. Indeed, reports from China state that angiotensin receptor blockers
(ARBs) can mitigate the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections (Liu et al., 2020). Their continued
in-hospital use is associated with lower mortality risk compared with non-users (Zhang et al.
2020b). My earlier study of a temperature-dependent hypersensitivity of BP to an ARB
(losartan), was interpreted in terms of a switch from primary to secondary countervailing
receptors (Forsdyke, 2015a). I argue here that this mechanism supports the views, both that
ARBs can mitigate the severity of acute inflammatory lung diseases whatever the etiology (Jia,
2016), and that, rather than “racism” (Kendi, 2020), there is a fundamental physiological
explanation for the high mortality of those whose distant ancestors lived in tropical regions.
A recent stepwise regression study has identified both African-American origin and
environmental temperature as significant variables, and has postulated a marginal vitamin D
deficiency to explain the enhanced vulnerability of African-Americans to coronavirus (Li et al.
2020). In contrast, my study, while also implicating temperature as a critical variable, has
suggested differential evolved responses to heat-stress that might be influenced by ARBs. This
has implications for control of SARS-CoV-2 infections in North America and for meeting the
growing threat in Africa.

2. Environmental temperature and response to ARBs

Following short-term studies to determine efficacy and minimize adverse side-effects,
losartan was introduced in the 1990s for the treatment of hypertension. A case report of its

6

employment by an elderly white male as sole medication over a 12-year period (2003-2014),
responded to calls for studies of possible long-term effects (Forsdyke, 2015a). There were also
accounts, some anecdotal, of seasonal hyperresponsiveness to antihypertensive medications
when environmental temperatures were high (Forsdyke, 2015a; Arakawa et al., 2019). For the
subject of the case report, doses had been adjusted daily with the goal of maintaining homemonitored BP readings (systolic/diastolic) close to 130/80 (mm Hg).

Fig. 2. Environment temperature and monthly losartan requirement for a 12-year period (2003–
2014). 2003, black triangles; 2004, dark yellow triangles; 2005, green circles; 2006, black
squares; 2007, blue diamonds; 2008, orange squares; 2009, grey triangles; 2010, red
diamonds; 2011, cyan circles; 2012, black circles; 2013, green diamonds; 2014, dark red
circles. Data for 2012–2014 include standard errors. [From Forsdyke 2015a; copyright DRF]

Fig. 2 shows that initially (2003-2010) this goal was consistently achieved with
approximately 20 mg losartan daily and no relationship to temperature was evident. Then in late
2011 a need emerged to increase dosage close to 50 mg daily. This had been hinted at by small
rises in December 2010 and early 2011. From this higher level, a marked and repeatable
summer-time dip emerged (2012-2014). This was clearly seen in plots of dosage against

7

temperature (Fig. 3). Indeed, when extrapolated, the plots indicated that no medication would be
needed above 34oC – a temperature range more consistent with tropical locations than that of the
subject (Canada). Since losartan was used world-wide, if not an individual idiosyncrasy then this
result had serious implications for the treatment of hypertension in equatorial regions (Imai and
Abe, 2013; Sagy et al., 2016).

corresponding maximum environmental temperatures. Least-squares regression fits to the
points (third order polynomial) are shown as continuous lines for each year. Line coloring for
different years follows that of Fig. 2. Consecutive r2 values for 2011–2014 were 0.22, 0.38, 0.34,
and 0.45. [From Forsdyke 2015a; copyright DRF]

8

Given that seasonal hyperresponsiveness to anti-hypertensive medications had been the
subject – albeit not documented in individual detail – of previous reports, it was hoped that the
possibility of individual idiosyncrasy would be discounted by further “crowd sourced” reports
(Forsdyke, 2015b). Unlike previous accounts that had not considered detailed mechanisms (e.g.
Arakawa et al. 2019; Zhao et al., 2019), it was proposed that the reported phenomena could be
explained in terms of differential signaling by countervailing Ang II receptors – inhibition of a
primary receptor that increased BP (vasoconstriction), and activation, at a critical ARB
concentration, of a secondary receptor that decreased BP (vasodilation) (Forsdyke, 2015a). The
view that these observations are relevant to current considerations of a role of ARBs in the
management of SARS-CoV-2 infections was encouraged by rapid developments in the
biomedical literature, as will be set out here.

It should be noted that there is generally little incentive for the pharmaceutical industry to
carry out sustained long-term studies; hence, the call for “crowd sourcing” (Forsdyke, 2015b).
Despite the absence of temperature effects during the first eight years (Figs. 2,3), fortuitously the
study was not terminated in 2010. With primary receptors for Ang II (AT1R subtype) blocked by
losartan, there should be an increase in the concentration of Ang II that could then suffice to
affect the losartan-insensitive, low abundance, secondary receptors (AT2R subtype). Reaction of
excess Ang II with the secondary receptors would greatly amplify the fall in BP resulting from
the losartan block of primary receptors (Fig. 1). An extensive literature based on both animal and
human studies was cited as consistent with this (Forsdyke, 2015a; Bosnyak et al., 2012).
A similar scenario would have the excess of Ang II (an octapeptide) converted by ACE2 to
Ang (1-7) (a septapeptide). This truncated Ang II fragment, either by way of another receptor
(MasR) (Ferrario et al., 2005; Santos et al., 2018), or by selectively influencing the AT1R subtype
(Manglik et al., 2020), also lowers BP. Whether acting individually or collectively, these
pathways should decrease BP. However, unexplained was the critical dependence on losartan
dosage and the relationship to high environmental temperature (Figs. 2, 3). The latter raised the
possibility that individuals retaining genetic linkages to ancestors who had adapted to tropical
climes, might have particular responses to extrinsic agents, namely to drugs and to the SARSCoV viruses that bind to ACE2 (Zhang et al., 2020a) – but not to ACE1 (generally referred to as
ACE, which has its own specific inhibitors referred to as ACEI).

9

Of possible relevance to this hypothesis are reports that, as latitude decreases towards the
equator, populations tend to have a lower BP (Cabrera et al., 2016), and that sub-Saharan
Africans tend to be salt-sensitive regarding increasing BP (Cappuccio and Miller, 2016).
Furthermore, while experimental hypertension induced in rats by high salt diets does not respond
to ARBs, that induced by the combination of salt and high environmental temperature is
responsive (Agbaraolorunpo et al., 2019). Although not concerned with the use of antihypertensive medications, a new study by Adam Li and his colleagues of black mortality in
SARS-CoV-2 infections (Li et al., 2020), suggests these results are relevant to humans.

3. Role of ARBs in SARS-CoV-2 infection
Given the dependence of SARS-CoV-2 on a host’s ACE2 receptor, at issue is whether ARBs
can affect, either negatively or positively, the progress of infection (Aronson and Ferner, 2020;
Focosi et al., 2020; Guo et al., 2020). Thus, it is proposed that the research community should
“better outline the renin-angiotensin system and specifically ACE2 in the pathogenesis of
COVID-19,” and that clinicians should accumulate more data “to determine if there is a link
between the use of ACEIs, ARBs, or both, and COVID-19 mortality and morbidity” (Patel and
Verma, 2020). In the absence of such information, various authorities have advised against
stopping treatment or switching to a BP treatment that does not involve the renin-angiotensin
system (Sommerstein et al., 2020; Quinn et al., 2020). Furthermore, if administered to nonhypertensive patients, ARBs might provoke dangerous degrees of hypotension (Imai and Abe,
2013; Sagy et al., 2016).
Current studies of SARS-CoV-2 are guided by the pioneering studies of SARS-CoV-1
(usually referred to as SARS-CoV), which also enters cells by way of ACE2. SARS-CoV-1
infectivity correlates with ACE2 expression (Hofmann and Pöhlmann, 2004). The Penninger
laboratory showed that the lung inflammation responded to anti-hypertensive drugs, with ARBs
being particularly effective (Imai et al., 2005; Kuba et al., 2005). So, as recently recollected
(Zhang et al., 2020a): “Thus, for SARS-CoV pathogenesis, ACE2 is not only the entry receptor
of the virus but also protects from lung injury. We therefore … suggested that in contrast to most
other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV became highly lethal because the virus deregulates a lung

10

protective pathway.”

SARS-CoV-2 deaths are mainly associated with respiratory failure resulting from virusinduced inflammation (Jia, 2016; Guo et al., 2020; Li et al., 2017). The ACE2 receptor (like the
secondary Ang II receptor, AT2R) has an anti-inflammatory role and is shed or incorporated with
the virus on cell entry, so is lost from the cell surface. Sometimes such receptor down-regulation
is a viral strategy to prevent superinfection by another, possibly competing, virus (Forsdyke,
2016a). However, this militates against any other roles a receptor might play. While there are
indications that SARS-CoV-2 can repress the gene encoding the ACE2 receptor, so that there is
no receptor refurbishment (Fadason et al., 2020), detailed transcriptional studies suggest that
refurbishment is possible (Butler et al., 2020). Consistent with the human case history discussed
here (Forsdyke, 2015a), RAS system-based anti-hypertensive agents (ARBs and ACEI) may
stabilize or increase host refurbishment of ACE2 receptors, thus opposing their virus-induced
loss (Bastolla, 2020). However, the study of Butler et al. (2020) concluded that with ACEI (but
not with ARBs) there was “significantly increased risk of intubation and death.” Clinical
advantages of ARBs and ACEI have been noted by others (Schneeweiss et al., 2020; Zhou et al.
2020).

4. Innate Immune differences in African populations

Associations of varying strength have been found between certain RAS genes and
susceptibility to hypertension. These associations distinguish African-Americans from other
population groups (Zhu et al., 2003). The association approach also supports the case that
enhanced susceptibility of African-Americans to SARS-CoV-2 is physiologically based. A
recent study of various geographical groups shows a higher variation among Africans of genes
encoding proteins that play major roles in innate immunity – e.g. mannose binding lectin 2
(MBL2). Thus, in ancestral Africans natural selection may have favored the explorations of a
wider range of responses to environmental challenges than in non-Africans – perhaps bestowing
relative disadvantages on the descendent diaspora. Indeed, it is held that the higher variation
“might be relevant for the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection” (Klaassen et al., 2020). The

11

locations of the amino acid changes in three MBL2 variants would be expected to compromise
the ability of these proteins to aggregate into functional units (oligomers), so that decreased
activity would be expected. Thus, possibly “variants in genes for proteins involved in the innate
immunity add some disadvantage to individuals in combating COVID-19” (Klaassen et al.,
2020). Earlier studies of SARS-CoV-1 also concluded that certain MBL variants might be
disadvantageous (Ip et al., 2005; Tu et al., 2015).

By virtue of reactivity with mannose-rich surface glycans, MBLs promote phagocytosis of
particulate pathogens and affect antibody-independent complement lysis of microbial and
mammalian cells. This involves what has become known as the lectin pathway (Forsdyke,
2016b). Thus, as with other innate immune system components, MBLs should assist antiviral
host defenses. Indeed, MBLs can react with the “glycan shield” – glycosylated SARS-CoV-1
spike protein (Zhou et al., 2010), and probably also with the oligomannose-rich SARS-CoV-2
spike protein (Chiodo et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2020a).
While these considerations indicate a possible positive role of MBLs in combatting SARSCoV-2, they might also assist cell entry (Ip et al., 2005). Furthermore, proinflammatory cleavage
products generated in the complement cascade might enhance SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity as has
been proposed, from mouse studies, they do for SARS-CoV-1 (Gralinski et al., 2018). Indeed, a
highly likely negative scenario involving the lectin pathway is supported by much emerging
evidence (Magro et al., 2020). Ting Gao et al. (2020b) have implicated the SARS-CoV-2
nucleocapsid N protein – the most evolutionary flexible of the main coronavirus structural
proteins (Dilucca et al., 2020; Gussow et al., 2020) – as activating the complement cascade by
way of a lectin pathway intermediate. Studies with the complement inhibitor suramin, which has
long been employed to treat African trypanosomiasis, have cast an intriguing light on this.
To be effective against protozoal pathogens, suramin requires a functioning host immune
system. It has long been known that the complement-dependent inhibition by lectin of cultured
mammalian lymphocytes in calf serum is inhibited at an early stage by suramin (Forsdyke and
Milthorp, 1979). From recent experiments with susceptible cells cultured in calf serum it is
concluded that “suramin inhibits binding or entry” of SARS-CoV-2 (da Silva et al., 2020).
Suramin was found to inhibit if added before, or at the time of, adding virus. However, if added

12

one hour later there was no inhibition. Hence it is suggested that suramin inhibits viral binding to
ACE2 receptors and cell entry. Suramin is known to interact with various serum proteins, so
there is a possible role for MBLs or other lectin pathway components in the calf serum used for
culture; this remains to be explored. These considerations suggest there might be circumstances
under which MBLs could both facilitate initial infection (inhibitable by suramin) and enhance
pathogenicity (due to inflammatory complement cleavage products). Both of these negative
functions might be manifest more in African-Americans by virtue of physiological differences.
Since the antimalarial drug chloroquine enhances lectin pathway inhibition (Forsdyke, 1975), it
would be contraindicated therapeutically.
African-Americans are often in disadvantaged socioeconomic groups where nutrition may be
impaired (Kendi, 2020). Recently, attention has been drawn to a possible role of the enzyme
cofactor, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) in SARS-CoV-2 infection (Heer et al.,
2020). Given the wide range of NAD+-dependent metabolic processes (the “NAD metabolome”),
it is possible that blacks, by virtue of their distinctive evolution and/or socioeconomic grouping,
might be differentially affected. NAD+ levels are normally supplemented by the salvage pathway
enzyme, nicotinamide phosphoryl transferase (NAMPT). Greatly increased NAD+ requirements
early in immune responses are indicated by enhanced transcription of the corresponding gene
(Forsdyke, 2020), which is also found in SARS-CoV-9-infected cells (Heer et al., 2020). Such
responses may be promoted by dietary supplements (vitamin B3 derivatives) or by medication
with NAMPT activators. When immune responses are deemed disadvantageous, then
corresponding NAMPT inhibitors are available (Gerner et al., 2020).
5. Conclusions
Investigations on possible ARB therapies are in progress (Patel and Verma, 2020) and are
likely to consider the well-reported age and gender differences. What can be added at this time is
that the design and interpretation of clinical evaluations should factor in, not only variables such
as tropical heritage (e.g. degree of skin pigmentation), but also ambient temperatures, past and
present ARB dosage, the stage of the progression of a patient’s hypertension, and differences in
innate immune defenses of various population groups. In other words, ARBs, by decreasing the
pro-inflammatory effects of AT1R and hence supporting the anti-inflammatory effects of AT2R
and ACE2 receptors, might be remedial under some circumstances, but not others. ARBs would

13

operate, not by way of their ability to lower BP, but by way of their anti-inflammatory activities.
Sensitivity to environmental temperature (Forsdyke, 2015a; Li et al., 2020) suggests that patients
should be kept in warm environments. Indeed, the case doubling time is longer in tropical
regions (Berumen et al., 2020; Notari, 2020), indicating that those with unabridged RAS systems
might be helped by higher temperatures (V’kovski et al., 2020; Pirouz et al., 2020).
While much attention is rightly being given to possibilities of future effective anti-viral
measures (vaccination and drugs selectively affecting viral chemistry), there are pressures to
buttress host defenses with what drugs are now available. Thus, “an approach to treating patients
with severe COVID-19 infection might be hiding in plain sight;” namely ARBs, perhaps
employed in concert with another class of repurposable drug, the statins (Fedson et al., 2020;
Zhang et al., 2020c). Others envisage a role for β-arrestins that mediate the desensitization,
internalization and ubiquitination of G-protein coupled receptors, such as AT1R. Although it only
weakly binds AT1Rs, they point to Ang (1-7) as an “endogenous β-arrestin biased agonist of the
AT1R,” which is like other arrestins that can be invoked by AT1R activation (Fig. 1) (Manglik et
al., 2020). The repurposing of a drug found to selectively modulate AT1R signaling could
activate anti-inflammatory arrestin pathways without the raising of BP or inflammation, which
require AT1R associated G-protein coupled signaling that is controlled by RGS2 (regulator of Gprotein signaling 2) (Heximer et al., 2003). If successful, these approaches would allow humoral
and cellular herd immunity to develop without concomitant deaths, and hence could decrease
requirements for testing and contact-monitoring.
