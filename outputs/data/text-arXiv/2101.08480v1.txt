Abstract
COVID-19 has led to school closures in Japan to cope with the pandemic. Under the state of emergency, in addition
to school closure, after-school care has not been sufficiently supplied. We independently collected individual level data
through internet surveys to construct short panel data from mid-March to mid-June 2020, which covered before and

after the state of emergency. We analyse how the presence of school-aged children influences their parents’ views
about working from home. After controlling for various factors using a fixed effects model, we find that in cases
where parents were workers, and the children are (1) in primary school, parents are willing to promote working from
home. If children are (2) in junior high school, the parents’ view is hardly affected. (3) Surprisingly, workers whose
children are primary school pupils are most likely to support promotion of working from home after schools reopen.
Due to school closure and a lack of after-school care, parents need to work from home, and this experience
motivated workers with small children to continue doing so to improve work-life balance even after schools reopen.

1. Introduction

How did COVID-19 change working styles in 2020?1 According to previous studies, outbreaks of viral disease
lead to school closures (e.g. Cauchemez et al. 2008; Cauchemez et al. 2014; Adda 2016). Similarly, schools in various
countries have closed in response to COVID-19 (Baldwin & Mauro 2020). Consequently, the lifestyles of households
with small children have changed. Childcare plays a critical role in a child’s growth process when it stays at home2. The
closure of schools has necessitated childcare at home, which increased parents’ time for childcare3. In particular, workers
having a child in primary school face difficulties because their child is less mature and needs care in the daytime.
Availability of after-school childcare leads to the continuity of maternal labour supply in Japan (Takaku 2019) 4 .
In US counties, a lockdown to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 spread has led to an 8% increase in the number of people who
stay at home (Brzezinski et al. 2020). In the UK, workers with lower-paying jobs are less able to work from home (Costa-Dias et
al. 2020). COVID-19 caused economic stagnation, which has had greater repercussions on sectors with high female employment
shares (Alon et al. 2020).
2
Lack of after school childcare leads to an increased risk of skipping school and use of alcohol and drugs (Aizer 2004). Economic
recessions cause teenagers’ risky behaviors (Pabilonia 2017). A mother’s absence reduces the time a child spends in school (Pörtner
2016).
3
In the field of economics, many existing studies deal with parental time with children (e.g. Gutiérrez-Domènech 2010; Aguiar et.
al. 2013; Gimenez-Nadal & Molina 2014; Morrill & Pabilonia 2015; Gorsuch 2016; Romanm & Cortina 2016; Bauer & Sonchak
2017).
4
Existing studies deal with the relationship between childcare availability and maternal employment (e.g. van Gameren & Ooms
1

However, in addition to school closures, a state of emergency has been declared to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in
Japan. Hence, after-school childcare has not been sufficiently provided in the childcare market. Parents with small
children are obliged to care for them by not going to their workplace. Inevitably, they seem to desire to work from home.
Primary and junior high schools were closed throughout Japan after March 2, 2020. Subsequently, a state of
emergency was declared on April 7, and deregulated on May 25. In response to the deregulation, schools reopened in
May. Japan differed from other countries that also implemented the policy of school closure because the Japanese
government did not adopt the lockdown, which was one of the more stringent measures against COVID-19. In Japan,
workers who choose to go their workplace are not penalised. Japanese workers can decide whether to go to their
workplace or work from home to enable them to care for their child5. Sevilla and Smith (2020) collected individuallevel data in the UK and found that COVID-19 changed the allocation of childcare compared with prior to COVID-19.
They conducted a survey in May and asked workers with small children about work arrangements before and after the
lockdown. One of advantages of the current study is that it conducted surveys five times with the same respondents.
Hence, we can use the panel data to identify the same person’s change of their view during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Workers do not have the freedom of being able to work from home due to work environments (Shimazu et al. 2020).
Therefore, it seems plausible that workers did not work from home even though they would like to. Different from
existing studies examining change of work style (Sevilla & Smith 2020; Yamamura & Tsutsui 2020a; Hatayama et al.
2020), we consider the subjective views about working from home by controlling work style. This study examines how
workers with a child in primary school desired working from home as the situation changed in response to the spread of
COVID-19. The main findings are as follows. First, parents with a child in primary school desired to promote working
from home6. This tendency was observed especially after the deregulation of the state of emergency and reopening of
schools.
The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 presents an overview of the situation in Japan and
outlines the design of the surveys. Section 3 describes the empirical method. Section 4 presents and interprets the
estimated results. The final section provides some reflections and conclusions.

2009; Havnes & Mogstad 2011; Abe 2013; Asai et al. 2015; Brilli et al. 2016).

In the US, UK, France, and Italy, which adopted the lockdown, neither a firm’s manager nor employees themselves can decide
whether to go to the workplace.

Some studies analyse stay-at-home behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic (Doganoglu & Ozdenoren 2020; Engle et al.
2020; Yamamura & Tsutsui 2020b).

2. Design of surveys and data

Figure 1 shows the changes in the daily number of people infected with COVID-19 during the period from March 1
to June 30. On February 27, the Japanese government requested schools to close beginning in March, although this was
not obligatory. In response, various schools (primary and junior high) throughout Japan were closed from March 2.
Therefore, parents with school-aged children were confronted with an unexpected situation in which their child did not
go to school in the daytime. However, parents can outsource childcare for childcare services. In this situation, we

Note: First, second, third, fourth, and fifth waves were conducted on March 10, March 27, April 10, May 8, and June 12, respectively. Thin lines
show the date of the surveys. Thick lines show the date when schools closures began (March 2) and when the state of emergency was deregulated
(May 25). After the deregulation, schools reopened although the timing varied according to prefectures. A state of emergency was promulgated
from April 7.

Source: Daily COVID-19 infections were sourced from the official website of the ‘Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare’.
https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/covid-19/open-data.html. (On July 4, 2020).

As shown in Figure 1, the number of infected people drastically increased from the beginning of April. To cope

with the rapid prevalence of COVID-19, the Japanese government declared a state of emergency on April 7. Similar to
other countries (Baldwin & Mauro 2020), various public facilities such as museums and amusement parks were closed.
However, the government only requested citizens stay home and avoid person-to-person contact and gathering together
in enclosed spaces. These were not obligatory and there was no penalty if people did not follow the government request7.
People could actually behave and make decisions in their daily lives based on their free will.
During the period of state of emergency, the pace of increase in the number of infections declined. On May 25, the
state of emergency was deregulated. Consequently, schools reopened although there was variation of date of the
reopening among regions. Schools were reopened in all parts of Japan on June 12 and the fifth wave of surveys was
conducted on the same day.

2.1. Survey design
In February, even before COVID-19 spread in Japan, we planned to independently collect data to explore how
COVID-19 influenced individual behaviours and households. We commissioned a research company to conduct surveys
via the internet8. The sampling method was designed to collect a representative sample of the Japanese population about
working style, views about working style, family members, job status, gender, age, educational background, and place
of residence.
In the first wave of the survey, questionnaires were sent to selected Japanese citizens aged 16–79 throughout Japan
and the same respondents participated in the subsequent waves. Figure 1 indicates that the surveys were conducted five
time between March and June. Hence, we constructed short-term panel data.
The first wave was conducted on March 13. We gathered 4,359 observations, and the response rate was 54.7%.
The second, third, fourth, and fifth waves were conducted on March 27, April 10, May 8, and June 12, respectively. The
response rates reached 80.2% (second wave), 92.2% (third wave), 91.9% (fourth wave), and 89.4% (fifth wave). The
sample was limited to workers because this study considered the preference for work style, this reduced the sample size
to 8,903. Parents of primary school pupils were assumed to be younger than 50 years old, which was predicted from
female child-bearing ages. Hence, we further limited the sample to respondents below 50 years old, which was also used
for estimations. In addition to the sample of workers, we also used a sub-sample limited to workers under 50 years old.

The situation was different from countries implementing drastic measures such as the ‘lockdown’ in the US, the UK, Italy,
France, and Spain.

Table 1 presents descriptions of the variables used in this study. In waves 1–5, respondents were asked the following
questions:
How do you consider ‘the present condition of working from home’ as a countermeasure against COVID-19?

Please answer in a scale from 1 (Sufficient) to 5 (Not sufficient).
We define the answer as proxy variable for preference for working from home (Work Home Preference).

2. Distribution
of Work Home preference
by no_chi_pri
As shown in Table 1, Work Home Preference for workers with a child in primary school is greater than for other
workers. This is consistent with observations in Figure 2 comparing the distribution of Work Home Preference between
them. The findings indicate that parents of primary school pupils prefer working from home. We check how the effect
of primary school pupil changes as the situation changes. Figure 3 presents mean values of Work Home Preference in
each wave. We observe an increase in Work Home Preference from the first to the third wave, and a decrease after the
third wave. Considering Figures 1 and 3 jointly indicates that respondents become more likely to prefer working until
when the number of daily infections increased, but less likely to do so after flattening of the curve.

In waves 1–5, respondents were also asked the following question:
‘Within a week, to what degree have you achieved the not going to work?
Please indicate on a scale from 1 (I have not achieved it at all) to 5 (I have completely achieved it)’.
The answer to this question is defined as the degree of working from home (Remote Work). Figure 4 shows its mean
values in each wave. As shown, the degree of Remote Work increased from the first to the fourth wave, and decreased
from the fourth to fifth wave. The degree of working from home did not reduce to the level before the state of emergency,
even after it was deregulated. This implies that working from home is, to a certain extent, maintained regardless of the
spread of COVID-19. According to Figure 3, workers are more likely to prefer working from home after the
deregulation of the state of emergency than before its declaration. In our interpretation of comparing Figures 3 and 4,
experience of working from home changes worker’s preference for it. That is, through experience of working from
home, workers become more likely to prefer working from home than before.

3. Methodology
3.1.

OLS model

We used a simple OLS regression model.9 The estimated function takes the following form:
Work Home Preference it =α0 + α1 Primary School i + α2 Junior High School i +α3Wave2 t +α4Wave3 t +α5Wave4
t

+α6Wave5 t +X’B + u it,

where Work Home Preference it represents the dependent variable for individual i and wave t. Work Home Preference is
the key independent variable for exploring the effects of having children in primary school. To check for differences in
the childcare requirements, Junior High School, which is a dummy for having a child in junior high school, is included
in the estimations. The situation in Japan drastically changed during the study period, as illustrated in Figure 1. Therefore,
we investigate impact of such change. Specifically, for testing the policy effect, we should pay attention to before and
after the state of emergency. The second (Wave 2), third wave (Wave 3), fourth wave (Wave 4), and fifth wave (Wave 5)
dummies are included; their reference group is the first wave. These dummies capture the degree of change in the
dependent variables compared with the first wave. The regression parameters are denoted as α. X indicates the vector

Work Home Preference is an ordered, discrete variable. In this case, the ordered probit estimation is appropriate. However, its
estimation results are similar to those derived from the OLS model. Our argument does not change when using the ordered probit
model. However, the interpretation of the OLS results is simpler and easier to understand than that of the ordered probit model.
Thus, we use OLS in this study. The results of the ordered probit model are available upon request from the corresponding author.

of control variables to capture demographic factors (Ages, Female), educational background (Schooling), economic
condition (Income), family structure (OLD Person), and prevalence of COVID-19 (Infected COVID_19). The error term
is denoted by u. The data structure is a panel. However, we did not employ the fixed effects estimation because Primary
School is constant and therefore captured as fixed effects. Accordingly, the estimation results of Primary School cannot
be obtained.10
In addition to the sample of workers, we also use a sub-sample of workers under 50 years old because most parents
of primary school pupils are thought to be under 50 years. We conduct the estimations using both the sample of workers
and sub-sample of workers under 50 years old.

3.2. Fixed effects model
As alternative model for closer examination, we used the fixed effects model. The estimated function takes the following
form:
Work Home Preference it =b1 Wave2 t Primary i + b2 Wave3 t Primary i + b3 Wave4 t Primary i + b4 Wave5 t
Primary i +b5 Wave2 t + b6 Wave3 t + b7 Wave4 t + b8 Wave5 t + ki + u it,

In this specification, the fixed effects method was used to control for various time-invariant variables included in
the baseline model such as Schooling, Income, Age, and Old Person. In addition, Primary i and Junior High i are also
controlled although their cross terms were not controlled. ki captures the effects of various time-invariant variables. The
cross term of wave dummies and Primary describes the degree of changing effect of having a child in primary school
in the period. In alternative specifications, instead of Primary, the cross term of wave dummies and Junior High are
included for checking the effect of having children in junior high school.

4. Results and interpretation

OLS estimation

Table 2 reports the results based on a sample of workers and sub-sample of workers under aged 50 in columns (1)
– (2) and columns (3) – (4), respectively. In columns (2) and (4), Remote Work is included to control the degree of
working from home because worker’s preference depends on the actual degree of working from home. However, its

Under the Japanese educational system, it is possible that primary school students entered junior high school in April if they were
in sixth grade in March. Similarly, junior high school students possibly entered junior high school in April if they were in third grade
in March. However, we only asked respondents whether they have a child in primary school (junior high school) in Wave 1. Thus,
we assume that Primary School and Junior High School are the same from Wave 1 to Wave 5.

Note: Numbers within parentheses are robust standard errors clustered on residential prefectures. *** and ** indicate statistical significance at 1%
and 5% levels, respectively.

As can be seen from Table 2, the coefficients of Primary School are positive and are statistically significant in all results.
This suggests that in households with children in primary school, workers are more likely to prefer working from home
than other workers. Junior High School does not show statistical significance in any column. This indicates that having
children in primary school influences their parents’ preference for working from home, whereas having children in
junior high school does not. We interpret this as suggesting a difference in the necessity for childcare between children
in primary school versus those in junior high school, who are considered to be more mature.
Regarding control variables, consistent with Figure 3, all wave dummies show a significant positive sign.
Specifically, absolute values of their coefficients are the largest in third wave, which implies that working from home is

most desired directly after the declaration of the state of emergency. Schooling was found to have a significant positive
sign. This can be interpreted as higher educated workers are more able to work from home using internet technology,
which leads them to prefer working from home. COVID_19 produces a significant positive sign, which implies that the
spread of COVID-19 leads people to desire to work from home. The significant positive sign of Remote Work shows a
positive correlation between preference for working from home and the degree of working from home.

4.2 Fixed effects estimation
Table 3 reports the results of the fixed effects estimation. We observe the significant positive sign of Wave3 Primary
and Wave5 Primary. This implies that workers with children in primary school are more likely to prefer working from
home directly after the declaration of a state of emergency and after reopening of schools. Further, the value of its
coefficients of Wave5 Primary is 0.16, which is larger than that of Wave3 Primary (0.12). This indicates that the gap
of need to work from home between workers with children in primary school and other workers is larger by 0.16 in fifth
wave and 0.12 in the third wave than that in the first wave. It is difficult to supply childcare services under the state of
emergency. Therefore, workers want to work from home to be able to care for their child themselves. However,
surprisingly, workers’ with small children need for working from home is the highest after reopening school when they
are less obliged to care for their children. As shown in Figure 4, the degree of working from home in the fifth wave is
higher than that in second wave. Hence, workers are more likely to work from home after schools reopened than before
the state of emergency. Meanwhile, Figure 3 shows that preference for working from home in the fifth wave is equivalent
to that in second wave. Hence, workers’ desire to work from home does not change between before the state of
emergency and after reopening of schools. From the viewpoint of behavioural economics, people evaluate outcomes
relative to a reference point and their preference therefore depends on this reference point (Kahneman & Tversky 1979).
Our findings imply that experience of working from home changed workers’ reference point.
Regarding control variables, we do not observe statistical significance for COVID_19 and Remote Work. Different from
Table 2, controlling for the fixed effects of respondents causes the statistical significance of COVID_19 and Remote
Work to disappear.

Overall, the combined results in Tables 2–4 reveal that workers are likely to work from home if they have a child in

primary school. Surprisingly, the gap in preference for working from home between workers with children in primary
school and other workers is the largest after reopening of schools, rather than during the school closure period. These
discoveries provide the compelling evidence that experience of working from home leads workers with small children
to consider remote working and engaging in childcare to improve work-life balance.

5. Conclusion
Governments in various countries adopted the policy to close schools to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic in
2020. Under the state of emergency, in addition to school closures, childcare services have not been sufficiently
supplied. Hence, parents are left with the burden of childcare. However, workers with small children have been
confronted with difficulty in combining work and childcare during the day. We originally collected short-panel data
covering before and after the state of emergency. Based on the data, we investigated whether the state of emergency
leads workers with school-aged children to have the view to promote working from home. We found that parents
with children in primary school to have the aforementioned view. However, the presence of children in junior high
school did not influence it. Further, workers with children in primary school are most likely to support promotion of
working from home than other workers after the deregulation of the state of emergency, and hence reopening schools.
This finding implies that closure of schools and after-school care during the day caused parents with children in
primary school to require working from home. Moreover, these parents learn from the experience of working from
home, which causes them to be aware of its effectiveness. Naturally, workers with small children are motivated to
work from home to improve their work-life balance. They subsequently have view to support promoting working
from home even after deregulation of the state of emergency and reopening of schools.
The findings of this study were based on Japanese data. Due to limitation of the data, it is unknown whether the
argument holds in other countries that adopted more stringent measures against COVID-19 than Japan. It is therefore
valuable for researchers to examine whether workers with small children are more likely to require working from
home than other workers, which is an avenue for future research.
