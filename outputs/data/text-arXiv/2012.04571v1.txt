Abstract. During its history, the ultimate goal of economics has been to develop similar frameworks
for modeling economic behavior as invented in physics. This has not been successful, however, and
current state of the process is the neoclassical framework that bases on static optimization. By using
a static framework, however, we cannot model and forecast the time paths of economic quantities
because for a growing firm or a firm going into bankruptcy, a positive profit maximizing flow of
production does not exist. Due to these problems, we present a dynamic theory for the production of
a profit-seeking firm where the firm’s adjustment may be stable or unstable. This is important,
currently, because we should be able to forecast the possible future bankruptcies of firms due to the
Covid-19 pandemic. By using the model, we can solve the time moment of bankruptcy of a firm as a
function of several parameters. The proposed model is mathematically identical with Newton’s model
of a particle moving in a resisting medium, and so the model explains the reasons that stop the motion
too. The frameworks for modeling dynamic events in physics are thus applicable in economics, and
we give reasons why physics is more important for the development of economics than pure
mathematics. (JEL D21, O12)

1. Introduction
Mirowski [1] shows that aim of the progenitors of neoclassical economics was to create similar
principles of modeling for economics as in classical mechanics. This process has not been successful,
however, and current theoretical framework of neoclassical economics relies on static optimization
and the concept of equilibrium borrowed from physics by Canard at 1801, see [2].
By a static model, however, we cannot explain the evolutionary behavior of economies. MasColell et
al. [3 p. 620] state this problem as: “A characteristic feature that distinguishes economics from other
scientific fields is that, for us, the equations of equilibrium constitute the center of our discipline.
Other sciences, such as physics or even ecology, put comparatively more emphasis on determination
of dynamic laws of change. … The reason, informally speaking, is that economists are good (or so
we hope) at recognizing a state of equilibrium but are poor at predicting precisely how an economy
in disequilibrium will evolve. Certainly there are intuitive dynamic principles: if demand is larger
than supply then price will increase, if price is larger than marginal cost then production will expand.
… The difficulty is in transforming these informal principles into precise dynamic laws.”
The definition of “dynamic economic laws” requires a dynamic framework for modeling, and the
Newtonian framework presented in Refs [4-8] is suitable for this. Economic units like to improve
their welfare and optimal behavior results when no improvement is possible, see [9]. If we thus
assume that economic units (entrepreneurs, consumers, workers, etc.) like to better their situation in
1

a competitive environment, the units behave as particles in the physical world that “like” to move
toward the position of their minimum potential energy. The error in the neoclassical framework is
the same as if in physics the initial position of a particle were its point of minimum potential energy
where it has “no willingness” to move anywhere.
Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, thousands of firms around the world will go into bankruptcy in the
near future. Statistics Finland (https://www.stat.fi/index_en.html) e.g. reports that in Finland during
Jan-Oct 2020 were initiated 1886 processes of bankruptcy. We show that we can forecast this
phenomenon by using the Newtonian framework of economics in contrast with the neoclassical one.

2. Weaknesses in the neoclassical theory of a firm
Let the flow of production of a firm under imperfect competition be 𝑞 (𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡/𝑦), where 𝑦 is a time
unit e.g. a week, month, year, etc1. The sales function of the one-product firm is denoted by 𝑝 = 𝑓(𝑞),
where 𝑝(€⁄𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡) is the price of the product. The cost function of the firm is 𝐶(𝑞) (€⁄𝑦) and the
profit of the firm Π(𝑞) (€⁄𝑦) from time unit 𝑦 is then
Π(𝑞) = 𝑓(𝑞)𝑞 − 𝐶(𝑞), 𝑓 ′ (𝑞) < 0, 𝐶 ′ (𝑞) > 0.
The necessary condition for maximum profit assumed in the neoclassical theory is
Π′ (𝑞) = 0 ⟺ 𝑓(𝑞) + 𝑓 ′ (𝑞)𝑞 = 𝐶 ′ (𝑞),

(1)

where 𝑀𝑅 = 𝑓(𝑞) + 𝑓 ′ (𝑞)𝑞 is marginal revenue and 𝑀𝐶 = 𝐶 ′ (𝑞) marginal cost. The possible
solution of Eq. (1) is denoted by 𝑞 ∗ . The sufficient condition for 𝑞 ∗ to maximize the profit is
Π′′ (𝑞)|𝑞=𝑞∗ = 2𝑓 ′ (𝑞) + 𝑓 ′′ (𝑞)𝑞 − 𝐶 ′′ (𝑞) < 0.

(2)

Condition (2) requires that for the sales function holds
2𝑓 ′ (𝑞) + 𝑓 ′′ (𝑞)𝑞 ≤ 0;
we will return to this condition in section 5.1. The requirement of maximum profit for the cost
function is 𝐶 ′′ (𝑞) > 0, that is, marginal costs are increasing with 𝑞, i.e. decreasing returns to scale
hold. Increasing returns to scale takes place in a firm e.g. when small-scale production is changed to
larger scale production via automatizing and producing in larger quantities. We have evidence of this
(see [10-13]) and thus the requirement 𝐶 ′′ (𝑞) > 0 implies that the static neoclassical framework does
not cover these situations. In the real world, the sales and cost functions of firms depend on time,
which too is impossible in the static neoclassical framework.
Due to these weaknesses in the neoclassical framework, we introduce a general framework for
modeling the behavior of a firm that can explain besides static optimal behavior also its growth and
possible bankruptcy. In the theoretical part, we follow [6] and so the presentation is relatively short.

3. Why physics is more important for economics than pure mathematics?

1

Measurement units are in parentheses after the quantities.

2

Textbooks of economics commonly refer to those of mathematics when presenting mathematical
theories. However, there are four reasons why it would be more fruitful to refer to books of physics.
1) Mathematics operates with numbers, vectors, functions, and other abstract objects because in
mathematics, measurement units are not defined. Real sciences like physics and economics,
on the other hand, operate with dimensional quantities (i.e. quantities with a measurement
unit) measured from the real world. Thus, for empirical evaluation it is essential that we
express the mathematical theories in economics with dimensional quantities as in physics
because then the theoretical quantities have exact counterparts in the real world and the
theories are rigorously testable. For example, in dynamic models mathematics operates with
derivatives while time derivatives of theoretical physical and economic quantities correspond
to instantaneous flows or accelerations of these quantities with exact measurement units.
2) Mathematics studies the principles of solving equations and differential equations, the
algebraic structures of mathematical objects, and the properties of functions and functional
spaces. The modeling of real world events, on the other hand, requires the measurement of
flows and accelerations of physical, economic, etc. quantities, and mathematical formulation
of reasons causing these changes. In mathematics, events are not observed, and the causal
modeling principle in real sciences – every event has a reason – is not applied in mathematics.
Physics has shown how to apply the causal principle – force causes acceleration – successfully
in explaining real world events, and other real sciences can apply the same principle.
3) In mathematics, a theorem has scientific value after it has been proved formally. In real
sciences, too, a theory should not have inconsistencies. However, in real sciences the scientific
value of a theory depends on its ability to explain observed events. Thus, in real sciences a
consistent theory does not have scientific value unless it has been corroborated empirically.
4) One of the “laws of Nature” is that freely moving particles move along the shortest path
toward the direction where their potential energy decreases2. Lagrangian mechanics in physics
bases on this principle, and there the equilibrium state of a particle is its point of minimum
potential energy. However, Newtonian mechanics yields the same equations of motion for
moving particles as Lagrangian mechanics, and Newtonian mechanics bases on the forces that
“guide” particles toward the zero-force state where the minimum potential energy holds. In
neoclassical microeconomics, the principle of modeling is that economic units (consumers,
firms, etc.) make decisions to reach their optimum state, i.e. maximum utility or profit. Thus,
if we define “economic forces” so that they “guide” economic units toward their optimum
state, the two sciences are homomorphic and can apply the same principles in modeling the
time paths of “moving objects”. The potential “energy” (in economics, money corresponds to
energy, see e.g. [18]) in a firm’s production can be defined e.g. as the profitability difference
in the future by producing at current flow of production as compared with the profit
maximizing one. Thus, a firm has potential “energy” if it can change its flow of production in
the future so that its profit increases. In [18], this way defined production potential in the
Lagrangian framework gives identical results as the Newtonian framework we apply here.
Thus, the two frameworks are consistent in economics as in physics. In mathematics, no
general modeling principles exist for observed events, and mathematics helps in these
analyses only in checking that no errors occur in calculations.

4. Kinematics of production
The accumulated production of a firm till time moment 𝑡 (like the accumulated kilometers a car has
driven) denoted by 𝑄(𝑡) (𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡) (a marginal change in time 𝑑𝑠 is measured in time units 𝑦) is
𝑡

𝑄(𝑡) = 𝑄(𝑡0 ) + ∫𝑡 𝑞(𝑠)𝑑𝑠, 𝑄 ′ (𝑡) = 𝑞(𝑡), 𝑄 ′′ (𝑡) = 𝑞 ′ (𝑡),
0

where 𝑄(𝑡0 ) is the accumulated production of the firm from its foundation till moment 𝑡0 , 𝑄′(𝑡) with
unit 𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡/𝑦 is the instantaneous velocity (flow) of accumulated production, and 𝑄 ′′ (𝑡) = 𝑞′(𝑡) with
unit 𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡/𝑦 2 the instantaneous acceleration of accumulated production. This kinematics of
production is a necessary prelude for production dynamics analogous with Newtonian mechanics.
Notice that in mathematics, the above concepts are abstract derivatives of functions without a
measurement unit and no counterpart in the real world.

5. A dynamic theory of production
In dynamizing the theory of a firm, we let the price and the flow of production to depend on time 𝑡
with unit 𝑦. The function, that expresses the maximum unit price 𝑝(𝑡) (€⁄𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡) by which the firm
can sell 𝑞(𝑡) (𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡⁄𝑦) units at time unit 𝑦, the inverse demand or the sales function of the firm, is
𝑝(𝑡) = 𝑓(𝑞(𝑡), 𝑡),

𝜕𝑓
≤ 0.
𝜕𝑞

We assume that the product is heterogeneous with those of other firms to avoid taking account other
firms’ production decisions in the decision of the studied firm, see [15]. Including time in function
𝑓(. ) allows that the sales of the firm may change with time due to changes in customers’ habits or
due to the firm’s marketing of the good.
We can write the cost function of the studied firm as
𝐶(𝑞(𝑡), 𝑡) = ℎ(𝑡) + 𝑔(𝑞(𝑡), 𝑡)𝑞(𝑡)
where 𝐶(. ) (€/𝑦) is the costs of the firm during time unit 𝑦 at time moment 𝑡 realized at the flow of
production 𝑞(𝑡), ℎ(𝑡) (€⁄𝑦) fixed costs during time unit 𝑦 independent of the flow of production,
and unit costs 𝑔(. ) (€⁄𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡) may depend on the flow of production and time. Technological
development e.g. may decrease unit costs with time.
The firm's leaders like to increase the firm’s profit with time and so they change 𝑞(𝑡) as (see [6]):
𝑞 ′ (𝑡) > 0 𝑖𝑓

𝜕Π
> 0,
𝜕𝑞

𝑞 ′ (𝑡) < 0 𝑖𝑓

𝜕Π
𝜕Π
< 0, 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑞 ′ (𝑡) = 0 𝑖𝑓
= 0.
𝜕𝑞
𝜕𝑞

(3)

These rules guide the firm toward the direction of greater profit with time. They are in accordance
with the intuitive dynamic rules stated in [3] referred earlier, and [16 p. 387] writes about a firm in a
perfectly competed market: “… if 𝑝 − ∆𝐶 ⁄∆𝑞 > 0, then the firm can increase its profits by producing
more”. Thus, also in neoclassical economics the adjustment rules in Eq. (3) are accepted.

4

We identify 𝜕Π⁄𝜕𝑞 = 𝑀𝑅 − 𝑀𝐶, the reason for the acceleration of production, as the “force acting
upon the production of a profit-seeking firm”. A relation, that fulfills the rules in Eq. (3) (see [6]), is
𝑚𝑞 ′ (𝑡) =

𝜕Π
,
𝜕𝑞

𝑚 ≥ 0,

constant.

(4)

Because constant 𝑚 is positive or zero, then in Eq. (4), 𝑞 ′ (𝑡) and 𝜕Π⁄𝜕𝑞 are simultaneously positive,
negative, or zero, and so the requirements in Eq. (3) are met. In Eq. (4), the firm adjusts its flow of
production according to the deviation between its marginal revenue and cost (this holds in [17] too).
The magnitude of 𝑚 measures the inertia in the firm's adjustment of production, and its unit (€ ×
𝑦 2 )/𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡 2 guarantees the dimensional consistency of Eq. (4), see [18]. We call 𝑚 the “inertial mass
of the flow of production” and Eq. (4) the Newtonian theory of a firm adjusting its flow of production.
Neoclassical theory corresponds to zero-force in Eq. (4): 𝜕Π⁄𝜕𝑞 = 0 ⇔ 𝑞 ′ (𝑡) = 0.

5.1. Decreasing and increasing returns to scale
To start up with a simple model, we assume the following sales and cost functions for the firm:
𝑏

𝑝(𝑡) = 𝑓(𝑞(𝑡)) = 𝑎 + 𝑞(𝑡) ,

𝐵

𝐶(𝑞(𝑡), 𝑡) = ℎ(𝑡) + (𝐴 + 2 𝑞(𝑡)) 𝑞(𝑡),

(5)

where 𝑞(𝑡) is as before and 𝑎, 𝐴 are positive constants with unit €/𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡, constant 𝑏 has unit €/𝑦, and
that of 𝐵 is (€ × 𝑦)/𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡 2 . If 𝑞(𝑡) → 0 then 𝑝(𝑡) → ∞, and if 𝑞(𝑡) → ∞ then 𝑝(𝑡) → 𝑎. Parameter
𝑎 measures the price the firm receives from one product in any situation, and 𝑏 measures the relation
between price and the sales of the firm. The more competition exists, the closer to zero is 𝑏;
monopolistic competition and a monopoly firm correspond to 𝑏 > 0. In section 2 we showed that the
sufficient condition for maximum profit of the studied firm is
Π′′ (𝑞)|𝑞=𝑞∗ = 2𝑓 ′ (𝑞) + 𝑓′′(𝑞)𝑞 − 𝐶 ′′ (𝑞) < 0.
Applying the sales function in Eq. (5) in this, we get
2𝑓 ′ (𝑞) + 𝑓 ′′ (𝑞)𝑞 = −2

𝑏 2𝑏
+
𝑞 = 0.
𝑞2 𝑞3

Thus, the sufficient condition for maximum profit in this case is 𝐶 ′′ (𝑞) > 0. In the cost function,
parameter 𝐴 > 0 measures unit costs from the first produced unit during time unit 𝑦 and parameter 𝐵
the relation unit costs have with the flow of production. Decreasing returns to scale correspond to
𝐵 > 0, constant returns to scale to 𝐵 = 0, and increasing returns to scale to 𝐵 < 0.
Assuming fixed costs during time unit 𝑦 to be constant ℎ0 , profit function Π(€⁄𝑦) becomes
𝐵

Π(𝑞(𝑡)) = 𝑝(𝑞(𝑡))𝑞(𝑡) − 𝐶(𝑞(𝑡), 𝑡) = 𝑎𝑞(𝑡) + 𝑏 − ℎ0 − 𝐴𝑞(𝑡) − 2 𝑞 2 (𝑡).

(6)

Omitting the time dependency in variable 𝑞 we get the static neoclassical setting. The necessary
condition for maximum profit is then
Π′ (𝑞) = 0

⇔

𝑎 − 𝐴 − 𝐵𝑞 = 0
5

⇔

𝑞∗ =

𝑎−𝐴
𝐵

,

where 𝑞 ∗ is the possible profit maximizing flow of production. Notice that the unit of 𝑞 ∗ is:
€⁄𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡
𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡
= 𝑦 . The sufficient condition for maximum is
€×𝑦⁄𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡 2
Π′′ (𝑞)|𝑞=𝑞∗ = −𝐵 < 0.

(7)

Condition (7) requires 𝐵 > 0, and for 𝑞 ∗ to be positive, then 𝑎 > 𝐴 must hold too. If these conditions
hold, 𝑞 ∗ is the profit maximizing flow of production.
In the following in this section, we assume 𝑎 > 𝐴 because producing a good that does not get sold at
a price higher than its unit costs in the beginning of production is in most cases not sensible. The
marginal revenue and cost functions with unit €⁄𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡 are then:
𝑀𝑅 = 𝑎, 𝑀𝐶 = 𝐴 + 𝐵𝑞.
Increasing returns to scale (𝐵 < 0) with constant 𝑀𝑅 then implies that the firm does not have a
positive optimal flow of production, and these situations cannot be modeled by using the static
neoclassical framework. Next, we show that we can model this situation in the proposed framework.
Newtonian Eq. (4) is now
𝜕Π
= 𝑚𝑞 ′ (𝑡) ⟺ 𝑎 − 𝐴 − 𝐵𝑞(𝑡) = 𝑚𝑞 ′ (𝑡).
𝜕𝑞

(8)

Eq. (8) shows that the firm increases its flow of production (𝑞 ′ (𝑡) > 0) if 𝑞(𝑡) < (𝑎 − 𝐴)⁄𝐵 = 𝑞 ∗ ,
and decreases its flow of production if 𝑞(𝑡) > 𝑞 ∗ , where 𝑞 ∗ is the possible profit maximizing flow of
production. The solution of Eq. (8) is
𝑞(𝑡) =

𝐵
𝑎−𝐴
+ 𝐻0 𝑒 −𝑚 𝑡 ,
𝐵

(9)

where 𝐻0 (𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡/𝑦) is the constant of integration and 𝐵𝑡⁄𝑚 a dimensionless quantity because time 𝑡
has unit 𝑦. Let 𝐵 > 0. Then, according to Eq. (9), 𝑞(𝑡) → 𝑞 ∗ = (𝑎 − 𝐴)⁄𝐵 with 𝑡 → ∞ and this
neoclassical equilibrium corresponds to zero force in Eq. (8). Setting 𝑡 = 0 in Eq. (9) gives: 𝑞(0) =
(𝑎 − 𝐴)⁄𝐵 + 𝐻0 ⟹ 𝐻0 = 𝑞(0) − (𝑎 − 𝐴)⁄𝐵 . Thus, 𝑞(𝑡) increases (decreases) with time if 𝐻0 is
negative (positive), that is, if 𝑞(0) is smaller (greater) than 𝑞 ∗ . The neoclassical theory corresponds
to 𝐻0 = 0 ⇔ 𝑞(0) = (𝑎 − 𝐴)⁄𝐵 = 𝑞 ∗ and then the firm produces at constant flow 𝑞 ∗ through time.
This example adds dynamics in the neoclassical framework and shows how the firm reaches its
optimum with time if it does not be in it, see Fig. 1a where 𝑞 ∗ = 1000. Notice the faster convergence
in the time path that starts closer to equilibrium. In Fig. 1b is displayed three paths from the “old
equilibrium” 𝑞 ∗ = 1000 to the “new equilibrium” 𝑞 ∗ = (150 − 20)⁄0.08 = 1625 that results when
𝑎 changes from 100 → 150. Notice the faster convergence with smaller “inertial mass”. Thus, the
model explains how the firm enters from one equilibrium to another, and the unrealistic instantaneous
adjustment – assumed in the static neoclassical theory – is obtained with 𝑚 → 0.

Suppose next 𝑎 − 𝐴 > 0 and 𝐵 < 0. Then 𝑞 ∗ < 0. Because 𝑞(0) ≥ 0 then 𝐻0 > 0, and a positive
exponential time trend exists in 𝑞(𝑡). Thus, 𝑎 − 𝐴 > 0 with increasing returns to scale leads to an
exponential growth in 𝑞(𝑡) of the profit-seeking firm. Then a positive equilibrium flow of production
does not exist and 𝑞 ∗ corresponds to the minimum profit, see Fig. 2a where 𝑞 ∗ = −20. The
equilibrium in Eq. (9) is obtained letting 𝑡 → −∞, even though 𝑞(𝑡) < 0 is not meaningful in
economics. The problem here is that increasing 𝑞 makes unit costs negative, which is impossible.
To correct the problems in the unstable case, suppose the unit cost function is made of two parts:
𝑔(𝑞(𝑡)) = {

90 − (0.5⁄2) 𝑞(𝑡), 0 < 𝑞(𝑡) ≤ 200,
20 + (0.08⁄2)𝑞(𝑡),
𝑞(𝑡) > 200.

The two parts represent two phases of the production process. The decreasing unit cost part takes
place in the beginning of the process, and unit costs start to increase when 𝑞 > 200 (𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡⁄𝑦). The
flow of production according to Eq. (9) is displayed in Figs. 2a,b, the cost function according to Eq.
(5) in Figs. 3a,b, and the profit according to Eq. (6) in Figs. 4a,b; ℎ0 = 2000, and in the first case
𝐻0 = 20 and in the latter case 𝐻0 = −2. The optimal flow of production is 𝑞 ∗ = 1000.

5.2. Physical interpretation of the model
The “free body” diagram of the system in Eq. (8) is in Fig. 5. There “mass” 𝑚 represents the “particle”
called the accumulated production of the firm3, on the horizontal axis is accumulated production, the
direction of motion toward accumulating production is defined positive, 𝑎 − 𝐴 is the constant positive
driving force component, and 𝐵𝑞 the resisting force component that depends on the flow of
production 𝑞. In the neoclassical optimum, “particle” 𝑚 moves with constant velocity 𝑞 ∗ to the
direction where accumulated production increases. Because 𝑞 cannot be negative, the particle either
moves to the “right” in the coordinate system or stays constant if 𝑞 = 0. If 𝐵 < 0, the resisting force
component is positive, however, and then both force components affect in the positive direction of
motion. This explains why in that case the flow of production has an exponential time trend.

Figure 6. The forces acting upon a motorboat moving in water

The corresponding model in physics is e.g. that of a motorboat moving in water that causes kinetic
friction to resist the motion, see Fig. 6. The engine causes a positive force component 𝐹0 (𝑁), 𝑁 =
𝑁𝑒𝑤𝑡𝑜𝑛 = 𝑘𝑔 × 𝑚 × 𝑠 −2 , on the boat, which is assumed constant for simplicity. The engine pushes
the boat at a constant force and the kinetic friction of water causes a negative force component against
the motion. In physics, the kinetic friction of the resisting medium can be approximated by term 𝑘𝑣,
where 𝑣 = 𝑥′(𝑡)(𝑚/𝑠) is the velocity of the boat, 𝑥 its position coordinate, and 𝑘(𝑘𝑔/𝑠) a positive
constant that depends on the viscosity of the medium (water). The resisting force component is small
if 𝑣 is small and it increases linearly with the speed. If starting at rest, the acceleration of the boat is
first positive but with a constant pushing force, the speed stabilizes to a constant after reaching
condition 𝐹0 = 𝑘𝑣. In Fig. 6, we have omitted the vertical force components caused by gravitation
that add up to zero because of the buoyancy force component caused by water on the boat.
The Newtonian equation of motion for the boat is
𝐹0 − 𝑘𝑥 ′ (𝑡) = 𝑚𝑏 𝑥 ′′ (𝑡) ⇔ 𝐹0 − 𝑘𝑣(𝑡) = 𝑚𝑏 𝑣 ′ (𝑡),

(10)

where 𝑥 ′ (𝑡) = 𝑣(𝑡) and 𝑚𝑏 is the mass of the boat. The solution of the latter form of Eq. (10) gives
the velocity of the boat as a function of time as follows
𝑣(𝑡) =

𝐹0
𝑘

+ 𝐶0 𝑒

−

𝑘
𝑡
𝑚𝑏

.

(11)

In Eq. (11) the equilibrium velocity is 𝑣 ∗ = 𝐹0 ⁄𝑘 , and depending on the initial condition, the
positivity or negativity of 𝐶0 , 𝐶0 = 𝑣(0) − 𝐹0 ⁄𝑘 , the speed has either positive or negative
acceleration toward the equilibrium velocity. This model is identical with that in Eq. (8) if
𝑞(𝑡) = 𝑣(𝑡), 𝑚 = 𝑚𝑏 , 𝑎 − 𝐴 = 𝐹0 , 𝐵 = 𝑘.
Thus, the mathematical form of the dynamic model about the production of a profit-seeking firm is
identical with that of a particle moving in a resisting medium. Notice that the increasing returns to
scale case in the boat example corresponds to 𝑘 < 0, and then the boat has two pushing force
components. This would correspond e.g. to a situation where the boat is moving down a river that
flows faster than the boat. Then water pushes the boat forward and does not cause kinetic friction.
The motion of the boat decreases to zero, exponentially, beginning at time moment 𝑡1 , if the pushing
𝐹 , 𝑡 ≤ 𝑡1
force is { 0
with 𝑘 > 0 (notice that setting 𝐹0 < 0 after 𝑡1 would speed up the stopping
0, 𝑡 > 𝑡1
process). This kind of force could happen e.g. due to running out of gasoline at 𝑡1 . This corresponds
to exponential decrease in the flow of production, i.e. the bankruptcy of the firm, if the driving force
of production vanishes or gets negative, i.e. 𝑎 ≤ 𝐴 with 𝐵 > 0.

5.3. Dynamics of production due to technological change or changing wealth
We showed in the previous section that increasing returns to scale does not create permanent growth
in the flow of production, because the benefits of decreasing unit costs with increasing 𝑞(𝑡) vanish
before obtaining zero unit costs. Thus, we need other reasons to explain the permanent growth of a
firm or its bankruptcy. Let the firm in the previous section have the sales and cost functions as
𝑝(𝑡) = 𝑎 +

where constant 𝑐 with unit € × 𝑦⁄𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡 represents the change in popularity of this product with time
among consumers; 𝑐 > 0 implies increasing popularity and vice versa. Constant 𝐺 with unit
€ × 𝑦⁄𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡 represents technological development so that 𝐺 > 0 makes unit costs decreasing with
time and vice versa. More complicated time trends are possible, of course, but they will complicate
the resulting Newtonian equation. Suppose 𝑐, 𝐺 ≠ 0 and 𝐵 > 0. The Newtonian equation is then

where 𝐻0 is the constant of integration. Eq. (14) shows that independent of the sign of 𝐻0 , the
exponential time trend vanishes with time (𝐵 > 0). However, the linear time trend (𝑐 + 𝐺)𝑡⁄𝐵 keeps
𝑞(𝑡) changing so that 𝑐 + 𝐺 > 0 causes a positive time trend, and vice versa. Thus, either increasing
popularity of the good among consumers or a technological progress keep 𝑞(𝑡) increasing with time.
Here we have to make the same remark as with increasing returns to scale; technological development
cannot make unit costs negative, i.e. in this case too unlimited growth is not possible. However, no
limit exists for consumers’ behavior, and if consumers’ wealth or the popularity of this product
increase continuously (𝑐 > 0), permanent growth in the flow of production will result.
On the other hand, 𝑐 + 𝐺 < 0 will cause the firm into bankruptcy with time, and the time moment of
bankruptcy can be solved from Eq. (16) setting 𝑞(𝑡) = 0. No analytic solution exists for the time
moment of bankruptcy, however, but we can show by numerical methods that increases in constants
𝑎, 𝑚, 𝑐, 𝐺, 𝐵 increase the survival time of the firm when it is going into bankruptcy (𝑐 + 𝐺 < 0, 𝐵 >
0), while increasing 𝐴 diminishes the survival time. We can test these results by observing the time
trends of the sales of firms and their unit costs, if necessary data exists.

6. Conclusions
We introduced a dynamic framework for modeling a firm’s production that can explain besides
equilibrium also growth and bankruptcy. We defined the “economic force” acting upon the
production of a profit-seeking firm, and the model yields the neo-classical theory as a special case:
zero-force situation in a stable case. The mathematical form of the model for the production of a firm
turned out to be identical with Newton’s model of a particle moving in a resisting medium. However,
in physics a plenty of tools to model dynamic phenomena has been invented that may be applicable
in other sciences too. This creates a great potential for the development of economics.
