The phenomenological mathematical model of COVID-19 spreading is proposed for large countries
with geographical differentiation of population density. According to the model COVID-19 spreading
takes the form of several spatio-temporal waves developing almost independently and simultaneously
in areas with different population density. The intensity of each wave is described by a power-law
dependence. The parameters of dependence are determined by real statistical data at the initial
stage of the disease spread. The results of the model simulation were verified using statistical data
for the Republic of Belarus. Based on the developed model, a forecast calculation was made at the
end of May, 2020. The accuracy of forecasting the total number of cases for a period of 3 months
in the proposed approach was about 3%.

INTRODUCTION

Predicting the spread of the coronavirus COVID-19 is
one of the most challenging problems for the relevant
scientific communities of medics, mathematicians and
physicists [1, 16]. An accurate forecast allows to correctly
allocating available resources to effectively withstand the
epidemic [9, 18]. It is impossible to predict the spreading of COVID-19 with absolute accuracy. However, forecasting can be improved by adjusting the mathematical
models used and comparing the forecasting data with the
actual situation.
A characteristic feature of the development of the epidemic situation in some of countries was a long plateau
in the number of new cases of the COVID-19 disease
or a slow decrease in daily cases in April-May 2020 [3].
This was observed in the United States (April and May),
United Kingdom and Canada (from the beginning of
April to the middle of May), Russia (in May), Belarus
(from the last decade of April to the last decade of May),
Sweden (April and May), Indonesia (April and May),
Poland (April and May), Ukraine (April and May). To
note that this situation with long plateau is characteristic for the total epidemic indicators worldwide, when the
total number of sick people is at the level of 80-100 thousand new cases per day starting from the first decade of
April to the last decade of May.
For fast diseases, with an incubation period of several
days [11], the presence of a long plateau is not typical
situation. More typical situation is the epidemic development according to the scenario ‚Äùgrowth - peak phase decline‚Äù, when the duration of the peak phase is several
times shorter than the growth phase [5]. For the cases

under discussion, the plateau duration is comparable and
even exceeds the duration of the rapid growth phase (approx. 30 days and more). This feature raises questions
about our understanding of this phenomenon.
To the middle of spring 2020, there were reports about
the expectation of the second wave of the COVID-19
spread [5]. The development of the second epidemic wave
in many countries in the fall of 2020 is no longer in doubt.
Note that this refers to the second wave of the disease in
the same population in some time. But we consider the
phenomenon of the simultaneous propagation of several
waves in different subpopulations of the same population.
This phenomenon can explain the current situations with
long plateau. Below is presented the mathematical model
that describes this phenomenon.

I.

MATHEMATICAL MODEL

As a result of the analysis of the possible reasons of
the long plateau phenomenon, we came to the conclusion that it can be associated with regional characteristics of the nonuniform distribution of the population
density and the formation of the additional waves of the
virus decease spreading in corresponding subpopulations.
To note that in this work we do not consider well known
effect of the presence of a large number of asymptomatic
cases of a mild course of the COVID-19 [5]. In fact, such
cases are not amenable to counting and for analysis in
real epidemic situation. We will only use information
about reported cases, which are usually associated with
more severe manifestations of the disease. Using the open
statistics for the Republic of Belarus [3], we want to show
that a long plateau in this case can be described by the
simultaneous propagation of three independent waves of
a COVID-19 disease in the country.
The essence of this phenomenon, in our opinion, is as

2
follows. At the beginning of the epidemic, all countries
closed their borders. Therefore, each of the countries, including the Republic of Belarus, can be considered as a
closed and isolated human community. However, within
many countries the population density is nonuniform one.
It can be considered as quite reliable fact that a population density is one of the key factors influencing the
spread of the respiratory virus [15, 17]. In large cities
with a high density, the spread of the virus is most intense.
From the point of view of population density, the
Republic of Belarus can be divided into 3 agglomerations: 1) the Minsk city with the population density
of 5800 ppl/km2 ; 2) regional centers, where the population density is from 2400 ppl/km2 (Brest), 2600 ppl/km2
(Grodno) to 3800 ppl/km2 (Gomel), and large cities
of regional subordination (Polotsk, Orsha, Bobruisk,
Pinsk, etc.), with a population density of 2100 ppl/km2
(Polotsk) to 2950 ppl/km2 (Orsha); 3) medium and small
district centers and rural settlements with a population
density of tens to hundreds of people per square kilometer.
It is worthy to note that the average population density
for the Republic of Belarus is 46 ppl/km2 . The spread
of the virus in each of these agglomerations should occur
at its own speed, the onset of the disease in each of the
agglomerations can also be shifted in time [15]. We assume that the spread of the disease begins in the largest
city with the highest population density and then, with
a certain delay, the disease comes in an agglomeration
with a lower density. In the first approximation, it can
be considered that the disease in each of the agglomerations proceeds independently and mainly propagates
within a subpopulation. These considerations underlie
the analysis below.
Previously, we used the described mathematical
approach[4] to analyze and forecast the situation with the
dynamics of the coronavirus spreading in the Republic of
Belarus [6‚Äì8]. The essence of the analysis is to graph the
dependence of new cases of the disease on cases in the
previous day in double logarithmic coordinates (Figure
1), [6]. The authors of Ref. [4] found a general pattern
for a number of countries, namely, the power-law dependence of the number of new cases on a given day n+1 on
the number of cases on the previous one:
C(n + 1) = Œ±C(n)Œ≤ .

ence of such dependence makes it possible to determine
its parameters at the initial stage of the epidemic and to
forecast a change in the disease rate over quite long time
periods.
It can be shown[15] that the equation (1) leads to a
geometric progression, which in turn gives an analytical
expression for the number of diseased people C(n) over
time, i.e. from the number of days n from the start of
the count:
C(n) = Œ±

1‚àíŒ≤ n
1‚àíŒ≤

n

C(0)Œ≤ .

(2)

To build a forecast curve, one also needs the initial
value of the number of involved people C(0). It is usually accepted as the starting day to use the date when
the total number of cases in the country has reached a
certain level. Since the disease statistics always show significant fluctuations at the initial stage, dependence (1)
is applicable when the number of cases is about 100 people or more. Initially the parameter C(0) in our work
was determined from the condition of the minimum dispersion in approximation of the actual data in the period
from March 30 to April 24:
C(0) ‚âà 100.

(3)

As noted above, the day when the total number of
cases exceeded 100 is selected as the starting point for

(1)

Here n is the days counted from the beginning of the
spread of the epidemic disease. The reason for the good
description of the epidemic situation by relation (1) is
not fully understood. This requires additional research.
Since this relationship underlies our mathematical consideration, we called the proposed model phenomenological. The exponent Œ≤ in expression (1) and the proportionality coefficient Œ± should remain constant over time if
the intensity of social contacts and the scenarios of social
behavior in the population did not change. The pres-

our simulation. For the Republic of Belarus, this is March
30th , 2020.
The considered mathematical approach is in agreement with the logistic equation of the spreading of virus
diseases[2, 19, 20]. The equation of type (1) for the dynamics of the viral disease spread is closely related to the
classical approach based on the Verhlust logistic equation. In similar notation, this equation can be written
as[14]

Here k is the probability of transmission of the infection from the patient to a healthy person, averaged over
the entire population, b is the average number of contacts per day for the average person, N is the population size (population of the country), t is temporal variable. Note that the well-known viral disease reproductive
number R0 [13] is written in these notation as R0 = kb.
The solution of equation (4) with the initial condition
C|t=0 = C(0) is well known and has the form
C(t) =

were determined as of April 30, 2020 (equation (3.1)). Actual data are shown until May 30. Curve 1 (left ordinate) is

Then, for short times, t ‚â™ t‚àó = 1/R0 , the number of
cases should grow exponentially

Comparing equations (2) and (6) and taking into account that the small parameter is 1 ‚àí Œ≤ ‚âà 0.05, we can
establish an approximate relation between the parameters
R0 = kb ‚âà ln Œ± + (Œ≤ ‚àí 1) ln C(0),

t, n ‚â™ t‚àó .

(7)

According to the Eq. (7) an increasing in values of the
parameters Œ± and Œ≤ indicate a higher reproduction rate
in the corresponding population.
Additional data accumulated to mid-May showed a
certain deviation from the forecast curve based on the
single wave model [6, 7] (Eqs. (1), (2); Figure 2). Initially, we assumed that the observed morbidity situation
can be described more precisely if its propagation is allowed in the form of two waves. These waves independently but simultaneously arise, develop and propagate
in the two largest population agglomerations described
above. The addition of the second wave to the model well
improved the compliance between the calculation results
and the actual data in the period from 40 to 50 days from
the start of the count. But then again, a certain deviation occurred in the daily cases of the COVID-19 disease
(Figure 3). This suggested that, nevertheless, we are
dealing with three simultaneous and independent waves
in the three subpopulations described above[8].

are shown until May 30. Curve 1 (left ordinate) is forecast

The described nature of the development of three
waves of COVID-19 can be confirmed by their initial
time shift relative to each other. To obtain the numerical parameters of the model, the following algorithm was
proposed.
The characteristics of the first, most intense, wave can
be described by parameters obtained from data at the
initial stage of the development of the epidemic (March 6
- April 30). These were done in the preprint[6]. New data
and their deviation from the first forecast curve for one
propagation wave can be used to identify the parameters

4
of the second wave. For this, data from 33 to 50 days
were used[7] (Figure 3). Finally, additional data from 51
to 57 days were used to identify the parameters of the
third wave[8].
Thus, we put forward the hypothesis that the epidemic
situation with COVID-19 in the Republic of Belarus can
be described by three independent waves:
C(n) = C1 (n) + C2 (n) + C3 (n).

(8)

For the first wave, according to the above assumptions,
the following relations are true:
C1 (n + 1) = Œ±1 C1 (n)Œ≤1 .

data and actual ones on the total number of cases for the

The search for optimal parameters was carried out using the gradient method of the steepest descent [10]. The
results of the search are:
Œ±1 = 1.72(4), Œ≤1 = 0.94(9), C1 (0) = 100,

(17)

Finally, the third wave is described by similar relations:
Œ±2 = 1.72(7), Œ≤2 = 0.94(2), C2 (0) = 24, ‚àÜn2 = 25, (18)
C3 (n3 + 1) = Œ±3 C3 (n3 )Œ≤3 ,

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Thus, according to the available data and proposed
model (8) - (16), it is necessary to determine 11 parameters for the first, second and third waves: Œ±1 , Œ≤1 , C1 (0),
Œ±2 , Œ≤2 , C2 (0), ‚àÜn2 and Œ±3 , Œ≤3 , C3 (0), ‚àÜn3 . As the objective function, the standard deviation of the calculated

It is important to note that the second and third waves
are described by identical parameters Œ± and Œ≤, which are
similar in magnitude to the parameters of the first wave.
The difference is only in the third decimal place. All parameters coincide within the error of the data processing
method used. The second and third waves differ, as we
expected, with a lower initial value of the incident cases
C2 (0) = 24, C3 (0) = 9, and are characterized by a shift
of approximately 25 days and 39 days relative to the first
wave. In a first approximation, it can be assumed that
the internal patterns of the distribution of the three epidemic waves are approximately the same (parameters Œ±
and Œ≤). Waves differ only in their intensity (amplitude)
and onset time.
The results of the predictive calculation in the threewave approximation[8] by the relations (8) - (19) are presented in Figure 4. The error in our calculations is preliminary estimated at 10-15 % at time intervals of about 1

5
months. The data shown in Figures 2, 3 indicate the correctness of such estimates. In fact the forecast accuracy
is about 3% for the total number of cases and no more
than 15% for daily new cases within 3 months from the
date of the forecast. The performed forecast calculations
are valid as long as the conditions for the development of
the morbidity process correspond to the conditions under
which the initial statistics for the forecast were collected.
For a better understanding of the accuracy of various
approximations, we presented the results of consideration in the approximation of one, two, and three waves
(Figures 2, 3, 4, respectively). For clarity, the contribution of each wave is highlighted in color. As can be seen,
the most accurate is the approximation of the three-wave
model (Figure 4). From the results obtained above, we
can conclude that the puzzle of the long plateau and general behavior in COVID-19 dynamics is explained by our
phenomenological model. But the construction of such a
model requires knowledge of the regional characteristics
of the country and details of its population density.

independent waves in subpopulations with different population densities. The dynamics of each of the waves is
described by a universal power-law dependence, first discovered in Ref. [4]. The forecast calculations performed
using the proposed model on the base of statistical data
for the Republic of Belarus showed a high forecast accuracy. The model is based on limited statistical information on daily morbidity from March 6 to May 25 (total 81
points, 57 points were used for analysis). Nevertheless,
the forecast accuracy is about 3% for the total number of
cases and no more than 15% for daily new cases within
3 months from the date of the forecast.
We hope that the proposed approaches will be useful
for analysis of the pandemic situation in other countries.
It is possible that for large countries where the distance
between large cities exceeds 500-600 km (the average distance available for a one-day trip by car), the propagation dynamics of COVID-19 also will be described by the
superposition of a several simultaneous spatio-temporal
waves. The proposed approach can be applied also for
analysis of a spread of seasonal respiratory viral infections, such as influenza.

CONCLUSIONS

The phenomenological model is proposed that describes the dynamics of the spread of COVID-19 in Belarus, a country with population about 10 million people.
