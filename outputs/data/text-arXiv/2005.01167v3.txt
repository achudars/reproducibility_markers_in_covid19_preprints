Abstract
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has progressed with varying degrees of intensity
in individual countries, suggesting it is important to analyse factors that vary between
them. We study measures of ‘population-weighted density’, which capture density
as perceived by a randomly chosen individual. These measures of population density
can significantly explain variation in the initial rate of spread of COVID-19 between
countries within Europe. However, such measures do not explain differences on a
global scale, particularly when considering countries in East Asia, or looking later
into the epidemics. Therefore, to control for country-level differences in response
to COVID-19 we consider the cross-cultural measure of individualism proposed by
Hofstede. This score can significantly explain variation in the size of epidemics across
Europe, North America, and East Asia. Using both our measure of populationweighted density and the Hofstede score we can significantly explain half the variation
in the current size of epidemics across Europe and North America. By controlling
for country-level responses to the virus and population density, our analysis of the
global incidence of COVID-19 can help focus attention on epidemic control measures
that are effective for individual countries.

Introduction

Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in December 2019, over a million people have
died of the disease worldwide [41]. Given the vast human and economic cost, considerable effort has been given to understanding and modelling epidemics by the media and
scientific community [37, 6]. At this early stage, the media in particular have performed
the role of disseminating mortality data between and within countries, often through data
visualizations.
Such visualizations [37] are informally used to assess the responses and interventions
of various Governments, or the quality of their health services, and have therefore put
pressure on governments to allocate resources based on apparent differences between the
performance of countries. We caution against making such judgements based on raw data
alone without controlling for factors that may impact the rate of spread of COVID-19
and the severity of any outbreak. These factors may include: demographic variables such
as age and ethnicity, pre-existing medical conditions, patterns of mobility (i.e., travel),
and cultural factors such as voluntary mask wearing, household age profile, or patterns of
social contact. These factors exist independently of the quality of any specific Government
coronavirus response, and more formal analysis is beginning to emerge that suggests they
are important for the apparent severity of epidemics between countries [3].
Any assessment of a COVID-19 epidemic in any country must be carried out carefully,
in the context of these factors. It will be a major statistical exercise to do this properly,
considering interactions rigorously. In this article, we make a minor early contribution to
such an audit by considering one demographic factor, population density, while controlling
for cross-cultural differences that may impact country-level responses to the virus.
Population density plays a significant role in emerging infectious diseases [16, 39, 22].
The basic reproduction number (R0 ) for a zoonotic pathogen not yet fully adapted for
human-to-human transmission may in fact require sufficiently many interactions, facilitated
by population density, for an outbreak to occur [17]. This need for a sufficient density of
people susceptible to infection was apparent to those first modelling infectious disease
outbreaks nearly 100 years ago ([18]). Contemporary modelling of influenza pandemics
have utilised this framework, and subsequently employed it to model COVID-19 epidemics
([5, 6]). Of note in these models is the use of the standard measure of population density
(total number of people divided by area) applied to relatively high resolution population
data (square kilometre). This prompted us to consider two questions: does weighting
high resolution population data by the local density experienced by an average individual
improve its ability to predict epidemic growth, and could such a methodology be used to
explain the dynamics of epidemics between countries?
Regardless of what demographic variables are chosen to compare COVID-19 epidemics
between countries, the same problem will be encountered: individual countries and their
governments have responded differently to the virus. Public health interventions have

2

included: testing, contact tracing, and isolation of positive cases and their contacts; restricting public gatherings, physical distancing, mandated face mask wearing, and closures
of schools and nonessential businesses [13]. It is noticeable that such measures appear to
have been more effective in East Asian countries than Europe and North America; for
example, China has reduced cases by 90% but Italy and the USA have not replicated
this performance [29, 26]. This may be partly due to the speed with which control measures have been instigated; and in particularly, when the strongest measure, lockdowns,
have been ordered [1, 9]. Any analysis that attempts to compare country-level COVID-19
epidemics will need to control for these differences. The Oxford COVID-19 Government
Response Tracker collates these country-level responses into a ‘Stringency index’ [12]; however, whether these government responses are derived from a more fundamental difference
in cultural responses to infectious diseases has not been currently explored.
It has been hypothesised that pathogen exposure puts selection pressure on animals to
modify their behaviour, which in humans has been labelled the ‘pathogen-stress hypothesis’
[8, 7, 21]. Fincher et al. [8] hypothesised that historical pathogen prevalence could explain
variation in cross-cultural measures of individualism and collectivism. In particular, historical and contemporary pathogen prevalence was significantly negatively correlated with,
for example, the cross-cultural measure of individualism proposed by Hofstede [15], which
captures to what extent a country values individual freedom over collective benefit. This
axis between individualism and collectivism has been shown to be particularly stark between Western and East Asian countries, with the former more individualistic and the
latter more collectivist. Interestingly, countries with high individualism scores also have a
greater susceptibility to zoonotic disease outbreaks [21]. Whether these observations can
be replicated for the current COVID-19 pandemic and used to control for country-level
responses is currently an unanswered question.
We have used publicly available data to examine whether population density can explain
the burden of COVID-19 disease between countries. We first explore two methods for
rationalising the ‘lived density’ experienced by an average individual. High resolution
population data from the WorldPop data set has allowed us to calculate two measures of
population-weighted density (PWD) for multiple countries across East Asia, Europe, North
America, and US states. We investigate whether these PWD measures can explain the
initial and current stages of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, we examine whether
the Hofstede cross-cultural measure of individualism can account for variance between the
current size of COVID-19 epidemics, and subsequently use both PWD and the Hofstede
score to explain the current size of COVID-19 epidemics across a range of countries. This
analysis provides a rationale for controlling two important variables, population density
and country-level responses, when comparing epidemics between countries.

2.1

Methods
COVID-19 mortality data

We use two sets of data in this paper to measure the extent of COVID-19 in a region,
firstly a measure that captures the rate of spread early on, and secondly a measure that
captures the size of the epidemic after a period of time has passed.
The first measure examines the rate of spread early in the epidemic by choosing a
relatively small threshold value of deaths, and then comparing the number of deaths that
have occurred a fixed number of days later. For concreteness, we choose these numbers to
be 5 and 5: that is, our metric is “number of deaths that have occurred 5 days after deaths
hit 5”. In the sense of the classical SIR model [18], we anticipate that this is a phase of
unrestricted exponential growth, where we seek to compare the growth exponent. Since
this measure seeks to capture the early rate of spread, we do not believe it is appropriate
to normalize these figures by total population size, since this corresponds to a situation of
a limited number of small localized outbreaks which have not spread to the whole country.
Clearly the choice of these numbers is somewhat arbitrary: we want to choose a threshold that is large enough that daily numbers are not affected too much by random fluctuations, and to wait a long enough period for random daily effects to cancel out. However,
waiting too long means that the numbers can be affected by Government actions such as
lockdowns. Further, waiting for deaths to hit too high a level may exclude some smaller
countries. Some experimentation has shown that our results are robust to the choice of
parameters.
An alternative method would be to study the rate of growth of cases. However, such
comparison risk being distorted by the significant variation between availability of tests in
different countries early in the pandemic.
Our second measure is to consider total deaths per million 120 days after the 1st
clinically confirmed case. We are therefore measuring epidemics at a comparable stage of
their duration.
The data on COVID-19 deaths itself was obtained online. Data for European countries was taken from [31], which is itself based on ECDC data. Data for US states was
downloaded from [23]. Data for East Asian countries was also taken from [31].

2.2

Population data

We studied 30 European countries, using figures of standard population density ρS (see
Results for notation) taken from Wikipedia [40], and using the values of the non-empty
lived density ρN for each country calculated by Rae from Eurostat data, and stated in [28].
Some extremely small countries (where the size of the COVID-19 outbreak was too small
4

to achieve the threshold discussed above) were excluded from the comparison.
Additionally, we used WorldPop population count data [35] to calculate the populationweighted density ρW for these countries, using the formula (3). As described in [32, 34]
WorldPop distribution datasets are produced by disaggregating administrative-unit based
official population estimates into grid cells having a resolution of 3 arc seconds (approximately 100m at the equator) before summarizing them at 30 arc seconds (approximately
1km at the equator). To ensure comparability between countries, 2019 gridded countrybased population estimates were adjusted to match the corresponding UNPD country total
estimates [38].
We tabulate the resulting values ρN , ρW , ρS and V = ρW /ρS in Appendix A for
completeness. Additionally, in Appendix B we consider a range of other countries of
interest and provide values of their standard population density ρS (again taken from
Wikipedia [40]) and population-weighted density ρW calculated from WorldPop data [35]
in the same way.
We studied the 50 US States, using figures of standard population density ρS taken from
Wikipedia, and calculating the population-weighted density ρW ourselves, again based on
WorldPop data. Values of ρN were not available for US states, but since we found a
stronger relationship between rate of spread in Europe with ρW than with ρN (see Figures
3 and 4), in any case we prefer to focus on ρW . We tabulate the density values for US
states in Appendix C for completeness.

2.3

Hofstede individualism score

We used the values of this measure for a range of countries calculated from questionnaires
and tabulated in [15, Table 4.1].

2.4

Nomenclature of regions analysed, data processing and availability

Global regions analysed were: Western/West (Europe, USA, Canada, Israel); East Asia
and Oceania (Australia and New Zealand). Countries are listed in appendices A and B
Fits for normal or lognormal (base 10) distributions were generated using a maximum
likelihood approach, and the likelihoods compared for statistically significant differences
(see [2, Section 6.7.2]). It was observed that the initial rate of spread of COVID-19 and
later deaths per million associated with it followed a lognormal distribution, and this was
used for regression analysis. The antilog is presented on graphs to aid interpretation. All
data is available at: https://github.com/ptrckgrlnd/COVID-PWD-and-Individualism

3.1

Lived density, or population density as experienced by a random individual

First we motivate and define the various measures of population density that we use in
this paper.
Example 3.1. Consider three countries, each with 100,000 people and an area of 100km2 ,
and consider the population of each square kilometre grid square. As illustrated in Figure
1:
1. Averagia has a uniform spread of population, with 1,000 people living in each grid
square.
2. Builtupia has ten towns, each consisting of 10,000 people living in a single square
kilometre, and the remaining land is uninhabited.
3. Citia has one city, where 100,000 people live in a single square kilometre, and the
remaining land is uninhabited.

Figure 1: Schematic diagram of population in Averagia, Builtupia and Citia – see Example
3.1.
Since each standard population density is 100000/100 = 1000 people/km2 , we might
naively say that each country is equally crowded. However, if we consider the lived experience of a person in each country, it is clear that in everyday life residents of Citia would
have daily encounters with more people than in Builtupia, who in turn would have daily
encounters with more people than Averagia. Since daily encounters are likely to cause
infection events, it seems natural to imagine that COVID-19 would spread more rapidly in
6

Citia than in Builtupia, and in turn faster in Builtupia than in Averagia. We would like to
use a measure of population density that captures this, and here define two such measures.
We will consider a region of total area A, divided into M subareas of area A1 , .P
. . , AM
respectively. We will write ni for the population of the ith subarea, and write n = M
i=1 ni
for the total population of the region.
Definition 3.2. In this notation, the standard population density is

ρ S = = PM

Definition 3.3. We will refer to the non-empty lived density [28] as the same expression
normalized by the total area where some people live. That is, we write S for the set of
regions with non-zero population, and consider
P
ni
ρN = P i∈S .
(2)
i∈S Ai
Note that in comparison with the expression (1) given for ρS , the numerator is unchanged here, since removing terms which are zero does not affect the value of a sum.
Indeed, if each subarea contains at least one person then the non-empty lived density ρN
coincides with the standard population density ρS .
Definition 3.4. We will refer to the population-weighted density [4] as the sum

We can think
of this as
P
 a quadratic measure because if each subarea has Ai = 1 then it

becomes ρW =
i=1 ni /n. Note that the form of this quantity is somewhat reminiscent
of the Herfindahl–Hirschman Index, which is used in economics to measure diversity of
market share (see [14] for a history of this quantity).
Remark 3.5. As described for example in [25]:
1. We can think of this population-weighted density ρW as follows: select an individual
uniformly at random from the population (with probability ni /n this will be someone
from subarea i). Then ni /Ai is the density of their local subarea. Hence, assuming
the subareas are small enough to be reasonably homogeneous, this measure represents
the expected local density, sampling by person.

7

2. In contrast, the standard population density corresponds to sampling by area. That
is, pick a point uniformly in the region (with probability Ai /A this will be a point in
subarea i). Then according to this distribution, the expected local density will be
 

the standard population density ρS .
We return to Example 3.1, where recall that each country had standard population density ρS = 1000. Considering the square kilometre grid squares as the subareas, note that
that the non-empty lived density ρN of Averagia, Builtuipia and Citia is 100000/100 =
1000 people/km2 , 100000/10 = 10000 people/km2 and 100000/1 = 100000 people/km2
respectively. In fact, calculation shows that the same three values hold for the populationweighted density ρW in these cases (though this will not be true in general).
For exam

ple, for Builtupia, there are 10 non-zero terms in the sum of nni Anii , each equal to
(1/10)(10000/1), giving 10000 overall.
Notice that ρS , ρN and ρW are all measured in the same units, namely people/km2 ,
meaning that it is legitimate to compare them. It turns out that the three measures are
always ordered in the same way for every region:
Lemma 3.6. For any region, the three measures satisfy
ρS ≤ ρN ≤ ρW ,
with equality in the first inequality if and only if all the areas have non-zero population,
and with equality in the second inequality if and only if all the areas of non-zero population
have the same density.
Proof. The fact that ρS ≤ ρN is clear, since the two expressions both have the same
numerator n, but the non-empty lived density has a smaller denominator since the sum
is taken over a smaller range. Clearly, equality holds if and only if the denominators are
equal.
The fact that ρN ≤ ρW is more subtle, but can be proved using the Cauchy-Schwarz
inequality. Recall that we write S for the set of areas of non-zero population, then use the
fact that

and rearrange, using the fact that the value of ρW is unchanged if we restrict to a sum over
i ∈ S (since terms with ni = 0 do not contribute to the sum). Equality holds if and only
if each populated subarea has the same density, that is if ni /Ai does not depend on i for
each i ∈ S.
8

Indeed, a version of the same argument shows that if we partition a subarea into smaller
subareas (by obtaining more finely grained population and area data) then the populationweighted density ρW does not decrease, and will strictly increase unless all the new subareas
have the same density. In other words, the maximum value of ρW for a region is obtained
by breaking it into small homogeneous subareas.
Definition 3.7. For a given region we define the variability coefficient V = ρW /ρS . Note
that this is a dimension-free quantity.
From Lemma 3.6, we know that V ≥ 1 for any region. This ratio measures the extent
to which population is evenly distributed in a region; returning to the toy Example 3.1,
notice that Averagia has V = 1, Builtupia has V = 10 and Citia has V = 100. These
values may help calibrate our understanding of the values of V observed for actual regions.

3.2

Population density analysis of Western countries

First, since we have values for all three measures ρS , ρN and ρW for a range of European
countries, we compare how well each measure explains the rate of spread of COVID-19.

Figure 2: Simple linear regression analysis of rate of COVID-19 spread against standard
population density ρS for European countries. Both axes are on a log scale. n = 30, dashed
lines represent 95% CI.
In Figure 2 we plot the correlation between the rate of COVID-19 spread and the
standard population density ρS for European countries. However, the r2 of 0.20 is relatively
9

low and the p-value of 0.131 means a lack of statistical significance. In contrast, for the
rate of spread and the respective lived density measures, the effect is stronger than for
the corresponding plot for ρS . In Figure 3 we see a significant correlation between rate
of spread and ρN for Europe (r2 = 0.26 and p < 0.004), and in Figure 4 we see an even
stronger effect in terms of ρW (r2 = 0.53 and p < 0.0001). Therefore, we conclude that in
each case using non-standard measures of population density reveals statistically significant
effects compared with those arising from the standard population density ρS . It appears
that the population-weighted measure ρW is of the most value in this sense, explaining
over half the variation in the rate of spread of COVID-19 across Europe.

Figure 3: Simple linear regression analysis of rate of COVID-19 spread against non-empty
lived population density ρN for European countries. Both axes are on a log scale. n = 30,
dashed lines represent 95% CI.
Having established that ρW works well to explain the variation in rates of spread among
European countries, we can perform a similar analysis for a wider range of countries.
First, we add the United States, Canada and Israel to the range of countries considered,
to emphasise that the correlation observed is not restricted to European countries. As
before, the standard density ρS does not explain a significant fraction of the correlation,
achieving r2 = 0.13, p = 0.0378 (figure not shown here for brevity).
However, in Figure 5, we show that adding these further countries still leaves a good
fit between ρW and the number of deaths 5 days after the 5th death. Further, we show
that this early rate of spread is crucial in determining the ultimate scale of the epidemic,
by shading each point according to the number of deaths per million 120 days after the
1st case. It is striking that generally the countries with the highest final death tolls are
positioned to the right-hand side of the graph, indicating that they are typically those with

large population-weighted densities.

Limitations of population density: US states

Next, we perform a similar analysis for the US states, to confirm analysis of [30] who found
a statistically significant effect for population-weighted density ρW .

a) standard density ρS b) population-weighted density ρW . Plots are on a log-log scale.
n = 50, dashed lines represent 95% CI.
As shown in Figure 6, the population-weighted density does indeed provide a statistically significant effect (r2 = 0.12, p = 0.016). However it is striking that in this case, in
contrast to the case of European countries, the standard density ρS explains more of the
12

variation (r2 = 0.42, p < 0.0001).
In particular, we can observe from Figure 6 that there is surprisingly little variability in
the values of ρW calculated. For example, even extremely sparsely-populated states such as
Alaska and Wyoming (with standard density ρS ≤ 2) have a population-weighted density
ρW between 800 and 1100, comparable with denser states such as Georgia (ρS = 68) and
Indiana (ρS = 71).

Figure 7: Values of standard deviation observed for US states, shaded according to the
deaths per million 120 days after the 1st confirmed case in each state
We can understand this better by studying the standard deviation of the population
values ni within grid squares in a state. If the squares all have area of one square kilometer,
then calculation in the spirit of Remark 3.5 shows that since the expected value of ni is
ρS , the variance of ni satisfies
Var(ni ) = ρS ρW − ρ2S ,
√
so that the standard deviation is ρS V − 1, meaning it captures a combination of standard
density and variability.
In Figure 7 we plot the values of standard deviation for each state in alphabetical order,
with points shaded according to their deaths per million 120 days after the first confirmed
case in each state. It is striking to observe that high values of this standard deviation
measure correctly identify the states with highest numbers of deaths - with the majority,
however, having similar values for standard deviation and deaths per million.

The Hofstede measure of individualism can control for countrylevel differences in the response to COVID-19

Population-weighted density could not explain variation in the early or late stages of
COVID-19 epidemics between multiple East Asian countries (data not shown). However,
population-weighted density was able to significantly explain the number of deaths per
million 120 days after the 1st confirmed case across a global collection of countries including both Western and East Asian countries but the variance explained was relatively low
(r2 = 0.14, p = 0.0075). This lack of explanatory power for population density (either ρS or
ρW ) is particularly noticeable as multiple East Asian countries have very high population
densities. For example, Singapore with a population-weighted density of 21,925 and Hong
Kong with 46,301 are far in excess of any Western country. As both pre- and peri-pandemic
responses to new and emerging infectious diseases could be affected by cultural differences
we investigated the explanatory power of the Hofstede individualism score, which has been
correlated with historical pathogen exposure [8, 7, 21]

Figure 8: Simple linear regression analysis shows the Hofstede measure of individualism
explains the global variation in deaths per million 120 days after the 1st confirmed COVID19 case (green = Asian countries, blue = Western). n = 41, dashed lines represent 95%
CI.
As can be seen in Figure 8, the Hofstede measure of individualism significantly explains
variation in the number of deaths 120 days after the 1st clinically confirmed COVID-19
case across multiple Western and East Asian countries.
One possible criticism of the individualism measure in this context is that the green
and blue points are somewhat separated in Figure 8, and so this score may be serving as a
14

proxy for other factors that give the difference between Western and East Asian countries.
However, we observed that the Hofstede individualism score can control for country-level
responses when examining the role of population density in explaining variation in COVID19 epidemic sizes across Western countries late in the ongoing pandemic. For example,
Figure 9 shows that individualism can improve the fit of deaths per million across Western
countries. A multiple linear regression based on both population-weighted density ρW and
the Hofstede individualism score shows that both these variables are statistically significant
in this context, and together give R2 = 0.46 when considering deaths per million 120 days
after the 1st confirmed COVID-19 case (which is considerably higher than the r2 = 0.27
achieved in this context by ρW alone).

confirmed COVID-19 case and a combination of the Hofstede individualism score (Ind)
and population-weighted density ρW (PWD) for Western countries. n = 33.

Discussion

Country-level comparisons have been used to assess government responses to the COVID19 pandemic. For these comparisons to be useful, they must be done using carefully
controlled analysis. This study is an early contribution to this effort which focuses on
population density. We find that the initial rate of spread of COVID-19 across Western
countries can be readily explained by their population-weighted density. PWD does not
appear to be as crucial for the spread of COVID-19 in East Asia, or for explaining the size of
current epidemics recorded across multiple countries. However, controlling for country-level
responses using the Hofstede cross-cultural measure of individualism allows a substantial
15

proportion of the variance in the size of current COVID-19 epidemics across Western
countries to be explained.
PWD can be seen to more readily explain the initial rate of COVID-19 spread by
examining individual countries as plotted in Figure 4. For example, Spain has one of the
quickest rates of COVID-19 spread yet its standard population density ρS = 93 people/km2
is relatively low; in contrast, Spain has one of the highest lived non-empty population
densities in Europe, with a value of ρN = 737 people/km2 , and one of the highest PWD,
with ρW = 4980 people/km2 . As discussed in detail in [28], much of Spain is unpopulated,
with very high density populations in Barcelona and Madrid. As a result, other than three
very small countries (Monaco, Andorra and Malta, not studied here because of the size of
their epidemics), Spain is one of the most densely populated countries in Europe, which
our measure of population density captures.
Also of note, are countries whose rate of spread is as predicted by their PWD despite popular perception about their relative performance. For example, Germany has a
population-weighted density ρW = 1641 people/km2 — lower than Sweden or Ireland (see
Appendix A) — reflecting the fact that its population is fairly evenly distributed across
the country (giving its relatively low value V = 7). Considering Germany’s PWD, it may
be unnecessary to postulate the existence of an ‘immunological dark matter’ to explain the
current size of its epidemic [33]. In fact, from Figure 4 the European country which stands
out for having a significantly slower spread than expected is Greece, which has a very high
population-weighted density. This may be due to its high stringency national response
[12], which is particularly interesting as it has one of the lowest Hofstede individualism
scores within Europe [15, Table 4.1].
Our observation that standard population density ρS but not PWD ρW predicts the
rate of COVID-19 spread across US states was unexpected. We can observe from Figure 6b
that there is surprisingly little variability in the values of ρW calculated. The fit observed
in Figure 6a due to standard population density ρS comes through sparsely-populated
states such as Alaska and Wyoming, with the remainder of the states forming a relatively
homogenous cluster. It is striking that New York, the state with the fastest rate of spread,
has a significantly higher value of ρW than any other state, whereas is not an outlier in
terms of ρS , indicating the importance of ρW in this context. These observations combined
suggest that the lived population density experienced by many Americans is similar; this
hypothesis is supported by the observation that the standard deviations for population
density within US states as plotted in Figure 7 are also similar. It may be possible that
other factors such as mobility (i.e., travel between states) affect the rate of COVID-19
spread within the USA; as has been observed, for example, in China [19]. Although, for
epidemic management, there is still value in observing that US states with the highest
PWD, like New York, are, as predicted, those with quickest rate of COVID-19 spread. For
the USA as a whole, the Hofstede measure of individualism was found to accurately predict
its current epidemic size relative to other less individualistic countries. Why might this
cross-cultural axis between individualism and collectivism explain variation in COVID-19?
16

As argued by Fincher and Thornhill [7], collectivism has a two-fold benefit in protecting
societies against pathogens. The first is greater attention to in-group vs out-group members, which can limit contact with out-group members either in general or during disease
outbreaks; and the second is increased social pressure to conform to group priorities over
individual rights. These are culture-wide attitudes and we hypothesise that the Hofstede score can be used as a proxy for both government-level responses and everyday social
pressure to perform prosocial behaviour. At the level of government, these differences in
cultural values may have impacted how quickly and strongly control measures were put in
place to limit the spread of COVID19 [12]. For example, limiting travel within and between countries for both nationals and non-nationals, widespread population surveillance
to identify infected individuals and their contacts, and quarantining infected individuals
and anyone they have come into contact with; in contrast, in more individualistic countries
governments have been slow to restrict individual rights and less comprehensive [12, 13].
At the level of everyday individual conduct the ability of a society to enforce prosocial
behaviour (e.g., symptom vigilance and self isolation, mask wearing, hand hygiene) may
impact the probability of outbreaks; for example, where they are dependent on superspreader events [20].
We have focused on population density as a default, stable variable that may impact
differences in the dynamics of epidemics between countries. What other variables might
also play a role?
Advanced age is a risk factor for severe disease and mortality following infection with
SARS-CoV-2 [24, 42]. Considering immunosenescence and ‘inflamm-aging’ are known features of advanced age, it is possible that industrialised countries with aging populations may
have sufficient densities of immunocompromised people to promote outbreaks of zoonotic
pathogens initially ill adapted to human-to-human transmission [10, 11, 39]). And in terms
of country comparisons, age has been a factor impacting relative differences in mortality
[3].
At the country-level and in the absence of physical distancing measures, mobility has
a significant impact on the spread of COVID-19 ([19]). The degree to which this factor
has impacted the international spread of COVID-19 has yet to be formally investigated.
However, two countries noticeably absent from our analysis may give possible insight to
this question. Although Australia and New Zealand only marginally reduce the variance
explained for the initial rate of spread of COVID-19 amongst Western countries (r2 = 0.47,
p < 0.0001), these two highly individualistic countries are outliers in the global comparison
of deaths per million using the Hofstede score (r2 = 0.41, p < 0.0001). Compared to
the UK, for example, AUZ and NZ have 4-fold and 10-fold less international arrivals,
respectively, per year [36]. Therefore, it may be the case that the international connectivity
of countries such as the UK has played an important role in the size of its epidemic [27].

Conclusion

This study attempts to robustly control one demographic variable, population density, so
that relative differences in the spread of COVID-19 between countries can be compared.
By highlighting where and when this factor has contributed to the spread of COVID-19, we
believe this study can contribute to the discussion about which epidemic control measures
are suitable for which countries. In general, shielding immunocompromised people living
at relatively high density, for example the elderly in care facilities, should be essential.
Other control measures exist over different time-scales. For example, in the short-term
highly internationally connected countries such as the UK and USA should limit travel.
However, in the long-term these two countries, as well as others across the West, should
discuss democratically how to respond to new and emerging infectious diseases rapidly
while preserving individual rights. As the prospect of a second wave of COVID-19 is likely
[43], both the short and long term, however, are now and soon.
