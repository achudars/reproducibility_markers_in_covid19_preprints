ABSTRACT
The objective of this study is to examine the transmission risk of COVID-19 based on cross-county population co-location
data from Facebook. The rapid spread of COVID-19 in the United States has imposed a major threat to public health, the
real economy, and human well-being. With the absence of effective vaccines, the preventive actions of social distancing,
travel reduction and stay-at-home orders are recognized as essential non-pharmacologic approaches to control the infection
and spatial spread of COVID-19. Prior studies demonstrated that human movement and mobility drove the spatiotemporal
distribution of COVID-19 in China. Little is known, however, about the patterns and effects of co-location reduction on
cross-county transmission risk of COVID-19. This study utilizes Facebook co-location data for all counties in the United States
from March to early May 2020 for conducting spatial network analysis where nodes represent counties and edge weights
are associated with the co-location probability of populations of the counties. The analysis examines the synchronicity and
time lag between travel reduction and pandemic growth trajectory to evaluate the efficacy of social distancing in ceasing the
population co-location probabilities, and subsequently the growth in weekly new cases across counties. The results show that
the mitigation effects of co-location reduction appear in the growth of weekly new confirmed cases with one week of delay. The
analysis categorizes counties based on the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and examines co-location patterns within
and across groups. Significant segregation is found among different county groups. The results suggest that within-group
co-location probabilities (e.g., co-location probabilities among counties with high numbers of cases) remain stable, and social
distancing policies primarily resulted in reduced cross-group co-location probabilities (due to travel reduction from counties with
large number of cases to counties with low numbers of cases). These findings could have important practical implications
for local governments to inform their intervention measures for monitoring and reducing the spread of COVID-19, as well as
for adoption in future pandemics. Public policy, economic forecasting, and epidemic modeling need to account for population
co-location patterns in evaluating transmission risk of COVID-19 across counties.

Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a pandemic which threatens public health, the economy, and human
well-being1, 2 . As of 18 May 2020, more than 4.7 million people worldwide have been infected, with 1.5 million cases being
confirmed in the United States3 . In fact, United States has suffered the greatest number of confirmed cases in the world. Given
the absence of effective vaccines and drugs, non-pharmacologic measures are essential to control the spread of COVID-19 in
the United States4 .
Social distancing is one non-pharmacologic interventions adopted to reduce the transmission of COVID-195 . In particular,
state and local governments in the United States have issued stay-at-home orders, discouraged air travel, and closed non-essential
businesses6 . Schools, from preschool through higher education have closed, with most classes resuming from electronic
platforms. These measures were enacted in an effort to reduce person-to-person contact and its resulting close contact of people
from different regions. Existing studies have demonstrated that cross-region travel drives the spatiotemporal distribution of
COVID-197, 8 . Modeling of travel restrictions in the most heavily affected regions was projected to be successful in slowing
overall epidemic progression and reducing the transmission of the SARS-COV-2 virus in China9 . In addition, recent studies have
proposed and tested multiple mathematical disease-spread models, such as susceptible-infectious-recovery (SIR) model10, 11 and
its derived models12–16 , and the global epidemic and mobility model (GLEAM)17 , to evaluate the trajectories of virus spread and
the effectiveness of intervention measures. Travel reduction, however, is not always well accounted for in the United States18 .

Due to the varying awareness of transmission risks, people in different regions may respond to the COVID-19 pandemic in
different manners. The variation of cross-county population co-location and travel reduction may lead to inadequate outcomes,
deviate from model predictions, and even trigger the transmission of the disease in some regions. Hence, the fight against the
spread of COVID-19 requires an empirical quantitative and grounded assessment of the cross-county population co-location
patterns and effects of co-location reduction (stay-at-home order) on the transmission risks.
A large-scale, systematic analysis of the population co-location and travel reduction in the United States is now feasible
thanks to Facebook weekly co-location maps, which estimate the extent to which people from different regions are co-located
for all counties. Data from the first week of March to the first week of May 2020 is available. Facebook co-location maps enable
studying the cross-county transmission risks due to travel patterns among people from different regions, which is essential
for modeling the transmission of diseases across regions. Through quantifying the mixing patterns of people from different
regions, Facebook co-location maps offer an intuitive parametrization for calculating co-location probabilities with temporal
fluctuations over the course of COVID-19 pandemic19 (See Materials and Methods for more details).
In this study, through the transformation of Facebook co-location maps to spatial networks, we examined the transmission
risk patterns across different counties, how co-location probabilities are reduced proactively due to stay-at-home orders, and
the effect of travel reduction on the spatiotemporal transmission of COVID-19 in the United States. In our spatial network
model, nodes represent counties and the edge weights represent co-location probabilities. Accordingly, we characterized the
cross-county transmission risks based on the co-location degree centrality of each county and determined the reduction in travel
based on the reduction in the co-location degree centrality. Our analysis is based on the time series of weekly co-location
reduction and number of weekly new confirmed cases, as well as the county-level basic reproduction numbers (obtained
from estimating the parameters of the simple epidemic model based on the number of confirmed cases). We analyzed the
synchronicity between the time series using dynamic time warping and quantified the time lags between the two metrics.
Our results indicate that adherence to social distancing policy and a halt to all nonessential travel positively mitigate the
growth rate of weekly new cases (second-order growth rate) and the estimated basic reproduction number, but the mitigation
effects appeared with a one-week delay in some counties. To account for the variation in the transmission risks in different
counties, we further grouped the counties into three categories based on the size of the infected population and studied the
co-location changes and travel reduction patterns within and across groups. Highly infected (large number of infections)
counties usually have large populations, which are hotspots with greater risk of contamination. We also found segregation in
the co-location of populations among the counties in different groups, which indicates a reduction in co-location probabilities
between counties with large numbers of cases and counties with a fewer number of cases. This segregation contributed to
blocking the transmission of COVID-19 from highly infected counties to other counties. The co-location probabilities among
counties with a large number of cases, however, remained stable, which could negatively affect the ability to contain the spread
of the virus in highly infected counties.

Results
Co-location degree centrality as a metric of cross-county travel
The first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in the United States in late January 2020; the pandemic broke out in March 2020.
Fig. 1 shows the number of confirmed cases by county. Intuitively, we find that the majority of the confirmed cases are
present in counties with large population sizes and population densities. It is also evident that the number of confirmed cases
grew rapidly during March and April as awareness and testing capacity increased. With the increased awareness of the virus
transmission risks, many state and local governments started to issue the stay-at-home order in mid-March6 . Accordingly, travel
was drastically reduced during late March and April.
Facebook co-location data can inform about the patterns of reduced travel between people from different pairs of counties.
Fig. 1 visualizes the co-location probability for each pair of counties in the U.S. Since calculation of co-location probability
takes into account the population size of a county (see Materials and Methods for details), the co-location probability between
two metropolitan areas is relatively low. The high co-location probabilities tend to appear on the edges between two contiguous
counties in rural or sparsely populated areas, such as the counties in the Midwest. In addition, we can observe that co-location
probabilities decreased over time as the COVID-19 outbreak in the continued to grow.
To characterize the travel connections of a county with other counties, we adopted the degree centrality concept from
network science to aggregate the co-location probability for each county (See Materials and Methods)20 . Degree centrality
indicates the extent to which people in a county have contact with people from other counties through cross-county travel.
As the virus is usually transmitted by human contact, the higher the co-location degree centrality of a county, the higher the
probability that the novel coronavirus would be transmitted to or from other counties. The reduction in degree centrality can
reflect the reduction of travel across the counties. As a part of social distancing, travel reduction contributed to the mitigation
of virus transmission. Hence, this study focuses on examining the fluctuations in degree centrality of counties to enable a

quantitative assessment of social distancing and its relationship with the spatiotemporal transmission risk of COVID-19 in the
U.S.
To quantify the severity of COVID-19 in U.S. counties, we used the number of confirmed cases for each county from
the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (see Materials and Methods). Since the Facebook co-location
data was computed weekly, to be consistent, we also calculated the cumulative confirmed cases by week. The outcomes of
disease transmission include not only the number of confirmed cases, but also new cases confirmed each week, which is usually
characterized by the basic reproduction number, first-order growth rate, and second-order growth rate. The basic reproduction
number (R0 ) is defined as the expected number of secondary cases generated by a single infection in a completely susceptible
population21 . The basic production number is the epidemic threshold of the transmission of a pandemic and can be reduced
through measures such as social distancing. We estimated R0 based on a simple epidemic model and the growth of confirmed
cases over time. (See Materials and Methods). The first-order growth rate in this study is defined as the number of weekly
new cases in each county, which is affected by the number of confirmed cases which become the infection sources and by
the population contacts which could expedite the transmission process. The first-order growth rate is further driven by the
second-order growth rate which is defined by the changes of first-order growth rate (weekly new cases). Population travel
would increase the co-location transmission probability, basic reproduction number, and further boost the number of weekly
new cases.
Fig. 2 shows the time series of all metrics adopted in this study. We can see that the co-location degree centrality decreased
dramatically in March and remained low in April, while the number of cases increased in March and April. The weekly
new confirmed cases (first-order growth rate) increased in March, peaked in early April, and decreased slightly in late April.
The change in the weekly new cases is quantified by the second-order growth rate (fourth column in Fig. 2). In March, the
second-order growth rate increased rapidly but decreased and even dropped below zero in mid- and late April. The basic
reproduction number grew along with the increase in cases at the early stages of the outbreak, but decreased following the
reduction of the degree centrality. These observations raise two important questions regarding the temporal relationships
between the reduction of co-location degree centrality: the second-order growth rate, and the basic reproduction number.
Understanding these relationships could be beneficial for capturing the effect of population and travel reduction (stay-at-home
orders) on the dynamics of the infection growth and for developing effective non-compulsory measures and epidemic models.

co-location relationship between two counties. The size of a node is proportional to the number of confirmed cases in a county;
the width of an edge is proportional to the co-location probability of two counties.

Time lag between travel reduction and second-order growth rate
To explore the effect of travel reduction on the growth of weekly new cases in counties, we examined the relation between
co-location degree centrality and the second-order growth rate. Based on observations drawn from Fig. 2, we found that when
co-location degree centrality decreased to its lowest level, the second-order growth rate dropped and fluctuated around zero.
This result raises an important phenomenon about the synchronicity and time lags between these two variables.
To quantify the temporal relationship between co-location degree centrality and the second-order growth rate, we identified
the week when the degree centrality first reached to its lowest point, and the week when the second-order growth rate first
reached to a value below zero for a county. By comparing these two timestamps, we can capture the time lags between reduction
of travel and the reduction of weekly new cases for a county. Fig. 3 shows the distribution of the time lags for all US counties
along with the number of confirmed cases on 31 March 2020 and the population size of each county. We can discern that the
mean of the time lag in which the co-location degree centrality reached the lowest value prior to the first negative second-order

outliers and are not included. (Statistics of the time lags: mean: 0.6, median: 1.0, variance: 2.9, 95% confidence interval: [0.53,

growth rate is 0.6 weeks, and medium time lag is 1 week. That means, in most counties, the reduction of co-location degree
centrality had a delayed effect on the reduction of new weekly cases. In the counties with the greatest number of cases, however,
the reduction of degree centrality had no delays (Fig. 3a). That is, the week when the degree centrality reached the lowest
value is the same week when the second-order growth rate became negative. The result implies that the reduction of population
co-location has a synchronic effect on the growth of weekly new cases in the majority of severely infected counties but is more
likely to have a one-week lag in other counties. By further associating the population size of the counties with the time lags, we
found that, with few exceptions, the time lags can be captured by population size of a county (Fig. 3b). The majority of counties
with large populations tend to have synchronic or one-week lagged association between travel reduction and the growth of
weekly new cases. Nevertheless, some counties with high population but a small number of cases could have negative growth
of weekly new cases prior to the time when the degree centrality reached to its lowest. This pattern might be explained by
proactive local social distancing measures in those counties.

Time lag between travel reduction and the estimated basic reproduction number
According to observations drawn from Fig. 2, reduction in the estimated basic reproduction number, to some extent, followed
the reduction of co-location degree centrality, but they are not completely synchronic. Quantifying time lags between these
two metrics can provide important evidence for assessing and predicting the transmissibility of the disease in counties with
susceptible populations. To this end, we employed the time-lagged cross-correlation method to examine the extent to which
the time series of travel reduction (measured by the co-location degree centrality) and the reduction of the basic reproduction
number are synchronized and the length of the time, in general, between these two metrics (see Materials and Methods for
details). In particular, in this study, we mainly focus on the synchronicity of the descending periods of these two metrics.
Fig. 4a shows the correlation coefficients and corresponding significant levels for the top 20 counties with the highest
number of confirmed cases based on the CDC reports on March 31. We found that the reduction of co-location degree centrality
has a significant positive correlation with the estimated basic reproduction number in the counties with the greatest number
of cases. The positive correlation means that the decrease in travel is associated with the decrease in the basic reproduction
number. Furthermore, the synchronicity analysis enables us to identify the time lags by moving the curve of one metric and to
find the highest correlation coefficients. By offsetting the time lags between two variables, we find that the majority of the
counties have significant positive correlation between the co-location degree centrality and the basic reproduction number
(Fig. 4b and 4c). The correlation is more significant especially in the counties with small number of infected population (Fig.
4c). These results indicate that people reduced their cross-county travel proactively when they became aware of the risks of
COVID-19 and when stay-at-home orders were issued. Then, the transmissibility of the pandemic (reflected by the estimated
basic reproduction number) reduced accordingly. But, the effect of travel reduction on decreasing the transmissibility might
appear with delays.
The length of the time lag is rather important for monitoring and tracking the effect of population co-location and travel
reduction on the transmission of COVID-19. To uncover the time lag across different counties, we also examined the distribution
of counties in terms of the time lags in Fig. 5. The results show that, the reduction of co-location degree centrality in counties
with the greatest number of infectious cases occurred about one week prior to the reduction of the basic reproduction number in
their counties. This could imply that the effects of travel reduction (stay-at-home action) would appear with about a one-week
delayed effect on the reduction of the transmissibility of the disease (basic reproduction number). On the other hand, in the

decreases prior to the decrease of basic reproduction number (indicating proactive social distancing), while negative time lag
indicates the basic reproduction number decreases prior to the decrease of degree centrality (indicates obeying stay-at-home
orders). The error bar represents the two-side 95% confidence interval. Some extreme numbers of confirmed are considered as
outliers and are not included in the analysis.

counties with a smaller number of infected populations, the occurrence of travel reduction follows an extreme case. People in
some counties with low percentages of infected populations reduced their travel proactively, but the effect of travel reduction
might appear with a delay of more than two weeks. This lag could be attributed to some other factors, such as community
spread and local contact activities. By further associating the population size of a county with the time lags, we find that
counties with the greatest population size tend to have a synchronic relationship between co-location degree centrality and the
basic reproduction number, or the co-location degree centrality might decrease one week prior to the basic reproduction number.
Hence, the population size of a county could be related to the time lags and become an indicator of the effect of travel reduction
on diminishing the basic reproduction number. The results confirm that travel reduction in counties with a high number of cases
and a large population size would be more effective in reducing the transmissibility of the disease compared to other counties.
Travel reduction and segregation across county groups
Due to the dependence of virus transmission on human travel, the spatial patterns of cross-county travel activities should be
explored. To distinguish the counties with varying infection situations, we grouped the counties into three categories: high,
medium, and low, based on the rank of the counties by the number of confirmed cases on March 31. Then, we summed up all
the edge weights connecting the counties within or across groups to evaluate the co-location probability of each county with
other counties within the same group. We found that within-group travels led to the highest co-location probability among
people from counties in the same group (Fig. 6a). In order words, people have a greater co-location probability with people
from counties with a similar number of cases. The result indicates a segregation among the counties from different groups at
different weeks during the initial onset of the outbreaks. This raises important questions: whether travel segregation across
county groups with different levels of pandemic situations is an inherent segregation pattern, and whether the pattern can be
captured by geographical segregation and population size of two paired counties.
To test the significance of the co-location segregation, for comparison, we showed the simulated results from two artificial
co-location networks generated by (i) randomly shuffling the counties’ pandemic situations in a null model; (ii) simulating
the co-location values with a gravity-based model in which the attractive attribute of a county is the population size. (See
Materials and Methods for more details.) Considering March 17 travel patterns as an example (Fig. 6b), we can observe that
the segregation (observed from the Facebook co-location data) is greater than the one produced by the null model (random
shuffle model) showing that the pattern is significant and not an artifact result. Second, the segregation is stronger than that
predicted based solely on geographic attributes (using the gravity model), indicating that the observed segregation cannot be
simply attributed to the size of population in the counties.
Due to the presence of significant co-location segregation due to travel activities, it is also necessary to examine some
attributes which vary across the three county groups and could be related to the transmission of COVID-19. In this study,
we focus mainly on three attributes: growth rate in number of weekly new cases (Fig. 7a), population size (Fig. 7b), and

co-location degree centrality (Fig. 7c). The growth rate of the infected population in a county is the average number of new
confirmed cases in the week March 17 to 24. We find that the group of counties with the highest number of confirmed cases
tend to have high growth rate (Fig. 7a). This is quite intuitive since the counties with more infected people would increase the
chances of community transmission in a county. Additionally, the group of counties with the highest number of confirmed
cases also has large populations, compared to counties with medium and low numbers of infections (Fig. 7b). Due to their
large populations, counties with the highest number of confirmed cases have low co-location degree centrality, indicating that
7/12

persons from these counties have less co-location probability than the persons from counties with smaller populations (Fig.
7c). This result, however, accounts only for cross-county travel patterns. Disease transmission should include both community
spread and travel-related cross-region transmission. This study only focuses on transmission risks among counties to reveal a
cross-country transmission risk patterns based on human travel activities.
By further comparing the travel patterns across the weeks in March and April, we found that within-group co-location was
always dominant and remained stable over time, while cross-group co-location was reduced about 50% between March 10
to March 24, and continued to decrease by 18% in the following two weeks (Fig. 6a). We also conducted a significance test
for within-group and cross-group travel reduction based on the types of the edges. Fig. 7d shows that, from the same groups,
the reduction of co-location probability on the edges connecting the counties is significantly less than the edges connecting
the counties from different groups, meaning that social distancing was not as extensively performed among people from the
counties within the same group. For example, the co-location probability among people from counties with the greatest number
of cases did not change extensively. Nevertheless, the segregation of co-location probability for counties within the same group
contributes to isolating the counties by groups so that the disease would be less likely to be transmitted from one group to
another. For example, counties with low numbers of cases have a lower transmission risk due to travel-related spread from
highly inflected counties.

Discussion
This study provides quantitative empirical evidence regarding the relationship between population co-location and travel
reduction and the spatiotemporal transmission risk of COVID-19 in the United States. using the Facebook co-location maps.
The results regarding both temporal and spatial patterns of travel reduction could provide worthy implications for epidemic
models and policies to control the transmission risk of COVID-19 and other future pandemics.
We analyzed the synchronicity between travel reduction and the growth rate of weekly new cases (second-order growth
rate) for each county, and found that travel reduction has a synchronic effect on the reduction of weekly new cases in the
counties with greatest number of cases, while showing an average one-week lag in the majority of other counties. This finding
indicates that reducing the population co-location and cross-county travel has a positive effect on reducing the growth rate
of new weekly cases. This effect is more prominent in counties with greater population size. In addition, in examining the
synchronicity between travel reduction and the estimated basic reproduction number, we also found that reduction in the basic
reproduction number tends to be synchronized to travel reduction with a one-week lag. The synchronicity is more evident in
counties with the largest population sizes. Considering these two noteworthy empirical findings, we can confirm the importance
of travel reductions, specifically in counties with large population size, in containing the growth of an epidemic. The effect of
travel reduction may not show immediately but rather gradually reveal itself with a one-week lag. Of particular note, local
governments can project the number of weekly new cases and the basic reproduction number from at least one week after the
implementation or lifting of social distancing orders to assess the effectiveness and necessity of the order. If co-location degree
centrality of a county grows after lifting social distancing orders, the growth rate of number of weekly new cases may follow.
We also investigated travel patterns among county groups and found segregation between the counties from different groups
(categories based on number of confirmed cases). In particular, within-group travel was far more prominent than cross-group
travel and did not change significantly after stay-at-home orders were issued. Such a segregated travel pattern might have
been beneficial to control the spread of COVID-19 across different groups but has potential to exacerbate the transmission in
highly infected counties. In addition, we also found that these highly infected (large numbers of infected population) counties
tend to have large population sizes and growth rates of the infected populations. These attributes enable these counties to be
hotspots which have higher risks of contamination8 . These hotspots with a high level of interaction and a higher concentration
of population become the epicenters of the pandemic spread. We also found that the counties with medium and low levels
of infected populations have even higher co-location probabilities than the counties with high levels of infected populations.
The empirical evidence regarding the existence of segregation in cross-county co-location patterns could not only inform the
epidemiologic modeling for the transmission of COVID-19, but also have practical implications. Specifically, the presence of
segregation across different county groups can enable accurate projection of the trajectory of new infection cases for purposes
of crafting policies for enforcing and relaxing travel restrictions. By comparing the travel reduction over time for different
types of edges, we found that within-group travel remains stable but cross-group travel decreased by more than 60%. The
heterogeneity of travel reduction reveals that social distancing was not well practiced for within-group travels, which potentially
could contribute to travel-related spread of the virus among populations of counties with a high number of cases. Conversely,
social distancing led to a reduction in cross-group travel, which contributes to a reduction in cross-group spread of COVID-19.
This result reveals that social distancing orders do not have a homogenous effect on travel reduction across all counties. This
phenomenon is overlooked in most mathematical models and policy-making processes.
Although the findings in this study provide useful theoretical and practical implications for disease control, a few limitations
in this study should also be noted. First, this study only analyzed the situation from March until early May 2020. As the
8/12

pandemic continues, the synchronicity analysis among the metrics in this study could be further tested and the changes under
various situations (such as business reopening and lifting of social distancing orders) can be examined. In addition, this study
relies primarily on Facebook co-location maps in which the mobility data is collected and generated based on the activities of
the Facebook users and their geographical location services. To examine the generality of this results, future studies can also
employ other data (such as mobile data) to validate the patterns identified in this study. Finally, the present study focuses on US
counties during the period preceding and following the outbreaks of COVID-19. It will be important to explore the co-location
patterns and the relationship with the cross-region epidemic spread in other countries.

Materials and Methods
Datasets and preprocessing
We collected the Facebook co-location maps spanning 10 weeks from the span 3 March to 5 May 2020. Each weekly co-location
map has about 3,000 nodes that represent the counties across the United States. These maps estimate the probability of a
randomly chosen person from two different counties being located in the same place during a randomly chosen minute
for a given week22 . Same place here roughly corresponds to a 0.6 km by 0.6 km square depending on the latitude in the
Microsoft Bing tile system23 . The co-location maps were generated on a weekly basis in which the computation of co-location
probabilities for each pair of counties are independent across the weeks, except the bounding boxes for identifying the same
places. Facebook generated the co-location maps from the mobility data of 27 million Facebook mobile app users with location
history turned on24 . Mobility data are location updates from a user’s cell phone in the form of latitude and longitude at a given
time. Facebook assigned the mobility data to counties and computed the co-location probability for each pair of counties.
The infected population data we used in this study were gathered from the COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for
Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University25 . The data were reported daily by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for all counties in the United States. The CDC data set includes the cumulative number
of confirmed cases and deaths, and the FIPS code (Federal Information Processing Standards code) of each county from late
January 2020 until early May 2020. This study looked only into the growth of confirmed cases and their spatial distribution at
the county level. Hence, we adopted the data for each week corresponding to the weeks defined by Facebook and calculated the
weekly new confirmed cases for each county. By doing so, we can obtain the time series of confirmed cases for weeks during
the period of interest and for all counties in the United States. Furthermore, the growth rate of weekly new confirmed cases can
be calculated by:
vi, j = ci, j − ci−1, j

(1)

where vi, j is the growth rate of weekly new cases (second-order growth rate) for week i, and county j, ci, j is the weekly new
cases in week i and county j.
In addition to the co-location maps and CDC data, we also included a feature of population size of each county in our
analysis. The population data are the 5-year estimates for the 3,142 counties in the United States based on 2014–2018 American
Community Survey (ACS), released recently by the US Census Bureau26 . We associated the CDC data, co-location probability,
and the population data together with the FIPS code of each county.
Co-location weighted spatial network
The spatial network studied here is converted from the weekly co-location maps. The network has about 3,000 nodes and 1
million undirected edges in the week ending 24 March 2020 during the outbreak of COVID-19. The nodes represent the US
counties with mobility data recorded by Facebook. The edges are weighted by the standardized co-location probability for each
pair of counties. With a proper assignment of weights to the edges, we can characterize cross-county transmission risks due to
travel patterns of the people in a county by computing its degree centrality, which could inform the co-location patterns of the
people in a county with people from other counties. The degree centrality27 for each node in the weighted network can be
obtained by:
n

ki =

∑ wi j

(2)

j=1

where ki is the degree centrality of node i, wi j is the weight of the edge connecting node i and node j, and N is the number of
nodes in the network G.
Estimation of basic reproduction number
Basic reproduction number (R0 ) is defined as the expected number of secondary cases produced by a single infection in a
susceptible population21 . Due to a lack of official estimation and report about this basic reproduction number, we estimated
9/12

this metric for each county based on the growth of confirmed cases using a simple epidemic model. First, we assume that an
individual infects an average of R0 new individuals after exactly a time tau (the serial interval) has passed. Then starting with
t/τ
i(0) individuals, the number of infected individuals will be i(t) = i(0)R0 28 . Hence, by taking logarithm of both sides of the
equation, R0 can be estimated by
ln R0 =

ln i(t) − ln i(0)
t/τ

(3)

Simplifying the equation with a substitution, we can obtain that
R0 = eKτ

(4)

where K = (ln i(t) − ln i(0))/t. A simple epidemic contagion model tends to assume that growth of an epidemic in the early
stages is exponential in a short period29 . Hence, we adopted CDC data from the date of interest to ten days prior to this day and
calculated the values of K for each county per day. Based on the existing studies and models on COVID-1930, 31 , we set τ to be
5.1 days. Then, we can estimate R0 for each county per day using equation (4).
Time-lagged cross correlation
The time-lagged cross-correlation enables measurement of the similarity of two time series data sets as a function of displacement
of one relative to another. This method has been widely used in signal processing and pattern recognition32 . It leverages the
time-resolved information contained in the synchronous dynamics of two variables. In this study, we used this method to
analyze the synchronicity and time lag between travel reduction and growth rate of infected population. Although we can
observe similar trends between travel reduction and growth rate of infections, these two time series variables do not change
at the same time. To offset the time lag, we incrementally shift one variable (travel reduction) and repeatedly calculate the
correlation between two variables. The formula we adopted to obtain the cross-correlation is shown as below33 :
ρXY (τ) =

E[(Xt − µX )(Yt+τ − µY )]
σX σY

(5)

where ρXY is cross-correlation for time series X and Y , τ is the displacement which can be considered as the offset of two
variables, Xt and Yt are two time series variables, µX and σX are the mean and standard deviation of the process Xt at time t,
µY and σY are the mean and standard deviation of the process Yt at time t, E[] is the expected value operator, and (Yt+τ − µY )
denotes the complex conjugate of (Yt − µY ). Here, ρXY is well defined, and its value must be in the range of [−1, 1], with 1
representing perfect positive correlation, and −1 representing perfect negative correlation. Using this function, we can identify
the offset that can maximize the cross-correlation of two time series variables.
Artificial co-location maps
To test the significance of the travel segregation patterns, we created two artificial co-location networks34 . The first artificial
network is a null model, in which the number of confirmed cases is randomized to leave only the co-location probability for
each pair of counties. To do that, we first extract a list of counties included in this study and their corresponding number of
confirmed cases on 31 March 2020. Then, we randomly shuffle the number of confirmed cases and associated the values with
each county. Using this data, we finally plot the heatmap shown in Fig. 6b.
To illustrate the difference between the empirical evidence and the one caused by population distribution, the second
artificial co-location network is generated by a gravity-based model which incorporate the population size of a county and the
distance between two counties35, 36 . We define the co-location metric value between county i and j as the dependent variable Ti j .
Then, using the population size at the attractive attribute of two counties, we can predict the Ti j with the following formula:
V µW α
(6)
dβ
where k is a scaling factor that can be estimated from the empirical data to ensure the total observed and predicted metric values
are consistent, V is the value of attractive attribute of the origin, W is the value of the attractive attribute of the destination, µ is
the parameter which controls the effect of the origin attribute, α is the parameter which controls the effect of the destination
attribute, and β is a parameter representing the effect of distance between the origin and destination.
To fit this model, we converted the equation (6) to equation (7) by taking the logarithm on both sides of the equation.
Ti j = k

ln Ti j = ln k + µ lnV + α lnW − β ln d

(7)

Then, we adopted the linear regression model to estimate the parameters: k, µ, α and β . Both on the fitted parameters, we can
compute the metric value T˜i j for any pair of counties with their population sizes and distance. Based on predicted metric value,
we can plot the heatmap as shown in Fig. 6b to examine the segregation in human travel activities.
