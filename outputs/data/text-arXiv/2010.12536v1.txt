A BSTRACT
The COVID-19 pandemic has spread rapidly worldwide, overwhelming manual
contact tracing in many countries and resulting in widespread lockdowns for emergency containment. Large-scale digital contact tracing (DCT)1 has emerged as a
potential solution to resume economic and social activity while minimizing spread
of the virus. Various DCT methods have been proposed, each making trade-offs between privacy, mobility restrictions, and public health. The most common approach,
binary contact tracing (BCT), models infection as a binary event, informed only
by an individual’s test results, with corresponding binary recommendations that
either all or none of the individual’s contacts quarantine. BCT ignores the inherent
uncertainty in contacts and the infection process, which could be used to tailor
messaging to high-risk individuals, and prompt proactive testing or earlier warnings.
It also does not make use of observations such as symptoms or pre-existing medical
conditions, which could be used to make more accurate infectiousness predictions.
In this paper, we use a recently-proposed COVID-19 epidemiological simulator
to develop and test methods that can be deployed to a smartphone to locally and
proactively predict an individual’s infectiousness (risk of infecting others) based
on their contact history and other information, while respecting strong privacy
constraints. Predictions are used to provide personalized recommendations to the
individual via an app, as well as to send anonymized messages to the individual’s
contacts, who use this information to better predict their own infectiousness, an
approach we call proactive contact tracing (PCT). Similarly to other works, we
find that compared to no tracing, all DCT methods tested are able to reduce spread
of the disease and thus save lives, even at low adoption rates, strongly supporting a
role for DCT methods in managing the pandemic. Further, we find a deep-learning
based PCT method which improves over BCT for equivalent average mobility,
suggesting PCT could help in safe re-opening and second-wave prevention.2

I NTRODUCTION

Until pharmaceutical interventions such as a vaccine become available, control of the COVID-19
pandemic relies on nonpharmaceutical interventions such as lockdown and social distancing. While
these have often been successful in limiting spread of the disease in the short term, these restrictive
measures have important negative social, mental health, and economic impacts. Digital contact
tracing (DCT), a technique to track the spread of the virus among individuals in a population using
smartphones, is an attractive potential solution to help reduce growth in the number of cases and
thereby allow more economic and social activities to resume while keeping the number of cases low.

Most currently deployed DCT solutions use binary contact tracing (BCT), which sends a quarantine
recommendation to all recent contacts of a person after a positive test result. While BCT is simple
and fast to deploy, and most importantly can help curb spread of the disease (Abueg et al., 2020),
epidemiological simulations by Hinch et al. (2020) suggest that using only one bit of information
about the infection status can lead to quarantining many healthy individuals while failing to quarantine
infectious individuals. Relying only on positive test results as a trigger is also inefficient for a number
of reasons: (i) Tests have high false negative rates (Li et al., 2020); (ii) Tests are administered
late, only after symptoms appear, leaving the asymptomatic population, estimated 20%-30% of
cases (Gandhi et al., 2020), likely untested; (iii) It is estimated that infectiousness is highest before
symptoms appear, well before someone would get a test (Heneghan et al., 2020), thus allowing them
to infect others before being traced, (iv) Results typically take at least 1-2 days, and (v) In many
places, tests are in limited supply.
Recognizing the issues with test-based tracing, Gupta et al. (2020) propose a rule-based system
leveraging other input clues potentially available on a smartphone (e.g. symptoms, pre-existing
medical conditions), an approach they call feature-based contact tracing (FCT). Probabilistic (nonbinary) approaches, using variants of belief propagation in graphical models, e.g. (Baker et al., 2020;
Satorras & Welling, 2020; Briers et al., 2020), could also make use of features other than test results
to improve over BCT, although these approaches rely on knowing the social graph, either centrally
or via distributed exchanges between nodes. The latter solution may require many bits exchanged
between nodes (for precise probability distributions), which is challenging both in terms of privacy
and bandwidth. Building on these works, we propose a novel FCT methodology we call proactive
contact tracing (PCT), in which we use the type of features proposed by Gupta et al. (2020) as inputs
to a predictor trained to output proactive (before current-day) estimates of expected infectiousness
(i.e. risk of having infected others in the past and of infecting them in the future). The challenges of
privacy and bandwidth motivated our particular form of distributed inference where we pretrain the
predictor offline and do not assume that the messages exchanged are probability distributions, but
instead just informative inputs to the node-level predictor of infectiousness.
We use a recently proposed COVID-19 agent-based simulation testbed (Gupta et al., 2020) called
COVIsim to compare PCT to other contact tracing methods under a wide variety of conditions. We
develop deep learning predictors for PCT in concert with a professional app-development company,
ensuring inference models are appropriate for legacy smartphones. By leveraging the rich individuallevel data produced by COVIsim to train predictors offline, we are able to perform individual-level
infectiousness predictions locally to the smartphone, with sensitive personal data never required to
leave the device. We find deep learning based methods to be consistently able to reduce the spread
of the disease more effectively, at lower cost to mobility, and at lower adoption rates than other
predictors. These results suggest that deep learning enabled PCT could be deployed in a smartphone
app to help produce a better trade-off between the spread of the virus and the economic cost of
mobility constraints than other DCT methods, while enforcing strong privacy constraints.
1.1

S UMMARY OF TECHNICAL CONTRIBUTIONS

1. We examine the consequential problem of COVID-19 infectiousness prediction and propose a
new method for contact tracing, called proactive contact tracing (see Sec. 2).
2. In order to perform distributed inference with deep learning models, we develop an architectural
scaffolding whose core is any set-based neural network. We embed two recently proposed
networks, namely Deep Sets (Zaheer et al., 2017) and Set Transformers (Lee et al., 2018) and
evaluate the resulting models via the COVIsim testbed (Gupta et al., 2020) (see Sec. 3.1).
3. To our knowledge the combination of techniques in this pipeline is entirely novel, and of
potential interest in other settings where privacy, safety, and domain shift are of concern. Our
training pipeline consists of training an ML infectiousness predictor on the domain-randomized
output of an agent-based epidemiological model, in several loops of retraining to mitigate
issues with (i) non-stationarity and (ii) distributional shift due to predictions made by one phone
influencing the input for the predictions of other phones. (see Sec. 3.2)
4. To our knowledge this is the first work to apply and benchmark a deep learning approach for
probabilistic contact tracing and infectiousness risk assessment. We find such models are able to
leverage weak signals and patterns in noisy, heterogeneous data to better estimate infectiousness
compared to binary contact tracing and rule-based methods (see Sec. 4)

P ROACTIVE C ONTACT T RACING

Proactive contact tracing (PCT) is an approach to digital contact tracing which leverages the rich
suite of features potentially available on a smartphone (including information about symptoms,
preexisting conditions, age and lifestyle habits if willingly reported) to compute proactive estimates
of an individual’s expected infectiousness. These estimates are used to (a) provide an individualized
recommendation and (b) propagate a graded risk message to other people who have been in contact
with that individual (see Fig. 1). This stands in contrast with existing approaches for contact tracing,
which are either binary (recommending all-or-nothing quarantine to contacts), or require centralized
storage of the contact graph or other transfers of information which are incompatible with privacy
constraints in many societies. Further, the estimator runs locally on the individual’s device, such that
any sensitive information volunteered does not need to leave the device.
In Section 2.1, we formally define the general problem PCT solves. In Section 2.2, we describe how
privacy considerations inform and shape the design of the proposed framework and implementation.
Finally, in Section 3.1, we introduce deep-learning based estimators of expected infectiousness, which
we show in Section 4 to outperform DCT baselines by a large margin.

Figure 1: Proactive contact tracing overview. Diagram showing Left: the propagation of
anonymized, graded (non-binary) risk messages between users and Inset: overview of the inference
module deployed to each user’s phone. The inference module for agent i takes in observables Oi , and
uses a pretrained predictor f to estimate that agent’s risk (expected infectiousness) for each of the
last 14 days. Anonymized selected elements of this risk vector are sent as messages to appropriate
contacts, allowing them to proactively update their own estimate of expected infectiousness.

We wish to estimate infectiousness yid of an agent i on day d0 , given access to locally observable
information Odi now on day d ≥ d0 and over the past dmax days (d0 ≥ d − dmax ) Some of the
information available on day d is static, including reported age, sex, pre-existing conditions, and
lifestyle habits (e.g. smoking), denoted gi , the health profile. Other information is measured each
day: the health status hdi of reported symptoms and known test results. Finally, Odi also includes
information about encounters in the last dmax days, grouped in edi for day d. Thus:

The information edi about the encounters from day d0 is subject to privacy constraints detailed in
Section 2.2 but provides indications about the estimated infectiousness of the persons encountered
at d0 , given the last available information by these contacts as of day d, hence these contacts try
to estimate their past infectiousness a posteriori. Our goal is thus to model the history of the
agent’s infectiousness (in the last dmax days), which is what enables the recommendations of PCT
to be proactive and makes it possible for an infected asymptomatic person to receive a warning
from their contact even before they develop symptoms, because their contact obtained sufficient
evidence that they were contagious on the day of their encounter. Formally, we wish to model
Pθ (ydi |Odi ), where ydi = (yid , yid−1 , . . . , yid−dmax ) is the vector of present and past infectiousness of
agent i and θ specifies the parameters of the predictive model. In our experiments we only estimate
conditional expectations with a predictor fθ , with ŷdi = (ŷid , ..., ŷid−dmax ) = fθ (Odi ) an estimate of
the conditional expected per-day present and past infectiousness EPθ [ydi |Odi ].
The predicted expected values are used in two ways. First, they are used to generate messages
transmitted on day d to contacts involved in encounters on day d0 ∈ (d − dmax , d). These messages

contain the estimates ŷid of the expected infectiousness of i at day d0 , quantized to 4 bits for
privacy reasons discussed in section 2.2. Second, the prediction for today ŷid is also used to form
a discrete recommendation level ζid ∈ {0, 1, ..., n} regarding the behavior of agent i at day d via a
recommendation mapping ψ, i.e. ζid = ψ(ŷid ). 3 At ζid = 0 agent i is not subjected to any restrictions,
ζid = 1 is baseline restrictions of a post-lockdown scenario (as in summer 2020 in many countries),
ζid = n is full quarantine (also the behaviour recommended for contacts of positively diagnosed
agents under BCT), and intermediate levels interpolate between levels 1 and n.
Here we make two important observations about contact tracing: (1) There is a trade-off between
decelerating spread of disease, measured by the reproduction number R, or as number of cases,4
and minimizing the degree of restriction on agents, e.g., measured by the average number of contacts
between agents. Managing this tradeoff is a social choice which involves not just epidemiology
but also economics, politics, and the particular weight different people and nations may put on
individual freedoms, economic productivity and public health. The purpose of PCT is to improve the
corresponding Pareto frontier. A solution which performs well on this problem will encode a policy
that contains the infection while applying minimal restrictions on healthy individuals, but it may be
that different methods are more appropriate depending on where society stands on that tradeoff. (2)
A significant challenge comes from the feedback loop between agents: observables Odi of agent i
depend on the predicted infectiousness histories and the pattern of contacts generated by the behavior
ζj of other agents j. This is compounded by privacy restrictions that prevent us from knowing which
agent sent which message; we discuss our proposed solution in the following section.
2.2

P RIVACY- PRESERVING PCT

One of the primary concerns with the transmission and centralization of contact information is that
someone with malicious intent could identify and track people. Even small amounts of personal data
could allow someone to infer the identities of individuals by cross-referencing with other sources,
a process called re-identification (El Emam et al., 2011). Minimizing the number of bits being
transmitted and avoiding information that makes it easy to triangulate people is a protection against
big brother attacks, where a central authority with access to the data can abuse its power, as well
as against little brother attacks, where malicious individuals (e.g. someone you encounter) could
use your information against you. Little brother attacks include vigilante attacks: harassment,
violence, hate crimes, or stigmatization against individuals which could occur if infection status
was revealed to others. Sadly, there have been a number of such attacks related to COVID-19
(Russell, 2020). To address this, PCT operates with (1) no central storage of the contact graph; (2)
de-identification (Sweeney, 2002) and encryption of all data leaving the phones; (3) informed and
optional consent to share information (only for the purpose of improving the predictor); and (4)
distributed inference which can achieve accurate predictions without the need for a central authority.
Current solutions (Woodhams, 2020) share many of these goals, but are restricted to only binary CT.
Our solution achieves these goals while providing individual-level graded recommendations.
Each app records contacts which are defined by Health Canada (2020) as being an encounter which
lasts at least 15 minutes with a proximity under 2 meters. Once every 6 hours, each application
processes contacts, predicts infectiousness for days d to dmax , and may update its current recommended behavior. If the newly predicted infectiousness history differs from the previous prediction
on some day (e.g. typically because the agent enters new symptoms, receives a negative or positive
test result, or receives a significantly updated infectiousness estimate), then the app creates and sends
small update messages to all relevant contacts. These heavily quantized messages reduce the network
bandwidth required for message passing as well as provide additional privacy to the individual. We
follow the communication and security protocol for these messages introduced by Alsdurf et al.
(2020). We note that a naive method would tend to over-estimate infectiousness in these conditions,
because repeated encounters with the same person (a very common situation, for example people
living in the same household) should carry a lower predicted infectiousness than the same number
of encounters with different people. To mitigate this over-estimation while not identifying anyone,
messages are clustered based on time of receipt and risk level as in Gupta et al. (2020).
3

The recommendations for each level are those proposed by Gupta et al. (2020), hand-tuned by behavioural
experts to lead to a reduction in the number of contacts. Full compliance with recommendations is not assumed.
4
Note that the the number of cases is highly non-stationary; it grows exponentially over time, even where R,
which is in the exponent, is constant.

M ETHODOLOGY FOR I NFECTIOUSNESS E STIMATION

3.1

D ISTRIBUTED I NFERENCE

Distributed inference networks seek to estimate marginals by passing messages between nodes of the
graph to make predictions which are consistent with each other (and with the local evidence available
at each node). Because messages in our framework are highly constrained by privacy concerns in that
we are prevented from passing distributions or continuous values between identifiable nodes, typical
distributed inference approaches (e.g. loopy belief propagation (Murphy et al., 1999), variational
message passing (Winn & Bishop, 2005), or expectation propagation (Minka, 2001)) are not readily
applicable. We instead propose an approach to distributed inference which uses a trained ML predictor
for estimating these marginals (or the corresponding expectations). The predictor f is trained offline
on simulated data to predict expected infectiousness from the locally available information Odi for
agent i on day d. The choice of ML predictor is informed by several factors. First and foremost, we
expect the input edi (a component of Odi ) to be variable-sized, because we do not know a priori how
many contacts an individual will have on any day. Further, privacy constraints dictate that the contacts
within the day cannot be temporally ordered, implying that the quantity edi is set-valued. Second,
given that we are training the predictor on a large amount of domain-randomized data from many
epidemiological scenarios (see Section 3.2), we require the architecture to be sufficiently expressive.
Finally, we require the predictor to be easily deployable on edge devices like legacy smartphones.
To these ends, we construct a general architectural scaffold in which any neural network that maps
between sets may be used. In this work, we experiment with Set Transformers (Lee et al., 2018)
and a variant of Deep Sets (Zaheer et al., 2017). The former is a variant of Transformers (Vaswani
et al., 2017), which model pairwise interactions between all set elements via multi-head dot-product
attention and can therefore be quite expressive, but scales quadratically with elements. The latter
relies on iterative max-pooling of features along the elements of the set followed by a broadcasting of
the aggregated features, and scales linearly with the number of set elements (see Figure 2).
In both cases, we first compute two categories of embeddings: per-day and per-encounter. Per-day,
we have embedding MLP modules φh of health status, φg for the health profile, and a linear map
φδd for the day-offset δd = d − d0 . Per-encounter, the cluster matrix edi can be expressed as the set
d
{(rj→i
, ndj→i )}j∈Kid where j is in the set Kid of putative anonymous persons encountered by i at d,
rj→i is the risk level sent from j to i and nj→i is the number of repeated encounters between i and
(r)
(n)
j at d. Accordingly, we define the risk level embedding function φe and φe for the number of
(r)
(n)
repeated encounters. φe is parameterized by an embedding matrix, while φe by the vector

which resembles the positional encoding in (Vaswani et al., 2017) and counteracts the spectral bias of
downstream MLPs (Rahaman et al., 2019; Mildenhall et al., 2020). We tried alternative encoding
schemes like thermometer encodings (Buckman et al., 2018), but they did not perform better in
our experiments. Next, we join the per-day and per-encounter embeddings to obtain Did and Eid
respectively. Where ⊗ is the concatenation operation, we have:

Did = {φh (hdi ) ⊗ φg (gi ) ⊗ φδd (d0 − d) | d0 ∈ {d, ..., d − dmax }}

The union of Did and Eid forms the input to a set neural network fS , that predicts infectiousness:
ŷdi = fS (Oid ) where Oid = Did ∪ Eid and ŷdi ∈ Rd+max

(4)

The trunk of both models – deep-set (DS-PCT) and set-transformer (ST-PCT) – is a sequence of
5 set processing blocks (see Figure 2). A subset of outputs from these blocks (corresponding to
Did ) is processed by a final MLP to yield ŷid . As a training objective for agent i, we minimize the
Mean Squared Error (MSE) between ydi (which is generated by the simulator) and the prediction
ŷdi . We treat each agent i as a sample in batch to obtain the sample loss Li = MSE(ydi , ŷdi ) =

T RAINING P ROCEDURE

Unlike existing contact tracing methods like BCT and the NHSx contact tracing app (Briers et al.,
2020) that rely on simple and hand-designed heuristics to estimate the risk of infection, our core
hypothesis is that methods using a machine-learning based predictor can learn from patterns in rich
but noisy signals that might be available locally on a smartphone. In order to test this hypothesis
prior to deployment in the real world, we require a simulator built with the objective to serve as a
testbed for app-based contact tracing methods. We opt to use COVIsim (Gupta et al., 2020), which
features an agent specific virology model together with realistic agent behaviour, mobility, contact
and app-usage patterns. With the simulator, we generate large datasets of O(107 ) samples comprising
the input and target variables defined in sections 2.1 and 3.1. Most importantly for our prediction
task, this includes a continuous-valued infectiousness parameter as target for each agent.
We use 240 runs of the simulator to generate this dataset, where each simulation is configured with
parameters randomly sampled from selected intervals (See Appendix 5). These parameters include
the adoption rate of the contact tracing app, initial fraction of exposed agents in the population, the
likelihood of agents ignoring the recommendations, and strength of social distancing and mobility
restriction measures. There are two reasons for sampling over parameter ranges: First, the intervals
these parameters are sampled from reflect both the intrinsic uncertainty in the parameters, as well
as the practical setting and limitations of an app-based contact tracing method (e.g. we only care
about realistic levels of app usage). Second, randomly sampling these key parameters significantly
improves the diversity of the dataset, which in turn yields predictors that can be more robust when
deployed in the real world. The overall technique resembles that of domain-randomization (Tobin
et al., 2017; Sadeghi & Levine, 2016) in the Sim2Real literature, where its efficacy is well studied for
transfer from RGB images to robotic control, e.g. (Chebotar et al., 2018; OpenAI et al., 2018).
We use 200 runs for training and the remaining 40 for validation (full training and other reproducibility
details are in Appendix 5). The model with the best validation score is selected for online evaluation,
wherein we embed it in the simulator to measure the reduction in the R as a function of the average
number of contacts per agent per day. While the evaluation protocol is described in section 4, we now
discuss how we mitigate a fundamental challenge that we share with offline reinforcement learning
methods, that of auto-induced distribution shift when the model is used in the simulation loop
(Levine et al., 2020; Krueger et al., 2020).
To understand the problem, consider the case where the model is trained on simulation runs where
PCT is driven by ground-truth infectiousness values, i.e. an oracle predictor. The predictions made
by an oracle will in general differ from ones made by a trained model, as will resulting dynamics
of spread of disease. This leads to a distribution over contacts and epidemiological scenarios that
6

Preprint.

the model has not encountered during training. For example, oracle-driven PCT might even be
successful in eliminating the disease in its early phases – a scenario unlikely to occur in model-driven
simulations. For similar reasons, oracle-driven simulations will also be less diverse than model-driven
ones. To mitigate these issues, we adopt the following strategy: First, we generate an initial dataset
with simulations driven by a noisy-oracle, i.e. we add multiplicative and additive noise to the groundtruth infectiousness to partially emulate the output distribution resulting from trained models. The
corresponding noise levels are subject to domain-randomization (as described above), resulting in a
dataset with some diversity in epidemiological scenarios and contact patterns. Having trained the
predictor on this dataset (until early-stopped), we generate another dataset from simulations driven
by the thus-far trained predictor, in place of the noisy-oracle. We then fine-tune the predictor on the
new dataset (until early stopped) to obtain the final predictor. This process can be repeated multiple
times, in what we call iterative retraining. We find three steps yields a good trade-off between
performance and compute requirement.

E XPERIMENTS

We evaluate the proposed PCT methods, ST-PCT and DS-PCT, and benchmark them against: testbased BCT; a rule-based FCT Heuristic method proposed by Gupta et al. (2020)5 ; and a baseline No
Tracing (NT) scenario which corresponds to recommendation level 1 (some social distancing).
EXP1: In Figure 3, we plot the Pareto frontier between spread of disease (R) and the amount of
restriction imposed. To traverse the frontier at 60% adoption rate, we sweep through multiple values
of the simulator’s global mobility scaling factor, a parameter which controls the strength of social
distancing and mobility restriction measures. Each method uses 3000 agents for 50 days with 12
random seeds, and we plot the resulting number of contacts per day per human We fit a Gaussian
Process Regressor to the simulation outcomes and highlight the average reduction in R obtained in
the vicinity of R ≈ 1, finding DS-PCT and ST-PCT reduce R to below 1 at a much lower cost to
mobility on average. For subsequent plots, we select the number of contacts per day per human such
that the no-tracing baseline yields a realistic post-lockdown R of around 1.2 (Brisson & et al., 2020)6 .

Figure 3: Pareto frontier of mobility and disease spread: reproduction number R as a function
of mobility. In boxes, average difference +/- standard error, p-value under null hypothesis of no
difference. Note that small differences in R over time produce large changes to the number of cases.
Gist: All methods span a wide range of R values in their Pareto frontier, including values for the No
Tracing scenario which have R below 1, achieved by imposing strong restrictions on mobility (e.g.
a lockdown). However DCT methods are able to reduce R at much lower cost to average mobility.
Compared to NT, BCT has a 12% advantage in R, DS-PCT (left) 31% and ST-PCT 25% (right).
EXP2: Figure 4 compares various DCT methods in terms of their cumulative cases and their fraction
of false quarantine: the number of healthy agents the method wrongly recommends to quarantine.
5
While we did experiment with additional methods like linear regression and MLPs, they did not improve
the performance over the rule-based FCT heuristic proposed by Gupta et al. (2020).
6
To estimate this number, we use the GP regression fit in figure 3 and consider the x value for which the
mean of the NT process is at 1.2. We find an estimate at 5.61, and select only the runs yielding effective number
of contacts that lie within the interval (5.61 − 0.5, 5.61 + 0.5).

7

Preprint.

Again, all DCT methods have a clear advantage over the no-tracing baseline, while the number of
agents wrongly recommended quarantine is much lower for ML-enabled PCT. 7

Figure 4: Left: Cumulative case counts for each method, 60% adoption, 50 days, with all runs
normalized to 5.61 ± 0.5 effective contacts per day per agent. Right: Mobility restriction for the
same experiments (fraction of quarantines). Gist: For a similar number of cumulative cases to other
DCT methods (left), PCT methods impose very little mobility restriction (right), close to NT.

EXP3: In Figure 5 Left we plot the bootstrapped distribution of mean R for different DCT methods.
Recall R is an estimate of how many other agents an infectious agent will infects, i.e. even a
numerically small improvement in R could yield an exponential improvement in the number of cases.
We find that both PCT methods yield a clear improvement over BCT and the rule-based heuristic, all
of which significantly improve over the no-tracing baseline. We hypothesize this is because deep
neural networks are better able to capture the non-linear relationship between features available on
the phone, interaction patterns between agents, and individual infectiousness.

EXP4: In Figure 5 Right we investigate the effect of iterative retraining on the machine-learning
based methods, DS-PCT and ST-PCT. We evaluate all 3 iterations of each method in the same
experimental setup as in Figure 5 and find that DS-PCT benefits from the 3 iterations, while ST-PCT
saturates at the second iteration. We hypothesize that this is a form of overfitting, given that the set
transformer (ST) models all-to-all interactions and is therefore more expressive than deep-sets (DS).

at 60% adoption where the ML methods outperform the Heuristic and BCT methods proposed by
Gupta et al. (2020). Right: Iterative re-training significantly improves model performance. Upon the
second re-training, however, it seems that ST-PCT begins to overfit.

Note that the baseline no tracing method also has false quarantines, because household members of an
infected individual are also recommended quarantine, irrespective of whether they are infected.

EXP5: In Figure 6, we analyze the sensitivity of the various methods to adoption rate, which measures
what percent of the population actively uses the CT app. Adoption rate is an important parameter
for DCT methods, as it directly determines the effectiveness of an app. We visualize the effect of
varying the adoption rate on the reproduction number R. Similarly to prior work (Abueg et al., 2020),
we find that all DCT methods improve over the no-tracing baseline even at low adoptions and PCT
methods dominate at all levels of adoption.

C ONCLUSION

Our results demonstrate the potential benefit of digital contact tracing approaches for saving lives
while reducing mobility restrictions and preserving privacy, independently confirming previous reports
(Ferretti et al., 2020; Abueg et al., 2020). Of all methods in our study, we find that deep learning based
PCT provides the best trade-off between restrictions on mobility and reducing the spread of disease
under a range of settings, making it a potentially powerful tool for saving lives in a safe deconfinement.
This area of research holds many interesting avenues of future work in machine learning, including:
(1) The comparison of methods for fitting parameters of the epidemiological simulator data using
spatial information (not done here to avoid the need for GPS), (2) Using reinforcement learning to
learn (rather than expert hand-tune) the mapping from estimated infectiousness and individual-level
features (number of contacts, age, etc.)
Accurate and practical models for contact tracing are only a small part of the non-pharmaceutical
efforts against the pandemic, a response to which is a complex venture necessitating cooperation
between public health, government, individual citizens, and scientists of many kinds - epidemiologists,
sociologists, behavioural psychologists, virologists, and machine learning researchers, among many
others. We hope this work can play a role in fostering this necessary collaboration.

B ROADER I MPACT
This project is motivated by the goal of saving more lives than manual tracing or standard digital
tracing which are both putting people in only two categories. This can be achieved by providing
early graded warning of possible infectiousness, even before a person has symptoms, thanks to the
combination of risk levels propagating across smartphones and the ability to predict those risk levels
with machine learning. The potential to save lives is of huge benefit, but it must be appropriately
weighed against the costs. This kind of mobile application raises serious questions about privacy,
dignity and democracy which cannot be ignored. We contributed to a much longer paper which
considers these social impact questions at length (a full citation will be provided in the non-anonymous
version of the paper). See also (Bengio et al., 2020) on the privacy of COVID-19 tracing apps, which

is aligned with this work. We created a non-profit organization - a form of data trust - independent of
governments and corporations to manage the project, with a board which includes representatives of
civil society in addition to experts in public health, epidemiology, ethics, and machine learning, as
well as representatives of governments. This organization would disappear (along with any data) at
the end of the pandemic, and its sole mission is to protect the health, privacy and dignity of people in
accordance with the principles in the Montreal Declaration for the Responsible Development of AI.
Of note here is how these considerations have already imposed serious constraints on the information
available to the risk predictor and training procedure (see Section 2.2 above). Clearly, people who do
not have a smartphone (around 15% in our country) would not be able to receive recommendations.
This might mean that they would not be able to help prevent others in their community from being
infected by them, but they would benefit from a reduction in spread of the disease due to others
who are equipped with a smartphone and using the app. There are also hardware makers building
cheap Bluetooth devices (e.g. 5$) which could be used by such people (think especially about older
people and children, in particular, who might not be able to use a smartphone). Failing to convince
enough users to adopt the app could mean that the privacy risks taken by those who use the app
and share their data with the ML server might result in little collective benefit. To mitigate this,
the proposed app provides a coarse hotspot map functionality to Public Health by aggregating risk
statistics over a neighbourhood or small town. This would be useful even if a very small fraction of
the population (like 10%) were to use the app. Such a map would provide warnings of increasing
risk in a neighborhood even before the outbreak translates into increased hospitalizations (because
symptoms and contact information are often available long before a test result is obtained). Even at
that low level of participation, the data collected would be of great value in terms of epidemiological
modeling, i.e., to better understand the disease and its transmission, and thus guide public health
policies. Another social question of interest is whether an app like this would favor particular groups
in society, for example, the most wealthy (because they have more smartphones and possibly more
app uptake will be seen in their community). We propose that such issues be monitored by using
census data to correlate prediction error with socio-economic status and race (on a per-neighborhood
basis). If such disparities are found, then a mitigating strategy would be to reweigh (or oversample)
examples from these disadvantaged communities in order to reduce the error bias.

A PPENDIX 1: G LOSSARY OF BOLDED TERMS
Contact tracing Finding the people who have been in contact with an infected person, typically
using information such as test results and phone surveys, and recommending that they quarantine
themselves to prevent further spread of the disease.
Manual contact tracing Method for contact tracing using trained professionals who interview
diagnosed individuals to identify people that have come into contact with an infected person and
recommend a change in their behavior (or further testing).
Digital contact tracing (DCT) Predominantly smartphone-based methods of identifying individuals at high risk of contracting an infectious disease based on their interactions, mobility patterns, and
available medical information such as test results.
Binary contact tracing (BCT) Methods which use binary information (e.g. tested positive or
negative) to perform contact tracing, thus putting users in binary risk categories (at-risk or not-atrisk).
Proactive contact tracing (PCT) DCT methods which produce graded risk information to mitigate
spread of disease, thus putting users in graded risk categories (more-at-risk or less-at-risk), potentially
using non-binary clues like reported symptoms which are available earlier than test results.
Agent-based epidemiological models (ABMs) Also called individual-based, this type of simulation defines rules of behaviour for individual agents, and by stepping forward in time, contact
patterns between agents are generated in a “bottom up” fashion. Contrast with Population-level
epidemiological models.
Risk of infection Expected infectiousness, or probability of infection for a susceptible agent by an
infectious agent given a qualifying contact (15+ minutes at under 2 meters).
Contact An encounter between 2 agents which lasts at least 15 minutes with a distance under 2
meters (Health Canada, 2020).
Risk Level A version of the risk of infection quantized into 16 bins (for reducing the number of bits
being exchanged, for better privacy protection). The thresholds are selected by running the domain
randomization with separate seeds and grouping risk messages such that there are an approximately
uniform number in each bin.
Risk mapping A table which maps floating point risk scalars into one of 16 discrete risk levels.
Recommendation mapping A table of which recommendation level should be associated with
a given risk level. Each recommendation level comes with a series of specific recommendations
(e.g. "Limit contact with others", "wash hands frequently", "wear a mask when near others",
"avoid public transportation", etc) which should be shown for a given risk level. Reminders of
these recommendations may be sent via push notification more or less often depending on the
recommendation level.
Population-level epidemiological models This type of model fits global statistics of a population
with a mathematical model, typically sets of ordinary differential equations. The equations track
some statistics over time, typically counts of people in each of a few “compartments”, e.g. the number
of Infected and Recovered, and the parameters of the equations are often tuned to match statistics
collected from real data. It does not give any information about the individual-level contact patterns
which give rise to these statistics.
Compartment model (SEIR) A compartment model tracks the counts of agents in each of several
mutually-exclusive categories called “compartments”. In an SEIR model, the 4 compartments are
Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Recovered (see entries for each of these words).
15

Preprint.

Susceptible At risk of catching disease, but not infected.
Exposed or infected Infected with the disease, (i.e. potentially carries some viral load).
Infectious Carries sufficient viral load to transmit the disease to others. In real life, this typically
means that the virus has multiplied sufficiently to overwhelm the immune system.
Recovered No longer carries measurable viral load, after having been infected. In real life this is
typically measured by two successive negative lab tests.
Viral load

Viral load is the number of actual viral RNA in a person as measured by a lab test.

Effective viral load A term we introduce representing a number between 0 and 1 which we use as
a proxy for viral load. It could be converted to an actual viral load via multiplying by the maximum
amount of viral RNA detectable by a lab test.
Infectiousness Degree to which an agent is able to transmit viruses to another agent. A factor
in determining whether an encounter between a susceptible and an infectious agent results in the
susceptible agent being exposed (it is a property of the infector agent; this does not consider
environmental factors or the other agent’s susceptibility; see Transmission probability).
Attack rate

The proportion of individuals in a population who are infected over some time period.

Contamination duration How long a location remains infectious after an infected person has
visited it and shed viruses there.
Transmission probability The chance that one agent infects another during an encounter. Infectiousness of the infected agent, susceptibility of the other agent, both their behaviour (e.g. usage of
masks) and other environmental factors all play a role in determining this probability.
PCR Test Also, colloquially referred to as a lab test. In this context, this means a Polymerase Chain
Reaction (PCR) test used to amplify viral DNA samples, typically obtained via a nasopharangeal
swab.
Asymptomatic When an infected person shows no symptoms. For COVID-19, many people remain
asymptomatic for the entire course of their disease.
Incubation days The number of days from exposure (infection) until an agent shows symptoms.
In real life this is the average amount of time it takes the viral RNA to multiply sufficiently in / burst
out of host cells and cause an immune response, which is what produces the symptoms.
Reproduction number (R) The average number of other agents an agent infects, measured over a
certain window of time. We follow Gupta et al. (2020) and approximate R by computing the infection
tree and taking the ratio of the number of infected children divided by the number of parents who are
recovered infectors.
Serial interval The average number of days between successive symptom onsets (i.e. between the
incubation time of the infector and the infectee).
Generation time The number of days between successive infections (i.e. between the exposure of
the infector and the infectee). Generation time is difficult to measure directly so one can estimate it
from the serial interval.
Domain randomization A method of generating a training dataset by sampling from several
distributions, each corresponding to a different setting of parameters of a simulator. This allows to
generate a dataset which covers a potentially wide range of settings, improving generalization to
16

Preprint.

environments which may not be well covered by the simulator in any one particular setting chosen a
priori.
Oracle Predictor Baseline for the Set Transformer which uses ground-truth infectiousness levels
as "predictions". Provides an expected upper-bound performance for the predictors and can be used
to provide risk level inputs when pre-training a predictors.
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) A risk prediction model which concatenates all inputs (after
heuristically aggregating to a fixed size vector the set-valued inputs), feeds these through several
fully-connected neural network layers and is trained to predict infectiousness. See Section 5.
Set Transformer (ST) Model A risk prediction model which uses a modified set transformer to
process and attend to inputs, and is trained to predict infectiousness. See Section 5.
Deep Set (DS) Model Similar structure as the Set Transformer, but using pooling instead of
self-attention. This allows it to use less memory and compute as compared to the Set Transformer.
Heuristic (HCT) Model A rule-based method for predicting risk histories and corresponding
current behavior levels developed in Gupta et al. (2020).
Adoption rate
tion.

The proportion of the total population which uses a digital contact tracing applica-

Domain randomization The technique of varying the parameters of a simulation environment to
create a broad distribution of training data.
Re-identification The process of matching anonymous data with publicly available data so as to
determine which person is the owner.
Big brother attacks "Big brother" is a reference to the 1984 book by George Orwell where a
highly regulated government surveilled and controlled its citizenry. The term "big brother attacks"
references the idea that an organized group (e.g., state, federal, academic or financial institution) may
try to gain control of your data.
Little brother attacks Little brother attacks references the idea that potential security threats are
also posed by smaller actors like individuals, criminals, and data brokers.
Vigilante attacks Extra-judicial violence by an individual. In the context of this paper, specifically
as a result of a recommendation shown to the user or gained through other means.
Degree of Restriction Ratio between the number of people given a recommendation in the highest
level of restriction (i.e. quarantine) relative to other categories.
Global mobility scaling factor A simulator parameter enabling us to vary the amount of contacts
which may lead to infection in the simulator. It allows us to scale the mobility to simulate prelockdown or post-lockdown environments.
Auto-induced distribution shift A change in distribution of data observed by an agent or algorithm
as a result of the agent or algorithm’s actions.
Iterative re-training The process of generating data using some method in a simulator, training a
model on this data in a supervised manner, then evaluating the model in the simulator to produce
more data.
Pareto frontier The Pareto frontier is a way of evaluating a tradeoffs in a set of policies and
environments with multi-dimensional outputs (e.g., viral spread and mobility).

Figure 7: Motivating example comparing manual, binary, and proactive contact tracing: This
example shows the potential effectiveness of early warnings in controlling the spread of the infection.
Manual tracing is delayed because of the time between diagnosis and calling all contacts. Both
manual and digital contact tracing are sending late signals because they only make use of the
strongest possible signal (positive diagnosis). The proposed ML approach takes advantage of reported
symptoms and the propagation of risk signals between phones to obtain much earlier signals.

A PPENDIX 3: C OMPARISON OF APPROACH TO RELATED WORK
Epidemiological Modeling and Simulations. Given that modeling contact-tracing requires capturing past interactions, it is mathematically complicated to consider the dynamic nature of network
interactions. An agent-based model (simulator), on the other hand, gives us maximum flexibility to
incorporate real data and/or assumptions easily and emulate the effect of personalized policies (such
as resulting from the proposed app). Models with binary contagion and random-walk mobility are
ubiquitous (Stevens, 2020). The appeal of such models is their simplicity; they are easy to code, fast
to run, and can give a general picture of some aspects of disease spread. There are other models with
increasing complexity of either the mobility model, contagion model, agent demographics, or some
combination of these, e.g. (Verity et al., 2020; Vespignani et al., 2020; Wood et al., 2020; Lorch et al.,
2020; Hinch et al., 2020).
GLEAM (Global Epidemic And Mobility model) (Vespignani et al., 2020) is an off-the-shelf simulation platform for epidemics which offers mobility patterns and demographic information, and uses a
generic format for defining how a disease depends on these two things. Similarly, FRED (Framework
for Reconstructing Epidemiological Dynamics) provides an open-source, agent-based model with
realistic social networks and US demographics. JJ et al. (2013), and (Wood et al., 2020) build an
intervention-planning tool on top of this simulator. These works are comparable to our simulator
only; they do not do any contact tracing or individual risk prediction.
The work presented in (Lorch et al., 2020) and (Ferretti et al., 2020) is closely related to ours. A
detailed mobility model for interactions is presented in (Lorch et al., 2020), but the epidemiological
model of the disease is much simpler there. First, the contact graph is built based on their mobility
model. The next step is an implementation of various policy interventions by health authorities, which
includes contact tracing. This is done instead of building a contact graph that takes into account
policy interventions and contact tracing apps at an individual level. Next, most similarly to our
work, (Ferretti et al., 2020) proposes an app-based tracing and recommendations. However, their
epidemiological model is a very simple differential-equation model, and interventions for controlling
the disease are computed analytically.
Risk estimation approaches. While the applications deployed so far are based primarily on binary
contact tracing as discussed above, some probabilistic risk estimation approaches, similar to ours,
have been developed for other diseases or applications, and have begun to be applied to COVID19. For example, (Baker et al., 2020) uses the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model and
describes the dynamical process of infection propagation using the dynamical message passing
equations from (Lokhov et al., 2014); the probability of each node (person) to be in a specific state
(S,I or R) is estimated via the dynamic message-passing (DMP) algorithm, which belongs to the

family of local message-passing methods similar to belief propagation (BP) algorithm (Yedidia et al.,
2000) for estimating marginal probability distributions over the network nodes; despite BP being
only an approximate inference method, not guaranteed to converge to the correct marginals when
the underlying graphical model has (undirected) cycles, it demonstrated remarkable performance
in various applications. A similar approach based on BP was also discussed in (Murphy, 2020).
Furthermore, there are recent extensions of belief propagation approach graph neural nets (Satorras &
Welling, 2020). Also, another recent work uses Gibbs sampling and SEIR model for their test-traceisolate approach (Herbrich et al., 2020). However, such approaches typically rely on the knowledge of
the social interaction graph, which is not available in our case due to privacy and security constraints.
To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to use an approach based on detailed agent-based
epidemiological model together with a model of phone app messaging to generate simulated data for
training an ML-based predictor of individual-level risk.
Digital contact tracing for COVID-19 (Hinch et al., 2020; Hellewell et al., 2020; Aleta et al., 2020;
Grantz et al., 2020) study, either via simulations or mathematical models, the conditions under
which BCT can be effective. Toward addressing the issues with BCT, (Hinch et al., 2020) show
in simulation that using self-reported symptoms in addition to test results can greatly help control
an outbreak. Probabilistic (non-binary) approaches to the problem of contact tracing (e.g. Baker
et al. (2020); Satorras & Welling (2020); Briers et al. (2020)) typically assume full access to location
histories and contact graph, an unacceptable violation of privacy in most places in the world. As a
result, these methods are most often used for predicting overall patterns of disease spread.
Agent-Based Models as a generative process Our use of an agent-based simulator (Gupta et al.,
2020) as a generative model allows us to generate fine-grained (continuous) values for expected
infectiousness with realistic contact patterns. Most works performing probabilistic inference for
disease modeling use a simple differential equation generative model, which does not characterize
individual behaviour but rather the dynamics of transition between each of several mutually exclusive
disease states. Such models make many simplifying assumptions, such as contact patterns based on
random walks, which make them unsuitable for individual-level prediction of infectiousness; they
are typically used instead to infer latent variables such as infectiousness that would be consistent
with the population-level statistics generated by the differential equation model, and/or to predict
statistics of spread of the disease in a population, e.g. (ref, ref). While agent-based models are widely
used in epidemiological literature to model the spread of disease (see e.g. (ref) for review), to our
knowledge we are the first to use an ABM as a generative model for training a deep learning-based
infectiousness predictor.
Distributed inference and belief propagation Belief propagation in graphical models is often used
for disease spread modeling, e.g. Fan et al. (2016). Some recent works have applied this to COVID-19;
for example, Baker et al. (2020) use the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model and describe the
process of infection propagation using the dynamical message passing equations from Lokhov et al.
(2014). A work concurrent with ours follows a similar justification for modeling a latent parameter of
expected infectiousness, using an SEIR model with inference via (Herbrich et al., 2020). However,
these approaches rely on a centralized social graph or a large number of bits exchanged between
nodes, which is challenging both in terms of privacy and bandwidth. This challenge motivated our
particular form of distributed inference where we pretrain the predictor and do not assume that the
messages exchanged are probability distributions, but instead just informative input to the node-level
predictor.

ML ARCHITECTURES AND BASELINE DETAILS :
Binary contact tracing quarantines app-users who had high-risk encounters with an app-user who
receives a positive PCR test. Under BCT1, if Alice gets a positive test result, then every user who
encountered Alice within 14 days of her receiving the positive test result is sent a message which
places them in app-recommendation level 3 (quarantine) for 14 days. Formally, ζid = ψ(ŷid ) = 3.

Set Transformer Recall that in Section 3 we proposed two parameterizations of the model (DS
and ST in Figure 2). In the first proposal, we use a set transformer (ST) to model interactions between
the elements in the set Ddi ∪ Edi . We now describe the precise architecture of the model used.
The model comprises 5 embedding modules, namely: the health status embedding φhs , health profile
(r)
(n)
embedding φhp , day offset embedding φdo , risk message embedding φe and an embedding φe of
the number of repeated encounters.
The model was trained for 160 epochs on a domain randomized dataset (see below) comprising ∼ 107
samples. We used a batch-size of 1024, resulting in ∼ 80k training steps. The learning rate schedule
is such that the first 2.5k steps are used for linear learning-rate warmup, wherein the learning rate
is linearly increased from 0 to 2 × 10−4 , followed by a cosine annealing schedule that decays the
learning rate from 2 × 10−4 to 8 × 10−6 in 50k steps.
D OMAIN RANDOMIZATION
Inspired by research in hyper-parameter search (Bergstra & Bengio, 2012) and recent advances
in deep reinforcement learning (Tobin et al., 2017) we created the transformer’s training data by
sampling uniformly in the following ranges:
1. Adoption rate ∈ [30 − 60]
2. Carefulness ∈ [0.5 − 0.8]
3. Initial proportion of exposed people ∈ [0.002, 0.006]
4. Oracle additive noise ∈ [0.05 − 0.15]
5. Oracle multiplicative noise ∈ [0.2 − 0.8]
6. Global mobility scaling factor ∈ [0.3 − 0.9]
7. Symptoms dropout: likelihood of not reporting some symptoms ∈ [0.1, 0.6]
8. Symptoms drop-in: Likelihood of falsely reporting symptoms ∈ [0.0001, 0.001]
9. Quarantine dropou (test)t ∈ [0.01, 0.03]: likelihood of not quarantining when recommended
to quarantine due to a positive test
10. Quarantine dropout (household) ∈ [0.02, 0.05]: likelihood of not quarantining when recommended to quarantine because a household member got a positive test
11. All-levels dropout ∈ [0.01, 0.05]: likelihood of not following app-recommended behavior
and instead exhibit pre-pandemic behavior
