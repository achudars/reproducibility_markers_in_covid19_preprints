Abstract—In recent years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has
drawn convincing research ground as a new research topic in a
wide variety of academic and industrial disciplines, especially in
healthcare. The IoT revolution is reshaping modern healthcare
systems by incorporating technological, economic, and social
prospects. It is evolving healthcare systems from conventional to
more personalized healthcare systems through which patients can
be diagnosed, treated, and monitored more easily. The current
global challenge of the pandemic caused by the novel severe contagious respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 presents the greatest
global public health crisis since the pandemic influenza outbreak
of 1918. At the time this paper was written, the number of
diagnosed COVID-19 cases around the world had reached more
than 31 million. Since the pandemic started, there has been
a rapid effort in different research communities to exploit a
wide variety of technologies to combat this worldwide threat,
and IoT technology is one of the pioneers in this area. In the
context of COVID-19, IoT enabled /linked devices/applications
are utilized to lower the possible spread of COVID-19 to others
by early diagnosis, monitoring patients, and practicing defined
protocols after patient recovery. This paper surveys the role
of IoT-based technologies in COVID-19 and reviews the stateof-the-art architectures, platforms, applications, and industrial
IoT-based solutions combating COVID-19 in three main phases,
including early diagnosis, quarantine time, and after recovery.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The term Internet of Things (IoT) was first coined in a
presentation about implementing Radio-frequency identification (RFID) in the Protector and Gamble company by Kevin
Ashton for supply chain management [1]. IoT is an advanced
technology that can link all smart objects together within
a network with no human interactions [2]. More simply,
any object that can be connected to the internet for further
monitoring or transferring data has the opportunity to be an
IoT device [3].

In recent years, IoT has drawn convincing research ground
as a new research topic in a wide variety of academic and
industrial disciplines, especially in healthcare. The IoT revolution is reshaping modern healthcare systems, incorporating
technological, economic, and social prospects. It is evolving
healthcare systems from conventional to more personalized
healthcare systems through which patients can be diagnosed,
treated, and monitored more easily.
IoT is increasingly becoming a vital technology in healthcare systems where it can deliver lower expenses, a better
quality of services, and advanced user experiences [4]–[7]. As
a result of its wide capabilities including tracking, identification and authentication, and data collection, the exponential
growth of IoT in healthcare is expected to rise from USD 72
billion in 2020 to USD 188 billion in 2025 [2], [8].
The current global challenge of the pandemic caused by
the novel severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 presents
the greatest global public health crisis since the pandemic
influenza outbreak of 1918 [9]. According to the last report of
the World Health Organization (WHO), as of September 2020,
the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases passed 31 million
people with an approximate huge death toll number of 960,000
people [10]. This disease has similar symptoms as the flu such
as fever, cough, and fatigue, which are essential to recognize
for early diagnosis [11]. The incubation period of COVID-19
takes from 1 to 14 days. Surprisingly, a patient without any
symptoms can possibly be a transmitter of the COVID-19 virus
to others. This is when quarantining such people is necessary
[12]. Moreover, the recovery period of this disease varies and
depends on the patients age, underlying condition, etc., but
in general it can take between 6 to 41 days [13]. While this
disease has a high potential to be spread easily in comparison
with similar diseases within the coronavirus family, there are
many ongoing efforts and much research to mitigate the spread
of this virus. In this context, IoT technology has been shown
to be a safe and efficient way of dealing with the COVID-19
pandemic [14]–[16].

Our goal in this study is to determine the role of IoTbased technologies in COVID-19 and review the state-of-theart architectures, platforms, applications, and industrial IoTbased solutions combating COVID-19 in three main phases,
including early diagnosis, quarantine time, and after recovery.
Early detection and diagnosis can lead to lesser infection
and, as a result, better health services for infected patients
[17]. Quarantining confirmed or suspected cases and enforcing lockdowns can also decrease the number of COVID-19
infections by separating infected people from others. Tracking
COVID-19 patients after recovery will benefit the monitoring
of returning symptoms and the potential infectivity of these
recovered cases [18].
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section
II covers the importance of IoT during COVID-19. Section
III highlights IoT technologies along with their categories for
the phase of “Early Diagnosis.” Similarly, Section IV and
V review IoT technologies in “Quarantine Time” and “After
Recovery” phases respectively. Finally, we discuss, outline
future work, and conclude in sections VI and VII respectively.
II. I MPORTANT ROLE OF I OT IN COVID-19
Since early 2020, the world has been struggling with the
pandemic caused by the novel severe respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 by striving to control the unprecedented spread
of the virus and develop a vaccine [19]. As most efforts
to find a treatment or control the spread of the COVID-19
have not shown acceptable results so far, there is a high
demand for global monitoring of patients with symptomatic
and asymptomatic COVID-19 infection.
In recent years, IoT technology has received significant
attention in the healthcare domain where it plays an important
role in different phases of various infectious diseases [20].
In the current pandemic, as the contingency of COVID-19 is
high, there is an essential need for patients to be connected
with and monitored by their physicians proactively in different
phases of COVID-19. In this study, we investigate the role of
IoT technology in response to COVID-19 in three main phases
including early diagnosis, quarantine time, and after recovery.
During the first phase of COVID-19, which is early diagnosis [21], there is an essential need for faster diagnosis due to
the high rate of contagiousness of COVID-19 where even an
asymptomatic patient can easily spread the virus to others. The
sooner the patient is diagnosed, the better the spread of the
virus can be controlled, and the patient can receive appropriate
treatment. In fact, IoT devices can speed up the detection
process by capturing information from patients. This can be
implemented by capturing body temperatures using different
devices, taking samples from suspicious cases, and so on.
The second phase, called quarantine time [22], is an important period of this disease after the patient has been diagnosed
with COVID-19, and he or she should be isolated for the
course of treatment. IoT devices in this phase can monitor
patients remotely [23] with respect to their treatments and
stay at home orders by the authorities. They can also clean
areas without human interactions. Examples of these types are

the implementation of tracking wearable bands, disinfecting
devices, etc.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) [24], most people with mild symptoms can recover
while staying at home without getting treatments, but there
is no guarantee those people will not be reinfected after recovery. Reinfection might happen with different symptoms of
COVID-19 [25]. Concerning these possible reinfections in the
after recovery phase, the chances of returning symptoms and
the potential infectivity can be high [18]. To prevent that happening, social distancing should be implemented by deploying
IoT devices including bands, crowd monitoring devices, etc. to
track people to ensure the appropriate distance is maintained.
In short, IoT technology during the COVID-19 pandemic has
proven its usefulness in assisting patients, healthcare providers,
and authorities. In this section, we briefly explain the various
IoT devices and applications including wearables, drones,
robots, IoT buttons, and smartphone applications that are
mainly utilized in the forefront of combating COVID-19. Table
I lists the specifications of these technologies regarding this
pandemic.
A. Wearables
Wearable technologies can be defined as the combination
of electronics with anything that is able to be worn [26].
The definition presented by Juniper Research [27] describes
them as app-enabled computing technologies that receive and
process input while they are either worn or stick to the body
such as bands, glasses, watches, etc. These smart wearables
were designed for different purposes in various domains such
as healthcare, fitness, lifestyle, and so on [27]–[29]. Although
the privacy of data is still a significant issue for expanding
these devices, it is predicted that healthcare providers will
spend $20 billion annually until 2023 on wearable IoT devices
to monitor more patients [30]. IoT wearable devices cover a
wide range of different smart wearable tools such as Smart
Themormeters [31], [32], Smart Helmets [33], Smart Glasses
[34], IoT-Q-Band [35], EasyBand [36], and Proximity Trace
[37]. Table II shows all wearable devices regarding their
classification with examples.
B. Drones
Drones are simply aircraft that are flown without any or
very little human operation by remote monitoring [38]. In
1849, during a war between Italy and Austria, the first drone,
which was a balloon equipped with bombs, was used [39].
The drone is also known as an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
that works with the help of sensors, GPS, and communication
services. The implementation of IoT within drones, known as
the Internet of Drone Things (IoDT), makes it possible for
drones to do a variety of tasks such as searching, monitoring,
delivering, etc [40], [41]. Smart drones can be operated by
a smartphone and a controller with a minimum of time and
energy, which makes them efficient in different fields such
as agriculture, military, healthcare, etc. Different types of
IoT-based drones, including Thermal Imaging Drone [42],

Disinfectant Drone [43], Medical Drone [44], Surveillance
Drone [45], Announcement Drone [46], and Multipurpose
Drone [47] are used in the healthcare domain and, in particular,
in the fight against COVID-19, will be discussed in this paper.
An illustration of these types of drones, along with their
examples, can be found in Table III.
C. Robots
According to the Merriam Webster dictionary [48], a robot
is defined as “a machine that resembles a living creature in
being capable of moving independently.” As an advancement
during the emergence of networked robots within the cloud,
the Internet of Robot Things was implemented where they can
do many different tasks to make life easier [49]. Regarding the
current pandemic, robots can be categorized as Autonomous
robots [50], Telerobots [51], Collaborative robots [52], and
Social robots [53]. Table IV covers the fundamental aspects
of these robots with examples.
D. IoT Buttons
This type of IoT device is a small, programmable button
connected to the cloud through wireless communication [54].
Based on its written code on the cloud, this device can perform
different repetitive tasks by pressing only one button. For
example, one type of IoT buttons enable patients to complain
if any hospital restrooms need cleaning by pressing a button
only [55], [56]. Table V illustrates two implementations of
these button during COVID-19 phases.
E. Smartphone Applications
Smartphone applications are application software designed
to do limited tasks within a mobile device such as a smartphone [57], [58]. Since there are 3.5 billion active smartphones
in 2020, these IoT-based smartphone applications could be
very efficient in various domains such as healthcare, retail,
agriculture, etc. [59]–[62]. Many smartphone applications have
been developed for healthcare domain, and some of them
have been used in response to COVID-19, as illustrated in
Table VI, namely nCapp [63], DetectaChem [64], Stop Corona
[65], Social Monitoring [66], Selfie app [67], Civitas [68],
StayHomeSafe [69], AarogyaSetu [70], TraceTogether [71],
Hamagen [72], Coalition [73], BeAware Bahrain [74], eRouska
[75], and Whatsapp [76].
III. P HASE I: E ARLY D IAGNOSIS
The key to combating COVID-19 is to diagnose it early
to prevent spreading the virus widely. This will substantially
help healthcare providers to arrange better treatment plans,
save more lives, and reduce contamination and infections
[77]. The first step in the early diagnosis of COVID-19 is
understanding its symptoms. According to the CDC [11], as
of September 2020, COVID-19 has a wide range of symptoms
including fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, the
new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny
nose, nausea or vomiting, and diarrhea. Among them, fever or

high body temperature is one of the most common symptoms
of COVID-19 when the measured temperature exceeds 38
Degrees Celsius or 100.4 Degrees Fahrenheit [78]. IoT devices
can make the detection process faster and more efficient
by capturing data within their sensors and then analyzing
the data for patients, healthcare providers, and authorities to
diagnose, control, and ultimately stop this contagious disease
[79]. Different IoT devices can be used to capture some of
the aforementioned symptoms at an early stage, which will be
discussed in the next subsections.
A. Wearables
Using wearable devices is considered as an efficient way in
response to the need for early diagnosis during this pandemic
[80]. Developing these devices has had a remarkable impact on
the early detection of diseases. For example, a wearable IoT
device can confirm whether respiratory signs of a patient is
normal or not. With this knowledge, the patient can notice any
changes in his/her health situation and then decide to make a
medical appointment before any other symptoms appear [81].
In fact, COVID-19 pandemic might be easier to fight using
appropriate wearable devices.
1) Smart Thermometers: A wide range of IoT smart thermometers has been developed to record constant measurements of body temperatures. These low-cost, accurate, easy to
use devices could be worn or stick to the skin under clothing
[32]. They are usually offered in different forms such as touch,
patch, and radiometric [32]. The use of these devices can be
extremely helpful in the early detection of suspicious cases.
Also, since the use of infrared thermometers for capturing
body temperature can possibly spread the virus more due to
the closeness of patients and health care providers, using smart
thermometers is highly recommended [42].
According to [82], Kinsa’s thermometers have been widely
used in homes, and the producer is now able to predict the
most suspicious areas (contaminated with COVID-19) in each
state of the USA based on the recorded temperature of people
[31], [83]–[85]. Other smart thermometers such as Tempdrop,
Ran’s Night, iFever, and iSense (shown in Fig. 1) are able to
report body temperature at any time on a smartphone. Using
these devices in people’s daily lives can improve the chance
of diagnosing new patients at early stage.
2) Smart Helmet: During COVID-19 pandemic, using
wearable smart helmets with a thermal camera has shown
to be safer compared to an infrared thermometer gun due
to lower human interactions [42]. In this device, when the
high temperature is detected by the thermal camera on the
smart helmet, the location and the image of the person’s face
are taken by an optical camera. Then, they are sent to the
assigned mobile device with an alarm as shown in Fig. 2, so
that the health officer can distinguish the infected person, and
authorities can take action [33]. Additionally, Google Location
History can be incorporated with the smart helmet to find the
places visited by the suspected person after detection [86].
Countries such as China, UAE, and Italy have implemented
this wearable device to monitor crowds within two meters

smart glasses to monitor crowds [34] and the inbuilt face
detection technology makes tracking procedure easier after
detecting suspicious cases. In fact, this allows detecting the
identification of the suspicious case (person with high temperature). Additionally, Google Location History can empower
further actions with more reliability by capturing the places
visited by the suspicious case [34]. Among different smart
glasses, Rokid [88], smart glasses with infrared sensors, have
the ability to monitor up to 200 people. Another example of
this device is the combination of Vuzix smart glasses with
the Onsight Cube thermal camera (see Fig.4). These devices
work together to monitor crowds to detect people with high
temperatures and provide their information to medical centers
or authorities [93].

in early diagnosis and control of COVID-19 [95]. Using
Unmanned Ariel Vehicles (UAV) and, especially, IoT-based
drones is another common way to speed up the process of

finding contaminated people and zones during this pandemic.
Drone technology can reduce human interactions and can
reach hard-to-access locations [96]. The Thermal Imaging
Drone as shown in Fig. 5 was designed for capturing the
temperature of people in crowds and can be used in the
early diagnosis phase. This type of drone can be combined
with Virtual Reality as a wearable device to identify people
with high temperatures(fevers). This device not only reduces
human interactions, but it also uses less time compared to
thermometer gun devices [42]. One example of this device
is the Pandemic Drone application developed by a Canadian
company [97] for remote monitoring and detecting any cases
of infection by capturing temperature, respiratory signs such
as heart rate, and any sneezing or coughing [98], [99].

Examples

Phase

the first phase, it can help the process of diagnosis by collecting throat swabs samples from patients with the advantage of
preventing medical staff at risk (close contact with patients)
[50]. Fig. 6 depicts how this process works. An example of
this device, the Intelligent Care Robot, has been developed
through a partnership between two companies, Vayyar Imaging
[108] and Meditemi [109]. This device detects symptoms of
COVID-19 in 10 seconds by using touchless quick scanning
of a person within a distance of 1 meter to capture respiratory
signs and temperature [110].

C. Robots
Using robots linked to IoT to assist early diagnosis is a
remarkable use of these devices because they can help health
workers by processing patients’ treatments and lowering work
stress levels [107]. Without the interaction of humans, the
autonomous robot can help fight in all COVID-19 phases. In

IoT Button, in general, is a programmable device that can
be used for repetitive tasks. During this pandemic, IoT buttons
can play an important role in alerting the authorities or family
of a patient about any contaminated area or any emergency. For
example, an IoT button, produced by Visionstate [118], called
Wanda QuickTouch (Fig. 7), were deployed as a cleaning alert
system in hospitals. They are designed for alerting authorities
in case of any concerns related to essential sanitation or public
safety.

E. Smartphone Applications
Smartphone applications enabled with IoT using information such as Global Positioning System(GPS) and Geographic
Information System(GIS), etc. for tracking purposes have
been widely used during the COVID-19 pandemic in order

to increase the chance of detecting infected people [60].
Implementing smartphone applications using the Internet of
Medical Things (IoMT) will assist patients by providing them
proper treatments while they are home. Additionally, it enables
health care workers and authorities to monitor patients and the
spread of disease more easily. People can upload their health
information to the cloud adopted by IoT and get health advice
from hospitals online. Using this platform, patients can be
cured at home without expanding the contamination. It costs
less than having a physical appointment at hospitals and allows
the governments to take better action to manage the pandemic
in the future [120]. Since the start of the pandemic, some
smartphone applications have been developed for COVID-19
diagnosis and monitoring that will be discussed in the coming
sections.
1) nCapp: COVID-19 Intelligent Diagnosis and Treatment
Assistant Program (nCapp) was developed in China using
Internet of Medical Things on a cloud platform. This cellphone

application is an automated diagnosis system with eight functions that can be selected by the user. nCapp can automatically
generate a diagnosis report based on requested data and
questionnaires submitted by patients. Diagnosis is categorized
into three cases: confirmed, suspected, or suspicious. For the
confirmed cases, there are four conditions, including “mild,
moderate, severe, and critical, which are determined by a
physician. Special treatments for these conditions and other
types of cases are defined as well. Other positive points of
this program include updating its own database in order to
improve its diagnosis, making consultation possible for all
health workers, making sure all patients are safe in the long
term, and finally, having all these abilities publicly available.
In general, by using nCapp the diagnosis can be done faster
and the spread of disease can be controlled easier [63].
2) MobileDetect: The high demand for a system that can
identify infected people has led to the implementation of
MobileDetect app [64]. MobileDetect which is compatible
with a wide variety of smartphones is designed to detect and
control the spread of COVID-19. Using this application, users
can easily take the test at home utilizing a nasal swab. The
results of the test will show up on the smartphone application
within 10-30 minutes determining the user’s health situation
regarding COVID-19. Then, the user is able to send the results
with any additional information needed to his/her physician
or healthcare professional for further action. This smartphone
testing kit authorized by the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) under emergency access can be helpful during the first
phase of a pandemic by lowering the spread of the virus [64],
[124].
3) Stop Corona: Besides all the implementations for early
case detection, another approach is having a database of
captured daily health reports. The reports include contact with
others, symptoms, and locations. The Stop Corona application
[65] predictive heatmaps based on the disease spots. This
application collects information from its users about their
daily health status and generate report and heatmaps based
on that. The generated report will be accessible only to health
authorities. Consequently, once a user shows a new symptom
and announces it, the case will be appear on the new report
and ultimately authorities will be able to take proper action
and detect the contaminated area faster due to the reported
new symptoms.

Example

Phase

quarantine does not only apply to confirmed cases but also can
be considered for suspected patients and even different areas
or cities or countries [12]. This is done to prevent possible
transmission from suspected cases (asymptomatic cases) or
areas to others. Using IoT devices in this phase could help
mitigate serious challenges such as spreading the virus by
monitor patients efficiently and control their respiratory signs,
heart rate, blood pressure, and so on [136]–[138].
A. Wearables
Quarantine time for confirmed or suspected cases is vital
because there is a chance of spreading the virus to other people
by those cases [22]. IoT wearable bands have shown promising
results to prevent patients from leaving the quarantine areas.
Using wearable bands is a cost-effective solution for tracking
cases. This device is connected to patiences smartphone application through Bluetooth during the quarantine period and
health care authorities can usually monitor all cases every two
minutes using a web interface. Additionally, if a patient does
not have the band on his or her arm or leg, or maybe leaves the
quarantine area, an alert will be sent to notify the authorities
and they have permission to call the patient for clarification
of the situation. Fig. 8 shows a wearable band, called IoTQ-Band, workflow process. This approach has been deployed
in Hong Kong where an electronic wristband linked with a
smartphone application in order to track new arrivals at the
airports for 14 days [69], [127], [139]. Similarly, authorities in
the United States have implemented another type of this model
using electronic ankle bracelets (ankle monitors) in order to
isolate people who refuse to stay in quarantine [140], [141].

IV. P HASE II: Q UARANTINE T IME
After the process of detection, it is necessary to isolate and
then monitor the patients either in a hospital or at home. The

B. Drones
Using drones plays an important role during the quarantine
time to decrease the number of COVID-19 cases by lowering the interaction of health care workers with patients and
contaminated areas. For example, drones in this phase can
assist health care workers and patients by disinfecting areas
or delivering medical treatments to patients [142].
1) Disinfectant Drone: Keeping areas sanitized and disinfected during the quarantine period is very important, and this
can be achieved by using a particular type of drone, called
a Disinfectant Drone [101] (See Fig. 9). These drones can
reduce the contamination of the virus and also prevent health
care workers from getting infected. DJI company produced
this drone with the ability to disinfect one hundred meters in
one hour. This type of drone has also been used in Spain for
disinfecting purposes [100].
2) Medical/Delivery Drone: Medical drones have shown
their efficiency at the early stage of COVID-19 where they
transfer the COVID-19 test kits, samples, or medical supplies
between labs and medical centers to eliminate human interactions. Additionally, this type of drones usually reduce hospital
visits and increase access to medical care by delivering medical treatments to patients or another medical center rapidly.
For example, using medical drones in China and Ghana has
increased the speed of diagnosis by cutting delivery time
[102], [143]. Another type of delivery drone during COVID-19

produced by Delivery Drone Canada Inc., which can move
COVID-related goods, including test kits and swab tests [104].
This type of drone can be also used for other purposes such as
postal and grocery services while COVID-19 confirmed cases
are isolated in their homes during the quarantine time [103],
[144]. Fig. 10 illustrates a picture of this type of drone.
C. Robots
During the quarantine time phase, robots play an important
role in keeping medical staff away from isolated patients [145].
For example, robots can be used in different ways, such as
capturing respiratory signs and providing assistance to patients
with their treatments or food.

workers from being in that area [52], [116]. Another example
of this robot during this phase is the eXtremeDisinfection
robot (XDBOT) (shown in Fig. 13) which is implemented by
Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. This robot
can disinfectant hard to access areas, such as under a bed,
and also can be wirelessly operated on a mobile platform to
avoids any close contact between humans and contaminated
areas [52], [148].

Fig. 10. Medical Drone transferring medical related [96].

1) Telerobots: Telerobots are usually operated remotely by
a human and can provide different services such as remote
diagnosis, remote surgeries, and remote treatments for the
patients while there is no human interaction during the process
[146]. For example, a nurse can measure patients’ temperatures
without having interactions with them by using these robots.
Another example is daVinci surgical robot, which is operated
by a surgeon while the patient is in the safe isolation of
plastic sheeting. This helps to prevent infections by performing
surgeries remotely [51], [115]. Fig. 11 shows the actual
daVinci telerobot.

Fig. 12. Human Operated Collaborative Robots [149].

Fig. 13. XDBOT Collaborative robot operating by humans for disinfecting
contaminated areas [148].

Fig. 11. Davinci telerobot can prevent close contact between surgeon and
patient during a surgery [147].

2) Collaborative Robots: Collaborative robots, known as
Cobots (Fig. 12), are recommended robots if there is a need for
an operation performed by humans. They are not as beneficial
as telerobots for this pandemic, but during a quarantine, this
type of robot can lower health care workers’ fatigue as well
as track their interactions with patients [51]. For instance,
Asimov Robotics in India is designed for quarantine time to
help patients in isolated areas with tasks such as preparing
food and providing medication and also preventing health care

3) Autonomous Robots: Autonomous robots have been
widely used during quarantine time phase. They work with
fewer or no human interactions and can be utilized in different
scenarios in order to sterilize contaminated areas in hospitals,
carry patients’ treatments, and check their respiratory signs.
These will result in decreasing the risk of infection for the
healthcare workers while the patients are isolated in their
rooms [51], [112]. For example, the disinfection robot created
by Xenex [113] is capable of cleaning and disinfecting areas
of viruses and bacteria. Fig, 14 illustrates how the Xenex
robot breaks down the virus using UV lights. Another example
is UVD robots developed by a Danish company are used
for disinfecting hospitals with their strong UV light, which
destroys the DNA of the virus [114].
4) Social Robots: According to the CDC [151], isolating
and quarantining patients can potentially cause mental health
problems as well. To prevent this, social robots are designed to
communicate with patients during that time. The functionality

Fig. 14. Xenex Disinfecting Autonomous Robots [150].

of these robots in this pandemic is to help reduce mental
fatigue and strain during a quarantine and period of physical
distancing [51]. One example of these robots is Paro [53],
which can help patients during their isolation as a stress-relief
device, as is shown in Fig. 15.

is installed on the patients’ smartphones. Patients are required
to ask for QR (Quick Response) code every time they want
to leave home or quarantine areas. This code represents their
identification to the authorities, which allows them to monitor
patients [125]–[127].
2) Selfie app: This application was developed in Poland
integrated with Geo-location and facial recognition technology
to track patients who have been told to stay at home for
14 days. Patients can reject installing this application, but in
return, they will get unexpected visits from authorities. Using
the application, patients will be asked to send selfies randomly
on a daily basis [67], [128], [129].
3) Civitas: Civitas is a Canadian smartphone application
that has been proposed to lower COVID-19’s impact. Using
the user’s identification code, this application communicates
with the authorities to request a permit that allows the user
to leave the house. Civitas has the ability to assists suspected
cases who need to go outside to buy essential goods in a timely
manner. Furthermore, it provides a secure channel that enables
physicians to contact patients to monitor their health status
[68], [130].
4) StayHomeSafe: StayHomeSafe application is considered
as a combination of smartphone applications and wearable
devices [69]. It has been implemented in Hong Kong where
new arrivals at the airports are given a wristband that can
be paired with a smartphone in order to set the quarantine
location with the advantage of geofencing technology used by
the application [127].

D. IoT Buttons
The use of the IoT button in response to the COVID-19
pandemic can help to track patients during a quarantine. The
Sefucy IoT button [123] was originally designed for tracking
lost or missing children, but with the outbreak of COVID-19,
this IoT device has been used for emergency notifications
during a quarantine. If the health condition of a confirmed
case isolated at home gets worse, by pressing the button, a
healthcare provider will be alerted, or family members will be
notified in case of an emergency.
E. Smartphone Applications
The most critical part of a quarantine is keeping track
of patients while they are isolated. Tracking patients using
smartphones during quarantine time is another widely used
approach to mitigate and control the spread of this virus.
1) Social Monitoring: In Russia, a mandatory surveillance
application called Social Monitoring [66] has been developed
by the government to track patients who are diagnosed with
COVID-19 and have to be isolated in their homes. Using this
approach, authorities can track patients after the application

The restrictions put in place response to the COVID-19
pandemic has had a devastating effect on many businesses,
marketplaces, and economics. After months of locked down
societies and harsh restrictions, nations are gradually and
carefully opening up again. This is the phase that everyone
needs to experience with extra caution. Social distancing and
restrictions on physical services need to be implemented in the
way to make sure the virus will not spread again [152]. In this
section, we highlight the role of IoT technology in combating
the COVID-19 pandemic after lockdown.
A. Wearables
Since employers are gradually bringing workers back to
the workplaces, students are backing to schools, and the
economy is bouncing back for reopening, there should be
some protection techniques in order to keep everyone safe
from this virus. Contact tracing and social distancing are two
key points to be considered for safely reopening. Wearables are
the devices that can be utilized to trace users’ close contacts
with other people and also alert them if social distancing is
not maintained [153].
1) EasyBand: As countries gradually reopen jobs and marketplaces after the lockdown, EasyBand [36] is one of the
most effective IoT devices to make sure people are practicing
social distancing. This wearable device, which is integrated
with the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), is sensing and

Fig. 16. EasyBand process of tracking with its designed rules [36]

Fig. 18. Use of TraceTag on a hard hat [37].

capturing data from other devices. EasyBand works within a
specific radius and shows potential risk by its LED lights if
people are very close to each other. For instance, if someone
wearing an Easyband gets close to another person within 4
meters, the band will start beeping to alert both and remind
them to keep the distance from each other. This device has
shown better results compared to smartphone apps, and it can
be used without any mobile devices. Additionally, it is a costeffective device that gives people a greater sense of safety
and peace of mind. Fig. 16 represents the workflow of this
wearable. A similar example for this device is Pact wristband
[89](see Fig. 17), which alerts the closeness of people using
a vibrator and buzzer.

Fig. 19. Instant Trace worn as badge [37].

B. Drones

Fig. 17. Pact wristband for alerting and tracing [89].

2) Proximity Trace: As industrial workers are coming back
to work after the lockdown, there is an essential need for
practicing social distancing between them while they work
together. Proximity Trace [37] helps industrial workers maintain social distancing in practical ways. This device, which can
be attached to a hard hat or body, alerts workers when they
get close to each other with a loud sound. Using this device,
workers will be able to concentrate on their work without
worrying about contamination from the virus. Fig. 18 shows
how this trace can stick to the industrial workers’ hard hat.
Also, Instant Trace, shown in Fig. 19, worn as a badge has
the same functionality that helps employees to maintain social
distancing and trace the infected employee’s contacts [92].

As the pandemic enters the After Recovery phase, many
drones have been used in response to the reopening, which
helps businesses continue working in a safe manner. Increasing
social awareness by monitoring the crowds and broadcasting
information is the main purpose of implementing these devices
during this phase [154].
1) Surveillance Drone: Surveillance drone was designed
and developed as an effective way to monitor crowds in case
of people’s failure to do social distancing. MicroMultiCopter
[46] made in China and Cyient [105] from India are two
types of this drone (Fig. 20). The MicroMultiCopter drone
has also been equipped with speakers to announce important
information from the authorities which will be discussed in
the next type of drone within this phase.
2) Announcement Drone: This type of drone is mainly
designed for broadcasting in areas with low accessibility to the
Internet. For example, authorities in Spain and other European
countries used this type of drone to announce the practice
of social distancing and other guidelines with loudspeakers
[100], [106]. Kuwait is another country that used this drone
to broadcast “go home” messages to people in crowds [144]
(see Fig.21).
3) Multipurpose Drone: A multipurpose drone, called
Corona Combat, [47] has been implemented in China with
the combination of all other types of drones that can cover
all of the proposed goals mentioned in three phases at once.

of transferring data to a web interface for further monitoring.
[157]. Fig. 23 is the Spot robot for monitoring the practice of
social distancing.

C. Robots
As schools are opening, businesses are recovering, cars are
back on the roads and people are returning to their daily
commutes, the COVID-19 pandemic is turning into the next
step which is after lockdown or after recovery. In this phase,
everybody needs to know the importance of social distancing
everywhere to mitigate the spread of the virus. In response
to this phase of COVID-19, autonomous robots can be used
to control social distancing. For instance, Spot [156], a fourlegged robot designed in Singapore to be similar to a dog,
reminds people to practice social distancing in public places.
While this robot can be controlled remotely, it is also capable

The use of IoT in healthcare is now expanding, and the
major benefits are cost-effectiveness, efficient monitoring, appropriate treatment, fewer mistakes, and exceptional diagnoses
[159], [160]. Some smartphone applications have been developed specifically in response to the pandemics challenges
associated with reopening step which will be covered in this
section.
1) Aarogya Setu: Aarogya Setu [131], [132] is a contact
tracing application for people to use on their smartphones to
increase awareness of and fight against this virus. Aarogya
Setu is designed for better communication between health
service providers and people. In the application, the user will
be asked if he or she has any symptoms of COVID-19 or has
recently traveled internationally. Analyzing the input data from
the users along with their tracking information Aarogya Setu
is able to notify the user if he or she has had contact with
someone who is already or later becomes a confirmed case.
2) TraceTogether: Singapore launched an application called
TraceTogether [71] to capture data using an encrypted ID
from people who were in close contact with each other.
The captured data will not be used until a close contact
identification is established [133], [161]. This data includes
the duration of the visit and the social distance will be stored
for 21 days for contact tracing purposes in the future.
3) Hamagen: This contact tracing application was developed in Israel. Hamagen uses GPS technology to find out if
the user has been in close contact with a person who tested
positive for COVID-19. In this application, for the sake of
privacy, private data will not leave the smartphone until the
user agrees on [72].
4) Coalition: Coalition [73] uses IoT technology and
blockchain [162]–[165] platform to provide a secure contact
tracing approach. In this app, users are assigned with random

IDs so that with the detection of any new cases, the users who
were in close contact with those cases will be notified.
5) BeAware Bahrain: BeAware Bahrain is a contact tracing
application implemented in Bahrain that alerts people when
they are approaching contaminated areas with a detected
COVID-19 case or if they were in close contact with a
confirmed case. Also, this application monitors the location
of self-isolated cases for 14 days and allows users to leave
quarantine areas for testing appointments, which means this
app is also applicable for the second phase of this pandemic
[74], [134].
6) eRouska: This application monitors and captures any
close proximity between its users. If one of the users’ test
gets positive for COVID-19, eRouska will notify the others
regarding the probable infection so that they can take action
about their health situation [75].
7) Social Media - Whatsapp: As of April 2020, the world
has about 3.8 billion users on social media [166]. This number
of users creates a great opportunity to implement telemedicine
healthcare support using social media applications during this
pandemic. One of the most popular applications is Whatsapp.
This application provides this chance for patients to consult
remotely with their physicians using virtual meetings which
will lead to decreasing hospital visits by patients. Using this
method is applicable to all phases during the COVID-19
pandemic [167].
VI. D ISCUSSION AND F UTURE W ORK
COVID-19 is considered as both a global health crisis and
an international economic threat. The restrictions put in place
response to the COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating
effect on many businesses, marketplaces, economics, society
and our lives. The full health, social, and economical consequences of this pandemic and its restrictions will take time
to be fully recognized and quantified, however, there are lots
of ongoing efforts in research and industrial communities to
utilize different technologies to detect, treat, and trace the virus
to mitigate its impacts. Internet of Things (IoT) technology has
shown promising results in early detection, quarantine time,
and after recovery from COVID-19, however, as we learn
more about the virus and its behavior we should adjust and
improve our approaches in different phases. For example, it
would be interesting to integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI)
and IoT technology in order to use AI power to minimize
interactions between health care workers and patients in all
phases. Another example is using touchless technology with
the help of other inputs (such as gesture and voice) will
be efficiently lower the spread of the disease and end the
pandemic sooner [168]. Further research needs to be done
on convincing confirmed cases of COVID-19 to remain in
quarantine to mitigate the spread of the virus. Moreover, how
IoT devices can help isolated patients efficiently for their
daily life. After lockdown, as businesses and marketplaces are
opening gradually, how the IoT devices can be incorporated in
businesses to cover both safety and efficiency. Answer to those
questions will attract considerable attention in both research

and industrial disciplines and open new research avenues in
this area.
One of the main concerns about using IoT devices in
different phases of this pandemic is privacy issue where
patients are asked to share their information. Definitely, it is a
big concerns for every patients so defining secure channels for
communications or utilizing different encryption techniques
before sharing private information would be a possible research area.
Having IoT-enabled Smart cities can be extremely helpful
in combating the current and future pandemic through collaboration between medical centers, cities, etc. [169]. Along with
aforementioned IoT applications, Allam et al. [170] highlights
the importance of the concept of Smart City networks while
the world is struggling with the COVID-19 pandemic. Smart
City infrastructure can help people maintain social distancing
by the implementation of smart transportation systems including crowd monitoring, smart parking, and traffic re-routing
[171]. As a part of smart living in the Smart City, smart
home IoT-based technologies can also reduce the infection
rate of COVID-19. For instance, Smart home doorbells and
security systems can be implemented for preventing users from
touching surfaces so that there will not be any contamination
of the virus by touching those kinds of surfaces [15], [172],
[173].
VII. C ONCLUSION
While the world is struggling with COVID-19 pandemic,
many technologies have been implemented to fight against this
disease. One of these technologies is the Internet of Things
(IoT), which has been widely used in healthcare industry.
During COVID-19 pandemic, this technology has shown very
encouraging results dealing with this disease. In this paper, we
conduct a survey on the recent proposed IoT devices aiming to
assist health care workers and authorities during the COVID19 pandemic. we review the IoT-related technologies and their
implementations in three phases including “Early Diagnosis,”
“Quarantine Time,” and “After Recovery.” In each phase, we
evaluate the role of IoT enabled/linked technologies including wearables, drones, robots, IoT buttons, and smartphone
applications in combating COVID-19. IoT technology can be
extremely efficient for this pandemic, but it is also critical to
consider the privacy of data. By implementing IoT technology
properly in a secure way, more patients, with peace of mind,
can participate in their treatment journey using IoT devices.
As a result, authorities and health care workers can perform
a better action regarding the pandemics. Consequently, the
impact of these types of disease including the infection, and
hospitalization, and death rate can be significantly reduced.
