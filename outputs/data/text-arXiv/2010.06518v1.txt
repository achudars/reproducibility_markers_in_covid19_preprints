Abstract
In the search for effective treatments for COVID-19, initial emphasis has been on repurposed treatments. To maximise the chances of finding successful treatments, novel
treatments that have been developed for this disease in particular, are needed. In this
manuscript we describe and evaluate the statistical design of the AGILE platform, an
adaptive randomized seamless Phase I/II trial platform that seeks to quickly establish
a safe range of doses and investigates treatments for potential efficacy using a Bayesian
sequential trial design. Both single agent and combination treatments are considered.
We find that the design can identify potential treatments that are safe and efficacious
reliably with small to moderate sample sizes.

Introduction

The emergence of COVID-19 and the ensuing pandemic has led to a widespread, frantic,
search for treatments. Despite large uncertainty about the underlying pathogen and the
natural history of disease, trials must start rapidly to identify treatments to save lives,
but also so that effective treatments can be used in the response to the outbreak. A
consequence of this is that trials in COVID-19 in the first few weeks and months of the
outbreak have focused on re-purposed treatments (Cao et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020;
Horby et al., 2020b).
While recently, some success with using re-purposed treatments has been achieved
(Beigel et al., 2020; Horby et al., 2020a), it is crucial that development of treatments
specifically developed for COVID-19 is also undertaken in order to maximise the chances
finding therapies to successfully treat patients. The crucial difference of trials investigating novel therapies (in contrast to re-purposed treatments) is that the range of safe
and likely effective doses is unknown. Therefore, an efficient dose-finding design identifying safe and active doses to be studied in larger trials is essential. While there exist a
number of dose-finding design for early-phase dose-finding trials evaluating toxicity and
efficacy simultaneously (see e.g. Wages and Tait, 2015; Mozgunov and Jaki, 2019b, and
references therein), many of them consider a binary efficacy endpoint (with few recent
extension to continious endpoints, see e.g. Hirakawa, 2012; Mozgunov and Jaki, 2019a).
Time-to-event endpoints with censoring at 28-days have, however, previously been used
as a clinically meaningful measure in a number of COVID-19 trials (Cao et al., 2020;
Wang et al., 2020; Beigel et al., 2020) and the argument has been made that they should
be considered in COVID-19 trials (Dodd et al., 2020).
While the majority of Phase I dose-finding trials are non-randomised, it is agreed that
in later phases, the gold standard for evaluating novel treatments are well conducted randomized controlled clinical trials. At the same time, in the light of the uncertainty about
the adverse events caused by COVID-19, it is essential to conduct a randomised dosefinding trial to ensure that the risk of adverse events is correctly attributed to the drug
under study rather than to the disease itself. Moreover, it has been argued that adaptive
designs (e.g. Pallmann et al., 2018) are particularly suitable during a pandemic, also in
the light of the uncertainty about a novel disease (Stallard et al., 2020). Therefore,
a randomised adaptive dose-finding design evaluating both toxicity and time-to-event
efficacy would allow to answer the research questions of interest in novel therapies for
treating COVID-19.
It is also recognised that there is a number of novel therapies that have a potential to
be efficient in fighting the COVID-19. Therefore, it is crucial to have a structure in place
that would allow rapid enrolment of novel therapies to ensure rapid decision-making,
and, importantly, would allow for effecient use of information between the studies, i.e.
utilising the data from the control treatment across different compounds. This can be

1

achieved via a platform trial (Meyer et al., 2020).
In this paper, we describe and evaluate the design developed and implemented for
the AGILE platform (Griffiths et al., 2020), an adaptive randomized seamless Phase I/II
dose-finding trial platform that seeks to quickly establish a safe range of doses and investigates treatments for potential efficacy using a Bayesian sequential trial design. The
proposed design uses statistical models to improve a decision making, and further efficiency is gained by sharing control group patients between concurrent controls across
different candidates in the platform. We also extend the design for the trials studying
dual-agent combination of treatments.
The rest of manuscript proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the platform for
single treatments while its performance is evaluated in simulations in Section 3. The
design for dual-agent combinations is proposed in Section 4 and subsequently evaluated
in Section 5. We conclude with a discussion (Section 6).

2.1

Single agent design
Setting

Consider a randomized controlled dose-escalation clinical trial in which m increasing
doses d1 < d2 < . . . < dm of a single experimental treatment are studied. Let d0 = 0
be a dose of zero of the treatment, which is subsequently referred to as the control arm
(or, simply, control). The inclusion of the control arm is motivated by the still emerging
nature of the symptoms associated with COVID-19 and the desire to avoid labelling
potential treatments as unsafe due to misclassifying non-treatment related symptoms.
A binary outcome of a random variable Y , y = 0 is observed if no dose-limiting event
(DLE) is observed within tsaf e > 0 days after randomisation, and y = 1, otherwise. Let
pj be the probability for a patient to experience a DLE if given dose dj . It is assumed
that the risk of a DLE is a non-decreasing function of dose, p0 ≤ p1 ≤ . . . ≤ pm and
prior information for the DLE probability of the control arm, p0 , is available.
As it is expected that the control arm is associated with a non-negative (unknown)
risk of DLE (or symptoms of the disease that can not be distinguished from DLEs), the
primary goal of the dose-escalation is formulated in terms of the additional risk of a dose
limiting event (ADLE) defined in terms of the expected difference in DLE risk between
the doses of the agent and the control. Specifically, we therefore seek to identify the
dose that corresponds to an ADLE risk of γ = 0.20 which equates to finding the dose
dj ? such that
j ? = arg min | (pj − p0 ) − γ|.
j=0,...,m

2.2

Bayesian Dose-Escalation Model

The following randomized Bayesian dose-escalation design that builds on the proposal
by Mozgunov et al. (2019) is used. Assume that the DLE probability has the functional
form
exp(θ1 + θ2 d˜j )
ψ(d˜j , θ1 , θ2 ) =
(1)
1 + exp(θ1 + θ2 d˜j )
where θ1 and θ2 are unknown parameters, and d˜j is a standardized dose level (also
referred to as a skeleton) corresponding to dose j, which are constucted given the information about the prior DLE toxicities (details are given below). This model choice was
found to result in good statistical properties in terms of the target dose identification in
a randomized dose-finding trial (Mozgunov et al., 2019). We require that the standardized dose level corresponding to control is equal to d˜0 = 0. This will guarantee that a
sequential update of the slope parameter θ1 will not contribute to the DLE probability
estimation on the control arm yet all data are used for its estimation (Mozgunov et al.,
2019).
Denote the prior distribution of the vector θ = (θ1 , θ2 ) by f0 (.). To construct the
standardized levels, d˜j , we represent them in terms of prior estimates of the DLE prob(0)
abilities p̂j associated with doses dj j = 0, . . . , m

then used to make the escalation/de-escalation decision (Neuenschwander et al., 2008).
Specifically, the first set of safe doses is defined as the doses dj for which
P (pj − p0 ≥ γ + 2δ) < coverdose

(4)

where γ is the target ADLE risk, δ is the width of the interval of DLE risk which we
consider acceptable, coverdose is the threshold controlling overdosing, and the probability
3

is found with respect to the updated posterior distribution. Amongst the safe doses, the
dose which maximises
P (pj − p0 ∈ [γ − δ, γ + δ])
(5)
is selected as the target dose.

2.3.1

Efficacy Design
Baeysian Efficacy Model

For the efficacy endpoint, a Cox proportional hazards model is assumed where the hazard of recovery at time t is given by h(t; z) = h0 (t; z)ψ z where z = 1 corresponds to
a treatment and z = 0 to control. Initially the cohort of patients who have graduated
from the dose-escalation stage are followed up for a total of tef f days. Based on their
outcomes, a decision is made to either stop for futility, stop for efficacy or recruit a
further cohort of patients. To improve power, controls recruited from other candidate
treatments or other doses of the same treatment are also used within the evaluation, but
this is restricted to using only the most recent nc such controls to mitigate the risk of
bias due to population drift.
A Bayesian criterion is adopted for the stopping rule at each stage. In line with
Bayesian thinking, we set the stopping rules to be the same for each stage k. Specifically
(j)
denoting all data up to stage k on dose j by Dk and for a given desirable treatment
effect, ψ ∗ ,
(j)
(j)
• evaluation is stopped for efficacy if πE|k := P(ψ = ψ ∗ | Dk ) > u,
(j)

• evaluation is stopped for futility if πE|k < l, or
• an additional cohort of patients is recruited, otherwise.
(j)

At the final stage k = K, efficacy for dose j is established if πE|K > u.
(j)

(j)

A point prior of the form P(ψ = 1) = 1 − πE , P(ψ = ψ ∗ ) = πE is assumed for ψ.
(j)
Here πE represents the degree of optimism or scepticism towards the likely efficacy of
dose dj .
(j)

An advantage of the point prior is that obtaining the posterior probability πE|k is
computationally straightforward allowing comprehensive evaluations of the design via
simulations. The posterior probability under this model is

(6)

where L(u | Dk ) is the Cox partial likelihood with respect to the data for dose j up
to the kth period evaluated at a hazard ratio of u. While the Cox partial likelihood is
4

often not considered compatible with a Bayesian analysis since it does not use the full
information of the data, Bayesian justifications of its use are available (Kalbfleisch, 1978;
Sinha et al., 2003).
2.3.2

Setting the boundaries
(j)

(j)

To set the boundaries, (l, u), a large number of trajectories of L(1 | Dk ) and L(ψ ∗ | Dk )
can be simulated under both the null and alternative hypothesis, where in all cases the
simulation continues until the maximum period K. An assumption regarding the proportion of patients recovered by time tef f under the null is needed, in addition to the
hazard ratio between treatments. In the absence of censoring due to drop-out, the results will be otherwise invariant to the precise survival distribution assumed since the
Cox partial likelihood only uses the order of events.
The effect of varying (l, u) can then be explored by converting the pairs of likelihoods into a posterior probability and imposing the boundary stopping rules. For any
given set of boundaries, the type I error, power, expected number of patients under the
null, expected number of patients under the alternative and probabilities of stopping
for futility or efficacy at each stage, can be approximated. The boundaries can then be
set to optimize some criterion, for instance sum of expected sample sizes under the null
and alternative, subject to some constraints, for instance controlling type I error, keeping power above some level or limiting the chance of early stopping under the alternative.
The inclusion of historic controls will increase both the power and type I error of any
procedure (e.g. Schmidli et al., 2014). To ensure type I error is controlled, the boundaries
are set assuming the maximum, nc , previous controls are available, with the consequence
that the type I error will be lower for the first treatment evaluated in the platform. This
will also mean the power will be lower for the first few evaluated treatments. However,
given the dose finding design, it is anticipated that the first evaluations will be of less
importance, as for safety reasons evaluations tend to start at sub-optimal low doses.

2.4

Overall Design

Throughout the study, patients are allocated in cohorts of size c = c1 + c2 where c1 is
the number of patients in the cohort assigned to an active dose and c2 is the number
of patients in cohort assigned to the control arm, d˜0 . Below is an outline of the overall
procedure made up by both safety and efficacy evaluation:
Safety-evaluation
1. The first cohort of c1 + c2 patients is assigned to the first dose and to the control
arm, respectively.
2. After tsaf e days, short-term DLE outcomes are collected and the posterior distribution of the parameters is updated using Equation 3.
5

3. The set of safe doses is found using Equation 4.
• If no doses are safe, the trial is stopped for safety;
• if only the current dose is safe, the next cohort of c1 + c2 patients is assigned
to the current dose and to the control arm, respectively;
• otherwise, the next cohort of c1 + c2 patients is assigned to the adjacent,
safe dose level for which the probability (5) is maximized and control arm
respectively.
4. Once efficacy information is available for two cohorts on a safe dose, that dose is
graduated to the efficacy evaluation.
Efficacy-evaluation
1. If a dose dj is deemed safe, the efficacy outcome is observed up to day, tef f .
(j)

2. The posterior probability, πE|k , following equation 6 is then computed where k
corresponds to the number of times this dose has been evaluated for efficacy.
(j)

• If πE|k < l evaluation of dose dj is stopped for futility;
(j)

• if πE|k > u evaluation is stopped for efficacy and the corresponding candidate
and dose dj recommended for further testing;
• otherwise if k < K, an additional cohort of c1 + c2 patients is recruited on
the current dose and control arm, respectively.
The evaluation of a dose continues until the maximum number of patients N on a
dose has been reached unless it is stopped for efficacy, futility or safety before. Once
all doses are stopped, the evaluation of this candidate stops. The overall design of the
study is depicted in Figure 1.

3.1

Evaluations of Proposed Design
Setting

We will now evaluate safety and efficacy across the study together in a simulation study
and evaluate the impact of shared control data that are gradually accumulated over the
course of the trial.
We consider the setting where there are three active doses (m = 3) of a single agent
and the control arm. As before, the DLE endpoint is binary and corresponds to either
experiencing or not experiencing a DLE by time tsaf e = 7 and the efficacy endpoint is
time-to-improvement defined as a 1 category improvement on the 10-point WHO scale
(Marshall et al., 2020) over 28 days, tef f = 28. To generate the efficacy outcome a
6

Weibull distribution is used. For the control group the rate and shape parameters were
0.085 and 0.797, respectively, resulting in a median recovery time of 14 days and a recovery rate of 70% within 28 days. The rate parameter for the candidate dose have been
adapted to match the scenarios described below. The binary safety and time-to-event
efficacy responses are assumed to be highly correlated and are generated via a procedure
described by Mozgunov et al. (2018) using a correlation coefficient ρ = 0.8.
The maximum total intake per dose level is 72 patients assigned to each dose level
and control, which equates to a maximum total sample size of 216. In line with the
real study, cohort sizes of c1 = 4 (assigned to active doses) and c2 = 2 (assigned to the
control) are used. Moreover, we also report sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of
various cohort size.
The objective of the trial is to find all safe efficacious doses to be graduated into a
larger Phase II or Phase III clinical trial. The target ADLE risk is γ = 0.20, and the
dose is considered safe if the ADLE risk is less than or equal to 0.30 (δ = 0.05) and is
efficacious if it corresponds to hazard ratio of at least 1.75. The stopping boundaries
for efficacy have been found such that the type I error in each pairwise comparison
is controlled at 10% one-sided, while the power for each individual dose is 80%. The
resulting boundary values are l = 0.224 and u = 0.839 (see Section 3.3.2 for more
details).

Scenarios

As the trial aims to study novel compounds which have yet to be explored with respect
to their mechanism of action in COVID-19 patients, it is crucial that the design has
good operating characteristics under a variety of dose-DLE and dose-efficacy scenarios.
Therefore, we consider 5 dose-efficacy scenarios ranging from no doses corresponding to
a change in time-to-improvement within 28-days, to all doses resulting in a clinically
significant reduction; and 5 dose-DLE scenarios ranging from all doses being safe to all
doses being very unsafe. We then consider all combinations of these scenarios, resulting
in 25 scenarios explored in total. The five dose-DLE and dose-efficacy scenarios for each
for (d0 , d1 , d2 , d3 ) are presented in Table 1.
We will refer to the scenario with dose-DLE relationship x and dose-efficacy relationship y as “Scenario x–y”. Each dose under the combination of DLE and efficacy scenario
is classified as incorrect, undesirable, acceptable or desirable. If a treatment is unsafe or
has a hazard ratio of 1 then it is classed as incorrect. If it is safe, then a hazard ratio of
1.25 is undesirable, 1.5 is acceptable and at least 1.75 is desirable.
For all 25 scenarios, a sensitivity analysis is conducted on varying values of c1 and
c2 in order to assess the effect of both altering the allocation ratio between control and
active doses, and the total cohort size, c. We also study the implications of not sharing
controls across doses. A total of six settings are considered, (c1 = 2 & c2 = 1 and c1 = 2
& c2 = 2 for only the settings where controls are shared across doses, with c1 = 4 &
c2 = 2 and c1 = 3 & c2 = 3 for the settings both where controls are shared across doses
and where they are not). The maximum number of cohorts per dose varies with cohort
size in order to maintain the constant maximum total intake per dose level of 72 across
that dose level and control.
Software in the form of R code used to produce the presented results is available on
GitHub (https://github.com/dose-finding/covid19-agile).

3.3.1

Choice of design parameters
Safety Model

The proposed design requires the prior and design parameters for both safety and efficacy parts to be pre-specified in advance of the conduct of the trial. The procedure of
how these parameters were chosen are given below.
The prior parameters for the safety model were obtained via a calibration procedure (Lee and Cheung, 2009) over a number of safety scenarios (not taking into account
efficacy). We use safety scenarios 1–3 in Table 1 that correspond to the target dose
being d3 , d2 , and d1 , respectively, thus covering various locations of the target dose on
the dosage grid.
The following prior distribution for the vector of safety model parameters θ was
assumed:
(θ1 , log(θ2 )) ∼ N (µ, Σ)
where µ = (µ1 , µ2 )T is the vector of means and


σ1 σ12
Σ=

σ12 σ2

Given the link between the prior toxicity on the control and the intercept parameter
(0)
θ1 as implied by Equation 2, µ1 = logit(p̂0 ) where the prior DLE probability at the con(0)
trol, p̂0 . Following discussions with the clinical team, the DLE risk on control was set
(0)
to p̂0 = 0.10. To reduce the computational complexity of the calibration, the covariance
between the model parameters was assumed to be σ12 = 0. The rest of the parameters
were chosen by conducting simulations using various combinations of values of the parameters on the grid, µ2 = {−0.5, −0.25, 0, 0.25, 0.5}, σ1 = {1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6}, σ2 =
{0.15, 0.25, 0.35, 0.45, 0.55}.
Furthermore, to define the standardized doses d˜j in Equation 2, the prior toxicity
probability at each dose should be assumed. As there is no reliable information of the
DLE rates in the COVID-19 population, the skeleton was also calibrated. The grid of
values for the prior toxicity risks are chosen in terms of the difference in the probability
(0)
(0)
of DLE between the neighbouring doses. Specifically, p̂j = p̂0 + ν × j, j = 1, 2, 3 where
ν is the difference in the toxicity probabilities between doses, which are then used to find
the skeleton using Equation 2. The grid of values of ν was included as one of the parameters for the calibration ν = {0.075, 0.100, 0.125, 0.150}. Below, we fix coverdose = 0.25
that was previously found to result in good safety properties of the design for the twoparameter logistic model (Bailey et al., 2009).

9

The calibration was performed as follows. For each combination of parameters of
ν, µ2 , σ1 , σ2 on the specified of grid, 500 simulations were run under each of the three
considered scenarios monitoring the proportion of target dose selections. Then, the
selected values of the parameters are those that maximized the geometric mean (taken
across scenarios for the same combination of values of the parameters) of the proportion
of the target dose selection. This resulted in using ν = 0.125, µ2 = −0.25, σ1 = 1.40, σ2 =
0.35 for the further design evaluation.
3.3.2

Efficacy Model

The efficacy stopping boundaries for a particular setting were taken as the pair (l, u)
that maximizes
Criterion = Power − λ{E(N0 ) + E(N1 )},
(7)
subject to the constraint that the type I error is less than or equal to 10%, where E(N0 )
and E(N1 ) are the expected sample sizes (across both active dose and control arms)
under the null and alternative hypothesis, respectively and λ is a tuning parameter.
A value of λ = 1/320 was chosen to allow a power of 80% to be achieved when
ψ = 1.75 for the main settings where nc = 30 and c1 : c2 = 4 : 2. For comparability, the
same λ was used in the sensitivity analysis where the size of cohorts and/or the use of
past controls was varied. In these other settings power is lower than 80%, ranging from
63% to 79%. The boundaries for the scenarios are shown in Table 2.
(j)

Throughout, the point prior is taken to be πE = 12 for all doses j. Note that if the
boundaries are chosen based on (7), the operating characteristics of the efficacy design
are not affected by the choice of point prior. Specifically, since (6) can be re-expressed
in terms of the posterior log-odds as


changing the value of πE merely has the effect of translating the posterior log-odds
by a constant. Hence the boundaries (˜l, ũ) under the alternative prior will satisfy the
relationship (logit(˜l), logit(ũ)) = (logit(l) + ξ, logit(u) + ξ) where ξ is the log-odds ratio
between the new and old prior odds of efficacy.

Results

Detailed results for the setting with cohort size of 4+2 and inclusion of up to thirty
control patients are presented in Table 3. A comparison of results for the varying cohort
sizes are illustrated in Figures 2 and 3. Across settings, the type I error rate, that is the
percentage of simulations in Scenario 0–0 where any dose is recommended, ranges from

Figure 2 shows the percentage of simulations where all desirable doses are recommended (left) and where any desirable doses are recommended (right). For the baseline
setting of c1 = 4 and c2 = 2, the mean percentage of simulations recommending all
desirable doses is 28.2%, whilst 71.0% of simulations recommended any desirable dose.
As expected, safety/efficacy scenarios where only one dose is desirable have higher percentages of simulations recommending all desirable doses, whilst lower percentages of
simulations recommending any desirable dose. The highest power for recommending
any desirable dose is observed in the safety/efficacy scenarios where all active doses are
safe and efficacious, reaching 89% for Scenario 1–4.
The sensitivity analysis across the varying cohort settings shows there is a very small
difference in performance. The ordering of performance across safety/efficacy scenarios
is identical with only a small numerical difference. However, we can see that not sharing
controls across doses decreases the performance. Power for recommending any desirable
dose increases for increasing cohort size c, on average increasing 6% for allocation 1:2
(c = 3 and c = 6) and 2% for allocation ratio 1:1 (c = 4 and c = 6). Again unsurpris12

ingly, a lower power is observed when controls are not shared across doses, and within
this a higher power when the allocation ratio between control and active dose within
cohort is equal. The highest power is achieved for cohorts sizes c1 = 4 and c2 = 2 with
controls being shared across doses.
Figure 3 illustrates the average total sample size across the scenarios and settings.
On average about 65 patients are required in the setting used in the trial with the total
sample size exceeding 150 in only 1% of simulations across scenarios. The scenarios with
the smallest sample sizes are those where all doses are unsafe and the trial is therefore
stopped early for safety. In such cases, it takes 30 patients across 6 weeks on average to
reach the conclusion of stopping early for safety. The scenarios with larger sample sizes
are those where all doses are safe and most are acceptable or only just desirable (i.e. not
the case where the hazard ratio is 2.00), as in these cases more doses are taken to the efficacy part and more patients are required to detect the smaller difference in hazard ratios.
It can be seen across settings that the larger the total cohort size, the larger the
total sample size. This also corresponds to the higher power settings. When controls are
shared across doses, altering the control:treatment allocation from 1:1 to 1:2 decreases
the total average sample size, whereas when controls are not shared across doses this
increases. This also links to the relationship with the power in the corresponding set-

13

tings; a higher power is achieved for equal allocations when controls are not shared. The
sharing of controls means more patients can be allocated to the novel treatment and
hence more can be learnt about it. In all cases, the average total sample size is below
90.
Table 3 gives more detail into which doses are recommended across simulations. For
example, in efficacy scenario 2 where the lowest dose is acceptable and the higher two
are desirable in terms of efficacy. In safety scenario 0 where all doses are safe, the highest
dose is chosen most often. In safety scenario 2 where only the highest dose is unsafe,
the middle dose is chosen most often, although less often than the highest desirable dose
in scenario 0. In safety scenario 4 where all doses are unsafe, the lowest does is chosen
only 17.6% of the time. It is clear that desirable doses are recommended most often,
with incorrect and undesirable doses rarely recommended. This gives insight that the
procedure is successful in identifying desirable doses of a single agent.

Extension to combination treatments
Setting

Consider now a randomized controlled dose-escalation dual-agent clinical trial studying
the combinations of J doses d1 < d2 , . . . , dJ of the first compound (referred to as agent
A) and of L doses s1 < s2 < . . . < sL of the second compound (referred to as agent B).
As before, let d0 = s0 be a zero dose of each compound, respectively, correspondingly
to the control treatment, and denote the combination of dose dj of A and dose sl of
B by (dj , sl ). Within each agent (assuming the second agent is fixed), it is known
prior to the trial that the risk of a DLE monotonically increases with the dose. The
objective of the trial is then to study the safety of the combinations and to establish the
maximum tolerated combination, the combination corresponding to the target ADLE
over the control arm of 20%. Denoting the probability of DLE at combination with
doses dj and sl by p(dj , sl ), the probability of each agent given individually by p(dj ) and
p(sl ), and the probability of DLE at the control by p(d0 , s0 ) = p0 , the aim is to find the
combination (dj ? , sl? ) minimising
| (p(dj , sl ) − p0 ) − γ|.
The fundamental difference to the single-agent setting introduced in Section 2.1 is
that one cannot order all of the combinations of the compounds with respect to the
monotonically increasing risk of DLE despite the monotonicity assumption being satisfied
within each compound. For example, comparing combination (d1 , s2 ) and (d2 , s1 ), the
dose of one agent is increased and another is decreased, and it is unknown prior to
the trial which of these effects prevails in the overall DLE risk associated with the
combinations. Consequently, the model-based design for monotherapies in Section 2.2
cannot be used and an alternative dose-finding. Below, the extension of the single-agent
model-based design is suggested.
14

4.2

Dual-Agent Bayesian Dose-Escalation Model

For the considered randomized dual-agent combination setting, under the assumption of
independence of the compounds, the probability of a DLE associated with combination
(dj , sl ) can be written as
p0 (dj , sl ) = 1 − (1 − p(dj ))(1 − p(sl )).

(8)

To allow for the interaction of the compounds in terms of the probability of a DLE, we
use the proposed model by Neuenschwander et al. (2015)


odds(p(dj , sl )) = odds(p0 (dj , sl )) × exp η × d˜j × s̃l ,
p
where odds(p) = 1−p
is the odds transformation of the probability p, and η is the interaction coefficient, positive values of which correspond to synergistic DLE risk, zero
corresponds to additive effect without interaction, and negative values correspond to
antagonistic risk of DLE, and d˜j , s̃l are standardized dose levels corresponding to the
same DLE probability as the doses dj , sl .

Note that p(·) in Equation (8) is the probability of a DLE associated with one
compound given as monotherapy as in Section 2.2. Therefore, we adopt the 2-parameter
logistic model given in Equation (1) for each agent separately. Specifically, let
p(dj ) = ψ(d˜j , θ1 , θ21 )

(9)

p(sl ) = ψ(s̃l , θ1 , θ22 )

(10)

and
where θ = (θ1 , log (θ21 ) , log (θ22 ) , η) are the unknown parameters with a Normal prior
distribution, θ ∼ N (µ, Σ) where µ = (µ1 , µ21 , µ22 , µη )T is the vector of means and

As before, we require the standardized dose level corresponding to the control treatment
to be equal to d˜0 = s̃0 = 0, so that the intercept parameter of the 2-parameter model (8)
relates to the probability of DLE on the control only. Therefore, both single-agent models employ the same intercept parameter θ1 as it corresponds to the probability of a DLE
at the same control treatment. Consequently, for small to moderate values of probability
of DLE, the intercept parameter in the single-agent model, θ1 approximately equals the
logit inverse-logit transformation

= θ1 . This is used to construct the standardized dose
2
levels d˜j , s̃l using the prior means of the parameters θ and the prior probabilities of a
15

DLE at each combination similarly to the construction in Equation (2).
Parameters of the vector θ are the unknown quantities that define the combinationDLE relationship. As in the single-agent design in Section 2.2, the posterior distribution
of these are sequentially updated using the data collected during the trial using Bayes’
theorem. Specifically, denote the joint prior distributions of vector θ by f0 (.). Assume
that n patients have received the combinations (d1), s(1)) . . . , (d(n), s(n)) and binary responses Yn = [y1 , . . . , yn ]T were observed, respectively. The models update the posterior
distribution of θ as

where
φ((d(n), s(n), yn , θ) = p(d(n), s(n), θ)yn (1 − p(d(n), s(n), θ))1−yn .
This posterior distribution is then used to make the escalation and de-escalation decision
during the trials as proposed below.

4.3

Dual-Agent Dose-Escalation Design

The above combination-DLE model is then used in the design in Section 2.4 in place of
the single-agent model. As the efficacy part of the dose-escalation design proposed for
monotherapies considered each dose individually, the efficacy part of the combination
study remains the same. Once the combination of the compounds is established to be
safe, it is graduated into the efficacy part following the single-agent proposal and the
same decision rules for dropping for futility and safety.

5.1

Evaluation of combination treatment design
Scenarios

In order to evaluate the dual-agent design, we conduct a simulation study comprising
of scenarios with two dose levels of agent A (d1 & d2 ) and three dose levels of agent B
(s1 , s2 & s3 ). We consider four dose-DLE scenarios ranging from a situation where all
combinations are safe to a case where all are unsafe. Four dose-efficacy scenarios ranging from no efficacious combination to a steep monotonic within agent relationship are
considered yielding 16 safety-efficacy scenarios. The dual agent scenarios are presented
in Table 4 with definitions of incorrect, undesirable, acceptable and desirable dose combinations remaining as they were previously defined for single agent doses in Section 3.2.
Here we fix cohort sizes to the previous baseline setting of c1 = 4 (assigned to active
dose combinations) and c2 = 2 (assigned to the control) and allow controls to be shared
across dose combinations. The maximum number of patients per dose combination is 72
as before.

Parameter Calibration

To define the parameters of the combination model, a calibration procedure similar to
the procedure described in Section 3.3.1 was applied. Safety scenarios 0–3 in Table 4 that
correspond to different steepness of the combination-toxicity relationship and different
locations of the target combination were used. We then choose the hyperparameters
for the prior distribution of the parameters of the model, θ = (θ1 , log (θ21 ) , log (θ22 ) , η),
given in Equation (9) and Equation (10).
Given the link between the prior toxicity on the control arm, and the intercept
parameter

logit p̂0 )/2 where p̂0 = 0.10 is the DLE risk on the control, as before. To reduce the computational complexity, the covariance between all model parameters was
assumed to be σ1,21 = σ1,22 = 0, and the variance of the slope parameters in each
single-agent model is the same σ21 = σ22 . Finally, we set the mean of the distribution
of the interaction parameter µη = 0 to reflect that either synergistic and antogonistic
effects are possible. The rest of the parameters were chosen by simulations using combinations of values on the grid, µ21 = {−0.4, 0.2, 0.0, 0.2}, µ22 = {−0.4, 0.2, 0.0, 0.2}, σ1 =
{0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2}, σ21 = σ22 = {0.05, 0.15, 0.25, 0.35, 0.45} and ση = {0.02, 0.04, 0.10, 0.20, 1}.
As in the single-agent setting, the standardized doses d˜j , s̃l were calibrated in terms
of the difference in the probability of DLE between the neighbouring doses. Specifically,

p̂j (dj ) = p̂0 + νd × j, and p̂j (sl ) = p̂0 + νs × j, l, j = 1, 2, 3 where νd , νs are the differences in the toxicity probabilities between doses of the first and second agents, respec17

tively. The following values of differences were tried νd = {0.025, 0.05, 0.075, 0.10, 0.125},
νs = {0.025, 0.05, 0.075, 0.10, 0.125}. Finally, we fix coverdose = 0.25 for the overdose control constraint.
Using 500 simulations under each scenario and each combination of hyperparameters,
the values µ21 = 0.0, µ22 = 0.0, σ1 = 0.6, σ21 = σ22 = 0.25, ση = 0.10, νd = νs = 0.075
were found to maximize the geometric mean of the proportion of correct combination
selections across the scenarios.

5.3

Results

For the 16 scenarios considered in the simulation study, the percentage of simulations
recommending any desirable dose combination, the percent of simulations recommending
all correct dose combinations and the mean total sample size are presented in Figure 4,
with further detail on individual dose combination recommendations given in Table 5.
The type I error rate, that is the percentage of simulations recommending any dose combination in Scenario 0-0, is 12.1%. In the extension from monotherapies to dual agent
therapies, some similar patterns are maintained in the results although there are some
notable differences.
It can be seen in Figure 4 that the spread of powers across scenarios for dose combinations is larger than for monotherapies, for both the selection of all and any desirable
dose combinations. The maximum power of 81.7% to select any desirable dose combination is achieved in Scenario 0-2, where all doses are safe and there is a steep monotonic
relationship within agent for efficacy. Even though there is an extra desirable dose combination in Scenario 0-3, we observe a slightly reduced power since the most efficacious
dose combination has a lower hazard ratio. The power to recommend all desirable doses
ranges up to 61% in Scenario 0-1 where only one dose is desirable, with the lowest in
Scenarios 0-3 and 2-3 where the desirable dose combinations are across separate agents’
dose escalation (i.e. to select all desirable doses requires a de-escalation in one agent
and then escalation in the other).
Across scenarios, the mean total sample size is 75, ranging from 42-89, a narrower
range than for the single agent. However similar to the single agent, the smaller sample
sizes correspond to scenarios where all dose combinations are unsafe and therefore the
trial stopped early for safety. When this is not the case, there is little variation across
scenarios in terms of mean total sample size.
Table 5 shows further details of dose recommendations in the simulations. Especially of note is the emphasis on recommendations of acceptable doses. For example
in Scenario 2-3 where the power to detect desirable dose combinations is low, a large
proportion of simulations also recommend an acceptable dose combination. It is also
clear that inefficacious and/or unsafe doses are rarely recommended.

Discussion

We introduce and evaluate the statistical design of the AGILE platform which seeks
to quickly establish safe doses and potential for efficacy. We find that the design can
identify potential treatments with good accuracy and show that the approach is easily
extended to combinations of treatments.
The design uses a recently proposed randomized dose-finding design to ensure that
differences between symptoms of COVID can be distinguished from side-effects of the
investigated treatment while a very simple Bayesian model is used to capture the potential efficacy of the treatments. The latter is in line with the objective of the trial: make
reliable decisions about potential quickly, rather than using more complex methods that
allow more precise estimation. At the same time this approach guaranteed that the
whole platform structure could be simulated quickly to enable the study design to be
fixed quickly.
The design has been constructed in a flexible manner using a time-to-event outcome
and we based our simulations on time-to-improvement − an endpoint that has been

et al., 2020). The platform has, however, been constructed to also be able to investigate
mild disease in which case a primary endpoint used would be time-to-negative viral titres
in nose and/or throat swab. Provided that the event rate in this setting is the same, we
expect that the performance reported here will be similar.
