Abstract
We investigate, through a fractional mathematical model, the effects of physical distance on the
SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission. Two controls are considered in our model for eradication of the
spread of COVID-19: media education, through campaigns explaining the importance of social
distancing, use of face masks, etc., towards all population, while the second one is quarantine
social isolation of the exposed individuals. A general fractional order optimal control problem,
and associated optimality conditions of Pontryagin type, are discussed, with the goal to minimize
the number of susceptible and infected while maximizing the number of recovered. The extremals
are then numerically obtained.
Key words: COVID-19 mathematical model, isolation, fractional order derivatives, optimal

1. Introduction
The availability of easy-to-use precise estimation models are essential to get an insight into
the effects of transferable infectious diseases. In outbreak diseases, policy makers and institutions
make decisions based on forecasting models to decide on future policies and to check the efficiency
of existing policies [1].
Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that can be transmitted between humans, livestock and
wild animals. Person to person spread of COVID-19 happens through close contact, up to six feet.
This group of viruses mainly affects the hepatic, neurological and respiratory systems [2, 3, 4].
In the end of 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported a novel coronavirus in
China, which causes severe damage to the respiratory system. The virus was first found in Wuhan
city, and was named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [5]. After
the outbreak of the virus, the Chinese government put several cities on lock down [6, 7]. However,
the number of affected people increased daily within China and in other countries. In March
11, 2020, COVID-19 was declared as a global pandemic by WHO. At the time we write these
lines, January 6, 2021, approximately 87 million people were infected with 1.9 million of deaths,
worldwide [8].
Recently, many mathematical models were proposed to understand disease transmission and
project handful controls: see, e.g., [9, 10, 11] and references therein. Simultaneously, all health
organizations are trying to drive the most lethal infectious diseases towards eradication, using

educational and enlightenment campaigns, vaccination, treatment, etc. However, many of these
infectious diseases will become eventually endemic because of interventions to mitigate the spread
in time and lack of adequate policies. For control of infectious diseases, proactive steps are required,
specially for diseases having vaccine and cure. Indeed, some times it is more difficult to control
the spread of an infectious disease than to cure it. Regarding COVID-19, several vaccines begin
to be available [12].
Optimal control theory is a branch of mathematical optimization that deals with finding a
control for a dynamical system, over a period of time, such that an objective function is minimized
or maximized. Along the years, optimal control theory has found applications in several fields,
containing process control, aerospace, robotics, economics, bio-engineering, management sciences,
finance, and medicine [13, 14, 15]. In particular, the study of epidemic models is strongly related
to the study of control strategies, as screening and educational campaigns [16], vaccination [17],
and resource allocation [18].
In the current pandemic situation of COVID-19, due to best presentation of memory effects and
its usefulness in many different and widespread phenomena [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25], fractional
(non-integer order) models are receiving the attention of many researchers: see, e.g., [26, 27, 28,
29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38]. Here, with the purpose to control the current pandemic,
we follow two control variables, in the form of media (education) campaigns, social distance,
and use of mask for protection of susceptible individuals; and quarantine (social isolation) for the
exposed. For a general non-integer order optimal control problem, necessary optimality conditions
are presented, with the help of Caputo derivatives. One of the great advantages of the Caputo
fractional derivative is that it allows traditional initial or boundary conditions to be included in
the formulation of the problem. More concretely, we minimize the number of susceptible and
infected, while maximizing the number of recovered population from COVID-19. The optimal
levels of the proposed two controls are characterized using the fractional version of Pontryagin’s
maximum principle. The resulting optimality system is then solved numerically with Matlab.
The rest of the paper is arranged as follows. In Section 2, we present our fractional mathematical model. Section 3 recalls the fundamental definitions and the main result of fractional optimal
control. We then derive an optimal control problem in Section 4, while parameter estimation with
numerical results are discussed in Section 5. We finish with some remarks and conclusions, in
Section 6.
2. The fractional model
Our model consists of four classes: S(t), which represents the vulnerable individuals (healthy
people but who may get the disease in a near future); E(t), representing the exposed population
or individuals who are infected but not yet infectious; the group I(t), devoted to the population
who are confirmed infected (individuals who have contracted the disease and are now sick with
it and are infectious); the group R(t), defined as the recovered population (individuals who have
recovered from COVID-19). For the dynamics of this base model, see [28]. Thus, the fractional
order model we consider here is given by
 C α
D S(t) = Λ − β1 S(t)E(t) − β2 S(t)I(t) − µS(t) + τ R(t),


 C0 αt

I(t) = ρE(t) − (γ + d + µ)I(t),


 C0 αt
0 Dt R(t) = γI(t) − (µ + τ )R(t),
where Λ is the recruitment rate, β1 and β2 are the incidence rates, τ is the relapse rate, µ is the
natural death rate, ρ the rate at which the exposed population of COVID-19 join the infectious
class, γ the recovery rate of infected population, and d is the death rate of infected class due to
the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The total population N (t) is given, at each instant of time, by
N (t) = S(t) + E(t) + I(t) + R(t).

By adding all the equations of system (1), we have

3. Basics of fractional control theory
In this section we recall the basic definitions of Caputo fractional calculus and the central
result of fractional optimal control theory [23, 39], which are required for the coming sections.

where α stands for order of the derivative, m − 1 < α ≤ m.

is defined by

where α is the order of the derivative with m − 1 < α ≤ m, m ∈ N.
Our control system is described by a fractional differential system (FDS) with a given/fixed
initial condition as follows:
(

0 Dt X(t) = f (X(t), u(t), t) ,
(8)
X(0) = X0 ,
where α ∈ (0, 1], the n-dimensional X(t) is the state vector, f is a given vector-valued function,
t ∈ [0, tf ] with tf > 0 the ending time of the control process, and m-dimensional u(t) is the control
vector. A fractional optimal control problem consists to minimize or maximize a performance index

subject to the control system (8) (see, e.g., [39, 40]). Functions θ and φ will be specified in
Section 4. Note that here tf is fixed but X(tf ) is free. For finding the optimal control law
u(t) solution to the optimal control problem (8)–(9), we use the fractional version of Pontryagin
maximum principle, which coincides with the classical Pontryagin maximum principle when α = 1:
Theorem 3 (See, e.g., [39, 40]). For the optimality of (8)–(9), a necessary condition is given by

In the next section, we compute the optimal control strategy for the fractional order COVID-19
model, which is a hot topic in current times.

4. Fractional-order model with controls
We implement an optimal control technique to the fractional order model (1). With the purpose
to control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in the world, we use two control variables in the
form of media (educational) campaigns, social distance, and use of masks — the control u1 (t) —
applied to the susceptible class; and quarantine (social isolation) — the control u2 (t) — applied
to the exposed class. Then, the new system with controls is given by
C α

0 Dt S(t) = Λ − β1 S(t)E(t) − β2 S(t)I(t) − µS(t) + τ R(t) − u1 (t)S(t),

C α
0 Dt R(t) = γI(t) − (µ + τ )R(t) + u1 (t)S(t) + pu2 (t)E(t),
where the fractional order α is a real number in the interval (0, 1] and p can be interpreted as the
probability of infected individuals to recover by quarantine. In vector form, the system (10) can
be written as
C α
(11)
0 Dt X(t) = f (X(t), u(t)) ,

where X(t) = (S(t), E(t), I(t), R(t)) represents the state-vector and u(t) = (u1 (t), u2 (t)) stands
for the control-vector.
Our optimal control problem consists to minimize the spread of COVID-19 and maximize the
number of recovered population. The following objective functional is defined with this purpose:
Z tf


r1 u21 (t) + r2 u22 (t) dt −→ min, (12)
A1 I(t) − A2 R(t) +
J[u(·)] = A3 S(tf ) + A4 E(tf ) +
2
0

where the positive weights Ai , i = 1, 2, 3, 4, and ri , i = 1, 2, are used to balance the control factors.
The objective functional (12) is a particular case of the general form (9) discussed in Section 3,
and can be written as
Z

φ (X(t), u(t)) dt

J[u(·)] = θ (X(tf )) +

with θ (X(tf )) = A3 S(tf ) + A4 E(tf ) and

φ (X(t), u(t)) = A1 I(t) − A2 R(t) +

Similar functionals (13) to be optimized, e.g. for optimal control problems in the combat of Zika
and Ebola, have been previously considered in the literature, see [41, 42] and references therein.
By using Theorem 3, the following necessary optimality conditions can be written: the control
system and its initial condition,
(

X(0) = X0 ,

The optimal control variables are given by the stationary conditions:

u2 (t) = (λ2 −(1−ρ)λr23 −ρλ4 )E(t) .

(19)

These analytic necessary optimality conditions are solved numerically in Section 5.
5. Numerical simulations
To illustrate the theoretical results presented in previous sections, here we use numerical simulations. For this purpose, a program was developed in Matlab to integrate the necessary optimality
conditions and, with the help of a number of simulations, a detailed output is comprehensively
verified. As explained in Section 4, we obtain the optimality system for the proposed optimal
control problem from the state and adjoint equations subject to suitable boundary conditions: the
initial conditions X(0) = X0 on the state variables, see (14); and the terminal conditions on the
adjoint variables provided by the transversality conditions, see (18). Furthermore, we obtain the
optimal control strategies from the stationary system, see (19). We use a forward time/backward
space finite-difference numerical method. Beginning with an initial guess for the adjoint variables,
a forward time and backward space finite-difference method is used to solve the state equations.
The key is to rewrite the control system (11) into the equivalent integral form
1
X(t) = X(0) +
Γ(α)

and then use the generalized Adams-type predictor-corrector method [21, 22] for solution. Further,
these state values are used for the solution of the adjoint equations by a backward time and forward
space finite-difference method, because of the transversality conditions. System (15) is written, in
an equivalent way, as the integral equation

Using a steepest-method to generate a successive approximation of the optimal control form, we
continue iterating until convergence is achieved. For illustrative purposes, take the initial values
as S(0) = 220, E(0) = 100, I(0) = 3, R(0) = 0 and parameter values as Λ = 0.271, β1 = 0.00035,
β2 = 0.00040, µ = 0.001, ρ = 0.00580, γ = 0.007, τ = 0.002, p = 0.3, and d = 0.00025.
In Figure 1, we plot the susceptible population of systems (1) and (10). The doted lines denote
the population of class S in the uncontrolled system (1), without controls, while the solid lines

individuals in the case one uses optimal control theory (because there is less susceptible, exposed

6. Conclusion
The current pandemic situation due to COVID-19 affects the whole world on an unprecedented scale. In this work, we implemented optimal control techniques to the COVID-19 pandemic
through a fractional order model. For the eradication of virus spread throughout the world, we
applied two controls in the form of media (education) campaigns, social distance, use of masks
and protection for the susceptible class; and quarantine (social isolation) for the exposed individuals. We discussed necessary optimality conditions for a general fractional optimal control problem, whose fractional system is described in the Caputo sense while the adjoint system involves
Riemann–Liouville derivatives. In the COVID-19 setting, we minimize the number of susceptible
and infected population, while maximizing the number of recovered population from SARS-CoV-2
virus. Using the fractional version of Pontryagin’s maximum principle, we characterize the optimal levels of the proposed controls. The resulting optimality system is solved numerically in the
Matlab numerical computing environment. Our numerical experiments were based on data of [27].
In a future work, we plan to use real data of Africa, USA and UK.
