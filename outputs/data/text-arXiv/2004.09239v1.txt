Abstract: The pneumonia caused by Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is one of major global threat and a
number of detection and treatment procedures are suggested by the researchers for COVID-19. The
proposed work aims to suggest an automated image processing scheme to extract the COVID-19 lesion
from the lung CT scan images (CTI) recorded from the patients. This scheme implements the following
procedures; (i) Image pre-processing to enhance the COVID-19 lesions, (ii) Image post-processing to
extract the lesions, and (iii) Execution of a relative analysis between the extracted lesion segment and the
Ground-Truth-Image (GTI). This work implements Firefly Algorithm and Shannon Entropy (FA+SE)
based multi-threshold to enhance the pneumonia lesion and implements Markov-Random-Field (MRF)
segmentation to extract the lesions with better accuracy. The proposed scheme is tested and validated
using a class of COVID-19 CTI obtained from the existing image datasets and the experimental outcome
is appraised to authenticate the clinical significance of the proposed scheme. The proposed work helped
to attain a mean accuracy of >92% during COVID-19 lesion segmentation and in future, it can be used to
examine the real clinical lung CTI of COVID-19 patients.

Introduction

The recent developments in science and technology helped the human community to get improved
medical facility for disease detection and treatment execution process. Further, most of the life
threatening diseases in humans are controlled due to prescreening and vaccination procedures. Even

though a substantial amount of preventive methods are taken; the spread of the infectious diseases are
rising globally due to various circumstances and the communicable illness called the Coronavirus Disease
(COVID-19) is one such disease; causing severe impact globally [1-3]. Because of its severity; the infection
rate due to COVID-19 is growing rapidly and has affected large human communities irrespective of their
age, gender and race [4-6].
The cause of COVID-19 is due to a virus named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Corona Virus2 (SARS-CoV-2) and this disease originally originated in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 [7]. Outbreak
of this disease has emerged as a global challenge and a significant number of research works are initiated
to discover the solution to control the infection rate and the spread of COVID-19 [8-10]. Further, the
recent research works related to; (i) disease detection [11-16], (ii) treatment planning [17-21] and (iii)
disease prediction [6,22,23] has helped to get insight regarding COVID-19.
The earlier research and the clinical detection revealed that, COVID-19 causes infection in the
respiratory tract and initiates severe pneumonia. Further, the research also revealed that, the early
symptoms of COVID-19 are subclinical and it requires a dedicated clinical procedure to detect and
confirm the disease. The common clinical level diagnosis involves in; (i) Sample assisted analysis of
COVID-19 using Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) and (ii) Image assisted
evaluation using lung Computed-Tomography (CT) scan images and/or Chest radiographs (Chest X-ray).
During the disease screening process, biological samples are initially collected from the patient and the
RT-PCR test is performed. When the test result is positive, then the patient is admitted into the hospital
for the further diagnosis and treatment. When the patient is admitted for treatment, the physician will
initiate the treatment process to cure the patient using the prescribed treatment procedure which will
reduce the impact of the pneumonia [24-26].
For the COVID-19 pneumonia patients, the pulmonologist will suggest a sequence of investigative
tests to identify the origin, location, and severity of the pneumonia. Initially, the preliminary tests, such as
blood count, blood-gas examination and pleural-fluid assessment [13] are performed. The image
supported practices are also regularly performed to trace the infection in lung, which can be additionally
inspected by a skilled doctor or a computerized arrangement to recognize the harshness of the
pneumonia. Compared to the chest X-ray, the CT scan Image (CTI) is commonly used due to its merit and
the three-dimensional view support. The recent research work published on COVID-19 also verified the
advantage of the CT in detecting the infection in the respiratory tract and pneumonia [20-25].
Recently, a number of methodologies are implemented for the clinical level detection of COVID-19
using the RT-PCR and the imaging methods [11-13]. Most of these earlier works are combined the RTPCR along with the imaging procedure to confirm and treat the disease [9,18-20]. The CTI is commonly
used as the prescribed modality and the axial as well as the coronal views are analyzed to detect the
severity of the infection and based on the outcome, effective treatment is suggested to treat the disease
with suitable drug. The recent work of Rajinikanth et al. [27] developed a computer assisted methodology
to assess the COVID-19 lesion using the lung CTI of coronal-view using a series of procedures. This work
implemented few operator assisted steps to achieve superior outcome during the COVID-19 evaluation.
The intention of the proposed research is to develop a computerized scheme to extract and evaluate
the COVID-19 lesions from the lung CTI. The recent studies on COVID-19 pneumonia also verify that, the
estimation of infection severity level is necessary to arrange for a suitable treatment plan to cure the
patients. In a real-time situation, lung infection due to COVID-19 initiated pneumonia is evaluated by a
skilled doctor and based on the suggestion; probable healing actions are suggested and implemented to
reduce the infection level. The personal recognition using a doctor will be a tedious job when the number
of patients is more and hence, it is essential to propose a computerized image examination practice to
assist the physician during the pneumonia diagnosis. This scheme will significantly lessen the diagnostic
burden of the physician and will assist the physician to track the changes in the lesions
(reduction/progress in infection) when the treatment is implemented.

The aim of this research is to develop a computerized COVID-19 lesion detection system to reduce
the diagnostic burden of the pulmonologist responsible for the investigation of the CTI to discover the
pneumonia level in lungs. The proposed research executes a sequence of techniques, such as artifact
removal, Firefly Algorithm and Shannon-Entropy (FA+SE) based multi-thresholding, Markov-RandomField (MRF) segmentation and validation of the proposed system using a comparison with respect to the
Ground-Truth-Image (GTI). In this work, the COVID-19 dataset available in [28] is considered for the
initial assessment. This dataset consists of one hundred numbers of COVID-19 images with dimension
512x512x1 pixels and all the images are associated with the GTI. In the proposed work, 50 images of the
benchmark dataset are considered for the assessment and the average accuracy of >92% is attained with
the proposed technique. The performance of the proposed system is finally validated using the clinical
grade CTI of the Radiopaedia database [29] and achieved better result.
This research is arranged as follows; section 2 presents the methodology and section 3 outlines the
attained results. Section 4 and 5 presents the discussions and the conclusion of the present research work.

Methodology

This section of the research presents the methodology implemented to detect the lung lesions due to
COVID-19. The structure of the proposed examination procedure is depicted in Figure 1. Initially, the
essential two-dimensional (2D) slices of the CTI (gray scale) are collected for the examination. The organ
of interest is the lung and in the CTI, the lung is associated with various artifact sections, such as the
heart, bone and other body parts and these artifacts are to be removed for the efficient assessment of lung
and its infection. In this research, the stripping methodology discussed by Palani et al. [30] and
Rajinikanth et al. [31] is executed to remove the artifacts with a bi-level threshold filter. The separated
lung segment is then considered for image pre-processing and post-processing methodology. The image
pre-processing step implements a three-level threshold to separate the image into; the background,
normal lung section and the pneumonia lesion. In this work, the image enhancement is achieved using
the Firefly-Algorithm (FA) guided Shannon-Entropy (SE) thresholding. The enhanced pneumonia lesion
in the lung is then extracted by implementing Markov-Random-Field (MRF) segmentation. Finally, the
extracted COVID-19 lesion is compared against the Ground-Truth-Image (GTI) and based on the attained
performance values; the superiority of the proposed image processing tool is confirmed.

Test Image

The pneumonia infection due to COVID-19 is generally appraised in hospitals using the chest Xray/CTI [9-12]. The visibility of CTI is better compared to chest X-ray and hence, this research considers
the CTI for the experimental investigation. The COVID-19 is a novel disease and the availability of the
images for the research is very limited due to various constraints. This work considered the COVID-19
pneumonia image dataset of [28] to test the performance of the proposed image processing method. This
database consists of 100 CTI with dimensions 512x512x1 pixels and all the existing images are associated
with related Ground-Truth-Images (GTI). This research considered 50 numbers of 2D slices recorded with
the axial-view for the assessment and the sample images considered in this research is depicted in Figure
2.

The initial level of investigation of COVID-19 lesions is performed using the considered 50 numbers
of CTI. After confirming its performance based on a comparative assessment with the GTI, its significance
is then validated using the clinical grade images attained from the Radiopaedia database and the sample
trial images of this database is depicted in Figure 3. During the validation practice, 45 numbers of axialview 2D CTI (3 patients x 15 slices = 45 slices) are considered and the attained results are evaluated.

Figure 3. Sample test images attained from the Radiopaedia case-studies

2.2 Image pre-processing
The artifact elimination is the initial procedure implemented to separate the lung region from other
sections using the artifact-elimination procedure discussed in [30, 31]. Later, the visibility of COVID-19
infection in the lung is enhanced by implementing the pre-processing procedure based on the FireflyAlgorithm (FA) assisted threshold technique discussed in [31]. The enhancement attained with the
Tsallis-Entropy based tri-level thresholding is very poor and hence the Shannon’s Entropy (SE)
thresholding is implemented to improve the pneumonia infection due to COVID-19 [32]. The entropy
assisted image processing is normally considered to identify the abnormalities in the image for further
examination.
The SE considered in this work is discussed below;
Let, AxB depicts a gray scale image of a chosen dimension and f ( X ,Y ) denotes the pixel
arrangement with distributions;

X {1,2,...,A} and Y {1,2,...,B} , If we consider that the image has L

number of thresholds, then the total thresholds of the image will be; T  {10,1,2,..., L - 1} and the following
expression will relate the image dimension with the threshold distribution;

f ( X ,Y )  T( X ,Y )  Grayscale image

(1)

The regulated grayscale image is depicted as R  { r0 , r1 ,..,rL 1 }
In multi-threshold operation, the above equation can be expressed as;
R( T )  r0 ( t1 )  r1( t2 ),..,rL 1( tk 1 )

(2)

Tmax  max{ R( T )}

(3)

T

Where, Eqn (3) depicts the optimal value of the SE, which is to be maximized based on the chosen
threshold value during the multi-thresholding operation. In this work, Tmax for the chosen test image
with a dimension AxB is achieved using the FA. This work implemented a Brownian walk assisted FA as
discussed in [31].
The expression of the FA implemented in this work is depicted below;

/2

where Fit 1 =revised location of ith firefly, Fit =initial location of ith firefly, 0 e

(4)


Dij2

( F jt  Fit ) = attraction

among fireflies, A =random variable,  and  are the spatial and temporal exponents, respectively.
In this work, the FA is employed to identify Tmax ; with the help of a heuristic search operation. The
FA parameters are assigned as discussed by Rajinikanth et al. [31] and the tuned FA is allowed to
randomly vary the threshold values until the maximized SE is attained.
2.3 Image post-processing
The performance of the image based disease evaluation depends mainly on the outcome of the postprocessing technique, which helps to extract the pneumonia infected section from the lung CTI. In this

Preprint Submitted to: Entropy on 14th April 2020

work, the Markov-Random-Field (MRF) segmentation technique discussed by the work of Palani et al.
[30] and Rajinikanth et al. [31] is adopted. This procedure consists of the morphology based enhancement
and clustering assisted segmentation of the image. This procedure works based on the MRF-Expectation
Maximization (MRF-EM) idea and the information on this procedure is clearly discussed in the above
said works.
Let, a grayscale image has the following representation;

Im age  I ( X ,Y ) 0  I  L  1

(5)

where I represents the intensity of the image with pixel distribution ( X ,Y ) . During the
segmentation operation, MRF will estimate the pattern of every pixel by grouping it into a set of random
variables; like Z  { z1 , z2 ,...,z N } zi  1.
In the implemented work, the essential labels for the MRF-EM segmentation is assigned as three,
which segregated the image into background, normal section and COVID-19 infection.
In this work, the assigned labels are arranged as follows;

k1  I ( X ,Y )  z1 0  I  t1
k2  I ( X ,Y )  z2 t1  I  t2

(6)

k3  I ( X ,Y )  z3 t2  I  tL 1
In MRF-EM technique, the segmentation process initially enhances the image by minimizing the
energy function and then implements a segmentation technique; which separates the enhanced image
into three sections. Other essential information on MRF-EM segmentation can be found in [30,31].
2.4 Validation of proposed system
During the medical data assessment, the merit of the computerized disease inspection systems are
usually authenticated based on the performance measures attained during the testing and validation
using a benchmark datasets. The regular measures considered include; Jaccard, Dice, accuracy, precision,
sensitivity, specificity, and Negative Predictive Value (NPV). If attained values are better (closer to unity
or nearer to 100%), then the implemented disease examination scheme is confirmed as a better procedure.
Further, the clinical significance of the considered scheme is to be validated using the medical data
attained from real patients. In the proposed work also, similar procedure is followed to authenticate the
performance of the proposed COVID-19 lesion detection system. Initially, the developed scheme is tested
using the benchmark dataset existing with the GTI and later, its performance is tested by considering the
clinical grade CTI collected from COVID-19 infected patients.

Results

This section of the research depicts the investigational outcome attained using the proposed scheme.
This scheme is implemented using following workstation; Intel i5 2.GHz processor with 8GB RAM and
2DB VRAM equipped with the MATLAB software. Experimental results of this study confirm that this
scheme requires a mean time of 41 sec to process a CTI image with a dimension of 512x512x1 pixels. The
advantage of this scheme is that it is a fully automated practice and requires the operator’s assistance
only for; (i) Preliminary tuning of the FA parameters and (ii) Fixing the number of iterations for the MRFEM segmentation process.
The proposed scheme is initially tested using the benchmark images available in [28]. The chosen
COVID-19 CTI and the related results attained with the proposed scheme is depicted in Figure 4. Figure
4(a) and (b) presents the chosen test image and artifact removed image respectively. Figure 4(c) shows the
threshold image with FA+SE. Figure 4 (d) and (f) presents the initial and final enhancement with the
MRF-EM technique, and the convergence of the Expectation Maximization (EM) search for a chosen
iteration (3 trials) is depicted in Figure 4(e). Figure 4(g) and (h) depicts the segmented background and
the infection section and the smoothened binary form of the infection is presented in Figure 4(i). Finally,
Figure 4(j) depicts the GTI of the test image shown in Figure 4(a). Finally, a relative assessment between
Figure 4(i) and (j) is executed and the essential performance measures discussed in sub-section 3.4 are
computed and by using these values, a confusion matrix is formed as illustrated in Figure 5. For the
chosen CTI, the proposed method helped to achieve better value of Jaccard (87.43%) and Dice (93.29%).
Further, the segmentation accuracy achieved with the proposed method is 98.48%.

the assessment and from every patient, 15 numbers of 2D slices are extracted for the assessment. This
work considered 45 grayscale images for the assessment and the attained result of this work confirmed

Discussions

Starting from the date of its origin in Wuhan-China, COVID-19 has led to a major health crisis
throughout the world and caused a considerable numbers of the infection as well as the morbidity rate
[4]. One of the unusual features of the SARS-CoV-2 infection is that the virus infects both the upper and
the lower respiratory tract. Most of the COVID-19 infected patients exhibit symptoms such as fever, dry
cough and dyspnoea. Bilateral ground-glass opacities have been commonly reported in the CT scans of
the COVID-19 infected patients. This specific infection has exhibited an unusually high level of
pathogenecity leading to excessive lung damage [37].
With the number of infections rising every day, a need for the rapid testing of the respiratory
specimens and a computer based automated analysis of the CT scans need to be performed in routine.
Due to the high burden on the health care system, systems for automated analysis and screening need to
be rapidly employed in health care facilities. In this regard, a need seems to have arisen for the
identification and testing of effective algorithms for the automated segmentation and processing of CT
scan images. Since such procedures have an implication towards the reduction in the burden of
healthcare workers, researchers need to rapidly test and ascertain various algorithms which have high
efficiency towards extractions of lesions formed due to COVID-19.
At present, several countries have implemented a “lockdown” intervention in the form of
restrictions on travel and gatherings. This scenario has already posed a huge burden on the economy in
addition to the already existing burden on the healthcare system due to the high case loads. In this
regard, a mass screening facility for the screening of CT images as proposed in this research work will
have a huge impact in terms of the reduction of this burden.

Conclusion

The objective of this research is to propose an automated image examination scheme to detect and
extract the COVID-19 lesions from the lung CT scan images. This work implemented a sequence of
procedures to extract the COVID-19 lesion with greater accuracy. This work employed the image
processing methods, such as artifact removal, FA and SE based three-level thresholding to enhance the
image, MRF-EM segmentation to extract the COVID-19 lesion and a relative assessment of the extracted
binary image with the GTI to compute the performance measures. This work initially considered the 2D
CTI of benchmark COVID-19 dataset as well as the clinical-grade 2D slices for the experimental
investigation. The initial result attained with the benchmark dataset offered a mean segmentation
accuracy of >92% on 50 images of dimension 512x512x1 pixels. The results attained with the clinical grade
CTI also offered better segmentation of the COVID-19 lesion. The experimental results attained from this
study confirmed the superiority of the proposed scheme and in future, this scheme can be used to
examine the clinically obtained lung CTI of COVID-19 patients.
