Abstract
The recent SARS-COV-2 virus outbreak has created an unprecedented global health crisis! The
disease is showing alarming trends with the number of people getting infected with this disease,
new cases and death rate are all highlighting the need to control this disease at the earliest. The
strategy now for the governments around the globe is how to limit the spread of the virus until
the research community develops treatment/drug or vaccination against the virus. The outbreak
of this disease has unsurprisingly led to huge volume of research within a short period of time
surrounding this disease. It has also led to aggressive social media activity on twitter, Facebook,
dedicated blogs, news reports and other online sites actively involved in discussing about the
various aspects of and related to this disease.
It becomes a useful and challenging exercise to draw from this huge volume of research, the
key papers that form the research front, its influence in the research community, and other
important research insights. Similarly, it becomes important to discern the key issues that
influence the society concerning this disease. The paper is motivated by this. It attempts to
distinguish which are the most influential papers, the key knowledge base and major topics
surrounding the research covered by COVID-19. Further it attempts to capture the society’s
perception by discerning key topics that are trending online. The study concludes by
highlighting the implications of this study.

Introduction
Coronaviruses are viruses that circulate among animals and are named because of the crownlike spikes (protein spikes) that protrude from their surface resembling the sun’s corona. The
first transmission of this type of virus from animals to humans happened in 2002 in the
Guangdong province of China which resulted in SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome).
Bats were thought to be the potential source of this virus. A novel coronavirus (nCoV) was
identified in early January 2020 which was traced to the severe pneumonic outbreak of an
undocumented cause in early December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, China. Similar to SARS,
bats are seen as the potential source from which this virus has spread to humans. Due to rapid
spread of the virus within a short time globally resulting in health emergencies in a number of

countries, WHO declared this as a pandemic on 11th March 2020. Initially the virus was named
2019-nCoV but later was named SARS-CoV-2 due to its "genetic relationship to the SARSCOV-1 virus"(Medscape, 2020)
The entire human population is at potential risk as being a new virus nobody has prior immunity
to it. There is no vaccine and no specific treatment for the disease and is highly transmissible.
Epidemiological estimation at present is that on an average, one infected person will infect
between two to three other people. The spread has been from respiratory droplets and from
contaminated surfaces. The world is facing a common challenge; how to control the spread of
COVID-19 and what can be the effective interventions to control mortality. The early examples
from China suggested the most effective method to control the spread of the virus is through
lockdowns and social distancing measures. The example of South Korea suggested testing as
the major component of the mitigation measures. Some studies pointed out the importance of
hand hygiene and face masks in controlling the virus. With new hotspots emerging, the number
of new cases and those not able to recover are raising new concerns every day. Risk and
uncertainty behind this disease control has generated a global concern for health, economy, and
for persons at large. The alarming spread of the virus has shocked people across the world
pushing among others researchers to understand the virus—its structure, transmission,
replication mechanism, latency, etc. and promising interventions that can effectively control it.
Extensive global efforts are undertaken to develop vaccine and drug. This is unsurprisingly
leading to huge volume of research activity within a short period of time increasing at an
exponential rate. As the recent editorial published in The Lancet highlights “The whole-genome
sequence of SARS-CoV-2 had been obtained and shared widely by mid-January, a feat not
possible at such speed in previous infectious disease outbreaks” The editorial points out the
importance of the need for development of effective diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccine for
the virus. Examining from the Dimensions database as of 22 April, it was found that 1633
clinical trials are being conducted on the virus and 171 policy documents have been published
so far. The number of research papers, clinical trials at different phases within such a short
period is unprecedented and shows the intensive efforts of the global research community to
understand the different aspects of this disease and address it. Seven patents have also been
granted. It is important to capture insights of influential research and innovation from this
ongoing activity for policy makers and research scholars from cross-disciplinary areas to build
up further on this valuable repository. Societal impact and what aspects are of concern to the
people at large are difficult to capture. One useful method would be from online trends
surrounding this disease that would indicate to some extent the key issues that are influencing
the society at large. The present study is motivated by this and applies tools and techniques of
scientometrics to uncover insights from research papers.
Scientometrics applies various mathematical and statistical techniques to capture insights of
research activity from research papers and patents and other published sources including online
sources (Altmetrics) by constructing various types of indicators. Citation based analysis is a
prominent method to capture academically significant and theoretically relevant material (see
for example Glanzel, 2003). Keeping in view the research activity in this area started primarily
with the outbreak of this disease, impact captured through citations would not give a correct
picture as citations takes time to accrue. This is true for research paper as well as patent
citations. Citations that influence current research activity would however be useful to

construct the present knowledge base. One of the useful method that can do so is based on cocitation analysis which captures frequency with which two documents are cited together
(Small, 1973). Co-Citation establishes an intellectual relationship with earlier literature in a
field/subfield/area of research; strength of relationship based on frequency of co-citation pairs.
The rise of social networking websites like twitter, Facebook etc. provides researchers a wider
scope to share their scholarly publications. Altmetrics allows to track and capture online impact
of scholarly research and thus broadly indicates papers that are influencing the research
community. To put it in a proper perspective, one can borrow from William (2017), “Altmetrics
are measurements of how people interact with a given scholarly work”. Altmetrics or article
level metrics according to Das and Mishra (2014) is a “new trendsetter” to measure “impact of
scientific publication and their social outreach to intended audience”. It reflects “a scholarly
article’s popularity, usage, acceptance and availability” by using an altmetric score.
Google Trends which was launched in 2006, primarily shows how frequently a particular
search term is entered in comparison with all other search terms in different regions and
languages (Google, 2017). In Google trends level of interest in a topic is approximated using
search volume of Google. Sullivan (2016) estimated searches on Google Trends reached 2
trillion in 2016! Thus, this is one of the most significant source of data if it is properly analysed.
One of the most influential study was by Ginsberg et al. (2006) which showed that Google
Trends traced and predicted the spread of influenza earlier than the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention. Jun et al. (2018) provides a good assessment of research studies in the past
decade which have utilized Google Trends. They highlight the diverse fields in which this has
been used for, from merely describing and diagnosing research trends to forecasting changes.
According to Mavragani et al. (2018) “Google Trends shows the changes in online interest for
time series in any selected term in any country or region over a selected time period, for
example, a specific year, several years, 3 weeks, 4 months, 30 days, 7 days, 4 hours, 1 hour, or
a specified time-frame.” They argue that as the internet penetration is increasing web based
search activity has become a valid indicator of public behaviour.
The paper positions itself in this direction; applying various tools and techniques of
scientometrics, Altmetrics and Google Trends to draw meaning from the huge volume of
research papers and online activity surrounding this pandemic. The study attempts to answer
the following research questions:
 What are the key papers that captures the most relevant research, areas and topics on
COVID-19?


What is the knowledge base that influences current research on this pandemic?



What are the key aspects of this pandemic that is influencing the society at large?

Method: The study has used various types of data sets and analytical techniques as highlighted
below to capture the research trends and also assess this disease influence on the society. The
Dimensions database (www.dimensions.ai) was used for this study. This database has various
unique features which makes it very useful to capture various aspects of research activity. It
provides dynamic Altmetrics score for each article. The database unlike source based
classification (journal classification) used in indexing articles in SCI and Scopus database uses
article level classification. Only when an article cannot be classified individually due to lack

of information, it uses the Fields of Research (FOR) classification system. The FOR2 has three
hierarchical levels: Divisions (represents a broad subject area or research discipline), with the
next two levels Groups and Fields representing increasingly detailed subsets of these
categories. In FOR there are 22 Divisions, 157 Groups and 1238 Fields. Dimensions has
incorporated only the Groups in its classification system. Thus classification article level
provides a more informed assessment of the topic covered by it then based on journal level
classification which is a macro level classification. These features motivated us to use this
database for this study.
The articles on this virus were extracted using the search string "Covid-19" Or "SARS-CoV2" Or “SARS-CoV2” Or "2019-nCoV" on April 12, 2020 from this database. The final search
string was developed based on review of contemporary studies and deleting those search
keywords that lead to noises. For example, it was found that nCoV which some studies have
used also identifies papers that cover MERS (Middle-East respiratory syndrome). This was
first reported in 2012, was initially called novel coronavirus or nCoV as it was a species of
coronavirus. Many studies had applied search string without hyphen which also results in
extracting papers not covering this disease. The search string applied on the publications
database of Dimensions resulted in 9146 papers, containing 7332 articles and 1814 pre-prints.
This data set of 9146 papers were further used for analysis. Influential papers were
distinguished by using Altmetric score which is a weighted count of all the online attention of
a research paper. The altmetrics data was captured from Dimensions database which draws
data from altmetrics.com of capturing online activity of research papers on Facebook, twitter,
blogpost, news reports etc. The score changes as people mentioning the paper increases (only
one mention per user is considered). Each category of mention carries different base amount
so a news article contributes more than a blog post which in turn contributes more than a tweet
in the final score.
Country wise analysis showed that around 78 percent of the total papers were contributed by
ten countries. Further analysis of research activity of the ten identified countries was done using
altmetric and citation analysis. Word cloud provides a high visual representation of concepts
that a paper had frequently applied. It is based on Burst algorithm that captures the sudden rise
in the usage of a word. Mane and Borner (2004) highlighted the usefulness of burst words as
according to them “it helps humans mentally organize and electronically access and manage
large complex information spaces”. Using R programming tools, word cloud was constructed
from keywords of the data set. The words with higher frequency in the overall corpus of papers
(herein 9146) have a larger font size and acquires more space in a visualisation. Word Cloud
was used to get visualisation of 70 most frequent words; the number of words chosen was
limited by the clarity of visualisation.
Co-citation analysis helps to capture papers that are co-cited together in a large number of
papers. The highly co-cited papers is seen as the core knowledge base of research area at a
particular period. This analysis was undertaken to identify the key knowledge base behind the

identified papers. Dimensions database was used to extract a bibliographic mapping file for the
papers. Two software’s Pajek and VOSviewer were used for co-citation analysis. Initially the
bibliographic mapping file was run on the VOSviewer software to identify the most co-cited
papers. The co-cited papers were identified at four levels (trim levels) to have a deeper insight
of the core knowledge base: Level 1 identified 51 papers co-cited 77 or more times; Level 2
identified 26 papers co-cited 126 or more times; Level 3 identified 10 papers co-cited 277 or
more times, and Level 4 identified 5 papers co-cited 463 or more times. For each of the trim
levels a network file was obtained from the VOSviewer software. The network file was then
run on Pajek software to create a refined co-citation network map so as to avoid overlapping
of nodes. The final visualisation was done for the refined map in the VOSviewer software. Data
for the Policy Documents referencing these top ten co-cited papers was done by accessing
altmetrics.com directly from the dimensions database.
Another question which the study explored is the impact of this virus on the society primarily
what are the key aspects of and related to this disease that has influenced the society at large.
Google trend analysis of key topics have been undertaken to capture this aspect. Google trends
website (https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=US) was first accessed on 10th April 2020. The
topics were chosen based on closely monitoring the news items, and also finally choosing from
a large set of topics. Choice for example of ‘pandemic’ was seen to have initial burst but
declined quickly. Vaccine was trending highly but we found lot of noise in this term. The final
six topics chosen were “Social distancing”, “Quarantine”, “COVID-19”, “Coronavirus”, “Face
Mask” and “Hydroxychloroquine”. Data for each of the topics was finally taken on 16 April,
2020. For country specific comparison data for five countries having maximum cases of
COVID-19 namely USA, Italy, Spain, France, Germany and two emerging economies India
and Brazil was also obtained. Hydroxychloroquine was not used in country specific search as
it was only visible trending for three countries among the chosen seven countries. Google trend
analysis was not done for China as there is much restricted access to Google in that country.
Results
Insights from COVID-19 research papers
One of the first important observation is the intensity with which research on COVID-19 and
related aspects is going on globally. Search conducted in two different time periods, 28th March
and then on 12th April showed that 2172 and 9146 papers were published in these two periods;
almost 320 percent growth during such a short time.
The insights that we draw from our analysis of the 9146 papers is presented in different sections
below
Popular research papers: Altmetrics and Content analysis
Ten most popular research papers among the 9146 COVID-19 papers were extracted on the
basis of their Altmertrics score on April 12, 2020. Table 1 highlights these influential papers.

Note: Paper Pradhan, “P., Pandey, A. K., Mishra, A., Gupta, P., Tripathi, P. K., Menon, M. B. et al. (2020).
Uncanny similarity of unique inserts in the 2019-nCoV spike protein to HIV-1 gp120 and Gag. doi:
10.1101/2020.01.30.927871” with 14263 altmetric score was also one of the popular paper. This paper is not
given here because it has been withdrawn by the authors subsequently

Content analysis of the ten papers gives us a broad idea of the papers and some insights of why
they have become popular. Anderson et al. (2020), the study most popular on social media
platforms (number of tweets more than three times the next popular paper) commented that
“SARS-COV-2” is the seventh coronavirus to infect humans”. The study found that SARSCOV-2 is not a product of purposeful manipulation and is most likely the result of natural
selection of human or human-like ACE2 receptor. The study also found that SARS-COV-2
spike protein has high affinity to bind to human ACE2 receptor. Issues of how the human body
binds to the virus is an active area of research which thus has attracted so much attention. van
Doremelen et al. (2020) analysed the “aerosol and surface stability of SARS-COV-2 and
compared it with SARS-COV-1. The study highlighted the need to protect from five
environmental conditions: aerosols, plastic, stainless steel, copper and cardboard. Further it
showed that SARS-COV-2 remains viable in aerosols for 3 hours, on plastic and stainless steel
for 3 days, 4 hours on copper and on cardboard for 24 hours. The study found that the stability
of SARS-COV-1 is similar on plastic, stainless steel and aerosols to SARS-COV-2 and
different to SARS-COV-2 on cardboard (8 hours) and copper (8 hours). The implications of
this study can be clearly seen in the preventive measures of COVID-19. This study was also
cited in policy documents. Li et al. (2020) estimated that 86% of COVID-19 cases went

undocumented in China prior to their travel restrictions. The study also estimated that the
undocumented cases contagiousness or transmission rate was 55% of documented infections,
yet 79% of documented infection cases were due to these undocumented infections. The
suggestion of this study that undocumented infections “isolation and identification is necessary
to fully control the virus” is very important and the spread of this virus may be seen as a
consequence of this. This study also was cited in policy documents.
Leung et al. (2020) explored “the importance of respiratory droplet and aerosol route of
transmission” by quantifying the “amount of respiratory virus in exhaled breath of participants”
that have acute respiratory virus illness (ARI). The 246 participants were divided in two groups,
one wearing surgical face mask and other not wearing face mask. The study found that surgical
face masks can efficaciously reduce the respiratory droplet emission of influenza virus particles
but not in aerosols. They also found that surgical face masks can be used by ill patients of
COVID-19 to reduce “onward transmission”. Face mask is getting increasing attention and
now being incorporated as essential guideline in health policies of different countries. The
paper provided a good empirical support to this i.e. face masks. Shen et al. (2020) study
examined covalescent plasma transfusion benefit in treatment of critically ill COVID-19
patients. The clinical trial was conducted on 5 critically ill patients with COVID-19 and acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) along with certain other conditions. The study found
decline in viral load, clinical conditions of patients improved as “indicated by body temperature
reduction, improved PAO2/FIO2 and chest imaging”. This treatment is now being incorporated
in many countries. This study is first of its kind in this direction and is thus not surprising that
it is one of the most popular research paper in COVID-19.
Caly et al. (2020) tested Ivermectin’s (an FDA approved drug) antiviral activity towards
SARS-COV-2. The study found that a single dose of Ivermectin was “able to control viral
replication within 24-48 hours” in the system provided by them. Doctors are struggling to
control this dangerous disease. A study like this which gives some hope is quickly tracked which
is indicated by its high altmetrics score. Wu and McGoogan (2020) summarised the key
findings of Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The study found that 81% of
cases were mild with no deaths, 14% were severe with no deaths and 5% were critical cases
with 49% Case Fatality Rate (CFR). The study also found that patients with comorbid
conditions like cardiovascular diseases and diabetes had 10.5% and 7.3% CFR respectively.
The disease started in Wuhan, China and within a short time a large number of people were
affected by it. The popularity of this study can be seen from the insights emerging from this
study that provides a good empirical estimation of the effects of this disease. The fact that
policy documents are also referencing this paper also substantiates this claim.
Lauer et al. (2020) estimated “the length of incubation period of COVID-19 and described its
public health implications”. Data of 181 cases that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection
outside Hubei province was taken for the study. The study estimated 5.1 days to be the median
incubation period of COVID-19. It also found that patients will develop symptoms within 14
days. There is however chance of 1-2 percent of patients developing symptoms after 14 days.
The upper bound of 14 days thus has been proposed by the study to be the length of quarantine
and active monitoring. The study thus provided a good estimation of the period of quarantine
and thus it is getting high attraction from scholars is not surprising. The paper is also cited by
WHO in a policy document.

Cao et al. (2020) analysed 199 patients with positive SARS-CoV-2. The patients were assigned
in a 1:1 ratio and 99 patients received lopinavir-ritonavir twice daily with standard care and
100 patients received only standard care (comprised of ventilation, supplemental oxygen etc)
for 14 days. The study found that lopinavir-ritonavir was not able to “accelerate clinical
improvement, reduce mortality or diminish throat viral RNA detectability in patients with
serious COVID-19”. The study is important as it cautions doctors towards administrating this
drug for COVID-19. The study by Fang et al. (2020) highlighted that ACE2 (angiotensinconverting enzyme 2) expression is increased in patients with diabetes, and hypertension. The
study underscored the reasons behind it to the treatment being administered to them; these
patients are treated with ACE inhibitors and ARBs (angiotensin II type-I receptor blockers)
which increases the expression of ACE2. As the SARS-CoV-2 binds to target cells via ACE-2
the study thus concludes that infection is facilitated in patients with these conditions. The
importance of the study can be seen in the case of making aware, protecting and preventing
the spread of COVID-19 to these vulnerable populations. This has largely contributed to its
popularity.

Table 2 points to some interesting aspects of research activity in this area. These ten countries
account for almost 78 percent of total papers with China and USA accounting for 45 percent
of the total. China, USA and UK are actively collaborating among themselves and also with
other countries. This is a good indication as global collaborative efforts, pooling each other
resources are required to meet the challenges posed by this disease. A few leading universities
can be discerned which are actively involved in this research. Popularity of a paper can also be
seen influenced by journals; papers with high altmetrics score strongly correlate with journals
that have high reputation in the field (high impact factor, leading journal of the community).

The table provides a broad indication of intensity of research happening in different fields.
Figure 1 presents a word cloud of most frequently used terms in Covid-19 Papers.

Figure 1: Word Cloud of Documents of “Covid19” Papers

The word cloud shows key aspects that have been part of many studies. The word cloud maps
the topics of research surrounding this disease. The two keywords, for example “Pandemics”
and “China” that have maximum occurrence in papers indicated by large font size which shows
that these two aspects were discussed in many papers. It is known that China was the source of
this infection and WHO declared this disease as a pandemics. Thus increasing research mention
of these two keywords is not surprising. Coronavirus primarily affects animals, SARS disease
as a result of transmission of coronavirus from animal to humans, travel has contributed
maximum to the spread of this disease, are all visible prominently in this word cloud. Thus,
examination of the word cloud is useful to have a broad view of key areas of research in the
9146 papers.
Co-Citation Analysis of COVID-19 Papers
Figure 2 shows co-citation networks at four trim levels.

Figure 2: Co-Citation Networks at various trim levels

It can be observed from figure 2 that Trim level 4 that contains top 5 co-cited papers is a
complete cluster. A complete cluster according to GMÜR (2003) is when “each reference is
connected to other references and there is no dominant document within the cluster”.
Table 4 highlights the details of these co-cited papers at trim level 3 which identifies top 10 cocited papers. It also includes the top 5 co-cited paper at Trim level 4 (refer methodology for
details).

*The articles are ranked based on total link strength
Table 4 in a sense identifies the proximity of papers in “terms of content” (GMÜR, 2003).
According to Trujillo and Long (2018) the results of document co-citation analysis shows the
“peer-recognised” literature via their “citation patterns”. This analysis has provided us the
scope of mapping the COVID-19 literature. It can be observed that studies relating to
epidemiology and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 have the greatest Co-citation
frequency. Strength of links of Huang et al. (2020) paper was the highest and is the most
referenced paper in key Policy documents.
Pandemic’s Influence on the Society
Figure 3 provides global Google trends of six topics (refer methodology for details) currently
talked about extensively on social media, news reports or in general public discussion. It can
be observed the otherwise flat line of COVID-19 started seeing spikes in late February, 2020.
This is because the term came into existence when WHO on Feb 11 named the disease from

the virus as COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019). It can also be observed that the term
reached maximum level of interest during the end of March as cases started showing significant
increase in countries USA, India etc. Measures like quarantine has strong societal influence
and thus useful to look at trend in this topic. Another topic “Pandemic” saw maximum interest
around March 11, as WHO announced COVID-19 pandemic on that day. It can also be seen
that the interest about this topic fell shortly thereafter. As discussed in the methodology, this
topic hence was not chosen further in this study for Google trend examination.
Hydroxychloroquine term has seen a great amount of interest from middle of March, 2020.
This can be traced to the study by reputed French physician and microbiologist Didier Raoult
who highlighted the use of this antimalarial drug in the treatment of this disease. It led to French
President and US President endorsing this line of treatment which created favourable public
opinion in many countries towards this drug. Liu et al. (2020) whose work has also attracted
high altmetrics attention found the drug to be effective in “inhibiting SARS-COV-2 in vitro”.
This line of treatment and the robustness of the methodology and findings have also generated
critical comments, see for example Grens (2020). India has become a key source for this
medicine and already exported it to number of countries. Thus a high degree of activity in
Google as seen through Google trend can be due to various factors, positive as well as adverse
reactions. Similar public opinion generated by studies and endorsement can be seen in
YouTube searches in Face Mask.

Figure 3: Globally trending topics related to COVID-19
Source: Google Trends
Figure 4 provides the comparison of Google trends of “Social Distancing”, “COVID-19”,
“Quarantine”, and “Lockdown” and “Face Mask” from 16 Feb to 14 April 2020. Figure 4(a)
presents a global picture of these topics and Figure 4 (b) shows data for five countries having
maximum cases of COVID-19 namely USA, Italy, Spain, France, Germany and two emerging
economies India and Brazil.

Figure 4: Global Comparison of key trending topics
(a) Global Trend

Three of the five topics chosen restrict people’s movement. Social distancing which basically
means keeping a safe distance of around 6 feet from others and avoiding places where this kind
of distance cannot be made like schools, workplaces, a sports game or a temple. The second
one is Quarantine which applies to a person who have been in exposed to coronavirus or
patients having coronavirus. The person has to avoid contact with people till the specified
incubation period of the virus to see if they develop symptoms. Third Lockdown, the term
mainly used to describe the confinement of prisoners to their cells has now a changed definition
during this outbreak. Through lockdown people are not allowed to leave their local area,
building and it is used as a control measure to prevent COVID-19 disease transmission. It can
be seen from figure 4 (b) that “Lockdown” is the most popular topic worldwide as well as at
the country level. According to World Economic forum 2.6 billion people i.e. one thirds of the
world population are under some kind of lockdown.3 This figure alone constitutes India’s 1.3
billion, the largest lockdown in the world. Thus it is unsurprising to see the popularity of this
topic over others in India. These control measure have major economic, psychological and
social impacts and in turn affects lives of all the people involved. A worrying trend is the low
comparative interest in Social Distancing in most of the countries and almost negligible
comparative interest in countries like Indian and Brazil. The stand taken by Brazil through her
President of opening up and has been critical of measures like social distancing and lockdown
may have contributed to this type of trend.

Note: Comparative interest over time of Social Distancing for India and Face Mask and
Social Distancing for Brazil were negligible, so these terms have been removed for the Graph
for these countries.

Discussion and Conclusion
COVID-19 disease took the world by surprise. The alarming spread of the disease, challenge
to control its spread and its grave health consequences, lack of vaccine or effective drug among
others has prompted researchers to actively work on various aspects of this disease. This has
led to a huge volume of research output within a short period of time. The various aspects
surrounding this disease has also effected society’s perception of this disease. Drawing insights
from this huge volume of research output is a challenge as well as an exercise of significant
importance for the policy makers and research community. Scientometrics provides various
tools and techniques to uncover insights from research papers. Altmetrics and Google trends
are novel approaches to track online impact. These tools and techniques was used in this study
to analyse 9146 papers that were discerned from the Dimensions database covering COVID19 for the period upto 12th April, 2020. Content analysis of a set of ten key papers was also
undertaken to draw qualitative insights of these influential papers.
Some of the insights from this study reveals the key areas in which research has progressed.
Their visible impact can be seen in their altmetrics score and more directed impact in their
citation in key policy documents. Key policy influence such as period of quarantine, treatment
type, use of face masks, population more vulnerable to disease etc can be traced to the
influential papers that were discerned from this study. It would be however fallacy of
generalisation if we say that these papers were the only influential factors behind the policy
decisions. It is also interesting to see how papers had attracted attention from different online
sources like twitter, news, blog, and facebook. Thus, the importance of these sources in
influencing research impact calls for researchers to aggressively use these modes for
dissemination of their study findings.
Another important insight comes from the active collaboration seen in research papers. China
and USA drive this research globally and are also actively engaging with other countries in
research. This finding is drawn from top ten active countries which constitute almost 78% of
the total research output as visible from research papers. Word cloud showed the influential
topics of research surrounding COVID-19 research. This type of visual maps provide a good
indication of key topics that constitute research activity in a area at a period of time. Co-citation
analysis identified the knowledge base that influences current research on this pandemic. It was
observed that all of the top co-cited papers were published in high impact factor journals. It
was also observed that most of the studies were driven by epidemiology and clinical
characteristics of the disease.
Google trends analysis showed how the disease shapes the public opinion on certain topics.
Global trending topics incorporated interest over time in web, news, Google shopping and
YouTube searches. A sudden rise in a topic’s interest could be traced to various exogenous
factors. The trend, for example in Hydroxychloroquine, use of this antimalarial drug in the
treatment of this disease could be seen the interplay of various forces, the impact of research
paper, political endorsement and critical questioning of the research community, doctors etc to
the effectiveness of this line of treatment. The trends observed in measures like lockdown,
social distancing and quarantine at global and country level showed the societal increasing
concern with these aspects.

The findings of this study suggests how the research and public interest has been shaped around
this disease. With so much information surrounding this disease, the study provides a space for
understanding its various aspects. The study however is limited as it has not examined patents,
clinical studies and policy documents. This may provide indications of implementable aspects
that draw from research. Future research intends to examine this.
