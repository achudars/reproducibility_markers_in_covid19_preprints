Introduction
Endpoint choice for randomized controlled trials of treatments for novel coronavirus-induced disease
(COVID-19) is complex. A new disease brings many uncertainties, but trials must start rapidly to identify
treatments that can be used as part of the outbreak response. COVID-19 presentation is heterogeneous,
ranging from mild disease that improves within days to critical disease that can last weeks to over a
month and can end in death. While improvement in mortality would provide unquestionable evidence
about clinical significance of a treatment, sample sizes for a study evaluating mortality are large and may
be impractical, particularly given a multitude of putative therapies to evaluate. Furthermore, patient
states in between “cure” and “death” represent meaningful distinctions. Clinical severity scores have
been proposed as an alternative. However, the appropriate summary measure for severity scores has
been the subject of debate, particularly in the context of much uncertainty about the time-course of
COVID-19. Outcomes measured at fixed time-points, such as a test comparing severity scores between
treatment and control at day 14, may risk missing the time of clinical benefit. An endpoint such as
time-to-improvement (or recovery), avoids the timing problem. However, some have argued that power
losses will result from reducing the ordinal scale to a binary state of “recovered” vs “not recovered.”
Methods
We evaluate statistical power for possible trial endpoints for COVID-19 treatment trials using simulation
models and data from two recent COVID-19 treatment trials.
Results
Power for fixed-time point methods depends heavily on the time selected for evaluation. Time-toimprovement (or recovery) analyses do not specify a time-point. Time-to-event approaches have
reasonable statistical power, even when compared to a fixed time-point method evaluated at the
optimal time.

Discussion
Time-to-event analyses methods have advantages in the COVID-19 setting, unless the optimal time for
evaluating treatment effect is known in advance. Even when the optimal time is known, a time-to-event
approach may increase power for interim analyses.

Introduction

Designing clinical trials for treatments for novel infectious disease brings many challenges, especially
during a rapidly evolving pandemic. A new disease brings uncertainties arising from an imperfect
understanding about the illness, little information about putative treatments, and complexities in
measuring relevant patient outcomes. A pandemic adds an overloaded medical system with limited
resources for research, heightened pressure to find effective treatments quickly, and unpredictability
about potential case numbers. Studies need to start quickly for enrollments to track the epidemic curve.
However, early on, information about endpoints may be lacking. This means trial design should be
appropriately flexible to respond to new information, but without compromising scientific rigor.
COVID-19 has a heterogeneous presentation and clinical course, ranging from asymptomatic to
critical disease (Table 1).1 While most infected patients present with asymptomatic or mild disease,
some develop severe or critical illness that can result in acute respiratory distress syndrome and death.
The most common symptoms are fever, dry cough, dyspnea, chest pain, fatigue and myalgia, while less
common symptoms are headache, dizziness, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. Most
patients present with signs of bilateral pneumonia2. Neurologic symptoms including taste and smell
disorders have been reported, with rare case reports of severe central nervous system affections.3
Thrombotic complications in critically ill patients have also been observed.4 Importantly, some COVID-19
patients recover quickly with limited (or no) complications, while patients suffering from severe disease
may take 6-8 weeks or longer for full recovery.5 This broad range of disease severity makes finding a
common endpoint for all COVID-19 trials impractical. Endpoints for a study population representing a
broad spectrum of disease may be different than those for a study with a narrow spectrum of disease.

4

We describe key considerations for selecting endpoints for COVID-19 treatment trials. We
evaluate endpoints according to clinical relevance, ease and reliability of measurement, interpretability
of its associated statistical analysis, and statistical efficiency. We discuss differences between fixed
time-point endpoints and those that naturally incorporate changes over time. We evaluate statistical
efficiency of multiple approaches with simulation models, as well as using data from two published
COVID-19 randomized trials.6,7
Methods

Endpoint selection
Treatments for COVID-19 are intended to be curative, with the goal that the patient will survive and
ultimately return to normal function. This contrasts with a disease such as stroke in which the goal of a
treatment may be to reduce stroke-induced impairments that occur across a spectrum.8 Likewise, a
benefit on mortality would be strong evidence of an effect, but deaths are relatively rare. A study
powered for mortality benefit would require a large sample size. For example, a sample size of around
2,000 is needed (for a two-arm study) to detect a hazard ratio (for death) of 0.65 with 85% power and a
type I error rate of 5% with a 10% mortality rate. Lower mortality rates require even larger studies. In a
setting with multiple putative therapies, studies powered for mortality will restrict the number of
therapies evaluated, which may slow provision of effective treatments to support the outbreak
response.
Furthermore, multiple clinical states in between “death” and “cure” represent meaningful
patient states. The World Health Organization (WHO) proposed an ordinal scale ranging from death to
full health, with states in between corresponding to the need for hospitalization, oxygen support
(including type of support needed), and need for additional medical support (Table 1).9 These states are
5

important markers of how a patient feels and of disease progression (or improvement). Mechanical
ventilation (intubation) marks a considerable worsening, as intubated patients often require treatment
with sedatives and even paralytics to address patient discomfort and maximize therapy. Intubation is
also associated with a host of complications leading to additional mortality and morbidity, such as
ventilator-associated pneumonia10, GI bleeding11, and severe physical deconditioning. In a case series
of 5,700 COVID-19 patients in New York, considerable numbers of patients remained intubated during
the entire study12. Shortening the duration in a state like intubation or avoiding intubation altogether
is of direct clinical benefit.
Timing of endpoint evaluation is another important consideration. A treatment effect that
occurs early but dissipates over time may not be clinically meaningful. A treatment effect may be missed
if evaluation is too early, before an intervention has had time for an effect. Timing of measurement is
therefore crucial and can be particularly challenging in a novel disease with substantial heterogeneity.
Time-to-event endpoints do not require specifying a fixed time (just the observation interval) and are
more robust in this regard. We note that longitudinal models of other endpoints are possible, such as a
mixed-effects proportional odds model13 but are not commonly used.
Table 2 describes multiple endpoints considered for COVID-19, largely from the perspective of a
definitive (Phase 3) trial. Endpoints for earlier phase studies may focus on evaluating mechanism (e.g.,
targeting a specific pathway) or evaluating activity so that “go/no-go” decisions for further evaluation in
larger trials can be made. Endpoints are evaluated according to ease of measurement, reproducibility,
whether they are clinically meaningful, and their ability to capture multiple clinical states and the timecourse of disease.
Meaningfulness and reproducibility can be distorted when states are influenced by external
factors, as may happen when patient numbers exceed hospital capacity. For example, ordinal categories
6

become less meaningful when mechanical ventilators are not available and patients who would
normally be in this category are shifted to others (or when guidelines recommending early intubation
are followed more rigorously in some centers than others). Further, non-invasive ventilators or highflow oxygen devices may not be utilized in settings where personal protection equipment is limited (or
in the absence of negative pressure rooms) due to concerns about health-care worker infection from
viral aerosolization. Similarly, hospitals exceeding capacity may discharge patients early due to demand
for beds. Additional concerns have been raised that one-unit changes in the ordinal scale are not
equally important. For example, extubation may represent a more meaningful improvement than being
moved from high-flow oxygen to standard, low-flow oxygen. Both improvements have implications on
health system resources; however, from the patient view, they may not be equal.
Endpoints used in other diseases have been considered. For example, the National Early
Warning Score (NEWS2)14 captures clinical deterioration in patients, but is not specific to COVID-19 and
might not be sensitive enough for this disease. Other measures, such as SOFA15 are well validated but
are specific to ICU patients. Patients who require intensive care have a high mortality of approximately
30 to 60%.16, 17, 18
Multiple laboratory parameters are associated with deterioration of clinical status, including
surrogates for organ injury and markers of systemic inflammation, e.g., markers of cardiac injury
(troponin T), elevated liver transaminases, creatinine levels, procalcitonin levels, D-Dimer
concentrations, fibrinogen19, lactate dehydrogenase20, and lymphopenia.21 Elevations in C-reactive
protein (CRP) and ferritin, further reflective of high levels of systemic inflammation, are also associated
with severe disease, consistent with the observed hyperinflammatory syndrome that appears to occur in
a subset of patients.21 While tracking these parameters is important to better understand COVID-19,
they do not directly measure how a patient functions or feels and may not correlate with clinical

7

outcome. In supplementary Table S1, we provide examples of endpoint choices for several COVID
clinical trials.

Statistical Considerations
To evaluate statistical considerations in more depth, we focus on four outcomes: time to death,
time to recovery/improvement, ordinal scale at a fixed time point, and ordinal scale averaged across
time points. We note that, with time-to-improvement/recovery models, the competing event of death
requires special handling. Patients who die during follow-up should not be censored at time of death,
as that assumes their recovery time would be like all who remain alive and unrecovered at that time. To
state the obvious, once dead, a patient cannot recover. A death must be set to an infinite recovery
time, so that at the end of follow-up, the patient is counted as “not recovered.” We achieve the same
objective by censoring deaths at the last observation day. Therefore, patients censored on the last
observation day reflect two different states: death and failure to recover by day 28. Standard survival
analysis methods can then be applied, but the “hazard” ratio refers to the instantaneous risk of a good
outcome. Hence, we use the term “recovery rate ratio” (or “improvement rate ratio”). We note that,
with administrative censoring from staggered entry before day 28, this approach corresponds to the
Fine-Gray approach to competing risks.22 With staggered entry, Fine-Gray censors deaths at the time
they would have been censored had they not died (i.e., time of administrative censoring).
Discretizing a continuous variable is commonly thought to result in a loss of efficiency.23,24
Similarly, reductions in efficiency may occur when an ordinal scale is discretized into a binary endpoint
and others have emphasized power advantages of a proportional odds model.25,26 Graubard and Korn
note that rank-based methods (such as the proportional odds model) may have lower power when the
marginal sums are not nearly uniform, compared to methods that use pre-assigned numeric values
8

(scores) for categories of the ordinal scale.27 Nonetheless, collapsing information can sometimes
increase power. For example, if the distribution of a continuous endpoint is skewed or has wide tails,
rank-based methods, or even dichotomizing and using a test of proportions, can be more powerful than
a t-test. Relatedly if assignment to some ordinal categories is haphazard, methods that collapse
categories can provide more power. Dichotomizing can also be useful when there is a clear cut-point
beyond which negative sequelae of a disease manifest, such as with hemoglobin A1c or fasting glucose
in diabetes. Table S2 provides a description of many statistical analysis options.
The endpoints considered are difficult to compare theoretically with respect to power. For
example, time to recovery dichotomizes an ordinal scale into “recovered” and “not recovered”, so one
might assume there should be a loss in power associated with using this approach. However, time to
recovery incorporates health states on multiple days instead of just one, which can increase power. For
instance, if the proportional odds model is evaluated so early that no one has recovered (or so late that
everyone has recovered), power for the proportional odds model on that day will be very low. Using an
analysis that incorporates the average ordinal score over multiple days solves that problem, but its
power gain is not as great as one might imagine because measurements on the same individual on
different days are likely to be highly correlated. Furthermore, a between-arm difference in an average
score may also be more difficult to interpret. For example, what does an average improvement of 0.4
units on an ordinal scale mean?
We also note that time-to-event analysis is advantageous from the perspective of interim
analyses, as data from all patients with any amount of follow-up time are included. This contrasts with a
fixed timepoint analysis, which only includes observations from patients who have made it to the
prescribed follow-up milestone (e.g., all 14 days). In rapidly enrolling trials, time-to-event analysis may
improve power to evaluate early efficacy (or harm) of treatments, and hence increase the speed at
which treatment recommendations can be made.
9

Evaluation of statistical efficiency and interpretability of methods
Power is compared using two simulation methods and applications to two published studies of COVID
treatments. For the simulation studies, ordinal trajectories were generated according to a random line,
θ0i + θ1i log(d) for person i, where d is the day since randomization. For day d, the ordinal score for that
day was given as floor[θ0i + θ1i log(d)], where the notation floor[x] indicates the integer part of x. Death
(score=7) and recovery (score=1) were considered absorbing states (i.e., values above 7 or below 1 were
set to 7 and 1, respectively). One can visualize the trajectory as a subject deterministically sliding up or
down their own “line of destiny” over 28 days and reporting their integer value each day. Loosely, 10%
(5%) of placebo (active) patients were destined to die (having a large value of θ1i) within the 28-day
observation period. The remaining subjects were destined to recover (with negative value of θ1i).
Multiple parameter values for generating θ0i and θ1i were considered until trajectories roughly reflected
our understanding of COVID-19 disease progression. Figure 1 depicts results for the reference scenario.
Each setting was simulated 1,000 times, with 800 subjects total, equal randomization to the two arms,
and 28 days of follow-up. We evaluated the proportional odds model at different days, a Wilcoxon ranksum test on the mean ordinal score (1-7) up to day 28, a test of proportions on day 28 mortality, and
Cox models for time to (a) recovery, (b) a 2-point improvement, and (c) death. One possible criticism of
the above simulations is that the proportional odds assumption may not hold. A second set of
simulations compared methods under the proportional odds assumption. Technical details and results
are given in the appendix.
Patient-level data from two published studies were obtained to compare methods. The
Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial stage 1 (ACTT-1) randomized 1,062 patients to remdesivir or placebo
and followed patients for 28 days.6 The primary outcome was time-to-recovery, although ordinal scales
10

were also assessed. Due to a surge in enrollments, the study exceeded its target sample size of 400
recoveries, reaching 482 by the time of the planned DSMB interim analysis. Data were taken from a
preliminary report from an April 28, 2020 data freeze (before results were made public and before
actively enrolled patients were offered cross-over treatment). Data cleaning for this data snapshot are
ongoing, and the results presented here are intended to inform trial design. We compare empirical
power for various methods with repeated random sampling of 50, 150 and 300 per arm. For each
sample size, we replicated random sampling 100,000 times. Additionally, we present multiple analyses
applied to the LOTUS study of lopinavir/ritonavir by Cao et al.7 This study was stopped prior to reaching
the pre-planned sample size. We present analyses with the original data (199 patients) as well as with
hypothetical augmented data corresponding to 398 patients.
Results

Simulation studies
Power comparisons for simulations are shown in Table 3. For the reference scenario, the proportional
odds model has increasingly better power for later days, with highest power at day 28. Empirical power
for both time-to-(2-point) improvement and time-to-recovery is somewhat lower than that for the
proportional odds model at the optimal time. Empirical power for mortality is notably lower than for
other methods, which is no surprise due to the low event rate and modest effect. We explored four
perturbations from this reference scenario to more fully assess performance. The perturbations were 1)
lagged treatment effect, 2) faster recovery, 3) faster mortality and 4) effect solely on mortality. (Table
S4). Under the lagged effect scenario, power for the proportional odds model decreases at days 7 and
14 but is similar on day 28 (compared to the reference scenario). This underscores the fragility in
getting the day right with the proportional odds model. The faster recovery scenario has similar relative
11

behavior to the reference scenario though power is uniformly increased. The faster mortality scenario
has power like the reference scenario. These two perturbations show some robustness of the
conclusions of the reference scenario. The last row of Table 3 provides scenarios with differences
between arms from mortality only. Here, mortality has the highest power, as expected. More deaths
on placebo necessarily implies more recoveries on treatment, which is why power for both time to
improvement and time to recovery is around 30%.
Simulation studies under models that enforce the proportional odds assumption are provided in
Table S3 and Figure S1. Results from these simulations show are similar. Namely, when the fixed
timepoint is chosen well, the proportional odds model performs well but suffers a loss of power if the
time point is chosen poorly.

Applications to published COVID-19 treatment studies
Table 4 shows estimates and p-values from various models applied to the ACTT-1 study data. At the
time of the data snapshot, the following proportion of subjects had ordinal score data available: 91%
day 7; 89% day 14, 74% day 21 and 70% day 28. On the observed data, the proportional odds model
estimates decrease over time (opposite the simulation results above), with estimates of 1.62, 1.50, 1.42,
1.34 for days 7, 14, 21 and 28, respectively. The odds ratio of 1.50 at day 14 indicates a 50% increase in
the odds of a one-category improvement for remdesivir relative to control (at day 14). The test of mean
difference between arms at days 7, 14, 21 and 28 gives estimates of 0.56, 0.62, 0.53, 0.41 for days 7, 14,
21, and 28, respectively. The average difference at day 14 indicates an average improvement of 0.62 on
the ordinal scale for remdesivir relative to placebo. The mean difference of the time-average (days 7,
14, 21 and 28) was 0.56. The time to recovery and time to (1- and 2-point) improvement analyses give
estimates of 1.32, 1.29 and 1.28, respectively. The recovery rate ratio of 1.32 indicates a 32% faster
12

(instantaneous) rate of recovery with remdesivir (relative to placebo). The hazard ratio (for mortality) of
0.70 indicates a lower hazard of death in the remdesivir group.
Table 4 also shows empirical power (proportion of statistically significant p-values <0.05 out of
the 100,000 simulations) for sample sizes of 50, 150, and 300 per group. Power is greatest at day 7
using the proportional odds model, with rejection rates of 24%, 62% and 97% for sample sizes of 50, 150
and 300 per group. Results for the t-test were similar, with rejection rates of 22%, 59% and 95% for the
three samples sizes. Rejection rates for the proportional odds model and t-test evaluated at day 14
were lower for all sample sizes (day 14 proportional odds rejection rates: 16%, 41% and 79%; day 14 ttest rejection rates: 17%, 46% and 85%, respectively for sample sizes of 50, 150 and 300 per group). By
day 28, empirical power was lower, although the t-test rejection rates were higher than for the
proportional odds (proportional odds rejection rates: 7%, 13% and 19%; t-test rejection rates: 9%, 20%
and 40%, respectively for sample sizes of 50, 150 and 300 per group). The lower number of
observations at the later time point explains some of the loss in power, although not entirely. The
proportion with observations at day 7 and day 14 was similar (91% vs 89%), and the power reductions
were considerable (62% vs 41% for the proportional odds model at day 7 and 14, respectively, with 150
per group).
Rejection rates for the recovery rate ratio were 18%, 48% and 87%, respectively for sample sizes
of 50, 150 and 300. Results for the time to improvements were 19%, 51% and 90% (one-point
improvement) and were 17%, 44% and 84% (two-point improvement) for sample sizes of 50, 150 and
300 per group, respectively. Rejection rates for the hazard ratio for mortality were 7%, 12% and 18%,
for the three sample sizes considered, consistent with the low power for mortality in this setting.
Table S3 in the appendix show results from the LOTUS study of lopinavir/ritonavir. In the
observed and augmented data analysis, none of the days the proportional odds was estimated were
13

statistically significant, while with the augmented data, the time to a two-point improvement indicated
a 31% faster rate of improvement with p<0.05.
Discussion
One important challenge with COVID-19 is disease heterogeneity. An endpoint of cure or
death would be the strongest clinical evidence of treatment effect. Trials using these endpoints may
take an unfeasibly long time and preclude evaluation of other candidate treatments. The WHO ordinal
scale reflects meaningful patient states. However, distinctions between categories may depend on
limited resources (such ventilators or high-flow oxygen devices). Further, local differences in standard
of care (including different guidelines recommending early intubation and/or limiting non-invasive
oxygen treatments) may affect results in multicenter trials. Ideally, such guidelines would be unified
within clinical trials, but dogmatic restrictions could limit enrollments. A placebo-controlled trial will
reduce the potential for subjectivity to influence changes made to a patient’s status.
Studies need to be launched quickly in order to inform the response, at a time when little
information about the disease may be available. Planning for additional trial flexibility, without
compromising scientific rigor, is important.28 Changes made to endpoints based on results external to
the trial (and prior to reviewing data) are acceptable.29 In the ACTT-1 trial, the initial primary endpoint
was the proportional odds model at day 14, based on early WHO guidance that recommended an
analysis of ordinal scale at a fixed time point. At the time, many thought the clinical course was more
like influenza illness, with recoveries occurring over two weeks. However, in late February, it became
apparent, that the course of illness was more prolonged than previously thought. Consequently, followup was extended to 28-days and simulation results (presented in this manuscript), revealed the fragility
of a fixed-time point analysis and highlighted the advantages of a time-to-recovery endpoint.
While both simulations and our examples show that power is comparable between a fixed-time
point analysis and a time-to event analysis if the timing of the former is chosen well, marked power
14

losses are apparent when this is not the case. Additionally, we believe that time-toimprovement/recovery analysis is easier to interpret. We also note that improvement in time-toimprovement/recovery is of relevance to the patient, as an indicator of faster improvement in clinical
status, but also to a health system at maximum capacity. While a mortality improvement would have
provided stronger evidence about treatment efficacy, initial estimates indicated a sample size of about
2,000 would be needed. This was deemed impractical given the goal to evaluate multiple therapeutic
candidates.
The time-to event analysis offers other advantages such as that, for interim analyses, all data
collected up until the data freeze were included, which can be important in an outbreak setting with
rapid study enrollment. The PALM Ebola virus disease treatment trial provides one example.30 In PALM,
the primary endpoint was 28-day mortality. Due to rapid enrollment, there was a striking discrepancy
between the number enrolled and the number with 28 days of follow-up. At the August 9, 2019 Data
and Safety Monitoring Board meeting, 673 patients (of the 725 target) were enrolled but only 376 had
28-day follow-up; the study had enrolled 93% of its targeted sample size, but information (for the
mortality proportion at day 28) was only 52%. A time-to-event analysis would have included data on all
participants (for their observed time), and information would have been 65-70% at this analysis.
In our evaluations of the ACTT-1 data, day 7 had the highest power. However, evidence of an
effect this early would likely not have been convincing for a definitive trial. A day 7 evaluation may be
more appropriate for phase 2 trials. An alternative to the time-to-event approach would have been to
specify multiple outcomes (e.g., ordinal scale at day 7, 14, 21 and 28), with multiplicity adjustments.
This was considered but concerns were raised about interpretation and the need to focus on an
important measure of clinical benefit.

15

Regardless of the primary endpoint chosen, collection of core outcome measures will ensure
comparability across studies and will be important for subsequent efforts to synthesize data from
different trials.31

Details of simulation
Ordinal trajectories for each subject were generated according to a linear random effects model with
time index log of the day since randomization Informally, subject i drew a random curve of ‘destiny’
and foreach day of follow-up, the integer part of the line at that day was given as ordinal score. Except
for the lagged effect scenario, the model is given by
Y id = B0 + B1 log(d) + B2 Z log(d)+ b0i + b1i *log(d) + W e id

(1)

with b0i distributed N(0,1.52) and b1i distributed I x N(-4,.32) + (1-I) N(7,s 2) with I distributed
Bernoulli(p=0.10) for placebo and Bernoulli(p=0.05)~Be(.05) for treatment, e id distributed N(0,.252), and
Z the indicator of the treatment group. Note that there is a treatment effect both on the speed of
recovery (as B2 <0) and mortality as I has a different Bernoulli probability for the two groups.
For the lagged effect scenario, the day 1 treatment effect begins at day 8:
Y id = B0 + B1 log(d)+ B2 Z I(d>7)*log(d-7) + b0i + b1i *Z*I (d>7) log(d-7) + W e id

With settings for the random variables as described for equation (1). Table S4 provides the parameter
values used for the different scenarios.

reference case is bolded. All scenarios use equation (1) except for the lagged effect which uses

Details of simulation enforcing proportional odds assumption at each time point
Random multinomial data were generated corresponding to baseline ordinal scores. Then a trajectory of
ordinal scores was applied as method 1 above, except that the trajectories were generated with the
same distribution for treatment and control arms. Treatment-arm proportions at observation days were
then re-scaled to satisfy a proportional odds assumption with according to a common odds ratio for
specific treatment effects each day (as specified in table S5). Additional simulation studies (not shown)
demonstrated that blinded (pooled) pilot studies are not very informative for guiding the determination
of the optimal time. Blinded (pooled) data provide information about the overall proportions in each
category, but simple rules such as selecting the time where there are a certain proportion of good
outcomes or when the distribution is the most variable do not seem to improve identification of the
optimal time for evaluation. Note the one peculiarity of how these models are set up.
