Widespread growth signatures in COVID-19 confirmed case counts are reported,

with sharp transitions between three distinct dynamical regimes (exponential, superlinear and sublinear). Through analytical and numerical analysis, a novel framework
is developed that exploits information in these signatures. An approach well known
to physics is applied, where one looks for common dynamical features, independently
from differences in other factors. These features and associated scaling laws are used
as a powerful tool to pinpoint regions where analytical derivations are effective, get
an insight into qualitative changes of the disease progression, and infer the key infection parameters. The developed framework for joint analytical and numerical
analysis of empirically observed COVID-19 growth patterns can lead to a fundamental understanding of infection progression under strong control measures, applicable
to outbursts of both COVID-19 and other infectious diseases.

I.

INTRODUCTION

COVID-19 pandemic introduced unprecedented worldwide social distancing measures[1] .
While interventions such as quarantine or vaccination have been extensively studied in quantitative epidemiology, effects of social distancing are not well understood[2]-[4] , and when
addressed, they have been studied only numerically. Unique opportunity to understand
these effects has been provided by COVID-19 tracing through confirmed case counts, active
cases and fatalities, in a variety of countries with different demographic and environmental
conditions[5, 6] . We here show that focusing analytical and numerical derivations on distinct
epidemics growth regimes, is a novel and effective approach in revealing infection progression

mechanisms that may be a valuable alternative to detailed numerical simulations.
The outline of the manuscript is as follows: Our COVID-19 dynamics model is introduced
in the Model subsection. In Numerical Framework/Results we will extract COVID-19 count
data and select those countries that systematically trace not only confirmed cases and fatalities, but also active cases, which allows tight constraint of numerical analysis. We will
observe three characteristic growth regimes in confirmed case counts, show that our model
is well constrained by these regimes for a wide range of countries, and provide an intuitive
explanation behind the emergence of such regimes. In Analytical Framework/Results sections, analysis of the characteristic (inflection and maximum) points of the infective curve
will allow to i) explain the nearly constant value of the scaling exponent in the superlinear
regime of confirmed counts; ii) understand the relation between the duration of this regime
and strength of social distancing; iii) pinpoint changes in the reproduction number from
outburst to extinguishing the infection, and iv) constrain the main parameter quantifying
the effect of social distancing by analysing scaling of the infection growth with time in the
sublinear regime. The obtained constraints provide a basis for successful analysis of countries
that did not continuously track the active cases. We will finally present the key infection
parameters inferred through combined analytical and numerical analysis.

II.

MODEL

We develop a mechanistic model (nonlinear and nonhomogeneous), which takes into account gradual introduction of social distancing (as relevant for most countriesâ€™ response),
in addition to other important infection progression mechanisms. We start from standard
compartments for epidemiological models, i.e., susceptible (S), exposed (E), infective (I)
and recovered (R)[2]-[4] . To account for social distancing and observable quantities, we introduce additional compartments: protected (P ) - where individuals effectively move from
susceptible category due to social distancing; total number of diagnosed (confirmed and
consequently quarantined) cases (D), active cases (A), and fatalities (F ). D, A and F correspond to directly observable (measured) quantities, but are indirect observables of I, as
only part of infective gets diagnosed, due to a large number of mild/asymptomatic cases[7] .
We implement the model deterministically, as COVID-19 count numbers are very high
wherever reasonable testing capacities are employed.

This makes model analytically

3
tractable, and allows robust parameter inference through combination of analytically derived
expressions and tightly constrained numerical analysis, as we show below. Our analysis is
applied separately to each country, as the effect of social distancing, initial number of infected and exposed, diagnosis/detection efficiency and transmission rates may be different.
However, within a given country, we do not take into account different heterogeneities âˆ’
demographic, spatial, population activity, or seasonality effects[2, 8, 9] . These can readily be
included in our model, but would lead to model structure which is not analytically tractable,
so these extensions are left for future work.
Given this, the model equations are:
dS/dt = âˆ’Î²IS/N âˆ’ dP/dt; dP/dt = Î±/(1 + (t0 /t)n )S

(1)

dE/dt = Î²IS/N âˆ’ ÏƒE; dI/dt = ÏƒE âˆ’ Î³I âˆ’ Î´I; dR/dt = Î³I

(2)

dD/dt = Î´I; dA/dt = Î´I âˆ’ hD âˆ’ mD; dF/dt = mD

(3)

where N is the total population number; Î² - the transmission rate; Ïƒ - inverse of the
latency period; Î³ - inverse of the infectious period; Î´ - inverse of the detection/diagnosis
period;  - the fraction of the infected that get diagnosed; h - the recovery rate; m - the
mortality rate. Social distancing is included through Eq. (1) (second equation), which
represents the rate at which the population moves (on average) from susceptible to protected
category. The term

Î±
1+(t0 /t)n

corresponds to a sigmoidal dependence (similar to Fermi-Dirac

function, in quantitative biology known as the Hill function[10] ). Time t0 determines the
half-saturation, so that well before t0 the social distancing is negligible, while well after
t0 the rate of transition to the protected category approaches Î±. Parameter n (the Hill
constant) determines how rapidly the social distancing is introduced, i.e., large n leads to
rapid transition from OFF to ON state, and vice versa[10] . Eq. (3) considers that only a
fraction of the infected is diagnosed, so that Î´I takes into account the diagnosis and the
subsequent quarantine process.

III.

ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK

To make the problem analytically tractable, we approximate the 2nd term in Eq. (1)
by unit step function, so that after t0 the term becomes âˆ’Î±S and dominates over the 1st
term, i.e., S(t) âˆ¼ eâˆ’Î±t . We checked that this approximation agrees well with full-fledged

4
numerical simulations (Figure 1D and Supplement). In all comparisons with analytical
results, numerical analysis is done with the full model, allowing an independent check of
both analytical derivations and employed approximations. Under this assumption, Eqs.
(1-2) reduce to:
d2 I(t)
dI(t)
= Ïƒ Î²[Î¸(t0 âˆ’ t) + eâˆ’(tâˆ’t0 )Î± Î¸(t âˆ’ t0 )] âˆ’ (Î³ + Î´) I(t).

We next introduce two time regions: I) t â‰¤ t0 and II) t > t0 and solve Eq. (4) separately
within these regions, where corresponding solutions are denoted as II (t) and III (t). As in
the above expressions Î³ + Î´ always appear together, we further denote Î³ + Î´ â†’ Î³.
For II (t), we take I(t = 0) â‰¡ I0 , and restrict to dominant (positive) Jacobian eigenvalue,
leading to the exponential regime:

Eqs. (14, 15) have to be solved numerically, but, as Î³ and Ïƒ are constants, we interestingly
obtain that solutions will depend only on Î±. Since, for the analysis of superlinear and
sublinear regimes, only the left inflection point and the maximum are important, we will
further omit the second solution of Eq. (15) (Eq. (14) has one solution), and denote yi =

NUMERICAL FRAMEWORK

We first numerically analyze outburst dynamics in the countries that continuously
updated[15] three observable categories (D, A and F ). For a large majority of countries
active cases were either not tracked or continuously updated, so the analysis is done for
10 countries (Andorra, Austria, Czechia, Croatia, Cuba, Germany, Israel, New Zealand,
Switzerland and Turkey).
In the exponential regime, the analytical closed-form solution is given by Eq. (5). From
this, and the initial slope of ln (D) curve (once the number of counts are out of the stochastic

8
regime), Î² can be directly determined, while the corresponding eigenvector sets the ratio of
I0 to E0 . The intercept of the initial exponential growth of D at t = 0 sets the product of
I0 and Î´. h and m can also be readily constrained, as from Eqs. (3), they depend only on
integrals of the corresponding counts; here note that d(D âˆ’ A âˆ’ F )/dt = hD. Also[14],[16],[17] ,
Ïƒ = 1/3 dayâˆ’1 and Î³ = 1/4 dayâˆ’1 , characterize fundamental infectious process, which we
assume not to change between different countries.
Only parameters related with the intervention measures (Î±, t0 , n, Î´) are left to be inferred
numerically, leading to tightly constrained numerical results. For this, we individually performed joint fit to all three observable quantities (A, D, F ) for each country. The errors
are estimated through Monte-Carlo[18, 19] simulations, assuming that count numbers follow
Poisson distribution.

V.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Representative numerical results are shown in Figure 1 for Germany, while other countries
are shown in the Supplement. In Figure 1A-C (and Supplement) we see a good agreement of
our numerical analysis with all three classes of the case counts. In Figure 1D, we see sharp
transitions between three growth patterns indicated in the figure: i) exponential growth,
observed as a straight line in log-linear plot in Figure 1E; ii) superlinear growth, a straight
line in log-log plot in Figure 1F; iii) sublinear growth, a straight line in linear-log plot in
Figure 1G.
Transition between the growth patterns can be qualitatively understood from Eq. (3),
and I(t) curve in Figure 1D. The exponential growth has to break after the inflection point
of I(t), i.e., once the maximum of its first derivative (I 0 (t) in Figure 1D) is reached. In the
superlinear regime, confirmed counts case (D(t)) curve is convex (D00 (t) > 0), so this regime
breaks once I 0 (t) (dashed blue curve) becomes negative. Equivalently, D(t) curve becomes
concave (enters sublinear regime) once the maximum of the I(t) is reached. In addition to
this numerical/intuitive understanding, we also showed that we can analytically reproduce
the emergence of these growth regimes (Eqs. (6), (14), (15)). Can we also analytically
reproduce the parameters that characterize these regimes?
The exponential regime is straightforward to explain, as described in the previous section. The superlinear regime is in between the left inflection point and the maximum of

9
I(t), so that infective numbers grow, but with a decreasing rate. While the derivations
are straightforward in the exponential regime, they are highly non-trivial in the subsequent
subexponential (superlinear and sublinear) growth. As the superlinear regime spans the
region between the left inflection point (ti , I 00 (ti ) = 0) and the maximum (tm , I 0 (tm ) = 0), its
duration is âˆ†t = tm âˆ’ ti given by Eq. (17), with âˆ¼ 1/Î± dependence, so that weak measures
lead to protracted superlinear growth (see Figure 2A). This tendency is also confirmed by
independent numerical analysis in Figure 2A, where for each individual country we numerically infer Î± and extract the length of the superlinear regime. Therefore, the duration of
the superlinear regime indicates the effectiveness of introduced social distancing.
The scaling exponent Ï… of the superlinear regime is given by Eq. (19), and shown in
Figure 2B, where we predict that all countries are roughly in the same range of 1.2 < Ï… < 1.5
(surprisingly, weakly dependent on Î±), despite significant differences in the applied measures,
demographic and environmental factors. This result is (independently from our model)
confirmed from case count numbers (the slope in Figure 1F, and equivalently for other
countries, see Figure 2B).
How the effective reproduction number Re changes during this regime, i.e., between the
left inflection point and the maximum of I(t)? Re quantifies the average number of secondary
cases per infectious case, so that Re > 1 signifies disease outburst, while for Re < 1 the disease starts to be eliminated from the population[14] . The Eq. (16) provides expressions for
Re,i (at the inflection point) and Re,m (at the maximum). Interestingly, from Figure 2C, we
observe that Re,i and Re,m do not depend on R0,free and are, respectively, significantly larger
and smaller than 1, which shows that transition from infection outburst to extinguishing
happens during superlinear growth. Consequently, the steepness of Re change over superlinear regime significantly increases (larger change over smaller time interval, see Figure 2C)
with the measure strength.
Finally, in the sublinear regime, in a wide vicinity of I(t) maximum (which marks the
beginning of the sublinear growth) leading non-linear term of D(t) is cubic (âˆ¼ t3 , with
negative prefactor). This is consistent with the expansion of I(t) around tm , which has
leading negative quadratic (t2 ) dependence (see Eqs. (3) and (20)). The ratio between
the prefactors in D(t) expansion is given by Eq. (21), from which we see that Î± can be
directly constrained, as shown in Figure 2D. For the 10 countries with consistent tracking of
D, A and F , we independently numerically determined Î± and compared it with analytical

inversely proportional to Î±. exp â†’ sub indicates the region of Î±, where we predict a direct

results coming from Eq. (21), obtaining an excellent agreement between our derivations and
numerical results. The obtained Î± values should be understood as an effective epidemic
containment measure - i.e., estimating the true result of the introduced measures, which can
be used to evaluate the practical effectiveness of the official policies.
To demonstrate how constraining Î± can aid numerical analysis in the cases when A is
not continuously tracked, we next analyze five additional countries (France, Italy, Spain,
United Kingdom and Serbia), so that altogether our study covers majority of COVID-19
hotspots, which (at the time of this analysis) are close to saturation in confirmed counts.

11
Furthermore, in the specific cases of UK and Italy, where we analytically obtained both very
low and very constrained Î± (0.01 < Î± < 0.04), we chose five times larger parameter span
in Î± in the numerical analysis, to confirm that these low values are indeed preferred by the
exhaustive numerical search. For example, the finally obtained Î± for Italy (0.033 Â± 0.005)
and UK (0.025 Â± 0.005), together with previously obtained agreements shown in Figures 2AC, strongly confirm that the observed growth patterns provide invaluable information for
successful analysis of the infection progression data.
To further illustrate this, the synergy of analytical derivations and numerical analysis
presented above enables us to, directly from the publicly available data, infer key infection
parameters necessary to assess epidemics risks (provided in the Supplement (Table S1)). We
estimate these parameters by the same model/analysis, for a number of diverse countries,
allowing their direct comparison. In Figure 3, we show together Case Fatality Rate (CFR),
Infected Fatality Rate (IFR) and infection Attack Rate (AR)[14, 21] . CFR is the number of
fatalities per confirmed cases. CFR can, in principle, be inferred directly from the data, but
since different countries are in different phases of infection, we project forward the number
of confirmed cases until a saturation is reached for each country, from which we calculate
CFR. IFR (crucial parameter for assessing the risks for infection progression under different
scenarios) is the number of fatalities per total number of infected cases, which is a genuine
model estimate, due to the unknown total number of infected cases. AR (necessary for
understanding the virus recurrence risk) is also determined from our model and provides an
estimate of the fraction of the total population that got infected and possibly resistant.
From Figure 3, we see that CFR takes very different values for different countries, from
below 2% (New Zealand) to above 20% (France). On the other hand, IFR is consistent
with a constant value (the dashed red line in the figure) of âˆ¼ 0.3 âˆ’ 0.4%. In distinction to
IFR, AR also takes diverse values for different countries, ranging from âˆ¼ 1% to as high as
âˆ¼ 15% (though with large errorbars). Although diverse, these AR values are well bellow
the classical herd immunity threshold of 60 âˆ’ 70%[2, 22] , raising a major risk of infection
recurrence with lifting social distancing measures. This conclusion is also consistent with
independent experimental measurements, through serology tests, where low AR values are
consistently obtained[23] ; e.g. preliminary results of a large scale study in Serbia obtained
AR of 6% well consistent with our reported value (5 Â± 4%). The fact that estimated AR
and CFR take diverse values, while IFR is nearly constant, implies that the obtained IFR

CONCLUSION

We here developed a novel quantitative framework through which we showed that: i) The
emergence of three distinct growth regimes in COVID-19 case counts can be reproduced both
analytically and numerically. ii) Typically, a brief superlinear regime is characterized by a
sharp transition from outburst to extinguishing the infection, where effective reproduction
number changes from much larger to much smaller than one; more effective measures lead
to shorter superlinear growth, and to a steeper change of the effective reproduction number.
iii) Scaling exponent of the superlinear regime is surprisingly uniform for countries with
diverse environmental and demographic factors and epidemics containment policies; this
highly non-trivial empirical result is well reproduced by our model. iv) Scaling prefactors
in the sublinear regime contain crucial information for analytically constraining infection
progression parameters, so that they can be straightforwardly extracted through numerical
analysis. Interestingly, we found that the number of COVID-19 fatalities per total number

13
of infected is highly uniform across diverse analyzed countries, in distinction to other (highly
variable) infection parameters, and about twice higher than commonly quoted for influenza
(3-4% compared to 1-2%), which may be valuable for direct assessment of the epidemics
risks.
While state-of-the-art approach in epidemiological modeling uses computationally highly
demanding numerical simulations, the results above demonstrate a shift of paradigm towards simpler, but analytically tractable models, that can both explain common dynamical
features of the system and be used for straightforward and highly constrained parameter
inference. This shift is based on a novel framework that relates universal growth patterns
with characteristic points of the infective curve, followed by analytical derivations in the
vicinity of these points, in an approach akin to those in a number of physics problems. As
our approach does not depend on any COVID-19 specifics, the developed framework can
also be readily applied to potential outbursts of future infections.
