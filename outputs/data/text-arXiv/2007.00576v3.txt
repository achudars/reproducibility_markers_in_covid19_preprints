COVID-19 Literature Knowledge Graph Construction and Drug
Repurposing Report Generation

Introduction

Practical progress at combating COVID-19 highly
depends on effective search, discovery, assessment
and extension of scientific research results. However, clinicians and scientists are facing two unique
barriers on digesting these research papers.
The first challenge is quantity. Such a bottleneck in knowledge access is exacerbated during a
pandemic when increased investment in relevant
research leads to even faster growth of literature
than usual. For example, as of April 28, 2020,
at PubMed3 there were 19,443 papers related to
coronavirus; as of June 13, 2020, there are 140K+
related papers, nearly 2.7K new papers per day
(see Figure 1). This knowledge bottleneck causes
significant delays in the development of vaccines
and drugs for COVID-19. More intelligent knowledge discovery technologies need to be developed

To combat COVID-19, both clinicians and scientists need to digest the vast amount of relevant biomedical knowledge in literature to understand the disease mechanism and the related biological functions. We have developed
a novel and comprehensive knowledge discovery framework, COVID-KG to extract finegrained multimedia knowledge elements (entities, relations and events) from scientific literature. We then exploit the constructed multimedia knowledge graphs (KGs) for question answering and report generation, using drug repurposing as a case study. Our framework also
provides detailed contextual sentences, subfigures and knowledge subgraphs as evidence.
All of the data, KGs, reports1 , resources and
shared services are publicly available2 .

Abstract

Figure 1: The Growing Number of COVID-19 Papers
at PubMed

to enable researchers to more quickly and accurately access and digest relevant knowledge from
literature.
The second challenge is quality due to the
rapid rise of extensive publications of preprint
manuscripts without pre-publication peer review.
Many research results about coronavirus from different research labs and sources are redundant,
complementary, or even conflicting with each other,
while some false information has been promoted
in both formal publication venues as well as social
media platforms such as Twitter. As a result, some
of the policy responses to the virus, and public perception of it, have been based on misleading, and
at times erroneous, claims. The isolation of these
knowledge resources makes it hard, if not impossible, for researchers to connect dots that exist in
separate resources to obtain insights.
Let us consider drug repurposing as a case
study. Besides the long process of clinical trial
and biomedical experiments, another major cause
for the long process is the complexity of the problem involved and the difficulty in drug discovery
in general. The current clinical trials for drug re-

Figure 2: COVID-KG Overview: From Data to Semantics to Knowledge

purposing mainly rely on symptoms by considering
drugs that can treat diseases with similar symptoms.
However, there are too many drug candidates and
too much misinformation published from multiple
sources. The clinicians and scientists thus need
urgent help to obtain a reliable ranked list of drugs
with detailed evidence, and also gain new insights
into the underlying molecular cellular mechanisms
on Covid-19, and which pre-existing conditions
may affect the mortality and severity of this disease.

Figure 3: Constructed KG Connecting Losartan (candidate drug in COVID-19) and cathepsin L pseudogene 2
(gene related to coronavirus).

To tackle these two challenges we propose a
new framework, COVID-KG, to accelerate scientific discovery and build a bridge between clinicians and biology scientists, as illustrated in Figure 2. COVID-KG starts by reading existing papers to build multimedia knowledge graphs (KGs),
in which nodes are entities/concepts and edges represent relations and events involving these entities,
extracted from both text and images. Given the
KGs enriched with path ranking and evidence mining, COVID-KG answers natural language questions effectively. Using drug repurposing as a case
study, for 11 typical questions that human experts
aim to explore, we integrate our techniques to generate a comprehensive report for each candidate
drug. Preliminary assessment by expert clinicians
and medical school students show our generated
reports are both informative and sound.

Construction
Coarse-grained Text Knowledge
Extraction

Our coarse-grained Information Extraction (IE)
system consists of three components: (1) coarsegrained entity extraction (Wang et al., 2019a) and
entity linking (Zheng et al., 2015) for four entity
types: Gene nodes, Disease nodes, Chemical nodes,
and Organism. We follow the entity ontology defined in the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database
(CTD) (Davis et al., 2016), and obtain a Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) Unique ID for each
mention. (2) Based on the MeSH Unique IDs, we
further link all entities to the CTD and extract 133

subtypes of relations such as GeneChemicalInteraction Relationships, ChemicalDisease Associations,
GeneDisease Associations, ChemicalGO Enrichment Associations and ChemicalPathway Enrichment Associations. (3) Event extraction (Li et al.,
2019): we extract 13 Event types and the roles of
entities involved in these events, including Gene
expression, Transcription, Localization, Protein
catabolism, Binding, Protein modification, Phosphorylation, Ubiquitination, Acetylation, Deacetylation, Regulation, Positive regulation, and Negative regulation. Figure 3 shows an example of the
constructed knowledge graph.

SARS-CoV-2 CORONAVIRUS has been sequenced [3]. A phylogenetic EVOLUTION analysis
[3, 4] found a bat WILDLIFE origin for the SARS-CoV-2 CORONAVIRUS. There is a diversity of
possible intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 CORONAVIRUS, including pangolins WILDLIFE,
but not mice EUKARYOTE and rats EUKARYOTE [5]. There are many similarities of SARSCoV-2 CORONAVIRUS with the original SARS-CoV CORONAVIRUS. Using computer
modeling, Xu et al. [6] found that the spike proteins GENE_OR_GENOME of SARS-CoV-2
CORONAVIRUS and SARS-CoV CORONAVIRUS have almost identical 3-D structures in the
receptor binding domain that maintains Van der Waals forces PHYSICAL_SCIENCE. SARSCoV spike proteins GENE_OR_GENOME has a strong binding affinity to human ACE2

[7]. SARS-CoV-2 CORONAVIRUS and SARS-CoV spike proteins GENE_OR_GENOME share
identity in amino acid sequences and ……

Figure 4: Example of Fine-grained Entity Extraction

However, questions from experts often involve
fine-grained knowledge elements, such as Which
animo acids in glycoprotein are most related to
Glycan (CHEMICAL)?. In order to answer these
questions, we apply our fine-grained entity extraction system CORD-NER (Wang et al., 2020c) to
extract 75 types of entities to enrich the KG, including many COVID-19 specific new entity types (e.g.,
coronaviruses, viral proteins, evolution, materials,
substrates and immune responses). CORD-NER
relies on distantly- and weakly-supervised methods (Wang et al., 2019b; Shang et al., 2018), with
no need of expensive human annotation. Its entity
annotation quality surpasses SciSpacy (over 10%
higher on the F1 score based on a sample set of documents), a fully supervised BioNER tool. Figure 4
shows some examples of the annotation results on
a CORD-19 paper (Zhang et al., 2020).
2.3

Image Processing and Cross-media
Entity Grounding

Figures in biomedical papers contain rich information uniquely manifested in the visual modality,
such as molecular structures, microscopic images,
dosage response curves, relational diagrams, and
other visual types. We have developed a visual IE

Figure 5: System Pipeline for Automatic Figure Extraction and Subfigure Segmentation

subsystem to extract the visual information from
figure images to enrich the knowledge graph. We
start by designing a pipeline and automatic tools
shown in Figure 5 to extract figures from papers
in the CORD-19 dataset and segment figures into
close to half a million subfigures. Then, we perform cross-modal entity grounding to ground entities mentioned in captions or referring text to visual
objects in the subfigures. Since most figures are
embedded as part of PDF files, we employ Deepfigures (Siegel et al., 2018) to automatically detect
and extract figures from each PDF document. Each
figure is associated with text in its caption or referring context (main body text referring to the figure).
In this way, a figure can be coarsely attached to an
KG entity if the entity is mentioned in the associated text.
To further delineate semantic and visual information contained in each subfigure, we have developed a pipeline to segment individual subfigures and then align each subfigure with its corresponding sub-caption. We employ Figure-separator
(Tsutsui and Crandall, 2017) to detect and separate
all non-overlapping image regions. Meanwhile,
subfigures in a figure are typically marked with alphabetical letters (e.g., A, B, C, etc). We use deep
neural networks (Zhou et al., 2017) to detect text in
the figures and use OCR tools (Smith, 2007) to automatically recognize text information within each
figure. To distinguish subfigure marker text from
text labels in figures to annotate figure content, we
use location proximity between text labels and subfigures to locate subfigure text markers. Location
information of such text markers can also be used
to merge multiple image regions into a single subfigure. At the end, each subfigure is segmented, and
associated with its corresponding subcaption and
referring context. The segmented subfigures and
associated text labels provide rich information that
can expand the KG constructed from text captions.

Figure 6: Expanding KG through Subfigure Segmentation and Cross-modal Entity Grounding

ifications is added. Correspondingly, all the other
visualizations will be changed.
One unique feature of the SemViz semantic visualization is the creation of dense tag clouds and
dense heatmaps, through a process of parameter
reduction over relations, allowing for the visualization of relation sets as tag clouds and multiple chained relations as heatmaps. Figure 7 illustrates such a dense heatmap, where a functionally
typed protein is implicated in a disease relation
(e.g., “those proteins that are down-regulators of
INF which are implicated in obesity”).

For example, as shown in Figure 6, we apply a classifier to detect subfigure images containing molecular structures. Then by linking specific drug names
extracted from within-figure text to the drug entity
in the coarse KG constructed from the caption text,
a cross-modal expanded KG can be constructed
that links specific molecular structure images to
corresponding drug entities in the KG.
2.4

Knowledge Graph Semantic
Visualization

In order to enhance the exploration and discovery
of the information mined from the COVID-19 literature through the algorithms discussed in previous
sections, we have been developing techniques to
create semantic visualizations over large complex
networks of biomedical relations. Semantic visualization allows for visualization of user-defined
subsets of these relations interactively through semantically typed tag clouds and heat maps. This
allows researchers to get a global view of selected
relation subtypes drawn from hundreds or thousands of papers at a single glance. This in turn
allows for the ready identification of novel relationships that would typically be missed by directed
keyword searches or simple unigram word cloud
or heatmap displays.4
We first build a data index from the knowledge
elements in the constructed KGs, and then create a
Kibana dashboard out of the generated data indices.
Each Kibana dashboard has a collection of visualizations that are designed to interact with each
other. Dashboards are implemented as web applications. The navigation of a dashboard is mainly
through clicking and searching. By clicking the

“Enzyme proteins participating Modification relations”, a constraint on the type of proteins in mod4

Knowledge-driven Question
Answering

In contrast to most current question answering
(QA) methods which target single documents, we
have developed a QA component based on a combination of knowledge graph matching and distributional semantic matching. We build knowledge
graph indexing and searching functions to facilitate
users to pose queries to search effectively and efficiently. We also support semantic matching from
the constructed KGs and related texts by accepting
multi-hop queries.
A common category of queries is about the connections between two entities. Given two entities
as query, we generate a subgraph covering salient
paths between them to show how they are connected through other entities. Figure 3 is an example subgraph summarizing the connections between
Losartan and cathepsin L pseudogene 2. The paths
are generated by traversing the constructed KG,
and are ranked by the frequency of paths in the KG.
Each edge is assigned a salience score by aggregating the scores of paths passing through it. In addition to knowledge elements, we also present related

sentences as evidence. We use BioBert (Lee et al.,
2020), a pre-trained language model to represent
each sentence along with its left and right neighboring sentences as local contexts. Using the same
architecture computed on all respective sentences
and the user query, we aggregate the sequence embedding layer, the last hidden layer in the BERT
architecture with average pooling (Reimers and
Gurevych, 2019). We use the similarity between
the embedding representations of each sentence
and query to extract the most relevant sentences as
evidence.
Queries also often include entity types instead
of entity instances, which requires us to extract
evidence sentences based on type or pattern matching. We have developed E VIDENCE M INER (Wang
et al., 2020a,b), a web-based system that allows
a users query as a natural language statement or
an inquired relationship at the meta-symbol level
(e.g., CHEMICAL, PROTEIN) and automatically
retrieves textual evidence from a background corpora of COVID-19.

Our KG results for many other drugs are visualized at our website5 . We download new COVID19 papers on a daily basis from three Application
Programming Interfaces (APIs): NCBI PMC API,
NCBI Pubtator API and CORD-19 archive. We
provide incremental updates including new papers,
removed papers and updated papers, and their metadata information at our website6 .

A case study on Drug Repurposing
Report Generation
Task and Data

A human written report about drug repurposing
usually answers the following typical questions.
1. Current indication: what is the drug class?
What is it currently approved to treat?
2. Molecular structure (symbols desired, but a
pointer to a reference is also useful)
3. Mechanism of action i.e., inhibits viral entry,
replication, etc. (w/ a pointer to data)
4. Was the drug identified by manual or computation screen?
5. Who is studying the drug? (Source/lab name)
6. In vitro Data available (cell line used, assays
run, viral strain used, cytopathic effects, toxicity, LD50, dosage response curve, etc.)
7. Animal Data Available (what animal model,
LD50, dosage response curve, etc.)
8. Clinical trials on going (what phase, facility,
target population, dosing, intervention etc.)
9. Funding source
10. Has the drug shown evidence of systemic toxicity?
11. List of relevant sources to pull data from.
As case studies, DARPA biologists suggest three
drugs, Benazepril, Losartan, and Amodiaquine, and
COVID-19 related chemicals/genes as shown in
Figure 8:

Figure 8: COVID-19 related chemicals/genes.

Results

As of June 14, 2020 we have collected 140K papers.
We select 25,534 peer-reviewed papers and construct the KG that includes 7,230 Diseases, 9,123
Chemicals and 50,864 genes, 1,725,518 chemicalgene links, 5,556,670 chemical-disease links, and
7,7844,574 gene-disease links. The KG has received more than 1,000+ downloads. Our final
generated reports7 are shared publicly. For each
question, our framework provides answers along
with detailed evidences, knowledge subgraphs and
image segmentation and analysis results. Table 1
shows some example answers.
Several clinicians and medical school students
in our team have manually reviewed the drug repurposing reports for three drugs, and also the
KGs connecting 41 drugs and COVID-19 related
chemicals/genes. Preliminary results show that
most of our output are informative, valid and
sound. For instance, after the coronavirus enters
the cell in the lungs, it can cause a severe disease called Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.
This condition causes the release of inflammatory

in Figure 3 and Figure 9. Some results are a little
surprising to scientists and they think it’s worth
further investigation. For example, in Figure 3 we
can see that Lusartan is connected to tumor protein
p53 which is related to lung cancer.

including COVIDASK8 and AUEB9 , and search engines (Kricka et al., 2020; Esteva et al., 2020; Hope

of our recently developed multimedia knowledge
extraction for news domain (Li et al., 2020a,b).
Similar to news domain, the knowledge elements
extracted from text and images in literature are
complimentary. Our framework advances state-ofthe-art by extending the knowledge elements to
more fine-grained types, incorporating image analysis and cross-media knowledge grounding, and
knowledge graph matching into QA.

Conclusions and Future Work

We have developed a novel framework, COVIDKG, that automatically transforms a massive scientific literature corpus into organized, structured,
and actionable knowledge graphs, and uses it to answer questions in drug repurposing reporting. With
COVID-KG, researchers and clinicians are able
to obtain trustworthy and non-trivial answers from
scientific literature, and thus focus on more important hypothesis testing, and prioritize the analysis
efforts for candidate exploration directions. In our
ongoing work we have created a new ontology that
includes 77 entity subtypes and 58 event subtypes,
and we are building a neural IE system following
this new ontology. In the future we plan to extend

cross-media knowledge grounding and inference.
