Abstract
We developed a mathematical model to describe the transmission of new coronavirus in
the SaÃÉo Paulo State, Brazil. The model divided a community in subpopulations comprised
by young and elder persons, in order to take into account higher risk of fatality among
elder persons with severe CoViD-19. From data collected in the SaÃÉo Paulo State, we
estimated the transmission and additional mortality rates, from which we calculated the
basic reproduction number R0 . From estimated parameters, estimation of the deaths due
to CiViD-19 was three times lower than those found in literature. Considering isolation
as a control mechanism, we varied isolation rates of young and elder persons in order
to assess their epidemiological impacts. The epidemiological scenarios focused mainly on
evaluating the number of severe CoViD-19 cases and deaths due to this disease when
isolation is introduced in a population.

Introduction

Coronavirus disease 2019 (CoViD-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a strain of the SARS-CoV-1 (pandemic in 2002/2003), originated
in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and spread out worldwide. World Health Organization
(WHO) declared CoViD-19 pandemic on 11 March, based on its own definition: ‚ÄúA pandemic

is the worldwide spread of a new disease. An influenza pandemic occurs when a new influenza
virus emerges and spreads around the world, and most people do not have immunity‚Äù.
Coronavirus (RNA virus) can be transmitted by droplets that escape lungs through coughing or sneezing and infects humans (direct transmission), or they are deposited in surfaces
and infects humans when in contact with this contaminated surface (indirect transmission).
This virus enters in susceptible persons through nose, mouth or eyes, and infects cells in the
respiratory tract, being capable of releasing millions of new virus. In serious cases, immune
cells overreact and attack lung cell causing acute respiratory disease syndrome and possibly
death. In general, the fatality rate in elder patients (60 years or more) is much higher than the
average, and under 40 years seems to be around 0.2%. Currently, there is not vaccine, neither
efficient treatment, even many drugs (cloroquine, for instance) are under clinical trial. Like
all RNA-based viruses, coronavirus tends to mutate faster than DNA-viruses, but lower than
influenza viruses.
Many mathematical and computational models are being used to describe current new
coronavirus pandemics. In mathematical model, there is a fundamental threshold (see [1])
called the basic reproduction number, which is defined as the secondary cases produced by one
case introduced in a completely susceptible population, and is denoted by R0 . When a control
mechanisms is introduced, this number is reduced, and is called as the reduced reproduction
number Rr . Ferguson et al. [4] proposed a model in order to investigate the effects of isolation of
susceptible persons. They analyzed two scenarios called by them as mitigation and suppression.
Roughly, mitigation reduces the basic reproduction number R0 , but not lower than one (1 <
Rr < R0 ), while suppression reduces the basic reproduction number lower than one (Rr <
1). They predicted the numbers of severe cases and deaths due to CoViD-19 without control
measure, and compared them with those numbers when isolations (mitigation and suppression)
are introduced as control measures. Li et al. discussed the role of undocumented infections [5].
In this paper we formulate a mathematical model based on ordinary differential equations
aiming firstly to understand the dynamics of CoViD-19 transmission, and, using the data
from SaÃÉo Paulo State, Brazil, estimate model parameters, and, then, study potential scenarios
introducing isolation as a control mechanism.
The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we introduce a model, which is numerically
studied in Section 3. Discussions are presented in Section 4, and conclusions, in Section 5.

Material and methods

In a community where SARS-CoV-2 (new coronavirus) is circulating, the risk of infection is
greater in elder than young persons, as well as under increased probability of being symptomatic
and higher CoViD-19 induced mortality. Hence, a community is divided in two groups, comprised by young (under 60 years old, denoted by subscript y), and elder (above 60 years old,
denoted by subscript o) persons. The vital dynamics of this community is given by per-capita
rates of birth (œÜ) and mortality (¬µ).
For each sub-population j (j = y, o), the persons are divided in seven classes: susceptible Sj ,
susceptible persons who are isolated Qj , exposed Ej , asymptomatic Aj , asymptomatic persons
who are caught by test and then isolated Q1j , symptomatic persons at initial phase of CoViD-19
2

(or pre-diseased) D1j , pre-diseased persons caught by test and then isolated, plus mild CoViD19 (or non-hospitalized) Q2j , and symptomatic persons with severe CoViD-19 (hospitalized)
D2j . However, all persons in young and elder classes enter to same immunized class I, after
experiencing infection.
With respect to new coronavirus transmission, the history of natural infection is the same
in young (j = y) and elder (j = o) classes. We assume that only persons in asymptomatic (Aj )
and pre-diseased (D1j ) classes are transmitting the virus, and other infected classes (Q1j , Q2j
and D2j ) are under voluntary or forced isolation. Susceptible persons are infected according to
Œªj Sj /N and enter to classes Ej , where Œªj is the per-capita incidence rate (or force of infection)
defined by Œªj = Œª (Œ¥jy + œàŒ¥jo ), with Œª being
Œª = Œ≤1y Ay + Œ≤2y D1y + Œ≤1o Ao + Œ≤2o D1o ,

(1)

where Œ¥ij is Kronecker delta, with Œ¥ij = 1 if i = j, and 0, if i 6= j, and Sj /N is the probability
of virus encountering susceptible persons. After an average period of time 1/œÉj in classes Ej ,
where œÉj is the incubation rate, exposed persons enter to asymptomatic Aj (with probability
pj ) or pre-diseased D1j (with probability 1 ‚àí pj ) classes. After an average period of time 1/Œ≥j in
class Aj , where Œ≥j is the infection rate of asymptomatic persons, symptomatic persons acquire
immunity (recovered) and enter to immunized class I. Another route of exit from class Aj is
being caught by a test at a rate Œ∑j and enters to class Q1j , and, then, after a period of time 1/Œ≥j ,
enters to class I. With very low intensity, asymptomatic persons are in voluntary isolation,
which is described by voluntary isolation rate œáj . With respect to symptomatic persons, after an
average period of time 1/Œ≥1j in class D1j , where Œ≥1j is the infection rate of pre-diseased persons,
pre-diseased persons enter to non-hospitalized Q2j (with probability mj ) or hospitalized D2j
(with probability 1 ‚àí mj ) classes. Hospitalized persons acquire immunity after a period of time
1/Œ≥2j , where Œ≥2j is recovery rate of severe CoViD-19, and enter to immunized class I, or die
under disease induced (additional) mortality rate Œ±. After an average period of time 1/Œ≥j in
class Q2j , non-hospitalized persons acquire immunity and enter to immunized class I, or enter
to class D2j at a relapsing rate of pre-diseased persons Œæj .

Table 2 summarizes model parameters and values (values for elder classes are between
parentheses).
Isolation of persons deserves some words. In the modeling, the isolation is applied to
susceptible persons, which are known only at exact time of the introduction of new virus,
that is, S(0) = N0 . However, as time passes, susceptible persons are decreased and become
immunized persons, and, due to asymptomatic persons, susceptible and immunized persons
are indistinguishable (except caught by test and hospitalized persons). For this reason, if
isolation of persons is not done at the time of virus introduction, it is probable that virus
should be circulating among them, but at very lower transmission rate (virus circulates only
among household and neighborhood persons).
From the system of equations (2), (3) and (4) we can derive some epidemiological parameters: new cases, new CoViD-19 cases, severe CoViD-19 cases, number of deaths due to
CoViD-19, and isolated persons.
The number of persons infected with new coronavirus are given by Ey + Ay + Q1y + D1y +
Q2y + D2y for young persons, and Eo + Ao + Q1o + D1o + Q2o + D2o for elder persons. The
incidence rates are

The system of equations (2), (3) and (4) is non-autonomous. Nevertheless the fractions of

where s0y and s0o are substituted by Sy0 /N0 and So0 /N0 .
Given N and R0 , let us evaluate the number of susceptible persons in order to trigger
and maintain epidemics, but in a special case. Assume that all model parameters for young
7

and elder classes and all transmission rates are equal, then R0 = œÉŒ≤/ [(œÉ + œÜ) (Œ≥ + œÜ)] and
Re = R0 S/N , using approximated Re given by equation (A.11). Letting Re = 1, the critical
number of susceptible persons S th at equilibrium is

(11)

If S > S th , epidemics occurs and persists (Re > 1, non-trivial equilibrium point P ‚àó ), and the
fraction of susceptible individuals is s‚àó = 1/Re , where s‚àó = s‚àóy + s‚àóo ; but if S < S th , epidemics
occurs but fades out (Re < 1, trivial equilibrium point P 0 ), and the fractions of susceptible
individuals sy and so at equilibrium are given by equation (A.4), or (A.12) if there is not any
control.
Let us now evaluate the critical isolation rate of susceptible persons Œ∑2 assuming that all
model parameters for young and elder classes and all transmission rates are equal. In this
special case, Rr = R0 (Œ∑3 + œÜ) / (Œ∑2 + Œ∑3 + œÜ), where R0 = œÉŒ≤/ [(œÉ + œÜ) (Œ≥ + œÜ)], and letting
Rr = 1, we obtain
Œ∑2th ‚âà (Œ∑3 + œÜ) (R0 ‚àí 1) .
(12)
If Œ∑2 < Œ∑2th , epidemics occurs and persists (Re > 1, non-trivial equilibrium point P ‚àó ); but if
Œ∑2 > Œ∑2th , epidemics occurs but fades out (Re < 1, trivial equilibrium point P 0 ).
We apply above results to study the introduction and establishment of new coronavirus in
the SaÃÉo Paulo State, Brazil. From data collected in the SaÃÉo Paulo State from March 14, 2020
until April 5, 2020, we estimate transmission and additional mortality rates, and, then, study
potential scenarios introducing isolation as control mechanisms.

Results

Results obtained in foregoing section is applied to describe new coronavirus infection in the
SaÃÉo Paulo State, Brazil. The first confirmed case of CoViD-19, occurred in February 26, 2020,
was from a traveler returning from Italy in February 21, and being hospitalized in February 24.
The first death due to CoViD-19 was a 62 years old male with comorbidity who never travelled
to abroad, hence considered as autochthonous transmission. He manifested first symptoms
in March 10, was hospitalized in March 14, and died in March 16. In March 24, the SaÃÉo
Paulo State authorities ordered isolation of persons acting in non-essential activities, as well as
students of all level until April 6, further the isolation was extended to April 22.
Let us determine the initial conditions. In the SaÃÉo Paulo State, the number of inhabitants
is N (0) = N0 = 44.6 √ó 106 according to SEADE [6]. The value of parameter œï given in
Table 1 was calculated by equation (A.12), œï = bœÜ/ (1 ‚àí b), where b is the proportion of elder
persons. Using b = 0.153 in the SaÃÉo Paulo State [6], we obtained œï = 6.7 √ó 10‚àí6 days‚àí1 ,
hence, Ny (0) = N0y = 37.8 √ó 106 (sÃÑ0y = N0y /Ny (0) = 0.8475) and No (0) = N0o = 6.8 √ó 106
(sÃÑ0o = N0o /No (0) = 0.1525). The initial conditions for susceptible persons are let to be Sy (0) =
Ny (0) and So (0) = No (0). For other variables, from Table 2, py = 0.8 and my = 0.8, the ratio
asymptomatic:symptomatic is 4 : 1, and the ratio mild:severe (non-hospitalized:hospitalized)
CoViD-19 is 4 : 1. We use these ratios for elder persons, even po and mo are slightly different.
Hence, if we assume that there is 1 person in D2j (the first confirmed case), then there are 4
8

persons in Q2j . The sum (5) is the number of persons in class D1j , implying that there are
20 in class Aj , hence, the sum (25) is the number of persons in class Ej . Finally, we suppose
that no one is isolated or tested, and also immunized. (Probably the first confirmed COViD-19
person transmitted the virus (since February 21 when returned infected from Italy), as well as
other asymptomatic travelers returning from abroad.)
Therefore, the initial conditions supplied to the dynamic system (2), (3) and (4) are

Sj (0) = N0j , Qj (0) = Q1j (0) = 0, Ej (0) = 25,
Aj (0) = 20, D1j (0) = 5, Q2j (0) = 4 D2j (0) = 1, I(0) = 0,
where the initial simulation time t = 0 corresponds to calendar time February 26, 2020, when
the first case was confirmed. The system of equations (2), (3) and (4) is evaluated numerically
using 4th order Runge-Kutta method.
This section presents parameters estimation and epidemiological scenarios considering isolation as control measure. In estimation and epidemiological scenarios, we assume that all
transmission rates in young persons are equal, as well as in elder persons, that is, we assume
that
Œ≤y = Œ≤1y = Œ≤2y = Œ≤1o = Œ≤2o ,
and
Œ≤o = œàŒ≤y ,
hence the forces of infection are Œªy = (Ay + D1y + Ao + D1o ) Œ≤y and Œªo = œàŒªy .

Parameters estimation

Reliable estimation of both transmission and additional mortality rates are crucial aiming the
prediction of new cases (to adequate the number of beds in hospital, for instance) and deaths.
When the estimation is based on few number of data, that is, in the beginning of epidemics,
some cautions must be taken, because the rates maybe over or under estimated. The reason
is that in the very beginning phase of epidemics, the spreading out of infection and deaths
increase exponentially without bound.
Currently, there is not sufficient number of kits to detect infection by new coronavirus. For
this reason, tests to confirm infection by this virus is done only in hospitalized persons, and,
also, in persons who died manifesting symptoms of CoViD-19. Hence, we have only data of
hospitalized persons (D2y and D2o ) and those who died (Œ†y and Œ†o ). Taking into account
hospitalized persons with CoViD-19, we estimate the transmission rates, and from persons
died due to CoViD-19, we estimate the additional mortality rates. These rates are estimated
applying the least square method (see [14]).
The introduction of quarantine is t = 27, corresponding to calendar time March 24, but
the effects are expected to appear later. Hence, we will estimate taking into account confirmed
cases and deaths from February 26 (t = 0) to April 5 (t = 39),1 hence n = 40 observations.
Notice that the sum of incubation and recovery periods (see Table 2) is around 16 days, hence
it is expected that at around simulation time t = 43 (April 10) the effects of isolation appear.
To estimate the transmission rates Œ≤y and Œ≤o , we let Œ±y = Œ±o = 0 and the system of equations

Instead of using equations (13) and (14), the least square estimation method, we vary
transmission or additional mortality rates and choose better fittings by evaluating the sum of
squared distances between curve and data.
3.1.1

Estimation of transmission and additional mortality rates

Firstly, letting additional mortality rates equal to zero (Œ±y = Œ±o = 0), we estimate a unique
Œ≤ = Œ≤y = Œ≤o , with œà = 1, against hospitalized CoViD-19 cases (D2 ) data from the SaÃÉo Paulo
State. The estimated value is Œ≤ = 0.8 days‚àí1 , resulting, for the basic reproduction number,
R0 = 6.99 (partials R0y = 5.83 and R0o = 1.16). Around this value, we vary Œ≤y and Œ≤o and
choose better fitted values comparing curves of D2 = D2y + D2o with observed data. The
estimated values are Œ≤y = 0.77 and Œ≤o = œàŒ≤y = 0.9009 (days‚àí1 ), where Œ® = 1.17, resulting in
the basic reproduction number R0 = 6.915 (partials R0y = 5.606 and R0o = 1.309). Figure 2
shows the estimated curve of D2 and observed data. This estimated curve is quite the same as
the curve fitted using a unique Œ≤.
Fixing previously estimated transmission rates Œ≤y = 0.77 and Œ≤o = 0.9009 (both days‚àí1 ),
we estimate additional mortality rates Œ±y and Œ±o . We vary Œ±y and Œ±o and choose better fitted
values comparing curves of deaths due to CoViD-19 Œ† = Œ†y + Œ†o with observed data. By the
fact that lethality among young persons is much lower than elder persons, we let Œ±y = 0.1Œ±o
[9], and fit only one variable Œ±o . The estimated rates are Œ±y = 0.0036 and Œ±o = 0.036 (days‚àí1 ).
Figure 3 shows the estimated curve of Œ† = Œ†y + Œ†o and observed data. We call this as the first
estimation method
The first estimation method used only one information: the risk of death is higher among
elder than young persons (we used Œ±y = 0.1Œ±o ). However, the lethality among hospitalized
elder persons is 10% [2]. Combining both findings, we assume that the numbers of deaths for
young and elder persons are, respectively, 10% and 1% of accumulated cases when ‚Ñ¶y and ‚Ñ¶o
approach plateaus (see Figure 6 below). This is called as second estimation method, which
takes into account a second information besides the one used in the first estimation method. In

and Œ∑2o are varied aiming to obtain of epidemiological scenarios. In general, the epidemic period
of infection by viruses œÑ is around 2 years, and depending on the value of R0 , a second epidemics
occurs after elapsed many years [10]. For this reason, we analyze epidemiological scenarios of
CoViD-19 restricted during the first wave of epidemics letting œÑ = 140 days.
Remembering that human population is varying due to the additional mortality (fatality)
of severe CoViD-19, we have, at t = 0, N0y = 3.780 √ó 107 , N0o = 0.680 √ó 107 and N0 =
N0y + N0o = 4.460 √ó 107 , and at t = 140 days, Ny = 3.773 √ó 107 (0.185%), No = 0.662 √ó 107
(2, 647%) and N = 4.435 √ó 107 (0.56%) for the first estimation method, and Ny = 3.778 √ó 107
(0.052%), No = 0.674 √ó 107 (0.882%) and N = 4.452 √ó 107 (0.179%) for the second estimation
method. The percentage of deaths (100 (N0j ‚àí Nj ) /N0j ) is given between parentheses. The
first estimation method for Œ±y and Œ±o yielded higher number of deaths than the second method.
3.1.2

Epidemiological scenario without any control mechanisms

All effects of isolation will be compared with new coronavirus transmission without any control.
Initially, estimated curves will be extended until œÑ = 140 days, when disease attains low values.
Figure 5 shows the estimated curves of the number of hospitalized (severe) CoViD-19 (D2y ,
D2o and D2 = D2y + D2o ). We observe that the peaks of severe CoViD-19 are for elder, young
and all persons are, respectively, 2.061 √ó 105 , 5.532 √ó 105 and 7.582 √ó 105 , which occur at same
time t = 72 days.
Figure 6 shows the estimated curves of accumulated number of severe CoViD-19 (‚Ñ¶y , ‚Ñ¶o and
‚Ñ¶ = ‚Ñ¶y + ‚Ñ¶o ), from equation (7). At t = 140 days, ‚Ñ¶ is approaching to asymptote (or plateau),
which can be understood as the time when the first wave of epidemics ends. The curves ‚Ñ¶y , ‚Ñ¶o
and ‚Ñ¶ attain values at t = 140, respectively, 1.798 √ó 106 , 0.563 √ó 106 and 2.361 √ó 106 .

By comparing percentages between deaths due to CoViD-19 (Œ†) and accumulated severe
CoViD-19 cases (‚Ñ¶), the first method predicts at least 3-times that predicted by the second
method. Especially among elder persons, second method predicts 11.13%, three times lower
than 33.4% predicted by the first method. Hence, the second estimation is more credible than
the first one. Hence, we will adopt the second estimation method for additional mortality
rates, Œ±y = 0.0009 and Œ±o = 0.009 (days‚àí1 ) hereafter except explicitly cited. Remember that
additional mortality rates are considered constant in all time.
Figure 8 shows the curves of the number of susceptible persons (Sy , So and S = Sy + So ).
At t = 0, the numbers of Sy , So and S are, respectively, 3.77762 √ó 107 , 0.68238 √ó 107 and
4.46 √ó 107 , and diminish due to infection, to lower values at t = 140 days. Notice that, after
the first wave of epidemics, very few number of susceptible persons are left behind, which are
1.23880 √ó 105 (0.33%), 0.02643 √ó 105 (0.039%) and 1.26523 √ó 105 (0.28%), for young, elder and
total persons, respectively. Percentage between parentheses is the ratio S(140)/S(0).
Figure 9 shows the curves of the number of immune persons (Iy , Io and I = Iy +Io ). At t = 0,
the number of immune persons Iy , Io and I increase from zero to, respectively, 3.76156 √ó 107
(99.57%), 0.67234 √ó 107 (98.53%) and 4.43390 √ó 107 (99.41%) at t = 140 days. Percentage
between parentheses is the ratio I/S(0).
From Figures 8 and 9, the difference between percentages of I/S(0) and S(140)/S(0) is the
percentage of all persons who have had contact with new coronavirus. Hence, the second wave
of epidemics will be triggered after elapsed very long period time waiting the accumulation of

susceptible persons to surpass its critical number [10] [13]. Simulating the system of equations
(2), (3) and (4) for a very long time (figures not shown), the trajectories reach the equilibrium
values for susceptible persons (s‚àóy = Sy‚àó /N ‚àó = 0.14660, s‚àóo = So‚àó /N ‚àó = 0.00348 and s‚àó = s‚àóy +s‚àóy =

0.15008).
Let us estimate roughly the critical number of susceptible persons S th from equation (11).
For R0 = 6.915, S th = 6.450 √ó 106 . Hence, for the SaÃÉo Paulo State, isolating 38.15 million
(85.5%) or above persons is necessary to avoid persistence of epidemics. The number of young
persons is 3.5 million less than the threshold number of isolated persons to guarantee eradication
of CoViD-19. Another rough estimation is done to isolation rate of susceptible persons Œ∑2 ,
letting Œ∑3 = 0 in equation (12), resulting in Œ∑ th = 2.19 √ó 10‚àí4 years‚àí1 , for R0 = 6.915. Then,
for Œ∑ > Œ∑ th the new coronavirus epidemics fades out.

3.2

Epidemiological scenarios considering control mechanisms

Using estimated transmission and additional mortality rates, we solve numerically the system
of equations (2), (3) and (4) considering only one control mechanism, that is, the isolation, due
to the fact that there is few number of testing kits, and treatment and vaccine are not available
yet.
In this section we fix the estimated transmission rates as Œ≤y = 0.77 and Œ≤o = œàŒ≤y = 0.9009
(days‚àí1 ), and the additional mortality rates, Œ±y = 0.0009 and Œ±o = 0.009 (days‚àí1 ).
We consider two cases: Isolation without subsequent releasing of isolated persons, and
isolation followed by releasing of these persons. By varying isolation parameters Œ∑2y and Œ∑2o , and
releasing parameters Œ∑3y and Œ∑3o , we present some epidemiological scenarios. In all scenarios, t
is simulation time, instead of calendar time.
3.2.1

Scenarios ‚Äì Isolation without releasing (Œ∑3y = Œ∑3o = 0)

At t = 0 (February 26) the first case of severe CiViD-19 was confirmed, and at t = 27 (March
24) isolation as mechanism of control (described by Œ∑2y and Œ∑2o ) was introduced until April 22.
We analyze two cases. First, there is indiscriminated isolation for young and elder persons,
hence we assume that the same rates of isolation are applied to young and elder persons, that
is, Œ∑2 = Œ∑2y = Œ∑2o . Further, there is discriminated (preferential) isolation of elder persons, hence
we assume that Œ∑2o 6= Œ∑2y .
Regime 1 ‚Äì Equal isolation of young and elder persons (Œ∑2 = Œ∑2y = Œ∑2o ) In regime 1,
we call equal isolation of young and elder persons in the sense of equal isolation rates. Recalling
that Œ∑2y and Œ∑2o are per-capita rates, both rates isolate proportionally young and elder persons,
but the actual number of isolation is higher among young persons.
We choose 7 different values for the isolation rate Œ∑2 (days‚àí1 ) applied to young and elder
persons. The values for Œ∑2 : 0.00021 (Rr = 1), 0.001 (Rr = 0.23), 0.005 (Rr = 0.048), 0.01
(Rr = 0.024), 0.015 (Rr = 0.016), 0.025 (Rr = 0.009) and 0.035 (Rr = 0.007). The value
for the reduced reproduction number is Rr is calculated from equation (10). For Œ∑2 = 0.035,
the reduced reproduction number with respect to the basic reproduction number is reduced in
0.1%. In all figures, the case Œ∑2 = 0 (R0 = 6.915) is also shown.
Figure 10 shows curves of severe cases of CoViD-19 D2j , j = y, o, without and with isolation
for different values of Œ∑2 . Notice that first two curves obtained with Œ∑2 = 0 and 0.00021
practically coincide, and the latter is slightly lower than the roughly estimated Œ∑ th = 2.19√ó10‚àí4
16

years‚àí1 . We present values of peak for three values of Œ∑2 . For Œ∑2 = 0, the peak of young (first
coordinate) and elder (second coordinate) persons are (5.532√ó105 ,2.061√ó105 ), and for Œ∑2 = 0.01
(3.566 √ó 105 ,1.361 √ó 105 ), and 0.035 (0.699 √ó 105 ,0.292 √ó 105 . The time (days) at which the
peak occurs for young (first coordinate) and elder (second coordinate) persons are for Œ∑2 = 0
(72,71), 0.01 (75,74) and 0.035 (77,77). For Œ∑2 = 0.01 in comparison with Œ∑2 = 0, the peaks
are reduced in 64.4% and 66.0%, respectively, for young and elder persons. For Œ∑2 = 0.035, the
peaks are reduced in 12.6% and 14.2%.

Figure 10: The curves of severe cases of CoViD-19 D2j , j = y, o, without and with isolation for
different values of Œ∑2 . Curves from top to bottom corresponds to increasing Œ∑2 .
As isolation parameter Œ∑2 increases, the diminishing peaks of curves of D2y and D2o displace
initially to right (higher times), but at Œ∑2 = Œ∑2c , they change the direction and move leftwardly.
However, all curves remain inside the curve without isolation (Œ∑2 = 0). The values at which the
c
c
peaks change direction are Œ∑2y
= 0.0027 days‚àí1 (t = 78.35) and Œ∑2o
= 0.0028 days‚àí1 (t = 77.58).
In order to understand this phenomenon, we recall an age-structured model to describe rubella
infection [11] [12]. There, as vaccination rate increases, the peaks of age-depending forces of
infection initially moves to right, and, then, move leftwardly. As a consequence, the average
age at the first infection increases.
At t = 27 isolation begun in the SaÃÉo Paulo State. For this reason, in the system of equations
(2), (3) and (4), we let Œ∑2 = 0 for t < 27, and Œ∑2 > 0 for t ‚â• 27. In Figure 11 we show the
estimated curves of severe CoViD-19 cases D2 without (Œ∑2 = 0 in all time) and with (Œ∑2 = 0.035
days‚àí1 ) isolation, which was introduced at t = 27. It seems that the effects of isolation (in
observed data) appears at around t = 38 (April 5), 11 days after its introduction. Figure
11 shows an isolation scheme described by Œ∑2 = 0.035 days‚àí1 introduced at t = 27, which
decreases the curve without isolation. The transition from without to with isolation is under
very complex dynamics, for this reason we can not assure that Œ∑2 = 0.035 days‚àí1 is a good
estimation (there are so few data). Hence, one of the curves in Figure 10 may correspond to
the isolation applied in the SaÃÉo Paulo State.

The curve corresponding to Œ∑2 = 0.00021 days‚àí1 in Figure 10 can be considered as a failure
isolation (Rr > 1), for this reason this curve is removed in all following figures.
Figure 12 shows curves of accumulated cases of severe CoViD-19 ‚Ñ¶j , j = y, o, without
and with isolation for different values of Œ∑2 . As isolation rate Œ∑2 increases, the accumulated
number of deaths due to severe CoViD-19 decreases. We present at t = 140 for three values
of Œ∑2 . For Œ∑2 = 0, the number of young (first coordinate) and elder (second coordinate)
persons are (1.798 √ó 106 ,5.630 √ó 105 ), and for Œ∑2 = 0.01 (1.278 √ó 106 ,4.063 √ó 105 ), and 0.035
(0.372 √ó 106 ,1.133 √ó 105 ). For Œ∑2 = 0.01 in comparison with Œ∑2 = 0, severe CoViD-19 cases are
reduced in 71.1% and 72.2%, respectively for young and elder persons. For Œ∑2 = 0.035, severe
CoViD-19 cases are reduced in 20.7% and 17.4%.
Figure 13 shows curves of accumulated cases of CoViD-19 deaths Œ†j , j = y, o, without and
with isolation for different values of Œ∑2 . We present at t = 140 for three values of Œ∑2 . For
Œ∑2 = 0, the number of young (first coordinate) and elder (second coordinate) persons are (1.6 √ó

For Œ∑2 = 0.01 in comparison with Œ∑2 = 0, death due to CoViD-19 cases are reduced in 70.9%

Figure 14 shows curves of the number of susceptible persons Sj , j = y, o, without and with

and for Œ∑2 = 0.01 (1.634√ó105 ,8190), and 0.035 (2.492√ó105 ,60620). For Œ∑2 = 0.01 in comparison
with Œ∑2 = 0, susceptible persons are increased in 132% and 333%, respectively for young and
elder persons. For Œ∑2 = 0.035, susceptible persons are increased in 201% and 2, 461%.
As isolation parameters Œ∑2 increases, the number of susceptible persons decreases according

phenomenon is understood recalling rubella transmission model [13]. There, as vaccination
rate increases, the fraction of susceptible persons decreases following damped oscillations when
Rr > 1, attaining non-trivial equilibrium point. However, for Rr < 1, there is trivial equilibrium

point and trajectories follows two pattern: (1) if Rr is not so low, the fraction of susceptible
persons decreases lower than the value of trivial equilibrium point, and must increase to attain
the equilibrium value, but not surpassing it (then there is not damped oscillations); and (2)
if Rr is low, the fraction of susceptible persons decreases never lower than the value of trivial
equilibrium point, for this reason attains this equilibrium value decaying exponentially without
surpassing it in any time.
Figure 15 shows curves of the number of isolated susceptible persons Sjis , j = y, o, with
isolation for different values of Œ∑2 , from equation (9). We present at t = 140 for three values of
Œ∑2 . For Œ∑2 = 0, there is not isolated persons, and for Œ∑2 = 0.01 (1.09 √ó 107 ,1.892 √ó 106 ), and
0.035 (3.079 √ó 107 ,5.419 √ó 106 ). For Œ∑2 = 0.01 in comparison with all persons N0 (at t = 0),
isolated susceptible persons are 2.4% and 0.42%, respectively for young and elder persons. For
Œ∑2 = 0.035, isolated susceptible persons are 6.9% and 1.22%.
Figure 16 shows curves of the number of immune persons Ij , j = y, o, without and with
isolation for different values of Œ∑2 . We present at t = 140 for three values of Œ∑2 . For Œ∑2 = 0,
the number of young (first coordinate) and elder (second coordinate) persons are (3.762 √ó
107 ,6.723 √ó 106 ), and for Œ∑2 = 0.01 (2.671 √ó 107 ,4.849 √ó 106 ), and 0.035 (0.683 √ó 107 ,1.349 √ó 106 ).
For Œ∑2 = 0.01 in comparison with Œ∑2 = 0, immune persons are reduced to 71.0% and 72.1%,
respectively for young and elder persons, very close to the reductions observed in deaths due
to CoViD-19. For Œ∑2 = 0.035, immune persons are reduced to 18.1% and 20.0%, very close to
the reductions observed in deaths due to CoViD-19.
Immunological parameters (peak of D2 , ‚Ñ¶, ,Œ† and I) are reduced quite similar for Œ∑2 = 0.035
days‚àí1 , between 4.8-times (21%) and 8.3-times (12%), however the susceptible persons left
behind at the end of the first wave increase dramatically, 20-times (young) and 240-times

Regime 2 ‚Äì Different isolation of young and elder persons (Œ∑2o 6= Œ∑2y ) In regime 2,
we call different isolation of young and elder persons in the sense that elder isolation rate is
fixed, and young isolation rate is varied, and vice-versa.
Firstly, we choose the isolation rate of elder persons Œ∑2o = 0.01 days‚àí1 , and vary Œ∑2y = 0.001
(Rr = 0.235), 0.005 (Rr = 0.049), 0.01 (Rr = 0.024), 0.015 (Rr = 0.016), 0.025 (Rr = 0.009),
0.035 (Rr = 0.007) and 0.1 (Rr = 0.002). The value for the reduced reproduction number is
Rr is calculated from equation (10).
Figure 17 shows curves of severe cases of CoViD-19 D2j , j = y, o, varying Œ∑2y , fixing Œ∑2o =
0.01 days‚àí1 . The decreasing pattern of D2y follows that observed in regime 1, but in D2o , as Œ∑2y
increases, the peaks displace faster to right, and the curves become more asymmetric (increased
skewness) and spread beyond the curve without isolation.

is at t = 27.
Figure 18 shows curves of the number of susceptible persons Sj , j = y, o, varying Œ∑2y , fixing
Œ∑2o = 0.01 days‚àí1 . The decreasing pattern of Sy follows that observed in regime 1 (sigmoid
shape substituted by exponential decay), but the sigmoid shaped decreasing curves of So , as
Œ∑2y increases, move from bottom to top, which is an opposite pattern observed in regime 1.
As isolation of young increases, the number of susceptible young persons decreases, but the
number of susceptible elder persons increases. However, from Figure 17, severe CoViD-19 cases
decrease for both subpopulations. This can be explained by the decreasing in immune persons:
young immune persons decrease 41-times when Œ∑2y decreases from 0.015 to 0.1, while elder
persons decrease 4-times (see Table 3).
The curves of accumulated cases of severe CoViD-19 ‚Ñ¶, accumulated cases of CoViD-19

of isolation is at t = 27.
(Œ∑2o = 0.01 days‚àí1 fixed) their values at t = 140 for young, elder and all persons, letting
Œ∑2y = 0.015, Œ∑2y = 0.035 and Œ∑2y = 0.1 (days‚àí1 ). For Œ∑2o = Œ∑2y = 0 we have, from foregoing
section, ‚Ñ¶y = 1.798√ó106 , ‚Ñ¶o = 5.630√ó105 and ‚Ñ¶ = 2.361√ó106 ; Œ†y = 1.6√ó104 , Œ†o = 6.265√ó104
and Œ† = 7.865 √ó 104 ; Sy = 1.239 √ó 105 , So = 2463 and S = 1.263 √ó 105 ; and Iy = 3.762 √ó 107 ,
Io = 6.723 √ó 106 and I = 4.434 √ó 107 . The percentages are calculated as the ratio between
epidemiological parameter evaluated with (Œ∑2j > 0) and without (Œ∑2y = Œ∑2o = 0) isolation, at
t = 140. The number of isolated susceptible persons is S is = 0 when there is not isolation,
hence the percentage is the ratio between S is at t = 140 and N0 .
Figures 17 and 18 and Table 3 portrait preferential isolation of young persons, but maintaining elder persons isolated at a fixed level. Hence, the increasing in Œ∑2y of course protects
young persons, but elder persons are also benefitted .
Now, we choose the isolation rate of young persons Œ∑2y = 0.01 days‚àí1 , and vary the isolation
rate of elder persons Œ∑2o (days‚àí1 ) for 7 different values: Œ∑2o = 0.001 (Rr = 0.025), 0.005
(Rr = 0.02444), 0.01 (Rr = 0.02442), 0.015 (Rr = 0.024416), 0.025 (Rr = 0.024413), 0.035
(Rr = 0.024411) and 0.1 (Rr = 0.02440).
Figure 19 shows curves of severe cases of CoViD-19 D2j , j = y, o, varying Œ∑2o , fixing Œ∑2y =
0.01 days‚àí1 . The same pattern observed in Figure 17, changing D2y by D2o , but more smooth.
Figure 20 shows curves of the number of susceptible persons Sj , j = y, o, varying Œ∑2o , fixing
Œ∑2y = 0.01 days‚àí1 . The same pattern observed in Figure 18, changing Sy by So .
The curves of accumulated cases of severe CoViD-19 ‚Ñ¶, accumulated cases of CoViD-19
deaths Œ†, the number of isolated susceptible person S is , and the number of immune persons
I are similar than those shown in foregoing section. For this reason, we present in Table 4

the total number of severe CoViD-19 cases ‚Ñ¶, the better strategy is isolating more young than
elder persons. However, if the goal is the reduction of fatality cases Œ†, the better strategy is the
isolating more elder than young persons, but if the isolation is very intense (Œ∑2y = Œ∑2o = 0.1),
then isolating more young persons is recommended. Notice that only strategy Œ∑2o = 0.01 and
Œ∑2y = 0.1 attains the number of isolated susceptible persons above the threshold 3.815 √ó 107 .

3.2.2

Scenarios ‚Äì Isolation and releasing

When releasing is introduced, then equation (9) is not anymore valid to evaluated the accumulated number of isolated susceptible persons. Hence, we use Qy , Qo and Q = Qy + Qo for the
numbers of isolated susceptible, respectively, young, elder and total persons. Qy and Qo are
solutions of the system of equations (2), (3) and (4).
At t = 0 (February 26) the first case of severe CiViD-19 was confirmed, and at t = 27
(March 24) isolation as mechanism of control (described by Œ∑2y and Œ∑2o ) was introduced until
April 22.2 Hence, the beginning of releasing of isolated persons will occur at the simulation
time t = 56.3 We assume that same rates of releasing are applied to young and elder persons,
that is, Œ∑3 = Œ∑3y = Œ∑3o , and consider regime 1-type isolation, that is, Œ∑2 = Œ∑2o = Œ∑2y . Hence,
from time 0 to 27 we have R0 = 6.915 (no isolation), we have regime 1-type isolation from
27 to 56 with Rr = 0.007, and sinceafter 56, we have isolation and releasing with value of Rr
depending on Œ∑3 .
In order to assess epidemiological scenarios when isolated persons are released, we fix Œ∑2 =
0.035 (days‚àí1 ), and vary Œ∑3 = 0 (Rr = 0.007), 0.0055 (Rr = 0.84), 0.01 (Rr = 1.49), 0.015
(Rr = 2.02), 0.25 (Rr = 2.82), 0.035 (Rr = 3.39) and 0.1 (Rr = 5.07). The value for the
reduced reproduction number is Rr is calculated from equation (10).
Figure 21 shows curves of severe cases of CoViD-19 D2j , j = y, o, fixing Œ∑2 = 0.035 days‚àí1 ,
and varying Œ∑3 . The beginning of release is at t = 56, date proposed by the SaÃÉo Paulo State
authorities. For instance, when Œ∑3 = 0.035 days‚àí1 , the peaks are for young and elder persons,
respectively, 2.31 √ó 105 and 9.06 √ó 104 , which occur at t = 99 and t = 98.

0.06% for, respectively, Œ∑3 = 0.015, 0.035 and 0.1 (days‚àí1 ); while by delaying in 7 days, both
are decreased in 0.9%, 0.6% and 0.2% for, respectively, Œ∑3 = 0.015, 0.035 and 0.1 (days‚àí1 ).
However, 0.9% represents 95 deaths.
In Figure 24 we show releasing occurring without isolation, that is, from time 0 to 27, we
29

have R0 = 6.915 (no isolation), we have regime 1-type isolation from 27 to 56, Rr = 0.007, and
sinceafter 56, we have only releasing with R0 = 6.915 (Œ∑2 = 0 and Œ∑3 = 0.035 days‚àí1 ).

Curves from top to bottom corresponds to decreasing Œ∑3 .
When releasing is done without new isolations, there appears small epidemics (see curve
for Œ∑3 = 0.005), which is delayed as Œ∑3 increases (for other values, the second small epidemics
does not appear until 360 days). If releasing strategy is done, the first wave does not vanish completely, except for huge releasing scheme (higher Œ∑3 ). This is a good epidemiological
scenario due to not only in the diminishing in the pressure for hospitalization (consequently,
decreases deaths), but also in the increasing in immune persons, hence decreasing the effective
reproduction number (known as herd immunity).

Discussion

System of equations (2), (3) and (4) were simulated to providing epidemiological scenarios. These scenarios are more reliable if based on credible values assigned to model parameters. We used ratio 4 : 1 for the ratios of asymptomatic:symptomatic and mild:severe (nonhospitalized:hospitalized) CoViD-19 [2]. Also, we let Œ±y = 0.1Œ±o , and Œ±o must be such that
deaths will occur in 10% of hospitalized elder persons, hence, 1% of hospitalized young persons will die [9]. We used overvalued parameters, except maybe the ratio between asymptomatic:symptomatic, which is completely unknown. In many viruses, the ratio is higher than
4 : 1, but for new coronavirus is unknown. When mass testing against new coronavirus could
be done, then this ratio can be estimated.
The least square estimation method was approximated by the sum of the square of the
distance between parametrized curve and observed data. When estimation of epidemic curves
30

are based on few available data, in general parameters are overestimated. Hence, both transmission and mortality rates were overestimated. Fortunately, there was another information to
use: 10% of fatality among elder hospitalized persons. Taking into account this information,
we estimated lower mortality rates, but estimated transmission rates were those based on few
available data. Hence, the basic reproduction number R0 = 6.915 seems overestimated.
Let us consider estimation of transmission and mortality rates based on few data. From
Figures 7 and 8, it is expected at the end of the fist wave of epidemics, 2.36 million of severe
(hospitalized) CoViD-19 cases, and 250 thousand of deaths due to this disease in the SaÃÉo Paulo
State. If we consider a 5-times higher inhabitants than the SaÃÉo Paulo State, it is expected 11.8
million of severe (hospitalized) CoViD-19 cases, and 1, 250 thousand of deaths. Approximately
these numbers of cases and deaths were projected to Brazil by Ferguson et al. [4]. However,
the second method of estimation for fatality rates resulted in 78.7 thousand of deaths in the
SaÃÉo Paulo State, but the number of severe cases is the same. Hence, extrapolating to Brazil,
the number is 383 thousand of deaths.
We address the question of the discrepancy in providing number of deaths during the first
wave of epidemics. Mathematical and computational (especially agent based models) models
that are based on data to estimate model parameters, these models must be fed continuously
with new data and reestimated model parameters. As the number of data increases, their
estimations become more and more reliable. Hence, initial estimations and forecasting are
extremely bad, and, moreover, they become dangerous when predicting catastrophic scenarios,
which can lead to formulate mistaken public health policies.
With respect to isolation of susceptible persons, depending on the target we have two
strategies. If the goal is decreasing the number of CoViD-19 cases in order to adequate capacity
of Hospital and ICU, the better strategy is isolating mor young than elder persons. However,
if death due to CoViD-19 is the main goal, better strategy is isolating more elder than young
persons.
We also studied releasing strategies. We compare the releasing that will be initiated in April
22, with releasing one week earlier (April 19) and one week later (April 29).
The estimated basic reproduction number and its partial values were R0 = 6.915 (partials
R0y = 5.606 and R0o = 1.309), and the asymptotic fraction of susceptible persons and its partial
fractions provided by Runge-Kutta method were s‚àó = 0.15008, s‚àóy = 0.14660 and s‚àóo = 0.00348.
Using equation (A.10), we obtain 1/R0 = 0.1446. Clearly, s‚àó is not the inverse of the basic
reproduction number R0 , and f (s‚àó , s‚àóy , s‚àóo ) in equation (A.10) is not s‚àó = s‚àóy + s‚àóo , neither
R0y s‚àóy + R0o s‚àóo . The analysis of the non-trivial equilibrium point to find f (s‚àó , s‚àóy , s‚àóo ) is left
to a further work. In order to understand this question, we suppose that new coronavirus
is circulating in non-communicating young and elder sub-populations, then each population
approach to s‚àóy = 1/R0y = 0.178 or s‚àóo = 1/R0o = 0.764 at steady state (non-trivial equilibrium
point P ‚àó ). But, new coronavirus is circulating in a homogeneously mixed populations of young
and elder persons (this is a strong assumption of the modeling). Using equation (1), let us
calculate the forces of infection Œª1 = Œ≤1y Ay + Œ≤2y D1y (contribution due to infectious young
persons), Œª2 = Œ≤1o Ao + Œ≤2o D1o (elder persons) and Œª = Œª1 + Œª2 (both classes), which are shown
in Figure 25 (Œª is the force of infection acting on young persons, and for elder persons, it is
enough multiplying by the factor œà).
The peaks of the force of infection for Œª1 , Œª2 and Œª are, respectively, 8.62 √ó 106 , 1.69 √ó 106

and 10.31 √ó 106 , which occur at 68.18, 66.94 and 68.18 (days), and contributions at peak of Œª1
and Œª2 with respect to Œª are 83.6% and 16.4%. The ratio between peaks Œª1 :Œª2 is 5.1:1, which
is close to the ratio between numbers of young:elder 5.5:1. When virus circulates in mixed
populations, young and elder persons are infected additionally by, respectively, elder (Œª2 ) and
young (Œª1 ) persons. This is the reason for the actual equilibrium values are bigger (s‚àóy > 1/R0y
and s‚àóo > R0o ), but among elder persons the increase (220-times) is huge (Œª1 , very big, acting
in relatively small population So ). For this reason contacts between elder and young persons
must be avoided.

Conclusion

We formulated a mathematical model considering two subpopulations comprised by young
and elder persons to study CoViD-19 in the SaÃÉo Paulo State, Brazil. The model considered
continuos but constant rates of isolation and releasing. In a future work, we change rates to
describe isolation and releasing by proportions of susceptible persons being isolated or released.
The reason behind this is the absence of translation of rates to proportions.
Our model estimated quite same number of severe CoViD-19 cases predicted by Ferguson
et al. [4] for Brazil, but 3.3-times lower for deaths due to CoViD-19. The difference is mainly
done by estimation of the additional mortality rates. It is also expected that R0 must be lower
if additional information may exist, or more data will be available. As consequence, maybe
severe CoViD019 cases should be much lower (consequently, deaths also). If currently adopted
lockdown is indeed based on the goal of decreasing hospitalized CoViD-19 cases, then our
model agrees, since it predicts that higher number of young and elder persons must be isolated
32

in order to achieve this objective. However, if the goal is reduction in the number of deaths
due to CoViD-19, as much elder persons must be isolated, but not so much young persons.
Remember that in a mixing of young and elder persons, the infection is much harmfull in
elder than young persons, which is reason to avoid contact between them. An optimal rates of
isolation of young and elder persons to reduce both CoViD-19 cases and deaths can be obtained
by optimal control theory [8].
If vaccine and efficient treatments are available, the pandemic of new coronavirus should
not be considered a threaten to public health. However, currently, there is not vaccine, neither
efficient treatment. For this reason the adoption of isolation or lockdown is a recommended
strategy, which can be less hardly implemented if there is enough kit to test against new coronavirus. Remember that all isolation strategies considered in our model assume the identification
of susceptible persons. Hence isolation as control mechanism allows an additional time to seek
for cure (medicine) and/or develop vaccine.

their fractions attain steady state (the sum of derivatives of all classes is zero). This system

Due to 17 equations, we do not deal with characteristic equation corresponding to Jacobian
matrix evaluated at P 0 , but we apply the next generation matrix theory [3].
The next generation matrix, evaluated at the trivial equilibrium P 0 , is obtained considering
the vector of variables x = (ey , ay , d1y , eo , ao , d1o ). We apply method proposed in [15] and proved
in [16]. There are control mechanisms (isolation), hence we obtain the reduced reproduction
number Rr by isolation.
In order to obtain the reduced reproduction number, diagonal matrix V is considered.

Instead of calculating the spectral radius (œÅ (F V ‚àí1 ) = Rr ), we apply procedure in [15]
(the sum of coefficients of characteristic equation), resulting in a threshold Rr . Hence, the
trivial equilibrium point P 0 is locally asymptotically stable (LAS) if Rr < 1.

and the characteristic equation corresponding to F V ‚àí1 is
Œª5 (Œª ‚àí Rr ) = 0.
The spectral radius is œÅ (F V ‚àí1 ) = Rr = Rry + Rro given by equation (A.8). Hence, the trivial
equilibrium point P 0 is LAS if œÅ < 1.
Both procedures resulted in the same threshold, hence, according to [19], the inverse of
the reduced reproduction number Rr given by equation (A.8) is a function of the fraction of
susceptible individuals at endemic equilibrium s‚àó through

where s‚àó = s‚àóy + s‚àóo (see [18] [19]). For this reason, the effective reproduction number Re [17],
which varies with time, can not be defined by Re = R0 (sy + œàso ), or Re = R0y sy + R0o œàso .

The function f (Œ∫) is determined by calculating the coordinates of the non-trivial equilibrium
point P ‚àó . For instance, for dengue transmission model, f (s‚àó1 , s‚àó2 ) = s‚àó1 √ó s‚àó2 , where s‚àó1 and s‚àó2
are the fractions at equilibrium of, respectively, humans and mosquitoes [18]. For tuberculosis
model considering drug-sensitive and resistant strains, there is not f (Œ∫), but s‚àó is solution of
a second degree polynomial [19].

From equation (A.10), let us assume (or approximate) that f s‚àó , s‚àóy , s‚àóo = s‚àóy + s‚àóo . Then,
we can define the effective reproduction number Re as
Re = Rr (sy + so ) ,

(A.11)

which depends on time, and when attains steady state (Re = 1), we have s‚àó = 1/Rr .
When a mechanism of protection of susceptible persons is introduced in a population, the
basic reproduction number R0 is reduced to Rr , the reduced reproduction number. The protection of susceptible persons is done or by vaccine (not yet available), or isolation (or quarantine).
The isolation was described by the isolation rate of susceptible persons Œ∑2j , with j = y, o. When
Œ∑2j = 0, the fraction of young persons and elders are, from equation (A.4),
