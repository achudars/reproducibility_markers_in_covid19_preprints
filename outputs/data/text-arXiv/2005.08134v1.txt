Abstract. Incidence - Cumulative Cases (ICC) curves are introduced and shown to provide a
simple framework for parameter identification in the case of the most elementary epidemiological
model, consisting of susceptible, infected, and removed compartments. This novel methodology is
used to estimate the basic reproductive number of recent outbreaks, including the ongoing COVID19 epidemic.

1. Overview
This article develops the theoretical underpinnings of the forecasting approach put forward in
[1], which was shown to lead to useful estimates of the characteristics (expected duration, final
number of cases, and peak intensity) of ongoing outbreaks. The present analysis additionally
provides a method for the practical identification of epidemiological parameters appearing in the
SIR (Susceptible - Infected - Removed) compartmental model. Because the proposed approach is
robust to under-reporting, it provides a simple way to estimate the basic reproductive number of
an outbreak from reported incidence data.
The classical SIR model (see for instance [2]) is the simplest compartmental model that captures
the basic phenomenon of disease transmission: before recovering (or being removed through diseaseinduced death), infected individuals transmit the disease to susceptible individuals, who in turn
become infected. The process repeats itself until the epidemic has followed its course and no
additional infections occur. Many outbreaks have a time scale that is much shorter than the
scale at which the total population of N individuals changes, leading to the assumption that N is
constant. Defining the time-dependent quantities s = S/N, i = I/N, and r = R/N as the expected
sizes of the susceptible (S), infected (I), and recovered (R) compartments relative to the total
population N, so that s + i + r = 1, the SIR model is given by
ds
= −βsi;
dt

di
= βsi − γi;
dt

dr
= γi,
dt

where β is the contact rate of the disease and γ is its recovery rate. Scaling time by τ = 1/γ
turns the SIR model into a one-parameter (R0 ) model, where R0 = β/γ is the basic reproductive
number [3, 4] of the modeled epidemic. The disease spreads if R0 > 1 and dies out when R0 < 1.
We also see from the right-hand side of the equation for di/dt that for i 6= 0, the proportion of
infected individuals grows as a function of time as long as s > γ/β = 1/R0 .
The forecasting method proposed in [1] relies on a general property of epidemiological compartment models, which was both empirically observed in epidemiological data sets and confirmed
through numerical simulations: in the plane of coordinates C (cumulative cases) and I (incidence),
the trajectory of an outbreak is a concave-down curve resembling a parabola (see [1] for examples).
We call such a curve an ICC (incidence - cumulative cases) curve. In the present article, we provide
an exact expression for the ICC curve of the SIR model, in the form of the following theorem.

Details of the derivation of this theorem are given in Section 2.1. Its significance is illustrated
in Figure 1, which shows a numerical simulation of the SIR model and a plot of the corresponding
ICC curve for R0 = 2. Instead of considering the time dependence of S, I, and R as shown in the
left panel of Figure 1, the course of the outbreak is captured by a single curve: a plot of incidence
versus cumulative cases. As explained in Section 2.1, knowledge of the ICC curve is sufficient to
reconstruct the time-dependence of S, I, and R. In other words, the ICC curve contains the entire
information associated with any outbreak described by the SIR model.

ICC curve is shown on the right. The exact expression given by Equation (1) is
plotted as a solid black line; the numerically estimated ICC curve is shown as a
thick cyan line.
An important motivation for studying ICC curves is that they can easily be fitted to case data.
Specifically, we show in Section 3.1 that, for fixed N , there exists a single set of parameters (β, γ, κ)
that minimizes the root mean square error between the simulated outbreak data and the ICC
curve I = Gκ,N (C) given by Equation (1). Moreover, such an estimation is robust to noise. As a
consequence, the present approach provides a method to estimate the parameters of the SIR model,
thereby making this model practically identifiable.
The rest of this manuscript is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the derivation of Equations
(1) and 2, and discusses the robustness of ICC curves to systemic under- (or over-) reporting.
Section 3 explains how model parameters may be retrieved from ICC curves and assesses the
robustness of the proposed procedure to reporting noise. Section 4 briefly discusses parameter
estimation as an outbreak unfolds. Section 5 shows a few examples of application on real outbreak
data. Future extensions and applications of the methodology proposed in this article are reviewed
in Section 6.

2. ICC curves of the SIR Model
2.1. Exact form. Epidemiologists use the epidemiological (EPI) curve, a plot of incidence as a
function of time, to visualize the course of an epidemic. In the SIR model, incidence is defined as
I
dC
=
,
N
dt
where C = R + I is the cumulative number of cases at time t. Note that C includes those who
have recovered (and thus were a case at some point in time), as well as those who are currently
infected. To derive Equation (1), write ds/dr = −βs/γ = −R0 s, which can be integrated to give
s = κ exp(−R0 r), where κ ∈ (0, 1) is a constant that depends on initial conditions. Typically,
κ ' 1 (see e.g. [5]) since for an outbreak in a naive population we normally have r(0) = 0,
i(0) << 1, and thus κ = s(0) ' 1. However here we do not make this assumption and keep the
parameter κ in the following discussion. With c = C/N and s = 1 − (i + r) = 1 − c, we obtain

ln(s/κ) = −

ln((1 − c)/κ))(1 − c).

Moving back to dimensional variables, we see that I = dC/dt = Gκ,N (C). The ICC curve of the
SIR model with initial conditions described by κ is thus given by Equation (1). Since Gκ,N ≥ 0 on
[0, C∞ ], for a given initial condition κ = 1 − C(0)/N , the part of the ICC curve traced out as the
outbreak unfolds will be such that C(t) ≥ C(0) > 0. However, the ICC curve is well defined for
C in the range [0, C∞ ], which is the definition we adopt here. Even though the time variable does
not appear in the ICC curve, the value of κ is not arbitrary: C(0) is the value of C when R = 0,
where R represents the removed compartment.
An approximate expression of the SIR ICC curve, assuming κ = 1 and C/N sufficiently small was
given in [1]. ICC curves are particularly useful for forecasting the course of an outbreak because
they contain information on quantities that are of interest to public health practitioners, namely
the final number of cases (C∞ ) and peak incidence (Imax ). The latter is simply the maximum
of Gκ,N ; the former may be found as follows. Since C is the cumulative number of cases, C is a
monotonic function of time and its derivative, Gκ,N (C), must remain non-negative. For C/N small,
Gκ,N (C) = Gκ,N (0) + C(β − γ + γ ln(κ)) + O(C 2 )
where Gκ,N (0) = −N γ ln(κ) > 0. By continuity, Gκ,N (C) will remain non-negative on the interval
[0, C∞ ], where C∞ is the unique positive solution of Equation (2). By writing Equation (2) as
N = C∞ +κN exp(−R0 C∞ /N ), where the right-hand-side is the sum of two non-negative monotonic
functions of C∞ , one increasing and the other decreasing, and since 0 < κ < 1, one can see that
such a solution exists and is unique. Asymptotically, when the disease has followed its course and
all infections have occurred, I = 0 and C = R. Then, S = κN exp(−R0 R/N ) = κN exp(−R0 C/N )
and the conservation law N = S + I + R becomes N = κN exp(−R0 C/N ) + C. In other words,
C∞ defined in Equation (2) is simply the final (asymptotic) number of cases associated with the
outbreak. This concludes the proof of Theorem 1.
To see that the entire dynamics of an outbreak in the SIR model is captured by the associated
ICC curve, note that knowledge of C(t) leads to knowledge of

, and I(t) = C(t) − R(t).

In other words, the time course of S, I, and R may be obtained from the solution of the differential
equation dC/dt = Gκ,N (C) prescribed by the ICC curve, with appropriate initial conditions (which
in turn define the value of κ).

2.2. Robustness to under- or over-reporting. The quantity N appearing in Equation (1)
refers to the total population taken into account in the model, which is conserved by the dynamics.
In case of over- or under-reporting, the observed incidence expectation Io is a fraction of the actual
incidence I, so that Io = αI, where we assume that α is constant or varying slowly enough for its
derivative to be negligible.

where No = αN . Therefore, the ICC curve in the presence of over-reporting (α > 1) or underreporting (α < 1) has the same functional form, with the same parameter values, as the true ICC
curve, provided I, C, and N are rescaled by the factor α. For the same reason, κ = S(0)/N is also
independent of the value of α.
While systematic under- or over-reportding does not affect the ICC curve provided the size of
each compartment is appropriately rescaled, the reproductive number depends on N through the
ratio C∞ /N , as can be seen from Equation (2), in which setting κ = 1 leads to

Finally, rescaling time amounts to rescaling β and γ, and consequently the ICC curve.
3. Parameter identification
Structural identifiability (see e.g. [6] for a review) relates to the ability of uniquely identifying
model parameters from knowledge of the model output. In this context, N is assumed to be known
since it represents the population of the system to which the model is applied. Given C(t), one
can calculate I(t) = dC/dt = Gκ,N (C(t)). From Equation (1), it is clear that knowledge of C(t)
and I(t) uniquely determines β, γ, and κ. Indeed, if two sets of parameters, (β (1) , γ (1) , κ(1) ) and
(β (2) , γ (2) , κ(2) ), led to the same output C(t) (and thus to the same values of its derivative I(t)),

of the parameters of the SIR model, including initial conditions, are structurally identifiable from
knowledge of C(t), the cumulative number of cases, and N , the size of the susceptible population.

Whereas structural identifiability depends on the nature of the model itself, practical identifiability relates to parameter identifiability in the presence of measurement noise, as well as (hopefully

small) deviations between model and reality (see e.g. [6]). This question may be addressed numerically by simulating an exact solution of the model, adding noise to its output, and estimating the
model parameters that best fit the perturbed output. Two recent articles [9, 10] discuss the practical identifiability of a variety of compartmental models and reach different conclusions regarding
parameter identification of the SEIR model from cumulative data. In [9], the cumulative data
is multiplied by 1 + , where  is normally distributed with zero mean, whereas in [10], Poissondistributed noise of mean equal to the current incidence value [11] is used as a substitute for the
incidence data. Whether or not parameters are identifiable in practice therefore depends on the
type of observational noise that affects surveillance reports and thus the EPI curve.
Adding independently-distributed noise to the incidence rather than the cumulative data is more
realistic since errors on C are considered to accumulate and not be independent [12]. On the one
hand, assuming Poisson-type of uncertainty is natural for data that represent counts, but the effect
of replacing incidence data by a Poisson random variable of same mean will lead to significant
relative deviations only if N is small (a few hundreds).
√ For larger values of N and thus of I, the
relative change δI = |I − Poisson(I)|/I scales like 1/ I. Indeed,

Figure 2. (Color online). Empirical ICC curves for two hypothetical outbreaks
described by the SIR model with Poisson-distributed reporting noise. Incidence
information is assumed to be available every δt , with δt = 1 for R0 = 2 and δt = 2
for R0 = 10.5. In each panel, stars correspond to the simulated outbreak data
plotted in the (C, I) plane. Data points without added noise (circles) and the exact
ICC curve (solid line) are also shown.
To test practical identifiability, we simulate the SIR model and generate a discrete time series for
the cumulative number of cases of the simulated outbreak. This time series is used as a reference and
represents the unperturbed (or true) data. We then add noise to the associated discrete incidence
data (defined as the difference of cumulative values between consecutive time points), following the
procedure described in [11], with the additional realistic constraint that the final number of cases
is the same for all noisy realizations of the same outbreak. Two examples of simulated outbreaks

6

JOCELINE LEGA

generated in this fashion are shown in Figure 2 for different values of R0 (associated with different
orders of magnitude of the incidence I) and different discretization time steps δt . For R0 = 2,
we use δt = 1. For R0 = 10.5, we use δt = 2. As shown in Figure 2, this latter choice leads to a
discretized ICC curve with very few points in regions of large incidence, and simulates a situation
where incidence data is of poorer frequency. Each time series, consisting of noisy incidence data,
is used to calculate an associated time series for the corresponding cumulative data. The resulting
set of points is plotted in the (C, I) plane, and defines an empirical ICC curve. In both panels of
Figure 2, C and I are estimated from discrete incidence data as described in Equation (5) below.
3.1. Fitting ICC curves to data. Given a simulated time series for the number of cases of an
outbreak in a population of size N , we find the parameters of the ICC curve that best fits the data
by least square minimization. This approach is different from parameter identification methods
that have been proposed in the literature until now. Indeed, traditional methods aim to find the
best combination of model parameters consistent with observed time series; they therefore require
numerical integration of the compartmental model whose parameters need to be identified, in order
to estimate and then minimize an associated cost function (see for instance [9–11]). Instead, the
approach we put forward here consists in finding model parameters by directly fitting the relevant
ICC curve to the data. We claim that this is a more robust approach because the functional that
needs to be minimized has a unique extremizer in parameter space, which can be calculated exactly
from the data points.
Given a time series of discrete incidences {Ik , k = 0, · · · , M }, or of discrete cumulative cases
P
{Ck = kj=0 Ij , k = 0, · · · , M } recorded every δt units of time, we introduce a cost function that
measures how much the data points depart from the ICC curve of the SIR model parametrized by
β, γ, and p = ln(κ). This function, Ee , is defined by

A Maple [13] calculation shows that the cost function Ee has a unique critical point, whose expression

simplified by setting p = 0. The resulting cost functional then has a unique minimum, whose value
may easily be calculated. With the following notation,

In what follows, we use the expressions given in Appendix A, which can easily be coded up. We
checked that for time series generated from an SIR model with κ ' 1, the simplified expressions
above provide good estimates of the actual values of β and γ that were used to generate the reference
outbreak. Importantly, we now have a means of associating a single set of values for the parameters
β, γ, and p = ln(κ) to each outbreak time series.
3.2. Parameter identification in the presence of noise. We now use the expressions found
in Section 3.1 to assess the robustness of the proposed parameter identification method to noise.
As discussed above, the SIR model will be declared practically identifiable provided good estimates
of the parameters may be obtained from noisy data. We therefore simulate 100,000 noisy time
series from a “reference” numerical integration of the SIR model, use the formulas of Appendix A
to calculate pc , βc , and γc for each time series, and plot histograms of the estimated values of β
and γ. We consider the two types of noise discussed above, both affecting the reported discrete
incidence Ii = I(ti− 1 ). In Case A, we assume that at each time point ti− 1 , the reported value of I
2
2
has a Poisson distribution of mean Iref (ti− 1 ). In Case B, it is assumed that the reported value of
2
Ii at each time point is of the form (1 + si ) Iref (ti− 1 ), where Iref is the discrete incidence of the
2
reference outbreak,  is the noise amplitude, and si is standard normal.
3.2.1. Case A: Poisson-distributed incidence. Figure 3 shows the distributions (in the form of properly scaled histograms) of βc , γc , and R0 = βγcc obtained from 100,000 noisy realization from a
reference simulation of an SIR model with parameters β = 0.5 and γ = 0.25 (R0 = 2). Figure 4
shows similar plots for β = 0.5 and γ ' 0.0476, so that R0 = 10.5. In each case, the size of the total
population is N = 10000 individuals. The corresponding sample means and standard deviations
are displayed in Table 1. These results indicate that the respective means of βc and γc provide
very good estimates of the parameters β and γ. Accuracy is not as good for the larger value of R0 ,
whose distribution shows a fairly long tail. This is to be expected because the actual value of γ
in this case is close to zero. Moreover, the number of data points away from the end points of the
outbreak is much smaller for R0 = 10.5 than for R0 = 2 (see Figure 2), leading to a potential loss
of information.

to be well described by a Poisson distribution, as in Case A above. We however perform the present
tests to illustrate the robustness of the parameter estimation method introduced in this article.

For R0 = 2, the parameter estimation procedure is robust at all values of  considered. Means
and standard deviations of βc , γc , and R0 = βc /γc are displayed in Table 2. The corresponding
distributions are shown in the top row of Figure 5. As expected, estimates of β and γ are not as
accurate for simulations with R0 = 10.5, but return mean values for β and γ that are close to the
exact values. The distributions of βc /γc however shows very long tails (see bottom row of Figure
5), due to values of γc close to zero. In such a case, estimating R0 as the ratio < βc > / < γc >
however gives acceptable values, equal to 9.96, 9.19, and 7.53, for  equal to 0.05, 0.15, and 0.25
respectively.

Corresponding means and standard deviations are displayed in Table 2.
In summary, the above numerical simulations indicate that the ICC-based parameter estimation
method presented here provides good results in the presence of reporting noise. Not surprisingly,
the quality of the estimates depends on the rate at which incidence is sampled and, in the case of
normally distributed noise, on the amplitude of the noise.
4. Parameter identification as the outbreak unfolds
In principle, the formulas for βc and γc given in Appendix A may be used with any number of
points M , as long as the data points represent the entire ICC curve. Is is natural to ask how the
method performs when applied to a developing outbreak. To test this, we simulate 50,000 possible
outbreaks using the same reference simulations as before, and with the two different types of noise
introduced above to represent reporting error. We then follow the evolution of the distributions of
the estimated parameters as time increases. For R0 = 2, the outbreak has run its course after 60
units of time, and we include up to Mmax = 40 data points, with consecutive values separated by 1
unit of time (which could correspond to a day or a week depending on the disease). For R0 = 10.5,
we pick Mmax = 80, with data points separated by 2 units of time. Figure 6 shows estimated values
of β, γ, and R0 = 2 for the two types of reporting noise. In both cases, estimates of β and γ are
close to their actual values near t = 20, which is before the peak of the outbreak (see left panel of
Figure 1). The value of R0 converges more slowly (circles in the bottom row of Figure 6) but the
ratio of the estimated values of β and γ (stars) is close to the actual value of R0 near t = 12, fairly
early in the outbreak.
Similar results for R0 = 10.5, together with plots showing the evolution of the distributions of βc ,
γc , and R0 , are provided as supplementary material. Parameter estimates for β and γ are close to

their true values near t = 22, which is near the peak of the outbreak, with the ratio < β > / < γ >
giving a reasonable estimate of R0 starting at t = 18, even in the presence of large uncertainty.
5. Application to outbreak data
So far, we have assumed the size of the susceptible population, N , to be known. In practice, the
value of N that should be used to fit the ICC curve to outbreak data is often unknown since it may
reflect under-reporting (as discussed in Section 2.2) or spatial effects (existence of localized clusters
to which the spread is restricted) associated with the outbreak. Moreover, it could be argued that
the SIR model is too simplistic to represent real-life outbreaks. The examples of [1] and those
discussed below however show there is merit to the present approach.
In what follows, we fit ICC curves to surveillance reports by picking a range of values of N for
which the root mean square error (RMSE) between the ICC curve and the data is within 2% of
the minimum RMSE value. The data points used in the evaluation of the RMSE are found from
the reported cumulative data after smoothing and interpolation. This latter procedure estimates
missing incidence values and removes negative incidence reports, if any. The resulting time series
is expected to be a better approximation of the “true” (i.e. as close as possible to the output of a
compartmental model) evolution of the cumulative data, and is used for the parameter estimation
procedure discussed in this article. Our first example is for a gastroenteritis outbreak in a nursing
home in Majorca, Spain, and is therefore spatially localized. The other examples are estimations of
the basic reproductive number for COVID-19 outbreaks in Hubei Province (China), the Republic
of Korea, and France.
5.1. Gastroenteritis outbreak in Majorca, Spain. We use the same data set as in [1], estimated from the epidemiological curve provided in [14]. We fit the ICC curve to the interpolated
data (i.e. find βc (N ), γc (N ), and pc (N )) for a range of values of N , identify the value Nm of N
that best fits the data (i.e. for which the RMSE is minimum), and select a range of values of N
near Nm that give a RMSE within 2% of its minimum. Then, for each value of N in the selected
range, we apply the parameter estimation procedure discussed in this article, with 10,000 oubreak
realizations, obtained from adding Poisson-distributed noise to the smoothed and interpolated data.
Figure 7 shows the resulting parameter distributions (top panel; N ∈ [96, 147]) and a plot of the

ICC curve for the average parameter values (bottom panel; N = 121, β = 1.37, and γ = 0.91).
The value of R0 for the ICC curve displayed is 1.52 (whereas the average value of R0 is 1.55), and
corresponds to an attack rate of 59.4%. This is near the upper boundary of the 95% confidence
interval (38.5 % - 61.3 %) for the overall attack rate, but well within the 95% confidence interval
of the attack rate among nursing home residents (42.1 % - 72.2 %) reported in [14].

a nursing home in Majorca, Spain [14]. The top panel shows histograms (scaled to
represent probability distributions) of βc , γc , and R0 , for N ∈ [96, 147]. The bottom
panel shows the ICC curve for the average parameter values, corresponding to a
value of R0 = 1.52.
5.2. COVID-19. Figure 8 shows ICC curves for COVID-19 outbreaks in a few countries. The
data was obtained from the World Health Organization daily situation reports [15] as well as from
the Wuhan Health Municipal Commission [16]. For Hubei Province, only laboratory confirmed
cases were used. Consequently, daily increment values for 2/17-19/2020 (days 65 to 67 in the data
set, when China combined laboratory and clinically confirmed cases in its reports for a brief period
of time) were set to half of the reported number of confirmed cases; the number of cumulative cases
was then obtained by summing daily reports of laboratory confirmed cases. For the Republic of
Korea, only the first 58 points in the data set were used, since they correspond to the first wave
of the outbreak. The third example is for a country (France), where the outbreak appears to have
passed its peak (as of 4/15/2020), but is not over. In all of these examples, the figure shows the
ICC curve for the set of parameters that best fits the interpolated data. The optimal values of
N are N = 51160 for Hubei Province, N = 10282 for the Republic of Korea, and N = 161138
for France. The corresponding optimal values of the basic reproductive number are R0 = 2.74 for
Hubei Province, R0 = 2.13 for the Republic of Korea, and R0 = 1.96 for France. A histogram
of estimated values of R0 , scaled to represent a probability distribution function, is shown in the
right panel of each row of Figure 8. These were obtained as described above in the case of the
outbreak in Majorca, except that no Poisson-distributed noise was added to the data. This is
because incidence values are generally large and that, as discussed in Section 3, the relative effect
of the added noise is minimal, leading to a level of variability of R0 that is insignificant compared
to the effect of changing N . Values of R0 in the 2-3 range are consistent with early estimates of
the basic reproductive number of COVID-19 published in the literature [17, 18].

The time course of the COVID-19 outbreak in Hubei Province, as described by the SIR model
with the optimal parameters identified by the present method (β = 0.401, γ = 0.146 (R0 = 2.74),
and N = 51160) is shown in Figure 9, together with the reported data. The solid curves are
obtained by integration of the ICC curve, with initial conditions corresponding to day 10 of the
outbreak, and alignment with the data at day 45. Similar plots for the other outbreaks discussed
in this section are provided as supplementary material. The good visual agreement between model
and data indicates that the SIR model, and therefore of the ICC curve approach presented in this
manuscript, are able to capture the overal dynamics of real-life outbreaks.
6. Conclusions
This article introduces a parameter estimation method for disease outbreaks that bypasses the
numerical integration of epidemiological models. The approach relies on the use of ICC curves,
which relate incidence to the cumulative number of cases C. They may be viewed as nonlinear

transformations of the traditional epidemiological curves, in which the time variable is replaced by
C, a monotonically increasing but nonlinear function of time. For each single-wave outbreak, the
ICC curve has a simple concave-down shape that crosses the horizontal axis at the origin and at
the final value of C.
The formulas presented in Section 2, which extend the parabolic approximation suggested in [1],
are exact for the SIR model. The numerical experiments of Sections 3 and 4 show the method
is robust to noise and may be used for parameter estimation as an outbreak unfolds, with the
understanding that reasonably accurate estimates can only be reached shortly before, or after,
incidence peaks. This is not a shortcoming of the present approach and was also observed in [9]
when fitting synthetic prevalence time series.
Because of the simplicity of Equation 1, and the existence of a unique set of parameters that
best fits any collection of data points, parameter distributions may be generated directly from
epidemiological data. In the case of the SIR model, this methodology presents a fast and novel
alternative to more traditional parameter estimation strategies, such as particle Makov Chain Monte
Carlo methods (PMCMC; see [19] for a review). This may be beneficial in pandemic situations
where epidemiological estimates need to be updated daily and in many locations simultaneously.
For instance, recent work on COVID-19 data from Wuhan suggests that an SIR model can better
capture the information contained in case reports than an SEIR model [20]. For more complex
compartmental models, distributions generated by the present approach may be used as priors for
PMCMC estimations of the contact and recovery rates of a disease.
When applying the proposed method to surveillance data, an estimate of N may not always be
available. The examples of Section 5 suggest that this parameter may be identified by optimizing the
fit between the ICC curve and a smoothed and interpolated version of the reported data. However,
any variability in the selected value of N will be associated with variability in estimates of the basic
reproduction number R0 . Indeed, for an outbreak that has completed its course, any good fit of
the reported data by an ICC curve will produce consistent values of C∞ , the final number of cases

14

JOCELINE LEGA

for the outbreak (see for instance the plots of Figure 8). Because of Equation 3, if C∞ is known,
the estimated value of R0 is only a function of N . This uncertainty is inherent to the SIR model
and cannot be avoided. The existence of a value Nm of N that best fits the data is encouraging,
but more robust estimates are likely to be obtained if additional information is available. In the
absence thereof, a range of values of N close to the optimal value Nm should be used to produce
credible intervals for the basic reproductive number R0 .
As previously mentioned, empirical (see [1]) and numerical observations by the author suggest
the concave-down shape of the ICC curve is ubiquitous in outbreak data and in compartmental epidemiological models. It would therefore be interesting to explore methods which, like the discussion
of Section 2 of this article, lead to exact formulations of ICC curves. In particular, knowledge of
how model parameters affect the shape of ICC curves could provide simple means to visualize the
consequences of mitigation effects. Combined with data assimilation, ICC curves may thus present
a convenient paradigm for forecasting the course of an outbreak.

We show below how the distributions of βc , γc , and the basic reproductive number R0 = βγcc
defined in the main body of the article evolve as functions of time during the course of an outbreak.
We consider two examples, with values of R0 equal to 2 and 10.5 respectively. For the former, Figure
S1 shows how histograms (scaled to approximate distribution functions) of parameter estimates in
the presence of Poisson-distributed noise narrow and center on the actual parameter values as the
number of available data points increases. Figure S2 shows similar results for normally-distributed
noise of amplitude 0.15. The corresponding time-dependence of S, I, and R is displayed in the
left panel of Figure 1, and the temporal evolution of the means and standard deviations of the
parameter estimates are shown in Figure 6, both in the main article.
