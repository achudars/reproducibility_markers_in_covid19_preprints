Abstract
The implementation of large-scale containment measures by governments to
contain the spread of the COVID-19 virus has resulted in a large supply and
demand shock throughout the global economy. Here, we use empirical vessel
tracking data and a newly developed algorithm to estimate the global maritime
trade losses during the first eight months of the pandemic. Our results show
widespread trade losses on a port level with the largest absolute losses found
for ports in China, the Middle-East and Western Europe, associated with the
collapse of specific supply-chains (e.g. oil, vehicle manufacturing). In total, we
estimate that global maritime trade reduced by -7.0% to -9.6% during the first
eight months of 2020, which is equal to around 206-286 million tonnes in volume
losses and up to 225-412 billion USD in value losses. The fishery, mining and
quarrying, electrical equipment and machinery manufacturing, and transport
equipment manufacturing sectors are hit hardest, with losses up to 11.8%.
Moreover, we find a large geographical disparity in losses, with some small
islands developing states and low-income economies suffering the largest
relative trade losses. We find a clear negative impact of COVID-19 related
business and public transport closures on country-wide exports. Overall, we
show how real-time indicators of economic activity can support governments
and international organisations in economic recovery efforts and allocate funds
to the hardest hit economies and sectors.

Introduction
The emergence and spread of COVID-19, caused by the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has forced countries worldwide to implement
large-scale containment measures to reduce the spread of the virus [1–4]. These
measures, which include among others international travel restrictions, business
closures, prohibition of large-scale private and public gatherings, and mandatory
quarantines, have shown to effectively reduce the rate of transmission of the virus
[1,3,5]. As a consequence, however, such policies have had large economic
repercussions, both in terms of domestic industry output and international trade, due
to diminishing production and reduced demand for some products. The resulting
demand and supply shocks has further cascaded through complex supply-chains
networks, causing spill-over effects to downstream and upstream suppliers,
domestically and internationally [6–8].

Previous research has intended to estimate the global macroeconomic impacts of
enforcement measures worldwide using model-based approaches, in particular inputoutput (I-O) analysis and computable general equilibrium (CGE) models [6–9]. For
instance, Inoue and Todo [8] estimate that an one month lockdown of Tokyo may lead
to a 5.2% contraction of the annual gross domestic production (GDP) of Japan. Lenzen
et al. [7] estimate the global macroeconomic losses to be around 4.2% of GDP,
whereas Guan et al. [6] estimate the losses in global value-added to be between 2540.3%, depending on the modelling scenario adopted. In addition, the World Trade
Organisation (WTO) projects that global international trade will contract by 13-32% in
2020 under a number of scenarios of disruptions to economic activity [10]. However,
the accuracy of these model-based estimates critically hinge on setting realistic

3

scenarios of the economic impacts and understanding how supply-chain dynamics
disrupt or buffer shocks. This includes making assumptions how enforcement policies
impact economies and predicting how countries recover from their economic downturn.
Given the large heterogeneity in containment policies implemented, in terms of
severity, duration and enforcements [1,11], alongside the complexity of shock
propagation through interconnected networks [12,13], the extent to which such modelbased approaches can predict the nature and scale of the economic impact currently
remains to be seen. Moreover, there is a lack of real-time global observational data to
validate and steer model projections, which may cause ill-informed decision-making or
misallocation of funds [5]. For instance, trade statistics, published by national statistical
agencies, are usually produced with some delay and are more comprehensive for
OECD countries. Hence, alternative data sources are needed to provide real-time
indicators of economic activity in order to fill existing data gaps and identify trends. For
instance, a report by UNCTAD [14] estimated that in the first half of 2020, global port
calls have declined by 8.7%, with the largest drop estimated to be in Europe, Australia
and Oceania.

Here, we use a novel dataset derived from empirical vessel tracking data in
combination with a newly developed algorithm to estimates the changes in
international maritime trade flows during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Maritime trade flows cover around 80% of the world’s trade in terms of volume [15],
and can hence be used as a first-order indicator of the status of economic activity in a
country. The newly derived dataset has a high spatial (166 countries) and temporal
(daily) resolution, which helps to track the impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak the global
economy, and the geographical disparity of impacts. To assess the impacts, we first

4

quantify the total trade losses and gains for ports and countries for the period JanuaryAugust by comparing the 2020 data to the same period in 2019. Second, we provide a
sector-level disaggregation to show how certain sectors have been disproportionally
affected by supply and demand changes. Third, we use a panel regression model with
fixed effects to estimate the impacts of specific containment policies on exports by
making use of the heterogeneity in the diversity, timing and severity of containment
measures across countries. Overall, we provide evidence how the impacts to global
trade are complex and dependent on the trade-dependencies, sector-composition and
policies implemented. The results provide timely information about which economies
are hit hardest, thereby helping decision-makers effectively target and prioritize
international aid and economic stimulus.

Method
Data and trade estimation
We derive estimates of port-level trade flows (imports and exports) for 1153 ports
across 166 countries worldwide using the geospatial location and attributes of maritime
vessels (from January 2019 - August 2020). To do this, we use Automatic Identification
System (AIS) data, which provides detailed data on the location, speed, direction and
vessel characteristics of all trade-carrying vessels with an AIS transponder (that send
information to terrestrial or satellite receivers every few seconds-minutes) [16]. This
data was obtained through a partnership with the UN Global Platform AIS Task Team
initiative (https://unstats.un.org/wiki/display/AIS/), which aims to develop algorithms
and methodologies to make AIS data useful for a variety of fields and applications
(traffic, economic trade, fisheries, CO2 emissions).

5

We develop an algorithm (S1 Appendix) that estimates the trade flows based on the
ingoing and outgoing movements of maritime vessels (~3.2 million port calls across
100,000 unique vessels) and their characteristics (e.g. dimensions, utilisation rate,
vessel type), going on to disaggregate these trade flows into specific sectors (11 sector
classification adopted here). We end up with daily sector-specific trade flow estimates
on a port-level, which we aggregate to a country-scale to perform the country-wide
impact analysis. This new algorithm significantly advances previous work [17–19] by
providing a global scale analysis and being able to provide a sector decomposition.
We validate the results (S1 Appendix) by comparing the derived trade estimates to
detailed port-level trade data obtained for five countries (Japan, United Kingdom,
United States, New Zealand, Brazil). Moreover, we compare our estimates to countrywide maritime trade flows obtained from UN Comtrade [20] mode of transport data for
27 countries.

Econometric model
The variation in trade losses among countries are driven by the differences in
containment measures introduced by countries (in terms of timing, duration, and
severity) [5], and due to supply shortages to domestic supply-chains and demand
reductions in trade-dependent economies [6]. Large-scale containment measures can
directly negatively influence industry output by affecting business operations (e.g.
workplace closure, mobility restrictions), or indirectly positively affect industry output
through effectively containing the virus outbreak and thereby allowing industrial
production processes and transportation of goods to continue. To study the
implications of large-scale containment measures on exports (which we use as a proxy
of industrial output), we match our daily, country-wide, estimates with data from the

6

Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) [21]. Within OxCGRT,
data is collected on the implementation and stringency of containment measures
across 160 countries. We utilise reduced-form econometric techniques [22] to estimate
the effect of different containment policies on exports across a balanced sample of 122
countries. We express export change as the percentage change in detrended exports
in 2020 compared to 2019 (S2 Appendix), which therefore controls for potential
seasonality and trends in the data. The time series is first smoothed using a 10-day
moving average in order to remove the daily noise and better capture the underlying
signal. We further control (see S2 Appendix for discussion) for several factors on a
daily-scale, including the number of confirmed cases as a fraction of the population,
reduction in demand in trade-dependent countries, the potential reduction in exports
due to supply-shortages (through imports that are used for exports, see Hummels et
al. [23]), and other endogenous factors that are likely to be serially correlated with
exports (which we control for by adding a lag of the export change).
From the OxCGRT [21], we obtained information on nine measures that potentially
affect business operations: C1 - School closing; C2 - Workplace closing; C3 - cancel
public events; C4 - Restrictions on gatherings; C5 - Close public transport; C6 - Stay
at home; C7 - Restrictions on internal movement; C8 - International travel controls; H2
- Testing policy. We scale the severity of the policies on a scale between 0 and 1,
thereby assuming a linear relationship between maritime exports and the severity of
policies. Moreover, we create a composite stringency index (Stringency) of all policies
(C1-C8) by adding all individual policies together and rescaling the index between 0
and 1. We performed multiple robustness checks to evaluate the influence of different
model specifications (see S2 Appendix).

Results
Model validation
We find a good fit between the values predicted by our algorithm and the reported trade
flows on a port-level (correlation coefficient between 0.52-0.96) and a country-level
(correlation coefficient between 0.79-0.98), with a general overestimation for smaller
ports, and ports and countries with large trade imbalances (e.g. small islands). For the
external validation data, we find correlation coefficients of 0.84-0.86 for the aggregated
trade data and 0.73-0.73 for the sector-specific trade data (on a country level). Again,
smaller trade flows are harder to predict. The accuracy of the method is also found to
be dependent on the coverage of information in the AIS data (some attributes are
manually put in), especially information on the vessel draft, which is less frequently
reported in developing countries.

Port-level trade flows
In the first eight months of 2020, the number of port calls across all ports reduced by
4.4% compared to same months in 2019. Fig 1a shows the average change in total
trade (imports + exports) in terms of volume (in million tonnes, MT) over the months
January-August. The vast majority of ports have experienced a decline in total trade,
although a number of ports in Brazil, the Gulf of Mexico region, the Middle-East,
Australia, and parts of South-Korea and the Philippines have seen an increase in trade
in 2020 relative to 2019. The top 20 port with the largest changes in volume in terms
of total trade, imports and exports are included in Table 1. The ports with the largest
absolute changes in volume are the ports of Ningbo (China, -68.5 MT), Rotterdam
(Netherlands, -43.2 MT), Shanghai (China, -32.5 MT), Wuhan (China, -21.6 MT) and

8

Tubarao (Brazil, -20.7 MT). The largest changes in imports are found for the ports of
Ningbo (China, -43.5 MT), Rotterdam (Netherlands, -40.1 MT), Shanghai (-22.4 MT),
Zhoushan (China, -22.4 MT) and Amsterdam (Netherlands, -12.2 MT). These ports,
and the other ports in the list, function as major gateway ports for a country to import
final products (New York-New Jersey, Rotterdam), or are essential for specific supplychains, such as textiles and electronics manufacturing (Shanghai, Ningbo, Zhoushan),
steel and paper manufacturing (Ghent, Amsterdam, Rizhou), car manufacturing
(Yokohama) and raw materials (coal imports for Krishnapatnam). The largest export
changes are found for the ports of Ningbo (China, -25.0 MT), Tubarao (Brazil, -17.1
MT), Novorossiysk (Russia, -11.5 MT), Wuhan (China, -10.8 MT), Beaumont (USA, 10.6 MT) and Dampier (Australia, -10.2 MT). These ports, and the other top 20 ports
with largest export losses, are all important export ports for global supply-chains,
including the exports of iron ore (Dampier, Tubarao), coal (Haypoint), oil and refined
petroleum products (Puerto Bolivar, Fujairah, Beaumont and Novorossiysk) and
manufacturing products (Ningbo, Wuhan and Shanghai).
Fig 1b-m show the changes in total trade per month for all ports and the cumulative
changes in trade over latitude and longitude. In January, losses are predominantly
pronounced in China that extended their Lunar New Year holiday [24], among other
measures, resulting in output losses to the Chinese industry. This resulted in a direct
demand shock, in particular for the export of raw materials (e.g. iron ore, copper, nickel)
that China predominantly imports [25]. This can be observed from the large negative
losses found in the large export ports of Brazil. In February, ports in Europe
experienced their first drop in imports (blue line top plot), while export losses are still
concentrated in Asia. This import drop in Europe coincided with the transit time from
China to Europe, which is around three weeks. The export drop is, alongside Brazil,

9

also visible in the main iron ore exporting ports in Australia (Port Hedland and Port
Walcott) and South Africa (Port of Richards Bay) that both supply iron ore to the
Chinese industry. In March, exports temporally recovered, while imports dropped in
many parts of the world, mainly to due to initiation of lockdowns in economies outside
Asia. In particular, India, Malaysia, Singapore, USA West Coast and Mexico have seen
a large drop in trade in this month. In April, trade partly recovers in the Northern
Hemisphere, while in May the second drop in global trade hits the global economy, as
a widespread reduction in demand and supply ripple through the economy. Losses are
again pronounced in China and Western Europe, leading to the lowest total import and
exports changes on a global scale. In June, July and August, a partial recovery is
visible for some ports, while the Middle-East, Eastern Australia, Japan and Western
Europe (in particular Belgium and the Netherlands) show large losses. For the MiddleEastern countries, the collapse of the oil market has contributed to the large trade
losses (which are predominantly exports losses). In August, signs of recovery
(especially imports) are visible for the Philippines, India, South Africa, Brazil and
Argentina, and parts of the Mediterranean, while other countries are still experiencing
large losses.

Fig 2a-b show the country-aggregated relative changes in imports and exports, with
the top 20 largest negative (relative) changes included in Table 2 and largest negative
absolute changes in S1 Table. The top 20 largest total trade losses range between 1736%. The largest percentage change in imports are associated with small economies
such as Turks and Caicos Islands, the Caribbean Netherlands, Bahrain, Anguilla,
Federated States of Micronesia and Madagascar (all between 28-37% reduction). Most
of the countries with the largest import losses are Small Island Developing States,
which are characterised by having large import-dependencies due to their small
domestic economies, being reliant on maritime trade flows for trade, and importing
large amount of goods to support the tourism sector that constitutes a large share of
the country’s GDP [26]. With the tourist industry collapsing due to the COVID-19
outbreak [27], the imports are expected to drop further significantly, explaining the
widespread reductions observed. Other countries, like a number of countries in Africa,
Myanmar, Oman, Philippines, the Baltic States and Sweden have increased their
imports, likely due to the increased need for food and medical supplies in developing
nations or increased household consumption in some developed countries. In terms of
exports, the largest relative losses are found for Libya, New Caledonia, Guinea-Bissau,
Northern Mariana Islands, Cape Verde and Sudan (all between 50-78% reduction).
These countries include many raw materials exporting countries that have suffered
from the demand shock across the world, in particular through trade dependencies with
Europe, China and the United States [28]. Moreover, many low income countries had
to pro-actively lockdown economies to protect their health care system, or are engaged
in economic activities that are less able to be done remotely [28,29]. Some countries
have increased their exports, such as India, Myanmar, Vietnam and Philippines,

13

potentially because of production shifts of manufacturing goods to these countries
when factory shut down in China [30]. Moreover, exports grew in Argentina, mainly due
to booming exports of food products (e.g. soybeans, beef) to the United States and
China [31], and in Tanzania, which increased its exports of gold and food (e.g. nuts)
and textile products (e.g. cotton) [32].
Using the World Bank income classification, we test whether high and upper middle
income countries have experienced more severe impacts than low and lower middle
income countries. Without excluding outliers from the data, we find a significant
difference (two-sided t-test with p>0.05) between both income groups for exports and
imports, with high and upper middle income countries having higher export losses.
Hence, although the high and upper middle income countries have higher mean export
losses, the most extreme export losses and gains are found for low and lower middle
income countries.

Time series of total and sector-specific trade changes
The total trade losses are not uniform across sectors. Fig 3 shows the estimated total
trade losses over time (Fig 3a) together with the trade losses for the 11 sector
classification considered. The total trade losses are found to be between -7.0% and 9.6% (mean -8.3%), which is equal to around 206-286 MT in volume losses and up to
225-412 billion USD in trade value (uncertainty due to differences in total import and
export losses and due to the volume to value conversion). The time series show (Fig
3a) a clear initial drop in trade in the first three months, after which trade partly
recovers, followed by a second, more pronounced, drop in trade. In late August 2020,
a sign of economic recovery is not yet visible.
Some supply-chains have been more resilient than others. The most resilient sectors
are found to be Textiles and wearing apparel (-4.1%), Food and beverages (-5.8%),
Other manufacturing (-6.0%) and Wood and paper (-6.3%). The times series of Textiles
and wearing apparel and Other manufacturing show, however, a large drop in exports
in the early stages of the pandemic, mainly associated with production in China and
other Asian economies (e.g. Bangladesh, Malaysia), followed by a gradual recovery
and a less steep second drop. The Wood and paper and Food and beverages sectors
have been more stable throughout pandemic outbreak, as supply-chains were not
significantly disrupted, and demand for products only gradually declined, followed by
signs of a recovery at the end of August. The largest relative changes are found for the
Fishing sector (-9.5%), Mining and quarrying (-9.0%), Manufacturing of electronics and
machinery (-8.8%), and Manufacturing of transport equipment (-11.8%). The drop in
fishing products peaked late in the pandemic with a clear recovery in July and August.
The time series of the mining and quarrying sector shows a more complex picture with
a sharp drop in the beginning of the pandemic, as demand for raw materials decreased

16

in Asia, followed by a steep increase in trade to restock inventories, after which a total
collapse of the market can be observed, mainly associated with reduced demand for
oil. For the two manufacturing sectors, the large losses are the result of significant
supply-chain disruptions that caused upstream production processes to halt due to a
shortage in supplies [8]. In particular the Transport manufacturing industry,
characterised by just-in-time logistic services and highly specialised production
processes, experienced a gradual disruption throughout the first few months, after
which trade declined more than 20% in May, June and July.

Impact of large-scale containment measures
The results of the panel regression model are included in Table 1. After testing various
model specifications (S1 Appendix), we find the most robust results for the model that
includes daily control variables for the number of confirmed cases as a fraction of the
population (Cases), demand reduction in trade dependent countries (Demand), the
potential supply disruptions through changes in import that are used for exports
(Supply), and potential other factors that are autocorrelated with the changes in export
(Export lag).
The effect of the composite index on daily export change is strong, and statistically
significant (p < 0.01), with a 10% increase of the index resulting in a -0.45% change in
exports (Model 1).
The influence of containment measures on exports is mixed with some measures
showing a negative impact while others showing a positive impact (Model 2). Negative
impacts are found for school closing (C1, - 2.63%, significant at p < 0.05), workplace
closure (C2, -4.76, significant at p < 0.01) and closing of public transport (C5, -3.59%
significant at p < 0.01).

Surpringly, a positive effect is found for stay at home

requirements (C6, +2.74%, significant at p < 0.10), restrictions on internal movement
(C7, +2.17%, significant at p < 0.10). Hence, implementing some policies has enabled
countries to continue producing export goods and transport them to their ports,
although the signal is generally not strong.
The results are potentially biased because of the fact that containment measures may
affect domestic production in a lagged manner. In S2 Appendix, we perform additional
robustness tests by introducing a 4/8/12/16 day lag of the containment policies. This
increases the negative effect of school closures, which varies between -3.36% and 6.87% depending on the lag (all significant at p < 0.01), while it increases the positive

18

effect of international travel bans for lags of 8 – 16 days (between +2.85% and 6.03%,
significant at p < 0.01).
Additionally, we run a model (Model 3 and 4 that includes daily dummy variables to
account for economy-wide factors that affect maritime exports) and a model (Model 5
and 6) which include only the days where the outbreak become significant in a country
(which we define as having at least 50 confirmed cases). This coefficient of the
composite index is stable across models (-4.53% versus -4.94% and -4.72%, Model 3
and 5). For the individual containment measures, the effect of school closures is larger
in Model 4 (-2.63%, significant at p < 0.05) and Model 6 (-6.53%, significant at p <
0.01). The positive effect of testing is enhanced in Model 6 (+2.83%, significant at p
<0.05), whereas the positive effect of stay at home policies becomes larger and
statistically significant in Model 4 and 6 (+2.74%, significant at p < 0.10; +6.53%,
significant at p < 0.01). The results change little when performing additional robust
checks by modifying the number of days of the lag of the export and adding week
dummies (instead of day dummies) to the model (see S2 Appendix).
Across all model specifications, we find a consistent negative relationship between the
overall stringency index and maritime exports, and business and public transport
closures and maritime exports, whereas all other policies are either not significant, or
not consistently significant across different model specifications.

Discussion and conclusion
We present a near-global analysis of maritime trade indicators based on empirical
vessel tracking data. We illustrate how the implementation of large-scale containment
measures have resulted in large trade losses, and hence domestic output, with a strong
geographical and sectoral heterogeneity.
Our estimate of a 4.4% reduction in global ports calls for the first eight months of 2020
is lower than the 8.7% predicted by UNCTAD for the first six months [14]. The main
reason for this difference is associated with the inclusion of different vessel types.
Whereas we include only the main trade-carrying vessels, the UNCTAD analysis also
20

included passengers vessels (66% of total port calls), which have seen the largest drop
in port calls (-17% for passenger vessels). Moreover, the sector-level trends we found
are in line with the sector-level impacts (based observed trade data of China, the
European Union and the United States) for the first quarter (Q1) of 2020 as presented
in the UNCTAD analysis [14], that stated that in particular the automotive industry (8%), machinery (-8%), office machinery (-8%) and textiles and apparel (-11%) are
particularly hit. Our analysis, which differs by only including maritime trade (instead of
total trade) and having a global scale (instead of three countries), found the average
losses in Q1 for the textiles and apparel (Sector 5), electrical equipment and machinery
manufacturing (Sector 9), transport equipment (Sector 10) and other manufacturing
(Sector 11) to be respectively 6.2%, 9.2%, 6.5% and 8.4%. The trade losses we
estimate (225-412 billion USD for the first eight months) are considerably lower than
reported in the modelling framework of Lenzen et al. [7], who estimated the trade
losses for the first five months of 2020 to be 536 billion USD. Again, part of this
difference is due to the coverage of countries (they provide a full global analysis) and
modes of transport (all modes compared to maritime only). Still, input-output based
analysis, as done in Lenzen et al. [7], often fail to consider adaptative behaviour in the
global economic system, which can dampen economic impacts [33]. The -8.6% trade
losses we found are also lower than the 26.8%, and up to 31%, value-added losses
(although not being directly comparable) reported in the global pandemic scenarios of
Guan et al. [6]. We expect the percentage change in trade losses to increase going
further in 2020, as daily trade losses are above 10% at the end of August. This is in
line with projections of the UNCTAD [14] and the WTO [10] that estimate a further
contraction of merchandise trade in the second half of 2020.

21

The results of the econometric model provide an alternative view to the studies that
have evaluated the effect of large-scaled containment measures on the spread of the
virus [1,2,4,34]. We find clear evidence of the negative impacts of large-scale
containment measures on changes in daily exports, with a 10% increase in the overall
stringency value resulting in a 0.45%-0.50% decrease in daily maritime exports. In
particular, introducing required closing of all public transport and all-but-essential
businesses resulted in large maritime export losses of up to 5.4-6.5% of daily export.
This is in agreement with Deb et al. [5], who used nitrogen emissions as an indicator
of industrial output and found that workplace closures had the largest influence on the
drop in emissions. Results should, however, be interpreted with caution, as many
factors could potentially influence these causal relationships. For instance, temporal
increases in maritime transport during some periods of the pandemic could be driven
by the large increase in trade of medical supplies (e.g. PPE) and mode substitution
from air to maritime [35], irrespective if policies were imposed during these periods.
Therefore, testing alternative economic indicators, such as data on retail sales,
mobility, flight, energy consumption and nitrogen emissions, as done in Deb et al. [5]
can help support these findings. Overall, our analysis of the economic implications of
introducing containment policies into society can help evaluating the cost-benefit of the
different containments measures, which may help governments construct effective
portfolios of policies as many countries enter a second-wave of COVID-19 cases [36].
Future work can refine our estimates by adding more trade data when it becomes
available, including extending the analysis to indicators of air, road and rail transport.
Moreover, the empirical estimates derived here can be used to constrain and validate
macro-economic impact models in order to improve the quantification of the total losses
to industrial output as the pandemic unfolds.

22

Overall, real-time indicators of economic activity, such as maritime trade, can help
identify trends in supply-chains networks and support governments and international
organisations in their economic recovery efforts by allocating funds to the hardest hit
economies and sectors.

Model description and formulation
To estimate the effect of various large-scale containment measures on daily maritime exports,
we apply reduced-form econometrics [1] using a fixed effect panel regression model. This type
of model has been used previously to estimate the effect of large-scale containment measures
on the spread of COVID-19 [2,3] and economic output (using nitrogen emissions as an
indicator) [3]. We follow a similar implementation of the model as done in previous studies,
although control more specifically for the potential supply and demand shock compared to for
instance Deb et al. [3].
For every country (i), we derive country-wide daily (t) indicators of the change in maritime
exports (Δ𝐸𝑖,𝑡 ) by aggregating the daily time series of estimated export data on a port-level. We
use exports as an indicator of industry output as it better reflects the status of the economy
compared to changes in imports, which are likely influenced by supply shortages (due to
reduced output in trade-dependent countries) and reduced demand for products (due to imposed
lockdowns). First, we detrend (using a linear regression) the 2019 time series in order to filter
out a structural increase or decrease in maritime exports. The trend is only removed if a
statistically significant trend is observed (p < 0.05). Second, we smooth the data using a 10 day
moving average, which is necessary to reduce the noise for countries with variable daily export
estimates (e.g. smaller economies). Third, we compare the 2020 time series (Jan – Aug) to the
time series for 2019 and estimate the percentage change deviation from the average daily
exports (based on 2019 daily data). We remove countries where the daily exports are zero for
at least one day, as this will likely bias the results (e.g. some small islands only export products
on certain days depending on the arrival of maritime vessels).
For every country, we retrieve information about the government policy responses from the
Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) [4]. We obtained information
on nine measures that potentially affect business operations: C1 - School closing; C2 Workplace closing; C3 - cancel public events; C4 - Restrictions on gatherings; C5 - Close public
transport; C6 - Stay at home; C7 - Restrictions on internal movement; C8 - International travel
controls; H2 - Testing policy. These measures all have different ordinal scales depending on
the different levels of responses (e.g. restrictions internal movements has two levels, whereas
international travels restrictions has four levels). We normalise all policies to a 0 to 1 range,
with 0 implying no measure implemented and 1 referring to the maximum severity of the
measure. This provides us with a set of daily policy responses (p) per country (𝑐𝑝,𝑖,𝑡 ). We also
derive an overall Stringency metric that is the sum of all policies (C1-C8) normalised to a 0 to
1 scale (𝑆𝑖,𝑡 ).
We control for several factors (𝑋𝑖,𝑡 ), including (1) the daily number of confirmed cases, (2) the
supply-shock, and (3) the demand-shock. These factor can cause variations in the export change
across countries. The daily number of confirmed cases are obtained from OxCGRT [4], which
we divide over the country’s population in order to estimate the fraction of the population that
is positively tested on a particular day. The estimate the supply-shock, we derive the daily,
sector-specific, changes in imports that are used to produce export products. To estimate the

percentage of sector-specific imports that are used for exports, we create a sector-specific
vertical specialisation coefficient per country, as proposed by Hummels et al. [5], using the
2015 EORA multi-regional input-output tables [6]. This coefficient reflect the dollar value
increase in imports for every dollar increase in exports in a country, including all industry
interdependencies. By multiplying this coefficient with the sector-specific daily data per
country, we estimate the daily time series of supply of goods that are used to produce exports.
We again derive daily percentage changes in the supply (similar as for the export time series,
see above). We implement this supply time series with a 7 day lag to account for lags in the use
of input products and to account for the potential buffering capacity of inventories. The daily
time series of the demand shock is derived by estimating the weighted average stringency value
in trade-dependent countries, assuming that countries that have higher stringency values
demand less products. The stringency values are derived from OxCGRT [4] and range between
0 and 100. We extract data from the 2018 (latest year available) BACI harmonized trade
database [7] and use this to estimate the daily demand shock by multiplying the stringency value
of the importing country with the fraction the bilateral trade flow (between exporting and
importing country) contributes to the total exports of exporting country (weight). For every
export country, we sum over the total number of trade relationships to end up with a weighted
mean stringency value. In this way, we account for the fact that exports can reduce before a
country implemented containment policies (as was the case in the beginning of the pandemic).
We hereby assume that a demand shock happens instantaneously without any lag.
At last, we add a three day lag of the export change (Δ𝐸𝑖,𝑡−Δ𝑡 ) itself to the model in order to
effectively control for the normal dynamics in daily exports and other endogenous factors that
are likely to be serially correlated with daily exports.
In summary, we can express the daily change in exports in 2020 compared to 2019 as:
Δ𝐸𝑖,𝑡 = μ𝑖 + 𝑐𝑝,𝑖,𝑡 + 𝑋𝑖,𝑡 + Δ𝐸𝑖,𝑡−Δ𝑡 + ϵ𝑖,𝑡
with μ𝑖 the country-specific fixed effect to account for time-invariant country characteristics.
We also tested implementing the policies as separate dummy variables per ordinal scale, in
order to capture non-linear effects, which gives similar results, although it becomes harder to
estimate the effect of the individual policies.
Alternatively, we can replace the individual policy interventions with the overall Stringency
estimate:
Δ𝐸𝑖,𝑡 = μ𝑖 + 𝑆𝑖,𝑡 + 𝑋𝑖,𝑡 + Δ𝐸𝑖,𝑡−Δ𝑡 + ϵ𝑖,𝑡
The results of these models are included in Table 1 in the main article.

Robustness checks
In order to account for the fact that the policies might effect exports in a lagged way, we
implement the individual policies in a lagged manner (𝑐𝑝,𝑖,𝑡−Δ𝑡 ) with Δ𝑡 = 4/8/12/16 days:
Δ𝐸𝑖,𝑡 = μ𝑖 + 𝑐𝑝,𝑖,𝑡−Δ𝑡 + 𝑋𝑖,𝑡 + Δ𝐸𝑖,𝑡−Δ𝑡 + ϵ𝑖,𝑡
The results are shown in S2 Table 1.

Moreover, we include a dummy for the week/day (τ𝑡 ) to account for changes in the global
economy that effect exports across countries:
Δ𝐸𝑖,𝑡 = 𝜇𝑖 + τ𝑡 + 𝑐𝑝,𝑖,𝑡 + 𝑋𝑖,𝑡 + Δ𝐸𝑖,𝑡−Δ𝑡 + 𝜖𝑖,𝑡
The results for the week and day dummy variables are included in S2 Table 2.
