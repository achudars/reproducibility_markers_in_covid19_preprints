Abstract
Preliminary epidemiologic, phylogenetic and clinical findings suggest that several novel
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants have increased
transmissibility and decreased efficacy of several existing vaccines. Four mutations in the
receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein that are reported to contribute to
increased transmission. Understanding physical mechanism responsible for the affinity
enhancement between the SARS-CoV-2 variants and ACE2 is the "urgent challenge" for
developing blockers, vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against the coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Based on a hydrophobic-interaction-based protein docking
mechanism, this study reveals that the mutation N501Y obviously increased the hydrophobic
attraction and decrease hydrophilic repulsion between the RBD and ACE2 that most likely
caused the transmissibility increment of the variants. By analyzing the mutation-induced

hydrophobic surface changes in the attraction and repulsion at the binding site of the
complexes of the SARS-CoV-2 variants and antibodies, we found out that all the
mutations of N501Y, E484K, K417N and L452R can selectively decrease or increase their
binding affinity with some antibodies.

The emergence of several variants of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) undoubtedly brings new challenges to the development of
vaccines and therapeutic antibodies. A key question is whether existing COVID-19
vaccines can protect against infection or disease from these new SARS-CoV-2 variants.
Due to the emergence of a new SARS-CoV-2 variant 501Y.V1 (B.1.1.7) in the United
Kingdom, there was an unexpected increase in reported COVID-19 cases (1). In South Africa,
a high transmission in the context of high population immunity are most likely caused by the
emergence of another SARS-CoV-2 variant 501Y.V2 (B.1.351)(2). Both the variants have a
mutation (N501Y) in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein, which is reported to
help increase transmission, and the increased transmission range is estimated to be between
40% and 70% (2). The 6501Y.V2 variant also has two mutations in the spike protein (E484K
and K417N) that give the antibody a potential immune escape opportunity(3). The

preliminary clinical trial results of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine showed 74%
effectiveness in the United Kingdom, but only 22% in South Africa(4). While another
COVID-19 vaccine NVX-CoV2373 showed 89% effectiveness in the United Kingdom,
but in South Africa, only 49%(5).
All SARS-CoV-2 variants enter human cells by protein-protein docking to human
angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the host cell membrane via CoV spike (S)
glycoproteins. Molecular structures of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 have been observed at
high resolution by using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) (6-8). The complex structures
of ACE2 bound to the SARS-CoV-2 S have also been experimentally determined (9-12).
Surprisingly, a change from asparagine (N) to tyrosine (Y) in amino-acid position 501 of the
RBD of SARS-CoV-2 S can obviously increase transmission, with estimates ranging between
40% and 70% for increased transmission.

The region of the protein responsible for binding another molecule is known as
the docking site (also sometimes called binding site) and is often a depression on the
molecular surface. The key to SARS-CoV-2 infection is that the S protein can specifically
bind to the ACE2 in a strong affinity manner. Specific binding of SARS-CoV-2 S and
ACE2 forms the joint structure between the coronavirus and the host cell that enable the
coronavirus enter the host cell (13). In natural intracellular environment and extracellular

medium, protein-protein docking are usually the contacts of high specificity established
between two or more specific protein molecules, and erroneous protein-protein docking
rarely occurs (14). The chief characteristic of proteins that allows their diverse set of
functions is their ability to dock with other proteins specifically and tightly. Proteinprotein docking is therefore considered one of the miracles of nature. The classic problem
of protein-protein docking is the question of how a protein find its partner in its natural
environment (15). In particular, whether hydrogen bonds formation regulate proteinprotein docking remains a long-standing problem with poorly defined mechanisms (1621). It is worth noting that hydrogen bonds formation is not a long-range physical force.
Considering that only several hydrogen bonds between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2
can be identified in the complex (9-12, 22), the docking between the coronavirus and the
host cell are most likely not dominated by hydrogen bond pairing between them.
A recent theoretical study revolutionize the understanding of docking affinity of SARSCoV-2

S

with

ACE2

and

the

physical mechanism for

protein

docking.

Traditional theories hold that, protein-protein docking is guided by a variety of physical
forces as follows: (i) hydrophobic effect, (ii) electrostatic forces, (iii) van der Waals forces,
(iv) hydrogen bonding, (v) ionic bonding, (vi) entropy. While the new theoretical study
emphasizes that only hydrophobic effect can play a decisive role for protein docking (16,
23). In extracellular medium, hydrogen-bond competing is always present with water.
Because, water molecules should be able to saturate the hydrogen bond formations of the
hydrophilic surface of proteins before the protein docking (24-26), due to water molecules
having very strong polarity (26-28). The interaction of protein surface with the
surrounding water is often referred to as protein hydration shell (also sometimes called
hydration layer) and is fundamental to structural stability of protein, because non-aqueous
solvents in general denature proteins (29). The hydration layer around a protein has been
found to have dynamics distinct from the bulk water to a distance of 1 nm and water
molecules slow down greatly when they encounter a protein(24). Thus, hydrophilic side
chains of proteins are normally hydrogen bonded with surrounding water molecules in
aqueous environments, thereby preventing the surface hydrophilic side-chains of proteins
from randomly hydrogen-bonding together (24, 25) (26). This is the reason why proteins

usually do not aggregate and crystallize in unsaturated aqueous solutions(30). Thus, this
problem may lie in our lack of understanding of how surface hydrophilic side-chains of a
protein at the docking site can get rid of their hydrogen-bonded water molecules, then
hydrogen-bond with other hydrophilic groups or approach to hydrophobic groups of a
partner protein at early steps of the docking, given the lack of awareness of the importance
of the shielding effect of water.
The hydrophobic interaction between hydrophobic surficial areas of two proteins at the
docking site can reintroduce entropy to the system via the breaking of their water cages
which frees the ordered water molecules(31). Thus, the hydrophobic collapse between
hydrophobic surface areas of a protein and hydrophobic surface areas of another protein
most likely triggers enthalpy-entropy compensation for the docking of the two proteins,
enabling the hydrophilic groups at the docking site to discard hydrogen-bonded water
molecules, and then hydrogen-bond with each other between the proteins or approach to
hydrophobic groups of the partner protein. This means that the hydrophobic interaction
among proteins should be responsible for the protein docking. The hydrophobic interaction
between the SARS-CoV-2 S and ACE2 protein is found to be significantly greater than that
between SARS-CoV S and ACE2 (32). This explains why the affinity of SARS-CoV-2

RBD and ACE2 far exceeds that of SARS-CoV RBD and ACE2.
Results
Binding ability of a protein is mediated by the tertiary structure of the protein, which
defines the docking site, and by the chemical properties of the surrounding amino acids'
side chains (33). The hydrophobicity of the protein surface is the main factor that stabilizes
the protein-protein binding, thus hydrophobic interaction among proteins play an
important role in determining the protein-protein binding affinity (23, 34, 35). Hydrophilic
side-chains are not completely hydrophilic. The hydrophilicity of hydrophilic side-chains
is normally expressed by C=O or N-H2 groups at their ends, and the other portions of
hydrophilic side-chains are hydrophobic, because the molecular structures of these
portions are basically alkyl and benzene ring structures. It means that there are a large
number of water molecules surround the hydrophobic surface areas of the RBD rather
than hydrogen bonded with the RBD. The characteristic of these water molecules

surrounding the hydrophobic surface areas is that their hydrogen bonding network is more
ordered than free liquid water molecules, that is, their entropy is lower. At the docking
site, a hydrophobic surface area of a protein facing to another hydrophobic surface area
of the other protein play a role of increasing the binding affinity between of the two
proteins. Whereas, a hydrophobic surface area of a protein facing to another hydrophilic
surface area of the other protein play a role of decreasing the binding affinity between of
the two proteins due to the repulsion. Thus, mutation of one amino acid residue at the
docking site may can obviously change the hydrophobic interactive surface areas of the
SARS-CoV-2 RBD at the docking site and may significantly change the hydrophobic
interaction between of the SARS-CoV-2 S and ACE2, thereby greatly change the affinity
between them.
For example, the original hydrophilic asparagine (N) in amino-acid position 501 of the
RBD was facing to a hydrophobic surface area one the ACE2 at the docking site. The
change from asparagine (N) to tyrosine (Y) in amino-acid position 501 increase
hydrophobic attraction area and decrease hydrophilic repulsion area between the two
proteins, see Fig.1. Therefore, a change from asparagine (N) to tyrosine (Y) in aminoacid position 501 of the RBD can change the original repulsing relationship between the
RBD and ACE2 to an attractive relation between them in amino-acid position 501. By
analyzing the mutation-induced surface hydrophobic or hydrophilic area changes at the
binding site of the complex of the SARS-CoV-2 variants and ACE2, we found out that
only the mutations N501Y obviously increase the binding affinity between the RBD to
the ACE2, and the mutation E484K and L452R slightly increase the binding affinity
between the RBD to the ACE2, see Fig.1 and Table 1. It is worth noting that the change
from Leucine (L) to arginine (R) in amino-acid position 452 due to the mutation L452R
introduce a new arginine-glutamic acid (R-E) electrostatic attraction between the RBD
and the ACE2 that may cause increment of the binding affinity.
Use same method, we can evaluate the impact of these mutations in the RBD on protection
capability of the existing antibodies. By analyzing the mutation-induced surface
hydrophobic or hydrophilic area changes at the binding site of the complex of the SARSCoV-2 variants and 9 existing antibodies, we found out that the mutation N501Y can

selectively decrease the binding affinity with the antibodies CV30, and CC12.1, see the
From 1. The mutation E484K can selectively decrease the binding affinity with the
antibodies B38. The mutation K417N can decrease the binding affinity with the antibodies
B38, CC12.3 and COVA2-39. The mutation E484K can selectively decrease the binding
affinity with the antibodies B38. The mutation L452R can selectively decrease the binding
affinity with the antibodies CB6, SR4, CV30, CC12.1, CC12.3, P2B-2F6, MR17-K99Y,
and B38. Taken together, only the antibody CB6 and CV30 was barely able to protect
against infection from all these new variants without obviously decreasing the
protective efficacy.
Conclusion
The higher transmissibility of the variants 501Y.V1 and 501Y.V2 are most likely
resourced from increment of hydrophobic attraction and decrement of hydrophilic
repulsion between the RBD and ACE2, due to the change from asparagine (N)
to tyrosine (Y) in amino-acid position 501 of the RBD. Thus, the only one amino acid

residue mutation not only increase the degree of hydrophobic paring between SARS-CoV2 RBD and ACE2 but also decrease the degree of hydrophobic-hydrophilic paring
between them, that greatly enhance the affinity of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 receptor and
obviously increase the infectiousness. By analyzing the mutation-induced area changes in
the attraction and repulsion at the binding site of the complex of the SARS-CoV-2 variants
and antibodies, we found out that all the mutations of N501Y, E484K, K417N and L452R
can selectively decrease or increase the binding affinity of some antibodies, cause only a
small minority of the existing antibodies can well protect against infection or disease from
all these SARS-CoV-2 variants as expected. Sufficient hydrophobic interaction at the
docking site between proteins should be regarded as the most important driving force for
the protein docking, providing enthalpy-entropy compensation at the docking site enable
the hydrophilic residues in this region get rid of the hydrogen-bonded water molecules,
and promote hydrogen bonding and electrostatic attraction among these hydrophilic sidechains at the binding site. Docking affinity between virus variants and the receptor must
be sensitive to changes in the distribution of hydrophobic and hydrophilic surface areas in
the PDB.

Materials and Methods
Protein structures
In this study, many experimentally determined native structures of proteins are used to
study the mechanism triggering docking of SARS-CoV-2 variants to ACE2 and the
antibodies. All the three-dimensional (3D) structure data of protein molecules are
resourced from the PDB database, including the experimentally determined the RBD of
SARS-CoV-2 S, ACE2, antibodies and their complexes, et al. IDs of these proteins
according to PDB database are marked in all the figures. In order to show the distribution
of hydrophobic areas on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, ACE2, antibodies and
their complexes at the binding sites in these figures, we used the structural biology
visualization software PyMOL to display the protein hydrophobic surface areas.
Calculation of hydrophobic or hydrophilic surface area
Affinity of RBD and ACE2 and antibodies can be characterized by calculating the size of
the hydrophobic contact area in the complex structures. We used molecular 3D structure
display software PyMOL to draw the hydrophobic and hydrophilic surface areas at the
docking sites. We calculated the hydrophobic attraction surface areas and hydrophobic
repulsion surface areas in the positions of mutations involved in the hydrophobic
interaction among the RBD, ACE2 and antibodies in this study.
