Critical data analysis of COVID-19 spreading in Indonesia to
measure the readiness of new-normal policy
Abstract
COVID-19 pandemic has become a global issue nowadays. Various efforts have been made to break
the chain of the spread of the COVID-19. Indonesia's government issued a large-scale social
restrictions policy to prevent the spread of the COVID-19. However, large-scale social restrictions
policy impacted the economy of the Indonesian. After several considerations, the Indonesian
government implemented a new-normal policy, which regulates the activities outside the home with
strict health protocols. This study's objective is to measure Indonesia's readiness level after the largescale social restrictions period towards the new-normal period. To specify the readiness level, the
measurement parameters required in the form of statistical analysis and forecasting modeling. Based
on the results of statistical analysis and forecasting, over the past month, new confirmed cases
increased more than two times. Besides, the growth rate of new confirmed cases dramatically
increased rapidly compared to the prediction results. Therefore, the government must review the
new-normal policy again and emphasize economic factors and think about health factors.

Introduction
Coronavirus is a family of viruses with a spiky crown of glycoproteins on its surface [1]. The novel
coronavirus, also known as COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV, is a contagious respiratory virus reported in
Wuhan, China. On February 12th, 2020, the world health organization (WHO) designated the name
was the coronavirus for the disease caused by the novel coronavirus as SARS-CoV-2 [2]. WHO has
declared that COVID-19 is an essential international issue [3]. The COVID-19 pandemic spread to
various parts of the world. Based on data obtained from John Hopkins University [4] as of June 5,
2020, the confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the World were 7,487,676, and the number of death cases
was 420,236. Breaking the chain of the spread of this pandemic must be done seriously by each
country.
Indonesia is also trying to break the COVID-19 spreading chain. Some countries use different
methods to inhibit the spreading of COVID-19. Indonesia's government policy to inhibit the
spreading of COVID-19, known as large-scale social restrictions, is a policy to reduce the spreading
of the COVID-19 in Indonesia [5]. The large-scale social restriction has already become government
policy based on some considerations [6]. Under government regulation number 21 of 2020,
concerning large-scale social restrictions in the framework of accelerating the countermeasure of
COVID-19 spreading [7]. The large-scale social restrictions aims are to anticipating and reducing the
number of COVID-19 cases in Indonesia that carried out in all regions in Indonesia. The large-scale
social restriction is to limit people's activities outside the house. These social restrictions are useful
for suppressing the increase in new confirmed cases in Indonesia.
After about two months undergoing large-scale social restrictions, the Indonesian government
issued a new-normal policy. The new-normal policy adopted by the Indonesian government is the
result of the process of people adaptation during the COVID-19 pandemic [7]. The new-normal
policy expected to be able to restore the economy, which has profoundly declined when large-scale
social restrictions implemented. Although the new-normal policy carried out, vigilance against
COVID-19 still needs to be done, such as the application of health protocols in the companies. The
intended health protocol forced to maintain personal hygiene and the work environment, i.e., using
masks, washing hands, and implementing physical distancing in every activity. The readiness of the

[

Indonesian government to implement new-normal life needs to be measured. The redesign of this
new-normal life is needed so that this policy lasts [8].
The measurement of Indonesia's readiness to implement a new-normal policy after the large-scale
social restrictions period is needed. Therefore, further studies to measure the level of readiness is
needed. A statistical analysis study is needed to interpret the spreading of COVID-19 data [9].
Another study is to predict the spreading of COVID-19 in the future by using the forecasting model.
Thus, this study's objective is to measure Indonesia's readiness level after the large-scale social
restrictions period towards the new-normal period. To specify the level of readiness, the
measurement parameters are needed in statistical analysis and forecasting modeling. Therefore, this
study conducted statistical analysis techniques and forecasting modeling to observe the trends of the
spreading of COVID-19 after the large-scale social restrictions period. This study's expected results
can provide insight, especially to the Indonesian government, to take the future policy to
countermeasure the spreading of COVID-19 in Indonesia.
Related Works
The COVID-19 issue hotly discussed, in both the medical and non-medical fields. COVID-19
countermeasures require a comprehensive study from various perspectives of knowledge and not
only from medical knowledge. Various studies are currently being carried out by researchers from
various scientific fields around the world.
A forecasting study of the COVID-19 outbreak conducted by [10] predicts the average total
cumulative case count in Hubei by February 24, 2020, using susceptible-infectious-recovered-dead
(SIDR) model. A study from [11] used phenomenological models that have been validated during
previous outbreaks to generate and assess short-term forecasts of the cumulative number of
confirmed reported cases in Hubei province. The research about modeling simulation in Indonesia
conducted by [12] using Richard's Curve that represents a modified logistic equation. Research
conducted by [13] regarding the forecasting of COVID-19 transmission and healthcare capacity in
Bali, Indonesia. The forecast provided an understanding of the effectiveness of current intervention
strategies and responses to case handlers. The COVID-19 data is a time-series data set that extracted
to observe the spreading [14]. Therefore, a procedure for forecasting time series data is needed. A
study conducted by [15] used the Facebook prophet model to forecast COVID-19. Research in 2020
by [16] using the Logistic and Facebook Prophet models to forecast COVID-19 data trends from
global cases and several countries as samples. The Indonesian state is one of the forecasting samples,
but it has not explicitly explained the phenomenon and the implementation of government policy in
the COVID-19 case in Indonesia.
Indonesia's government policy regarding the countermeasure of COVID-19 was also examined
by [6]. The study results showed that Indonesia has quite a significant concern for the COVID-19
phenomenon. Thus, government policy in implementing large-scale social restrictions needed as an
effort to deal with the spreading of the COVID-19. On the contrary, large-scale social restriction
policies in Indonesia prevented people from working outside the home. One of the impacts of largescale social restrictions on Indonesian was the termination of employment. The study conducted by
[17] shown that COVID-19 impacted the increasing poverty rate in Indonesia. To reduce the poverty
rate in Indonesia because of COVID-19, the government issued a new-normal policy to do activities
outside the home with strict health protocols. The new-normal policy with mitigation actions aimed
to reduce or minimize the impact of COVID-19 in Indonesia, but the people can still work outside
the home [7]. The steps taken by Indonesia's government in implementing new-normal were to
maintain economic growth and financial stability [18]. Thus, some economic activity in Indonesia can
still be carried out even with strict and massive restrictions.
Methodology
The study conducted comprehensively to obtain information that can provide insight. Therefore,

[

a methodology was needed to obtain and analyze COVID-19 data illustrated by a block diagram
presented in Figure 1.

Figure 1. Methodology block diagram
The first step carried out in this study is data acquisition. Data acquisition conducted to obtain
data on the spreading of COVID-19 in Indonesia. After all the data acquisition processes have been
carried out and the COVID-19 data distribution CSV file obtained, the next process is data analysis.
In addition to data analysis, forecasting using Facebook Prophet also carried out to project the
spreading of COVID-19. Based on data analysis and forecasting, critical analysis carried out to
measure government readiness in implementing new-normal policy.
Data
The study was based on the COVID-19 data provided by Johns Hopkins University [4]. The data
obtained from Johns Hopkins University extracted to obtain the spreading of COVID-19 data in
Indonesia. The data obtained includes (1) date, (2) number of confirmed cases; (3) number of deaths;
and (4) number of recovery. The data used in this study limited from March 2, 2020, to June 5, 2020.
The limitation of the data used is because the first confirmed case of COVID-19 that occurred in
Indonesia on March 2, 2020 [19] and most regions in Indonesia ended large-scale social restrictions
period on June 5, 2020.
Methods
Statistical analysis is an essential component of all medical informatics research to uncovering
patterns and trends of some phenomena. The use of descriptive and inferential methods enables
researchers to summarize findings and conduct hypothesis testing [20]. Thus, several statistical
analyses carried out to gain insight and trends from the spreading of COVID-19 data in Indonesia.
The first statistical analysis that discussed is the calculation of the number of confirmed cases (N
confirmed), recovered cases (N recovered), and death cases (N death) from COVID-19 patients in
Indonesia. The subsequent analysis is the calculation of the number of active cases and closed cases.
The number of active cases is the number of confirmed cases reduced by the number of other cases
and can be formulated in equation 1.
𝐴𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 𝑐𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑠 = 𝑁 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑓𝑖𝑟𝑚𝑒𝑑 − 𝑁 𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑑 − 𝑁 𝑑𝑒𝑎𝑡ℎ

(1)

An increase in the number of active cases is an indication of recovered cases or death cases
number is decreasing compared to the number of confirmed cases increasing drastically. Conversely,

[

if the number of an active case decreases, it indicates that recovered, and death cases are increasing,
and fewer new confirmed cases. On the other hand, the number of closed cases represents the total
number of recovered and death cases. The number of closed cases can be formulated in equation 2.
𝐶𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑒𝑑 𝑐𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑠 = 𝑁 𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑑 + 𝑁 𝑑𝑒𝑎𝑡ℎ

(2)

The increase in the number of closed cases implies that more patients are getting recovered or
died. The next statistical analysis parameters are the mortality rate and recovery rate that formulated
with equations 3 and 4.
𝑁 𝑑𝑒𝑎𝑡ℎ
× 100
𝑁 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑓𝑖𝑟𝑚𝑒𝑑
𝑁 𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑑
𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑦 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒 =
× 100
𝑁 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑓𝑖𝑟𝑚𝑒𝑑

𝑀𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒 =

(3)
(4)

The mortality rate shows a measure of the frequency of occurrence of death in a defined
population during a specified interval [21]. The lower in the mortality rate indicates the better
COVID-19 countermeasures. The opposite of the mortality rate is the recovery rate that shows a
measure of the frequency of patients' recovery in a defined population during a specified interval [21].
Because COVID-19 data is a time-series data [14], this study used the Facebook prophet model
that is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear
trends are fit with daily seasonality and holiday effects [15]. The Facebook prophet model works best
with time-series data, with strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data. It is also
robust to missing data and shifts in the trend. For the average method, the forecasts of all future
values are equal to the average or mean historical data. Let y1 denote the historical data, . . . , 𝑦𝑇, and
the prophet forecast can be formulated with equation 5.
(𝑦1 + 𝑦2 + . . . + 𝑦𝑇 )
(5)
𝑇
𝑦̂𝑇 + ℎ|𝑇 is a short-hand for the estimated value of 𝑦𝑇 + ℎ based on the historical data 𝑦1, . . . , 𝑦𝑇.
𝑦̂𝑇 + ℎ|𝑇 = 𝑦̅ =

A prediction interval gives an interval within expected 𝑦𝑡 to lie with a specified probability. Assuming
that the forecast errors normally distributed, a 95% prediction interval for the ℎ-step forecast can
formulate with equation 6.
𝑦̂𝑇 + ℎ|𝑇 ± 1.96 𝜎̂ℎ

(6)

where 𝜎̂ℎ is the estimate of the standard deviation of the ℎ-step forecast distribution.
Statistical Analysis and Forecasting Modelling
The statistical analysis was made by using python 3.7 programming language. As explained in the
method sub-section, this study utilized forecasting models adapted to overcome the complexity of
COVID-19 time series data. The forecasting modeling also carried out using libraries available in
python. The statistical analysis and forecasting results presented in the results section.
Results and Discussion
As discussed in the previous section, this study using statistical analysis and forecasting modeling
to gain insight into the future trends of the spreading of COVID-19. The statistical analysis and
forecasting modeling of the spreading of COVID-19 in Indonesia presented in the following subsections.
Statistical Analysis
The statistical analysis aims to identify the trends in the spreading of COVID-19. The statistical
analysis carried out on the spreading of COVID-19 data in Indonesia from March 2, 2020, until June
5, 2020. Based on the analysis that has been done, the data obtained as shown in Table 1

Based on Table 1, the total confirmed, recovered, and death cases from June 5, 2020, were 29,521,
9,443, and 1,770, respectively. The number of active and closed cases was 18,308 (62%) and 11,213
(38%). Based on closed cases, it can imply that the overall recovered and mortality rates were 84%
and 16%, respectively. The approximate number of confirmed, recovered, and death cases per day
imply that there was an average of 308 new confirmed, 98 recovered, and 18 death cases every day.
The approximate number of confirmed, recovered, and death cases per hour imply that there was an
average of 13 new confirmed, four recovered, and one death cases every hour. The average and
median mortality rates were 6.6994 and 7.3105, respectively. Otherwise, the average and median of
recovery rate were 6.6994 and 7.3105, respectively.
Analysis of COVID-19 spreading data distribution performed to show all of the cases (confirmed,
recovered, and death) day-to-day. The distribution plot of COVID-19 in Indonesia presented in
Figure 2. The analysis of data distribution can be used to analyze the growth of all COVID-19 cases
in Indonesia. The growth of different types of cases in Indonesia presented in Figure 3. The number
of weekly increases cases COVID-19 is required to analyze the growth trend in the number of new
cases of COVID-19. The weekly increase in the number of confirmed cases and death cases presented
in Figure 4. Two parameters that are indicators of the success or failure of COVID-19
countermeasure are recovery and death rate. The higher recovery rate and lower mortality rate are
indicators of success in overcoming COVID-19, and so otherwise. The recovery rate and mortality

Figures 2 and 3 describe the distribution and growth of the number of confirmed, recovery, and
death cases. The number of confirmed cases, growth, recovery, and death will increase from time to
time. Based on Figure 4a, the number of confirmed cases increases from week to week. The highest
increase in the number of new confirmed cases occurred in the 12th week. The number of new
confirmed cases has decreased from the 12th week to the 14th week. Thus, it can be concluded that
there is an impact of large-scale social restrictions on the growth of new confirmed cases. Based on
Figure 4b, the death number each week has fluctuated during the time, where the peak occurred in
the 13th week. However, in the 14th week, the number of death cases has decreased, which is a good
sign. Based on Figure 5, the mortality rate before the implementation of the new-normal policy
showed a considerable drop for a pretty long time, which is a positive sign. The recovery rate has
started to pick up again, which is a good sign, another supportive reason why the number of closed
cases is increasing.
Forecasting
This study performed prediction based on COVID-19 confirmed cases in Indonesia during the
first confirmed case (March 2, 2020) until the implementation of the new-normal policy (June 5,
2020). Facebook prophet model handles missing data and outliers of the trend [22]. Facebook
prophet model also used as a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model
where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality [15]. Thus, using the
Facebook prophet modeled COVID-19 confirmed cases in Indonesia. Figure 5a shows an increasing

2020, until July 5, 2020. Besides, a comparison between the prediction results and the actual
confirmed cases performed, as described in Table 2. Moreover, a plot presented the predicted and

Figure 7. Comparison of predicted and actual confirmed cases related to the implementation of the
new-normal policy
Based on the statistical analysis results, the total confirmed cases up to June 5, 2020, were 29,521.
Compared to actual confirmed cases in Table 2, the confirmed cases up to July 5, 2020, increased
into 64,958. It implies that over the past month, new confirmed cases increased by more than two
times. Based on Figure 7, the growth rate of new confirmed cases dramatically increased rapidly
compared to the prediction results. It indicates the bad sign related to the implementation of the newnormal policy.
Critical Analysis
Two months after the implementation of the large-scale social restrictions, the Government of
Indonesia is now preparing to roll back sluggish Indonesia's economy due to the implementation of
the large-scale social restrictions. Indonesia's government aims to adapt new-normal policy is to move
up the people's economy alongside the COVID-19 pandemic. Many researchers consider that newnormal policies have positive and negative impacts. The enactment of this policy can make people
vulnerable to contracting COVID-19. However, if this policy did not implement, it can force people
to stay at home, which will have a massive economic impact. After going through several
considerations, the government implemented a new-normal policy.
Unfortunately, right after the adaptation of new-normal policy in several regions, the daily
confirmed cases were increased dramatically. It reinforced by the increase in the number of new
confirmed cases by more than two times. The growth rate of new confirmed cases also dramatically
increased rapidly compared to the prediction results over the past month. It indicates the bad sign
related to the implementation of the new-normal policy. Therefore, the government must review the
new-normal policy again, in addition to emphasizing economic factors must also think about health
factors.
To suppress the growth rate of new confirmed cases, the government must be assertive in

[

implementing new-normal policies. The government also must carry out massive socialization
towards the adaptation of new-normal policy. Besides, people also should be aware of complying
with health protocols that have been made by the government. The majority of new confirmed cases
were occurring due to people's negligence in complying with the policy. Hence, people must also be
actively involved in breaking the chain of COVID-19 spreading in Indonesia by complying with the
health protocol. Lastly, if the new-normal wants to be successful in carrying out new-normalcy, all
stakeholders and the public must be disciplined in carrying out the health protocols and rules that
have been made.
Conclusions and Future Works
The COVID-19 pandemic spread to various parts of the world, including Indonesia. The various
strategies had been implemented to prevent the spreading of the coronavirus. Indonesia's
government policy/strategy to inhibit the spreading of COVID-19, known as large-scale social
restrictions, is a policy to reduce the spreading of the COVID-19 in Indonesia. After the large-scale
social restrictions, the government policy was implemented in the new-normal period. As long as the
new normal period, the government gave the instructions to citizens for implementing the health
protocol in every environment, including in-office and market place. The parameters for the success
or failure of COVID-19 countermeasures are recovery and death rate. The recovery rate and mortality
rate of COVID-19's patients in Indonesia, before the implementation of the new-normal policy, was
showing a considerable dropping for a pretty long time, which is a positive sign. This study aimed to
assess Indonesia’s readiness level towards the new-normal period. The readiness level that can be
assessed by using the Covid-19 data extracted.
The Facebook prophet model works best with time-series data. It is also compelling for data loss
and trend shifts, so using this method is the right step. After the Facebook prophet forecasting
method was conducted for one month from 6 June 2020, until 5 July 2020, the growth rate of new
confirmed cases dramatically increased rapidly compared to the predicted results. The growth rate
shows a lousy sign related to the implementation of new-normal policies. However, the government
continues to implement new-normal policies after going through various considerations, one of
which is the economic impact. Based on the results of statistical analysis and forecasting, over the
past month, new confirmed cases increased more than two times. Most of the confirmed new cases
occur due to people's negligence in complying with the policy.
This study has several limitations which open up directions for future research. Firstly, The data
used in this study is static data for each province in Indonesia. Future research can use the dynamic
data confirmed cases of COVID-19, so the value of the resulting forecasting more up to date.
Secondly, this study mainly concentrates on measure Indonesia's level of readiness after the largescale social restrictions period towards the new normal period. Future studies can conduct forecasting
analysis related to the economy of each province affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The results
of the forecast can be used to explore aspects that need to be improved or avoided to mitigate the
economic downturn in the next few years due to the case of COVID-19. Thirdly, Future studies can
use forecasting methods in addition to using the Facebook prophet and comparing the accuracy of
the values generated.
