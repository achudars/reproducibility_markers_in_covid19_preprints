Abstract
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infectivity is a major concern in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prevention and economic reopening. However, rigorous determination
of SARS-COV-2 infectivity is essentially impossible owing to its continuous evolution with over 13752
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) variants in six different subtypes. We develop an advanced machine learning algorithm based on the algebraic topology to quantitatively evaluate the binding affinity
changes of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S protein) and host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)
receptor following the mutations. Based on mutation-induced binding affinity changes, we reveal that
five out of six SARS-CoV-2 subtypes have become either moderately or slightly more infectious, while
one subtype has weakened its infectivity. We find that SARS-CoV-2 is slightly more infectious than
SARS-CoV according to computed S protein-ACE2 binding affinity changes. Based on a systematic
evaluation of all possible 3686 future mutations on the S protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), we
show that most likely future mutations will make SARS-CoV-2 more infectious. Combining sequence
alignment, probability analysis, and binding affinity calculation, we predict that a few residues on the
receptor-binding motif (RBM), i.e., 452, 489, 500, 501, and 505, have very high chances to mutate into
significantly more infectious COVID-19 strains.

Key words: Viral infectivity, mutation, protein-protein interaction, binding affinity change, persistent homology, deep learning.

Introduction

In December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was initially
detected in Wuhan, China [8], due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It
has now spread globally via travelers and breached the boundaries of 213 countries and territories, leading
to more than 5.4 million infection cases and 343,000 deaths as of May 23, 2020. In the past two decades,
there have been three major zoonotic disease outbreaks of betacoronaviruses: SARS-CoV in 2002, Middle
East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, and SARS-CoV-2 in 2019. Similar to SARSCoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 infections were observed in hospital personnel and family clusters in the
early stages of the outbreak [2,5,16]. Unfortunately, there is no specific antivirus drugs nor effective vaccines
developed to moderate this outbreak at present.
SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped non-segmented positive-sense RNA virus and belongs to the betacoronavirus genus. Although the origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains elusive, it has undergone thousands of recorded
single mutations compared to the reference genome collected on January 5, 2020 [29, 31]. Because of the
lack of proofreading ability in RNA polymerases, RNA viruses are prone to random mutations. Human
immune system intervention introduces viral mutations too. However, rapid global spread and transmission
of COVID-19 provide the virus with substantial opportunities for the natural selection of rare-acted but
favorable mutations. Therefore, although some viral mutations are benign, many mutations strengthen viral
survival capability. It is of paramount importance to understand SARS-CoV-2 infectivity changes following
the existing mutations and predict the future infection tendency.
1

It is well known that like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells through the interaction of spike
glycoprotein (S protein) and host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor [6, 14, 27]. In both
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the S protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) is recognized as one of two
subunits, i.e., S1 and S2, to bind directly to the ACE2. Although the SARS-CoV-2 S protein harbors a
furin cleavage site at the boundary between the S1/S2 subunits [31], lessons learned from SARS-CoV are
important in formulating hypotheses about SARS-CoV-2, as well as the receptor recognition when studying
the host range, cross-species transmission, and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. In the studies of SARS-CoV,
epidemiologic and biochemical studies show that the infectivity of different SARS-CoV strains in host cells
is proportional to the binding affinity between the RBD of each strain and the ACE2 expressed by the host
cell [6, 15, 19, 26, 27]. Therefore, the assessment of binding affinity changes following mutations is vital for
the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity evolution.
It is very challenging to rigorously measure the relative viral infectivity of two viruses by experiments.
There is a discrepancy in the literature about the relative S protein-ACE2 binding affinities of SARS-CoV
and SARS-CoV-2. Wrapp et al and Shang et al reported that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher binding affinity than
SARS-CoV does [22, 30], whereas Walls et al argued that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV bind with similar
affinities to ACE2. [27]
The first SARS-CoV-2 genome reported on January 5, 2020 [31] has about 80% sequence identity with
that of SARS-CoV. However, compared with SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 S protein has 301 mutations over its
1255 residues. Their sequence identity is only 76%. Among 301 mutations on SARS-CoV-2 S protein, 50
were on the RBD, which has a total of 194 residues, suggesting that the RBD is subject to more mutations.
Our recent studies using over 13,000 genome samples show that SARS-CoV-2 S protein is among the most
non-conservative ones in its genome [29]. Since early January 2020, hundreds of new mutations were found
on different residue positions of SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Many of them are located on the RBD [29]. The
existence of so many different S protein mutations indicates that there are many different SARS-CoV-2
subtypes that might have very different infectivities. Obviously, the relatively high mutation rate at the
RBD poses a real threat to the occurrence of future SARS-CoV-2 strains that might be more infectious than
the current SARS-CoV-2.
Due to the continuous evolution of SARS-CoV-2, the experimental measurement of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity is extremely difficult if it is not entirely impossible. The computational estimation of mutation-induced
protein-protein binding affinity changes is an important approach for understanding the impact of mutations
on protein-protein interactions (PPIs). There are many standard databases available, including the AB-Bind
database of mutation-induced antibody-antigen complex binding free energy changes [25] and SKEMPI for
protein-protein binding affinity changes upon mutation (∆∆G) [17]. These databases have been used as
a benchmark for evaluating the predictive power of various computational methods [18, 21]. To simplify
the structural complexity of protein-protein complexes, we have recently introduced element-specific and
site-specific persistent homology, a new branch of algebraic topology, to embed molecular mechanisms into
topological invariants [28]. This approach is paired with a new deep learning algorithm called NetTree, to
combined convolutional neural networks and gradient boosting trees. The resulting method, called TopNetTree, was about 22% better than the previous best result for the AB-Bind dataset and significantly
outperformed the state-of-the-art in the literature on the SKEMPI database [28].
The objective of this work is three-fold. First, we train the TopNetTree on a set of 8338 PPI data to
analyze the impacts of existing S protein RBD mutations on the binding affinity of the S protein and the
ACE2. Since different SARS-CoV-2 subtypes have different mutation patterns, it is important to understand
their mutation impacts accordingly. We carry our analysis based on existing six mutation clusters [29],
though more specific analysis can be easily done as well. Additionally, it is also extremely important to
know whether future SARS-CoV-2 subtypes would pose an imminent danger to public health. To this end,
we have conducted a systematic screening of all possible 3,686 future mutations on all 194 residues (residue

2

IDs from 333 to 526 on S protein) on the RBD. We classify these mutations into three categories: the most
likely ones which would happen by a single mutation at any one of three constitutive nucleotides; the likely
mutations which would occur via two concurrent mutations at three constitutive nucleotides; and the unlikely
mutations which would produce through three concurrent mutations at all of three constitutive nucleotides.
Finally, we analyze how 50 mutations on the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein with respect to SARS-CoV
have changed its infectivity.

Impacts of existing RBD mutations
Global analysis

To investigate the influences of existing S protein RBD mutations on binding affinity (BA) of S protein
and ACE2, the 13752 complete SARS-CoV-2 genome samples deposited at GISAID [23] are compared with
the first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 collected on January 5, 2020 [31]. The resulting 7525 single
mutations are found in six distinct clusters as shown in Table 1 [29] and Figure 1. There are 434 existing
non-degenerated mutations on SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Among them, 55 mutations occurred on the RBD
which are relevant to the binding of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and ACE2. Furthermore, 28 out of 55 mutations
are on the receptor-binding motif (RBM), i.e., the region of RBD that is in direct contact with the ACE2.
We examine the free energy changes following the existing site-specific mutations. Our studies are based
on the X-ray crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and ACE2 (PDB 6M0J) [11] (see Fig. 19), whose
S protein gene sequence is consistent with that of the reference SARS-CoV-2 [31]. The BA change following
mutation (∆∆G) is defined as the subtraction of the BA of the mutant from the BA of wild type, ∆∆G =
∆GW − ∆GM where ∆GW is BA of the wild type and ∆GM is BA of mutant type. Therefore, a positive
BA change means that the mutation increases affinities, making the mutant more stable and more infective.
We present the overall BA changes ∆∆G of SARS-CoV-2 S protein RBD in Figure 2. Most mutations
have a small number of changes in their binding affinities, while some of them have large changes. There are
56% mutations on RBD having positive BA changes (i.e., 31 over 55) including V367F and V483A, which
have the most frequencies, 13 and 23 respectively. This statistic implies that the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is
mostly driven by selection and COVID-19 evolves toward more infectious. It is noted that many mutations
on the RBM, such as N439K, L452R, and T478I, have significant free energy changes. The mutations on
the RBM take 51% (28 over 55) of all mutations on the RBD, which potentially increases the complexity of
antiviral drug and vaccine development. This global analysis indicates that mutations on RBD strengthen

the binding of S protein and ACE2, leading to more infectious SARS-CoV-2.
The SARS-CoV-2 genotypes are clustered into six clusters or subtypes based on their single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) variants [29]. Accordingly, a more detailed analysis of mutation impacts on the BA
changes can be carried out on each cluster, which reveals the diversity of COVID-19 infection rates and
provides evidence for transmission pathways and spread dynamics across the world.
It is worth noting that residue 414 has three mutations, Q414P, Q414E, and Q414R, due to mutations at
two adjacent nucleotides 22802 and 22803: 22803A>C, Q414P; 22802C>G, Q414E; and 22803A>G, Q414R.
At the protein level, some or all of these mutations show up in different clusters. Similarly, residues 354 and
521 have two existing mutations.
2.1.2

Cluster I analysis

Figure 3 depicts the binding affinity changes ∆∆G of Cluster I. Four out of sixth mutations have positive
binding affinity changes which indicate increasing infectivity on Cluster 1. Particularly, mutation N439K,
which has a higher frequency and a larger free energy amplitude than the rest, attained a very positive
binding affinity change to increase the affinity between S protein and ACE2. Therefore, Cluster I has a
moderate increase in its infectivity. Cluster I is associated with COVID-19 in most countries except for
Japan and South Korea [29].
2.1.3

Cluster II analysis

Figure 4 illustrates the binding affinity changes following the mutations of Cluster II. As shown in the figure,
there are many mutations on the RBD. However, most mutations are associated with small free energy
changes. When only considering the absolute value of BA change greater than 0.5 kcal/mol, five mutations
have positive BA changes whereas two mutations have negative BA changes. The mutation D364Y has
the highest frequency and the highest free energy change, indicating the increase in infectivity. Therefore,
Cluster II has a minor increase in infectivity. Note that Cluster II COVID-19 is found in every country that
has submitted SARS-CoV-2 genome samples.

Cluster III analysis

From Figure 5, a significant decreasing trend of affinity is observed such that the largest change is also the
most frequent mutation with a negative BA change while the rest of the mutation-induced BA changes are
negligible. Interestingly, the mutation T478I changes from amino acid with polar uncharged side chains,
Threonine, to amino acids with hydrophobic side chains, Isoleucine, which significantly decreases affinity
between the S protein and the ACE2 receptor. Another observation is that mutations that happened in
the same residues have close changes such as P384L and P384S, S477R and S477N, or Q414P and Q414R.
Cluster III is only one which has a decreasing trend of binding affinities as SARS-CoV-2 evolving from this
cluster. This cluster involves genome samples from all countries except for South Korea. Notably, most
samples are submitted by the UK.
2.1.5

Cluster IV analysis

Figure 6 shows the binding affinity changes of mutations in Cluster IV. Among all mutations in Cluster
4, mutation L452R has the largest free energy change and directly connects the ACE2 receptor. Although
the most frequent mutation Q414E has a negative change, the BA change ∆∆G is -0.055 kcal/mol which is
negligible compared with others. The overall trend of this cluster is considered as increasing the COVID-19
infectibility. Note that most genome samples in Cluster IV are submitted by the US.
2.1.6

Cluster V analysis

Figure 7 presents the binding affinity changes in the fifth cluster. Five of seven mutations have positive free
energy changes. Considering the magnitude of the BA change range is within 0.60 kcal/mol, this cluster has
a very minor increase in infectivity. Most samples in this cluster were submitted by the US.

Cluster VI analysis

The binding affinity changes in the last cluster is shown in Figure 8. Obviously, most mutations on Cluster
VI have enhanced the binding affinity of the S protein and ACE2 receptor except T478I. The most significant

positive free energy change is caused by mutation K417N. Overall, Cluster VI has strengthened infectivity.
This cluster involves genome samples submitted from all countries except for Japan and South Korea. The
US submitted most samples. Cluster VI is a new cluster of SARS-CoV-2 according to its low frequency of
each mutation.
In summary, five of six clusters, Clusters I, II, IV, V, and VI, have moderate or minor positive binding
affinity changes which indicate that the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 trend to increase infectability by
increasing its binding affinity with ACE2 receptor. One cluster, Cluster III, reduced its binding affinity,
indicating a decrease in its infectivity.

2.2

Impacts of most likely future RBD mutations

In this section and the next section, we analyze the impacts of all of 3686 possible mutations on 194 S
protein RBD of 194 residues. On each amino acid, we classify all 19 possible mutations into most likely
future mutations, likely future mutations, and unlikely future mutations. Here, most likely, likely, and
unlikely future mutations are defined by the protein mutations induced by only one, simultaneous two, and
simultaneous three of genetic changes on three underlying nucleotides on a codon. Based on the codon
analysis of all 194 amino acid residues on the RBD, we have 1149 most likely, 1912 likely, and 625 unlikely
mutations.
We compute the ∆∆Gs following most likely future mutations on the RBD. Figure 9 depicts 20 most
likely future mutations that can have the highest adversarial impacts on COVID-19 infectivity. First, it is
noted that mutation Y495N on the RBM has the highest free energy change and if it occurs, it will make
the virus significantly more infectious. Additionally, mutation Y489H on the RBM would incur another
large infectivity strengthening. It is worthy to note that residue 489 is a potentially hot spot, where 5
possible mutations, Y489H, Y489D, Y489F, Y489C, and Y489N, will lead to the strengthened S protein-ACE2
binding. The other potentially hot spot is residue 423 with Y423C, Y423F, and Y423S being infectivitystrengthening mutations. Residue 452 on the RBM has been proven to hot spot as it has an existing mutation
L452R (see Fig. 6) and another infectivity strengthening mutation, L452P. In general, the highest free energy
changes are due to mutations on the RBM. However, mutations away from the RBM can have a considerable
impact on the infectivity as well.
The above analysis considers only BA strengthening mutations. To have a global view of how future

mutations would change the COVID-19 infectivity, we analyze the general trend of the free energy changes
of most likely mutations according to 400 possible mutation types. The ∆∆G values following mutations
on each amino acid are predicted and averaged by their mutation types. Figure 10 shows the average and
variance of ∆∆G (kcal/mol) of each mutation type for most likely mutations on the RBD. Here, y-axes
stand for wild type residues, and x-axes are mutant type residues. The colors on the axes are the residue
types, such as charged, polar uncharged, hydrophobic, and special cases. The colors in the heat maps
indicate the binding affinity changes strengths and directions. It is worthy to note that there are more
positive binding affinity changes (green cubes) than negative changes (pink cubes), showing a trend of more
infectious COVID19 strains due to most likely future mutations. For example, if a wild type mutation takes
place from wide type K, T, N, Q, L, F, or Y to any other residue type except for W, it will end up with a
more infectious COVID19 strain. However, mutations from R to T, or from A to many other residue types
might lead to a less infectious COVID-19. The large values on the variance map indicate where the above
average values might not be reliable. It is seen that the variances are general small. Figure 11 shows a
similar trend for the most likely mutations away from the RDM.

2.3

Impacts of likely and unlikely future RBD mutations

As discussed above, likely and unlikely future mutations require two and three concurrent nucleotide mutations on each codon to happen, respectively. Figure 12 presents the top 20 likely future mutations that will
strengthen the COVID-19 infectivity. The most energetic adversarial mutation is Y505G. Note that residue
505 has is a most likely mutation Y505H shown in Fig. 9. Therefore, residue 505 is a potentially hot spot on
the RBM. The next few energetic adversarial mutations are away from the RBM. Among them, N423P and
N422G are hot-spot mutations. Figure 9 shows that residue 423 has three most likely energetic mutations
while in Fig. 12, it has the other three likely energetic mutations. Similarly, residue 489 on the RBM has 5
most likely energetic mutations (see Fig. 9) and 4 likely energetic mutations as shown in Fig. 12. It is on our
top surveillance list for the next generation of infectious COVID-19 strains. Another potentially hot spot
is residue 495. Figure 13 shows the average and variance of ∆∆G (kcal/mol) of all likely mutations on the
RBM where values of most likely mutations and unlikely mutations are excluded. About the same amount
of mutations have positive and negative binding affinity changes. In Figure 14, similar results are shown for
the RBD excluding the RBM. Interestingly, mutations on the RBM have larger magnitude changes rather
than out of this region for second potential mutations. It again shows that the RBM is the most important
region to study.

Discussion
Conservation analysis via sequence alignment

To further understand the evolution trend and potential infectivity changes of the COVID-19, we carry out
S protein sequence alignment analysis to examine residue conservativeness. Figure 17 presents the alignment
analysis of SARS-CoV-2 S protein sequence and those of the other four closely related species, namely,
SARS-CoV, bat coronavirus RaTG13, bat coronavirus BM48-31, and bat coronavirus CoVZC45. We note
that among the residues we discussed in the last section, 414, 422, 423, 492, and 495 are very conservative.
They have not undergone any mutations among five related species. In contrast, RBM residues 452, 489,

Figure 18: Overall binding affinity changes ∆∆G on the S protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) from SARS-CoV to SARSCoV-2. The blue color region marks the binding affinity changes on the receptor-binding motif (RBM). The height of each bar
indicates the predicted ∆∆G. Residues are labeled according to PDB ID 3D0G [13].

500, 501, and 505 have a history of mutations and are non-conservative. Therefore, the predicted infectivitystrengthening mutations on these residues are more likely to happen.

3.2

Relative infectivity change analysis for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2

As mentioned earlier, there are inconsistent assessments about relative infectivity between SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2 in the literature [22, 27, 30]. Our validated computational method can be employed to resolve
this discrepancy. Based on the sequence alignment shown in Figure 17, we conduct binding affinity change
calculations for all relevant mutations on the SARS-CoV S protein RBD. Figure 18 illustrates the S proteinACE2 binding affinity changes following the mutations from SARS-CoV to SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV
S protein and ACE2 complex 3D0G [13] is used as the wide type in our predictions. It is interesting to
note that overall, there are more infectivity-strengthening mutations than infectivity-weakening mutations
on the RBD. This is particularly true for mutations on the RBM. This result indicates that the SARS-CoV-2
sample collected on January 5, 2020, [31] is slightly more infectious than SARS-CoV found in 2003 [12].
For a comparison between various SARS-CoV-2 subtypes and SARS-CoV of 2003, our results indicate
that SARS-CoV-2 Clusters, I, II, IV, V, and VI become more infectious than SARS-CoV whereas SARSCoV-2 Cluster III may have a similar infective rate with that of SARS-CoV.
Compared with SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 has four extra residues, PRRA from 681 to 684, as shown in
Figure 17. It is believed that these extra residues might change SARS-CoV-2’s behavior in ACE2 assisted
entry of host cells [27]. However, this speculation has no qualitative nor quantitative validation at present.

Material and methods
Sequences and structures

Amino acid sequences and mutant data of the S protein used in the analysis were obtained from NCBI
GenBank and GISAID [23]. After the first complete genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 released on NCBI
GenBank (Access number: NC 045512.2) [31], there has been a large number of genome sequences. Other

15

sequences from GenBank are as follows: bat coronavirus RaTG13 (MN996532.1) [32], bat coronavirus BM4831 (NC 014470.1) [3] and bat coronavirus CoVZC45 (MG772933.1) [7]. The mutant information of 13752
whole-genome sequences of S protein with high coverage of SARS-CoV-2 strains from the infected individuals
around the world was obtained from the GISAID database [23] (https://www.gisaid.org/). Data without
the exact submission date in GISAID were not considered.
Beta-CoV S protein structures were obtained from the RCSB Protein Data Bank: SARS-CoV RBD
with ACE2 (PDB 3D0G) [13] and SARS-CoV-2 RBD with ACE2 (PDB 6M0J) [11]. The structures were
presented by using PyMOL [20]. Sequences alignments were performed on SARS-CoV-2 S protein sequences
by using MAFFT v7.388 [10] and on SARS-CoV-2 genome by using the Clustal Omega multiple sequence
alignment with default parameters [24].

TopNetTree model for protein-protein interaction (PPI) binding affinity
changes upon mutation

The topology-based network tree (TopNetTree) is constructed by an innovative integration between the
topological representation and NetTree for predicting protein-protein interaction binding affinity changes
following mutation ∆∆G. In this work, TopNetTree is applied to predict the binding affinity changes of
mutations that happened on RBD with ACE2 of SARS-CoV-2 after January 5, 2020. As shown in Fig. 19,
topology-based feature generation is the first step followed by a convolutional neural network (CNN)-assisted
model. The topological representation uses element- and site-specific persistent homology to simplify the
structural complexity of protein-protein complexes and encode vital biological information into topological
invariants. NetTree is a recently developed deep learning algorithm that integrates the advantages of convolutional neural networks and gradient-boosting trees (GBT). In this section, we briefly describe the topology
representation for machine learning training and prediction. Details can be found in the literature [28].
4.2.1

Topology-based feature generation of PPIs

The topology-based feature generation is built upon from persistence homology starting with simplicial complex and filtration. As a type of algebraic topology, persistence homology studies simplicial complex on
discrete datasets under various settings. Among the many constructions, two that are widely used for point
clouds are the Vietoris-Rips (VR) complex and alpha complex [4] which are applied in our approach. Built
upon a simplicial complex, the topological invariants of a point-cloud dataset can be identified, such as
the set of atoms in protein-protein interactions. Meanwhile, topological invariants (separated components,
rings, and cavities) can be enumerated by counting the numbers referred to as Betti-0, Betti-1, and Betti-2,
respectively. Thus taxing and uninformative features or calculations are fully abandoned, whereas geometric
and topological characteristics persevere as data representation. Moreover, using persistent homology, the
original 3D point-cloud data are characterized by topological barcodes that record the “birth” and “death”
of each topological invariants and simplifying complicated structural representations of a PPI-complex. Although topology data presentation much simplifies the problem in many directions, better construction is
required for it to extract patterns of different biological or chemical aspects. Before talking about more
detailed feature generations, we first preset the constructions for a PPI complex into various subsets.
1. Am : atoms of the mutation sites.
2. Amn (r): atoms in the neighbourhood of the mutation site within a cut-off distance r.
3. AAb (r): antibody atoms within r of the binding site.
4. AAg (r): antigen atoms within r of the binding site.

5. Aele (E): atoms in the system that has atoms of element type E. The distance matrix is specially
designed such that it excludes the interactions between the atoms form the same set. For interactions
between atoms ai and aj in set A and/or set B, the modified distance is defined as
(
Dmod (ai , aj ) =

∞, if ai , aj ∈ A, or ai , aj ∈ B,

(1)

De (ai , aj ), if ai ∈ A and aj ∈ B,

where De (ai , aj ) is the Euclidian distance between ai and aj .
In algebraic topology, molecular atoms can be treated as points presented by v0 , v1 , v2 , ..., vk as k +1
affinely independent points. Simplicial complex, the essential building blocks, is a finite collection of sets of
points K = {σi }, and σi are called linear combinations of these points in Rn (n ≥ k). For instance, a 0-, 1-,
2-, or 3-simplex in geometry representation is a vertex, an edge, a triangle, or a tetrahedron, respectively. A
simplicial complex K is valied if a face τ of a k-simplex σi of K is also in K, such that τ ⊆ σi and σi ∈ K
imply τ ∈ K and the non-empty intersection of any two simplieces is a face for both. Given a simplicial
P
complex K, a k-chain is a finite formal sum of k-simplices; that is, i αi σik . The set of all k-chains of the
simplicial complex K equipped with an algebraic field (typically, Z2 ) forms an abelian group Ck (K, Z2 ),
which means the coefficients ai are chosen from Z2 . A boundary operator ∂k : Ck → Ck−1 for a k-simplex
Pk
σ k = {v0 , v1 , v2 , · · · , vk } are homomorphisms defined as ∂k σ k = i=0 (−1)i {v0 , v1 , · · · , vˆi , · · · , vk }, where
{v0 , v1 , · · · , vˆi , · · · , vk } is a (k − 1)-simplex excluding vi from the vertex set. Consequently, a important
property of boundary operator, ∂k−1 ∂k = ∅, follows from that boundaries are boundaryless. Moreover the
kth cycle group Zk = ker∂k = {c ∈ Ck | ∂k c = ∅} is deffined to be the kernel of ∂k , whose elements are called
k-cycles; and the kth boundary group is the image of ∂k+1 denoted as Bk = im ∂k+1 = {∂k+1 c | c ∈ Ck+1 }.
The algebraic construction to connect a sequence of complexes by boundary maps is called a chain complex

and the kth homology group is the quotient group defined by
Hk = Zk /Bk .

(2)

The key property of boundary operators implies Bk ⊆ Zk ⊆ Ck . The Betti numbers are defined by the ranks
of kth homology group Hk which counts k-dimensional holes, especially, β0 = rank(H0 ) reflects the number
of connected components, β1 = rank(H1 ) reflects the number of loops, and β2 = rank(H2 ) reveals the number
of voids or cavities. Together, the set of Betti numbers {β0 , β1 , β2 , · · · } indicates the intrinsic topological
property of a system.
Persistent homology is devised to track the multiscale topological information over different scales along
a filtration [4]. A filtration of a topology space K is a nested sequence of subspaces {K t }t=0,...,m of K
such that ∅ = K 0 ⊆ K 1 ⊆ K 2 ⊆ · · · ⊆ K m = K. Moreover, on this complex sequence, we obtain a
sequence of chain complexes by homomorphisms: C∗ (K 0 ) → C∗ (K 1 ) → · · · → C∗ (K m ) and a homology
sequence: H∗ (K 0 ) → H∗ (K 1 ) → · · · → H∗ (K m ), correspondingly. The p-persistent kth homology group of
T
K t is defined as Hkt,p = Zkt /(Bkt+p Zkt ), where Bkt+p = im∂k+1 (K t+p ). Intuitively, this homology group
records the homology classes of K t that are persistent at least until K t+p . Under the filtration process, the
persistent homology barcodes can be generated. Then the feature vectors can be constructed from these sets
of intervals for machine learning models.
In a variety of vectorization methods, one discretizes the filtration parameter interval into bins and
model the behavior of the barcodes in each bin [1]. To make use of advanced machine learning algorithms,
we subdivide a filtration interval into bins of length. Then the numbers of persistence intervals are counted
for each bin, such that birth events and death events can be represented. This approach gives us three feature
vectors for each topological barcode for the machine learning method. Note for different discretizations, the
18

characterization of birth and death might not be stable so that only Betti-0 (H0 ) barcodes obtained from the
VR filtration are applied in this approach. Intuitively, features generated by binned barcode vectorization can
reflect the strength of atom bonds, van der Waals interactions, and can be easily incorporated into a CNN,
which captures and discriminates local patterns. Another method of vectorization is to get the statistics
of bar lengths, birth values, and death values, such as sum, maximum, minimum, mean, and standard
derivation. This method is applied to vectorize Betti-1 (H1 ) and Betti-2 (H2 ) barcodes obtained from alpha
complex filtration based on the facts that higher-dimensional barcodes are sparser than H0 barcodes.
4.2.2

Machine learning models

Prediction of binding affinity changes following mutation for PPIs is very challenging due to the complex
dataset and 3D structures. A hybrid machine learning algorithm that integrates a CNN and GBT is designed
to overcome difficulties. Briefly speaking, partial topologically simplified descriptions, specifically vectorized
H0 barcode feature, are converted into concise features by the CNN module. Then a GBT module is trained
on the whole feature set for a robust predictor with effective control of overfitting.
TopGBT model. The gradient boosting tree (GBT) method produces a prediction model as an ensemble method which is a class of machine learning algorithms. It builds a powerful module for regression
and classification problems from weak learners. By the assumption that the individual learners are likely to
make different mistakes, the method using a summation of the weak learners to eliminate the overall error.
Furthermore, a decision tree is added to the ensemble depending on the current prediction error on the
training dataset. Thus this method (a topology-based GBT or TopGBT) is relatively robust against hyperparameter tuning and overfitting, especially for a moderate number of features. The GBT is shown for its
robustness against overfitting, good performance for moderately small data sizes, and model interpretability.
The current work uses the package provided by scikit-learn (v 0.23.0).
TopCNN model. CNN is a class of deep neural networks and is considered as the most successful
architectures. CNN is a regularized case of a multilayer connected neural network, such that each neuron
is connected locally to neurons in the next convolution layers and the weights are shared across different
locations. To prepare the integration of CNN and GBT, CNN is treated as an intermediate model that
converts vectorized H0 features into a higher-level abstract feature for the downstream model.
TopNetTree model. A supervised CNN model with the PPI ∆∆G as labels is trained for extracting
high-level features from H0 barcodes. Once the model is set up, the flatten layer neural outputs of CNN
are feed into a GBT model to rank their importance. Based on the importance, and ordered subset of
CNN-trained features is combined with features constructed from high-dimensional topological barcodes, H1
and H2 into the final GBT model as shown in Fig. 19. As for the parameters of the GBT model, 10 times
10-fold experiments are done for searching the optimal parameter setting.
4.2.3

Cross-validation of TopNetTree

The proposed TopNetTree method is trained on the SKEMPI 2.0 dataset [9], which has 4,169 variants in
319 different complexes. A set “S8338” with 8,338 variants was derived from SKEMPI 2.0 dataset by setting
the reverse mutation energy changes to the negative values of its original energy changes. To address the
reliability of the TopNetTree method, we did the tenfold cross-validation on the SKEMPI 2.0 dataset with
the averaged training accuracy, Pearson correlation coefficients Rp , Kendall’s τ , and the root mean square
error (RMSE), being 0.98, 0.89, and 0.37 kcal/mol. As shown in Table 2, these metrics are based on the
average of ten ten-fold cross-validations which indicate TopNetTree is well trained. The performance test of
tenfold cross-validation on dataset gives as Rp = 0.84, τ = 0.60, and RMSE = 1.06 kcal/mol, which is of the
same level of accuracy as the best in the literature [28].

Conclusion

The infectivity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a vital factor for
preventive measurements against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and reopening the global economy [22, 27, 30]. However, it is very challenging to rigorously determine the viral infectivity experimentally
and quantitatively compare the relative infectivity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. These challenges
are deteriorated by the continuous evolution of SARS-CoV-2 due to its existing 13752 SNP variants in six
distinct clusters [29]. In the present work, we develop an advanced TopNetTree method based on algebraic
topology and deep learning to predict the spike glycoprotein (S protein) and the host angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding affinity changes induced by mutations. Based on binding affinity changes, we
reveal that mutations have made five out of six clusters of SARS-CoV-2 more infectious than the original
virus found in Wuhan [31]. Additionally, based on sequence alignment and mutation-induced binding affinity
changes, we show that SARS-CoV-2 [31] is slightly more infectious than SARS-CoV found in 2003 [12]. Finally, we systematically compute the binding affinity changes of all possible 3686 future mutations to unveil
that the most likely mutations will further strengthen SARS-CoV infectivity. We predict that residues 452,
489, 500, 501, and 505 on the receptor-binding motif (RBM) have high chances to mutate into significantly
more infectious COVID-19 strains.
