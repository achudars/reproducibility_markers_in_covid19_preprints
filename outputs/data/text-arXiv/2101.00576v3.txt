Abstract
This paper uses new and recently introduced methodologies to study the similarity
in the dynamics and behaviours of cryptocurrencies and equities surrounding
the COVID-19 pandemic. We study two collections; 45 cryptocurrencies and
72 equities, both independently and in conjunction. First, we examine the
evolution of cryptocurrency and equity market dynamics, with a particular focus
on their change during the COVID-19 pandemic. We demonstrate markedly
more similar dynamics during times of crisis. Next, we apply recently introduced
methods to contrast trajectories, erratic behaviours, and extreme values among
the two multivariate time series. Finally, we introduce a new framework for
determining the persistence of market anomalies over time. Surprisingly, we
find that although cryptocurrencies exhibit stronger collective dynamics and
correlation in all market conditions, equities behave more similarly in their
trajectories and extremes, and show greater persistence in anomalies over time.

1. Introduction
Over the last several years there has been growing interest in the cryptocurrency market. The sector has experienced impressive growth in asset inflows and
its level of sophistication. More recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused
immense social and economic impacts, including changes in the behaviour of
financial markets. The goal of this paper is to analyze the evolution of cryptocurrencies and equities over time, and in particular, assess whether the increase in
interest from sophisticated investors has led to more uniformity in the dynamics
and behaviours of the two asset classes. We use the COVID-19 pandemic as a
motivating example to ascertain whether this similarity changes during market
crises.
The study of financial market correlation structure has been a topic of great
interest to the nonlinear dynamics community over the past several decades

[1, 2, 3]. Evolutionary market dynamics have been studied through a wide variety
of techniques such as clustering [4] and principal components analysis (PCA)
[2, 5, 6, 7]. Until the past decade, the primary asset classes of interest to the
research community were equities [7], fixed income [8], and foreign exchange [9].
More recently, select research has focused on the study of trajectory modelling
[10], extreme behaviours and structural breaks [11, 12] and these methods have
been applied to a variety of asset classes.
There is a current wave of interest from econophysics researchers in the
development and application of methods for understanding cryptocurrency
dynamics. Areas attracting interest from researchers include studies of Bitcoin’s
behaviour [13, 14, 15, 16, 17], fractal patterns, [18, 19, 20, 21], cross-correlation
and scaling effects [22, 23, 24, 25, 26]. Many of these studies are concerned with
the time-varying nature of such dynamics, or the behaviour of cryptocurrencies
during various market regimes. Quite naturally, the impact of COVID-19 on
cryptocurrency behaviours has been widely studied [27, 28, 29, 30]
The evolution of COVID-19 and its impact on financial markets has attracted
broad interest from various research communities. COVID-19’s spread and
containment measures have been studied by the epidemiology community [31,
32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39], while clinically-inclined research has detailed
new treatments for various COVID-19 strains [40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46]. The
pandemic’s varied impact on financial markets has also been studied [47, 48, 49],
with many papers exploring financial contagion and market stability [50, 51, 52].
In the nonlinear dynamics community, COVID-19 research has used new and
existing techniques to study the temporal evolution of cases and deaths [53, 54, 55,
56], with a substantial emphasis on SIR models [57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63], power
law models [64, 65, 66, 67] and the use of networks [68]. More recently there has
been work that explores the impact of COVID-19 cases on the performance of
country financial markets [10].
The goal of this paper is to explore the similarity in the dynamics and
behaviours of cryptocurrencies and equities over the past two years. In doing so,
we make several contributions. First, we complement current methods with the
introduction of a new measure between eigenspectra to study the similarity in two
time series’ evolutionary dynamics. Next, we apply recently developed techniques
to study the trajectories, extremes and erratic behaviour of cryptocurrencies
and equities, and analyze their similarity. Finally, we introduce a pithy method
to study the persistence of financial anomalies over time.
This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the data used in
this paper. Section 3 studies the time-varying dynamics of cryptocurrencies and
equities, and contrasts their behaviour during different market states. Sections
4, 5 and 6 study trajectories, erratic behaviour and extremes respectively. In
Section 7 we contrast the consistency in anomalies among our two collections.
In Section 8, we conclude.

2. Data
In the proceeding analysis, the two primary objects of study are cryptocurrency and equity multivariate time series between 03-12-2018 to 08-12-2020. We
analyze the 45 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalisation (excluding those
previously identified as anomalous) [11] and 72 global equities whose market
capitalisation is greater than US$100 billion. We report and contrast on the
dynamics, behaviours, and anomaly persistence between cryptocurrencies and
equities. In select sub-sections, we refer to the period 03-12-2018 to 28-022020 as Pre-COVID, 02-03-2020 to 29-05-2020 as Peak COVID, and 01-06-2020
to 08-12-2020 as Post-COVID. Cryptocurrency and equity data are sourced
from https://coinmarketcap.com/ and Bloomberg respectively. A full list of
cryptocurrencies and equities studied in this paper is available in Appendix B.
3. Market dynamics
3.1. Evolutionary dynamics
In this section we follow the framework introduced in [1] to study the temporal
evolution of correlation structure in cryptocurrencies and equities, and contrast
these collections’ evolutionary dynamics. Our analysis in this section differs from
[1] in several ways, however. First, rather than applying this framework to a single
collection of securities from different asset classes, we apply the time-evolving
model to two separate asset classes (cryptocurrencies and equities) and compare
the respective time-varying dynamics. Second, we use a shorter time window
to study correlation structures, allowing correlations to change more quickly to
varying market conditions. This allows us to study the impact of COVID-19
on both collections. Third, we introduce a new dynamics deviation measure
between surfaces to determine the similarity in two time-varying eigenspectra
across different time periods. Finally, we use daily data rather than weekly data.
Let ci (t) and ej (t) be the multivariate time series of cryptocurrency and
equity daily closing prices, for t = 1, ..., T , i = 1, ..., N , and j = 1, ..., K. We
generate two multivariate time series of log returns, Ric (t) and Rje (t), where
cryptocurrency and equity log returns are computed as follows

Ric (t) = log

We define standardized
cryptocurrency returns as R̂ic (t) = [Ric (t)−hRic i]/σ(Ric ),
p

where σ(Ri ) = h(Ri ) i − hRic i2 represents the standard deviation of cryptocurrency time series Ric and h.i denotes an average over time. Standardized equity
returns are computed similarly and we denote this time series R̂je (t). Having
normalized the returns, we may construct empirical correlation matrices

for cryptocurrency and equity time series. Elements of both correlation
matrices ω c (i, j) and ω e (i, j) lie ∈ [−1, 1]. We study the evolution of these
correlation matrices, using a rolling window of T1 = 60 days. One must be
judicious in the choice of the smoothing parameter T1 , as correlation coefficients
can be excessively smooth or noisy if T1 is too large or too small respectively.
Our choice of 60 days corresponds approximately to the length of the COVID-19
market crash. This allows us to capture the entirety of the COVID-19 market
shock, without including unrelated data outside the COVID-related crash in
our calculation. Next, we study the dynamics of the cryptocurrency and equity
market security collections by applying principal components analysis (PCA)
to the two time-varying correlation matrices. For each correlation matrix, we
wish to estimate the linear maps Φc and Φe that transform our standardized
cryptocurrency returns R̂c and equity returns R̂e into uncorrelated variables Z c
and Z e respectively. That is,
Z c = Φc R̂c ,
e

e

Z = Φ R̂ .

(6)

where the rows of Z c and Z e represent PCs of the matrices Rc and Re . The
rows of Φc and Φe , which contain PC coefficients, are ordered such that the
first rows are along the axes of most variation in the data, with subsequent PCs,
subject to the optimization constraint that they are all mutually orthogonal, each
accounting for maximal variance along their respective axes. The correlation
matrices, which are symmetric and diagonalizable matrices can be written in
the form

where Dc , De are diagonal matrices with eigenvalues λci , λej , and Λc , Λe are
orthogonal matrices with the associated eigenvectors from the cryptocurrency
and equity correlation matrices respectively. The PCs are estimated using the
diagonalizations above.
Finally, we contrast the proportion of variance produced by a sub-collection
of eigenvalues within each of the two collections. The total variance of the
cryptocurrency returns R̂c and equity returns R̂e for the N and K assets
respectively, is equal to the sum of all eigenvalues λc1 + ... + λcN and λe1 + .... + λeK .
This is equivalently the trace of the two diagonal matrices of eigenvalues tr(Dc ) =
N and tr(De ) = K. To compute the proportion of total variance explained

by the mth PC in R̂c and R̂e is therefore λ̃cm = λcm /N and λ̃em = λem /K. For
more details on this construction readers should visit [1, 69, 70]. In some cases,
the correlation matrix under examination may not be full rank. This is not a
concern for the proceeding analysis, where we focus on the behavior of the first
10 eigenvectors. Since PCs are mutually orthogonal, and by definition linearly
independent, this would not cause any issues in the conclusions resulting from
our methodology.
Prior work has demonstrated that the eigenvector corresponding to the
largest eigenvalue represents the significance of ‘the market’ within the collection
[1]. Bearing this in mind, there are several noteworthy insights revealed in
Figure 1 regarding the similarity in cryptocurrency and equity dynamics. First,
both Figure 1a and Figure 1b exhibit a broadly similar shape; the majority
of explanatory variance is provided by the first several eigenvectors, with the
remaining proportion of total variance falling away quickly over the entire time
period. Next, the explanatory variance provided by the first cryptocurrency
eigenvalue λ̃c1 seen in figure 1a is consistently higher than the corresponding
equity market eigenvalue λ̃e1 in figure 1b. This demonstrates that the collective
force of the market is more pronounced in cryptocurrencies than equities during
our window of analysis. The second observation one may make from Figure 1
is the significant variability in λ̃e1 when compared with λ̃c1 . This may highlight
that within equity markets, there is more variability related to the market’s
impact on collective behaviour than that of cryptocurrencies. The time-varying
explanatory variance of the first PC is displayed in Figure 2, where λ̃c1 > λ̃e1 for
almost the entire window of analysis. Figure 2 indicates that the difference in
the first eigenvalue, |λ̃c1 − λ̃e1 |, is smallest during the Peak COVID period.
3.2. Dynamics surrounding COVID-19
In this section we study the similarity in the dynamics of cryptocurrencies
and equities during three discrete time periods which are characterized by
different systematic (market) risk profiles. Our goal is to determine whether
5

the similarity in cryptocurrency and equity market dynamics changes in varying
market conditions. The three periods are defined
• Pre-COVID: 03-01-2018 to 28-02-2020,
• Peak COVID: 02-03-2020 to 29-05-2020,
• Post-COVID: 01-06-2020 to 08-12-2020,

explanatory variance of the first 10 eigenvalues. λ̃c1,t , ..., λ̃c10,t and λ̃e1,t , ..., λ̃e10,t .

variance is provided by the first 10 eigenvalues in both the cryptocurrency and
equity collections, we ignore the negligible difference in total variance explained
by the remaining elements of the eigenspectrum.

Figure 3 shows the cryptocurrency and equity eigenspectra during the three
windows of analysis. Of the three analysis windows, the two eigenspectra appear
to be most similar during the Peak COVID period, which is displayed in Figure
3b. This is confirmed in Table 1, which shows dynamics deviation scores for
the three windows of analysis. The results highlight a significant increase in the
similarity of the two collections’ collective behaviour during the Peak COVID
period, with a score of 0.160. The Pre-COVID and Post-COVID scores are 0.369
and 0.298 respectively, highlighting less similarity in the dynamics of equities
and cryptocurrencies outside periods of market crisis. This is primarily due to
the equity eigenspectrum’s first eigenvalue exhibiting lower explanatory variance
in the Pre-COVID and Post-COVID periods. This is shown in Figure 3a and
Figure 3c respectively.
Next, we contrast the cryptocurrency and equity correlation coefficients
during the same three windows of analysis seen in Figure 4. This analysis is
similar to that conducted in [24], where the probability density functions of
off-diagonal correlation matrix elements are studied for six base cryptocurrencies
and the USD. [24]’s analysis also focuses on the distribution of correlation matrix
eigenvalues, and the time-varying behavior of the correlation matrix’s largest
8

eigenvalues (seen in Figure 7 of [24]). However, the work presented in this
section focuses more prominently on changes in the distribution of correlation
matrix elements seen in different markets across cryptocurrencies and equities.
Figures 4a and 4b display kernel density estimates of cryptocurrency and equity
correlation matrix elements during the Pre-COVID, Peak COVID and PostCOVID periods. There are two important insights. First, both cryptocurrency
and equity markets highlight a sharp increase in collective correlations during
the Peak COVID period. Both cryptocurrencies and equities displayed markedly
lower correlation coefficients in the Pre-COVID and Post-COVID periods. In
all three periods, cryptocurrency correlation coefficients were more strongly
positive than that of equities. These findings are consistent with the results in
the Section 3.1, where dynamics deviations were lowest during the Peak COVID
market period; suggesting that during market crises cryptocurrency and equity
behaviours are most similar.
4. Trajectory modelling
In this section, we study the trajectory dynamics [71] of equity and cryptocurrency closing prices for the entirety of our time period, a single period of
T = 508 days. To compare trajectories of securities with markedly different
prices, we normalize the cryptocurrency time series ci (t) and equity time series
ej (t). Analyzing a candidate individual cryptocurrency provides a function
PT
ci ∈ RT . We let kci k1 = t=1 |ci (t)| be the L1 norm of the function, and define
a normalized cryptocurrency price trajectory by Tci = kcciik1 . Similarly, we define
PT
kej k1 = t=1 |ej (t)|, and the corresponding normalized equity trajectory as
e
Tej = kejjk1 . Distances between such vectors highlight the relative change in cryptocurrency and equity securities during the time period. To study such changes,
TC
TE
we define two trajectory matrices, Dij
= kTci − Tcj k1 and Dij
= kTei − Tej k1 ,
and perform hierarchical clustering.
First, we compare norms of the two trajectory matrices to better understand
similarity within each collection. Both of these matrices are symmetric, real
and have trace 0. As the two collections are of different sizes, we normalize the
norm computations by the number of elements in each trajectory matrix.

and the normalized equity trajectory matrix norm kDT E k2∗ = K −1
i,j |dij | .
The normalized cryptocurrency trajectory matrix norm kDT C k2∗ = 0.4804 and
the normalized equity trajectory matrix norm kDT E k2∗ = 0.1849, demonstrating
more similarity in normalized trajectories among equities than cryptocurrencies.
There are several possible explanations for this finding. First, there could be
some bias in our sample of equities, having chosen the 72 largest equities in
the world by market capitalization. It is likely that the volatility in their price
behaviour will be less than that of smaller equities. On the other hand, this
finding may quite reasonably reflect the volatile nature of cryptocurrency market
sentiment. Although correlations among the cryptocurrency constituents are
9

Figure 5: Hierarchical clustering on DT C .

higher than that of equity constituents, the consistently strong influence of ‘the
market’ may make trajectories highly responsive to sharp changes in sentiment.
Figures 5 and 6 display the cryptocurrency and equity trajectory dendrograms
respectively. Each dendrogram highlights several noteable insights regarding
trajectory clusters. Figure 5 shows two major clusters, a predominant cluster
with high self-similarity, a smaller more amorphous cluster and a single outlier in
Revain. The predominant cluster contains most cryptocurrencies analyzed with
less volatile price trajectories. The smaller cluster is composed of cryptocurrencies having exhibited major volatility in their price trajectory, such as Chainlink,
which experienced a price increase of almost 42 times during our window of analysis. This dendrogram has markedly different structure to the equity trajectory
dendrogram, shown in Figure 6. The equity trajectory dendrogram exhibits
more substantial self-similarity, with three clearly defined clusters; one predominant cluster and two smaller, well-defined clusters exhibiting high self-similarity.
The first minority cluster contains stocks such as; Microsoft, Amazon, Alibaba,
Tencent, Facebook, Apple and TSMC - all of which are technology companies.
The second small cluster contains stocks such as: Chevron, Exxon, BP, Shell,
Wells Fargo and HSBC - primarily financial services and energy companies. Both
of these sectors tend to perform well in buoyant equity markets, and badly in
declining markets. The largest, most predominant third cluster contains the
remaining equities. The growth in passive and factor based investing may have
increased the similarity in these equities’ behaviours, as investors increasingly
seek to buy stocks within a sector or ‘theme’ of the market.
10

5. Erratic behaviour modelling
In this section we study the similarity of structural breaks in our two multivariate time series of log returns, Ric (t) and Rje (t) defined earlier. For each
security in the respective time series, we apply the two-phase change point detection algorithm described by [72] to generate a set of structural breaks for each
log return time series. Each change point represents a point in time where the
algorithm determines the statistical properties of the time series to have changed.
We apply the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, detecting general distributional changes
in the underlying time series. The change point detection method could instead
focus on changes in specific distributional moments such as mean or variance,
c
e
however. We obtain two collections of finite sets ξ1c , ..., ξN
, and ξ1e , ..., ξK
for
cryptocurrency and equity time series respectively, where all sets are a subset of
{1, ..., T }.
Next, we compute distances between the cryptocurrency structural break sets
ξic and equity structural break sets ξje . There is significant literature highlighting
issues in using metrics such as the Hausdorff distance, due to its sensitivity to
outliers, [73, 74] and so we use a recently introduced semi-metric modification
[74] between candidate sets within our two collections of structural breaks ξic
and ξje . Normalized distances between sets of cryptocurrencies are computed:

As all time series are of equal length, it is not necessary to normalize by the
length of the time series. Finally, we form two breaks matrices between sets of

cryptocurrency structural breaks, Dij
= D(ξic , ξjc ) and equity structural breaks,
BE
e e
Dij = D(ξi , ξj ). To better understand collective similarity in structural breaks,
we perform hierarchical clustering on our two breaks matrices.
Like Section 4, we compare norms of the two distance matrices to better
understand breaks similarity within each collection. As the two collections
are of different sizes, again, we normalize the two norm computations by the
size of the distance matrix.

breaks among equities and cryptocurrencies. This result is consistent with earlier
findings [11], which suggest that although one collection of time series may exhibit
more volatility and possibly warrant a higher number of structural breaks, the
univariate nature of the change point detection algorithm [72] detects structural
breaks relative to the properties of the particular time series. Therefore, although
cryptocurrency time series may exhibit more volatility, the behaviour in their
collective structural breaks is not necessarily more or less similar than that of
the equity collection.
Next, we compare the cluster structures of the two collections. The cryptocurrency breaks dendrogram, seen in Figure 7 consists of one primary cluster with
three, diffuse sub-clusters. The primary cluster has one predominant sub-cluster
of concentrated similarity, with the three remaining, smaller clusters having a
more indeterminate form. By contrast, the equity breaks dendrogram in Figure
8 has a more easily interpreted cluster structure. There are four small clusters,
each of which contains two or three equities, and a predominant cluster which is
comprised of the remaining equities. The four small clusters appear to cluster
based on sector, where cluster one consists of Facebook and Comcast (technology), cluster two consists of BP and Shell (energy), cluster three consists of
Merck and Amgen (biotechnology/pharmaceuticals), and cluster four consists of
Tencent, Apple and Microsoft (technology). These results suggest that, with the
exception of select equities within specific sectors that exhibit similar structural
break patterns, most equities have similar structural breaks behaviour.

6. Extreme behaviour modelling
In this section, we study anomalies with respect to total returns and extreme
behaviors within our collections of cryptocurrencies and equities. First, we
outline the procedure to measure distance between extreme values of candidate
time series. We let µ be a probability distribution that stores the extreme values
of a cryptocurrency time series ci (t) or equity time series ej (t). We assume
that µ is a continuous probability measure of the form µ = f (x)dx, where dx is
Lebesgue measure, and f (x) is a probability density function that is non-negative
everywhere and integrates to 1. We study the 10% and 90% points of density,
respectively, by the equations
l

Z

f (x)dx = 0.1

(14)

f (x)dx = 0.1

The range x ≤ l gives the most extreme 10% of the distribution on the left side
of the distribution, while the range x ≥ u gives the 10% right most extreme
values. The restricted function is defined

g(x) = f (x)1{x≤l}∪{x≥u} = 0, l < x < u

f (x), x ≥ u.
Next, we construct an associated measure ν = g(x)dx, with dx as Lebesgue
measure. We generate N associated probability measures µc1 , ..., µcN , and returns
c
measures ν1c , ..., νN
for our cryptocurrency time series. Similarly we generate
e
K probability measures µe1 , ..., µeK , and return measure ν1e , ..., νK
for our equity
time series. As all restricted measures are of total size 0.2, we use the Wasserstein
metric to compute distances between these truncated distributions. Finally, we
form a matrix between the distributional extremities of all time series. Let
EC
Dij
= dw (νic , νjc ) be the matrix between the cryptocurrency extreme return
EE
distributions, and Dij
= dw (νie , νje ) be the matrix between equity extreme
return distributions.

where A is symmetric, Aii = 1, 0 ≤ Aij ≤ 1, ∀i, j. We now define an affinity

dimension 117 x 117, which include all 45 cryptocurrencies and 72 equities
analyzed in this paper.
We study Figure 9 and compare collective similarities in returns and extremes
among our two collections. Figure 9a shows the affinity returns matrix AR . It
is clear that both equities and cryptocurrencies exhibit strong self-similarity,
with the equity collection exhibiting slightly more similar returns than the
cryptocurrency collection. Although not as strong as the intra-asset similarity,
there is still reasonable similarity in the returns profile between that of equities
and cryptocurrencies. Figure 9b displays a clear difference in the collective
behaviours. Similarly to returns, equities exhibit more self-similarity than that of
cryptocurrencies. However unlike returns, there is markedly less similarity when
comparing the extremes of cryptocurrencies and equities. These findings are
consistent with the results presented in Sections 4 and 5, where cryptocurrencies
were shown to be more varied in their trajectories and less consistent in their
structural breaks. This finding supports the high degree of dependence identified
between extreme and erratic behaviour in the cryptocurrency market.

7. Anomaly persistence
In this section, we study the evolution of ranks among cryptocurrencies and equities with respect to risk-adjusted returns. Rather than using correlation, we apply the concept of ranks, as financial analysts often apply ‘ranking’ systems when
identifying anomalous securities (equities,
bonds, currencies, etc.).
We define
P
P
rolling risk-adjusted returns κci (t) =

t
c
m=t−60 Ri (m)
σic (t)

and κej (t) =

t
e
m=t−60 Rj (m)
σje (t)

where σic (t) and σje (t) are the standard deviations of rolling cryptocurrency and
equity log returns for t ∈ {61, ..., T }. We use a rolling window of 61 days and

record two time-evolving sequences of risk adjusted return ranks. Given rank
vectors s, t ∈ {61, ..., T }, we define K c (s, t) and K e (s, t) as matrices measuring
the Kendall rank correlation coefficient between any two risk-adjusted return
rank vectors s and t for all possible points in time. A higher score indicates more
similarity in the securities exhibiting high and low risk-adjusted returns at any
two points in time. Elements of both matrices k c (s, t) and k e (s, t) lie ∈ [−1, 1].
First, we study the norms
the two anomaly persistence matrices kK c k2 =
qP
qof
P
e
c 2
e 2
s,t |kst | and kK k2 =
s,t |kst | . The cryptocurrency anomaly persistence norm, kK c k2 = 109.69 and the equity anomaly persistence norm kK e k2
= 122.62. The higher score for the equity collection suggests that there is
more consistency in the stocks that are anomalous on a risk-adjusted return
basis over time. Figure 10 which plots two distributions of the elements k c (s, t)
and k e (s, t), demonstrates a higher average correlation for equities than that of
cryptocurrencies. Further interesting structure over time is revealed in Figure
11.
Both Figures 11a and 11b have high correlation scores around the diagonal,
which is indicative of short-term dependence in anomalous behaviours within
both collections. However, Figure 11b clearly displays a higher level of similarity
over time - indicating more persistence in anomalous behaviours. This is further
supported in our hierarchical clustering analysis, where the dendrograms for
K c (s, t) and K e (s, t) are displayed in Figure 12. There are two primary takeaways
from this analysis. First, K e (s, t) is demonstrably more positive than K c (s, t)
for the vast majority of the dendrogram. This indicates that there is greater
similarity in risk-adjusted return ranks, over all comparative measurements in
time, for our collection of equities. Second, the K e (s, t) dendrogram determines a
total of 9 clusters, while K c (s, t) has a total of 11 clusters. This finding indicates
more stability in equity rank correlation scores over the entirety of our analysis
window.

8. Conclusion
Our work in Section 3 demonstrates that collective dynamics in the cryptocurrency market are significantly stronger than that of the equity market. The
explanatory variance provided by the largest eigenvector is consistently larger,
and more stable among cryptocurrencies than equities. Partitioning our analysis
into three discrete windows highlights that collective dynamics are most similar
between our two collections during the Peak COVID period, demonstrating that
equities and cryptocurrencies behave most similarly during market crises. This is
further supported in our correlation matrix analysis, where both cryptocurrencies
and equities experience a sharp increase in their correlations during the peak of
COVID-19. In periods surrounding the crisis (Pre-COVID and Post-COVID),
cryptocurrency correlation coefficients are more strongly positive than that of
equities. The findings in this section are also consistent with the work presented
in [75]. In [75] the authors demonstrate that although cryptocurrency dynamics
are decoupled with other asset classes during 2019, during select market events
in 2020 such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the dynamics of cryptocurrencies and
other asset classes behave much more similarly.
The work presented in this manuscript certainly has its limitations. The work
of [76] demonstrates that after explicitly accounting for time zone differences
between indices, (Dow Jones and DAX), there is a significant increase in the
similarity of the dynamics of such collections. When initially analyzing both
collections in conjunction, the authors show there are two dominant eigenvalues
representing the dynamics of each collection. After accounting for differences
between the collections by translating the returns of the DAX, one dominant
eigenvalue exhibits itself - highlighting a marked increase in the similarity of the
dynamics among the total collection. This has not been explicitly considered in
this work, and could alter the results and subsequent interpretation. Further
research comparing the dynamics of cryptocurrencies and equities using techniques from [76], and studying the resulting change in the dynamics deviation
scores could be of interest to the econophysics community.
Section 4 examines the similarity in normalized price trajectories among
both collections. Distance matrix norms indicate that equities exhibit more
similarity among their trajectories than cryptocurrencies. This may be due to
the significant price volatility exhibited by cryptocurrencies over the past two
years, making their trajectories (generally, but not universally) more dissimilar.
Hierarchical clustering on both time series displays marked differences in cluster
structures. Equity trajectories display more self-similarity than cryptocurrencies.
We suspect that the latent phenomenon may be the growth of passive and
factor-based investing over the last several years.
Section 5 compares the similarity in erratic behaviour among equities and
cryptocurrencies. Distance matrix norms display comparable similarity in the
erratic behaviours of cryptocurrencies and equities. Although cryptocurrencies
may be more volatile, the univariate nature of our changepoint detection algorithm is unable to determine structural breaks with respect to the rest of the
collection. Using other change point detection methodologies to detect structural
19

breaks [77] may result in different findings.
Our results in Section 6 are consistent with those in Section 4. Figure 9 shows
more homogeneity among equity extremes in comparison to cryptocurrencies.
Analyzing distance matrix norms and affinity matrices highlights a substantial
difference in self-similarity. When contrasting the similarity in all 117 time series
for total returns and extreme values, the distinction in extreme value similarity
is most evident.
Finally in Section 7, equities are shown to exhibit more persistent anomalies
than cryptocurrencies. We apply hierarchical clustering to our proposed anomaly
persistence matrix. Hierarchical clustering determines the existence of 9 and 11
clusters respectively in the K c (s, t) and K e (s, t). A lower number of clusters
signals greater consistency in anomaly ranks over time. This is further supported
analyzing the elements of our matrix, which indicate a higher correlation in
anomaly rankings over time in the equity time series.
This work bridges several disparate areas of research: nonlinear dynamics,
econophysics, COVID-19 and cryptocurrency market dynamics. There are several
interesting avenues for future research. First, our analysis could be applied to
more asset classes beyond cryptocurrencies and equities. Second, other techniques
could be introduced to study phenomena such as: market dynamics, trajectories,
extreme and erratic behaviour, and anomaly persistence. Finally, this analysis
could be run on different time windows and on a more timely basis. The chaotic
and non-deterministic nature of financial markets necessitates timely research
on topics of interest.

Appendix C. Change point detection algorithm
In this section, we provide an outline of change point detection algorithms, and
describe the specific algorithm that we implement. Many statistical modelling
problems require the identification of change points in sequential data. By
24

definition, these are points in time at which the statistical properties of a time
series change. The general setup for this problem is the following: a sequence
of observations x1 , x2 , ..., xn are drawn from random variables X1 , X2 , ..., Xn
and undergo an unknown number of changes in distribution at points τ1 , ..., τm .
One assumes observations are independent and identically distributed between
change points, that is, between each change points a random sampling of the
distribution is occurring. Following Ross [72], we notate this as follows:

F0 if i ≤ τ1



F if τ < i ≤ τ
1
1
2
Xi ∼

F
if
τ
<
i
≤
τ
2
2
3,



...
While this requirement of independence may appear restrictive, dependence can
generally be accounted for by modelling the underlying dynamics or drift process,
then applying a change point algorithm to the model residuals or one-step-ahead
prediction errors, as described by Gustafsson [78]. The change point models
applied in this paper follow Ross [72].
Appendix C.1. Batch change detection (Phase I)
This phase of change point detection is retrospective. We are given a fixed
length sequence of observations x1 , . . . , xn from random variables X1 , . . . , Xn .
For simplicity, assume at most one change point exists. If a change point exists
at time k, observations have a distribution of F0 prior to the change point, and
a distribution of F1 proceeding the change point, where F0 6= F1 . That is, one
must test between the following two hypotheses for each k:
H0 : Xi ∼ F0 , i = 1, ..., n
(
F0 i = 1, 2, ..., k
H1 : Xi ∼
F1 , i = k + 1, k + 2, ..., n
and end with the choice of the most suitable k.
One proceeds with a two-sample hypothesis test, where the choice of test
is dependent on the assumptions about the underlying distributions. To avoid
distributional assumptions, non-parametric tests can be used. Then one appropriately chooses a two-sample test statistic Dk,n and a threshold hk,n . If
Dk,n > hk,n then the null hypothesis is rejected and we provisionally assume that
a change point has occurred after xk . These test statistics Dk,n are normalised
to have mean 0 and variance 1 and evaluated at all values 1 < k < n, and the
largest value is assumed to be coincident with the existence of our sole change
point. That is, the test statistic is then
Dn =

max

k=2,...,n−1

Dk,n =

max

k=2,...,n−1

25

D̃k,n − µD̃k,n
σD̃k,n

where D̃k,n were our unnormalised statistics.
The null hypothesis of no change is then rejected if Dn > hn for some
appropriately chosen threshold hn . In this circumstance, we conclude that a
(unique) change point has occurred and its location is the value of k which
maximises Dk,n . That is,
τ̂ = argmax Dk,n .
k

This threshold hn is chosen to bound the Type 1 error rate as is standard in
statistical hypothesis testing. First, one specifies an acceptable level α for the
proportion of false positives, that is, the probability of falsely declaring that a
change has occurred if in fact no change has occurred. Then, hn should be chosen
as the upper α quantile of the distribution of Dn under the null hypothesis. For
the details of computation of this distribution, see [72]. Computation can often
be made easier by taking appropriate choice and storage of the Dk,n .
Appendix C.2. Sequential change detection (Phase II)
In this case, the sequence (xt )t≥1 does not have a fixed length. New observations are received over time, and multiple change points may be present.
Assuming no change point exists so far, this approach treats x1 , ..., xt as a fixed
length sequence and computes Dt as in phase I. A change is then flagged if
Dt > ht for some appropriately chosen threshold. If no change is detected, the
next observation xt+1 is brought into the sequence. If a change is detected, the
process restarts from the following observation in the sequence. The procedure
therefore consists of a repeated sequence of hypothesis tests.
In this sequential setting, ht is chosen so that the probability of incurring
a Type 1 error is constant over time, so that under the null hypothesis of no
change, the following holds:
P (D1 > h1 ) = α,
P (Dt > ht |Dt−1 ≤ ht−1 , ..., D1 ≤ h1 ) = α, t > 1.
In this case, assuming that no change occurs, the average number of observations
received before a false positive detection occurs is equal to α1 . This quantity
is referred to as the average run length, or ARL0. Once again, there are
computational difficulties with this conditional distribution and the appropriate
values of ht , as detailed in Ross [72].
