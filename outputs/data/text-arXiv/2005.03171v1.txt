Abstract: The current COVID-19 pandemic is having detrimental consequences
worldwide. The pandemic started to develop strongly by the end of January and beginning
of February 2020, first in China with subsequent rapid spread to other countries with new
epicenters of the outbreaks concentrated mainly within the 30-50ºN latitudinal band (e.g.,
South Korea, Japan, Iran, Italy, Spain). Simultaneously, an unusual persistent anticyclonic
situation prevailing at latitudes around 40ºN was observed on global scale, in line with an
anomalously strong positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation. This atypical situation could
have resulted in favorable meteorological conditions for a quicker spread of the virus over
the latitude band detailed above. This possible connection needs further attention in order to
understand the meteorological and climatological factors related to the COVID-19
outbreak, and for anticipating the spatio-temporal distribution of possible future pandemics.

The world is currently undergoing the COVID-19 pandemic associated with the SARSCoV-2 coronavirus (Zhou et al., 2020). Several studies have shown that some
meteorological variables, especially air temperature and humidity, can play a role in the
spread of COVID-19 (Araujo and Naimi, 2020; Bu et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020; Luo et
al., 2020; Notari, 2020; Sajadi et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020), even though no evidence of
a major role of air temperatures has also been reported (Jamil et al., 2020; MartinezAlvarez et al., 2020). Overall, dry conditions with mild temperatures seem to increase the
transmission of the disease, in line with other respiratory viruses like influenza (Kudo et al.,
2019).
Interestingly, it has been pointed out recently that the first main COVID-19 outbreaks
occurred in regions and countries along an east-west longitudinal direction within a latitude
band between 30-50ºN. On average, it seems that these regions had in common a mean air
temperature of around 5-11ºC and low specific humidity levels of around 3-6 g/kg (Sajadi
et al., 2020). Thus, after the outbreak in China in early January 2020, the disease mainly
moved in February and March to countries such as Japan, South Korea, Iran, Italy and
Spain, which are all located within the above mentioned latitudinal band, while not
affecting significantly other regions immediately north and south of China. This spatial
spread of the main outbreaks between January and early March 2020 does not seem to
follow either population proximity connections or volume of international exchanges
(Sajadi et al., 2020). Therefore, it is plausible that the anomalous atmospheric circulation
pattern that occurred between January and March 2020, characterized by strong high-

2

pressure anomalies centered in the 40ºN belt, helped to modulate the spatial pattern of the
first outbreaks of the COVID-19.
Figure 1 (left) shows the global distribution of the geopotential height anomalies from
January to March (JFM) 2020 for the 300 hPa (top) and 500 hPa (bottom) levels as derived
from the NCEP/NCAR DOE Reanalysis product (Kanamitsu et al., 2002). A clear evidence
of a stable atmospheric circulation can be seen (i.e., positive anomalies) along the 30-50ºN
belt of the Northern Hemisphere, and the opposite (i.e., negative anomalies) north of 60ºN.
The latitudinal averages of the 300 hPa and 500 hPa (Figure 1, right) highlight a maximum
of the anomalies centered just at 40ºN, whereas very negative anomalies are reached above
70ºN. This spatial pattern fits with the known features related to the positive phase of the
Arctic Oscillation (AO).
The AO is a teleconnection pattern that summarizes the northern polar vortex variability at
surface level (Baldwin et al., 2003), and is characterized by pressure anomalies of one sign
over the Arctic and the Norwegian sea, balanced by anomalies of opposite sign centred
around latitudes between 35 and 50° of the Northern Hemisphere. The positive phase
pattern of the AO shows lower-than-average air pressure over the Arctic region and higherthan-average pressure at mid-latitudes. The AO index for JFM 2020 reached exceptionally
high values during these three months; in fact, they are the maximum ever recorded for the
available 1950-2020 period (Figure 2). These anomalous positive values of the AO resulted
in a reinforced polar vortex during JFM 2020, in line with the maps shown in Figure 1. A
strong polar vortex in February and March delays the spring arrival in the polar
stratosphere, keeping very low temperatures in its core and producing stratospheric ozone
depletion (Rex et al., 2004). Indeed, a remarkable ozone loss was registered over the Arctic

3

region during last March 2020 (Witze, 2020). Moreover, it is interesting to note that the
dynamical forcing by the greenhouse gases related to the anthropogenic climate change
could lead to an enhancement of the AO (Shindell et al., 2001).
It seems reasonable that the anticyclonic belt conditions favoured, to some extent, the
spread of the virus. In fact, for example, the rate of deaths per population by the end of
March 2020 averaged over latitude bands shows a clear maximum centred around 40ºN,
which matches the peak in positive air pressure anomalies (Figure 1, right). It can be argued
that along this band corridor around 35-50ºN, the positive pressure anomalies caused a
tendency towards dry and calm conditions, as well as temperate conditions, that fit with the
optimal meteorological conditions for the initial spread of the COVID-19 as has been
reported by Sajadi et al. (2020). For instance, Sanchez-Lorenzo et al. (2020) have shown
that the unusual persistent anticyclonic situation prevailing in southwestern Europe during
February 2020 could have resulted in ideal atmospheric conditions for a quicker spread of
the virus compared with the rest of the European countries. Therefore, in a year without this
anomalous positive AO index, the same mild temperatures and low specific humidity levels
recorded this JFM 2020 might have not been observed, and consequently a different spatiotemporal spread of the COVID-19 disease would have been expected.
To summarize, we highlight that an anomalous atmospheric circulation in early 2020,
characterized by a half-century record AO’s positive phase, may partially explain the first
steps in the spread of the COVID-19, which tended to concentrate along a latitudinal band
centered at 40ºN. This anomalous atmospheric circulation may have provided optimal
meteorological conditions for the virus propagation by decreasing the body’s defense
mechanisms, favoring the social contact patterns and/or enhancing the transmission of the

4

virus by means of the droplets and aerosols emitted after a cough. In fact, the strong
stability associated with the anticyclonic conditions and subsidence along the 40ºN band
may have promoted the airborne transmission, which has been recently suggested as a
crucial way to infect people with the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus (Morawska and Cao, 2020).
Equally, the tendency towards atmospheric stability can limit the dispersion of the natural
and anthropogenic pollutants, and high pollution levels have also been related to an
increase in the incidence of COVID-19 fatalities (Ogen, 2020; Wu et al., 2020). Overall,
the possible connection of the large-scale circulation on global scale and the COVID-19
outbreaks needs further research to better understand the physical and biological
mechanisms, as well as the potential spread of other respiratory-origin pandemics in the
past and future.
