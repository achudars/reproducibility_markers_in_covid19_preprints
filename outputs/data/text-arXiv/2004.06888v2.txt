Abstract—In this paper, we propose a new real-time differential
virus transmission model, which can give more accurate and robust short-term predictions of COVID-19 transmitted infectious
disease with benefits of near-term trend projection. Different
from the existing Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR)
based virus transmission models, which fits well for pandemic
modeling with sufficient historical data, the new model, which
is also SEIR based, uses short history data to find the trend of
the changing disease dynamics for the infected, the dead and the
recovered so that it can naturally accommodate the adaptive realtime changes of disease mitigation, business activity and social
behavior of populations. Our work is inspired by the observation
that contagious disease transmission prediction is similar to weather
prediction: only short term prediction is typically accurate due
to many time-varying interplaying factors as well as social and
behavior uncertainties involved. On the other hand, accurate shortterm prediction such as one week or ten days can give local
government and hospical decision makers sufficient lead time for
healthcare resources and critical personnel planning to provide
in-patient treatment. As the parameters of the improved SEIR
models are trained by short history window data for accurate
trend prediction, our differential epidemic model, essentially are
window-based time-varying SEIR model. Since SEIR model still
is a physics-based disease transmission model, its near-term (like
one month) projection can still be very instrumental for policy
makers to guide their decision for disease mitigation and business
activity policy changes in a real-time. This is especially useful if
the pandemic lasts more than one year with different phases
across the world like 1918 flu pandemic. Numerical results on
the recent COVID-19 data from China, Italy and US, California
and New York states have been analyzed. A dedicated website has
been built to show the projections based on the latest data [1].

I. I NTRODUCTION
The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic is generating
significant social, economic, and health impacts and has highlighted the importance of real-time analysis and prediction
of emerging infectious diseases and health care resource and
personnel planning and economical activity guideling.
One of the well-known models that is reasonably predictive
for human-to-human transmission is the so-called SusceptibleInfectious-Removed (SIR) model, which was published in its
first form around the 1920s [21]. The model later has been
extended to consider more complicated situations such as
the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model [3].
Those models are very successful to describe how the disease
dynamics will change over time once more sufficient data
are available (from outbreak to finish). Recently those models
have been applied to study recent COVID-19 transmissions
in different countries with certain successes [4], [15]–[17],
[25]. For example, it is observed that city-wide lockdown can
lower the transmission rate substantially from those models.
On the other hand, the data-driven and curve-fitting methods

for the prediction of COVID-19 such as Gaussian function
based fitting method in IHME projection [10], exponential
curving fitting in [24], machine-learning based approaches
in [9], [23] can fit the data well. However, those methods
generally suffer the lack of physical insights of transmission
and will not work well when the data does fit their models
well (For instance, two waves of infections). For real time
prediction, large projection ranges have to be given, which
renders the projection less valuable for medical resources and
mitigation policy planning.
Furthermore, the worldwide public health crisis like 1918
pandemic, which killed an estimated 50 million people worldwide, including an estimated 675,000 people in the United
States, are difficult to model, even to project [2]. H1N1 flu
lasted from April 1917 to April 1919 for two years with
three major phases across different parts of world. Cities like
San Francisco even experienced strong second waves of death
increase when the social distance was relaxed too early. Such
long-term multi-phase and multi-year transmission dynamic is
very difficult to be captured by existing pandemic models. As
a result, real-time short-term prediction and near-tern trend
projection can give each city and county policy maker and
resource planners extremely valuable information to guide the
disease mitigation and business open/close decision in a real
time.
On the other hand, traditional physics-based SIR/SEIR
epidemic modeling and its variants suffer several drawbacks
especially for real-time disease transmission predictions as it
is static model in which many key parameters such as transmission rate and recovery rates are typically fixed values from
fitting. However, for countries like US, the local government
interventions and mitigation policies such as active surveillance, contact tracing, quarantine, massive testing, school and
business closure, shelter in place, social distancing etc. keep
changing to respond the local epidemic situations. Also for
each state in US has different time lines for implementing
different prevention and mitigation measures, which make the
static based prediction even more difficult to predict. Further
the social behaviors of population, such as bearing face coverage masks are not consistent through different regions and
cities as the pandemic progresses, which will affect the transmission rate as well. The availability of healthcare resources of
each city and county, which are also changing factors, which
may also affect recovery rate. As a result, existing static SEIR
models do not fit well for real-time disease prediction as the
key parameters such as transmission rate, recovery rate, which
is also closely related to the effective reproduction rate R0,

are time-varying parameters. On the other hand, one important
observation is that contagious disease transmission prediction
is similar to weather prediction: only short term prediction
is accurate due to many time-varying interplaying factors as
well as social and behavior uncertainties involved. The widely
watched IHME (Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation)
model for real-time COVID-19 epidemic prediction [10] is
purely based on mathematic curve fitting techniques, which
lacks the theoretical foundation of epidemic transmission
found in the SIR models and thus its prediction accuracy is
highly debatable.
To mitigate this problem, time-varying SEIR models have
been proposed in the past. Dureau et al tried to model the
time-varying affects of the SEIR models by considering partial
and noisy data. They introduced stochastic processes into
the SEIR models and solved the resulting stochastic SEIR
partial differential equations using Markov Chain Monte Carlo
methods in which the transmission is modeled as random
walks, which are very expensive to compute [8]. This approach
was applied to study the transmission within and outside
Wuhan for January to February 2020 [11]. Recently Chen et
al proposed time-dependent SIR model to model the COVID19 outbreaks in China [6], In this mode, model parameters
are computed in a daily basis. As a result, it lacks the good
predictability as all the key parameters have been predicted a
prior first, and some ad-hoc methods was introduced to predict
the parameters in a near future.
In this work, we propose a new real-time differential virus
transmission modeling method, which can give more accurate
and robust short-term predictions of COVID-19 transmitted
infectious disease while still maintain the near-term projection
benefit. The new model is based on enhanced SusceptibleExposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) virus transmission model.
But it tries to obtain the differential view of pandemic dynamics in a short history window to analyze the short trend
of the transmission so that it can be more accurate over
different periods of time to accommodate the adaptive changes
of disease mitigation, business activity and social behavior of
populations. As the parameters of the improved SEIR models
are trained by short history window data for accurate trend
prediction, our differential epidemic model, essentially are
window-based time-varying SEIR model. Since SEIR model
still is a physics-based disease transmission model, its nearterm (like one month) projection can still be very instrumental
for policy makers to guide their decision for disease mitigation
and business activity policy changes in a real-time. Numerical
results on the recent COVID-19 data from China, Italy and
US, California and New York states are analyzed. A dedicated
website has been built to show the projections based on the
latest data [1].
Fig. 1 illustrates the modeling and prediction results from
the proposed differential SEIR model for the COVID-19
disease for California from early March to later July 2020. As
we can see, at the beginning, the infected grows very fast, the
projected growth also reflects such fast changing rates. But as
social distancing and stay at home policies were introduced
across cities and counties in California in the later March,
the growth rate went down, the projected growth at different
time point also reflects such trends. Based on the projection

of our model at May 1, 2020, the infected case will reach
to the peak about 72.37K around Jun 14 in California, which
indicates the peak medical resources needed. In contrast, the
well-watched IHME’s prediction [10] predicts that the peak
medical resource needed is around April 17. We will show
more significant differences between our models and IHME’s
prediction [10] for New York state later.
II. T HE ENHANCED SEIR BASE

MODEL

In this section, we first present the extended SIR model,
which is a extension of classical SEIR model [7], [12], [13],
[18]–[20], [22] as the base model for the proposed differential modeling shown later. The proposed base model, called
SEIRDP model, is similar to the recently proposed generalized
SEIR model for studying the COVID-19 disease in Wuhan
and China [17]. We removed the quarantine compartment in
the proposed SEIRDP model as there is no quarantine data
for most of countries outside China. The resulting SEIRDP
(Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered, Death, Insusceptible (P)) model is shown in Fig. 2. In this base model, we
have six states, i.e. {S(t), P (t), E(t), I(t), R(t), D(t)}, which
indicate the number of the susceptible cases, insusceptible
cases, exposed cases (infected but not yet be infectious, in
a latent period), infectious cases (confirmed with infectious
capacity), recovered and immune cases and closed cases (or
death). Then the total number of population in a certain
region or county is N = S + P + E + I + R + D. The
coefficients {α, β, γ −1 , λ−1 , κ} represent the protection rate,
infection rate, average latent time, cure rate, and mortality rate,
respectively. The introduction of insusceptible compartment
represents gradual changing (or growing) population, which
will not be infected due to some strong disease mitigation
measures such as enforced shelter in place, strict city lockdown
in China and European countries. The basic reproduction
number, R0, represents the number of secondary infections
from a primary infected individual in a fully susceptible
population, which can be computed by [17]
R0 = βλ−1 (1 − α)n

(1)

where n is the number of days. We remark that If we force
α = 0, the proposed SEIRDP model essentially becomes the

classical SEIR model (if we put recovered and death cases
into one recovery compartment).

Fig. 2: The proposed enhanced SEIR base model

III. T HE PROPOSED DIFFERENTIAL SEIR MODEL
Once we have the base SEIR model, then we can present
our differential SEIR model. In this model, basically the key
parameters will become time dependent.

Fig. 3: Fitting in a moved time window

In our work, we introduce a time window concept, which
represents a short period of time in a few days, as shown in
Fig. 3. In this figure, the red box present a history length of
the data (h) we use for training the model. The red box will
move one window size (w) as one step forward. For instance
five days can be a good time window. In each time window, all
the key parameters in the base SEIR models are constant. This
reflects the fact that the transmission and recovery conditions
for population does not change in a short window time so
that we can use a traditional static SEIR model based on
the history of data around this window time and we can
also predict a short future with sufficient accurate assuming
such disease dynamic does not change dramatically, which is

also reasonable. Based on this observation, we can present
the resulting ordinary differential equations for the proposed
differential SEIR model as follows:
S(t)I(t)
dS(t)
= −β(ti )
− α(ti )S(t)
dt
N
S(t)I(t)
dE(t)
= β(ti )
− γ(ti )E(t)
dt
N
dI(t)
= γ(ti )E(t) − λ(ti , t)I(t) − κ(ti , t)I(t)
dt
(2)
dR(t)
= λ(ti , t)I(t)
dt
dD(t)
= κ(ti , t)I(t)
dt
dP (t)
= α(ti )S(t)
dt
where time t belongs to the ith time window. If we use ti
to indicate the last day in the window i, then we have t ∈
[ti − h + 1, ti ], where h is the window size. The window can
be moved forward with stride w days. Therefore, we have the
relationship ti+1 = ti + w. The cure rate λ(ti , t) and mortality
rate κ(ti , t) are time-dependent, which again are dependent
on two parameters. They again are time-window dependent
(explained below):
λ(ti , t) = λ0 (ti )[1 − exp(−λ1 (ti )t)]
κ(tt , t)) = κ0 (ti ) exp(−κ1 (ti )t)
Those two equations basically say that cute rate or recovery
rate λ(t) will goes to constant value λ0 exponentially over a
time and the mortality rate κ(t) goes down exponentially over
time [5].
We notice that all the key parameters for the enhanced SEIR
model are time-varying instead of fixed values. But they are
so-called time window dependent as they do not change every
day compared to existing time-varying based SEIR models.
Specifically, we select w = 5 days as a window (the window
size is a hyper parameter and can be optimized for different
regions and countries). We perform each prediction over each
non-overlapping window and then slide one window forward
for next prediction and so on. As a result, within the ith
window, the seven parameters, {α(ti ), β(ti ), γ −1 (ti ), λ−1
0 (ti ),
λ−1
1 (ti ), κ0 (ti ),κ1 (ti )} are kept constant. The parameters
will be found by a regression process shown next section.
The stride can be h = 10 days or h = 15 days, which
is also another hyper parameter for our model. Since all
the parameters are time window dependent, the reproduction
number becomes time dependent, which is also called effective
reproduction number, Rt at time t in ith time window. Rt can
be computed as follows:
Rt (ti ) = β(ti )λ−1 (ti )

(1 − αj )

j=1

We note that such window-based SEIR model obtained
at ith window also depends on the historical data from the
previous windows. The reason is that our differential model
can be viewed as performing the differential operations on a
dynamic systems at a specific time frame or window, not on a

window indicated by ti , which indicates the last day in the
window i. As a result, we can rewrite the partial differential
equation (2) into the following initial value PDE in matrix
form with the initial condition Y0 , which indicate the the

data of the previous windows will be represented as the
initial conditions for solving the PDE of (2) and obtaining the
resulting parameters by fitting the resulting discretized PDE
with the data in this window.

Then we perform the time domain discretization using
simple Forward Euler or higher order explicit Runge-Kutta
method and we end up of number of algebraic equations.
By solving this resulting equation in the time domain, we
can obtain the seven parameters over the given data of
{I(t), R(t), D(t)} in the past 10 or 15 days with the initial

V. R ESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Analysis for public data from Hubei Province, China
We first show the modeling results for Hubei province of
China from early January to the middle of April, 2020. Fig. 4
shows the time evolution of the numbers of the currently
infected, the recovered and the death cases over this period.
Note that many public websites show the cumulative cases,

which are different than the currently infected cases. The
currently infected cases equal the cumulative case minus the
recovered and dead cases. The circles in the figure (in all
the figures) are the measured data and the solid line is the
last project in early April 2020 as China’s pandemic outbreak
basically has run its course already and we have all the
historical data from early outbreak to finish.
Notice that on Feb. 12, 2020, COVID-19 testing criteria
was relaxed in Hubei Province. As a result, there is a huge
jump of confirmed infected cases, which can be viewed as
an outlier for the date. As a result, the projection based on
the history before and around Feb. 12 is quite off the track
of actual cases as shown in Fig. 4. But for the most of days
over the two month period, the projected and actual measured
cases match very well.
Fig. 5 shows the effective reproduction number, Rt , over
the same period time. As we can see, Rt becomes less than 1
around Feb. 19, which is about 3 weeks after city lockdown in
Wuhan on Feb 23, 2020. This indeed shows the effects of strict
city lockdown in Hubei province to reduce the transmission
effect of the virus. Feb. 19 is also close to the time when
the peak of infected people was reached as shown in Fig. 4.
As a result, analysis and prediction of effective reproduction
number can give us more insights into how the pandemic

Fig. 7 shows COVID-19 disease modeling and prediction for
Italy from late February to middle of April 2020 as Italy was
mostly severely impacted by COVID-19 in Europe. As we can
see, our differential models match well for the historical data.
The prediction around early March is quite aggressive as the
actual growth rate for both infected and death are very high.
This is also reflected in the effective reproduction number,
which is about 6-7, at those days as shown in Fig. 8. As
of April 13, Rt has reached to around 2 and is still going
downward. Based on our 10 day prediction, the currently
infected cases will reach to the peak around April 21 with
about 107K cases. Fig. 9 shows the 5-day projected mean
errors. As we can see, as time progresses, the projected error
goes down and is limited to about 10% for the three types of
cases analyzed.

C. Analysis and prediction for United State
For US data, we show the results for US, New York state and
California state as New York is the epicenter of the COVID-19
in US. California has the largest population in US. The two
states also have dramatically different transmission situations.
Fig. 10 shows first modeling and projection for US from late
early March to middle July 2020 for the currently infected,
recovery and death cases. The results from the models match
the given data very well.
The effective reproduction numbers over the same time period and the relative projection errors are shown in Fig. 11 and
Fig. 12 respectively. As we can see, the effective reproduction
number seems higher than basic reproduction number, R0,
which was estimated about 2-7 for COVID-19 [14]. This may
reflect the significant portion of unconfirmed and asymptotic
population at the beginning of this outbreak in US (this is
the cases for all the other countries). But as time progresses,
Rt tends to level down to a more reasonable range as more
confirmed cases have been reported.
Fig. 13 and Fig. 14 show that daily newly confirmed infected
cases and daily death cases for US over the same period
respectively. The blue lines are the actual data and the brown
lines are projected data from April 13 to middle of July 2020.
We want to express that such projection is subject to change

D. Analysis and prediction for California state
For California, the modeling and projection results from the
same period of US are shown in Fig. 10, Fig. 16 and Fig. 17.
The effective reproduction number is around 5 as of April
13, which is close to the observed basic reproduction number
for COVID-19, estimated about 2-7 for COVID-19 [14].

VI. C ONCLUSION
In this paper, we have proposed a new real-time differential virus transmission model, which can give more accurate
and robust short-term predictions of COVID-19 transmitted
infectious disease with benefits for near-term trend projection.
The new model is based on enhanced Susceptible-ExposedInfected-Removed (SEIR) virus transmission model. As the
parameters of the improved SEIR models are trained by short
history window data for accurate trend prediction, our differential epidemic model, essentially are window-based timevarying SEIR model. Numerical results on the recent COVID19 data from China, Italy and US, California and New York
states have been analyzed.
A. Acknowledgment
The authors would like to thanks Dr. Cheynet for his opensourced SEIR model [5] and for his comments for our work,
which improves the presentation of the article.
