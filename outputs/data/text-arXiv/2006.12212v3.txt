Recent analysis of COVID-19 data from China showed that the number of confirmed cases followed
a subexponential power-law increase, with a growth exponent of around 2.2. The power-law behavior
was attributed to a combination of effective containment and mitigation measures employed as
well as behavioral changes by the population. In this work, we report a random walk Monte
Carlo simulation study of proximity-based infection spread. Social distancing is incorporated in the
simulations through a single parameter, the size of each step in the random walk process. The step
size l is taken to be a multiple of hri, which is the average separation between individuals. Three
temporal growth regimes (quadratic, intermediate power-law and exponential) are shown to emerge
naturally from our simulations. For l = hri, we get intermediate power-law growth exponents that
are in general agreement with available data from China. On the other hand, we obtain a quadratic
growth for smaller step sizes l . hri/2, while for large l the growth is found to be exponential.
Together with available data, these results suggest that the early containment of the disease within
China was close to optimal. We further performed a comparative case study of data from three
other countries, India, Brazil and South Africa. We show that reasonable agreement with these
data can be obtained by incorporating small-world-like connections in our simulations.

Introduction Following its outbreak in the Hubei
province of China, the global spread of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has reignited efforts to better
understand infection spread and mortality rates during
the pandemic. Significant emphasis was placed on modeling the spatio-temporal spread [1–3] of the disease, in
order to make reliable predictions. A key statistic in such
epidemiological analysis is the basic reproduction number R0 , which defines the expected number of secondary
cases from one infected individual in a completely susceptible population. Data from the early phase of the
COVID-19 outbreak showed good agreement with models that assumed an exponential growth of infections in
time (t), with a mean R0 ranging from 2.24 to 3.58 [4, 5].
However, subsequent laboratory confirmed cases in Hubei
showed that soon after the initial stage, the temporal
growth in the cumulative number of infections (N ) was
instead subexponential and agreed reasonably well with
a power-law scaling N ∝ tα [6]. This was consistent with
data from other affected regions in mainland China (with
α = 2.1 ± 0.3) and was attributed to a depletion of the
susceptible population due to effective containment and
mitigation strategies that were put in place and followed
after the initial unhindered outbreak [6].
A potential stumbling block in such analyses is that
the reported number of infected cases may be inaccurate, due to a non-uniform sampling of the entire susceptible population in a given region. In such a scenario
one can alternatively examine the number of reported
deaths (due to COVID-19 complications) as a function

of time. This is justified, as the number of deaths are
generally more accurately recorded and are always a fraction of the total infected population. Indeed, mortality
data from the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China and Health Commission of the
Hubei Province showed similar power-law behavior, with
an exponent α ≈ 2.2 [7] that agreed with the observations
in Ref. [6]. Independently, it has been proposed that the
near-quadratic power-law scaling of the cumulative number of deaths (infections) in China can be explained with
an extended epidemiological model that allows ‘peripheral spreading’ [8]. In this model, once infections are
identified in a location (labeled as a ‘hotspot’), and the
subpopulation from the region is isolated, the growth of
infections within this confined local community rises exponentially until no further infections are possible. Once
this saturation is reached, further spread of the disease
to outside the region is inevitable, due to interactions at
the periphery of the confined population. The growth of
infections due to such peripheral spreading is shown to
be quadratic in time and agrees piecewise with the data
from China [8].
In light of the above, we performed a random walk
based Monte Carlo simulation study to better understand
the spread of an infectious disease such as COVID-19,
with a particular emphasis on its temporal growth within
a constrained population. This work is particularly relevant at the present time, as many countries are bracing
for a second wave of COVID-19 infections. In fact, as
of June 15, a cluster of COVID-19 positive cases have
been reported from Beijing [9, 10], with a few confirmed
infections in other parts of mainland China as well [11].
Monte Carlo simulations Our simulations are based
on minimal prior assumptions and use a two-dimensional
random walk model, within which the individuals from

FIG. 1. Simulation results for three population sizes with a fixed number density of 10k/unit area. The simulations assume
that all random walkers take steps of length hri, their mean separation distance. The dashed lines are best-fit results for powerlaw growth N = Atα . The quoted uncertainty for each extracted α includes a ±1σ statistical uncertainty and a systematic
contribution. The latter were estimated by applying a conservative one channel shift to the data along the time axis and
redoing the fits.

an entire susceptible population are independent random
walkers. They are initially represented by uniformly distributed points in a given isolated region. The simulations begin with an initial condition of one infected
walker, assuming all other points are ‘normal’, yet 100%
susceptible. As the simulation progresses, each walker
takes steps in random directions, defined by a suitable
step size described below. The ‘spread’ of the disease is
said to occur whenever an infected point comes within a
‘touching’ distance from a ‘normal’ point, thereby passing on the disease. This assumption includes indirect
transmissions through infected surfaces, etc1 . An important aspect of the simulations is that in addition to their
spatial mobility, the incremental number of simultaneous
discrete steps taken by all random walkers quantifies time
progression. This allowed us to track the evolution of the
infection spread, in terms of growth in the number of infected points with respect to the number of ‘time-steps’
(t).

Our simulations also incorporate the possibility of having one
fraction of the population to immune to infection, while allowing
another fraction to recover from the disease, with a possibility of
reinfection. However we do not delve into these aspects here as
they are beyond the scope of the present work.

To put the above in perspective, for N randomly distributed points over area A, the mean distance of
p separation hri between any two random walkers is ∼ A/N .
Therefore, for a metropolis such as New York city, which
has a population density of ∼ 10,000/sq. km, hri is
∼10 m. For an arbitrarily sized region, given the fixed
population density, this would result in 10,000 points per
unit area, with hri = 10−2 length units and a maximum
‘touching’ separation of 2 × 10−3 units. The latter corresponds to ≤ 2 meters, which is the nominal safe distance
recommended in most countries. We discuss specific simulations and their results below.
Simulation set I (Fixed population density, fixed step
length, different population sizes): These simulations
investigated the spread of infection in the hypothetical metropolis mentioned above2 , assuming that each
walker’s mobility is constrained. This was imposed by
the condition that all members of the populace only take
steps of length l = hri, the average distance between
them. Effectively, l quantifies the social distancing aspect
in the simulation. The l = hri condition ensured that

FIG. 2. Simulated growth in the number of infections and
their best-fit curves, obtained for different step sizes taken by
the random walkers in a population of 2.5k/unit area. Below a threshold value of l ∼ hri/2, the growth is observed to
be nearly quadratic, regardless of the step size. The other
extreme shows exponential behavior, while power-law growth
similar to what was observed in China [6] lies in the intermediate regime.

the infection could only spread through ‘nearest neighbor’ interactions and that each random walker is on average confined within a local neighborhood. We performed
three such simulations for a fixed density of 10k/unit area
and three population sizes 10k, 6k and 2.5k respectively.
Simulation set II (Fixed population and density, different step lengths): In the next step we probed the dependence on both population density and l in five separate
simulations. These simulations assumed a smaller density of 2500 walkers/unit area, and different step sizes
for the walkers, with lengths hri/4, hri/3, hri/2, hri and
5hri. The results are discussed below and in Fig. 2.
Results and analysis In Fig. 1 we plot the growth
in the cumulative number of infected points, obtained
from simulation set I. The results show that independent
of population size, the number of infections follow a tα
power-law growth in time, with α about 2.2.
While
the power-law behavior may not be completely unexpected [13], it is interesting that we obtain very similar
values of near-quadratic exponents, as observed with the
data reported in Refs. [6, 7]. In simulation set II, for
step length hri, we determine almost identical power-law
growth as in Fig. 1, again in agreement with the observations of Refs. [6, 7]. This is shown3 in Fig. 2. Additionally, we also find that our extracted power-law exponents
are consistently similar for this step size, regardless of
the population density used. In comparison, if all members of the sample population were to take larger random

steps of length 5hri, on average interacting with points
located much further away than their nearest neighbors,
we find that the number of infected individuals blows up
rapidly, showing near exponential behavior. This would
be similar to a scenario where no control interventions are
in place or being followed. Not surprisingly, unlike the
more constrained random walk, the slope for exponential
growth is found to strongly depend on the population
density, and is larger at higher densities. Figure 2 also
shows the other extreme in terms of the temporal growth,
obtained using step sizes smaller than hri. As apparent
in the figure, the results from these simulations showed
quadratic growth, for all step sizes less than a threshold
value of around hri/2. This effectively implies a lowerbound on the growth exponent (α = 2), exactly as in the
case of peripheral spreading [8]. Furthermore, the effect
of social-distancing is clearly evident from the observed
delay in reaching the saturation value. A few important
takeaway points from the above analysis are: i) A steplength parameter of size hri reproduces the growth curves
from China reported in Refs. [6, 7]. ii) Under such condition, the growth exponent is found to be independent
of the population density. iii) On further restricting the
random walkers’ mobility by reducing their step sizes, we
observe that the slowest unavoidable temporal growth is
quadratic in nature. This is similar to peripheral growth,
proposed in Ref. [8]. iv) Since quadratic scaling appears
to be a limiting case, it seems unrealistic for a large population to achieve such growth. Therefore, at face value
the available data suggest that the containment measures
and response in the eight affected Chinese provinces mentioned in [6] were most likely optimal and could not have
been significantly improved upon any further.
Power-law, exponential growth and small-world-like
connections in observed data (India, Brazil and South
Africa) To make further comparisons, we examine the
daily growth in the cumulative number of deaths (which
is a fraction of the total infected population) reported [12]
for three countries, South Africa, India and Brazil. These
BRICS countries were not arbitrarily chosen, as they
present an interesting comparative study for several reasons. They face common challenges in terms of poverty
and economic inequality, and are home to some of the
most densely populated informal settlements in the world
(such as Khayelitsha in Cape Town, Dharavi in Mumbai
and the favelas of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo). The
lack of proper sanitation is a common theme in these impoverished city pockets, where, given the circumstances,
expecting the residents to follow strict social-distancing
protocols is a tall order [14–16]. Secondly, the response
of the political leadership of Brazil to the COVID-19 crisis was strikingly different from the governments of India
and South Africa. While the latter two countries swiftly
imposed extended periods of severe lockdown [17–20] beginning in the month of March, Brazil has thus far not
pursued a concerted policy for such containment [21]. As

FIG. 3. Cumulative number of deaths reported for India, South Africa and Brazil from the WHO, until June 1 [12]. The
fitted growth curves are shown together with their 95% C.L. bands. The Brazil and India data show a single growth-exponent,
consistent with power-law behavior. On the other hand the overall data for South Africa suggests exponential growth. Closer
inspection shows that the initial growth phase for South Africa was quadratic. The growth exponents are quoted in the insets
with ±1σ uncertainty.

While the observed growth exponent for the number
of fatalities in Brazil is not unexpected, how does one explain the higher-than-anticipated growth exponents for
South Africa and India? We show below that an extension to our model, along the lines of a small world
network [22, 23] can explain the observed growth. For
this, we took into consideration a more realistic lockdown scenario that includes a small number of outliers

of today Brazil is poised to become the epicenter of the
COVID-19 pandemic. The cumulative death data reported for the three countries, with their corresponding
fits are plotted in Fig. 3. While we do observe power-law
growths with exponents of of 2.76 ± 0.02 and 3.00 ± 0.02
for India and Brazil, the growth curve for South Africa
is surprisingly much steeper. As shown in its inset, the
growth was nearly quadratic for a significant portion of
the time, following which there is a steep exponential rise
starting around day 50 from March 28. It is worthwhile
to note at this point that the most stringent lockdown
measures (at Level 5) were imposed in South Africa until
May 1 [20]. The restrictions were only slightly relaxed
after that, to Level 4 during the month of May. Interestingly, the data show that the exponential growth begins
around May 17. Given that the coronavirus has an approximately two week incubation period, the above observation suggests that the two largely different growth
exponents for South Africa are most likely due to a modest containment of the disease under Level 4 lockdown.

If strict containment measures were not adhered to
by members of the population, it would correspond to
a combination of two effects in our random walk model:
(i) All the random walkers would travel longer distances
through larger step sizes. (ii) A small fraction of the population has much longer-ranged mobility compared to the
above. This establishes small world connections between
infected individuals and the rest of the susceptible population.
Our simulation results for an example city such as São
Paulo (with a population density of 7,200/unit area) are
shown in Fig. 4 For a uniform step length hri we determine a power-law exponent of 2.30 ± 0.06, again in agreement with our previous observations. On increasing the
step lengths of a randomized ensemble comprising 3% of
the city’s population to l = 5hri, we find that the exponent increases to 3.09 ± 0.08, very similar to the Brazil
data shown in Fig. 3. This clearly shows the contribution
of long distance movers to the spread of the pandemic. As
a matter of fact, it is well known that long-ranged travel
can dramatically accelerate the spread of infection [24].
The higher exponent for the data from India can be
explained similarly. Despite its best attempts, the country’s COVID-19 containment strategy was challenged by
the sheer scale and diversity of its population. For example, it is known that on several occasions people defied
social-distancing measures to attend religious gatherings
in large numbers [25, 26]. Furthermore, the sudden and
unprecedented lockdown in India resulted in a humanitarian crisis, with millions of daily wage inter-state migrant workers from the rural hinterland left jobless in
the big cities [27]. This led to a large-scale migration
back home for thousands of such families, many of them
traversing large distances of the country on foot [28, 29].
The exodus has only intensified with the relaxation of
restrictions in May. It is widely expected that the cumulative growth of infections in India will continue to
increase as the lockdown ended around June 1 [30]. A
similar rise is also expected for South Africa, as it moved
into a much more relaxed lockdown scenario (Level 3) on
June 1.
Recently, there have been several attempts to
fit the sigmoid-type curves for country specific
COVID-19 infections, with a generalized logistic function (see Ref. [31] and references therein) of type
N (t) = A(1 + Be−µt )1/(1−m) , that solves the Richards
differential equation [32]. We caution that such an approach can lead to inaccuracies, particularly when a containment policy is followed. It is clear that the expression for N (t) does not produce a linear relationship between ln N and ln t, as expected for (contained) powerlaw growth. This is manifest in the results of our simulations and validates our Monte Carlo random walk approach. To illustrate the above, we show in Fig. 5 simulation results for random walkers with both unconstrained
and constrained mobility, generated with step lengths

FIG. 5. Monte Carlo results for (A) exponential and (B) constrained growth (both with saturation) fitted to a generalized
logistic function N (t) = A(1 + Be−µt )1/(1−m) . The data are
the same as shown in Fig. 2

l = 5hri and hri respectively. While the generalized logistic function provides a reasonable fit for the unconstrained curve (exponential growth), a large discrepancy
is observed in the other (power-law) case, with significantly different values for the fit parameters. It is further
evident that for tα type power-law growth, the infection
rate dN/dt should be proportional to αtα−1 . This is also
supported by data. As an example, we show data corresponding to three-day averaged values for the reported
daily deaths from India and their corresponding powerlaw fit in the top panel of Fig. 6. As expected, we obtain a
growth exponent of β = α − 1 (for α = 2.8). The bottom
panel in the same figure shows a similar analysis performed for our simulated data, obtained for a population
of 6k and density of 10k/unit area. These data (which are
the same as presented in the central panel of Fig. 1) show
exactly the same behavior, with dN/dt following a tα−1
power-law increase. This observed consistency further
affirms the validity of our Monte Carlo method. Thus,
our general observations suggest that the growth curves
from effectively contained scenarios always ought to be
fitted accordingly, by including power-law behavior. This
supports the contention that constrained growth curves
from global COVID-19 data necessarily require epidemiological analyses that incorporate additional mechanisms,
similar to those described in Refs. [6, 8].
Summary and conclusions In summary, we used a
simple two-dimensional random walk Monte Carlo model
to study the spread of Covid-19-like infection within a
contained population. Apart from proximity based contact, our model has no underlying assumptions about the

As concluding remarks, we briefly mention the general
similarity between (i) peripheral growth, that requires
an extra spatial diffusion term [8] in the SIR model, (ii)
our simulation results for short step-lengths taken by the
random walkers, and (iii) the diffusion of particles to distinct sites on a two-dimensional lattice [33] at short timescales. All these cases show a quadratic growth in time.
We further observe that a simple logarithmic correction
to our quadratic results (so that t2 → t2 ln t) yields a
power-law exponent of about 2.5, in rough agreement
with the intermediate values for contained growth, both
described here and observed in Refs. [6, 7]. Further investigations into this potential connection present an interesting research problem for both epidemiologists and
physicists alike.

nature of infection spread or its reproduction number, recovery time etc. Three growth regimes, corresponding to
different levels of containment are shown to emerge naturally from our simulations. Under stringent conditions,
so that only nearest-neighbor connections are allowed,
our simulation results show a power-law growth in time,
with growth exponents α = 2.0 − 2.3, similar to initial
COVID-19 data from China [6]. Furthermore, the growth
appears to be consistent, with no apparent dependence
on population size or density. Based on available data,
this analysis suggests that the containment and mitigation strategies employed/followed in Chinese provinces
after the initial outbreak were near optimal and resulted
in growth exponents that were close to the smallest limiting value. On comparison with data from other countries,
we observe that reasonable agreement can be attained by
introducing small-world-type connections in the simulation model. We anticipate that such a Monte Carlo approach (and its more generalized versions) will be useful
for the evaluation of future strategies in the midst of the
present pandemic.
