ultiple studies have suggested the spread
of COVID-19 is affected by factors such as
climate, BCG vaccinations, pollution and
blood type. We perform a joint study of these
factors using the death growth rates of 40 regions worldwide with both machine learning and
Bayesian methods. We find weak, non-significant
(< 3σ) evidence for temperature and relative humidity as factors in the spread of COVID-19 but little or no evidence for BCG vaccination prevalence
or PM2.5 pollution. The only variable detected at
a statistically significant level (>3σ) is the rate of
positive COVID-19 tests, with higher positive rates
correlating with higher daily growth of deaths.

Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered extensive efforts to predict the severity of COVID-19 to aid in decision making around interventions such as lockdown
and the closure of schools 1 [1]. Regions hit hard by
the pandemic, such as Wuhan, Lombardy and New
York, where doubling times of 2-3 days and high crude
mortality rates stand in stark contrast to other countries only mildly affected such as Hong Kong, South
Korea and New Zealand.
Potential explanations for the apparent differences
in the transmissivity (encoded by the time-dependent
reproductive number, Rt ) and lethality (encoded by
the Infection Fatality Rate, IFR), currently fall into four

college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-CollegeCOVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf

broad categories. The first posits that differences are
largely fictitious, driven by the heterogeneity of testing
and reporting of cases and deaths; a known issue and
one that we are particularly concerned with in this
paper.
The next three categories posit that the differences
are primarily real and are driven by (1) cultural and
policy factors (swift lockdown, efficient contact tracing
and quarantining, use of masks, obedient populations
or social structures that are naturally distant or isolated), (2) local environmental factors (such as temperature and humidity variations, population density,
comorbid factors, vaccinations, vitamin D levels, blood
type etc...) or (3) existence of multiple strains with
different transmissibility or lethality [4]. Our primary
interest lies in disentangling the first category (testing) from a subset of potential factors in the second
category.
Finding the relative contributions of each of these
four categories is key in understanding and optimally
fighting the pandemic. The widely different testing
capabilities between countries, particularly between
the developed and developing world, imply that if not
correctly treated, testing variability will create spurious
evidence that can lead to false hope and sub-optimal
interventions.
In the wake of the spreading pandemic there have
been a host of studies that have examined the possible impact of climate [8]-[19], blood type [20, 21],
haplogroup [31], pollution [26]-[30] and BCG vaccination prevalence [22, 23, 24, 25] on the spread of
COVID-19. Our main conclusion is that testing issues
are significant and the factors above are likely not the
main causes of variability in growth rates of deaths

worldwide.
We note that both the basic reproductive number,
R0 , and the IFR will be affected by the four categories
above in general. However, since we do not currently
have access to the true number of infections we cannot
address the potential effect of environmental factors
on the IFR. Similarly the Case Fatality Rate cannot be
used for this purpose due to testing differences around
the world. We therefore focus on their potential effect
on R0 , which we quantify through the daily growth
rate of deaths of countries around the world for which
we have sufficiently good data.

Methodology

To explore the potential impact of climate (e.g. through
temperature, relative humidity and UV Index), BCG
vaccination prevalence, blood type and pollution
(PM2.5 ) on COVID-19, one must think carefully about
choice of both data and methodology.
We choose to focus on deaths instead of the number
of confirmed infections in the belief that these are significantly less affected by sampling and testing issues
than infection numbers: the number of tests per 1000
population (Tests/1k) currently varies by more than
three orders of magnitude across the world 2 , making
infection numbers highly biased and correlated with
confounding variables such as GDP and healthcare. In
countries with limited testing capability, only the more
severe patients are typically tested.
Since these are also the patients most likely to die, it
is likely that patients who die from COVID-19 are more
likely to be tested than typical COVID-19 sufferers, who
may be mostly asymptomatic. Without detailed knowledge of testing protocols in each country separating
out the effects of the factors of interest (climate, BCG
vaccination etc...) is extremely challenging. Although
deaths are not immune to testing issues, with many
missing deaths shown through excess mortality studies,
especially in overwhelmed medical systems [47, 48],
we argue that this is likely to be much less of an issue
in the first month after initial COVID-19 deaths, which
we focus on, since we are interested in R0 .
The second key choice is whether to focus on absolute death counts or growth rates. Absolute death
counts are also highly problematic. First, testing efficiencies may vary systematically from country to country. Second, the widely varying start dates of the pandemic in different countries are hard to deal with rigorously. As a result we focus on the daily growth rate
of deaths, Gc , for country c during the initial phase of
the epidemic. The initial daily growth correlates with
R0c , the base reproductive number in each country; in
simple models R0c = (1 + Gc )τ , where τ is the period
in days for which a person is infectious on average3 .
2 http://worldometers.info/coronavirus/
3 Hence

Gc = 0.3 and τ = 5 days yields R0 ' 3.7.

Separating out the true causes of variation in Gc or
R0c is still a highly complex problem, and we discuss
our approach in detail in the additional material in
section (5). Part of the complexity arises from the fact
that R0c depends explicitly both on properties of the
virus and on social factors (e.g. average number and
nature of contacts), as well as any of the other potential
factors we wish to study. Hence, we expect there to
be a large intrinsic variation in the growth of deaths
from country to country, driven e.g. by the average
number of people in a household, population density
[5] etc... that may correlate with, and hence lead
spurious evidence for, potential factors such as climate,
vaccination coverage, blood type and pollution.
We model this complexity by allowing each country,
c, to have its own unique base growth rate, denoted
G0c , that is estimated from its own data. This freedom
allows the model to account for the myriad unmodelled factors specific to each country (population density, GDP, culture, health care quality etc...). However,
we tie these base country growth rates, G0c , together
through a parent distribution, expressing the prior belief that there is a single dominant strain of COVID-19
globally.
Our primary goal in this study is to examine worldwide data to investigate whether climate and the BCG
vaccination prevalence are important drivers of COVID19 spread. Because of the danger of confounding variables we used the base growth rate, G0c for each country in a machine learning feature extraction algorithm
to pick the most important additional variables to include in our computationally intensive hierarchical
Bayesian analysis. This lead us to exclude PM2.5 pollution. In addition we undertook a separate analysis
including A+ blood type. The data for blood type came
from unpublished online sources and is therefore kept
separate since it is less trustworthy.
The remaining four most promising environmental
factors were Temperature (T, ◦ C), Relative Humidity
(RH, %), BCG vaccination coverage (BCG, %), UltraViolet Index (UVIndex); the latter included as a proxy
for vitamin D production. To this set we added two
testing-related variables to serve as diagnostics for potential contamination from testing issues: (1) the fraction of tests that return positive (Pos-Rate, %) and (2)
the number of tests per 1,000 population (Tests/1k),
yielding our final set of global parameters, Θ ≡ (T, RH,
BCG, UV, Pos-Rate, Tests/1k). Due to concerns over
data integrity, we study the impact of A+ blood type
separately in section (5.4.1).
We then explicitly fit for Θ using our sample of 40
regions in 37 countries for which there is data for all of
the parameters in Θ. We cannot use all the death data
for countries since a constant growth rate model fails
quickly for most countries due to Non-Pharmaceutical
Interventions (NPIs) or nonlinear effects. To address
this we extract the initial pure exponential part of the
data on a country-by-country basis, as illustrated in
Fig. (1) and discussed in detail in section (5), which is
Page 2 of 17

Climate & BCG: Effects on COVID-19 Death Growth Rates

the only data we use in our main analysis.
The early phase death data for each country c, Dc (t),
are then fit to the model:

t 
Y
Dc (t) = D0c
1 + β{G0c + Θ · Xc }
(1)
τ =1

where β = 10−2 converts our growths to percentages
and the Xc are the country-specific data corresponding
to Θ.
We use a hierarchical Bayesian analysis in which
each country’s growth rate is drawn from a parent distribution which allows each country’s base growth rate,
G0c , to be intrinsically different rather than forcing
any differences to be due only to the parameters in the
factors encoded by Θ.

Figure 1: Example fit to the log of deaths vs time for India,
showing how we select the initial linear part of the
logarithmic data for inclusion in our analysis. Data
are shown as blue points. Data covered by red fits
are those used in our main analysis, in this case at
t0c ≤ 22 days after reaching three deaths. Green
samples are drawn from the 5d sigmoid model which
covers all the data and models the changes in the
growth rate due to social interventions or nonlinear
effects. This is one of the 40 countries/provinces in
our analysis; the full set is shown in Fig. (9).

We use Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) methods to simultaneously fit the base growth rates, G0c ,
for all countries, our parameters of interest, Θ, and
the parent distribution hyperpriors, implying a large
Bayesian hierarchical model with 90 parameters in total. After marginalising over all country growth rates
and parent distribution parameters, we are left with
the marginal distributions on the Θ, our parameters
of interest, providing our main results.
We assess the importance of each of the Θ parameters both through standard model selection metrics
such as the Bayesian evidence and Bayesian Information Criterion (see Table 1) and by computing the statistical significance with which the parameters deviate
from zero in the marginalised posterior chains. We
now discuss these results.

Results and Discussion

Figure (4) shows the main results of our paper: only
the parameter associated to the positive rate or fraction
of tests (Pos-Rate) is non-zero at more than 3σ. This
result is stable to significant changes in our priors and
hyperpriors and to including or removing the other
parameters in Θ in the analysis. In addition, the positive rate is selected as the most important variable by
all model-selection metrics (see Table 1) and by our
machine learning analysis, section (5.5). A plot of regional death growth rates versus positive rate is shown
in Fig. (2) showing the clear correlation.
The simplest explanation of this result is that regions
that experience the most rapid spread of the disease,
i.e. those with the largest R0 , were also the regions
that were least able to keep up with testing demands
and hence where the rate of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests used for COVID-19 returning positive
were the highest on average. This is then not a cause,
but rather a result of, high growth rate. We find that
Pos-Rate correlates positively with Tests per 1000 population (see Fig. 10): high death growth rate and
growing positive rate likely spurred increased testing.
Neither of these observations help us identify the cause
of increased death growth rates, however.
Temperature is the only other variable which is nonzero at more than 2σ in our multivariate fits (see section 5.4.3 for more discussion) and relative humidity
the only other parameter non-zero at more than 1.5σ,
providing some weak evidence for climatic impact on
the spread of the disease. Increasing temperature and
humidity tends to decrease the spread of COVID-19,
in agreement with previous studies.
In our model-selection metrics, where we compare
fits with one variable at a time, relative humidity is
preferred over temperature by the Akaike Information
Criteria (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC)
and is the only variable other than Pos-Rate, that has a
BIC value more than 2 units lower than the No Factor
model (which has Θ = 0)4 . The remaining parameters have poor or mixed results relative to the No
Factor model, and all perform very poorly relative to
the model with just the positive rate.
In particular, our regression and machine learning
analyses provide no evidence in support of BCG fraction. This is not surprising if we look at figure (3)
which plots regional death growth rates versus BCG
coverage: there is no discernible correlation. Our results are therefore in agreement with [24, 25]. Further
we do not find any correlation between UV index and
death growth rate. This is pertinent since UV index is
relevant to natural production of vitamin D [38] and
vitamin D has been suggested as a protective factor
against the spread of the disease [35, 36, 37],
Now we briefly discuss results for the other testing

[40].

variable, Tests / 1k. We find that this is not a significant correlate of growth rate. This is perhaps not
unexpected. If testing efficiency in each country is approximately constant, i.e. the rate of true infections
detected changes only slowly with time, then this has
little impact on the growth rate of deaths. It is only if
the testing efficiency varies rapidly with time that we
would expect this to be significant. Our results suggest
that this was not the case, at least within the initial
phase of the epidemic in each countries. Neither the
Bayesian, nor the machine learning analyses found the
number of tests per 1000 population to be significant.
We present technical details of the data, algorithms
and analysis in section (5).

Figure 3: BCG population coverage estimate against our estimated base growth rates. We see that there is
no clear trend with increasing BCG coverage. The
growth rates with error bars are taken from our No
Factors model fit.

Figure 2: The growth rates with errorbars for the 40 regions
taken from our No Factor model plotted against the
positive rate data, are shown in blue. The red lines
are posterior samples from the univariate positive
rate model. The intercept was taken to be the parent level mean of the growth rate and the slope is
the coefficient for positive rate of the same model;
showing why this variable is detected at 3σ.

Finally, in our separate analysis of blood types discussed in sections 5.4.1 and 5.5 we analyse the potential correlation of blood type with growth rate. We find
marginal evidence for A+ blood type being relevant,
subject to the caveats discussed in section (5.4.1).
How should our results be taken in the context of the
many claims of climate, blood, BCG etc... being significant factors in COVID-19 spread? First, many studies
were based on confirmed COVID-19 test cases which,
as we discussed earlier, are affected by differences in
testing capability and protocols between countries.
Secondly, many of the studies present regressions
that do not allow for unmodelled confounding sources
of variation in the growth. Hence, if a country shows
high growth the algorithm will try to force one of the
potential factors under study to explain it. Instead
the hierarchical Bayesian framework allows the base
growth rate of each country to be different, and hence
potential factors will only be given credit for the difference in the growth rate if they provide a genuinely

better fit.
Further, many studies do not model the intrinsic
uncertainties associated with the data as we have done.
We too find that the best-fits are non-zero (as can be
seen by looking at the peaks of the posteriors in Figure
(4) or at the last rows of Table (6). Hence our results
are not in disagreement with regression results, the
issue is about the statistical significance of such claims.
Finally, although we do not detect environmental
factors at more than 3σ, it is interesting to examine
how big the environmental factors would be if our bestfit parameter values describe reality: a 15◦ C increase
(decrease) in temperature implies a 5.25% decrease
(increase) in the base daily growth rate while a increase (decrease) of 20% in relative humidity would
mean a 2.24% decrease (increase) in base daily growth
rate. The decreased spread at higher temperature and
humidity agrees with previous work [9].
This may not seem significant, but for a city such as
Johannesburg, where both temperature and humidity
drop significantly in winter, the combined effect could
add more than 5% to the base daily growth rate. For a
daily growth rate of 5%, which was approximately the
value in May 2020, this would halve the doubling time
of the disease, a significant impact.

Conclusions

Contrary to previous claims our analysis of growth rates
for deaths from countries worldwide are consistent
with no effect from climate, pollution or BCG vaccination. The only significant correlation detected is with
the positive rate of tests: a country that intrinsically had
a high R0 (due to high population density etc...), would
naturally tend to be more overwhelmed and hence run
Page 4 of 17

Climate & BCG: Effects on COVID-19 Death Growth Rates

low on testing kits earlier, leading to increased fraction
of positive tests. We did find some weak suggestive evidence, at < 3σ, that temperature and relative humidity
correlate with death growth rates.
A separate analysis of blood type data shows that
A+ type is the most important blood type, though
the significance is marginal, both because the data
quality is low and the statistical significance is weak.
Our combined statistical and machine learning analysis
finds no evidence for PM2.5 pollution, other blood types
or UV Index as drivers of COVID-19.
More data could be obtained by dropping the requirement that all countries in the sample have data
for all the potential factors, which could potentially
allow for some of the effects to be detected at higher
statistical significance but at the cost of making model
comparison significantly more difficult.
The data and code for our Bayesian analysis is available at https://github.com/chrisfinlay/covid19/.

factors, the model with all factors and a model with
all factors excluding the two testing factors (Positive
Rate and Tests / 1k). The Positive Rate is unanimously
selected as the most important feature, followed by
the Relative Humidity. Temperature does not perform
well here but this is not surprising: the statistical
significance of the temperature increased by 0.84σ in
the joint multivariate fit relative to the univariate fit
alone.A similar increase in significance is visible for
the Relative Humidity; see Fig. (4). Note that the
model including the two testing parameters (All Incl.
Tests) outperforms the model excluding the testing
parameters, reinforcing the fact that testing is important. A+ blood type results are presented separately
in section (5.4.1).

to the univariate fits where they are fit alone. Both BCG and UV Index are consistent with no effect.

Data on deaths

We chose to look at the growth rate in deaths as they
are less likely than confirmed cases to be affected by
the widely varying testing protocols between countries.
The cumulative death data for each country comes

from the Centre for Systems Science and Engineering
(CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) [44].
We cannot, however, take all data on deaths for all
times since it is clear that a simple exponential model
fails quickly: as soon as interventions occur the simple
exponential model fails and we will obtain contaminated estimates of the growth rate due to the flattening
of the curve which will skew our analysis; see e.g. Fig.
(1). As a result we want to know which data should be
Page 6 of 17

Climate & BCG: Effects on COVID-19 Death Growth Rates

included in our analysis for each country. This reduces
to knowing the time, t0c , at which the growth of deaths
deviates from a simple exponential. We then only use
data at t < t0c for country c.
Doing this cut by hand introduces the possibility of
human bias. Instead we compute t0c for each country
by fitting a non-linear sigmoid transition function to
the growth rate of the death data of each country over
time:
1


σc (t; t0c , αc ) =
(2)
1 + exp − αc (t − t0c )
This function allows the growth rate to smoothly transition from an initial value (which we are interested
in) to a final value, reflecting the impact of social interventions or nonlinearity in the system.
In this first phase of the analysis each country, c,
therefore has 5 parameters (D0c , G0c , δGc , αc , t0c ) to
describe the trajectory of its deaths, where δGc and αc
represent the change in growth rate and suddenness
of the transition with time from G0c to G0c + δGc for
each country, c (the index, c, has been left out in Eq.
(3) below):
D(t; D0 , G0 , δG, α, t0 ) = D0

t
Y


G0 + δG · σ(τ ; t0 , α)

τ =1

(3)
To maximise the probability that this is a good fit to the
data the non-linear model in Eq. (3) we only consider
data up to the time when a country passes 1000 deaths.
All five parameters are treated hierarchically with their
own parent distribution where the means are Normally
distributed and the standard deviation is Half Normal
distributed.
We only use data from t < t0c in our main analysis
(see section 5.2), where t0c is given by the marginalised
mean from the chains. Typical values for t0c were
around 15 days. We excluded countries where t0c < 10
because of concerns about quality of the underlying
model fit in such cases, i.e. a simple exponential model
was not a good fit even at early times which could lead
to spurious growth rates.
The resulting fits to country death data for both the
full 5-d model (green) and just the region t < t0c
are given in Figure (9), showing that the technique
performs well in isolating the initial exponential growth
from a first-principles approach.
Once we have t0c for each country we further cut
our data by using the following rules:
• We only use countries for which there were a minimum of 20 deaths by 25 April 2020.
• We choose day zero as the first day a country
passes 3 deaths. This leads to typical starting
numbers of deaths of around 5.
• Data for our variables of interest (Climate, BCG,
etc...) were not available for all countries. To
ensure the same amount of data for all models
only countries with data for all our parameters in
Θ were included.

We did not model the potential correlations and interactions of our parameters with these data cuts. This
could potentially alter our conclusions: if a parameter were extremely important in determining growth
rates, then countries with very small numbers of deaths
would systematically not make it past our data cuts and
hence the signal from that data would be lost. However,
it is unclear how to model this censorship rigorously
and it is left to future work.
After these data cuts we were left with 40 provinces
in 37 countries with 613 data points in total, shown
in Figure (9). The only country with more than one
province was Canada which include Alberta, Ontario,
Quebec and British Columbia (BC).
5.1.2

Climate Data

For each region and country the climate data was gathered from the Dark Sky API, [43], where the locations
sampled are taken from the latitudes and longitudes
given for each country or region in the JHU COVID-19
data. For each country, c, the mean temperature, mean
relative humidity and mean UV Index are calculated as
an average over a N day window starting 28 days prior
to day 0 for each region, where N is the number of days
of deaths data for that country. The latter is chosen
as an estimate of the average time from infection to
death 5 . Since mean climate variables change relatively
slowly the exact delay is not important. See Fig (9) for
the distribution of t0c times. We used UV Index as a
proxy for natural vitamin D production. Data for all
regions and countries is shown in Table (5).
5.1.3

BCG Vaccine Coverage

Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccination policies
have been in place in many countries across the world
starting from widely differing start dates. We would
like to estimate the percentage of the population in
each country that has received a BCG vaccine in their
lifetime. For this purpose we need the age demographics of each country as well as the dates when BCG
vaccinations became/stopped being mandatory.
To estimate the percentage of the population vaccinated by BCG we need to draw on three sources of
data. These are the BCG Atlas, World Health Organisation (WHO) BCG vaccination rates amongst 1-year olds
and the age demographics for each country from the
United Nations (UN). Firstly we looked to the BCG Atlas [45]. This is a heterogeneous dataset which implies
that not all information was available for each country.
We collected the following fields from the BCG Atlas:
1.
2.
3.
4.

Current BCG vaccination?
Which year was vaccination introduced?
Year BCG stopped?
Year of changes to BCG schedule

5. Details of changes
6. BCG coverage (%)
We did not use the last field directly due to missing
information on this field, specifically if it was for a small
age range of the population or its entirety. For some
countries data was missing from fields 1-3. In these
cases, where appropriate and possible, the missing data
was obtained from fields 4 and 5.
Age demographics for each country were used to
compute the expected fraction of the population who
have had the BCG vaccination. In 15% of cases the
BCG Atlas did not have data and we instead used WHO
data [6] to perform the estimate. The derived BCG
fractions and the origin of the data, are shown in Table
(2) while a plot of the BCG fractions versus growth
rates are shown in Fig. (3).
There is one caveat here: our BCG coverage is the
estimate of the percentage of the population of each
region and country that has had the BCG vaccination.
This is arguably not the optimal quantity to use in our
analyses however; it might be better to use the fraction
of vaccinated population weighted by the probability
of infection as a function of age. However, the latter is
currently unknown and hard to compute even in the
best of situations: how can we know how many people
were exposed but never got infected? The large scatter
in Figure (3) suggests that this is unlikely to make
a significant difference to our conclusions that BCG
vaccine is not important in the spread of COVID-19.
5.1.4

Additional data

Data on prevalence of blood type for each country was
taken from [32, 33] while PM2.5 pollution data came
from [34]. We discuss the blood type data and results
in section (5.4.1).

Model

As described earlier our basic regression model for the
deaths in country c at day t is:
Dc (t) = D0c

t 
Y
τ =1

1+

Gc
100



(4)

which is assumed valid for T ≤ t0c , as described before.
Gc is measured in percent and we model it’s potential
dependence on our variables of interest as:
Gc (Θ) = G0c + Θ · Xc

(5)

where G0c and Xc are the country-specific base growth
rate and data for climate, BCG etc..., shown in Table
(5) and Θ are the global parameters we are interested
in. In general the Xc could be time-dependent. In this
analysis, because of missing data and the fact that our
data for each region typically spans a short period (t0c
is less then 3 weeks as discussed in section 5.1.1), we
use average values for Xc .

disease will depend both on properties of the disease
(which are universal), and properties specific to each
country (e.g. culture and population density) it is natural to model the data with a hierarchical Bayesian
structure which allows growth rates to vary somewhat
from country to country but to also be somewhat similar between countries.
The priors and hyperpriors for each variable to be
estimated is chosen to be:

Rectangles with rounded corners represent parameters in the model with their priors shown as normal or half normal distributions with their respective parameters. Diamonds are fixed inputs/data.
Squares represent repetition plates with repeated
variables with index given in the top-left corner of
the plate. D̃(t)c are the observed deaths for country
c on day t.

• µD0 ∼ N (7, 32 ); the hyperprior for the mean on
the prior for initial deaths, D0c , for each country
(D0c > 3 as part of our data cuts).
• σD0 ∼ Half Normal(3); the standard deviation on
the prior for initial deaths for each country.
• µG0 ∼ N (20, 202 ); the mean (in percent) on the
prior for the growth rate of each country, G0c .
• σG0 ∼ Half Normal(20); the standard deviation
on the prior for the growth rate of each country.

• D0c ∼ N (µD0 , σD
), the prior on the initial deaths
0
parameter for each country, c. All countries together will be denoted by D0 .
2
• G0c ∼ N (µG0 , σG
); the prior on the growth rate
0
parameter for each country, c. All countries together will be denoted by G0 .
• Θ ∼ N (0, I); the prior on the vector of parameters
of key interest.
The complete vector of all parameters is therefore:

Our goal is to determine if any of the parameters
Θ are rigorously required to be non-zero by the data.
One limitation of Eq. (5) is that it is linear in the
country data Xc . We justify this by noting that the
growth rates and the underlying data vary over narrow
ranges, so that retaining only the linear terms in the
Taylor series expansion of Gc (Θ) is a reasonable step.
For the temperature variables we have verified that
assuming instead a step change in the growth at around
10◦ C with two hierarchical growth parameters, one on
each side of the step, did not lead to any increase
in significance in the detection of temperature as an
effect.

5.3

Posterior model and sampling

We write a hierarchical Bayesian probabilistic model by
assuming a Poisson likelihood, suitable for count data,
with mean given by the deterministic forward model
defined in Eq. (5), together with priors and hyperpriors
for all our 90 parameters, as shown in the schematic
graphical representation in Fig. (5); see e.g. [39].
We do not try to model missing deaths due to testing
irregularities. As long as the fraction of missing deaths
remains approximately constant in the early phase of
the spread within the country that we consider this
should have little impact on our results.
Since our data covers 37 countries and 40 provinces
worldwide and we know that the growth rate of the

The joint prior over our full set of parameters is assumed factorizable, i.e. a product of the prior distributions listed above.
We assume our data to be statistically independent
both between countries and from day-to-day. Our
model simultaneously fits the death data from all countries. We use NumPyro[42] for Monte Carlo Markov
Chain (MCMC) probabilistic sampling from our posterior using the No U-Turn Sampling (NUTS) algorithm
[41]. NumPyro has diagnostic tools built in and allows
for easy running on accelerators, such as GPUs, which
were key in being able to iterate quickly through our
many models including all the multivariate and univariate combinations, as well as looking at the effect
of priors.
The MCMC simulations were generally run as 4 independent chains with each chain starting from a random
position sampled from the prior for our parameters
and run for 2000 steps in order for length scales (and
other sampling options) to be determined automatically by NumPyro. After this initial “burn-in" each chain
was typically run for 5000 samples. Chains were long
enough to ensure that the Gelman-Rubin convergence
test was always less than 1.01.
Each chain was then thinned by a factor of two in order to further improve independence of samples. This
leads to the final 10k samples collected for each model
and led to good, converged, trace plots and posteriors;

see Fig. (4). We used ChainConsumer6 for the analysis
of the chains, the model selection metrics in Table (1)
and some of the plots [51].

Additional Bayesian Results
A+ Blood Type Analysis

The data for blood type prevalence comes from online heterogeneous collections of published and unpublished data sources covering a wide range of publication
dates. As a result, data integrity is an issue and we
have chosen to separate the blood analysis from our
main Bayesian analysis.
A random forest analysis finds only A+ blood type as
potentially relevant amongst the different ABO blood
types (see section 5.5). Here we present the results
of both univariate and multivariate A+ blood type
Bayesian analyses using the formalism described in
section (5.2).
Fig. (6) shows the result of the Bayesian analysis for
the A+ blood type coefficient: it is consistent with zero
in both the univariate and multivariate cases. If we
look at the AIC, BIC and DIC for A+ blood type we find
values of: (10.7, 10.7, 23.4) compared to the no-factor
models results of (15.3, 11.6, 22.9). The A+ AIC and
BIC are better than the no-factor model, but the DIC
value is worse. In addition, the random forest analysis
found A+ blood type to be more important than both
BCG and and Tests/1k.
As a result we conclude that there is somewhat conflicting evidence regarding the potential effect of A+
blood type, but that none of the evidence is strong.

5.4.2

In the results section we focused on the best-fit values of
Θ. The reverse question is interesting too: what is the
impact of including the Θ parameters on the hyperprior
parameters, mean, µG0 , and standard deviation, σG0 ,
of the base growth rates, G0c , for the 40 regions? If the
Θ do explain some of the variation we would expect
the standard deviation on the base growth rate (parent
distribution) to get smaller, which is captured by the
hyperparameter σG0 . The mean of the base growth
rates (parent distribution), given by µG0 , are nothing
more than an offset dictating the value when all factors
are zero i.e. Θ = 0.
This is what we see: in the No-Factor model σG0 =
7.9% which changes to 6.3% when we allow all the Θ to
vary, a significant shrinkage. On the other hand, if we
include all parameters except for the two testing parameters, σG0 returns to 7.9%, while σG0 = 6.7%(7.7%)
when we add the positive rate (Tests/1k) parameters
alone; showing that it is primarily the positive rate
parameter that drives the shrinkage in the uncertainty
in the parent distribution on the base growth rates.
5.4.3

Comparison of univariate and multivariate
fits

To assess the stability of our results we fit each of our
key parameters in Θ both alone (univariate) and simultaneously with all the other parameters (multivariate).
As shown in Table (3) and Fig. (4), the results are
quite stable. Positive rate and temperature are the
still the most significantly parameters in both cases:
the positive rate is non-zero at more than 3σ in both
cases while the significance for temperature increases
from 1.45σ to 2.19σ when going from the univariate
to multivariate fit. Relative Humidity also increases in
significance in the multivariate case.
To access correlations between parameters we show
in Fig. (10) the one and two-dimensional marginalised
posterior plots. Correlations are typically small, though
there are is some small positive correlation between
Tests per 1k and Positive Rate, and a small negative
correlation between Temperature and UV Index.
Our full results for all the hyperpriors, the base country growth rates, G0c and the Θ parameters for each
of the different univariate and multivariate models are
shown in Table (6).
5.4.4

Figure 6: The univariate and multivariate results for the coefficient of A+ blood type are consistent with zero,
i.e. no effect.

Effect of Θ on Base Parameters

Varying Hyperpriors

Since our goal in this analysis is to assess whether there
is evidence for external factors such as climate, blood
type etc... in addition to known country-specific factors,
an important internal check is to look for potential
sensitivity to our priors and hyperpriors.
In our hierarchical analysis, data for each country
tries to pull the measured growth rates of countries to
their own best-fit values, while the hierarchical nature

of our model described in section (5.3) attempts to pull
them all together. Between this tug of war, the algorithm searches for joint values of Θ that will improve
the fits to all the data. One concern might be that if we
make the hyperpriors on the parent distributions much
stronger or much weaker, we allow the algorithm to
given less or more freedom to the base growth rates
G0c which in turn may affect the best-fit parameters
Θ and our main conclusions.
To test this we tightened the following hyperpriors
and priors listed in section (5.3) by an order of magnitude to:
• µG0 ∼ N (20, 22 ); the mean (in percent) on the
prior for the growth rate of each country, G0c .
• σG0 ∼ Half Normal(2); the standard deviation on
the prior for the growth rate of each country.
• Θ ∼ N (0, 0.1); the prior on the vector of parameters of key interest.
The results of these changes are shown in Fig. (8).
As expected tightening the prior on the Θ pulled most
parameters slightly closer to zero but also tighten the
posterior so that none of our conclusions were altered:
the statistical significance of all variables was unaltered.

To undertake the random forest regression we used
the results from our No-Factor Bayesian run (i.e. Θ =
0) to obtain the base growth rates G0c for each country
and used these as the target for the random forest
regression with the Xc data as features. In the random
forest analysis we augmented the data both with PM2.5
pollution and extra blood types data (namely A–, AB+,
O–, AB–, B–).
Feature selection was done using the standard Random Forest impurity method[52] and by ranking variables by the impact they had on the average RootMean-Square-Error (RMSE) of the regression: leaving
out important explanatory variables is expected to significantly degrade the performance of the algorithm,
leaving out irrelevant features does not. All feature importance scores were averages over 500 random 70-30
training-test splits of the data. We found that the only
variables that made more than one percent difference
to the RMSE value were the Postive Rate (3.98%) and
A+ (2.28%). This lead us to select A+ blood type as a
variable in our separate full Bayesian analysis shown
in section (5.4.1).
The results from the impurity-based feature selection are shown in Table (4). Again Positive Rate and A+
were the most significant features, followed by Tests
per 1k and BCG vaccine coverage, PM2.5 and the other
blood types at significantly less importance. As a result blood types, other than A+, were not included in
the Bayesian analysis since additional parameters significantly increased the computational complexity of
the analysis, both because of increased time to convergence and an increase in the number of models to run
(since we fit both multivariate and univariate models
in all cases). The distribution of a selection of feature
importances is shown in Fig. (7)
In summary the machine learning analysis confirms,
to the extent that they overlap, the results of our much
more intensive Bayesian analysis: Positive Rate is the
most important feature, followed by A+ (subject to the
caveats discussed in section (5.4.1), while BCG is not
relevant.

Machine Learning Analysis

To provide a largely independent test of our Bayesian
results we also undertook a machine learning analysis of the deaths data using random forest regression
[52]. Random forests are a powerful ensemble method
that naturally provide feature selection capability, and
are hundreds of times faster to run than our computationally intensive hierarchical Bayesian framework.
While random forest does not provide estimates of statistical significance of factors it does allow us to rank
additional factors in terms of importance and hence to
explore the potential of additional explanatory features
for inclusion in the main set of parameters, Θ, for the
Bayesian analysis.

Table 5: Factor data, Xc for all regions and countries in our study. The columns are BCG fraction, temperature (T), relative
humidity (RH), tests per 1000 population (Tests/1k), positive test rate (Pos-Rate), A+ blood type prevalence and UV
Index (UV). We analyse blood type separately as discussed in section (5.4.1).

Figure 9: Example fits to all 40 regions from 37 countries in our data sample. Posterior samples from the simple exponential
model is shown in red, plotted up to the cutoff date, showing the data we use in our analysis. The full model with time
varying growth rate is shown in green while data points are shown in blue. Only the USA had an exponent larger after
t0c than before.

Figure 10: 1, 2 and 3-σ contours from the marginalised posterior samples of the parameters Θ showing that most parameters are
weakly correlated aside from one positive (Pos-Rate & Tests/1k) and one negative (Temp & UVIndex) correlation. Zero
values for the parameters are shown by dashed lines to help assess statistical significance.
