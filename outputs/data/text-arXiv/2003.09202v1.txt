Abstract
The main goal of this work is to present a new model able to deal with potentially misreported continuous time series.
The proposed model is able to handle the autocorrelation structure in continuous time series data, which might be
partially or totally underreported or overreported. Its performance is illustrated through a comprehensive simulation
study considering several autocorrelation structures and two real data applications on human papillomavirus incidence
in Girona (Catalunya, Spain) and COVID-19 incidence in the Chinese region of Heilongjiang.

Introduction
There is a growing interest in the last years to deal with
data that is only partially registered or underreported in the
time series literature. This phenomenon is very common in
many fields, and has been previously explored by different
approaches in epidemiology, social and biomedical research
among many other contexts 1–5 . The sources and underlying
mechanisms that cause the underreporting might differ
depending on the particular data. Some authors consider
a situation where the registry is updated with time and
therefore the underreporting issue is mitigated 6. That leads
to temporary underreporting while this work is focused on
permanent underreporting, where the registered data are
never updated in order to become more accurate. From the
methodological point of view, several alternatives have been
explored, from Markov chain Monte-Carlo based methods 5
to recent discrete time series approaches 7,8 and several
attempts to estimate the degree of underreporting in several
contexts have been done 9 , although there is a lack of models
incorporating continuous time series structures and handling
underreporting.
One of the fields where the interest in addressing the
underreporting issues is higher is the epidemiology of
infectious diseases. In the last few years, many approaches
to deal with underreported data have been suggested
with a growing level of sophistication from the usage of
multiplication factors 10 to several Markov-based models 11,12
or even spatio-temporal modelling 13 . Even a new R 14
package able to fitting endemic-epidemic models based on
approximative maximum likelihood to underreported count
data has been recently published 15 .
Human papillomavirus (HPV) is one of the most prevalent
sexually transmitted infections. It is so common that nearly
all sexually active people have it at some point in their
lives, according to the information provided by the Centre
of Control of Diseases (CDC) 16 . Generally, the infection
disappears on its own without inducing any health problem,
but in some cases it can produce an abnormal growth of

cells on the surface of the cervix that could potentially
lead to cervical cancer. HPV infection is also related to
several cancers (cervical, vulva, vagina, penis, anus, . . . )
and other diseases like genital warts (GW). The fact that
most cases of HPV infection are asymptomatic causes that
public health registries might be potentially underestimating
its incidence. The underreporting phenomenon in HPV data
from the discrete time series point of view has been recently
studied 7 .
There is an enormous global concern around 2019novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection in the last few
months, leading the World Health Organization (WHO)
to declare public health emergency 17. As the symptoms
of this infection can be easily confused with those of
similar diseases like Middle East Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) or Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), its incidence has been
notably underreported, especially at the beginning of the
outbreak in Wuhan (Hubei province, China) by December
2019.
The characteristics of the proposed model and the
methodology to estimate the parameters are detailed
in Section Model definition. The application of the
model on the HPV incidence data in Girona (Catalunya,
Spain) in the period 2010-2014 is illustrated in Section

Example: Coronavirus COVID-19 incidence in the region of
Heilongjiang. Finally the results of a thorough simulation
study are summarised in Section Simulation study.

Model definition
Consider an unobservable process with an AutoRegressive
Moving Average (ARM A(p, r)) structure defined by
Xt = α1 Xt−1 + . . . + αp Xt−p + θ1 ǫt−1 + . . . +
+θr ǫt−r + ǫt ,

(i) Following Eq. (2), the observed process Yt can be
written as Yt = (1 − Zt ) · Xt + q · Zt · Xt , where Zt
is an indicator of the underreported observations,
following a Bernoulli distribution with probability of
success ω (Zt ∼ Bern(ω)), its marginal distribution
is a mixture
of two normal

 random variables
N µ, σ 2 and N q · µ, q 2 · σ 2 respectively, where
σ2 ·(1+θ 2 +...+θ 2 )

where ǫt is a Gaussian white noise process with ǫt ∼
N (µǫ , σǫ2 ). In our setting, this process cannot be directly
observed, and all we can see is a part of it, expressed as

Xt with probability 1 − ω
Yt =
(2)
q · Xt with probability ω
The interpretation of the parameters in Eq. (2) is
straightforward: q is the overall intensity of misreporting (if
0 < q < 1 the observed process Yt would be underreported
while if q > 1 the observed process Yt would be
overreported). The parameter ω can be interpreted as the
overall frequency of misreporting (proportion of misreported
observations).

Consider that the unobserved process Xt follows an
ARM A(p, r) model as defined in Eq. (1). As can be
seen in Appendix 1, the observed process has mean

autocorrelation function of the observed process can be

(3)
where ρX is the autocorrelation function of the unobserved
process Xt .
A situation of particular interest is the case ω = 1,
meaning that all the observations might be underreported and
that a simpler model for Yt excluding the parameter ω might
be suitable
Yt = q · Xt .
(4)
In this case, however, the observed process Yt would be
a non-identifiable ARM A(p, r) as parameter q could not be
estimated on the basis of the methodology described in the
following section.

Estimation
The likelihood function of the observed process Yt is not
easily computable but the parameters of the model can
be estimated by means of an iterative algorithm based on
its marginal distribution, using R packages mixtools 18 and
forecast 19,20 . The main steps are described in detail below:

can be used to obtain initial estimates for q and
ω. Using the E-M algorithm (specifically on the Estep), the package mixtools calculates the posterior
probabilities (conditional on the data and the obtained
estimates) of each observation to come from one of
these two normals.
Using the indicator Ẑt obtained in the previous
step, the series is divided in two: One including
the underreported observations (treating the nonunderreported values as missing data) and another
with the non underreported observations (treating the
underreported values as missing data). An ARIM A
model is fitted to each of these two series and a new q̂
is obtained by dividing the fitted means.
A mixture of two normals is fitted to the observed
series Yt with mean and standard deviation fixed to the
corresponding values obtained from the previous step,
and a new ω is estimated.
Steps (ii) and (iii) are repeated until the quadratic
distance between two consecutive
iterations (q̂i −
P
q̂i−1 )2 + (ω̂i − ω̂i−1 )2 + j (α̂ji − α̂ji−1 )2 +
P
+ k (θ̂ki − θ̂ki−1 )2 is below a fixed tolerance level.
Once the parameter estimates are stable according
to the previous criterion, the underlying process Xt
is reconstructed as X̂t = (1 − Ẑt ) · Yt + 1q̂ · Ẑt · Yt ,
and an ARIM A model is fitted to the reconstructed
process to obtain α̂j , j = 1, . . . , p, θ̂k , k = 1, . . . , r
and σˆǫ 2 .

To account for potential trends or seasonal behaviour,
covariates can be included in the described estimation
process. Additionally, a parametric bootstrap procedure with
1000 replicates is used to estimate standard errors and
build confidence intervals based on the percentiles of the
distribution of the estimates. All the R codes used to
estimate the parameters and build the confidence intervals
are available as supplementary material.

Results
The results of the proposed methodology over a comprehensive simulation study and an application on two real data sets
are shown in this Section.

Simulation study
A thorough simulation study has been conducted to ensure
that the model behaves as expected in several situations,
including AR(1), M A(1) and ARM A(1, 1) structures for
the hidden process Xt with values for the parameters α, θ,
q and ω ranging from 0.1 to 0.9 for each parameter. For
each autocorrelation structure and parameters combination,
a random sample of size n = 1000 has been generated
using the function arima.sim from R package forecast 19,20 .

way, we aim to analyse the corresponding series of
incidence, and an AR process of order 1 seems to
be adequate (see Figure 1). According to Eq. (3), the
autocorrelation function of the observed process Yt when
the hidden process Xt has an AR(1) structure takes the
form ρY (k) = c · αk , where c = c(α, µǫ , σǫ2 , ω, q) =

In particular, in this case we can write log(ρY (k)) =
log(c) + k · log(α), so a statistically significant intercept
of this linear regression model (estimating the parameters
by ordinary least squares method) could be interpreted
as an evidence of underreporting, as in this case
(p − value = 0.0014). It is clear from Figure 1 that
the estimated regression line does not cross the origin, so
the behavior of the observed process is consistent with an
underlying underreported AR(1) process.

Different sample sizes (n = 50, 100, 500) have also been
analysed to study the impact of sample size on accuracy and
the results are reported in the Supplementary Material. The
complete tables with the estimates corresponding to each
combination of parameters can be found in Table S4 to S6
n = 50 and AR(1), M A(1) and ARM A(1, 1) respectively,
Tables S7 to S9 for n = 100 and Tables S10 to S12 for n =
500, and the performance is summarised in Tables S13 to
S15 for n = 50, 100 and 500 respectively. Absolute average
bias is similar regardless of the sample size, while average
interval lengths (AIL) are higher and interval coverages are
poorer (around 75% for n = 50) for lower sample sizes as
could be expected. Several bootstrap sizes (b = 20, 50, 100)
were also considered and the difference between them
were negligible, so only results corresponding to b = 100
bootstrap replicates are reported. The average absolute bias,
interval coverage and 95% confidence interval length are
reported in Table 1. These values are averaged over all
combinations of parameters. Additionally, standard AR(1),
M A(1) and ARM A(1, 1) models were fitted to the same
simulated series without accounting for their underreporting
structure.
The complete table with the estimates corresponding
to each combination of parameters is available as
Supplementary Material (Tables S1, S2 and S3 for AR(1),
M A(1) and ARM A(1, 1) structures respectively).
It is clear from Table 1 that ignoring the underreported
nature of data (labeled as Standard models in the table) leads
to highly biased estimates with extremely low coverage rates,
even with larger average interval lengths. This is especially
relevant when the intensity or frequency of underreported
observations is high.

These results are highly consistent with those previously
reported in the literature for the number of HPV cases
obtained through a discrete time series approach 7 and can
be interpreted in a very straightforward way. Moreover, this
new methodology can be used to model the incidence of
the disease instead of the number of cases, accounting for
potential changes in the underlying population.
The estimated intensity of underreporting is q̂ = 0.236,
with 95% confidence interval (0.150, 0.322). The registered
and estimated evolution of HPV incidence within the study
period (2010-2014) can be seen in Figure 2.

COVID-19 is a betacoronavirus that affects the lower
respiratory tract and often manifests as pneumonia in
humans which was identified as the causative agent of an
unprecedented outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan City, Hubei
province in China starting in December 2019 17 . Considering
that many cases run without developing symptoms beyond
those of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV or pneumonia due to other
causes, it is reasonable to assume that the incidence of this
disease has been underregistered, especially at the beginning
of the outbreak 21.
Heilongjiang is a province in north-east China. Although
in general the behavior of this kind of diseases is far
from being stationary, this province is far enough from
the focus in Hubei province (south central China) so the
incidence is much lower and less explosive, and in the study
period of time (2020/01/22-2020/02/26) it can be considered
stationary, as can be seen in Figure 4, which shows registered
and estimated evolution of COVID-19 incidence within the
considered period of time.
A disease with a similar behavior as the MERS-CoV has
been modeled as an ARM A(3, 1) 22 , so we checked this
model and similar ones. Probably due to the shortness of the
available data this autoregressive structure was not observed
and in our case the best performing model was an M A(1)
(AIC of -151.31 against -148.82 for the ARM A(3, 1)),
consistently with the residuals profile shown in Figure 3,
obtained from fitting an M A(1) model to the most likely
process Xt reconstructed following step (v) in Section
Estimation.
By means of the estimation method described in Section
Estimation, it can be seen that the estimated model for the
hidden process is Xt = 0.481 · ǫt−1 + ǫt , being the observed
process Yt ,

of health issues is very common. However, the accuracy
and data quality of such registries is in many cases at least
doubtful. This is the case, for instance, for rare diseases 23
or health issues that clear asymptomatically in most cases
like HPV infection. In the case of HPV incidence in Girona
in the period 2010-2014, the registered weekly average is
0.17 cases per 100,000 individuals, while the reconstructed
process has a weekly average of 0.51 cases per 100,000
individuals, showing that only 33% of the real incidence
is recorded by the public health system. This result is very
consistent with that of 7 , claiming that only 38% of the HPV
cases were registered in the same area and period of time.
The Heilongjiang region COVID-19 data reveal that in
average about 66% of the actual incidence in the period
2020/01/22-2020/02/26 was reported. The unavailable
data estimated by the proposed methodology are crucial
to provide public health decision-makers with reliable
information, which can also be used to improve the accuracy
of dynamic models aimed to estimate the spread of the
disease 21 .

Moriña et al.

The concerns around accuracy of registered data have
recently led to the publication of recommendations to
improve data collection to ensure accuracy of registries
(see for instance 24,25 ). Nonetheless, these recommendations
are very recent and may be difficult for the public health
services of many countries to fully implement them, due to
operational or structural issues.
The proposed methodology is able to deal with
underreported (or overreported) data in a very natural and
straightforward way, estimating its intensity and frequency
on a continuous time series, and allowing to reconstruct the
most likely unobserved process. It is also flexible enough to
handle covariates straightforwardly, and therefore it is simple
to introduce trends or seasonality if necessary, so it can be
useful in many contexts, where these issues might arise.
The simulation study shows that the proposed methodology behaves as expected and that the parameters used in the
simulations, under different autocorrelation structures, are
properly recovered, regardless of the intensity and frequency
of the underreporting issues.
