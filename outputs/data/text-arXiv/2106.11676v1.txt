A BSTRACT
Digital tools play an important role in fighting the current global COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a representative online study in Germany on a sample of 599 participants to evaluate the user
perception of vaccination certificates. We investigated five different variants of vaccination certificates, based on deployed and planned designs in a between-group design, including paper-based
and app-based variants. Our main results show that the willingness to use and adopt vaccination
certificates is generally high. Overall, paper-based vaccination certificates were favored over appbased solutions. The willingness to use digital apps decreased significantly by a higher disposition
to privacy, and increased by higher worries about the pandemic and acceptance of the coronavirus
vaccination. Vaccination certificates resemble an interesting use case for studying privacy perceptions for health related data. We hope that our work will be able to educate the currently ongoing
design of vaccination certificates, will give us deeper insights into privacy of health-related data and
apps, and prepare us for future potential applications of vaccination certificates and health apps in
general.

Introduction

The global pandemic caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has hit the
world in early 2020. This led to worldwide restrictions in social life, freedom of travel, and caused severe damage to
the global economy. In the course of this pandemic, different measures were used, including strategies to contain the
coronavirus with the help of digital tools. Several countries have rolled out mobile apps for different purposes such as
contact tracing [19] or quarantine monitoring [7].
The development of various vaccines against COVID-19 along with the continuous vaccination progresses in different
countries has sparked discussions around how vaccination certificates should be realized [31, 32]. Such certificates
can facilitate the withdrawal of lockdown restrictions particularly for vaccinated people [25]. There are currently
different digital and non-digital approaches used around the world. In the UK and the US, paper-based vaccination
cards are used to prove the vaccination status [33, 53]. Israel, a country with a comparably fast vaccination progress,
was one of the first countries to introduce a so-called Green Pass, both as a paper-based certificate and a digital app,
granting specific privileges to vaccinated citizens [24]. The European Union is planning to release the Digital Green
Certificate as a universal solution that is recognized throughout Europe in this summer [12].
In this work, we present the results of an online study conducted in Germany in March 2021 with 599 participants
selected representatively for the German population w. r. t. age, gender, and education. Our study was designed to

P ROOF - OF -VAX : S TUDYING U SER P REFERENCES AND P ERCEPTION OF C OVID VACCINATION C ERTIFICATES

capture users’ preferences and perception of different types of COVID-19 vaccination certificates. We study different
types of vaccination certificates, comparing (i) digital apps to paper-based variants, and (ii) certificates specifically
tailored to COVID-19 vaccinations to more general solutions that vaccination information can be integrated into.
This leads us to a total of five certificate variants, two paper-based and three digital variants, that we compare in a
between-subject design with approx. 120 participants per condition. We also evaluate the extent to which participants
in our study would use the certificates for specific purposes. More specifically, we consider within-subject use cases
in which certificates are only used for documentation, compared to situations in which the certificate is required to
attend specific activities. For the evaluation of our study results, we follow a mixed-methods approach comprising
quantitative measurements and qualitative analyses of participants’ feedback. In particular, we examine participants’
willingness to use such vaccination certificates, the perceived usefulness or utility, and the perceived effort required
for using the certificate. Furthermore, we explore potential privacy concerns, particularly related to sensitive personal
health data.
As the main results of our study show, participants are in general highly willing to use all variants of vaccination certificates and all vaccination certificate variants are rated as useful and easy to use with low effort. For the documentationonly purpose, participants are significantly more willing to use paper-based than app-based variants. We observe
significant negative correlations between participants’ disposition to privacy and their willingness to use vaccination certificates. Aspects that significantly increase participants’ willingness to use a vaccination certificates include
(i) whether participants already use the official German contact tracing Corona-Warn-App, (ii) worries about getting
infected with coronavirus, and (iii) their attitude towards vaccinations in general. On the downside, participants who
oppose vaccination obligations are significantly less willing to use vaccination certificates.
The results of this study allow us to better understand users’ rationale for accepting or rejecting the use of different
forms of vaccination certificates. Even beyond the current pandemic, our results can serve as vital information for
comparable situations in the future, where similarly vaccinations may play a role. In addition, our results allow for
interesting insights into general privacy considerations of users, for the increasingly important area of digital health
information apps [22].
In summary, our research makes the following key contributions:
1. We complement existing knowledge about acceptance of technology use in the current pandemic situation
affecting a large number of people all over the world by expanding the view to vaccination certificates.
2. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluations we show that privacy is an important factor for the adoption
of digital tools processing highly sensitive personal data such as health information.
3. Our results provide insights that can support the upcoming design, development, and roll-out of vaccination
certificates.

Related Work

We describe work related to our study focusing on research that explores factors driving the acceptance of technology from general mobile apps and tools, to health apps, to solutions specifically tailored to help contain the current
pandemic.
Technology Acceptance and Privacy in Digital Tools Literature on technology acceptance identified factors like
perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, social influence and demographic factors as gender and age to impact the
acceptance and use of technology [8, 55].
Various studies have found that privacy plays an important role in decision-making about digital tools and interacting
with online technology in a broad range of applications [11, 29, 47]. Ray et al. [40] study privacy concerns among
adults of two different age groups, finding that older adults are more concerned about global privacy threats. Besides
privacy being a factor influencing the use of a specific tool, there are also reasons for users to adopt privacy-enhancing
technologies such as VPN or Tor to increase their privacy [18, 34]. However, Story et al. [49] found severe misconceptions in the perception of protection provided by, e. g., VPN software.
Factors Influencing the Use of Mobile Health Apps Research on sharing health information online or via apps
has shown that users are more comfortable sharing health related data (e. g. sleep, physical activity) with their doctors
than with family members or electronic health records [35]. Bol et al. [3] examined which factors influence the use
of health apps and found privacy to not be a significant factor. Differences in mobile health apps use were instead
influenced by age, education level and e-health literacy. In contrast, other works found users to have privacy concerns
when using mobile health apps [17, 59, 62], or that they feared their data being misused by a third party and expressed
2

P ROOF - OF -VAX : S TUDYING U SER P REFERENCES AND P ERCEPTION OF C OVID VACCINATION C ERTIFICATES

desire for some level of control over their data [2]. Concerning older participants, Rasche et al. [39] found one sixth
of older adults in Germany to use health apps, mostly exercise-related. Barriers for the use of such apps included lack
of trust, privacy concerns, fear of misdiagnosis, and poor usability. Related to usability issues, Peng et al. [38] found
lack of app literacy, and lack of time and effort to be barriers for continued use of health apps.
The Role Of Mobile Apps in the Current Pandemic The majority of research studying the role of mobile apps
to contain the pandemic focus on solutions for digital contact tracing [60, 1, 48, 27, 50, 26, 30]. Regarding other
types of apps, Tsai et al. [51] explore users’ needs for explanations and transparency in symptom checking apps.
Zhang et al. [61] developed a framework to systematize and analyze applications for public information about the
pandemic, particularly focusing on different forms of visualizations. Utz et al. [54] expand the view to different types
of apps used for various purposes, finding that privacy aspects such as data receivers but also the degree of anonymity
significantly influence the acceptance of corona-related apps.

Vaccination Certificates

We introduce different types of vaccination certificates as they are currently discussed or have already been rolled-out
in different countries. We do so to motivate the selection of certificate realizations we use in our study. Furthermore,
we describe the state of the pandemic and vaccination progress in Germany at the time we conducted our study, in
order to put the results into the context of the overall situation.
3.1

State of the Art

Vaccines are considered as one of the most effective measures to contain the pandemic noticeably. To prove that vaccination has taken place, different variants of proof of vaccination against the coronavirus, further called vaccination
certificates, are used in several countries. To better understand the examined vaccination certificates used in this study,
various forms of existing or planned vaccination certificates and their support in the fight against the current pandemic
are presented below in more detail.
In the UK, a small wallet-size vaccination card published by the British health officials is used to prove the vaccination
status. These paper-based vaccination cards include the citizens’ name, the name of the vaccine, the unique batch
number and the date of both vaccines given [33]. In the US, a similar COVID-19 vaccination record card is used and
is the only proof of vaccination most Americans have after getting their COVID-19 shots. As of mid May 2021, the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stated that fully vaccinated citizens can resume activities without
wearing a mask or physically distancing in certain situations. However, showing a negative test result or documentation
of recovery from COVID-19 is still required before boarding an international flight to the US [53, 52].
Israel, a country with a very advanced vaccination campaign compared to other countries, was one of the first countries
to introduce the so-called Green Pass which is also published by official authorities [24]. The issued vaccination
certificate can be used within an app but can also be printed out in paper form. Personal information about the
vaccination status can be read by means of a simple QR-code. In addition to the QR-code, the Green Pass shows the
number of the personal ID card, the date of birth, the dates of vaccinations, and the vaccine’s name [24]. The green
passport is being used to gradually re-open the country. Vaccinated citizens are allowed to visit gyms, hotels, theaters,
or sport events. Israeli citizens are also allowed to enter the country without going through quarantine after a stay
abroad [56].
Not only governments but also companies started to develop vaccination certificates. The International Air Transport
Association (IATA), representing 82% of total air traffic, published the mobile app IATA Travel Pass [21]. This mobile
vaccination certificate is intended primarily to verify the vaccination status so that a passenger meets the requirements
for traveling. It helps travelers to store and manage their verified certifications for COVID-19 vaccines [21].
In Germany, there are two possibilities to record the successful COVID-19 vaccination. The vaccination can be entered
in the personal International Certificates of Vaccination document standardized by the World Health Organization
(WHO). This yellow paper-based document for various vaccinations is internationally recognized in order to certify
that vaccinations mandatory for travel and entering a specific country have been taken. The WHO Certificate is also
required for verification purposes of certain vaccinations within countries. Unless this vaccination card is brought to
the vaccination, a corona-specific paper-based vaccination certificate will be issued [10, 58].
In particular in Germany, a wide-spread and intensive debate related to privileges under the use of a vaccination certificate was and is still ongoing [25, 37, 56, 52]. This discussion gave rise to the idea of an Europe-wide vaccination
certificate against COVID-19, the Digital Green Certificate. The EU aims to introduce this kind of digital certificate valid throughout Europe by summer 2021 [13, 37]. The app-based certificate is primarily intended as a digital
3

P ROOF - OF -VAX : S TUDYING U SER P REFERENCES AND P ERCEPTION OF C OVID VACCINATION C ERTIFICATES

document but will also be available on paper associated with a personalized QR-code [13]. In order to speed up the
tendering process, the Federal Ministry of Health in Germany develops a digital certificate on its own, the CovPass
App. Just like the popular German contact tracing app, the Corona-Warn-App, which is also usable with various other
European contact tracing apps, the CovPass App is supposed to be compatible with the EU digital vaccination certificate. In addition, the digital vaccination certificate will be integrated into the existing Corona-Warn-App. Both
apps will contain the same integrated QR-code protected by a digital signature. To verify the vaccination status, an
additional verification app is developed [20, 46, 43].
3.2

Current Situation in Germany

At the time this study was conducted, there was a second lockdown (e. g., shops closed, curfew at night, travel restrictions) due to significantly increasing infection numbers [41, 9]. There were approx. 150 infected per 100,000 people
on a weekly basis (7-days incidence rate). Even though vaccination in Germany had started in December 2020, there
was and still is limited access to vaccine both in Germany and worldwide [14]. As a result, only a small proportion
of the population had been offered a COVID-19 vaccine. During the survey in Germany, from March 23 to 27 2021,
only 4.5% of the German population had been fully vaccinated [32, 42]. Even before the study was conducted, public
debates about societal implications of privileges for vaccinated citizens sparked in Germany. Most discussed were
withdrawals of coronavirus-related restrictions, especially for vaccinated people [25, 37]. In addition to that, the form
of vaccination certificates as well as proposals for an EU-wide uniform digital vaccination certificate were present in
the media [13]. Debates regarding especially digital solutions were dominated by privacy and security concerns of
government-backed health applications [37, 4].

Methodology

To investigate the general willingness to use of vaccination certificates, paper- and app-bases variants which contain
sensitive health data, we conducted an online survey. We examined five different variants of vaccination certificates
in a between-subject design. Additionally, we have retrieved three different use cases (within-subject design) for
vaccination certificates per condition. A specific vaccination certificate combined with a use case is called a scenario.
In the following, we describe our five different variants of vaccination certificates (between-subject), the associated
three use cases (within-subject), and the survey questionnaire in detail.

(a) Covid Certificate (C1)

(b) Intl. Certificate (C2)

(c) Covid Cert. App (C3)

(d) Health Insur. App (C4)

(e) Corona-Warn-App (C5)

4.1

Variants of Vaccination Certificates (Between-Subject Conditions)

We designed five between-subject conditions, representing different variants of vaccination certificates. Each condition
within our survey consists of a short descriptive text supplemented by a visualized mock-up design (cf. Figure 1) of
the respective vaccination certificate. All mock-ups are based on currently used vaccination certificates or vaccination
certificates planned to be issued in the near future (see Section 3). Across all conditions, the vaccination certificates
contain at least the person’s name and date of birth, as well as the vaccinated vaccine and date of the first and second
vaccination. We tested two paper-based variants (C1,C2) and three digital app variants (C3–C5). In the following, all
five variants are explained in detail:
(C1) Covid Certificate. A simple piece of credit card-sized paper confirming the vaccination against the coronavirus.
This form of documentation is currently issued by default in various countries such as the UK and USA [53, 33].
(C2) WHO Certificate. An entry in the personal International Certificates of Vaccination document standardized by
the World Health Organization, which is already used by many countries to verify the vaccination status of
various vaccinations [58].
(C3) Covid Certificate App. A dedicated Corona Vaccination App simply displaying the vaccination status. This app
is based on Israel’s Green Pass and the currently developed German CovPass app which can be used throughout
Europe [43, 24, 12].
(C4) Health Insurance App. A general Health Insurance Company App which is gradually introduced in Germany
and further European countries to digitize the patient’s record, also including vaccination records. This app is
issued by health insurance companies in accordance with the Electronic Patient Record. The app will enable the
insured to view all personal sensitive health data centrally and make it easier for hospitals and doctors to share
previous illnesses and patient records [16, 15].
(C5) Corona-Warn-App (CWA). An additional entry within the CWA, which is the official contact tracing app in
Germany [46]. In addition to digital contact tracing, more features (e. g., proof of negative test results and QRcode-based check-in for events) have been continuously integrated into the app. There is prospect that also the
EU-issued Digital Green Certificate for vaccination will be integrated into the app when available [46].
These five conditions can be categorized along two dimensions (i) Paper-based vs. app-based solutions, which differ
in the medium how the information is transmitted, and (ii) specific-purpose vs. general-purpose solutions, where
the former are designed specifically to verify only the COVID-19 vaccination status, and the latter contain more
information, e. g., contact tracing, a participant’s digital health record, or various vaccinations in general.
The Health Insurance App (C4) and the Corona-Warn-App (C5) are similar in that both represent integrated appbased solutions. We included both in our survey as they serve different aspects: (i) Apps issued by health insurance
companies are presumably less spread in Germany but reflect a more general setting with the potential for broader
insights and adoption also in future scenarios [57, 15, 16]. (ii) In Germany, the Corona-Warn-App has found broad
adoption (approx. 28 million downloads) and therefore, integrating the COVID-19 vaccination documentation would
instantly serve a huge number of users [20]. At the same time, this integration would be limited to the purpose of the
corona vaccination.

4.2

Use Case (Within-Subject Factors)

A vaccination certificate has different uses. Our study considers three within-subject use cases (U1–U3). A specific
condition, i. e. variant of vaccination certificate, within our survey, is always shown to a participant including all three
use cases. Each use case is shown in chronologically equal order:
(U1) Documentation. In the first use case, it is assumed that the respective vaccination certificate is used for
documentation-purposes only.
(U2) Vaccination Certificate for Privileges – Limited vaccine. Within this use case, the actual situation – not only
in Germany – is represented: Vaccine is only available to a limited extent, this means, not everyone has been
offered a vaccination. Vaccinated citizens might have certain benefits, such as, no negative test result is necessary
or international travel for private purposes is possible again [14, 5].
(U3) Vaccination Certificate for Privileges – Vaccination offer for everyone. This use case is similar to use case U2
but in this use case there is enough vaccine for everyone.
Our use cases represent the situation in Germany at the time of the study (use case U1) as well as potential future use
cases (U2,U3) associated with privileges, especially considering the facts that only limited vaccine was available (U2)
but there will be vaccine for everyone in the future (U3). These use cases become highly relevant as U2 is more or less
the current situation (late May 2021 in Germany).

Questionnaire

Next we outline the structure of our questionnaire. The complete questionnaire including all questions can be found
in Appendix A.
Introduction First, we introduced the purpose of our study, namely to evaluate how a potential vaccination confirmation might look like for the recently started coronavirus vaccinations. Moreover, we provided information about
data collection and processing, noting that questions about the participant’s health are asked, and asked participants
for consent to proceed with the study.
Smartphone Use and Experience With Coronavirus To get insights into participants’ smartphone use and handle
of health data we asked whether they possess a smartphone (Q1) and use an app or smartwatch to monitor their health
data or sport activities (Q2). Additionally they were asked questions about using the popular German Corona-WarnApp for digital contact tracing (Q3) and previous experiences with the coronavirus, especially their concerns related
to become infected with the coronavirus (Q4–Q7).
General Questions About Vaccinations Next, we asked them general questions about vaccinations, including
whether they possess the yellow vaccination certificate and if they received the recommended vaccinations (Q8–
Q11). We further asked several questions to capture participants’ attitudes towards coronavirus vaccinations for themselves (Q12, Q13) and for others (Q14, Q15).
Vaccination Certificates In the main part of the study, we investigate the willingness-to-use and perceived utility of
the various variants of vaccination certificates. We start with a brief summary of the current state of the pandemic and
the state of the vaccination effort and illustrate the proof of vaccination for the participant’s condition, comprising a
short descriptive text and a mock-up. Subsequently, we cycle through the three use cases (U1–U3), always shown in
the same order.
(U1) For U1, we ask how likely participants would use the presented certificate (Q18), and further ask them to provide
an open-ended response to explain their decision (Q19–Q21).
(U2) For U2, we present 11 activities and ask participants which of these activities the certificate should be required
for (Q23) and about their willingness to use the certificate for one or more of these purposes (Q24). We also ask
participants to rate the utility and effort to use the vaccination certificate (Q25, Q26).
(U3) For U3, we again ask them about their willingness to use the certificate (Q29, under the last use case of enough
vaccine being available for everyone) and reasons for their decision in a open-ended follow-up question (Q30).
We conclude this part of the questionnaire with three more general questions, asking participants which variant of
vaccination certificate they generally prefer (this time, offering each participant to choose from paper- and app-based
variants, if any), mandatory vaccinations and whether they perceived the pandemic as a burden (Q32–Q34).
Disposition to Privacy Vaccination status, other personal information included in the certificates, and health-related
information included for example in (C2) and (C4) are highly sensitive personal data, with the potential to raise privacy
concerns. To get insights into the participants’ privacy attitudes we use prior existing scales [28, 6] to form two Privacy
Disposition Scales measuring participants general disposition to privacy (Q35, PDS-general) with one version being
specifically tailored to a mobile app context (Q36, PDS-app). Both scales consist of three items each, and we added
a fourth question covering especially health data. We translated the items into German to avoid distortions due to
misunderstanding.
4.4

Pilot Study

We tested the survey design in a pilot study with 150 participants recruited through convenience sampling via a
university related mailing-list to get first insights and to further improve our study design. Based on the results of the
pilot study we inserted more information about the use cases on separate pages in our main study, so the differences of
our use cases became more visible and thus lead to more meaningful results. Moreover, we added the questions which
vaccination certificate they generally prefer (Q32).
Other than that, we used our pilot study to validate the privacy questions. Both privacy scales, PDS-general and PDSapp, showed good to perfect internal consistency scores (Cronbach’s α = .78 and .94). Therefore, we proceeded with
the main study as planned.

Data Collection and Sample

Participants were recruited by the panel provider Lightspeed Research (Kantar) from an online panel and sampled
representatively for the population in Germany wrt. gender, age and education. The demographics of our sample are
listed in Table 1. Deviation from the target demographics is smaller than 3.2 % for all targets. Within our sample, there
are 309 female participants (51.6 %), 290 male participants (48.2 %), and 1 non-binary participant. The average age
was 49.6 years and 85 % of the participants do not have an education in, nor do work in, the field of computer science,
computer engineering or IT. Participants took on average about 12 minutes to complete the online survey.
4.6

Research Ethics

Our department does not have an institutional review board. Instead, our study followed best practices of human
subject research and data protection guidelines. To minimize any potential adverse effects from the study we followed
the ethical principles laid out in the Belmont report [36], specifically we sought informed consent at the beginning of
the study and participants were informed that they could withdraw from the study without any negative consequences
at any time. Kantar, our panel provider, has committed itself to follow the ICC/ESOMAR code of conduct [23].

Results

In the following section we present our results. Our main results concern the participants’ willingness to use various
forms of vaccination certificates and the factors that influence it. Further results concern the perceived effort and the

and three use cases (U1–U3). Responses were collected on equidistant five-point scales.
5.1

Willingness to Use Vaccination Certificates

Using vaccination certificates is voluntary in Germany where we conducted our survey. Thus, willingness to use such
certificates plays an important role for their adoption. In the first step of our evaluation, we analyze the responses to
questions about participants’ willingness to use vaccination certificates across the five conditions and three use cases.

The questions were answered on equidistant five-point scales by Rohrmann [45, 44]. Higher response values represent
more positive responses, i. e., a higher willingness to use the described certificate form. We compare the responses
using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post-hoc pairwise tests with Bonferroni correction. When requirements for
the analysis of variance such as homogeneity of variances were violated we used Welch’s ANOVA instead.
Subsequently, we analyze which factors impact participants’ willingness to use a vaccination certificate. We therefore
apply a multiple linear regression for both continuous and categorical variables to analyze covariances. We perform
one covariance analysis per use case for U1 and U2 with the willingness to use (Q18 and Q24) as dependent variables.
When determining significance for all results (α = 5 %), we used Bonferroni-Holm corrected alpha values to ensure
multiple testing correction. For our results we indicate significance-levels with stars (*p < .05, **p < .01, ***p <
.001).
5.1.1

Differences Between Conditions and Use Cases

Figure 2 illustrates the distribution of responses to questions about willingness to use the different types of vaccination
certificates separately for each use case. Accordingly, Table 2 lists the mean response values for these questions.
Mean responses were generally rather positive across all conditions and use cases. Most strikingly, we observe the
highest willingness to use for the standardized paper-based international vaccination certificate when it is only used for
documentation purposes (C2 × U1, mean = 4.58). In this scenario, 106 out of 120 participants provided a positive
answer.
For the documentation use case (U1) we found pairwise statistically highly significant differences (p < .01) between
each of C1 and C2 compared to C3, C4, and C5. This means that both paper-based certificates reach higher preference
rates than each of their app-based counterparts. We also observe tendencies to higher response values for C1 and
C2 compared to the other conditions in the other two use cases (U2 and U3). However, these differences are only
significant for U2 (p < .05) and not statistical significant for U3. Additionally, we observe significantly higher
willingness to use values for the documentation use case (U1) compared to both certificate uses cases (U2 and U3)
across all conditions (cf. Table 2, Overall). Since differences between scenarios can be mainly observed between
paper-based (C1,C2) and app-based (C3–C5) conditions, we summarize those groups of conditions for our subsequent
analyses.
After all use cases, we explicitly asked participants if they preferred an app-based or paper-based vaccination certificate. 44 % of participants would rather use a paper-based variant, compared to 37 % rather using an app-based variant.
Around 12.5 % were undecided if they would use any certificate and 6.5 % of participants would not use any vaccination certificate. As 40 % of participants were in a paper-based condition (C1 or C2) and 60 % of participants were in
an app-based condition (C3–C5), these results do not solely reflect the condition participants were in, but rather show
their general opinion.
5.1.2

Predictors for Differences

We determine the factors that explain the differences between the scenarios reported in Section 5.1.1, particularly
between the paper-based and app-based conditions in the documentation use case (U1) and the vaccination certificate
for privilege use case (U2). To this end, we create a new Condition variable with two levels paper-based (reflecting
C1 and C2) and app-based (C3–C5). We also group other related factors for the analysis: For Q6 and Q7 we group
the answers into a score showing “worries about Coronavirus”, similar to our approach with the Privacy Disposition
Score. For Q4 and Q5 we create a new factor “Coronavirus Infection” indicating “yes” for participants answering

“yes” to at least one of the questions and “no” for participants answering “unsure” or “no” to both of these questions.
We proceed the same way for Q12 and Q13, creating the new factor “Vaccination Willingness”.
We conducted covariance analyses examining the willingness to use as outcome variable (Q18 for U1 and Q24 for
U2) for a set of factors as listed in Table 3. Reported estimates indicate influence on participants’ willingness to use
vaccination certificates. Positive values indicate higher willingness to use the respective certificate, negative values
indicate lower willingness.
We find the condition (paper-based vs. app-based), attitudes towards vaccination obligation (Q33), and the participants’ disposition to privacy (PDS-general, Q35) being significantly inhabitant factors for the willingness to use
vaccination documentation and certificates. Participants’ are less willing to use an app-based vaccination documentation/certificate than a paper-based version. This effect is stronger for U1 (−0.96) than for U2 (−0.32). Participants
with higher disposition of privacy are also less willing to use a vaccination documentation or certificate. Again, the
effect is slightly stronger for U1 than for U2.
Being more worried about Coronavirus Infection (Q6/7) and having a positive attitude towards vaccination (Q12/13)
positively influence the willingness to use for use cases U1 and U2. Participants being worried about the coronavirus
are more willing to use a vaccination documentation and certificate, with a slightly higher estimate for U1. Participants
who are willing to get vaccinated or are already vaccinated are more willing to use a vaccination documentation and
certificate than participants who do not want to get vaccinated, with a higher estimate for U2. Additionally, participants
using the German Corona-Warn-App (Q3) are more willing to use vaccination documentation and certificates, with a
slightly higher estimate for U1.

Analysis of Significant Factors

For a deeper understanding of factors that affect willingness to use vaccination certificates, we also take a closer look
into participants’ open-ended responses. We asked for reasons why or why not participants would use certificates in
use cases U1 (Q19–Q21) and U3 (Q30), depending on their responses to Q18 and Q29, respectively. To evaluate these
open-ended responses, we followed an iterative coding procedure. Two researchers independently assigned codes to
the responses to identify and group common themes. Each response could be assigned multiple codes. The two coders
then discussed their individual codings, agreed on a final coding scheme and aligned their individual codes to this
scheme, finalized by a mutual validation of codings.
Table 4 summarizes the numbers of participants in each group (i. e., condition and willingness-to-use), along with the
number of open-ended responses and codes assigned to these responses. For willingness-to-use, we group participants
based on their responses to Q18 (and Q29, respectively). Participants who provided the two lowest response levels on
the five-point response scale are labeled No, the two highest response labels are assigned Yes and the neutral response
is labeled Undecided.
Privacy Concerns and Disposition When asked about reasons for not using a vaccination certificate for documentation (U1, Q19), about one third of responses in the app-based conditions (30 out of 91 responses) referred to privacy
concerns. The majority of participants mentioned general concerns about privacy (P407: “I am concerned about data
protection”) or referred to specifics of smartphone privacy (P467: “I do not need any more data collection on my
smartphone”, P517: “I do not want to be tracked”). Additionally, a few responses explicitly referred to privacy concerns related to health data, i. e., sensitive information (P255: “Because I do not want any health data on my phone”,
P509: “I do not want my health data to be stored on my phone”). Privacy being an important factor influencing
willingness to use a vaccination certificate is also reflected by participants who were undecided in their willingness
to use the certificate. Among those participants 28 responses (out of 82 responses we received) referred to privacy
concerns (P355: “Because this is another app that secretly reads data on my smartphone”, P475: “I am not sure if I
trust smartphone apps in terms of privacy [...]).
Among the app-based conditions, we observe the highest number of privacy references in C4 (Health Insurance App)
and the fewest in C3 (Covid Certificate App). In the paper-based conditions, no responses referred to such concerns
about privacy or protection of sensitive information, independent of participants’ willingness to use the certificate.
Interestingly, the number of responses referring to privacy is lower in use case U3, i. e., when the certificate is used
as a proof that can be used for specific purposes. Among participants who are not willing to use the certificate in this
scenario, 21 (out of 82) responses refer to privacy, and only 6 (out of 63) of those who are undecided.
These observations confirm the results of our covariance analysis, which shows a strongly significant negative influence
of participants privacy disposition in use case U1, and a smaller significant influence for U3 (cf. Table 3).
In this context, we also take a closer look into participants’ privacy attitudes, i. e., their Privacy Disposition Score in
general (PDS-general, Q35) and Privcacy Disposition Score related to apps (PDS-app, Q36). Overall, PDS-general
(mean = 3.26, sd = 0.81) is slightly higher than PDS-app (mean = 3.05, sd = 1.22), along with larger standarddeviations for PDS-app compared to PDS-general. We also observe moderate significant correlations for PDS-general
and U1 (r = .17**) as well as for U2 (r = .14**) across all conditions. For PDS-app and use cases U1 and U2,
we observe high and significant correlations (both r = .47**), showing a strong relation for the willingness to use
an app-based vaccination documentation or certificate with PDS-app. This again highlights privacy disposition as
a significant factor for the (planned) adoption of vaccination documentation and certificates, especially if these are
app-based.

P ROOF - OF -VAX : S TUDYING U SER P REFERENCES AND P ERCEPTION OF C OVID VACCINATION C ERTIFICATES

Attitudes Towards Vaccination As we see in the results of the covariance analysis, participants’ willingness to get
vaccinated has a strong significant positive effect on their willingness to use a certificate. Additionally, their attitude
towards vaccinations being mandatory has significant influence on their willingness to use vaccination certificates.
Since responses reflecting participants’ general attitudes towards vaccinations do not depend on whether they were
asked about paper-based or app-based certificates, we do not distinguish conditions here. Among all 117 participants
who were not willing to use a vaccination certificate, 13 (out of 104 who provided a response) indicated that they
were not going to be vaccinated. However, responses come in different flavors, ranging from individuals who are
ineligible for vaccination, e. g., for medical reasons (P35: “I must not get vaccinated.”), to anti-vaccinationists (P10:
“Because I am principally opposed to vaccinations.”, P441: “I do not intend to get vaccinated against an unresearched
disease.”), to conspiracy theorists (P132: “No one will ever inject me that poison.”, P249: “The corona pandemic is
simply overplayed [...] Everyone will die anyway, so it’s better to let it just happen.”).
Among those participants who were undecided about their willingness to use the certificate, 7 (out of 97) responses
indicate that participants have not finally decided about getting vaccinated.
Regarding attitudes towards mandatory vaccinations, several participants expressed that they did not appreciate a form
of indirect vaccination obligation in use case U3. 13 participants who are not willing to use a certificate indicated
this in their open-ended responses (P236: “They create some kind of vaccination obligation [...]”, P526: “This way,
getting vaccinated is no longer voluntary.”). In a similar fashion, 12 participants referred to discrimination between
vaccinated and not vaccinated people (P189: “All people should have the same rights and opportunities.”, P274:
“That would discriminate all people who do not want to get vaccinated, for whichever reason.”). On the opposite side,
one participant who was willing to use their paper-based certificate also referred to vaccinations being mandatory,
however, without opposing this (P8: “This way, the vaccination will become mandatory. I do not have a problem with
that.”).
Worries about Coronavirus We identified 51 responses to Q30 (U3), in which participants referred to their intent
to protect themselves or others from the coronavirus as a justification to use their vaccination certificate for specific
activities (Q30) (P241: “for my own safety”, P138 “to protect myself and others”) across all five conditions (35 in
paper-based conditions and 16 in app-based conditions). Eleven participants (paper: 9, app: 2) mentioned fighting the
pandemic a reason to use their certificate (P488: “Help containing the corona pandemic”). Among participants who
are not willing to use any form of certificate we did not identify references to reasoning about health protection or
fighting the pandemic. This is in line with the finding that willingness to use a vaccination certificate is significantly
higher when participants are worried about the coronavirus, e. g., worried that they or people close to them could catch
a coronavirus infection (cf. Table 3).
5.1.4

Certificate Purposes

We conclude our analysis of willingness to use vaccination certificates with a look into participants’ attitudes towards
specific purposes, i. e., whether they would use the certificate for them. Within the scenario for use case U3, we asked
participants what purposes they would use the certificate for (Q28). In total, we asked for 11 purposes covering a
broad range of business, leisure, or travel activities. Participants indicated their willingness to use their vaccination
certificate on five-point scales for each purpose. While we only observe minor differences among the five conditions
for each purpose, we find tendencies indicating that participants are more willing to use their vaccination certificate
for more extraordinary purposes. Across all conditions, 356 out of 599 participants provided positive responses for
International Air Travel, compared to 255 positive responses for National Train Travel, which also includes local
public transport. Similarly, using the certificate to attend Large Events such as sports events or concerts finds broader
acceptance than more Casual Activities such as going to a restaurant. The distribution of responses to all purposes we
considered is illustrated in Figure 3.
5.2

Effort and Utility of Vaccination Certificates

In use case U2, we asked participants to rate the utility (Q25) and effort (Q26) of their vaccination certificate. Larger
values express higher utility and lower values show less effort. The results in Table 5 and Figure 4 show that all
certificates are viewed as rather useful (mean > 3) as well as rather easy to use (effort mean < 3). We only observed
slight differences between the conditions, with none of them being significant. There is a strong positive correlation (r = .76) between utility and willingness to use (Q24), and a negative correlation (r = −.46) between effort and
willingness to use. Finally, effort and utility correlate negatively (r = −.39).
Within the open-ended responses collected w. r. t. willingness to use we also gained insights into participants’ perceived
utility of the certificates. Since willingness to use a certificate and its utility are highly correlated, it is plausible that

in use case U2. Responses were collected on equidistant five-point scales.

utility aspects were named reasons for why participants would use a certificate, both for documentation (U1), and also
as a certificate as requirement for specific activities (U3). For documentation purposes (U1), 7 participants referred to
utility as a reason to use the certificate in the paper-based condition, and 48 participants referred to it in the app-based
condition. Whereas utility was mostly attributed to the certificates easy-to-carry nature (P28: “I can carry this with
me in my wallet.”, P76: “[...] simple, handy”) in the paper-condition, participants in favor of the app-based certificate
appreciated that they did not need to carry any separate item with them (P306: “On my phone I have my confirmation
always with me.”, P555: “The alternative was carrying my vaccination card at all times.”).
In U3, 3 participants referred to utility in the paper-based condition, and 37 in the app-based condition, providing
similar arguments as for U1. Even though the numbers are lower in U3, this does not imply that they rated the
certificate as less useful than for documentation. In this scenario, large numbers of participants referred to being

happy about using the certificate for travel or to attend events, thus putting a different focus. However, even such
answers can be considered related to utility in a broader sense.

Discussion

Our study revealed factors that impact the willingness to use vaccination certificates foremost especially designed to
fight the COVID-19 pandemic. The results have implications not only for the design of vaccination certificates but also
show that their utility and people’s privacy disposition play an important role in their willingness to adopt vaccination
apps.
6.1

Willingness to Use Vaccination Certificates

Generally speaking, the willingness to use vaccination certificates is high, up to 4.58 (C2×U1). Interestingly, the use
cases we considered in the survey had a significant influence on the willingness to use. Over all conditions, willingness
to use was 3.73 for use case U1 (for documentation purposes only), 3.51 for use cases U2, and 3.52 for U3 (used to
verify vaccination status associated with privileges). The differences in the willingness to use between use case U1
and the other two use cases are significant (p < 0.05) – participants are significantly more willing to use all variants
of certificates in use case U1 than in both other use cases. We suspect that this is related to the significantly more
invasive intervention caused by specific privileges only given to vaccinated individuals associated with concerns about
a two-class society and discrimination.
Especially among those willing to be vaccinated or already vaccinated, the willingness to use vaccination certificates
is particularly high (mean = 4.07) compared to those who refuse vaccination against the coronavirus (mean = 2.34).
We therefore conclude that vaccination certificates will be considered by our participants as an effective means to fight
the COVID-19 pandemic.
For use case U1 (considering that the respective vaccination certificate serves only for documentation purposes) our
survey indicates that people prefer paper-based variants (C1,C2) compared to app-based variants (C3–C5), these differences are highly significant. There is no significant difference between C1 and C2, that is, whether a corona-specific
paper-based certificate (C1) or the more generalized yellow vaccination certificate (C2) is used. The high willingness
to use rates for the paper-based versions might be due to habits, as 76% of our participants posses the certificate
variant in C2, the yellow vaccination certificate. For the documentation purpose many participants seem to value the
existing certificate as sufficient. In both privilege-related use cases (U2,U3) there is almost no difference between both
paper-based variants.
In our qualitative analysis it was striking that many participants mentioned potential privileges when asked why they
would use the respective vaccination certificate variant already for use case U1. Many participants argue they would
like to be prepared once vaccination certificates become mandatory for certain purposes like traveling. This might
be also due to the public debate about potential vaccination certificates and associated privileges such as traveling,
attending events, or even lifting curfew, taking place in Germany during the time of our survey.
In case vaccination certificates are mandatory for certain purposes (U2,U3), there are less significant differences between paper-based and app-based vaccination certificates. Only for use case U2 we observe significantly higher values
for willingness to use for both paper-based versions compared to C4, the general health care app. This might be due to
high privacy concerns that such a general app which contains more sensitive health data produce. We do not observe
significant differences between the specific and more general paper-based versions. Especially in use cases U2 and U3
the mean values for willingness to use of both paper-based variants are similar, participants do not seem to like one of
these better for those use cases (compared to use case U1). It has to be noted that none of the differences between the
paper-based variants nor between app-based variants are significant.
6.2

Privacy as a Key Factor for Willingness to Use

Our results clearly indicate that there are significant (negative) correlations between the willingness to use and the
participants’ self-reported privacy disposition, both for the general and the app related privacy disposition. Correlations
are higher for participants’ willingness to use and the privacy disposition related to apps. Also the evaluated qualitative
responses support these significant qualitative findings with regard to privacy concerns using vaccination apps – around
34% of the open answers stated privacy concerns. In none of the paper-based conditions participants mentioned privacy
concerns, which are therefore most relevant for app-based certificates. This shows once again that privacy plays an
essential role for the user, especially in the case of digital health apps. This is in line with related work that identified
privacy concerns as limiting factors for the use and acceptance of mobile health apps [59, 62]. Other related work
13

P ROOF - OF -VAX : S TUDYING U SER P REFERENCES AND P ERCEPTION OF C OVID VACCINATION C ERTIFICATES

regarding the willingness to use apps to fight the current pandemic, have also shown that privacy plays an essential
role when it comes to apps using sensitive personal health data [54].
This is again reflected by our qualitative results, as some participants explicitly referred to privacy concerns regarding
their personnel health data. Others mentioned privacy more broadly, like not wanting to be tracked, wanting their
data to be protected generally, are scared of unwilling data access by the app, and do not trust their smartphone apps
with data privacy. These thoughts highlight participants’ deeply privacy concerns as well as their desire for privacy
protection. Privacy is also often related to anonymity, as the discussion on the CWA in Germany showed. The CWA
therefore follows anonymity and a decentralized privacy friendly approach.
6.3

Other Factors Influencing the Willingness to Use

Social Factors Social reasons play a significant role in the adoption of vaccination certificates – as studies have also
shown in terms of contact tracing apps [54]. Social reasons here consists of protecting other people, as people who are
worried about getting of a coronavirus infection (or worried about people close to them getting a coronavirus infection)
have a significantly increased willingness to use vaccination certificates. Participants also frequently mentioned in their
qualitative responses, that they want to use the certificates to protect themselves but also to protect others by proving
their vaccination status.
Health Insurance App (C4) We observe the tendency that the willingness to use C4 (i. e., the universal Health
Insurance App) is the lowest in all three use cases. This is the app variant that is most generalized and contains most
health related data in addition to the vaccination status, such as medical records shared between hospitals and medical
practices, and general registered vaccinations. We also stated in the description that this variant is made available by
the health insurance company, which might have led participants to oppose this variant. This finding might also be due
to the participants’ privacy concerns, as this variant uses the most sensitive personal health data and therefore might
trigger the most privacy concerns. This assumption is backed by our qualitative analysis, where we find that the most
privacy concerns are posed for this vaccination certificate variant.
Corona-Warn-App (C5) Another factor in regard to habits (like the paper-based preference) is the use of the German contact tracing app, the Corona-Warn-App, which was used by around 40 % of the participants. We found that
using the German Corona-Warn-App correlates with a higher willingness to use a vaccination certificate in both use
cases U1 and U2. This might be due to the fact that participants value the German Corona-Warn-App as an important instrument to help fight the pandemic and are more open for other measures in this regard. This also shows that
participants might not see the need for other apps, as they are using the CWA already.
When comparing the specific app-based vaccination certificate (C3) to the more generalized and feature-rich CWAintegrated vaccination certificate (C5) we do not find a significant difference, in fact in use case U3 there is no difference at all in the mean willingness to use values for those conditions. Since it is announced that the European
vaccination certificate will be integrated into the CWA, we expect that many users already thought of this option and
will use the existing CWA for this purpose. This also shows that it can make sense to add features to existing pandemic
apps and develop them further in order to create additional incentives to continue using them.
6.4

Design Implications for Vax Apps

Our results show important factors for the acceptance of vaccination certificates. Based on that we pose the following
design implications for Vaccination certificates.
Like other technology acceptance literature [8, 55] we also found factors as perceived usefulness and ease of use to
highly correlate with the willingness to use the different variants of vaccination certificates as mentioned in Section 5.2.
Other related work identified privacy concerns to be barriers for the use and acceptance of mobile health apps [59, 62].
Our results confirm these findings. We found a higher privacy disposition to negatively influence the willingness to
use vaccination certificates - paper-based and app-based ones. This is also in line with the development of the popular
German contact tracing app (CWA) where great importance was attached to anonymity, a decentralized approach and
privacy. Especially for sensitive health data in terms of apps, privacy plays an important role and should therefore
strictly follow privacy-by-design principles. This should also be taken into account when the vaccination status is
verified by third-parties. If possible, third-parties should only be able to see the (electronically signed) QR-code to
make the process least privacy-invasive for the user. Therefore, we recommend easy of use, utility and high privacy
standards to be key factors for the design of vaccination apps.
In our opinion, it is much more difficult to pursue anonymity and a decentralized approach with vaccination certificates,
as is partly the case with contact tracing apps. However, vaccination certificate apps should follow a least-invasive
14

privacy approach. As participants value a high utility of the vaccination certificates, represented in both our quantitative and qualitative results, integrated and universal solutions should be considered preferable. However, universal
compatibility, e. g., across multiple countries, requires a certain level of verifiability. For the planned European digital
vaccination certificate this should be taken into account especially for purposes such as Europe-wide and international
traveling and cross-border commuters.
The app does not necessarily has to be coronavirus-specific but can rather be integrated as an additional feature in
existing privacy-friendly solutions, as is the case with the Corona-Warn-App. As a design implication it makes sense
to add features to existing pandemic apps and develop them further in order to create additional incentives to continue
using them.
Another important factor when designing digital and paper-based vaccination certificates is forgery protection, especially in the case of a pandemic to protect their lives and health of the population. Although our study did not focus
on security, we will highlight some implications briefly. Especially paper-based documents are easy to forge compared with digital apps. In particular, the currently used yellow vaccination certificate lacks of any security features,
such as hologram stickers. Strong forgery-protection could be a huge advantage of digital vaccination certificates, if
implemented properly. We therefore recommend to implement forgery-protection into the design process.
Since our study showed that paper-based certificate variants also have a high willingness to use, it should nevertheless
be possible to use these variants as an alternative to digital apps. In addition to that, some participants stated that
they do not own a smartphone or are unable to install such an app for technical reasons. Therefore, we recommend
that the app variant should, especially when considering forgery protection, be the preferred variant but paper-based
alternatives should always be offered.

Limitations

Although we tried to make our scenarios and the questions contained therein as understandable and realistic as possible
including a comparatively large pilot study in order to get the best possible quantitative and qualitative data, our study
has the following limitations.
First, in the survey we present fictitious vaccination certificates to the participants (albeit based strongly on real-world
prototypes and/or deployed ones). Due to the dynamic situation with rapid changes, the examined certificates do not
necessarily correspond in all details to these existing or planned vaccination certificates.
Second, an online survey will never be able to fully capture the complexity of interacting in real-world situations,
possibly underestimating the influence of factors such as forgetting or loosing a paper-based certificate or an empty
battery for digital versions. We tried to mitigate these effects by having a clear explanation of the certificate on the
survey, and adding a visual representation as well. In addition, some conditions such as the WHO vaccination passport
(C2) and the Corona-Warn-App (C5) are in wide-spread use, so several participants should be quite familiar with
them. Future work may complement our survey by conducting field studies evaluating and using specific vaccination
certificates including an app-based verification process in real-world applications which allows to observe participants’
actual behavior within such scenarios.
Finally, at the time conducting the survey vaccination certificates were only used to document vaccinations, the possibility of easing restrictions for vaccinated were only discussed. Thus, it is not clear to what extent there is a discrepancy
between self-reported and actual behavior if vaccination certificates are required in real-world applications.

Conclusion

Vaccinations are the most promising measure to end the ongoing pandemic in the long run and to reduce restrictions
under the use of vaccination certificates in the short term. For these certificates to meet their purpose and to be widely
adopted it is important to take people’s opinions into account. We therefore studied different solutions of vaccination
certificates and participants’ willingness to use them for different use cases. Overall, our results indicate that both
the general willingness to use and utility of vaccination certificates are perceived positively across all investigated
scenarios. Overall, paper-based solutions received more positive responses compared to app-based solutions. Important factors influencing the adoption of vaccination certificates include privacy concerns, worries about a coronavirus
infection and positive attitudes towards vaccination. Appropriate handling of sensitive health data, and addressing
privacy and security concerns are key factors for design and development for certificate apps. We conclude that for
documentation only there is no need for an app-based variant but for verifying the vaccination status we recommend
to offer both paper- and app-based vaccination certificates in a privacy preserving manner.

Current Situation Description To ensure that all study participants are on the same level of knowledge for the
following questions, we have provided some brief information for you. Please read them and keep in mind the current
situation for answering them: In Germany, people have been vaccinated against coronavirus since December 27, 2020.
For a full vaccination protection, two vaccination appointments at a time interval are necessary. Since there is currently
only limited vaccine available, vaccination is carried out according to a staged plan. After the completed vaccination,
a confirmation of vaccination is issued. On the next pages you will find an example of such a confirmation. The
following questions refer to the described scenario.
Q17: Have you read the situation description carefully? [single choice]; Yes
[Variant of Vaccination Certificate; use case U1] [Each of the following question groups vary minimally due to the
five studied conditions.] Imagine a personalized paper-based vaccination confirmation is being issued after you have
received your COVID-19 vaccination. An example of a possible vaccination confirmation is shown in the following
figure and includes the following information:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

Name and date of birth of the vaccinated person.
Location of the vaccination center.
Vaccine
Day as well as confirmation of both performed necessary vaccinations.
QR-code to verify the performed vaccinations. [except for WHO Certificate]

Q18: Would you have this confirmation issued? [single choice]
• 1 – Certainly-not; 2 – Unlikely; 3 – About-50:50; 4 – Likely; 5 – For-sure
Q19: Why would you (probably) not have this confirmation issued? [if Q18==1 or Q18==2; free text]
Q20: Why are you undecided about whether you would have this confirmation issued? [if Q18==3; free text]
Q21: Why would you (probably) have this confirmation issued? [if Q18==4 or Q18==5; free text]
Proof of Vaccination Imagine that the issued [condition-based] vaccination certificate can also be used to proof
your vaccination status. This should allow additional relaxation, prevent future lock-downs, and curb the spread
of the coronavirus. People with relevant pre-existing conditions, pregnant women, and children are exempt from
this required proof of vaccination against the coronavirus, i. e., generally people for whom vaccination is not recommended from a medical perspective. Please keep in mind the current pandemic and vaccination situation as described
previously.
Q22: Have you read the description text carefully? [single choice]; Yes
[Variant of Vaccination Certificate; use case U2]
Q23: Imagine that proof-of-vaccination against the coronavirus becomes necessary for various purposes – both in
Germany and worldwide. For each of the following statements, please indicate the extent to which you agree
with it: The [condition] vaccination certificate should be shown to. . . [array of single choice questions; answer
option for each: 1 – Fully-disagree, 2 – Mainly-disagree, 3 – Neutral, 4 – Mainly-agree, 5 – Fully-agree]
