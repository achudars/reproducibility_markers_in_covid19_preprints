Abstract
As the number of COVID-19 cases continues to surge and the disease continues to wreak more
havoc globally, new revelations concerning the spread and transmission of the virus continue to
emerge from research every day. Even though laboratory and epidemiological studies have
demonstrated the effects of ambient temperature on the transmission and survival of
coronaviruses, not much has been done on the effects of weather on the spread of COVID-19.
This study investigates the effects of temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed and the
specific government policy intervention of partial lockdown on the new cases of COVID-19
infection in Ghana. Daily data on confirmed cases of COVID-19 from March 13, 2020 to April
21, 2020 were obtained from the official website of Our World in Data (OWID) dedicated to
COVID-19 while satellite climate data for the same period was obtained from the official
website of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA’s) Prediction of
Worldwide Energy Resources (POWER) project. Considering the nature of the data and the
objectives of the study, a time series generalized linear model which allows for regressing on
past observations of the response variable and covariates was used for model fitting. The results
indicate significant effects of maximum temperature, relative humidity and precipitation in
predicting new cases of the disease. Also, results of the intervention analysis indicate that the
null hypothesis of no significant effect of the specific policy intervention of partial lockdown
should be rejected (p-value=0.0164) at a 5% level of significance. These findings provide useful
insights for policymakers and the public.

Introduction

COVID-19 continues to wreak more havoc globally [1], [2]. As the number of infections keep
surging high, deaths continue to increase at no small rate, active cases continue to scare the
world [3], and a possible vaccine invention seems to be several months (if not years) away from
now (though we do not lack the expertise, the technology and funding for such an expedition),
and its treatment the world is quite unsure, leaving us all in horrendous fear. This pandemic has
touched everything and activity in this world and has sent the world experts in health and data
science to work to find possible solutions to this pandemic, while the experts in economics and
policy makers have concerned themselves with the alleviation of the impact of COVID-19 on
their nations’ economy, its people and their businesses.
Researchers have investigated the role of pre-existing conditions such as aging, hypertension,
etc. on COVID-19 deaths [4], [5], environmental factors that influences COVID-19 deaths [5],
[6] and the role of climate on COVID-19 related deaths and new confirmed cases [7], [8].
The relationships between climate and infectious diseases have long been established as
seasonal variations and climate sensitivities are well known to explain some variability in many
infectious diseases. Statistical, process-based, and landscape models are the key categories of
models for the estimation of potential climate effects on infectious diseases. These three model
categories tackle very different problems. Statistical models for instance, require that the
relationship between the current geographic spread of the disease and actual localized climatespecific conditions be inferred empirically [9].
Hitherto, there have been the confirmations that ultraviolet light has a sterilizing effect, because
the radiation damages the virus’s genetic material and its ability to replicate [10], [11]. This was
first put out by [10], whose findings informed us that temperature and irradiance of COVID-19
will decide the trajectory of the pandemic at warmer regions as well as whether rising
temperatures will change direction and have consequences on public health policy. They also
showed that case and death counts at higher temperatures (>14 °C) when aligned for the
epidemic stage had significantly lower rates of growth. However, according to [8], in warmweather locations such as Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand, COVID-19 have also proven
lethal and pose wider concerns on the environmental factors.
[12] studied the association between temperature and number of new infections in 122 cities in
China and made some important revelations including the fact that temperature less than 3 °C
was positively linked to newly confirmed COVID-19 cases. Another work done by [13] on the
“role of temperature and humidity in the modulation of the doubling time of COVID-19 cases”
affirms what was revealed by [12] and [10]. Their conclusion was that, temperature and
humidity explain a total of 18% variability in the disease doubling time while the rest (82%)
may be attributed to containment initiatives, general health policies, population growth, and
transport or cultural aspects.

In this study, we investigate the role of climate and specific government policy of partial
lockdown in determining the number of new infections or confirmed cases in Ghana and to
predict the future occurrences of this outbreak in the country. [14]–[16] studied the effects of
lockdown on the number of new confirmed cases and/or on deaths. All of which revealed that
lockdown serves an important intervention for preventing and minimizing the impact of an
outbreak. Searching through literature, it appears Ghana at the moment does not have a
statistical model that could predict future occurrences of new confirmed cases of COVID-19. To
that extent, this study is novel.

2.2 Data
Daily data on new cases of COVID-19 from March 13, 2020 to April 21, 2020 were obtained
from the official website of Our World in Data (OWID) dedicated to COVID-19
(https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data).
On the other hand, daily satellite climate data covering the same study period on maximum
temperature, humidity, precipitation and maximum wind speed were obtained from the official
website of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA’s) Prediction of
Worldwide Energy Resources (POWER) project (https://power.larc.nasa.gov/data-accessviewer/).

2.3 Statistical analysis
To model the daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Ghana, which is a count variable, the
generalized linear model (GLM) framework for time series of counts by [17] was adopted. These
are models whose conditional mean of the response variable depends on previous observations of
covariates and on its own previous values.
Denote the new cases of COVID-19 by {𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡 ∶ 𝑡𝑡 ∈ ℕ}, and denote by {𝑋𝑋𝑡𝑡 ∶ 𝑡𝑡 ∈ ℕ} a time⏉

varying 𝑟𝑟-dimensional covariate vector, say 𝑿𝑿𝑡𝑡 = �𝑋𝑋𝑡𝑡,1 , . . . , 𝑋𝑋𝑡𝑡,𝑟𝑟 � . The conditional mean
𝐸𝐸(𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡 |ℱ𝑡𝑡−1 ) of the new cases is modeled by a process, say {⋋𝑡𝑡 : 𝑡𝑡 ∈ ℕ}, such that 𝐸𝐸 (𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡 |ℱ𝑡𝑡−1 ) =
⋋𝑡𝑡 . Denote by ℱ𝑡𝑡 the history of the joint process {𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡 ,⋋𝑡𝑡 , 𝑿𝑿𝑡𝑡+1 ∶ 𝑡𝑡 ∈ ℕ} up to time 𝑡𝑡 including
the covariate information at time 𝑡𝑡 + 1. The general form of the model of interest developed by
[17] is given in equation (1).

(1)

Where 𝑔𝑔 ∶ ℝ+ → ℝ is a link function and 𝑔𝑔� ∶ ℕ0 → ℝ is a transformational function. The
parameter vector 𝜼𝜼 = (𝜂𝜂1 , … , 𝜂𝜂𝑟𝑟 )⏉ corresponds to the effects of covariates. To allow for
regression on arbitrary past observations of the response, define a set 𝑃𝑃 = �𝑖𝑖1 , 𝑖𝑖2 , … , 𝑖𝑖𝑝𝑝 � and
integers 0 < 𝑖𝑖1 < 𝑖𝑖2 … < 𝑖𝑖𝑝𝑝 < ∞, with 𝑝𝑝 ∈ ℕ0 . This enables regression on the lagged
observations 𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡−𝑖𝑖1 , 𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡−𝑖𝑖2 , … , 𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡−𝑖𝑖𝑝𝑝 . Parameters of the autocorrelation terms are represented by αℓ
and 𝛽𝛽𝑘𝑘 .

The effect of government policy intervention such as the partial lockdown of the two largest
cities in Ghana (Accra and Kumasi) and their environs on the daily confirmed cases of COVID19 was analyzed using methods to test for such intervention effects developed by [18], [19].
These methods employ an approximate score test which has asymptotically a 𝜒𝜒 2 distribution,
assuming some regularity conditions [19].
Data analysis and model fitting was done in R [20] using the “tscount” package [21].

Descriptive statistics for the daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 and weather variables in Ghana
are presented in Table 1. As of April 21, 2020 Ghana had recorded a total of 1,040 cases of
COVID-19 and an average of about 26.72 new cases every day. Regarding the weather variables,
average daily maximum temperature, precipitation, humidity and maximum wind speed were
34.4°C, 2.56mm, 68.99% and 3.33m/s respectively.

Figure 2 shows time series of daily new cases of COVID-19, maximum temperature,
precipitation, humidity and maximum wind speed. The plot is an excellent way to begin
comprehending the sort of process that produced the data and the relationships that exists therein.
It is observed from the plot that neither the daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 nor the weather
variables show any trend.

March 13, 2020 to April 21, 2020

3.2 Relationship between weather variables and new cases of COVID-19
Correlations between the weather variables and confirmed cases of COVID-19 are shown in
Figure 3. While the new cases of COVID-19 correlated negatively with maximum temperature
and humidity, it rather correlated positively with precipitation and maximum wind. This means
that increasing maximum temperature and humidity results in decreasing new cases of COVID19 whereas increasing precipitation and maximum wind results in increasing new cases of
COVID-19. Among the weather variables, weak correlations were observed.

Figure 3: Correlations between confirmed cases of COVID-19 and the weather variables
Estimates of the model parameters are presented in Table 2. The log-linear model with the
logarithmic link was chosen for model fitting because it allows for negative covariate effects.
Also, in order to capture the short range serial dependence, a first order autoregressive term
(beta_1) was included. Maximum temperature (Max_Temp), precipitation (Precipitation),
relative humidity (Humidity), and maximum wind speed (Max_Wind) were included as
explanatory variables. A deterministic covariate (linearTrend) was included to describe a linear
trend.
The fitted model for the number of new cases of COVID-19 (New_Cases𝑡𝑡 ) in day 𝑡𝑡 is
accordingly given by
New_Cases𝑡𝑡 |ℱ𝑡𝑡−1 ~ 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃(𝜆𝜆𝑡𝑡 )

It is observed from Table 2 that the 95% confidence interval for the estimated coefficient
corresponding to the first order autocorrelation (beta_1) does not contain zero, indicating a clear
dependence of confirmed COVID-19 cases on the number of new cases of the preceding day. It
is also observed that three of the weather variables considered (maximum temperature,
precipitation and relative humidity) were significant predictors of the number of new cases of
COVID-19. However, maximum wind speed was not a significant predictor of the confirmed
cases of COVID-19. The linear trend was also found to be significant.

The model diagnostics are presented in Figure 4. Autocorrelation function of residuals, shown in
Figure 4 (top left), does not exhibit any serial correlation or seasonality which has not been taken
into account by the model. Figure 4 (bottom left) points to a probability integral transform (PIT)
histogram which appears to approach uniformity. Figure 4 (top right) indicates the overall
behavior of the data set. Figure 4 (bottom right) shows a marginal calibration plot with minor
fluctuations about zero. Hence the probabilistic calibration of the Poisson model is sufficient.

3.3 Model validation
Time series of the actual daily new cases of COVID-19 used for model fitting and predicted
cases based on the fitted model are shown in Figure 5. It is observed that the overall trend of the
two curves is similar, and the values themselves are very close in some cases. This is an
indication of a good model.

3.3 Intervention analysis
Here, we test whether there was an abrupt shift in the number of new cases of COVID-19
occurring when the partial lockdown was introduced on March 30, 2020. The approximate score
test was applied. With a p-value of 0.0164 (Table 3), the null hypothesis of no significant effect
of the specific policy intervention of partial lockdown is rejected at a 5% significance level.
Hence, partial lockdown of the two largest cities and their environs in Ghana significantly
influenced the daily confirmed cases of COVID-19.

Discussion

In this study, we explored the possible effects of weather and government policy intervention on
the daily confirmed cases of COVID-19. Specifically, the study considered the policy of partial
lockdown of the two major cities (Accra and Kumasi) and their environs. The generalized linear
model (GLM) framework for time series of counts by [17] was adopted for model fitting and
analysis, which allows for regressing on past observations of the response variable and
covariates.
The results indicated that daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Ghana correlated negatively
with maximum temperature and relative humidity. Previous studies on SARS-CoV and MERSCoV also highlighted temperature as an important factor in the survival and transmission of such
coronaviruses [22]–[26].
Recent studies have also underscored the importance of weather on the transmission of COVID19 in particular. For instance, using a Modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (MSEIR) model, [27] confirmed that transmission rate decreased with the increase of temperature,
leading to further decrease of infection rate and outbreak scale in 31 provincial-level regions in
mainland China. [28] also in a study suggested that for northern hemisphere countries, the rate of
transmission of COVID-19 cases would significantly decrease as a result of warmer weather.
[29] in a study stated that local weather condition with low temperature, mild diurnal
temperature range and low humidity likely favor the transmission of COVID-19 cases in China.
[30] in a study, analyzed the association between COVID-19 and climate indicators in New York
City, USA. The authors used a secondary published data from New York city health services and
National weather service, USA. The climate indicators included in the study were average
temperature, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, rainfall, average humidity, wind
speed, and air quality. Using Kendall and Spearman rank correlation tests for the data analysis,
[30] suggested that that average temperature, minimum temperature, and air quality were
significantly associated with COVID-19. Finally, using a global data on COVID-19 reported
cases until 29th February 2020 and climate temperature data, [31] suggested that higher average
temperature was strongly associated with lower COVID-19 incidence for temperatures of 1°C
and higher.

Our results further indicated the significance of maximum temperature, relative humidity and
precipitation in predicting daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Ghana. This is consistent with
the results of [32], who implemented a restricted cubic spline function and generalized linear
mixture model to analyze the relationships between temperature and COVID-19 transmission in
429 cities in the world and suggested that to a certain extent, temperature could significantly
change COVID-19 transmission, and there might be a best temperature for the viral transmission,
which may partly explain why it first broke out in Wuhan, China. [33] also investigated the
influence of air temperature and relative humidity on the transmission of COVID-19 in 100
Chinese cities and suggested that, under a linear regression framework, high temperature and
high humidity significantly reduce the transmission of COVID-19.
Additionally, results of the intervention analysis conducted in this study indicated that the null
hypothesis of no significant effect of the specific policy intervention of partial lockdown should
be rejected (p-value=0.0164) at a 5% level of significance. This finding underscores the
significance of the partial lockdown of the two largest cities (Accra and Kumasi) and their
environs in controlling the spread of the disease in Ghana. A number of studies [14]–[16] have
been conducted on the effects of lockdown on the number of new confirmed cases and/or on
deaths. All of which reveal that lockdown serves an important intervention for preventing and
minimizing the impact of an outbreak.

Conclusion

In this paper, we investigated the effects of weather and government policy intervention on the
daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Ghana. The results indicated that while daily confirmed
cases of COVID-19 correlated negatively with maximum temperature and humidity, it rather
correlated positively with precipitation and maximum wind. Also, maximum temperature,
humidity and precipitation were significant predictors of daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 in
Ghana. Furthermore, results of the intervention analysis revealed that the specific government
policy of partial lockdown of the two largest cities (Accra and Kumasi) and their surroundings
significantly influenced the daily confirmed cases of COVID-19, which provides useful
implications for policy makers and the public. For instance, knowing that precipitation and the
daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 are positively correlated could help public health responses
by informing key preparations as we move into the rainy season.
