In the COVID–19 pandemic, among the more controversial issues is the use of face coverings. To address this
we show that the underlying physics ensures particles with diameters & 1 µm are efficiently filtered out by a
simple cotton or surgical mask. For particles in the submicron range the efficiency depends on the material
properties of the masks, though generally the filtration efficiency in this regime varies between 30 to 60 %
and multi-layered cotton masks are expected to be comparable to surgical masks.
Respiratory droplets are conventionally divided into coarse droplets (& 5–10 µm) responsible for droplet
transmission and aerosols (. 5–10 µm) responsible for airborne transmission. Masks are thus expected to
be highly effective at preventing droplet transmission, with their effectiveness limited only by the mask fit,
compliance and appropriate usage. By contrast, knowledge of the size distribution of bioaerosols and the
likelihood that they contain virus is essential to understanding their effectiveness in preventing airborne
transmission. We argue from literature data on SARS-CoV-2 viral loads that the finest aerosols (. 1 µm)
are unlikely to contain even a single virion in the majority of cases; we thus expect masks to be effective at
reducing the risk of airborne transmission in most settings.
I.

INTRODUCTION

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought critically neglected areas of infection control onto the global stage.1
Most notably this includes the risk of airborne transmission and the strategies required to mitigate it.2 The prevailing view presupposes a binary classification between
large and small droplets (also called aerosols), which respectively transmit disease via the droplet and airborne
routes. This dichotomy originates in research conducted
in the 1930s,3 and underlies current measures for infection control. Arbitrary threshold diameters (typically 5
to 10 µm) are widely used to distinguish aerosols from
large droplets, which have been critiqued by various authors e.g. in Refs. 4–7. In any case, the size distribution
of respiratory particles (and their resulting dynamical behaviour) is wide and continuous.
Many outbreaks are suggestive of airborne
transmission,2,8 aerosolised SARS-CoV-2 virus remains viable under laboratory conditions,9,10 viable
virus has been cultured from the air surrounding
sick patients,11 and its predecessor SARS-CoV-1 is
considered to have been transmitted by the airborne
route.2,12–15 Taken together these present a plausible
case that the airborne route is significant in transmission
of SARS-CoV-2,2,8,16–19 although the transmission

mechanism by air is complex and many questions remain
including the typical viral load of airborne exhaled
particles and the required infectious dose. However,
absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, and so
a precautionary approach is justified to improve public
safety1,2,20,21 similar to that employed to suppress transmission by large droplets or surface contamination where
the evidence of transmission is also incomplete.17,22
Use of face coverings in public spaces is mandatory
or strongly encouraged around the world.23,24 Agencies
like the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention
recommend members of the public wear reusable fabric coverings,25 whereas disposable surgical masks are
more common in East Asian countries such as China.26
Widespread use of surgical masks will inevitably send
enormous volumes of plastic waste into the environment,
which can take decades (or even centuries) to degrade;27 a
central question is thus how do fabric coverings perform
relative to surgical masks? The efficacy of both types
of face coverings is controversial,21,28,29 largely because
the gold standard of medical evidence is not available for
their use; that being said, the current evidence is indicative that they reduce airborne spread.21,29,30
It would be unethical to conduct a randomised-placebo
controlled trial with high-risk activities such as the
spread of SARS-CoV-2, and so we must rely on alternative forms of evidence for the effectiveness of face coverings such as plausibility arguments.21,31,32 Here we lay
out such a plausibility argument, by combining experimental literature and theoretical calculations. Our goal

2

MASKS ARE PERSONAL AIR FILTERS

A mask or face covering is nothing more or less than an
air filter worn on the face. How air filters work and how
efficient they are at filtering out particles of differing sizes
is reasonably well understood.35,36 Droplets and coarser
aerosols (with diameter & 1 µm), which are more capable of containing significant viral doses (cf. next section),
are more easily filtered because they are less mobile; fine
aerosols (0.1 to 1 µm) by contrast are transported around
the fibre by the gas flow. We illustrate this schematically
in Fig. 1(a).
In Fig. 1(b) we have plotted both measurements of
surgical mask filtering efficiency (symbols) and theoretical calculations (curves). The theoretical calculations involved following the trajectories of particles inserted into
the gas flow around fibres, described elsewhere35 and in
the Supplementary Material (SM). The efficiency is plotted as a function of the particle diameter, because the
particle size ultimately determines how hard or easy it is
to filter out. The measurements and model agree on the
same basic facts:
• Filtering efficiency is essentially 100 % for particles
& 5 µm in diameter or larger.
• However, filtering efficiency is low (30 to 60 %) in
the range 0.1 to 1 µm.
These predictions make quantitative the picture we laid
out in the preceding paragraph and Fig. 1(a). Both surgical and cotton masks are thus only partially effective
at filtering out sub-micrometre aerosols. However, their
efficiency rapidly increases as the size increases beyond
a micrometre, so masks are generally highly effective in
this regime. For reference, SARS-CoV-2 is approximately
0.1 µm in diameter,37 so any particle larger than this can
potentially carry a virus. However, in the next section
we will argue that only particles larger than & 1 µm are
likely to contain any virus in the majority of cases; thus
filtration efficiency in this regime is sufficient to significantly reduce transmission.
Surgical masks are disordered homogeneous arrangements of fibres (cf. Fig. 2(b)), whereas cloth face coverings are typically more ordered (e.g. woven fabric in
Fig. 2(a)). More work needs to be done to understand
the effect of heterogeneities in cloth masks, but we can

is to suggest more precisely in which scenarios face coverings are expected to be effective in reducing transmission
of SARS-CoV-2. We argue that face coverings do not
eliminate the risk of secondary transmissions, especially
in high-risk settings such as in hospitals or amongst large
crowds, but should significantly reduce the risk in most
settings. Moreover, we will suggest criteria where washable cloth masks are expected to be comparable to disposable surgical masks; these may be preferred because
they generate less plastic waste.

particle size. (a) Diagram of capture of viral particles by a
fibre within a mask. Larger particles are more easily captured
because they are less mobile; smaller aerosols by contrast are

efficiency of perfectly fitting (b) surgical masks and (c) cloth
masks formed from 4 identical plain-woven cotton layers are

measurements from Refs. 33 and 34 (points) and predictions

Supplementary Material. The shaded envelopes around the

obtain some understanding by approximating them as a
homogeneous medium35 and making a small correction
for the effect of inter-yarn pores on collection of submicrometer particles (SM). In Fig. 1(c) we perform such a
calculation for two masks formed from 4 layers of plainwoven cotton fabrics sampled in Ref. 34. Despite considerable variation between different fabrics, the behaviour

3

It is useful to compare the effect of wearing a mask
with social distancing 1 to 2 m apart. Droplets ∼ 20 µm
(and smaller) can easily travel several metres,40–43 so a
perfectly fitting mask would be superior to social distancing for droplets of this size. However, in practice masks
are inevitably far from airtight and so many droplets will
bypass the mask around the leakage sites (estimated as
around 20 % in Ref. 44), and so there is still a case for
social distancing even when all parties are masked.
Neither social distancing over 1 to 2 m nor masks are
expected to completely mitigate any risk of transmission
from sub-micrometre aerosols, because of their long persistence times6 and the poor filtration efficiency in this
range. The capturing efficiency for particles of diameter
0.1 to 1 µm is only 30 to 60 %, which is a possible cause
for concern if these fine aerosols can transmit the virus.
Note that respirators (e.g. N95/KN95/FFP2) make use
of so-called electret fibres which can sustain considerable
electrostatic charge;45,46 this increases the efficiency in
the 0.1 to 1 µm regime. In the next section we will argue that such high-performance filters are unlikely to be
needed for most members of the public, and the expected
efficacy of face coverings is sufficient for preventing community transmission.

surgical mask

Returning to the mechanism, we briefly discuss the
physics underlying this behaviour (more details can be
found in Ref. 35). Masks are fundamentally arrays of
fibres, see Fig. 2, so air must flow around and between
these fibres. Particles a fraction of a micrometre in size
have very little inertia and so tend to follow the air flow
through the mask faithfully and are not filtered. However, the particle inertia varies with its mass i.e. the cube
of its diameter (its volume). This means it rapidly increases with diameter. Beyond around 1 µm in diameter
the particles have too much inertia to follow the air as
it twists in between the fibres, and so they impact onto
the fibres. On microscopic lengthscales most surfaces are
attractive, so colliding particles will stick and remain on
the fibres.35 Because of this basic physics, the filtering
efficiency of particles larger than ∼ 5 µm is likely to be
limited only by the leakage of air around the mask. For
the intermediate range 1 to 5 µm the exact behaviour
will depend on the details of the material, but the rapid
rise in filtration efficiency with particle size is a robust
feature.35 Finally, we note that the filtration efficiency
increases for capture of the smallest aerosols (. 0.3 µm)
in Fig. 1(b-c) where capture is enhanced by Brownian
motion. We have not focused on this mechanism because
such small aerosols are highly unlikely to carry significant
doses of virus, and our theory is thus less accurate in this
region.

woven cotton

is more-or-less identical to surgical masks; this is broadly
in agreement with the findings of Refs. 33, 34, 38, and
39 and demonstrates that reusable cloth masks can be
suitable replacements for disposable surgical masks.

FIG. 2.
Fabrics are broadly categorised as knitted (not
shown), woven or non-woven. (a) Woven fabrics formed by
intersecting perpendicular yarns (the “warp” and “weft”). (b)
Nonwoven fabrics are formed by entangling fibres through
other means, resulting in less ordered arrangements. Scanning
electron microscope images of example fabrics show scalebars
of (a) 100 µm and (b) 50 µm.

III. WHICH RESPIRATORY DROPLETS AND
AEROSOLS ARE LIKELY TO CONTAIN SIGNIFICANT
DOSES OF VIRUS?

To assess the effect of mask wearing we need to know
which respiratory droplets and aerosols are likely to carry
significant doses of virus. We thus need to know the size
distribution of exhaled droplets, and how concentrated
the (viable) virus is in droplets produced by shedding in
an infected individual.
Instead of an arbitrary size cutoff, expiratory particles
can be more meaningfully categorised by their site of origin in the respiratory system. Larger droplets are more
likely to be deposited in the respiratory tract,51–54 so
a large droplet originating deep in the respiratory tract
would immediately deposit and be unlikely to escape; as
a rule, smaller droplets emerge from lower in the respiratory tract. The majority of droplets produced in the
oral cavity vary in size from ∼10 to 1000 µm,50 whereas
droplets produced in the Larynx and the lower respiratory tract are seen in the range ∼0.1 to 10 µm.5,49,50,55
The former presumably contain the majority of virus because volume scales as the diameter cubed 1 , but the
latter are expected to be responsible for transmission by

the airborne route so they will be our focus.
Fluid particles immediately begin to evaporate upon
exhalation40,41 and the aerosols will reach their dessicated steady states (which we will refer to as “droplet
nuclei”) in less than 1 s.57 We use parameterisations of
the measured size distributions (i.e. uncorrected for evaporation) reported in Refs. 49 and 50 in our calculations. Their hydrated state would be around a factor of

∼ 3 larger on exhalation, allowing for coverings to filter
aerosols more effectively at the source.35,41
Testing for SARS-CoV-2 is primarily performed by detecting the presence of viral RNA in respiratory fluid using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR). The distribution of concentrations of viral RNA,
the viral load, using this technique has been reported in
Refs. 47 and 48 which we show in Fig. 3(a). The distribution is extremely broad, spanning around 10–12 orders of
magnitude: patients in the upper tail of the distribution
(the “superreplicators”) are responsible for hosting most
of the virus in circulation, which may be a factor in superspreading events. Each study sampled the viral loads
from thousands of patients in all stages of disease progression. These studies primarily involved testing nasoand oropharyngeal samples, which we assume to be representative of all respiratory fluids where data is lacking.
Finally, we note that there is ample time for evaporation
between sample collection and testing in these studies so
we assume these concentrations to refer to the dessicated
states (the nuclei).
Viral load typically peaks around the onset of
symptoms58 which is also the most contagious stage of
disease progression;8 we thus expect viral loads from the
upper half of the distributions in Fig. 3(a) to be most
relevant to disease transmission. The actual number of
viable virus, as measured from viral plaque assays, in
aerosol vs the RT-PCR result is typically only one part
in 102 to 104 .10,56 We thus take the upper limit of viral
loads as 108 to 1010 ml−1 instead of 1010 to 1012 ml−1 .
The probability that an aerosol contains at least one
virus depends on its volume and the viral load. By combining this information we can estimate the fraction of
particles at any specific size that contains the virus, and
thus the variation in the relative number of particles that
contain the virus across the size distribution (details of
calculation in SM). In Fig. 3(b-c) we show the resulting
distributions produced in speech and coughing. For the
moderately large viral load of 108 ml−1 the majority of viral aerosols extend into the micron regime & 1 µm. Only
for extremely large viral loads of 1010 ml−1 do the submicron droplets begin to contain significant numbers of
virus. Thus submicron droplets should be unimportant
vectors in the majority of people infected with SARSCoV-2.

IV. ARE FACE COVERINGS LIKELY TO PREVENT
SPREAD IN COMMUNITY SETTINGS?

To understand how masks reduce transmission we need
to compare the filtration efficiency of masks in Fig. 1(b)
with the droplets that need to be filtered. We do this
by showing the distribution of viral droplets that pass
through a surgical mask in this with dashed lines in
Fig. 3(b-c). We see that masks remove the majority of
viral aerosols, leaving primarily those in the submicron
regime as expected. Moreover the masks are more effec-

TABLE I. Expected efficacy of surgical masks at filtering
virus-laden expiratory particles involved in different transmission modes. These numbers are expected to be similar
for multi-layered cloth masks (cf. Fig. 1). The lower bounds
were obtained assuming large viral loads of 1010 ml−1 and
20% mask leakage on inhalation (consistent with Ref. 44) and
an estimated 40% leakage for exhalation. The upper bounds
were obtained assuming the median viral load of 106 ml−1 and
perfect fit (no mask leakage).

tive with decreasing viral loads, so with the exception of
“superreplicators” we anticipate masks to be highly effective at reducing transmission rates from the vast majority
of people infected with SARS-CoV-2. Where transmission by submicron aerosols is possible, masks can only
partially reduce the risk.
While our focus has been on the airborne route, we
note here that given face coverings are essentially perfect filters of particles larger than 5 µm in diameter (assuming perfect compliance and appropriate usage) they
should provide excellent protection for transmission by
the large droplet route and prevent surface contamination. As such, we expect them to provide a net-benefit
regardless of whether transmission is dominated by the
aerosol or droplet routes.
A key limiting factor for mask efficiency is how much
leakage there is around the sides of the mask. For inhalation we expect this to be around 20 %,44 though we are
not aware of any data on exhalation so we make a conservative (i.e. pessimistic) estimate of 40 % leakage. Note
that personal masks can be customised to the individual
to improve the fit, so these are upper bounds. Accounting
for mask leakage we estimate the total fraction of droplets
and aerosols filtered in table I when masks are worn by
either the (susceptible) inhaler, the (infected) exhaler or
both people. Even with greater leakage masking the exhaler is generally more effective at preventing airborne
transmission than masking the inhaler, because aerosols
are larger (and thus filtration is more effective) before the
aerosols evaporate into their dessicated states. We have
underestimated the protection from large droplets whilst
masking the exhaler because the mask would deflect and
remove momentum from the expiratory jets;59,60 taking
this into account, masking the exhaler (“source control”)
is expected to offer more protection than masking the inhaler. In all cases masking both people is more effective
as this partially makes up for deficiencies in leakage and
the worse filtration in the submicron regime.

V.

DISCUSSION

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has exposed critical
knowledge gaps in infection control and prevention.1,61
We believe these gaps necessitate cross-disciplinary collaborations on matters of public policy, and in this spirit
we have presented a physical scientists’ perspective on
the effectiveness of face coverings.
Both masks made from simple cotton fabrics, and surgical masks, are predicted to reduce transmission of respiratory viruses. Cloth masks can be washed and reused
making them preferable to disposable surgical masks because they generate less plastic waste which is better for
the environment. As masks are cheap, and wearing a
mask is a relatively minor inconvenience compared to
contracting SARS-CoV-2, recommending mask use is a
simple way to reduce transmission. The extent of the reduction depends to some degree on whether transmission
is via large droplets or aerosols, however we have argued
that in all cases masks are likely to significantly reduce
the risk from viral particulates. Due to the inevitable
poor fit of these masks, filtration is never 100 % effective
for any transmission mode, but they filter larger droplets
much more efficiently than smaller ones.
Transmission of respiratory viruses is complex and
poorly understood, so more data is needed. We need
either direct data on transmission rates as a function of
conditions, with and without masks, and a much better
idea of the infectivity of aerosolised virus including the
required dose for infection Both of these will be challenging but both are possible. However, the basic physics of
filtration tells us about how capture varies with droplet
size.
Both masks and social distancing reduce the exposed
dose by some percentage, dependent on how big the
droplets are that are involved in transmission. It now
seems well established that with SARS-CoV-2 some infected people have viral loads thousands or millions of
times higher than others.47,48 Thus a say 50 % reduction
in dose due to mask wearing corresponds to very different absolute reductions in dose from infected people with
high and low viral loads. As typically the viral load of
an infectious person will not be known, other forms of
interventions may be warranted in addition to masking.
