Abstract
As COVID-19 sweeps the globe, outcomes depend on effective relationships
between the public and decision-makers. In the UK there were uncivil tweets to
MPs about perceived UK tardiness to go into lockdown. The pandemic has led to
increased attention on ministers with a role in the crisis. However, generally this
surge has been civil. Prime minister Boris Johnson’s severe illness with COVID-19
resulted in an unusual peak of supportive responses on Twitter. Those who
receive more COVID-19 mentions in their replies tend to receive less abuse
(significant negative correlation). Following Mr Johnson’s recovery, with rising
economic concerns and anger about lockdown violations by influential figures,
abuse levels began to rise in May. 1,902 replies to MPs within the study period
were found containing hashtags or terms that refute the existence of the virus
(e.g. #coronahoax, #coronabollocks, 0.04% of a total 4.7 million replies, or 9%
of the number of mentions of “stay home save lives” and variants). These have
tended to be more abusive. Evidence of some members of the public believing in
COVID-19 conspiracy theories was also found. Higher abuse levels were
associated with hashtags blaming China for the pandemic.

Introduction
A successful response to the COVID-19 pandemic depends on effective relationships
between the public and decision-makers. Yet the pandemic arises in the midst of
the age of misinformation [1, 2],[1] , creating a perfect storm. Polarisation and echo
chambers make it harder for the right information to reach people, and for them to
trust it when it does [3], and the damage can be counted in lives.[2] Online verbal
abuse is an intrinsic aspect of the misinformation picture, being both cause and
consequence: the quality of information and debate is damaged as certain voices are
silenced/driven out of the space,[3] and the escalation of divisive “outrage” culture
leads to angry and aggressive expressions [4].
This white paper charts Twitter abuse in replies to UK MPs, and a number of
other prominent/relevant accounts, from before the start of the pandemic in the

UK until late May, in order to plot the health of relationships of UK citizens with
their elected representatives through the unprecedented challenges of the COVID19 epidemic. We consider reactions to different individuals and members of different
political parties, and how they interact with events relating to the virus. We review
the dominant hashtags on Twitter as the country moves through different phases.
The six periods considered are as follows:
• February 7th to 29th inclusive: Control: little attention to COVID-19
• March 1st to 22nd inclusive: Growing awareness of COVID-19, culminating
in the week in which we were advised but not yet obliged to begin social
distancing
• March 23rd to March 31st: Beginning of lockdown
• April 1st to April 16th: Middle-lockdown
• April 17th to May 9th: Emergence of global backlash against lockdown
• May 10th to May 25th: Easing of lockdown
We show trends in abuse levels, for MPs overall as well as for particular individuals
and for parties. We conclude with a section that compares prevalence of conspiracy
theories, and contextualises them against other popular topics/concerns on Twitter.
We begin with a brief summary of related work, before outlining the methodology
used and then progressing onto findings.

Related work
A raft of work has rallied to focus attention on COVID-19, as the scientific community recognises the extent to which outcomes depend on information and strategy.
Research has begun to address the role of internet and social media in development
of attitudes, compliance, and adoption of effective responses, and the way misinformation can derail these [5, 6, 7]. Furthermore, as the pandemic increasingly puts
pressure on the divisions in society, with mortality risk much greater for some communities than others,[4] we are forced to recognise the pandemic as a highly political
issue (e.g. Motta et al [8]). Pew[5] repeatedly find attitudes toward the disease split
along partisan lines. In the age of COVID-19, polarisation can be deadly.
Twitter has become a favoured platform for politicians across the globe, providing
a means by which the public can communicate directly with them. Previous work [9,
10, 11, 12] has shown rising levels of hostility towards UK politicians on Twitter
in the context of divisive issues, and we also see partisan operators seeking to
gain influence in the space [13]. Women and minorities have been shown to have
different and potentially more threatening online experiences, raising concerns about
representation [10, 14, 15]. Moving into the COVID-19 era, key questions raised
therefore are about the impact of the pandemic on hostility levels towards decisionmakers, the opportunities it presents for partisan operators to further damage social
cohesion, and the impact on effectiveness and experience of women and minority
politicians. This work focuses on the first two of these subjects.

Methodology
In this work we utilize a large tweet collection on which a natural language processing has been performed in order to identify abusive language. This methodology is
presented in detail by Gorrell et al [10] and summarised here.
A rule-based approach was used to detect abusive language. An extensive vocabulary list of slurs (e.g. “idiot”), offensive words such as the “f” word and potentially
sensitive identity markers, such as “lesbian” or “Muslim”, forms the basis of the
approach. The slur list contained 1081 abusive terms or short phrases in British
and American English, comprising mostly an extensive collection of insults, racist
and homophobic slurs, as well as terms that denigrate a person’s appearance or
intelligence, gathered from sources that include http://hatebase.org and Farrell
et al [16]. 131 offensive worrds were used, along with 451 sensitive words. “Bleeped”
versions such as “f**k” are also included.
On top of these word lists, 53 rules are layered, specifying how they may be
combined to form an abusive utterance as described above, and including further
specifications such as how to mark quoted abuse, how to type abuse as sexist or
racist, including more complex cases such as “stupid Jew hater” and what phrases
to veto, for example “polish a turd” and “witch hunt”. Making the approach more
precise as to target (whether the abuse is aimed at the politician being replied
to or some third party) was achieved by rules based on pronoun co-occurrence.
The approach is generally successful, but where people make a lot of derogatory
comments about a third party in their replies to a politician, for example racist
remarks about others, there may be a substantial number of false positives.
The abuse detection method underestimates by possibly as much as a factor of
two, finding more obvious verbal abuse, but missing linguistically subtler examples.
This is useful for comparative findings, tracking abuse trends, and for approximation
of actual abuse levels.
The method for detecting COVID-19-related tweets is based on a list of related
terms. This means that tweets that are implicitly about the epidemic but use no
explicit Covid terms, for example, “@BorisJohnson you need to act now,” are not
flagged. The methodology is useful for comparative findings such as who is receiving
the most COVID-19-related tweets, but not for drawing conclusions about absolute
quantities of tweets on that subject.

Corpus
The corpus was created by collecting tweets in real-time using Twitter’s streaming
API. We used the API to follow the accounts of MPs - this means we collected all the
tweets sent by each candidate, any replies to those tweets, and any retweets either
made by the candidate or of the candidate’s own tweets. Note that this approach
does not collect all tweets which an individual would see in their timeline, as it
does not include those in which they are just mentioned. However, “direct replies”
are included. We took this approach as the analysis results are more reliable due
to the fact that replies are directed at the politician who authored the tweet, and
thus, any abusive language is more likely to be directed at them. Data were of a
low enough volume not to be constrained by Twitter rate limits.
The study spans February 7th until May 25th 2020 inclusive, and discusses Twitter
replies to currently serving MPs that have active Twitter accounts (568 MPs in

by MPs, number of retweets authored by them, number of replies written by them, number of
replies received by them, number of abusive replies received by them, and abusive replies received

total). Table 1 gives the overall statistics for the corpus. Dates in the table indicate
a period from midnight to midnight at the start of the given date.
Tweets from earlier in the study have had more time to gather replies. Most replies
occur in the day or two following the tweet being made, but some tweets continue
to receive attention over time, and events may lead to a resurgence of focus on an
earlier tweet. Reply numbers are a snapshot at the time of the study.

Findings
We begin with a review of the time period studied, namely February 7th until May
25th inclusive. After that, findings are organised into time periods with distinct
characteristics with regards to the course of the pandemic in the UK, as listed in
the introduction. We then include a section on conspiracy theories.
Overview
Fig 1 shows number of replies to prominent politicians since early February, and
shows that for the most part, attention has focused on Boris Johnson. He received
a large peak in Twitter attention on March 27th. 58,286 replies were received in
response to his tweet announcing that he had COVID-19. Abuse was found in 2.3%
of these replies, which is low for a prominent minister as we may discern from
Fig 2, suggesting a generally supportive response to the prime minister’s illness.
Further peaks on Mr Johnson’s timeline correspond to the dates on which he was

admitted to intensive care (April 6th), left hospital to recuperate at Chequers (April
12th), and more recently, began to ease the lockdown (May 10th). The late burst
of attention on other politicians arises from several tweets by ministers in support
of Dominic Cummings, the senior government advisor who chose to travel north to
his parents’ home in the early stages of his illness with COVID-19.
The timeline in Fig 2 makes it easier to see abuse levels overall, toward all MPs. It
is on a per-week basis since mid-February, and shows a rise in abuse, back up to over
4% around the time of the introduction of social distancing, before dipping, and
then gradually beginning to rise again in recent times. The dip may be explained,
in part at least, by an unusual degree of positive attention focused on the prime
minister as he faced personal adversity, depressing the abuse level as a percentage
of all replies. We see that the macro-average abuse level (red line) remains relatively
steady.
Difference in responses to different parties
Fig 3 shows abuse received as a percentage of all replies received by MPs, for
each of the time periods studied in more detail below. We see that on the whole,
response to the Conservative party has been favourable, as indicated above. The
exception is after May 10th, when the negative response to Dominic Cummings’

decision to travel north with COVID-19 symptoms came to the fore. Responses to
Liberal Democrat MPs are more erratic due to their lower number.[6] In previous
studies, we have found Conservatives receiving higher abuse levels, yet here we see
Labour politicians receiving more abuse in most periods. This was in evidence even
in February, so precedes the pandemic. Twitter has tended to be left-leaning in the
UK [17] - it remains to be seen if this is the beginning of a swing to the right or if
it is specific to the times, e.g. arising from a desire to trust authority during times
of crisis [18].
There is a significant negative correlation between receiving a high level of Covidrelated attention and receiving abuse (-0.52, p¡0.001, Feb 7th to May 25th, Spearman’s PMCC). We see this clearly in prominent government figures below, who are
receiving the lion’s share of the COVID-19 attention and lower levels of abuse than
we usually see for them. However the correlation is significant across the sample of
all MPs, suggesting perhaps that an association with the crisis is generally good for
the image.
Long-term context
From the timeline in Fig 4, we see that aside from a blip around the 2015 general
election, abuse toward MPs on Twitter has been tending to rise from a minimum of
2% of replies in 2015, peaking mid-2019 at over 5% with a smaller peak of around
4.5% around the 2019 general election. After the election, however, abuse toward
MPs fell to around 3.5%.[7] A spike followed before the beginning of lockdown,
before a low, and more recently, a rise, as discussed above. However the low was
not as low as in 2015, and the high is not as high as the Brexit acrimony of 2019.
[6]

The peak in early March arises with a now-deleted tweet from Layla Moran. The peak
in late April/early May arises with the start of Ramadan and a supportive tweet from Ed
Davey.
[7]
Due to the variable quality nature of the historical data, the time periods across which
these data points are averaged varies, which may lead to shorter-term peaks being lost. We
hope to improve on this in future work. Where more datapoints are available, the graph
appears more spiky, as we see with the richer recent data.

indicate party membership; blue for Conservative, red for Labour.

Figure 5 Number of replies with an explicit COVID-19 mention as a portion of all replies from
February 7 - 29 2020 inclusive.

The blue line shows micro-averaged abuse as a percentage of replies. The red line
shows macro-averaged abuse percentage (percentage is calculated per person, then
averaged). Where the two lines differ, we can infer an unusual response at that time
particularly to high-profile politicians.
February 7th to 29th
Table 2 provides some quick reference information for the top 20 MPs receiving the
largest number of replies to their Twitter account during the February period. The
column “Authored” refers to the number of tweets originally posted from that account that were not retweets or replies. “replyTo”, refers to all of the replies received
to the individual’s Twitter account in that period. The next column, “Covid”, is
the number of replies received to that account containing an explicit mention of
COVID-19, with the following column representing the number of replies that verbal abuse was found in (“Abusive”). The last three columns present the data in
a comparative fashion. Firstly, we have the percentage of replies that the individual received that were abusive. Next, we have the percentage of replies that were
Covid related. The last column is the percentage of Covid-related replies to that
individual, in comparison with all Covid-related replies received by all MPs. We
have created a table and histogram for each period.

Table 3 Hashtag counts in replies to MPs, February 7-29 inclusive.

We see from Table 2 that Boris Johnson receives the most tweets, with controversial Labour politicians not far behind. Whilst he also receives the most abuse by
volume, as a percentage of replies received, the 3.5% shown here is unusually low
for Mr Johnson compared with our findings in earlier work (e.g. 8.39%[8] in the first
half of 2019). The histogram in 5 shows the number of replies received related to
COVID-19, in comparison with the number of replies received in general for that
period. Once again, this chart indicates that attention to COVID-19 was limited at
the start of the pandemic, but what attention there was to the subject was largely
aimed at Mr Johnson.
Hashtags
The hashtag cloud in 6 above shows that in February, little attention was focused on COVID-19, and Brexit remained the dominant topic in Twitter political
discourse. Table 3 gives the top ten hashtags in numeric terms.
Examples of tweets that attracted particularly abusive responses
In February, COVID-19 was not a major focus. The most abused tweet of the month
was this one, by then-leader of the opposition Jeremy Corbyn, attracting 4% of all
abusive replies to MPs.

Table 4 MPs with greatest number of replies from from March 1st - 22nd 2020 inclusive. Cell colours
indicate party membership; blue for Conservative, red for Labour, yellow for Liberal Democrat.

If there was a case of a young white boy with blonde hair, who later dabbled
in class A drugs and conspired with a friend to beat up a journalist, would
they deport that boy?
Or is it one rule for young black boys born in the Caribbean, and another for
white boys born in the US?
March 1st to 22nd
In this section we review data from March 1st to March 22nd inclusive, when Boris
Johnson made the first announcement that citizens were advised to avoid nonessential contact and journeys.
In Table 4 and Fig 7, one can see how attention on particular individuals has
changed in the first period in March. In the table you can see the number of replies
they receive, the percentage of those replies that are related to COVID-19, and how
this compares with other MP colleagues. Health secretary Matt Hancock became
more prominent on Twitter at this time, though attention was not more abusive.
Attention on chancellor Rishi Sunak also increased and was not abusive. We see a
high level of attention on Boris Johnson, but the abuse level is lower than was seen
for him in previous years (we found 8.39% in the first half of 2019 as mentioned
above; in 2017 as foreign secretary Mr Johnson received similarly high abuse levels
in high volumes). Negative attention on Labour politicians is high, but note that
this was also the case before the start of the epidemic in the UK. A focus on COVID19 is now in evidence (recall that counts for COVID-19 tweets only include explicit
mentions; it is likely that many more replies are about COVID-19).
Hashtags
The word cloud in Fig 8 shows all hashtags in tweets to MPs in earlier part of March,
and unsurprisingly shows a complete topic shift, to the subject of the epidemic, to
the virtual exclusion of all else. The February word cloud shows a variety of nonCovid subjects, such as Brexit, IR35 (tax loophole legislation), the Russia report,
climate change, pension age for women and the accusations against Priti Patel.
Now, almost all hashtags are COVID-19-related. Table 5 gives the counts for the
top ten.[9]
[9]

A non-standard em dash was used in hashtags referring to COVID-19 for a time on
Twitter - in the tables we show a standard em dash.

Examples of tweets that attracted particularly abusive responses
As discussed above, feelings ran high around the beginning of lockdown, and examples of high volume tweets with elevated abuse levels were given. Here we give
tweets receiving high abuse levels.
https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1238365263764041728 (9% of
replies were abusive, tweet received 3% of all abuse to MPs in the period). It
also includes a video.
This country will get through this epidemic, just as it has got through many
tougher experiences before.
Another tweet that gradually rose to become the second most abused tweet by
volume of the period was a now-deleted tweet by Layla Moran defending China,
apropos COVID-19. 14% abuse, 3% of abuse for the period.

No more government time, energy or resources should be wasted on Brexit
this year. Boris Johnson must ask for an extension to the transition period
immediately. #COVID19 is a global emergency.
March 23rd to 31st
For the second period in March from the 23rd - 31st, attention on individual MPs
was reshuffled relative to the number of replies they received. From Table 6 and
Fig 9 we can see that attention continues to focus on Boris Johnson, and is even
less abusive than previously, largely due to a surge in non-abusive attention in
conjunction with his being diagnosed with COVID-19. Matt Hancock becomes more
prominent, though attracting less abuse than previously.

March 22nd - 31st 2020 inclusive.

Figure 10 Top 100 hashtags in all replies sent to MPs - March 23rd - 31st 2020 inclusive.

Hashtags
The rise of the hashtag “#stayhomesavelives” shows a shift toward comment on the
practical details (see Fig 10). Support for the lockdown appears to be high at this
stage. Table 7 gives counts for the top ten.
Examples of tweets that attracted particularly abusive responses
By volume, the most abused tweet was Boris Johnson’s illness announcement, but as
a percentage this was remarkably un-abusive, as discussed above, with 2.3% abuse,
and the abuse count follows only from the very high level of attention this tweet
drew. The most striking tweet in terms of receiving a high percentage of abuse as
well as a notable degree of attention was the one below from Richard Burgon.
https://twitter.com/RichardBurgon/status/1244043022297370626 (17% abuse,
or 6% of all abuse sent to MPs in March post-lockdown):
This is a Trump-style attempt to divert blame from the UK government’s
failures.

ambitious, agile & aggressive disease containment effort in history”

We haven’t even sorted out enough tests for NHS staff
April 1st to 16th
This section reviews April 1 up to and including April 16th 2020, before Trump
issued his liberation tweets to Virginia, Michigan and Minnesota and a backlash
against lockdown measures became apparent.
As indicated by the table and the histogram depicted in Table 8 and Fig 11
respectively, Boris Johnson’s abuse level is extremely low as his illness takes a serious
turn. Keir Starmer begins to attract attention in his new role as Labour leader, and
the attention is much less abusive than Jeremy Corbyn tended to receive in the
same role (10% in the first half of 2019,[10] but the tables shown here also show
consistently high abuse levels for Mr Corbyn). Jeremy Corbyn begins to attract
less attention by volume of replies on Twitter compared to others. Nadine Dorries
attracts a higher abuse level than Matthew Hancock and Rishi Sunak for a tweet
given below.
The high abuse level toward Jack Lopresti during this period relates to his controversial opinion that churches should open for Easter. Example tweets are given
below.
Hashtags
The hashtag cloud in Fig 12 shows that attention has begun to focus on the
economic cost of the lockdown, as illustrated by the prominence of hashtags such
as #newstarterfurlough and #wearethetaxpayers. Table 9 gives counts for the top
ten.

Table 10 MPs with greatest number of replies from from April 17 - May 9 2020 inclusive. Cell colours
indicate party membership; blue for Conservative, red for Labour, yellow for Liberal Democrat.

https://twitter.com/NadineDorries/status/1248329497897775105 (11% abuse,
5% of all abuse sent to MPs between April 1st and 16th inclusive - given that many
people were dying, of a respiratory virus, it seemed tactless)
The boss is in a better place. Such a relief. The country can breathe again
https://twitter.com/RichardBurgon/status/1247248198932062208 (17% abuse,
2% of all abuse sent to MPs between April 1st and 16th inclusive - regarding his
work as shadow justice secretary, regarded by some as mistimed considering the
prime minister’s health at the time).
April 17th to May 9th
The histogram and table in Fig 13 and Table 10 respectively reflect the unusual
circumstances of this period. Boris Johnson did not return to work until April 26th,
so the greater prominence of Matt Hancock on Twitter during this period, while the
prime minister recuperated at Chequers, perhaps reflects this. Dominic Raab, in his
role as acting prime minister, did not attract high attention levels on Twitter. Keir
Starmer is now the most replied-to Labour politician on Twitter, but continues to
attract low abuse levels.
Hashtags
Later in the month, the economic focus continues, as shown by the hashtag cloud
in Fig 14. The majority of hashtags now appear to be critical, often economically
focused but also including accusations of lying against China, Boris Johnson and
Conservatives, and references to the shortage of personal protective equipment for

Examples of tweets that attracted particularly abusive responses
The tweet receiving the most abusive response by volume also received a striking
level of abuse by percentage; this one by Ed Davey.

Non-MP accounts
From this time period, we began also to collect data for a set of government accounts and other accounts relevant to the epidemic. In this period, as shown in
Table 12 and Fig 15, Neil Ferguson, a medical expert formerly included in the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), who advise the UK government,
received more attention than he goes on to receive in the following period, and a
high level of abuse. Mr Ferguson resigned from SAGE during this period, following publicity surrounding his lockdown violation. Note that Neil Ferguson was also
targeted by conspiracy theorists.[12] Chief medical officer of England Chris Whitty
(“CMO England”) and chief scientific advisor Patrick Vallance (“uksciencechief”)
both appear in the table, but receive only a fraction of the total and Covid-related
attention that 10 Downing Street receives.
May 10th to 25th
In Table 13 and Fig 16 we see a return to a high level of focus on Boris Johnson,
with other senior ministers also prominent. Of Labour politicians, only Keir Starmer
attracts notable attention, with others much further down the list. Higher levels

Matthew Hancock, Oliver Dowden and Michael Gove. Boris Johnson also receives
more abuse than he did in the previous period. Example tweets are given below of
ministers defending Mr Cummings.

Hashtags
Hashtags in Fig 17 show a high degree of negative attention focused on Dominic
Cummings, whilst continued attention on the economic plight of new starters is also
in evidence. Table 14 gives counts for the top ten.

Examples of tweets that attracted particularly abusive responses
The four tweets to attract the highest volumes of abuse were all by cabinet members
defending Dominic Cummings. Abuse levels are high but not the highest we have
seen. There was clearly a high level of attention on the issue however.
https://twitter.com/MattHancock/status/1264162359733555202 (7% abuse,
7% of abuse for the period):
I know how ill coronavirus makes you. It was entirely right for Dom Cummings
to find childcare for his toddler, when both he and his wife were getting ill.
https://twitter.com/OliverDowden/status/1264221876374646786 (8% abuse,
5% of abuse for the period):
Dom Cummings followed the guidelines and looked after his family. End of
story.

Caring for your wife and child is not a crime

https://twitter.com/MattHancock/status/1264975804208947208 (9% abuse,
4% of abuse for the period):
Dom Cummings was right today to set out in full detail how he made his
decisions in very difficult circumstances. Now we must move on, fight this
dreadful disease and get our country back on her feet
As a percentage of replies, the most notable tweet was the following:
https://twitter.com/HenrySmithUK/status/1263394101002674176 (13% abuse,
2% of abuse for the period):
Not that I should be surprised by the lazy left but interesting how workshy socialist and nationalist MPs tried to keep the remote Parliament going
beyond 2 June.
Non-MP accounts
Dominic Cummings does not have a clearly labelled and verified Twitter account,
though the account “OdysseanProject”, rumoured to be his, does show elevated
attention in this period, and some abuse, though not sufficient to appear in the top
15 non-MP accounts shown in Fig 18 and Table 15. It is unlikely that many Twitter
users are aware of this anonymous account (and indeed, our information may be
incorrect!) However the extent of the controversy around Mr Cummings’ lockdown
violation shows itself better in responses to MPs defending his actions, and in the
use of hashtags, as shown above.
Conspiracy theories
This report[13] from Moonshot CVE was used as a guide to the overall conspiracy landscape within COVID-19. The areas they highlight are anti-Chinese feeling/conspiracy theory, theories that link the virus to a Jewish plot, theories that
link the virus to an American plot, generic “deep state” and 5g-based theories and
general theories that the virus is a plot or hoax. Further search areas were then
added as controls. The three controls appear at the bottom of Table 16; “#endthelockdown” and close variants, “#newstarterfurlough” and variants, and “#stayhomesavelives”, in order to contrast volumes with anti-lockdown feeling, the leading
economy-related campaign and pro-lockdown feeling respectively.

Figure 18 Covid-related replies to other accounts as a portion of all replies received, May 10th 25th inclusive.

The table shows substantial evidence of ill-feeling toward China. Classic conspiracy theories are in evidence but numbers of mentions are low (though note that most
of the 183 mentions of “NWO” (“new world order”) are now COVID-19-related, suggesting opportunistic incorporation of COVID-19 into existing mythologies). There
is considerable evidence of some Twitter users not believing in the virus, and that
numbers of mentions to this effect are within one order of magnitude of the popular
“stay home save lives”. Yet all are surpassed by the theme of economic support for
those not in established employment.

Conclusion
The crisis has led to elevated engagement with UK politicians by the public, and
we have seen that this may be more positive and less abusive than the dialogue at
other times. The leading hashtag campaign of the period, “#newstarterfurlough”,
is associated with a remarkably low level of abuse (<0.5% of replies) despite being
a complaint hashtag. The surge of attention on Boris Johnson during his illness
was substantially lower in abuse than his previous levels. Receiving more tweets
mentioning the virus is associated with receiving lower levels of abuse. It may be
that the crisis is leading to different people engaging with politicians than usually
do, who are less inclined to verbally abuse them than those that usually occupy the
space.
Yet the usual, more uncivil contingent remains active on Twitter, with politicians
receiving abuse for particular topics, that may or may not be COVID-19-related,
in much the same manner as they did before. Tweets from MPs expressing positive
engagement with the Muslim community have been met with hostile and abusive
responses, and hashtags associating the virus with China have an elevated likelihood
of abuse, continuing an already noted pattern [9, 10] that racism and xenophobia
are associated with particularly abusive tweets. Previous work has also described a
substantial presence of overt Islamophobia in dialogue with MPs [10]. Xenophobia
has not gone away, and indeed has found new fuel in the crisis.
In terms of responses to the handling of the crisis, feelings run high on both sides.
Elevated levels of abuse are associated with hashtags supporting lockdown as well
as those opposing it. Labour politicians in favour of stricter measures have received

abusive responses, as have Conservative politicians defending Dominic Cummings’
lockdown violation. New Labour leader Keir Starmer receives less abuse than his
predecessor Jeremy Corbyn.
1,902 replies to MPs were found containing hashtags or terms that refute the existence of the virus (e.g. #coronahoax, #coronabollocks, 0.04% of a total 4.7 million
replies, or 9% of the number of mentions of ”stay home save lives” and variants).
Evidence of some members of the public believing in COVID-19 conspiracy theories
was also found. The high prevalence of disbelieving the existence of the virus is a
cause for concern.
