Abstract
Pyroptosis is an inflammatory mode of cell death that can contribute to the cytokine storm associated
with severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome
is central to pyroptosis, which may be induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2). Inflammasome formation, and by extension pyroptosis, may be inhibited by certain
anti-inflammatory drugs. In this study, we present a single-cell mathematical model that captures the
formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, pyroptotic cell death and responses to anti-inflammatory intervention that hinder the formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The model is formulated in terms of a
system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that describe the dynamics of the biological components
involved in pyroptosis. Our results demonstrate that an anti-inflammatory drug can delay the formation
of the NLRP3 inflammasome, and thus may alter the mode of cell death from inflammatory (pyroptosis)
to non-inflammatory (e.g., apoptosis). The single-cell model is being implemented in a SARS-CoV-2
Tissue Simulator, in collaboration with a multidisciplinary coalition investigating within host-dynamics
of COVID-19. In this paper, we provide an overview of the SARS-CoV-2 Tissue Simulator and highlight
the effects of pyroptosis on a cellular level.

Introduction
SARS-CoV-2 induced pyroptosis and cytokine storms

COVID-19 is a respiratory illness induced by the coronavirus strain SARS-CoV-2 [1]. Most people infected
by the virus experience mild symptoms, however, in severe cases of the disease, life-threatening symptoms
can manifest [2]. These divergent disease trajectories have been, largely, attributed to differences in the
immune response of infected hosts [3]. When cells register the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virions, a multitude
of host-protective responses are triggered. Infected cells transmit signals that recruit immune cells, such as
monocytes, macrophages and T-cells, to the site of infection. These immune cells act to eliminate the virus
from the body, and thus they attack infected cells in which virions may replicate. Current research has shown
that, upon active virion replication and release, SARS-CoV-2 can induce pyroptosis in both epithelial cells
and immune cells [3–9]. Pyroptosis is an inflammatory and rapid mode of cell death that is characterised by
the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, cell swelling and, ultimately, membrane rupture resulting in the
release of cytoplasmic contents into the extracellular environment [10, 11]. Furthermore, interleukin-1β (IL1β), a cytokine released by pyroptosing cells, has been shown to induce pyroptosis in neighbouring bystander
cells [12]. Fundamentally, both the recruitment of immune cells and pyroptotic cell death act to protect the
host from the virus. Indeed, in hosts with healthy immune systems, virus-specific T-cells are recruited to
the site of infection [3], and cytokine levels are kept under control by negative feedback regulations [13].
However, if the immune system contesting a viral infection is malfunctioning, a wide array of cytokines
may be over-produced due to deregulation of the negative feedback that controls cytokine levels in healthy
immune systems [13]. Such an over-compensating immune response may lead to uncontrolled cytokine
activity, commonly referred to as a cytokine storm [3]. Elevated levels of both pro-inflammatory and antiinflammatory cytokines have been observed in severe cases of COVID-19 [2, 9, 13, 14], commonly manifesting

with severe symptoms such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which may
lead to multiple organ failure [13]. Hence, cytokine storms are associated with poor clinical COVID-19
outcomes [2, 4, 6]. Therefore, suppressing the onset of cytokine storms and the subsequent inflammation,
without completely cancelling-out host-protective effects of the immune system, is one of the suggested
treatment strategies being explored to combat COVID-19 [13]. One approach to suppress cytokine storms is
to inhibit pyroptosis whilst leaving other functionalities of the immune system untouched. In fact, there exists
a number of anti-inflammatory drugs that may inhibit pyroptosis and, through the inhibition of pyroptosis,
alter the mode of cell death from inflammatory to non-inflammatory [15]. Non-inflammatory modes of cell
death includes apoptosis, which is characterised by cell shrinkage with cell membrane integrity maintained
throughout cell death, whereas pyroptosis is characterised by cell swelling and membrane rupture [16, 17].
Inhibiting pyroptosis may provide two key clinical advantages. Firstly, this inhibition could suppress the
cytokine storm, and the resulting increased inflammation and tissue damage that it brings. Secondly, it has
been shown that tissue factors released upon pyroptosis may initiate blood coagulation cascades, therefore
inhibiting pyroptosis may reduce the risk of blood clotting in COVID-19 cases [2].

1.2

The pathway to pyroptosis

In this subsection we describe key aspects of the intracellular pathway that leads to pyroptosis. For a more
comprehensive description of the mechanisms driving pyroptosis, we refer the interested reader to detailed
reviews [15, 18–21]. Using the details from a well-established biological pathway of pyroptosis, we formulate
a mathematical model described in Section 2, the components of the model are illustrated in Figure 1.

Figure 1. A schematic representation of the pathway to pyroptosis, as considered in our mathematical
model. Black arrows represent reactions that involve mass transfer between depicted compounds. Blue
arrows represent facilitation of compound formation or reactions. Red arrows represent signals that can be
turned on or off in the model. Membrane pores (shown in red) induced by GSDMD-N allows for the
outflux of inflammatory cytokines and the influx of extracellular water, causing the cell to swell and the
cell membrane to eventually rupture. Abbreviations are listed in Appendix A.

Central to pyroptosis is the formation of the inflammasome, a multi-protein complex consisting of three
molecular units (a sensor, an adaptor and an executor) that together enable the release of cytokines and
the ultimate membrane rupture that characterise pyroptosis. This inflammasome is named after its sensor
molecule NLRP3, i.e., nucleotide-binding and oligomerisation domain (NBD) leucine-rich repeat (LRR)containing receptors with an N-terminal pyrin domain (PYD) 3. Thus in this study we focus our attention
on the inflammasome comprising the sensor molecule NLRP3, the adaptor molecule apoptosis-associated
speck-like protein (ASC), and the executor molecule caspase-1. Note that, only one inflammasome is formed
per cell [19].

Homeostatic cells do not contain enough NLRP3 to produce an inflammasome base [20], instead, NLRP3
levels are elevated in cells when toll like receptors (TLRs) on the cell surface sense DAMPs or pathogen
associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). As SARS-CoV-2 is a positive sense RNA virus, it can indeed be
detected by TLRs and induce NLRP3 inflammasome formation [2, 6, 7]. Upon TLRs detecting DAMPs
or PAMPs, the transcription factor NF-κB is translocated to the nucleus, initiating the transcription and,
by extension, the synthesis of (inactive) NLRP3. The transcription and synthesis of the pro-inflammatory
cytokine pro-interleukin-1β (pro-IL-1β) is also regulated by NF-κB. The transcription-mediated elevation of
(inactive) NLRP3 and pro-IL-1β is often referred to as the priming step of pyroptosis, which is succeeded
by the activation step [19].
Inactive NLRP3 can become activated upon stimuli from a wide array intracellular events, including altered
calcium signalling, potassium efflux and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [15]. In turn, active
NLRP3 molecules can oligomerise and bind together to form a wheel shaped structure, constituting the
inflammasome base as depicted in Figure 2(a). Through homotypic binding, ASC molecules can then bind
to the NLRP3 inflammasome base as depicted in Figure 2(b). Thereafter, pro-caspase-1 can bind to ASC,
enabling the proximity-induced dimerisation, and thereby the activation, of caspase-1 [22]. Active caspase-1
then acts to cleave the pro-interleukins, pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18, into their respective mature forms, IL1β and IL-18. Caspase-1 also cleaves the protein gasdermin D (GSDMD), releasing the active N-terminal
domain of gasdermin D (GSDMD-N) which can form pores on the cell membrane. These pores enable the
outflux of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 (in their mature forms) from the cytoplasm to the
external environment [23, 24]. The released cytokines can recruit immune cells to the site of infection and
initiate pyroptosis in neighbouring cells. Furthermore, the GDSMD-N derived membrane pores also allow
for the influx of extracellular material, e.g., water, into the cell. This influx causes cells to swell until their
plasma membrane eventually ruptures, releasing cellular material into the extracellular region.
Data suggests that ASC, pro-caspase-1, GSDMD and pro-IL-18 are present in adequate levels for NLRP3
formation and pyroptosis at homeostasis, and thus these proteins are not upregulated by the TLR-stimulated
cytoplasm-to-nucleus translocation of NF-κB [18, 25]. Furthermore, once the NLRP3 inflammasome is activated, cell lysis can be delayed but not prevented [26, 27]. However, if the formation of the NLRP3
inflammasome is inhibited, a series of intracellular events resulting in non-inflammatory cell death may
instead be initiated. There exists multiple drugs that act to inhibit inflammasome formation in order to
prevent pyroptosis, a rigorous list of covalent drugs that target the NLRP3 inflammasome can be found
in a review by Bertinara et al. [15]. In this study, we include the pharmacodynamical effects of a generic
anti-inflammatory drug which inhibits the formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by covalently binding to
NLRP3 molecules to prevent NLRP3-NLRP3 interactions, as shown in Figure 2(a).

1.3

Mathematical modelling of pyroptosis

The use of mathematical models to describe apoptotic cell death has been well established and reviewed [28,
29]. However, there are significantly fewer mathematical models that describe pyroptotic cell death. Previous
modelling works include more implicit descriptions of pyroptosis [30] and descriptions of specific aspects of
inflammasome formation [31–33]. Within this work, we explicitly model the intracellular events that drive
SARS-CoV-2 induced pyroptosis, from TLRs detecting DAMPs/PAMPs through to the ultimate membrane
rupture. We study this system in the absence, or presence, of an anti-inflammatory drug. The goal of
our model is to capture key aspects of the pyroptosis pathway that are commonly analysed in experimental
studies. Thus, in this mathematical/computational work, we study the time evolution of NF-κB, the NLRP3
inflammasome and its components, the pore-forming protein GSDMD, the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β
and IL-18, and cell volume.

Mathematical modelling of within host-dynamics of COVID-19

Many researchers have turned their attention to the mathematical modelling of COVID-19 since the virus
was announced as a global pandemic [34]. These models are split into two main categories, which are,
external dynamics, (e.g., models of the spread of COVID-19 from person to person), and modelling of the
within-host dynamics of COVID-19. We shall focus on the latter, where the spread of the virus is described

pyrin domain (PYD) of ASC molecules can bind to the PYD of NLRP3 molecules in the inflammasome

CARD of NLRP3-bound ASC molecules. This results in the dimerisation and activation of caspase-1.

within the body. Agent-based models (ABMs) have been widely utilised in the past to model withinhost viral dynamics [35–38], with focuses on influenza modelling [39–43], oncolytic virotherapy [44, 45] and
inflammation [46, 47]. Several groups are utilising multiscale ABMs to describe these within-host dynamics
of SARS-CoV-2 [48–50]. These modelling approaches aim to describe how the virus spreads within the
body and circumvents the human immune system. Our model of single-cell inflammatory cell death is
being incorporated within a multiscale SARS-CoV-2 tissue simulator set up as part of an international,
multidisciplinary coalition. For the full details of this agent-based model, we refer the reader to the preprint
for the project [50]. Here, we will focus on the role of pyroptosis in the tissue simulator, as described in
Section 3.

Mathematical model of pyroptosis in a single-cell

We formulate a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describing the dynamics of the key components of NLRP3 inflammasome formation and pyroptosis. Specifically, the model includes the dynamics of
NF-κB (Section 2.1), NLRP3 (Section 2.2), ASC (Section 2.3), caspase-1 (Section 2.4), GSDMD (Section 2.5),
IL-1β and IL-18 (Section 2.6). We also consider changes in cell volume over time (Section 2.7). Figure 1
provides a pictorial overview of the modelled pathway, while variable names are listed in Table B.1 and,
throughout this work, the bracket notation [ ] denotes compound concentration. Further details concerning
modelling choices and parameterisation can be found in Appendices B and C, respectively. In Section 2.8, we
expand the model to include the pharmacodynamic effects of an anti-inflammatory drug targeting NLRP3.
We discuss the results of numerical simulations of the model in Section 2.10, and further investigate the
model using sensitivity analysis in Section 2.11.

2.1

NF-κ B dynamics

When TLRs register DAMPs or PAMPs, cytoplasmic NF-κB is translocated to the nucleus in order to initiate
the transcription of inactive NLRP3 and pro-IL-1β. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, for example, these DAMPs
and PAMPs can be induced by intracellular virion replication and release, or by cytokines from neighbouring,
infected cells. Dynamics of NF-κB translocation between the cytoplasm and the nucleus varies between
situations and strongly depends on cell type or external stimuli [51]. In recent work, Bagaev et al. [51]
studied TLR-4 derived activation of NF-κB in bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) subjected to
bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The authors found a sharp peak in NF-κB nuclear translocation kinetics
10 minutes post LPS activation, after which the nuclear NF-κB signalling gradually decreased until plateau.
As BMDMs stimulated with LPS have been shown to undergo pyroptosis [52, 53], we here aim to capture
these rapid, mono-peaking and right-skewed nuclear NF-κB dynamics. In our model we therefore assume that
the signal S1 initiates a rapid cytoplasm-to-nucleus translocation of NF-κB, and that the nuclear occupancy
of NF-κB over time follows a log-normal probability distribution function. Thus, when S1 is activated, the
concentration of nuclear NF-κB, [NF-κBn ], can be estimated using
[NFκBn ](t̄) = C ·

τ − log2 t̄

By differentiation, with respect to time, of Equation (2), the amount of nuclear NF-κB ([NF-κBn ]) over time

The parameters τ , s and ν can be varied to adjust the height, width and skewness of the NF-κB peak.

2.2

NLRP3 dynamics

Following nuclear NF-κB translocation, inactive NLRP3, NLRP3i , is transcribed and subsequently synthesised. As the transcription and synthesis of inactive NLRP3 is promoted by nuclear NF-κB, we describe the
production rate of NLRP3 using a Hill function. Specifically, a Hill function [54] with a constant coefficient
rate α1 , Hill coefficient γNF and half-max concentration-value NF50 . Inactive NLRP3 can become activated
in response to a secondary signal, S2 , which can be turned on by multiple stimuli such as potassium influx, calcium outflux and abnormal reactive oxygen species (ROS). Once activated, NLRP3a molecules can
oligomerise (bind together) to form a wheel-shaped inflammasome base, modelled by the concentration of
oligomerised NLRP3, i.e., NLRP3o . In the model, we thus consider NLRP3 protein concentrations in three
different forms: [NLRP3i ], [NLRP3a ] and [NLRP3o ]. Inactive and active NLRP3 decays in the model at a
rate δ1 . Note, we do not consider the decay of NLRP3o as we assume the inflammasome will remain formed
until pyroptosis has completed. The forward reactions from the inactive-to-active, and active-to-oligomerised
NLRP3 forms are here assumed to be irreversible, and are respectively described using the rates k2 and k3 .
We now incorporate all the above mechanisms to describe the rate of change of [NLRP3i ], [NLRP3a ] and
[NLRP3o ] over time as,
d[NLRP3i ]
dt
d[NLRP3a ]

ASC dynamics

Once the inflammasome base is formed, free ASC in the cell can bind to the NLRP3 inflammasome base.
Thus in the model, we consider the concentrations of ASC in free and bound form, denoted [ASCf ] and
[ASCb ], respectively. The inflammasome-forming binding is here considered to be irreversible and occurs at
a rate k4 , hence the rate of change of [ASCf ] and [ASCb ] are here described by
d[ASCf ]

d[ASCb ]
dt

(10)

= k4 F ([NLRP3o ]) [NLRP3o ] [ASCf ],

(11)

6/37

where the function F ([NLRP3o ]) is included in order to model the absence or presence of the NLRP3
inflammasome base. In order to allow for more mathematical analyses, we approximate this two-state
system as a continuous sigmoid function [55] such that
1

F ([NLRP3o ]) =
1+

[NLRP3o ]+a

(12)

where values a = 1 (a.u.) and b = 2 (a.u.) can be used to obtain F ([NLRP3o ]) ≈ 0 for [NLRP3o ] < 1 and
F ([NLRP3o ]) ≈ 1 otherwise. The value of c is set to be large (e.g., 1000) in order to create a steep curve
in the sigmoid. Note that, free ASC levels are adequate for pyroptosis at homeostasis [15, 18], and thus the
total amount of ASC is conserved in our model,
[ASCf ] + [ASCb ] = constant.

2.4

(13)

Caspase-1 dynamics

Pro-caspase-1 can bind to inflammasome-bound ASC upon availability and subsequently dimerise into its
activated, mature form, caspase-1. In our model, concentrations of pro-caspase-1 and caspase-1 are denoted
by [pro-C1] and [C1], respectively. Caspase-1 activation occurs at a rate k5 and is here assumed to be
irreversible so that the rate of change of [pro-C1] and [C1] can be described by
d[pro-C1]
dt
d[C1]
dt

= −k5 [ASCb ] [pro-C1],

(14)

= k5 [ASCb ] [pro-C1].

(15)

Pro-caspase-1 is present in adequate levels in the cell prior to cellular responses to DAMPs or PAMPs [15,18],
therefore the total amount of caspase-1, in both pro- and active form, is conserved over time so that
[pro-C1] + [C1] = constant.

2.5

(16)

Gasdermin dynamics

GSDMD-N, which is formed as a result of caspase-1 cleavage of GSDMD, produces pores on the cell membrane
that are central to the pyroptosis process. In the model, we consider the concentrations of both GSDMD
and GSDMD-N, denoted as [GSDMD] and [GSDMD-N], respectively. We describe the caspase-1 facilitated
cleavage using a Hill function, where γC1 is the Hill coefficient, and C150 is the half-max [C1] value. We
additionally assume a specific rate for [GSDMD] cleavage, α2 . Therefore, we describe the rate of change of
[GSDMD] and [GSDMD-N] in the model, through the equations,
d[GSDMD]

d[GSDMD-N]

(17)
(18)

Adequate levels of GSDMD required for pyroptosis are available in the cell at homeostasis [25], therefore we
include a conservation law,
[GSDMD] + [GSDMD-N] = constant.

Cytokine dynamics

Translocation of NF-κB, from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, induces the transcription and synthesis of proIL-1β. Pro-IL-18, on the other hand, is present in adequate levels within the cell, therefore we not consider
synthesis. When active caspase-1 is available, the pro-forms of the interleukins can be cleaved into their
activated forms. Subsequently, once membrane pores have been formed in response to GSDMD-N activity,
cytoplasmic interleukins may be secreted into the extracellular region. We here consider the concentrations
of IL-1β/18 in pro-, cytoplasmic and extracellular form, respectively denoted [pro-IL-1β/18], [IL-1β c /18c ]
and [IL-1β e /18e ]. In the model, pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 are cleaved by caspase-1 at rates α4 and α5 ,
respectively. Once cleaved, cellular IL-1β c and IL-18c are secreted through the GSDMD-N derived pores at
the rates k6 and k7 , respectively.
IL-1β: The transcription and synthesis of pro-IL-1β is promoted by [NF-κBn ], in a similar way to NLRP3,
therefore we describe this process using a Hill function with constant coefficient α3 , Hill coefficient γNF and
the half-max concentration of NF-κB, NF50 . We additionally consider the decay of IL-1β at the rate δ2 . We
incorporate the above mechanisms to describe the rate of change of [pro-IL-1β], [IL-1β c ] and [IL-1β e ] over
time as,

(26)

The levels of pro-IL-18 in the cell are kept at a homeostatic level [15,18], therefore we include a conservation
law,
[pro-IL-18] + [IL-18c ] + [IL-18e ] = constant.
(27)

2.7

Cell volume

The GSDMD-N derived membrane pores that allow for the outflux of mature interleukins, also allow for the
influx of extracellular material (e.g., water). This influx causes the cell to swell until it eventually ruptures.

December 4, 2020

8/37

Single-cell analysis has revealed that before the ultimate membrane rupture occurs, the cell volume increases
gradually [56]. Thus, in the model, we consider the volume of the cell, V , to increase at a rate k8 once pores
are formed on the cell membrane. We describe the rate of change of the cell volume by the equation,
dV
dt

= k8 G V.

(28)

Once the cell volume reaches a critical volume Vc , the cell ruptures and all cell processes cease.

2.8

Modified drug targeting model

We consider an anti-inflammatory drug (Drug) which binds to active NLRP3 and thus inhibits the inflammasome formation by preventing NLRP3-NLRP3 interactions. To incorporate this in our model, we consider
the drug binding to NLRP3a to form the complex Drug · NLRP3a . The forward and reverse rate constants
for this reaction are denoted by k+D and k−D , respectively. If we include these drug mechanisms in our
model, Equation (6) describing the dynamics of NLRP3a must be modified to include two additional terms,
d[NLRP3a ]
= . . . − k+D [Drug] [NLRP3a ] + k−D [Drug · NLRP3a ].
dt

(29)

The rate of change of [Drug] and [Drug · NLRP3a ] can now be included in the model as,
d[Drug]
dt
d[Drug · NLRP3a ]
dt

= −k+D [Drug] [NLRP3a ] + k−D [Drug · NLRP3a ],

(30)

= k+D [Drug] [NLRP3a ] − k−D [Drug · NLRP3a ],

(31)

where the following conservation law holds,
[Drug]+[Drug · NLRP3a ] = constant.

2.9

(32)

Implementation of the pathway model

The model is implemented in MATLAB [57], where the system of ODEs (3)-(32) is solved numerically using
the built-in ODE-solver ode15s. Model outputs are measured in terms of arbitrary units of concentration
over time, or in units of volume over time. A more detailed description of the numerical set-up can be found
in Appendix D, which also includes instructions on how to access and run the code. Simulation results are
provided and discussed in the next section.

2.10

Results and discussion of the pathway model

We first consider the model without any drug, that is, we simulate the system given by Equations (3)(28). Simulation results are provided in Figure 3, in which compound concentrations (in arbitrary units)
and cell volume are plotted over time. We note that, [ASCf ], [pro-C1], [GSDMD] and [pro-IL-18] levels
are not shown, however these concentrations can be directly obtained using the conservation laws detailed
previously. The results show that NF-κB is rapidly translocated to the nucleus upon DAMP/PAMP-induced
TLR signalling. After [NF-κBn ] levels have peaked, the transcription, and by extension the synthesis, of
NLRP3i and pro-IL-1β is reduced as NF-κB leaves the nucleus. Synthesised NLRP3i activates to become
NLRP3a , which in turn oligomerises and binds together to form the inflammasome base, here expressed in
terms of the concentration of NLRP3o . These dynamics are captured in the subplot displaying the time
evolution of [NLRP3i ], [NLRP3a ] and [NLRP3o ]. Note that once the inflammasome base is formed, the
NLRP3a -to-NLRP3o oligomerisation plateaus and the binding of ASC to the inflammasome increases. This
can be observed in the results, as [ASCb ] levels increase when [NLRP3o ] reaches the value n, where here
n ≈ 1. Furthermore, as [ASCb ] levels increase, the dimerisation and activation of caspase-1 is facilitated so

that [C1] levels increase. In turn, when [C1] levels increase, the cleavage of GSDMD, pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18
occurs. This is apparent in the subplots, as [GSDMD-N], [IL-1β c ] and [IL-18c ] levels start increasing once
[C1] levels surpass zero. The outflux of mature interleukins and the influx of extracellular water to the cell
is mediated by GSDMD-N derived pores, here implicitly modelled via the concentration [GSDMD-N] using
Equation (23). Thus, once GSDMD-N has been cleaved, so that [GSDMD-N]>0, the cytoplasmic interleukin
concentrations [IL-1β c ] and [IL-18c ] respectively decrease in favour of the extracellular concentrations [IL1β e ] and [IL-18e ]. [GSDMD-N] levels over zero also enable the cellular volume to increase which eventually
results in membrane rupture once the volume reaches the maximal capacity Vc , where here Vc = 1.5. Note
that when membrane rupture occurs, all intracellular mechanisms are ceased and thus the time progression
in the subplots stops.

Figure 3. Numerical simulations results of the ODE model described by Equations (3)-(28) - that is, the
model of pyroptosis in the absence of an anti-inflammatory drug. We display the concentration of each
model component in arbitrary units (a.u) over time,as well as cell volume dynamics. Note that the time
progression stops once the critical volume Vc is reached and the ultimate cell membrane rupture occurs.

We next consider numerical simulations of the model including the effects of an anti-inflammatory drug, that
is the system given by Equations (3)-(28), with the modifications and additions described in Equations (29)(31). The results of the numerical simulations are displayed in Figure 4, where we compare different initial
concentrations (dosages) of the drug. We display the time evolution of each model component in a separate
subplot, where the graph colour corresponds to drug dosage. These results show that increasing levels of the
drug push pyroptotic events further in time. Note that the results for the maximal tested drug dosage results
in many of the processes driving pyroptosis not occurring in the time frame examined. The drug specifically
inhibits the NLRP3a -to-NLRP3o oligomerisation process. Therefore, when it is added to the system, we
observe that as the drug concentration [Drug] increases, so does the amount of time it takes for [NLRP3o ]
to reach the threshold value n. This means that the inflammasome base formation, and by extension the
downstream processes resulting in inflammatory cytokine secretion and the ultimate membrane rupture, are
delayed.

Sensitivity analyses of the pathway model

The mathematical model of the pyroptosis pathway includes a set of model parameters Θ ={θ1 , θ2 ,...,θp },
which are listed in Table C.1 in Appendix C. As is further described in this Appendix, these model parameters
have been collectively approximated through data fitting to time-course data available in the literature. We
note that such a data fitting approach may lead to large parameter uncertainties and thus we conduct
sensitivity analyses in order to investigate how sensitive the model output is to changes in the values of the
model parameters Θ, hereby referred to as the model input. Such analyses can help us understand how
changes in the model input can affect the model output [58, 59]. Therefore, this can allow us to identify
which input parameters θj are the most influential, providing information on the importance of experimental
retrieval of accurate parameters and possible model reductions. In this study we investigate the system
of ODEs describing the pyroptosis pathway (Equations (3)-(28)), using three different sensitivity analysis
techniques, namely robustness analysis (Section 2.11.1), Latin hypercube analysis (Section 2.11.2) and a
derivative-based method (Section 2.11.3). The system of ODEs is summarised in System (33) in Appendix B,
and we denote the computed compound concentrations over time as model outputs yi (t), where i = 1, ..., q,
as labelled in Table B.1.
2.11.1

Robustness analyses

Robustness analysis is a local sensitivity analysis technique in which one input parameter θj is varied, whilst
the other p − 1 parameters are kept fixed at their estimated value [58,59]. We compare the output compound
concentrations yi (t) over time for, here 15, different perturbed values of each parameter θj . For brevity,
in this section we include robustness analysis results for two input parameters, α1 and α2 , respectively
denoting the rate coefficients for the transcription of inactive NLRP3 and the cleavage of GSDMD, in
Figure 5. Further robustness analysis results for all input parameters θj , j = 1, ..., 21 are available in the
Supporting Information (Supporting Information, S1). Figure 5 (top) shows that increasing α1 speeds up
the inflammasome base formation and, thereby, the pyroptosis process. For investigated values of α1 below
the threshold value α1 = 0.06 (a.u) min−1 , the pyroptosis process is delayed to an extent that NLRP3
formation does not occur within the simulated 300 minutes. For the estimated values of the parameter set
Θ, we consider such perturbations of α1 to be unfeasible, since we are here aiming to simulate a scenario in
which the NLRP3 inflammasome base is formed at around 77 minutes, and the ultimate membrane rupture
occurs at 120 minutes, as is described in Appendix C. Figure 5 (bottom) shows that as α2 increases, so does
the concentration of GSDMD-N post-inflammasome formation, and thereby the ultimate membrane rupture
gets pushed earlier in time. These results provide a visual overview of how increasing or decreasing each
model parameter affects the output. Note that, apart from the NF-κB translocation dynamics, all reactions
in the model are irreversible, one-way reactions, as can be seen in Figure 1. This means that varying input
parameters associated with NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, GSDMD and cell volume dynamics will either speed up
or slow down the pyroptosis process. Furthermore, varying parameters associated with the cytokines IL-1β
and IL-18 affects cytokine dynamics only.
2.11.2

Global sensitivity analysis

We perform a global sensitivity analysis, in which all parameters θj are simultaneously perturbed from their
estimated values, using Latin hypercube sampling and analysis [58, 59]. Results from the Latin hypercube
analysis are provided in the form of scatter plots, where the model outputs are plotted over chosen parameter
ranges for each input parameter. Here the regarded output is the time-points for the ultimate membrane
rupture. The scatter plots in Figure 6 provides a visual means to study the relationship between the input
parameters and model outputs, for small perturbations (between ± 5%) of each input parameter θj . In
order to quantify linear input-output associations, Figure 6 also includes Pearson correlation coefficients
(R) for each input-output pair, evaluated over the regarded input parameter ranges [59]. A moderate
negative linear input-output correlations (R=-0.595) is found for input parameter τ , implying that, given
the estimated parameter values of Θ, our model results are especially sensitive to small perturbations of τ
which influences the magnitude and duration of the nuclear NF-κB peak. Weak positive linear input-output
correlations are found for input parameters NF50 (R=0.382) and ν (R=0.261), also related to nuclear NF-κB

are thus omitted from this global sensitivity analysis.

Each input parameter range spans ±5% of the estimated parameter value. The Pearson correlation
coefficient (R), measuring the linear association between each input-output pair, is provided at the top
right corner of each corresponding subplot.

2.11.3

Derivative-based sensitivity analysis

We perform a derivative-based sensitivity analysis in which the equations describing the time evolution of
the concentrations yi (t), where i = 1, ..., q, are differentiated with respect to each input parameter θj where
j = 1, ..., p [58, 60]. We thus compute q × p partial derivatives zji (t) = ∂yi (t)/∂θj , at each time-point t in
which the system of ODEs is numerically solved. These partial derivatives zji (t) are also referred to as the
model sensitivities and are here numerically computed using the Direct Method as described by Dickinson
and Gelinas [60]. The values zji (t) provide time-varying measurements of the sensitivity of the outputs yi (t)
with respect to changes in values of the input parameters θj . Results from the derivative-based sensitivity
analysis for three input parameters α1 , α1 and α1 are presented in Figure 7, in which sensitivities with
respect to τ , s and ν, i.e, zτi , zsi and zνi , are plotted over time. Results for sensitivities with respect to other
model input parameters are available in the Supporting Information (Supporting Information, S2) which
notably demonstrate that no output concentration yi (t) displays sensitivity to the decay constants δ1 and
δ2 in the current model setup. Whereas, Figure 7 shows that, for the estimated parameter values of Θ, the
concentration of NF-κB is sensitive to small perturbations of τ , s and σ whilst nuclear NF-κB concentrations
are above the initial homeostatic NF-κB concentration. As a downstream effect, the concentrations [NLRP3i ],
[NLRP3a ], [NLRP3o ] and [pro-IL-β] are also sensitive to small perturbations of τ , s and ν, albeit to a lesser
extent than [NF-κB].

Integrating the pyroptosis pathway model with the PhysiCell
framework
Overview

Our single-cell pyroptosis model described in Section 2, is currently being integrated within a multiscale
tissue simulator developed to investigate within-host dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. This work is part of a
multidisciplinary, international coalition led by Paul Macklin (Indiana University, USA). The coalition is
made up of several subgroups who are developing individual submodels which are integrated to form a
virtual lung epithelium implemented using PhysiCell, an open source physics-based cell simulator [61]. In
the project, epithelial cells are modelled as susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Other cell types, such as
immune cells, are also included in the model but are not susceptible to the virus.
The PhysiCell SARS-CoV-2 framework consists of a hybrid agent-based model that aims to capture; virus
transmission in the tissue, intracellular viral processes (e.g., binding, endocytosis, replication, exocytosis),
infected cell responses (e.g., metabolism, chemokine secretion, cell death via apoptosis, cell death via pyroptosis), immune cell dynamics (e.g., recruitment, activation, infiltration and predation of infected cells)
and tissue damage due to infection and/or host response. For more detail on each model component, we
refer the reader to the most recent preprint from the coalition [50]. In line with a rapid prototyping and
open source research approach, the project has been through several versions and will be updated further
as each submodel is refined. Here, we will give a brief overview of the hybrid framework and discuss some
of the implications of pyroptosis in the PhysiCell tissue simulator, using the version 3 code, with our added
pyroptosis model. The pyroptosis model is fully integrated into the version 4 code, which at the time of
writing is not yet released.

Simulation outline and implementation

At the start of each PhysiCell SARS-CoV-2 tissue simulation, virions (virus particles) are non-uniformly
distributed across the epithelial cells. Virions diffuse across the tissue and can be endocytosed via ACE-2
receptors, and thereafter replicated and released by epithelial cells. If the viral RNA in an epithelial cell
surpasses a threshold value RRN A , the epithelial cell undergoes pyroptosis with a probability Π ∈ [0, 1], and
apoptosis with a probability 1−Π. The intracellular pyroptosis model governs the cellular pyroptosis-induced
secretion of the cytokines IL-18 and IL-1β,as well as the increase in cytoplasmic volume due to water influx,
and the ultimate cell membrane rupture.
Once secreted, extracellular IL-18 and IL-1β are modelled as diffusible fields across the tissue. IL-1β has
been shown to causes a pyroptotic bystander effect, whereby increased IL-1β levels can induce pyroptosis in
uninfected, or infected, cells [19, 62–64]. Therefore, in the model, epithelial cells can internalise extracellular
IL-1β, and if the level of internalised IL-1β surpasses a threshold value RIL−1β , the pyroptosis cascade is
initiated in the cell. Diffusion, secretion and uptake of virions and cytokines are handled by built-in PhysiCell
functionalities, as is apoptosis. A modified version of the system of ODEs describing the pyroptosis pathway
is numerically solved using the backward Euler method. Further details regarding implementation,as well as
information on how to access the code, are provided in Appendix F.

3.3

Agent-based model results

We now utilise the PhysiCell SARS-CoV-2 Tissue simulator to investigate the effects of pyroptosis on a
cellular-level scale. We design in silico experiments to study research questions related to virus-induced cell
death. In these in silico experiments we investigate scenarios in which epithelial cells are exposed to virus
in the absence of an immune system, simulating in vitro experiments. We investigate the impact of two key
parameters, that are described above, RIL−1β and Π.
Simulation results are provided in form of cell maps and cell count data in Figures 8 and 9. In the cell
maps provided throughout this section, epithelial cells are shown in blue when they are viable, i.e., neither
pyroptosing nor apoptosing. Uninfected epithelial cells are shown in an opaque colour, whilst infected
epithelial cells are depicted with a transparency proportional to their viral load. Cells in which the pyroptosis
process has been induced due to viral loads or bystander effects (IL-1β levels) are respectively shown in orange
and red. Once cell membrane rupture occurs, as determined by the intracellular pyroptosis pathway model,
a pyroptosing cell is removed from the system. Apoptosing cells turn black and reduce in size until they
are removed from the system. Note that, the cell count data is based on the number of cells of various
phenotypes, present in the system over time, cells that have been removed from the system are not included
in these counts. The data shown in the time-course plots are the average over 10 runs of the simulation,
while the cell maps are chosen from one run of the simulations as an example. For all cases, the standard
deviation between runs is very small, with the case depicted in Figure 9(B) being the most noticeable (i.e.,
more variable). To ensure that this small variability is clear, we include a larger version of the time-course
plot of Figure 9(B) in Appendix F, as seen in Figure F.2.
We first study the impact of the bystander effect of IL-1β, where pyroptosis may be induced in infected or
uninfected cells that are nearby pyroptosing cells secreting the cytokine. In Figure 8 we display the results
corresponding to three values of the threshold, RIL-1β , specifically (A) RIL-1β = 0.5R, (B) RIL-1β = R and
(C) RIL-1β = 1.5R, where Rest denotes an chosen threshold concentration (in units of µM). Comparing the
three cell map progressions, we observe that all cases, (A), (B) and (C), give similar results until the 24h
time-point. The later cell maps, at the 30h time-point, highlight qualitative differences between the results
of the three cases. At this time-point, when we have a lower threshold for the bystander effect, as seen
in case (A), we observe a large number of pyroptosing cells (induced by the bystander effect) and fewer
viable cells in the system in comparison to the other cases, (B) and (C). In the median case (B), there is
some bystander effect occurring, however not to as large an extent as case (A). When we have a higher
threshold for the bystander effect, as seen in case (C), we have very little bystander effect occurring at the
30h time-point. These qualitative differences are continued when comparing the 36h time-point, whereby
a lower threshold for the bystander effect (case (A)), results in most of the epithelial cells being removed
from the system, while a higher threshold (case (C)), results in a larger number of epithelial cells remaining.

December 4, 2020

16/37

When comparing the time-course plots, we see that there is a significant difference in height of the spike of
cells induced through the bystander effect, where case (A) is largest and case (C) is smallest as expected.
These results highlight that the IL-1β threshold value required for pyroptosis affects the ratio of the method
of pyroptosis inducement (virus or IL-1β), and also the time it takes for all cells to be removed from the
system, as pyroptosis is a more rapid mode of cell death than apoptosis. Although the results from these
simulations are qualitative, the model provides a framework in which to study bystander effects. Upon
availability, data related to IL-1β levels required for pyroptosis induction could be incorporated in the model
for a more quantitative analysis.
We next study the impact of the probability that an infected cell undergoes pyroptosis as opposed to
apoptosis, in response to viral load, as determined by the parameter Π. In Figure 9 we display the results
corresponding to three values of Π. As before, comparing the three cell map progressions, we observe that all
cases, (A), (B) and (C), give similar results until the 24h time-point. The qualitative differences between the
three cases are clear when comparing the cell maps at the 36h time-point. In case (A) where the probability
of pyroptosis is Π = 0, the results show that a large number of viable epithelial cells remain. However, in case
(B) where Π = 0.5, by the 36hr time-point there are fewer viable cells remaining and more cells undergoing
pyroptosis, mainly from the bystander effect. Finally, when Π = 1 in case (C), by the 36h time-point most
of the viable epithelial cells have been removed, with some pyroptosing cells remaining. Through the timecourse plots, we can see the clear distinction of cells undergoing apoptosis versus pyroptosis between the
three cases. These simulation results show that increasing the value of Π speeds up the overall eradication of
epithelial cells. The reason for this is two-fold: pyroptosis contributes to bystander induced cell deaths and
the pyroptosis process is faster than apoptosis. More specifically, the time it takes for a cell to pyroptose or
apoptose in the simulation is 2 and 8.5 hours respectively. We note, that in the time-course plot for case
(B), where Π = 0.5, we observe a visible standard deviation resulting from 10 simulation runs. This is due
to the added stochasticity in the model arising from the non-deterministic mode of cell death when Π 6= 0
and Π 6= 1. The time-course plot for Π = 0.5 is included in a zoomed-in format in Appendix F, Figure F.2.

Conclusions and future work

Pyroptosis has been identified as a key mechanism involved in the cytokine storm and the inflammation
associated with severe cases of COVID-19 [2]. Consequently, pyroptosis has been suggested as a target
pathway to treat symptoms of COVID-19. In order to investigate the pathway of pyroptosis in further detail,
we formulate a single-cell mathematical model that captures the key proteins and intracellular processes
involved in this pro-inflammatory mode of cell death. Specifically, we model the process from DAMP/PAMPinduced TLR signalling to membrane rupture and the resulting cell death. The model is described in terms of
a system of ODEs describing the dynamics of protein concentrations and cell volume. We further expand the
model to include pharmacodynamic effects of a generic, NLRP3-targeting anti-inflammatory drug, and then
perform both local and global sensitivity analyses in order to investigate how sensitive the model results are
to the model parameters and their estimated values. Finally, we provide some detail on how this single-cell
model is being integrated into a wider cellular-scale model that is being used to investigate SARS-CoV-2
progression in lung epithelial cells.
Recently, it has been found that if the pyroptosis pathway is inhibited, a cell can undergo apoptosis instead,
a form of non-inflammatory cell death [11, 16, 18, 21, 65]. In our single-cell model, described in Section 2, we
have shown in our simulations that the inclusion of an NLRP3-targeting anti-inflammatory drug can delay the
formation of the inflammasome, and therefore may provide a method of switching the cell death mode from
inflammatory to non-inflammatory. The single-cell model developed in this study could further be extended
to investigate more specific pharmacodynamic actions of anti-inflammatory drugs that target the formation
of the NLRP3 inflammasome, a comprehensive review of such drugs is provided by Bertinara et al. [15].
One such drug is tranilast, an NLRP3-targeting drug that is traditionally used for treating inflammatory
diseases, such as asthma, in Japan and South Korea. Tranislast is currently being re-purposed for treating
COVID-19 related symptoms in a clinical trial1 [2,66]. Moreover, corticosteroids such as Dexamethasone have

been suggested as agents to counter the cytokine storm in severe cases of COVID-19 [67], and preliminary
reports from clinical trials suggest that low-dose dexamethasone therapy has beneficial effects in COVID-19
patients requiring ventilation or supplemental oxygen [68]. As a corticosteroid, Dexamethasone has many
potential pharmacodynamic effects. Of relevance to the study of pyroptosis is that Dexamethasone has been
shown to directly bind to, or indirectly inhibit, NF-κB, thus preventing the transcription of NLRP3 and
pro-inflammatory cytokines [69]. Therefore, in future work, we could mathematically investigate the impact
that this type of drug action would have on the single-cell pathway model.
When investigating the role of pyroptosis in the PhysiCell SARS-CoV-2 framework, as described in Section 3,
our results highlight that the mode of cell death impacts the cellular-scale dynamics. In this paper we have
investigated an in vitro situation, however the PhysiCell framework supports the inclusion of tissue-level
components, such as immune cells and interferons (IFNs), to simulate in vivo scenarios. IFNs can play a role
in inhibiting inflammasome activation and cytokine storms [2]. Type II IFNs typically affect the processes
downstream of NLRP3 signalling [70], while type I IFNs regulate the upstream processes [71]. Moreover, the
role of type I IFNs in the treatment of COVID-19 is being investigated [72]. Using the PhysiCell SARS-CoV2 tissue simulator, we could investigate the effects of allowing IFNs to interact with the pyroptosis pathway.
Furthermore, previous studies have shown that IL-18 can act as a recruiter of immune cells [19, 62, 73–76].
Therefore, in the PhysiCell SARS-CoV-2 framework, we are implementing processes that allow extracellular
IL-18 to act as an immune-cell recruiting cytokine.
We finally remark that pyroptosis had been identified as a potential contributor to symptoms in various
diseases other than COVID-19 [2], such as other virus-induced diseases [19], auto-immune diseases [15, 62]
and cancer [17, 21, 77]. Therefore, the mathematical pyroptosis model developed in this paper could be
modified and used to investigate the effect of pyroptosis in other disease scenarios.

Signal 1.

The initial signal, S1 , as defined in Equation (4), is here considered to be either on, S1 = 1, or off, S1 = 0.
This binary choice is motivated by the modelling assumption that there will be no inflammasome-inducing

December 4, 2020

28/37

signalling until the DAMP/PAMP-sensing TLR activity is high enough. Therefore any signal level below
some threshold value, here e.g., S1 = 1, would not stimulate a downstream response. We here also assumed
that once S1 is turned on, this signal is kept at a constant level until the cell dies. In future model adaptations this binary and constant signalling can be modified to allow for continuous responses determined by
internal and external stimuli.

B.3

Signal 2.

In the model we assume that the second signal, S2 , is either on or off. For all shown simulation results, we
assume that S2 is on, so that S2 = 1, for all time-points in the simulation. Through experiments, Juliana et
al. [78] showed that increasing the time that a cell was exposed to ATP (yielding a second signal S2 to turn
on) did not alter the subsequent inflammasome dynamics or the expression of involved proteins. Thus, it
could be argued that assuming that S2 is constant, i.e., on or off, throughout the simulation is a reasonable
model assumption.

B.4

Reaction terms.

To describe the transcription or cleavage terms we use a Hill function [54], of the form,
α

[A]γ
.
+ [A]γ

Aγ50

(34)

Here, A50 represents the level of [A] required for the Hill function to reach the value of a half, often referred to
the half-max value of [A] [79]. Here, α is some rate parameter that determines how quickly the transcription
or cleavage process occurs. To describe the activation terms in the ODE system we consider chemical
reactions of the form,
k
A−
→ B,
(35)
where A and B are the inactive and active components, respectively. The reaction rate k determines how
fast this process occurs. Using the law of mass action we can then translate this into the term used in the
ODE for concentration [A], i.e., −k[A][B], and for concentration [B], i.e., +k[A][B].
Similarly, to include decay terms, we consider a chemical reaction of the form,
δ

A−
→ ∅,

(36)

where ∅ here denotes that the component is removed from the system. Again, using the law of mass action
we can then use this to write the decay terms within the ODE for concentration [A], i.e., −δ[A].
Binding interactions within the model are added considering a reaction of the form,
k

A+B −
→ C(+B).

(37)

Here, component A and B bind together to form a 3rd component C and this process can use up (or not
use up) component B. Using the law of mass action we can then use this to write the binding terms within
the ODE for concentration [A], i.e., − k[A][B], and concentration [C], i.e., + k[A][B]. Note, the terms for
concentration [B] will either be − k[A][B] or will not be included, if the component is used up in the binding
process or not, respectively.

B.5

Anti-inflammatory drug terms.

The influence of the anti-inflammatory drug is included in a modified version of the model which results in
additional terms for the dynamics of NLRP3a given in Equation (29). Also included in the drug model is
the dynamics of the anti-inflammatory drug, Drug, and the complex Drug · NLRP3a , as is in Equations (30)
and (31). Here, we consider a binding reaction of the form,

Mass action kinetics allows us to write this interaction in terms of ODEs. We consider the anti-inflammatory
drug to be a covalent inhibitor, and thus we could add an extra step in the above reaction. However, in
lieu of relevant data, we are currently considering only one reaction step for Drug binding to NLRP3o in an
effort to not include extra model parameters.

Model parameter values

In this appendix, we provide further detail on how we estimated the values of the parameters used within
the single-cell pathway model simulations. The parameters used to perform numerical simulations of the
model are those provided in Table C.1, unless stated otherwise.

Figure C.1. We construct a timeline for the pyroptosis pathway using data from Bagaev et al. [51], de
Vasconcelos et al. [56] and Martı́n-Sánchez et al. [82]. At 0 minutes (start time), Signal 1 (S1 ) turns on.
Thereafter, at 10 minutes, nuclear NF-κB levels peak, after which the cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation
of NF-κB ceases in the mathematical model. 77 minutes into the timeline, enough NLRP3 has been
transcribed, synthesised and activated to form the inflammasome base. Then, at 107 minutes, the
GSDMD-N induced pores start forming, allowing the outflux of IL-1β and IL-18,as well as the influx of
extracellular water which causes the cell volume to start increasing. Finally, at 120 minutes (the end time)
the cell membrane completely ruptures. At this point, around 90% of the pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 will
have been cleaved and subsequently released to the extracellular environment.

C.1

Decay parameters.

In [80], it was found that NLRP3 had a half-life of approximately 6 hrs when stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which translates to a decay rate of approximately 0.002 µm min−1 . Therefore we choose,
δ1 = 0.002 min−1 ,
as we assume measure concentrations as dimensionless, arbitrary units. In [81], it was found that pro-IL-1β
had a half-life of approximately 2.5 hrs, which translates to a decay rate of approximately 0.004 µm min−1 .
Therefore we choose,
δ2 = 0.004 min−1 ,
as we assume measure concentrations as dimensionless, arbitrary units.

C.2

The timeline of pyroptosis.

We use data from three experimental studies [51, 56, 82] to estimate a timeline for events regarded in our
mathematical model. The values of the model parameters α1 − α5 , C150 , γC1 , γNF , k1a , k1b , k2 − k8 , NF50
and Vc are chosen to obtain model dynamics that follow this experimentally motivated timeline of events AD, which is illustrated in Figure C.1. Further detail of constructing this timeline is provided in the following
paragraphs.
Bagaev et al. [51] studied NF-κB kinetics in primary macrophages subjected to bacterial lipopolysaccharide
(LPS). de Vasconcelos et al. [56] investigated subcellular key events that define pyroptosis using singlecell analysis. In their article, the authors provide a multitude of data pertaining to bone marrow-derived
macrophages (BMDMs) that undergo caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis upon Bacillus anthracis lethal toxin
(LeTx) stimulation. Martı́n-Sánchez et al. [82] measured the levels of pro-IL-1β and external IL-1β over
time after inflammasome activation in systems with mouse BMDMs.
A: Bagaev et al. [51] reported that the nuclear NF-κB concentration peaked at 10 minutes post LPS activation, after which it decreased to a half-maximal level in a gradual manner over 100 minutes.

B: de Vasconcelos et al. [56] showed that the influx of Ca2+ occurs before total membrane permeabilisation
in pyroptosis (see Figure 7 in de Vasconcelos et al. [56]). Further data from their study suggests that changes
in mitochondrial activity occur between (45+12=56) and (21+9=30) minutes prior to complete membrane
rupture (see Figure 1 combined with Figure 3,as well as Supplementary Figure 3 in de Vasconcelos et al.
[56]). If we assume that Ca2+ influx and changes in mitochondrial activity commence between the priming
and activation events, we can estimate that the NLRP3 inflammasome base is formed somewhere between
56 to 30 minutes prior to cell rupture. In the model we use the average value (43 minutes) as the time before
cell rupture (end time) when the inflammasome forms (i.e. when the concentration of NLRP3o reaches the
threshold value n). Therefore event B occurs around end time - 43 minutes = (120-43) minutes = 77 minutes.
C: In de Vasconcelos et al.’s study, cell volumes increase gradually for approximately 13 minutes prior to
membrane rupture. Furthermore, cell volumes where reported to increase by approximately 50%. (See Figure 6a,b in de Vasconcelos et al. [56]).
D: Supernatants from cell cultures were assayed for LDH activity in de Vasconcelos et al.’s study. LDH
is a cytosolic protein that is released by pyroptotic cells, and LDH activity is commonly used as a marker
for plasma rupture in experimental settings. Data showed that near-maximal supernatant LDH values were
reached 120 minutes post LeTx stimulation (see Figure 9c in de Vasconcelos et al. [56]). From this we
approximate the time between signal 1 turning on in the model, and complete membrane rupture, to be
approximately 120 minutes.
Furthermore, results from Martı́n-Sánchez et al.’s [82] study highlight that the release of IL-1β coincided
with membrane permeability (the formation of GSDMD-N derived membrane pores), and that eventually
all of the pro-IL-1β present at the start of the experiments was cleaved and released from the cell, with
approximately 90% released within 120 minutes.

C.3

Anti-inflammatory drug parameters.

We consider drug concentrations to be constant during the simulated time span, effectively describing an
in vitro scenario without drug wash out. This could be altered to include drug dosages varying in time
if appropriate. Tranilast and oridonin examples of anti-inflammatory drugs that can inhibit the formation
of the NLRP3 inflammasome by binding to active NLRP3 [15]. Therefore, to parameterise the model
we consider data on this drug with the desired action. Immunoblot data presented by Huang et al. [53],
pertaining to LPS-primed bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) treated with tranilast, demonstrate
dose-dependent (25-100µM) drug responses, where the maximal inhibition was reached at at 100 µM of the
drug. With this motivation, we investigate drug dosages in increments of 0.25 (here arbitrary concentration
units) and adjust the k−D /k+D ratio to be “completely effective” at 1 a.u.. At this stage in the model
development, we interpret this “completely effectiveness” as the membrane rupture being delayed so that it
does not occur within 300 simulated minutes. Accordingly, we set k−D /k+D = 0.01a.u..

D

MATLAB code and set up of numerical simulations for the
single-cell model

The single-cell mathematical model was implemented in MATLAB using the ODE solver ode15s. We solve
the system of equations with the initial conditions (ICs),
[NF-κBn ](0) = 0.25,
[ASCf ](0) = [pro-C1](0) = [GSDMD](0) = [pro-IL-18](0) = V (0) = 1,
while all other variables start out with a zero initial condition, to represent a cell in homeostasis. For the
results shown in Figure 3 we consider the model without drug intervention, that is,
[Drug](0) = 0,

December 4, 2020

32/37

whereas, in the results shown in Figure 4 we consider the initial concentration of the drug to be a value
between 0 and 1. Note, as we consider an in vitro situation we consider the drug to be present from the start
of the simulations and not decay within the simulation time. The initial conditions pertaining to NF-κB
are motivated by previous experiments by Bagaev et al. [51], reporting initial nuclear NF-κB concentrations
to be between 10% and 30% (of the total amount of cellular NF-κB), depending on cell line. For other
variables with a non-zero IC, we set the value 1 to be the initial concentration as we are currently working
with arbitrary units of concentration/volume and considering relative compound concentrations using the
conservation laws provided throughout the manuscript.
The simulation results provided in Figures 3 and 4 are obtained by running the code with the ICs described
above, along with the parameters given in Table C.1 and the signals S1 and S2 turned on. The MATLAB
code, including user instructions, is available on our project GitHub page: https://github.com/Pyroptosis.

Further details of the sensitivity analysis

The key outputs of our model are whether the inflammasome is formed, the levels of IL-1β and IL-18 released
into the external environment and the time it takes for the cell to rupture. We summarise the sensitivity
analysis results in regards to the key outputs of the model in Table E.1. The plotted results for each
robustness analysis can be found in Supporting Information, S1.

with the parameter values from the lowest value tested to the highest value tested. Here, ‘-’ denotes that
there is no change in this result while varying the parameter. Those with ‘→’ are cases in which the

Reduced model and details of PhysiCell implementation

To implement the ODE pathway model, as described in Section 2, into the PhysiCell framework, the model
must be discretised using the Backward Euler method. For Version 4 of the PhysiCell model, we use a reduced

version of our ODE model. In this reduced version the dynamics of NF-κB are more linear. Furthermore,
determining whether the inflammasome base has formed to allow ASC binding is determined by a binary
on-off function, rather than the continuous form used previously. This function F is defined as,
(
1 if [NLRP3o ] < n,
(39)
F = F ([NLRP3o ]) :=
0 if [NLRP3o ] = n.
For the model we further utilise the conservation laws, for ASC (Equation (13)), Caspase-1 (Equation (16)),
GSDMD (Equation (19)) and IL-18 (Equation (27)) where we set the constant to equal 1. This results in
the system,

We then discretise this using the Backward Euler method to implement it in to the ABM framework. The
parameter values used are displayed in Table F.1 and we plot the solutions of the Backward Euler method
using these parameters in Figure F.1. For more details of the full PhysiCell model we refer the reader to
