Summary
The COVID-19 has caused more than three million infections and over two hundred thousand deaths by
April 20201. Limiting socioeconomic activities (SA) is among the most adopted governmental mitigating
efforts to combat the transmission of the virus, though the degree varies dramatically among different
regimes2. This study aims to quantify the contribution from the SA and weather conditions to the
transmission of COVID-19 at global scale. Ruling out the unobservable factors including medical
facilities and other control policies (MOC) through region-by-time fixed effects3,4, we show that the
limiting SA has a leading contribution to lower the reproductive number by 18.3%, while weather
conditions, including ultraviolet, relative humidity, and wind explain a smaller amount of variation.
Temperature might have a non-monotonic impact on the transmission. We further show that in developed
countries5 and China, the SA effect is more pronounced whereas the weather effect is significantly
downplayed possibly because people tend to stay indoors most of the time with a controlled climate. We
finally estimate the reduced reproductive number and the population spared from infections due to
restricting SA at 40,964, 180,336, 174,494, in China, United States, and Europe respectively. From late
January to mid-April, all regions, except for China, Australia, and south Korea show a steep upward trend
of spared infections due to restricting SA. US and Europe, in particular, show far steeper upward trends of
spared infections in the analyzed timeframe, signaling a greater risk of reopening the economy too soon.

Main Text
The COVID-19, declared global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), is reporeted to
have infected more than three million population in 213 countries and territories by April 20201. Up-todate, it has a 30-40 times death rate of seasonal influenza (3-4% vs. 0.1%) and infects all ages2.
Managing a controlled transition from community transmission to a low-level or no transmission is, at
present, the best-case outcome in the short and medium term in the absence of an effective treatment
and vaccine6. The restriction of socioeconomic activity (SA) is a widely adopted mitigation management
by national and subnational authorities for combating the virus. Strong form of restrictions involves city
lock down, mandatory quarantine, and large-scale demobilization while weak form includes shelter-inplace order allowing for the openness of essential businesses and domestic travel. The degree to which
SA is restricted varies dramatically with location, time, and climate regions, and is difficult to measure
directly. Additional difficulty lies with civilians’ compliance with governmental orders. Consequently,
the impact on suppressing the COVID-19 transmissibility of limiting SA in various weather conditions
remains unknown7.
Previous studies on restriction effects rely on news of governmental announcements controls8-11 or
human travel records12 to predict the number of infectees in a single city, country, or regime12-15 based
on the stochastic susceptible-exposed-infectious removed (SEIR) modeling framework or its variance.

Hypothetical scenarios of lifting the restrictions can therefore be estimated after SEIR is parameterized.
These methods are, however, difficulty to applied globally because: 1) human travel records obtained
from a personal tracking system do not exist in most countries, 2) the announcement of control policies
and the practical implementation and public compliance can be inconsistent, and 3) a process model like
SEIR requires many regionally heterogeneous epidemic parameters11,12 which are unavailable globally.
Furthermore, validating the model only by the records from a strictly controlled region or country (e.g.
Wuhan or China) might bias the estimation of an extreme scenario with no controls. Without using the
global data, it is also difficult to assess the seasonal effects.
We build a panel regression model (Methods) to quantify contribution of SA, climate, and MOC to
the transmissibility of COVID-19 over the globe during the community spread period. We estimate the
daily reproductive number, R0 , of COVID-19, following a widely adopted statistical approach8,16 which
only requires the daily confirmed number of infectees1. R0 is an indicator of the transmissibility of a
virus, representing average number of secondary infectees generated by a primary infector17. For R0 > 1,
the number infected is likely to multiply, and for R0 < 1, transmission is likely to die out18. We proxy
daily SA by the satellite concentration of NO2 (Sentinel-5P level-2 pollutant product)19 because it is
significanlty negatively associated with SA and available globally. The weather data are from the
meteorologcial reanalysis20. We quantify MOC through regionalized time fixed effects. Depening on the
infectee records availability, we estimate 6,386 daily R0 values from 3,315,748 confirmed cases of 213
countries or provinces/states from late January to mid April. Besides the overall contribution, we also
compare the regional difference of the contribution, and the MOC evolvement. We finally estimate that
compared to a hypothetical scenario with no restriction of SA, the global R0 reduction contributed by the
limiting SA from late January to mid April, and the consequent spared number of infectees.

Results
Quantifying the overall contribution of SA and climateUsing all global records, we find that SA,
Ultraviolet (UV), temperature (T), windspeed (u), and relative humidity (RH) significant affect R0
(R2=0.51 and all p<0.001, Table 2, Extended Data). Esimated by the product of the dependent-variable
coefficient and value range over the response-variable value range, Table 1(a) shows strongly positive
contribution of SA, moderately positive and negative contribution of temperature and UV, and weakly
negative contribution of windspeed and RH. Therefore, SA restriction, UV illumination, high wind and
high humidity could reduce the transmission. SA has a leading contribution of 18.3%±2.0% (95%
Confidence Interval, CI). Sunlight kills the virus directly, increases cell cytotoxicity and modulates the
biosynthesis of vitamin D which are essential to promote immune responses21. Higher relative humidity
prevents viral particles traveling as far as it could in drier air22.
We further control the regions to only include data in China and developed countries to confirm the
contribution of SA and weather. The R2 is increased to 0.61 and the SA contribution is increased to
23.2%±3.0% (95% CI), 4.9% higher than the global scale, whereas UV, wind, and RH become insignificant
(Table 3, Extended Data). The result might be explained by the fact that in more developed areas,
people tend to stay indoors with a controlled climate most of the time21. This suggests that simply
depending on favorable weather conditions, such as warm weather and high UV, has strong limitations
in stopping the virus transmission in these areas.

The nonmonotonic temperature contribution
We suspect a nonmonotonic contribution of temperature by restricting temperature to low or high
(T<25°C or T≥25°C) in the regresion because the coefficient of temperature changes from weakly
positive to strongly negative (Table 4 vs. Table 5, Extended Data). We hypothesize that the virus might
have a viable temperature range. This finding agrees with a few previous studies on coronavirus23 and

COVID-1924,25, but disagrees with most studies claiming temperature has a decreasing26,27, increasing22 or
no effect28 on the transmissibility. However, we note that the sample size, with only 747 samples, is
relatively small when restricting tempeture to high (T≥25°). More data in the incoming season are
needed to confirm the temperature effects because most regions in the globe have not experienced a
COVID-19 pandemic with high temperature.

Global transmissibility reduction through restricting SA
We estimate the global decrease of R0 due to the SA restriction as half monthly mean in Figure 1.
Because China has the earliest outbreak since late January, earlier than the rest of the world, we provide
the R0 reduction from late January to Feburary only in China in Figure 1(a)-(c) and the R0 reduction of the
world from March to mid April in Figure 1(d)-(f). China imposed the strongest policy on restricting SA at
an early stage, from Feburary to the first half of March, and saw the largest reduction of R0. The major
outbreak provinces of China had a R0 reduction from 0.08 to 0.18 in the first half of Feburary, and from
0.02 to 0.12 in the latter half of Feburary and first half of March. China graduately lifted the restriction
of SA since the latter half of March (Figure 1 e and f). The SA restriction in Europe came in the latter half
of March, and the R0 reduction was from 0.02 to 0.06 in the latter half of March and from 0.04 to 0.06 in
the first half of April. The western US started SA strictions in the latter half of March, earlier than the
rest of the US. The western US saw a reduction of R0 from 0.02 to 0.08 from later March to April, and the
eastern saw R0 reduction from 0.04 to 0.10 in April.
Consequently, compared to a hypothetical scenario with no SA restriction during the community
spread, we estimate in Figure 1(g) that China spared 40,964 (95% CI 31,463-51,470) infectees with
37,727 (95% CI, 28,925-47,488) in the Hubei Province, its outbreak center. Europe spared 174,494 (95%
CI 139,202-210,841) infectees, where Germany, France, Spain, Italy, and United Kingdom spared 22,674
(95% CI 18,076-27,461), 24,463 (95%CI 19,527-29,541), 28,857 (95% CI 23,058-34,812),32,541 (95% CI
25,855-39,479), 18,580 (95% CI 14,864-22,386) respectively. The United States (US) spared 180,336
(95% CI 142,860-219,445) with 79,813 (95% CI 62,887-97,653) in New York State (The full table of spared
infectees over time is available in the SI).
The number of spared infectees is a compound result of R0 reduction and timing. Athough the R0
reduction in Europe and US is significantly smaller than that in China, it spared significantly more
infectees because of their higher number of infectors when the restriction of SA started. Error!
Reference source not found. shows the regional spared infectees through SA restrictions in half-month
intevals. Only China Mainland, Taiwan, South Korea, and Australia show a diminshed trend, as a result of
early restrictions of SA, whereas the Europe and the US continue to see large number of spared
infectees growing exponentially by the end of this analysis. The rest of the world, though having fewer
number of spared infectees than Europe and US, show rapid growth. Maintaining restricted SA might
still be a safer option for them. We suspect the lifting of SA restritions to reopen the economy in these
countries might pose great risk.

Medical facility capacity and other control factors (MOC) evolvement
In Figure 3, the MOC is descreased the fastest in Australia and China to a value lower than or close to
-1 eventually, indicating a resillient medical system or more effective control policy. The effectivness of
the MOC in Australia might be explained by the adoption of additional control measures including
mandatory quarantine of overseas arrivals and travel bans outside of Australia, and the relative small
number of infectors in the beginning of the outbreak29. Although China was hit much harder in the
begining, it survived the stress by imposing more strict control policies including the lockdown of the
Hubei province, large-scale demobilization and mandatory quarantine of returning migrants (domestic)
workers29, and by promptly increasing medical facilities including temporary hospitals30 and reinforced
medical crews from other provinces to the outbreak center31. The MOC of Europe, US, and arctic

countries starts from a high value and decreases rapidly, but has not reached a low value at the end of
our analyses (above or close to zero), indicating that their medical facility capacity and control polices
(other than restricting SA) is evolving rapidly while still under stress of the large number of infectees
accumlated during an earlier phase of the outbreak. The MOC of Africa and Latin America, though
started with a low number, does not decrease as rapidly as the rest of the world.

Limitations
Our study has the following limitations. First, R0 , the reproductive number, is estimated from
confirmed infectee records which can be inaccurate due to the lack of tested cases especially in the
beginning of the outbreak and in regions with less testing capacity. Without globally distributed
epidemic parameters of COVID-19 other than the confirmed cases, the adopted statistical estimation
seems to be the only practical global solution (Method). Second, although the weather impacts are
significant and are within expectation, the contribution of temperature, is subjected to revisitation after
more countries experience the warmer weather. Finally, because the MOC is not parameterized but
merely quantified, we cannot project MOC into the future. Therefore, our result should only be used to
assess the contribution of each predictor, especially the restriction of socioeconomic activities, instead
of predicting the total number of infectees in the future climate, or the end of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods
The reproductive number estimation
Since except for the number of infectees and deaths, epidemic parameters of COVID-19 are not
globally available, we employ the stochastic approach by 8,16 to estimate the reproductive number, R0. R0
of a given country or state/province at day t, R0t, can be estimated from daily confirmed number of
infectees (C), via an intermediate variable, daily number of new infectors (I). The conversion from 𝐶𝑡 to
𝐼𝑡 is given by equation (1),
𝑡+𝑁

𝐼𝑡 = ∑

(1)

𝐶𝜏 𝑙𝑔𝑛𝜏−𝑡

𝜏=𝑡+1

where 𝑙𝑔𝑛𝑡 is probability of an infectee to get clinical confirmation t days since being infected16. The
conversion from 𝐼𝑡 to 𝑅0𝑡 is given by equation (2),
𝑡−1

𝑅0𝑡 = 𝐼𝑡 / ∑

𝜏=𝑡−𝑁

𝐼𝜏 𝑔𝑡−𝜏

(2)

where 𝑔𝑡 is the probability of an infector to infect other people after t days since being infected8.

The contribution model and software
We fit a panel regression model with region-by-time fixed effects3 (MOC) to quantify the contribution
of SA and weather conditions to R0, using the REGHDFE module in Stata software4,32,
𝑅0𝑖,𝑡 = 𝛼 + 𝛽1 ln(𝑁𝑂2 )𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛽2 T𝑖,𝑡 +𝛽3 ln(𝑈𝑉)𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛽4 𝑅𝐻𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛽5 𝑣𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛿𝑟,𝑡

(3)

where 𝑁𝑂2 T, 𝑈𝑉, 𝑅𝐻, 𝑣 stand for the total column of Nitrogen Dioxide concentration(mol/m2), air
temperature (°C), ultraviolet intensity (W/m2), relative humidity (%), and windspeed (m/s), and 𝛿𝑟,𝑡 is
the region-by-time fixed effects, with subscripts i and r standing for the response unit and region. A
response unit is either a country or a province/state depending on the availability of COVID-19 records.
For example, records are available in China, US, Canada, and Australia at province/state level while only
available at country level in most other regions. t stands for the days after community spread (Ct>30).
The world is divided into 10 regions depending on the geographic proximity and data availability. They
are, China, United States, Europe, Africa, Latin America, Australia (Australia and New Zealand), West
Asia, South Asia, East Asia and Arctic (Canada and Russia).
The reduction of 𝑅0𝑖,𝑡 by restricting SA can be estimated by the product of 𝛽1 and the difference of
between the ln(𝑁𝑂2 )𝑖,𝑡 under restriction and the ln(𝑁𝑂2 )𝑟𝑒𝑓 with no restriction which is averaged from
the same period of the last year, i.e., 2019. Note that we only averaged the same period using the year
of 2019 because Sentinel-5P data is only available after June 2018. Substituting the hypothetical 𝑅0𝑖,𝑡
back to equation (2), we can estimate the number of infectees with no restricted SA.

Data Source and Processing Method
R0 is estimated from daily clinical confirmation of COVID-19 infectees assembled at Johns
Hopkins University1 in excel tables. The 𝑁𝑂2 concentration is retrieved from Sentinel-5P level 2
product19 at daily intervals of 3.5 km ×7.5 km nadir resolution in netcdf4 format. Climate
predictors are extracted from the ERA 5 atmospheric reanalyses20 at hourly intervals and 0.25°
×0.25° grids in GRIB format. All climate predictors are averaged to daily mean and then
averaged to the country or state/province weighted by population density from Gridded
Population of the World (GPW)33 in GeoTiff format. The 𝑁𝑂2 concentration is first spatially

averaged to sub-level administrative areas of the response unit then weighted averaged by
population density to the response unit.
