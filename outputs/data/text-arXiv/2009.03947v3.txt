A BSTRACT
The novel corona-virus disease (also known as COVID-19) has led to a pandemic, impacting more
than 200 countries across the globe. With its global impact, COVID-19 has become a major concern
of people almost everywhere, and therefore there are a large number of tweets coming out from every
corner of the world, about COVID-19 related topics. In this work, we try to analyze the tweets and
detect the trending topics and major concerns of people on Twitter, which can enable us to better
understand the situation, and devise better planning. More specifically we propose a model based on
the universal sentence encoder to detect the main topics of Tweets in recent months. We used universal
sentence encoder in order to derive the semantic representation and the similarity of tweets. We then
used the sentence similarity and their embeddings, and feed them to K-means clustering algorithm
to group similar tweets (in semantic sense). After that, the cluster summary is obtained using a text
summarization algorithm based on deep learning, which can uncover the underlying topics of each
cluster. Through experimental results, we show that our model can detect very informative topics,
by processing a large number of tweets on sentence level (which can preserve the overall meaning
of the tweets). Since this framework has no restriction on specific data distribution, it can be used
to detect trending topics from any other social media and any other context rather than COVID-19.
Experimental results show superiority of our proposed approach to other baselines, including TF-IDF,
and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA).

Introduction

COVID-19 has led to a global pandemic, impacting more than 200 countries across the globe, infecting more than 20
million people, and causing more than 750,000 death as of Aug 12, 2020 [1], and there is a large number of research
works With the growing scale of COVID-19 (after March 2020), there has been a shift in the distributions of Tweets
posted on Twitter, reflecting the fact that COVID-19 has become a major concern of people across the world. To
illustrate this, in Figure 1 we show the most frequent words used in Twitter during April 2020 (the 2nd month of global
pandemic of COVID-19). As we can see words like "death", "help", "COVID-19" are among the popular words.
Analyzing people’s opinion and concerns on social media can help us to better understand public’s concern and
expectations, enabling the government and health official to have a better planning for managing the situation. There
has already been a few works analyzing COVID-19 related Tweets. As an example, in [2], Kleinberg et al. presented a
ground truth dataset of emotional responses to COVID-19, and presented a framework to detect the main concerns of
people in different countries on COVID-19 subject. In [3], Ordun and colleagues analyzed five different techniques to
assess the distinctiveness of topics, key terms and features, speed of information dissemination, and network behaviors
for Covid-19 related tweets. In [4], Singh et al. looked at the information and misinformation shared on Twitter. They
tried to see if the discussion is emerging from, myths shared about the virus, and how much of it is connected to
other high and low quality information on the Internet. So far, there has not been a solid framework which leverages
the state-of-the-arts in natural language processing, to detect the trending COVID-19 related topics in social medial.
Besides works trying to analyze textual data about COVID-19, there are many works trying to analyze other types
of data (images, time-series, clinical information) to get insight and predictive models about different aspects of
COVID-19 [5, 6, 7, 8].

Figure 1: The most frequent words used by people on Twitter during the first 3 months of pandemic.
In this work, we propose a deep learning based framework to detect trending topics people are talking about on
Twitter, using a combination of transfer learning and clustering algorithms. Deep learning based models have been
very successful in achieving state-of-the-art results in many of the NLP problems in the recent years, including
word embedding, sentiment analysis, question answering, and machine translation [9, 10, 11]. We first extract the
representation (embedding) of sentences in Tweets using "Sentence Transformer", which can capture the semantic
information of the sentences. We then use clustering algorithms to group similar sentences (based on their embeddings)
into the same groups. Ideally different clusters contain different semantic topics. After that, text summarization is used
to get the summary of sentences in each cluster, which can uncover the trending topics of them.
Compared to the classical models for topic modeling (such latent Dirichlet allocation, LDA), this work better employs
the semantic information and meaning of the tweets, by first representing a sentence-level embedding of tweets, and
then using those embeddings to group the tweets. In this way, we can find similar topics by directly analyzing sentences,
rather than considering words similarity (as used in LDA). Figure 2 shows the word-cloud of sentences belonging to
one of the topic clusters of our model.

Here are the main contributions of this work:
• We provide a novel framework, which can detect the trending COVID-19 related topics on social media,
such as Twitter, in an unsupervised fashion. We do so, by first extracting a sentence-level embedding using
sentence-Transformer, and then grouping similar sentences into the same cluster using k-means clustering,
2

and finally extracting each cluster summary with a deep learning based text summarization. This summary
contains the major topics of each cluster.
• We provide a detailed experimental study showing the promise of this work, and its advantages over simple
baselines such as using TF-IDF and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA).
The structure of the rest of this paper is as follows: In section 2, we provide the details of the proposed algorithm.
Section 3 provides an overview of the dataset used in our experiments. In Section 4, we provide the experimental
analysis of the proposed algorithm in terms of detected topics, trending words in each topic cluster, and sentence
representation similarity. And finally the paper is concluded in Section 5.

Proposed method

This work proposes a new framework for detecting the trending COVID-19 related topics on Twitter, using Universal
Sentence Encoder and text summarization. The overall structure of our proposed approach is presented in Figure 3. As
it can be seen from this figure, we first obtain the adequate data from Twitter and get tweets through twitter API. After
that, data cleaning part needs to performed on the collected tweets. Then, the Universal Sentence Encoder is used to
extract the feature representation (embedding) of tweet’s sentences. The sentence embeddings from different tweets are
then fed into the k-means clustering algorithm to group them semantically similar ones into the same cluster. In the end,
TextRank summarization technique is applied on the sentences of cluster to generate a summary of each cluster, which
contains the most representative topic. More detailed description of each stem, is provided in the following subsections.

2.1

Tweet Encoder

In recent years, there have been many efforts to create a semantic representation of textual sequence (such as sentence,
paragraph, or document). These methods include a wide range of techniques from word movers distance to the recent
state-of-the-art methods such as SentBert and Universal Sentence Encoder [12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. All of these methods
aim to provide a vector representation of sentence which can capture its semantic meaning, and provides similar
representations for similar sentences.
For example, Sentence BERT (also known as SentBERT), uses a Siamese coupled neural network composed of two
identical instances of BERT. Like any Siamese neural network, this model aims to find the similarity between the
two inputs sentences. Universal sentence encoder is another text embedding technique that has different versions for
different use cases. One variation of this model was trained with Deep Averaging Network (DAN), called USE_DAN.
This encoding model produces sentence embeddings in the way that it first gets the average embeddings of words and
bi-grams, and then applies a feed-forward neural network on the average representation. On the other hand, newer
3

version of universal sentence encoder is based on the Transformers, called USE_T, that has higher accuracy and is
computationally more intensive than USE_DAN. In this research, we employ the transformer encoder version of universal
sentence encoder. USE_T can handle words, sentence and documents, as the input. Figure 4 shows the architecture of
this model and how it encodes text into high dimensional vectors. As it can be seen from the figure, USE_T has been
trained on various downstream tasks. The encoder blocks in this figure are based on the Transformer model proposed
by the Vaswani et. al [17].

Figure 4: Architecture of USE_T and its multi-task/multi-lingual learning paradigm with shared parameters [14].
The multi-task and multi-lingual training paradigm of the USE_T makes it more suitable for tasks such as semantic
sentence pair retrieval. On the other hand, deploying USE_T in our study is more crucial with respect to relation of
semantically close tweets. The most powerful side of this architecture is its ability to find similar texts without need for
any pair computations. It provides a dense vector representation of each text unit, and this dense vectors can be used for
computing distance or similarity between different tweets or sentences [18, 19].
Based on the above reasons, we employ universal sentence encoder to capture the sentence representation of tweets.
The tweet embeddings obtained from USE_T enables us to calculate the similarity of sentences in a semantic way, which
is used by the clustering phase. It should be noted that before injecting tweets as the input of USE_T, text cleaning is a
must-do process and we performed this by selecting the most sensible and usable sentences from the pile of tweets. The
sentences which contain hashtags and mentions, are removed from our corpus.
2.2

Tweets Clustering

As it can be seen from Fig 3, once the embedding are extracted, a clustering algorithm is used to cluster tweet’s
sentences based on their embeddings obtained from previous step. The distance between two sentences’s embeddings
in this case, provides the dissimilarity of tweets.
Different clustering algorithms can be used for this purpose, such as K-means, spectral clustering, mean-shift, DensityBased Spatial Clustering (DBSC). We use K-means clustering algorithm here, for its simplicity, speed, and the ability
to pre-define the number of clusters.
2.3

Cluster summarization

The clustering step, provides several groups of semantically similar sentences. On high level, the tweets in the same
groups should contain more similar topics, than those in different groups. Although the centroid of each cluster should
contain the average embedding (therefore the average topic/concept of that cluster), it will not necessarily capture all
topics of that cluster. But it could serve as a simple baseline. A better solution for finding the topic of each cluster is to
use a text summarization technique to provide a meaningful and sensible summary of that cluster, capturing the key
topics. Here we used the TextRank summarization framework. More details on TextRank summarization is provided
in [20, 21].

Dataset

To evaluate the performance of the proposed framework, we used a dataset of tweets between 2020-03-29 and 2020-0430, that are collected via twitter API. This dataset includes more than 8 million tweets in total for English language. We
only used a random sampled of 20 percent of this dataset, which contains 1.6M tweets in total.
Figure 5 denotes the wordcloud of the most frequent words after removing the stopwords for each day. One interesting
fact from this plot is that, some words are always present among the popular ones for different days. We removed any
repeatative words of previous days to have visualization in this figure.

Figure 5: Wordcloud of twitter corona dataset based on each day; Each row presents a week.
Figure 6 shows the frequency of 8 popular words over different days. So we can see how the temporal trend of those
words changes over time. A box-plot visulization is also presented in Figure 7, which provides information about the
most frequent words for the entire dataset. Th distribution shown in this plot is acquire over 33 days. For some words
such as singing, only the first days has dramatic frequency raise, while for other days, this frequency drops seemingly.
Specific words such as help are present for entire dataset and distribution is close to normal.

Experimental Study

In this section we provide the experimental study details, and the model results. Before going into the model analysis,
we will provide the details of the hyper-parameter values, and experimental setup.
4.1

Experimental Setup

We used the universal sentence encoder transformer based version 5, which is available at Google Tensorflow-hub 1 .
This version has been trained on a monolingual dataset with embeddding dimension of 512. We used dot product for
similarity of embeddings.
For K-means clustering algorithm, the number of clusters is set to 30, and the max iteration to 300. This algorithms has
been initialized with K-Means++ algorithm. After clustering, we merged smaller clusters with the larger ones using the
similarity of their centroids. The clusters with smaller sizes are thought to be noisy ones. The clustering algorithm has
been applied for each day (out of the 33 days) and the summarization is performed on the largest clusters in each day.
The maximum summarization word count is set to 20 words and the TextRank based method is used for this task. The
resulted summary for each day contains two or three sentences.
4.2

Experimental Results and discussion

This section presents the experimental results. Before revealing the outputs, we should note some points . First point
is that the evaluation is performed on the subset of 20% of the samples. The second point is that we use TF-IDF
for baseline comparison. Finally, the same clustering method (K-means) and summarization technique (using same
TextRank as described in sec. 2.3) are applied to TF-IDF approach. For LDA its default setup is used for comparison.
4.3

Model Results

Figure 8 denotes the UMAP visualization of the tweets embedding of the most representative cluster for four days in
our dataset. This figure shows five major clusters for each day. The presented UMAP dimensionality reduction shows
the separability of clusters. Considering overlaps of all clusters on a major topic (covid19), this topic separation is
an advantage. Figures 9 (a) and (b) illustrate the visualization results of TF-IDF and our approach for the first day
of dataset. As we can see our approach provides more distinctive groups in this cluster. For the sake of comparison
and producing a baseline for this dataset, we keep the original pipeline and use TF-IDF instead of universal sentence
encoder. As it can be derived from the Figure 9 (a), the clusters created by TF-IDF are more separable and it is because
of TF-IDF nature. But in case of output results, it did not have better result compared to our approach because of
its inability to capture semantic relevance of inter-topic a irrelevance of out of topic texts. In another word, TF-IDF
1

6

completely separates topics that we know is not correct due to the fact that there are significant overlaps among topics
Figure 9 (b) proves that our approach separates topics by considering their overlapping. That means our approach
obtains overlapping communities in which the tweets have the same topics.

Figure 8: UMAP visualization of topics for each day; we dropped the outliers of each cluster for better visualization.
Summarized text obtained by our method for each topic for all days is presented in Table 4. Table 1 demonstrates the
resulting topics and extracted keywords using TF-IDF, which can be compared to Table 2 for the first date of dataset
incident. These tables prove that using universal sentence encoder not only enables a better clustering result, but also
makes a better summary of each cluster than TF-IDF approach. The obtained keywords also are another evidence to
confirm USE_T works better than TF-IDF. USE_T suggests meaningful keywords which discover main topics in tweets.
While, TF-IDF can’t capture semantics and detect the most relevant keywords that represent the topic of the cluster.

Table 3 shows the quantitative results of our approach compared to LDA and TF-IDF. We used the labeled version of
the dataset for this comparison. Top 10 precision, recall and f1 measure are used as metrics. From this table, it is clearly
seen that our approach made over 11 and 27 percent improvements compared to LDA and TF-IDF respectively.
4.4

Discussion

As it is clear from the visualization outputs of TF-IDF, the clusters tend to be at the very same center or they are
some noisy looking points around a centroid. In case of our approach, the clusters are divided into more separated
sub-groups. The reason is that our approach considers and obtains semantic features by utilizing the USE_T for
generating embeddings while TF-IDF produces raw vectorization. On the other hand, the result of TF-IDF in table
1 shows that it is merging topics that are not combinable. In contrast, in our approach, the clusters can be combined,
because of semantic relativity and the dot product similarity metric, which in the case of TF-IDF no such approach
would be applicable. Briefly, the partitions originated by our proposed method is more meaningful than TF-IDF due to
extracting more semantic features from text and considering overlaps between topics.

Moreover, the semantically close points from output of USE_T shows groups of near text representations that are
centered around specific centroids with some kind of noise around them. While in case of TF-IDF, the noise is all
over the reduced dimension output and no visually detectable center points are available (discarding the same points
transformed to same location in some points that means they were the very same sentences with very close or same
words).
Another deduction from the results is that due to the emphasis of USE_T on semantic representation of tweets, it
produces better quality and meaningful summaries of each topic cluster rather than TF-IDF method, which considers
statistics of words of the tweets. Also, our approach finds keywords that better present the most relevant topics contained
in the cluster.
Clustering or topic detection based on bag-of-words methods and sparse term frequency vectorization such as TFIDF
cannot capture semantic relations. LDA on the other hand, lacks the same capability. Results from table 3 obviously
shows this gap between our approach and these two methods.

Conclusion

In this work, we proposed a trending topic detection framework using a method that combines the Transformers with
text summarization in a smart way, and applied that to COVID-19 related Tweets on Twitter. First, the sentence
embeddings are extracted using Transformer. Then these embeddings are fed into a clustering algorithm to group
similar Tweets, and finally text summarization is applied to all sentences of a each cluster to provde a short summary of
that. This framework can provide us the resulting topics in the form of concise sentences that are easier to read and
comprehend for human. This approach is applied to COVID-19 pandemic dataset collected from twitter, and several
experimental studies are performed to assess its performance. Through experimental comparison, we showed that this
model outperforms other popular topic detection approaches, based on TF-IDF, and LDA.
