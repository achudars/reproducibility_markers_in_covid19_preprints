Abstract
The recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has dramatically increased the public awareness and appreciation of the utility of dynamic models. At the same time, the dissemination of contradictory model predictions has
highlighted their limitations. If some parameters and/or state variables of a model cannot be determined from output measurements, its ability to yield correct insights – as well as the possibility of controlling the system – may
be compromised. Epidemic dynamics are commonly analysed using compartmental models, and many variations of
such models have been used for analysing and predicting the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper
we survey the different models proposed in the literature, assembling a list of 36 model structures and assessing their
ability to provide reliable information. We address the problem using the control theoretic concepts of structural
identifiability and observability. Since some parameters can vary during the course of an epidemic, we consider both
the constant and time-varying parameter assumptions. We analyse the structural identifiability and observability of
all of the models, considering all plausible choices of outputs and time-varying parameters, which leads us to analyse
255 different model versions. We classify the models according to their structural identifiability and observability
under the different assumptions and discuss the implications of the results. We also illustrate with an example several
alternative ways of remedying the lack of observability of a model. Our analyses provide guidelines for choosing the
most informative model for each purpose, taking into account the available knowledge and measurements.

1. Introduction
The current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, continues to wreak unparalleled havoc across the world. Public health authorities can use mathematical models to answer critical questions
related with the dynamics of an epidemic (severity and time course of infected people), its impact on the healthcare
system, and the design and effectiveness of different interventions [1–4]. Mathematical modeling of infectious diseases has a long history [5, 6]. Modeling efforts are particularly important in the context of COVID-19 because its
dynamics can be particularly complex and counter-intuitive due to the uncertainty in the transmission mechanisms,
possible seasonal variation in both susceptibility and transmission, and their variation within subpopulations [7]. The
media has given extensive coverage to analyses and forecasts using COVID-19 models, with increased attention to
cases of conflicting conclusions, giving the impression that epidemiological models are unreliable or flawed. However, a closer looks reveals that these modeling studies were following different approaches, handling uncertainty
differently, and ultimately addressing different questions on different time-scales [8].
Broadly speaking, data-driven models (using statistical regression or machine learning) can be used for shortterm forecasts (one or a few weeks). Mechanistic models based on assumptions about transmission and immunity

try to mimic how the virus spreads, and can be used to formalize current knowledge and explore long-term outcomes
of the pandemic and the effectiveness of different interventions. However, the accuracy of mechanistic models is
constrained by the uncertainties in our knowledge, which creates uncertainties in model parameters and even in the
model structure [8]. Further, the uncertainty in the COVID-19 data and the exponential spread of the virus amplify
the uncertainty in the predictions. Predictability studies [9] seek the characterization of the fundamental limits to
outbreak prediction and their impact on decision-making. Despite the vast literature on mathematical epidemiology
in general, and modeling of COVID-19 in particular, comparatively few authors have considered the predictability of
infectious disease outbreaks [9, 10]. Uncertainty quantification [11] is an interconnected concept that is also key for
the reliability of a model, and that has received similarly scant attention [12, 13].
In addition to predictability and uncertainty quantification approaches, identifiability is a related property whose
absence can severely limit the usefulness of a mechanistic model [14]. A model is identifiable if we can determine
the values of its parameters from knowledge of its inputs and outputs. Likewise, the related control theoretic property
of observability describes if we can infer the model states from knowledge of its inputs and outputs. If a model is
non-identifiable (or non-observable) different sets of parameters (or states) can produce the same predictions or fit to
data. The implications can be enormous: in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, non-identifiability in
model calibrations was identified as the main reason for wide variations in model predictions [15].
Reliable models can be used in combination with optimization and optimal control methods to find the best intervention strategies, such as lock-downs with minimum economic impact [16, 17]. Further, they can be used to explore
the feasibility of model-based real-time control of the pandemic [18, 19]. However, using calibrated models with
non-identifiability or non-observability issues can result in bad or even dangerous intervention and control strategies.
It is common to distinguish between structural and practical identifiability. Structural non-identifiability may be
due to the model and measurement (input-output) structure. Practical non-identifiability is due to lack of information
in the considered data-sets. Non-identifiability results in incorrect parameter estimates and bad uncertainty quantification [14, 20], i.e. a misleading calibrated model which should not be used to analyze epidemiological data, test
hypothesis, or design interventions. The structural identifiability of several epidemic mechanistic models has been
studied e.g. in [21–26]. Other recent studies have mostly focused on practical identifiability, such as [14, 20, 27–29].
In this paper we assess the structural identifiability and observability of a large set of COVID-19 mechanistic models described by deterministic ordinary differential equations, derived by different authors using the compartmental
modeling framework [30]. Compartmental models are widely used in epidemiology because they are tractable and
powerful despite their simplicity. We collect 36 different compartmental models, of which we consider several variations, making up a total of 255 different model versions. Our aim is to characterize their ability to provide insights
about their unknown parameters – i.e. their structural identifiability – and unmeasured states – i.e. their observability.
To this end we adopt a differential geometry approach that considers structural identifiability as a particular case of
nonlinear observability, allowing to analyse both properties jointly. We define the relevant concepts and describe the
methods used in Section 2. Then we provide an overview of the different types of compartmental models found in the
literature in Section 3. We analyse their structural identifiability and observability and discuss the results in Section
4, where we also show different ways of remedying lack of observability using an illustrative model. Finally, we
conclude our study with some key remarks in Section 5.
2. Methods
2.1. Notation, models, and properties
We consider models defined by systems of ordinary differential equations with the following notation:
(
M=

ẋ(t) = f (x(t), θ, u(t), w(t))
y(t) = h (x(t), θ, u(t), w(t))

(1)
(2)

where f and h are analytical (generally nonlinear) functions of the states x(t) ∈ Rnx , known inputs u(t) ∈ Rnu ,
unknown constant parameters θ ∈ Rnθ , and unknown inputs or time-varying parameters w(t) ∈ Rnw . The output
y(t) ∈ Rny represents the measurable functions of model variables. The expressions (1–2) are sufficiently general to
represent a wide range of model structures, of which compartmental models are a particular case.
2

Definition 1 (Structurally locally identifiable [31]). A parameter θi of model M is structurally locally identifiable
(s.l.i.) if for almost any parameter vector θ∗ ∈ Rnθ there is a neighbourhood N(θ∗ ) in which the following relationship
holds:
θ̂ ∈ N(θ∗ ) and y(t, θ̂) = y(t, θ∗ ) ⇒ θ̂i = θi∗
(3)
Otherwise, θi is structurally unidentifiable (s.u.). If all model parameters are s.l.i. the model is s.l.i. If there is at least
one s.u. parameter, the model is s.u..
Likewise, a state xi (τ) is observable if it can be distinguished from any other states in a neighbourhood from
observations of the model output y(t) and input u(t) in the interval t0 ≤ τ ≤ t ≤ t f , for a finite t f . Otherwise, xi (τ)
is unobservable. A model is called observable if all its states are observable. We also say that M is invertible if it is
possible to infer its unknown inputs w(t), and we say that w(t) is reconstructible in this case.
Structural identifiability can be seen as a particular case of observability [32–34], by augmenting the state vector
with the unknown parameters θ, which are now considered as state variables with zero dynamics, e
x = (xT , θT )T . The
reconstructibility of unknown inputs w(t), which is also known as input observability, can also be cast in a similar
way, although in this case their derivatives may be nonzero. To this end, let us augment the state vector further with w
as additional states, as well as their derivatives up to some non-negative integer l:

Remark 1 (Unknown inputs, disturbances, or time-varying parameters). In Section 4, when reporting the results of
the structural identifiability and observability analyses, we will explicitly consider some parameters as time-varying.
In the model structure defined in equations (1–2) the unknown parameter vector θ is assumed to be constant. To
consider an unknown parameter as time-varying we include it in the “unknown input” vector w(t). Thus, changing
the consideration of a parameter from constant to time-varying entails removing it from θ and including it in w(t). The
elements of w(t) can be interpreted as unmeasured disturbances or inputs of unknown magnitude or, equivalently, as
time-varying parameters. Regardless of the interpretation, they are assumed to change smoothly, i.e. they are infinitely
differentiable functions of time. For the analysis of some models it is necessary, or at least convenient, to introduce
the mild assumption that the derivatives of w(t) vanish for a certain non-negative integer s (possibly s = +∞), i.e.
w s) (t) , 0 and w i) (t) = 0 for all i > s. This assumption is equivalent to assuming that the disturbances are polynomial
functions of time, with maximum degree equal to s [35].
Definition 2 (Full Input-State-Parameter Observability, FISPO [35]). Let us consider a model M given by (1–2). We

T
augment its state vector as z(t) = x(t)T θT w(t)T (4), which leads to its augmented form (5). We say that M has
the FISPO
if, for every t0 ∈ I, every model unknown zi (t0 ) can be inferred from y(t) and u(t) in a finite time
h property
i
interval t0 , t f ⊂ I. Thus, M is FISPO if, for every z(t0 ) and for almost any vector z∗ (t0 ), there is a neighbourhood
N (z∗ (t0 )) such that, for all ẑ(t0 ) ∈ N (z∗ (t0 )) , the following property is fulfilled:
y (t, ẑ(t0 )) = y (t, z∗ (t0 )) ⇒ ẑi (t0 ) = z∗i (t0 ) ,

1 ≤ i ≤ n x + nθ + nw .

2.2. Structural identifiability and observability analysis
In this paper we analyse input, state, and parameter observability – that is, the FISPO property defined above –
using a differential geometry framework. Such analyses are structural and local. By structural we refer to properties
that are entirely determined by the model equations; thus we do not consider possible deficiencies due to insufficient or
3

noise-corrupted data. By local we refer to the ability to distinguish between neighbouring states (similarly, parameters
or unmeasured inputs), even though they may not be distinguishable from other distant states. This is usually sufficient,
since in most (although not all, see e.g. [36]) applications local observability entails global observability. This specific
type of observability has sometimes been called local weak observability [37].
This approach assesses structural identifiability and observability by calculating the rank of a matrix that is constructed with Lie derivatives. The corresponding definitions are as follows (in the remainder of this section we omit
the dependency on time to simplify the notation):
Definition 3 (Extended Lie derivative [38]). Consider the system M (1–2) with augmented state vector (4) and
augmented dynamics (5). Assuming that the inputs u are analytical functions, the extended Lie derivative of the
output along f˜ = f˜ (·, u) is:
Lhf˜ ( x̃, u) =

∂h
∂h
( x̃, u) f˜ ( x̃, u) +
( x̃, u) u̇.
∂ x̃
∂u

The zero-order derivative is L0f˜h = h, and the i−order extended Lie derivatives can be recursively calculated as:
Lif˜h ( x̃, u)

=

∂Li−1

f˜
∂ x̃

( x̃, u) f˜ ( x̃, u) +

i−1 ∂Li−1 h
X
f˜
j=0

∂u j)

( x̃, u) u j+1) ,

i ≥ 1.

Definition 4 (Observability-identifiability matrix [35]). The observability-identifiability matrix of the system M (1–2)
with augmented state vector (4), augmented dynamics (5), and analytical inputs u is the following mn x̃ × n x̃ matrix,
OI ( x̃, u) =

∂  0
L h ( x̃, u)T
∂ x̃ f˜

L f˜h ( x̃, u)T

L2f˜h ( x̃, u)T

...

Lnf˜x̃ −1 h ( x̃, u)T

T

,

(6)

The FISPO property of M can be analysed by calculating the rank of the observability-identifiability matrix:
Theorem 1 (Observability-identifiability condition, OIC [38]). If the identifiability-observability matrix of a model
M satisfies rank (OI ( x̃0 , u)) = n x̃ = n x + nθ + nw , with x̃0 being a (possibly generic) point in the augmented state space,
then the system is structurally locally observable and structurally locally identifiable.
2.2.1. Analysis tools
In this paper we generally check the OIC criterion of (1) using STRIKE-GOLDD, an open source MATLAB
toolbox [39]. Alternatively, for some models we use the Maple code ObservabilityTest, which implements a procedure
that avoids the symbolic calculation of the Lie derivatives and is hence computationally efficient [33]. A number of
other software tools are available, including GenSSI2 [40] in MATLAB, IdentifiabilityAnalysis in Mathematica [38],
DAISY in REDUCE [41], SIAN in Maple [42], and the web app COMBOS [43]. It should be taken into account that
in the present work we are interested in assessing structural identifiability and observability both with constant and
continuous time-varying model parameters (or equivalently, with unknown inputs), as explained in Remark 1. Ideally,
the method of choice should provide a convenient way of analysing models with this type of parameters (inputs). It
is always possible to perform this type of analysis by assuming that the time dependency of the parameters is of a
particular form, e.g. a polynomial function of a certain maximum degree.
3. Models
In this article we review compartmental models, which are one of the most widely used families of models in
epidemiology. They divide the population into homogeneous compartments, each of which corresponds to a state
variable that quantifies the number of individuals that are at a certain disease stage. The dynamics of these compartments are governed by ordinary differential equations, usually with unknown parameters that describe the rates at
which individuals move among different stages of disease.
The basic compartmental model used for describing a transmission disease is the SIR model, in which the population is divided into three classes:
4

• Susceptible: individuals who have no immunity and may become infected if exposed.
• Infected and infectious: an exposed individual becomes infected after contracting the disease. Since an infected
individual has the ability to transmit the disease, he/she is also infectious.
• Recovered: individuals who are immune to the disease and do not affect its transmission.
Another class of models, called SEIR, include an additional compartment to account for the existence of a latent
period after the transmission:
• Exposed: individuals vulnerable to contracting the disease when they come into contact with it.
These idealized models differ from the reality. Contact tracing, screening, or changes in habits are some differences that are not considered in basic SIR or SEIR models, but are important for evaluating the effects of an
intervention. Furthermore, it is not only important to enrich the information about the behaviour of the population;
the characteristics of the disease must also be taken into account. These additional details can be incorporated to
the model as new parameters, functions, or extra compartments. Compartments such as asymptomatic, quarantined,
isolated, and hospitalized have been widely used in COVID-19 models. From 29 articles, most of which are very
recent [10, 15, 44–65], we have collected 36 models. Depending on whether they have an exposed compartment or
not, they can be broadly classified as belonging to the SIR or SEIR families. However, most of these models include
additional compartments.
3.1. SIR models
Susceptible individuals become infected with an incidence of:
−βS I
where β = pc is the transmission rate, c is the contact rate and p the probability that a contact with a susceptible
individual results in a transmission [6]. Individuals who recover leave the infectious class at rate γ, where 1/γ is the
average infectious period. The set of differential equations describing the basic SIR model is given by:
Ṡ (t) = −βS (t)I(t)
˙ = βS (t)I(t) − γR(t)
I(t)

(7)

Ṙ(t) = γR(t)
As mentioned above, compartmental models can be extended to consider further details. We have found models
that incorporate the following features: asymptomatic individuals, births and deaths, delay-time, lock-down, quarantine, isolation, social distancing, and screening. Figure 1 shows a classification of the SIR models reviewed in this
article, and Table 1 lists them along with their equations. Multiple output choices have been considered in the study of
the structural identifiability and observability of some models. In such cases the observations are listed in the Output
column.

Table 1: List of SIR models and their main features

3.2. SEIR models
Individuals in the SEIR model are divided in four compartments: Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Infected (I) and
Recovered (R). Compared to the SIR models, the additional compartment E allows for a more accurate description
of diseases in which the incubation period and the latent period do not coincide, i.e. the period between which an
infected becomes infectious. This is why SEIR models are in principle best suited to epidemics with a long incubation
period such as COVID-19 [50].
Susceptible individuals move to the exposed class at a rate βI(t), where β is the transmission rate parameter.
Exposed individuals become infected at rate κ, where 1/κ is the average latent period. Infected individuals recover at
rate γ, where 1/γ is the average infectious period.
Thus, the set of differential equations describing the basic SEIR model is:
Ṡ (t) = −βS (t)I(t)
Ė(t) = βS (t)I(t) − κE
˙ = kE − γR(t)
I(t)

(8)

Ṙ(t) = γR(t)
Existing extensions of SEIR models may incorporate some of the following features: asymptomatic individuals,
births and deaths, hospitalization, quarantine, isolation, social distancing, screening and lock-down. Figure 2 shows a
classification of the models found in the literature; Table 2 lists them along with their equations.

Table 2: List of SEIR models and their main features

4. Results and Discussion
We analysed the structural identifiability and observability of the 17 SIR model structures (a total of 98 model
versions considering the different output configurations and time-varying parameter assumptions) and 19 SEIR models
(with a total of 157 model versions) listed in Tables 1 and 2. The detailed results for each model are given in Appendix
A, which reports the structural identifiability of each parameter and the observability of each state, for every model
version. In the remainder of this section we provide an overview of the main results.
4.1. General patterns
The general patterns regarding state observability are as follows. The recovered state (R) is almost never observable unless it is directly measured (D.M.) as output; the only exceptions are two SEIR models, 31 and 38, for which
R is observable under the assumption of time-varying parameters. The susceptible state (S), in contrast, is observable
in roughly two thirds of the models (SIR: 65/98, SEIR: 103/157); this is also true for the exposed state (E) in the
SEIR models. The infected state (I) is included in most studies among the outputs, either directly (D.M.) or indirectly
measured (as part of a parameterized measurement function). When it is not considered in this way, its observability
is generally similar to that of S (in 18/157 model versions I is not an output and it is observable in 13/18).
12

The transmission and recovery rates (β, γ) are the two parameters common to all SIR models. The transmission
rate is identifiable in 59/98 model versions, and γ in 51/98 and its derivatives in 12/98. SEIR models have a third
parameter in common, the latent period (κ). It is identifiable in most of the models (145/157), as well as the recovery
rate (111/157). The transmission rate is identifiable in 101/157 model versions, but it is not identifiable in any SEIR
model version that accounts for social distancing (numbers 34 and 61); we found no clear pattern in the other models.
4.2. The effect of time-varying parameters
The transmission rate β, the recovery rate γ, and in SEIR models the latent period κ, can vary during an epidemic
as a result of changes in the population’s behaviour [57, 70], the introduction of new drugs or new medical equipment
[57], or the reduction of the period duration as a result of high temperatures [71]. To account for such variations, the
present study has considered both the constant and the time-varying cases, by including the corresponding variables
either in the constant parameter vector θ or in the unknown input vector w(t), respectively, as described in Remark 1.
Changing a parameter from constant to time-varying naturally influences structural identifiability and observability.
This effect is graphically summarized in Figures 3-7, which represent classes of models in tree form and classify them
according to their observability. Each model is shaded with a color, according to the observability of the parameter
studied. Some models include different rates for different population groups: for example, they may consider two
different transmission rates for symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. For those models, each rate may have different observability properties when considered time-varying parameters; in such cases the model is depicted between
two color blocks (see for example the SIR 20 model in Figure 3).
Changing β from a constant to a time-varying parameter (or equivalently an unknown input) does not change its
observability nor that of the other variables in SIR models. In contrast, this is not the case with the recovery rate
γ, for which a somewhat counter-intuitive result may be obtained: by changing γ from a constant to a continuous
function of time with at least a non-zero derivative, its model can become more observable and identifiable – despite
the fact that it is an unknown function. An example of this is the SIR model 15: if γ is constant the model has only
one identifiable parameter, τ, and no observable states; if γ is time-varying with at least one non-zero derivative, two
parameters become identifiable (β, µ), two states become observable (I, S), and γ itself is observable. In the other
models, when γ is not identifiable as a constant nor observable as an unknown input, its successive derivatives are
observable.

13

Figure 4: Observability of γ (recovery rate) in SIR models. Models in which γ is observable are shown in green. Models in which it is unobservable
if constant and observable if time-varying are shown in a green-red gradient. Finally, models in which only its time-derivatives are observable are
shown in orange.

For the SEIR models, the consideration of the β parameter as an unknown input function follows a similar trend to
that of the SIR models with the exception of model 38, which gains both observability and identifiability and becomes
FISPO. Considering the recovery rate γ (Fig. 7) or the latent period κ (Fig. 6) individually as time-varying parameters
generally leads to greater observability, except for model 31(1). As an example, in model 39(2) one of the unknown
inputs becomes observable, three states become observable (S, E, I), and three parameters become identifiable (γ, µi ,
β); or the 16(2) model, in which both its input and three states (S, E, I) become observable and two parameters (µ, β)
become identifiable.
Besides the transmission rate, latent period, and recovery rate, other rates (screening, disease-related deaths, and
isolation) have also been considered as time-varying parameters in some studies. The observability of most models is
not modified if these parameters are allowed to change in time; the exception being 8 models which gain observability.
An example is the SEIR model 41(1), which has seven parameters, seven states, and one output. Assuming constant
parameters, five of them are structurally identifiable (κ, α, β, γ1 , γ2 ) and two are unidentifiable (q, ρ), while there
are three observable states (I, J, C) and four unobservable states (S, E, A, R) [28]. However, when the parameter ρ
(which describes the proportion of exposed/latent individuals who become clinically infectious) is considered timevarying, all parameters become identifiable (including ρ) and six states become observable (all except R, which is
never observable unless it can be directly measured, as we have already mentioned).
The fact that allowing an unknown quantity to change in time can improve its observability – and also the observability of other variables in a model – may seem paradoxical. An intuitive explanation can be obtained from the study
of the symmetry in the model structure. The existence of Lie symmetries amounts to the possibility of transforming
parameters and state variables while leaving the output unchanged, i.e. their existence amounts to lack of structural
identifiability and/or observability [72]. The STRIKE-GOLDD toolbox used in this paper includes procedures for
finding Lie symmetries [73]. Let us use the SIR 15 model as an example. This model has five parameters (τ, β, ρ, µ,
d), of which only τ is identifiable if assumed constant. The model contains the following symmetry:
µ∗ = µ + ρ,
where  is the parameter of the Lie group of transformations. Thus, there is a symmetry between ρ and µ that makes
them unidentifiable: changes in one parameter can be compensated by changes in the other one. However, if ρ is
time-varying and µ is constant, the latter cannot compensate the changes of the former, and the symmetry is broken.
14

Indeed, if ρ is considered time-varying the model gains identifiability (not only µ, but also τ and β become identifiable)
and observability (S, I and ρ become observable).

time-derivatives are observable are shown in orange.

4.3. Applying the results in practice: an illustrative example
Let us now illustrate how the results of this study may be applied in a realistic scenario. We use as an example
the model SIR 26, which has 6 states (S, I, R, A, Q, J) and 16 parameters (d1 , d2 , d3 , d4 , d5 , d6 , k1 , k2 , λ, γ1 , γ2 ,
a , q ,  j , µ1 , µ2 ); its equations are shown in Table 1. This model includes the following additional features with
respect to the basic SIR model: birth/death, asymptomatic individuals (A), quarantine (Q), and isolation (J). In its
original publication two states were measured (Q, J). With these two states as outputs the model has five identifiable
parameters (d1 , d5 , q , k2 , µ1 ) and two observable states (A, I); thus, there are two unobservable states (S, R) and ten
unidentifiable parameters.
If we are interested in estimating e.g. the number of susceptible individuals (S), this model would not be appropriate. How should we proceed in that scenario?
One way of improving observability could be by including more outputs (option 1). For example, since there is a
separate class for asymptomatic individuals (A), the infected compartment (I) considers only individuals with symptoms, and we could assume that they can be detected. By including ‘I’ in the output set, the structural identifiability
and observability of the model improves: six more parameters are identifiable (λ, a ,  j , d4 , k1 , µ2 ) and the state in
which we are interested (S) becomes observable.
However, including more outputs is not always realistic. Another possibility would then be to reduce the complexity of the model by decreasing the number of additional features (option 2). For example, leaving out the asymptomatic compartment leads to the following model:
S ˙(t) = bN − S (Iλ + λq Q + λ j J + d1 )
˙ = S (Iλ + λq Q + λ j J) − (γ1 + µ1 + µ2 + d2 )I
I(t)
˙ = γ1 I + γ2 J − d3 R
R(t)
˙ = µ1 I − (k2 + d5 )Q
Q(t)
˙ = k2 Q + µ2 I − (γ2 + d6 )J
J(t)
The output of the model is the same, Q, J. In this case, the model has eight identifiable parameters (λ, q ,  j , d1 , d5 ,
µ1 , µ2 , k2 ) and two observable states (S, I).
16

A third possibility is to simplify the parametrization of the model (option 3). This model considers a different
death rate for every compartment (di , i = 1, . . . , 6.). With some loss of generality, we could consider a specific death
rate for infected individuals, dI = d2 , and a general death rate d for all non-infected and asymptomatic individuals,
d = d1 = d3 = d4 = d5 = d6 . This reduction of the number of parameters leads to a better observability to the model:
the only unidentifiable parameters are d2 , γ1 , and k1 , and the only non-observable state is R. Thus, this option also
allows to identify S.
5. Conclusions
Our analyses have shown that a fraction of the models found in the literature have unidentifiable parameters. Key
parameters such as the transmission rate (β), the recovery rate (γ), and the latent period (κ) are structurally identifiable
in most, but not all, models. The transmission and recovery rates are identifiable in roughly two thirds of the models,
and the latent period in almost all (> 90%) of them. Likewise, the states corresponding to the number of susceptible
(S) and exposed (E) individuals are non-observable in roughly one third of the model versions analysed in this paper.
The number of infected individuals (I) can usually be directly measured, but it is non-observable in one third of the
model versions in which it is not measured. The situation is worse for the number of recovered individuals (R), which
is almost never observable unless it is directly measured. Many models include other states in addition to S, E, I, and
R, which are not always observable either.
The transmission rate and other parameters may vary during the course of an epidemic, as a result of a number
of factors such as changes in public policy, population behaviour, or environmental conditions. To account for these
variations, in the present study we have considered both the constant and the time-varying parameter case. Somewhat
unexpectedly, we found that allowing for variability in an unknown parameter often improves the observability and/or
identifiability of the model. This phenomenon might be explained by the contribution of this variability to the removal
of symmetries in the model structure.
Structural identifiability and observability depend on which states or functions are measured. The lack of these
properties may in principle be surmounted by choosing the right set of outputs [74], but the required measurements
are not always possible to perform in practice. Epidemiological models are a clear example of this; limitations such
as lack of testing or the existence of asymptomatic individuals usually make it impossible to have measurements
of all states. An alternative to measuring more states is to use a model with fewer compartments and/or a simpler
parameterization, thus decreasing the number of states and/or parameters. Reducing the model dimension in this way
may achieve observability and identifiability.
Even when it is not possible (or practical) to avoid non-observability or non-identifiability by any means, the model
may still be useful, as long as it is only used to infer its observable states or identifiable parameters. For example, we
may be interested in determining the transmission rate β but not the number of recovered individuals R; in such case
it is fine to use a model in which β is identifiable even if R is not observable. Of course, this means that, to ensure
that a model is properly used, it is necessary to characterize its identifiability and observability in detail, to know if
the quantity of interest is observable/identifiable.
The contribution of this work has been to provide such a detailed analysis of the structural identifiability and
observability of a large set of compartmental models of COVID-19 presented in the recent literature. The results of
our analyses can be used to avoid the pitfalls caused by non-identifiability and non-observability. By classifying the
existing models according to these properties, and arranging them in a structured way as a function of the compartments that they include, our study has answered the following question: given the sets of existing models and available
measurements, which model is appropriate for inferring the value of some particular parameters, and/or to predict the
time course of the states of interest?

Appendix A. Detailed structural identifiability and observability results
The tables included in the following pages report the results of the observability and structural identifiability
analyses of all the model variants considered in this paper. Each block of rows represents one of the following
assumptions:
• All parameters considered constant (i.e. as is usually the case in the original publications).
• Transmission rate β considered time-varying.
• Latent period κ considered time-varying (only in SEIR models; SIR models do not have this parameter).
• Recovery rate γ considered time-varying.
• All parameters considered time-varying.
Within each block, each row provides detailed information about identifiable and non-identifiable parameters, observable and non-observable states, directly measured (D.M.) states, observable and unobservable unknown inputs (and
time-varying parameters), known inputs, and number of derivatives of the unknown inputs (and time-varying parameters) assumed to be non-zero (nnDerW). The suffix d number represents the nth derivative of an unknown function
(e.g. β d1 is the first derivative of the time-varying parameter β).
The blank blocks in the tables of the SEIR models numbers 38 and 8 indicate that the corresponding time-varying
case is already considered in the original formulation of the model. The SIR models 29 and 30 have only been studied
in their original form, i.e. without considering time-varying parameters, because these models do not contain the
common parameters of the SIR models; instead they use the R0 constant.
