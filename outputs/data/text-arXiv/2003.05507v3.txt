Abstract
Current CoVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly worldwide, and it may become one of
the largest pandemic events in modern history if out of control. It appears most of the SARS-CoV2 virus infection resulted deaths are mainly due to dysfunctions or failures of the lung or multiple
organs that could be attributed to host‚Äôs immunodysfunctions particularly hyperinflammatory type
disorders. In this brief review and study, a math model is proposed to correlate the Pathogen
Infection Recovery Probability (PIRP) versus Proinflammatory Anti-Pathogen Species (PIAPS)
levels within a host unit, where a maximum PIRP is exhibited when the PIAPS levels are equal to
or around PIAPS equilibrium levels at the pathogen elimination or clearance onset. Based on this
model, rational or effective therapeutic strategies at right stages or timing, with right type of agents
(immuno-stimulators or immuno-suppressors), and right dosages, may be designed and
implemented that are expected to effectively achieve maximum PIRP or reduce the mortality.

Current COVID-19 pandemic due to SARS-CoV-2 viruses have already spread around the
globe and have resulted in over thirty thousand human deaths with twenty times more confirmed
infections [1-2]. In addition to loss of human life, social and economic losses or effects could be
significant. A number of earlier global pandemics occurred in human history can be attributed to
pathogen infections [3]. Though there are differences among different pathogen induced
infections, there were certain similarities among all pathogen infections. The pathogens here
mainly refer to biological microorganisms such as viruses (including the new SARS-CoV-2 virus)
and bacteria that can self-replicate in a biological host and can trigger or initiate a host immune
system responses resulting in the production (clonal expansion) of anti-pathogen species (APS),
including a series of proinflammatory anti-pathogen species (PIAPS). PIAPS here mainly refer to
‚Äúdouble-edged sword‚Äù species such as certain white blood cells (WBCs) or their generated/related
species, such as oxidative radical species and antibodies [4-6], cytokines [7-12, 18-20], etc.
‚ÄúDouble-edged sword‚Äù refers to certain PIAPS that not only attack the pathogens but also attack
host normal cells and tissues [4-12, 18-20].
Pathogen infection modeling could be very useful for understanding the infection
mechanisms and processes, and for preventive or therapeutic strategies. However, most of the
existing modeling works are mainly focusing on multiple host infection and transmittance statistics
over time domain [13-17], very few modeling work provide insights on pathogen infection
recovery probability (PIRP) over anti-pathogens species (APS), particularly over proinflammatory
anti-pathogen species (PIAPS) that is the focus of this study.
A pathogen infection in a host may result in pathogen un-controlled growth if the host
immune system is too weak, deficient, or dysregulated (including immunoparalysis and a serious
immune deficiency syndromes) that could result in sepsis or septic shocks [20]. In a host with
normal immune response system, as illustrated in Figure 1, the pathogen infection at time t0 (end
of incubation period) typically trigger a normal and efficient growth (clonal expansion) of immune
system generated anti-pathogen species (APS at an initial level x0) and ideally shall result in
pathogen being eliminated/cleared at te [13]. Once the pathogen is eliminated by the APS at te, the
APS (including PIAPS) growth are expected to cease and remain at their equilibrium levels xe.
Certain APS (such as certain pathogen specific antibodies) are expected to remain at their
equilibrium levels for certain period of time so the same pathogen infection can be prevented or
inhibited (principle of vaccination), though antibody equilibrium level slow decay in long period
of time are normal or expected [13-17].

generated anti-pathogen species (APS), including proinflammatory anti-pathogen species
(PIAPS), for normal (solid blue curve) and abnormal (long dashed blue line, reflecting
hyperinflammatory disorder) immune response reactions over time.
However, in certain immunodysfunction disorders, particularly certain hyperinflammatory
disorders, such as cytokine release syndromes (CRS) or cytokine storm (CS) [4-12], macrophage
activation syndromes (MAS) or macrophage-cytokine self-amplifying loop (MCSAL) [11], WBS
proliferative disorders [4], certain PIAPS can grow out of control or not being efficiently
dampened by the host anti-inflammatory species (e.g., IL-10) even after te where the pathogen may
have been eliminated. It has been known that a number of PIAPS attack or damage normal or
healthy cells resulting in tissue death (gangrene) and multiple organ dysfunctions or failures [2, 412, 18-20]. For this reason and for potential and practical therapeutic strategies, a Gaussian bell
shaped normal distribution function Y is proposed here to model the Pathogen Infection Recovery
Probability (PIRP, or the survivability, counter to the mortality) versus the PIAPS levels x (shown
in Figure 2) and is exhibited with equation (1):
ùíÄ = ùú∑ ùíÜùíôùíë[-(x-xe)2/Œ±]

(1)

where Œ± parameter is proportional to the PIRP distribution peak full width at half maximum
(FWHM) that affects the PIAPS level range width around PIRP maximum. During this range,
PIAPS levels can significantly elevate PIRP as compared to other PIAPS range where PIRP
remains relatively low. Œ≤ parameter represents a coupling factor of PIRP versus PIAPS levels,
reflecting how significant or effective PIAPS level affects PIRP.

Figure 2. Scheme of Pathogen Infection Recovery Probability (PIRP) versus certain
Proinflammatory Anti-Pathogen Species (PIAPS) levels based on equation 1.
Based on this model, the PIRP-PIAPS curve are divided into two stages: 1) Stage I or the
PIRP rising stage corresponds to pathogen/APS evolution time period between t0 to te as shown in
Figure 1: The PIRP of the pathogen infected host starts to rise as the host normal immune response
generated APS (including PIAPS) are growing efficiently from initial levels of x0 (x0 can be zero
for pathogen specific APS) and eventually approaching and maintaining at their equilibrium levels
xe (blue solid line) where the pathogens are being eliminated or cleared. 2) Stage II or the PIRP
descending stage: The PIAPS level further grow beyond their equilibrium levels xe as represented
by the long dashed blue line (representing immunodysregulation such as hyperinflammatory
disorders) [2, 4-12, 18-20], the PIRP descends presumably due to excessive PIAPS start to damage
the normal or healthy tissues or organs. Eventually the PIRP could descend to a very low level
due to heavy damages of tissues (particularly lung tissues) that could result in multiple organ
failures [2, 7-12, 18-20].
Based on this model, the general therapeutic strategies for minimizing mortality is to
achieve and/or to sustain maximum PIRP via a two-stage protocol as following: 1) In the stage I
or the PIRP rising stage between t0 and te, if the host has a normal immune response to the pathogen
infection, the host‚Äôs APS/PIAPS should grow efficiently toward their equilibrium (or saturation)
levels xe where the pathogens are being eliminated or cleared. In this situation and stage, viral
targeted therapies appear unnecessary except supportive therapies are needed for the following
situations: a) If the host exhibits breath difficulty (dyspnea) or low blood oxygen level due to the
liquids/mucous in the lungs (lung infections), then mechanical respiration ventilators and/or
oxygen therapy may be utilized to prevent potential oxygen deficiency syndromes and related
complications (hypoxemia and hypoxia); b) If the pathogen growth is out of control (such as in the
cases of the host‚Äôs certain immune deficiency syndromes), than either pathogen
inhibitors/suppressors (if available) or APS boosters/enhancers (immuno-stimulators, including
certain WBC therapies, antibody/immunoglobin therapies, interferon therapies, as well as
therapies utilizing plasma and antibodies obtained from the convalescent patients) may be
administered to minimize potential viral damage resulted complications, but the immuno-

4

Pre-print/(DOI:10.21203/rs.3.rs-17318/v1)/(033120/v5)

stimulations must be administered at the right time (in stage I before te), right type (APS/PIAPS
boosters/enhancers instead of inhibitors/suppressors), and at the right dosages (i.e., APS/PIAPS
levels should be carefully monitored and controlled to be equal or close to their equilibrium or
saturation levels xe). 2) In the stage II or the PIRP descending stage after te, when the PIAPS levels
are excessive or their growth are out of control (dysregulated), the most critical or essential
therapeutic task in the post te period or stage II shall be to promptly terminate or suppress the
further growth of the PIAPS levels (immuno-suppressing, a variety of anti-inflammatory methods
may be tested) at or nearby their equilibrium levels xe, while pathogen inhibitors/suppressors may
not be necessary at this time if the pathogens are eliminated. In case where the coupling of the
host generated APS to the pathogen is very poor, i.e., hyper-inflammation or cytokine storm has
occurred and the pathogen level is still high, pathogen suppressors/inhibitors (if available), antiinflammatory or non-inflammatory APS, as well as PIAPS suppressors may all be administered at
this situation and in this stage but with carefully controlled dosages. Certain host immune system
generated anti-inflammatory species (AIS, such as IL-10) may grow in order to counter the
inflammation, but such anti-inflammatory response could be too slow and may eventually reduce
the host PIAPS levels well below the equilibrium levels and may result the host to
immunoparalysis [20]. A number of therapeutic PIAPS control (immunomodulation) efforts have
been reported in recent years [4-12], however, the timing, type, and dosages of PIAPS
suppressors/antagonists must be carefully monitored and controlled and this appears has not yet
done, as PIAPS over-suppression or at wrong stage could result in delayed or incomplete pathogen
elimination as well as vulnerability of host re-infection or secondary infections and related
complications [20]. Finally, since the host‚Äôs mental/psychological status or modes (fear including
claustrophobia, anxiety, distress, depression, etc.) could trigger host‚Äôs catecholamine/adrenaline
production which in turn could boost APS/PIAPS levels, macrophage-cytokine self-amplifying
loop MCSAL [11], and inflammations [21], and may result in mode-inflammation self-amplifying
loop (MISAL), psychological counselling to the host thus also appear very important to improve
host‚Äôs PIRP. Precise, fast, convenient, and reliable protocols of measuring and monitoring
pathogen and key ‚ÄúDouble-edged sword‚Äù PIAPS levels are essential not only to validate this
model, but to eventually utilize this model and its generated protocols for safe and effective
therapeutic treatments of the infected hosts. Both pathogen and key PIAPS should be targeted as
critical biomarkers ASAP.
As an example, in the case of COVID-19, while there appears lack of evidences of organ
damages due to virus [22], excess levels or presences of macrophages, neutrophils, and
inflammatory cytokines (such as Interleukin-6) were observed in multiple damaged organs in the
autopsies and biopsies of the SARS-CoV-2 virus infected hosts [18]. Though APS/PIAPS boosters
(such as interferon INF-alpha, gamma immunoglobulin, convalescent plasma collected from
recovered patients) were recommended for COVID-19 infection treatments [18], based on this
model, such treatments may best be used only for those hosts with deficient or very weak immune
responses and should be administered in stage I. PIAPS suppression via a series of inflammation
antagonists, or cytokine elimination via blood purification [18] appear useful for controlling CRS
but they should be done after te in the stage II, the PIAPS level control are extremely critical. Most
importantly, the levels of SARS-coV-2 and key PIAPS levels (particularly IL-6, macrophages,
neutrophils) at appropriate time intervals need to be measured and monitored precisely and closely
in order to monitor and determine the virus growth, virus elimination onset time te and the
corresponding PIAPS equilibrium levels xe. For COVID-19 infection, it appears many host‚Äôs
antibody lgG equilibrium level xe is about four times of its initial level x0 [18]. An approach on

5

Pre-print/(DOI:10.21203/rs.3.rs-17318/v1)/(033120/v5)

controlling dysregulated interferon INF-I production in COVID-19 infection [19] appears
potentially useful for validating or utilizing this model, again the interferon INF-I level control
should be done after te and the level should not be over suppressed well below xe. Another example
where this two-stage model might be applicable is the application of certain anti-oxidants
(assuming Vitamins-C/E have such functions), where the anti-oxidant or radical scavengers appear
needed only during stage II, this is because pathogen supressing oxidative radicals are actually
needed in stage I. Finally, multiple host units may be utilized to obtain average values of all six
parameters of this model (t0,, x0, te, xe, Œ±, Œ≤) for a particular host group, and the average values may
be useful for therapeutic treatments of an individual host that is same or similar to the members of
the group.
In summary, a bell shaped normal distribution function is proposed to model the Pathogen
Infection Recovery Probability (PIRP) versus Proinflammatory Anti-pathogen Species (PIAPS)
levels in a microorganism based pathogen infected host. Based on this model, therapeutic
strategies should be based on two stages: In the first stage, treatments may not be necessary for
most hosts with normal immune responses as PIRPs are expected to grow and remain at the
maximum due to APS/PIAPS growing to and remaining at the equilibrium levels xe for certain
periods, except supportive treatments are needed for oxygen deficiency syndromes. Hosts with
weak or deficient anti-pathogen immune responses may need either pathogen suppressors or
immuno-stimulators, however, timing, type, and dosages of both pathogen suppressors and
immuno-stimulators are critical. In the second or the PIRP descending stage II due to PIAPS
excessive or abnormal growth or levels, it is essential to control the PIAPS around their equilibrium
levels xe via immuno-suppressors or inflammation antagonists. If pathogen levels are still high in
stage II, then anti-inflammatory or non-inflammatory immuno-stimulators are desired. Again,
timing, types, and dosages of therapeutic treatments are extremely critical depending on the PIRP
stages and on pathogen/PIAPS levels. Precise and timely monitoring and controls of both
pathogen and PIAPS levels are essential in order to fully characterize and utilize this model.
Increased survivability or reduced mortality could be potential outcome if this or related models
are fully developed, well characterized, and implemented after carefully designed and controlled
clinical trials. For instance, for current COVID-19 infections, immunomodulation via timely and
precise monitoring and level controls of key biomarkers (including the virus, IL-6, macrophages
and/or neutrophils, oxidative radical species, IL-10, etc) appear essential to reduce the mortality.
