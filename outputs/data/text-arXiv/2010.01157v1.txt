Abstract
Pairs trading is a strategy based on exploiting mean reversion in prices of
securities. It has been shown to generate significant excess returns, but its
profitability has dropped significantly in recent periods. We employ the most
common distance and cointegration methods on US equities from 1990 to
2020 including the Covid-19 crisis. The strategy overall fails to outperform
the market benchmark even with hyperparameter tuning, but it performs
very strongly during bear markets. Furthermore, we demonstrate that market factors have a strong relationship with the optimal parametrization for
the strategy, and adjustments are appropriate for modern market conditions.

1. Introduction
We examine the distance and cointegration methods in pairs trading,
which is a mean-reversion contrarian trading strategy. It has been shown to
perform well in historical backtests, achieving up to 11% excess annualized
return for US stocks over 1962-1997 (Gatev et al., 1999). Its performance
has been significantly decreasing over time to the point where reasonable
transaction costs often almost eliminate excess returns in more recent work
(Do and Faff, 2010; Rad et al., 2015).
Nonetheless, the pairs trading strategy has been successful in a large
number of national markets and timeframes (Jacobs and Weber, 2015) despite its simplicity, performing best either in emerging markets or markets

with a large number of potential pairs. The source and determinants of pairs
trading profitability are not entirely clear, although the strategy has been
noted to be sensitive to parametrization and transaction costs in particular
(Huck, 2013; Do and Faff, 2012).
Pairs trading is a general framework and a great number of sophisticated approaches has been researched, including modeling the mean-reversion
as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process (Elliott et al., 2005), stochastic control
(Jurek and Yang, 2007), genetic algorithms (Huang et al., 2015) and copulas (Liew and Wu, 2013). An exhaustive survey of pairs trading methods
was recently developed by Krauss (2017). However, explicit comparisons between methods are scarce outside of the few most popular ones, and they
do not seem to have a clear winner even when performed (Rad et al., 2015;
Carrasco Blázquez et al., 2018).
This paper contributes in multiple areas. First, we conduct rigorous examination of the most common pairs trading methods with new trading data
up to 2020 including the Covid-19 crisis. Second, we investigate the validity
of several parameter choices ubiquitous across literature and demonstrate a
relationship between transaction costs, execution lag and optimal parameters. Our research can thus serve as a guide for future work on pairs trading.
2. Methodology
2.1. Data
We use daily data on US stocks traded on NYSE spanning from 1990/01/01
to 2020/06/01. We further divide the history into sub-periods roughly demarcated by the dot-com and 2008 crises. The subperiods allow us to study
the trading performance in bull and bear markets separately. In total, the
dataset contains roughly 2800 stocks. We further pre-process the dataset by
excluding bottom decile stocks in terms of liquidity, and removing any stocks
that were not traded during the formation period for at least one trading day.
Subperiod details can be found in Table 1.
2.2. Methods
Pairs trading proceeds in two stages, formation and trading. In the formation period, a statistical criterion is utilized to determine which pairs exhibit
a stable long-run relationship. A measure of spread between the prices of
securities making up the pair is defined, and its historical value is measured.

2

In the trading period, positions are opened when the spread gets far enough
from its estimated equilibrium.
Pairs trading methods differ in how they form pairs, the trading rules
used, or both. We apply the two most common pairs formation approaches,
the distance and cointegration methods, which were first investigated by
Gatev et al. (1999) and Vidyamurthy (2004), respectively.
The distance method proceeds by computing pairwise sums of squared
deviations between the two normalized logarithmic price series, which we
label as P here:
X
SSDij =
(Pit − Pjt )2
(1)
t

As suggested by Gatev et al. (1999), we then pick the top 20 pairs minimizing
this metric, indicating that their prices have evolved the most similarly. We
define the spread as
spreadijt = Pit − Pjt
(2)
In the trading period, we execute trades based on the spread’s value
normalized by the formation period. In particular, we short the spread when
its normalized value exceeds 2, and close the position once it crosses zero or
at the end of trading. We proceed analogically when it goes below -2. Such
thresholded trading rules are very common in pairs trading literature and
they directly replicate the setup from Gatev et al. (1999).
The cointegration method is similar conceptually. The Engle-Granger
cointegration test (Engle and Granger, 1987) is used to filter out cointegrated
pairs. The spread is defined to be the residual from the Engle-Granger cointegration regression. Trading then proceeds exactly the same as in the distance
method.
Again following Gatev et al. (1999), we also utilize a one-period trade
execution lag in order to estimate the bid-ask spread and other trade execution difficulties. We also employ a computationally efficient alternative to
the cointegration method inspired by Rad et al. (2015). We pre-determine
the desired number of pairs, sort all pairs by the sum of squared deviations
metric used in the distance method, and keep testing the most similar pairs
for cointegration only until we achieve the desired number of pairs.
2.3. Transaction costs
Transaction costs for US stocks in the pairs trading context were thoroughly examined by Do and Faff (2012) who split transaction costs among
3

commissions, market impact and short-selling costs. They all vary over time,
but they have generally been decreasing. We further extrapolate the provided
analysis and work with one-way transaction costs ranging from 35bps in 1990
to 26bps in 2020. Short-selling costs follow the work of D’Avolio (2002) who
found an average fee of 0.6% p.a. for US equities in 2000-2001, which we
apply over the whole period.
A summary of transaction costs is available in Table 1.

3. Results
In order to evaluate the viability of the pairs trading strategy, we conduct an extensive grid search across hyperparameters. We contrast them
with the basic parameters originally used by Gatev et al. (1999) which are
commonplace in pairs trading literature.
All the tried parameters are outlined below, and the most common standard values are highlighted in bold. All combinations of parameters were
backtested. Of particular note is the period length multiplier, which is a
scaling coefficient for the length of both the formation and trading periods.
Gatev et al. (1999) originally chose 12-months formation and 6-months trading, which here has coefficient 1, and a coefficient of 0.5 means 6-months
formation and 3-months trading, for example.
• # of nominated pairs - 5, 10, 20, 40
• trading trigger threshold - 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3
• period length multiplier - 0.16, 0.5, 1, 1.5
• conf. level of statistical tests (coint. method only) - 0.01, 0.05, 0.1

Table 3.1 shows an overview of all the main results. Returns utilizing
the baseline parameters are specified as ”base”, and we also provide the best
achievable returns in each subperiod based on our parameter search marked
as ”best”. ”Adaptive” and ”finetuned” are other series of returns described
in Section 3.2. The Total column refers to results computed over the whole
1990-2020 period.
3.1. Base scenarios
Results with the baseline parameter settings show that pairs trading generally fails to perform in both absolute and risk-adjusted terms when compared to the market benchmark. It does however perform remarkably well
during bear markets, producing excess returns on the order of 2% per month,
although it lags close to 1% behind the market in bull markets. This behavior is consistent across all the trading history from 1990 to 2020 including
the Covid-19 crisis. The risk-adjusted returns follow the same pattern as the
raw returns.
Overall, the consistent underperforming of the market during bull markets
leads to the base strategy producing less than 0.2% monthly returns over the
whole period in comparison to the market’s 0.47%. As such, it appears
that naive pairs trading is not viable unless we only utilize it during bear
markets. However, our subperiod separation utilizes significant foresight bias
in knowing the exact beginnings and ends of bear markets. In practice, it
is not trivial to determine when a bear market is taking place, which makes
well-timed application of pairs trading difficult.
3.2. Adaptive trading
In Table 3.1, we also show the maximum possible returns achievable
(marked as ”best”) in the given subperiod. Those returns use parameters
that can only be determined after the subperiod is over. We compare them
with a strategy that adapts the strategy parameters every two years to make
them optimal for the preceding two-year period, and then aggregate those
results to conform to the subperiods introduced in Section 2.1. The latter
strategy is actually executable because it requires no foresight bias, and is
denoted as ”adaptive”.
Nonetheless, the adaptive trading strategy performs worse than even the
baseline parameters. However, we see from the ”best” results that if we were
able to trade better in the trading period, the returns would significantly
improve, making the strategy perform well even during bull markets. The

cointegration method in particular appears to have a higher ceiling for performance since it can achieve up to 1.03% monthly profit over the whole
history as compared to the distance method’s 0.64%, which is only slightly
higher than the market’s overall monthly return of 0.47%.
Table 3.2 shows the averaged optimal parameters of top 3 parameter
settings for each period. The adaptive strategy essentially tries to exploit
momentum in parameter values, but that does not seem to be feasible. We
see that the parameters are fairly volatile over time, although there do appear
to be significant differences from the baseline parameters set by Gatev et al.
(1999).
We note that the optimal parameters vary quite strongly across different
subperiods, and the best parameters for the whole examination period are
not necessarily close to the average of subperiod optimal parameters as one
might expect. Additionally, the optimal parameters are not very stable even
when considered only across each of bull and bear market subperiods, further
indicating the difficulty of finding well-performing static trading rules.
Utilizing the optimal parameters for backtesting over the whole period
from Table 3.2, we construct another parametrization denoted as ”finetuned”

Table 3: Optimal parameters across pairs trading methods and timeframes

in Table 3.1. We still observe a significant gap between those and the maximum achievable returns when continually using the best parameters for each
subperiod. Therefore, even with significant foresight bias and actually knowing which static parameters would be the best over the whole period, the
returns still pale in comparison to dynamically chosen parameters. In fact,
completely static trading rules of any sort are not enough to outperform the
market benchmark since the distance and cointegration methods then only
achieve 0.23% and 0.26% monthly return, respectively.
3.3. Execution lag and transaction costs
Table 3.3 shows the optimal strategy parameters across a range of lags
and transaction costs. Each table entry is the average across all history of
the top 3 optimal parameter settings in each subperiod.
We observe that as the transaction costs rise, it becomes advantageous to
increase the threshold and period length. The number of pairs and confidence
level are however much less affected. Furthermore, increasing the lag from
zero to one sharply increases the optimal number of pairs, although the effect
on other parameters is fairly weak.
Overall, the results here can be seen as motivating for parameter choices.
Gatev et al. (1999) explicitly considered one-period execution lag and the
transaction costs at the time of his analysis were mostly even higher than
30bps. As Table 3.3 shows, the choice of 20 top pairs with 2 standard deviation threshold and period length multiplier of 1 are quite close to optimal for
the distance method under those conditions. However, it also seems that as
the transaction costs are getting lower in modern times and trade execution
difficulties, for which the execution lag is a proxy, are becoming less severe,

Table 4: Dependence of optimal parameters on transaction costs and execution lag

the standard pairs trading parameters need to be adjusted accordingly.
For example, given that market impact costs are a significant component
of transaction costs as discussed in Section 2.3 and further considering that
market impact costs are likely to scale with employed capital, we can hypothesize that different parametrization would be ideal contingent on how
much capital is available for trading. Since less capital implies lower market
impact, which in turn means lower total transaction costs, we would expect
lower thresholds and shorter trading/formation periods to perform better in
those conditions as per our discussion above.
4. Conclusion
We confirm that pairs trading does not have high excess returns in recent
times. We further corroborate the findings of Do and Faff (2010) that pairs
trading performs very strongly during financial crises including the Covid-19
crisis, but generally lags behind the market benchmark otherwise, both in
8

raw and risk-adjusted returns. This leads to overall weak performance.
However, it would seem that naive pairs trading is not entirely defunct
at least in the formation stage, as solid returns can be achieved with optimal
trading rules even when using basic formation strategies. The viability of
such simple pairs trading strategies is usually examined in the context of
thresholded trading rules which tend to be directly replicated from previous
work. However, we show that their optimal parametrization shows a strong
relationship with market conditions, and can thus be adapted to the market
at hand. While the baseline parameters were close to optimal in the market
conditions present at the time of the original analysis by Gatev et al. (1999),
we present evidence that they are essentially outdated nowadays, especially
for the cointegration method.
Our findings indicate that studies directly replicating the pairs trading
setup from Gatev et al. (1999) are not perfectly representative of the actual
quality of the strategy. The parameters therein were implicitly optimized for
the market conditions at the time. They are not necessarily valid in recent
periods, and their suboptimality is likely to play a role in the widely held
belief that simple pairs trading no longer works.
However, finding good static trading rules that would consistently and
significantly outperform the gold standard trading rules appears hard to do,
at least without resorting to sophisticated methods. In fact, it appears that it
might not be possible unless we use at least partially dynamic trading rules.
We thus conclude that naive pairs trading with complexity on the level of
Gatev et al. (1999) does not work well, regardless of whether hyperparameter
tuning is performed or not, and its weak performance cannot be fixed with
better parameters alone since they do not bring large enough benefit.
