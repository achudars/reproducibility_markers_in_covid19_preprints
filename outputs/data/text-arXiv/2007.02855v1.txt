ABSTRACT
The severe acute respiratory syndrome COVID-19 has been in the center of the ongoing global health crisis
in 2020. The high prevalence of mild cases facilitates sub-notification outside hospital environments and the
number of those who are or have been infected remains largely unknown, leading to poor estimates of the
crude mortality rate of the disease. Here we use a simple model to describe the number of accumulated
deaths caused by COVID-19. The close connection between the proposed model and an approximate solution
of the SIR model provides a system of equations whose solutions are robust estimates of epidemiological
parameters. We find that the crude mortality varies between 10−4 and 10−3 depending on the severity of
the outbreak which is lower than previous estimates obtained from laboratory confirmed patients. We also
estimate quantities of practical interest such as the basic reproduction number and the expected number of
deaths in the asymptotic limit with and without social distancing measures and lockdowns, which allow us to
measure the efficiency of these interventions.

1 Introduction
Outbreaks of infectious diseases have been a common occurrence throughout history, often linked
or followed by disruptions in societies and human activities1 . There are several ways to measure
the impact of outbreaks but death tolls are the most relevant ones whenever the disease can
threaten lives. For instance, 32 million persons have died between 1981 and 2019 in the ongoing
HIV epidemics, 700 000 in 2018 alone2 . Aside from this large scale epidemic, the world has
experienced several other recent outbreaks with varying degrees of severity and scale: Zika fever,
whose symptoms are mild but can produce long-lasting effects in newborns (microcephaly)3, 4 ;
Ebola virus disease, with a high mortality rate estimated between 20 and 75%5, 6 ; Swine flu/H1N1,
which became a pandemic in 2009-2010 although with a lower mortality rate than regular flu7 .
In 2019-2020, the severe acute respiratory syndrome COVID-19 has emerged as the most recent
pandemic, caused by the virus named SARS-CoV-28, 9 . Due to its novelty and lack of previous
exposition, humans have no immunity against this threat, leading to increased number of infections.
At the time of this writing, the specifics of the pathogen transmission are still being investigated,

as well as the complete infection process once the virus enters the host. However, it has been
shown that the main human-to-human transmission mode occurs by the spreading of contaminated
droplets, similar to other flu-like diseases8 . In sharp contrast with H1N1, however, the mortality
rate of COVID-19 is estimated in the range 1-4%, with higher ill-outcomes among persons of old
age10, 11 . This situation creates a unique scenario where healthcare facilities and workers can be
overwhelmed in a short period of time, ultimately leading to untreated patients of COVID-19 as
well as other diseases12 .
To make matters even worse, asymptomatic patients can spread the pathogen for an extended
period of time, showing none or mild symptoms during the course of the infection. As a result,
laboratory tests to detect the viral load are necessary to identify the correct number of cases outside
hospital environments. Similar to the H1N1 pandemic, the required number of tests far exceeds the
current amount available in most countries. Without timely tracking of new cases, contact tracing
becomes a challenging task, hindering estimates of new cases per infection summarized by the basic
reproduction number, R0 . The significance of this parameter lies in the fact that it provides a way
to glimpse the values of the transmission rates. Those can then be used in compartmental models
– mathematical models that describe the evolution of epidemics assuming nearly homogeneous
populations13, 14 . Earlier estimates for R0 using epidemiological data from Wuhan, China, set R0
between 1.5 to 5.7 without additional measures to restrict the spreading15–17 . With measures in
place – such as lockdown, self-isolation, and social distancing – R0 was estimated to be around
1.0515 . More importantly, the insufficient number of tests, in addition to the long waiting time for
lab results, affects the quality of epidemic models.
In the absence of mass testings, the death toll can be used as an alternative metric to probe
the extension of the epidemic. The medical staff can assess the cause of death from clinical reports,
which may contain test results or not, using the best of their knowledge. Additional tests may also
be appended to reports to further specify the cause of death.
Both numbers of cases and deaths are publicly available as part of a global effort to tackle the
pandemic. Here, we study the evolution of COVID-19 deaths in order to reduce the issues caused
by the limited number of laboratory confirmed tests. We show that the accumulated deaths can
be effectively described by simple functions, namely, sigmoids whose parameters are explained in
terms of the SIR epidemic model. The SIR model is a compartmental model with the following
health states: susceptible, infective, and removed18 . The removed state represents those who
have passed away or have developed immunity, either by recovering from the disease or any other
method such as vaccination. The SIR model was chosen in detriment of epidemic models with
additional health states or reinfections because it is the simplest model that addresses immunity.
Among our results, we show that crude mortality rates can be computed from the parameters of
sigmoids and that the rates can change up to one order of magnitude, depending on the severity of
the outbreak in a given region. The paper is organized as follows. Sec. 2 contains the description
2/20

of the data and variables used along the text. Sec. 3 explains how the SIR model is reduced from
a system of differential equations to a single non-linear differential equation, with emphasis on the
expansion around equilibrium. Data is modeled in Sec. 4 via sigmoidal functions, whose parameters
are explained in terms of the epidemiological parameters of the SIR model. Time windows are
addressed in Sec. 5, with special emphasis on R0 , crude mortality rate, and quantitative effects of
the confinement. Final comments and conclusions are listed in Sec 6.

2 Data
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) provides COVID-19 data updated in a daily schedule19 . The daily reports portray the distribution of new confirmed cases and
new deaths presented as time series. The dataset also displays the population size N according to
2018 World Bank census for each geographical region (see Table 1).
To better grasp the nature of the data, consider the number of accumulated deaths in France, as
shown in Fig. 1. Similar to other European countries, France was heavily affected by the pandemic
nearing the mark of 30 000 deaths, with a sharp increase in deaths of infected patients around
April-May. These deaths are linked to infections which took place between 3 to 6 weeks prior.
On March 16, the French government implemented measures to mitigate the propagation of the
disease. The measures included confinement of non-essential workers and temporary closures of
schools and universities, as well as commercial stores and services. The effects of said measures
did not show up immediately on the data (see Fig. 1b) but instead they appeared after some time
had passed, around 4 weeks, reducing the number of daily fatalities.
Before diving into modeling, we seek for general features that can be used to model outbreaks.
These features concern the spreading regime of the disease among the population, excluding spatial
effects and temporal delays. As noted above, the death toll experienced a rapid growth between
March and April (see Fig. 1). This regime is the hallmark of epidemics and denotes the exponential
phase. In general, the growth rate in compartmental epidemic models is summarized by R0 that is

the ratio of the transmission rate α to the removal rate λ. As the name implies, the transmission
rate dictates the average number of persons a given infective individual typically infects during a
fixed time interval. The inverse of the removal rate is the characteristic time in which a person
remains contagious.
The inflection point is another important feature. However, unlike small scale outbreaks, where
the disease spreads uninterruptedly among elements of a given population, the introduction of large
scale control measures forcibly modifies the transmission rate. This sudden perturbation reduces
the value of the transmission rate in a short time interval, creating an artificial inflection point.
After the exponential phase, the system relaxes toward an equilibrium state with no infective
people, with a characteristic time scale, namely, the relaxation time τ . We shall investigate the
relationship between τ with epidemiological parameters in the next section. Considering these
three aspects, and using Fig. 1 as reference, it becomes clear that the number of accumulated
deaths is a monotonic function, with an early exponential growth only to be replaced by a smooth
relaxation towards equilibrium. Therefore, sigmoids appears as ideal candidates to model the data.

3 SIR model
For the sake of simplicity, let us assume the spreading dynamics can be approximated by the
standard SIR model in a homogeneous population of size N. The model comprises a population
whose subjects can be classified in three distinct health states, namely, susceptible,

infective,

and removed. The removed state includes individuals that have either died or recovered from
4/20

the disease. The latter are assumed to not be infective anymore, nor susceptible to become sick
again because of some kind of immunity. The fraction of individuals in each compartment is,
respectively, S(t), I(t), and R(t), at time instant t. The dynamic goes as follows. Infective
subjects in the population transmit the pathogen to susceptible ones, under adequate conditions.
The transmission occurs with rate α, and we assume the homogeneous mixture of the population,
that is, each person in the population is statistically equivalent to each other14 .

Once infected,

the person remains infective for an average period 1/λ, where λ is the removal rate. The dynamical
equations that describe the model are:
dS
= −αS(t)I(t),
dt
dI
= +αS(t)I(t) − λI(t),
dt
dR
= +λI(t),
dt

(1a)
(1b)
(1c)

with the constraint S + I + R = 1, i.e., conservation of the population size. The model certainly
simplifies or neglects recent aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic such as differentiation between
asymptomatic and symptomatic transmission or age-dependent rates20, 21 . In fact, research on
the biological characteristics of the ongoing pandemic are still ongoing22 , but evidence indicates
re-infections should be minimal in recovered patients23 . Therefore, we make a case for an approximate description of the problem via the SIR model over the inclusion of extra complexities and
uncertainties, aiming to capture dominant aspects.
The system of differential equations (1a-1c) can be further reduced to a single first-order differential equation as follows. From (1c) and (1a), one finds S(t) = S0 e−(α/λ) R(t). The constant
S0 = S(0)e(α/λ) R(0) depends on the initial conditions S(0) and R(0) = 1 − S(0) − I(0). Usually, we
are more interested in scenarios in which R(0) = 0 and thus S0 = 1 − I(0), similar to the onset of
an emerging disease. The complete expression for S0 must be used for different initial conditions,
which can become a problem whenever the ratio α/λ is unknown. Ignoring constant solutions, it
can be shown24 that the equation can be further reduced to
dR
= −λS0 e−(α/λ)R(t) − λR + λ,

whose general solution can be obtained by quadrature

(3)

The stationary condition in (2) gives the value R∞ as a solution of the transcendental equation
R∞ = 1 − S0 e−(α/λ)R∞ .
The solution R(t) can be obtained by inverting (3), for which a general method remains unknown. To circumvent the issue, one may expand (2) around points of interest, for example,

around R = 0 or R = R∞ . Each expansion has advantages and issues. The linear term in the
expansion around R = 0 dictates the exponential growth of R(t), with an effective rate αS0 − λ.
We use the adjective effective rather loosely here because at some point the curve should change
its curvature and converge to an equilibrium value. Unfortunately, the competition between the
early exponential growth and relaxation towards equilibrium is often difficult to assess near the
onset of the outbreak, requiring higher order contributions in the expansion.
Alternatively, we can get a better picture of the problem by expanding R(t) around the equilibrium. By doing so, the expansion only requires contributions up to second order, as it already
carries the information regarding R∞ . Furthermore, the expansion near the equilibrium also ensures that τ describes the dominant relaxation time, rather than combinations of several decay
modes, each one with its own timescale. Define δR(t) = R∞ − R(t) > 0. The expansion of (2) near
δR ≪ 1, together with the transcendental equation for R∞ , gives

Keeping terms up to o(δR2 ), one converts (4) into a Bernoulli equation with relaxation time

solution (see Fig. 2)

4 Effective model
The sigmoidal expression in (5) satisfies the requirements listed in Sec. 2 and it is an excellent candidate to model the data of accumulated deaths. However, the removed compartment corresponding
to R(t) holds both recovered and deceased fractions of the population, i.e., all the infected who
are unable to spread the disease. We can simplify this issue by assuming the existence of a simple
relation between R(t) and the accumulated number of deaths divided by the population size, g(t),
at the time instant t. To keep the model as simple as possible, we neglect temporal delays and
impose
g(t) = f R(t),

(6)

where the crude mortality rate f is the ratio between deceased and infected. As such, it also can
be used as an estimator for the likelihood to die after contracting the disease.
The equilibrium value g∞ varies from country to country and can be used to characterize the
outbreak, more specifically, to assess the impact of the outbreak in the afflicted population. The
monotonic nature of cumulative quantities together with the upper bound g∞ restrict the possible
functional forms for g(t). Sigmoids are natural candidates to describe g(t) since they are bounded
and monotonic. Here we consider the following expression in tandem with (5):
geff (t) ≡

g∞ − a e−t/τ
.
1 + b e−t/τ

(7)

The timescale τ dictates the relaxation of g(t) towards g∞ , with inflection at tc = τ ln b. Equation (7)
has 3 or 4 parameters depending on whether geff (t) must pass by the initial entry geff (0) = g(0) = g0
or not. The former implies the constraint a = g∞ − g0 (1 + b), whereas the later geff (0) = (g∞ −
a)/(1 + b) with a 6 g∞ . Since the data are noisy, we do not require the fitting curve to pass by g0 .
The relationship between g(t) and R(t) is consistent if the following equations hold:

(8c)

The system of equations (8a-8c) connects the epidemiological parameters (α, λ, f, S0 ) with the
parameters (τ, g∞ , b) of the sigmoid curve (5), which can be estimated by a least-square fitting
procedure. However, there are more variables than equations so at least one epidemiological
variable must be fixed. There are two reasonable choices, namely, either S0 or λ. The first choice
should be selected if the data includes the onset of the outbreak because S0 ≈ 1, since the majority
of the population should be in the susceptible state at the early stage of the epidemic. However, if
7/20

the beginning of the outbreak is unknown, the assumption S0 ≈ 1 is no longer valid. Alternatively,
one may consider an estimate for the removal rate λ, or its probability distribution. In this case,
the input parameter to solve (8a-8c) depends solely on the characteristics of the disease and local
demographics. It does not require details concerning the disease spreading nor the moment in
which the outbreak begins. Therefore, evidence-based values for λ from patient data are far more
suitable for the purposes of this study, and shall be used hereafter.

5 Time windows
Fig. 3 shows the death toll in France from March 16 to May 25. Unlike the theoretical SIR model,
agreement between data and the sigmoidal fit (performed with a standard non-linear least-square
fitting procedure) is poor. The fitted curve becomes negative in early March and converges to a
different equilibrium value. Thus, we must refute the sigmoid to describe the death toll in the
complete time interval. Alternatively, the parameter optimization of the SIR model agrees well with
the input data, except for the first 20 days. However, the optimization returns λopt = 0.103 days−1
which does not match the signature value for COVID-19 λ = 0.2 day−1 . If the value λ = 0.2 days−1
is held fixed during the optimization (not shown), then the optimal set of parameters become
highly sensitive to the initial guess of the optimization algorithm.
The observation above inquires whether the SIR model describes the data or not. However, this
issue can be understood by inspecting the number of daily deaths (see Fig. 1a). An asymmetry
is observed around the peak of daily deaths (see Fig. 1b), which is in sharp contrast with the
corresponding curve in the theoretical SIR model (see Fig. 2b). The asymmetry can be explained by
a variation in the transmission rate. Unlike other recent epidemics, several countries have adopted
control measures such as lockdowns of non-essential workers, flight and other travel restrictions.
The efforts effectively reduce the transmission rate of COVID-19 once they are in place. Thus, the
data must be divided in non-overlapping time windows, each with its own set of epidemiological
parameters.
As a first example of data where the necessity to consider several time windows is obvious, we
consider the global deaths between February 29 and May 31 (see Fig. 4). This case is interesting
because countries afflicted by the epidemic have implemented various control measures at different
schedules, of varying effectiveness. Thus, reduction of the global transmission rate cannot be
pinpointed to a single day or week a priori. Similar to Fig. 1, the number of daily deaths exhibits
an asymmetry, with center in mid-April, indicating the approximate interval in which the global
transmission rate changes. European countries with most cases at the time (France, Italy, Spain)
introduced lockdown and other strategies in mid-March, with others following shortly. Afterwards,
the daily number of deaths starts to reduce, followed by an oscillatory pattern (7 days period)
likely tied to work routines of medical staff and death cases reports.

of the first time window is chosen as to maximize the adherence of the fitting curve (minimize r 2 )
while increasing the number of data points. r 2 forms a plateau for sizes between 29 to 41 days
followed by a sudden increase for 42 days, indicating that 41 days is the optimal size of the time
window (February 29 - April 9).

11/20

In the following, we decide to divide the observation time in two consecutive time windows.
Let us explain how we determine the optimal separation time (optimal duration of the first time
window). Let gk be the fraction of the global population that dies due to complications caused
by COVID-19, starting from February 29. The index k = 0, 1, . . . , m − 1 indicates the number of
elapsed days in the time window with duration m. The data are fitted via (7) with parameters
g∞ , a, b and τ , using trust region reflective algorithm (Python/Scipy). It is convenient to fit the
data using τ −1 instead of τ and a finite interval 0 6 τ −1 6 1, so the infection lasts at least one day
in the mathematical model. In the fitting procedure, we use bounds for b which depends on the
time interval tc between the inflection point and the initial entry, more specifically, tc = τ ln b. For
tc > 0 we restrict the search to tc /τ < 10 so that b ∼ o(104 ); for tc < 0, i.e., starting the counting
after the inflection point, the parameter space of b is limited between 0 and 1. Thus, we set the
0 < b 6 104 . The remaining parameters are restricted to 0 6 g∞ , a 6 1.
The quality of the fit is quantified by the square residue divided by the size of time window,
namely, r 2 = (1/m)

Pm−1
k=0

[gk − geff (k)]2 . The first time window comprises m consecutive days that

minimize r 2 while increasing m, as indicated by the inset in Fig. 5, from February 29 to April 10,
whereas days starting from the m + 1 day are put into the second time window. The curve fit in
the first interval corresponds to a scenario in which control measures were not implemented outside
China and South Korea. These two time windows are consistent with the asymmetry observed in
the number of daily deaths in Fig. 4, whose peak lies in mid-April. The fit converges to near 2.0
million deaths, significantly above the equilibrium value (0.6 million deaths) in the second time
window, from April 11 to May 31. We stress that the number of fatalities avoided (1.4 million)
highlights the effectiveness of lockdowns and other control measures.
The curve fitting in the first time window, which includes the phase with exponential growth,
can be challenging though. Even more so if the fitting data contains a large number of entries
around the inflection point induced by the introduction of control measures. This inflection point is
not the natural inflection point which occurs in an uncontrolled epidemic with constant parameters.
Due to the significance of inflection points in the curve fitting, the induced inflection point can be
responsible for the artificially low value of the equilibrium value g∞ in the first time window. Also,
early data often contain far less entries, thus being more susceptible to fluctuations.
Conversely, the presence of inflection points caused by the introduction of control measures
greatly simplifies the fitting procedure in the second time window. For instance, Fig. 6 depicts
the death toll in Denmark after April 3, within the second time window. The fitting (7) is
in excellent agreement with data for g∞ = (1.03 ± 0.01) × 10−4 (approximately 600 deaths) and
τ = 15.84 ± 0.65 days. Next, we solve the system (8a-8c) for λ distributed according to some
probability distribution, centered around λ = 0.2 days−1 . In practical terms, the width of the
probability distribution forms the ground to compute uncertainties of the transmission and crude
mortality rates. However, the finer details of the distribution of λ remain unknown so we resort to

a uniform distribution for virus shedding, whose interval lies between 3 and 7 days20, 25 . By doing
so, we overestimate the uncertainties of the remaining epidemiological parameters of the SIR model
and find R0 = 0.81 ± 0.07. Our estimate for the crude mortality rate f = (0.68 ± 0.15) × 10−4 is
compatible with the estimate fDNK = 8.2 × 10−4 ( confidence interval: [5.9 − 15.4] × 10−4 ) obtained
by screening antibodies of 20640 blood donors below the age of 70, in Denmark26 . Also, the
asymptotic value R∞ = g∞ /f = 0.15 ± 0.03 places the fraction of infected well below the threshold
(60%) for herd immunity. Thus, a new wave of infections is likely to occur if the disease becomes
seasonal unless a vaccine becomes available or social distancing measures remain in place.
We can now move to more complicated cases, in which the data themselves contains artifacts
and the fitting procedure can be tricky. That is the case of France, for instance. The lockdown was
issued on March 16, and unaccounted deaths in nursing homes were added to the official statistics
on April 3 and 4, producing a large fluctuation in the number of daily deaths. In this case, we
separate the time windows according to the number of deaths. The first time window lies between
100 and 5000 deaths (March 16 - April 3), whereas the remaining days until May 31 comprises the
second time window, as shown in Fig. 7.
The curve fitting in the second time window is far more stable and insensitive to initial guesses,

or bounds, with equilibrium death toll nearing 29440 ± 158 and time scale τ = 15.12 ± 0.72 days,
which approaches the typical recovery time for mild COVID-19 infections. The solution of the
system (8a-8c) returns R0,2 = 0.74 ± 0.08 < 1 in agreement with the decline of new infections,
where the notation R0,k with k = 1 and 2 refers to the first and second time windows, respectively.
In addition, the crude mortality rate in the second time window reads f2 = (4.67 ± 1.16) × 10−3,
one order of magnitude higher than Denmark or Germany (see Table. 2).
The analysis in the first time window requires more care. The fitting procedure requires bounds,
otherwise the fit may incorrectly converge to an equilibrium value that is much lower than the
one obtained for the second time window. In addition, multiple solutions can be found for (8a8c), several of which are not realistic. Instead of using brute force, it is far more convenient to
approximate the solution and set S0 = 0.99. In such case, (8c) is discarded and the remaining
equations produce R0,1 = 3.25 ± 1.71. The crude mortality rate in the first time window, f1 =
(4.23 ± 0.58) × 10−3 , shares the same order of magnitude as f2 , indicating that overall the French
health care system remained responsive throughout the epidemic. If control measures had not
been implemented, the expected number of deaths would have soared and reached 240 000, with
equilibrium infected fraction of population R∞ = 0.96, assuming the mortality rate would have
remained roughly the same.

6 Conclusion
The tragic developments in the COVID-19 pandemic have exposed flawed aspects in protocols used
to assess large scale epidemics. Despite the various improvements in the global capacity to produce
laboratory tests, usually based on reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), the
majority of afflicted countries were unable to enforce mass testing policies. This shortcoming has
also been experienced in 2002 with the SARS epidemic but in a smaller scale. The lack of mass
15/20

testing contributed in keeping the number of cases unknown, affecting the accuracy of disease
spreading models. In this paper, we resort to the death toll from April 4 to May 31 instead of
reported cases as our primary data source as death certificates are mandatory and may contain
other medical assessments linking the cause of death with COVID-19 outbreaks. We emphasize this
methodology is not immune itself from sub-notification, nor unforeseen delays on death certificates.
We model the death toll via the sigmoid curve in (7), which requires the parameters g∞
(capacity) and τ (time scale). The capacity limits the growth of the outbreak, which is expected
to vary with geographic region, healthcare quality, and efforts to control the spreading of the
virus. Together with the crude mortality rate f , which also depends on healthcare and population
demographics, they give access to a far more credible estimate for the infected fraction of the
population R∞ = g∞ /f . To keep the model as simple as possible, we also neglect temporal delays
between g(t) and R(t). The inclusion of said delay may introduce additional effects, but those are
not expected to be dominant in this case since spatial effects are not being investigated.
The advantage of our approach relies on the curve fitting of a monotonic curve (death toll)
to a sigmoid in sharp contrast to complex optimization schemes for models with multiple health
states20, 21 . Epidemiological parameters are extracted by solving the algebraic system of equations
(8a-8c) for transmission rate, crude mortality rate and initial condition, respectively, α, f, and
S0 . Alternatively, the epidemiological parameters calculated from the curve fitting can be used as
educated guesses in optimization algorithms reducing the likelihood of obtaining unrealistic optimal
solutions. We stress that if f is known, then the fraction of reported cases can be easily computed
R(t) = g(t)/f . We find that f ranges from o(10−4) to o(10−3), depending on geographic location.
Such values lie well below recent the estimate27 using only rRT-PCR tests from hospitalized cases
(7.2%), whereas it is more in line with the values obtained from antibody screening with large
sample size in Denmark26 . Interestingly, countries lightly afflicted by the epidemic exhibit lower f
even though the transmission of the virus is similar to neighbouring countries. Taking Germany or
Denmark as examples, we see that both have f ∼ o(10−4 ) while maintaining R0 compatible with
other European countries.

The result is likely attributed to healthcare resources and services

either being more accessible or efficient, including early surveillance.
The sigmoidal fitting becomes far more reliable once the outbreak has been active for some
time as the data starts to move away from the exponential phase. The distance from the inflection
point is another important factor that affects the quality of the fit, especially the value of g∞ . The
introduction of lockdowns and other social distancing measures reduce the transmission rate and
effectively create a new inflection point, which is different from the one expected without control
measures. Thus, the fitting curve may converge to an incorrect equilibrium value if the fitting data
include points around the induced inflection point. This can only be solved by introducing disjoint
time windows for different regimes of α as Fig. 7 shows. The difference between the equilibrium
values of g∞ from each time window returns the fraction of avoided deaths and it evaluates the
16/20

effectiveness of control measures and policies. For instance, approximately 210 000 deaths or about
seven times the current projection have been avoided in France. This is compatible with the large
decrease in the basic reproduction number, placing it below the endemic threshold. However, some
care is needed in interpreting these estimates as our analysis considers only two time windows and
therefore does not anticipates second waves of infections.
Concerning deviations in parameters estimated through (8a-8c), they can be tracked to the
uncertainties in the removal rate. In general, the inverse of the removal rate describes the average
time required for an infective person to change to the removed state. For COVID-19, virus shedding
occurs more prominently between 3 and 7 days, with a peak at day 5 since the onset of symptoms25 .
The exact probability distribution for λ remains an open issue so our analysis assume a uniform
distribution.
Finally, the SIR model rests on the random mixing hypothesis but deviations are expected
with stronger effects in population with varying demographics or populations at risk. In particular, communicable respiratory diseases become major issues in correctional facilities, given the lack
of adequate environmental and sanitary conditions. The combination of higher transmission rate
of pathogens and reduced removal rate with reduced healthcare can increase the crude mortality
rate for incarcerated individuals. By a similar argument, outbreaks in nursing homes may affect estimates of epidemiological parameters because the disease becomes disproportionately more lethal
for older patients. In this study, both effects are neglected in hopes to understand the disease
spreading of the average population with the minimal number of parameters possible.
