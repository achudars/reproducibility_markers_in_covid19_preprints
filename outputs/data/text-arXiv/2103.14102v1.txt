The city of Rio de Janeiro is one of the biggest cities in Brazil. Drug gangs and paramilitary groups called milı́cias control some regions of the city where the government is not
present, specially in the slums. Due to the characteristics of such two distinct groups, it
was observed that the evolution of COVID-19 is different in those two regions, in comparison with the regions controlled by the government. In order to understand qualitatively
those observations, we divided the city in three regions controlled by the government, by
the drug gangs and by the milı́cias, respectively, and we consider a SIRD-like epidemic
model where the three regions are coupled. Considering different levels of exposure, the
model is capable to reproduce qualitatively the distinct evolution of the COVID-19 disease in the three regions, suggesting that the organized crime shapes the COVID-19
evolution in the city of Rio de Janeiro. This case study suggests that the model can be
used in general for any metropolitan region with groups of people that can be categorized
by their level of exposure.

1. Introduction
The evolution of epidemics is one of the most dangerous problems for a society and
its spreading mechanisms have been the source of interest to the exact sciences’
scientific community for over a century 1 . The humanity faced severe pandemics
during its evolution, like the Spanish flu in 1917, the Honk Kong flu (H3N2) of 1968
and the swine flu (H1N1) in 2009. Several efforts were done since the 70’s in order
to understand the mathematical evolution and spreading of diseases 2,3 .
The recent outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on society in
different countries and its many diverse aspects are now the object of a long list of
different studies on the subject of epidemic modelling. An immense and not always
reliable amount of data has been produced over the past year regarding infection
rates, contagion levels, population-exposure-related contamination, age-related fatality rates, statistical spreading, quarantine efficiency, death tolls and mortality

rates by population; these have been exhaustively given worldwide coverage by the
press, health organizations and data banks 4,5 and we will not delve further here
in details regarding these parameters.
For many different diseases, compartmental models focusing on a population
divided into Susceptible (S), Infected (I) and Recovered (R) individuals, namely
SIR, have been used extensively. It often employs mean-field approximation for the
individuals network which, albeit unrealistic, was able to model many different aspects of epidemic behaviour, including the necessity of artificial immunity through
vaccination in order to contain the spreading of the disease 6 . Taking into account
the pre-symptomatic, symptomatic and asymptomatic possibilities for COVID-19
infection and spreading, SIR models fail because of two important issues: i) the
possibility of pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic contagion through individuals
which are not known as patients (i.e. belonging to the I compartment) led to social
isolation and quarantine measures throughout the world; and, in consequence, ii)
different levels of social isolation among groups coexisting in the same geographical area make the mean-field approximation inadequate for COVID-19 contagion
behaviour 7 .
In order to tackle the first of these two issues, many groups proposed different
compartmental modelling of the COVID-19 pandemic spreading using SIQR, with
the introduction of a fourth class of individuals, namely the Quarantined ones (Q)
7,8,9,10,11,12 . The introduction of the Q population is nothing new, however, and
quarantine effects on epidemic models have been studied in this manner for a few
decades 13 . Nonetheless, SIQR models have been useful in modelling the COVID-19
spreading 9 and, for example, predicting phenomena such as the so-called second
wave incidences 7 . Yah and Li have taken a further step and included age as a novel
parameter that influences the connections between the different compartments in a
SIQR model 14 . El Fatini et al. 10 have included vaccination strategies employed in
previous models 6 in the very early stages of the COVID-19 onset, while Hackbart
11 has proposed models including mass testing and selected quarantined individuals
based on these testing parameters, in order to target infected individuals to reduce
contagion rise.
On the other hand, the second issue listed above needs further addressing. Odagaki included the fluctuation of social isolation policies in Japan and how it was
obeyed by citizens in order to explain the crescent three-wave pattern that has
arisen there over the course of the pandemic 8 , but still kept the compartmental
model with mean-field approximation. Weisbuch attempts to circumvent the limitations of the mean-field approximation by including a mobile initial population
at both city and countryside in order to simulate urban exodus and its influence
on the COVID-19 spreading 15 , and then including crossover parameters linking
interchange between city and countryside populations. Although it is an oversimplification of the dynamics of evolving networks 16 , it is an efficient move towards
including different types of population in the same model. Kraemer et al. have studied the consequences of human mobility and social isolation policies in China during

the COVID-19 first months and found strong correlation patterns 17 .
In this work, we aim to address the question of different patterns of social isolation and contact in a population confined to a single geographical location, in
order to model groups of individuals either with different degrees of compliance to
the same social isolation policy or subjected to different social isolation policies. In
order to have numerical data to which to compare the proposed model, we take the
particular situation of Rio de Janeiro as a case study, which has been the object
of previous works 18 . We chose Rio de Janeiro city because of its very particular
subdivision into different areas, as is more thoroughly explained elsewhere 19,20,21 .
In short, although in principle the entire city is subjected to the regular official
municipal, state and federal policies, two other groups, with divergent governance
systems, retain political and enforcement control over many different sub-regions of
Rio de Janeiro’s metropolitan area, namely drug trafficking gangs and the paramilitary groups called milı́cias. While drug trafficking gangs exert stay-at-home regulations in their controlled areas, since their financial activities rely on underground
commerce and minimal governmental interference, milı́cias, operated by police and
ex-police officers as a parallel power, force local populations to not stay at home,
in order to maintain their commercial tax and protection monetary charges. This
behavior in different slums has been monitored using, for example, credit card and
mobile cellphones usage data 22 and an illustrative map of the different regions is
shown by Bruce et al. 21 , but it is not reproduced here because we do not take
the geographical subdivisions into account in our model. Therefore, in the same
metropolitan area there is an interchange of individuals subdivided into three different but connected populations, each with its own exposure parameter, which is
related to the level of social distancing that the individuals for each group adopt.
In other words, the exposure coefficients are related to the degree of exposure that
each individual both is subjected to other individuals and subject other individuals
to him/herself. We aim to verify if the distinct contagion rates observed by the
authors 21 are a direct consequence of different exposure patterns.
In order to try to accomplish this, we refrain from using the SIQR model, since,
in general, our goal is to address the effects of exposure patterns on the spread of
COVID-19, and, in particular for our case study, quarantined individuals data are
very hard to obtain in both drug trafficking gangs and milı́cias controlled regions.
We opt instead for the SIRD model, which includes a compartment for Dead (D)
individuals and is very useful when death rates data are more readily available,
which is the case for COVID-19 both in general 23,24 and in our particular case
study, where death rates due to COVID-19 are reported to be higher for milı́ciacontrolled areas and lower for drug-trafficking-gang-controlled areas, with respect
to the rates observed for regions under the direct influence of neither type 21 .

2. Model
Let us recall the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Dead (SIRD) model 1 . The population is divided in four compartments, and the equations for the evolution of such
compartments are

(4)

where S, I, R and D denote the fractions of Susceptible, Infected, Recovered and
Dead individuals, respectively. The parameters β, γ and δ denote the infection,
recovery and death probabilities, respectively.
As discussed in the Introduction, we are interested to verify if the hypothesis
pointed by the authors in Ref. 21 is plausible. In other words, if the restrictions
to stay at home imposed by the drug trafficking gangs in some regions of the city
and the pressure to not stay at home in areas dominated by the milı́cias influenced
the COVID-19 spreading in distinct areas of Rio de Janeiro. For this purpose, we
divided the Rio de Janeiro city in three regions, namely:

• 1: areas controlled by the government
• 2: areas controlled by drug trafficking gangs
• 3: areas controlled by milı́cias

In each of such regions, we consider a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Dead
(SIRD) model. In addition, we consider in the models’ equations the exposure restrictions (in the case of drug gangs’ areas) or the absence of such restrictions (in
the case of milı́cias). In such case, we consider three additional parameters to the
SIRD model: the coefficients related to the population’s exposure in each region,
namely C1 , C2 and C3 for regions 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Those coefficients take
into account the couplings of the population of a given region with the population
of the other regions.

where Su , Iu , Ru and Du denote the fractions of Susceptible, Infected, Recovered
and Dead individuals, respectively, in each region u, with u = {1, 2, 3}. The terms
Su Cu Cv Iv in Eqs. (5) and (6) introduce the above-mentioned coupling among the
regions. In other words, the coupling terms correspond to the infection of individuals
in a given location u by infected individuals 15,25 of all the three locations (v =
{1, 2, 3}) that move along the city. Notice that we do not restrict the Cu values to
the range 0 < Cu < 1 since, strictly speaking, they are not probabilities – they are
related to the degree of exposure of individuals and they depend on the specific
area of the city such individuals live. For simplicity, we considered homogeneous
probabilities β, γ and δ for the three regions.
3. Results
We considered the initial conditions Ru (0) = Du (0) = 0 and Iu (0) = 0.001 for
u = {1, 2, 3}. The normalization condition is obeyed at each time step, i.e., S(t) =
1 − I(t) − R(t) − D(t), where S(t) = S1 (t) + S2 (t) + S3 (t), I(t) = I1 (t) + I2 (t) +
I3 (t), R(t) = R1 (t)+R2 (t)+R3 (t) and D(t) = D1 (t)+D2 (t)+D3 (t). In this case, the
initial condition for the susceptible populations is S1 (0) = S2 (0) = S3 (0) = S(0)/3.
Since we have distinct behaviors regarding the social isolation in the three regions, we have C2 < C1 < C3 , i.e., there is less exposure in drug trafficking regions
(area 2) and more in milı́cia controlled ones (area 3). As we are interested in the
qualitative description of the results obtained in 21 , and the parameters C1 , C2 and
C3 are the novelty of the model (as well as the division in three regions), we fixed
the transition probabilities β = 0.32, γ = 0.045 and δ = 0.054, based on estimates
for COVID-19 parameters 18,26 .
In Fig. 1 we exhibit the fractions of Susceptible, Infected, Recovered and Dead
individuals for the three areas 1, 2 and 3 as functions of time for C1 = 1.0, C2 = 0.4
and C3 = 1.3, obtained from the numerical integration of Eqs. (5) - (8). Since
the exposure coefficients are arbitrary parameters, we chose as unity the one for
government controlled areas and modified the other two accordingly. We can see
that if we consider the coupling among the 3 regions, together with the distinct
exposure coefficients Cu (u = {1, 2, 3}), the model leads to distinct evolutions in
each region u. In particular, one can see that the outbreak for the infections is

more pronounced in the region 3 dominated by the milı́cias. On the other hand,
one observe the flattening of the curve of infections in region 2, dominated by the
drug gangs. Such difference among the three regions leads to distinct evolutions of
the number of the other three compartments S, R and D. Specifically, the number
of deaths is higher in region 3 and lower in region 2, in comparison with the region
1 controlled by the State. These results suggest that the scenario observed in 21 ,
i.e. distinct evolutions of the infections and deaths in the three regions of Rio de
Janeiro, is indeed due to the distinct exposure patterns imposed by drug trafficking
gangs and milı́cias, in such two regions (2 and 3) that are not controlled by the
State.
In Fig. 2 we exhibit comparative results for the fraction of Infections in the three
regions. We fixed the standard exposure coefficient for region 1 as C1 = 1.0, and
present two distinct comparisons. First, we consider the curves for fixed C3 = 1.3
(as in Fig. 1) and distinct values of C2 (Fig. 2, left-hand side), namely C2 = 0.4 (full
lines) and C2 = 0.2 (dashed lines). One can see that lowering the exposure coefficient
for the more social isolated group (the one controlled by drug trafficking gangs in
our case study) considerably lowers the infection rates for individuals belonging to

this group, while maintaining the other two groups fairly unchanged. On the other
hand, in the right-hand side panel we consider the curves for fixed C2 = 0.4 (as
in Fig. 1) and distinct values of C3 , namely C3 = 1.3 (full lines) and C3 = 1.8
(dashed lines). It is very interesting to see that in this case, when we change the
degree of exposure of the less social isolated group (the milı́cia controlled one, in
our case study), the infected population of all three groups increase considerably,
and roughly by the same proportion. This clearly indicates that, in a city divided
in three different groups, with different degrees of exposure, increasing the social
distancing among individuals that already have a lower degree of exposure, albeit
lowering the infection rates of this particular group, does not change the overall
scenario: the two other groups, which were already responsible for the larger share
of infected individuals are only slightly affected by it. Meanwhile, if we increase the
degree of exposure (i.e. decrease the social distancing) of individuals which were
not respecting social isolation policies in the first place, the consequences for the
entire population are indeed drastic. It is worthwhile to mention that this does not
refer to our case study alone - in any populated area where one is able to subdivide
the inhabitants into groups with three different degrees of exposure, this conclusion
holds. Moreover, since we assumed a mean-field-like approximation modulated by
the exposure coefficients, we did not take into account the geographical properties
of Rio de Janeiro City and its controlled regions; therefore, this aspect takes a more
general form.
From Fig. 2 one can also see some of the more general infection behaviors that
always appear when looking at epidemic models: the flattening (height decrease and
enlargement) of the infection curves over time for higher social isolation patterns
and a shorter pandemic time-frame with increased infection (and, consequently,
death) rates for lower social distancing. It is meaningful that these behaviors are
reproduced as well in a population subdivided as we presented here, with these
differences showing simultaneously between the three different groups; i.e. group 2

has flatter infection rate curve over time than groups 1 and 3. From the changes
shown in Fig. 2 for the three curves when different values for parameters C2 or
C3 were chosen, one can infer that the existence of a group which does not respect
social distancing measures has a very strong effect on individuals that are not under
a strict social distancing policy.
4. Final Remarks
In this work we considered a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Dead (SIRD) model
in order to study the evolution of COVID-19 in the Rio de Janeiro city. Taking
into account that the organized crime dominates several neighborhoods of the city,
we divided the city in three areas, namely the areas controlled by the government
(area 1), by the drug trafficking gangs (area 2) and by the paramilitary groups called
milı́cias (area 3). Taking into account that the behavior of individuals in each region
is distinct, determined by the government in area 1 and by the organized crime in
areas 2 and 3, we considered distinct exposure coefficients for the three regions. In
addition, we coupled the 3 regions through these exposure coefficients, considering
a not-independent SIRD model in each region.
At this point, some limitations can be discussed. First of all, we considered a
mean-field-like approach, where each individual can interact with all others. In this
case, spatial features were not considered in the model. Our work does not consider
explicitly an upper bound for the capacity of the healthcare system. Under-reporting
is another feature that is not modeled here. We have also assumed permanent immunity, i.e., after recovering from COVID-19 individuals cannot be infected anymore.
In addition, as we are interested in explaining a phenomenon observed in the beginning of the epidemic evolution, we did not implement other containment measures
besides the exposure restrictions imposed by each controlling agent.
It is important to say that our target was not to describe exactly the evolution of
COVID-19 in Rio de Janeiro city, but we are interested in the qualitative description
of an observed phenomenon, namely the distinct evolution of the number of cases
and deaths in the three distinct regions, as observed by economists in recent works
21,22 . In such a case, despite the above-mentioned limitations, the model presented
here is capable to explain in a simple way how the organized crime shaped the
COVID-19 evolution in Rio de Janeiro.
Furthermore, since we employ a mean-field-like approach, the geographical features and subdivisions of our case study were not taken into account, which in a
certain way can be actually considered a feature instead of a liability: it shows, in
a first-order approximation, the consequences of the epidemic progression in individuals belonging to different exposure patterns. It can be inferred from our results
that a group of individuals that respects social distancing policies has less impact on
the overall pandemic picture – besides, of course, lowering their own infection and
death risks – than a group of individuals that presents higher degrees of exposure.
The increase of exposure in the latter group considerably enhances the infection

rate, while the decrease of exposure in the former, social isolated, group has a much
lesser impact on the progression of the disease.
