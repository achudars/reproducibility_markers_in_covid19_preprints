Since the first recording of what we now call Covid-19 infection in Wuhan, Hubei
province, China on Dec 31, 2019 (CHP 2020), the disease has spread worldwide and
met with a wide variety of social distancing and quarantine policies. The effectiveness of
these responses is notoriously difficult to quantify as individuals travel, violate policies
deliberately or inadvertently, and infect others without themselves being detected (Li
et al. 2020a; Wu & Leung 2020; Wang et al. 2020; Chinazzi et al. 2020; Ferguson
et al. 2020; Kraemer et al. 2020). Moreover, the publicly available data on infection
rates are themselves unreliable due to limited testing and even possibly under-reporting
(Li et al. 2020b). In this paper, we attempt to interpret and extrapolate from publicly
available data using a mixed first-principles epidemiological equations and data-driven
neural network model. Leveraging our neural network augmented model, we focus our
analysis on four locales: Wuhan, Italy, South Korea and the United States of America,
and compare the role played by the quarantine and isolation measures in each of
these countries in controlling the effective reproduction number Rt of the virus. Our
results unequivocally indicate that the countries in which rapid government interventions
and strict public health measures for quarantine and isolation were implemented were
successful in halting the spread of infection and prevent it from exploding exponentially.
In the case of Wuhan especially, where the available data were earliest available, we have
been able to test the predicting ability of our model by training it from data in the
January 24th till March 3rd window, and then matching the predictions up to April 1st .
Even for Italy and South Korea, we have a buffer window of one week (25 March - 1
April) to validate the predictions of our model. In the case of the US, our model captures
well the current infected curve growth and predicts a halting of infection spread by 20
April 2020. We further demonstrate that relaxing or reversing quarantine measures right
now will lead to an exponential explosion in the infected case count, thus nullifying the
role played by all measures implemented in the US since mid March 2020.

1. Introduction
The Coronavirus respiratory disease 2019 originating from the virus “SARS-CoV-2”
(Chan et al. 2020; CDC 2020) has led to a global pandemic, leading to 823, 626 confirmed
global cases in more than 200 countries as of April 1, 2020 (WHO 2020). As the disease
began to spread beyond its apparent origin in Wuhan, the responses of local and national
governments varied considerably. The evolution of infections has been similarly diverse,

in some cases appearing to be contained and in others reaching catastrophic proportions.
In Hubei province itself, starting at the end of January, more than 10 million residents
were quarantined by shutting down public transport systems, train and airport stations,
and imposing police controls on pedestrian traffic. Subsequently, similar policies were
applied nation-wide in China. By the end of March, the rate of infections was reportedly
receding (Cyranoski 2020). Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore managed to maintain
fairly low infection rates throughout, even though a second wave of infections is appearing
in Singapore, perhaps due to incoming repatriates (Lin & Wang 2020). South Korea, Iran,
Italy, and Spain experienced acute initial increases, but then adopted drastic generalized
quarantine. This did result in apparent recession of the spread in South Korea, whereas
in the other three countries the effect of the policies is not yet clear. In the United
States, where both the onset of widespread infections and government responses were
comparatively delayed, infection growth currently appears to be explosive. As of April
2 2020, the United States has the highest number of infected cases (∼ 227k) globally.
Given the available data by country and world-wide, there is an urgent need to use data
driven approaches to quantitatively estimate and compare the role of the quarantine
policy measures implemented in several countries in curtailing spread of the disease.
Existing models analyzing the role of travel restrictions in the spread of Covid-19 either
used parameters based on prior knowledge of SARS/MERS coronavirus epidemiology
and not derived independently from the Covid-19 data (Chinazzi et al. 2020), or were
not implemented on a global scale (Kraemer et al. 2020). In this paper, we propose
augmenting a first principles-derived epidemiological model with a data-driven module,
implemented as a neural network. We leverage this model to analyze and compare the
role of quarantine control policies employed in Wuhan, Italy, South Korea and USA, in
controlling the virus effective reproduction number Rt (Imai et al. 2020; Read et al.
2020; Tang et al. 2020; Li et al. 2020a; Wu & Leung 2020; Kucharski et al. 2020;
Ferguson et al. 2020). In the original model, known as SEIR (Fang et al. 2006; Saito et al.
2013; Smirnova et al. 2019), the population is divided into the susceptible S, exposed
E, infected I and recovered R groups, and their relative growths and competition are
represented as a set of coupled ordinary differential equations. The simpler SIR model
does not account for the exposed population E. These models cannot capture the largescale effects of more granular interactions, such as the population’s response to social
distancing and quarantine policies. This is where data come in: in our approach, a neural
network added as a non linear function approximator (Rackauckas et al. 2020) informs the
infected variable I in the SIR model. This neural network encodes information about the
quarantine strength function in the locale where the model is implemented. The neural
network is trained from publicly available infection and population data for Covid-19 for
a specific region under study; details are in the Materials and Methods section. Thus,
our proposed model is globally applicable and interpretable with parameters learnt from
the current Covid-19 data, and does not rely upon data from previous epidemics like
SARS/MERS.
Since neural networks can be used to approximate nonlinear functions with a finite
set of parameters, they serve as a powerful tool to approximate quarantine effects in
combination with the analytical epidemiological models. The downside is that the internal
workings of a neural network are difficult to interpret. The recently emerging field of
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (Raissi et al. 2019) exploits conservation principles,
SIR in our case, to mitigate overfitting and other related machine learning risks.
All four regions that we applied our model to have developed infected and exposed
populations that are sufficiently large to train our models. The first three are comparable
in terms of population (11 million, 60 million and 52 million, respectively) and almost

million), with increasing travel restrictions since mid March 2020. Leveraging the insights
gained through reliable prediction and estimation in Wuhan, South Korea and Italy, we
make forecasting predictions regarding the infection spread in the USA; thus making our
model informative for quarantine and social distancing policy guidelines and regulations.

2. Results
Figure 1 shows results from the classical SEIR and SIR models applied to Wuhan data.
Neither model can recover the stagnation seen in the actual infected number, about 30
days post the detection of the 500th infected case in Wuhan, i.e. 24th January, 2020. The
neural network model trained to include quarantine, on the other hand, does predict this
stagnation; see below.
Figures 2-7 show results of our neural network models trained to include quarantine
effects in the Wuhan, Italy, and South Korea regions, and respective predictions for the
evolution of infections for approximately one month past the end of training. We use
two parameters to quantify the results: the effective reproduction number Rt and the

effective quarantine strength Q(t). Qualitatively, Q(t) is inversely proportional to the
average time it takes for an infected person to be quarantined and to further infect any
susceptible individuals.
We trained the models using data starting from the dates when the 500th infection
was recorded in each region: 24th January, 27th February, and 22nd February for Wuhan,
Italy and South Korea, respectively; and up to about a month thereafter. The respective
models, superimposed over the actual recorded data, are in Figures 2a, 4a and 6a,
generally showing good agreement. The respective forecasts are in Figures 3, 5 and 7. As
can be seen, the model with quarantine control included is able to capture the plateau in
the infected case count, as opposed to the standard SIR and SEIR models shown in Figure

USA, or gradual adjustment to one of the quarantine control functions Q(t) of Wuhan, Italy
or Korea according to (4.17). (b) Adjusted quarantine strength function for USA according to
(4.17).

1. In the case of Wuhan, because the onset was earliest, our forecast can be compared
with recorded infection data in the period March 3rd till March 24th , also showing good
agreement with the actual observations of infection stagnation leading to Rt < 1 during
that period (Cyranoski 2020).
In the case of the US, similarly to the other regions, i.e. starting when the 500th
infection was recorded on March 8th , we trained the model till the latest available data,
i.e till 1 April 2020. The infected case count estimated by our model shows a good match
with the actual data (Figure 8a). Forecasting results for Q(t), Rt for a period of 1 month
following the current US policy are in Figure 9. In Figure 10a we forecast the number
of infections the US would experience starting from 1st April if the US were to follow
its current quarantine policy as opposed to gradually adjust to adopting the respective
quarantine models learnt from the more reliable Wuhan, Italy and South Korea data.
We arbitrarily set the adjustment period to 17 days; i.e till 17 April 2020. Figure 10b
shows the effective quarantine rates Q(t) obtained from (4.17) that would apply to the
US during the respective adjustment period. Details are in the Materials & Methods
section.

3. Discussion
The results show a generally strong correlation between strengthening of the quarantine
controls, i.e. increasing Q(t) as learnt by the neural network model; actions taken by
the regions’ respective governments; and decrease of the effective reproduction number
Rt . For example, in Italy, government restrictions reportedly (Ghiglione et al. 2020)
tightened during the week preceding mid March, which is also when our model shows a
sharp increase in Q(t) and corresponding decrease in Rt (figures 4b, c). For Wuhan and
South Korea, similar cusps in government interventions took place earlier, in the weeks
leading to and after the end of January (Cyranoski 2020) and February, respectively
(Normille 2020). These cusps were also captured well by our model (Figures 2b, c and
6b, c, respectively). Even for the USA, Q(t) shows a stagnation till 20 March 2020, after
which it shows a sharp increase accompanied with a decrease in Rt (Figures 8b, c), which
is in alignment with the ramping up of government policies and quarantine interventions
post mid March in the worst affected states like New York, New Jersey, California, and
Michigan.

7
A comparative analysis of the quarantine strength function Q(t) learned by the neural
network for different countries reveals that Wuhan had the highest magnitude and South
Korea had the highest growth rate of Q(t). This can be attributed to the stringent
government interventions and strict public health measures including immediate isolation
and quarantine impositions in Wuhan and South Korea. This eventually resulted in the
halting of infection spread and a corresponding Rt < 1 within a month for Wuhan (Figure
2c) and within 20 days for South Korea (figure 6c) after the first signs of a pandemic
were recognized.
It is reported that the infected case count stagnated nation-wide in China by the
beginning of March (Cyranoski 2020) and in South Korea by the end of March (Fisher
& Sang-Hun 2020); which eventually led to a stagnation in the quarantine interventions
employed in these countries. This is in general qualitative agreement with our forecasting
results which show a plateau in Q(t) and Rt at Rt < 1: Figures 3a,b and 7a,b. In Italy, as
of March 20th , I(t) is appearing to be linear (Figure 4a), which is consistent with lower
rates of infections being actually reported (Horowitz & Kirkpatrick 2020) and can be
taken as a precursor to stagnation. It is also consistent with adoption of strict movement
restrictions by the government shortly before the March 20th date. We forecast that, for
Italy, Rt will drop below 1 and Q(t), Rt both will stagnate between mid to end of April
2020 (Figure 5a, b) indicating halting of the spread of infection.
Owing to the relaxed quarantine and isolation policies in the US in its initial stages
post the infection spread, our model converges to Q(t) ≈ 0.4 − 0.6 (Figure 8b) which is
the smallest compared to other regions. Even though the effective Rt is still greater than
1 as of April 1 2020 (Figure 8c), its growth has started to show a decreasing trend and
we expect the infection to start showing stagnation with Rt < 1 by 20 April 2020 if the
current US policies continue without change (Figures 9b, 10a). This will be accompanied
by a continuous ramp up of quarantine policies (Figure 9a). At its peak, we forecast
the infected count to reach approximately 600,000 before stagnation, again assuming no
change in US policies. Our mixed model analysis for USA, employing Q(t) learnt from
the models of Wuhan, Italy and South Korea in the USA model starting from 1 April
2020, reveals that stronger quarantine policies (Figure 10b) might lead to an accelerated
plateauing in the infected case count, as shown in Figure 10a, and subsequently smaller
infected case count. On the other hand, in agreement with National Institute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases estimates (Miller 2020), we forecast that relaxing or abandoning
the quarantine policies gradually over the period of the next 17 days may well lead to
∼ 1 million infections without any stagnation in the infected case count (Figure 10a) by
mid April 2020.

4. Materials and Methods
Model 1: Without quarantine control
The classic SEIR epidemiological model has been employed in a number of prior studies,
such as the SARS outbreak Fang et al. (2006); Saito et al. (2013); Smirnova et al. (2019)
as well as the Covid outbreak Read et al. (2020); Tang et al. (2020); Wu & Leung (2020).
The entire population is divided into four sub-populations: susceptible S; exposed E;
infected I; and recovered R. The sub-populations’ evolution is governed by the following
system of four coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations (Smirnova et al. 2019;
Wang et al. 2020)

(4.3)
dt
dR(t)

(4.4)

Here, β, σ and γ are the exposure, infection and recovery rates, respectively, and are
assumed to be constant in time. The total population N = S(t) + E(t) + I(t) + R(t) is
seen to remain constant as well; that is, births and deaths are neglected. The recovered
population is to be interpreted as those who can no longer infect others; so it also includes
individuals deceased due to the infection. The possibility of recovered individuals to
become reinfected is accounted for by SEIS models (Mukhopadhyay & Bhattacharyya
2008), but we do not use this model here, as the reinfection rate for Covid-19 survivors
is considered to be negligible as of now.
The simpler SIR model neglects exposure, assuming instead direct transition from
susceptible to infected; it is described by three coupled nonlinear ordinary differential
equations as

(4.5)
(4.6)
(4.7)

Here, β is the infection rate.
The reproduction number Rt in the SEIR and SIR models is defined as
β
Rt = .
γ

(4.8)

An important assumption of the SEIR and SIR models is homogeneous mixing among the
subpopulations. Therefore, they cannot account for social distancing or mass quarantine
effects. Additional assumptions are uniform susceptibility and disease progress for every
individual; and that no spreading occurs through animals or other non-human means.
Alternatively, the models may be interpreted as quantifying the statistical expectations
on the respective mean populations, while deviations from the model’s assumptions
contribute to statistical fluctuations around the means.
We applied both SEIR and SIR models to the case of Wuhan only. The results are
shown in Figure 1 and verify that these models fail to predict the early arrest of infectious
spread due to quarantine policies.
Initial conditions The starting point t = 0 was the day at which 500 infected cases
were detected, i.e., I(t = 0) = 500. The initial number of susceptible individuals was
S(t = 0) = 11 million, Wuhan’s population. The initial exposed population was assumed
to be E(t = 0) = 20 × I(t = 0) in accordance with (Read et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2020)
and the number of recovered individuals was set to a very small value R(t = 0) ≈ 10.
Parameter estimation The time resolved data for the infected, Idata and recovered,

9
Rdata case count for Covid-19 was obtained from Chinese National Health Commission.
The optimal values of the parameters β, γ in the SIR model and β, σ, γ in the SEIR
model were obtained by performing a local adjoint sensitivity analysis (Cao et al. 2003;
Rackauckas et al. 2019) of the ODE problems in these models, by minimizing the mean
square error loss function L(β, σ, γ) defined as
L(β, σ, γ) = ∣∣log(I(t)) − log(Idata (t))∣∣2 + ∣∣log(R(t)) − log(Rdata (t))∣∣2

(4.9)

The minimization procedure was performed using the ADAM optimizer (Kingma & Ba
2014) for 500 ∼ 1000 iterations. The optimum values were used to produce figure 1.
Model 2: With quarantine control
To study the effect of quarantine control globally, we start with the SIR epidemiological
model. This choice is to minimize the number of free parameters in the model and avoid
overfitting. To include quarantine control in the modelling, we augment the SIR model by
introducing a time varying quarantine strength term Q(t) and a quarantined population
T (t)
T (t) = Q(t) × I(t).
Thus, the new effective reproduction rate becomes
Rt =

β
.
γ + Q(t)

(4.10)

Since Q(t) does not follow from first principles and is highly dependent on local quarantine policies, we devised a neural network-based approach to approximate it.
Recently, it has been shown that neural networks can be used as function approximators
to recover unknown constitutive relationships in a system of coupled ordinary differential
equations (Rackauckas et al. 2020, 2019). Following this principle, we represent Q(t) as
a n layer-deep neural network with weights W1 , W2 . . . Wn , activation function r and the
input vector U = (S(t), I(t), R(t), T (t)) as
Q(t) = r (Wn r (Wn−1 . . . r (W1 U ))) ≡ NN(W, U )

(4.11)

For the implementation, we choose a n = 2-layer densely connected neural network with
10 units in the hidden layer and the ReLU activation function. This choice was because
we found sigmoidal activation functions to stagnate. The final model was described by 63
tunable parameters. The neural network architecture schematic is shown in the attached
Supplementary Information. The governing coupled ordinary differential equations for
the augmented SIR model are

The quarantined population is initialized to a very small value T (t = 0) ≈ 10 and,

thereafter, the neural network learns how to approximate it based on the local data
from each region under study.
Initial conditions The starting point t = 0 for each simulation was the day at which
500 infected cases were detected, i.e. I0 = 500. The number of susceptible individuals was
assumed to be equal to the respective regional populations, i.e. S(t = 0) = 11 million, 60
million, 52 million and 327 million for Wuhan, Italy, South Korea and USA respectively.
Also, in all simulations, the number of recovered individuals was initialized to a small
number R(t = 0) ≈ 10.
Parameter estimation The time resolved data for the infected, Idata and recovered,
Rdata for each locale considered is obtained from the Center for Systems Science and
Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University. The neural network-augmented SIR
ODE system was trained by minimizing the mean square error loss function
LNN (W, β, γ) = ∣∣log(I(t)) − log(Idata (t))∣∣2 + ∣∣log(R(t)) − log(Rdata (t))∣∣2

(4.16)

that includes the neural network’s weights W . Minimization was carried out through
local adjoint sensitivity analysis (Cao et al. 2003; Rackauckas et al. 2019) following a
similar procedure outlined in Rackauckas et al. (2020) and implemented using the ADAM
optimizer (Kingma & Ba 2014) for 300 ∼ 500 iterations. To avoid over-fitting, the training
is stopped when the loss function, L is seen to stagnate and the first derivative I ′ (t), R′ (t)
is seen to match that of the data. The training loss curves for all regions are shown in the
attached Supplementary Information. The plots in figures 2, 4, 6 and 8 were obtained by
following this approach separately for each locale, training the respective neural networks
according to data available for the periods January 24th - March 3rd for Wuhan, February
24th - March 23rd for Italy, February 22nd -March 17th for Korea, and March 8th - April
1st for the US. It should be noted that under-reporting of the recovered case count, R(t)
in the USA (Lyons 2020), leads to smaller recovery rate and hence a smaller fraction
of the population being transferred from the infected compartment to the recovered
compartment in the model described in (4.12) - (4.15). Thus, simultaneous training of
W, β, γ as described above leads to our model over-estimating the infected case count.
As a result, for the USA, we first find the optimal γ by minimizing (4.16), and then use
this value of γ for minimizing the loss function, L(W, β) = ∣∣log(I(t)) − log(Idata (t))∣∣2 .
Such an independent optimization procedure for estimating γ may lead to small errors
in the estimation of R(t). Such errors are seen to be negligible in this case (figure 8a),
thus validating this approach for the USA.
The estimates of β, γ, Q(t) obtained using this procedure are shown in table 1. Table
also shows the intervention efficiency defined as the number of days elapsed between
detection of 500th case and the first time when the effective reproduction number reached
Rt < 1 in the chosen locale.
Forecasts in figures 3, 5, 7 were obtained by using the sub-population data on the final
days of their respective training periods to initialize the trained neural network models for
Wuhan, Italy and Korea. For figure 10, the forecasts were obtained by similarly initializing
the model but subsequently in the post April 1st period adjusting the quarantine model
gradually over 17 days till 10 April according to
