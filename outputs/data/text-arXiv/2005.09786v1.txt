Abstract. The goal of this work is to study the optimal controls for the COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil. We consider an agestructured SEIRQ model with quarantine compartment, where the
controls are the quarantine entrance parameters. We then compare
the optimal controls for different quarantine lengths and distribution of the total control cost by assessing their respective reductions
in deaths in comparison to the same period without quarantine.
The best strategy provides a calendar of when to relax the isolation measures for each age group. Finally, we analyse how a delay
in the beginning of the quarantine affects this calendar by changing
the initial conditions.

1. Introduction
At the end of 2019 a novel coronavirus emerged in the city of Wuhan,
China. In January 2020 the disease was given the name COVID-19
and, by mid February, China already faced over 60 thousand cases [26].
Many scientists then began to model disease to forecast its worldwide
impact ([23], [5]), even influencing policies of many governments.
As the disease spread across Europe and the United States, some
countries were forced to implement quarantines or even lockdowns to
mitigate the harms and were able to do the so called “flattening of the
curve”, i.e., to postpone and dampen the maximum number of active
cases. By mid May, Brazil is entering this stage, with some states
declaring stricter quarantine policies.
Optimal control theory has been applied to general epidemic models
([1], [18]) as well as to specific disease models such as HIV ([10], [6],
[13]), tuberculosis ([21], [12]) and influenza ([15]). Recently, a few
works applying optimal control theory to the COVID-19 pandemic,
such as [7] and [4], have appeared. This paper focuses on a SEIR model
with quarantine as was proposed in [9], but dividing the population in
age groups as in [2]. This is particularly important since COVID-19
has worse consequences on the elderly than it does on younger people.
Our goal is to calculate the optimal quarantine strategies numerically for different choices of parameters in the model, which reflect the
decisions governments must make when implementing these policies,
such as evaluating the economical costs of the quarantine for each of
the age groups and when to start implementing the measures. Then,
we compare the controls by looking at how they reduce deaths in comparison to the same period without quarantine. The best strategy gave
us a calendar of when to relax the measures in each of the age groups.
2. The age-structured SEIRQ model
Our model consists of a classical SEIR model with a quarantined
class. Besides, we assume that the population has an age structure
(see [22], [8] for models with a continuous age structure and [25], [24]
for models with a discrete one). There are three age groups, described
in Table 1.
Let Si (t), Ei (t), Ii (t), Ri (t) and Qi (t) be the number of susceptible,
exposed, infected, recovered and quarantined individuals in each age
group at time t ≥ 0, respectively. We assume that the total population
N (t) =

(Si (t) + Ei (t) + Ii (t) + Ri (t) + Qi (t))

is constant since we are only dealing with a short time frame in comparison to the demographic time scale. The equations, for i ∈ {1, 2, 3},
are as follows

All parameters are nonnegative. βij is the transmission coefficient
from age group i to age group j. Typically, it will be assumed that
βij = βji for all i, j. σi and γi are the latency and recovery periods,
respectively, for age group i. λ is the exit rate from the quarantine.
Our controls are the ui (t), which denote the percentage of susceptible
individuals in each age group that are put into quarantine at time t.
As such, they satisfy, a priori,
(2.2)

0 ≤ ui (t) ≤ 1 ,

i ∈ {1, 2, 3}.

4

However, it is unrealistic to expect an entire population to stay under
quarantine for a long time. There are essential workers such as healthcare professionals and police officers that cannot stay at home during
these times. As most of these workers are in age group 2, we suppose
that all of age groups 1 and 3 can be quarantined (for age group 3,
indeed, this is especially important since they are a risk group for the
COVID-19 pandemic). Thus, we shall loosen (2.2) by considering, for
example,
0 ≤ u2 (t) ≤ umax .
Evaluating umax is one of the tasks of each government’s authorities.
In this paper, we fix this parameter at umax = 0.9. This means that
(2.3)

0 ≤ u1 (t) ≤ 1, 0 ≤ u2 (t) ≤ 0.9, 0 ≤ u3 (t) ≤ 1.

Let
Ni (t) = Si (t) + Ei (t) + Ii (t) + Ri (t) + Qi (t)
be the total population of age group i. Adding the equations in the
system above, we see that Ni (t) is also constant for i ∈ {1, 2, 3}. Since
Ri (t) only appears in the other equations as a part of Ni (t), we substitute the equations for Ri0 i(t) by Ni0 (t).. Hence, we may also consider
the system of
Si (t)
Si0 (t) = −

Parameter values are taken from [2] and are listed in Table 2. The
data fitting was performed using an adaptation of a least-squares algorithm from [17].
To see how the numbers of infections and recoveries are distributed
in the three age groups, we refer to the data available in [3], shown in
Table 3. For simplification, we suppose that the difference between the
number of cases and the number of deaths represents the number of

that we considered as recovered might still carry the disease, but we use
this approach due to the scarcity of information regarding recoveries
we currently have. The respective distributions are shown in Table 4.

According to [26], Brazil had as of May 13, 2020 a total of 97,575
active COVID-19 cases. Even though there seems to be a large subnotification in the country [20], this number will be considered as the total
number of infected individuals nonetheless. To estimate the number of
exposed cases, we look at data from May 8, 2020, since the mean incubation period of the disease is thought to be around 5 days [14]. Once
again according to [26], at this time Brazil had 76,603 active cases,
so this gives us an estimation of 20,972 exposed cases. We also suppose that these cases follow the age distributions of cases from Table 4.
Finally, as of May 8, there were 65,124 recovered cases in Brazil [26].
Therefore, our initial time will consist of data from Brazil as of May
8, 2020. The total population is assumed to be 200 million, divided
into 40% young people, 50% adults and 10% elderly. We also assume
that there are no quarantined individuals when the simulation starts.
Since the numbers of exposed, infected and recovered are very small in
comparison to the total population, we assume that the initial number
of susceptible individuals is equal to the total population of the respective age group. The initial conditions of all variables, rounded to the
nearest integers, are listed in Table 5.

In the formula above, T is the quarantine duration and the parameters Bi are the costs of the control. We assume that Bi > 0 for
i ∈ {1, 2, 3} and that
(3.2)

where B ∈ R is the total control cost. Sufficient conditions for the existence of the optimal controls follow from standard results from optimal
control theory. For instance, we can use Theorem 2.1 in [11] to show
that the optimal control exists. Pontryagin’s maximum principle ([19],
[16]) establish that optimal controls are solutions of the Hamiltonian
system with Hamiltonian function

Uniqueness of the optimal controls (at least for small enough T ) also
follow from standard results, such as Theorem 2.3 in [11]. Numerical
solutions of systems (2.4) and (3.5) can be found by a forward-backward
sweep method [16]. The algorithm starts with an initial guess of the

9

controls u1 , u2 and u3 and then solves (2.4) forward in time. After
this first part, it uses the results and the initial guesses to solve (3.5)
backward in time and new controls are defined following (3.9). This
process continues until it converges.
4. Comparison of optimal controls for different control
costs
Quarantines are not just a matter of public health, for they also
present economic questions, for example. This means that we must
pay close attention to the control costs Bi . These numbers reflect how
the population is capable of dealing with the quarantine of the respective age group. Smaller values of Bi mean that the population can
withstand a stricter quarantine without many economical side effects.
This is not possible, on the other hand, for bigger values of Bi .
Since the bigger economic toll of the quarantine lies on the adults
(because they form almost all of the economic active population), we
assume that B2 is the greatest of the three values. As the isolation of
the young implies closing schools, this educational impact makes B1
the second highest cost, albeit much smaller than B2 .
How the total cost B is distributed among the age groups determines the shape of the optimal controls. To study this relationship,
we let B = 5000 and define four cost distributions D1 , D2 , D3 and D4 ,
detailed in Table 6.

control B.

in the times it takes for these relaxations, which are described in Table
7.
Our goal now is to compare these distributions by investigating the
number of deaths caused by the pandemic at the end of the quarantine

for each one of them. As in [2], the deaths will be calculated as a
fraction of the recovered, since there is no disease induced mortality in
our model. From Table 3, we can derive the case fatality rates µ1 , µ2
and µ3 for age groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The results are

Let D denote the number of deaths at the end of the quarantine due
to the disease. By our discussion above, we can write
(4.2)

D = µ1 R1 (T ) + µ2 R2 (T ) + µ3 R3 (T ).

Because of the uncertain nature of the parameters and due to the
high number of unreported cases, we do not show the crude numbers
of D for the four distributions. The approach we use is to select the
smallest values as unit and then scale the other values accordingly. The
results are displayed in Table 8. We also included D0 , representing the
outcome of no quarantine.

On the one hand, we see that all the optimal controls reduces the
number of deaths in more than 100 times in comparison to “doing
nothing” scenario. On the other hand, the four distributions produce
very similar results, with D4 being slightly better for both quarantine
lengths.
For a better visualisation, we plot the graphs of the total number of
infections for distribution D4 in Figure 2.
Both curves reach their minimum around the same time that the
controls reach zero. For a quarantine of 60 days, the number of cases
at the end is, indeed, much smaller than they are in the beginning.
However, for a shorter quarantine, there could even be more cases than
the initial total.

This fact shows that quarantines cannot be too short, or else the overall situation in the end could be worse than in the beginning. Moreover,
the number of cases start to go up again towards the end.
To finish this Section, we analyse how the initial conditions affect the
optimal control. We can interpret this as a way to see what happens if
it takes too long for these measures to be implemented. We do this by
considering initial conditions of exposed, infected and recovered twice
and four times as much as their original values. As of May 13, 2020,
the number of active cases in Brazil doubles every 10 days [26], so this
means waiting 10 or 20 days, respectively, to start the quarantine. In
the plots of Figure 3, we consider distribution D4 and quarantine length
of 60 days.

The plot on the left of Figure 3 is the same as the last one in 1.
The quarantine is relaxed for the young, adults and elderly after 13,

14

11 and 47 days, respectively. The plot in the middle has the initial
conditions of exposed, infected and recovered multiplied by two. Now,
the quarantine is relaxed only after 27, 26 and 53 days, respectively.
The last plot multiplies the initial conditions by four. The relaxations
happen, respectively, after 39, 38 and 54 days.
This shows that the quarantines have to be much stricter if there
is a delay in their implementation. Moreover, applying (4.2) with and
without quarantine, we see that the deaths are reduced by factors of 79
and 40 when initial conditions are multiplied by 2 and 4, respectively.
With an earlier quarantine entrance, Table 8 showed that the reduction
was by a factor of 155 for distribution D4 , so the longer it takes for the
quarantine to start, the less effective it is.
5. Conclusions
In this paper we considered an age-structured SEIRQ model, where
the quarantine entrance parameters are thought as controls of the system, and we looked for the optimal controls via Pontryagin’s maximum
principle. After writing down the optimality system, we calculated the
optimal controls numerically and analysed how some of the parameters
influence the results.
These parameters represent the difficult choices authorities must
make, such as deciding how many essential workers are allowed to remain circulating, estimating the economic impact of the quarantine and
even when to start it. As such choices are made, the optimal controls
give guidelines of how to proceed.
In Section 4, we considered a constant total control cost and distributed it among the age groups in four ways. The distribution with
the best results with regard to deaths during the quarantine gave us a
calendar of when to relax the isolation measures in the three age groups
(for quarantine lengths of 30 and 60 days, respectively):
• For the youngs, the date of relaxation was the 15th or the 13th
day.
• For the adults, the relaxation started at the 12th day or the
11th day.
• For the elderly, it started at the 25th day or the 47th day.
The optimal controls that induce this calendar produced a reduction
in the number of deaths of 110 and 155 times, respectively, in comparison to the same period of time without quarantine. However, in both
cases the number of infected cases reached a minimum just before the
end of the simulation, so by the time the quarantine ended, the cases
were going up again, even becoming bigger than the original values for

15

the shorter length we considered. This shows that the quarantines are
not effective if they are not long enough.
We also showed that waiting too long to start the quarantine makes
the period before the relaxation become longer. This also produced a
loss in efficacy, since the reduction of deaths due to the quarantine (in
comparison to the “doing nothing” scenario) appeared to be approximately inversely proportional to the number of initial cases.
In our model we used data from Brazil as initial conditions. Brazil
is a very large country, with many cities at different stages of the pandemic. This means that studies such as this one should be made locally
to best suit the characteristics of each city. As the plots of Figure 3
suggest, the sooner the quarantine is implemented, the shortest the
time the controls need to stay at their maximum is.
