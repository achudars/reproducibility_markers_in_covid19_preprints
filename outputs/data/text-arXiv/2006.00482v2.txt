Abstract
The World Health Organisation (WHO) has very strongly recommended testing and
isolation as a strategy for controlling the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The goal of this
paper is to quantify the effects of detection and isolation using formal models of epidemics
of varying complexity. A key parameter of such models is the basic reproduction ratio.
We show that an effective detection and isolation strategy leads to a reduction of the basic
reproduction ratio and can even lead to this ratio becoming lower than one.
Keywords: SIR model, COVID-19, pandemic, testing, detection, isolation, quarantine.

Introduction

In the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, on 16th March, 2020, the Director-General
(DG) of the World Health Organisation (WHO) gave out the following message [4]. (The
emphasis has been added.)
“... the most effective way to prevent infections and save lives is breaking the
chains of transmission and to do that you must test and isolate. You cannot fight a
fire blindfolded and we cannot stop this pandemic if we don’t know who is infected.
We have a simple message for all countries; test, test, test.”
Ideally, if every infected individual is immediately detected and effectively isolated then there
can be no transmission of the disease. The few initial infections will not spread and the disease
will be eradicated. The ideal, however, is not achieved in practice. On the other hand, the
effectiveness of detection and isolation has been established by South Korea where an early
large-scale testing and isolation programme led to a control of the disease.
The goal of this paper is to investigate whether the effects of detection and isolation on
controlling an epidemic can be quantifiably established. The effect of detection is captured by
a parameter which we call the detection rate which is the rate at which infected individuals
are detected to have the disease. The individuals who are so detected are isolated/quarantined.
This lowers the transmission rate of the disease for such individuals. Compared to infected
individuals who have not been detected, the detected individuals are likely to have an improved
recovery rate due to the access to better supportive treatment. So, the effects of isolation are
possible lowering of the transmission rate and an increase of the recovery rate.
An important parameter in mathematical models of an epidemic is the basic reproduction ratio. We consider the basic reproduction ratio obtained by the next generation matrix
method [3, 20] at the canonical disease free equilibrium (DFE) where the entire population is susceptible and all other compartments are empty. From linear stability analysis it is known [3, 20]
1

that if the basic reproduction ratio is less than 1, then the DFE is asymptotically stable, while
if it is greater than 1, then the DFE is asymptotically unstable, i..e, there is an exponential
growth in the number of diseased individuals.
We study the effects of detection and isolation on the basic reproduction ratio. To this end,
we consider pairs of epidemiological models. The difference between the models in a pair is that
one of the models has a compartment consisting of all individuals who have been detected to
have the infection, while the other model in the pair does not have such a compartment. Other
than this, the two models in a pair have the same compartments and the same parameters.
For both the models in a pair, we obtain expressions for the basic reproduction ratios using
the next generation matrix method at the canonical disease free equilibrium. The first kind
of results that we derive show that under natural conditions on the transmission and recovery
rate of the detected compartment, the basic reproduction ratio of the model with the detected
compartment is less than the basic reproduction ratio of the model without this compartment.
This demonstrates that effective detection and isolation has a quantifiable effect in lowering of
the basic reproduction ratio. The second kind of results that we prove show that if the detection
rate is sufficiently high and for individuals in the detected compartment either the transmission
rate is low enough, or, the recovery rate is sufficiently high, then the basic reproduction ratio
falls below 1. This quantifiably shows that a sufficiently comprehensive detection and isolation
procedure can actually prevent an epidemic from occurring.
Two pairs of models are considered. The first pair of models consists of the basic susceptibleinfected-recovered (SIR) model and the SIDR model, which is the SIR model augmented with
a detected compartment. The second pair of models is more complex. The model without the
detected compartment consists of the following compartments: susceptible, exposed, infectedasymptomatic, infected-symptomatic and recovered, leading to the SEAIR model. The other
model in the pair is the SEAIDR model consisting of the SEAIR model augmented with a
detected compartment. For both pairs of models, we prove the two kinds of results mentioned
above which establish the effects of detection and isolation on the basic reproduction ratio.
There have been policy guidelines, whereby patients who have been detected to be positive
are released from isolation after a certain number of days without testing that they are negative.
We model this by augmenting the SEAIDR model with a compartment called the pseudorecovered compartment leading to the SEAIDPR model. Individuals who have been detected
to be positive and are released after a certain number of days without testing for being negative
are assigned to the pseudo-recovered compartment. Such a policy may have an adverse effect
on the basic reproduction ratio. The details of the possible adverse effects are worked out in
Appendix B.
There have been several papers which have studied COVID-19 using compartment models.
See for example [6, 1, 18, 8, 10, 17, 9, 16]. To the best of our knowledge, no previous work
had suggested our approach to quantifying the effects of detection and isolation on the basic
reproduction ratio.
Before proceeding, we note two points.
1. In the ideal case, the transmission rate of individuals in the detected compartment would
be zero. In practice, however, this may not hold. For example, there have been many
newspaper reports of healthcare workers picking up the infection from patients under
treatment. For COVID-19, WHO recommends [15] that “that all probable and laboratoryconfirmed cases be isolated and cared for in a health care facility.” The same document
also mentions that “asymptomatic cases and patients with mild diseases and no risk factors
can be managed at home, with strict adherence to IPC measures and precautions regarding
when to seek care.” The policy guidelines by the Government of India [14] allows very
mild/pre-symptomatic patients to be under home quarantine under certain conditions.
While both the WHO and the Government of India guidelines provide conditions for
home quarantine, one may note that home quarantine is not necessarily as stringent as
institutional quarantine. So, the possibility of transmission of the disease by people under
2

home quarantine cannot be completely ruled out. Accordingly, in our models, we do not
assume that the transmission rate of individuals in the detected compartment is necessarily
zero. While this increases the complexity of the calculations, it also allows us to prove
conditions on the transmission rate of detected individuals for the disease to be controlled.
2. The present work required the computation of expressions for the basic reproduction ratios
for the various models. In these computations, we were aided by the software SAGE [19].
Specifically, initial expressions for the relevant eigen values of the next generation matrices
were obtained using SAGE. The relevant codes are given in Appendix C. For the simpler
models, these expressions were sufficiently simple to be directly handled. On the other
hand, for the more complex models, the initial expressions were quite complicated. As
examples, the numerator of the expression for the basic reproduction ratio provided by
SAGE is a sum of 30 degree-four terms for the SEAIDR model and a sum of 108 degreefive terms for the SEAIDPR model. Getting these into tractable forms so that meaningful
analysis can be done required a considerable amount of careful analysis. While the effort
behind this analysis is non-trivial, it would be very tedious for a reader to go through the
details of such algebraic simplifications. So, we have omitted such details and only the
final expressions for the basic reproduction ratios are provided.

SIDR Model

In the SIR model [5] the population is considered to be divided into three disjoint compartments,
namely susceptible, infected and recovered, where those who pass away are included in the
recovered compartment. It is assumed that individuals in the recovered compartment are neither
susceptible nor do they infect others. Infected individuals transmit the pathogen to those
who are susceptible. The numbers of susceptible, infected and recovered individuals define
the state of the system. The state evolves according to a system of differential equations. An
equilibrium is reached when there is no further change in the proportions of susceptible, infected
and recovered individuals. If the equilibrium is such that the proportion of infected individuals
is equal to zero, then it is called a disease free equilibrium otherwise it is called an endemic
equilibrium.
We consider the scenario, where members of the population are tested and if found positive
are segregated. This is modeled by introducing a new compartment in the SIR model which
consists of individuals who have been tested and found positive. We call this the compartment
of detected individuals. Individuals in both the infected and detected compartments have the
disease. The difference is that individuals in the detected compartment are known to have the
disease while individuals in the infected compartment are not known to have the disease. This
difference changes the behaviour of how the individuals in the detected compartment are treated.
Ideally they would be under isolation/quarantine to ensure that they do not infect others. This
signficantly reduces the transmission rate of individuals in the detected compartment. Also,
such individuals are more likely to receive better supportive treatment and hence are likely to
have a higher recovery rate compared to individuals in the infected compartment who are not
known to have the disease.
Moving people from the infected to the detected compartment will be based upon the testing
methodology adopted for the population. A well designed comprehensive testing strategy will
ensure that a large number of infected individuals are detected resulting in the transfer of these
individuals from the infected to the detected compartment.
Let S, I, D and R be numbers of susceptible, infected, detected and recovered individuals
respectively. The quantities S, I, D and R are functions of time. At any point of time, the
invariant S + I + D + R = N holds where N is the total size of the population.
Let β0 be the transmission rate for individuals in the infected compartment, which is the
product of the contact rate and the probability of transmission given contact. The force of
infection for the individuals in the infected compartment is λ0 (I) = β0 I/N . Let β1 be the
3

transmission rate for individuals in detected compartment and the force of infection for such
individuals is λ1 (D) = β1 D/N . Individuals in the detected compartment will ideally be under
quarantine and separated from susceptible individuals. So, it is reasonable to expect β1 to be
lesser than β0 . In fact, perfect segregation will result in β1 = 0.
Let γ0 be the rate at which individuals in the infected compartment recover and let γ1 be
the rate at which individuals in the detected compartment recover. One may assume that the
two rates are equal. There are, however, possible reasons why these two values may be different.
One reason is that when individuals have been found to be positive and moved to the detected
compartment, they have already spent some time in the infected compartment, so the additional
time they need to recover is shorter. Also, when an individual has been tested to be positive,
some kind of supportive treatment may be provided which may shorten the recovery time. So,
in general, we have γ1 ≥ γ0 and the condition γ1 > γ0 may also hold.
Let δ be the rate at which individuals move from the infected to the detected compartment.
The parameter δ is the detection rate. The value of δ is determined by the efficacy of the testing
methodology followed for the entire population. Note that δ does not represent the total number
of tests done in the population. Rather it is the rate at which infected individuals are detected
to be positive. As the total number of tests increases, so does the value of the parameter δ.
We make the following simplifying assumptions regarding the birth and death rates. Both
the birth and death rates are given by a parameter µ, all individuals are capable of reproducing and equally subject to mortality and all individuals are born without infection and are
susceptible to infection. These assumptions simplify the mathematical model with respect to
demographic considerations [2].
It is reasonable to assume that individuals move from the susceptible to the infected compartment. When an infected individual is tested and found to be positive, the person moves
to the detected compartment. Recovery takes place from both the infected and the detected
compartments. The state of the system is given by the vector X = (S, I, D, R). Based upon the
previous considerations, the evolution of the state with respect to time is given by the following
system of differential equations.

R′

= β0NIS + β1NDS − δI − γ0 I − µI,
= δI − γ1 D − µD,
= γ0 I + γ1 D − µR.

(1)

Equilibrium in the system given by (1) is achieved when S ′ = I ′ = D ′ = R′ = 0. The canonical
disease free equilibrium (DFE) is X0 = (N, 0, 0, 0), i.e., the state where all individuals are
susceptible and the other compartments are empty.
To obtain the basic reproduction ratio, we use the next generation matrix method at the
DFE X0 . The matrices F and V are as follows.

Suppose δ = 0. This corresponds to the situation when there is no transfer from the infected
to the detected compartment. Since the only way the detected compartment grows is by transfer
from the infected compartment, for δ = 0, the detected compartment is initially empty and stays
empty. In other words, there is no detection of positive cases using tests. So, the system evolves
according to the usual SIR model. Putting δ = 0 in (2), we see that R0 = β0 /(γ0 + µ) which is
the basic reproduction ratio of the SIR model. Let
β0

(3)

The difference between the SIR model and the SIDR model arises only when δ > 0. Under this
condition, we have the following result.
Proposition 1. Suppose δ > 0.
1. If β1 ≤ β0 and γ1 ≥ γ0 , then R0 ≤ R0⋆ .
2. If both the inequalities β1 ≤ β0 and γ1 ≥ γ0 hold and at least one of them is strict, then
R0 < R0⋆ .
Proof. From (2) and (3), we have that R0 ≤ R0⋆ if and only if
β1
γ1 + µ

≤

β0
γ0 + µ

(4)

and R0 < R0⋆ if and only if the inequality in (4) is strict.
For the first point, note that β1 ≤ β0 and γ1 ≥ γ0 implies (4). For the second point, note
that the given condition implies that the inequality in (4) is strict.
The condition δ > 0 corresponds to an effective detection rate. This is achieved only if the
testing strategy is effective. The condition β1 ≤ β0 and γ1 ≥ γ0 with at least one strict inequality
corresponds to the isolation strategy being effective. So, whenever we have an effective testing
strategy and an effective isolation strategy, the basic reproduction ratio of the system becomes
less than the basic reproduction ratio of the system without any testing. This shows that
effective testing and isolation has a quantifiable effect in lowering the basic reproduction ratio.
Suppose R0⋆ > 1. Then in the SIR model without the detected compartment, the DFE is
asymptotically unstable and the disease will have an exponential growth. In contrast, for the
SIDR model, we show that there is δ⋆ such that if δ > δ⋆ , then R0 given by (2) is less than one.
Proposition 2. Suppose β1 < γ1 + µ. Let δ⋆ be given by
δ⋆ =

(γ1 + µ)(β0 − γ0 − µ)
.
γ1 + µ − β1

(5)

Then R0 < 1 if and only if δ > δ⋆ .
Proof. From (2), we have R0 < 1 if and only if
(γ1 + µ)(β0 − γ0 − µ) < δ(γ1 + µ − β1 )
Under the assumption β1 < γ1 + µ, we have R0 < 1 if and only if δ > δ⋆ .
The condition β1 < γ1 + µ is equivalent to β1 /(γ1 + µ) < 1, i.e., there is no epidemic if we
leave out the infected people and consider only the individuals in the detected compartment.
This is a reasonable assumption, since people who have been detected to be positive will have
a significantly lower transmission rate and the recovery rate will be at least as large as those of
infected individuals who have not been detected.
5

From the expression for δ⋆ we see that δ⋆ > 0 if and only if R0⋆ = β0 /(γ0 +µ) > 1. Recall that
R0⋆ is the basic reproduction ratio of the system without any detection of infected individuals.
If R0⋆ < 1, then there is no epidemic in the population to start with and the entire analysis
becomes vacuous. So, it is meaningful to consider the situation where there is an epidemic
which is equivalent to R0⋆ > 1. In this case, δ⋆ is a positive quantity and puts a non-trivial lower
bound on δ.
The condition R0 < 1 implies that the SIDR system does not evolve into an epidemic. So, we
see that if the system would have originally evolved into an epidemic, through effective testing
and isolation, it is possible to ensure that no epidemic occurs.

A More Complex Model

We first expand the basic SIR model to include two other compartments, namely exposed
and infected-asymptomatic. So, there are a total of five compartments, susceptible, exposed,
infected-asymptomatic, infected-symptomatic and recovered. Susceptible individuals move initially to the exposed compartment. Individuals in the exposed compartment have picked up
the pathogen but are not yet themselves infectious. Individuals move from the exposed compartment to either the infected-asymptomatic or the infected-symptomatic compartments. People in both the infected-asymptomatic and infected-symptomatic compartments are infectious,
though, those in the infected-asymptomatic compartment do not yet show the symptoms while
those in the infected-symptomatic compartment exhibit the symptoms of the disease.
At any point of time, let S, E, A, I and R be the numbers of susceptible, exposed, infectedasymptomatic, infected-symptomatic and recovered individuals respectively. We have N =
S + E + A + I + R, where N is the total size of the population. The system of differential
equations describing the dynamics of the system are given as follows.

(6)

The parameters of the model in (6) are as follows.
• β1 and β2 are the transmission rates of infected-asymptomatic and infected-symptomatic
individuals respectively.
• σ1 and σ2 are the transfer rates from the exposed compartment to infected-asymptomatic
and infected-symptomatic compartments respectively.
• κ is the transfer rate from infected-asymptomatic compartment to infected-symptomatic
compartment.
• γ1 and γ2 are the recovery rates of individuals in the infected-asymptomatic and infectedsymptomatic compartments respectively.
• µ denotes the birth and death rates.
All parameters take non-negative values. In addition, we make the following assumptions.
• The transmission rates β1 and β2 are both positive, i.e. individuals in both the infectedasymptomatic and the infected-symptomatic compartments are infectious.
• The transfer rate σ1 from exposed to infected-asymptomatic is positive, since if σ1 =
0, then there is no addition to the infected-asymptomatic compartment and the model
collapses to SEIR.
6

• At least one of σ2 or κ is positive, since if both are equal to zero, then there is no addition
to the infected-symptomatic compartment and the model collapses to SEAR.
The condition β1 and β2 are both positive is succintly expressed as β1 β2 > 0. Also, the last two
conditions are succintly expressed as σ1 (σ2 + κ) > 0.
For the stability analysis we consider the DFE (S, E, A, I, R) = (N, 0, 0, 0, 0). Applying the
next generation matrix method at this DFE, we obtain the matrices F and V as follows.

Let us now consider the introduction of a new compartment in the SEAIR model. This
compartment consists of all individuals who have been detected to be positive giving us the
SEAIDR model. In addition to the numbers S, E, A, I and R defined above, let D be the number
of individuals who have been detected to be positive. The differential equations describing the
dynamics of this model are as follows.

γ1 A + γ2 I + γ3 D − µR.

(9)

In addition to the parameters of the model in (6), the following parameters are used in (9).
• β3 is the transmission rate of individuals who have been detected to be positive.
• δ1 , δ2 , δ3 are the detection rates of individuals in the exposed, infected-asymptomatic and
infected-symptomatic individuals respectively, i.e., these are the rates at which individuals
get transferred from exposed, infected-asymptomatic and infected-symptomatic compartments to the detected compartment.
It is possible that individuals who are exposed but, not yet infectious cannot be detected by a
test. In that case δ1 = 0. Individuals who are in the detected compartment are isolated. This
lowers the transmission rate of such individuals. In the ideal case where the isolation is perfect,
the transmission rate of individuals in the detected compartment is zero, i.e., β3 = 0. On the
other hand, considering β3 to be positive is more realistic.
The DFE at which the stability analysis is carried out is (S, E, A, I, D, R) = (N, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0).

If δ1 = δ2 = δ3 = 0, then R0 given by (10) becomes equal to R0⋆ given by (7). The condition
δ1 = δ2 = δ3 = 0 signifies that all the three detection rates are zero and so there is no transfer
to the detected compartment. As a result, the system SEAIDR collapses to SEAIR and so the
basic reproduction ratio of the SEAIDR system becomes equal to that of the SEAIR system as
mentioned in the previously. The condition that there is a non-trivial amount of detection is
equivalent to at least one of δ1 , δ2 and δ3 being positive which is equivalent to δ1 + δ2 + δ3 > 0.
We have the following result.

Using (15) and (16), it follows that to show that R0⋆ ≥ R0 , it is sufficient to show the following.
(η + δ1 )(α1 + δ2 ) − ηα1 ≥ δ2 σ1 + δ1 (α1 + δ2 ),
σ2 ((η + δ1 )(α2 + δ3 ) − ηα2 ) ≥ σ2 ηδ3 ,
σ1 κ((η + δ1 )(α1 + δ2 )(α2 + δ3 ) − ηα1 α2 ) ≥ σ1 κηα1 δ3 .

Since σ1 ≤ η, to establish (17), we note the following.
ηα1 + δ2 σ1 + δ1 (α1 + δ2 ) ≤ ηα1 + δ2 η + δ1 (α1 + δ2 ) = (η + δ1 )(α1 + δ2 ).
To establish (18), we note the following.
ηα2 + ηδ3 = η(α2 + δ3 ) ≤ (η + δ1 )(α2 + δ3 ).
To establish (19), we note the following.
ηα1 α2 + ηα1 δ3 = ηα1 (α2 + δ3 ) ≤ (η + δ1 )(α1 + δ2 )(α2 + δ3 ).
This completes the proof of R0⋆ ≥ R0 .
We now consider conditions for R0⋆ to be strictly greater than R0 . First suppose that β3 = 0.
Then the second terms of the expressions in (12), (13) and (14) are all equal to zero. Under the
conditions δ1 + δ2 + δ3 > 0 and σ1 (σ2 + κ) > 0, it follows that the first term of at least one of
the expressions in (12), (13) or (14) is positive. So, R0⋆ > R0 .
Now suppose β3 > 0. If at least one of the inequalities in (11) is strict, it follows that one
of the inequalities in (15) or (16) is strict. Further, under the conditions δ1 + δ2 + δ3 > 0 and
σ1 (σ2 + κ) > 0 one of the inequalities in (17), (18) or (19) is strict. So, R0⋆ > R0 .
This completes the proof.
The conditions in the statement of Theorem 3 are quite natural. We discuss these in details.
γ3 ≥ γ1 , γ2 : This condition expresses the fact that the recovery rate of individuals in the
detected compartment is at least as much as the recovery rates of individuals in the
infected-asymptomatic and the infected-symptomatic compartments.
β3 ≤ β2 and β3 ≤ β1 (σ1 /(σ1 + σ2 + µ)): The parameter β3 is the transmission rate of individuals in the detected compartment. In the ideal case when the isolation is perfect,
β3 = 0. In practice, the isolation may not be perfect and there is a possibility that an
individual in the detected compartment transmits the infection. It is, however, reasonable to assume that this transmission rate is small. The condition β3 ≤ β2 expresses the
fact that the transmission rate of individuals in the detected compartment is at most the
transmission rate of individuals in the infected-symptomatic compartment. The condition
β3 ≤ β1 (σ1 /(σ1 + σ2 + µ)) is somewhat stronger in that it requires the transmission rate
of individuals in the detected compartment to be at most a fraction (σ1 /(σ1 + σ2 + µ)) of
the transmission rate of individuals in the infected-asymptomatic compartment. If β3 is
small, then this can be expected to hold.
δ1 + δ2 + δ3 > 0: This condition is equivalent to saying that at least one of δ1 , δ2 and δ3
is positive, i.e., there is a non-zero transfer of individuals from one of exposed, infectedasymptomatic and infected-symptomatic compartments to the detected compartments.
σ1 (σ2 + κ) > 0: As explained earlier, this condition merely states that there are non-empty
transfers into the infected-asymptomatic and infected-symptomatic compartments.
One of the inequalities in (11) is strict: At least one of the inequalities in (11) being strict expresses the fact that either the recovery rate of individuals in the detected compartment
is strictly better than at least one of the recovery rates of individuals in the infectedasymptomatic or the infected-symptomatic compartments, or, the transmission rate of
individuals in the detected compartment is strictly less than the transmission rate of individuals in the infected-symptomatic compartment, or it is strictly less than the transmission rate of individuals in the infected-asymptomatic compartment adjusted by a factor.

In summary, the condition δ1 + δ2 + δ3 > 0 amounts to saying that the detection rate is nonzero and the condition that one of the inequalities in (11) is strict amounts to saying that the
isolation and treatment is effective. So, Theorem 3 shows that if the overall detection rate is
positive and the overall isolation and treatment are effective, then the basic reproduction ratio
becomes lower than what it otherwise would be.
We now consider the condition under which R0 becomes less than one. The following result
provides the limiting value of R0 as the detection rates δ2 and δ3 are increased.
Theorem 4. For fixed values of β1 , β2 , β3 , γ1 , γ2 , γ3 , σ1 , σ2 , κ and δ1 ,
R0 →

σ1 + σ2 + δ1
β3
·
,
γ3 + µ µ + σ1 + σ2 + δ1

as δ2 , δ3 → ∞.

Proof. Note that as δ2 , δ3 → ∞, the first three terms in the expression for R0 given by (10)
goes to 0. So, we only need to consider the expression which is multiplied to β3 /(γ3 + µ). The
third term of this expression also goes to zero as δ2 , δ3 → ∞. As a result, to obtain the limit of
R0 as δ2 , δ3 → ∞ we need to consider the limit of the following expression.


δ2 σ1 + δ1 (α1 + δ2 )

γ3 + µ (η + δ1 )(α1 + δ2 )
(η + δ1 )(α2 + δ3 )
As δ2 , δ3 → ∞, the above expression goes to

σ2
σ1 + δ1
β3
·
+
.
=
γ3 + µ η + δ1
η + δ1
γ3 + µ µ + σ1 + σ2 + δ1

Note that δ2 and δ3 are the detection rates for the infected-asymptomatic and infectedsymptomatic compartments respectively. As δ2 , δ3 → ∞, the differential equations for A and I
are approximated as A′ ≈ −δ2 A and I ′ ≈ −δ3 I. The solutions are A ≈ A0 e−δ2 t and I ≈ I0 e−δ3 t .
For high values of δ2 and δ3 , the values of A and I very quickly become close to zero. In other
words, if the detection rates δ2 and δ3 are high, then within a short period of time, the system
reaches a state where almost all infected individuals are detected.
The limit of R0 as δ2 , δ3 → ∞ given in Theorem 4 is at most β3 /(γ3 + µ). The quantity
β3 /(γ3 + µ) would be the basic reproduction ratio if we consider only the detected compartment
(i.e., leave out the exposed, infected-asymptomatic and infected-symptomatic compartments).
With perfect isolation, β3 would be zero and then R0 tends to zero. Even if the isolation is not
perfect, it is reasonable to assume that the basic reproduction ratio for a model consisting only
of the detected compartment will be less than one, i.e., β3 /(γ3 + µ) < 1. So, as δ2 , δ3 → ∞,
R0 converges to a limit which is less than one. The value of R0 going below one implies that
the DFE is asymptotically stable and there is no epidemic. So, Theorem 4 shows that if the
detection rates of infected-asymptomatic and infected-symptomatic individuals are sufficiently
high and the isolation/recovery process is made effective, then an epidemic can be prevented.

Conclusion

The effects of detection and isolation on controlling an epidemic have been quantifiably demonstrated using several epidemiological models. Detection rate is determined by the testing
methodology followed for the population. A comprehensive and properly targeted testing strategy will lead to significantly improved detection rates. Similarly, a comprehensive and well
designed isolation strategy will lead to significantly lower transmission rates of isolated individuals. Also, the recovery rate of isolated individuals may increase. It has been shown that the
joint effect of these factors can lead to a reduction of the basic reproduction ratio and even make
it smaller than 1. In this context, we note that both testing and isolation mechanisms are more
likely to be successful if they are applied in the early stages of the spread of the disease when the
number of infected persons is comparatively small. If the number of infected persons becomes
high, then it becomes more difficult to detect and isolate a significant number of individuals.

Compartment Models

There are many good introductions to compartment models. See for example [2, 7]. We provide
a brief description.
The entire population is divided into disjoint compartments. Suppose there are n compartments out of which m are disease compartments, with 1 ≤ m < n. For i = 1, . . . , n, let Xi be
the number of persons in compartment i. Without loss of generality, assume that the first m
compartments are disease compartments. The numbers X1 , . . . , Xn are functions of time t. Let
N be the total size of the population so that the invariant X1 (t) + · · · + Xn (t) = N holds for
all t ≥ 0. The dynamics of the system is given by the rate of change of Xi (t), i = 1, . . . , n. The
state of the system at time t is described by the vector X(t) = (X1 (t), . . . , Xn (t)).
For i = 1, . . . , n, let Fi (X(t)), Vi+ (X(t)) and Vi− (X(t)) be functions where Fi (X(t)) is the
rate of appearance of new infections in compartment i, Vi+ (X(t)) is the rate of appearance
of infections in compartment i by all other means, and Vi− (X(t)) is the rate of removal of
infections from compartment i. Let Vi (X(t)) = Vi− (X(t)) − Vi+ (X(t)). Suppose the derivatives
of X1 (t), . . . , Xn (t) can be written as
Xi′ (t) = Fi (X(t)) − Vi (X(t)),

i = 1, . . . , n,

(20)

Subject to the specification of the initial conditions X1 (0), . . . , Xn (0), the unfolding of the
disease dynamics is described by the set of differential equations given by (20).
Let fi (X(t)) = Fi (X(t))−Vi (X(t)). The state X(t) is an equilibrium state if fi (X(t)) = 0, for
i = 1, . . . , n, i.e., if the rates of change of the sizes of all the compartments are equal to zero. An
12

equilibrium state X(t) is said to be a disease-free equilibrium (DFE) if X1 (t) = · · · = Xm (t) = 0,
otherwise it is an endemic equilibrium (EE). A system may have both kinds of equilibrium and
also may have more than one equilibrium of each kind.
A parameter of interest is the basic reproduction ratio (or, number) denoted as R0 . This
parameter determines the stability of the system near a DFE. If R0 < 1, then the system
is asymptotically stable, while if R0 > 1, then the system is asymptotically unstable (see
Theorem 2 of [20]).
The next generation matrix method [3, 20] can be used to calculate the value of R0 . Briefly
the procedure is the following. Suppose X0 is a DFE. Let F be an m × m matrix whose (i, j)-th
entry is ∂Fi /∂Xj evaluated at X0 ; let V be an m × m matrix whose (i, j)-th entry is ∂Vi /∂Xj
evaluated at X0 . Then R0 is the spectral radius (i.e., the maximum of the absolute values of
all the eigen values) of FV−1 .

Release Without Confirmation of Being Negative

Ideally, individuals who are in the detected compartment would be released after they test
negative for the disease. WHO guidelines [15] recommend that confirmed COVID-19 patients
be released only after two negative tests more than 24 hours apart. The discharge policy [11]
of the Government of India also followed this recommendation. A later document [13] of the
Government of India, provided a revised discharge policy. This policy mentions that mild/very
mild/pre-symptomatic and moderate cases may be discharged after 10 days of onset of symptoms and there is no need for testing prior to discharge. Three reasons for the change of the
discharge policy have been mentioned [12], namely other countries have adopted similar changes
in discharge criteria; laboratory surveillance data indicates that after the initial positive results,
patients become negative after a median duration of 10 days; and recent studies suggest that
the viral load peaks in the pre-symptomatic period (2 days before symptoms) and goes down
over the next 7 days. From the later two of the above reasons, one cannot be sure that a patient
released after 10 days has necessarily become non-infectious. Since the median duration is 10
days, there would be patients who remained positive beyond 10 days. Also, the viral load going
down after 2+7 days does not necessarily imply that after 10 days the viral load is such that
the individual is non-infectious. In fact, the document [12] mentions that a patient released
without testing is advised to isolate himself/herself at home for 7 days and to follow certain
precautions.
So, for a patient who is released without confirmation of not being infectious, there remains the possibility of being infectious for a certain number of days after release. To capture
this possibility, we expand the SEAIDR model to include another compartment called pseudorecovered compartment consisting of patients who have been detected to be positive but, have
been released from isolation without being tested to ascertain whether they are negative. This
leads to the SEAIDPR model. Let P be the number of individuals in the pseudo-recovered
compartment. The differential equations describing the dynamics of this model are as follows.

In addition to the parameters of the system in (9), the following parameters are required in (21).

• χ is the transfer rate of individuals from the detected compartment to the pseudo-recovered
compartment.

e0
From Proposition 5, it follows that if β4 /(γ4 + µ) is greater than β3 /(γ3 + µ), then R
is greater than R0 , i.e., the basic reproduction ratio actually increases. Since patients in the
pseudo-recovered compartment have not been confirmed by a test to have become non-infectious
and are also not under strict isolation, the possibility of the condition β4 /(γ4 + µ) > β3 /(γ3 + µ)
cannot be completely ruled out. If this condition indeed happens to hold, then it causes an
adverse effect on the control of the epidemic that might otherwise have been attained through
effective testing and isolation.
In a manner similar to the proof of Theorem 4, we can prove the following result.
Theorem 6. For fixed values of β1 , β2 , β3 , β4 , γ1 , γ2 , γ3 , γ4 , σ1 , σ2 , κ, χ and δ1 ,
e0 →

Let us assume that

e0 given by Theorem 6 is approxi≈ 1 so that the limit of R

ρ =

β4 χ + β3 (γ4 + µ)
.
(γ4 + µ)(γ3 + µ + χ)

(23)

Suppose β3 /(γ3 + µ) < 1. Then by the discussion after Theorem 4, if χ = 0 (i.e., there is no
release from isolation without confirmation of being non-infectious), there is no epidemic. Now,
assume that β4 /(γ4 + µ) > 1, i.e., control in the pseudo-recovered compartment is ineffective.
Then ρ > 1 if and only if
χ >

(γ4 + µ)(γ3 + µ − β3 )
.
β4 − γ4 − µ

(24)

So, if the transfer rate from detected to pseudo-recovered compartment is higher than the
threshold given by (24), then the approximate value of R0 given by ρ in (23) is greater than
1. In other words, if a lot of individuals get transferred from detected to pseudo-recovered
compartment and the control in the pseudo-recovered compartment is not effective, then there
will be an epidemic which might otherwise have been prevented without such transfer taking
place.
