The number of corona virus (COVID-19) infections grows worldwide. In order to create short
term predictions to prepare for the extent of the global pandemic we analyze infection data from
the top 25 affected countries. It is shown that all country-specific infection rates follow a power
law growth behavior and the scaling exponents per country are calculated. We find two different
growth patterns: either steady power law growth from the very beginning with moderate scaling
exponents of 3-5 or explosive power law growth with dramatic scaling exponents of 8-11. In the
case of the USA we even find an exponent of 16.59. By means of data analysis we confirm that
instituting strict measures of lock-downs combined with a strong adherence by the population are
effective means to bring the growth rates down. While many countries have instituted measures
there are only three countries (Denmark, Norway, and South Korea) so far where such lock-downs
led to a significant reduction of the growth rate. In the case of Denmark we calculate the reduction
of the scaling exponents to move from 6.82 to 1.47.
Keywords: power-law scaling, data analysis, epidemic dynamics

INTRODUCTION

Since the identification of a novel novel corona virus
(COVID-19) in Wuhan, China in December 2019 the
virus kept spreading rapidly throughout the world resulting in a global pandemic. As of March 25th 10:30 CET
424,048 people in over 170 countries and regions have
been infected [1]. Due to its high infectivity no slowing
down of the spread is currently in sight. A medical cure
or vaccine is not available yet. This pandemic brings
health care systems worldwide to their limits. The mortality rate is calculated to be 2.5% [2] (comparison: SARS
9.6% [3] and H1N1 influence 0.6%[4]). As the number of
infections rises many governments around the world have
instituted drastic lock-downs and curfews and called for
social distancing and work from home to reduce the rate
at which the virus spreads.
The severity of the infections with the COVID-19 is not
evenly distributed with respect to age. While children
do not seem to be affected much the risk of complications and negative progression seems to increase with increasing age – the elderly population (70+) being affected
most (5-11% mortality rate) [5]. Preexisting health conditions such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, respiratory diseases or cancer [5, 6] and smoking [7] seem to
increase the risk of complications as well.
In order for health care systems to be able to predict
the short term and longer term number of infected patients different models have been used. Epidemiological
analysis models assumes an exponential growth and a
fixed reproduction number n, i.e. the number of people
infected by a sick person. For n > 1 and an incubation
time τ the total number of infections is assumed to grow

exponentially
t

n τ = eat
This approach is the basis for a number of different
predictive studies such as [8, 9].
Other approaches to estimate and predict the number of infections are for example based on ’mechanisticstatistical’ approaches coupling a SIR ODE model describing the unobserved epidemiological dynamics combined with a probabilistic model describing the data acquisition process and a statistical inference method [10],
time series modeling [11], iterative maps [12], or agent
based simulations [13] as well as logistic maps[14, 15].
The problem with exponential approaches is that it assumes that any infected person will infect the same number n more people not taking into account the human
tendency to live and work in relatively closed groups.
Therefore such models tend to overestimate the number of infected people as time progresses, simply because
there are no more new people to infect in the individuals particular group. On the other hand if the disease
were to spread only at the periphery of a compact region of infections then a parabolic growth t2 would be
expected [16]. It is thus to be assumed that after an
initial short exponential growth a slow down should be
observed where the growth of newly infected people increases less than exponentially but probably faster than
t2 as humans are not generally limited to the confines of
a compact region. Given what is known about human
interactions and structures mostly showing small world
phenomena and scale free networks [17, 18] the assumption of a power law behavior is reasonable. Early analysis
in February 2020 [19] showed this indeed to be true. After a short initial exponential growth period the number
of infections, as well as the number of recovered and de-

ceased patients follows a power law:
n(t) = Bt

γ

In the case of the infection spreading in China the exponent γ was determined to be 2.27 [19] and 2.48 [20]
(with more data). In an update to [19] it was suggested
to take the saturation and slow down in the rate of new
infections into account by tapering off the growth with
an exponential slow down as suggested in [21]
t

n(t) = Ctγcutof f e− t0
with γcutof f = 3.09 and t0 = 8.90 days. As a second
parameter t0 is introduced the original scaling exponent
γ changes slightly to γcutof f > γ as a result of the fitting
procedure.

METHOD

All data related to COVID-19 was downloaded from
the publicly available JHU-CSSE (2020) data source provided continuously by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHUCSSE)
[22]. Aggregate data calculation for countries with different regions or states were performed after collecting by a
simple summation over all associated regions or provinces
(for the countries USA, China, and Canada). The data
for Australia was omitted because the aggregated data
in [22] did not correspond to the value given in [1].
We have selected the data sets with the 25 most infections as presented in [1] on 2020-03-24 11:00 CET. The
countries and their infection counts are given in Table I.
We have plotted the data for each country in a loglog plot and determined the range of power-law behavior. From there the scaling exponent for each country
was extracted. As an example the data for Germany is
shown in a log-log plot in Fig. 1. The range used to
extract the scaling exponent is denoted with two vertical
lines. The best fit line (determined by linear regression)
is superimposed on the data points. In Fig. 2 the short
term prediction of the total number of infections is superimposed onto the data points for the the next 7 days.
The scaling exponent for Germany was found to be
γGermany = 11.59.
In order to cross-check the validity of the determined
scaling exponent we have recalculated the scaling exponent for China in the power law range and found
γChina = 2.20 in excellent agreement with [19]. Fig. 3
shows the log-log plot for China.
Since no country apart from China exhibits signs of a
saturation we have used the simple power law fit instead
of the cutoff power law fit [21] to determine all scaling
exponents.

with a smaller scaling exponent. The total number
is still increasing as a power law but more slowly
than before. We have found only three countries
where this was the case: Denmark, Norway, and
South Korea.
3. Saturation stage: the power law regime has
ended and the total number of infections slows
down to small numbers close to 0. This was only
the case for China (see Fig. 3 and Fig. 4).

1. Growth stage: the total number of infections is in
the power law range and a single scaling exponent
could be extracted. Currently most countries fall
into this category.

To demonstrate the slow down stage we present the data
from Denmark in Fig. 5 as a log-log plot and Fig. 6
as short term predictions for the total number of infections. We find γDenmark,1 = 6.82 pre-intervention and
γDenmark,2 = 1.47 post-intervention. It is, however, important to note that the data so far clearly does not show
a saturation – merely a slow down into a different power
law regime with a different scaling exponent.
We have plotted all country data in a log-log plot starting from the respective day of the first infection in Fig. 7.
If more than one person was recorded to be infected on
the first day we have subtracted the difference to 1 from
the data set to plot all the data from the same origin.
Since we are only interested in the power law exponent
in the range of large total numbers of infections this subtraction did not affect the outcome of the plot and the
result. Since, however, the number of recorded infections
on the first day in China was 548 the data points from
China do not follow the other countries’ general development.
As can be seen in Fig. 7 the growth rate of the total number of infections can be roughly divided into two
distinct growth patterns:

2. Slow down stage: due to government imposed
strict measures to slow down the spread of the virus
the initial power law range split into a second one

1. steady power law growth from the beginning in the
blue (online) regime where we have found a scaling
exponent of γsteady ≈4.8 (2 − 6).

RESULTS

We have extracted the scaling exponents for all the
countries in Table I. As of 2020-03-24 there was only
China which showed a saturation of the total number of
infections. All the other countries have not reached yet
such a level. We could distinguish three different stages:

behaviors are shown between two vertical lines. The best fit

We find γDenmark,1 = 6.82 pre-intervention and γDenmark,2 =

starting from the day of the first infection. Since the first
recorded data from China is 548 infections the China data
does not show the same increase as the other curves that
started with 1. Two distinct growth patterns can be distinguished: blue range (online) steady power law growth from
the very beginning with a γsteady ≈4.8 (2 − 6) and red range
(online) with a long incubation time and an explosive power
law growth with a γexplosive ≈10 (8 − 11).

Figure 8. Scaling exponents per country sorted in ascending
order. Countries with slow down stages or saturation stages
have the post-intervention lock-down (post-LD) scaling exponent γ2 plotted next to the inital γ.

CONCLUSIONS

2. explosive power law growth in the red (online) regime: after a long incubation time with
hardly any infections the total number of infections increases rapidly with a scaling exponent of
γexplosive ≈10 (8 − 16).

The exact calculations of the power law scaling exponents are given in Table II. The scaling exponents are
displayed graphically in Fig. 8.

Our initial assumption was that cultural habits of proximity and cleanliness such as the habit of washing hands
as well as the geographical location would influence the
speed at which the total number of infection increases
but at least on a per country comparison such a distinction was not discernible. Neither cultural habits nor
social distance and personal space [23] seem to have a
noticeable influence. Also the latitude and the according
temperature differences do not seem to play any role.
A puzzling fact is that neighboring countries do not
seem to exhibit similar scaling exponents such as Bel-

slow down stage or a saturation stage after government interventions and lock-downs have a second scaling exponent

scaling exponent γ from steady growth to explosive growth.

We have confirmed that the implementation of lockdowns had an impact on the spread – however, not the
governmental sanctions per se but – obviously – the adherence to it by the people. Notably there was hardly
any noticeable impact on the lock-down in Italy whereas
the measures in Denmark and Norway were very effective. The complete lock-down of Wuhan in China seemed
to have been so far the most effective measure, however,
China is two months ahead of all the other countries so no

direct comparison can be drawn at the moment. South
Korea deserves a special mention since the wide range
testing of a large part of the population and consequent
isolation of confirmed cases seems to have prevented any
further growth (dropping from 10.88 to 0.83).
A puzzling data point is Iran which has the second
lowest scaling exponent (2.26) almost identical to China
(2.20). As Iran to our knowledge did not introduce
any severe and strict measures and lock-downs we are
tempted to believe that the reported numbers do not
correspond to the actual numbers of infected people in
that country. Perhaps many people in Iran are not able
to seek medical attention or prefer not to?
It is worth noting that the currently highest spread is
found in the USA with a scaling exponent of 16.59. We
do not know why the outbreak in the US was so explosive.
We have found that the stricter the lock-down measures have been instituted and the higher the adherence
of the population to those measures the faster the exponent dropped and the more noticeable pre- and postmeasure regimes were separated.
Countries where there were no strict measures (or not
yet) and no adherence to those measures if implemented
or if they were introduced very late in the process have
scaling exponents of ∼ 8 − 11 (USA 16.59). Countries
with earlier lock-down measures and stricter adherence
have exponents of ∼ 3 − 5.
In conclusion the data supports evidence that the
spread is not exponential but can be described as a power
law which indicates that all investigated countries and societies seem to be organized as small world networks and
show scale-free behavior in the total number of infections. Different governmental measures and adherence
of the population to those measures leads to strikingly
different growth rates and scaling exponents. The power
law approach fits the recorded data very well and allows
accurate short term predictions of the total number of infections which allows health care systems to prepare and
to effectively plan necessary staff, infrastructure and in
particular intensive care units and to triage new patients
more efficiently.
