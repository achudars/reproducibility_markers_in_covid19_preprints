Abstract
We propose an SEIARD mathematical model to investigate the
current outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Mexico. We
conduct a detailed analysis of this model and demonstrate its application using publicly reported data. We calculate the basic reproduction
number (R0 ) via the next-generation matrix method, and we estimate
the per day infection, death and recovery rates. We calibrate the parameters of the SEIARD model to the reported data by minimizing
the sum of squared errors and attempt to forecast the evolution of
the outbreak until June 2020. Our results estimate that the peak of
the epidemic in Mexico will be around May 2, 2020. Our model incorporates the importance of considering the aysmptomatic infected
individuals, because they represent the majority of the infected population (with symptoms or not) and they could play a huge role in
spreading the virus without any knowledge.

Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic originated in Wuhan, China in December 2019.
Since then, the number of cases has accelerated in China and subsequently
all over the world. The causative agent is a new betacoronavirus related to

1

the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome virus (MERS-CoV) and the Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome virus (SARS-CoV).
On January 30, the World Health Organization (WHO) formally declared
the outbreak of novel coronavirus a Global Public Health Emergency of International Concern. In [4], Cruz-Pacheco et al. estimated the arrival of the
infectious outbreak to Mexico between March 20 and March 30, 2020. Other
models for predicting the evolution of COVID-19 outbreak in Mexico have
been proposed in [12, 1, 13].
Compartmental models have been used for studying the spread of the
COVID-19 pandemic in several countries, such as China [9, 8, 6, 3], Italy [6,
3], India [10] and Brazil [2].

Mathematical model

In this work, we will use a compartmental differential equation model for
the spread of COVID-19 in Mexico. The model monitors the dynamics of
six subpopulations, which are: susceptible (S(t)), exposed (E(t)), infected
(I(t)), asymptomatic (A(t)), recovered (R(t)) and dead (D(t)).
The model simulations will be carried out with the following assumptions:
(a) Individuals of 12 years old and higher are susceptible to the virus.
(b) The susceptible and infected individuals are homogeneous in the population.
(c) At first, no interventions were applied to stop the spread of COVID-19.
(d) The population is constant; no births are allowed, and we only take
into account the fatalities associated to COVID-19.
Figure 1 shows a diagram of the flow through the compartmental subpopulations.
Susceptible population S(t): This subpopulation will remain constant
because recruiting individuals is not allowed in our model. The susceptible
population will decrease after an infection, an acquired characteristic due to
the interaction with an infected person or asymptomatic one. The transmission coefficients will be βI and βA. The rate of change of the susceptible
population is expressed in the following equation:

die at a rate δ. This is the only population that acknowledges death. Thus,

(3)

Asymptomatic population A(t): This population is considered an infected population, but the individuals do not develop the common symptoms
of COVID-19. Asymptomatic individuals are important to model because
they have the ability to spread the virus without knowing; they are produced at a rate 1 − p and recover at a rate γ. Consequently,
dA
= (1 − p)wE − γA.

Recovered populations RI (t) and RA (t): All individuals infected with
symptoms or not will recover at a rate γ. We subdivide the recovered population in two compartments: individuals who recover after having symptoms
(RI ) and individuals who recover from asymptomatic infection (RA ). Hence

We also observe that N := S + E + I + A + RI + RA + D is constant,
where N is the size of the population modeled.
The rest of this work is organized as follows. In Section 3, we calculate
the basic reproduction number of the model. We present in Section 4 the
assumptions and procedure we used for the implementation of our model, and
we describe in Section 5 the results obtained when performing simulations
with the best fit parameters.

Basic reproduction number

There exists a disease-free equilibrium, which is given by S = N , E = I =
A = RI = RA = D = 0, and we will denote it by x0 . We calculate the
basic reproduction number R0 based on this steady state. We use the nextgeneration matrix method proposed by Diekmann et al. [5]. To find R0 , we
must solve the equation R0 = ρ(F V −1 ), where F and V are the derivatives
of the new infections matrix F and the transition matrix V, respectively,

Implementation

To describe the evolution of the epidemic in Mexico taking into account the
social distancing measures taken by the government, we will assume that the
infection rate, recovery rate and death rate are time-dependent functions,
similar to those used in [3].
To model the effect of epidemic control measures, which cause the number
of contacts per person per unit time to decrease as the epidemic progresses,
we describe the infection rate by the function


t
+ β1 ,
β(t) = β0 exp −
τβ
where β0 + β1 is the initial infection rate. This rate decreases exponentially
to the value β1 with a characteristic time of decrease τβ .
The time of recovery for patients may also vary with time due to the
medical staff improving their therapeutic procedures. Hence, we will assume
that the recovery rate is modeled by the function
γ(t) = γ0 +

γ1
,
1 + exp(−t + τγ )

where γ0 is the recovery rate at time zero, and γ0 + γ1 is the recovery rate at
a later time, which is reached after τγ days of adaptation.
Lastly, the death rate may decrease with time due to the adaptation of
the pathogen or the development of more advanced treatments. Hence, we
can model this with the function


t
δ(t) = δ0 exp −
+ δ1 ,
τδ
where δ0 + δ1 is the initial death rate, which decreases to the value δ1 with a
characteristic time τδ .
If we replace the constant parameters β, δ and γ in equation (8) with the
aforementioned time-dependent functions, we can define
Rd (t) =

β(t)(1 − p)
β(t)p
+
δ(t) + γ(t)
γ(t)

as the effective daily reproduction ratio, which measures the number of new
infections produced by a single infected individual per day, taking into account the evolving public health interventions and available resources [11].
The set of differential equations was solved using Matlab 2016b with the
ode45 solver, which is based on an explicit Runge-Kutta (4,5) formula. Our
6

model was calibrated using the cases of COVID-19 in Mexico. The data were
collected in the period since the first reported case of COVID-19 in Mexico
(February 28) until April 14 from the open source repository of Johns Hopkins
University [7].
The optimization of parameters to describe the outbreak of COVID-19 in
Mexico were fitted by minimizing the Sum of Squared Errors (SSE), in such a
way that the solutions for D(t) and RI (t) obtained by the model approximate
the reported values for deaths and recovered cases, respectively, while the sum
I(t) + RI (t) + D(t) approximates the cumulative number of infected cases
with symptoms. Since the Mexican government does not keep a record of the
number of asymptomatic cases, we assume that the asymptomatic infected
population is about nine times larger than the population with symptoms,
based on government estimations.
We applied three searches to minimize the SSE function: a gradient-based
method, a gradient-free algorithm, and finally, a gradient-based method.
This method was necessary to obtain the local minimum. We adapted the
code from Caccavo [3] for our mathematical model.

Results

The predicted evolution of the outbreak for COVID-19 in Mexico can be seen
in Figure 2. The parameters of the mathematical model were fitted with the
experimental data provided by a daily update from the Mexican Ministry of
Health. By adjusting the data from the period from March 12, 2020 to April
14, 2020, we simulated the daily new COVID-19 cases in Mexico until June
4, 2020. The peak of the infection modeled will be around the first week
of May, with 4400 infected individuals with the known developed symptoms
and roughly 37 000 infected individuals that will not develop any kind of
symptoms.
The values of the best fit parameters are given in Table 1. Figure 3 shows
the variation of the infection rate β(t), recovery rate γ(t) and death rate δ(t)
with respect to time. Using these values for the parameters, we can calculate
the effective daily reproductive ratio Rd (t) for each day (see Figure 4). Our
simulation shows that Rd (t) will become less than 1 around April 29, 2020.
In Figures 5–8, we carried out the simulation with the best fit parameters.
We show a comparison of the cumulative number of infections (Figure 5) and
deaths (Figure 6) with the reported data. We also plot the number of active
symptomatic infections and asymptomatic infections in Figures 7 and 8.
As we can see, the population of asymptomatic individuals represents
roughly 90% of all possible infections. The behavior of the asymptomatic

population is important because they have the capacity to spread the virus
without developing any symptoms, and public health interventions should
focus on these individuals. By this date, Mexico is located in phase 2 (community transmission) and has declared a national emergency and asked the
citizenship to stay in their houses. By declaring self-quarantine to all individuals, we could separate the healthy population from the asymptomatic
population and prevent the spread of the virus more rapidly. This action
will only gain time in the number of infections and help avoiding the saturation of hospitals. If we control the population of infected individuals, we will
prevent the death of many individuals, and the hospitals will have sufficient
supplies to mitigate the severity of symptoms in patients with any type of
chronic degenerative disease.
It is of great importance to explain some of the parameters estimated in
the optimization section. τβ = 27.86 represents the number of contacts per
person per time. Even though at this time this value is high, by declaring
social distancing measures the Mexican government intends to decrease the
value of this parameter. We will view this decrease once we reach the peak
of infection. τγ gives us information of the average recovery rate between
the first day of the appearance of symptoms and death, which is τγ = 11.28.
This means that some infected individuals can develop more complicated
symptoms, eventually they will take much more time to recover than others.
As well, it represents the average time of supplies a patient will cost if they
develop chronic symptoms like pneumonia or other pulmonary complications.
