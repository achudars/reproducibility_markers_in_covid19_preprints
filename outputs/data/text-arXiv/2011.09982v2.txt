ABSTRACT
The electric power grid is a complex cyberphysical energy system (CPES) in which information and
communication technologies (ICT) are integrated into the operations and services of the power grid
infrastructure. The growing number of Internet-of-things (IoT) high-wattage appliances, such as air
conditioners and electric vehicles, being connected to the power grid, together with the high dependence
of ICT and control interfaces, make CPES vulnerable to high-impact, low-probability load-changing cyberattacks. Moreover, the side-effects of the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrate a modification of electricity
consumption patterns with utilities experiencing significant net-load and peak reductions. These unusual
sustained low load demand conditions could be leveraged by adversaries to cause frequency instabilities in
CPES by compromising hundreds of thousands of IoT-connected high-wattage loads. This paper presents a
feasibility study of the impacts of load-changing attacks on CPES during the low loading conditions caused
by the lockdown measures implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic. The load demand reductions
caused by the lockdown measures are analyzed using dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), focusing on
the March-to-July 2020 period and the New York region as the most impacted time period and location
in terms of load reduction due to the lockdowns being in full execution. Our feasibility study evaluates
load-changing attack scenarios using real load consumption data from the New York Independent System
Operator (NYISO) and shows that an attacker with sufficient knowledge and resources could be capable of
producing frequency stability problems, with frequency excursions going up to 60.5 Hz and 63.4 Hz, when
no mitigation measures are taken.

I. INTRODUCTION

The wide-scale deployment of information, sensing, and
communication technologies in electric power systems (EPS)
contribute to various power grid functionalities. For example,
Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices are widely utilized in industrial assets to provide control and monitoring support for
supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA), advanced
metering infrastructure (AMI), and other types of communication and control infrastructures. As a result, during the last
few years, the efficiency, robustness, and reliability of cyberphysical energy systems (CPES) have been greatly improved.
VOLUME 4, 2020

At the same time, the vulnerabilities inherited from the IoT
ecosystem have expanded the CPES threat surface. The rollout of customer-end IoT-controllable high-wattage devices
and distributed energy resources (DERs) unlocks new vulnerabilities on the demand-side of CPES and opens new
avenues for adversaries to launch large-scale coordinated
remote attacks on power system’s assets. For example, DERs
or modern controllable loads use IoT devices to coordinate
their operations with other CPES (e.g., via IoT-based smart
meters or other home assistants such as Amazon Echo and
Google Home). Naturally, these IoT interfaces become great

attack vectors due to the countless vulnerabilities engendered
by the complex IoT supply chains. Insecure remote login
passwords of IoT devices can be exploited for malware
infection as in the Mirai botnet which, in 2016, successfully
compromised thousands of household IoT devices in a distributed denial-of-service campaign [1]. Firmware updates
are another source of contamination [2], making consumer
devices such as printers [3] and relay controllers [4], [5]
vulnerable to firmware attacks. Ghost domain name system
(DNS) attacks can infect IoT devices by routing them to
malicious DNS servers [6]. Attacks on electricity consumers
and DERs are essentially facilitated by the negligence of the
customers that use default or weak security credentials [7].
Adversaries capable of compromising IoT-controllable
high wattage loads and DERs of CPES can maliciously affect
the stability of the grid, causing degradation of grid equipment or even power outages and large-scale blackouts [8]. Although currently hypothetical due to the low penetration rates
of high-wattage loads and DERs (prosumers), these types of
attacks are projected to become realistic in the near future
as the penetration rates are anticipated to grow exponentially
[9]. Due to the distributed nature of load-changing attacks,
which disturb the system from the demand-side, as well as
the various ways of attack payload weaponization [10], it
is difficult for system operators to detect and mitigate such
attacks in order to maintain frequency stability and ensure
that voltage and frequency levels are within operational limits. In addition, IoT-based attacks to CPES do not require
operational knowledge of the power system and are very easy
to repeat.
Starting in early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has directly affected businesses and individuals, significantly increasing their dependency on the Internet (e.g., remote work).
This reliance expanded the number of cyberspace-related
incidents as malicious attempts have proliferated to exploit
this sudden unplanned shift in society. COVID-19 drives
criminal and political cyberattacks across networks, cloud,
and mobile phones; pandemic-related attacks increased exponentially from under 5,000 per week in February 2020, to
over 200,000 per week in late April 2020 [11]. For instance,
COVID-19 scams often use phishing emails and malicious
websites to promote fake vaccines and cures, fraudulent charity drives, and false information on government aid, while
at the same time delivering malware to unsuspecting users
and insecure services. Table 1 shows a summary of some of
the most prominent threats and vulnerabilities exacerbated
due to the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measures.
Example attack categories range from malware, Zoom bombing, and phishing attacks all the way to sophisticated critical
infrastructure attacks that could compromise the integrity of
the power grid. Due to the barrage of cyberattacks during
COVID-19, the malicious exploitation potential of ICT and
control interfaces of IoT-controllable loads could, more than
ever before, constitute a realistic cyber-threat to power grid
operations.

II. RELATED WORK & CONTRIBUTIONS
A. LOAD-CHANGING ATTACKS

Existing work on load-changing attacks1 has focused on the
modeling and analysis of attack vectors in which system
conditions, e.g., electric power demand and electricity prices,
make use of forecasting models which do not account for
sudden reductions in peak demand and delivered energy nor
modification of consumption patterns [24]. The authors in
[25] have demonstrated that load-changing attacks can cause
controlled load shedding but not cascading failures. Sudden
IoT attacks increasing the system load demand will cause
under frequency load shedding (UFLS) control to split the
frequencies of the buses into islands of different operating regions of the grid when the system cannot handle the load and
the frequency drops. In [22], the authors investigated the feasibility of a load-changing attack using compromised electric
vehicles (EVs). After canvassing publicly available data, they
recovered the exact configuration of the high-voltage power
grid and public EV charging stations (EVCS) in Manhattan,
NY. Using this publicly available data, the work designed a
data-driven attack mechanism requiring from around 500 to
about 5,000 compromised Tesla EVs, depending on grid conditions and attack parameters, to destabilize the frequency,
leading to a major blackout. Furthermore, a dynamic loadchanging attack against power system stability is studied in
[20]. The authors formulated the problem as a close-loop
attack in which a dilettante adversary controls the changes
in the compromised load based on the system frequency
feedback.
B. IMPACT OF COVID-19 IN POWER SYSTEMS

The recent novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) severely
affected the entire globe as a public health and economic
crisis. At the same time, the COVID-19 pandemic caused
substantial changes in the operations of bulk power systems
and electricity markets. One of the most evident effects of
the health crisis on EPS is the reduction in peak demand
and consumed energy; electricity demand remains lower than
typical expectations during the pandemic in many regions of
1 Prior work has used the names “manipulation of demand via IoT attack
(MadIoT)” [8], “dynamic load-altering attack (DLAA)” [20], “coordinated
load changing attack” [21], “demand-side cyberattacks” [22], and “power
botnet attacks” [23]. Our terminology of load-changing attacks refers to such
attack strategies aiming in a coordinated way to control IoT connected highwattage appliances and DERs.

the world. For example, the electricity demand in June 2020
in EU countries was 10% below the 2019 levels. In Italy,
the 2019-2020 year-on-year change in electricity demand,
weather corrected, reached 28% during the 15th week of
2020 [26]. Similarly in Spain, the electricity consumption
decreased by 13.5% during the March-to-April period when
compared to the average load consumption of the last five
years due to the lockdown measures implemented to stop the
spread of the COVID-19 pandemic [27]. The reduction was
mainly observed during working days with an average 14.5%
reduction while during weekends the reduction observed was
around 10.6%. In the African region, one example is the
study conducted by researchers in [28], where an exploratory
research aimed at investigating the impacts caused by the
COVID-19 pandemic in the South African power grid was
performed. According to the authors, the electricity consumption and peak demand in South Africa decreased by
28.1% and 20.2%, respectively; exacerbating issues in the
reliability of the South African electric grid. Furthermore,
in the East Asian region, and more specifically in China, a
13% electricity demand drop, during the lockdown period,
was observed [29].
COVID-19 lockdown measures are also being analyzed for
several cities and regions of the United States (U.S.). One
example is the study conducted in [29], where researchers
found that New York City’s (NYC) hourly demand in midApril 2020 ranged from roughly 5% to 21% below typical
levels while reductions in electric consumption averaged
21% below expected values during the 8 am hour. Similarly,
researchers in [30] explored the impacts that the stay-at-home
orders (SAHO), issued in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, had on the regional electricity generation fuel mixes in
three major Regional Transmission Operators (RTOs) in the
U.S., i.e., New York Independent System Operator (NYISO),
Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), and
Pennsylvania Jersey Maryland (PJM). The authors use of
the Shannon-Wiener diversity index, an index designed to
measure the fuel diversity of a generation portfolio, in order
to compare the before and after SAHO periods in terms of
electricity generation fuel mixes. Even though they did not
find any significant difference in the average diversity index
between the two periods, the variance (i.e., σ 2 ) of the index
for MISO, NYISO, and PJM was significant, with a lower
35% value for the first two RTOs and an 8% higher value for
the latter.
The impact on energy consumption and peak demand
as well as the alternation of the consumption patterns has
brought numerous challenges for utilities and system operators. Different practices have been followed to proactively
mitigate technical issues and maintain normal operating conditions of CPES [24]. Examples include switching off and on
automatic voltage control systems, capacitors, and reactors,
utilizing STATCOM (static synchronous compensator) and
UPFC (unified power flow controller) devices to absorb
reactive power, or the use of automatic UFLS and reserve
arrangements, among others. In [31], a comprehensive reVOLUME 4, 2020

view of the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic for the
electric industry is presented. In this review, the impacts that
the pandemic caused in the power balance and electricity
prices are explored, with the main focus on exploring how the
uncertainty of load demand, voltage violation conditions, and
other challenges have posed higher pressure on system operators and system maintenance. According to the authors, in
most countries that applied lockdown measures, the total load
demand decreased, and this, in turn, increased the uncertainty
of load and posed higher requirements for load forecasting
accuracy and system reserves. A similar study is presented in
[32], where authors explore the impacts of the pandemic on
the U.S. electricity demand and supply. The work performs
an analysis of the electricity consumption data up to the
end of May 2020 and examines some of the variables (e.g.,
daily peak, demand ramp rate, demand forecast error, and net
electricity interchange, etc.) that could indicate stress on the
power grid. The study conducted is limited to three states:
California, Florida, and New York, and concluded that the
effect of the pandemic may not only be a simple reduction
in the load, but there exist noticeable differences among the
examined regions during the SAHOs. Focusing on smaller
electric grids, the research in [33] presents a detailed study
regarding the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic had on
the operation of the Estonian, Israeli, and Finnish grids with
a special focus on three major effects: changing patterns in
generation and consumption, frequency stability, and high
integration of renewables. The authors concluded that the
reduction of load consumption during a pandemic-type event
affects considerably the management and control of generation units and leads to voltage and frequency deviations
that reduce the reliability of the system. For these reasons,
the addition of tools and regulation devices designed to
manage abnormal events and mitigate reliability problems is
suggested in the long-term planning of the grid infrastructure.
C. CONTRIBUTIONS & METHODOLOGY

This paper focuses on analyzing the feasibility of loadchanging attacks in power systems during the 2020 COVID19 pandemic while using the previous year (2019) as a
baseline. The methodological approach to investigate the
feasibility of load-changing attacks in CPES is presented
in Fig. 1. The contributions of this paper, highlighting also
the differences between the proposed work and the reviewed
literature, can be summarized as follows:
•

A methodology for investigating the feasibility of loadchanging attacks in CPES during pandemic-type events
is proposed as depicted in Fig. 1. The proposed methodological approach consists of three main steps: (i) An
analysis of the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown
measures in load consumption, (ii) Modeling of realistic
high-impact, low-probability load-changing attacks, and
(iii) A feasibility analysis that evaluates the impact of
the modeled load-changing attacks in a compromised
CPES.

In order to accomplish (i), dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) and statistical analyses of load consumption
data during the COVID-19 outbreak are performed. The
objective of these analyses is identifying dynamic load
patterns that could cause abnormal loading conditions
in CPES, and thus create vulnerable circumstances that
attackers could use in their advantage to perform loadchanging attacks. Using these analyses, we are able to
identify the most affected U.S. region and time periods
by recognizing spatio-temporal patterns.
In order to realize (ii), mathematical and threat model
formulations are designed in order to methodically examine a realistic high-impact, low-probability threat targeted at creating frequency instabilities. We investigate
the possibility of attackers compromising power system stability taking into consideration abnormal loading
conditions caused by lockdown measures as the ones
observed during the COVID-19 pandemic.
In order to accomplish (iii), the analyses and threat
model developed are used in conjunction to experimentally examine and simulate load-changing attack scenarios. The investigation demonstrates that such events
can adversely impact the frequency of CPES during the
decreased load demand conditions caused by COVID19 lockdown measures.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section
III, the impact of the lockdown measures is evaluated based
on the COVID-19 pandemic response timeline using DMD
and statistical analyses. The most affected region in the U.S.
is identified and then used jointly with the threat model
presented in Section IV. In Section IV, the threat model
of load-changing attacks and the operational standards for
frequency stability are presented. Section V presents the

experimental setup and results of the case studies used to
evaluate the feasibility of load-changing attacks during low
net-load demand periods, as the ones observed during the
COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, Section VI presents conclusions and future work.
III. ANALYZING THE IMPACT OF COVID-19 LOCKDOWN
MEASURES IN EPS THROUGHOUT THE U.S.

Before examining the feasibility of load-changing attacks
in CPES during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important
to first understand the impact that the lockdown measures,
due to the novel COVID-19 pandemic, had in the electricity
consumption around the U.S. In order to understand this
impact, we obtained and analyzed electricity consumption
data obtained from a cross-domain open-source data hub,
COVID-EMDA [34]. This data hub integrates weather, satellite imaging, mobile device location, and electricity market
data from seven regions that cover some of the top hardest-hit
states in the U.S, i.e., California, Texas, Midcontinent Central
region, Kansas, Illinois, New York, and Massachusetts. In
this paper, we focus our attention in analyzing seven main
representative urban areas that belong to the major RTOs
in the U.S. Urban areas have been the most affected areas
by COVID-19 spread and lockdown measures; according to
the United Nations (UN), they have become the epicentre
of the pandemic with more than 90% of all reported cases
[35], [36]. The representative urban areas analyzed and their
corresponding RTO are:

A. COVID-19 OUTBREAK TIMELINE & QUANTIFICATION
OF LOAD DEMAND CHANGES DUE TO COVID-19: 2019
VS. 2020

In order to understand the load demand changes and the
magnitude of the COVID-19 impacts across the seven major
regions examined, we first analyze the possible reasons of
why such changes occurred. Thus, we compiled a series of
important events, in a timeline, that correlate with the load
variation during the outbreak. Fig. 2 shows the timeline for
the different regions analyzed. As seen in this timeline, the
majority of the lockdown measures in the analyzed states
occurred during the March-to-May period of 2020. Also, it
should be noted that re-openings in most of these places
occurred during the second and third weeks of May. Based
on this timeline, we selected the period ranging from March
1st to June 30th as the one to compare with the previous
year (2019) for load consumption comparisons and impact
analysis.
In Fig. 3, we can observe how the electricity consumption
in the major U.S. zones and RTOs during the COVID-19
pandemic of 2020 was notably reduced, compared to 2019,
during the period of March 1st to June 30th. The most
affected time periods are the ones between 6 am and 12 pm in
all regions. Also, the most affected city due to the lockdown
measures is clearly NYC since a significant load demand
reduction can be observed at all times during the lockdown
period. In regions such as Central-MISO and NYC-NYISO,
overall low net-load demand conditions can be observed
throughout the day. In NYC, the highest load difference
between the average load of 2019 and 2020 is found at the
VOLUME 4, 2020

time period of 11 am to 12 pm, where a load difference of
around 860 MW exists (around 10% of the total maximum
load). Similarly, in Central-MISO, the highest load difference
between the average load of 2019 and 2020 is found at the
time period of 7 am to 8 am, where the load difference is
around 2,020 MW (around 5% of the total maximum load).
These results indicate that NYC is one of the most affected
regions by the COVID-19 lockdown measures, and thus, we
focus our attention on this region.
B. DISCOVERING DYNAMIC PATTERNS IN THE
REDUCTION OF LOAD CONSUMPTION CAUSED BY
COVID-19 ACROSS THE U.S.

DMD is a recently developed method capable of performing spatio-temporal decomposition of high-dimensional data
[37]. This process captures snapshots or measurements in
time from a given system and decomposes them into dynamic
modes or patterns that can be used to explain the system’s
behavior. In our case, our ‘system’ is determined by the load
consumption data during the time period of the COVID-19
outbreak of some of the most affected regions in the U.S. In
order to apply DMD, we structure the load consumption data:
xm+1 represents future measurements (snapshots) and xm
represents previous measurements from the vector x ∈ Rn ;
where n represents the number of spatial points at each
snapshot. For data pairs in x, a best-fit linear operator matrix
A is defined as:
xm+1 = Axm

(1)

where xm is equal to xm = [x1 , x2 , ...xn ] at snapshot m.
In our case, the spatial points n represent the individually
normalized load consumption values for different affected
regions across the U.S. It is important to note that according

to [37], the relationship presented in Eq. (1) does not need
to be exact since other theoretical works have demonstrated
the approximation of A (i.e., the full high-dimensional system matrix) as Ã (i.e., the rank-reduced representation) can
be used for complex non-linear system applications [38].
This approximation is useful as it avoids the computational
complexity of performing the full eigendecomposition of the
high-dimensional system matrix. Using this relationship, we
can essentially separate our dynamic system into datasets:



X = x1 x2 ... xm−1

(2)



X0 = x2 x3 ... xm

(3)

where X and X0 ∈ Rn×m−1 . Combining Eq. (1), (2), and (3),
the relationship of the states in our system can be described
as:
X0 ≈ AX

(4)

where the DMD modes, also called dynamic modes of the
evaluated dynamical system, are the eigenvectors of A, while
each DMD mode corresponds to a particular eigenvalue of
the matrix A [37]. However, as mentioned before, in a highdimensional system, the matrix A may be intractable to be
analyzed directly. So, in order to avoid the full eigendecomposition of A, DMD makes use of its rank-reduced representation in terms of the proper orthogonal decompositionprojected matrix, Ã. All the steps necessary for performing
DMD in a given dataset are presented below:

1) Perform the singular value decomposition (SVD) of X:
X ≈ UΣV∗

where * denotes the conjugate transpose, and U ∈
Cn×r , Σ ∈ Cr×r , and V ∈ Cm×r . Here, r is the rank
of the reduced (truncated) SVD approximation to X.
For more details regarding the process and benefits of
truncation in DMD see [37].
2) Calculate the matrix A using the pseudoinverse of X
obtained using SVD:

3) Compute the eigendecomposition of Ã:
ÃW = WΛ

where the columns of W are eigenvectors and Λ is the
diagonal matrix that contains the respective eigenvalues.

the patterns of the DMD modes, are determined by the
columns of Φ. Φ is then computed as follows:
Φ = X0 VΣ−1 W

(8)

The utilization of the discussed DMD method can identify
coherent spatio-temporal patterns (modes – Φ) in the dataset
by calculating the respective eigenvectors and eigenvalues.
Each eigenvalue describes the growth or decay and oscillatory patterns observed in each dynamic mode (eigenvector)
identified in the dynamic system. Therefore, DMD is applied to spatio-temporal raw load consumption data, across
different regions/cities in the U.S., in order to identify the
effects and patterns that the COVID-19 outbreak caused in
load consumption reduction across these regions. The ∆t
chosen are 1-hour and 1-day resolutions so that the variations
of the patterns across the selected temporal scales can be
easily translated to load consumption variations during the
different COVID-19 related events.
The first step performed in our examination is a spatiotemporal analysis designed to capture the variations in load
consumption patterns between the years 2019 and 2020. As
mentioned previously, we focus on the March-to-July time

the load consumption data for NYC. The x-axis represents the temporal dimension in terms of days during the time-period
of March 1st to July 8th (130 days) for both the 2019 and 2020 periods combined and the y-axis represents another temporal
dimension that covers the different times during the day (12 am to 11pm). The plots shown in the lower left quadrant show the

periods of the aforementioned years since these were the
periods when COVID-19-related actions, such as SoE and
SAHO, were in full execution. To perform the proposed
DMD analysis, we processed and organized the raw load
consumption data from the seven different regions (cities)
across the U.S. This data is used to create X and X0 matrices,
where m (temporal snapshots) represents different days in
the time-period evaluated (March 1 to July 8th), and n
(spatial) represents the different regions/cities evaluated (LA,
Chicago, NYC, MISO-Central, Boston, KCK, and Houston).
Fig. 4 shows the raw data and outputs of the DMD process
executed using the 2019 and 2020 load consumption data,
respectively. As seen in this figure, there are significant
differences in the load consumption from the years 2019
and 2020 for most of the cities evaluated. By analyzing the
temporal and spatial modes identified by the DMD process,
we can characterize how the COVID-19 countermeasures
impacted load consumption patterns in the seven studied regions. In essence, we can observe, through load consumption
data, how COVID-19 was spreading through the U.S. and
along the response timeline. In addition, we can also observe
that, from the seven cities analyzed, NYC was one of the most
8

affected regions in terms of significant load variation across
the U.S. Cross-referencing these results with the timeline
presented in Fig. 2, Fig. 4 clearly depicts how this low loadvalley period is more prominent during the NYC SoE and
SAHO events.
The second analysis using the DMD approach is performed based on temporal load consumption data available
from NYC. According to the statistical analysis performed
in the previous subsection and the spatio-temporal DMD
analysis of all the U.S. regions, the NY region was one of
the most affected by the COVID-19 lockdown measures in
terms of load consumption variation. In Fig. 5, it can be
observed how the DMD process is applied in order to identify
temporal modes for load consumption during the daily 24
hours and, at the same time, identify the temporal modes
in a slower frequency rate (i.e., 1-day resolution) during the
March-to-July time periods of 2019 and 2020. The lower left
side of the figure shows the eigenvalues, identified modes,
and eigenvalue spectrum outputted by the DMD process
while the right side shows the reconstructions of some of
the most prominent modes that characterize each temporal
domain. Noticeable differences between the 2019 and 2020

load consumption can be seen in the figures shown on the
right side. For example, based on modes 1 to 3, we observe
how the 2020 data is significantly lower (represented with
a darker blue) during the morning hours of the day, while
modes 5 to 8 show how the evening load is flattened out as the
lockdown measures were implemented during the COVID-19
response timeline. On the other hand, the plot reconstructing
modes 9 to 12 shows a clear side-by-side comparison that
demonstrates how, during the same time period of 2019 vs.
2020, load demand significantly decreased as the COVID-19
outbreak worsened throughout NYC.
C. IMPACT OF COVID-19 LOCKDOWN MEASURES IN
NYC NET-LOAD DEMAND

Based on all the analyses conducted, further investigations
are carried out to evaluate the impact of the lockdown measures in NYC, i.e., the most affected city during the analyzed
period. Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 show heatmaps comparing the
normalized load consumption of NYC during the March 1st
to June 30th time period. The vertical represent the different
days in the period and the horizontal represent the time of the
day. As seen, there is a clear difference between the same
periods during 2019 (pre COVID-19 pandemic) and 2020
(during the COVID-19 pandemic). It can also be observed
that the most significant variations in load demand reduction
are concentrated during the SAHO declared in NYC, that
began in March 22 and ended in May 15, as seen in the
presented timeline (Fig. 2). The variation observed during
this period can be characterized by a 20% to 30% reduction
in load demand during weekdays.
In order to avoid bias from load changes due to nonpandemic related events, we analyzed the weather conditions, and specifically temperature data for NYC during the
same period of time. Figs. 8 and 9 show the normalized
temperature values for NYC during the period of March 1st
to June 30th. The temperature data is normalized using 7.22 Celsius as the minimum value and 33.9 Celsius as the
maximum value. Based on this data, four days are selected as
VOLUME 4, 2020

candidates for investigating the feasibility of load-changing
attacks due to low net-load demand conditions, April 9,
April 10, April 11, and April 12. These days are selected
due to their similarity in temperature values between 2019
and 2020 and falling inside the SAHO time period declared
in New York. Choosing these days allowed us to discard
temperature as a driving factor of the significant variation
in electricity consumption, and helped us to focus on the
possible repercussions a pandemic-type event, as the one
being experienced, could cause in the cyberphysical security
of EPS.
To characterize the temperature similarities between the
days during the March 1st to June 30th period, average
percentage differences are calculated between the respective
days of 2019 and 2020. From the 122 days analyzed in the
aforementioned time period, April 11 is under 10% of the
days that had lower average temperature differences between
2019 and 2020. April 12 is under 20%, April 9 is under
35%, and April 10 lies under 50% of the days that had lower
average temperature differences between 2019 and 2020. In
addition, we also took into account that April 9 and 10 were
weekdays while April 11 and 12 from 2020 were weekend
days.
IV. MODELING LOAD-CHANGING ATTACKS: THREAT
MODEL & MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION

Modern EPS integrate different technologies, such as intelligent controls and real-time measurement devices, providing
system operators with real-time visibility and thus improving
system security, stability, and reliability. However, this integration can be a double-edged sword since the use of more
interconnected IoT devices exposes the power grid to new
cyberattack vectors altering completely the threat model. As
more high-wattage loads are equipped with IoT devices, the
feasibility of a load-changing attack significantly increases.
In this section, we focus on describing load-changing attacks
that can be performed by attackers with sufficient motivation,

capabilities, and resources to cause major disturbances in
transmission and distribution systems via the use of botnets
capable of simultaneously controlling large groups of highwattage loads and DERs.
A. THREAT MODEL: LOAD-CHANGING ATTACK

In this work, we consider an attacker capable of leveraging
vulnerabilities of IoT devices to compromise and control
high-wattage appliances, such as HVACs, water heaters, or
EV chargers. By simultaneously switching on and off or
granularly adjusting the power consumption of hundreds or
thousands of compromised devices, the attacker may be able
to cause severe adverse impacts, such as frequency instabilities and over/under voltage conditions, in the CPES.
Table 2 shows the threat model used for the load-changing
attack according to related work in the area [39]. As observed, for the load-changing attack, the attacker can be considered as an oblivious (i.e., no detailed knowledge of EPS
topology) or semi-oblivious (i.e., has limited information of
the EPS topology) adversary. In addition, since the attack can
10

be performed through IoT-connected devices, no possession
is required. This means that the attacker does not needs
to physically possess the attacked device(s) since they can
be compromised through the communication network. For
specificity, the attack is considered a targeted attack since
the adversary’s target are devices (e.g., IoT connected highwattage loads) capable of directly affecting the power grid
and possibly cause instabilities that could lead to blackouts
and frequency fluctuations in the system. In layman’s terms,
specificity relates to how specific the attack is, i.e., targeted
or non-targeted. As for adversary’s resources, in the investigated load-changing attack, we consider a Class II adversary
categorization, where Class I represents an adversary that
does not need and/or has sufficient resources to carry out very
complex attacks without being detected, and Class II represents an adversary that needs and/or disposes of sufficient
motivation and resources to materialize the coordinated loadchanging attack without being easily detected. This Class II
categorization is assumed due to the complexity related to
performing a coordinated load-changing attack capable of
simultaneously affecting multiple load zones in the power
grid that could cause significant damage in the system. This
type of attack differs from the dilettante attack mechanism in
[22] and requires significant resources and knowledge, such
as the appropriate instruments and training for being able to
infect and/or compromise multiple high-impact load zones,
to be effectively carried out.
In addition, the load-changing attack is considered to have
an iterative attack frequency and a multiple-times reproducibility in terms of the attack model formulation of the
threat modeling approach. This means that the attack needs to
be performed in an iterative manner, i.e., the adversary must
attack multiple loads and iteratively change their set-points
in order to accomplish the desired effect of destabilizing the
system (iterative attack). Also, the attack is considered a
multiple-times attack since it can be performed or reproduced
multiple times before being detected and mitigated by operators. Furthermore, the attack level in the attack model formulation is considered as a Level 1 (L1) or Level 2 (L2) attack
according to the level at which the vulnerable assets (e.g.,
smart HVACs, IoT-connected motors, PLCs, HMIs, breakers,
controllers, etc.) are compromised. These levels can be at the
industrial network layer or the local network layer. The attack
technique describes the attack method used by the adversary.
In the case of the load-changing attack considered, the attack
technique is assumed to be a modification of control logic or
a wired/wireless compromise of the controllable loads that
affects the integrity of the data in the system. The loadchanging attack is considered as a subset of data integrity
attacks (DIA) due to the fact that the attack is targeted at
affecting the integrity of either the system’s measurements
(e.g., current, voltage, power, or status measurements) or the
system’s controls (e.g., power set-points or status control
changes, etc.). Finally, the premise of the attack is related
to the integrity of the cyber-system, i.e., how the attack
affects primarily the integrity of the ICT devices that make

mathematical formulation of the load-changing attack as a
DIA is presented in the next subsection.
B. FORMULATION OF LOAD-CHANGING ATTACKS

The load-changing attack presented in this work can be
characterized as a DIA-type of attack. In order to present its
mathematical formulation, we first consider a cyberphysical
system (CPS) plant described by:
x(k + 1) = Gx(k) + Bu(k)

(9)

y(k) = Cx(k) + e(k)

(10)

where x(k) ∈ Rn represents the physical system’s states,
u(k) ∈ Rl represents the control variables, and y(k) ∈ Rm
represents the system’s measurements. The matrices G ∈
Rn×n , B ∈ Rn×l , and C ∈ Rm×n represent the system,
input, and output matrices, respectively. The system input
measurement noise is represented by the term e ∈ Rm . The
cyber-system of the CPS can be generally expressed as:
u(k + 1) = Hy(k)
l×m

(11)

H∈R
represents the control matrix [40]. Fig. 10 shows
a diagram that depicts the variables affected by the DIA loadchanging attack in the CPS structure.
As observed in Fig. 10, in a DIA, either the measurements
(y) or the controls (u) could be compromised by the adversary via fabrication or modification. More specifically for a
load-changing attack, the controls (u) of the IoT-controllable
loads are ‘altered/attacked’ as:
VOLUME 4, 2020

(12)

(15)

where p represents the controllable load demand in the system, pi is the initial ‘un-altered’ load demand, ∆p represents
the portion of the total load demand affected by the loadchanging attack, and pa represents the total load demand ‘altered’ by the load-changing attack at one bus. If the attackers
simultaneously compromise more than one load/bus in the
system, Eq. (15) can be extended as:
PT (k) =

m

pa,n (k) + Ploss

(16)

j=0

where PT represents the total demand in the system, m is
the number of total ‘unaltered’ loads in the system, n is the
total number of loads compromised by adversaries, and Ploss
represents the total losses.
Due to the network power balance, to maintain frequency
stability, the sum of all the generation needs to be approximately equal to the total demand and losses in the system:
PT (k) ≈

Ng
X

Pg (k)

(17)

g=0

where Ng represents the number of g generators in the
system. Hence, in order to understand the effect of load
changes in the frequency stability at each generator bus,
we can investigate the swing equation which describes the
behavior of rotor dynamics in transient stability studies.
The swing equations shown in Eq. (18) - Eq. (20) describe
the relationship between the input mechanical power (Pm ),
output electrical power (Pe ), and the rotational speed of the
generator (ω) [41]. The term Pe is directly related to Pg
as seen in Eq. (21), since it represents the generator power
output plus electrical losses of the generating unit.

receiving bus, and X is the reactance based on the classical
model of a generator. The relationship between the electrical
frequency ω(t) with the power angle δ is shown in Eq. (19).
Therefore, it is evident based on these relationships that any
sudden change in load demand caused by high-wattage loads
turning on/off in the CPES will affect Pe , and thus cause
frequency fluctuations as seen in Eq. (20).

C. OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES & STANDARDS:
FREQUENCY THRESHOLDS FOR NERC, ERCOT, AND
NYISO

Before analyzing the feasibility of load-changing attacks
in a system experiencing low net-load demand conditions
such as the ones observed in our investigations, we first
explore what are the operational challenges that exist in
EPS and are related to load demand changes. According to
the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) [42], there are
different types of challenging operational conditions, related
to net-load demand changes, that could cause steady-state or
dynamic threats to the contingency security of EPS. These
challenging operational conditions are:
1) Peak-demand conditions: Congested networks or
limited generation capacity.
2) Rapid change in demand or supply conditions: A
rapid change in demand or supply. For example: morning demand ramps, PV-related net demand ramps, or
sudden failure of EPS elements.
3) Low net-demand conditions: Periods when the system load demand is significantly reduced. During these
periods, system voltages may rise and system inertia
may be affected. Excess generation may be forced to
remain online to meet the demand at a later time.
In addition to handling these operational challenges, system operators must provide protective mechanisms to resolve
system instabilities, protect system assets, and maintain normal operations. Some of these mechanisms are, for example,
underfrequency relays designed to trip when the system’s
frequency is lower than some predefined values. These predefined values are generally given as frequency bounds programmed into protection mechanisms, and thus are essential
to determine the types of remedial actions needed to maintain
system stability. The North American Electric Reliability
Corporation (NERC) is a nonprofit corporation that provides comprehensive standards for EPS operation in North
12

America. More specifically, NERC requires power systems to
operate within a frequency range of 59.5 Hz to 62.2 Hz. If the
frequency is out of these bounding ranges, underfrequency
or overfrequency protection relays trip parts of the system
with the objective of protecting the respective system assets
and the overall grid infrastructure [43]. Similarly, the Electric
Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) sets its own frequency
thresholds to be 59.3 Hz for underfrequency and 61.8 Hz
for overfrequency, respectively. In addition, some system
operators may have more complex protection mechanisms
that provide rules to shed a certain percentage of the load
in the system in case of frequency stability issues [44].
Since our load data and load-changing attack scenarios
are based on NYISO and NYC, we utilize the operational
standard (frequency thresholds) provided by NYISO. In comparison with NERC and ERCOT, NYISO has more strict
criteria to mitigate underfrequency and overfrequency scenarios. NYISO defines a major system disturbance as any
event that causes the frequency to drop below 59.9 Hz or
increase over 60.1 Hz [45]. The specific thresholds given by
NERC, ERCOT, and NYISO are provided in Table 3.
More specifically, for underfrequency scenarios, NYISO
requires fast UFLS to be performed at different percentages
when the frequency is rapidly declining. Consecutive 7%
load shedding is performed when the frequency drops below
59.5 Hz, 59.3 Hz, 59.1 Hz, and 58.9 Hz. At this point, if the
frequency is still declining, transmission operators must take
the necessary steps to minimize damage and service interruption. However, the UFLS required in ERCOT differs from
the one applied in NYISO due to its different operational
thresholds. In ERCOT, the UFLS starts at 59.3 Hz, where 5%
of the system load is tripped. Then, an additional 10% of the
load is tripped at 58.9 Hz and an additional 10% at 58.5 Hz.
It is important to remember that the intent of UFLS is not to
recover the frequency but to stop the frequency decline [46].
On the other hand, for overfrequency scenarios, both ERCOT and NYISO have similar procedures to follow in order
to maintain compliance with the NERC Balancing Authority
ACE Limit (BAAL) standard. Specifically for the NYISO
case, a sustained high frequency of 60.10 Hz is considered
an indication of a major load-generation imbalance, and
if it continues to decline it can be declared as a ‘major
emergency’ [45]. In order to address this emergency NYISO
takes the following actions [45]:
1) Request all over generating suppliers to adjust their
generation and match schedules.
2) Reduce the applicable dispatchable generation to minimum operating limits.
3) Request internal generators to voluntarily operate in
‘manual’ mode and below minimum dispatchable levels.
4) Attempt to schedule variable load or storage to alleviate the problem.
5) Request reduction or cancellation of all transactions
that are contributing to the imbalance event.

V. ANALYZING THE FEASIBILITY OF LOAD-CHANGING
ATTACKS: EXPERIMENTAL SETUP & RESULTS

In this section, we present the experimental setup used for
evaluating the feasibility of a load-changing attack in a
system such as NYISO during low load demand periods such
as the ones encountered during the COVID-19 pandemic. As
presented in Section III, four days are selected as candidates
for investigating the feasibility of load-changing attacks during low net-load demand periods. These days are April 9, 10,
11, and 12 of 2019 and 2020.
A. TEST SYSTEM: IEEE-14 BUS SYSTEM

For our experimental analysis, 5-minute resolution load data
are obtained from the 11 load zones that exist in NYISO.
Due to the lack of NYISO topological information, we utilize
NYISO load data and the respective NYISO load zones are
mapped to every load bus in the IEEE-14 bus test system
[47], [48]. Below, we describe how to prepare the data in
order to examine our load-changing attack case studies. First,
the mapping of the NYISO regions to IEEE-14 bus system is
performed as follows:
1) A - WEST → Bus #2
2) B - GENESE → Bus #3
3) C - CENTRL → Bus #4
4) D - NORTH → Bus #5
5) E - MHK VL → Bus #6
6) F - CAPITL → Bus #9
7) G - HUD VL → Bus #10
8) H - MILLWD → Bus #11
9) I - DUNWOD → Bus #12
10) J - N.Y.C. → Bus #13
11) K - LONGIL → Bus #14
Fig. 11 shows the NYISO map with the corresponding
mappings. In order to adapt the NYISO load values to the
IEEE-14 test system, we performed a normalization process
that consists of obtaining the average load consumption of
each zone (based on historical data), calculating a ratio of
load demand, and finally computing the corresponding load

load-changing attacks due to low net-load demand conditions
caused by action events of the COVID-19 pandemic.
For each case study, or day analyzed, a preliminary analysis is conducted to determine the time of day when the 2020
system is more vulnerable (i.e., has lower demand) than the
2019 system, and also to determine the loads (or buses) that
have the highest impact in frequency stability of the system.
In other words, this analysis indicates the period where the
biggest difference in the total load demand of the system
exists, when comparing 2019 and 2020 load profiles, and then
clearly shows which buses, if compromised, would have the
highest impact in the 2020 system. The total load demand
difference is calculated by subtracting the total load demand
of 2019 minus the total load demand of 2020:
LD = T L2019 − T L2020

(22)

where LD is the total load demand difference between 2019
and 2020, and T L is the total load demand of the respective
years.
Additionally, in order to determine the buses (or loads)
that, if compromised, would have the highest impact on the
14

2020 system when compared to the 2019 system, a ratio
of the load at each bus and the total load for the specific
year (i.e., 2019 or 2020) is calculated. Then, these ratios
are subtracted to compute the load impact index difference
(LIID) for each individual bus in the system as seen in Eq.
(23).
LIIDi =

Li
Li2019
− 2020
T L2019
T L2020

(23)

where L is the load at the respective load i for the respective
year, 2019 or 2020. It should be noted that all the values used
in this analysis are in per unit (p.u.).
After the preliminary analysis is conducted and the ‘ideal’
period of time to attack the system is identified, a loadchanging attack is conducted in each selected day and period,
while the frequency of the system is monitored. The selection
of the compromised bus(es) for each case study depends on
the results obtained in the preliminary analysis. More details
regarding the specific case studies are presented below.

C. CASE STUDY 1: APRIL 9
1) Preliminary Analysis

A preliminary analysis is performed in order to identify the
‘ideal’ time period and bus(es) that would need the minimum
effort to cause a high impact in the system when a loadchanging attack is performed; or simply the period when a
peak of LD matches with a negative peak in LIID. Figs. 13(a)
and 14(a) show the LD and the LIID for April 9. Based on
the results from the analysis, the period when the highest
difference in load demand between 2019 and 2020 arises is
in the hours between 6:30 am to 7:30 am and 4:30 pm to
6:00 pm. The highest LD value during the morning period
is 0.309. However, in order to find the discussed ‘ideal’
period for the load-changing attack, we also need to find out
the most negative LIID value observed during the examined
periods and then correlate it to the high LD value period
observed in the LD graph. As seen in Fig. 14(a), the ‘lowest’
negative LIID values occur during the 11:30 am to 1:30 pm
period, with a peak of -0.0248. Nonetheless, when correlating
these two values, we can clearly see that our LIID peak period
VOLUME 4, 2020

does not match with any of the two LD identified periods,
so no bus(es) in the system can be identified as the one(s)
that could cause a high impact in the 2020 system when
compared to the 2019 system scenario. Any load-changing
attack implemented in 2020 system will have a similar effect
on 2019 system, making April 9 a difficult day to analyze in
terms of how more vulnerable the system is when low netload demand conditions exist.
2) Load-changing attack Impact

According to the analysis obtained from the preliminary
analysis step, we recognized that for this particular day
there are no time periods where an attacker could effectively
compromise the frequency of the system when compared to
2019 with minimum effort. Both systems (2019 and 2020
scenarios) would have a fairly similar response, thus making
it very hard to evaluate the feasibility of a load-changing attack when low net-loading conditions exist. This is indicated
by the fact that the lowest (most negative) value of LIID
does not align with the highest value of LD in the analyzed
15

Ospina et al.: On the Feasibility of Load-Changing Attacks in Power Systems during the COVID-19 Pandemic

scenario. In a nutshell, April 9 is a day when an attacker
would no see any significant differences between attacking
a system with lower loading conditions, based on how the
2020 system scenario compares to the 2019 system scenario.

1) Preliminary Analysis

Figs. 13(b) and 14(b) show the LD and the LIID for April
10. Based on these results, we identify that the period when
the highest difference in load demand between 2019 and
2020 occurs is in the hours between 5:00 am and 10:00 am,
more specifically, at 7:30 am when the LD value is 0.356.
Following a similar approach as the one presented in the
previous case study, we correlate the most negative LIID
value of the analyzed day, which occurs between 8:30 am
and 9:00 am (i.e., the negative peak of the purple line), with
the period of maximum LD. It is worthwhile to remember
that the negative LIID value tells us which bus(es) in the
system will have the greatest impact in the 2020 system
while requiring the minimum effort (minimum load change
required) when compared to the 2019 system. Based on
the observed correlation, we conclude that attacking bus #5
(purple line) between 8:30 am and 9:00 am (i.e., the negative
peak of the purple line), together with bus #9 (light blue line),
would cause the greatest impact on the frequency stability of
the 2020 system scenario.
2) Load-changing attack Impact

Based on the preliminary analysis, we simulate a loadchanging attack on the loads connected to bus #5 and bus #9
for both the 2019 and 2020 system scenarios. Fig. 15 shows
the impact of the 5-second load changing attack during 300
seconds (i.e., 5 minutes from 8:40 am to 8:45 am), where
the load-changing attack is executed at 200 seconds. As seen
in the graph, the frequency of the 2020 system scenario
crosses the overfrequency NYISO limit of 60.1 Hz when
the load-changing attack disconnects the compromised loads
(i.e., loads at bus #5 and bus #9). On the other hand, the
2019 system scenario presents no overfrequency problems
and thus we can see that the low net-load demand of the
2020 system makes more feasible the implementation of a
high-impact load-changing attack that could compromise the
stability of the system. It should also be noted that a more
sustained attack (e.g., a 1 or 5-minute attack) has the potential
of causing more severe problems.

load demand between 2019 and 2020 exists is in the hours
between 7:30 am and 3:00 pm. Similarly to the previous
case study, in order to find the ‘ideal’ period for the loadchanging attack, we need to find out the most negative LIID
value observed during the examined period and then correlate
it to the high LD value period observed in the LD graph.
Correlating these two graphs, we observe that attacking bus
#9 (light blue line) between 1:00 pm and 2:00 pm (i.e.,
the negative peak of the light blue line) would cause the
greatest impact on the frequency stability of the 2020 system
scenario.
2) Load-changing attack Impact

A load-changing attack on the load connected to bus #9 is
implemented for both the 2019 and 2020 system scenarios,
according to the results obtained in the preliminary analysis.
Fig. 16 shows the impact of the 5-second load changing
attack during 300 seconds (i.e., 5 minutes from 1:40 pm to
1:45 pm), where the load-changing attack is executed at 200
seconds. This graph shows how the frequency of the 2020
system scenario crosses the overfrequency limit of 60.1 Hz
and goes up to 60.5 Hz when the load-changing attack compromises the load connected at bus #9. Differently, the 2019
system scenario presents no major overfrequency problems,
so we can conclude again that the low net-load demand of
the 2020 system makes more feasible the implementation
of a high-impact load-changing attack that could negatively
impact the stability of the system.

E. CASE STUDY 3: APRIL 11
1) Preliminary Analysis

F. CASE STUDY 4: APRIL 12

Similar to April 10, April 11 seems to be a day where a loadchanging attack could be feasible if mitigation measures are
not taken. But, to confirm this, we perform the preliminary
analysis and identify the highest LD values and the most
negative LIID values based on Figs. 13(c) and 14(c). These
figures show the LD and the LIID for April 11. Based
on these results, the period when the highest difference in

Using a similar approach as the ones implemented in the

corresponding LIID values for April 12. As seen in these
graphs, the period when the highest difference in load deVOLUME 4, 2020

mand between 2019 and 2020 appears is in the hours between
6:30 am to 12:30 pm, with a peak value of 0.628 at 8:10
am. This period can be correlated to the period when the
most negative LIID values are observed, which in turn, is the
period between 10:00 am and 11:30 am (i.e., the negative
peak of the orange line with a peak negative value of -0.0257
at 10:35 am). Using this information, we conclude that attacking bus #3 (orange line) between 10:00 am and 11:30 am
would produce the greatest impact in the frequency stability
of the 2020 system scenario, while requiring the minimum
attacker’s effort, when compared to the 2019 system.

G. DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDIES

2) Load-changing attack Impact

Following the same approach described in previous case
studies and based on the preliminary analysis results, we
perform a load-changing attack on the load connected to bus
#3 for both the 2019 and 2020 system scenarios. Fig. 17
shows the impact of the 5-second load changing attack during
300 seconds (i.e., 5 minutes from 10:33 am to 10:38 am),
where the load-changing attack is executed at 200 seconds.
Different from previous results, both the 2019 and 2020
systems have severe frequency stability problems since the
frequency peaks at around 64.02 Hz and 63.46 Hz for the
2019 and the 2020 system scenarios, respectively. Diving
deeper into these results, we discovered that bus # 3 is one
of the most critical buses in the system due to the fact that it
represents an average of around 37% of the total load of the
2019 system scenario and 36% of the total load of the 2020
system scenario. This makes bus #3 one of the most critical
buses in the system, and the results that are shown in Fig.
17 clearly demonstrate that no matter if the system is experiencing low loading conditions (2020 system) or not (2019
system), a load-changing attack that disconnects this highimpact load zone would cause severe frequency fluctuations.
In a nutshell, an attacker with enough capabilities to perform
an attack targeted at bus #3 of the analyzed system will cause
severe problems in the frequency stability of the system.
VOLUME 4, 2020

Based on the results of the four case studies investigated,
it can be observed that each one of them enables different
insights regarding the feasibility of load-changing attacks
in a CPES experiencing low loading conditions. Evaluating
all these four cases provides a good perspective on some
probable scenarios of the load-changing attack spectrum.
For instance, case study 1 (April 9) demonstrates a scenario
where an attacker, implementing a load-changing attack,
would not perceive any difference between compromising a
system experiencing low loading conditions, such as the 2020
scenario, and a nominal system, such as the 2019 scenario.
On the other hand, both case study 2 and case study 3 (April
10 and April 11) clearly show how the low net-load demand conditions, that exist during the COVID-19 pandemic
lockdowns, make the 2020 system scenario more vulnerable
to low probability, high-impact load changing attacks when
compared to the 2019 scenario. In both case studies, it can be
observed how the same load-changing scenario has minor impacts on the 2019 system’s frequency while producing major
problems on the 2020 system’s frequency. Finally, case study
4 (April 12) is an example of how compromising a critical
bus in a CPES will cause severe frequency stability problems
no matter if low loading conditions are being experienced.
From a planning, operation, and cybersecurity perspective,
system operators need to ensure these nodes are identified,
and they must take appropriate mitigation strategies to handle
any possible attacks to these critical buses.
VI. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK

This paper explores the feasibility of load-changing attacks
in CPES that experience abnormal low loading conditions
caused by events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and its
corresponding lockdown measures. We explore the differences in loading conditions of the main affected regions in
the U.S. and analyze the abnormal load patterns caused by
lockdown measures in these regions, with a primary focus on
17

Ospina et al.: On the Feasibility of Load-Changing Attacks in Power Systems during the COVID-19 Pandemic

the NYSIO region, by applying DMD to load consumption
data from the years 2019 and 2020. Based on these analyses,
we formulate a load-changing attack and further explore the
feasibility of such attack in a system experiencing the low
loading patterns identified by the DMD process. Finally, we
simulate and evaluate the impacts of load-changing attacks
in a test grid system experiencing low loading conditions
(2020), when compared to the 2019 historical loading conditions, using NYISO data. Our results demonstrate that low
loading conditions can be leveraged by attackers with the
objective of compromising the frequency stability of power
systems. Specifically, the presented case studies show that
an attacker with sufficient resources and capabilities would
require less effort to compromise a system experiencing low
loading conditions such as the ones experienced during the
COVID-19 pandemic of 2020.
Future work will focus on considering distribution systems
with high penetration of renewable energy resources while
evaluating both frequency and voltage stability problems
caused by load-changing attacks. Systems with high penetration of intermittent renewable energy resources (such
as PV and wind energy) are expected, due to the nonexistent coordination of voltage regulation devices and the
impacted system inertia (e.g, the removal of synchronous
generators results in less system inertia with impacts on
transient and small-signal stability), to be more vulnerable to
load-changing attacks when considering their effects in other
system areas and control routines such as voltage regulation.
Another area of research will be the impact evaluation of
other types of cyberattacks, such as false data injection
attacks and time-delay attacks, in systems experiencing low
loading conditions, such as the one investigated throughout
this research.
