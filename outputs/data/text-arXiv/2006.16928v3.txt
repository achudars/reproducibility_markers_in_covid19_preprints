Abstract. The outbreak of COVID-19 disrupts the life of many people in the world.
The state of Arizona in the U.S. emerges as one of the country’s newest COVID-19 hot
spots. Accurate forecasting for COVID-19 cases will help governments to implement
necessary measures and convince more people to take personal precautions to combat
the virus. It is difficult to accurately predict the COVID-19 cases due to many human
factors involved. This paper aims to provide a forecasting model for COVID-19 cases
with the help of human activity data from the Google Community Mobility Reports.
To achieve this goal, a specific partial differential equation (PDE) is developed and
validated with the COVID-19 data from the New York Times at the county level in
the state of Arizona in the U.S. The proposed model describes the combined effects
of transboundary spread among county clusters in Arizona and human actives on the
transmission of COVID-19. The results show that the prediction accuracy of this model
is well acceptable (above 94%). Furthermore, we study the effectiveness of personal
precautions such as wearing face masks and practicing social distancing on COVID-19
cases at the local level. The localized analytical results can be used to help to slow the
spread of COVID-19 in Arizona. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first
attempt to apply PDE models on COVID-19 prediction with the Google Community
Mobility Reports.

Introduction

The outbreak of COVID-19 is disrupting the personal lives of people around the world
in a variety of ways and has made profound impacts on the world socially and economically.
As the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the U.S. continues to rise in early 2020,
many states declared states of emergency and shutdown orders or stay-at-home orders were
issued to slow the spread of COVID-19. Many schools, workplaces, and public gathering
spaces across the U.S. were closed for an extended time. In June 2020, as states gradually
reopen the economy, the number of COVID-19 cases starts to increase again in many states.
In June 2020, Arizona emerged as one of the country’s newest COVID-19 hot spots with
an alarming resurgence of COVID-19 after the stay-at-home order was lifted in the middle
of May. The number of people hospitalized is also climbing. On June 15, Arizona reported
2,497 new COVID-19 cases, a new all-time high record, up from the previous highest number
of cases of 2,140 cases in a single day on June 12. Previously, Arizona experienced the first
rapid rise in the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection on March 16 with a
total of 1,157 confirmed cases including 20 deaths, according to the Arizona Department
of Health Services (Arizona Department of Health Services (2020)). The spike of the new
COVID-19 case is believed to result from the fact that Arizona took a more aggressive
approach to reopen the state in the middle of May. In addition, there is also no statelevel requirement for everyone to wear face masks. Many Arizonans have different views
on practice social distancing which is the only way to prevent infections in the absence of
a vaccine. Although under Arizona’s reopening plan, businesses are only advised to follow
federal guidance on social distancing, the trade-offs between health and the economy have
forced many businesses to choose not fully implementing the social distancing requirements
during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, quantifying the impact of social distancing on
minimizing the epidemic impact can make governments and convince more people to better
understand the significance of social distancing and personal precautions. In the present
paper, we examine the COVID-19 situation in the state of Arizona in the United States and
predict the number of cases in Arizona after the reopening of the economy.
There have been plenty of mathematical models to describe the spread of infectious
diseases. To reply to the current COVID-19 pandemic, many modeling studies using ordinary
differential equations (ODE) have proposed for predicting the COVID-19 cases (e. g. He
et al. (2020); Li et al. (2020); Wang et al. (2019)). The classical susceptible infectious
recovered model (SIR) (Huang et al. (2020)) and susceptible exposed infectious recovered
model (SEIR) (Lai et al. (2020); Omori et al. (2020); Yang et al. (2020)) are the most
widely adopted ones for characterizing the outbreak of COVID-19. The extension of the
classical SEIR model with age-stratified model (Prem et al. (2020)) and meta-population
model (Pujari and Shekatkar (2020)) were also introduced.
In this paper, we present a spatio-temporal model, specifically, a partial differential
equation (PDE) model, of COVID-19 based on county-level clusters. The proposed model
describes the combined effects of transboundary spread among county clusters in Arizona
and human activities on the transmission of COVID-19. This is, in particular, important
for Arizona as well as the other states in the U.S. because new COVID-19 cases in the

2

U.S. are still continuing to head upward after the lockdown ended while most countries had
peaked their new cases after lockdowns. One of the factors contributing to the continued
spike of the U.S. cases is that personal precautions are not consistent across the U.S. once
the lockdown ends. In Arizona, the face mask requirement is implemented at the local
government level. A number of counties in Arizona do not require face masks. We divided the
counties in Arizona into three regions. The three regions represent different geographical and
social characteristics in terms of the spread of COVID-19. These disparities, which reflect
differing regional levels of risk, can be better modeled by a spatio-temporal model. As a
result, the characteristics of the PDE model make it suitable for COVID-19 prediction. The
localized results of the spatio-temporal model provide more useful information for the local
governments to closely monitor new COVID-19 clusters and quickly reinstating lockdowns
at the local level when epidemic spikes.
Many spatio-temporal models characterize infectious diseases by PDEs, describing the
dynamics of susceptible, infected, and recovered populations (e.g. Brauer et al. (2019);
Holmes et al. (1994); Wang et al. (2020); Zhu et al. (2017)). Our previous work (Wang et al.
(2020, 2016), Wang et al. (2020)) applies PDE models to make a regional level of influenza
with geo-tagged data. The PDE model we develop in the present work focuses on the spread
of COVID-19 and incorporating social distancing factors. While there is a rich literature on
the application of PDE to modeling the spatial spread of infectious diseases, to the best of
our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to apply PDE models on COVID-19 prediction
with real-data validation.
In addition, our model is different from the existing models in that we include the data
from the Google Community Mobility Report (Google. (2020)) which reflects the effects of
human activities. To help to combat the spread of COVID-19, Google releases the COVID19 Community Mobility Reports which provide daily, county-level aggregated data on time
spent at different categories of activities, compared with a baseline period before the epidemic. These activities include retail and recreation, groceries and pharmacies, parks, transit
stations, workplaces, and residential areas. Mobility trends obtained from location history
are dynamic in time and reflect real-time changes in social behavior, making them a crucial
factor in analyzing COVID-19 spread and its countermeasure. There are several ODE and
statistical models which utilize the COVID-19 Community Mobility data (Picchiotti et al.
(2020); Abouk and Heydari (2020); Vokó and Pitter (2020)). To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first PDE model incorporating COVID-19 Community Mobility data to predict
the number of COVID-19 cases.

Data Description

There are 15 counties in the U.S. state of Arizona. In general, Arizona is divided into
Northern, Central, and Southern Arizona. Although the boundaries of the regions are not
well-defined, as we aim to predict COVID-19 cases in Arizona, we group the counties of
Arizona into the three regions in Fig. 1. The three regions have better balanced COVID-19
cases because Maricopa County, where the city of Phoenix is located, has about 60% of the
population in Arizona. More importantly, they represent different geographical and social
3

Figure 1: Three regions in Arizona
characteristics in terms of the spread of COVID-19. Much of the Northern region is National
Forest Service land, parkland, and includes part of Navajo reservations. For the per-capita
COVID-19 infection rate in the US, the Navajo Nation, which spans parts of Arizona, New
Mexico, and Utah, is greater than that of New York City in May 2020. The Southern Arizona
includes the city of Tucson and several other small cities close to the border of the U.S. and
Mexico. In the following, we will use NAZ (Region 1), CAZ (Region 2), and SAZ (Region
3) to denote the clusters of the Arizona counties.
• NAZ (Region 1)=[Mohave County, Coconino County, Yavapai County, La Paz County,
Gila County, Navajo County, Apache County].
• CAZ (Region 2)=[Maricopa County].
• SAZ (Region 3)=[Yuma County, Pima County, Pinal County, Graham County, Santa
Cruz County, Greenlee County, Cochise County].
We compute the daily new cases of each region by adding the new COVID-19 cases
of all counties belonging to a region. We use the COVID-19 data from the New York
Times at the state and the county level over time. The New York Times is compiling the
time series data from state and local governments and health departments in an attempt
to provide a complete record of the ongoing outbreak. The data can be downloaded from
https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data and https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronaviruscounty-data-us.html.
4

In addition, we incorporate the Google Community Mobility Report into our model.
These Community Mobility Reports provide insights into how people’s social behaviors have
been changing in response to policies aimed at combating COVID-19. The reports provide
the changes in movement trends compared to baselines overtime at the U.S. county level,
across different categories of activities. These activities include retail and recreation, groceries and pharmacies, parks, transit stations, workplaces, and residential. The relevant data
can be downloaded from https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/. Then we compute the
daily changes of each region by adding the changes of all counties belonging to a region.
We create two time series from the Google Community Mobility Report. We accumulate
the data for retail & recreation, groceries & pharmacies, parks, transit stations, workplaces,
which are believed to increase the number of COVID-19 cases. On the other hand, the
data from Google mobility for residential activities describes stay-at-home activities that are
believed to prevent COVID-19 epidemics. In some cases, the increase of residential activities
may result from events (such as parties) that could promote COVID-19 cases. However, the
Google data only indicates residential activities compared to baselines. In our model, we use
a MichaelisMenten function to limit the effect of residential activities. Because it may take
about two weeks for the effect of the activities to take place, we subtract the time t in our
PDE model by 14 to reflect the incubation period of COVID-19 in most cases.

PDE Model

In this section, we introduce a specific PDE model to characterize the spatio-temporal
dynamics of COVID-19 cases. To apply a PDE model to the interaction of the dynamics of
COVID-19 cases, one must embed the three regions NAZ, CAZ, SAZ into Euclidean space
and arrange them in a meaningful order. In this paper, the three regions are mapped onto
a line where the locations of NAZ, CAZ, SAZ are 1, 2, 3 respectively. The arrangement
will make the three regions stay as close as possible for ensuring that the continuous model
can capture the spread of COVID-19 cases between the three regions. Projecting the three
regions, geographically located in the north-south direction of Arizona, onto the x-axis of
the Cartesian coordinates, as shown in Fig. 2. We project the three regions as the order of
geographical north-south direction instead of other orders mainly due to the following fact:
Maricopa county has much more population than any other county in Arizona. It is more
likely that COVID-19 spreads from the metro Phoenix area to both northern and southern
counties, at least at the beginning of 2020.
Having embedded the three regions to the Euclidean space, we will develop the spatiotemporal model for the spread of COVID-19 cases according to the balance law: the rate
at which a given quantity changes in a given domain must equal the rate at which it flows
across its boundary plus the rate at which it is created, or destroyed, within the domain.
The PDE model can be conceptually divided into two processes: an internal process within
each region and an external process among regions. Similar derivation for the PDE model
has been used in our previous work for PDE models for information diffusion in online social
networks in Wang et al. (2020).

Let C(x, t) represent the COVID-19 cases in Arizona region x at a given time t. The
changing rate of C(x, t) depends on two processes as in Fig. 2:
• Global process: the social interactions of people between regions, such as traveling and
commuting between regions, that contribute to the spread of COVID-19;
• Local process: in each Arizona region, people become newly infected through social
interactions with infected people within a region; and people may take personal precautions to reduce and mitigate COVID-19 spread.
Combining the two processes, the dynamics of COVID-19 cases can be captured by

The basic mathematical properties of the proposed PDE model in Eq. (1) such as
existence and uniqueness can be established from the standard theorems for parabolic PDEs
in Friedman (2008). Below, we evaluate the robustness of our PDE-based predictive model
and validate if the model has acceptable prediction performance with the COVID-19 case
report in Arizona. The procedure of predictive modeling for the COVID-19 case in Arizona
is summarized as follows:
• Prediction Procedure: In the prediction process of the research time period, the
model parameters are to be determined by the historical aggregated data of COVID-19
cases in the three regions under the same structured PDE. In the current experiment,
we predict the COVID-19 cases three days ahead. In order to forecast the COVID-19
of a given day, we first train the parameters of the PDE model and then solve the
PDE model for prediction. For example, days 1–7, 2–8, . . . , are used as the training
9

data, and we predict the number of COVID-19 cases for the following days 10, 11, . . . ,
respectively.
The process of performing the prediction can be divided into two major processes. We
first use an optimization method to fit parameters in the PDE model with historical
data of COVID-19 cases. In essence, this is a multi-parameter inverse problem of
parabolic equations. We integrate the local and global methods to search for the best
fitting parameters. In the present work for COVID-19 modeling problems, we take a
hybrid approach: first, a tensor train global optimization (Oseledets (2011)) is used
to explore the parameter space thus to locate the starting points and then NelderMead simplex local optimization method (Lagarias et al. (1998)) is used to search the
local optimization of COVID-19 modeling problem. The Nelder-Mead simplex method
is implemented in the fminsearch function in Matlab. Once the model parameters
are determined, we use the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method to solve the PDE for
one-step forward prediction numerically.
• Accuracy Measurement: We need to quantify the accuracy of model prediction of
the COVID-19 cases by comparing the predicted COVID-19 cases with the observed
aggregated COVID-19 cases for three regions, which are the ground truth. The mean
absolute percentage error
xreal − xpredict
1−
xreal
is applied to measure the prediction accuracy, xreal is the observed COVID-19 cases at
every data collection time point and xpredict is the predicted cases.
Fig. 3 illustrates predictions of COVID-19 cases in Arizona from April 24, 2020, to June
19, 2020, for three regions. The period covers the period of the end of stay-home order
when the COVID-19 case started to increase quickly. The blue lines represent the predicted
COVID-19 cases and red lines represent the actual COVID-19 cases. Note that we normalize the data to be between [0, 1]. Parameters in each prediction step are different, here we
just provide the parameters in the last prediction for June 19. The parameters for prediction on June 19 are: d = 0.013556543719, k = 4.655312010389, b1 = 0.503402937243188,
b2 = 0.236417906835504, c = 0.821575737918722 and l1 = 0.0826411111659247, l2 =
0.347970638795282 and l3 = 0.28107732159028. Fig. 4 illustrates the prediction accuracy
in NAZ, CAZ, and SAZ every day from April 24, 2020, to June 19, 2020. The Arizona stayhome order started on March 31, 2020, and ended on May 15, 2020. The average relative
accuracy of three regions with three days prediction are 94%, 97%, and 95% respectively.
Clearly, the PDE-based prediction model has a good short-term prediction ability during
active COVID-19 epidemics.

Effects of Social Distancing and Face Covering

value of c which measures the effect of the stay-at-home-order and social distancing. We do
not have specific data from Google Community Mobility to incorporate our model for the
effectiveness of social distancing and face mask. In general, it is believed that face masks
and proper social distancing could significantly reduce COVID-19 cases. Specifically, based
on each group of model parameters obtained in the above prediction process, we retain
them unchanged in Eq. (1) except doubling the value of c (the rate of effectiveness of social
distancing). The doubled value of c suggests that, to reduce COVID-19 cases, people in
Arizona take the extra effort of practicing social distancing and wearing face covering even
after the lift of the stay-at-home-order.

(b), (c) captures the predicted COVID-19 cases (blue lines) under double measurements to
reduce COVID-19 for Region 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Fig. 5 shows that if stricter precaution
measures are taken, the COVID-19 cases will be controlled to some extent. As a result,
our analysis confirms the positive short-term effects of precaution measures on the spread of
COVID-19.
Unfortunately, there is no mandatory requirement of face-covering at the state level.
About one month after the stay-at-home-order expired on May 15, local governments established their own health and safety measures such as face mask mandates in an effort to slow
the spread of COVID-19. As a result, the state keeps breaking a record of daily cases and
hospitalizations suspected to be related to COVID-19. CAZ (Maricopa county) continues to
have the highest number of cases in Arizona. On June 22, multiple officials from cities across
the state began implementing requirements for face coverings in public. There have been
five counties including Maricopa County that have a mask requirement in place as shown in
Fig. 6 as of June 29, 2020. Many cities and towns across metro Phoenix already had enacted
their own face-covering-mandates in public earlier but Maricopa County (CAZ) took the
lead in sending a clear message to every resident in the county to wear a mask. We hope the
COVID-19 cases will begin to go downward in the near future.

Discussion

In this paper, the proposed PDE model is built on three regions in Arizona for the
prediction of COVID-19 cases. The PDE model is capable of capturing the effects of various
geographical and social factors. To ensure high accuracy predictions of COVID-19 cases,
daily cases of COVID-19, and the effects of social distancing are included in the prediction
model. In addition, Google Community Mobility data is incorporated to reflect the effects
of human activities. As a result, the PDE model can be useful in making localized policies
for reducing the spread of COVID-19.
We regroup 15 counties in Arizona into three regions: Northern Arizona, Central Arizona, and Southern Arizona. One may be able to use ordinary differential equations on
multiple patches for the prediction of COVID-19 cases in Arizona. Here we choose partial
differential equations instead of ordinary differential equations mainly because of the geographical and social characteristics in Arizona in terms of the spread of COVID-19. The
three regions are geographically located in the north-south direction of Arizona and can be
naturally projected onto the x-axis of the Cartesian coordinates. In addition, Central Arizona, home to the metro Phoenix area, has about 60% of the population in Arizona. As a
result, the spread of COVID-19 between Central Arizona and other two regions are more
likely predominant in terms of transboundary spread. These geographical characteristics,
along with the disparities of social distancing and face mask requirements among the Arizona counties, fit squarely into the framework of reaction-diffusion equations for the spread
of COVID-19.
While capturing the trend of the spread of COVID-19, we were able to avoid large scale
computation by regrouping the counties, which allowed us to use a computational-heavy
PDE model. Thus, the diffusion process of COVID-19 between county-regions as well as
the increase of COVID-19 cases within a region are incorporated into the PDE model. The
present paper aims to develop, for the first time in the literature, a specific PDE model
between county-regions for forecasting daily COVID-19 cases and further quantifying the
influences of the mobility of the community on the changing the number of COVID-19 cases
in the state of Arizona. In addition, In the present study, we study the effectiveness of
human precautions such as face masks and social distancing on decreasing COVID-19 cases
and hope to provide analytical results to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in Arizona.
In this paper, we choose three regions of counties in Arizona for the spatial model
because of the availability of both COVID-19 data and Google Community Mobility data.
To gain more meaningful predictions with finer granularity, one may use zip codes or cities for
the construction of regions or clusters. We could choose clustering algorithms to determine
appropriate regions to ensure the connected zip codes stay as much as possible. However,
the Google Community Mobility data is not available at the zip code level. Therefore, our
model for prediction for regional COVID-19 is based on three regions of counties which is
the most cost-effective method for prediction of COVID-19 in Arizona.
Arizona has emerged as a COVID-19 hot spot since the stay-home orders were lifted in
mid-May. It is important to study how to slow the virus spread. This study first presents
a PDE model to describe COVID-19 cases from community transmission, transboundary
13

transmission between regions, and human activities. We apply this model for the prediction
of COVID-19 cases to see the effect of social distancing on COVID-19 cases. The numerical
results show that our new method of predicting COVID-19 cases is of acceptable high accuracy and can predict the effects of social distancing. To conclude, the prediction accuracy
and the policy simulation suggest that a combining PDE model with real data can provide
substantial information on COVID-19 spatio-temporal dynamics.
