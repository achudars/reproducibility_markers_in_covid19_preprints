Abstract
The non-population conserving SIR (SIR-NC) model to describe the spread of infections in a community is proposed and studied. Unlike the standard SIR model, SIR-NC
does not assume population conservation. Although similar in form to the standard
SIR, SIR-NC admits a closed form solution while allowing us to model mortality, and
also provides different, and arguably a more realistic, interpretation of the model parameters. Numerical comparisons of this SIR-NC model with the standard, population
conserving, SIR model are provided. Extensions to include imported infections, interacting communities, and models that include births and deaths are presented and
analyzed. Several numerical examples are also presented to illustrate these models.
Two control problems for the SIR-NC epidemic model are presented. First we consider the continuous time model predictive control in which the cost function variables
correspond to the levels of lockdown, the level of testing and quarantine, and the number of infections. We also include a switching cost for moving between lockdown levels.
A discrete time version that is more amenable to computation is then presented along
with numerical illustrations. We then consider a multi-objective and multi-community
control where we can define multiple cost functions on the different communities and
obtain the minimum cost control to keep the value function corresponding to these
control objectives below a prescribed threshold.

Introduction

1.1

Background

Epidemic models have been used in a variety of situations—modeling of the spread of an
infection in a community, spread of rumors in a community, spread of viruses in systems of
computer networks, etc. An important workhorse in this domain has been the SIR model
that was introduced by Kermack and McKendrick [17] and has received wide textbook
treatment, e.g., [7]. This classical model assumes a community where everyone interacts
with everyone in a homogeneous manner and the average behavior of these interactions are
known. In contrast, in some new applications, the community interactions are represented
by a graph and the interactions happen along the edges of the graph. See for example [10]
for models of SIR epidemics on graphs. There are also stochastic models that explictly
account for randomness, see, e.g., [2], [3].
The standard SIR model for a single community is a compartmental model in which the
population is divided into sub-populations of susceptible (S), infected (I), and recovered
(R) individuals. At time t, let S(t) be the size of the population that is susceptible to be
infected by the epidemic, I(t) be the number in the population that is currently infected
and carrying the infection, and R(t) be the number that have recovered from the infection
and are neither going to infect others nor will be infected again. Let µ be the contact rate
(contacts per unit time for each person) in the population and p be the fraction of meetings
between an infected and susceptible person in which the susceptible person gets infected.
Let γ be the rate at which an infected person recovers from the infection. Let N be size
of the population. Letting λ = µp, the o.d.e.s governing the evolution of the system are:
I(t)S(t)
,
N
I(t)S(t)
˙
I(t)
= λ
− γI(t),
N
Ṙ(t) = γI(t),
Ṡ(t) = −λ

N

= S(t) + I(t) + R(t) ≡ a constant.

(1)

Parameter λ is also called the pairwise infection rate. Observe that in this model, deaths,
hospitalizations, and isolations are not modeled. In fact, it is assumed that those that are

2

infected will continue to spread the infection during the entire time that they are carrying
the infection, i.e., till they move into the recovered state.
Since the introduction of the SIR model, a myriad variations that include many more
compartments and more detailed interactions have been proposed and studied. A key
bottleneck in the study of these models is the nonlinearity that defies easy solutions. Till
recently, explicit solutions of the basic system defined by (1) were not available. For
example, [7] only provides a rather complex approximation for R(t). Solutions for some
special cases are available, see, e.g., [22]. More recently, a parametric solution for the
general case has been described in [12]. Even here, converting the parametric form to a
time domain solution would require numerically solving an integral equation. Furthermore,
small changes to the model that would make the model more realistic makes the search for
a solution even more hopeless, as was exasparatingly noted in [19]1 .
In the absence of explicit solutions, the focus has been on numerical evaluation and
also on some key quantities of interest. For example, in the SIR model of (1), it is easy to
see that λS(0) > γ will lead to a breakout of the epidemic. It is also known that at the end
of the epidemic, the number that will not be infected will be strictly greater than 0, i.e.,
S(t) → c > 0. Several other key parameters are also of interest, especially if the infections
result in the need for hospitalizations and other healthcare resources. The popular phrase
in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic has been “flattening the curve”, i.e., to delay
and/or reduce the peak I(t). Using the parametric solution of [12], we can get a closed
form expression for the maximum value of I(t) (see (7) in a later section) in the SIR system
of (1). However, the time at which this peak is achieved has to be obtained through a
numerical solution to an integral equation.
Furthermore, in the absence of explicit solutions of the system of equations or of the
key performance indicators, control problems are even harder. Thus, not surprisingly, application of interventions by suitably modulating either of λ or γ to achieve specific control
objectives is not well studied.2 In this paper we first make an important and, what we
believe to be, a more realistic change to the basic SIR model in which we drop the population conservation assumption of (1) and propose the SIR-NC (for ‘Non-Conservative’)
epidemic model. This is motivated by first recognizing that those that recover neither
infect the others nor can they be infected by virtue of having developed immunity. (The
SIR model confers immunity on those that have recovered. As of the writing of this paper,
1

While explaining that removing the population conservation constraint would make solutions for the
even simpler SIS model impossible, the authors remark “It would seem that a fatal disease which this
models is also not good for mathematics”.

We remark here that this kind of control is different from vaccination based control whose effect is to
reduce the susceptible population. This has received significant attention in the research literature.

reinfections in COVID-19 are rare and the SIR is a very good model. The SIS model and
its variants may be used for cases where re-infections are more common.) Thus we can
treat R(t) as the part of the population that is ‘dropping out’ or removed from the system.
The outflow from the infected population could also include those that have died due to
the infection, those that are cured and are free from the infection, and also those that are
identified to be infected and hospitalized and/or quarantined. The parameter γ would then
be the sum rate of all these. If one wants to focus on, say, the recovered, denoted by R(t),
one would then have Ṙ(t) = βI(t) where β < γ is the recovery rate. Similar formalism will
be posited for the dead, the quarantined, etc. Thus our SIR-NC model allows us to model
non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs) such as early isolation and quarantining of those
that are infected through testing. Importantly, this is achieved without the addition of
any new compartments to the model.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next subsection we introduce the
SIR-NC model and present its solution in the following section. In Section 2.1 we develop
the model and present Theorem 1 that provides an explicit expression for (I(t), S(t)), the
peak value of I(t), and the time at which the peak is realized. The case of time-varying
λ and γ are also included. Theorem 1 is proved in Section 2.2. Several variations of the
basic model are discussed in Section 3—analysis of a community with imported infections
(Section 3.1), interacting communities (Section 3.2), and the SIR-NC model that allows
for natural births and deaths (Section 3.3). Numerical examples will be used to illustrate
these models. In Section 4 we discuss several control problems over a finite horizon for the
SIR-NC model after discussing the control objectives, specifically, minimum cost control
problems that control I(t) so as to achieve specific objectives. Sections 4.2 and 4.3 develop
the finite horizon continuous time and discrete time control problems. In Section 4.4,
we develop a more general multi-objective, multi-community control problem. Illustrative
numerical results are also presented.

1.2

The non-population conserving SIR (SIR-NC) model

We begin by recalling the philosophy behind the classical SIR model. This model assumes
that the population is comprised of three sub-populations of susceptible, infected, and
recovered people. Let N (t) = S(t) + I(t) + R(t) denote the total population at time t.
There are no births or deaths, based on the assumption that these are on a much slower
time scale and can therefore be ignored. When a susceptible person meets another person,
nothing happens unless the latter is infected; the fraction of such meetings with an infected
individual is

I(t)
N (t) .

The infection happens with a rate of λ > 0, whence the rate of transfer

from susceptible to infected is λ S(t)I(t)
N (t) . The infected get recovered at rate γ > 0. The
4

combined dynamics thus is
S(t)I(t)
,
N (t)
S(t)I(t)
˙
− γI(t),
I(t)
= λ
N (t)

Ṡ(t) = −λ

Ṙ(t) = γI(t).
Summing the three yields Ṅ (t) = 0, whence N (t) ≡ a constant N (say). The above
then simplifies to (1). While this classical model has been an extensively studied and
successful model in epidemiology ([13] has an excellent review, [7, 16] are examples of
excellent textbook treatments) some of its limitations stand out:
1. While birth rate can be viewed as negligible, the death rate need not be so for lethal
diseases such as Ebola or Covid-19.
2. Once you allow a nontrivial death rate, you do not have a constant population any
more and the ensuing simplification disappears. Attempts to account for deaths while
keeping the total population constant fly in the face of the microscopic picture we
started with—it requires meeting the dead on equal footing with the living.
3. Even in its pristine version, the dynamics is not easy to analyze and is usually studied
only numerically or, as we have said previously, using messy approximations and hard
to use parametric forms.
Motivated by this, we present here an alternative model that goes back to [11] and
offers two clear advantages:
1. It is analytically tractable.
2. It is easy to incorporate nontrivial death rate into this model.
Our model does not match the microscopic model which led to SIR as the corresponding
macroscopic behavior. Nevertheless, we can interpret it by introducing different time scales
as we shall soon see in Lemma 1 below. The key observation we start with is what is already
implicit in the SIR model above, viz., that the recovered neither infect nor get infected
(i.e., they become immune). They affect the evolution of S(t) and I(t) only through the
probabilities of pairwise meetings between susceptible and infected, because R(t) enters
the normalizing factor N (t) ≡ N . In our model we count only those pairwise meetings that
matter, i.e., the meetings wherein a susceptible agent meets another susceptible or infected
person. This is legitimate because the constraint that the total population is conserved is
5

now dropped, whence the recovered can be legitimately viewed as having ‘dropped out’.
We add the additional proviso that a susceptible person meets a large number of susceptible
or infected persons—not necessarily the whole population, but a large enough statistically
representative portion thereof. Then the probability of a susceptible person meeting an
e (t) := S(t) + I(t). By a reasoning analogous to the above,
infected person is I(t) where N
e (t)
N

the equations now become (with an additional tweak we mention later)
Ṡ(t) = −λ

S(t)I(t)
,
e (t)
N

S(t)I(t)
˙
I(t)
= λ
− γI(t),
e (t)
N

Ṙ(t) = βI(t).

The additional change we have made is to replace γ by 0 < β < γ in the third equation.
That is, we allow for deaths due to the disease (more generally, including quarantine etc.)
e (t) cannot be expected to be a constant, because the right hand
at rate γ − β. Clearly, N
side does not add to zero. This is not a complication, but a blessing in disguise, because
now R(t) does not affect the evolution of S(t) and I(t) at all, in conformity with our view

that the recovered ‘fall out of the system’. Furthermore, the interpretation of λ in this
model is different. This is described below.
Even before we discuss this any further, we wish to underscore the fact that this is not
a case of sub-sampling random pairwise meetings that happen only one at a time on the
microscopic scale in the standard SIR model. That would lead to a different dynamics. In
other words, suppose that the individual meetings happen on a common Poisson clock with
a fixed rate and we choose to observe only those between the susceptible and the infected
e (t)
or the susceptible. Any reasonable continuum limit of this should also re-scale γ as γ/N
because of the time scaling implicit in the above sampling. Our model is distinct from this

scenario in that it requires each person to meet a statistically significant portion of the
entire population ‘at one go’. This is, for example, what would happen at the workplace,
in the school, during the commute, etc. This is also the view in the agent based simulation
model implemented in [15]. What this stands for is that the ‘atomic’ or individual pairwise
meetings take place on a faster time scale than the death rate due to the epidemic, which
is a reasonable assumption. A simple scenario would be the discrete dynamics
Sn+1 = Sn − ǫSn ζn ,
In+1 = In + ǫIn (ζn − γ),

6

where ǫ is the discrete time step, ζn is an indicator random variable corresponding to a
pairwise meeting which is 0 if it is benign (i.e., susceptible meeting susceptible) and 1 if
not (i.e., susceptible meeting infected). The conditional probability that ζn = 1 given the
n
past is proportional to the fraction of infected population, say λ SnI+I
. Thinking of ǫ as
n

a small time step, γ remains removal (or recovery) rate per unit time as ǫ ↓ 0, but the

random meetings {ζn } start crowding on the scale Θ 1ǫ per unit time. Then the averaging

effect kicks in and we get the desired dynamics in the limit. To make this precise, define
S ǫ (t), I ǫ (t), t ≥ 0, by
S ǫ (nǫ) = Sn , I ǫ (nǫ) = In ,
with linear interpolation on [nǫ, (n + 1)ǫ] for n ≥ 0. Then we have:


2
= O(ǫ).
Lemma 1. For any T > 0, E supt∈[0,T ] kS ǫ (t) − S(t)
This is a special case of Lemma 1, p. 103, of [4]. In fact, this is the standard averaging
effect of two time scale dynamics. Note that the interpretation of parameter λ gets modified
from that for the original SIR model.
Getting back to our model, the most significant observation is what we have already
made, viz., that S(t), I(t) obey a self-contained two dimensional differential equation which,
as it turns out, is explicitly solvable as we shall see later.

Analysis of the SIR-NC model
The model and its implications

In this section we analyze the SIR-NC model in detail. As we elaborated in the previous
section, the R(t) only have a one-way coupling with I(t), the infected population. We thus
have that
R(t) = β

Z

I(s)ds

which can be explicitly computed once I(·) is known. Therefore the SIR-NC system that
we need to analyze is
I(t)S(t)
,
S(t) + I(t)
I(t)S(t)
˙
I(t)
= λ
− γI(t).
S(t) + I(t)

Ṡ(t) = −λ

(3)

Of course, we should have I(0) > 0 and define S(0) + I(0) = N (0). We could also have
R(0) > 0, but since they do not affect the evolution, R(0) = 0 is without loss of generality.
This change to non-conservation allows us to provide explicit expressions for S(t), I(t),
Imax := the peak value of I(t), and Tmax := the time at which it is attained (Theorem 1).
This in turn helps us define several control problems with the many different control
objectives to shape the evolution of the epidemic.
It is easy to see that the condition for an epidemic to break out in SIR-NC is

Remark The last equation is arrived at simply by putting the time derivative of I(·) equal
to zero. This need not have a unique solution, nor need every solution correspond to a
maximum, even a local maximum.
We now compare the computations from this model with that of the standard popula8

tion conserving SIR model. First, R(t) for the SIR-NC is obtained by using I(t) from (4)
in (2). Compare this with with the following approximation from [7]. Here ρ = λ/γ.

Next, compare the computation of Tmax in SIR-NC as above with that in the SIR model
using the the parametric form of S(t) and I(t) from [12]. The following is adapted from
[24].

As can be seen, t does not have a closed form solution.
Finally, we consider the computation of Imax . In the SIR model we can see that the
maximum of I(t) occurs for u = S(0) γλ in (6) and the Imax in the SIR system can be
evaluated as

the trajectory of I(t) for the same parameter values. Recall that in the SIR model of (1),
there is no removal and the entire population of N interact with each other. In SIR-NC
for the same λ, the N (t) is a non-increasing function of t and the growth of I(t) is faster
in the beginning. This can be seen in Fig. 1 that compares the trajectory of I(t) and S(t)
for the two models. It is also instructive to compare Imax and Tmax for the two models;
Fig. 2 compares the

Imax
N

for the SIR and the SIR-NC models as a function of ρ = γ/λ. As

expected, Imax in SIR-NC is higher than that in SIR. Table 1 lists Tmax for the SIR and
SIR-NC systems for different values of N, λ, and γ. Interestingly, we see that Tmax in both
the systems are very nearly the same. We performed these computations for several more
parameters and this observation appears to be more generally true.
In the rest of the paper, we will only consider the SIR-NC model.
In Fig. 3 we show how Imax and Tmax behave if the infected could be removed at a faster
rate than the natural removal rate. The marginal relative increase in Tmax is significantly
lower than the marginal decrease in Imax for small γ1 . In the example, observe that doubling
Tmax (from about 55 to 110) requires γ1 > 0.11, i.e., about 11% of those infected should
be removed via testing. However, halving Imax (from about 4500 to about 2250) requires
only γ1 = 0.07.
We now illustrate the case of time varying λ and γ. Observe that if we assume that
λ(t) and γ(t) are piecewise constant, taking values (λi , γi ) in intervals (ti−1 , ti ), I(t) can

Figure 4: Evolution of I(t) for the SIR-NC model when λ, γ or both are functions of
time. We have used a = 0.5 and T = 20. The other parameters are N = 10, 000 λ = 1/4,

We now consider more general cases that may be applicable in epidemic conditions.
We argue later that the following explicit form of λ(t) would be of interest.

λ(t) =

aλ

for t > 0 and t ∈
/ (t1 , t1 + T )
t ∈ (t1 , t1 + T )

where 0 < a ≤ 1. This models a limited lockdown period during which there would be
a significant reduction in the contact rate and hence the infectivity. Further, we will
use γ(t) = γ0 (1 + bt) which models a super-exponential increase in testing capacity and
isolation. In Fig. 4a, γ(t) is a constant (γ0 ) and λ(t) has the form above. We plot I(t) for
different values of t1 . We see that an early lockdown (corresponding to t1 = 15 and 25) only
delays the Tmax but does not change Imax . If the lockdown is started close to the peak, it
results in ‘second wave’ with the second peak being lower than the first. A moderate delay
in the start of the lockdown (t1 = 40) arrests the first growth but does not significantly
affect Imax or Tmax . If the lockdown starts close to the peak, I(t) comes down sharply but
causes a second peak! In Fig. 4b we plot I(t) keeping λ(t) constant, i.e., no lockdowns,
and use γ(t) as above. This is to be expected because, the lockdowns only postpone the
inevitable. bserve that even a small amount of increased testing and quarantining can be
very effective in reducing Imax significantly; a 1% increase in the rate of removal per unit
time (doubling testing capacity in 70 time units) reduces Imax by about 30% whereas a 3%
(double capacity in 24 days) can decrease Imax by 70%. Tmax is not affected significantly
in this. Finally, in Fig. 4c, we plot I(t) when there is lockdown and also the γ is increased.
We see that a lockdown and increased testing can bring the epidemic under control.
The preceding motivates us to propose formal optimal control frameworks. They are

Proof of Theorem 1

Letting
x(t) :=
y(t) :=

S(t)
,
S(t) + I(t)
I(t)
S(t) + I(t)

we have x(t) + y(t) ≡ 1. Also, x(0) < 1 (by the assumption that I(0) > 0). We can rewrite
ẋ(t) and ẏ(t) as follows.

Ṡ(t)
S(t)(Ṡ(t) + I(t))
−
S(t) + I(t)
(S(t) + I(t))2
= −λx(t)y(t) − x(t)(−λx(t)y(t) + λx(t)y(t) − γy(t))

ẋ(t) =

= λx(t)y(t) − γy(t) − y(t)(−λx(t)y(t) + λx(t)y(t) − γy(t))

ẏ(t) =

= λx(t)y(t) − γy(t) + γy(t)2
= (λ − γ)y(t)(1 − y(t)).
Then ẋ(t) + ẏ(t) =

+ y(t)) = 0 as expected. Now
ẋ(t) = (γ − λ)x(t)(1 − x(t))

For γ < λ, x(t) → 0 and y(t) → 1 as expected, i.e., for x(0) ∈ [0, 1), (0, 1) is the
asymptotically stable equilibrium. It also follows by setting t = 0 that x(0) =

Clearly, I(t) > 0 ∀ t ≥ 0. Thus we also see that Ṅ (t) < 0, implying N (t) ↓ N (∞) ≥ 0.
Then I(t) = y(t)N (t) → 0. Also, from the explicit expression for S(t), we have S(t) → 0,
thus N (∞) = 0.

Further Variations

We now consider several variations of the basic SIR-NC model that we introduced in the
previous section. Specifically, we present two types of variations and characterize the solutions. The first set of variations is motivated by the actions of several communities during
the COVID-19 pandemic. Communities are isolating themselves to different degrees and
also applying differing degrees of social distancing rules within the community. To analyze
this, in Section 3.1 we consider the case when a community has ‘imported infections’, i.e.,
an external agency introduces infections into the community at a steady rate. In Section 3.2
we use the results of Section 3.1 to analyze the interaction two separate communnities that
interact with each other. We obtain explicit characterizations for both these models. The
second variation is to introduce natural births and deaths in Section 3.3 where we analyze
the equilibrium behaviour of the model.

3.1

SIR-NC with imported infections

In many communities, infections are also induced by interactions with other communities.
Assume that each of the susceptible in the population meets µe persons from outside of the
community and pe of those meetings result in an infection. Defining ν = pe µe , we have the

3.1.1

Numerical Examples

We now illustrate this model with some numerical examples. Fig. 5a illustrates I(t) for
different values of ν. Observe that even a small ν advances Tmax significantly, ν = 0.01λ
reduces Tmax by nearly half (from about 55 to about 29). This dependence is studied in
more detail in Fig. 5b that shows Tmax and Imax as a function of ν. The marginal reduction
in Tmax is significant for small values of ν but Imax is less dramatic.

SIR-NC in interacting communities

Now consider two interacting communities, labeled a and b, that have different intracommunity contact and infection infection rates, and in addition, inter-community contact
and infection rates. Let Na and Nb be the size of the two communities. Defining λa , λb ,

ẋb (t) = fb (xa (t), xb (t)) := −(λb − γb )xb (t)(1 − xb (t)) − λab xb (t)(1 − xa (t)),
and an analogous dynamics for (ya (·), yb (·)). This is a cooperative dynamics in the sense
of [14] and by virtue of having bounded trajectories, will converge for almost all initial
conditions to the set of its equilibria. These can be found by setting the right hand side
equal to zero, and their stability can be analyzed using local linearization. We do not
pursue this here. This equation, however, is not analytically tractable. So we aim for an
approximate solution by assuming that λab = ǫ, 0 < ǫ <<
horizon of interest. Let

Si0 (t), Ii0 (t), i

where T > 0 is the time

to ǫ = 0. Then for general ǫ > 0, we can use the results of the preceding section to obtain

(:= the corresponding peaking time) as follows.

However, the two are coupled. We can decouple them by resorting to the approxima-

This is an exact expression for the net perturbation of the solution, albeit implicit. The
second term on the right is O(ǫ). Thus if we ignore the O(ǫ2 ) terms, we can write
X ǫ (t, t0 ; S0 , I0 , R0 ) ≈ X(t, t0 ; S0 , I0 ) +
Z t
Φ(t, s; S(s, t0 ; S0 , I0 ), I(s, t0 ; S0 , I0 ))ε(s)ds.

t0

This gives an explicit expression for the net perturbation of the solution, albeit only approximate to within O(ǫ2 ). Note, however, that this approximation will be valid only for
a finite time interval, because the hypothesis that ε(t) = O(ǫ) may not continue to hold
unless T is small. For computational purposes, the above procedure can be repeated over
such small time intervals.
Remark: The case of λab 6= λba is also of interest, e.g., when one community practices
the safety recommendations more strictly than the other community. This case can be
analyzed analogously.
3.2.1

Numerical Examples

Fig. 6 illustrates the effects of the intercommunity interaction rates, λab and λba , on I(t)
when different kinds of communities interact. In Fig. 6a we consider two similar communities with the same initial population and same λ. The trajectories for I(t) for both
communities are, as is to be expected, identical. However, even a small amount of interaction can significantly affect the trajectory, leading to increased Imax and a reduced Tmax .
This is in line with the results of the preceding subsection. In Fig. 6b, we see that when
λa = λb and λab = λba , and the sizes are significantly different, the trajectories of I(t) are

Na = Nb and λa 6= λb while λab = λba , then even a small amount of interactions matter
as can be seen in the significant shift in both Tmax and Imax for community a which has a
lower λ. This is seen in Fig. 6c. Finally, in Fig. 6d we show Ia (t) and Ib (t) when there is
asymmetry in the two communities both in terms of the size and the λ. It is more interesting to see Ia (t) + Ib (t) for this last case, as shown in Fig. 7. Observe that if the interaction
is small, the total I(t) has a comparatively ‘fatter’ middle, possibly with a double hump.
This disappears when the interactions increase.

Introducing births and ‘normal’ deaths

The models for long duration epidemics, like the way Covid-19 is expected to be, should
include natural births and deaths. The standard SIR model has been extended to include
natural births and deaths. However, almost all the models continue to make the population
conservation assumption—the natural death rate is equal to the birth rate and the total
population is conserved. The SIR-NC model naturally allows for unconstrained birth and
death rates. Thus in this section we describe the SIR-NC model that includes births and
natural deaths with no constraints on the rates. However, if we introduce some restrictions
on the parameters, not unlike those that are derived from the standard SIR model, we can
provide additional insights to the properties of the evolution of the epidemic. Here, we
make the natural assumption that all births are susceptible.
Consider the dynamics with a small birth rate and a small death rate for ‘normal’
deaths (as opposed to deaths due to the epidemic), given by:
S ǫ (t)I ǫ (t)
+ κS ǫ (t) + υ1 I ǫ (t) + υ2 Rǫ (t),
N ǫ (t)
S ǫ (t)I ǫ (t)
− γI ǫ (t) − ν1 I ǫ (t),
I˙ǫ (t) = λ
N ǫ (t)

Ṡ ǫ (t) = −λ

Ṙǫ (t) = βI ǫ (t) − ν2 Rǫ (t),

(26)
(27)
(28)

where N ǫ (t) = S ǫ (t)+ I ǫ (t)+ Rǫ (t) and κ, υi , νi = O(ǫ), i = 1, 2, for some 0 < ǫ << 1. Note
that we have now included the recovered, i.e., Rǫ (t) in the definition of the normalizing
factor N ǫ (t) in view of the fact that it directly affects the evolution of S ǫ (·) given by (26)
and can therefore no longer be viewed as having ‘dropped out’. The υi ’s are birth rates and
the νi ’s the rates of normal deaths for the infected and recovered populations respectively,
and are positive. The parameter κ is the net rate of birth minus normal deaths for the
susceptible population, and can be either positive or negative.
In Fig. 8 we show the trajectories of S(t), I(t), and R(t) for this model for three different

cases: birth rate higher than natual death rate, balanced birth and natural death rates,
and natural death rates higher than birth rates. We show both the short term and the
long term trajectories. Observe that in all the cases, there are significant oscillations in
S(t), I(t), and R(t). The long term trajectory of I(t) for the three cases are shown in more
detail in Fig. 9. We observe that I(t) decays very slowly and I(3000) has values 219, 102,
and 50 for the three cases of, respectively, excess births, balanced, excess deaths.
The preceding observations can be made more precise with the following additional
assumption:
(†) κ ≤ 0, υ1 − ν1 < γ, υ2 ≤ ν2 .
This in particular includes the case of
(††) κ = 0, υi = νi for i = 1, 2,
corresponding to a balance of birth rate and the rate of natural deaths community-wise.
The former also includes the case of excess of natural death rates over the birth rates.
Theorem 3. Under (†), X̂(t) := (S ǫ (t), I ǫ (t), Rǫ (t)) converges to (0, 0, 0) for almost all
initial conditions.
Proof. Summing up the equations (26)-(28), we have
Ṅ ǫ (t) ≤ −(γ − β)I ǫ (t) < 0,
e ǫ (t) ↓ N ≥ 0. If N = 0, there is nothing to
since I ǫ (0) =⇒ I ǫ (t) > 0 ∀ t > 0. Then N

prove, so suppose N > 0. Then every limiting trajectory (S ′ (·), I ′ (·), R′ (·)) of (26)-(28) in
the ω-limit set Ω of (26)-(28) must satisfy I ′ (·) ≡ 0. But then (28) forces R′ (·) ≡ 0, so that

S ′ (·) ≡ N . But (0, 0, N ) is an unstable equilibrium for N > 0, since a small perturbation
that renders I ′ (0) > 0 will make the trajectory move away from it. The claim follows.
Therefore a necessary condition for non-extinction is that at least oneof the subcommunities should have a non-zero value for rate of birth minus the rate of normal deaths,
i.e., κ > 0, or v1 > ν1 , or v2 > ν2 . The most interesting aspect of this analysis is the case
(††), which subsumes the conditions under which the classical SIR model is derived. Recall
that in the classical SIR model, non-extinction is possible. For SIR-NC, however, even a
small death rate due to the epidemic leads to extinction.
More generally, we can say the following.
Theorem 4. The dynamics (26)-(28) either,
1. converges to (0, 0, 0) for generic initial conditions, or,
2. does not equilibrate for generic parameter values.
25

Proof. If (s, i, r) is an equilibrium of the above system, we perforce have r =

β
ν2 i

by setting

the right hand side of (28) to zero and therefore the equilibrium equations obtained by
setting the right hand side of (26)-(27) equal to zero reduce to

Then for any non-zero equilibrium, i > 0 and s = ζi/κ where ζ := γ + ν1 − υ1 −

This

fixes the value of λ in terms of the other parameters. Thus for all but one value of λ, the
dynamics does not equilibrate.

Optimal Control of the SIR-NC Epidemic

4.1

The control problem

We now discuss another key objective of this paper—to define associated control problems.
The following objectives are of obvious interest to the controller.
• Increasing Tmax : this allows the healthcare system to prepare better to treat the
infected population, especially those that may develop severe symptoms.
• Decreasing Imax : This reduces the preparation cost.
• Decreasing Te , the time to end the epidemic: This would mean that the system can
get back to normalcy quicker.
• Achieve herd immunity by T0 .
In addition one could also define more detailed objectives, e.g., define objectives similar to
the preceding for specific communities that may or may not interact.
Two parameters are available for control; λ := the spreading rate and γ := the removal
rate. Recall that in the original SIR model, λ is the product of µ := the rate at which
people meet (or more accurately, are in physical proximity), and p := the probability of
the proximity resulting in an infection. In SIR-NC, we have separated the relative time
scales of the two processes, but the interpretation remains. While p is more likely to be a
feature of the infection and the community, µ can be controlled through measures such as
imposing social distancing and varying degrees of lockdown. Hence we let λ take finitely
many discrete levels. Further, as we have argued earlier, the recovered population is viewed
as removal. In practice, increasing the removal rate is effected by identifying the infected
early, i.e., by increased testing and quarantining of those that test positive. We assume
26

that the testing capacity can be continuously varied and thus allow γ ∈ a suitable interval
of ℜ+ .
Specifically, we assume that λ ∈ L := {ℓ1 , · · · , ℓM }, i.e., takes discrete values, with
switching cost (ℓ′ , ℓ′′ ) 7→ c(ℓ′ , ℓ′′ ) > 0 when ℓ′ 6= ℓ′′ and = 0 when ℓ′ = ℓ′′ . It is customary
and sensible to assume that c satisfies the ‘triangle inequality’
c(ℓi , ℓk ) < c(ℓi , ℓj ) + c(ℓj , ℓk )
for distinct ℓi , ℓj , ℓk ∈ L, in order to avoid some pathologies. On the other hand, γ can be
continuously manipulated as a function of the current state. We first consider as the state
process y(t) =

I(t)
N (t)

∈ [0, 1] introduced earlier. Later on we shall also consider the full state

(S(t), I(t)). We let γ : [0, 1] 7→ [0, Γ] for some Γ ≥ 0.
We consider a finite horizon control problem. There is a very good motivation for doing
so. For scenarios such as this, Model Predictive Control (MPC) [18] is often the paradigm
of choice, where at time t, one solves a finite horizon optimal control problem on time
horizon [t, t + T ] and uses the optimal control choice for time t at time t. However, as time
moves forward, to say t′ > t, one again solves a new finite horizon problem on [t′ , t′ +T ] and
the process is repeated for each time instant. The basis of this procedure is the solution
of a finite horizon problem, so we have preferred it over other alternatives.

4.2

Continuous time control

We begin with the continuous time formulation. Let T > 0 be the time horizon under
consideration. There is a per unit time running cost k(y(t), λ(t), γ(t)) ≥ 0 and a terminal
cost h(y(T )) ≥ 0. The objective is to minimize the cost

X

c(λ(τi− ), λ(τi )) + h(y(T ))

(29)

s≤τi ≤T

for s = 0. Here {τi } are the times when λ(t) makes a discrete switch between two values
in L, λ(τi− ), λ(τi ) denoting resp., the value of λ(·) just before the switch and just after the
switch. The value function then will be a map
V : (y ′ , ℓ, s) ∈ R+ × L × R+ 7→ V (y ′ , ℓ, s) ∈ R+ .
defined as the infimum of (29) over all admissible choices of λ(t), γ(t), τi , T ≥ τi ; τi , t ≥ s,
with y(s) = y ′ , λ(s) = ℓi . For ease of notation, we shall write V (y, ℓi , t) simply as V i (y, t)
and the corresponding running cost k(y, ℓi , γ) as ki (y, γ). Since this is a mixed switching

27

and continuous control problem, the Hamilton-Jacobi system here is a system of quasivariational inequalities given by: for all i,


(30)
(31)

(32)
(33)

The explanation is as follows. In absence of any switching of the λ parameter, (30)
with equality would be the standard Hamilton-Jacobi equation of dynamic programming
for continuous control. The same will be true now when you don’t switch. When it is
better to switch, continuing with the continuous control without switching will not be
optimal, so inequality should hold. This explains (30). Inequality (31) is in similar spirit
for the discrete control decision of switching: equality holds when it is optimal to switch,
inequality holds otherwise. At any instant, it is either optimal to switch or to continue
with the optimal continuous control. This leads to (32). Finally, (33) is the boundary
condition given by the terminal cost.
Given a solution of this system, one uses λ(t) = ℓi when
V i (y(t), t) < min(c(ℓi , ℓj ) + V j (y(t), t),
j6=i

along with the continuous control γ(t) := a measurable selection from the minimizers of

Since we are in a finite horizon, a discretization can be solved by simple backward recursion.
Next we state an alternative framework based on the actual state variables, i.e., the
pair (S(t), I(t)). The advantage of using y(t) as state variable is that it is a bounded scalar
and therefore easier to handle. It also reflects the costs associated with I(t) somewhat
faithfully. Nevertheless, it is not the real thing and computational power permitting, it
may be better to stay with the actual variables. We shall use the same notation for the cost

4.3

Discrete time control problem

Unfortunately, the quasi-variational inequalities for first order systems are difficult to analyze and are usually not well-posed in the classical sense. For this reason, most work in
this direction has been in the framework of viscosity solutions [9, 8, 25]. We shall take
recourse to a simpler alternative, viz., to consider a discrete skeleton of the problem, which
leads to a simple backward recursion.
We should mention here that there is already some work on pure impulse control of
this model, i.e., without the continuous control [6], [20]. This is technically a little easier
and does not run into some of the aforementioned technical issues.
Let a > 0 be a small time-discretization step. A discretization of the underlying
dynamics is given by the Euler scheme for the original continuous dynamics as:



λ(t)S(t)I(t)
S(t + 1) = S(t) − a
,
S(t) + I(t)


λ(t)S(t)
I(t + 1) = I(t) + aI(t)
− γ(t) ,
S(t) + I(t)

(38)
(39)

for t = 0, 1, 2, · · · . We again use the same notation as before for cost functions and the
value function. The objective is to minimize

s≤τi <T

29

c(λ(τi− ), λ(τi )) + h(S(T ), I(T ))

(40)

for s = 0. The value function V i (S ′ , I ′ , s) is then the infimum of (40) over all admissible
λ(t), γ(t), τi , T ≥ t, τi ≥ s, beginning at λ(s) = ℓi and S(s) = S ′ , I(s) = I ′ . The quasivariational inequalities can be written along the lines of the foregoing, but for discrete
systems, they can be put in the form of a very convenient backward recursion. Let Z(t) =
(S(t), I(t)) and write the above discrete dynamics (38)-(39) compactly as
Z(t + 1) = F (Z(t), λ(t), γ(t)), t ≥ 0.

(41)

Then the discrete quasi-variational inequalities reduce to the simple backward recursion of
dynamic programming given by


V i (z, t) = min c(ℓi , ℓj ) + kj (z, u, t) + V j (F (z, ℓj , u), t + 1) , 0 ≤ t < T,
j,u

(42)

with terminal condition V i (z, T ) = h(z).
Remark (40) can also be used for the population conserving SIR model with an appropriate version of the discrete dynamics for (41). We do not pursue this here.
If the objective is to minimize the peak over this interval, we augment the dynamics
(38)-(39) with an additional state variable, viz., the running maximum M (t) := max0≤s≤t I(s)
with its update equation
M (t + 1) = max(M (t), I(t + 1)).

(43)

The new state now is Z(t) = (S(t), I(t), M (t)) with dynamics
Z(t + 1) = F (Z(t), λ(t), γ(t))
for a suitably redefined F . The dynamic programming equation is the same as before with
ki ≡ 0 ∀i and h((s, i, m)) = m.
4.3.1

Numerical Examples

We now illustrate the preceding control problem via numerical examples. In our computations, we minimize (40) subject to (41) with a time-discretization step of a = 1, treating
it as an optimization problem, and use a simple forward tree search to solve it.
We consider a community with N = 10, 000, natural λ of 1/4, and natural γ, designated
as γ0 , of 1/15. Recall from the example in Section 2.1 that for this system Tmax = 55.4 and
Imax = 4523. We assume that the control objective at time t would be to have the number
of infected at time (t + T ) to be a fraction α(t + T ) of the value in the uncontrolled system,

30

which we will denote by Io (t + T ). With this view, we use the following cost function h(·)
h(S(t + T ), I(t + T )) = A1 ea1 (I(t+T )−αIo (t+T )) ,
with a1 A2 to be constants. This function penalizes missing the the target significantly more
than the reward for exceeding it. In our computations we have used a1 = 10, A1 = 100,
and T = 3. To model an aggressive control objective we use α(t) = 0.1 for all t. To model
a potentially more modest objective, we use

α(t) =


1 −

0.9
Tmax t

for 0 ≤ t ≤ 55

0.1

for t > Tmax

This corresponds to slowly increasing the requirement reaching 0.1Imax at Tmax .
We assume M = 3, i.e., there are three contact rates among the members of the community corresponding to three levels of lockdown. We use L = {1/4, 3/16, 1/8} corresponding
to, respectively, no lockdown, a partial lockdown, and a total lockdown. The switching
costs are

The cost of switching to a lower λ is significantly higher than to switch to a higher λ. We
use a2 = 10, 000 in the simulations.
The running cost, k(·), will have the following additive components.
• Cost due to the chosen level of lockdown; we will use L1 = 0, L3 = 10L2 corresponding
to the costs of the three levels of the lockdown. We use L2 = 10, 000.
• Cost of testing and quarantining. This will be an increasing function of the rate of
removal of the infected subpopulation in excess of the natural rate of 1/15 and the
number that are infected, I(t). At the beginning of the epidemic, it may be hard to
obtain the testing kits and to also define the protocol and will hence be very costly
to achieve a high rate of removal. Eventually, the time dependent cost becomes
negligible. This leads us to propose the following function for this component: (A2 +
A3
t )I(t) (γ(t)

− γ0 ) . We use A2 = A3 = 100 in the examples. Further, we discretise

the feasible γ(t) to 10 levels in the interval [1/15, 1/3]
• A fraction of the infected will be hospitalised. There may be other knock-on effects
of prolonged illnesses due to the infection, less attention to other endemic diseases
like tuberculosis, hypertension, and diabetes. Finally, if I(t) is allowed to become

too large, hospital space may become unavailabele. This suggests A4 I(t)a3 to be the
form for this component. In our computations, we have used A4 = 10 and consider
a3 in the range (1, 1.5). There is an interesting change in the behaviour of the cost
functions and the control variable as a3 is increased from 1.0. We will see this later.
From the preceding discussion, we have

k(S(t), I(t), λ(t), γ(t)) = Lλ(t) + A2 +
I(t) (γ(t) − γ0 ) + A4 I(t)a3

In Figs. 10 and 11 we plot I(t), γ(t) and the running cost for different a3 and α(t).
There are several takeaways from these results. For the parameters chosen, the switching
costs and the running cost of reduced λ was too high for the system to switch λ, thus
λ(t) = 1/4 was the control for all the parameters. As we changed a3 from 1.0 to 1.2,
for decreasing α(t), the change in both I(t) and γ(t) was barely noticeable. This was
the case even when α(t) was held constant at 0.1. However as we changed a3 from 1.2 to
1.35 the changes were significant both in shape and magnitude of I(t), γ(t), and the total
32

running cost. This can be seen when comparing the plots in Figs. 10 and 11. A higher
a3 induces higher levels of control and hence reduced I(t) this in turn reduced the running
cost. Observe that there is an order of magnitude reduction in I(t) and in the cost. Thus
a higher ‘valuation’ for infections induces a higher level control which in turn reduces costs
in the long run.

Multi-objective and multi-community control

As we have seen at the beginning of this section, there are several competing criteria we may
want to optimize and focusing on just one at the expense of others may not be wise. We
therefore propose here a multi-objective control scheme inspired by [23]. We shall assume
that the state space ℜ+ × ℜ+ is now suitably discretized and denoted by S. Likewise, the
dynamics (41) is suitably replaced by a dynamics on S, where we retain the same notation
as (41) for sake of simplicity. For example, the original F could be replaced by F followed
by a suitable vector quantization scheme. As already noted, some cost criteria may require
a suitable augmentation of the state space.
i (·, ·, ·)), switching cost functions
Consider K > 1 running cost functions k1i (·, ·, ·), · · · , kK

c1 (·, ·), · · · , cK (·, ·) and terminal cost functions h1 (·), · · · , hK (·). Let C1 , · · · , CK > 0
denote prescribed numbers. Let (i, z, t) 7→ Vji (z, t), 1 ≤ j ≤ K, denote the value function
corresponding to the jth running cost function kj· (·, ·, ·), switching cost function cj (·, ·),
and terminal cost hj (·). Our objective will be to ensure that for given initial condition
z = z0 of the state and the initial choice ℓi0 of the discrete control variable,
Vji0 (z0 , 0) ≤ Cj ∀j.

Let (qn (·, ·), vn (·, ·))) : (ℜ+ )2 × {0, 1, · · · , T } 7→

L × [0, Γ], n ≥ 0, be a sequence of stationary policies such that (qn (z, m), vn (z, m)) attains
the minimum on the right hand side of (47).
Theorem 5. Every stationary policy obtained as a limit point of (qn , vn ) as n ↑ ∞ satisfies
(44).
This is proved exactly as in [23]. In fact, the scenario here is vastly simpler than that
of ibid. due to absence of noise, asynchrony, etc. We only sketch the key steps here,
referring the reader to [23] for further details. First, observe that (50) is a special case the
replicator dynamics of evolutionary biology [21]. As in [23], the discrete iteration (which
can be viewed as the Euler scheme for (50) with slowly decreasing stepsizes) tracks the
asymptotic behavior of (50). The condition (49) plays a key role here: since a(n) plays the
role of a time step in the time discretization of (50), (49) ensures that the entire time axis
34

is covered, so that the asymptotic behavior of (50) can be tracked. We do not, however,
P
need the standard condition in stochastic approximation algorithms that n a(n)2 < ∞

which features in [23], because we have a purely deterministic iteration without any noise.
Thus the problem is reduced to establishing that (50) indeed converges to the desired set.
This is already proved in [23].
Next we consider the control of two interacting communities like in Section 3.2 with the
stipulation that the dynamics of one evolves on a much faster scale than the other. One
possible scenario is a dense slum interacting with a geographically sparse affluent section.
Following Section 3.2, we model this as the coupled system

Here 0 < ε << 1 is a small parameter that renders the evolution of (Sb (t), Ib (t)) to
be on a slower time scale. Following the standard philosophy for analyzing two time scale
systems, we view the slow time scale dynamics as quasi-static for purposes of analyzing the
dynamics on the fast time scale and treat the fast time scale dynamics as quasi-equilibrated
for the purposes of analyzing the slow dynamics. Thus for the former, we consider the
system

≈ a constant Z. This coincides with our model of SIR-NC with

imported infections. If we follow the standard procedure described above, then under the
condition λab < λa − γa , the asymptotic equilibrium is the origin, i.e., extinction, which
means that the fast variables simply drop out and the slow dynamics can be analyzed as a
single community dynamics. To get something more informative than this, we propose the
following, particularly in the context of the control problem. Choose ε < a << T above

35

so that the time horizon T > 0 is divisible by a and a is divisible by ε. (If not, we can
replace T /a, a/ε by ⌈T /a⌉, ⌈a/ε⌉ resp. in what follows.)
Consider the discrete time intervals Kn := {t(n), t(n) + εa, · · · , t(n + 1)} for 0 ≤ n <
NT :=

T
aε .

On the interval Kn , beginning with n = NT − 1 and going backward in time,

do the following:
1. Consider the discretized dynamics for state variables (Sa (n), Ia (n)) corresponding to
(57)–(58) for each possible value of Z := Ib (t(n + 1))/Nb (t(n + 1)).
2. Solve the dynamic programming equation on the discrete time interval Jn := {t(n), t(n)+
a/ε, t(n) + 2a/ε, · · · , t(n + 1)} for the discretized dynamics of (57)-(58) with terminal
cost := the time t(n + 1) value function inherited from the preceding computation
on [t(n + 1), t(n + 2)] if t(n) < NT , and := h otherwise, so as to obtain the value
function for m ∈ Jn and initial (i.e., at time T (n)) condition (s, i) ∈ (ℜ+ )2 .
Compute the optimal trajectory of (Sa (m), Ia (m)), m ∈ Jn .
3. Solve the dynamic programming equation for the discretized dynamics for (Sb (m), Ib (m)), 0 ≤
m ≤ NT , with (Sa (m), Ia (m)) = the value thereof at t(m) for the optimal trajectory
in the preceding step on [t(m), t(m + 1)] (= the initial condition if m = 0).
This emulates the two time scale phenomenon above on two superimposed discrete
skeletons of the time axis, one being a refinement of the other.

Discussion and Conclusions

We have proposed a variant of the classical SIR model wherein we drop the key assumption
of conservation of population size. This Non-Conservative SIR or SIR-NC for short, has
the advantage of being analytically tractable, leading to explicit expressions in the simple
cases, and in addition, being more realistic for lethal pandemics. We also introduced several
variations of the basic model, such as inclusion of natural birth and death rates, external
inputs, interacting communities, etc. While some preliminary results have been presented
for these, they open up many new directions for future work.
Finally, we consider controlled versions of the above. After introducing a variety of
control objectives and arguing that Model Predictive Control is a natural framework for
pandemic control, we propose a finite horizon control problem. First we do so for the
original continuous time case, leading to a system of quasi-variational inequalities due to
co-occurrence of continuous controls with discrete controls that also have switching costs.
We point out the technical difficulties therein and resort to a discrete version, leading to
36

drastic simplification. We also consider multi-objective control in this framework. Finally,
we briefly touch upon interacting communities with significantly separated time scales and
propose an approximation scheme for analyzing the associated control problems. Once
again, this opens up rich possibilities for future work.
