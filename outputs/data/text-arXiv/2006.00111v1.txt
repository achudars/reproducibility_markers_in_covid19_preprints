ABSTRACT
The continuously growing number of COVID-19 cases pressures healthcare services worldwide1 . Accurate short-term
forecasting is thus vital to support country-level policy making2 . The strategies adopted by countries to combat the pandemic
vary, generating different uncertainty levels about the actual number of cases1, 3 . Accounting for the hierarchical structure of
the data and accommodating extra-variability is therefore fundamental. We introduce a new modelling framework to describe
the course of the pandemic with great accuracy, and provide short-term daily forecasts for every country in the world. We show
that our model generates highly accurate forecasts up to six days ahead, and use estimated model components to cluster
countries based on recent events. We introduce statistical novelty in terms of modelling the autoregressive parameter as a
function of time, increasing predictive power and flexibility to adapt to each country. Our model can also be used to forecast the
number of deaths, study the effects of covariates (such as lockdown policies), and generate forecasts for smaller regions within
countries. Consequently, it has strong implications for global planning and decision making. We constantly update forecasts
and make all results freely available to any country in the world through an online Shiny dashboard.

Introduction
Outbreaks of the COVID-19 pandemic have been causing worldwide socioeconomic and health concerns since December
2019, putting high pressure on healthcare services. SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, spreads efficiently and,
consequently, the effectiveness of control measures depends on the relationship between epidemiological variables, human
behaviour, and government intervention to control the spread of the disease3, 4 . Different attempts to model the virus outbreaks
in many countries have been made, involving mechanistic models5, 6 , and extensions based on susceptible-infected-recovered
(SIR) systems7–9 . Countries have also put together task forces to work with COVID-19 data and their indirect impact on the
population, economy, banking and insurance, and financial markets2, 10–12 . In addition, funding agencies have put together rapid
response calls worldwide for projects that can help dealing with this pandemic. However, further investment is still needed to
foment priority research involving SARS-CoV-2, so as to establish a high level coordination of essential, policy-relevant, social
and mental health science13, 14 .
This pandemic is associated with high basic reproduction numbers15, 16 , spreading with great speed since a significant
number of infected individuals remain asymptomatic, while still being able to transmit the virus17 . In the UK, for example, it is
estimated that approximately 4.4% of people who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 overall required hospitalisation, increasing
to 17 − 27% in the group of persons aged 65 years or older. A pressing concern here is how to avoid bringing healthcare
systems to a collapse17, 18 . Knowing how the outbreak is progressing is crucial to predict whether or when this will happen, and
therefore to plan and implement measures to reduce the number of cases so as to avoid it.
Policies for reducing the number of infected people such as social distancing and movement restrictions have been put
in place in many countries, but for many others a full lockdown may be very difficult (if not impossible) to implement. This
also depends heavily on the country’s political leadership, socioeconomic reality, and epidemic stage1, 19 . In this context,
accurate short-term forecasting would prove itself invaluable, especially for systems on the brink of collapse and countries
whose governments must consider trade-offs between lockdowns and avoiding full economical catastrophe.
The main problem is that not only is this disease new, but there are also many factors acting in concert resulting in a
seemingly unpredictable outbreak progression. Forecasting with great accuracy under these circumstances is very difficult.
Here we propose a new modelling framework, based on a state-space hierarchical model, that is able to generate forecasts with
very good accuracy for up to seven days ahead. To aid policy making and effective implementation of restrictions or reopening
measures, we provide all results as an R Shiny Dashboard, including week-long forecasts for every country in the world whose
data is collected and made available by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).

Results
Our model displayed an excellent predictive performance for short-term forecasting. We validated the model by fitting it to the
data up to 13-May-2020, after removing the last seven time points (from 14-May-2020 until 20-May-2020), and compared
the forecasted values with the observed ones (Figure 1A). We observe that it performs very well, especially for the first six
days ahead (Figure 1B). Even though performance falls substantially for the seventh day ahead, with a concordance correlation
between observed and forecasted values close to 0.5, there are still many countries for which the forecasted daily number of
new cases is very close to the observed one. We carried out this same type of validation study using data up to 6-May-2020 and
up to 29-Apr-2020, and the results were very similar, with a concordance correlation between observed and forecasted values
greater than 0.75 for up to five days ahead (see Supplementary Materials).

Days ahead

Figure 1. A Logarithm of the observed yit versus the forecasted daily number of cases y∗it for each country, for up to seven
days ahead, where each day ahead constitutes one panel. The forecasts were obtained from the autoregressive state-space
hierarchical negative binomial model, fitted using data up to 13-May-2020. The first day ahead corresponds to 14-May-2020,
and the seventh to 20-May-2020. Each dot represents a country, and the sixteen countries shown in Figure 2 are represented by
blue triangles. We add 1 to the values before taking the logarithm. B Observed accuracy, concordance correlation coefficient
(CCC) and Pearson correlation (r) between observed (yit ) and forecasted (y∗it ) values for each of the days ahead of
13-May-2020.
The autoregressive component in the model has a direct relationship with the pandemic behaviour over time for each country
(see Supplementary Materials). It is directly proportional to the natural logarithm of the daily number of cases, given what
happened in the previous day. Therefore, it is sensitive to changes and can be helpful detecting a possible second wave. See,
2/22

for example, its behaviour for Ireland, Spain, Italy and France – it shows that the outbreak is decaying, however it may still
take time to subside completely (Figure 2). On the other hand, in Iceland the outbreak has ended, according to the estimated
autoregressive component. In China and South Korea, however, even though it appears that the outbreak has come to an end,
our results show that a second outbreak could begin, and hence countries must be very cautious when relaxing restrictions. In
the UK and the United States, it seems as if the outbreak is taking a long time to subside, and in Brazil and Russia it has not
even reached its peak yet.

Figure 2. Posterior means of the autoregressive component γit (solid lines) and associated 95% credible intervals (shaded
areas) for each of sixteen selected countries from the pool of 210 countries and territories in the data, from 1-Jan-2020 until
20-May-2020.
The estimates for the model parameters suggest that about 10% of the number of reported cases can be viewed as contributing
to extra variability, and possibly may consist of outlying observations (see the model estimates in the Supplementary Materials).
These observations may be actual outliers, but it is likely that this is a feature of the data collection process. In many countries,
the data that is recorded for a particular day actually reflects tests that were done over the previous week or even earlier. This
generates aggregated-level data, which is prone to exhibiting overdispersion, which is accounted for in our model, but for some
observations this variability is even greater, since they reflect a large number of accumulated suspected cases that were then
confirmed. There is also a large variability between countries in terms of their underlying autoregressive processes (see the
estimates for the variance components in the Supplementary Materials). This corroborates the fact that countries are dealing
with the pandemic in different ways, and also may collect and/or report data differently.
We propose clustering the countries based on the behaviour of their estimated autoregressive parameter over the last 60 days
(Figure 3). This gives governments the opportunity to see which countries have had the most similar recent behaviour of the
outbreak, and study similar or different measures taken by these other countries that may help determine policy. We observe,
for example, that Brazil and Russia have been experiencing a very similar situation recently; the same can be said about France,
Germany, Italy and Spain. Our R Shiny dashboard displays up-to-date results in terms of forecasts and also country clustering,
and can be accessed at https://prof-thiagooliveira.shinyapps.io/COVIDForecast. Through the dashboard, users can choose to
highlight a different number of clusters, which may provide different insights.

Discussion
Our modelling framework allows for forecasting the daily number of new COVID-19 cases for each country and territory for
which data has been gathered by the ECDC. It introduces statistical novelty in terms of modelling the autoregressive parameter
as a function of time. This makes it highly flexible to adapt to changes in the autoregressive structure of the data over time. In
the COVID-19 pandemic, this translates directly into improved predictive power in terms of forecasting future numbers of
4/22

daily cases. Our objective here is to provide a simple, yet not overly simplistic, framework for country-level decision-making,
and we understand this might be easier for smaller countries when compared to nations of continental dimensions, where
state-level decision-making should be more effective20 . Moreover, the model can be adapted to other types of data, such as
number of deaths, and also be used to obtain forecasts for smaller regions within a country. A natural extension would be to
include an additional hierarchical structure taking into account the nested relationship between cities, states, countries and
ultimately continents, while also accommodating the spatial autocorrelation. This would allow for capturing the extra-variability
introduced by aggregating counts over different cities and districts.
We remark that one must be very careful when looking at the forecasted number of cases. These values must not be looked
at in isolation. It is imperative that the entire context is looked at and that we understand how the data is actually generated21 .
The model will obtain forecasts based on what is being reported, and therefore will be a direct reflection of the data collection
process, be it appropriate or not. When data collection is not trustworthy, model forecasts will not be either. Our estimated
number of outlying observations of approximately 10% is relatively high, and when looking at each country’s time series we
observe that countries that display unusual behaviour in terms of more outlying observations are usually related to a poorer
model predictive performance as well. This suggests that the data collection process is far from optimal. Looking at the full
context of the data is therefore key to implementing policy based on model forecasts.
As self-criticism, our model may possibly be simplistic in the sense that it relies on the previous observation to predict
the next one, but does not rely on mechanistic biological processes, such as SEIR-type models5, 22, 23 . These types of models
allow for a better understanding of the pandemic in terms of the disease dynamics, and are able to provide long-term estimates6 .
However, as highlighted above, our objective is short-term forecasting, which is a task that is already very difficult. Long-term
forecasting is even more difficult, and we believe it could even be speculative when dealing with its implications pragmatically.
A more tangible solution to this issue is to combine the short-term forecasting power of our proposed modelling framework
with the long-term projections provided by mechanistic models, so as to implement policy that can solve pressing problems
efficiently, while at the same time looking at how it may affect society in the long run. We acknowledge all models are wrong,
including the one presented here. We have showed, however, that it provides very good forecasts for up to a week ahead, and
this can help inform on country reopening policies.
Even though the model performs very well, we stress the importance of constantly validating the forecasts, since not only
can the underlying process change, but also data collection practices change (to either better or worse). Many countries are still
not carrying out enough tests, and hence the true number of infections is sub-notified24 . This hampers model performance
significantly, especially that of biologically realistic models5 .
There is a dire need for better quality data21 . This is a disease with a very long incubation period (up to 24 days25 ), with
median value varying from 4.5 to 5.8 days26 , which makes it even harder to pinpoint exactly when the infection was actually
transmitted from one person to the other. Furthermore, around 97.5% of those who develop symptoms will do so in between
8.2 to 15.6 days26 . The number of reported new cases for today reflects a mixture of infections that were transmitted at any
point in time over the last few weeks. The time testing takes also influences this. One possible alternative is to model excess
deaths when compared to averages over previous years27, 28 . This is an interesting approach, since it can highlight the effects of
the pandemic (see, e.g., the insighful visualisations at Our World in Data29 , and the Finantial Times30 ). Again, this is highly
dependent on the quality of the data collection process not only for COVID-19 related deaths, but also those arising from
different sources. Many different teams of data scientists and statisticians worldwide are developing different approaches to
work with COVID-19 data3, 9, 16, 31 . It is the duty of each country’s government to collect and provide accurate data. This way,
it can be used with the objective of improving healthcare systems and general social wellbeing.
The developed R Shiny Dashboard displays seven-day forecasts for all countries and territories whose data are collected by
the ECDC, and updated clustering of countries based on the last 60 days. This can help governments currently implementing
or lifting restrictions. It is possible to compare government policies between countries at similar stages of the pandemic to
determine the most effective courses of action. These can then be tailored by each particular government to their own country.
The efficiency of measures put in place in each country can also be studied using our modelling framework, since it easily
accommodates covariates in the linear predictor. Then, the contribution of these country-specific effects to the overall number
of cases can serve as an indicator of how they may be influencing the behaviour of the outbreaks over time.
Government policies are extremely dependent on the reality of each country. It has become clear that there are countries
that are well able to withstand a complete lockdown, whereas others cannot cope with the economic downfall19 . The issue
is not only economic, but also of newly emerging health crises that are not due to COVID-19 lethality alone, but to families
relying on day-to-day work to guarantee their food supplies. For these countries, there is a trade-off between avoiding a new
evil versus amplifying pre-existing problems or even creating new ones. In such circumstances, it is indeed very difficult to
create a one-size-fits-all plan, which makes it even more vital to strive for better data collection practices.
We hope to be able to contribute to the development of efficient short-term response to the pandemic, for countries whose
healthcare systems are at capacity, and countries implementing reopening plans. By providing a means of comparing recent
5/22

behaviour of the outbreak between countries, we also hope to provide a means to opening dialogue between countries going
through a similar stage, and those who have gone through similar stages before.

Methods
Data acquisition
The data was obtained from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), and the code is implemented such
that it downloads and processes the up-to-date data from https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/geographical-distribution-2019-ncovcases. We remove, however, the data from the current day, since it can be updated by the ECDC. We assumed non-available
data to be zero prior to the first case being recorded for each country. Whenever the daily recorded data was negative (reflecting
previously confirmed cases being discarded), we replaced that information with a zero. This is the case for only nine out of
29,610 observations as of the 20th of May 2020.
According to the ECDC, the data on number of cases is based on reports from health authorities worldwide (up to 500
sources), which are screened by epidemiologists for validation prior to being recorded in the ECDC dataset.
Modelling framework
We introduce a class of state-space hierarchical models for overdispersed count time series. Let Yit be the observed number of
newly infected people at country i and time t, with i = 1, . . . , N and t = 1, . . . , T . We model Yit as a Negative binomial first-order
Markov process, with
Yit |Yi,t−1 ∼ NB(µit , ψ)
for t = 2, . . . , T . The parameterisation used here results in E(Yit |Yi,t−1 ) = µit and Var(Yit |Yi,t−1 ) = µit + µit2 ψ. The mean is
modelled on the log scale as the sum of an autoregressive component (γit ) and a component that accommodates outliers (Ωit ),
i.e.
log µit = γit + Ωit .
To accommodate the temporal correlation in the series, the non-stationary autoregressive process {γit } is set up as

γit = φit γit−1 + ηit , with ηit ∼ N 0, ση2 ,

(1)

where ηit is a Gaussian white noise process with mean 0 and variance ση2 . Differently from standard AR(1)-type models,
here φit is allowed to vary over time through an orthogonal polynomial regression linear predictor using the time as covariate,
yielding
Q

φit =

∑ (βq + biq )Pq (t), with b i ∼ NQ (0, Σb )

(2)

q=0

where Pq (·) is the function that produces the orthogonal polynomial of order q, with P0 (x) = 1 for any real number x; βq are the
regression coefficients and b i is the vector of
 random effects,
 which are assumed to be normally distributed with mean vector 0
2
2
and variance-covariance matrix Σb = diag σb0 , . . . , σbQ .
By assuming φit varying by country over time, we allow for a more flexible autocorrelation function. Iterating (1) we obtain

for t = 3, . . . , T . Note that in the particular case where φit = φi = β0 + b0i , then γit = φit−1 γi1 + φit−2 ηi2 + φit−3 ηi3 + . . . +
φi ηit−1 + ηit , which is equivalent to a country-specific AR(1) process. On the other hand, if φit = φi = β0 , then γit =
φ t−1 γi1 + φ t−2 ηi2 + φ t−3 ηi3 + . . . + φ ηit−1 + ηit , which is equivalent to assuming the same autocorrelation parameter for all
countries.
Finally, to accommodate extra-variability we introduce the observational-level random effect
Ωit = λit ωit ,
where λit ∼ Bernoulli(π) and ωit ∼ N(0, σω2 ). When λit = 1, then observation yit is considered to be an outlier, and the extra
variability is modelled by σω2 . This can be seen as a mixture component that models the variance associated with outlying
observations.
6/22

To forecast future observations y∗i,t+1 , we use the median of the posterior distribution of Yi,t+1 |Yit . This is reasonable for
short-term forecasting, since the error accumulates from one time step to the other. We produce forecasts for up to seven days
ahead.
We fitted models considering different values for Q. Even though the results for Q = 3 showed that all βq parameters were
different from zero when looking at the 95% credible intervals, we opted for Q = 2 for the final model fit, since it improves
convergence of the model, as well as avoids overfitting by assuming a large polynomial degree, while still providing the extra
flexibility introduced by the autoregressive function (2). This can change, however, as more data becomes available for a large
number of time steps.
Model validation
We fitted the model without using the observations from the last seven days and obtained the forecasts y∗it for each country
and day. We then compared the forecasts with the true observations yit for each day ahead, by looking initially at the Pearson
correlation between them. We also computed the concordance correlation coefficient32, 33 , an agreement index that lies between
−1 and 1, given by

how far the best-fit line deviates from the identity line through the origin, defined as Cb = 2 v + v−1 + u2
, where v = σ12 /σ22
√
is a scale shift and u = (µ1 − µ2 )/ σ1 σ2 is a location shift relative to the scale. When Cb = 1 then there is no deviation from
the identity line.
Model implementation
The model is estimated using a Bayesian framework, and the prior distributions used are
βi
−2
σbq

∼ NQ (0, IQ × 1000)
∼ Gamma(0.001, 0.001)

ση−2 ∼ Gamma(0.001, 0.001)
σω−2 ∼ Gamma(0.001, 0.001)
π ∼ Uniform(0, 1)
We used 3 MCMC chains, 2,000 adaptation iterations, 50,000 as burn-in, and 50,000 iterations per chain with a thinning of
25. We assessed convergence by looking at the trace plots, autocorrelation function plots and the Gelman-Rubin convergence
diagnostic34 .
All analyses were carried out using R software35 and JAGS36 . Model fitting takes approximately seven hours to run in
parallel computing, in a Dell Inspiron 17 7000 with 10th Generation Intel Core i7 processor, 1.80GHz×8 processor speed,
16GB RAM plus 20GB of swap space, 64-bit integers, and the platform used is a Linux Mint 19.2 Cinnamon system version
5.2.2-050202-generic.
Clustering
We used the last 60 values of the estimated autoregressive component to perform clustering so as to obtain sets of countries
that presented a similar recent behaviour. First, we computed the dissimilarities between the estimated time series γ̂γ i between
each pair of countries using the dynamic time warp (DTW) distance37, 38 . Let M be the set of all possible sequences of m pairs
preserving the order of observations in the form r = ((γ̂i1 , γ̂i0 1 ), . . . , (γ̂im , γ̂i0 m )). Dynamic time warping aims to minimise the
distance between the coupled observations (γ̂it , γ̂i0 t ). The DTW distance may be written as
!
m

d(γ̂γ i , γ̂γ i0 ) = min
r∈M

∑ |γ̂it − γ̂i0t |

.

t=1

By using the DTW distance, we are able to recognise similar shapes in time series, even in the presence of shifting and/or
scaling38 .
7/22

Then, we performed hierarchical clustering using the matrix of DTW distances using Ward’s method, aimed at minimising
the variability within clusters39 , and obtained ten clusters. Finally, we produced a dendrogram of the results of the hierarchical
clustering analysis, with each cluster coloured differently so as to aid visualisation.
Code availability
All code and datasets are made available as Supplementary Materials, and updated versions can also be downloaded from
https://github.com/Prof-ThiagoOliveira/covid_forecast.
We produced a Shiny app displaying the latest forecasts for the next seven days that is updated twice a week, and can be
