Abstract
Spreading of respiratory diseases, such as COVID-19, from contaminated surfaces is dependent on the drying time of the deposited droplets containing the
virus. The evaporation rate depends on environmental conditions, such as ambient temperature and relative humidity and physical properties (e.g., droplet
volume, contact angle and composition). The respiratory droplets contain salt
(NaCl), protein (mucin), and surfactant (dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine) in addition to water, which are expected to influence the evaporation in a big way.
A diffusion-based theoretical model for estimating the drying time is developed
which takes into account the dynamic contact angle of saliva droplets laden with
salt and insoluble surfactants. The effect of the initial volume, contact angle,
salinity, surfactant concentration, ambient temperature and relative humidity
on the drying time of droplets is investigated.
Keywords: Wetting dynamics, evaporation, sessile droplet, saliva droplets

1. Introduction
SARS-CoV-2 (also known as coronavirus) has spread to more than 200 countries and infected more than 11 million people worldwide until the first week of
July 2020. Respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV-2 virus spreads primarily
by respiratory droplets (size > 10µm) of saliva or discharge from the nose of an
infected person during coughing/sneezing [1, 2]. The study of fluid dynamics of
respiratory droplets migrating in the air or deposited on surfaces helps to understand the life of these droplets [3, 4]. Few researchers (see, for instance, Ref.
[5]) studied the distance travelled by droplets and their lifetime (drying time)
in the air under various respiratory conditions. Chen [6] studied the effect of
ambient temperature and humidity on the life time of sneeze droplets using onedimensional droplet evaporation model. The World Health Origination (WHO)
has suggested several guidelines, such as wearing face masks and maintaining
social distance as the preventive measures for air transmission of COVID-19.
The respiratory droplets substantially increase their lifetime as they come
into contact with a surface depending on the surface properties and local amPreprint submitted to International Communications in Heat and Mass TransferAugust 11, 2020

bient conditions. Bhardwaj and Agrawal [4] recently used a diffusion-based
model to study pinned droplet evaporation with a constant contact angle assuming that SARS-CoV-2 droplet is pure water. They also remarked that the
quasi-steady assumption used in their study is valid when the heat equilibrium time is much smaller than the drying time of the droplet [7]. Respiratory
droplets, however, also contain salt (NaCl), protein (mucin), and surfactant
(dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine), which are supposed to influence the drying
time. In particular, the concentration of NaCl, mucin and surfactant per litre
of saliva solution are 9 g/l, 3 g/l and 0.5 g/l, respectively [8]. Thus, in this
study, we have extended the study of Bhardwaj and Agrawal [4] to investigate
the lifetime of sessile droplets laden with salinity and other insoluble ingredients
(surfactant) on various surfaces under different atmospheric conditions, such as
relative humidity (RH) and temperature (T ), which has been poorly understood
until now.
In the context of normal droplets, the evaporation has been investigated
theoretically and experimentally by many researchers (see e.g. Refs. [4, 9–11]).
Gurrala et al. [9] investigated the evaporation of sessile droplets at different
temperatures. They compared the results obtained from the theoretical model
that includes the diffusion, free convection and passive transport of air with their
experiments for different compositions and surface temperatures. Fukatani et
al. [10] experimentally studied the effect of the relative humidity and ambient
temperature on the early stages of the evaporation of organic solvents. Karapetsas et al. [12] investigated the evaporation of sessile droplets laden with
particles and insoluble surfactants using lubrication theory. They found that
the lifetime of the droplet is significantly influenced by the presence of the surfactant via the spreading of the droplet and Marangoni convection. Soulié et al.
[13] compared the initial evaporation rate (linear stage) of droplets of aqueous
saline (NaCl) solutions with that obtained from their experiments, and found
that the evaporation rates for high salt concentrations and small contact angles
were significantly lower than those predicted from the well-accepted diffusioncontrolled evaporation scenario for sessile droplets. They also observed that the
droplet remains pinned when the concentration of the salt is ≥ 10−6 mole.
2. Mathematical modelling
For small droplets (volume, V ≤ O(1) µL) , the surface tension force predominates over the gravitational force and a sessile droplet obtains a symmetrical
spherical cap shape [14]. For such a droplet, if A(t) = θ(t) · π/180 is the contact
angle in radians and R is the wetting radius of the droplet, then the time-varying
droplet volume can be expressed as
V (t) =

πR3 (1 − cos A(t))2 (2 + cos A(t))
.

We make the following assumptions for the deduction of the rate of evaporation of droplets laden with salinity and insoluble surfactants. (i) The surface
2

is at the same temperature as the surrounding air, (ii) the temperature remains
constant during the evaporation process, (iii) the droplet remains internally wellmixed during the evaporation process and (iv) the Stefan flow and the effect of
solutal Marangoni convection inside the droplet are neglected. These assumptions are valid for the evaporation of small droplets. Under these conditions, one
can ignore the convective mass transfer and assume that the droplet evaporates
at the vapour-liquid interface only through the processes driven by diffusion.
Therefore, the well studied expression [15] of the evaporation rate, ṁ (kg/s) of
spherical cap-shaped droplets through the diffusion process are adopted in this
work, which is given by
ṁ = −πRD(T )Csat (T ) [1 − RH] f (A)α,

(2)

where RH is the relative humidity of air (%) and f (A) = 1.3 + 0.27A2 for
θ ≤ 90◦ [15]. The diffusion coefficient, D(T ) of water vapour (m2 /s) at the
given temperature, T (◦ C) is given by [4]

Here, Γ is the concentration of the surfactant and Γ∞ is the maximum possible
surfactant concentration which is assumed to be the concentration corresponding to a fully dried drop. Also, n̂sur is the number of moles of surfactant, n̂s
denotes the number of moles of solute ion particles and n̂w (t) is the number of
moles of water in the droplet at the given time. The number of moles of surfactant is calculated using initial value of Γ = 1.22 × 10−5 [8]. The mole fraction
3

of the water in the solution decreases as the evaporation process progresses over
time. This decrease in the mole fraction of water in the evaporating droplet
increases the surfactant and salt concentrations which, along with a decrease in
the contact angle, slows down the rate of evaporation as time progresses. At
any given time, the mole fraction of liquid water that remains in the solution
can be calculated as
n̂w (t)
.
(8)
Xw (t) =
n̂w (t) + n̂s + n̂sur
Note that for electrolyte solutes that dissociate into ions, the sum of the
number of moles of the positive and negative ions formed by the solute is equal
to n̂solute . The molality (M ) is defined the ratio between the number of moles
of solute (n̂solute ) and mass of water (mw in kg) in the droplet solution. For a
salt, like NaCl, n̂s = 2n̂solute . Since salt and surfactants are non-volatile, the
mass evaporation rate is entirely due to the loss of water. We neglect any loss
of these ingredients due to crystallisation from the solvent as the initial droplet
is very dilute and no deposition is expected till the very end of the droplet’s
lifetime. Thus the rate of change of the number of moles of water from the
droplet solution can be expressed as

where ρ(t) is the density of the solution at a given time. The fluid density

3. Results and discussion
The conditions used in the present study are summarised below. The initial
contact angle (θ0 ) of the droplet is varied from 10◦ − 90◦ to represent different
surfaces used in our everyday activities. Note that the contact angle of a droplet
on glass, stainless steel, cotton, wood, smartphone screen and coated paper
are about 10◦ [17], 30◦ [18], 50◦ [19], 65◦ [20], 85◦ [21], and 90 − 110◦ [22],
respectively. The relative humidity (RH) and temperature (T ) are varied from
10% - 90% and 20◦ C - 50◦ C, respectively. Such ambient conditions are observed
in various places worldwide. The initial volume of the droplet (V0 ) is varied from
1 nL - 10 nL. In addition, the molality (M ) of the saliva is fixed at 0.154 mol/kg
[8]. For a typical value of Γ/Γ∞ , the value of Ψ varies from 0 - 50 for different
realistic values of α [23].
In the present study, given the initial mole numbers of water, surfactant
and solute ions in the droplet, an iterative numerical code is developed which

calculates the mass loss rate while dynamically correcting the changes induced
by the decrease in the contact angle and the increase in the salt and surfactant
concentrations in the liquid during the evaporation process.
We begin the presentation of our results by examining the effect of the surfactants on evaporation by exploring the influence of the surfactant parameter
Ψ. Figs. 1(a) and (b) show the temporal evolutions of the normalised contact
angle (θ/θ0 ) and the normalised instantaneous mass evaporation rate (ṁ/ṁ0 )
of the droplet for different values of Ψ, respectively. The rest of the parameters
are V0 = 10 nL, M = 0.154 mol/kg, T = 30◦ C, RH = 50% and θ0 = 50◦ . Soulié
et al. [13] found that a saline droplet remains pinned when the concentration of
the salt is ≥ 10−6 mole. Thus, we simulate the evaporation of a pinned droplet
whose contact angle decreases during the evaporation. The black dashed line
in Figs. 1(a) and (b) shows the constant contact angle case, which does not
represent the exact nature of a pinned droplet. The profiles of the normalized
contact angle and the normalized mass loss rate show three distinct regions: an
initial period of gradual decrease followed by a steep decline at the intermediate
period and an eventual near-horizontal line at very small values till the end of
the droplet lifetime. It can be seen in Fig. 1(a) that the rate of decrease of
the contact angle is slower as we increase the value of Ψ. For Ψ = 0, which
corresponds to the case when there is no surfactant effect on the evaporation
rate, the contact angle of the droplet approaches zero more quickly than for
Ψ > 0, i.e. the droplet becomes a thin film. Inspection of Fig. 1(b) reveals that
increasing Ψ decreases the rate of evaporation of the droplet at an early stage,
while it increases significantly at the intermediate stage as the rate of decline
becomes less steep with increasing Ψ. The crossover takes place at t ≈ 24 for
the set of parameters considered in the present study (see, inset in Fig. 1b).
There is an overall increase in the lifetime of the droplet with an increasing value
of Ψ. This is due to the competition between the decrease in dynamic contact

angle and increase in Ψ. Unlike, what is expected in the constant contact angle
case [4], the normalised rate of mass evaporation decreases with time due to the
shrinking free surface (liquid-air interface; f (A) in Eq. 2) area of the droplet at
the early stage. The effect of surfactant parameter is more pronounced at the
late stage of evaporation, as the mole fractions of the salt and surfactant significantly increase in the droplet (Fig. 1(b)). Both the Figs. 1 (a) and (b) show
a highly nonlinear evolution of the contact angle and the instantaneous massloss rates that are significantly affected by the surfactant spreading coefficient
values.
Another important factor influencing the drying time of the droplets is the
relative humidity. In Fig. 2(a), it can be seen that increasing RH (%) decreases
the rate of decline of the normalised contact angle (θ/θ0 ). This is because
increasing RH decreases the evaporation rate of the pinned droplet as shown in
Fig. 2(b). It is found (not shown) that the mole fraction of the water remains
close to one for a longer time as the value of RH is increased and subsequently,
decreases rapidly. These distinct stages are apparent in Fig. 2(b), which shows
that in the early stage, the normalised instantaneous mass evaporation rate,
ṁ/ṁ0 is almost constant, and is followed by a rapid decrease in ṁ/ṁ0 in the
late stage. It can also be seen in Fig. 2(b) that the lifetime of the droplet
increases significantly for RH ≥ 90%. This range of humidity corresponds to
the monsoon scenario in the Indian subcontinent where the RH peaks at around
90% - 100%. We found that the droplet lifetimes are approximately equal to
32.5 seconds for RH = 50%, 180 seconds for RH = 90%, 350 seconds for RH
= 95% and 860 seconds for RH = 95%. These values demonstrate the high
sensitivity of the droplet lifetime on the relative humidity of the ambient.
To further elucidate the effect of the relative humidity, temperature, initial
contact angle and Ψ on the lifetime of droplets, we present the regime maps in
Figs. 3(a) and (b), showing the drying time of the droplet in T − RH space in
the two limits of initial contact angle considered in the present study, namely,

θ0 = 10◦ and θ0 = 90◦ , respectively for V0 = 10 nL, M = 0.154 mol/kg
and Ψ = 20. The isocontour lines in these maps show the drying time in
second. A logarithmic scale is used for the colourmap to represent the drying
time of the droplet as it varies by 4 orders of magnitude. The longest drying
times are observed with the combination of low T and high RH (upper left
corner), while the drying time progressively reduces as the humidity falls and
the temperature rises for both sets of parameters considered. We also found
that for a fixed initial volume of the droplet, increasing the initial contact angle
increases the drying time. This follows physical intuition, as a droplet with
a smaller contact angle has a greater wetting radius and surface area for the
same volume resulting in a larger interface area over which the diffusion-driven
evaporation can occur. Thus, highly hydrophilic surfaces may be less susceptible
to prolonged contamination in comparison to less hydrophilic surfaces, which
is a somewhat counter-intuitive result. Increasing the surfactant parameter, Ψ
also found to increase the drying time of the droplet.
Finally, in Figs. 4(a-d), we present the variations of the lifetime of the saliva
droplets laden with salt and insoluble surfactants with Ψ for different values
of θ0 , T , RH and V0 , respectively. It can be seen that increasing Ψ, θ0 and
RH and V0 and decreasing T increases the lifetime of the droplet for a fixed
set of other parameters. It can be seen that the drying time increases with
increasing Ψ for all cases. Further, the rate of increase of the drying time with
Ψ becomes larger as the value of the initial contact angle, relative humidity and

initial droplet volume increases and the value of the ambient temperature falls.
Thus the surfactant induced decrease in the rate of evaporation has a more
pronounced effect in enhancing the lifetime of the droplet especially when the
basal evaporation rate is slow due to the other conditions, such as high RH, low
T , higher θo and higher V0 .
4. Concluding remarks
To summarise, in our study, a diffusion-based theoretical model is developed
which takes into account the dynamic contact angle, the salt concentration and
the surfactant effect during the evaporation of sessile saliva droplets and the associated physics. The current work is an extension of Bhardwaj and Agrawal’s
study [4] to consider saliva properties (such as salinity and other insoluble surfactants) and the dynamic contact angle associated with the evaporating droplet.
The effect of the surfactant was modelled by incorporating the accommodation coefficient, α into the diffusion-driven mass evaporation rate. The droplet
is assumed to be pinned throughout its lifetime, as is expected for droplets
that are saline in nature. We showed that the drying time calculated assuming
saliva fluid as water and using a static contact angle significantly under-predicts

8

the real drying time of the saliva droplets. It is observed that drying time is
strongly dependent on humidity when RH > 90%. The regime maps in T −RH
space show that the longest drying time is associated with the combination of
low temperature and high RH values. We also found that increasing the initial
contact angle and the surfactant parameter, Ψ increases the drying time. The
quantitative data of the lifetime of saliva droplets presented in the present study
shows the importance of properly sanitising the contact prone surfaces, more so
in the monsoon season and air-conditioned indoor areas.
