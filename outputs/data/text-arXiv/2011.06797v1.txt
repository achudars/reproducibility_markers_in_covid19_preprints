Abstract:
In a fast evolving major public health crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple pieces
of relevant information can be posted sequentially in a social media platform. The interval between
subsequent posting times may have different impact on the transmission and cross-propagation of
the old and new information to result in different peak value and final size of forwarding users of
the new information, depending on the content correlation and whether the new information is
posted during the outbreak or quasi steady state phase of the old information. To help in designing
effective communication strategies to ensure information is delivered to the maximal number of
users, we develop and analyze two classes of susceptible-forwarding-immune information
propagation models with delay in transmission, to describe the cross-propagation process of relevant
information. We parametrize these models using real data from the Sina-Microblog and use the
parametrized models to define and evaluate mutual attractiveness indices, and we use these indices
and parameter sensitivity analyses to inform strategies to ensure optimal strategies for a new
information to be effectively propagated in the microblog.

1. Introduction
In the absence of effective treatment and vaccine, the success or failure of mitigating COVID19 transmission in the population relies heavily on the effectiveness of social distancing, selfprotection, case detection, quarantine, isolation and testing. The effectiveness of these nonpharmaceutical interventions depends on the active participation and engagement of residents in the
community, which is significantly influenced by the public opinions. Given the very short disease
transmission doubling time, the timing (and hence time lags) in the communication of critical public
health information to the community has a profound impact on the outcome of public adherence to
non-pharmaceutical measures, and ultimately on the outcome of outbreak mitigation. Adding to the
challenging of effective communications is the cross-propagation of relevant, and sometimes
inconsistent, pieces of information that enter social media at different time points. This calls for a
strategy of optimizing the timing of posting key information in social media during a fast evolving
pandemic.

pandemic, posted in sequence on Sina-microblog.
Figure 1 shows the cross-propagation of three pieces of related information about COVID-19:
titled by “Just want a regular 20200202”, “Announcement of donation acceptance by Wuhan
JinYinTan hospital” and “Three cases of community transmission were reported in Shenzhen for the
first time”. These pieces of information were posted in Sina-microblog, with different beginning
and ending time points marked in the (horizontal) timeline. Almost immediately after reading
Information A, some users forwarded the Information B, so both pieces of information shared
similar life cycles with respective beginning and ending time points close to each other. There were
12283 Information A users, among which 742 (6.04%.) forwarded Information B. Eventually, 7161
of users forwarded Information B, and those who simultaneously forwarded Information A
accounted for 10.36%. Information C was then released and users of Information B started to
forward Information C. At the end, among 7161 users of Information B, 1158 (16.17%) also
forwarded Information C, accounting for 10.26% of the users for C.
In general, relevant information, when posted with an appropriate time lag, can attract the
interest of social media users in public hot events by increasing the efficiency of dissemination of a
group of information cross-propagated. It is an important topic of research, the main objective of
our study, to understand the information cross-propagation dynamics in order to inform optimal
strategies of posting a relevant information in an appropriate time sequence to ensure their
maximum interaction for effective co-promotion during a public health emergency situation.
To our best knowledge, no appropriate model framework has been developed and analyzed to
examine the impact of information cross-propagation dynamics for a group of relevant information
posted subsequently. Here, we try to fill this gap by proposing a susceptible-forwarding-immune
model with time-delayed posting and transmission. We develop this framework, illustrate this
framework and parametrize our model by using the forwarding quantity that represents public
attention to some popular opinions on the COVID-19 pandemic. Our focus is on the dynamic
interactions among several pieces of information posted sequentially, and we aim to examine the
impact of time lags between different posting time points on the evolution and steady states of crosspropagation.

In the field of information propagation dynamics, there is a strong similarity between the
propagation of rumors and pathogens spread in the population [1]. Much has been done that uses
epidemic models to examine rumor propagation in the hope that the negative influence of rumors
can be eliminated or at least minimized. For example, susceptible-infected-exposed-recovered
model [2-3], susceptible-infected model [4-5], susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) [6] model and
susceptible-infected-recovered model [7-8], have all been developed and recognized as among
classical propagation dynamics models.
The development of the Internet and the enrichment of social media mandate further extensions
of traditional models to reflect novel transmission mechanisms and to take advantage of data from
multiplatform. Gu and Cai [9] and Gu et al. [10] proposed the forget-remember mechanism to study
the spreading process in a 2-state model. Zhao et al. [11] combined the forgetting mechanism and
the SIR model to represent the rumor spreading process in an online social blogging platform
LiveJournal. In 2014, Zhao et al. [12] integrated the refutation mechanism in homogeneous social
networks into the SIR model and analyzed the dynamic process of rumor propagation. Considering
the three influencing factors of enterprises affected by rumors, pinion leaders and microblog
platform, an SIR model based on browsing behavior was constructed to explain how rumors spread
among followers under the influence of different rumor refuting measures [13]. Other features of
the new media were further incorporated in Zhao et al [14]. Borge-Holthoefer et al. [15] considered
the case when spreaders were not always active and an ignorant was not interested in spreading the
rumor, and then separately introduced these ideas into two different models. They concluded that
these models provided higher adhesion to real data than classical rumor spreading models. In 2020,
Yin et al [16] considered the user’s behavior of re-entering new topics and proposed a multipleinformation susceptible-discussing-immune (M-SDI) model to investigate COVID-19 relevant
information propagation in the Chinese Sina-microblog. Ding et al. [17] proposed an improved SIR
model, which used differential equations to study the rule of information transmission on media
platform and predict microblog information accurately. Wang et al. [18] proposed a modeling
method that considers Weibo propagation behavior based on SIS model, the forwarding trend in the
future can be predicted. Zhang et al. [19] focused on the impact of media transmission and
interpersonal relationships on information propagation and then proposed the media and
interpersonal relationship-SEIR (MI-SEIR) model. Zhao et al. [20] developed a new rumor
spreading model called susceptible-infected-hibernator-removed (SIHR) model, introducing a new
kind of people-hibernators in order to reduce the maximum rumor influence. Woo et al. [21]
proposed an event-driven SIR model based on the impact of news release on social media to reflect
the impact of specific events on opinion diffusion. Yao et al. [22] concentrated on examining the
influence of different interactions among information on the spread of public opinion and modeling
based on SIR model, which verified the otherness of public opinion under a distinct information
environment. Other studies relevant to our work include [23-26]. In particular, Tanaka M et al. [26]
added a new module to the traditional model by using two datasets from the Japanese Mixi and
Facebook rather than a single dataset.
Many researches on cross-transmission in disease diffusion are highly significant to study the
cross-propagation of information. Feng et al. [27] established a mathematical model that
3

incorporated the virus mutation dynamics in the transmission of CHIKV among mosquitoes and
humans. However, the important phenomenon of time lag in posting and cross-propagation of
relevant information for information dissemination in real social media networks has not been
adequately addressed in these earlier studies. We noted that Zan et al. [28] studied the double rumors
spreading with different launch times, in which the new rumor was launched with a certain delay
but also could interact with the old rumor. Zan et al proposed two classes of double-rumors
spreading models: a double-susceptible-infected-recovered (DSIR) model, where it was assumed
that the rumor was disseminated by direct contacts of infective nodes with others; and a
comprehensive-DSIR (C-DSIR) model, with which the authors studied the whole spread situation
of all rumors with a focus on determining how many people did not spread all rumors in the entire
period or how many were spreading or had spread at least one of rumors.
In comparison with the aforementioned studies, here we consider the phenomenon where at
different propagation stages of a piece of information posted in the social media, other pieces of
information are posted and their relevance in contexts and posting time sequence combined generate
outbreak for each piece of information, and more importantly cross-propagation in which users of
one piece of information forward other pieces of information they are exposed later. We develop
two classes of dynamic propagation models that focus respectively on the single information
transmission and multi-information cross-propagation patterns during explosive and quasi steady
state periods of the information posted sequentially. We aim to examine emphatically the influence
of different participating groups of a posted information on the spread of the information from the
participating groups. As populations who have forwarded, exposed/or not exposed to relevant
posted information are attracted to a new piece of information differently, by introducing and
analyzing the impact of attractiveness indexes on relevant information propagation, and examining
the significant factors of delaying in posting relevant information propagation, we inform strategies
for sequentially posting relevant information to achieve effective communication of key public
opinions. We will illustrate this with data from public opinions about COVID-19 pandemic
management.

3. Case study on COVID-19 opinion leader information sequential release in Sina-microblog
Since the COVID-19 outbreak in China, intensive information which were clearly relevant to
each other has been frequently posted. Figure 2 shows the total forwarding quantities of their Weibos
during each one-hour time frame on January 25, 2020, and January 26, 2020 (Data-acquisition up
to February 19, 2020), for top ten opinion leaders of this outbreak event in the Chinese Sinamicroblog. As illustrated, those pieces of information with high influence were posted extremely
frequently by each opinion leader. At the same time, there was a strong correlation among a series
of Weibos posted by these opinion leaders during certain periods. Of all the data showed in Figure
2, People's Daily issued five Weibos in one hour from 22:00 to 23:00 on January 25, and they were
forwarded by a total of more than 300,000 users. Therefore, the frequent release of relevant
information by original post owners was a common phenomenon in the COVID-19 information
propagation, and understanding its effectiveness is important.

Figure 3. Cumulative forwarding quantity of three pieces of information.
Figure 3 shows the trend of cumulative forwarding users for the three pieces of information in
Table 1-3. It shows that when Information A broke out, Information B was posted almost
immediately. Compared with the Information, the outbreak period of information B was shorter and
the trend was flatter. Information C was released during the quasi steady-state period of information
B. In comparison with Information, the outbreak period of Information C lasted longer, meanwhile,
the cumulative forwarding quantity was also larger.
Sequentially releasing two related pieces of information by the same original post owners
within the same COVID-19 theme was a common phenomenon. Also importantly, different entering
times of new information during the spreading process of an old (previously posted) information
exhibited different promoting effects on the cross-propagation and cross-promotion of relevant
public opinions. Here we focus on users who have exposed one posted information may have a
special interest in, and hence susceptible to, new and relevant information. This represents a
remarkable difference from the spread of rumors and other traditional public hot events. Our
information cross-propagation delay in transmission model (DT-SFI). including short interval delay
in transmission susceptible-forwarding-immune (STI DT-SFI) dynamics model and large interval
delay in transmission susceptible-forwarding-immune (LTI DT-SFI) dynamics model, is developed
to take into consideration the situations when the relevant information is posted during the outbreak
period, or during the quasi steady-state period of the previously posted (old) information.
4. Large delay in transmission susceptible-forwarding-immune dynamics model
4.1 Model description
The structure of our proposed large interval delay in transmission susceptible-forwardingimmune (LTI DT-SFI) dynamics model is shown in Figure 4. There are two phases involved: In
phase 1, a piece of stand-alone information (Information 1) is spreading; and in phase 2, another
piece of information (Information 2) is posted during the quasi steady-state period of the posted
information.

Figure 4. A schematic illustration of the information cross-spreading, where a new piece of
information is posted during the quasi steady-state period of an already posted information.
Phase 1. Post a stand-alone information: The propagation dynamics during phase 1 for one posted
information is modeled based on the traditional SFI [29] model, with a novel stratification of the
immune population. Namely, there will be two classes of immune populations (as far as Information
1 is concerned): those who have forwarded the posted information but are no longer in their active
period forwarding this posted information (𝐼1+ ), and those who have exposed to the information but
are not interested in forwarding this (𝐼1− ). This distinction of immunity is important as individuals
in these two distinct compartments will have different levels of interest in other relevant information
that will be posted later. This will allow us to introduce different measures of attractiveness to new
relevant information.
So, in our model, we stratify the population (𝑁1 ) into four states: the susceptible state of the
posted information (𝑆1 ), the forwarding state of the posted information (𝐹1 ), the inactive immune
state (𝐼1+), the direct immune state (𝐼1−). A susceptible user can be exposed to the posted information
with an average exposure rate 𝛽1 and will forward the information with the forwarding probability
𝑝1 . The forwarding users can become inactive immune users with an average rate 𝛼1. So, a user
may have a unique state, with 𝑆1 (𝑡), 𝐹1 (𝑡), 𝐼1+ (𝑡) and 𝐼1− (𝑡) denoting the number of users in
the susceptible, forwarding, inactive and direct immune state, respectively. We obtain the following
DT-SFI dynamics model in phase 1:
𝑑𝑆1 (𝑡)/𝑑𝑡 = −𝛽1 𝑆1 𝐹1
𝑑𝐹 (𝑡)/𝑑𝑡 = 𝑝1 𝛽1 𝑆1 𝐹1 − 𝛼1 𝐹1
{ 1
𝑑𝐼1+ (𝑡)/𝑑𝑡 = 𝛼1 𝐹1
𝑑𝐼1− (𝑡)/𝑑𝑡 = (1 − 𝑝1 )𝛽1 𝑆1 𝐹1

(1)

The state transition of different populations in phase 1 can be interpreted as follows: An active
forwarding user will contact an average number of 𝛽1 𝑁1 users per unit time and the probability of
a user is a susceptible user of the posted information is 𝑆1 (𝑡)/𝑁1, so an active forwarding user will
contact 𝛽1 𝑆1 (𝑡) susceptible users, among which 𝑝1 𝛽1 𝑆1 (𝑡) 𝐹1 (𝑡) susceptible users will choose to
forward the information and (1 − 𝑝1 )𝛽1 𝑆1 (𝑡) 𝐹1 (𝑡) will not. As time goes by, 𝛼1 𝐹1 (𝑡) will go to
the immune state from the forwarding period when they do not influence other users as far as
7

Information 1 is concerned.
For the data fitting purpose, we note that the Sina-microblog provides an important data about
any piece of information relevant to COVID-19, the number of cumulative forwarding quantity,
given by
𝑡

𝐶1 (𝑡) = ∫0 𝑝1 𝛽1 𝑆1 𝐹1 𝑑𝑡.

(2)

Phase 2. Post a new information during the quasi steady-state period of the posted information:
Now we consider that a piece of new information is posted at time 𝑡𝜏 when the posted information
is already in the quasi steady-state. We introduce


an extensive exposure attractiveness index, for the individuals in the immune state who
have forwarded the posted information but are no longer in their active forwarding period.
These individuals are more susceptible to the new yet relevant information as they had
interest in the posted information;



a mild exposure attractiveness index, for the direct immune individuals. These individuals
have had exposure to the posted information but had shown little interest to information;



an un-exposure attractiveness index, for those who have never exposed to the first posted
information.

Accordingly, we introduce three states of the population (𝑁2 ) for the newly posted information: the
susceptible state (𝑆2 ), the forwarding state (𝐹2 ), and the immune state (𝐼2 ). We summarize the
notations in Table 4.

Each user may have a unique state, with 𝐼1+ (𝑡), 𝐼1− (𝑡), 𝑆2 (𝑡), 𝐹2 (𝑡) and 𝐼2 (𝑡) denoting
the number of users in the susceptible, forwarding and immune state, respectively. We obtain the
following LTI DT-SFI dynamics model in phase 2:
𝑑𝑆2 (𝑡)/𝑑𝑡 = −𝛽23 𝑆2 𝐹2
𝑑𝐼1+ (𝑡)/𝑑𝑡 = −𝛽21 𝐼1+ 𝐹2
𝑑𝐼1− (𝑡)/𝑑𝑡 = −𝛽22 𝐼1− 𝐹2
𝑑𝐹2 (𝑡)/𝑑𝑡 = 𝑚21 𝑝2 𝛽21 𝐼1+ 𝐹2 + 𝑚22 𝑝2 𝛽22 𝐼1− 𝐹2 + 𝑚23 𝑝2 𝛽23 𝑆2 𝐹2 − 𝛼2 𝐹2
{𝑑𝐼2 (𝑡)/𝑑𝑡 = (1 − 𝑚21 𝑝2 )𝛽21 𝐼1+ 𝐹2 + (1 − 𝑚22 𝑝2 )𝛽22 𝐼1= 𝐹2 + (1 − 𝑚23 𝑝2 )𝛽23 𝑆2 𝐹2 + 𝛼2 𝐹2
(3)
The mass action in phase 2 can be interpreted as follows: An active forwarding user will contact
an average number of 𝛽21 𝑁2 inactive immune users of posted information per unit time and the
probability of a user is an inactive immune user is 𝐼1+ (𝑡)/𝑁2, so an active forwarding user will
contact 𝛽21 𝐼1+ (𝑡) inactive immune users, among which 𝑚21 𝑝2 𝛽21 𝐼1+ (𝑡)𝐹2 (𝑡) will choose to
forward the new information and (1 − 𝑚21 𝑝2 )𝛽21 𝐼1+ (𝑡)𝐹2 (𝑡) will not; an active forwarding user
will contact an average number of 𝛽22 𝑁2 direct immune users of posted information per unit time
and the probability of a user is a direct immune user is 𝐼1− (𝑡)/𝑁2, so an active forwarding user will
contact 𝛽22 𝐼1− (𝑡) direct immune users, among which 𝑚22 𝑝2 𝛽22 𝐼1− (𝑡)𝐹2 (𝑡) will choose to
forward the new information and (1 − 𝑚22 𝑝2 )𝛽22 𝐼1− (𝑡)𝐹2 (𝑡) will not; an active forwarding user
will contact an average number of 𝛽23 𝑁2 susceptible users of the newly posted information per
unit time and the probability of a user is a susceptible user is 𝑆2 (𝑡)/𝑁2, so an active forwarding
users will contact 𝛽23 𝑆2 (𝑡) susceptible users, among which 𝑚23 𝑝2 𝛽23 𝑆2(𝑡)𝐹2 (𝑡) will choose to
forward the new information and (1 − 𝑚23 𝑝2 )𝛽23 𝑆2 (𝑡)𝐹2 (𝑡) will not.
The forwarding quantity of the newly posted information is given by
𝑡

𝐶2 (𝑡) = ∫0 (𝑚21 𝑝2 𝛽21 𝐼1+ 𝐹2 + 𝑚22 𝑝2 𝛽22 𝐼1− 𝐹2 + 𝑚23 𝑝2 𝛽23 𝑆2 𝐹2 ) 𝑑𝑡.

(4)

The public opinion reproduction ratio 𝕽𝒐 : Since the newly posted Weibo starts at different times
and develops differently under the influence of prior information, we define the information
reproduction ratio
ℜ𝑜 =

𝑚21 𝑝2 𝛽21 𝐼1+,𝜏 +𝑚22 𝑝2 𝛽22 𝐼1−,𝜏 +𝑚23 𝑝2 𝛽23 𝑆20
𝛼2

.

(5)

This is the total number of Information 2 users generated by introducing a typical Information 2
user, at time 𝜏 after Information 1 was posted, during its entire period of active forwarding. The
initial population for Information 2 has been stratified by the exposure of the entire population to
Information 1 during the time interval [0, 𝜏]. The relative size of ℜ𝑜 to the unity determines if
Information 2 can generate an information outbreak: since
𝐹2′ (0) = (𝑚21 𝑝2 𝛽21 𝐼1+,𝜏 +
′

𝑚22 𝑝2 𝛽22 𝐼1−,𝜏 + 𝑚23 𝑝2 𝛽23 𝑆20 − 𝛼2 )𝐹2 (0). We conclude that 𝐹2 (0) > 0 if and only if ℜ𝑜 > 1.

4.2 Data fitting
Parameter estimation:
To fit our model with real data from the Sino-microblog, we use the LS method to estimate the
LTI DT-SFI model parameters and the initial data. In phase 1, the parameter vector is set as Θ1 =
9

(𝑝1 , 𝛽1 , 𝛼1 , 𝑆10 ), and the corresponding numerical calculation based on the parameter vector for
𝐶1 (𝑡) is denoted by 𝑓𝐶1 (𝑘, Θ1 ). The LS error function
𝐿𝑆 = ∑𝑇𝑘=0 |𝑓𝐶1 (𝑘, Θ1 ) − 𝐶1𝑘 |2

(6)

is used in our calculation, where 𝐶1𝑘 denotes the actual cumulative forwarding populations of the
posted information. Similarly, in phase 2, the vector is set as
Θ2 = (𝛽21 , 𝛽22 , 𝛽23 , 𝑚21 , 𝑚22 , 𝑚23 , 𝑝2 , 𝛼2 , 𝑆20 ),
and the corresponding numerical calculation based on the parameter vector for 𝐶2 (𝑡) is denoted
by 𝑓𝐶2 (𝑘, Θ2 ). The LS error function
𝐿𝑆 = ∑𝑇𝑘=0 |𝑓𝐶2 (𝑘, Θ2 ) − 𝐶2𝑘 |2

(7)

is used in our calculation, where 𝐶2𝑘 denotes the actual cumulative forwarding populations of the
newly posted information. Here, 𝑛 = 1,2 … represents the different phases, 𝑘 = 0,1,2, …is the
sampling time, 𝑛 = 1,2,3. We estimate the parameters of our LTI DT-SFI model with the data of
Information B and Information C.

Figure 5. The data fitting results of Information B and Information C.
Figure 5 reports our data fitting results for Information B and Information C on the real data
given in Table 2-3, where the blue star denotes the actual cumulative number of forwarding users
of Information B, the red star denotes the actual cumulative number of forwarding users of
Information C, the green line and the black line denotes the estimated cumulative number of
forwarding users of Information B and Information C, respectively.

Table 5 and Table 6 give estimated values of important parameters for Information B and
Information C, respectively. We can see in phase 2, when Information C was posted during the quasi
steady-state period of Information B, the average exposure rate 𝛽21 was the largest, indicating that
10

an inactive user of the posted Information B was more susceptible to the newly posted Information
C; the average exposure rate 𝛽23 was small, indicating that a susceptible user of the newly posted
Information C contacted the information at a lower rate. In addition, among the three attractiveness
indices, the index 𝑚22 is the largest, which indicates that Information C had the strongest appeal
to a direct immune user of Information B and has the least attractiveness to an inactive user of the
posted Information B.

4.3 Influencing factors analytics: information release and dissemination
In order to make a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the delay in transmission, we now
introduce some additional indices, shown in Figure 6, and show how these can be used t]]]]]]]]]der
different effects of the posted information on newly posted information when the posted information
has reached a quasi steady-state or is still in its outbreak period.
 The outbreak peak 𝐹2𝑚𝑎𝑥 : the maximum of curve 𝐹2 , which reflects the peak user values
of the newly posted information.
 The final size 𝐶2𝑠 : the stable state of curve 𝐶2 , which gives the final size of the total
number of users of the newly posted information.
 the outbreak time 𝑡2𝑏 , the end time 𝑡2𝑒 and the duration 𝑡2𝑖 : the definition depends on
∗
the outbreak threshold 𝐹2 ∗ set in advance, so that 𝐹2 (𝑡2𝑏 ) = 𝐹2 = 𝐹2 (𝑡2𝑒 ). Here, 𝑡2𝑏
denotes the outbreak time of the newly posted information, 𝑡2𝑒 denotes the end time, and
𝑡2𝑖 = 𝑡2𝑒 − 𝑡2𝑏 denotes the duration of the newly posted information transmission. These
time indices will help us judge the start and end of the newly posted information
transmission.
 The outbreak velocity 𝑉2𝑜 and the declining velocity 𝑉2𝑑 : the definition depends on 𝑉2𝑜 =
(𝐹2𝑚𝑎𝑥 − 𝐹2 ∗ )⁄(𝑡2𝑚𝑎𝑥 − 𝑡2𝑏 ) and 𝑉𝑑 = (𝐹2𝑚𝑎𝑥 − 𝐹2 ∗ )⁄(𝑡2𝑒 − 𝑡2𝑚𝑎𝑥 ) when 𝐹2 (𝑡) =
𝐹2𝑚𝑎𝑥 and 𝑡2𝑚𝑎𝑥 is definite, which reflects the speed of the outbreak and the decline of
the newly posted information.

an old information.

To further analyze the different parameters responsible for LTI DT-SFI, we performed an
analysis of partial rank correlation coefficients (PRCCs) [30] to evaluate the sensitivity based on
1000 samples for various input parameters against the threshold condition. According to the
histogram and scatter diagram of R10 dependence, when the correlation is positive, it means that
with the increase of the value of the parameter, the corresponding index value will increase; on the
11

contrary, when the correlation is negative, the index will decrease as the parameter decreases.
Figures 7-10 give the PRCC results and PRCC scatter plots with indices ℜ𝑜 , 𝐹2𝑚𝑎𝑥 , 𝐶2∞ , 𝑡2𝑏 ,
𝑡2𝑖 , 𝑡2𝑚𝑎𝑥 , 𝑉2𝑜 , 𝑉2𝑑 with nine parameters (𝛽21 , 𝛽22 , 𝛽23 , 𝑝2 , 𝛼2, 𝑚21, 𝑚22, 𝑚23, 𝑆20) of the
newly posted information in LTI DT-SFI, respectively.
Figure 7 shows the effect of parameters on the public opinion reproduction ratio ℜ𝑜 of the
delay in transmission in LTI DT-SFI. ℜ𝑜 is strongly positively affected by the average exposure
rate 𝛽22 , the mild exposure attractiveness index 𝑚22 , the average exposure rate 𝛽23 , the unexposure attractiveness index 𝑚23 and the forwarding probability 𝑝2 , and strongly negatively
affected by the average immune rate 𝛼2. The positive correlation effects of the parameters 𝛽21 and
𝑚21 are relatively weak. Overall, strategies to increase the parameters 𝛽22 , 𝛽23 , 𝑝2 , 𝑚22, 𝑚23
and initial value 𝑆20 or to decrease the 𝛼2 can enhance the transmission capability of the newly
posted information.

Figure 7. PRCC results and PRCC scatter plots with indices ℜ𝑜 of different parameters of
the newly posted information in LTI DT-SFI
From Figure 8, the parameters have a similar effect on the forwarding peak 𝐹2𝑚𝑎𝑥 and the
cumulative forwarding population 𝐶2∞ . The un-exposure attractiveness index 𝑚23, the forwarding
probability 𝑝2 and the initial value 𝑆20 of susceptible individuals have a decisive positive
influence on the forwarding peak value 𝐹2𝑚𝑎𝑥 and the final size 𝐶2∞ of delayed information
12

propagation. The effects of the extensive and mild exposure attractiveness parameters which portray
the participation of the population of the posted information are very weak. The above results
indicate that the time interval is long between the two delays in transmission information since the
new information posted in a quasi-steady state into the propagation, at this time, most individuals
who have been exposed to the posted information have entered the immune state. In addition, most
individuals will no longer care about the relevant content due to the possibility of forgetting or
leaving the social network platform. The above conclusions show that when the posted information
enters the steady state, the effect of the individuals who have contacted the posted information is
not obvious. Therefore, the information transmission can be promoted by influencing the number
of new susceptible population.

Figure 8. PRCC results and PRCC scatter plots with indices 𝐹2𝑚𝑎𝑥 and 𝐶2∞ of different
parameters of the newly posted information in LTI DT-SFI
Figure 9 shows the effect of parameters on the climax time 𝑡2𝑚𝑎𝑥 , the outbreak time 𝑡2𝑏 and
the duration 𝑡2𝑖 of the delay in transmission. After mastering the influencing factors of 𝑡2𝑏 and
𝑡2𝑖 , the end time of transmission 𝑡2𝑒 can be calculated. The climax time 𝑡2𝑚𝑎𝑥 , the outbreak time
𝑡2𝑏 and the duration 𝑡2𝑖 are negatively affected by parameters 𝛽23 , 𝑝2 and 𝑚23 in the same
way. In comparison, these parameters have the least impact on 𝑡2𝑏 , especially 𝑚23. The parameter
𝑚22 has a weak negative correlation effect on each time index, and the parameter 𝛼2 is the main
factor to control the duration 𝑡2𝑖 which plays a strong negative correlation effect.

13

Figure 9. PRCC results and PRCC scatter plots with indices 𝑡2𝑚𝑎𝑥 , 𝑡2𝑏 and 𝑡2𝑖 of different
parameters of the newly posted information in LTI DT-SFI
From Figure 10, the un-exposure attractiveness index 𝑚23 and the forwarding probability 𝑝2
have major positive correlation effects on the outbreak velocity 𝑉2𝑜 and the declining velocity 𝑉2𝑑 ,
and the initial value 𝑆20 of susceptible individuals has a mild positive effect on these two indices.
Moreover, the parameter 𝛼2 has a strong negative effect on the 𝑉2𝑜 . In addition, the effects of other
parameters on the velocities are not important. That is to say, the 𝑉2𝑜 and 𝑉2𝑑 will increase
accordingly when the parameters 𝑚23, 𝑝2 and initial value 𝑆20 increase. At the same time, the
𝑉2𝑜 increases with the reduction of parameter 𝛼2. By contrast, the effect of 𝑚23 on the velocities
is greater.

Figure 10. PRCC results and PRCC scatter plots with indices 𝑉2𝑜 and 𝑉2𝑑 of different
parameters of the newly posted information in LTI DT-SFI
Our LTI DT-SFI model concentrates on the influence of the average exposure rates and
attractiveness indexes on the instantaneous forwarding population 𝐹2 (𝑡) and the cumulative
forwarding population 𝐶2 (𝑡) as shown in Figures 11-12 respectively, and the variation of
parameters over time determines the propagation indices. By comparing and analyzing the influence
of average contact rates and attractiveness indexes in Figure 11 and Figure 12 with the variation of
one parameter while fixing other parameters, 𝛽23 and 𝑚23 have a similar overall trend of the
effects on the instantaneous forwarding population 𝐹2 (𝑡) and the cumulative forwarding
population 𝐶2 (𝑡) of the new information. With the increase of the parameters of 𝛽23 and 𝑚23,
the outbreak will accelerate, and the instantaneous number of individuals in the forwarding state can
reach a higher peak and the final size will be larger. In addition, the average exposure rate of 𝛽22
and the mild exposure attractiveness index 𝑚22 have a weak positive influence on the final size of
the cumulative forwarding quantity, and have no obvious influence on the propagation times and
velocities. In contrast, the average exposure rate 𝛽21 and the extensive exposure attractiveness
index 𝑚21 had no significant effect on large interval delay in transmission based on forwarding.
All the above key parameters have no significant effect on the outbreak time, climax time, and
duration of the long-delayed cross-information transmission based on forwarding, which was also
consistent with the results of PRCCs.

5. Short delay in transmission susceptible-forwarding-immune dynamics model
5.1 Model description
Our comprehensive short interval delay in transmission susceptible-forwarding-immune (STI
DT-SFI) dynamics model based on the forwarding quantity is shown in Figure 13. In this model, we
include two phases: In phase 1, a stand-alone information (information 1) is spreading
corresponding to phase 1 in LTI DT-SFI. In phase 2, a piece of newly posted information
(information 2) is posted at 𝑡𝜏 during an outbreak period of the posted information. Here, we also
divide the population into three groups: S-population (𝑆), F-population (𝐹1 , 𝐹2 ) and I-population
(𝐼1+ , 𝐼1− , 𝐼2). In particular, we think of the susceptible state of both the posted information and the
new information as a whole (𝑆). 𝑡𝑖𝑛 is the post time of newly posted information.

Figure 13. A schematic diagram to illustrate information spreading, when the post time of the
newly posted information is during the outbreak period of the posted information.
Phase 1. Post a stand-alone information: The model is consistent with that at phase 1 of LTI DTSFI developed in section 4.1.
Phase 2. Posting a new information during the outbreak period of the posted information:
Considering that the new information is posted during the outbreak period of the old information,
we develop our phase 2 model to describe the concurrent dynamic process of the two related pieces
of information. We consider the difference between the population in active forwarding state or the
immune state out of the active period and the population in the direct immune state of the first (old)
piece of information. Here, we set


an extensive exposure attractiveness index, for the individuals in forwarding state who have
forwarded the posted information but still in their active forwarding period and the individuals
in immune state who have forwarded the old information but are no longer in their active
forwarding period to indicate that this population will be attracted by the new information due
to the relevance of the two pieces of information;
 a mild exposure attractiveness index, for the direct immune population to portray that the
population will be attracted due to a moderate contact;
 an un-exposure attractiveness index, for the integrated susceptible population to describe that
the population will be attracted when they have never read the related information.
Assuming that the number of users (𝑁3 ) who can contact the information in the process of
information propagation on Sina-microblog remains unchanged, we introduce three states of the
population of the newly posted information: the susceptible state (𝑆1) which includes the users who
can be exposed to the old information and the new information, the forwarding state of the new
information (𝐹2 ), the immune state (𝐼2 ). The parameters are shown in the following table 7.

𝛼2

The average rate at which a user in the forwarding state of newly posted information

Each user may have a unique state, with 𝑆1 (𝑡), 𝐹1 (𝑡), 𝐼1+ (𝑡), 𝐼1− (𝑡),𝐹2 (𝑡) and 𝐼2 (𝑡)
denoting the number of users in the susceptible, forwarding and immune state when 𝑡 > 0 ,
respectively. We obtain the following STI DT-SFI dynamics model in phase 2:
𝑑𝑆1 (𝑡)/𝑑𝑡 = −𝛽1 𝑆1 𝐹1 − 𝛽23 𝑆1 𝐹2
𝑑𝐹1 (𝑡)/𝑑𝑡 = 𝑝1 𝛽1 𝑆1 𝐹1 − 𝛽21 𝐹1 𝐹2 − 𝛼1 𝐹1
𝑑𝐼1+ (𝑡)/𝑑𝑡 = −𝛽21 𝐼1+ 𝐹2 + 𝛼1 𝐹1
𝑑𝐼1− (𝑡)/𝑑𝑡 = (1 − 𝑝1 )𝛽1 𝑆1 𝐹1 − 𝛽22 𝐼1− 𝐹2
(8)
𝑑𝐹2 (𝑡)/𝑑𝑡 = 𝑚21 𝑝2 𝛽21 𝐹1 𝐹2 + 𝑚21 𝑝2 𝛽21 𝐼1+ 𝐹2 + 𝑚22 𝑝2 𝛽22 𝐼1− 𝐹2 + 𝑚23 𝑝2 𝛽23 𝑆1 𝐹2 − 𝛼2 𝐹2
𝑑𝐼2 (𝑡)/𝑑𝑡 = (1 − 𝑚21 𝑝2 )𝛽21 𝐹1 𝐹2 + (1 − 𝑚21 𝑝2 )𝛽21 𝐼1+ 𝐹2 + (1 − 𝑚22 𝑝2 )𝛽22 𝐼1− 𝐹2
+(1 − 𝑚23 𝑝2 )𝛽23 𝑆1 𝐹2 + 𝛼2 𝐹2
{
The mass action in phase 2 can be interpreted as follows: An active forwarding user will contact
an average number of 𝛽21 𝑁3 inactive immune users and forwarding users of posted information
per unit time and the probability of a user is an inactive immune user and a forwarding user are
𝐼1+ (𝑡)/𝑁3 and 𝐹1 (𝑡)/𝑁3, so an active forwarding user will contact 𝛽21 𝐼1+ (𝑡) inactive immune
users and 𝛽21 𝐹1 (𝑡) forwarding users, among which 𝑚21 𝑝2 𝛽21 𝐼1+ (𝑡)𝐹2 (𝑡) and
𝑚21 𝑝2 𝛽21 𝐹1 (𝑡)𝐹2 (𝑡) will choose to forward the new information however (1 −
𝑚21 𝑝2 )𝛽2 𝐼1+ (𝑡)𝐹2 (𝑡) and (1 − 𝑚21 𝑝2 )𝛽21 𝐹1 (𝑡)𝐹2 (𝑡) will not; an active forwarding user will
contact an average number of 𝛽22 𝑁3 direct immune users of posted information per unit time and
the probability of a user is a direct immune user is 𝐼1− (𝑡)/𝑁3, so an active forwarding user will
contact 𝛽22 𝐼1− (𝑡) direct immune users, among which 𝑚22 𝑝2 𝛽22 𝐼1− (𝑡)𝐹2 (𝑡) will choose to
forward the new information and (1 − 𝑚22 𝑝2 )𝛽22 𝐼1− (𝑡)𝐹2 (𝑡) will not; an active forwarding user
will contact an average number of 𝛽23 𝑁3 susceptible users and the probability of a user is a
susceptible user is 𝑆1 (𝑡)/𝑁3, so an active forwarding user will contact 𝛽23 𝑆1 (𝑡) susceptible users,
among which 𝑚23 𝑝2 𝛽23 𝑆1 (𝑡)𝐹2 (𝑡) will choose to forward the new information and (1 −
𝑚23 𝑝2 )𝛽23 𝑆1 (𝑡)𝐹2 (𝑡) will not.

to the decrease of 𝑆10𝜏 . It is therefore natural to introduce
ℜ𝑜 =

𝑚21 𝑝2 𝛽21 𝐹1𝜏 +𝑚21 𝑝2 𝛽21 𝐼1+,𝜏 +𝑚22 𝑝2 𝛽22 𝐼1−,𝜏 +𝑚23 𝑝2 𝛽23 𝑆10𝜏

as the STI DT-SFI reproduction ratio.
In the same way, the ℜ𝑜 of STI DT-SFI denotes the comprehensive public opinion generated
by the newly posted Weibo starting at the outbreak period of the posted information. When the
reproduction ratio< 1, it means that the new public opinion will decline. The reproduction ratio> 1
indicates that the new public opinion will grow exponentially initially.
5.2 Data fitting
Parameter estimation:
To use our model to explore some distinctions of the qualitative behaviors for prediction, we
use the LS method to estimate the STI DT-SFI model parameters and the initial data of our model.
The vector is set as Θ3 = (𝑝1 , 𝛽1 , 𝛼1 , 𝑝2 , 𝛽21 , 𝛽22 , 𝛽23 , 𝑚21 , 𝑚22 , 𝑚23 , 𝛼2 , 𝑆10 ) , and the
corresponding numerical calculation based on the parameter vectors for 𝐶1 (𝑡) and 𝐶2 (𝑡) are
denoted by 𝑓𝐶1 (𝑘, Θ3 ) and 𝑓𝐶2 (𝑘, Θ3 ), respectively. The LS error function

𝐿𝑆 = ∑𝑇𝑘=0|𝑓𝐶1 (𝑘, Θ3 ) − 𝐶1𝑘 | + ∑𝑇𝑘=0|𝑓𝐶2 (𝑘, Θ3 ) − 𝐶2𝑘 |

(11)

is used in our calculation, where 𝐶1𝑘 and 𝐶2𝑘 denote the actual cumulative forwarding
populations of the posted information and the newly posted information, here, 𝑛 = 1,2,3
represents the different phases, 𝑘 = 0,1,2, …is the sampling time. 𝑛 = 1,2,3. We estimate the
parameters of our STI DT-SFI model with the data of Information A and Information B.

19

Figure 14. The data fitting results of Information A and Information B
In the data fitting of STI DT-SFI, we use the same method as that in Section 4.2 to fit the data
of Information A and Information B. As shown in Figure 14, we performed data fitting of
Information A and Information B on the real data in Table 1-2, where the pink star denotes the actual
cumulative number of forwarding users of Information A, the red star denotes the actual cumulative
number of forwarding users of Information B, the green line and the blue line denotes the estimated
cumulative number of forwarding users in the early and later period of Information A, respectively,
and the black line denotes the estimated cumulative number of forwarding users of Information B.
It can be seen that our STI DT-SFI model achieves accurate estimation.

Table 8 gives some important values of parameter (relevant to the early period of the outbreak)
estimation of Information A, and Table 9 gives some important values of parameter estimation for
the later period data of Information A and all data of Information B. We can see in phase 2, when
Information B was posted during the outbreak period of Information A, the average exposure rate
𝛽21 and 𝛽22 are much larger than 𝛽1 and 𝛽23 , which indicates that users who have been exposed
to Information A will contact Information B at a greater rate than new susceptible users. In addition,
the un-exposure attractiveness index 𝑚23 is the largest among the three attractiveness indexes,
since the time interval between two information posted is small, and people who have not been
exposed to relevant information may have a greater interest in new information, the outbreak of
Information B has the strongest appeal to susceptible users.

5.3 Influencing factors analytics: information release and dissemination
To further analyze the impact of different parameters in STI DT-SFI model for the crosspropagation dynamics, we performed PRCCs to analyze the relationship between the influence and
20

the range of variation of parameters on the indexes. Figures 15-18 give the PRCC results and PRCC
scatter plots with indices ℜ𝑜 , 𝐹2𝑚𝑎𝑥 , 𝐶2∞ , 𝑡2𝑏 , 𝑡2𝑖 , 𝑡2𝑚𝑎𝑥 , 𝑉2𝑜 , 𝑉2𝑑 mentioned above with
nine parameters (𝛽21 , 𝛽22 , 𝛽23 , 𝑝2 , 𝛼2, 𝑚21, 𝑚22, 𝑚23 , 𝑆10) of the newly posted information in
STI DT-SFI, respectively.
The average exposure rate 𝛽23 , the un-exposure attractiveness index 𝑚23 , the forwarding
probability 𝑝2 and the initial value 𝑆10 make strong contributions to the public opinion
reproduction ratio ℜ𝑜 positively, and the average immune rate 𝛼2 has a strong negative effect on
it as shown in Figure 14. The positive correlation effects of parameters 𝛽21 , 𝛽22 , 𝑚21 and 𝑚22
are relatively weak. In general, strategies that can affect the parameters 𝛽23 , 𝑚23 , 𝑝2 and the
initial value 𝑆10 to increase or the parameter 𝛼2 to decrease can increase the initial propagation
capacity of the newly posted information. On the other hand, we can decrease the parameters 𝛽23 ,
𝑚23, 𝑝2 and the initial value 𝑆10 to reduce the initial propagation ability of the new information.

Figure 15. PRCC results and PRCC scatter plots with indices ℜ𝑜 of different parameters of
the newly posted information in STI DT-SFI.
The average contact rate of 𝛽21 , 𝛽23 , the forwarding probability 𝑝2 , the mild exposure
attractiveness index 𝑚22, the un-exposure attractiveness index 𝑚23 and the initial value 𝑆10 of
susceptible individuals have strong positive impacts on the high peak 𝐹2𝑚𝑎𝑥 and the final size 𝐶2∞
as shown in Figure 16. In contrast, 𝑆10 plays a major role, and the impact of 𝛽22 and 𝑚21 are
less significant. The above results show that individuals who have been exposed to but have not
21

forwarded the posted information are more sensitive to the new information with mild exposure
attractiveness due to the understanding of the former information. In addition, the average immune
rate 𝛼2 has a strong negative effect on the 𝐹2𝑚𝑎𝑥 .

Figure 16. PRCC results and PRCC scatter plots with indices 𝐹2𝑚𝑎𝑥 and 𝐶2∞ of different
parameters of the newly posted information in STI DT-SFI.
Figure 17 indicates that the influence of each parameter on 𝑡2𝑚𝑎𝑥 and 𝑡2𝑏 are not obvious,
and the parameters 𝛽23 , 𝛼2 and the initial value 𝑆10 have negative effects on the duration 𝑡2𝑖 ,
and the 𝛽21 has a weak positive effect on it. This means that the average contact rate at which users
in the susceptible state can contact the second information is the most important factor affecting the
duration 𝑡2𝑖 of delay in transmission. The smaller the average contact rate is, the longer the
duration of new information transmission will be within a certain range, and then slowing down the
development of information transmission.

22

Figure 17. PRCC results and PRCC scatter plots with indices 𝑡2𝑚𝑎𝑥 , 𝑡2𝑏 and 𝑡2𝑖 of different
parameters of the newly posted information in STI DT-SFI.
Figure 18 shows the PRCCs results of the outbreak velocity 𝑉2𝑜 and the declining velocity
𝑉2𝑑 of STI DT-SFI based on forwarding under multi-parameters changes. From the results, the
average exposure rate 𝛽21 , 𝛽23 , the forwarding probability 𝑝2 , the mild exposure attractiveness
index 𝑚22, un-exposure attraction index 𝑚23, and the initial value 𝑆10 of susceptible individuals
make strong positive contributions on 𝑉2𝑜 and 𝑉2𝑑 . The average exposure rate 𝛽22 and the
extensive exposure attractiveness index 𝑚21 has no significant effect on the velocities. That is to
say, the outbreak velocity 𝑉2𝑜 and the declining velocity 𝑉2𝑑 can be increased with the increase
of the parameters 𝛽21 , 𝛽23 , 𝑝2 , 𝑚22 , 𝑚23 and the initial value 𝑆10 . On the contrary, if the
parameters decrease, the propagation velocities will slow down.

23

Figure 18. PRCC results and PRCC scatter plots with indices 𝑉2𝑜 and 𝑉2𝑑 of different
parameters of the newly posted information in STI DT-SFI.
Here, we also take into consideration the influence of the average exposure rate and
attractiveness parameters on the instantaneous forwarding population 𝐹2 (𝑡) and the cumulative
forwarding population 𝐶2 (𝑡) of STI DT-SFI as shown in Figures 19-20 respectively. The
comparative analysis shows that the larger the average contact rate and attractiveness indexes are,
the larger the instantaneous forwarding quantity and the cumulative forwarding quantity are. The
final size is also affected. the average exposure rate of 𝛽21 , 𝛽23 , the mild exposure attractiveness
index 𝑚22, and the un-exposure attractiveness index 𝑚23 are the main influencing factors of STI
DT-SFI model, and they can play a significant role in the final size of the newly posted information
within a certain range. So priority must be placed on controlling these parameters. In addition, the
extensive exposure attractiveness index 𝑚21 has only a small magnitude of effects, while the effect
of parameter 𝛽22 is significant and has a relatively obvious impact. The impact of each parameter
on the outbreak timing and increasing/declining velocities is negligible, which is consistent with the
results of PRCCs.

population 𝐹2 (𝑡) and the cumulative forwarding population 𝐶2 (𝑡) in STI DT-SFI.

6. Comparison and Discussion
Figure 21 shows the trend of the cumulative forwarding users of Information B and Information
C when the newly posted information is posted during the steady-state period of the posted
information in Tables 2-3. The time lag with which the newly posted information is posted has a
significant impact on the process of public opinion dissemination and the final size of the cumulative
number of forwarding users. If the newly posted information is posted during the quasi steady state
period of opinion propagation, then the earlier the newly posted information is posted, the earlier
the cumulative forwarding users will peak, though the final size of the cumulative forwarding users
will be close to each other. This, in conjunction with our parameter sensitivity analysis results,
shows that for the LTI DT-SFI situation, the un-exposure attractiveness index and the average
exposure rate 𝛽23 are the key elements to promote the cross-propagation and that once reaching
the quasi steady state, the timing of posting the new information has an insignificant impact on the
final size of forwarding users.
In contrast, Figure 22 shows the trend of the cumulative forwarding users of Information A and
Information B when the newly posted information is posted during the outbreak period of the posted
information in Table 1-2. The time lag with which the newly posted information is posted has
noticeable impact on both the dynamic process of public opinion dissemination and the final size of
the cumulative number of forwarding users. If the newly posted information can be posted during
the outbreak period of the old information, then the earlier the new information is posted, the greater
the cumulative forwarding population and the final size of the cumulative forwarding users will be.
25

This, combined with our parameter sensitivity analysis results, shows that in the STI DT-SFI case,
the mild exposure attractiveness index 𝑚22, the average exposure rates 𝛽21 and 𝛽23 , and the
un-exposure attractiveness index 𝑚23 can all directly influence the interaction between
information posted sequentially to increase the “heat” (popularity) of the newly posted information.

Figure 21 An illustration of a public opinion dissemination process with newly posted
information posted with different time lags but during the quasi steady state period of the
posted information.

Figure 22 An illustration of a public opinion dissemination process with newly posted
information posted at different times: the newly posted information is posted during the
outbreak period of the posted information.
Our model-based analysis recommends strategies on how different parameters should be
adjusted to achieve the best information dissemination outcomes. For two pieces of relevant
information separated by a relative long posting lag, strategies to increase the average exposure rate
𝛽23 and the un-exposure attractiveness index 𝑚23 are recommendations. These strategies can be
achieved if opinion leaders with a large number of followers can participate in the information copropagation. On the contrary, reducing the public’s attention to a new piece of information can be
achieved by efforts in delaying the posting of the new information, and/or by effectively reducing
the potential correlation between the two pieces of information (reducing values of the correlation
parameters 𝛽21 , 𝛽22 , 𝑚21, 𝑚22). Additionally, if our goal is for the final size of the cumulative
forwarding users of the new information not be impacted by the relevant information already posted
online, the new information should be posted during the quasi steady state period of the posted
information.
For two pieces of information with a short interval between postings, we recommend to
develop strategies to alter the interaction between the information for effectively managing the
information transmission indices we introduced. If we aim to make the new information outbreak
faster with a large peak value of forwarding, we should increase the average exposure rate 𝛽21 and
26

mild exposure attractiveness index 𝑚22 by persuading the original post owner to post or forward
the information earlier during the outbreak period of the posted information when the posted
information has obtained certain public attention, and increase the relevance and attraction of the
newly posted information to the forwarding users or immune users of the posted information.
Alternatively, we should persuade some opinion leaders to forward the new information along with
their insights to 𝛽23 and 𝑚23.

7. Conclusions
It is often that relevant information is posted sequentially in fast evolving public health events
such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Consequently, modeling the impact of delay in cross-transmission
or co-propagation is significant to identify the best strategies to communicate key public messages
through social media. In this study, we proposed and examined two classes of models, large delay
in transmission susceptible-forwarding-immune (LTI DT-SFI) dynamics model and the short delay
in transmission susceptible-forwarding-immune (STI DT-SFI) dynamics model based on the
forwarding users in Weibos, and we parametrized our models using real data related to COVID-19
pandemic in the Chinese Sina-Microblog. Our goal is to use these parametrized models to
understand the influence of different time lags in the information posting on the co-propagation of
related information in the Microblog.
Our model formulation focused on the transmission mechanism of information in the social
network, where a new Weibo may be posted in different phases—outbreak phase and/or quasi steady
state phase—of some relevant Weibo already posted. Our goal is to examine the impact of post
timing, in relation to the old information, of the new information on its peak value and final size of
forwarding users. As we have shown, this impact depends on the correlation of the old and new
information, and on the phase of the old information transmission when the new information is
posted. It is hoped that our DT-SFI dynamics model fills in some theoretical gap about optimizing
information posting strategies to maximize communication efforts to deliver key public health
messages to the public for better outcomes of public health emergency management.
