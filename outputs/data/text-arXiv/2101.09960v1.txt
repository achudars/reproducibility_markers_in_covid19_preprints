Abstract
The difference in COVID 19 death rates across political regimes has
caught a lot of attention. The “efficient autocracy” view suggests that autocracies may be more efficient at putting in place policies that contain COVID
19 spread. On the other hand, the “biasing autocracy” view underlines that
autocracies may be under reporting their COVID 19 data. We use fixed
effect panel regression methods to discriminate between the two sides of
the debate. Our results show that a third view may in fact be prevailing:
once pre-determined characteristics of countries are accounted for, COVID
19 death rates equalize across political regimes. The difference in death
rate across political regime seems therefore to be primarily due to omitted
variable bias.

Introduction

While democratic countries have previously been shown to overperfom compared
to autocracies with respect to health outcomes (Franco et al., 2004; Besley and Kudamatsu, 2006; Kudamatsu, 2012; Bollyky et al., 2019; Pieters et al., 2016), data
shows that, in the specific case of the COVID 19 pandemic, democratic countries
may be fairing much worse (Sorci et al., 2020), as illustrated in Figure 1. Indeed,
50 days after the beginning of the pandemic1 , democratic countries’ COVID 19
death rate is on average larger than that of non democratic countries by approximately 3.9 per 100,000. That is, 50 days after the beginning of the pandemic in a
democratic country, the fatality rate in a democracy is on average 7.3 times larger
than in an autocracy.

A debate (Ang, 2020) has emerged trying to unpack the reasons behind such
wide differences across political regimes: a priori, all other things equal, the political regime should not be related to the spread of a disease. We distinguish three
main hypothesis to explain this difference.

A first interpretation relates to the relative efficiency of social distancing measures in democracies and autocracies. Some have argued that democracies may be
less well equipped to implement and enforce social distancing policies (Cepaluni
et al., 2020; Sorci et al., 2020), or that they may be implementing them with a sub
optimal timing (Sebhatu et al., 2020). That is, in this view, autocracies are more
able to implement social distancing measures. We will refer to this interpretation
as the efficient autocracy hypothesis.

A second interpretation is that there may be voluntarily misreporting of COVID
1

Defined as when the number of cases reaches 0.4 per 100,000 in a country.

19 data, in particular by non democratic countries. For example, Tuite et al.
(2020a) report that Egypt may have underreported its number of cases, Tuite
et al. (2020b) report that Iran may also have underreported its number of cases,
while Kavanagh (2020) discusses that China’s political regime may have hindered
its initial response to the pandemic. In this view, there are systematic differences
between the real and the reported death rate. These differences are voluntary and
systematically linked to the type of political regime. We will refer to this interpretation as the biasing autocracy hypothesis.

A third interpretation has caught less attention (Ashraf, 2020): democracies
and autocracies tend to have systematically different characteristics apart from
their political regimes. These differences, once accounted for, may in fact be sufficient to explain the difference in both the real and reported death rate. This
would leave the contributions due to voluntary under-reporting or differences in
policies to matter only marginally. An example of such differences would be that
autocracies tend to have much younger populations (and therefore, a much smaller
real death rate, all other things equal) but also a lower ability to test (and therefore, a much smaller reported death rate, all other things equal). We refer to this
interpretation as the simply different autocracy hypothesis.

The three aforementionned hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, and simple
reduced form econometric approaches can help measuring how much each of them
contributes to explain the differences observed across political regimes. Take the
case where the econometrician only observes a reported death rate rather than
the real death rate but can observe the variables determining COVID 19 real and
reported death rate. Also assume that there are two such types of variables: fixed

3

characteristics2 (say, the share of the population aged 65+ who would determine
real death rate or the number of hospital beds per capita who would determine
both real and reported death rates) and policy response. Under the efficient autocracy hypothesis, regressing the reported death rate on a measure of democracy
and controlling for all fixed parameters would lead to a positive and significant
coefficient on democracy. However, further controlling for policy response in the
regression should bring the coefficient on democracy close to zero and render it
non significant. That is, all the differences observed between democracies and autocracies in their reported death rate, once fixed characteristics are accounted for,
would be due to the difference in policy response across these two types of regime.
In this case, there may be a difference between the real and the reported death
rate, but this difference is not systematically linked to the political regime. In fact,
these results would indicate that the policy response of autocracies is better than
that of democracies, from the perspective of COVID 19 death rate.

Under the biasing autocracy hypothesis, in a regression of reported death rates
on a measure of democracy and all relevant controls (including policy response),
the coefficient on democracy should be positive and significant. That is, despite
controlling for all relevant characteristics and policy response, there still is a systematic difference between democratic and non democratic countries which is not
accounted for. In that case, the only reason why a difference may remain would be
due to systematic underreporting of casualties by non democratic regimes. This
would be due to the fact that the difference between the real and the reported
death rate is always larger for autocracies.3 While the real death rate would be
2

We call fixed characteristics the variable that are pre determined and can not be changed
in the time horizon of interest in the paper. In the long run, all characteristics determining the
death rate such as, say, the GDP per capita, can of course be considered at least partly as an
outcome of the political regime (Acemoglu et al., 2019).
3
Note that our methodology is neutral with respect to which political regime may be biasing

4

identical once all confounding factors are accounted for, the reported death rates
remain different even when controlling for the characteristics influencing non voluntary under reporting.

We use daily level data of COVID 19 death rates of 137 countries for the first
50 days of the epidemic and resort to simple reduced form econometric methods
using the panel structure of the data. First we start by looking into the evolution
of daily total death rates across political regimes, using a regression with no controls except country fixed effects (Regression 1). We then include controls for fixed
characteristics of countries that are likely to determine the real COVID 19 death
rate and allow them to matter differently across time (Regression 2). Finally, we
also include controls for the stringency of social distancing measures and allow
these to matter differently across time (Regression 3). Comparing Regression 2 to
Regression 3 addresses the efficient autocracy hypothesis: any difference between
the coefficient on democratic regime between Regressions 2 and 3 would be due to
the differential in policy response across political regimes. An increase would indicate that autocracies implement more stringent social distancing measures that
are successful in decreasing the death rate. Comparing Regression 1 to Regression
3 addresses the biasing autocracy and the simply different autocracy hypothesis:
once all controls for both fixed characteristics and policy response are accounted
for, does the difference between autocratic and democratic regimes remains (biasing autocracy hypothesis) or vanishes (simply different autocracy hypothesis)?

Our results indicate that the inclusion of controls for country characteristics
and policy response is in fact enough to remove almost all cross regime difference
in COVID 19 mortality rates. In particular, the population susceptibility to die
and allows for democratic regimes to be underreporting more than non democratic regimes.

upon contamination and geographical characteristics seem to be the main contributors explaining the differences observed across political regimes.

Section 2 of this paper presents the data. Section 3 elaborates on the methodology used to test our hypotheses. Section 4 and 5 present our main results. Finally,
Section 6 provides a discussion of our main findings and Section 7 concludes.

Data

In order to investigate our hypothesis, we assemble a dataset that comprises information on daily cases and deaths in the first 50 days of the pandemic for 137
countries. Our dependent variable, the daily country-level total number of reported cases and reported deaths due to the COVID-19 virus is from Dong et al.
(2020) 4 . Our main variable of interest, the classification of political regimes along
the autocratic-democratic scale, comes from the Polity IV project (Center for Systemic Peace, 2015).

Under the simply different autocracy hypothesis, accounting for the differences
in characteristics of countries would suffice to explain the difference in reported
mortality rates across political regimes. We therefore collected an extensive array
of country level variables. To proxy for income and health infrastructure differences, we gathered data on gross domestic product per capita in 2018 from the
World economic outlook survey (IMF), and completed it with the World Factbook
(CIA). Furthermore, information on the number of available hospital beds (per
thousand inhabitants) is retrieved from the World Bank, to account for differences

in health infrastructure that may drive the mortality difference (actual and reported death rates).

To capture differences in demographic characteristics which may explain the
speed of the spread of the disease, we use data on countries’ total population and
density in 2019 from the World Bank, and data on countries’ urbanization rate
in 2019 from the World in Data website. To control for the effect of geographical
characteristics, we collect data on the latitude and longitude of each country’s
capital from the World Cities Database, and classify each country according to its
World Bank region.5 Finally, to control for population risk of mortality, we include
the share of population aged 65+ (from the World Bank) and, since air pollution
has been shown to be associated with COVID 19 death rates (Zhu et al., 2020),
we use summary exposure values to ambient ozone pollution and ambient particle
matter pollution from the Global Burden Disease dataset (2017).

To test the efficient autocracy hypothesis, we use information on countries’
different COVID 19 containment policies from the “Variation in Government Responses to COVID-19” dataset (Hale et al., 2020). This dataset includes a daily
policy stringency index based on the aggregation of 17 policy indicators6 .

Given that the data on our dependent variable is at the daily level, this allows
us to construct a panel dataset that comprises a total of 137 countries7 , classified
as either democratic or non democratic, for which we have information on all the
5

These are: East Asia and Pacific, Europe and Central Asia, Latin America and Caribbean,
Middle East and North Africa, North America, South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.

previously mentioned national characteristics. Therefore, our dataset displays information (by day and by country) on the total number of reported deaths due
to the COVID-19 virus, on the stringency of policy measures taken by a given
country, and on all other relevant characteristics of that country. We focus on the
first 50 days since the beginning of the pandemic in each country, which we define
as having more than 0.4 cases per 100,000

Methodology

Given the country-day panel structure of our data, we resort to fixed effect panel
reduced form econometric methods to look into the differences in COVID 19 casualty rates across political regimes and time. This method allows us to remove the
influence of all time invariant differences across countries by including countries
fixed effects. This further allows us to control for an extensive set of countries’
pre-determined characteristics and for differences in containment policies across
countries.

We specify the following regression equation, which we run using Ordinary
Least Squares:
8
Because our outcome of interest is death per capita, it makes sense to use cases per capita
rather than the absolute number of cases to determine the beginning of the pandemic. In
Appendix A.4, we show that results are robust to using alternatives thresholds. In Appendix A.3,
we show that the timing of the beginning of the pandemic does not seem to differ significantly
across political regimes.

democraticc is a dummy indicating that the Polity IV score of country c is positive.
time.f rom.startt is a set of fixed effect for each day since the beginning of the pandemic. The interaction of democraticc with time.f rom.startt allows us to track
day by day the evolution of the difference in death rates across political regimes, a
standard approach in economics (see Duflo (2001) or Cassan (2019) among others).

Xc is a large set of controls for countries’ pre determined characteristics: GDP
per capita, number of hospital beds per 1000, population, density, urbanization
rate, share of population aged 65+, summary exposure value to particle matters
pollution, summary exposure value to ambient ozone pollution, as well as for the
square of these variables, World Bank regions fixed effects, latitude and longitude.
We interact all these variables with the time.f rom.startt fixed effects to allow
their effect to vary over time.

Yct is a measure of country policy response to the pandemic. It is a stringency
index of governmental response (as measured at t-15 to allow for lags in its effect)
We also include the square level of this variable to allow for non-linear effects.
Furthermore, we interact these variables with the set of time.f rom.startt fixed
effects, to control for their time varying effect. δc is a set of country fixed effects.

9

Finally, ωct is a set of day of the week fixed effect interacted with time.f rom.startt
fixed effects, to control for variations in reporting across days of the week.

We perform this regression iteratively. First, we do not implement any of the
Xc and Yct controls (Regression 1). This allows us to see the evolution of the
difference in casualty rates across political regimes when no confounding factors
are accounted for. Then, we implement Xc but not Yct (Regression 2). This will
allow us to see how much of the difference across political regimes survives once
the different pre-determined characteristics of countries are accounted for. Finally,
we add the Yct policy response controls (Regression 3).

This iterative procedure allows us to address the different sides of the debate
on the role of political regime in fighting COVID 19. Comparing Regression 2 to
Regression 3 addresses the efficient autocracy hypothesis: any difference between
the βt coefficients on democratic regime between Regressions 2 and 3 would be due
to the differential in policy response across political regimes. An increase would indicate that autocracies implement more stringent social distancing measures that
are successful in decreasing the COVID 19 death rate.

Comparing Regression 1 to Regression 3 addresses the biasing autocracy and
simply different autocracy hypothesis: once all controls for both fixed characteristics and policy response are accounted for, do the βt coefficients remain positive
(biasing autocracy) or do they equalize to zero (simply different autocracy)? Note
that these hypotheses are not mutually exclusive: autocracies may well be efficient, biasing and different at the same time. Our methodology allows to capture
this possibility: if the βt coefficients decrease but remain large and significant
when passing from Regression 1 to Regression 3 and change but remain large and

10

significant between Regression 2 and Regression 3, then this would support the
simultaneous presence of the three hypotheses.

Results

Figure 2 presents the βt coefficients from Equation 1 for all three versions of the
specification.9 The first panel presents the results of Regression 1, when no controls excepting country and day of the week fixed effects are included. The death
rates start diverging across political regimes roughly 10 days after the beginning
of the pandemic. After 50 days, the βt coefficient reaches 0.5, which represents
135% of the mean.

The second panel includes controls for pre-determined characteristics interacted with day fixed effects. The βt coefficients become precisely estimated zeros.
That is, once countries’ differences in characteristics are taken into account, the
difference in death rates across political regimes does not survive. Hence, we do
not find support for the biasing autocracy hypothesis with our methodology.

The third panel adds controls for countries’ policy response to the pandemic.
As a result, our coefficients of interest βt remain virtually unaffected. That is, our
results do not support the efficient autocracy hypothesis.10 Therefore, once systematic differences across countries’ characteristics and policy responses are taken
into consideration, the differences in death rates apparent in Figure 1 and in the
first panel of Figure 2 vanish. The reason why reported COVID 19 death rates
9

In Appendix A.4, we show that results are robust to using alternatives definition of the start
of the pandemic in a country.
10
To test if these results are driven by an outlier country, we run Regression 1, 2 and 3 137
times, removing one country at a time. We plot the 50 coefficients of interests of each of these
411 regressions in Figure 6 of Appendix A.5. It can be seen that the results are robust to the
omission of any single country.

11

differ across political regimes is fully accounted for by factors which systematically
differ between democracies and autocracies. That is, our results indicate that the
simply different autocracy hypothesis is prevailing. That is, our results do not
support neither the fact that autocracies are more efficient at controlling the pandemic nor that they are voluntarily under reporting casualty more often.

Which characteristics matter?

Having seen that the inclusion of controls is sufficient to remove the “political
regime” effect on COVID 19 death rate, we now move to a related question: which
characteristics are contributing to closing the COVID 19 death rate gap between
autocratic and democratic gap? In order to do so, we group our control variables
in five categories:
- Geographical controls (latitude, longitude, World Bank region fixed effects)
- Wealth controls (GDP per capita, hospital beds per capita). These will proxy
for the quality of the health system in the country, and will likely influence both
the real and the reported death rate.
- Demographic controls (population, density, urbanization rate): these are likely
to influence the speed of the spread of the pandemic.
- Population fragility controls (share of population aged 65+ and exposure to pollution): these are likely to influence the lethality of COVID 19 for a given spread
of the disease.
- Policy response.
We run Regression 1, removing each of these groups of controls one at a time.
Figure 3 presents the βt coefficients for each of these regressions. It also includes
the coefficients of the original results of Regression 1 for comparison (we do not

12

report the confidence intervals on these coefficients for readability).

Two set of controls seem to matter most. The first set of controls are the controls related to population fragility (which contain notably the share of population
aged 65+). The second set of controls that seems to affect the coefficient is the
geographic controls set. That is, the main reason why mortality rates from COVID
seem to differ across political regimes may be that autocratic regime tend to have
a population that is less susceptible to die from COVID 19 and to be located in
regions in which COVID 19 appears to be less lethal. Interpreting the geographic
controls is not straightforward, but it is reasonable to say that they seem to indicate that country characteristics correlated with geography and not captured by
our extensive set of controls may play an important part in explaining COVID 19
mortality.

Discussion

A few remarks are in order to help interpret our results. First, one should keep
in mind that the variables that we consider pre-determined characteristics, such
as the GDP per capita are only pre-determined in the time horizon that we are
considering. Over the long run, they are an outcome of the political regime. See
for example Acemoglu et al. (2019), who show that democracy causes growth. In
that sense, our results do not take into consideration the long term effect of political regimes on the variables that may determine COVID 19 death rates.

For instance, a better health care system will lead to both a lower real death
rate (infected individuals are better treated) and a higher reported death rate (infected individuals’ death is better attributed to COVID 19). If, as has been argued

13

in the literature (Franco et al., 2004; Besley and Kudamatsu, 2006; Kudamatsu,
2012; Bollyky et al., 2019; Pieters et al., 2016), democracies tend to have better
health care policies; in the long run, the health care system (which we consider as
pre-determined) will be better in democracies because of the political regime, which
will causally affect both real and reported death rates across political regimes.

Second, our focus is only on COVID 19 death rates. Arguably, however, one
may have wanted to study death rates from all causes rather than just from COVID
19. Even in times of pandemic, governments should aim at preserving the health
of their citizens from all sources of harm, not from one specific cause. Given the
attention given to COVID 19 death rates, a pro-democracy argument would be
that while there does not seem to be differences across political regimes for COVID
19 death rates, this may hide the fact that autocracies have focused on decreasing
COVID 19 death rate at the expense of death from other sources.

One could develop this idea even further and argue that democracies have
higher COVID 19 mortality rates because they are better at preventing non COVID
19 deaths, leading to a population which is on average older and therefore more
likely to die if infected by COVID 19. This question can unfortunately not be
tackled with the available data, and we leave it to future research (when mortality
data from all causes will be available for a sufficient number of countries), but note
that the differences in countries’ population’s susceptibility to die from COVID 19
upon contamination seem to be one of the main drivers of the difference in COVID
19 mortality rates across political regimes, all other things equal.

Third, our findings do not contradict previous studies on under reporting of
COVID 19 data, in particular country specific studies. Indeed, because of the sta-

14

tistical analysis used, our results do not imply that no single country underreported
or manipulated its COVID 19 mortality data. However, our results do address the
widespread idea that autocracies are systematically and willingly under reporting
COVID 19 casualties. What our results do indicate is that under reporting (by
any political regime) is primarily due to the different characteristics of countries
that are correlated with the political regime rather than a direct causal effect of
the political regime.

That is, a plausible interpretation is that autocratic governments may well under report data while not manipulating it. One could argue that even if autocracies
are under reporting COVID 19 death rates, this may be primarily driven by their
overall incapacity to link death to its cause rather than to a direct attempt at data
manipulation. The low reported COVID 19 death rate in autocracies may in part
be due to the lower level of development of both the public health infrastructure
and the statistical apparatus of autocracies. However, and this goes back to our
first point, over the long run, public health infrastructure and statistical apparatus
may well be determined by the political regime.

Conclusion

In this paper, we investigated the COVID 19 death rate gap between democratic
and autocratic countries. We formulated three main hypotheses based on the previous literature: the gap can be due to the fact that autocracies are more efficient
at implementing restricting policy measures; that autocracies are underreporting
their COVID 19 data and that autocracies simply have different characteristics
that can explain the death rate gap. Our analysis, relying on simple econometric

15

tools, allows to make progress in the debate around the sources of the observed
differences in COVID 19 death rates across political regimes.

We show that once pre-determined characteristics and policy responses are
taken into account, COVID 19 death rates do not exhibit any difference across
political regimes: the coefficients on democracy become precisely estimated zeros.
Our results therefore do not show support neither for the efficient autocracy nor
for the biasing autocracy hypotheses, as we do not find evidence that autocracies
are neither systematically better at preventing COVID 19 death nor that they are
more often under reporting casualties.

Our findings indicate that democracies and autocracies are simply different,
and that these differences are sufficient to account for all the observed differences
in COVID 19 death rates. Finally, we analyzed which controls matter most in
explaining the difference in COVID 19 death rates. We found that characteristics
related to the vulnerability of the population to the disease and geographical controls appeared to be of significant importance.

Data sources and descriptive statistics

Table 1 presents the data sources used to compute the variables exploited in our
analysis.
Table 2 presents the descriptive statistics for our variable. Our final dataset
comprises a total of 137 countries for which we have all the variables and for which
we observe 50 days of data since the beginning of the pandemic.

Polity score, by country

Table 3 presents the polity IV score of all countries that are included in our sample.
Countries whose score is higher than 0 are classified as democratic.

A.3

Political regime and start of the pandemic

Our analysis focuses on the evolution of the death rates across time since the
beginning of the pandemic in each country. We verify whether the political regime
determines when these first contaminations are reached, which may imply that
the timing that we rely on is biased. In order to do so, we run the following OLS
regressions:

time.to.startc = α + β1 ∗ democraticc + Xc + c

(2)

time.to.startc is the number of days between the start of the pandemic in
country c and the 20th of January. We specify three variations of Equation 2:
if the country has declared 4 or 6 per 100,000 cases or has reached 100 cases.
Table 4 presents the results. We find no statistically significant difference across
19

political regimes for the start of the pandemic. Note that the number of countries
reaching both 100 total cases and for which we observe 50 days since the first 100
case is 135: two countries do not reach 50 days after the first 100 cases in our data
compared to our main sample.

Alternative definitions of the start of the pandemic

Figures 4 and 5 reproduce Figure 2, using 0.6 cases per 100,000 and 100 cases
reported cases as the definition of the start of the pandemic in a country, respectively. Results remain unaffected by this change in definition of the beginning of
the pandemic. Note that the number of countries reaching both 100 total cases
and for which we observe 50 days since the first 100 case is 135: two countries
do not reach 50 days after the first 100 cases in our data compared to our main
sample.

A.5

Robustness check: removing one country at a time

In order to test if an outlier country is driving our findings, we run each regression
133 times, removing one country at a time. We plot the 50 coefficients of interests
of each of these 399 regressions in Figure 6, which replicates Figure 2. It can be
seen that the results are robust to the omission of any single country.
