Abstract
A mathematical model was developed describing the dynamic of the COVID-19
virus over a population considering that the infected can either be symptomatic
or not. The model was calibrated using data on the confirmed cases and death
from several countries like France, Philippines, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom,
China, and the USA. First, we derived the basic reproduction number, R0 , and
estimated the effective reproduction Reff for each country. Second, we were
interested in the merits of interventions, either by distancing or by treatment.
Results revealed that total and partial containment is effective in reducing the
transmission. However, its duration may be long to eradicate the disease (104
days for France). By setting the end of intervention as the day when hospital
capacity is reached, numerical simulations showed that the duration can be
reduced (up to only 39 days for France if the capacity is 1000 patients). Further,
results pointed out that the effective reproduction number remains large after
containment. Therefore, testing and isolation are necessary to stop the disease.

1. Introduction
In late 2019, a disease outbreak emerged in a city of Wuhan, China. The
culprit was a certain strain called Coronavirus Disease 2019 or COVID-19 in
brief (Wor, 2020a). This virus has been identified to cause fever, cough, shortness of breath, muscle ache, confusion, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhoea, chest
pain, diarrhea, and nausea and vomiting (Hui et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020).

COVID-19 belongs to the Coronaviridae family. A family of coronaviruses that
cause diseases in humans and animals, ranging from the common cold to more
severe diseases. Although only seven coronaviruses are known to cause disease
in humans, three of these, COVID-19 included, can cause a much severe infection, and sometimes fatal to humans. The other two to complete the list were
the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) identified in 2002 in China, and
the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) originated decade after in Saudi
Arabia.
Like MERS and SARS, COVID-19 is a zoonotic virus and believed to be
originated from bats transmitted to humans (Zhou et al., 2020). In comparison
with SARS, MERS, the COVID-19 appears to be less deadly. However, the
World Health Organization (WHO) reported that it has already infected and
killed more people than its predecessors combined. Also, COVID-19 spreads
much faster than SARS and MERS. It only took over a month before it surpassed
the number of cases recorded by the SARS outbreak in 2012. According to
WHO, it only took 67 days from the beginning of the outbreak in China last
December 2019 for the virus to infect the first 100,000 people worldwide (Wor,
2020b). As of the 25th of March 2020, a cumulative total of 372,757 confirmed
cases, while 16,231 deaths have been recorded for COVID-19 by World Health
Organization (Wor, 2020c).
Last 30th of January, WHO characterized COVID-19 as Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEI) and urge countries to put in place strong
measures to detect disease early, isolate and treat cases, trace contacts, and promote social distancing measures commensurate with the risk (Wor, 2020d). In
response, the world implemented its actions to reduce the spread of the virus.
Limitations on mobility, social distancing, and self-quarantine have been applied. Moreover, health institutions advise people to practice good hygiene to
keep from being infected. All these efforts have been made to reduce the transmission rate of the virus.
For the time being, COVID-19 infection is still on the rise. Government
and research institutions scramble to seek antiviral treatment and vaccines to
combat the disease. Several reports list possible drugs combination to apply, yet
it is still unclear which drugs could combat the viral disease and which won’t.
Several mathematical models have been proposed from various epidemiological groups. These models help governments as an early warning device about
the size of the outbreak, how quickly it will spread, and how effective control
measures may be. However, due to the limited emerging understanding of the
new virus and its transmission mechanisms, the results are largely inconsistent
across studies.
In this paper, we will mention a few models and, in the end, to propose
one. Gardner and his team (Gardner, 2020) at Center for Systems Science and
Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, implemented on a previously published
model applied for COVID-19. It is a metapopulation network model represented by a graph with each nodes follows a discrete-time Susceptible-ExposedInfected-Recovered (SEIR) compartmental model. The model gives an estimate
of the expected number of cases in mainland China at the end of January 2020,
2

as well as the global distribution of infected travelers. They believe that the
outbreak began in November 2019 with hundreds of infected already present
in Wuhan last early December 2019. Wu et al. (2020) from WHO Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Control at the University of
Hong Kong presented a modeling study on the nowcast and forecast of the 2019nCoV outbreak at Wuhan. The group used an SEIR metapopulation model to
simulate epidemic and found reproductive number R0 around 2.68 (with 95%
credible interval 2.47-2.86). Imai et al. (2020) estimates R0 around 2.6 with
uncertainty range of 1.5-3.5. Zhao et al. (2020a,b) found R0 to range from 2.24
to 5.71 based on the reporting rate of cases. If the reporting rate increase 2-fold,
R0 = 3.58, if it increase 8-fold, R0 = 2.24. If there is no change in the reporting rate, the estimated R0 is 5.71. Similar to the above authors, Wang et al.
(2020) employed an infectious disease dynamics model (SEIR model) for modeling and predicting the number of COVID-19 cases in Wuhan. They opined that
to reduce R0 significantly, the government should continue implementing strict
measures on containment and public health issues. In the same tune as the
latter, the model of Danchin et al. (2020) also suggests continuing to implement
effective quarantine measures to avoid a resurgence of infection. The model
consists of five (5) compartments: susceptible, infected, alternative infection,
detected, and removed.
Here, we proposed an extension from the classical SEIR model by adding a
compartment of asymptomatic infected. We address the challenge of predicting
the spread of COVID-19 by giving our estimates for the basic reproductive
numbers R0 and its effective reproductive number Reff . Afterward, we also
assess risks and interventions via containment strategy or treatments of exposed
and symptomatic infected.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2, outlines our methodology. Here the model was explained, where the data was taken, and its parameter estimates. Section 3 contained the qualitative analysis for the model. Here,
we give the closed-form equation of reproductive number R0 , then tackling the
best strategy to reduce transmission rates. Finally, section 4 outlines our brief
discussion on some measures to limit the outbreak.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Confirmed and death data
In this study, we used the publicly available dataset of COVID-19 provided
by the Johns Hopkins University (Dong et al., 2020). This dataset includes many
countries’ daily count of confirmed cases, recovered cases, and deaths. Data
can be downloaded from https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/
master/csse_covid_19_data. These data are collected through public health
authorities’ announcements and are directly reported public and unidentified
patient data, so ethical approval is not required.

2.2. Mathematical model
We focus our study on six components of the epidemic flow (Figure 1),
i.e. Susceptible individual (S), Exposed individual (E), Symptomatic Infected
individual (Is ), Asymptomatic Infected individual (Ia ), Under treatment individual (U ), and Removed individual (R). To build the mathematical model,
we followed the standard strategy developed in the literature concerning SIR
model (Diekmann and Heesterbeek, 2000; Brauer and Castillo-Chavez, 2012).
We assumed that susceptible can be infected by exposed, symptomatic infected
as well as asymptomatic infected individuals. We supposed that exposed and
symptomatic infected can be treated without distinguishing quarantine or hospitalization. The dynamics is governed by a system of six ordinary differential
equations (ODE) as follows
S 0 (t)

= −ω (βe E + βs Is + βa Ia )

E 0 (t)

Note that the total living population follows N 0 (t) = −µs Is − µu U , while death
is computed by D0 (t) = µs Is + µu U. We assume that there is no new recruit.
The parameters are described in Table A of Figure 3.
2.3. Parameters estimation
Calibration is made before intervention. Thus it is set νe = νs = 0. The
model is made up of eleven parameters θ = (ω, βe , βs , βa , δe , f, γs , µs , γa , γu , µu )
that need to be determined. Given, for N days, the observations Is,obs (ti ) and

4

Dobs (ti ), the cost function consists of a nonlinear least square function
J(θ) =

N
X
(Is,obs (ti ) − Is (ti , θ))2 + (Dobs (ti ) − D(ti , θ))2 ,
i=1

with constraints θ ≥ 0, and 0 ≤ f ≤ 1. Here Is (ti , θ) and D(ti , θ) denote
output of the mathematical model at time ti computed with the parameters θ.
The optimization problem is solved using Approximate Bayesian Computation
combined with a quasi-Newton method (Csilléry et al., 2010).
3. Results
3.1. Basic and effective reproduction numbers
It is standard to check that the domain
Ω = {(S, E, Is , Ia , U, R) ∈ R6+ ; 0 ≤ S + E + Is + Ia + U + R ≤ N (0)}
is positively invariant. In particular, there exists a unique global in time solution
(S, E, Is , Ia , U, R) in C(R+ ; Ω) as soon as the initial condition lives in Ω.
Since the infected individuals are in E, Ia and Is , the rate of new infections in
each compartment (F) and the rate of other transitions between compartments
(V) can be rewritten as

We deduce as in van den Driessche and Watmough (2000) that the basic reproduction number R0 for the Disease Free Equilibrium (S ∗ , 0, 0, 0, R∗ ), with

This number has an epidemiological meaning. The term δeωβ
+νe represents the
contact rate with exposed during the average latency period 1/(δe + νe ). The
ωf βs
is the contact rate with symptomatic during the average infection
term γs +µ
s +νs
period, and the last one is the part of asymptomatic.
In the subsequent, we write DFE when we mean by Disease Free Equilibrium.

Theorem 3.1. The DFE (S ∗ , 0, 0, 0, R∗ ) is the unique positive equilibrium. Moreover it is globally asymptotically stable.
Proof. By computing the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix, we deduce that
if R0 < 1, then DFE is locally asymptotically stable.
Here we will prove that global asymptotic stability is independent that of
R0 . Indeed, from the last differential equation in our system of ODE, we can
deduce that R is an increasing function bounded by N (0). Thus R(t) converges
to R∗ as t goes to +∞. Then integrating over time this equation provides
Z t
R(t) − R(0) =
γs Is (s) + γa Ia (s) + γu U (s) ds
0

and
R∗ − R(0) = γ

Z

+∞

γs Is (s) + γa Ia (s) + γu U (s) ds,
0

which is finite. Furthermore, Is (t), Ia (t), U (t) also go to 0 as t → +∞ thanks
to the positivity of the solution. Similarly, integrating the third or the fourth
equation in the system gives E(t) →t→+∞ 0. Finally, the first equation points
to the decreasing of S that is bounded by below by 0 and S(t) →t→+∞ S ∗ . 
This theorem means that the asymptotic behavior does not depend on R0 .
For all initial data in Ω, the solution converges to the DFE when time goes to
infinity. Nevertheless, to observe initial exponential growth, R0 > 1 is necessary.
Indeed, S is initially close to N such that infected states are given by the linear
system of differential equations

3.2. Model resolution
To calibrate the model, our simulations start the day of first confirmed infection and finish before interventions to reduce the disease. Therefore νe and
νs are assumed to be equal to 0. We assume that the whole population of the
country is susceptible to the infection. Seven states with comparable populations are chosen. The objective function J is computed to provide a relative
error of order less than 10−2 . In Figure 3, Table A. shows estimated parameters.
The rest of the Figure presents the solution and data. Note that the product
ωβi (i = e, s, a) is uniquely identifiable but not ω and βi separately. Figure 2
represents the effective reproduction number, the fitted symptomatic infected
and death of the posterior distribution.

3.3. Strategy to reduce disease to a given threshold
To temporarily reduce the value of Reff , three strategies regarding different
interventions are being compared. The first one consists in reducing the number
of contacts ω. Full containment is translated by ω = 0, and no containment by
ω = 1. The second strategy is expressed by treatment of symptomatic infected.
It is translated by modifying the value of νs . The treatment of exposed is the
third one. Parameters ω, νe , and νs vary such that intervention is carried out
from 0 to 100% of susceptible, exposed, and symptomatic respectively. Given a
critical infection threshold Tc , the model runs until the time tc such that
E(tc ) + Is (tc ) + Ia (tc ) ≤ Tc .
To juxtapose the benefit of the intervention, we assume that interventions
start 53 days after the first confirmed infection. We remind that the first infection in France was confirmed on January 24th , 2020, and containment begins on
March 17th , 2020. Comparison between three strategies can be found in Table
1 and Figures 4-5. Without intervention to control the disease, the maximum
number of symptomatic infecteds varies from 3.49 × 105 to 2.02 × 107 . The
maximum number of deaths totals from 8.85 × 103 to 7.92 × 106 . We observe
that any intervention strongly reduces the number of dead. Concerning France,
Philippines, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom, when containment is fully
respected and when the sum of infecteds is reduced to 1, the maximum number
of symptomatic infecteds and deaths has been cut sharply, of order 103 . It varies
now from 5.75 × 102 to 7.04 × 104 and 1.94 × 102 to 2.52 × 104 respectively. To
wait from 104 to 407 days is the price to pay. On the contrary, for the states
of Hubei and New York, 53 days to intervene seems to be already too late. We
can also see in Table 1 that treating only the symptomatic does not reduce the
duration
Note that when the intervention ends at time tc , the number of susceptible S(tc )
is large so that the effective reproduction number Reff is larger than 1.
Figure 6 compares the maximum number of dead and symptomatic but infected individuals, as well as the intervention duration, to reach Tc = 1000
varying from 0 to 100%. Containment is the most efficient when it is respected
by more than 76% in France, 63% in the Philippines. Beyond that, treating
the exposed is the best choice. We also observe that the intervention duration
becomes long below 89% in France, 82% in the Philippines. This can be understood by too little susceptibility to achieve recovery but enough for the disease
to persist.

4. Discussion
Without intervention, we observe in Figures 4-5 that the number of susceptible S is decreasing; most of the individuals are recovering, which generates
population immunity. It translates that the disease free equilibrium is globally
asymptotically stable. Nevertheless, the price to pay is high, the number of
deaths being excessive. As presented in Figure 3, the effective reproduction is
decreasing and points out that control has to be done as fast as possible.
The other important information is that, as discovered by Danchin et al.
(2020), an alternative transmission way may occur. Here, it is due to the proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals that is not negligible, as shown in
Table 1.
Finally, with the little knowledge about COVID-19 nowadays, decreasing
transmission, i.e. βe , βs , βa , is the preferred option. The simplest choice consists
in reducing contact between individuals. Table 1 and Figures 4-5-6 show that
total and partial containment do indeed drastically reduce the disease. However,
the duration of containment may be too long and then impracticable especially
if we aim at totally eradicating the infection (Tc = 1). Instead, to stop the
containment as soon as the capacity of the hospitals has been reached could be
privileged. When this criterion is set to 1000 patients (Tc = 1000), the duration
goes from 104 to 39 days for France. A similar reduction in duration is also
obtained for other countries. Again, we see that the earlier the intervention,
the more effective it is. Due to the high number of susceptible, it is worth
noting that the effective reproduction number remains large after containment.
Screening tests, especially to carry out exposed individuals, are then necessary
to be carried out, and the positive individuals are quarantined.
