Abstract
Mathematical models describing SARS-CoV-2 dynamics and the corresponding immune responses in
patients with COVID-19 can be critical to evaluate possible clinical outcomes of antiviral treatments. In
this work, based on the concept of virus spreadability in the host, antiviral effectiveness thresholds are
determined to establish whether or not a treatment will be able to clear the infection. In addition, the
virus dynamic in the host - including the time-to-peak and the final monotonically decreasing behavior - is
chracterized as a function of the treatment initial time. Simulation results, based on nine real patient data,
show the potential clinical benefits of a treatment classification according to patient critical parameters.
This study is aimed at paving the way for the different antivirals being developed to tackle SARS-CoV-2.
Keywords: SARS-CoV-2, In-host model, Dynamic characterization, Antiviral effectiveness.

1. Introduction
With more than 82 million cases confirmed so far (December 2020) in 213 countries [1, 2], coronavirus
disease COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, continues spreading around the globe without neither
effective treatment or vaccine strategy. In fact, the estimated case-fatality rate (CFR) for COVID-19 is about
5.7%, while for the H1N1 pandemic the CFR was less than 1% [3].
Currently, a fully analysis about the potentiality of repurposed antiviral agents (i.e., Chloroquine
and Hydroxychloroquine, Remdesivir, Favipiravir, Lopinavir/Ritonavir, Ribavirin) to ameliorate the viral
spreading in the host are underway [4]. The clinical observations suggest that prophylaxis with approved
doses could prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and reduce viral shedding [5, 6], but these reports suffer from
a number of limitations. For instance, there is no certainty that the undefined benefits are not outweighed
by the acute toxicity of the specific antiviral agents. To overcome this impasse, randomized clinical trials
with adequate potency should be performed [7]. On the other hand, despite some reported dosing recommendation to treat COVID-19 [8, 9], the efficacy of these proposed therapies cannot be guaranteed due to a
paucity of data regarding the optimal dose of the antivirals [10]. In a race to find medical therapies to improve outcomes in patients with COVID-19 further studies are needed to elucidate the benefits of adapting
antiviral agents.
An important strategy to help to find the optimal dose of drugs is the pharmacological modelling based
on in-vitro drug testing. This approach could suggest whenever the prophylaxis with an appropriate doses
of antiviral agents could prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection or control the replication cycle of the virus [11]. In
this regard, recent studies have concentrated on the potential of a quantitative comprehension of COVID-19
dynamics [12, 13, 14, 15]. Within-host mathematical models demonstrated useful insights about SARSCoV-2 infection dynamics and its interactions with the immune system. More important, such results
suggest the potential utility of assessing targets for drug development.
The target cell-limited model, widely used to represent several diseases such as Influenza [16, 17], Ebola
[18], HIV [19, 20], Hepatitis virus [21], among others, has been linked to adjust the viral kinetics in infected
patients with COVID-19 reported by [22]. While a complete analysis of the main dynamic characteristic for
the target cell model was developed to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 infection [23], there is no adequate analysis
of the effects of the existent pharmacological therapy for this model.

The main contribution of this work - that can be seen as an extension of [23] - is to provide a formal
mathematical analysis of the COVID-19 dynamic under the effect of antiviral treatments, which may help
to understand how to schedule the different therapies in function of the host parameters. A quantitative
classification stating whether or not an antiviral will be effective - in terms of its capability to died out
the virus in a reasonable period of time - is made, showing that their effectiveness could vary significantly
between subjects.
After the introduction given in Section 1 the article is organized as follows. Section 2 proposes a general
three-states ”in host” model to represent COVID-19 infection dynamic and formalizes the concept of virus
spreadability. Section 3 characterizes the equilibrium sets of the system, and its asymptotic stability, for the
untreated case (i.e., when no pharmacodynamic is considered), considering the system from the infection
time t = 0. Then, in Section 4, the pharmacodynamic of antivirals is included, to analyze their effectiveness
to avoid the virus to spread in the host. Both, the inhibition effect on the replication rate of the virus and the
inhibition effect on the infection rate of healthy cells are studied. In Section 6, the results of Section 4 are
extensively demonstrated by simulating different treatments scenarios for nine patients from the literature.
Finally, Section 7 gives the discussion of the work, while several mathematical formalism - necessary to
support the main results of article - are given in Appendix 8.
2. Within-Host COVID-19 infection model
Mathematical models of within-host virus dynamic helps to improve the understanding of the interactions that govern infections and permits the human intervention to moderate their effects [24]. Basic models
usually include the cells the pathogen infects, the pathogen particles, and their life cycle [25] and, opposite
to one can expect, they vary little in its structure from one infectious disease to another. Indeed, the well
known target cell-limited models (i.e., models that incorporate the immune response just as a parameter)
was successfully used to represent and control HIV [26, 27, 20], influenza [28, 16, 29, 30], Ebola [18] and
dengue [31, 32], among others. A main distinction between target cell models can be done according to the
virus life cycle [25]: chronic infection models (long-lived and persistent virus in comparison with cells life
cycle) include production and death rates of healthy/susceptible cells, while acute infection models (shortlived virus) only consider the clearance of susceptible cells produced by the infection. This latter - which
was firstly introduced in [16] for the influenza - is used to describe the COVID-19, as it is detailed next.
2.1. Target-cell-limited model
In this paper we consider the following mathematical model [12, 23]:
U̇ (t) = −βU (t)V (t),
U (0) = U0 ,
˙
I(t) = βU (t)V (t) − δI(t),
I(0) = I0 = 0,
V̇ (t) = pI(t) − cV (t),

V (0) = V0 ,

(2.1a)
(2.1b)
(2.1c)

where U (cell), I (cell) and V (copies/mL) represent the uninfected cells, the infected cells, and the virus
concentration. The parameter β (mLday −1 /copies) is the infection rate, δ (day −1 ) is the death rates of I,
p ((copies)/(cellmL)day −1) is the viral replication, and c (day −1 ) is the viral clearance rate. The effects
of immune responses are not explicitly described in this model, but they are implicitly included in the death
rate of infected cells (δ) and the clearance rate of virus (c) [16].
System (2.1) is positive, which means that U (t) ≥ 0, I(t) ≥ 0 and V (t) ≥ 0, for all t ≥ 0. We denote
x(t) := (U (t), I(t), V (t)) the state vector, and
X := {x ∈ R3≥0 },

(2.2)

the state constraints set. Another meaningful set (which is open) is the one consisting in all the states in X
with strictly positive amount of virus and susceptible cells, i.e.,
X := {x ∈ X : U > 0, V > 0}.

(2.3)

The initial conditions of (2.1), which represent a healthy steady state before the infection, are assumed
to be V (t) = 0, I(t) = 0, and U (t) = U0 > 0, for t < 0. Then, at time t = 0, a small quantity of virions
enters the host body and, so, a discontinuity occurs in V (t). Indeed, V (t) jumps from 0 to a small positive
2

value V0 at t = 0 (formally, V (t) has a discontinuity of the first kind at t0 , i.e., limt→0− V (t) = 0 while
limt→0+ V (t) = V0 > 0). This way, for the time after the infection, the virus may spread or being clear
depending on its infection effectiveness. To properly determine what such a spread means, the following
(mathematical) definition is given
Definition 1 (Spreadability of the virus in the host). Consider system (2.1), constrained by the positive set
X, with V (t) = 0, I(t) = 0, and U (t) = U0 > 0, for t < 0. Consider also that at time t = 0, V (t) jumps
from 0 to a small positive value V0 . Then, it is said that the virus spreads (in some degree) in the host for
t ≥ 0 if V̇ (t) > 0 for some t > 0. If the virus does not spread in the host, it is said that it is cleared for
t ≥ 0.
Definition 1 states that the virus spreads in the host, for t ≥ 0, if V (t) increases at some time t > 0, and
so, given that limt→∞ V (t) = 0 (as it is stated later on in the article), it reaches at least one local maximum
at some positive time. On the other hand, the virus is cleared for t ≥ 0 if V (t) is strictly decreasing for all
t > 0, which means that V (t) has neither local minima nor local maxima at any t > 0 (latter on it is stated
that V (t) has at most one minimum and one maximum). An infectious disease can be related to the virus
peak and/or the period of permanence of the virus in the host [18], and both effects are related to an increase
of the virus load at some time after the infection. This is the reason why the spreadability is defined based
on the virus positive derivative. A second reason supporting Definition 1 is its use in the determination of
antiviral effectiveness (Section 4). Antivirals able to clear the virus can be considered effective.
Remark 1. Note that the virus spreadability may or may not imply a severe infection (a disease that
eventually causes the host symptoms) depending on the value of the virus peak and the time the virus
remains in the host. The non-spreadability of the virus, however, does imply that the infection is controlled.
In what follows, time t = 0 will be considered as the infection time, i.e., the time when a small amount
of virus enters the host.
2.2. Reproduction number and critical value for the target cells
To formally establish conditions under which the virus does or does not spread for t > 0, some basic
concepts need to be defined. The first one is the well-known basic reproduction number.
Definition 2. The within-host basic reproduction number R is defined as the number of infected cells (or
virus particles) that are produced by one infected cell (or virus particle), over a course of its life-span. Its
mathematical expression is given by:
R(t) := U (t)

βp
.
cδ

(2.4)

Particularly, for t = 0, this number describes the number of virus particles produced by a virus particle
when a small amount of virus, V0 , is introduced into a healthy stationary population of uninfected target
cells, U0 ,
R0 := U0

βp
.
cδ

(2.5)

A second number, which is closely related to the first one, is the critical value for the susceptible cells
such that the virus starts to decrease.
Definition 3. The critical number of susceptible cells U , Uc , is defined as
Uc :=

cδ
,
pβ

(2.6)

which for fixed system parameters β, p, δ and c is a constant.
Note that U (t) < Uc if and only if R(t) < 1, for every t ≥ 0. The basic reproduction number R(t) and
the critical number Uc completely describe dynamic (2.1), as it is shown in the next sections.

3. Dynamical analysis for the untreated infection
In this section, the infection evolution from the beginning (time t = 0) is considered without antiviral
treatments. A detailed analysis of the dynamical behaviour will help us to properly understand, in next
sections, the antivirals effects.
3.1. Equilibrium set characterization and stability
By equaling U̇ , I˙ and V̇ to zero, in (2.1), it can be shown that the system only has free virus equilibrium
of the form xs = (Us , 0, 0), with Us being an arbitrary positive value, i.e., Us ∈ [0, ∞). Thus, there is only
one equilibrium set, which is a healthy one, and it is defined by
Xs := {(U, I, V ) ∈ R3 : U ∈ [0, ∞), I = 0, V = 0}.

(3.1)

According to [23], set Xs can be partitioned in two subsets,
Xs1 := {(U, I, V ) ∈ R3 : U ∈ [0, Uc ), I = 0, V = 0}

(3.2)

Xs2 := {(U, I, V ) ∈ R3 : U ∈ [Uc , ∞), I = 0, V = 0}

(3.3)

and

being Xs1 asymptotically stable and Xs2 unstable, as stated in the next theorem.
Theorem 3.1 (Asymptotic stability). Consider system (2.1) constrained by the positive set X. Then, the set
Xs1 defined in (3.2) is the smallest asymptotically stable (AS) equilibrium set, with a domain of attraction
given by X .
Proof: The proof is given in [23], Theorem 3.3. 
Theorem 3.1 establishes that neither single equilibrium points xs ∈ Xs1 nor subsets of Xs1 are AS.
Furthermore, any trajectory starting at non-equilibrium states tends to a state in Xs1 , which depends on the
initial conditions. This has critical implications on the controllability of the system, provided that Xs1 is
the minimal formal equilibrium target set to be used in a control strategy (based, for instance, on antiviral
treatments).
Furthermore, as stated in [23], if we define U∞ = limt→∞ U (t), I∞ = limt→∞ I(t) and V∞ =
limt→∞ V (t), then, I∞ = 0, V∞ = 0, and
U∞ = −Uc W (−R0 e−(R0 +K0 ) ),

(3.4)

β p
where W (·) is the Lambert function, and R0 = U0 βp
cδ and K0 = c ( δ I0 − V0 ) are constants depending
on the initial conditions. Given that W (−R0 e−(R0 +K0 ) ) ∈ (0, 1) for positive values of R0 and K0 , this
means that the only state that does not necessarily converge to zero, i.e. U , converges to a value smaller
than Uc , which depends on U0 , I0 , V0 . See [23] for further details.

3.2. System behavior
The general behavior of system (2.1) can be analyzed according to the initial conditions and parameter
values. Property 1, next, shows some general characteristics of the susceptible cells as time goes to infinity
([23]).
Property 1. Consider system (2.1), constrained by the positive set X, at the beginning of the infection, i.e.,
U (0) = U0 > 0, I(0) = 0 and V (0) = V0 > 0 (i.e., x(0) = (U (0), I(0), V (0)) ∈ X ). Consider also that
V0 is small enough. Then,
i. U∞ → 0 when U0 → ∞ or U0 → 0.
ii. U∞ → Uc when U0 → Uc .
iii. 0 < U∞ (U0,1 , I0 , V0 ) < U∞ (U0,2 , I0 , V0 ) < Uc , for initial conditions U0,1 < U0,2 < Uc .
iv. 0 < U∞ (U0,2 , I0 , V0 ) < U∞ (U0,1 , I0 , V0 ) < Uc , for initial conditions Uc < U0,1 < U0,2 .
4

Proof: The proof - which is given in [23], Property 2 - follows from the fact that K0 ≈ 0 for the selected
initial conditions, and, so, according to (3.4), U∞ ≈ −Uc W (−R0 e−R0 ).
Figure 1 shows a phase portrait of system (2.1), with parameters β = 0.5, δ = 0.2, p = 2 and c = 5,
which provide Uc = 1. As it can be seen, every initial state, even those that are close to the axes (U, 0, 0)
with large values of U , tends to Xs1 as t → ∞. The following theorem characterizes the whole dynamic of
system (2.1) from the start of the infection, in terms of the variables peaks.
Theorem 3.2 (Virus behavior from the infection time). Consider system (2.1), constrained by the positive
set X, at the beginning of the infection, i.e., U (0) = U0 > 0, I(0) = 0 and V (0) = V0 > 0 (i.e.,
x(0) = (U (0), I(0), V (0)) ∈ X ). If the virus spreads (according to Definition 1), then R0 > 1 + α(0),
for some α(0) > 0 (or, the same, U0 > Uc ) and there exist positive times ťV , t̂I , tc and t̂V , such that
ťV < t̂I < tc < t̂V , where ťV and t̂V are the times at which V (t) reaches a local minimum and a local
maximum, respectively, t̂I is the time at which I(t) reaches a local maximum, and tc is the time at which
U (t) reaches Uc . Furthermore, V̇ (t) < 0 for all t > t̂V .
Proof: The proof is given in [23], Theorem 4.1.
Remark 2. Function α(t), t ≥ 0, can be thought as a correction factor of the reproduction number R(t),
necessary to understand and characterize the threshold over which the virus spreads in the host. As it is
shown in [23], Remark 5, this function cannot be explicitly defined but may be computed numerically. In
general, for real patient data, it takes small values when the virus load is small (particularly, at time t = 0),
and becomes significant only when the virus approaches its peak, at t̂V . Given that in most of the interesting
situations (i.e., at the beginning of the infection or when an antiviral is administered before the virus peak)
its effect is negligible, α(t) will not be considered in the computation of critical values for the treatments.
Remark 3. Note that from Theorem 3.2, it follows that a sufficient condition (not necessary) for the virus
not to spread in the host at time t > 0 is given by R0 < 1 (or, the same, U (0) < Uc ). This condition,
adapted for the time an antiviral treatments is initiated, will serve in the next section to determine their
effectiveness.
Next, a Remark concerning a particularity of Theorem 3.2 is introduced, which may help to approximately determine when the maximum of the virus load occurs.
Remark 4. Consider that the assumptions of Theorem 3.2 hold. If the virus clearance is significantly faster
than the infected cell death (c >> δ), as it is usually the case (see [15], Equation (4), [33], [34], [35]) the
three-states system (2.1) can be approximated by the following two-state equations:
U̇ (t) ≈ −βU (t)V (t),
U (0) = U0 ,
pβ
U (t)V (t) − δV (t),
V (0) = V0 ,
V̇ (t) ≈
c

(3.5a)
(3.5b)

where the infected cell state is given by I(t) ≈ pc V (t). Note that equation (3.5.b) can be written as
V̇ (t) = (R(t) − 1)δV (t). Then, according to Theorem 3.2, it is easy to see that t̂V → tc from the right
and t̂I → tc from the left when (c/δ) → ∞, i.e., the peaks of V and I tend to occur simultaneously, at time
tc . Figure 1 shows a phase portrait of system (2.1) with a rather unrealistic parameter values ( β = 0.5,
δ = 0.2, p = 2 and c = 5) but useful to exemplify how, after a relatively short time (and provided that
c > δ), the system reaches the manifold defined by the condition I(t) = pc V (t). This behavior can also be
seen in the time-behavior plot in Figure 2.
Figure 2 shows U (t), I(t), V (t) and R(t) time evolution, for β = 0.5, δ = 0.2, p = 2 and c = 5, and
initial conditions such that R0 > 1 + α(0) and R0 < 1 + α(0) (with α(0) ≈ 0). As it can be seen, the
results in Theorem 3.2 and Remarks 4 and 3 are confirmed by the simulations. All these results are also
confirmed by the nine real patients identified and simulated in Section 5 and 6 (see, particularly, Table 2
and Figure 5).
4. Antiviral Treatments
The goal of this section is to formally consider the effect of antivirals into system (2.1) to obtain a
controlled system, i.e. a system with certain control actions - given by the antivirals - that allows one

conditions not necessarily representing realistic cases. Empty circles represent the initial state, while solid circles
represent final states. The red hyperplane corresponds to U (t) ≡ Uc (i.e., the critical value of U , when R(t) = 1) while
the blue hyperplane corresponds to the fast manifold in which I(t) and V (t) are proportional (.i.e, I(t) = c/pV (t)).
Note that only the initial states with U0 > Uc = 1 corresponds to scenarios with R0 > 1.

(second row). The firs row corresponds to the case R0 > 1 + α(0), while the second one corresponds to the case
R0 < 1 + α(0) (with α(0) being approximately zero). In the first case, the minimum of V (t) occurs at ťV = 0.85, the
maximum of I occurs at t̂I = 14.86, U (t) crosses 1 at tc = 14.87 and the maximum of V (t) occurs at t̂V = 15.08,
which confirms both, the results in Theorem 4.1 and Remark 4. In the second case, both I(t) and V (t) are strictly
decreasing and U (t) remains almost constants, which confirms the results in Theorem 4.1 and Remark 3.

to (even partially) modified the whole system dynamic according to some control objectives. Antivirals
have the potential to inhibit the virus replication, reducing the advance of the infection over the target cells
of infected host (i.e.: epithelial cells in the respiratory tract for H1N1 [16]). Several antivirals are being
tested for COVID-19 treatment, with different results concerning both, their inhibition effect on the virus
replication and their toxicity. Among them, Remdesivir, Favipiravir, Umifenovir, Chloroquine, Oseltamivir,
etc. [36, 10, 37, 38, 39] can be mentioned. The antiviral effect can be modeled as a reduction of the virus
infectivity in the presence of inhibitors (by reducing the infection rate β) and/or as a reduction in the
replication of infectious virions (by reducing the replication rate p) [4, 15]. In any case, the effectiveness
of a treatment is limited and depends on the patient parameters (which in turn depends on his/her clinical
state). Next, two different inhibition effects ηβ (t) and ηp (t) are considered, one affecting the infection
rate β and the other affecting the replication rate p. It is assumed that the virus spreads in the host from
the infection time t = 0, i.e., V (t) reaches a maximum at some time t̂V if no treatment is initiated. The
controlled system (i.e., the system considering antiviral treatment) can be written as:
U̇ (t) = −β(1 − ηβ (t))U (t)V (t),
˙ = β(1 − ηβ (t))U (t)V (t) − δI(t),
I(t)
V̇ (t) = p(1 − ηp (t))I(t) − cV (t),

U (0) = U0 ,

(4.1a)

I(0) = I0 ,

(4.1b)

V (0) = V0 ,

(4.1c)

where ηβ (t) ∈ [0, 1) and ηp (t) ∈ [0, 1) are assumed to jump from 0 to the new value ηβ and ηp at the
treatment time ttr (i.e., the pharmacokinetic of the antivirals is assumed to have time constants significantly
smaller than the ones of system (2.1), and, so, it is neglected)

being ηβ ∈ [0, 1) and ηp ∈ [0, 1) constant values representing the full inhibition treatment effect. The
treatment time ttr is assumed to be between the minimum and maximum time of V , i.e., ťV < ttr < t̂V
(although some simulations are performed for ttr > t̂V ). The full antiviral effect ηp and ηβ are limited by
the inhibitory potential of the drug (expressed in terms of EC50 , or drug concentration for inhibiting 50% of
antigen particles) and its cytotoxic effect (expressed in terms of IC50 , or drug concentration which causes
death to 50% of susceptible cells) [38, 40].
As the antiviral treatment reduces the system parameter in some amount, it will quantitatively modify
the virus behavior. Particularly, the virus peak time will be modified from t̂V (untreated patient case) to
t̂V,tr (treated patient case). However, given that the treatment is initiated when the virus is increasing
(i.e., between ťV and t̂V ), then the new peak will occur at the same time or after the treatment time, i.e.,
t̂V,tr ≥ ttr . This way, even when the virus peak will always be smaller with a treatment (smaller peaks
are obtained for smaller values of p and β), the time at which this peak takes place can be smaller or
greater than the one without any treatment. This effect, usually disregarded in many studies concerning the
effectiveness of antivirals, could be critical to define whether or not a given antiviral is able to impede a
severe disease. Indeed, in some cases, antivirals significantly delay the virus peaks, largely increasing the
time of permanence of the virus in the host. In order to qualitatively assess antiviral effectiveness according
to the time of the virus peak, the following classification is made:
Definition 4 (Antiviral treatment effectiveness). Consider system (4.1), constrained by the positive set X,
such that the virus spreads in the host from time t = 0, which implies that: U (0) > Uc , I(0) = 0 and
V (0) > 0. Consider also that, at time ttr , with ťV < ttr < t̂V , an antiviral treatment is initiated such that
ηp (t) and/or ηβ (t) jump from 0 to ηp ∈ [0, 1) and/or ηβ ∈ [0, 1), respectively (as stated in (4.2)). Then,
the treatment is said to be effective if the virus peaks at a time t̂V,tr < t̂V , being the latter the virus peak
time for the untreated virus evolution (i.e., when ηp = ηβ = 0). Otherwise, if t̂V,tr ≥ t̂V , it is said that the
treatment is ineffective.
Definition 4 is closely related to the capacity of the antiviral drug to clear the virus infection (or, the
same, cutting off its spread) in such a way that it could: a) decline the viral grow at the treatment time,
and, so, the virus eradication starts when the therapy is initiated, or b) hasten the virus peak, and, so, even
though the virus eradication is not started at treatment time, it begins prior to the untreated case. Note also
that Definition 4 accounts for three typical antiviral effect metrics: the area under the virus curve (AUC)
and the duration of infection (DI) [41], in a direct way, and the difference of viral loads at the time-to-peak
∆V [13], in an indirect way.

4.1. Antiviral effectiveness characterization
In this subsection it is shown that the effectiveness of antivirals depends on weather ηp and/or ηβ are
greater or smaller than a specified threshold, which is a function of the parameters and the time of the
treatment initiation. In order to characterize such thresholds, the within-host basic reproduction number R
at treatment time ttr is computed as follows:
R(ttr ) =

U (ttr )p(1 − ηp )β(1 − ηβ )
,
cδ

(4.3)

where ťV < ttr < t̂V . The critical values of ηp and ηβ are the ones that make R(ttr ) = 1, i.e.:
ηpc (ttr )
ηβc (ttr )

cδ
U (ttr )βp
cδ
:= 1 −
= ηpc (ttr ).
U (ttr )βp
:= 1 −

(4.4)
(4.5)

From equations 4.4 and 4.5 it can be inferred that ηpc (ttr ) and ηβc (ttr ) are increasing functions of U (ttr ).
Figure 3 shows the time behavior of ηpc (ttr ) for the nine COVID-19 patients identified in Section 5. Note
that ηpc (ttr ) ≈ 1 − cδ/(U0 βp) for ttr → t0 and ηpc (ttr ) ≈ 1 − cδ/(Uc βp) = 0 for ttr → t̂V (tc ≈
t̂V ). Similar results concerning the critical drug efficacy with respect to the availability of target cells at
the treatment time were reached in [42], for acute models, although the authors focused the analysis on
treatment starting at the beginning of the infection.

Figure 3: ηpc (ttr ) vs ttr corresponding to the nine patients simulated in Section 5

The following theorem determines the effectiveness of antivirals in terms of ηpc (ttr ) and ηβc (ttr ), by
considering them separately. In the next subsection, the combined effect will be studied.
Theorem 4.1. Consider system (4.1), constrained by the positive set X. Consider that the virus spreads in
the host for t ≥ 0, which implies that: U (0) > Uc , I(0) = 0 and V (0) > 0. Consider also that, at time
ttr , with ťV < ttr < t̂V (when the virus is increasing), an antiviral treatment is initiated such that ηp (t) or
ηβ (t) jumps from 0 to ηp ∈ [0, 1) or ηβ ∈ [0, 1), respectively (as stated in (4.2)). Then,
i. if the inhibition effect is such that ηp > ηpc (ttr ) (or ηβ > ηβc (ttr )) then the maximum of V (t) occurs
at ttr , which is smaller than t̂V by hypothesis. In this case the antiviral treatment is effective.
ii. for two antiviral treatment, 1 and 2, with inhibition effects ηp1 , ηp2 such that ηpc (ttr ) < ηp1 < ηp2 (or two
inhibition effects ηβ1 , ηβ2 such that ηβc (ttr ) < ηβ1 < ηβ2 ), there exist a time t∗ > ttr (large enough) such
8

that V2 (t) < V1 (t), for all t ∈ (ttr , t∗ ], being V1 (t) and V2 (t) the virus corresponding to treatments
ηp1 and ηp2 , respectively. In this case both treatments are effective, and treatment 2 is more efficient
than treatment 1.
iii. if the inhibition effect is such that ηp < ηpc (ttr ) (or ηβ < ηβc (ttr )), then the virus reaches a maximum
at a time t̂V,tr > ttr . Furthermore, there exists a time te = te (ηp , ttr ) - denoted as early treatment
time - such that t̂V,tr > t̂V for ttr ∈ (ťV , te ]. In this case the antiviral treatment is ineffective.
iv. for two antiviral treatment, 1 and 2, with inhibition effects ηp1 , ηp2 such that ηp1 < ηp2 < ηpc (ttr )
with ttr ∈ (ťV , te (ηp , ttr )] (or for two inhibition effects ηβ1 , ηβ2 such that ηβ1 < ηβ2 < ηβc (ttr )), it is
t̂2V,tr > t̂1V,tr > t̂V , being t̂1V,tr and t̂2V,tr the virus maximum time corresponding to treatments ηp1 and
ηp2 , respectively. In this case both treatments are ineffective, but treatment 1 is more efficient than
treatment 2, which is a rather counter-intuitive fact.
Sketch of Proof: For the sake of simplicity and clarity the proof is based on the approximation of system
(2.1) described in Remark 4. In such a case, system (2.1) is approximated by U̇ (t) = −βU (t)V (t),
V̇ (t) ≈ (R(t) − 1)δV (t) and I(t) ≈ pc V (t). Only antiviral treatments affecting parameter p is considered,
since the results follows from conditions on R(t) and parameters β and p affect R in the same way.
i. Since ťV < ttr < t̂V (by hypothesis) and t̂V ≈ tc , then by Theorem 3.2, R(t) > 1 for t < ttr . Given
that ηp > ηpc (ttr ), then by (4.3) R(t) jumps to a value smaller than one at ttr , i.e., R(t−
tr ) > 1 and
− R(t)). Given that U (t) is strictly decreasing, R(t) < 1 for
R(ttr ) < 1 (where R(t−
)
:=
lim
tr
t→t
tr

t > ttr . From equation V̇ (t) ≈ (R(t) − 1)δV (t), it follows that V̇ (t) < 0 for all t > ttr . So, given
that is assumed that V (t) is increasing when the treatment is initiated, its maximum occurs at ttr .

ii. Let us consider that for all t ≥ ttr , Vi (t) and Ui (t) are the virus and the susceptible cells for treatment
Ui (t)(1−η i )pβ

with U1 (ttr ) =
i = 1, 2, i.e., the treatment under the inhibition effect ηpi , and Ri (t) =

U2 (ttr ) and V1 (ttr ) = V2 (ttr ). By hypothesis ηp (ttr ) < ηp < ηp , then R2 (ttr ) < R1 (ttr ) and
Ri (t) < 1 for all t ≥ ttr and i = 1, 2. Since Ui (t) is a continuous function for i = 1, 2, there
is a positive time t∗ > ttr such that R2 (t) < R1 (t) for all t ∈ [ttr , t∗ ]. From equation V̇i (t) ≈
(Ri (t) − 1)δVi (t) it follows that V̇2 (t) < V̇1 (t) < 0 for all t ∈ (ttr , t∗ ] (note that V̇ is not defined on
ttr ). As it is shown in Section 6.1, for real data patients, t∗ is large enough such that V (t∗ ) ≈ 0.

iii. Since ťV < ttr < t̂V (by hypothesis) and t̂V ≈ tc , then by Theorem 3.2, R(t) > 1 for t < ttr .

fact that R(ttr ) > 1, it follows that V̇ (ttr ) > 0, and given that R(t) is decreasing for t > ttr , there
exists a time t̂V,tr > ttr such that R(t̂V,tr ) = 1, in which case, it is

This means that V (t) reaches a maximum at time t̂V,tr > ttr . Now, we need to prove that there
exist a time te (ηp , ttr ) such that for ttr ∈ (ťV , te ) it is t̂V,tr > t̂V . According to Lemma 1, there
exists a time te = te (ηp , ttr ), smaller than t̂V , such that for a treatment time ttr ∈ (ťV , te ], t̂V,tr is
a decreasing function of R(ttr ), for R(ttr ) > 1. This implies that smaller values of R(ttr ) (greater
values of ηp ) correspond to larger times at which R(t), t > ttr , reaches 1, i.e., smaller values of
−
R(ttr ), correspond to larger values of t̂V,tr . So, from the fact that R(t−
tr ) > R(ttr ) (being R(ttr )
the value of R at ttr if no treatment is applied), it follows that t̂V,tr > t̂V > ttr , for ttr ∈ (ťV , te ].
As it is shown in Sections 6.1 and 6.2, for real data patients, (the maximal) te is close to t̂V .
iv. Since ηp1 < ηp2 < ηpc (ttr ), by hypothesis, then 1 < R2 (ttr ) < R1 (ttr ), being R1 (ttr ) =

and R2 (ttr ) =

corresponding to ηp1 and ηp2 , respectively. 

Remark 5. According to Theorem 3.2, R(ttr ) should be compared to 1 + α(ttr ), not to 1, to obtain ηpc (ttr )
and ηβc (ttr ). However, as stated in Remark 2, the correction factor α(ttr ) is significantly smaller than 1 for
the considered period of time (when ttr is smaller than t̂V ), so it was disregarded for the sake of simplicity.
The effect of α(ttr ) may be significant only for ttr close to t̂V and, in such case, the viral dynamic can be
slightly different from the one prescribed by Theorem 4.1 (and Lemma 1).
Remark 6. Item (iii) of Theorem 4.1 establishes just the existence of te > ťV such that for treatments
starting at ttr ∈ (ťV , te ], the new virus peak time is larger than the one corresponding to the untreated
case, i.e., t̂V,tr > t̂V . However, it should be noted that for parameters coming from real patient data, (the
maximal) te is indeed close to t̂V . This means that the time period where treatments can be ineffective is in
most of the cases similar to (ťV , t̂V ), i.e., similar to the time period where the virus is growing. Figures in
Section 6 confirm this fact.
A main consequence of item (iii) of Theorem 4.1 is that early treatments, if no effective, are largely
more dangerous than late ones. Another critical point to be remarked is that when an early treatment is
not strong enough to avoid the virus spreadability right after ttr , the greater the antiviral effectiveness ηp
(or ηβ ) is, the more is the time the virus remains in the host, since the maximum time t̂V,tr is delayed, as
established in item (iv). As a result, antivirals could be detrimental as treated patients would need to be
isolated for larger periods of time than untreated ones.
Note that even when virus peak time can be delayed for some treatments, the virus peak will be always
smaller than the one without any treatment. Furthermore, the fraction of dead cells at the end of the infection
(D) will be always greater if no antiviral is administrated. Since D = 1 − U∞/U (ttr ), if we consider initial
conditions at treatment time in equation 3.4, and being Uctr = U (ttr )/R(ttr ), it results
D =1+

W (−R(ttr )e−(R(ttr )+K(ttr )) )
,
R(ttr )

(4.8)

where K(ttr ) = βc ( δ p I(ttr ) − V (ttr )) = R(ttr )I(ttr ) − βc V (ttr ) and W (·) is the Lambert function (W (·) = Wp (·), see [23]). Consequently, if treatment is started early, such that R(ttr ) ≫ K(ttr ),

then the fraction of dead cells can be approximated as D = 1 +

−R(ttr )

W (−R(ttr )e−R(ttr ) )
,
R(ttr )

which is equal

to 0 if R(ttr ) ≤ 1. Note that, by definition, W (−R(ttr )e
) = −R(ttr ) for R(ttr ) ≤ 1, so
D = 1 + (−R(ttr )/R(ttr )) = 0. On the other hand, if R(ttr ) > 1 then W (−R(ttr )e−R(ttr ) ) ∈ (−1, 0]
is monotonically increasing with R(ttr ) (see Figure 1, [23]). Hence, the fraction of dead cells at the end of
infection is a monotonically increasing function of R(ttr ), for R(ttr ) > 1. Moreover, as the treatment time
is delayed, K(ttr ) grows, being D a monotonically increasing function of R(ttr ), even for R(ttr ) ≤ 1.
4.2. Antiviral effectiveness considering the combined effect on ηβ and ηp
Theorem 4.1 describes the behavior of the virus under the effect of an inhibitor reducing the infection
rate β or the replication rate p. If both effects (ηβ and ηp ) are simultaneously included in the model, it can
be computed a region - in the ηβ , ηp space - for which condition R(ttr ) < 1 is fulfilled. This way, instead
of independent critical values ηβc (ttr ) and ηpc (ttr ) corresponding to each parameter, there is an entire set of
critical combinations that makes a treatment effective. This set depends on treatment time ttr and is placed
on the boundary of the effective set
Hc (ttr ) := {(ηβ , ηp ) ∈ [0, 1] × [0, 1] : ηp > 1 −

cδ
}.
U (ttr )βp(1 − ηβ )

(4.9)

Clearly, every pair (ηβ , ηp ) ∈ Hc (ttr ) fulfills condition R(ttr ) < 1 and, reciprocally, every pair
(ηβ , ηp ) ∈
/ Hc (ttr ) fulfills condition R(ttr ) > 1. Figure 4 shows a plot of set Hc (ttr ) in the plane
(ηβ × ηp ), corresponding to parameters β = 0.5, δ = 0.2, p = 2 and c = 5, with U (ttr ) = 3.

10

Figure 4: Hc (ttr ) is given by the yellow and the blue regions, considering the following system parameters: β = 0.5, δ = 0.2,
p = 2 and c = 5, with U (ttr ) = 3. The critical boundary of Hc (ttr ) represents the critical pairs of ηβ and ηp .

As it can be seen, for every inhibition effect pair (ηβ , ηp ) 6∈ Hc (ttr ) (i.e. a point inside the red region in
Figure 4) the antiviral treatment is ineffective. On the other hand, as it is shown in Theorem 4.1, for every
pair (ηβ , ηp ) such that ηβ > ηβc (ttr ) or ηp > ηpc (ttr ) (the yellow region in Figure 4) the antiviral treatment
is effective. Finally, for pairs in the region inside Hc (ttr ) with ηβ < ηβc (ttr ) and ηp < ηpc (ttr ) (which does
not fit conditions in Theorem 4.1 and it is represented by the blue region in Figure 4) the antiviral treatment
is still effective.
5. Within-Host Modeling of COVID-19
In this section, the parameters of model (2.1) are estimated using viral load data of 9 RT-PCR COVID19 positive patients, labeled as A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H and I, reported by Woelfel et. al. [22]. We follow a similar
procedure as in Vargas et. al. [12]. Since the viral load is measured in Log10 scales, the model fitting was
fulfilled by minimizing the root mean squared of logarithmic error (RMSLE), denoted as:
v
u n
u1 X
RM SLE = t
(log(yi ) − log(ȳi ))2 ,
(5.1)
n i=1
where n is the number of measurements, yi the model predictive output, and ȳi the experimental measurement. Since the minimization of 5.1 implies a nonlinear optimization problem, with highly dependence on
initial conditions, the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm [43, 24] is employed as a global optimization
algorithm, which has shown to be robust to initial guesses of parameters [44].
Even though it is still debatable which compartments SARS-CoV-2 can infect, there is a common agreement that the viral shedding take places mainly in the respiratory epithelial cells (due to the high expression
of ACE2) with direct viral toxicity of the infected cells [45]. Therefore, following previous works of mathematical modelling for influenza infection in humans, the value of U0 is taken as about 4 × 108 cells for all
patients [16]. Furthermore, I0 is assumed to be 0 and V0 was estimated (using a regression model, since
the viral at the day of infection was not provided) [12] to be about 0.31 Copies/mL. Moreover, in order to
avoid identifiability problems related with the fact that only viral titters are used to fit the model, the viral
clearance parameter (c) was set in 2.4 1/day, which is in accordance with previous estimates for influenza
and HIV [46, 16]. The parameters and initial condition (at the time of infection t = 0) of each patient
are collected in Table 1. Since the viral load was measured after the onset of the symptoms, an incubation
period of 7 days post infection (dpo) was assumed for the time of infection, according to [12].

The time evolution of U , I and V is shown in Figure 5, for each patient. As it can be seen, the plot
confirms the results in Theorem 3.2 concerning the minimum and maximum times of V , the maximum time
of I and the time when U reaches Uc (i.e., when R(t) reaches 1). Figure 5 also confirms the approximation
made in Remark 4, by showing that virus and infected cell peaks occur approximately at the same time at
which U reaches Uc . All these time values, together with the values of Uc (the critical target cell value),
U∞ (the final value of U , when the virus is died out), R0 and the virus maximum are shown in Table 2, for
the nine simulated patients.

are the times at which V (t) reaches a local minimum and a local maximum, respectively, t̂I is the time at which I(t)
reaches a local maximum, and tc is the time at which U (t) reaches Uc . Furthermore, as stated in Remark 4, ťV ≈ 0
and t̂I ≈ tc ≈ t̂V . Vundet = 50 (Copies/mL) stands for the undetectable level of the virus load.

Remark 7. In comparison with other coronavirus diseases, such as MERS and SARS, where the virus load
peak takes place after the onset of symptoms (7 − 10 days post infection) [47], for SARS-CoV-2 infection
it is not clear the temporal interval where the viral load reaches a peak. A recent study linking epidemiological and viral load data, suggests that the viral load peak occurs during the day of symptom onset [47].
However, observation of viral load in infected macaques [48, 49] denotes that the viral peak from nose and
throat swabs happens during the 1-3 days post infection. Therefore, since the target cell model fitting was
conducted using SARS-CoV-2 viral load measured after the onset of the symptoms [22], the estimated timeto-peak (t̂V ) in Table 2 is subject to practical identifiability problems, which as was indicated in Theorem
4.1 and will be shown in Section 6, is a main parameter to evaluate antiviral effectiveness. Due to this
reason, an uncertainty analysis computing the likelihood-based confidence intervals [50] for each parameter was done. In Figure 6 such analysis is shown for the 95% confidence interval of parameter p, where it
can be seen the high degree of uncertainty in the estimated t̂V for patients A, C, F and G (approximately 5
days).

6. Simulation Results
To evaluate the results concerning the antiviral treatment effectiveness, several simulations involving the
nine patients introduced in Section 5 were performed. First, the virus spreading interval - the time between
the estimated day of infection (7 dpo) and the time-to-peak of viral load (t̂V ) - will be considered in Section
6.1, to assess the results of Theorem 4.1. Due to the reported variability on the estimated time-to-peak
(Figure 6), we decided to initialize the treatments taking into account the relative time with respect to the
estimated t̂V , instead of a fixed time for all the population. Furthermore, the (maximal) early treatment time
(te ) of each patient was computed numerically, being of the order of 0.77 [0.74, 0.79]t̂V .
Then, in Section 6.2 the case when the antiviral therapy is started before and after the untreated timeto-peak t̂V is simulated, in order to analyze the sub-potent/potent drug efficacy as treatment time ttr is
delayed. Finally, in Section 6.3 the synergistic effects of antiviral therapies blocking the viral replication
p and the host cell infection β are studied, taking into account the combined drug effect analysis made in
Section 4.2.
To numerically assess the viral kinetics evolution the following infected-related metrics are employed:
i) the difference of viral loads with and without treatment at time-to-peak, ∆V = V (t̂V ) − V (t̂V,tr ), which
is a measure of the viral reduction at time-to-peak respect to the untreated case [13]; ii) the duration of
infection, DI, defined as the time spent by the viral titer curve over a detection limit of 100 copies/ml,
which is a measure of the viral shedding interval, and iii) the time-to-peak t̂V , which is an indicator of the
viral replication rate. For the sake of simplicity, unless otherwise stated, the approximation of system (2.1)
presented in Remark 4 is used for simulations.
6.1. Treatment initiated at different times, during viral spreading interval (ttr ∈ (ťV , t̂V ))
Scenario 1: Treatment is initiated at viral load detection level (ttr = tDL )
Figure 7 shows the simulated virus load evolution corresponding to each of the nine patients, when
the antiviral therapy is started at the first positive PCR test day (ttr = tDL , being tDL the time at which
the virus reaches the value DL = 100 copies/mL), which is about 0.3t̂V ≈ 0.40te . Consequently, all the
patients fall in the case ťV < ttr < te < t̂V which means that we are under the hypothesis of Theorem
4.1 and, furthermore, the treatment time belongs to the early treatment time interval. To properly asses the
antiviral replication inhibition effect, increasing values of ηp were used. First we started with small values
of ηp , fulfilling the condition ηp < ηpc (ttr ) (item iii in Theorem 4.1, ineffective treatment). Then ηp was
set to a value equal to ηpc (ttr ), to reinforce the counter-intuitive fact that larger inhibition effects fulfilling
ηp < ηpc (ttr ) produce larger virus peak times (item iv in Theorem 4.1). Finally, ηp was increased to two
values larger than ηpc (ttr ) (items i and ii in Theorem 4.1), to show that higher inhibition effects produce
faster eradication of the virus V .
As expected, effective treatments produce an instantaneous decline of the viral load, with a monotonically decreasing viral shedding interval as the antiviral efficacy is incremented. On the other hand,
ineffective treatments cause a delay in time to peak, significantly increasing the duration of viral shedding
as ηp is augmented from 0 to ηpc . Even when the viral load peak is a monotonically decreasing function of ηp
1
),
(by following similar steps than the ones in Lemma 1 it can be shown that ∂V (t̂V,tr )/∂R = (δ/β)(1 − R
for R := R(ttr ) ≥ 1, with R(ttr ) = (1 − ηp )pβ/(cδ)), the patient will be PCR-positive for longer periods of time. This means that isolation and precautions measures with treated patients should be carefully
considered, depending on the antiviral effectiveness.
Figure 8 shows a box-plot of the infected-related metrics for the antiviral effectiveness assessment. For
an effective antiviral therapy (ηp > ηpc (ttr )), the difference of viral loads at time-to-peak (∆V ) is above the
2 logs threshold [13] and the duration of infection (DI) is below the 30 days limit (according [51] the viral
shedding interval for untreated COVID-19 patients is in order of 30 days) which is in accordance with an
effective viral clearance strategy. On the other hand, for ineffective antiviral therapy (ηp < ηpc (ttr )), even
tough ∆V is monotonically increasing with ηp , the duration of infection is increased to a sub-potent drug
efficacy. This means that the delay of the virus peak associated to ineffective treatments is significant in
terms of the infected-related metrics.
Scenario 2: treatment initiated in the course of viral spreading
Figures 9 and 10 show the virus load evolution when the antiviral therapy is started in the course of viral
spreading, at ttr ≈ 0.7te and ttr ≈ te , respectively. The viral load over the time has the same qualitative

4.1. The black line denotes the untreated case (ηp = 0).

is augmented - even for effective therapies - since V has already reached a relatively high value at the
treatment time. This behavior is confirmed in box-plots 11 and 12, where a sudden increase of the duration
of infection happens when the antiviral efficacy is near the critical value. However, as the treatment time
is delayed this behavior is mitigated (see box-plot 12) due to the natural increment of V (ttr ) (recall that
V̇ (t) ≈ (R(ttr ) − 1)δV (t), for t > ttr , so larger values of V (ttr ) produce larger values of |V̇ (t)|). It is
important to remark that, even when an increased duration of the viral shedding is reported for the effective
treatment case in the boundary of critical drug effectiveness (ηp ≈ ηpc ), the viral load peak occurs previous
to t̂V , in accordance with items i and ii of Theorem 4.1.

Figure 9: Viral load time evolution with treatment initial time given by ttr = 0.7te . Values of ηp smaller, approximately

equal and greater than ηpc are simulated to demonstrate the results in Theorem 4.1.The black line denotes the untreated
case (ηp = 0).

6.2. Treatment initiated at different times, with the same effectiveness
In order to analyze the viral kinetics when the antiviral therapy is initiated at any time in the whole
infection period (i.e., before and after t̂V ), we studied the temporal dependence of infection-related metrics
corresponding to fixed sup-potent/potent drug effectiveness. Only two representative patients (labeled as B
and E) were considered, based on the uncertainty analysis made in Section 5. The treatment initial times
were: ttr1 = 4, ttr2 = 6, ttr3 = 9, ttr4 = 17, ttr5 = 20 and ttr6 = 25 dpi. Figures 13 and 14 (left)
show that if an ineffective treatment is initiated (ηpB = 0.73 for patient B and ηpE = 0.54 for patient
c
c
E, with ηpB
(ttr ) ≈ 0.81 and ηpE
(ttr ) ≈ 0.6 for ttr < te ), the time-to-peak (t̂V,tr ) and the duration of
infection (DI) decrease as the treatment time is delayed. This can be explained by the fact that, for the
same effectiveness, t̂V,tr is reduced as V (ttr ) is augmented. Equations (8.4) and (8.5) in Lemma 1 show
that for a fixed R ≥ 1, k1 (R) ≥ 0 and k2 (R) ≤ 0 are increasing functions of V (ttr ) (i.e.: k1 (R) = 0
and k2 (R) = −1/(δ(R − 1)) for V (ttr ) → 0 while k1 (R) = 1/((1 − R)2 + R) and k2 (R) = −1/(δR)
for V (ttr ) → δ/β, being δ/β < V (t̂V )). Therefore, since t̂V,tr = k2 ln(k1 ) + ttr (according to equation
(8.3)), it can be inferred that t̂V,tr is monotonically decreasing with V (ttr ). Moreover, comparing the viral
load at the time-to-peak, it can be deduced that V (t̂V,tr2 ) > V (t̂V,tr1 ) for an ineffective therapy started at
two treatment times ttr2 > ttr1 during the beginning of the infection (assuming that U (ttr1 ) ≈ U (ttr2 )).

By following similar steps as in Lemma 1, the viral load at the time-to-peak can be written as:
V (t̂V,tr ) = V (ttr ) + (p/c)U (ttr ) − (δ/β)(ln(Rtr ) + 1) and, therefore, V (t̂V,tr2 ) − V (t̂V,tr1 ) =

V (ttr2 ) − V (ttr1 ) > 0. However, from Figures 13 and 14 (right) it can be seen that V (t̂V,tr ) is of the
order of 106 and 105 copies/ml for patients B and E, respectively, independently of the treatment initiation
time. This can be explained by the fact that the difference of viral load at t̂V,tr , for therapies started at
different times, depends mainly on the deviation between the viral loads at treatment times, which normally are several order of magnitude below V (t̂V,tr ). For example, for patient B, V (t̂V,tr1 ) = 3.29 × 105 ,
V (t̂V,tr2 ) = 3.30 × 105 and V (t̂V,tr3 ) = 4.35 × 105 Copies/ml while V (ttr1 ) = 102 , V (ttr2 ) = 2.5 × 103
and V (ttr3 ) = 1.74 × 105 Copies/ml. Consequently, the increment on the viral peak is not significant as the
treatment is delayed, although the duration of infection is considerably reduced (i.e.: from 96 to 55 days for
patient B and 95 to 65 days for patient E). Note that the target cell-model assumes that the viral clearance in
the convalescent phase is proportional to the virus load concentration at time-to-peak, which is in the same
order of magnitude for the three cases. As a result, and taking into account that the viral peak is reached
early as the treatment is delayed, a quickly viral deletion is observed for the postponed case. As a consequence, if a fixed sub-potent drug is employed, delaying the treatment initiation time could reduce viral
shedding interval, without significantly increasing the viral load at time-to-peak. It is important to remark
that if ηp is reduced even more (ηp ≪ η c ), the viral at time-to-peak follows the same behavior, although, the
viral shedding interval is not-considerably decreased, since t̂V,tr ≈ t̂V as η → 0 (ttr ∈ (ťV , t̂V ). Hence,
although a non-significant improvement on the duration of infection is achieved if the treatment is delayed,
the viral outcomes continues to be acceptable.
On the other hand, if the ineffective therapy is initiated after the viral load peak, the duration of infection
is slightly reduced with respect to the previous case, since R(ttr ) < 1 at this time and, therefore, V̇ =
(R(ttr ) − 1)δV (t) is a decreasing function of V (ttr ). In contrast to this, Figures 13 and 14 (right) show
that if an effective antiviral therapy is applied (ηpB = 0.9 for patient B and ηpE = 0.8 for patient E)
the duration of the infection is still decreased, since R1 (ttr4 ) < R2 (ttr4 ) for both, patient B and patient
E, being Ri the within-host basic reproduction number under a treatment with inhibition effect ηpi , being
ηp1 = 0.9 and ηp2 = 0.73 for patient B and ηp1 = 0.8 and ηp2 = 0.54 for patient E.
6.3. Treatment with antiviral inhibiting both viral infection (ηβ ) and viral replication rate (ηp )
Finally, the virus behavior was considered when a combined antiviral therapy inhibiting both, the viral
infection rate (β) and the viral replication rate (p), was applied. Since the critical drug efficacy for acute
models is defined during the viral spreading interval (Section 4), the treatment was initiated at ttr = 0.7te ,
which is a value fulfilling ttr ∈ (ťV , t̂V ).

Figure 13: Virus time evolution for different treatment times, ttr = 4, 6, 8, 17, 20, 25 (dpi). Two fixed values of ηp were

used, smaller and bigger than ηpc (ttr ): ηp = 0.73 (left) and ηp = 0.9 (right), respectively. ηpc (ttr ) ≈ 0.81 for ttr < te .
Patient B.

For the sake of clarity, only Patient A is considered and the 3 previous infection-related metrics are
assessed as functions of the antiviral inhibition effects ηp and ηβ . Figure 15 shows that the antiviral is
effective for every inhibition effect pair (ηβ , ηp ) fulfilling (ηβ , ηp ) ∈ Hc (ttr ) (i.e.: yellow region of ∆V ),
in accordance with the results in Section 4.2. Moreover, as for the single inhibition cases, the duration of
infection and the time-to-peak increase as the combined drug efficacy pair (ηβ , ηp ) tends to the boundary
of Hc (ttr ). The difference of viral load at time-to-peak ∆V remains constant for every (ηβ , ηp ) ∈ Hc (ttr )
since V (t̂V,tr ) = ttr for effective treatments. In conclusion, the synergistic effect of drug effectiveness in
combined therapies produces a reduction on the critical effectiveness with respect to single-therapies cases,
with the same dynamical behavior over the boundary of Hc (ttr ).
7. Discussion
While several vaccines have been developed to prevent COVID-19 disease, it is imperative to evaluate potential therapies against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among them, antiviral treatments are promissory
strategies to increment the viral clearance ”within-host”, decreasing disease severity. In this sense, the drug
effectiveness concept is crucial to evaluate the drug effect threshold above which the viral load starts declining [52]. Although this critical value has been described for chronic infections (e.g. HIV [52, 53], HCV
[35]) it has not been studied yet for COVID-19. The critical drug efficacy can be understood in terms of the
antiviral potency to decline viral spreading, in spite of guiding the system to an uninfected equilibrium, as it
was introduced in Definition 4, Section 4.2. In addition, the critical inhibition effect of an antiviral depends
on the treatment initiation time, and it has shown to be a monotonically decreasing function during the viral
spreading interval (roughly speaking, during the time interval before the untreated virus peak).
Regarding the virus behavior for effective therapies (η > η c ), the viral load at time-to-peak is practically
equal to V (ttr ) (i.e., a treatment is considered effective if the virus starts to decrease at the very moment
the treatment is initiated, by modifying either ηp , ηβ , or both), so ∆V is larger for earlier treatments,
being greater than the 2 log threshold for effective antiviral therapies started at ttr < te (te ≈ 0.75t̂V ).

used, smaller and bigger than ηpc (ttr ): ηp = 0.54 (left) and ηp = 0.8 (right), respective. ηpc (ttr ) ≈ 0.6 for ttr < te .
Patient E.

Nevertheless, for η approaching η c (from above), the viral shedding interval is enlarged as the treatment
is initiated during the infection growth. Therefore, if the therapeutic objective is to reduce both, the viral
shedding interval and the viral peak, the efficacy level would need to overpass the critical value in a given
20

quantity. From Figure 3 it can be seen that η c (ttr ) > 0.7 for most of patients.
Simulations results suggest that for ineffective therapies, the virus would take longer to be cleared rather than a monotonic decline, as in the previous case - reaching a peak and finally decreasing to zero.
In spite of the fact that the viral load at time-to-peak decreases monotonically with η (∆V increases as the
inhibition effect jumps from 0 to η > 0), the time-to-peak increases as η approaches η c (from below), which
results in a longer duration of infection, potentially requiring additional isolation measures for the treated
patient.
Although an effective reduction of the viral load peak and the duration of infection could be achieved
with early treatments (treatments started before the untreated peak), minor effects are attained with late
ones. Particularly, Figures 13 and 14 corroborate a slight reduction on the viral shedding interval if a subpotent drug therapy is employed after the time-to-peak. Consequently, taking into account that the viral
load in COVID-19 patients presumably reaches the peak prior to the symptom onset, no further clinical
improvements may be obtained if the therapy is started in this symptomatic phase (i.e.: notice that SARSCoV-2 pathophysiology is characterized by a direct cytotoxic effect, endothelial cell damage, dysregulation
of immune response, among others [45]). Furthermore, considering the analysis presented in Theorem 4.1
that is valid during viral spreading interval, we can argue that the non-significant antiviral effect reported
recently in [54] might be related to an early time-to-peak of COVID-19 patients.
The effectiveness of combined treatments affecting both, ηp and ηβ , was also studied and an interdependent critical drug efficacy level was computed. Mathematically, the critical combination of values of
ηp and ηβ is placed on the boundary of the effective set Hc (ttr ), which is a set in the ηp , ηβ space. In
comparison with single treatment cases (represented by the horizontal and vertical dash-dot lines in Figure
15), a reduced critical antiviral efficacy was reported for the combined case, denoting a reduction on the
necessary drug effectiveness to reduce viral spreading. Moreover, the viral characteristic behavior in the
vicinity of the critical drug efficacy (i.e.: increase of time-to-peak and duration of infection) was preserved
for the combined case, as the pair (ηβ , ηp ) belongs to the critical boundary of Hc (ttr ), which implies that
the antiviral effectiveness characterization made in Theorem 4.1 for single treatments could be extended to
combined therapies.
In sum, this work formalizes the existence of a critical drug efficacy for acute infection models, which
could have implications in the extended viral shedding observed ”in-silico” by [55] (for SARS-CoV-2 infections) and by [56] (for influenza) when the antiviral therapy is initiated early but with a sub-potent drug
efficacy. Moreover, it was shown the importance of initialization the antiviral therapy early (before viral
load peak) in order to achieve a significant reduction of ∆V and DI [13, 57]. Although a time dependence
was noticed for the critical drug efficacy (ηpc (t), ηβc (t)), since it is a decreasing function of t (Figure 3), its
behavior does not compromise the antiviral success if an effective therapy is started later.
The main clinical implications for acute infections, and, particularly, for the SARS-CoV-2 infection
are: a) importance of viral load monitoring on probably infected COVID-19 patients (prophylactic use of
antiviral therapy, previous to onset of symptoms, although adverse effects have been reported for potential
antiviral drugs [36], which could limited their prophylactic usage in risk patients), b) isolation of treated
patient, c) possible explanation of the increase of duration of infection showed in immune compromised
COVID-19 patients.

8. Appendix 1. Technical lemmas
Lemma 1. Consider (4.1), constrained by the positive set X, at the beginning of the infection t = 0, with
U (0) > Uc , I(0) ≥ 0 and V (0) > 0. Consider that at some time ttr > 0, ηp (t) jumps from 0 to ηp > ηpc ,
being ηpc the critical value defined in (4.4). Then, there exists te (ηp , ttr ) such that if ttr ∈ (ťV , te ], the virus
peak time t̂V,tr (considering the treatment effect) is a decreasing function of R(ttr ).
Proof: Consider the approximation 3.5, in Remark 4. Since ηp (t) jumps from 0 to ηp < ηpc , at ttr , then R(t)

jumps from R(t−
tr ) to R(ttr ), with R(ttr ) ∈ (R(ttr ), 1) and R(ttr ) > 1. Then it is possible to approximate
the explicit solutions for U (t) and V (t) (by approximating the ln(z) function in the time interval before the
virus peak by (z − 1)( wz1 + w2 ), being w1 and w2 arbitrary constants, fulfilling w1 + w2 = 1 [58]. So,
U (t), for t > ttr , can be written as

The time at which U (t) reaches Uctr - i.e., the time at which R(t) reaches 1 and V (t) reaches its peak,
denoted as t̂V,tr (with t̂V,tr ≥ ttr ) - can be explicitly computed as
t̂V,tr = k2 ln(k1 ) + ttr ,

This way, t̂V,tr = t̂V,tr (R) = k2 (R) ln(k1 (R)) + ttr represents the time of the virus peak in terms of R.
Note that t̂V,tr (R) is defined only for R ≥ 1; indeed, t̂V,tr (1) = ttr since k1 (1) = 1, while t̂V,tr (R) > ttr
for R > 1.
The idea now is to consider the derivative of t̂V,tr with respect to R, to show that it is negative for
treatment times ttr small enough. This derivative reads:

starts at the positive value (1 − R)2 e−2 , for V = 0, then increases to a maximum and finally decreases
asymptotically to zero, for V → ∞. So, there exists some interval of V , maybe small, such that V < f (V ).
Figure 16 shows a plot of f (V ) for different values of R > 1.
Finally, since we are considering the treatment time to belong to the increasing period of V (t) (i.e.,
ttr ∈ (ťV , t̂V ), with V (ťV ) ≈ 0, then small values of V (t) correspond to small values of t. So, a time
interval (ťV , te ] exists such that t̂V,tr is a decreasing function of R(ttr ), and the proof is complete. Figure
17 shows the time evolution of R(t) when the antiviral treatment is initiated at 0.75t̂V and different antiviral

inhibition effects are considered, for the real data patients simulated in Sections 5 and 6. As it can be seen,
larger values of ηp (or smaller values of R(ttr )) corresponds always with larger values of t̂tr,V . 

it is stated in Lemma 1. This implies that if ηp < ηpc , larger values of ηp delays the virus peak time, as it is stated in
Theorem 4.1.iii. Furthermore, the figure confirms that, for real patient date, te is close to t̂V .
