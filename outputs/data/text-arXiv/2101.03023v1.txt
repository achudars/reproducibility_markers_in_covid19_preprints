Abstract
In this paper, we propose a two-group SIR epidemic model to simulate the outcome of stayat-home policy and wearing face masks during the first COVID-19 epidemic wave in the United
States. Based on our proposed model, we further use the optimal control approach (with the
objective of minimizing total deaths) to find the optimal dynamical distribution of face masks
between the healthcare workers and the general public. It is not surprising that all the face masks
should be solely reserved for the healthcare workers if the supply is short. However, when the
supply is indeed sufficient, our numerical study indicates that the general public should share
a large portion of face masks at the beginning of an epidemic wave to dramatically reduce the
death toll. This interesting result partially contradicts with the guideline advised by the US
Surgeon General and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in March 2020.
The optimality of this sounding CDC guideline highly depends on the supply level of face masks
that changes frequently, and hence it should be adjusted according to the supply of face masks.

Introduction

Ever since the first reported case on December 31, 2019, in Wuhan, China [33], the ongoing outbreak
of COVID-19 has been spreading around the whole world. During the first two months of 2020,
the pandemic was mainly restricted in mainland China, especially within the Hubei province. On
March 1, 2010, there were 87,137 reported cases in the world [32], more than 90% of which were
from China, and 67,103 cases were reported in Hubei province [24]. In March 2020, the epidemic
wave in China was approaching the end, while the reported case numbers in Europe and North
America grew rapidly. Even though the first case was reported on January 22, 2020 [8], the United

States did not take very serious or effective actions until March 2020 [13]. Due to different cultures
and medical systems, the control strategies vary from one country to another. For instance, wearing
face masks for everyone in public areas is ubiquitous and even enforced by compulsory policies in
China, Japan and South Korea [14]. However, in March 2020, the US Surgeon General advised the
public general not to buy face masks [6], and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
commented that face masks won’t protect the healthy people from getting the SARS-CoV-2 [5].
Nevertheless, according to the study in [17,29], the aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is possible
because the virus can last in aerosols for hours and remain viable and infectious. Moreover, there
are plenty of scientific evidence showing that a person not developing any symptom may still be
infectious [11]. Thus, wearing face masks in public is an effective way to reduce the spreading of
COVID-19, and more importantly to prevent those asymptomatic carriers [1] from infecting others.
In several recent papers [12, 25, 31], some dedicated compartmental models are developed for
assessing the community-wide impact of massively using face masks by the general public, which
shows its high efficacy in curtailing community transmission and reducing the burden of the pandemic. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no related discussion about how to optimize
the allocation of face masks between healthcare workers (HCW) and the general public. In April
2020, the CDC started to recommend wearing cloth face coverings for the general public (GP). Due
to initial shortage in supply, the CDC advised to save face masks for healthcare workers [9]. It
poses a natural question to ask: whether one should distribute a portion or none of face masks to
the general public along the epidemic outbreak? In other words, should the general public continue
reserves all the face masks for the HCW only? We are particularly interested in the group of HCW
since higher nurse-to-patient staffing ratios can result in healthier patients and hence protecting
the health of the limited number of HCW is paramount [4, 23]. In general, it may takes several
years to train a HCW who are qualified to do the professional job. The objective of this work is to
design an epidemic model with face masks and stay-at-home factors to find the optimal dynamical
distribution of face masks among the healthcare workers and the general public, with the purpose
of minimizing the total number of deaths.
This paper is organized as follows. In the next section, an optimal control model based on a
new two-group SIR model is introduced, where the effects of wearing face masks and stay-at-home
policy are considered. The justification and estimation of the relevant parameters of our proposed
model is discussed in Section 3. Section 4 presents the numerical results, where three different
scenarios are demonstrated. Finally, some conclusion and discussion are given in Section 5.

A Two-Group SIR Model

Our model is based on the standard SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) model proposed in [19].
To distinguish between two groups: the general public (GP) and healthcare workers (HCW), we
introduce six compartments S1 , I1 , R1 , S2 , I2 , R2 for the SIR classifications in the two groups. The
subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the GP and the HCW, respectively. We do not include the asymptomatic

2

(or latent) compartment because we assume that all infected individuals are infectious even though
they do not develop any symptoms [11]. Let K1 (t) ≥ 0 and K2 (t) ≥ 0 be the numbers of face masks
distributed in the two groups over the given time period [0, T ]. The average number of available
face masks for these two groups are ρ1 = K1 /(S1 +I1 +I2 ) and ρ2 = K2 /(S2 +R2 ). Here, we assume
that the recovered GP (R1 ) do not need face masks but the recovered HCW (R2 ) will return their
job and still need to wear face masks. Moreover, the infected HCW (I2 ) are released from their
duty of healthcare and thus considered as a part of GP. Now, we can set the transmission rates for
the GP and the HCW to be βf1 (ρ1 ) and βf2 (ρ2 ), where β > 0 is the intrinsic transmission rate of
SARS-CoV-2, and f1 and f2 are positive and decreasing functions. For simplicity, we choose
f1 (ρ1 ) =

1 + αρ1
r + αρ2
, f2 (ρ2 ) =
,
1 + ρ1
1 + ρ2

(1)

where 1 − α ∈ (0, 1) stands for the maximum efficacy of wearing face masks, and r > 1 indicates the
higher risk of infection for the HCW comparing to the GP. Next, we introduce the ratio of infected
individuals over the number of HCW: ρ = (I1 + I2 )/(S2 + R2 ) and assume that the recovery rate
and death rate depend on ρ according to two given functions γ(ρ) and δ(ρ), respectively. It is
reasonable to assume that the higher ρ is, the smaller γ(ρ) and the larger δ(ρ) will be. In our
simulations, we will choose
γ(ρ) =

γ0 + γ∞ ρ
δ0 + δ∞ ρ
, δ(ρ) =
,
1+ρ
1+ρ

(2)

where γ0 > 0 and δ0 > 0 are the recovery and death rates of an infected individual with sufficient
healthcare (ρ → 0), and γ∞ > 0 and δ∞ are the rates when the healthcare system is overwhelmed
(ρ → ∞). Obviously, γ0 > γ∞ and δ0 < δ∞ . To estimate the efficacy of stay-at-home policy, we
introduce another parameter q > 0 to account for the portion of susceptible individuals who limit
their activity in an isolated region (staying at home for example) so that they are isolated from
the infected group. Finally, we are ready to state our two-group SIR model which consists of six
ordinary differential equation (see Figure 1 for its transfer diagram):
S1′ = −βf1 (ρ1 )S1 [f1 (ρ1 )I1 + f1 (ρ1 )I2 ] − qS1 ,

(3)

S2′ = −βf2 (ρ2 )S2 [f1 (ρ1 )I1 + f1 (ρ1 )I2 ],

(4)

I1′ = βf1 (ρ1 )S1 [f1 (ρ1 )I1 + f1 (ρ1 )I2 ] − [γ(ρ) + δ(ρ)]I1 ,

(5)

I2′ = βf2 (ρ2 )S2 [f1 (ρ1 )I1 + f1 (ρ1 )I2 ] − [γ(ρ) + δ(ρ)]I2 ,

(6)

R1′

= γ(ρ)I1 ,

(7)

R2′

= γ(ρ)I2 ,

(8)

where ρ1 = K1 /(S1 +I1 +I2 ), ρ2 = K2 /(S2 +R2 ), ρ = (I1 +I2 )/(S2 +R2 ), the functions f1 and f2 are
given in (1), and the functions γ and δ are defined in (2). The prime symbol on the left-hand side
of the equations denotes the ordinary derivative in time t. Such two-group SIR epidemic models

3

were widely known in literature, see e.g. [22] and references therein. Note that fi (ρ) (with i = 1
or i = 2) appears twice in the incidence rates. This is because the face masks are more effective in
reducing disease transmission if both susceptible and infected individuals are wearing them.

The above optimization model gives a nonlinear constrained optimal control problem, whose optimal control (may not be unique) can be mathematically characterized via Pontryagin’s minimum
principle [20]. Due to its high non-linearity, we will numerically solve the above optimal control
problem using a direct transcription method [2,18] based on Legendre-Gauss-Radau pseudo-spectral
collocation [15, 27] and nonlinear programming (NLP) solvers (e.g., IPOPT [3] and SNOPT [16]).
Different from the indirect methods that require to derive necessary optimality conditions, such
direct transcription methods are more flexible in treating extra constraints and are also widely
supported by well-developed general optimal control software packages that are ready to be used.
In particular, our following numerical simulations are performed with the free and open-source
Imperial College London Optimal Control Software (ICLOCS2) [26] within MATLAB , where the
derivatives are numerically computed by the algorithmic differentiation toolbox Adigator [30].

Estimation of Parameters

To estimate the model parameters, we need to fit the reported data on cumulative confirmed case
numbers, denoted by C(t). The change rate of C(t) is the same as the newly infected case number,
which according to our model is
C ′ = β[f1 (ρ1 )S1 + f2 (ρ2 )S2 ][f1 (ρ1 )I1 + f1 (ρ1 )I2 ].

(11)

The initial numbers of susceptible population and health-care workers are estimated as S1 (0) =
310, 000, 000 [28] and S2 (0) = 16, 000, 000 [10]. Throughout this paper, the time unit is in days.
We choose March 13, 2020 as the initial time t = 0 since an emergency declaration was warranted
for the COVID-19 pandemic on that date [13]. Accordingly, we set I1 (0) = 1, 896 [8]. Since the
epidemic wave was starting and stay-at-home policy was adopted following the declaration, we let
I2 (0) = R1 (0) = R2 (0) = 0. Based on the cumulative case numbers reported from February 28,
2020 to March 13, 2020 [8], we can estimate the intrinsic growth rate as βS1 (0) − γ0 − δ0 = 0.35
by fitting a simple exponential growth model
C(t) = C(0)e[βS1 (0)−γ0 −δ0 ]t ,

(12)

which can be obtained by approximating our model under the assumptions that, before March 13,
2020, stay-at-home policy was not adopted (q = 0), few people wore face masks (K1 + K2 ≪ S2 ≪
S1 ), and the infected population was small (I2 ≪ I1 ≪ S2 ). Consequently, we have S1 (t) ≈ S1 (0)
and ρ1 , ρ2 , ρ, I2 ≈ 0. The equation (5) is approximated by a linear equation I1′ = [βS1 (0)−γ0 −δ0 ]I1
with solution I1 (t) = I1 (0)e[βS1 (0)−γ0 −δ0 ]t . The equation for the cumulative case numbers C(t) in
(11) can be approximated as C ′ (t) = βS1 (0)I1 (t) = βS1 (0)I1 (0)e[βS1 (0)−γ0 −δ0 ]t . This together with
the initial condition C(−∞) = 0 gives (12).
The basic reproduction number R0 = βS1 (0)/(γ0 + δ0 ) for SARS-CoV-2 was estimated to be
about 2.2 [21]. In view of βS1 (0)−γ0 −δ0 = 0.35, we obtain from a simple calculation γ0 +δ0 = 0.29
and βS1 (0) = 0.64. To estimate γ0 and δ0 , we need to make use of the death rate which varies
from 4% to 7.5% [7]. Here, we choose δ0 /(γ0 + δ0 ) = 7%. Consequently, we have δ0 = 0.02 and
γ0 = 0.27. There is no data available for the case when the healthcare system is overwhelmed by
too many infected patients, and we simply assume that with a overwhelmed healthcare system the
death rate will reach δ∞ = 0.1 and the recovery rate reduces to γ∞ = 0.1.
The values for α, r cannot be found in the literature. Here, we set α = 0.9 (face masks can at
most reduce the transmission rate by 10%), and r = 3 (the healthcare workers are three times more
likely to be infected than the general public). We have used some other values for these parameters,
and the results do not vary much. Especially, we numerically find that the optimal distributions of
face masks have very similar patterns for any reasonable choices of α and r.
To estimate the efficacy of stay-at-home parameter q, we assume ρ ≈ 0 and ignore the population
of healthcare workers (S2 << S1 and I2 << I1 ). For simplicity, we also assume that the majority

5

does not wear face masks (ρ1 ≈ 0) and then fit the confirmed cumulative case numbers reported
from March 13, 2020 to April 30, 2020 [8] by the following simplified SIR model:
S ′ = −βSI − qS,

(13)

′

(14)

′

R = γ0 I,

(15)

C ′ = βSI,

(16)

I = βSI − (γ0 + δ0 )I,

where S(0) = 310, 000, 000, C(0) = 1896, β = 0.64/S(0), γ0 = 0.27, and δ0 = 0.02. The equation
for R can be decoupled from the system. The two unknown parameters q and I(0) are estimated via
MATLAB’s nonlinear least-squares curve fitting solver lsqnonlin. With a random initial guess, the
lsqnonlin solver converges to the (local) optimally estimated parameters: q = 0.03, I(0) = 1070.
Numerically, we observe the fitted parameters q and I(0) are insensitive to the chosen initial guess as
well as the possible different choices of R(0). It is tempted to treat R(0) as an additional unknown
parameter, but in this way its fitted value is not uniquely determined by the given data. Hence, we
reasonably set R(0) = 0 by assuming nobody recovered at the beginning. Figure 2 illustrates the
close match between the reported C(t) data and simulated C(t) based on the fitted parameters.
We point out that the stay-at-home term qS is crucial for achieving such a satisfactory fitting while
fixing the other system parameters. The assumed and estimated parameter values are listed in
Table 1.

Numerical Results

In this section, we report some inspiring simulation results based on our proposed optimal control model for optimizing the allocation of face masks among HCW and GP with our estimated
parameters. We highlight that the application of our model to different countries/areas may need
to re-estimate some of the parameters based on the actual reported data and population scale.
Our tested choices of maximum daily production capacity of the face masks is only for demonstrating our proposed model, which does not reflect the real-life situations. Moreover, our current
model does not take into account those home-made cloth face masks and the effects of mandatory
quarantine. Therefore, our model outcomes are mainly for qualitative comparison analysis.
We set T = 100 and consider 3 scenarios of maximum daily production capacity of face masks:
(i) Kmax = 16, 000, 000 (each HCW can have at most one face mask every day);
(ii) Kmax = 80, 000, 000 (each HCW can have at most five face masks every day);
(iii) Kmax = 160, 000, 000 (each HCW can have at most ten face masks every day).

Figure 3: Scenario (i): optimal allocation of face masks between the GP and HCW.
For the scenario (i) with very limit supply, our optimal control results are reported in Figure
3. It shows the face masks should be distributed to the HCW only, which indeed agrees with the
guideline from CDC. With this policy control, the total death numbers of the GP and the HCW
are J1 = 386, 017 and J2 = 104, 707, respectively. With more investments from the government and
industries, the supply of face masks has been quickly boosted up to a higher level. In this context,
we would want to ask whether this CDC guideline continues to be optimal with increased supply
of face masks? The simple answer is not anymore, as clearly shown in the next two scenarios.
For the scenario (ii) with moderate supply, our optimal control results are reported in Figure 4.
Quite different from the scenario (i), it shows the face masks should be about equally distributed
at the beginning, and then gradually shifted more but not all face masks to the HCW across the
whole pandemic outbreak. The total death numbers of the GP and the HCW are J1 = 144, 818 and
J2 = 27, 145, respectively. As a comparison, Figure 5 shows the corresponding outcomes if strictly
following the CDC guideline to allocate all face masks to HCW, where the total death numbers
of the GP and the HCW become J1 = 182, 409 (with 26% increase) and J2 = 29, 890 (with 10%
increase), respectively. The significant increasing (about 23%) in the total death toll is somewhat
surprising but reasonable, since more infected numbers in GP due to not wearing face masks would
infect more HCW and hence lead to higher death rates and more deaths in both groups.

Figure 5: Scenario (ii)-CDC: all face masks are reserved for HCW only.

For the scenario (iii) with very sufficient supply, our optimal control results are reported in
Figure 6. Different from both the scenarios (i) and (ii), it shows the majority of face masks
should be distributed to the GP at the beginning of the epidemic outbreak, and then gradually
shifted to the HCW along the outbreak. The total death numbers of the GP and the HCW are
J1 = 80, 897 and J2 = 12, 208, respectively. For comparison, Figure 7 shows the corresponding
outcomes if following the CDC guideline to allocate all face masks to HCW, where the total death
numbers of the GP and the HCW become J1 = 155, 540 (with 92% increase) and J2 = 21, 871 (with
80% increase), respectively. Astonishingly, the total death numbers are almost doubled if strictly
following the reasonably sounding CDC guideline, where the protection effect of wearing too many
face masks for HCW is essentially saturated based on our model setting. It is also worthwhile to
notice that the optimal allocation of masks has greatly flatted the infectious peak curves and hence
lead to much less deaths.
As an alternative illustration, the relevant functions f1 , f2 , γ, δ with respect to time are compared
in Figure 8, where we indeed observe slightly higher death rates and lower recovering rates if all
face masks are reserved for HCW only (as advised by CDC). The scenario (iii) indicates that an
appropriately balanced allocation of the face masks between GP and HCW plays a significant role
in saving more lives. In summary, three different scenarios manifest the allocation of face masks
needs to be carefully optimized, especially when the supply becomes gradually more sufficient.

Conclusion and Discussion

In this paper, we constructed a two-group SIR model to optimize the distribution of face masks
among the healthcare workers (HCW) and the general public (GP). When the supply of face masks
is in short, our result indicates that all face masks should be reserved for the HCW. This coincides
with the advice from the CDC in April 2020 [9]. However, when there are plenty supply of face
masks, the general public should share a large portion of face masks at the beginning of an epidemic
outbreak. This result somewhat contradicts the recommendations given in March 2020 by the US
Surgeon General [6] and the CDC [5]. The optimality of this reasonable sound CDC guideline
highly depends on the supply level of face masks that changes frequently and varies by locations,
and hence this guideline should be modified according to the supply of face masks. Based on
our choices and estimations of parameter values and assuming that the supply of face masks is
sufficient and the stay-at-home policy remains effective, our model indicates that the first epidemic
wave would have ended in May 2020 with a cumulative total 93,105 deaths, with 80,897 deaths from
the GP and 13,208 deaths from the HCW. Note that the stay-at-home policy was released before
the end of the first epidemic wave, and a even stronger second epidemic wave arised afterwards.
Unlike physical phenomenon which can be observed from repeated experiments, epidemic outbreaks
cannot be tested multiply times. Our model analysis and numerical simulation provide theoretical
experiments on what would have been occurred if the general public were advised to wear face
masks at the beginning of the first epidemic wave and the stay-at-home policy were enforced until
the end of the epidemic wave.
There are some limitations for our studies. For instance, the values for parameters δ∞ , γ∞ , α, r
are arbitrarily chosen. More real-life data collections are required to obtain more reliable estimations
on the death and recovery rates of SARS-CoV-2 in the case of overwhelmed healthcare system, the
efficacy of wearing face masks, and the risk of healthcare workers. With these limitations being
said, our model predictions may vary a lot whenever the involved parameters are changed. In
particular, the reopening of the country will significantly diminish the stay-at-home efficacy and
general multiple epidemic waves.
Our proposed model can be extended in several different ways. For example, it is interesting
Rt
to alternatively enforce an integral constraint 0 K1 (τ ) + K2 (τ )dτ ≤ (K0 + Kmax t), which is more

practical since it allows flexible usage of face masks according to the epidemic dynamics and possible
initially stocked face masks (denoted by K0 ). Our developed model can be generalized to optimize
the allocations of other personal protective equipments (PPE) among various groups of populations
(e.g., public workers vs the general public). It is also possible to further differentiate the protection
effects between different types of face masks. In addition, the objective functional may also includes
some economic considerations, such as the production and transportation costs of face masks. The
generalization of our model to optimally allocate the limited vaccination is also interesting.
