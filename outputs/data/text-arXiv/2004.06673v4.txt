Abstract. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a
devastating effect on the global public health. Computed Tomography
(CT) is an effective tool in the screening of COVID-19. It is of great
importance to rapidly and accurately segment COVID-19 from CT to
help diagnostic and patient monitoring. In this paper, we propose a UNet based segmentation network using attention mechanism. As not all
the features extracted from the encoders are useful for segmentation,
we propose to incorporate an attention mechanism including a spatial
and a channel attention, to a U-Net architecture to re-weight the feature representation spatially and channel-wise to capture rich contextual relationships for better feature representation. In addition, the focal
tversky loss is introduced to deal with small lesion segmentation. The
experiment results, evaluated on a COVID-19 CT segmentation dataset
where 473 CT slices are available, demonstrate the proposed method can
achieve an accurate and rapid segmentation on COVID-19 segmentation.
The method takes only 0.29 second to segment a single CT slice. The
obtained Dice Score, Sensitivity and Specificity are 83.1%, 86.7% and
99.3%, respectively.

Introduction

In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, now designated as COVID-19 by the
World Health Organization (WHO), was identified as the cause of an outbreak
of acute respiratory illness [15, 25]. The pandemic of COVID-19 is spreading all
over the world and causes a devastating effect on the global public health. As
a form of pneumonia, the infection causes inflammation in alveoli, which fills
with fluid or pus, making the patient difficult to breathe [23]. Similar to other
coronaviral pneumonia such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), COVID-19 can also lead to acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [7, 11]. In addition, the number of people
infected by the virus is increasing rapidly. Up to April 19, 2020, 2,241,359 cases of

COVID-19 have been reported in over 200 countries and territories, resulting in
approximately 152,551 deaths4 , while there is no efficient treatment at present.
Due to the fast progression and infectious ability of the disease, it’s urgent to
develop some tools to accurate diagnose and evaluate the disease. Although the
real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of the sputum is considered
as the gold standard for diagnosis, while it is time-consuming and has been
reported to suffer from high false negative rates [13,21]. In clinical practice, Chest
Computed tomography (CT), as a non-invasive imaging approach, can detect
certain characteristic manifestations in the lung associated with COVID-19, for
example, ground-glass opacities and consolidation are the most relative imaging
features in pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, Chest
CT is considered as a low-cost, accurate and efficient method diagnostic tool for
early screening and diagnosis of COVID-19. It can be evaluated how severely
the lungs are affected, and how the patient’s disease is evolving, which is helpful
in making treatment decisions [10, 12, 14, 16, 26].
A number of artificial intelligence (AI) systems based on deep learning have
been proposed and results have been shown to be quite promising in medical image analysis [2, 6, 17, 20]. Compared to the traditional imaging workflow heavily
relies on the human labors, AI enables more safe, accurate and efficient imaging solutions. Recent AI-empowered applications in COVID-19 mainly include
the dedicated imaging platform, the lung and infection region segmentation, the
clinical assessment and diagnosis, as well as the pioneering basic and clinical
research [22]. Segmentation is an essential step in AI-based COVID-19 image
processing and analysis for make a prediction of disease evolution. It delineates
the regions of interest (ROIs), e.g., lung, lobes, bronchopulmonary segments,
and infected regions or lesions, in the chest X-ray or CT images for further assessment and quantification [22]. There are a number of researches related to
COVID-19. For example, Zheng et al. [28] proposed a weakly-supervised deep
learning-based software system using 3D CT volumes to detect COVID-19. Goze
et al. [4] presented a system that utilises 2D slice analysis and 3D volume analysis to achieve the detection of COVID-19. Jin et al. [9] proposed an AI system
for fast COVID-19 diagnosis, where a segmentation model is first used to obtain
the lung lesion regions, and then the classification model is used to determine
whether it is COVID-19-like for each lesion region. Li et al. [12] developed a
COVID-19 detection neural network (COVNet) to extract visual features from
volumetric chest CT exams for distinguishing COVID-19 from Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP). Chen et al. [3] proposed to use UNet++ [30] to extract
valid areas and detect suspicious lesions in CT images.
U-net [18] is the most widely used encoder-decoder network architecture for
medical image segmentation, since the encoder captures the low-level and highlevel features, and the decoder combines the semantic features to construct the
final result. However, not all features extracted from the encoder are useful for
segmentation. Therefore, it is necessary to find an effective way to fuse features,

we focus on the extraction of the most informative features for segmentation.
Hu et al. [5] introduced the Squeeze and Excitation (SE) block to improve the
representational power of a network by modelling the interdependencies between
the channels of its convolutional features. Roy et al. [19] introduced to use both
spatial and channel SE blocks (scSE), which concurrently recalibrates the feature
representations spatially and channel-wise, and then combine them to obtain the
final feature representation. Inspired by this work, we incorporate an attention
mechanism including both spatial attention and channel one to our segmentation network to extract more informative feature representation to enhance the
network performance.
In this paper, we propose a deep learning based segmentation with the attention mechanism. A preliminary conference version appeared at ISBI 2020 [29],
which focused on the multi-model fusion issue. This journal version is a substantial extension, including (1) An automatic COVID-19 CT segmentation network. (2) A focal tversky loss function (different from the paper of ISBI) which
is introduced to help to segment the small COVID-19 regions. (3) An attention
mechanism including a spatial and a channel attention is introduced to capture
rich contextual relationships for better feature representations.
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 offers an overview of this work
and details our model, Section 3 describes experimental setup, Section 4 presents
the experimental results, Section 5 discusses the proposed method and concludes
this work.

2.1

Method
The proposed network architecture

Our network is mainly based on the U-Net architecture [18], in which we integrate
an attention mechanism, res dil block and deep supervision. The encoder of the
U-Net is used to obtain the feature representations. The feature representation at
each layer are input into an attention mechanism, where they will be re-weighted
along channel-wise and space-wise, and the most informative representations can
be obtained, and finally they are projected by decoder to the label space to obtain
the segmentation result. In the following, we will describe the main components
of our model: encoder, decoder, and res dil block, deep supervision and attention
mechanism. The network architecture scheme is described in Fig. 1.
2.2

Encoder and decoder

The encoder is used to obtain the feature representations. It includes a convolutional block, a res dil block followed by skip connection. In order to maintain
the spatial information, we use a convolution with stride = 2 to replace pooling
operation. It’s likely to require different receptive field when segmenting different regions in an image. All convolutions are 3 × 3 and the number of filter is
increased from 32 to 512. Each decoder level begins with upsampling layer followed by a convolution to reduce the number of features by a factor of 2. Then

4

input and directly outputs the COVID-19 region.

the upsampled features are combined with the features from the corresponding
level of the encoder part using concatenation. After the concatenation, we use
the res dil block to increase the receptive field. In addition, we employ deep
supervision [8] for the segmentation decoder by integrating segmentation layers
from different levels to form the final network output, shown in Fig. 2.
2.3

Res dil block and deep supervision

It’s likely to require different receptive field when segmenting different regions
in an image. Since standard U-Net can not get enough semantic features due to
the limited receptive field, inspired by dilated convolution [27], we proposed to
use residual block with dilated convolutions on both encoder part and decoder
part to obtain features at multiple scales, the architecture of res dil is shown
in Fig. 2. The res dil block can obtain more extensive local information to help
retain information and fill details during training process.
To demonstrate that the proposed res dil can enlarge the receptive field mathematically, we let F : Z 2 → R be a discrete function, Ωr = [−r, r]2 ∈ Z 2 and let
k : Ωr → R be a discrete filter size (2r + 1)2 . The discrete convolution operator
? can be described as follows:
(F ? k) =

r
r
X
X

F (x − m, y − n)k(m, n)

(1)

m=−r n=−r

Let l be a dilation factor and the l-dilated convolution operation ?l can be
defined as:
(F ?l k) =

r
r
X
X

F (x − lm, y − ln)k(m, n)

(2)

m=−r n=−r

We assume F0 , F1 ,..., Fn−1 : Z 2 → R are a discrete functions, and k0 ,
k1 ,..., kn−2 : Z 2 → R are discrete 3 × 3 filters. In addition, we apply the filters
with exponentially increasing dilation factors, such as 20 , 21 ,... 2n−2 . Then, the
discrete function Fi+1 can be described as:

COVID-19 CT segmentation network

Fi+1 = Fi ?2i ki , i = 0, 1, ..., n − 2

5

(3)

According to the definition of receptive field, the receptive field size of each
element in Fi+1 is (2i+2 − 1) × (2i+2 − 1), which is a square of exponentially increasing size. So we can obtain a 15×15 receptive field by applying our proposed
res dil block with the dilation factor 2 and 4, respectively, while the classical convolution can only obtain 7 × 7 receptive field, see Fig. 3.

Fig. 2. The architecture of our proposed Res dil block (left) and Deep supervision
(right). IN refers instance normalization, Dil conv the dilated convolution (rate = 2,
4, respectively). We refer to the vertical depth as level, with higher levels being higher
spatial resolution. In the deep supervision part, Inputn refers the output of res dil
block of the nth level in the decoder, Outputn refers the segmentation result of the nth
level in the decoder.

2.4

Attention mechanism

In U-net shaped network, not all the features obtained by the encoder are effective for segmentation. In addition, not only the different channels (filters)
have various contributions but also different spatial location in each channel can
give different weights on feature representation for segmentation. To this end,
we introduced a ”scSE based ” attention mechanism in both encoder and decoder to take into account the most informative feature representations along
channel-wise and spatial-wise for segmentation, the architecture is described in
Fig. 4.

Fig. 3. The illustration of receptive field, R denotes the receptive field, k denotes the
convolution kernel size, and l denotes the dilated factor. (a) a convolution network
which consists of two k = 3 × 3 and l = 1, 1 convolutional layers. (b) a convolution
network which consists of two k = 3 × 3 and l = 2, 4 dilated convolutional layers.

The individual feature representations from each channel are first concatenated as the input representation Z = [z1 , z2 , ..., zn ], Zk ∈ RH×W , n is the
number of channel in each layer. To simplify the description, we take n = 32.
In the channel attention module, a global average pooling is first performed
to produce a tensor g ∈ R1×1×32 , which represents the global spatial information
of the representation, with its k th element
gk =

H X
W

Zk (i, j)

(4)

Then two fully-connected layers are applied to encode the channel-wise dependencies, ĝ = W1 (δ(W2 g)), with W1 ∈ R32×16 , W2 ∈ R16×32 , being weights of
two fully-connected layers and the ReLU operator δ(·). ĝ is then passed through
the sigmoid layer to obtain the channel-wise weights, which will be applied to
the input representation Z through multiplication to achieve the channel-wise
representation Zc , the σ(gˆk ) indicates the importance of the i channel of the
representation:
Zc = [σ(gˆ1 )z1 , σ(gˆ2 )z2 , ..., σ(gˆ32 )z32 , ]

(5)

In the spatial attention module, the representation can be considered as
Z = [z 1,1 , z 1,2 , ..., z i,j , ..., z H,W ], Z i,j ∈ R1×1×32 , i ∈ 1, 2, ..., H, j ∈ 1, 2, ..., W ,
and then a convolution operation q = Ws ? Z, q ∈ RH×W with weight Ws ∈
R1×1×32×1 , is used to squeeze the spatial domain, and to produce a projection
tensor, which represents the linearly combined representation for all channels
for a spatial location. The tensor is finally passed through a sigmoid layer to
obtain the space-wise weights and to achieve the spatial-wise representation Zs ,
the σ(qi,j ) that indicates the importance of the spatial information (i, j) of the
representation:
Zs = [σ(q1,1 )z 1,1 , ..., σ(qi,j )z i,j , ..., σ(qH,W )z H,W ]

(6)

The fused feature representation is obtained by adding the channel-wise representation and space-wise representation:
Zf = Zc + Zs

(7)

The attention mechanism can be directly adapted to any feature representation problem, and it encourages the network to capture rich contextual relationships for better feature representations.

Fig. 4. The architecture of attention mechanism. The individual feature representations (z1 , z2 , ..., z32 ) are first concatenated as Z, and then they are recalibrated spatially and channel-wise to achieve the Zs and Zc , final they are added to obtain the
rich fused feature representation Zf .

2.5

Loss function

In the medical community, the Dice Score Coefficient (DSC), defined in (5),
is the most widespread metric to measure the overlap ratio of the segmented
region and the ground truth, and it is widely used to evaluate segmentation

where N is the number of pixels in the image, c is the set of the classes, pic is
the probability that pixel i is of the tumor class c and pic is the probability that
pixel i is of the non-tumor class c. The same is true for gic and gic , and  is a
small constant to avoid dividing by 0.
One of the limitation of Dice Loss is that it penalizes false positive (FP)
and false negative (FN) equally, which results in segmentation maps with high
precision but low recall. This is particularly true for highly imbalanced dataset
and small regions of interests (ROI) such as COVID-19 lesions. Experimental
results show that FN needs to be weighted higher than FP to improve recall
rate. Tversky similarity index [24] is a generalization of the DSC which allows
for flexibility in balancing FP and FN:

Another issue with the DL is that it struggles to segment small ROIs as they
do not contribute to the loss significantly. To address this, Abraham et al. [1]
proposed the Focal Tversky Loss function (FTL).

where γ varies in the range [1, 3]. In practice, if a pixel is misclassified with a
high Tversky index, the FTL is unaffected. However, if the Tversky index is
small and the pixel is misclassified, the FTL will decrease significantly. To this
end, we used FTL to train the network to help segment the small COVID-19
regions.

Experimental setup

3.1

Dataset and preprocessing

The two datasets used in the experiments come from Italian Society of Medical
and Interventional Radiology: COVID-19 CT segmentation dataset 5 . Dataset1 includes 100 axial CT images from 60 patients with Covid-19. The images
have been resized, greyscaled and compiled into a single NIFTI-file. The image

size is 512 × 512 pixels. The images have been segmented by a radiologist using
three labels: ground-glass, consolidation and pleural effusion. Dataset-2 includes
9 volumes, total 829 slices, where 373 slices have been evaluated and segmented
by a radiologist as COVID-19 cases. We resize these images from 630 × 630
pixels to 512 × 512 pixels same as Dataset-1. And an intensity normalization is
applied to both datasets. Since there are severe data imbalance in the dataset.
For example, in Dataset-1, only 25 slices have pleural effusion, which is the
smallest region among all the COVID-19 lesion regions (see the green region in
Fig. 4). In Dataset-2, only 233 slices have consolidation, which takes up a small
amount of pixels in the image (see the yellow region in Fig. 4). We take all the
lesion labels as a COVID-19 lesion. Because of the small number of data in both
two datasets, we combine the two datasets as our final training dataset. Here,
we give some example images of the COVID-19 CT segmentation dataset in Fig.
5.

effusion is shown in green.

3.2

Implementation details

Our network is implemented in Keras with a single Nvidia GPU Quadro P5000
(16G). The network is trained by focal tversky loss and is optimized using the
Adam optimizer, the initial learning rate = 5e-5 with a decreasing learning rate
factor 0.5 with patience of 10 epochs. Early stopping is employed to avoid overfitting if the validation loss is not improved over 50 epochs. We randomly split
the dataset into 80% training and 20% testing.
3.3

Evaluation metrics

Segmentation accuracy determines the eventual success or failure of segmentation procedures. To measure the segmentation performance of the proposed
methods, three evaluation metrics: Dice, Sensitivity and Specificity are used to
obtain quantitative measurements of the segmentation accuracy.

1) Dice: It is designed to evaluate the overlap rate of prediction results and
ground truth. Dice ranges from 0 to 1, and the better predict result will have a
larger Dice value.

2) Sensitivity(also called the true positive rate, the recall): It measures the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified:
Sensitivity =

3) Specificity(also called the true negative rate): It measures the proportion of
actual negatives that are correctly identified:

number of true negative voxels, F P represents the number of false positive voxels,
and F N represents the number of false negative voxels.

Experiment results

In this section, we conduct extensive comparative experiments including quantitative analysis and qualitative analysis to demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed method.
4.1

Quantitative analysis

To assess the performance of our method, and to analyze the impact of the
proposed components of our network, we did an ablation study with regard to
the attention mechanism and Focal Tversky Loss function (FTL), we refer our
proposed network without the attention mechanism to baseline, the results are
shown in Table 1. We can observe the baseline trained with DL achieves dice
score, sensitivity and specificity of 80.4%, 75.7%, 99.8%, respectively. However,
using the focal tversky loss can aide the network to focus more on the false
negative voxels, which increases 0.87% of dice score, 3.43% of sensitivity for
Baseline and 1.96% of dice score, 13.04% of sensitivity for our proposed network.
We can also observe in Table 1 that integrating the attention mechanism to the
segmentation network can boost the performance, since we can see an increase
of 1.37% of dice score and 1.32% of sensitivity for ’Baseline+DL’ and 2.47% of
dice score and 10.73% of sensitivity for ’Baseline+FTL’. The main reason is that
the attention mechanism can help to emphasis on the most important feature
representation for segmentation. In addition, the proposed network trained by
FTL combines the benefits of attention mechanism with FTL to outperform all
other methods with dice = 83.1%, sensitivity= 86.7% and specificity= 99.3%.

Qualitative analysis

In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we randomly select several
examples on COVID-19 CT segmentation dataset and visualize the results in Fig.
6. From Fig. 6, we can observe that the baseline trained by DL could give a rough
segmentation result, while it fails to segment many small lesion regions. With
the application of focal tversky loss, it can help to improve the segmentation
result with a much better result. In addition, the attention mechanism can help
to further refine the segmentation result. The proposed network trained by FTL
can achieve the result closest to the ground truth. The obtained results have
demonstrated that leveraging the attention mechanism and FTL can generally
enhance the COVID-19 segmentation performance.

Conclusion

In this paper, we have presented a U-Net based segmentation network using
attention mechanism. Since most current segmentation networks are trained with
dice loss, which penalize the false negative voxels and false positive voxels equally,
contributing a high specificity but low sensitivity. To this end, we applied the
focal tversky loss to train the model to improve the small ROI segmentation
performance. Moreover, we improve the baseline by incorporating an attention
mechanism including a spatial attention and a channel attention in each layer
to capture rich contextual relationships for better feature representations. We
evaluated our proposed network on COVID-19 CT segmentation datasets, and
the experiment results demonstrate the the superior performance of our method.
However, the study is limited by the small dataset, in the future we would like to
apply a larger training dataset to refine our model, and achieve more competitive
results.
