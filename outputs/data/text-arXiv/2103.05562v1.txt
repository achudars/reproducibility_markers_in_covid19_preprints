Abstract
We are living in the era of the fourth industrial revolution, which also treated as 4IR or Industry
4.0. Generally, 4IR considered as the mixture of robotics, artificial intelligence (AI), quantum
computing, the Internet of Things (IoT) and other frontier technologies. It is obvious that nowadays
a plethora of smart devices is providing services to make the daily life of human easier. However,
in the morning most people around the globe use a traditional mirror while preparing themselves
for daily task. The aim is to build a low-cost intelligent mirror system that can display a variety of
details based on user recommendations. Therefore, in this article, Internet of Things (IoT) and AIbased smart mirror is introduced that will support the users to receive the necessary daily update
of weather information, date, time, calendar, to-do list, updated news headlines, traffic updates,
COVID-19 cases status and so on. Moreover, a face detection method also implemented with the
smart mirror to construct the architecture more secure. Our proposed MirrorME application
provides a success rate of nearly 87% in interacting with the features of face recognition and voice
input. The mirror is capable of delivering multimedia facilities while maintaining high levels of
security within the device.

1. Introduction
Nowadays in this world, technologies are advancing day by day. For this reason, maximum devices
need to be updated with smart technology. The smart systems are organized by Artificial
Intelligence (AI) and build smart equipment that makes the devices more interactive with the user.
However, the smart device has the capability to easily sense, process and analyze the captured
information. In modern days, working professionals are highly busy with their daily work and thus
it is quite difficult for them to check daily necessary information including the latest news, To-do
list, daily stock market update, social media newsfeed, traffic jam update, weather forecast and so
on. This research proposed an IoT based smart mirror that helps the users to receive all this
information. In addition, an AI-based face detection method also introduced that ensures a specific
level of security for the proposed architecture. Besides, this system will also offer the opportunity

for users to check their daily e-mails, helps them by playing preferred audio and video songs with
the features of voice input. Currently, significant research works have been conducted in the
domain of developing an interactive smart mirror for personal use. Kulovic et al. [1] have
developed a smart mirror using the concept of Do-It-Yourself (DIY) which displays the basic
information of the user including date/time, weather, and news headlines. In their development,
authors have used Raspberry Pi for the development of their system and users have the privilege
of adding or removing their information using their phone or tablets. Besides, by presenting the
basic information of the user's, Akshaya et al. [2] have developed a two-button supported smart
mirror, one for the website and another for the map. The key feature of this research is to access
the smart mirror from several areas with an assistance of a user-friendly interface. In other work,
Yusri et al. [3] introduced a smart mirror that offers users to control their home appliances using a
voice recognition mechanism. Mainly, this application is developed to save the energy
consumptions of the users along with showing some basic features including time, traffic, weather,
and so on. Specifically for the aged and disabled peoples, Athira et al. [4] have developed a mirror
using passive Infrared (PIR) sensors. The designed system highly capable of detecting a person
with the support of internet connections. Moreover, basic features including social media
notifications, weather information, and time also incorporated with this architecture. In other work,
in order to present the basic features and to control the household devices, Hossain et al. [5] design
a smart mirror. However, to verify an authenticated user that article discussed the mechanism of
using face recognition technology. Similarly, Nadaf et al. [6] and Njaka et al. [7] also developed
a smart mirror for ensuring home security along with some basic features. A biometric
authentication based user recognition model has developed by the authors [7-8] to ensure sufficient
security in accessing the smart mirror. To detect an intruder through a smart mirror in a room, Jin
et al. [8] have proposed an alarm based interactive application. This article focuses on storing
images of users in a dataset and the designed system send notifications to the authenticated user
when the model does not identify someone.

With an 80% accuracy, in detecting users faces Mohamed et al. [9] have designed an artificial
intelligence-based smart mirror. For recognizing existing users, they also proposed a registration
method with the support of the facial recognition method. In recent time, Hollen et al. [10] have
designed a facial recognition-based smart mirror to detect the user mood in real-time. The authors
employed the concept of the user’s face and outbound movement’s detection to recognize the face
and identify the mood in the system. In this article, design and implementation of an IoT based
smart mirror with the support of personalized information recommendation and face recognition
approach is proposed. Following Table 1 highlights the available features for both category of
users (general users and authenticated users). This research have focused on the design and
development of an interactive smart mirror; development of a voice-controlled input; and to ensure
the accurate detection of users faces to access the features.

general user.

2. Methodology
In this section, the design methodology of this proposed framework has been discussed. The
proposed architecture is suitable for the essential functionality of any smart home. On the other
hand, this will timely remind the user for a specific task based on the user's preference. Different
features of the proposed MirrorME application are illustrated in Figure 1. MirrorME is designed
dedicatedly for two different categories of users; one is general users and other is authenticated
users. The authentication process is developed with the support of HOG-SVM based face
recognition approach. Regarding the access of different features, there is some personal
information recommendation features for any existing users whereas the general users only have
the access of some specific basic features. However, the authenticated users also access some of
the premium features of smart mirror by using the voice recognition features. Functional and
access diagram of general user and authenticated user of MirrorME application is shown in Figure
2.

Figure 1. Various features of the proposed MirrorME application

As we have already discussed, in this exploration, face recognition is required to detect the
authentic user for accessing the smart mirror. Face recognition has been employed in this research
using the architecture of Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features and the linear Support
Vector Machine (SVM). The proposed feature extraction algorithm by Dalal et al. [11] known as
Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG). In HOG, initially the image is divided into small cells
and then the gradient or edge direction histogram is collected in each cell unite, and finally these
histograms are combined to form a HOG descriptor. While doing feature extraction, HOG
generally creates 3780 features of the image.

Page 5 of 17

Figure 2. Functional and access diagram of general user and authenticated user of MirrorME application

A gradient in the horizontal and vertical directions is obtained first to extract the feature in HOG.
The template of horizontal direction is 𝐾 = [−1,0,1] and to filter image, its transposition can be
used, that is why it is possible to calculate the horizontal and vertical gradients, easily. The
expression (Eq. 1) and (Eq. 2) is given as follows

𝑔 𝑥 = 𝐼(𝑥 + 1, 𝑦) − 𝐼(𝑥 − 1, 𝑦)

(1)

𝑔𝑦 = 𝐼(𝑥, 𝑦 + 1) − 𝐼 (𝑥, 𝑦 − 1)

(2)

Here, the direction gradient of x is represented by 𝑔𝑥 and the direction gradient of y is represented
by 𝑔𝑦 , the pixel value of (𝑥, 𝑦) is denoted by 𝐼(𝑥, 𝑦). The gradient magnitude of (𝑥, 𝑦) is denoted
by ∆𝑔 (𝑥, 𝑦) and calculated (Eq. 3) by

Page 6 of 17

∆𝑔 (𝑥, 𝑦) = √𝑔𝑥 2 + 𝑔𝑦 2

(3)

And, the gradient direction (Ɵ) of (𝑥, 𝑦)is calculated (Eq. 4) by

Ɵ = arctan(𝑔𝑦 /𝑔𝑥 )

(4)

In machine learning, Support Vector Machine (SVM) [12] used as a binary classifier. Classes
separated with the largest gap between the support vectors. Here, the borderline instances in a class
known as support vectors. In addition, we have extended the SVM with the support of kernel.
Kernels transform data from input space to feature space. The kernel is a mathematical function
that takes two arguments and returns the dot product of their value. Let two data points 𝑥1 and 𝑥2
mapping is denoted by 𝜑 then the kernel 𝐾 will be (Eq. 5)

𝐾(𝑥1 , 𝑥2 ) = 𝜑(𝑥1 ) 𝑇 𝜑(𝑥2 )

(5)

When input space and feature space are equal then it is known as linear kernel and this linear kernel
is used in linear SVM. Mathematically, the equation of linear kernel can be expressed as (Eq.6)
𝐾(𝑥1 , 𝑥2 ) = 𝑥1 𝑇 𝑥2 ⇒ φ(x) = x

(6)

Due to its capability of faster application training therefore, it is highly efficient in highdimensional data applications. The proposed workflow is consisted of detecting faces using HOG
and linear SVM, computing embedding and comparing the vector to the database via a voting
method. The basic flow of the HOG feature extraction algorithm and the face detection technique
of the proposed application is illustrated in Figure 3.

3. Design and Implementation
In this segment, the design and implementation approach has discussed with the architectural view
of hardware and software. The hardware of the proposed framework consists of a various
components including two-way mirror, raspberry pi 3B+, camera, microphone, wood frame,
display screen, speaker and some others. Following Figure 4 depicts the IoT based hardware
configuration diagram of the proposed MirrorME application.

3.1 Raspberry pi
The Raspberry pi [13] is a small and powerful computer that uses its own OS known as Raspberry
pi OS and this operating system is Debian-based. Importantly, this device is the core component of
our designed smart mirror.

3.2 Camera
For the purpose of face recognition, this work needed to use a camera and our proposed algorithm
is incorporated with the camera to identify an existing user for accessing the MirrorME application.

3.3 Two way mirror
Basically, a mirror is a smooth polished surface where the image is created by the refection. In this
work, a two-way mirror is used in which one side is transparent and the other side shows its
reflection. The concept of using a two-way mirror is similar to using a usual mirror and that same
mirror also acts as a functional object.

3.4 Display monitor
In order to present the basic information including date/time, weather update, alarm, news
headlines, traffic update and so on, a display monitor is essential in this model. Therefore, in the
development of the model, LG 14 inch monitor is connected to the Raspberry pi module using
HDMA interfacing.

3.5 Microphone and speaker
To utilize the features of the voice-based activity, a microphone is needed in the designed model.
A single Bluetooth speaker is also attached to the system to receive feedback. However, all the
output results can be received through the speaker.
Based on the above discussion, the complete model of the architectural diagram and framework
design approach of the proposed system shown in Figure 5.

To avoid unnecessary access to personal features for specific users, this model has also designed
a multi-phase user recognition system. For recognizing the valid and existing users, HOG
(Histogram of Oriented Gradients) and Linear SVM (Support Vector Machine) based face
recognition model have been employed. The detailed working procedure of the proposed system
highlighted in Figure 6. In addition, a stepwise description of the working procedure presented in

4. Results and Discussion
This section has discussed testing results based on experiments. In order to test our designed
model, we have conducted a result analysis based on the experience users observed during the
assessment of this application. This research work has been carried out in the machine intelligence
lab (MINTEL) of the Dhaka International University. Ten (10) participants have chosen to
participate in this experiment based on previous experience in interacting with smart devices. All
the participants were chosen aged between 22-25 years. In order to achieve higher accuracy in the
task of face recognition, we have chosen a frame rate of 50 and a resolution of 480 x 360. The
resolution 480×360 has been taken because a high-resolution frame takes a higher time to process
and a low-resolution frame normally does not provide high accuracy. Among the Ten (10)
percipients, there were Four (4) female participants (FP) and Six (6) male participants (MP) to
interact with the MirrorME system. For each participant, exactly Ten (10) responses have been
recorded for the features of face recognition and others. The success rate for each individual is
shown in Table 2. However, during the testing phase, face recognitions features shows ~100%
accuracy for the fourth male participants (MP4). On the other hand, it shows an accuracy of ~60%
for the first female participants (FP1).

After the testing phase of face recognition, the same ten (10) participants again interacted with the
mirror with the voice input. Each of the participants provides ten (10) voice input to interact with
the individual features including YouTube, Alarm, Traffic, and daily schedule. Table 3 presents

during the time of interaction with the MirrorME. Table 4 shows the average success rate for each
individual based on the data of Table 2 and Table 3. In addition, we also highlighted the three

5. Conclusion
This paper demonstrated a smart mirror device with a user-friendly architecture with many
impressive features. Following a service-oriented approach, a stable and easy-to-use architecture
was also introduced in this article. However, security issues cannot be overlooked in today's world
of interconnected devices. Therefore, this system was designed with a strong authentication
framework to ensure the system's end-to-end security. Two different features (face recognition and
voice input) sets this designed model aside from other similar works. Furthermore, unique features
such as information customization for each individual user made this model more convenient and
effective. Again, the prototype's advancement has infinite possibilities in the future in the field of

medical data analysis including BMI calculations, temperature check and blood pressure indicator.
The most notable aspect of this model is the ability to carry the smart mirror display across the
entire house.
