Abstract
With the ongoing global pandemic of COVID-19, a question is whether the coming summer in the northern
hemisphere will reduce the transmission intensity of COVID-19 with increased humidity and temperature.
In this paper, we investigate this problem using the data from the cases with symptom-onset dates from
January 19 to February 10, 2020 for 100 Chinese cities, and cases with confirmed dates from March 15 to
April 25 for 1,005 U.S. counties. Statistical analysis is performed to assess the relationship between the
transmissibility of COVID-19 and the temperature/humidity, by controlling for various demographic, socioeconomic, geographic, healthcare and policy factors and correcting for cross-sectional correlation. We find a
similar influence of the temperature and relative humidity on effective reproductive number (R values) of
COVID-19 for both China and the U.S. before lockdown in both countries: one-degree Celsius increase in
temperature reduces R value by about 0.023 (0.026 (95% CI [-0.0395,-0.0125]) in China and 0.020 (95% CI
[-0.0311, -0.0096]) in the U.S.), and one percent relative humidity rise reduces R value by 0.0078 (0.0076
(95% CI [-0.0108,-0.0045]) in China and 0.0080 (95% CI [-0.0150,-0.0010]) in the U.S.). If assuming a 30
degree and 25 percent increase in temperature and relative humidity from winter to summer in the northern
hemisphere, we expect the R values to decline about 0.89 (0.69 by temperature and 0.20 by humidity).
Moreover, after the lockdowns in China and the U.S., temperature and relative humidity still play an
important role in reducing the R values but to a less extent. Given the notion that the non-intervened R values
are around 2.5 to 3, only weather factors cannot make the R values below their critical condition of R<1,
under which the epidemic diminishes gradually. Therefore, public health intervention such as social
distancing is crucial to block the transmission of COVID-19 even in summer.

Introduction
The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) disease has become a global pandemic with more than 4.7
million confirmed cases worldwide until May 18, 2020 1 since its first reported case in Wuhan, China in
December 2019 2. Compared with the epidemic of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 3,
the geographic range of the COVID-19 outbreak is much wider. The transmission of coronavirus can be
affected by a number of factors, including climate conditions (such as temperature and humidity), population
density, medical care quality etc.4,5. Previous studies have shown that wintertime climate and host behavior
can facilitate the transmission of influenza 6–8 and other human coronaviruses 9,10. Recently there have also
been studies analyzing the effectiveness of government policies (e.g., city lockdown) to the transmission of
the disease 11,12. With the arrival of summer in the northern hemisphere, people are wondering whether hot
and humid weather can slow down the COVID-19 pandemic 13,14. Existing studies find that temperature and
humidity have a significant influence on the number of confirmed cases for a certain location15. On the other
hand, indirect evidence shows the transmission of COVID-19 in the local community among tropical areas,
which indicates that the impact of meteorological conditions on COVID-19 may not be as big as those on flu
and colds.16 Therefore, the accurate measurement of the influence of weather conditions on the
transmissibility of COVID-19 is important for the knowledge of the general public. However, until now, there
is no direct evidence demonstrating the influence of temperature and humidity on the transmissibility directly
measured by the effective reproductive number (R value) of COVID-19.

Furthermore, during a pandemic, getting timely and accurate research insights is essential for taking
effective countermeasures and reducing economic losses. However, the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic
is not yet sufficient to support a thorough study of the impact of meteorological factors on the transmission
of the SARS-CoV-2 virus at any fixed location. Since the transmission of other human coronaviruses that
cause mild respiratory symptoms is seasonal, recently the seasonality of these viruses has been borrowed to
conduct a long-term simulation of the transmission of COVID-19 17.
The goal of this paper is to quantify the influences of temperature and humidity on the transmissibility
of COVID-19 measured by R values, through analyzing COVID-19 data from both China and the U.S. with
rigorous statistical analysis. Specifically, we adapt the strategy of “trading space for time”, that is, in a
relatively short time range, linking the transmission intensity in different locations to their associated
meteorological conditions. Our analysis shows that this strategy allows us to recognize the meteorological
trend of the pandemic even in its early stage.
Results
COVID-19 has spread widely in both China and the U.S. The transmissibility and weather conditions
in the major cities of these two countries vary largely (Figures 1 and 2). We analyze the relationship between
the COVID-19 transmissibility and the weather factors, controlling for various demographic, socio-economic,
geographic, healthcare and policy factors, and correcting for cross-sectional correlation. Overall, we find
robust negative associations between temperature as well as humidity and COVID-19 transmission before
the large-scale public-health interventions in China and the U.S. Moreover, the temperature has a consistent
influence on the effective reproductive number, R values, for both Chinese cities and U.S. counties; relative
humidity also has consistent effects across the two countries. Both of them remain to have a negative
influence even after the public-health intervention (lockdown), but with smaller magnitudes since more and
more people stay at home and hence expose less to the outdoor weather. More details are presented below.
Temperature, Relative Humidity, and Effective Reproductive Numbers. For either China and the
U.S., we conduct a series of cross-sectional regressions (Fama-Macbeth approach 18) of the daily effective
reproductive numbers (R values), which measure the transmissibility of COVID-19, on the six-day average
temperature and relative humidity up to and including the day when the R value is measured 19 and other
control factors, for the before lockdown period, the after lockdown period, and the overall period. Figure 1
shows the average R values from January 19 to 23 (before the public health intervention) for different Chinese
cities geographically, and Figure 2 shows the average R values from March 15 to April 6 (before the majority
of states declared a stay-at-home order) for different U.S. counties.

Before the lockdown, the results for Chinese cities (Table 1) demonstrate that the six-day average
temperature and relative humidity have a strong influence on R values, with p values smaller than or around
0.01 for all three time period specifications. One-degree Celsius increase in temperature and one percent
increase in relative humidity reduce the R value by 0.026 (95% CI [-0.0395, -0.0125]) and 0.0076 (95% CI
[-0.0108, -0.0045]), respectively. Analysis for U S. counties (Table 2) shows that six-day average
temperature and relative humidity have statistically significant associations on R values with p values lower
than 0.05 before April 7, the time when most states declared state-wise stay-at-home orders 20. One-degree
Celsius increase in temperature and one percent increase in relative humidity reduce the R value by 0.020
(95% CI [-0.0311, -0.0096]) and 0.0080 (95% CI [-0.0150, -0.0010]) respectively.
Overall, the influence of the temperature and relative humidity on R values are quite similar before
lockdown in China and the U.S.: one-degree Celsius increase in temperature reduces R value by about 0.023
(0.026 (95% CI [-0.0395,-0.0125]) in China and 0.020 (95% CI [-0.0311, -0.0096]) in the U.S.), and one
percent relative humidity rise reduces R value by about 0.0078 (0.0076 (95% CI [-0.0108,-0.0045]) in China
and 0.0080 (95% CI [-0.0150,-0.0010]) in the U.S.
After lockdown, the temperature and relative humidity also present negative relationships with R values
for both countries. For China, it's statistically significant (with p values lower than 0.05), and one-degree
Celsius increase in temperature and one percent increase in relative humidity reduce R values by 0.0209 (95%
CI [-0.0378, -0.0041]) and 0.0054 (95% CI [-0.0104, -0.0004]), respectively. For the U.S. the estimated
effects of the temperature and relative humidity on R values are still negative but no longer statistically
significant (with p values 0.141 and 0.073, respectively). The less influence from weather conditions is very
likely caused by the stay-at-home policy during the lockdown periods, and hence people expose less to the
outdoor weather. Therefore, we rely more on the estimates of the weather-transmissibility relationship before
the lockdowns in both countries.
Control Variables. Several control variables also have significant influences on the transmissibility of
COVID-19. In China, before the lockdowns, in cities with higher levels of population density, the virus
spreads faster than that in less crowded cities due to more possible contacts among people. One thousand
people per square kilometer rise in population density is associated with a 0.1188 (95% CI [0.0573, 0.1803])
increase in the R value before lockdown. Cities in China with more doctors have a smaller transmission
intensity, since the infected are treated in hospitals and hence unable to transmit to others. Particularly, one
thousand more doctors are associated with a 0.0058 [-0.0090, -0.0025] decrease in the R value during the
overall time period; the influence of doctor number is greater before lockdown with a coefficient of 0.0109
(95% CI [-0.0163, -0.0056])). Similarly, more developed cities (with higher GDP per capita) normally have
better medical conditions, hence, patients are more likely to be taken care and thus unlikely transmitting to
others. Ten thousand Chinese Yuan GDP per capita increase lowers the R value by 0.0145 (95% CI [-0.0249,
-0.0040]) before the lockdown. In the U.S., there's a strong relationship between R value and the number of
ICU beds per capita after lockdown, with a p value at 0.001; every unit increase in ICU bed per 10,000
population decreases the R value by 0.0110 (95% CI [-0.0171, -0.0049]). What's more, counties with more
people over 65 years old have lower R values, but the magnitude is small, i.e. one percent increase in fraction
of aged over 65 is associated with a 0.0092 (95% CI [-0.0135, -0.00498]) decrease in R value in the overall
time period.
Absolute Humidity. Absolute humidity, the mass of water vapor per cubic meter of air, relates to both
temperature and relative humidity. Previous work shows that absolute humidity is a good solo variable
explaining the seasonality of influenza 21. The results shown in Table 3 are only partly consistent with this
notion21. Particularly, for the U.S. counties, relative humidity and absolute humidity are almost equivalent in
explaining the variation of the R value (12.57% vs. 12.55%), while absolute humidity does achieve a higher
significance level (p-value of 0.00001) compared to relative humidity (p-value of 0.019) before lockdown.
However, the coefficient of absolute humidity is not statistically significant for Chinese cities (p-value of
0.312).
Lockdown and Mobility. Intensive health emergency and lockdown policies have taken place since
the outbreak of COVID-19 in both the U.S. and China. In the regression analysis, we use cross-sectional
4

centralized (with sample mean extracted) explanatory variables, and thus the intercepts in the regression
models estimate the average R value of different time periods. In China, the health emergency policies on
January 24, 2020 lowered the average R value from 2.1174 (95% CI [1.5699,2.6649]) to 0.8084 (95% CI
[0.5334,1.0833]), which corresponds to a more than 60% drop. In the U.S., the regression results of the data
as of April 25 show that although the R value has not decreased to less than 1, the lockdown policies have
reduced the average R value by nearly half, from 2.1970 (95% CI [1.6631,2.7309]) to 1.1837 (95% CI
[1.1687,1.1985])
We use the Baidu Mobility Index (BMI) drop as the proxy for intra-city mobility change (compared to
the normal time) in China. Regression results show that before the lockdown, 1% decrease of BMI drop is
associated with a decrease of R value by 0.004093 (95% CI [-0.00683, -0.001356]). After the lockdown, the
BMI drop does not significantly affect R value. A possible reason is that the BMI variations across cities are
quite small (all in quite low levels) after the lockdown, as the paces of intervention in different Chinese cities
are quite similar. Overall, the negative relationship before lockdown may also imply that the rapid response
to infectious disease risks is crucial. For the U.S., we use the M50 index, the fraction of daily median of
maximum moving distance over that in the normal time (workdays between February 17 and March 7), as
the proxy of mobility. It has a positive relationship with R value for both overall and after lockdown time
period with p-values lower than 0.01, which demonstrates that counties with more social movements would
have higher R values than others.
Robustness Checks. We check the robustness of influences of temperature/humidity on R values over
two conditions:
(1) Wuhan city. Among these 100 cities in China, Wuhan is a special case with the earliest outbreak
COVID-19. There was an increase of more than 13,000 cases in a single day (February 12, 2020) due
to the unification of testing standards with other regions of China 22. Therefore, as a robustness check,
we remove Wuhan city in our sample and redo the regression analysis.
(2) Different measurement of serial intervals. We also use serial intervals in previous work (mean 7.5
days, std 3.4 days based on 10 cases) 23 with a Weibull distribution to estimate R values of various
cities/counties for robustness checks.
The results of the above-mentioned two robustness checks are shown in Table A5 to A7. All of them
show that temperature and relative humidity have a strong influence on R values with strong statistical
significance, which are consistent with the reported results in Table 1 and Table 2.
Discussions
We have identified robust negative associations between temperature/humidity and COVID-19
transmission using samples of the daily transmissibility of COVID-19, temperature and humidity for 100
Chinese cities and 1,005 U.S. counties. Although we use different datasets (symptom-onset data for Chinese
cities and confirmed cases data for the U.S. counties) for different countries, we obtain consistent estimates.
This result also aligns with the evidence that high temperature and high humidity can reduce the transmission
of influenza 21,24–27, which can be explained by two potential reasons. First, the influenza virus is more stable
in cold environments, and respiratory droplets, as containers of viruses, remain airborne longer in dry air 28,29.
Second, cold and dry weather can also weaken the hosts’ immunity and make them more susceptible to the
virus 30,31. Our result is also consistent with the evidence that high temperature and high relative humidity
reduce the viability of SARS coronavirus 32,33.
Our study suggests that the arrival of summer and rainy season in the northern hemisphere can
potentially reduce the transmissibility of the COVID-19, but it is unlikely that the COVID-19 pandemic will
“automatically” diminish when summer comes, because temperature and humidity alone are not sufficient to
make the R value less than the critical value of 1 based on their effect estimates. An increase of roughly 30°C
in temperature and 25% in relative humidity from winter to summer reduce the R value by 0.69 and 0.20
respectively, which would altogether lower down R value by 0.89. If all other conditions are held fixed, it is
impossible to lower down the R value to 1 by just temperature and relative humidity, based on the fact that
the initial R0 value is about 2.5 to 3 34. Thus, from winter to summer, the R values decline one third at most.
According to the results of both the U.S. and China, in order to lower down the R value to 1 from the R value
5

of 3, the temperature would have to increase by 87°C or the relative humidity would have to increase by 256
percent, if all other conditions are held fixed.
Therefore, public health intervention is still necessary to block the transmission of COVID-19 even in
summer. Particularly, as shown in this paper, lockdowns, constraints on human mobility, increase in hospital
beds, etc. can effectively reduce the transmissibility of COVID-19.
Limitation. The R2 of our regression is about 30% in China and 12% in the U.S., which means that
about 70% to 88% of cross-city R value fluctuations cannot be explained by temperature and relative
humidity (and controls). Moreover, the temperatures and relative humidity in our Chinese samples range
from -21°C to 20°C and from 49% to 100%, in the U.S. the temperature and humidity range from -10°C to
29°C and from 16% to 99%; thus it is still unknown yet whether these negative relationships still hold in
extremely hot and cold areas. The slight differences between the estimates on the U.S. and Chinese cities
might come from the different ranges of temperature and relative humidity.
Methods
Data. Records of 69,498 patients with symptom-onset days up to February 10, 2020 for 325 cities, are
extracted from the Chinese National Notifiable Disease Reporting System. Each patient’s records contain the
area code of his/her current residence, the area code of the reporting institution, the date of symptoms onset
and the date of confirmation. In our paper, with symptom-onset data, we are able to estimate the precise R
values for various Chinese cities. Note that in this work, in order to protect the patients’ privacy, no
identifiable personal information was extracted. For the U.S. data, daily confirmed cases for 1,005 counties
with more than 20,000 population are collected from COVID-19 database of JHU CSSE available at
https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/. We obtain data from March 15 to April 25 for the 1,005
counties, and there are total 740,843 confirmed cases for these counties as of April 25. Note that due to the
unavailability of onset date in U.S. data, we estimate R values from daily confirmed cases for U.S. counties,
which may be less precise than that of Chinese cities.
We collect 4,711 cases from the epidemiological surveys available online published by the Center for
Disease Control and Prevention of 11 provinces and municipalities including Beijing, Shanghai, Jilin,
Sichuan, Hebei, Henan, Hunan, Guizhou, Chongqing, Hainan and Tianjin. By analyzing the records of each
patient’s contact history with other patients, we match close contacts and screened out 105 pairs of clear virus
carriers and the infected, which are used to estimate the serial intervals of COVID-19.
Temperature and relative humidity data are obtained from 699 meteorological stations in China from
http://data.cma.cn/. Population density, GDP per capita, the fraction of the population aged 65 and above, the
number of doctors in 2018 for each city are obtained from https://data.cnki.net. The indices representing the
number of migrants from Wuhan to other cities over the period of January 7 to February 10 and Baidu
Mobility Indexes are obtained from https://qianxi.baidu.com/. Panel A of Table A1 in supplementary
materials provides summary statistics of the Chinese variables with pairwise correlation shown in Table A2.
For U.S., temperature and relative humidity data are from National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration at https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/. Population data and the fraction of over 65 for each county
are obtained from https://www.census.gov/. GDP and person income in 2018 for each county are obtained
from https://www.bea.gov/. Data describing mobility changes, including the fraction of maximum moving
distance over normal time, and home-stay minutes for each county are obtained from
https://github.com/descarteslabs/DL-COVID-19 and https://www.safegraph.com/ respectively. Gini index,
fraction of population below poverty level, fraction of not in labor force (16 years or over), fraction of total
household more than $200,000, fraction of food stamp/SNAP benefits are obtained from American
Community Survey data at https://www.census.gov/. The number of ICU beds for each county is obtained
from https://www.kaggle.com/jaimeblasco/icu-beds-by-county-in-the-us/data. Panel B of Table A1 in
supplementary materials provides summary statistics of the U.S. variables with pairwise correlation shown
in Table A3.
Construction of Effective Reproductive Numbers. We use the effective reproductive numbers, the R
value, to quantify the transmission of COVID-19 in different cities and counties. The calculation of R values
6

contains two steps. First, we estimate the serial interval, which is the time between successive cases in a chain
of transmission, of COVID-19 using the 105 pairs of virus carriers and the infected. We fit 105 samples of
serial intervals with the Weibull distribution (a distribution commonly used to fit the serial interval of
influenza) 35. Specifically, as shown in Figure A1, we fit the Weibull distribution using the Maximum
Likelihood Estimation (MLE) method by Python package ‘Scipy’ and R package ‘MASS’ (Python version
3.7.4, ‘Scipy’ version 1.3.1 and R version 3.6.2, ‘MASS’ version 7.3_51.4). The two results are consistent
with each other. The mean and standard deviation of the serial intervals are 7.4 and 5.2 days, respectively.
Note that cities with a small number of confirmed cases normally have a highly wiggled R value curve due
to inaccurate R value estimation, therefore, we select 100 cities with more than 40 cases in our sample from
the 325 Chines cities. We then calculate the effective reproductive number, R value, for each of the 100
Chinese cities from the date of the first-case to February 10 through a time-dependent method based on
Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) 36. The inputs to the method are epidemic curves, i.e. the historical
numbers of patients of each day, for a certain city. For estimation of R values in U.S. counties, the settings of
serial intervals remain the same as China, i.e. with 7.4 days mean and 5.2 days standard deviation. We use
the same methods of estimating R values of all 1,005 U.S. counties from the date when the first confirmed
case occurred in the county to April 25. The main difference remains that the epidemic curves of U.S. counties
are arranged by the date of confirmation due to lack of symptom-onset data; whereas Chinese curves are
based on symptom-onset dates. The R values are calculated with the Package ‘R0’ developed by Boelle &
Obadia with the R version 3.6.2 and ‘R0’ version 1.2_6.37
Study Period. We aim to study the influences of various factors on R value under the outdoor
environment, therefore if people stay at home for most of their time under the restrictions of the isolation
policy, weather conditions are unlikely to influence the virus transmission due to no chance of contact among
people. We, therefore, perform separate analyses before and after the large-scale stay-at-home policy for both
China (January 24) and the U.S. (April 7), respectively. Note that the first-level response to major public
health emergencies in many major Chinese cities and provinces including Beijing and Shanghai were
announced on 24 January. Moreover, the number of cases in most cities was too small before January 18 to
estimate the R value accurately. Thus, we take the daily R values from January 19 to January 23 for each city
as the before lockdown period. Although Wuhan City imposed a travel restriction at 10 a.m. on January 23,
a large number of people still left Wuhan before 10 a.m. on that day, so our sample still includes January 23.
We take January 24 to February 10 as the period after lockdown for China. As reported by The New York
Times, most states had announced state-wise stay-at-home orders from April 7 for the U.S. 20. Moreover, the
number of cases in most counties before March 15 is too small for estimating R value. Thus, we take daily R
values from March 15 to April 6 for each county as values during the before-lockdown period and daily R
values from April 7 to April 25 as values during the after-lockdown period.
Statistical Analysis. We use six-day average temperature and relative humidity up to and including the
day when the R value is measured, which is inspired by the five-day incubation period estimated from Johns
Hopkins University 19 plus one-day onset. In the data of this work, the series of the 6-days average
temperature, the 6-days average relative humidity, and the daily effective reproduction number R are mostly
non-stationary. We find declining trends of R values for nearly all China cities and the U.S. counties, which
may be due to the nature of the disease and due to people’s raised awareness and increased self-protection
measures even before the lockdown orders from the government. Table A4 Panel A and Panel B in
supplementary materials show the panel unit root test results for China and U.S. data, respectively. As such,
direct time-series regression cannot be applied, since it will lead to the so-called spurious regression38, that
is, a regression that provides misleading statistical evidence of a linear relationship between non-stationary
time series variables. We, hence, adopt the Fama-Macbeth methodology18, which consists of a series of crosssectional regressions and has been proved effective in various disciplines including finance and economics.
The details are illustrated as follows.
Fama-Macbeth Regression 18. Fama-Macbeth regression is a two steps procedure. In the first step, it
runs cross-sectional regression at each point of time; the second step estimates the coefficient as the average
of the cross-sectional regression estimates:
7

Step 1: Denote the time length as T, the number of controls as m. For each time t, we run a cross-sectional
regression:
!",$ = &$ + ($)*+,$ ∗ -./0",$ + (12*",$ ∗ ℎ4/5",$ + ∑<
;=1 (&78-97:; ,- ∗ &78-97:;,5,- +>",$
Step 2: Estimate the average of the first step regression coefficient estimates:
@ = B ∑C$DB (A,$
(
A
C
We use the Newey-West approach39 to adjust the time-series autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity in
calculating standard errors in the second step. Note that Fama-MacBeth regression is commonly used in
estimating parameters for finance and economic models that are valid even in the presence of the crosssectional correlation. To the best of our knowledge, our study is a novel application of the Fama-Macbeth
method in urgent public health and epidemiological problems.
Specifically, on each day during a study period, we perform a cross-sectional regression of the daily R
values of various cities or counties on their 6-day average temperature and relative humidity, and several
categories of control variables as follows:
(1) Demographics. Population density and fraction of people aged 65 and older for both China and the U.S.
(2) Socio-economic statuses. GDP per capita for Chinese cities. For the U.S. counties, Gini index and the
first PCA factor derived from several factors including GDP per capita, personal income, the fraction
of population below poverty level, the fraction of population not in labor force (16 years or over), the
fraction of population with total household more than $200,000, the fraction of food stamp/SNAP
benefits.
(3) Geographical variables. Latitude and longitude for both China and the U.S.
(4) Healthcare. The number of doctors for Chinese cities and the number of ICU beds per capita for U.S.
counties.
(5) Human mobility status. For Chinese cities, the number of people migrated from Wuhan in the 14 days
prior to the R measurement, and the drop rate of BMI compared to the same day in the first week of Jan
2020. For U.S. counties, the fraction of maximum moving distance over the median of normal time
(weekdays from Feb 17 to March 7), and home-stay minutes are used as mobility proxies. All human
mobility controls are averaged over a 6-day period in the regression.
All analyses are conducted in the software Stata version 16.0.

Table A6: Relationship between Temperature, Relative Humidity, and R Values: Robustness
Check with the Serial Interval of Mean 7.5 Days and Standard Deviation 3.4 days in Li et al
(2020) 2 for Chinese Cities
This table utilizes estimated serial interval in a previous paper (mean 7.5 days, std 3.4 days) 2 to
construct R values for China. The table reports the coefficients of the effective reproductive number, R
values, on an intercept, temperature, relative humidity and control variables in the Fama-MacBeth
regressions.
