Abstract:
The recent appearance of COVID-19 virus has created a global crisis due to unavailability of any vaccine
or drug that can effectively and deterministically work against it. Naturally, different possibilities
(including herbal medicines having known therapeutic significance) have been explored by the scientists.
The systematic scientific study (beginning with in silico study) of herbal medicines in particular and any
drug in general is now possible as the structural components (proteins) of COVID-19 are already
characterized. The main protease of COVID-19 virus is Mpro or 3CLpro which is a key CoV enzyme and
an attractive drug target as it plays a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and transcription. In the
present study, 3CLpro is used to study drug:3CLpro interactions and thus to investigate whether all or any
of the main chemical constituents of Tinospora cordifolia (e.g., berberine (C20H18NO4), -sitosterol
(C29H50O), coline (C5H14NO), tetrahydropalmatine (C21H25NO4) and octacosanol (C28H58O)) can be used
as an anti-viral drug against SARS-CoV-2. The in silico study performed using tools of network
pharmacology, molecular docking including molecular dynamics have revealed that among all considered
phytochemicals in Tinospora cordifolia, berberine can regulate 3CLpro protein's function due to its easy
inhibition and thus can control viral replication. The selection of Tinospora cordifolia was motivated by
the fact that the main constituents of it are known to be responsible for various antiviral activities and the
treatment of jaundice, rheumatism, diabetes, etc.

1. Introduction:
In 2020, with the outbreak of a newly detected corona virus, the whole world is witnessing a
pandemic situation which has put human life in crisis as more than 12400000 numbers of active patients
with 559047 people have already died due to this virus in last couple of months (https://covid19.who.int/).
The viruses, which cause illness in animals and human, coronavirus is the member of that family of
viruses. In human, common cold, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are the different types of respiratory infections which these viruses can
cause (Beadling & Slifka, 2004, de Wit et al., 2016). COVID-19 is the most recently declared disease by
WHO caused by a new member “novel coronavirus” of this virus family (https://www.who.int/, Guo et
al., 2020). Before its outbreak appeared in Wuhan, China, in late December 2019 (Wang et al., 2020; Guan
et al.,2020), this new virus and disease were unknown to the human civilization. On 11 February 2020,
the international committee on taxonomy of viruses declared the new novel coronavirus as “Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2) (Gorbalenya et al., 2020) (originally named 2019nCoV). This virus is part of the Coronaviridae family of virus SARS-CoV having a genome sequences
of 79.5% sequence matching (Graham et al., 2013; van der Hoek et al., 2004). The surface glycoproteins
of this virus creates a crown-like appearance which can be visible under electron microscope. Crown like
spike proteins are the important part of SARS-CoV-2 (Hendaus et al., 2020). It recognizes some specific
human proteins. The human proteins which coats inside of the nose and the cells of lungs are mainly can
interact with the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. After interaction the two proteins bind together.
In the product form, the spike protein of CoV-2 changes its shape and causes the human receptor cell to
engulf the virus. After entering human body, it then replicates itself and can infect neighbouring cells and
tissues by damaging mainly lung, heart, brain cells and many other organs. After few weeks of SARSCoV-2’s appearance in human society, its structural components were characterized. Results are also
available on how the virus targets, interacts with human proteins and how we can fight against it (Jin et
al., 2020), but till date we are searching for the answer to fight against this virus. Till now structural
biologists have identified more than 160 structures of nine various kinds of SERS CoV-2 proteins by Xray crystallography. In human, the principal target of vaccine or drug to act on is the spike protein that
protrudes from the lipid shell of the virus. The infectivity of the virus would be much reduced and maybe
even eliminated if and only if the human immune system are primed to recognize and counteract the spike
protein of SERS CoV 2 (Khan et al., 2020). COVID-19 has now become a pandemic worldwide affecting
mostly all countries globally. It is an infectious disease with a high potential for transmission for human
2

to human close contacts through the respiratory droplets (such as coughing) and by fomites that can
propagate through air at a minimum distance of 1 meter (Rothe et al., 2020). Research works performed
till now suggests that maintaining a distance of more than 1 meter between two individuals which is termed
as ‘social distancing’ or ‘physical distancing’ along with proper hand-hygiene reduces the chance of being
infected by COVID-19. Though there are many predictions about the airborne transmission of this disease,
but until now no scientifically valid evidence is available (Doremalen et al., 2020). Fever, dry cough,
tiredness and less working of sensing organs like testless feeling of food, less sensing of smell etc are the
most common symptoms of COVID-19. These symptoms are appeared usually in mild form and begin
gradually afterwards. Few infected people even become asymptomatic or only have very mild symptoms.
The main point of concern is that till now we don’t have any specific therapies for COVID-19. Research
results regarding the treatment of COVID-19 are not very productive also (Weiss & Murdoch, 2020). As
per current data of July 20th, 2020, over 12401262 cases of COVID-19 active patients have been
confirmed worldwide and over 559047 death cases have been reported so far. Due to nonavailability of
any vaccine or medicine, the supportive care and non-specific treatment to ameliorate the symptoms of
the patient are the only options currently to treat COVID-19 (Salata et al., 2020). However, extensive
research works leading to clinical trials of both western and traditional medicines are going on all over
the world to develop vaccines and medicines to prevent and cure CoV-2 infections (Jin et al., 2020,
Bhardwaj et al, 2020, Rameez et al 2020, Enmozhi et al 2020). To combat COVID-19, some preliminary
research observations have indicated that the combinations of some clinically applied anti-malarial drugs
(e.g., Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine) (Chang et al., 2020, Khan et al., 2020) and anti-HIV vaccines
can be used to treat COVID-19. Also some conventional FDA approved drugs (Remdesivir, Nelfinavir,
Paritaprevir, Raltegravir, Praziquantel, etc.) are being tried as the potential drug against this CoV-2 and
found with certain curative effect in vitro (Hendaus et al., 2020, Khan, Jha, et al., 2020, Wang et al., 2020).
But till no none of the clinically applied drug/vaccine response is found to be very encouraging. Also
toxicity of the currently applied drugs remain an inevitable issue causing serious adverse effects to the
patients (Grein et al., 2020, Wang et al., 2020; Kaisari & Borruat, 2020). In short, no specific therapy,
medicine or vacine for the effective treatment of COVID-19 has yet been reported. This unavailability of
cure to this disease motivated us to investigate the possibility of inhibition of CoV-2 by some
phytoconstituents available from some Indian medicinal plants. It is a well-known fact that in the
treatment of pandemic and endemic diseases, Medicinal herb extracts have accumulated thousands of
years’ experience (Jee et al., 2018; Kumar et al., 2018). To get a valid answer to act against COVID-19,
3

various complementary and alternative vaccine, medicine and treatment methods are also needed for the
managements of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. So research works with different phytoconstituents
from various traditional medicinal herbs is certainly worth of investigation (Khaerunnisa et al 2020) in
this present emergency situation. To deal with this emergency for the present work, we have chosen an
Indian medicinal plant: Guduchi Pippali (Giloy) or Tinospora cordifolia (Figure 1). Tinospora cordifolia
is the member of the family of Menispermaceae. It is usually found in mostly Asian counties like India,
Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and China. The plant is commonly used as a main component in many traditional
Ayurvedic medicines. It is used as a parent medicine for the therapies against several common diseases
like jaundice, rheumatism, urinary disorder, skin diseases, diabetes, anemia, inflammation, allergic
condition, etc. (Sonkamble et al, 2015). For the treatment of helminthiasis, heart diseases, leprosy,
rheumatoid arthritis, etc the stem of the plant is very useful. It also supports the immune system by
increasing the body's resistance to various infections, supports standard white blood cell structure,
function, and levels (Sharma et al 2019). All of the above mentioned pharmacological actions of Tinospora
cordifolia originates from its chemical constituents of different parts like leaves, stem, root, flower, seed
etc. The various categories of chemical constituents of different classes such as alkaloids, glycosides,
steroids, phenolics, aliphatic compounds, polysaccharides essential oils, a mixture of fatty acids, and
polysaccharides are present in different part of the plant body, including root and stem. Phytochemistry
of all these are well documented in the literature (Sharma et al 2019).

Estimation of pharmacological properties of small molecules when it interacts with target protein is
as a crucial step for the drug discovery. We have selected a few small sized phytoconstituents extracted
compounds

from

Tinospora

cordifolia

(https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs).

These

phytoconstituents were selected after applying some proper virtual screening by evaluating their druglikeness, pharmacokinetics and lipophilicity properties which are set of guidelines for identification of
potential drug compounds. After virtual screening, we have evaluated their potential inhibition properties
against CoV-2 main protease by the mechanism of molecular docking. After studying proper binding
affinity of proposed drugs against the target receptor by the Molecular docking, finally we have verified
the drug inhibition with target receptor by different interaction energies like hydrogen bonding,
hydrophobic, coulombic etc by MD simulation approach to validate the applicability of proposed drug
molecule as suggested by Anuj Kumar et al 2020. In vivo estimation of drug molecules is time consuming
and expensive so to deal with the present COVID crisis, in silico methods have become inevitable as we
need an urgent solution of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Important pharmacological information of various chemical constituents have indicated the research
community to explore computational molecular docking and MD methods for investigating the drugprotein interactions. Variety of simulation methods and databases have yet been used for the in-silico
prediction of target drugs (Feixiong et al 2013, Boopathi et al 2020). Many groups are presently working
on different quantum mechanical simulation techniques to search varieties of interacted complex
configurations of different organic and inorganic systems and their interactions with different
environments (Chowdhury et al 2017). We have earlier studied the environmental effects on different
organic probe molecules in view of their applications in various biomedical field (Chowdhury et al 2014).
In the presented study, we have reported some encouraging responses we obtained in terms of inhibition
potentials from some of the tested phytoconstituents of current probe system: Tinospora cordifolia. We
strongly consider that the outputs of the present work will lead to some important insights into the
development of alternative drugs for COVID-19.

2. Materials and Methods:
2.1. Potential Target Protein Structures for SARS-CoV-2
Coronaviruses have positive-sense single-stranded RNA. Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, responsible
for COVID -19 is member of -coronavirus genus (Fehr & Perlman, 2015). CoV-2 contains genome size
of ~30 kilobases. It encodes for various non-structural and structural proteins. The structural protein
components of SARS-CoV-2 comprise: envelope (E), membrane (M), spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N)
(Gorden et al., 2020; Woo et al., 2020). Structure of SARS-CoV-2 has been identified quickly after it first
6

appearance and its genomic sequence is already available (Wu et al., 2020) for us. As the virus has been
discovered very recently so very few available immunological information (immunogenic epitopes
eliciting antibody or T cell responses) about the virus are available until now. It is a fact that until now,
no available therapeutics or approved and tested vaccines/medicine are there to act against any humaninfecting coronaviruses. The newly invented SARS-CoV-2 is very closely related to SARS-CoV
structures. So utilization of this known protein structure can be applicable for quick discovery of drugs
against this newly appeared virus (Jiang et al 2020). It is reported very recently that CoV-2 enters into
host cells by the spike (S) glycoprotein and forms homo trimers protruding from the viral surface (Jin et
al., 2020). This spike protein interacts strongly with the human ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme
2) receptor (Velavan & Meyer, 2020). After entering the host cell, SARS-CoV-2 replicates itself through
some cyclic processes. First it translates its genomic RNA (gRNA). Proteolysis of the translated
polyprotein takes place with viral 3C-like proteinase. After that replication of gRNA takes place. The viral
replication complex appears which consists of RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), helicase, 30-to50 exonuclease, endoRNAse, and 20-O-ribose methyltransferase. Lastly the assembly of viral components
takes place. The proteins (S) which are associated with replication, are the primary targets of post-entry
treatment drugs or vaccine design which can suppress viral replication/infection or neutralizing antibodies
(Abs) upon infection (Gao et al., 2020; Gupta et al., 2020; Khan et al., 2020; Sarma et al., 2020). SARSCoV-2 3C like proteinase is already predicted to bind with different FDA approved antiviral commercially
available drugs like atazanavir, lopinavir, ritonavir, remdesivir, efavirenz and some other antiviral drugs
which have a predicted affinity with clear efficacy value of Kd > 100 nM potency (Hendaus et al., 2020,
Khan, Jha, et al., 2020). Prediction suggests that viral proteinase targeting drugs should act very efficiently
on the viral replication process. In support of the prediction, it was reported by the docking study of some
HIV proteinase inhibitors of the CoV proteinase that lopinavir, atazanavir and ritonavir may inhibit the
CoV proteinase (Dayer et al 2017). Like lopinavir, atazanavir and ritonavir there are some other case
studies also with other inhibitor drugs like hydroxyxhloroquine, remidisivir etc., but until now there is no
real evidence about whether these drugs can act efficiently as predicted against COVID-19. Traditional
drug discovery usually takes years of research and trial. Now the whole world is dealing with an
emergency situation with an urgent need of required drug against this virus to save the infected lives. An
alternative approach to complement the existing procedure and to combat this problem can be to use the
computer aided drug design (CADD) or computer-assisted structure-based drug design (SBDD). For the
present work, some particular type of SBDD approaches have been implemented. Specifically, we tried
7

here the in silico docking model and MD simulation approaches to search for medication of COVID-19
by using two most variable viral proteins (I, II) SARS-CoV-2 protease enzyme Mpro or 3CLpro as the
receptor (Figure 3a,b).

3CLpro is a key to SERS-CoV enzyme. CoV 3CLpro is responsible for the maturation of itself and
the subsequent maturation of the replicate polyproteins. This protein has a conserved catalytic domain.
The protein can control functions of the virus like: replication and transcription processes. Such important
functionalities of 3CLpro makes it an ideal target for drug development (Anand et al 2003). Also due to its
viral life cycle and the absence of closely related homologues in human, the 3CLpro protease has become
most attractive receptor protein for antiviral drug design. Recently 3D structure of one of the 3CLpro like
protease protein is reported by X-Ray crystallographic data (PDBID: 6LU7) (Jin et al., 2020). Protease
proteins are essential to the transmission and virulence of the virus. For an effective therapy, by inhibiting
these protease proteins with proper drug inhibitor, the severity of the infection can definitely be reduced.
We have tried to check the inhibiting and binding possibilities of two of these natural 3CLpro like protease
protein substrates in order to find the possibilities of effective drug design for COVID-19 in the present
work.

2.2 Protein Receptors Preparation
In this work we have used two CoV-2 3CLpro main proteases as target of the potential drug
molecules. The proteases used are: protease in complex with an inhibitor N3 (PDBID: 6LU7) (Jin et al.,
2020, Zhang et al 2020) referred to as I and the other one is protease bound to potent broad-spectrum noncovalent inhibitor X77 (PDBID: 6W63) referred to as II (Mesecar et al 2020). The 3D structures of both
were downloaded from the Protein Data Bank (https://www.rcsb.org/) and are shown in (Figure 3a,b)
without added water and hydrogen. All the available required properties of these proteins are described
in Table SD1. At the beginning of the present investigation, all protein structures have been cleaned by
removing the existing lead components. Also the existing water molecules and ions have been removed
from protein structures. After cleaning, Gasteiger charges of protein structures have been calculated and
procedure of inclusion of polar hydrogens have been performed. Then subsequently the merging of nonpolar and rotatable bonds were defined. All of the above mentioned steps have been performed by Auto
Dock and MG Tools of Auto DockVina software (Trott et al 2010). Lastly the inbuilt ligands were
removed from the protein molecules using Discovery studio 2020 (Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA) and the
cleaned and final proteins structures were saved in PDB format. Active amino acid residues which will
be involved in mediating enzyme activity for protein-ligand interaction were predicted for each target
protein using Ramachandran plot (Figure 3a,b) by visualizing the dihedral angles ψ against φ of amino
acid residues. This two-dimensional plot shows the allowed and disfavoured values of ψ and φ. In the
9

present work for our target 3CLpro proteins, each plot specifies localization on the A chain residues.
This localization determines the quality of the protein structure. Good quality reflects the efficient and
accurate docking possibilities. In the present work, the Ramachandran plot for both the target proteins
show good localization of residues which are the indication of good probable docking results.

2.3 Ligand drug molecules Preparations
For drug discovery, estimating required in vivo and in silico pharmacological properties of proposed
small sized molecules are reflected as a very essential step. In vivo estimation is expensive and time
consuming and so in present scenario in silico methods have become certain. For in silico estimation the
process is known as virtual screening. In virtual screening different Drug-likeness rules (a set of guidelines
for the determination of structural properties of proposed drug compounds) are used for preliminary
screening of required drug-like properties of a molecule. Some mostly industry applicable drug-likeness
rules are: Lipinski's rule, MDDR-like rule, Veber’s rule, Ghose filter, Egan rule, Muegge rule etc. Out of
these different methods (rules), one of the dominant method is Lipinski's rule of five (Ro5) which is known
as “a rule of thumb”. It is used to evaluate if a proposed chemical compound possesses certain required
pharmacological properties which would make the compound a potential candidate for orally active drug
in humans (Lipinski et al 2004). Candidate drugs that imitate Ro5, usually have an increased chance of
reaching the market since they tend to have lower attrition rates during clinical trials. Ro5, with its filters
(Molecular weight 500, H-bond donors5, H-bond acceptor10, MLOGP4.15, molar refractivity
should be between 30-140) helps in distinguishing between non-drug like and drug like molecules which
helps to circumvent preclinical and clinical failures by early preclinical development of drugs. We have
done the virtual screening of our proposed drug molecules by applying most of the above mentioned druglikeness rules (Veber et al 2002) including some other screening properties like polar surface area (Daina
et al., 2017), physicochemical properties, pharmacokinetics, lipophilicity, synthetic accessibility etc
(Table 1). ADME (Adsorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excreation) is important technique to
analyze the pharmacodynamics of the proposed drug molecule. SWISS-ADME software
(https://www.swissadme.ch) helps us to identify proposed drug molecule by applying different virtual
screening methods. Different components of lipophilicity (iLOGP, WLOGP, XLOGP3, MLOGP, Log
Po/w), water solubility (Log S (SILICOS-IT)), pharmacokinetics (GI absorption, BBB permeant, P-gp
substrate, Log (Kp)) also help us to preliminary test the suitable drug molecule. For choosing the proposed
drug molecules through virtual screening, sometimes we found some of them have violated some selection
10

rules like Ro5, Veber etc. In drug industry today there are several important drugs available in market who
violate some likeness rules. Some very popular drugs like dabigitran etexilate, bromocriptine mesylate,
olmesartan medoxomil, fosinapril, and reserpine etc revealed two Ro5 rule violations (Giacomini et al
2010). Some very popular tyrosine kinase inhibitors (e.g. lapatinib and nilotinib) and HIV protease
inhibitors (e.g., lopinavir, atazanavir, nelfinavir) do not follow the Ro5 criteria. Atazanavir exhibits three
Ro5 violations. Keeping all these points in mind we have considered some natural compounds as our
potential inhibitors for 3CLpro protease although some of them violate one or two criteria of Ro5 but
validate other criteria. After thoroughly testing the proposed phytoconstituents by all mentioned virtual
screening of drug-likeness properties we have tested the drug binding possibilities with target 3CLpro main
proteases by molecular docking and further MD simulation mechanisms. Specifically, based on the
positive responses from virtual screening, we have selected five phytoconstituents from Tinospora
cordifolia as potential ligand drugs: berberine (C20H18NO4), choline (C5H14NO) and tetrahydropalmatine
(C21H25NO4) from the group of alkaloids, -sitosterol (C29H50O) from steroids, octacosanol (C28H58O)
from aliphatic group. Details of the structure of these molecules were downloaded from Drug Bank in pdb
format and are described in Figure 2 and Table 1(a-e)

along with their various chemical, physical,

pharmakokinetics and drug likeness properties obtained from SWISS ADME. All 2D and 3D view of the
proposed ligands were obtained from Drugbank website. For octacosanol we have used Gaussian
supported Gaussview to draw 3D structure (Figure 2). All of our proposed drug molecules have molecular
weight less than 500 g /mol. All of them have TPSA values less than 50 Å². All drug molecules have Hbond donors5, H-bond acceptor10. All of the proposed drug molecules have synthetic accessibility
count between less than 10 so that they can be synthesized easily. Though -sitosterol and octacosanol
have violated some of the drug likeness properties, still we have consider these phytoconstituents as
potential inhibitors due to their availability in drug industry. For example, octacosanol is used as a
probable therapeutic agent for treating Parkinson's disease. It also possess antiaggregatory properties and
cholesterol-lowering effects. It is used as a component of Ginsamin Power as a tablet from Biogrand Co.,
Ltd (https://www.drugbank.ca/). It has passed the clinical trial also for the treatment of high Cholesterol
condition (Taylor et al 2003). For Molecular docking study, the ligand file is required in pbdqt format.
These ligand drug molecules have been saved in pdbqt format by Auto Dock Tools 1.5.6 (Michel et al
1999).

2.4. Molecular docking and Visualization
Molecular docking predicts the potential drug-target interactions by energy minimization and
binding energy calculations. Interaction between small molecules (ligand) and protein receptor (may be
an enzyme) creates the possibility of inhibition of ligand towards receptor enzyme. So output of
molecular docking can demonstrate the feasibility of any biochemical reaction. It can also predict an
optimized orientation of ligand towards the target receptor. By different binding modes of ligand with
target receptor, docking result may provide a raw material for the rational drug designing. In combination
with scoring function, Molecular docking method is used for finding more potent, selective and efficient
drug candidates. The docking algorithm performs through some cyclical processes. The cyclic process by
specific scoring functions helps to identify the suitable ligand conformation. After reaching to a minimum
energy, the process converges to a solution (Yuriev et al 2011). Docking mechanism uses inhibitor drug’s
binding properties with nucleic acid of target protein. The binding property establishes a correlation
between drug’s molecular structure and cytotoxicity. Molecular docking can also predict whether the
ligand/drug is docked with the receptor protein/DNA or not. Docking algorithm gives output in the form
of quantitative predictions of binding energetics by providing the rankings of docked compounds. The
ranking is based on the binding affinity of ligand: receptor complexes. The best confirmation of the ligand:
receptor complex is that or those which has/have lower binding energy. After getting positive prediction,
further experimental procedures are applied to the development of new drug molecule. Docking-based
studies on the suggested inhibitors onto the protease of CoV-2 through Receptor: ligand docking analysis
was performed using AutoDock Vina (Trott et al 2010). The macromolecule (protein) file is saved in
pdbqt format by Auto Dock Tools (Trott et al 2010) and ready to be used for docking. Similarly the ligand
molecule has been saved in pdbqt format by Auto Dock Tools. For AutoDock Vina algorithm, for setting
up the configuration file following parameters were used: (i) count of binding modes- 9; (ii)
exhaustiveness - 8 and (iii) applied maximum energy difference- 3 kcal/mol. Ligand centered maps were
generated and Gridbox center was set to coordinate x y, and z of residue position of the target protein
respectively.
Out of all the possible poses (optimized ligand: protein complex structure) suggested by simulation
according to the binding modes, the pose showing maximum hydrogen bonds and minimum binding
affinity(kcal/mol), were chosen as the best ligand: protein complex structure formed by ligand-receptor
interaction. For choosing the best possible ligand: protein complex structure we have taken the help of
12

root means square deviation (RMSD) method. For RMSD evaluation only movable heavy atoms (ligand)
were considered to identify the best mode. Two variants of RMSD: RMSD/lb (lower bound) and
RMSD/ub (upper bound) were used here for the whole simulation. The two variants differ in how the
atoms are matched in the distance calculations. For the distance for upper bound is considered when the
ligand has no symmetry as RMSD/ub matches each atom in a conformation with itself in the other
conformation ignoring any symmetry. We have used RMSD/ub as the ligand molecules have no specific
symmetry. Another criteria of choosing best ligand: protein pose is identifying the types and number of
bonding between them. The metabolite which makes maximum number of H-bonds, hydrophobic bonds
with the receptor protein mostly show better capability to form ligand: protein complex formation by
intermolecular interaction between inhibitor and receptor. Different output poses were analysed in
Discovery Studio visualizer 2020 version 20.1.0.19295 (Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA) for the formation of
non-bonded hydrogen bonds. The best pose structure was analysed also by their binding affinity, inhibition
constants and other supporting interactions.

2.5. MD Simulations
At atomistic level, MD simulation results helped us to investigate the structural dynamics of
receptor CoV-2 protease (3CLpro) upon binding with small ligand (proposed drug) molecule. LINUX
based platform ‘‘GROMACS 5.1 Package’’ (Berendsen et al., 1995) was used for determination of
thermodynamics stability of the proposed ligand: protein complex. MD simulations were performed using
latest CHARMM36 all atom force field (Soteras et al 2016). Before simulation, separate topologies were
prepared for receptor and ligand by different external tools (Gajula et al 2016). For our ligand, before
creating the topology first we have optimized the ligand structure by Gaussian 9.0 by Density Functional
Theory (DFT) with the basis set 6.31G (d,p) (Becke et al 1997, Frisch et al 2004). With the optimized
structure we have generated the ligand topology with the CHARMM General Force Field (CGenFF)
program (Vanommeslaeghe et al 2012). In CHARMM all-atom force field, all H atoms of ligand are
explicitly

represented.

For

topology

we

have

used

the

cgenff_charmm2gmx.py

(http://mackerell.umaryland.edu/charmm_ff.shtml#gromacs). To perform simulations in aqueous
solution, we have used a well known water model: TIP3P. During solvation process the bare protein and
protein: ligand complex were solvated in the cubic box having specific boundary conditions (with 10 Å
buffer distance) with volume as 893,000 Å3. As per procedure 4Na+ ions were added for electrically
neutralizing the probe system. Before simulation we have done the energy minimization on the system to
sort out any bad starting structures and also to minimize solute structure in vacuum before introducing
solvent molecules. The Protein ligand complex system was equilibrated under suitable simulation
parameters consistent for our selected CHARMM General Force Field for building the energy minimized
solvated system. The steepest descent algorithm has been used for energy minimization of the system with
varying time (ps) for 500,000 iteration steps. For reducing the steric clashes, the applied algorithm has a
cut-off up to 1000 kJmol−1 (Kumar et al 2020). The MD simulation has started with the minimization of
the system. The minimization has been achieved at two phases each having 500,000 steps. In first part,
equilibration was obtained having each step of 2 fs with a boundary condition of constant number of
particles (N), volume (V), and temperature (T). We have used 10000-ps NVT equilibration. In second
phase, the equilibration was achieved under the pressure of 1 atmosphere 298K. Here the boundary
condition maintained as constant NPT (particle numbers, pressure, temperature). Such condition is known
as isothermal-isobaric ensemble. Energy minimization data and output of MD simulation data helped us
to visualize several thermodynamic parameters like potential energy, kinetic energy, total energy,
temperature, density progression, radius of gyration, RMSD, RMSF, SASA, etc. of the bare host protein
15

and ligand: receptor complex. For equilibration step computation, for covalent bond constraints LINCS
algorithm was applied. To quantify strength of interaction between ligand and protein it is useful to
compute the nonbonded interaction energy between two species rather than calculating free energy of the
system. For the nonbonded energy calculation we have used short range Lennard-Jones and Coulomb
interaction energies. For these calculation we have maintained a 1.4 nm radius cut-off. For long range
electrostatics calculation Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) method was used having 1.6Å of Fourier grid
spacing. Berendsen temperature coupling method (V-rescale ) has been used for maintaining inside box
temperature. NPT equilibration has been achieved by Parrinello-Rahman pressure coupling method. The
time parameter has been fixed to 10000 ps with each step of 0.002 fs for the final step of simulation. After
final step of each simulation, trajectories were obtained. Obtained trajectories and results were analysed
using the graphical tool Origin pro. Least-square fitting method was used to evaluate RMSD for protein
backbone. Similarly, RMSF was obtained for protein C backbone. The compactness factor of protein was
calculated by radius of gyration (Rg). According to rule if the protein or complex structure is stable then
the radius of gyration should maintain a stable value. To compute total solvent accessible surface area
(SASA) the tool sasa was used. SASA measures the area of receptor exposure to the solvents during the
simulation process. Number of hydrogen bonds and distribution of intermolecular hydrogen bond lengths
were calculated with maintaining 3.5Å distance cut-off condition throughout the simulation.

2.6. Computational Details
Dell Gen9 server with 8 Core I7 processors and 16 GB of RAM with GPU NVIDIA MX130 was
used for the MD simulations and corresponding energy calculations.

3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Virtual screening and Molecular Docking analysis
Each expected ligand drug molecule was docked to CoV- 2 3CL main protease (3CLPRO). We have
to keep in mind that docking algorithm is nondeterministic in nature. The minimum of scoring function
cannot be identified by docking algorithm for a fixed receptor: ligand complex conformation. Table SD1
shows the structure of possible ligands found in the active site pockets of 3CLPRO proteins I and II.
Molecular docking is used to find out interaction of tested inhibitors: berberine, -sitosterol, choline,
16

tetrahydropalmatine and octacosanol with both 3CLPRO proteins I and II. The organic compound berberine
(C20H18NO4) can be extracted from Hydrastis canadensis L., Berberidaceae. It is also known as
protoberberine alkaloids. Berberine is usually found in the roots, rhizomes, stems, and bark. One of the
main source of berberine is Tinospora cordifolia. It can be found in other plants also. Berberine is used
as a natural dye with a color index of 75160. Due to its strong yellow fluorescence, it is useful in histology
for staining heparin in mast cells. Berberine is relatively toxic parenterally, but still it is used as oral drug
for the treatment of various parasitic and fungal infections. It is also used a drug for antidiarrheal diseases
(Dewick et al 2009). -sitosterol (C29H50O) has a structural similarity with cholesterol. It is used to reduce
cholesterol levels in the body. It is used as a constituents in many drugs for reduction of swelling. Being
a steroid, β-sitosterol is a precursor of anabolic steroid boldenone (Wang et al 2008). Octacosanol
(C28H58O) is basically an alcohol “straight-chain aliphatic 28-carbon primary fatty alcohol” which is used
health industry as a nutritional supplement. It has been studied as a potential therapeutic agent for the
treatment of Parkinson's disease (Rudkowska et al 2008). Octacosanol is reported to possess cholesterollowering effects, antiaggregatory properties and ergogenic properties. Tetrahydropalmatine (C21H25NO4)
has a role as an adrenergic agent, a non-narcotic analgesic and a dopaminergic antagonist.
Tetrahydropalmatine is under investigation in clinical trial for the Treatment of Schizophrenia (Taylor et
al 2003). Choline (C5H14NO) is a nutrient that supports various bodily functions, including cellular growth
and metabolism. It is also used for DNA synthesis and nervous system maintenance (Corbin et al 2012).
Candidate drugs that confirm to the Ro5 and other drug likeness rules etc. used to have lower
attrition rates during clinical trials and hence have shown their strong candidature as potential drugs
reaching the market (Table 1a-e). Berberine, choline and tetrahydropalmatine were satisfying the most
prescribed virtual screening properties. Auto Dock Vina, the docking software uses free-energy scoring
function based on a linear regression analysis to identify the best binding mode prediction for protein:
ligand complexation. It identifies the best possible pose structure from a set of diverse protein-ligand
complexes with a highest negative value of binding energy and lowest value of inhibition constant.
Docking simulation results have helped us to find out the best possible interacted protein: ligand poses of
different proposed inhibitor drugs. For the first tested inhibitor berberine with 3CLpro protein I (6LU7),
berberine: 6LU7 complex revealed 9 different poses based on their binding affinity, drieding energy,
dipole moment, inhibition constant etc. According to molecular docking simulation protocol the pose with
highest negative values of binding energy, lowest value of complex driending energy usually indicates
maximum binding affinity for the ligand: receptor complex formation (Table 2).

Table 2. Binding mode of each ligand:protein (Berberine: 6LU7) complex using molecular docking for
Protein (I).
For pose 2 we obtained the better interacted position for ligand: protein complex with the binding affinity
of -7.3 kcal/mol which is lower than highly tested COVID 19 drug chloroquine (-6.29 kcal/mol). To verify
that this the best docked site we have also computed the Dreiding energy of different poses which consider
the Dreiding force field to calculate the energy of a specific complex structure by summing energy
components like bond lengths, bond angles, dihedral angles (Mayo et al 1990). The Dreiding energy values
for individual protein and ligand are different but when they form complex the Dreiding energy becomes
minimum for most favourable structure. We obtained the lowest value of energy (415.725) for the pose 2
of the complex structure (Table 3). To validate the better interaction between berberine and 6LU7, we
have computed the inhibition constant (ki) which is an indication of how potent berberine as inhibitor
towards 6LU7. It is the concentration to produce half maximum inhibition. To evaluate the inhibition
constant we have used relation as
ki  e

 G RT 

………….(1)

Where G is the binding affinity, R the universal constant and T (298 K) the room temperature.
For the best pose (2) structure of berberine: 6LU7 complex, the ki value obtained at room temperature
(298 K) as 4.4 x10-6 M which proves the higher affinity of berberine towards receptor 6LU7 (Table 3).
The computed ki value is far lower than the toxicity dose range of berberine as proposed drug (Table 1)
which validate the strong candidature of berberine as target drug to attach 6LU7. The berberine: 6LU7
18

interaction energy further verified by the dipole moment values of ligand and target (Table 3). The strong
interaction for pose 2 was further verified by the number of weak nonbonded hydrogen bonded
interactions and hydrophobic interactions present between protein and ligand in the optimized protein:
ligand complex structure. Hydrogen bonded interaction and hydrophobic interaction due to their weak
nature have significant roles in stabilizing the energetically-favored ligands in a suitable pocket of the
environment of protein structures. It is a proven fact that weak interactions “hydrogen bonding and
hydrophobic interactions” always stabilize the ligands at the target protein site by altering the binding
affinity (Patil et al 2010). We observed the presence of intermolecular hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic
interaction between protein (Residues: THR25, SER46, HIS163) and berberine in its pose 2 which means
better interaction between donor and acceptor moiety. We have repeated the molecular docking
simulation of berberine with other 3Lpro protein II also and obtained the best ligand: protein complex
structure with binding affinity of -7.7 kcal/mol and inhibition constant of 2.23 x10-6M (Table SD3). For
best poses of berberine: protein complexs, the donor–acceptor surface and different possible interactions
are shown in Figure (4a, b) in 3D and 2D view.

We have repeated same molecular docking approach for other ligand structures : -sitosterol,
octacosanol, Tetrahydropalmatine, Choline with protein I, protein II and have identified their best possible
20

ligand: protein interaction pose position in terms of their best binding affinity value, Dreiding energy,
dipole moment, inhibition constants, number of hydrogen bond, hydrophobic bond etc. and mentioned
them all in Table 3,SD3 and Figure (5a,b) and Figure SD2 in 3D and 2D view. From the molecular
docking results for every suggested drug molecule, with their best possible ligand: target complex
structures i.e., for best pose, the donor–acceptor surface with their possible hydrogen bonding and
hydrophobic interactions are shown in Figure (SD2a,b) in 3D and 2D view. Our screening identified that
out of five possible bioactive ligand structures, berberine shows the best potentiality to inhibit with the
CoV-2 enzymes (3Lpro): I and II by its best docking affinity compared to the other ligands against 3Lpro.
Berberine: 3Lpro complex has shown less binding energy, minimum inhibition constant value as compared
to other proposed drug molecules with its good binding mode of interactions. After berberine the binding
affinity followed by -sitosterol, octacosanol, Tetrahydropalmatine, Choline. Simulation results also
revealed that all five proposed drug molecules showed good stability as a complex with the targeted 3Lpro
protease. These inhibitors also satisfy the required drug likeness properties according to Ro5, Veber etc
rules including their molar refractivities, pharmakokinetics, polar surface areas and logP values. All of the
reported potential natural phytoconstituent drug compounds are commercially available in drug industry
and so can be easily available for further in vivo/in vitro validations. We are hopeful that the information
generated from this present study will definitely be utilized for the development of phytochemical based
therapeutics against COVID-19. Since berberine shows the better possibility of inhibition towards 3CLpro
protease we have further studied the applicability of berberine as potential drug molecule by applying
rigorous MD simulation approach.

3.2 MD Simulation analysis
For obtaining dynamic data at atomic spatial resolution, MD simulation is a verified in silico method
which can simulate in picoseconds/nanoseconds or further finer temporal steadfastness (Benson &
Daggett, 2012; Gajula et al., 2016). The complex (berberine: 6LU7) formed by main protein protease
(6LU7) docked with phytochemical compound (berberine) has been studied under this simulation for
10000 ps to 100 ps period to analyze the stability of the studied structure. For MD simulation to work
every structure (receptor and complex) have to be optimized by energy minimization process. For
energetically minimized structure the potential energy should be minimum and negative with a maximum
force value. We have obtained energetically minimized structures for both probe (protein and complex)
systems (Figure. 6). For both the cases we have obtained steady convergence of potential energy. The
analyzation and comparison of the potential energy (Epot) of the stabilized structure of 6LU7 protein in its
bare state and in berberine: 6LU7 complex form have been done rigorously. 6LU7 has an average energy
of -1.27x106 56.7 (kJ mol-1 ) for Epot, while the complex has an averaged Epot of -0.2 x 106  38.77 (kJ
mol-1 ). With their lowest Epot values both systems at an energy minimum level and ready real Molecular
Dynamics. To check further, optimized structures of 3CLpro protease and complex structures have been
equilibrated by NVT and NPT ensembles to stabilized temperature, pressure, density, volume etc within
a time scale trajectory of between 100 ps – 10000 ps. Analysing the temperature progression data (Figure
SD4) with an running average value of 10 ps, it was observed that after starting the simulation process,
the temperature of the system quickly reached the stable room temperature value (298 K) with maintaining
the temperature stability throughout the whole equilibration process. This is the reason for bare protein
system, a shorter equilibration period (on the order of 50 ps/100 ps) have been applied. The applicability
of shorter equilibration period have been also verified by pressure and density data (Figure SD5) with
same running average value of 10 ps. Also we have observed a very stable values of density and pressure
over the period of time trajectory. From the stability of temperature, pressure and density values it was
justified to conclude that the system is well-equilibrated with respect to temperature, pressure and density
and are ready for MD simulation. We have studied various thermodynamic parameters of host protein and
complex system by MD simulation data for various time trajectory. The important thermodynamic
parameters we have studied are the RMSD, RMSF, inter-molecular H- bonds, Rg, SASA, potential energy,
kinetic energy, total energy and various nonbonded interaction energies to understand the stability and
possible conformational changes of the bare state of CLpro receptor protein and in the berberine: 6LU7
23

complex at each frame of the time resolved simulation trajectory. All MD simulated output of bare protein
and protein: ligand complex for the time resolved trajectories have been presented in Table 4.

kJ mol-1 with a minor fluctuations

between-1.8 x10 5 kJ mol-1 and-1.7 x105 kJ mol-1 which validate the good stability of both bare protein
and its complex structures for the whole time trajectory (Figure SD 6,7). The variation of total energy of
the complex due to its kinetic energy and potential energy components is shown in Figure 7.

Figure 7: Total energy of berberine: 6LU7 Complex structure in time scale 1000 ps.
Protein backbone RMSD (Figure. 8) of bare protein was observed to be fluctuating between 0.08 and
0.16 nm with an average value of 0.12 nm. In presence of compound berberine after complex formation
berberine: 6LU7, RMSD showed a stable and constant range between 0.08 nm to 0.18 nm with an average
value of 0.16 nm. The obtained average RMSD for complex is comparatively slightly higher than the
RMSD of bare protein backbone. The complex RMSD data and bare background protein have been
compared with the crystal structures for both the configuration. With full time scale range the obtained
RMSD variation levels up to ~0.1 nm for both bare protein and protein: ligand complex indicating the
stability of both the structures. Subtle differences between the plots of gaseous structure and crystal
structure indicated minor structural difference at t = 0 ps. This minor difference in structures is very much
25

expected since for energy-minimized structures position restraints can never be 100% perfect. Comparing
the differences of protein backbone RMSDs for bare CLpro protein structure with berberine: protein
complex structure suggest that CLpro has shown no significant change in presence of berberine during time
resolved simulation. Whereas the RMSD of complex (berberine: 6LU7) has indicated several fluctuations
at different time intervals on 10000 ps time scale. These fluctuations may arise due to the changed
conformation in binding region of CLpro (Figure SD8). In the full time scale intervals, the first stable
structure was observed between 1645 ps to 2860 ps, second one is observed between 3574 ps to 6372 ps
and the third one is between 6523 ps to 8753 ps. Throughout the whole time trajectory, in the stable region
the RMSD remain constant at 0.5 nm whereas for large fluctuation regions the observed RMSD was more
than 0.6 nm. The fluctuations were observed between 0 ps to 1644 ps, 2861 ps to 3573 ps and 6373 ps to
1000 ps.

Figure 8: Root mean square Deviation (RMSD) backbone graphs of 6LU7 in its bare state and in
complex with berberine. Complex structure is compared with its crystal form also.
The above observation also confirmed by the RMSF plots of C for both the bare protein and its complex
where local changes were observed with variation of residues numbers (Figure 9). For bare protein 6LU7,
RMSF value for each residue was simulated and averaged for the entire time trajectory and identification
has been done for more flexible regions responsible for the conformational changes. In simulated RMSF
graph of bare 6LU7, major fluctuations in peaks have been observed with the residues positions between
26

50-80 and the tail region of the protein with the residue number around 280. The fluctuations in RMSF
values were observed between 0.13 nm and 0.23 nm. For berberine: 6LU7 complex, the major fluctuations
in peaks were observed initially around residue number at 50 and in between140–200 values, with
fluctuations around 0.23 nm. The RMSF data suggest that all active and flexible residues of 6LU7 get
stabilized due to binding of berberine for the complex formation, which hints the possibility of inhibitory
activity of the ligand towards receptor protein without affecting the protein structure. From the detailed
RMSD and RMSF analysis we can conclude that protein backbone of 6LU7 in presence of berberine was
not affected much and that why the behaviour of protein or structure of protein during simulation remain
mostly unaltered. (Figure. 9).

To get an idea about the binding strength in between ligand and protein for protein: ligand complex,
hydrogen bonding plays a crucial role. Ligand berberine has constant range of intermolecular hydrogen
bonding with receptor protein between 0 to 2 in throughout the whole simulation process with an average
value 0.26. This result validate the nonexistence of any type of conformational change around berberine
during the complexation in the binding site throughout simulation process (Figure 10). The intermolecular
hydrogen bond number computed through MD simulation over the full time scale trajectory perfectly
matches with the docking results also. Over all observation suggested that the berberine: 6LU7 complex
is stable during simulation.

Figure 10: Intermolecular hydrogen bond numbers between berberine and 6LU7 in their complex
(berberine: 6LU7) form for the full scale time trajectory.

The radius of gyration (Rg) measurement of a protein ligand complex or basic backbone protein are used
to determine the compactness of the system with the time. For stably folded protein structures, Rg value
always like to maintain a relatively steady value for full time scale. For unfolded proteins, Rg always
changes over the time. Again for less compactness in the structures with conformational entropy exhibits
higher Rg values, while high compactness with more stability in the structure exhibits a low Rg value. For
the present case, Rg values of both complex and base protein structures are reported in between 2.25-2.26
nm with an average value of 2.225 nm (Figure 11) which exhibited the stability of both bare protein and
protein: ligand complex form. Small variation in Rg values also revealed that the binding of berberine
towards binding site of 6LU7 does not induce any change in the parent CLpro protein structure and establish
the condensed stable architecture, size of the berberine: 6LU7 complex form (Fig 10). For the current
paper we have shown the values over the time scale of 100 ps. The three major anti COVID-19 drugs
Remdesivir Saquinavir and Darunavir also reported as showing the average Rg score values as 2.2 0.1
nm (Khan et al. (2020)) which are exactly matching with our computed data for our proposed drug
berberine.

28

Further to validate the applicability of berberine as proposed drug for COVID-19 we have computed
the SASA of our proposed berberine: 6LU7 complex structure. SASA measures the area of receptor
exposure to the solvents during the simulation process. We obtained the SASA value of receptor protein
between 19 – 26 nm2. The exposures of the hydrophobic part of receptor residues due to the binding of
the ligand molecule towards receptor always contribute to SASA value. In the present work for both bare
6LU7 and berberine: 6LU7 complex, the computed values of SASA values were observed between 146156 nm2 which justified that ligand binding does not affect the folding of the receptor protein very much.
So we may conclude that berberine: 6LU7 complex is very stable structure due to the binding of berberine
with 6LU7 CLpro protein.

Figure 11 : Total radius of gyration of bare 6LU7 and berberine:6LU7 for the time trajectory 1000 ps.

To quantify the strength of the interaction between berberine and CLpro protease, it is always useful
to compute the short-range nonbonded interaction energy between these two species which is far better
than free energy or a binding energy. For protein ligand system, for free or binding energy simulation
techniques, the mostly used force fields are not parametrized and so the obtained energies are in most
cases become actually physically not meaningful. Whereas for nonbonded interaction energy simulation,
the used force fields are parametrized to specifically target quantum mechanical interaction energies with
29

water, so it is intrinsically balanced against meaningful quantities, and so the nonbonded interaction
energy shows meaningful interpretation. For interaction energy computation we are interested in
Coulombic short range protein ligand interaction energy terms and Lennard Jones short range protein
ligand interaction energy terms. The total interaction energy is obtained by using these two energy values.

Figure 12 : Total nonbonded interaction energy between 6LU7 and berberine in their complex form for
the time trajectory 1000 ps. Total energy is the combination of Coulombic and Lennard Jones interaction
energies.

The obtained total interaction energy for the berberine: 6LU7 complex is shown by the 3D figure 12. We
have obtained total interaction energy for the berberine: 6LU7 conformation in every 1000 ps time gap.
The average short-range Coulombic interaction energy component compared with complex 51.7714 3.8
kJ mol-1 has less effect on binding affinity, whereas the average short-range Lennard-Jones energy is 130.261 1.1kJ mol-1 has shown strong effect on binding affinity. The total interaction energy after
propagating the error according to the standard formula for addition of two quantities appeared as -186.95
5.1kJ mol-1. The low region of the 3D view of the time trajectory of interaction energy perfectly matches
30

with the RMSD stable regions of the complex form and high region matches with the fluctuations of the
RMSD time scale trajectory regions. All the above mentioned MD simulations data validated the good
inhibition possibility of berberine towards the target CLpro protease 6LU7.

4. Conclusion:
Traditional medicinal plants are considered as a great source of input for the treatment of various
diseases. For current study, we have studied the applicability of antiviral potential of some
phytoconstituents extracted from a specific medicinal plant: Tinospora cordifolia against SARS-CoV-2
infections. Tinospora cordifolia is the source of various type of bioactive compounds including alkaloids,
steroids, glycosides, aliphatics. Spotlight of the current study is to find an essential drug for the COVID19
disease using the antiviral activity of these compounds. Summarizing the docking and MD simulation
results and interpreting the various thermodynamics parameters like temperature, pressure, density, root
mean square deviation, root mean square fluctuations, inter-molecular hydrogen bonds, solvent accessible
surface area, radius of gyration, potential energy, kinetic energy, total energy and interaction energies for
non bonded interactions like hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, short range interactions with
their analysis plots helps us to identify the best inhibitor potential drug for SERS CoV-2. The best binding
docking

poses

of

virtually

screened

phytochemicals

berberine,

-sitosterol,

octacosanol,

tetrahydropalmatine, choline from the parent herb Tinospora cordifolia with that of the selected 3CLpro
targets I, II of main protease enzymes suggest the promising potential of these molecules to be used as
raw drug material. Molecular docking and MD analysis have revealed that berberine having less binding
energy and higher nonbonded interaction capability as compared to other molecules with its good binding
mode of interactions. Simulation results have also revealed that berberine: 3CLpro docked complex
established better stability and can act as better inhibitor towards the CoV-2 protein compared to other
inhibitors. All the reported phytochemical compounds in the present work are natural and commercially
available as drugs. The present work suggests that among all the proposed phytochemicals extracted from
Tinospora cordifolia, berberine has established its strong candidature to serve as potential inhibitors in
regulating the 3CLpro protein's function and further controlling against viral replication. Our results are
expected to grab the attention of the researchers in the field of new drug discovery against SERS-CoV-2
for which till date no specific drugs or vaccines are available. The approach adopted here is general in
nature and similar approach may be used to investigate the potential applications of other medicinal herbs
31

and available drugs against COVID-19. In addition, the study may be extend to more precise investigation
of protein-drug interaction using different quantum mechanical simulation methods like TDDFT, HF with
modern tools like ONIOM which will help us to identify optimized and energetically favored drug:targetprotein complex structures. However, such a task is computationally demanding and requires more
computational resources and time. In a future communication, we would like to extend our work in that
direction, so that if a clinical trial of the drug molecules studied here is aimed the same can be started with
more confidence. Finally, we conclude this paper with a word caution that before using any outcome of
an in silico study, proper in-vivo and in-vitro rigorous research works are to be performed.
