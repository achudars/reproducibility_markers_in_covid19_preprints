Abstract
Calibration of a SIR (Susceptibles-Infected-Recovered) model with official international data for the COVID-19 pandemics provides a good
example of the difficulties inherent the solution of inverse problems.
Inverse modeling is set up in a framework of discrete inverse problems,
which explicitly considers the role and the relevance of data. Together
with a physical vision of the model, the present work addresses numerically the issue of parameters calibration in SIR models, it discusses
the uncertainties in the data provided by international authorities, how
they influence the reliability of calibrated model parameters and, ultimately, of model predictions.

Keywords: Inverse problems; Mathematical modelling; Model calibration;

Introduction

Epidemic modeling is usually performed with compartmental models, often
called SIR (Susceptibles-Infected-Recovered) models, which are claimed to
go back to the work by Ronald Ross and Hilda P. Hudson more than one
century ago [35, 36] and, ten years later, to the work of Anderson Gray
McKendrick and William Ogilvy Kermack [26, 27]. This class of models
shares several characteristics with models of population dynamics and with
conceptual lumped models in hydrology. These models simulate the temporal evolution of some compartments of the population, which is normally
subdivided among Susceptibles (i.e., those individuals who have not yet been
affected by the virus and which could be subject to infection), Infected (i.e.,
those individuals who have been infected by the virus) and Recovered (i.e.,
those individuals who have recovered, after having been infected). For this
reason, these models are usually referred to as SIR models. They are based

on phenomenological laws to describe the transfer of individuals from one
class to another.
These models have found wide application both in life sciences, mostly
in epidemiology, and in the field of economic, political and social sciences,
e.g., in the context of addressing the costs of policies designed to block epidemics and the diffusion of viruses and in the realm of optimal control to
assess the political measures which guarantee the best equilibrium between
reduction of the epidemic spread and harmful secondary socio-economical
impacts [34, 15, 13]. Several extremely interesting papers have been devoted to the mathematical properties of SIR models, often by applying the
theory of dynamical systems; see [8, 7, 4, 21, 24, 20, 29, 41, 33, 30] among
many others. However, previous works on SIR models have, to the best of
our knowledge, seldom addressed the calibration of SIR models with real
data, i.e., the issue of a proper fitting of epidemiological data with model
outcomes. Some examples refer to applications to dengue transmission [32],
H5N1 avian influenza [5], HIV epidemic [23] and Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome (SARS) [31].
In this paper, we address the problem of calibrating the epidemiological
parameters of a SIR model describing the evolution in time of the current
COVID-19 pandemic. This is achieved by solving numerically the underlying
inverse problem via the minimization of an objective function that measures
the discrepancy between our simulated solutions to the discretised SIR model
and official data on COVID-19.
Model calibration is a common problem in geophysical and environmental modeling. The present paper follows the general framework introduced
in [19] to handle discrete inverse problems for model calibration and analyses
the role of data following the discussion in [18]. The continuum SIR model
considered here is discretised via a forward-time finite-differences scheme
which is implemented in a specifically designed code, developed using the
Python programming language, to provide at each discrete time n ∈ Z
a vector state of the discretised SIR system, which is, in turn, matched
against real data in order to calibrate the parameters of the system via a
minimization problem (the inverse problem). The results presented in this
paper consider the application of the model to a given nation, Italy in this
instance, i.e., the population of the whole nation is considered, without any
further subdivision in provinces, regions or states.
The wide number of data collected during the COVID-19 pandemic due
to the diffusion of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (also called “coronavirus”) provides
an exceptional basis to test calibration of SIR models via the solution of an
inverse problem. It is well known that inverse problems are ill-posed, due
to the lack of uniqueness and stability of these problems. Non-uniqueness
will be considered in this paper by application of different algorithms for the
minimization of the misfit between reference observed quantities and model
predictions. The other relevant topic for ill-posedness is the lack of stability,

Giudici et al., Inversion of a SIR-based model: application to COVID-19 epidemic

3

i.e., the lack of continuous dependence of the parameters to be identified
on the data, so that small errors in the data can lead to large discrepancies
in the parameters one is trying to identify via the inverse problem. We do
not provide a full review here on these topics, but we mention [40] for a
general-purpose description, [1, 2] for a deep discussion on the instability
issue in the context of the so-called inverse conductivity problem and [11]
for recent results about optical tomography.
The objectives of this paper are to fix some concepts about SIR models
and their calibration and to discuss the relevance of data for reliability of
model outcomes in the context of inverse problems. The paper is designed
to advance the current knowledge about the functioning, potentialities and
limitations of epidemic models. It also highlights certain similarities among
geophysical, environmental and epidemic modeling, therefore providing further insights in epidemic model calibration. On the other hand, this work
does not aim to provide forecasts of the pandemic evolution at this stage.
It is in the authors’ opinion that the quality of the data that are currently
available does not allow to perform reliable forecast and model outcomes
should be used with high prudence. It will be material of future work to
further develop our SIR model and to address the issue of providing forecasts
of the epidemics, when the data will be better understood.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contains the description
of the SIR model in both the continuous and the discrete case (subsection
2.1) together with a precise formulation of the inverse problem addressed
in this paper in the discrete setting (subsection 2.2). In particular, inverse
modeling, i.e., model calibration, is set up and discussed computationally
within the framework proposed by [19]. The results obtained by applying
our SIR model to the COVID-19 pandemic are shown in section 3. Section
4 is devoted to a discussion about the main assumptions on which the SIR
model is based; it also contains some remarks about model calibration and
data uncertainty. The concluding section contains a final discussion about
various possible future developments of this work.

2.1

Methods and materials
The continuous and the discrete models

We start by defining the objects involved in the continuous SIR model considered in this paper.
Definition 2.1 We denote by S(t), I(t), R(t) and D(t) the number of susceptible, infected, recovered and deceased individuals of the population under
study at time t, respectively, for t varying in some interval I ⊂ R. Here
D includes only those individuals who died while being infected, whereas the
total population, at time t, is given by P (t) = S(t) + I(t) + R(t).

4

Giudici et al., Inversion of a SIR-based model: application to COVID-19 epidemic

Definition 2.2 We denote by β and δ the birth and death rate, respectively,
under normal conditions, i.e., without considering deaths caused by the epidemic. We also denote by γ, ρ and φ the infection, recovery and fatality
rate, respectively. The dimension of these coefficients is [time−1 ].
Note that β and δ in definition 2.2 are rarely considered in epidemic
modeling, as the time variation of P due to the normal evolution of the
population is either negligible or smoother than its variation due to the
presence of an epidemic. This is due to the fact that typical values of β and
δ are smaller than the ones of γ, ρ and φ by one or more orders of magnitude,
as shown in subsection 3.2. We keep birth and death rates in the model,
in order to facilitate a thorough discussion of the assumptions behind this
model, which is given in section 4. We make the following assumptions.
Assumption 2.1 The coefficients β, δ, γ, ρ and φ are assumed to be constant.
Assumption 2.2 The number of contacts of each infected person per unit
time does not vary among the infected population and it is assumed to be
constant in time. Moreover the fraction of such contacts who are susceptible
to the infection is given by S/P , whereas (I + R)/P is the fraction of those
persons who cannot be infected, as it is also assumed that recovered people
are immunized.
The following equations, based on the seminal papers [35, 36, 26, 27],
are used to describe the time evolution of S, I, D and R:

together with the initial conditions S(tini ) = Pini − 1, I(tini ) = 1, R(tini ) = 0
and D(tini ) = 0, where tini ∈ I ⊂ R is the time at which the first individual
is infected and Pini is the population at tini . Notice that from equations (1)
to (4) one can easily deduce

for some h, 0 < h ≪ 1. This rough approximation is justified by thinking
that, for h small enough, I(t) ≪ Pini ≃ S(t) and therefore IS/P ≃ I in (6).
The system

describes the time evolution of the number of infected cases during a short
time after the beginning of the infection at time t = tini . The solution
to (9), I(t) ≃ exp [(γ − α) · (t − tini )] and, for h small enough, its linear
approximation near tini , I(t) ≃ 1 + (γ − α) · (t − tini ), gives a first rough
explanation about why, during the first phases of the epidemics, i.e., for
t ≃ tini , the number of infected individuals, I(t), seems to grow linearly.
This fact motivates the difficulties in the design of an efficient early-warning
system. In fact, once I(t) increases to a significant level to be detected, the
exponential growth had already kicked in and the containment measures can
be effective only if quite drastic.
The discrete model is a simple forward-time finite-differences discretization of equations (1) to (4). For n ∈ Z, we denote the discrete time steps,

6

at a uniform spacing ∆t, by tn = n∆t. The following definition is useful for
the discrete model.
Definition 2.3 We denote by Sn , In , Rn and Dn the number of susceptible,
infected, recovered and deceased individuals of the population under study at
time tn , respectively, for n = nini , . . . , nini + N (mod) − 1, where nini is such
that tini = nini ∆t and N (mod) is the number of modeled time steps. The total
population at time tn is given by Pn = Sn + In + Rn .
Then the resulting algebraic iterative equations are of the form

and the discrete counterpart of (5) is
Pn+1 = [1 + (β − δ)∆t] Pn − φIn ∆t.

(12)

Here the time spacing ∆t = 1 day, in agreement with the sampling of
the available data set on COVID-19 pandemic (see section 2.3). Equations
(10) are implemented in a specifically designed code, developed using the
Python programming language. The choice n ∈ Z allows to simplify the
notation adopted in the formulation of the inverse problem in section 2.2.
It is important to notice that n = 0, i.e., t0 = 0, represents the first day
for which epidemic data are available and in general it does not coincide
with n = nini , which corresponds to tini , the day when the first person was
infected in a given nation, according to our model. We will call t0 = 0
(n = 0) and tini (n = nini ) the monitoring initial time and the modelling
initial time, respectively. Accordingly, we will also call Pini = P (tini ) the
model initial population.

2.2

The inverse problem: model calibration

As stated in the introduction, the inverse problem addressed here is defined
in the discrete setting by making use of the conceptual framework and the
notation of [19]. The numerical task in treating the inverse problem consists

Giudici et al., Inversion of a SIR-based model: application to COVID-19 epidemic

7

in solving iteratively (10) and matching such solutions with the data collected within a certain time-frame [tmin , tmax ). Such (discrete) time-varying
vector-solutions sn are collected in an array s, called the state of the system
s=

s is the model outcome used to forecast the number of infected, recovered
and dead individuals. To this end, we also introduce the model forecast, an
array y defined by

subset of data denoted by d′ ⊂ d includes the cumulative number of the
confirmed infected cases, together with the number of the recovered and
dead persons, released by health official organizations

is the cumulative number
of confirmed infected cases, so that the number of infected cases at a given
time n is given by
In(ref) = Cn(ref) − Rn(ref) − Dn(ref) .

(16)

d can include also other data, e.g., demographic data used to infer the
values of some model parameters (β and δ). n = 0 represents the so-called
monitoring initial time introduced in 2.1, which corresponds to the first day
for which epidemic data d′ are available; recall that, in general, it does not
coincide with the day n = nini when the first person was infected in a given
country.
Model calibration requires that the model forecast be close to a calibration target, an array t that collects the values which should be attained by

N (ref) . The model parameters are placed in an array p:
p = (β, δ, ∆t, ρ, φ, γ, nini , Pini ) ∈ P ⊂ R+ 6 × Z × (N \ {0}),

(18)

where R+ = (0, +∞) and we recall that ∆t = 1 day and Pini is the model
initial population introduced in section 2.1.
If we summarize the algebraic equations in the discrete model (10) together with the initial conditions (11) with
f (p, s) = 0,

(19)

the forward problem can be stated as: given p, find the unique state s = g(p)
that solves (19). In other words, given the parameters p, the solution to the
forward problem will give the state of the system, s. In order to introduce
the corresponding inverse problem, it is convenient to write p as


(20)
p = p(fix) , p(cal) ,
where

p(fix) = (β, δ, ∆t) ,

p(cal) = (ρ, φ, γ, nini , Pini ) .

(21)

p(fix) and p(cal) include the model parameters, whose values are fixed before
the simulation and the model parameters whose values are obtained from
the solution of the underlying inverse problem, which is yet to be stated,
respectively.
Remark 2.1 Some remarks on p, y and t are in order.
1. The array of fixed parameters is a function of d: p(fix) = p(fix) (d);
2. The model forecast y is a function of s, p and d: y = y (d, s, p);
3. t may depend
on d and p(fix) , but must be independent of p(cal) : t =

The misfit between model predictions and the target values is computed by
means of the following objective function:

In other words, Oy,t is the sum of three functions, each of which considers
one of the three reference quantities, separately. The model calibration is
then performed by solving the following inverse problem:
Given p(fix) and d, given the solution s = g (p) to (19), determine y (d, g (p) , p),

t and find p(cal) , such that

∈ P.

In other words, the objective of model calibration is to find the parameter
values which best fit the reference data in a given time interval, nmin ≤ n <
nmax .
The threshold ξ ∈ R, ξ ≥ 1, plays a double role. First of all, it keeps
positive the denominator of the quantity appearing in (23). Furthermore,
(i)
it controls some characteristics of the objective function. For ξ = 1, Oy,t is
(i)

nothing but the root-mean-squared relative difference between target (tn )
(i)
and modeled values (yn ) of the i-th component of tn and yn . For larger val(i)
ues of ξ, relative errors corresponding to large values of tn will be dominant;
from a practical point of view, this means that early time behavior is less rel(i)
evant to the model fitting. In particular, if ξ > max{tn , nmin ≤ n < nmax },
(i)
then Oy,t reduces to the standard root-mean-squared error.
It is worth stressing that the explicit use of an interval nmin ≤ n < nmax
for the definition of t, y and the objective function, although somehow
cumbersome, is useful to assess changes in the physical parameters with
time. Some examples of it will be shown in section 3.2.

2.3

Data and computer implementation for COVID-19

The application of the model introduced in section 2.1 and of the model
calibration introduced in section 2.2 can be attempted thanks to publicly
available data on COVID-19 pandemic. The application will be performed at

10

national level, i.e., the considered population will be the whole population
of some countries. For each country, the array d is populated with data
coming from two basic sources.
Data on COVID-19 pandemic are available from the GitHub repository
managed by the Johns Hopkins University [12]. This is a collection of publicly available data from multiple sources, which are processed and delivered
by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE). Notice that the data are provided to the public strictly for
educational and academic research purposes. The data are updated daily
and the files used in this paper have been downloaded from the GitHub
platform on May 2, 2020. The array t has been filled in by using those files.
Tailored codes have been developed under Python 3.7.6 to download
data from the Github repository, perform the forward model introduced in
subsection 2.1 and calibrate the model by solving the corresponding inverse
problem defined in subsection 2.2. The inversion is based on the functions
of the optimize module from SciPy v1.4.1 and profit from multi-core execution through the standard multiprocessing package. The pseudo-code for
inversion is given in Figure 1. The optimization algorithms that have been
tested are based on constrained minimization, so that some bounds on p(cal)
should be prescribed. Best results have been obtained by global optimization with the function differential evolution [39]. Since this function
implements a stochastic algorithm, the pseudo-code of Figure 1 shows that
several runs of the algorithms are executed in an easily parallelised loop.
Figure 2 shows the trend of confirmed cases, recovered and deceased people for some countries, among those that have been considered as the most
relevant for the analysis of COVID-19 pandemic not only by the scientific
community, but also by mass media. These plots show different trends of
the three curves describing the evolution in time of the confirmed, recovered
and dead cases among the various countries considered in this study.
Aside from China, for which the starting phase is not reported, since the
virus diffusion started earlier than the first date for which data are available
in the data set, the number of confirmed cases (plots A in Figure 2) shows
a first slow increase, followed by an exponential increase and possibly a
slowdown after few weeks. It is highly questionable whether this behavior
is related to the number of tests performed to confirm virus infection.
The most regular trends are clearly the ones describing the number of
deceased people (plots C in Figure 2), after about one week since the first
reported case in each country considered in this study. Doubts about comprehensiveness of official data on deaths caused by coronavirus have been
raised by several sources of information and by some commentators. Nevertheless, it seems safe to state that the number of deaths represents the
time series with the smoothest variation and possibly the less affected by
uncertainties in the data.
The second data source is the most updated version of the UN Demo-

volume. The values of population, birth and death rate of each country, for
which the model has been tested, are included in d. They are used to fix
the values of β and δ and to provide a first estimate of Pini .
Notice that the daily sampling rate of epidemiologic data induces to
choose ∆t = 1 day. Moreover, the coefficients β and δ are expressed on a
daily basis, i.e., they are converted to the same measurement units as γ, φ

First of all, the behavior of the model is shown with test case 1, which includes three model runs for which all the model parameters, but ρ, are kept
fixed. The list of parameter values is given in Table 1; the results of the
model for a one-year-long simulation period are shown in Figure 3. The
general behavior shows an exponential increase in the number of infected
persons (notice that the vertical axis is in logarithmic scale) followed by an
exponential decrease but with a longer characteristic time. The number of
deaths obviously decreases if ρ increases and in particular, we have three
different situations for the three runs: (a) for the smallest value of ρ, the
curve of susceptible persons dramatically decreases from some days before
the peak of infections and reaches very small values after few weeks; (b) for
the intermediate value of ρ, the chosen values of model parameters yield a
stationary conditions after about 8 months from the start of the epidemic
for the number of susceptible and dead people, which reach almost the same
value; (c) for the highest value of ρ, the number of susceptible people decreases with time, but remains high. Notice that, for this test case, the
reduction of the total population is limited, less than 10%, and after one
year almost all the living population is recovered. It is important to stress
that this test case has the goal of showing how the model can predict different behavior and these results should not be considered as a forecast of
the actual behavior of any real pandemic.
SIR models are often applied using the ratio of the number of individuals
in each category with respect to the total population as state variables,
namely S/P , I/P , R/P . Test case 1 showed that for three sets of model
parameters, which differ only for the value of ρ, the total population has
only a limited variation, so that approximating P to a constant value could
appear reasonable. Nevertheless, the term used to compute the infection
rate is directly proportional to both I and S and inversely proportional
to P so that it introduces a non-linearity in the model. Therefore test
case 2 is designed to assess the effect of Pini on model results. To this
goal, Pini values span four orders of magnitude, from 106 to 109 , whereas

the other parameters are fixed at the values of run (a) of test case 1. The
results are shown in Figure 4 as functions of the normalized quantities versus
time. The values of each function at the end of the simulation period are
very similar. The main differences are in the evolving phase, for which the
response of a small population appears to be more rapid than that of a large
population. Roughly speaking, the curves corresponding to high populations
show a delay with respect to the curve for the smallest population of about
15 days per an increase in Pini by an order of magnitude. This remark, if
confirmed by runs with more reliable parameter sets, could have fundamental
consequences in the design of early warning systems. In fact, the time
at which a given threshold of cases over the total population is exceeded
increases with the population size.

3.2

Model calibration

Model calibration for the COVID-19 pandemic by solution of the inverse
problem is a very challenging problem. This is not surprising at all, because
the comparison of the trends of the model time series (Figure 3) with those
observed from the reference data and drawn in Figure 2 shows that the SIR
model can hardly reproduce the observed trend.
In particular, this paper is focused on the results obtained with data
from Italy, but the same qualitative remarks hold also for the application to
data from other countries.
The basic properties of the performed tests are listed in Table 2. The
comparison between reference and fitted time series for test A, which is
to be considered as the ideal one, because all the data are used and the
standard settings are applied, is shown in Figure 5. The discrepancy between
reference and modelled values in log scale is greater for the initial phase of
the epidemic; the model does not reproduce the sharp reduction of the rate
of increase of deaths which appears in the reference time series around mid
March.
Notice that for tests B, C and D three subsets of data are used, corresponding to three non overlapping time intervals, each of which is 33-days-

2020 and the data series used in this paper ends on May 2, 2020. Therefore,
the data set considered for test B ends on February 24, 2020, whereas the
data series used for test D starts on March 30, 2020. The goal of these three
tests is to examine possible differences in the optimal values of the parameters and in the behavior of the inversion procedure, for successive temporal
phases of the epidemic. For test E, ξ = 1, so that each of the functions
(i)
Oy,t given by (23) is nothing but the root-mean-squared relative difference
between reference and modeled values of I, R and D for i = 1, 2, 3, respectively. Test F is based on a subset of the data, in particular, for this test
the number of dead patients only is fitted; the rationale behind this test is
that D (ref) should be less uncertain than the other data of d′ . Finally, test
G is an attempt to consider the hints raised by several authorities and researchers, suggesting that official numbers could be heavily underestimated.
In this test, it is assumed that the number of infected and recovered persons
be 10 times greater than those reported in official documents; analogously
the number of deaths is assumed to be twice the official value.
Minimization of the objective function Oy,t was performed with different
functions of the SciPy’s module optimize which implements several methods to find a minimum, also by taking into account possible bounds on p(cal) .
The bounds have been assigned on the basis of preliminary gross estimates
from available data and they are listed in Table 3.

Several runs have been conducted with a routine for local minimization
and the best results were obtained with the L-BFGS-B method, which is a
variation of the BroydenFletcherGoldfarbShannon (BFGS) algorithm [16] to
reduce memory requirements and to handle simple constraints. The results
of these runs are not presented here, for two basic motivations. That method
is part of a wide family of algorithms which move towards the minimum by
means of gradient-based searches. However, it is not possible to compute
analytically derivatives of Oy,t with respect to tini and Pini , which are integer,
and not real, variables. Therefore, that family of methods cannot be applied
in a rigorous way. Nevertheless, the performed runs, possibly fixing the value
of tini , confirm the existence of multiple local minima for Oy,t .
Global minimization by application of differential evolution [39],
even with the default settings, yielded good results, which are listed in Tables
4 and 5. The mean value and its standard deviation of each parameter has
been estimated after 10 runs of this stochastic algorithm, for which the
random initializing seed introduces variations among the returned results.
When looking at Table 5, it is important to recall that tini and Pini are integer
numbers, but in the table the averages and the relative standard errors are
computed after 10 runs and this explains the float numbers notation.
Besides the optimal values of p(cal) listed in Tables 4 and 5, it is impor-

tant and useful to consider also some properties of the inversion procedure

Table 4 shows that, apart from few tests, the optimal values of γ, ρ
and φ are relatively similar, sharing the same order of magnitude and the
relationship γ > ρ > φ among different tests. These inequalities are violated
by the results of test B and possibly of test E; test B refers to the very initial
days of the epidemic, whereas test E refers to the use of relative errors in
the computation of the objective function. Notice that using relative errors
gives some more weight to the small values of the elements of t, which are
those recorded at the beginning of the epidemic. Therefore, these results are
quite consistent. Notice also that tests B and E are the only tests for which
tini > 0. In these tests, like in test G, the calibrated parameters display the
highest coefficient of variation (the ratio between the standard deviation
and the average); in other words, these are the tests for which the optimal
values show more uncertainty.
Two facts should be mentioned about the results of test A shown in Table
5: first, tini < 0, i.e., it seems that the infection started before the official

appearance of the first confirmed case; second, Pini is close to the lower
bound chosen in Table 3, so that the model predicts that the population
which has been involved in the infection could be relatively small. These
qualitative remarks are confirmed by most of the other tests. Notice, in
particular, that even if one considers test E, which gives the highest average
value of Pini among different runs, the runs which yield the least values of
Oy,t give a value of Pini close to 2 · 105 , as for test A.
Table 6 shows that tests A, D and G are those for which the results
of different runs are more consistent with each other. This is important,
⋆
because it shows that the identification of p(cal) with the proposed approach
appears to be robust for these tests. On the other hand, for the remaining
tests, it is important to carefully check the outcomes of each single run. In
fact, the initial seed could introduce some bias which cannot be overcome
by the differential evolution routine with its default settings and the
final result could yield a local minimum, instead of the global one. This is
illustrated by the comparison in Figure 6, which shows the results of test F
for the optimal parameters and those averaged among the 10 runs and listed
in Tables 4 and 5. This test was designed to fit the data on the deceased
people and this is apparent from Figure 6(a); the fit seems extremely goo, in
fact, the two green curves overlap almost perfectly for a large time interval.
On the other hand, from Figure 6(b) it is evident that some of the inversion
runs yielded parameters which do not permit to properly and satisfactorily
reproduce the data.
From Table 6, it is also apparent that the objective function is computed
a great number of times for each single run of the tests. This number strongly
varies among the tests. Recall that each computation of Oy,t requires a run
of the model, so that the computational costs could become important. The

Discussion
Remarks about the model

Some basic assumptions, on which the model developed in this work is
funded, deserve to be recalled and discussed.
The developed model basically assumes “homogeneity” of the population. In other words, no distinction is done in terms of sex, age, economic
wealth, health and wellness, working conditions, life style, home state, and
any other, including genetic background. Also, the model assumes that
the population under study is a closed system, thus disregarding variations
induced by short-time, tourist or business travels, by intermediate-time mobility of students and workers, and by long-time effects of migrant fluxes.
The model is also independent of the climatic and environmental conditions, i.e., the processes considered by the model are assumed to be independent of the variability of weather conditions and environmental quality at
any temporal and space scale. In particular, this means that neither sharp
and rapid variations nor annual or seasonal cycling should affect these processes.

22

Giudici et al., Inversion of a SIR-based model: application to COVID-19 epidemic

Epidemic models rarely consider birth and death rates, because the corresponding terms in the underlying equations are usually negligible. In this
work, these terms have been kept, in order to facilitate this discussion. In
particular, following the assumption of population homogeneity, it is assumed that infected pregnant women give birth to infected babies and that
this occur at the same rate as for susceptible women.
With regard to infection rate, which is described by the term γIS/P in
(1) and (2), some remarks are in order. This term is computed by assuming
that each infected individual has a given, constant number of contacts with
other persons per unit time. Our model assumes that the number of persons
who cannot be infected is I + R, so that the fraction of contacted persons
who cannot be infected is given by (I + R)/P ; on the other hand, the
fraction of contacted individuals who can be infected is given by S/P . This
is equivalent to assuming that recovered people become immune to the virus,
an aspect which is not confirmed by the scientific community (see, e.g., [38]).
Moreover, recovered people are assumed to be not infectious, which is the
case if the response of their immune system is so fast that, once they come
in contact with the virus again, the virus is destroyed by the immune system
before it can be spread to susceptible persons. The γ coefficient, due to the
“homogeneity” assumption, is considered to be independent of the factors
which have been recalled at the beginning of this subsection; in particular,
working and living conditions could control the distance and the duration
of contacts of infected - and therefore infectious - individuals with other
persons.
The so-called recovery and fatality coefficients ρ and φ are assumed to
be constant. This is not based on the “homogeneity” assumption only. In
fact, this implies that recovery and fatality are modeled as instantaneous
processes, i.e., independent of the time passed since infection; moreover, no
distinction is done among death or healing of infected people according to
the strength of their symptoms and to the location where they are treated
(home and hospitals non-intensive, or Intensive Care Units – ICUs). The
latter condition could be modeled by subdividing the class of infected people
among sub-classes, e.g., asymptomatic, with light symptoms, admitted to
hospital non-intensive care units, admitted to ICUs [17, 37].

4.2

Remarks about model calibration by solution of the inverse problem

The results presented in section 3.2 show some of the classical, well known
difficulties of non-linear least-squares inversion, in particular the dependence
of the solution on the starting values, related to the existence of multiple
local minima, and the flatness of the objective function around the local
minima.
We obtained excellent results by applying the “differential evolution”

Giudici et al., Inversion of a SIR-based model: application to COVID-19 epidemic

23

algorithm [39]. Obviously, different algorithms for global optimization could
be tested, like, e.g., genetic algorithms [9, 37], particle swarm optimization
[25], simulated annealing [28].
With reference to the specific example under study, it is necessary to
stress some aspects, mostly related to the role of data in model calibration
[18].
First of all, the solutions obtained by means of a global optimization
algorithm for high values of the threshold ξ show that the optimal value of
Pini is smaller than the total Italian population. This parameter Pini has
been included in p(cal) with the objective of assessing the extension of the
reference population. In other words, including Pini among the parameters
to be calibrated might provide a, possibly very rough, estimate of the width
of the initial population whose evolution is represented by the model. In this
particular instance, the results suggest that the reference initial population
does not cover the whole country, but only a limited portion.
The latter remark seems to go in tandem with the well-known fact that
in the countries most affected by COVID-19, the epidemic spread of the
virus had mostly concentrated in specific areas: the province of Hubei, and
above all the city of Wuhan, in China; the Lombardy region, and above all
the provinces of Bergamo, Brescia, Lodi and Milan, in Italy; the city of New
York in the USA; Île-de-France in France; Madrid and Catalunya in Spain;
London in the UK.
Finally, it is quite difficult to assess the quality of data on the COVID-19
pandemic, but their uncertainty is expected to be very high. For instance,
the correct number of infected people “remains unknown because asymptomatic cases or patients with very mild symptoms might not be tested and
will not be identified”, as recognized, e.g., by [3]. In an interview published
on March 23rd 2020 by the Italian newspaper “La Repubblica”, Angelo Borrelli, head of Dipartimento della Protezione civile (national civil protection
department) stated that a ratio of one certified case out of every 10 total
cases is credible. Furthermore, different criteria have been adopted by different countries and institutions to define the various categories of infected,
recovered and deceased people by or with COVID-19. This fact has been
widely recognized as a cause of uncertainty in the collected data. Finally,
censorship on COVID-19 pandemics is reported by journalists and organizations in some of the countries affected by the pandemic.
As a consequence, the use of official data to perform reliable estimates is
questionable. In principle, stochastic approaches, e.g., the Bayesian framework [6], could be very helpful to handle discrepancies between model predictions and reference values. Unfortunately, in this case the systematic and
random errors could be so high as to make it very difficult to handle them
even in a stochastic framework.

Conclusions

The modeling tests conducted within this work lead to a series of remarks,
which are summarized in this conclusive section, together with some future
perspectives.
Starting from some remarks about modeling aspects, the limitations of
classical SIR models have been recalled. These should be always carefully
considered especially for applications and when these models are used as
engines of decision support systems.
The main limitation of our model is related to the “homogeneity” assumption, accompanied by the steadiness of the recovery and fatality coefficients.
The latter aspect could be handled, for instance, by introducing functions (φ̃, ρ̃) of elapsed time since infection. Such functions should enter in
a deconvolution product involving the number of persons who have been
infected at a given time and are still infected, i.e., are not yet recovered or
passed away. With this approach, φI and ρI in (2) to (4) could be replaced

and δ is the death rate introduced in definition 2.2. Notice that the fatality
coefficient, φ, accounts for the deaths related to the pandemic, i.e., it represents the increase in the death rate due to the pandemic. The normal death
rate is considered through δ.
The assumption of “homogeneity” could be relaxed by considering “distributed” models, similar to those applied for transport phenomena, e.g.,
for diffusion of contaminants in the environment. Those models can account for “diffusive” spread and for “advective” transport. However, the
required parametrization is often much finer than the one for lumped models, so that the number of parameters to be calibrated strongly increases,
and therefore in absence of good quality data it could be difficult to perform
a reliable calibration and validation of the model for a practical application.
Promising classes of models are stochastic models [22], either under a
Monte Carlo framework or by using assimilation techniques, e.g., the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF, see, e.g., [14]). In principle, Monte Carlo
models might be adapted in a relatively easy way to account for several
phenomena and also to consider the role of some aspects (e.g., sex, age,
health and wellness, etc.) on the probability of infection, recovery and decease. On the other hand, EnKF could provide a firm theoretical framework
to improve model predictions by means of uncertain data.

With regard to the specific application of our model to COVID-19 epidemic, although it could be improvident to draw quantitative conclusions,
it is nevertheless qualitatively confirmed that infection started quite earlier
than the certain appearance of the first episodes of infection. The results
of model inversion also suggest that the calibrated model could be reliable
for a portion of the whole population. Somehow, the model itself, through
its calibration, seems to suggest the width of the population for which its
approximations could be valid.
By merging inversion results with the analysis of the continuous model,
some relevant remarks can be given for the conditions at the apex of infection, i.e., when I reaches its maximum value. At that time,

The calibration results listed in Table 4 show that α is about one order of
magnitude smaller than γ. In particular for the calibration tests performed
in this study (Table 4) (γ − α) · γ −1 assumes a relatively high value, close
to 0.8. In other words, if the values of γ, φ and ρ obtained from model
calibration could be considered as reliable, at least as order of magnitude,
at the pandemic peak a large fraction of the population would have already
been infected, and possibly recovered.
Last, but not least for its practical importance, this paper has the ambition to provide further evidence about the great care that has to be given to
the quality of pandemic data, when used to calibrate or validate epidemic
models. In fact, poor quality data might yield unrealistic parameter values
and, therefore, unreliable model predictions.
