Abstract
We study the investor beliefs, sentiment and disagreement, about stock market
returns during the COVID-19 pandemic using a large number of messages of investors – about 3.7 million messages – on a social media investing platform, StockTwits. The rich and multimodal features of StockTwits data allow us to explore
the evolution of sentiment and disagreement within and across investors, sectors,
and even industries. We find that the sentiment (disagreement) has a sharp decrease (increase) across all investors with any investment philosophy, horizon, and
experience between February 19, 2020, and March 23, 2020, where a historical
market high followed by a record drop. Surprisingly, these measures have a sharp
reverse toward the end of March. However, the performance of these measures
across various sectors is heterogeneous. Financial and healthcare sectors are the
most pessimistic and optimistic divisions, respectively.

Introduction

We explore investor beliefs, sentiment and disagreement (dispersion of views across
investors), on stock market returns during the COVID-19 pandemic using a large number of messages of investors on a social media investing platform, StockTwits. StockTwits is a microblogging platform in which investors can post their views as a Tweeter
type format, e.g., 140 characters.1 Perhaps more importantly, they also can label
their messages with a sentiment which can be bullish, bearish, or leave it unspecified,
neutral. Since extracting sentiment from text data is a challenging task, this is an important feature.2 Besides, they can use "cashtags", e.g., $AAPL, to link their message
to a particular firm.3
Using a survey conducted on wealthy retail investors who are clients of Vanguard,
Giglio et al. (2020) provide a data-driven analysis of how investor expectations about
economic growth and stock market returns changed during the February-March 2020
stock market crash induced by the COVID-19 pandemic. They find that, among others, investor beliefs before and during the COVID-19 crisis in February-March 2020

1

StockTwits was founded in 2008 as a social networking platform for investors on the financial markets.
It is similar to Tweeter with more additional options that are designed for investors to express their
views. Cookson and Niessner (2019) provide an in-depth analysis of the StockTwits data for measuring
disagreement and exploring its source. To have reliable and high quality data, they conduct their
analysis of messages posted between January 2013 and September 2014. Since then, the number of
users, as well as messages, haven exponentially increased. For example, the number of messages
posted between December 2019 and March 2020 is about a quarter of their messages. Although we
have access to the whole dataset of StockTwits, however, we limit our analysis on posted messages
during the COVID-19 pandemic.
2
A major problem in textual analysis is related to the correct interpretation of context in which certain
words are used. In other words, it is difficult to evaluate what truly is a positive, neutral, and negative
statement. For example, it is not clear how to deal with sarcasm, see Rosenthal et al. (2019), among
others.

Detailed information about why do people post messages? and why do their messages represent their
view? can be found in Cookson and Niessner (2019) and therein references.

shows a sharp increased disagreement about the stock market outcomes and future
of the economy. This paper complements their findings in several important ways by
analyzing the messages on StockTwits.

1.1

Primary contributions

The contribution of this paper is three-fold. First, thanks to the availability of investors’ messages at the high-frequency level, e.g., minute, augmented with their
sentiment and cashtags, we can measure disagreement at a high-frequency level.4
Comparing the disagreement and its evolution which are extracted from StockTwits
with their counterparts in Giglio et al. (2020) is an interesting exercise, given the
heterogeneity in the sources of data.
Second, it is important to measure the disagreement around the COVID-19 pandemic, however, understanding the source of disagreement is more vital for both the
design of the ongoing economic policy response and in further advancing economic
theories. It is not clear what is the source of disagreement in Giglio et al. (2020): information or interpretation of information. The StockTwits data can be used to explore
this direction of disagreement as in Cookson and Niessner (2019).
Third, the rich and multimodal nature of the StockTwits data allows us to take a
magnifier on sentiment/disagreement and explore how does it vary across sectors, as
well as investors: homogeneous or heterogeneous. As we have seen while the price of
most companies has been dropped during the COVID-19 pandemic, some pharmaceutical and technological companies had a big jump in their price. For example, a tech
4

The number of posted messages per minute is on the scale of hundreds.

3

company such as Zoom had more than 20% jump in its price. Hence, these companies
might have different sources of disagreement with stocks that dropped. This aspect
of StockTwits data can help to understand this direction of disagreement.

1.2

Main empirical findings

To explore the investor beliefs, sentiment and disagreement, on stock market returns
during the COVID-19 pandemic, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of all posted
messages on the StockTwits platform between November 30, 2020, and March 31,
2020. In total, we have 3,676,169 messages of 179,468 unique users mentioning
10,715 unique tickers. We establish the following empirical facts about sentiment and
disagreement of investors that post messages on the StockTwits platform.
Daily time series of the sentiment and disagreement is not a stationary process.
This is true across and within all investors with any investment philosophy, horizon,
and experience. The same results are valid across sectors. The immediate implication
is that before any investigation/analysis it is helpful to deal with non-stationary via
either transformation, rolling window, or differencing.
There is a V −shape (Λ−shape ) in sentiment (disagreement) between February
19, 2020 and March 31, 2020. Specifically, there is a sharp decrease (increase) in
sentiment (disagreement) until March 23, 2020, and then they reverse back until the
end of our sample. This result is consistent with findings of Giglio et al. (2020) that
the average investor turned more pessimistic about the short-run performance of both
stock markets and the economy.
The pattern of sentiment and disagreement is homogeneous for investors across
4

and within investment philosophy, horizons, and experiences. Daily time series of
sentiment and disagreement support this finding. Furthermore, the average and standard deviation of sentiment and/or disagreement are ranging from 0.6 to 0.8 during
the COVID-19 pandemic.
The pattern of sentiment and disagreement is heterogeneous across sectors. Daily
time series of sentiment and disagreement across sectors behave quite differently
across sectors which is in contrast with the behavior of sentiment and disagreement
across investors. For instance, the daily time series of sentiment for the healthcare
sector is almost flat while it has a downward trend for the financial sector.
The financial sector is the most pessimistic while healthcare is the most optimistic
during the COVID-19 pandemic. The median of sentiment for the financial sector is

0.257 while this statistic for the healthcare sector is 0.782. Moreover, the disagreement
for the financial sector is 0.901 which is pretty high while this statistic for disagreement of healthcare is 0.581.

StockTwits

To explore investor beliefs, sentiment and disagreement, on stock market returns during COVID-19 pandemic, we limit our sample on messages posted between November
30, 2019 and March 31, 2020.5 The format of downloaded messages is JSON.6 We use
the Python 3.7 for our analysis.
In total, we have 3,676,169 messages of 179,468 unique users mentioning 10,715
5

The reason for this range is the following. It is believed that the virus has started spreading in Wuhan
in the beginning of December 2019. Also, we are only able to update our dataset once per month, at
the end of each month. The last month in our dataset at the conducing this paper was March 2020.
6
See Listing 1 for a detailed information about JSON format and an example of it from StockTwits.

5

unique tickers. For each message/idea, we observe a unique message and user identifier among much other information, see Listing 1. Panel A of Table 1 presents summary statistics for some characteristics of raw StockTwits Data, without any filtration.
The average number of messages per stock-date is 23.99, with as many as 26,424
messages for some stocks on some days. The average number of people a user follows
is 23.92 where this stat for the number of followers is 121.37. The median number of
ideas (likes) a user has is 37 (22), with as many as 2,126,704 (809,351) ideas (likes).
Textual analysis of a dataset by Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques
requires an initial assessment. We do need an NLP technique for extracting the sentiment of unspecified messages where they are neither bullish nor bearish. Panel B of
Table 1 shows the frequency distribution of messages’ basic features such as the number of words, characters, stopdwrods, and cashtags, as well as, the average length of
words. $SPY is the cashtage with the highest number of frequencies which is 368,086
(10% of total cashtags).
The top graph of Figure 1 exhibits the ticker of most frequent firms, as well as,
their frequency during the COVID-19 pandemic. The most mentioned firm is Tesla
with 176,540 times (4.8% of total cashtags) while in the bottom of the top 20 firms
there are companies such as Amazon and Aurora Cannabis Inc. with the frequency
of 25,767 and 25,502, respectively. The middle graph of Figure 1 reveals top 10
sectors with most frequency. Exchange traded fund are most mentioned industries
with more 22.55% of posted messages. Medical Laboratories & Research industry
are 10th with 1.9% of posted messages. The bottom graph of Figure 1 shows the
frequency distribution of posted messages by sector during this pandemic. Cookson
6

and Niessner (2019) find that the technology and pharmaceutical companies are the
most frequent. However, during this pandemic financial and healthcare sectors have
the most frequencies.
Figure 2 exhibits the distribution of messages by the day of the week and by the
hour of the day. As can be seen, investors tend to post messages during the opening
of the market (Monday-Friday, between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.). As pointed out by Cookson
and Niessner (2019), this timing is consistent with investors updating their messages
in real time as financial events unfold.

2.1

Investor philosophies

StockTwits’s users can fill out their profiles with information about themselves as investors. Specifically, they are able to specify their investment approach, investment
horizon (holding period), and experience level. Table 2, we present the breakdown of
users by investment approach, holding period, and experience. This table reveals several important messages. First, more than 80% of users do not specify their approach,
investment horizon, as well as, experience level. This is consist with the dataset of
Cookson and Niessner (2019). The number of users in their dataset drop to 12,029
from 107,808 users after removing those people that do not report their investment
approach, holding period, and experience in their profile information.
Second, on StockTwits, the most common approach is technical, representing
5.92% of users and about 9.7% of messages. Growth and momentum investors represent the next two most common investment philosophies (3.44% and 3.42% of investors, respectively), followed by fundamental and value investors (2.48% and 1.86%
7

of investors, respectively), representing 3.57% and 2.6% of messages, respectively.
Global macro investors make up only 0.78% of overall investors and 0.56% of messages.7
Third, on StockTwits, swing trader has the largest number of users for investment
horizon, representing 6.85% of users and 11.78% messages. Long term investor and
day trader are the next two common investment preferences for holding period (4.51%
and 3.61% of investors, respectively), followed by position traders with 2.98% and
4.95% of investors and messages, respectively.
Finally, users with intermediate experience are the most common investors, representing 8.46% of users and 15.79% of messages. Novice and professional users share
the same percentage of users by 4.92% and 4.72% of investors, respectively. However,
professional investors tend to post messages more often than novice investors. The
percentage of posted messages for professional investors is 8.73% while this number
is 5.10% for novice investors.

Sentiment and disagreement

Eliciting sentiment from a text document such as a tweet, message, or review of a
product on Amazon, among others, is a challenging but important task. This task
means identifying whether a piece of text, e.g., tweet, express positive, negative, or
neutral sentiment.8 Thanks to an outstanding feature of StockTwits, allowing users

7

The same systematic analysis as been done in Cookson and Niessner (2019) can be conducted to
examine whether the StockTwits investment approaches reliably categorize users into truly different
investment philosophies.

Rosenthal et al. (2019) describe some details about sentiment analysis for tweets. Gentzkow et al.
(2019) provide a gentle introduction to the use of text as an input to economic research.

8

to label their messages, identifying the sentiment of its messages is not a problem.
This critical feature enormously facilitates the analysis of StockTwits’s messages. Although the field of textual analysis has been provided with many advanced algorithms,
however, they can not be as accurate as of the person that posts the message.
To carry our analysis, we drop the messages that left their sentiment as null. We
also eliminate messages with multiple Cashtages from our analysis.9 We follow the
same approach as Antweiler and Frank (2004) and Cookson and Niessner (2019) in
constructing a sentiment measure from bullish and bearish messages. Specifically, we
first label each bearish message as −1 and each bullish message as 1. We then take
the arithmetic average of these classifications at the group1 × day × group2 level:
AvgSentimentitg =

Bullish − N bearish
Nitg
itg
Bullish + N bearish
Nitg
itg

Bullish and N bearish are number of bullish and bearish messages per group1,
where Nitg
itg

day, and group2, respectively. Group1 can be either all firms, sectors, industries, or a
specific firm, sector, or industry. Group2 can either be all investors or investors with a
given investment philosophy, experience, or holding period (investment horizon) level.
This measure of sentiment has important features. Among others, measuring the
sentiment at the sector or industry level can be potentially very useful. For example,
during the COVID-19 pandemic knowing the sentiment at the level of industry can
be fruitful for the designing ongoing economic policy response. Unfortunately, this
direction of a sentiment measure is not explored in Cookson and Niessner (2019).

9

More then half of the messages on our dataset are unclassified, neither bullish nor bearish. Although,
by excluding unclassified messages, we lose about half of our dataset, however, the number of messages
that remain is still substantial. Possibly, it would be interesting if we label unclassified messages from
classifies ones as it is done in Cookson and Niessner (2019). We leave it for further investigation.

9

Disagreement and sentiment go hand-in-hand and they cannot be considered separately from each other. We calculate the disagreement similar to Cookson and Niessner (2019) ( Antweiler and Frank (2004)) where disagreement is measured by computing the standard deviation of expressed sentiment across group1 × day × group2
(messages) as following
Disagreementitg =

q

1 − AvgSentiment2itg .

where group1 can be either all firms, sectors, industries, or a specific firm, sector, or
industry and group2 can either be all investors or investors with a given investment
philosophy, experience, or holding period (investment horizon) level.

Sentiment dynamics: moving average

The rich and multimodal features of the StockTwits data enable us to construct a
time series of sentiment at the daily frequency. In this section, we discuss possible
dynamics for modeling the time series of average sentiment and its decomposition.
We calculate the average sentiment measure, AvgSentimentitg , for day t from messages posted between the market close of day t − 1 to the market close of day t.11 Panel
(a) of Figure 3 presents the daily time series of sentiment where group1 is all sectors,

group2 users that group by their investment approach and t represents a day. As we
can see, the time series is noisy. A closer visual inspection on it reveals, this time se-

10

Detailed information about this measure can be found in Antweiler and Frank (2004) and Cookson
and Niessner (2019).
11
As in Cookson and Niessner (2019), for this analysis, we compute the average sentiment measure by
assigning each message an equal weight. However, our dataset allows us to scale the sentiment of each
message by the number of likes or number of followers its user has. We leave this robustness check for
further investigation.

10

ries is not stationary, that is the mean, variance, and covariance are time-dependent.
In this paper, we are interested in the trend of sentiment and disagreement process.
Therefore, we need to transform the data somehow to identify its short-term trend.
Investors often use moving average approach to detect a signal for taking long or
short positions, trend-following approach. The sentiment at day t equals the averages
of past seven days of AvgSentimentitg . We use simple moving average (SMA) which is
unweighted mean of previous days. Given the length of our sample, we use the seven
days moving average – one week. However, weighted/exponential moving average
with different lags can be considered for this analysis. Specifically,
AvgSentimentitg =

1 7
AvgSentimenti(t−q) g .
7 q∑
=1

The rolling window can be justified as follows. It is rational to assume that the
sentiment of a user is unlikely to change instantaneously, contrary, its evolution is
likely gradual. Statistically speaking, the process of the sentiment is unlikely to be
stationary. Hence, using the past seven observations for extracting the sentiment
can be justified.12 Right side of Panel (a) in Figure 3 shows the daily time series
of sentiment with the rolling window on past seven days. As we can see, the daily
time series of sentiment after applying the rolling window is less noisy, perhaps, more
importantly, its short-term trend is clear.
In general, depending on the nature of the trend and seasonality, there are two
main approaches, additive or multiplicative, wherein, each observation in the series

12

There are different directions of this procedure which need to be robustly checked. First, it is important to check the length of the rolling window, the number of past days. Second, what is the right
weight for each past observation? In the current rolling window procedure, we give equal weights to
all past seven sentiments.

11

can be manifested as either a sum or a product of the components, respectively. For
example, an additive model can have a decomposable time series alike Harvey and
Peters (1990).13 The model has three main components: trend, seasonality, and holidays:
AvgSentimentitg = gt + st + ht + et
where gt is the trend function, st represents periodic changes, e.g., weekly and monthly,

ht represents the role of holidays, and et is any idiosyncratic changes which are not
accommodated by the model. This specification is similar to a generalized additive
model of Hastie and Tibshirani (1987).
Panel (b) of Figure 3 presents the disagreement correlation matrix with (right)
and without (left) rolling window where group2 can be either investment approach,
experience, or holding period.

14

A close inspection reveals two important messages.

First, the rolling window does not affect the structure of the disagreement correlation
matrix. The graphs on the left and right side of Panel (b) are very similar. Second,
the disagreement is strongly correlated together across investors with any approach,
experience, and investment horizon.

Empirical findings

In this section, we explore the evolution of sentiment and disagreement across and
within all investors and sectors.
13

There is a useful Python and R package for empirical implementation of this model, see Taylor and
Letham (2018).
14
To save space, we have not reported the daily time series as Panel (a) for investors’ experience and
their investment horizon. Their time series have a similar pattern as their counterpart, investment
approach.

5.1

Investors

Summary. We find that the sentiment (disagreement) has a sharp decrease (increase)
between February 19, 2020, and March 23, 2020, across all investors with any investment philosophy, horizon, and experience, where a historical market hight followed
by a record drop. The pattern of sentiment and disagreement is homogeneous for
investors with different investment philosophies, horizons, and experiences. Furthermore, The differential interpretation of information has likely a small contribution as
a source of disagreement during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Table 3 presents summary statistics on average sentiment broken down by investment philosophy (approach), horizon (holding period), and experience. As investors
tend to post bullish messages more frequently than bearish messages, it makes sense
that the average sentiment across investors with any investment philosophy, horizon,
and experience is closer to 1 than −1. During our sample period, values investors are
the most likely to post bullish messages. Surprisingly, during the sample of Cookson
and Niessner (2019), technical investors are more likely to post bullish messages. The
averages of sentiment for a value investor is 0.721, whereas fundamental, technical,
momentum, and growth investors post bearish messages with the same probability,
about 0.6. As for investment horizon, a day trader has the lowest probability to post
bullish messages which is 0.372. Furthermore, the standard deviation of the sentiment within day trader investors is the highest, at about 0.873. The probability of
posting bullish messages for swing traders, long term investors, and position trader
are similar and about 0.6. Finally, professional investors are less likely to post bullish

13

messages, furthermore, the standard deviation within professional investors is the
highest, about 0.84 whereas this statistic is 0.611 and 0.616 for novice and intermediate investors, respectively.
To save space, we do not report daily time series for average sentiment and disagreement within investors’ philosophy, experience, and investment horizon.15 We
observe the following messages from these time series. Within investors’ philosophy,
all investors, except growth, share the same opinion on sentiment and disagreement.
This reconfirms what we found in Panel A of Table 3. As for investors’ experience:
(i) that professional investors are more pessimistic than novice and intermediate investors; (ii) the novice and intermediate investors share the same pattern across time
whereas professional investors have a substantially different pattern. For example,
disagreement is increasing in the middle of January 2020 and stays up until the end of
March. However, disagreement between novice and intermediate investors is pretty
stable until the middle of February, where the market reaches a historical high, and
then they have a sharp increase towards the middle of March, where the market had
a record drop. As for investors’ investment horizon: (i) position traders, long term
traders, and swing traders share the same pattern for daily time series of average
sentiment and disagreement, whereas the pattern of day trader investors is different.
(ii) day trader investors are more pessimistic than other investors within this group.
Consequently, disagreement is much higher, from the middle of January it is around 1
which is pretty high.
On February 19, 2020, the US stock market was at a historical high and followed
15

These results are available upon request.

14

by a record drop on March 23, 2020. We refer to these dates the good and bad state
of the economy, respectively. By the end of March, the market has recovered some
of its losses. We refer to this state, which is the last observation in our sample, as
the "recovered" state of the economy. It is interesting to investigate the disagreement
correlation matrix within investors with different investment philosophies, horizons,
and experiences at different stages of the economy. The outcome of such an investigation potentially can help to identify the source of disagreement in these states of
the economy. Consequently, it can provide good guidance for the designing ongoing
economic policy response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Figure 4 presents the disagreement correlation matrix across investors’ philosophy at three states of the economy: good (a), bad (b), and "recovered" (c). We use
all observations in our sample from November 31, 2019, until February 19 (March
23), 2020 for calculating disagreement correlation matrix in the good (bad) state of
the economy. In each panel, there are two heatmaps, with (right) and without (left)
rolling window. A close inspection reveals three important findings. First, disagreement for growth investors in all three states of the economy is less correlated to investors with other investment philosophies. For example, in the good state of economy
growth investors have a negative correlation with fundamental, momentum, and value
investors. Second, in the good state of the economy disagreement correlation matrix
has smaller values in comparison with the bad sate. For instance, the correlation
between momentum and value investors increases from 0.40 to 0.79. Third, although
the market gains back some of its losses by the end of March, however, the values
of the disagreement correlation matrix are still high. This is consistent with what
15

we find earlier, which is the disagreement decreases towards the end of the sample
for all investment philosophies. The same results hold for investors’ experience and
investment horizon.16
It has been documented that disagreement, volume, and volatility are highly correlated, especially during a bear market, see Bollerslev et al. (2018), among others.
However, it is not clear what is the source of disagreement: information or interpretation of information (investment philosophy). Cookson and Niessner (2019) find that
disagreement is evenly split between both sources of disagreement. Surprisingly, a
conclusion from Figure 4 is that the differential interpretation of information is not
likely a source of disagreement during the COVID-19 pandemic. The main argument
to support this claim is the high correlation among investment philosophies.

5.2

Sectors

Summary. By exploiting the evolution of average sentiment and disagreement across
and within sectors, in contrast to our finding across investors, we find that the pattern
of sentiment and disagreement is heterogeneous across sectors. Moreover, the financial sector is the most pessimistic while healthcare is the most optimistic during the
COVID-19 pandemic.17 The average sentiment for the financial sector is even entering
within negative territory during March.
Table 4 presents summary statistics on average sentiment broken down by sec-

16

The results are available upon request.
By pessimistic (optimistic) we mean investors post less bullish (bearish) messages and more bearish
(bullish) messages.
17

16

tor.18 The Healthcare sector has the highest average number of messages per day,

3, 910 messages, followed by financial and technology sectors with 4, 125 and 1, 997
messages, respectively. This is consistent with our original sample, except the financial sector had the highest number of posed messages, see Figure 1. Industrial goods
and utilities sectors have the smallest average number of posted messages per day by

654 and 694 messages.
Panel B and C of Table 4 represent the descriptive statistics on average sentiment
and disagreement per day per sector, respectively. A close inspection of the mean
columns reveals two important discoveries. First, on average investors do not post
the same number of bullish/bearish messages across sectors. Second, the financial
sector is the most pessimistic, with 0.199 average sentiment per day, while healthcare is the most optimistic with 0.808 average sentiment per day during the COVID-19
pandemic. Consequently, the disagreement measure is the highest (lowest) for the financial (healthcare) sector where the average of disagreement is 0.938(0.584) per day.
After the financial sector, the consumer goods sector is the second most pessimistic
sector where the average sentiment is 0.312. Investors tend to pose the same number
of messages for industrial goods and services where the average sentiment per day is

0.480 and 0.408, respectively.
Figure 5 exhibits daily time series of sentiment and disagreement across sectors.
A visualization re-confirm our findings from Table 4. Moreover, this figure allows us
to see their evolution which is not possible from Table 4. Time series of sentiment and

18

Due to the low quality of posted messages about the Conglomerates sector, we exclude this sector
form our analysis.

17

disagreement differently evolves across sectors. Specifically, we can see that the time
series of sentiment for financial, consumer goods, technology, and services sectors
have downward trends while utilities, industrial goods sectors have time series with
an upward trend. The trend of sentiment for the healthcare and basic material is
almost flat where the sentiment and disagreement for the basic material sector is
more volatile than the rest of the sectors.
In a good economy state, each asset class or industry moves independently, i.e.,
there are small price correlations among different classes of assets or sectors. To
explore this behavior for sentiment and disagreement, we calculate the disagreement
correlation matrix across all sectors on three economy states: good, bad, and recovered.
Panel A of Table 5 presents the disagreement correlation matrix in the good state
of the economy across sectors. Among others, we can see that disagreement between
finance and technology industries is high and positive, 0.667, while the correlation of
disagreement between finance and healthcare sectors is small and negative, −0.091.
Disagreement in the technology sector is negatively correlated with industrial goods
and services sectors. Moreover, disagreement of healthcare is positively correlated
with its counterparts in all other sectors, except for the financial sector.
Panel B of Table 5 reveals the disagreement correlation matrix in the bad state of
the economy across sectors. In this state of the economy, we can see that in contrast
to the good state of the economy, the correlation of the healthcare sector is negative
with most of the other sectors. The disagreement correlation matrix is pretty stable
by going toward end of the sample, see Panel C.

Conclusion

To explore the investor beliefs, sentiment and disagreement, on stock market returns
during the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of all posted
messages on the StockTwits platform between November 30, 2020, and March 31,
2020. We established several empirical facts about sentiment and disagreement of investors that post messages on the StockTwits platform. First, the daily time series of
sentiment and disagreement is not a stationary process. Second, there is a V −shape
(Λ−shape ) in sentiment (disagreement) between February 19, 2020 and March 31,
2020. Third, the pattern of sentiment and disagreement is homogeneous for investors
across and within investment philosophy, horizons, and experiences. Fourth, the pattern of sentiment and disagreement is heterogeneous across sectors. Fifth, the financial sector is the most pessimistic while healthcare is the most optimistic during the
COVID-19 pandemic.
There are several unexplored and exciting directions for further investigation on
the StockTwits dataset. For example, John Maynard Keynes claims that when there is
too much activity in the market, e.g., during the crisis, investors/agents trade mostly
by looking at each otherâĂŹs strategies rather than information. Therefore, it would
be interesting to explore what kind of investor influences other investors and how
he/she dominates the market. To do so, one can use a multivariate time-dependent
point process such as Hawkes Processes, see Aït-Sahalia et al. (2015), among others.

Figure 3: Daily time series of sentiment and disagreement, as well as, disagreement
correlation matrix.
Panel (a): this figure exhibits the daily time series of sentiment and disagreement of
users based on their approach. A user can fill out his/her profile by approach, experience, and holding period (investment horizon). We first label each bearish message as
−1 and each bullish message as 1. We then take the arithmetic average of these classifications at the group1 × day × group2 level: AvgSentimentitg =

Bullish − N bearish
Nitg
itg
Bullish + N bearish
Nitg
itg

.

Group1 can be either all firms, sectors, industries, or specific firm, sector, or industry. Group2 can either be all investors or investors with a given investment
philosophy, experience, or holding period (investment horizon) level. Furthermore,
to follow the sentiment’s trend, we use rolling windows of the past seven days
AvgSentimentitg for measuring the sentiment at each day. Disagreement is calculated
by: Disagreementitg =

q

1 − AvgSentiment2itg . Panel (b): these two heatmaps present

the disagreement correlation matrix of users by investment philosophy, experience,
and holding period.

Figure 5: Daily time series of sentiment and disagreement across sectors.
This figure exhibits the daily time series of sentiment and disagreement of users within their approach. A posted messages on
StockTwits can include a cashtage, i.e., $ticker, to specify the messages is related to which firm. By mentioning a ticker the
posted message can belong to one of these sectors: basic materials, financial, consumer goods, healthcare, industrial goods,
technology, utilities, service, and conglomerates.There are four options for this section: day trader, position trader, long term
trader, and swing trader. We first label each bearish message as −1 and each bullish message as 1. We then take the arithmetic
average of these classifications at the group1 × day × group2 level: AvgSentimentitg =

Bullish − N bearish
Nitg
itg
Bullish + N bearish
Nitg
itg

. Group1 can be either

all firms, sectors, industries, or specific firm, sector, or industry. Group2 can either be all investors or investors with a given
investment philosophy, experience, or holding period (investment horizon) level. Furthermore, to follow the sentiment’s trend,
we use rolling windows of past seven days AvgSentimentitg for measuring the sentiment at each day. Disagreement is calculated

q

1 − AvgSentiment2itg .
