Abstract
Background: Bangladesh govt. launched a nationwide vaccination drive against SARS-CoV-2 infection from early
February 2021. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccines and examine the
factors associated with the acceptance in Bangladesh.
Method: In between January 30 to February 6, 2021, we conducted a web-based anonymous cross-sectional survey among
the Bangladeshi general population. The multivariate logistic regression was used to identify the factors that influence the
acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccination.
Results: 61.16% (370/605) of the respondents were willing to accept/take the COVID-19 vaccine. Among the accepted
group, only 35.14% showed the willingness to take the COVID-19 vaccine immediately, while 64.86% would delay the
vaccination until they are confirmed about the vaccine’s efficacy and safety or COVID-19 become deadlier in Bangladesh.
The regression results showed age, gender, location (urban/rural), level of education, income, perceived risk of being
infected with COVID-19 in the future, perceived severity of infection, having previous vaccination experience after age
18, having higher knowledge about COVID-19 and vaccination were significantly associated with the acceptance of
COVID-19 vaccines.
Conclusion: The research reported a high prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine refusal and hesitancy in Bangladesh. To
diminish the vaccine hesitancy and increase the uptake, the policymakers need to design a well-researched immunization
strategy to remove the vaccination barriers. To improve vaccine acceptance among people, false rumors and
misconceptions about the COVID-19 vaccines must be dispelled (especially on the internet) and people must be exposed
to the actual scientific facts.

1 Introduction
The COVID-19 (the disease triggered by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARSCOV-2)) infection,
declared as a “pandemic” by the World Health Organization, has spread to all the countries of the world and as of February
20, 2021, infected more than 111 million people and claimed more than 2.4 million innocent lives [1]. The emergence of
COVID-19 has had a devastating effect on global healthcare systems with a ripple impact on every aspect of human life as
we experience it. It has been branded as a black swan occurrence [2] and compared to the economic scene of World War
Two [3].With no proven treatments or medicines found, governments across the world imposed border blackouts, travel
bans, and quarantine [4] in a bid to halt the spread of the virus that caused a voluminous economic downturn. The pandemic
overwhelmed the healthcare systems worldwide as they cannot cope with the unprecedented number of patients requiring
ICUs [5] and other special care. Numerous doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals were infected with the virus
since they are in direct contact with COVID-19 patients and a significant portion of them died. Therefore, healthcare
professionals have been affected by the increased burden of mental health issues [6]. As of today, the pandemic continues
to ravage the world.
Scientists and researchers throughout the world have been working relentlessly to find a way to get rid of the lethal disease.
To combat communicable diseases, vaccines are considered effective in developing a long-lasting immune system. About
2-3 million deaths per year are avoided by vaccination [7]. In pandemics such as 1957, 1968, 1976, and 1977 outbreaks
and the H5N1 outbreak (1997-1998), and the 2009 H1N1 outbreak, many vaccines were developed [8]. In the case of the
COVID-19 pandemic, about 100 vaccines are in pre-clinical/clinical trials and some of them have already been approved
1

for mass inoculation [9]. With the approval of vaccines for COVID-19, it is being expected that the pandemic can be
controlled.
However, the development of vaccines is not the last thing to put an end to such a ubiquitous and devastating virus. Scholars
of vaccine hesitancy and adoption are warning policymakers and the scientific community that a successful vaccine is only
the beginning. Based on previous experiences with pandemic vaccines and vaccine hesitancy more broadly, a wellresearched strategy for rollout and adoption might be required in every country [10]. Most current disease outbreak
experience–the H1N1 outbreak in 2009, witnessed poor immunization amongst adults, one study showing that 26 percent
of refusers were worried about safety and 17 percent did not believe in the vaccine [11]. A recent study conducted in the
USA revealed that approximately 68% of all respondents are willing to get vaccinated against the COVID-19 with concerns
about side effects and efficacy [12]. In a comprehensive survey of 19 nations conducted in June 2020, 72% of participants
suggested they were either likely or very likely to take a vaccine, ranging from 89% in China to only 55% in Russia [13].
The question arises, “Why are people unwilling to get vaccinated against a devastating disease?”. There is a plethora of
research on the factors that influence vaccine uptake. Prior studies on seasonal and H1N1 influenza vaccinations have
shown that vaccine attitudes and beliefs are linked to vaccination intentions, which are a good predictor of vaccination
uptake [14,15]. According to one UK-based study, higher vaccination intentions were linked to the belief that the
COVID-19 disease would last a lot longer, while lower vaccination intentions were linked to the belief that the dangers
of COVID-19 had been inflated by the media [16]. Another study examined the links between vaccine intention and
sociodemographic characteristics, concluding that lower vaccination intention was connected to younger age and Black
and minority ethnicity [17]. However, the factors affecting vaccine intention and uptake might vary substantially by
territory, culture, and socioeconomic conditions.
In Bangladesh, from the very beginning of the pandemic, a substantial amount of unawareness, rumors, and misinformation
among general people about COVID-19 have been reported [18]. It is also expected that there might be considerable
misinformation and hesitancy in taking COVID-19 vaccines. Bangladesh govt. has revised its plan to inoculate 3.5 million
instead of 6 million in February 2021 due to lukewarm response to online registration for COVID-19 vaccination [19]. It
also relaxed the age limit to 40 years from previously stated 55 years for general people. This points to the unwillingness
of the people of Bangladesh about receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. Bangladesh govt. has ordered and paid for at least 30
million doses of Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine that will be delivered in installments across 2021 and also will receive
another 68 million shots under the Covax initiative [20], led by the World Health Organization and Gavi, the Vaccine
Alliance [19].
The Bangladesh govt has done a tremendous job in securing a good amount of shots of vaccines. Now, the challenge is to
persuade people to take the vaccines. This study aims at investigating the knowledge, attitudes, and intention of people
towards COVID-19 vaccines and the factors associated with the intention to be vaccinated in Bangladesh. For these
purposes, we conducted an online anonymous survey between January 30 to February 6, 2021. The importance of
conducting such a study in context to Bangladesh cannot be stressed enough as it would act as a guide for the Bangladesh
govt. to encourage uptake among the general population.

2 Methods
2.1

Study Design and study participants

In this study, we conducted a cross-sectional, web-based anonymous survey between January 30 to February 6, 2021. The
participants were self-interviewed using an electronic questionnaire. They were able to take part in the survey after an
eligibility check step. One who was aged 18 or over and lived in Bangladesh was able to participant in this survey. The
question was translated into Bangla, which was developed in English. The respondents were informed that their
participation was voluntary and after completing the survey they were requested to share the link with their contacts or
acquaintances. Prior to circulating the questionnaire online, the questionnaire was validated and pilot tested.

2.2

Sample size

Since this study is aimed to examine the acceptability of the COVID-19 vaccine among the general population in
Bangladesh and there was no previous literature from Bangladesh that examined the associated factors with this. We
assumed that 50% of the general people have the factor of interest. And, we found the sample size is 591 using an online
sample size calculator [21,22] by assuming a 65% percent response rate, 5% precision or margin error, and 50% proportion
with a 95% confidence interval for the total population size of 1630046161 [23].

2.3

Instruments

The researchers shared and advertised the KoBoToolbox online survey link to the public throughout the social network
platforms of Facebook, WhatsApp, and Email. The questionnaire consisted of 5 sections: (i) Demographic background;
(ii) Knowledge about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccination (iii) Belief and attitude (iv) Perceived barrier, perceived
likelihood, perceived severity (v) Vaccine acceptability. The questionnaire was based on previous research [24–26].
2

2.3.1

Demographic background

At the beginning of the survey, we completed the eligibility check by asking two questions “How old are you (in years)?”
and “Do you currently live in Bangladesh?”. This part of the questionnaire also contains personal details, including sex,
religion, marital status, occupational status and monthly household income, and previous vaccination experience.
2.3.2

Knowledge about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccination

In this part, to measure the knowledge regarding COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccination, participants were asked a series
of yes/no questions. Such as “Is COVID-19 a lethal infectious disease?”, “Is COVID-19 deadlier for elderly people (60+ years)?”,
“Do only elderly and sick people die of COVID-19?”, “Can COVID-19 not spread from one to another by contact?”, “Are hot
and humid countries like Bangladesh safe from COVID-19?”, “Is it human-made and deliberately released?”, “Was the COVID-19 virus
genetically engineered as part of a biological weapons program?”, “Is this a normal disease like cold/cough and fever?”, “Do people
recover from it without any treatment?”, “Is COVID-19 caused by the same virus that causes influenza (flu)?”, “Testing can help
people determine if they are infected with SARS-CoV-2, what do you think?”, “Is there any effective medicine available for treating
COVID-19/ coronavirus?”.

2.3.3

Belief and attitude

In this part, we asked several questions with three options “Agree”, “Neutral”, “Disagree” to investigate the beliefs and
attitudes of participants about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccination. For instance, the attitudes toward the COVID-19
and COVID-19 vaccination were inspected by asking “Vaccination is an effective way to prevent and control a disease”, “Young
(less than 30) and children do not need any vaccination against COVID 19 ”, “We need to prioritize going back to our normal routines
(opening schools, colleges, Office) as soon as possible by maintaining safety protocols”, “It should be a crime if people know that they
have COVID-19 but they don’t isolate them”, “The Covid-19 vaccines that are being inoculated worldwide are effective and safe ”,
“Vaccines should be marketed and distributed entirely by the government in Bangladesh- what do you think?”.
2.3.4

Perceived berried, perceived likelihood, and perceived severity

We cover perceived likelihood by asking “What do you think is the chance that you will get COVID-19 in the future?”
with options “Low chance”, “Medium chance” and “Higher chance”. The perceived severity was also covered by asking
“How severe do you think it would be if you get COVID-19?” with three options “Not at all/ low severe”, “Medium
severe”, “Higher severe”. The perceived barriers toward the COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccination were inspected by
asking two questions “If I decided to get the COVID-19 vaccine, it would be herd to find a provider or clinic that could give me the
vaccine.” With three options “Agree”, “Neutral” and “Disagree” and “The COVID-19 vaccine might have side effects” with similar
three options.
2.3.5

Vaccine acceptability

Vaccine acceptability was the main outcome of this study. Firstly the participants who chose “Yes” to the question “Have
you heard of any vaccine that is going to be inoculated in Bangladesh?” were asked, “Bangladesh Govt. is going to inoculate
COVID-19 vaccine, will you take it?”. If the respondent chose “No” then we observed the reasons for not accepting the
covid-19 vaccine by asking a multiple-choice question. Otherwise, we asked “When will you or your family members take
the vaccine?” with the options “Will take as soon as possible” “After 2-6 months if seems safe and effective”, “If COVID19 becomes deadlier in Bangladesh”, and “Not sure”. We also observed the willingness to pay for COVID-19 vaccination
by asking “What should be the price of a complete dose of a vaccine?” with three options “should be free”, “1-1000”,
“1000+”. We also observed perception about vaccination priority group by asking “Considering the current scenarios, who
do you think should receive the first shipment of the vaccine in Bangladesh?” with options “Healthcare
workers/professionals”, “Elderly people (60+ years)”, “People who have underlying diseases”, “Politicians”, “Others”.

2.4

Consent and Ethical Consideration

A voluntary online consent was taken by sharing a consent form on the timeline/inbox/WhatsApp of the respondents, which
contained the outline of the research purpose and brief instructions regarding the survey.

2.5

Statistical analysis

The acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine is the primary outcome of this study. We classified respondents into two groups
(accept group and refuse group) based on the response to the question “Bangladesh Govt. is going to inoculate COVID-19
vaccine, will you take it?”. Among the accept group who chose “will take as soon as possible” to the question “when will
you or your family member take it?” further classified into vaccine “immediate” group. And others who selected any of
3

the options among “After 2-6 months if seems safe and effective”, “If COVID-19 becomes deadlier in Bangladesh” and
“Not sure” assigned to vaccine delay group[27]. We calculated the knowledge score for each of the participants based on
the number of valid/correct answers for the 12 questions that were asked in the subsection Knowledge about COVID-19
and COVID-19 vaccination. Knowledge score can vary from 0 to 12.
We have done the exploratory analysis/descriptive statistics (bivariate analysis, frequencies analysis, means, graphs, etc.)
to inspect the socio-demographic characteristics, perceived barriers, perceived likelihood, perceived severity, willingness
to pay, beliefs, and attitudes toward COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccination. The chi-square test was performed to compare
the baseline information among two groups (accept group and refuse group; immediate and delay group). The multivariate
logistic regression was also performed to identify the influencing factors in decision-making for accepting the COVID-19
vaccine among both pairs of groups (accept group and refuse group; immediate and delay group). Logistic regression
produced the odds ratio (OR), 95% confidence interval (95% CI), and P-value. The factors were considered to be endorsed
in the regression models which showed a statistically significant correlation (at 10% level of significance) within the
bivariate analysis.

3 Results
Six hundred and forty-seven people opened the survey link. Among them, twenty-five people refused the survey, seventeen
people were not eligible to complete the survey and six hundred and five people submitted the completed survey. The
characteristics of participants are presented in Table 1. As desired, the sample is broadly representative of Bangladesh's
general population (Islam 90.25%, Hinduism 8.26, Buddhism 0.83, and Christianity 0.66 [28]). The majority of the
respondent tended to be aged between less than 50 (82.78%), and male (62.15%). More than half of the respondents live
in urban areas (60.83%). A large proportion of respondents have a University degree (45.45%) while 26.94% are hon’s
running students and 27.60% respondents passed HSC/Alim/ Vocational degree/Nursing or less. A small portion of the
participants (18.68%) had previous vaccination experience after age 18.
Overall, 61.16% (370/605) of the respondents were classified as an accept group and among them, 35.14% (130/307) were
willing to take it immediately, and the rest 47.84% (240/605) wanted to delay in taking a COVID-19 vaccine (see Fig 1).
Most of the participants (71.74%) expressed that the COVID-19 vaccine should be free and the rest of the participants
indicate they would like to pay out of pocket for a vaccine was (25.29%) Tk 1-1000, and (2.98%) more than 1000. To
inspect the reasons behind the unwillingness of accepting the COVID-19 vaccine, we asked a question with multiple
selection options. Among 235 participants who showed unwillingness to accept the COVID-19 vaccine, 78.52% were
worried about the side effects or safety of the COVID-19 vaccine, 76.17% were doubtful about the efficacy of the COVID19 vaccine. Some of the respondents (42%) were also doubtful about the COVID-19 Vaccine since it is coming from India
(Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine produced by Serum Institute, India). Almost 36% of respondents thought vaccination is not
necessary since COVID-19 is going away or they are young (See Fig 2).
The results from multivariate logistic regressions are shown in Table 4. Parameter estimates of the multivariate logistic
regression indicate the odds of occurring the event into the concerned categories of the predictor variable compared to the
odds of occurring the event into the reference category of the same predictor variable. Here, the odds of accepting the
vaccine is defined as the ratio of the probability of accepting the vaccine and the probability of rejecting the vaccine [29].
The model was based on 605 cases with complete data and showed an association between willingness to be vaccinated
(yes/no) and predictor variables. Another model was based on 370 cases (vaccine accepted group) that explored the
association between willingness to immediate vaccination and predictor variables. The potential predictors were trained in
the model if they showed significant association (at a 10% level of significance) with the corresponding response variable
in Table 3. The findings indicate that the odds of acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine among female respondents is 62%
lower than the male respondents. The respondents aged 30 to 50 and 51 to 70 had a 6.79 and 7.89 times higher (respectively)
chance to accept the COVID-19 vaccine compared to respondents aged 18 to 29. The odds of accepting the COVID-19
vaccine among respondents who live in rural areas is 81% lower in comparison with the respondents who live in urban
areas. The participants who have a university degree and who are hon’s (undergrad) running students had 21.38 times
higher odds of taking the COVID-19 vaccine compared to the participants who had a lower educational qualification
(HSC/Alim/Vocational education/Nursing or less). Respondents with income 30.000 to 39,999 showed 4.35 times higher
odds, income 40,000–49,999 had 8.95 times higher odds, income 50,000–74,999 displayed 8.44 times higher odds, and
income 75,000 or over had 6.31 times higher odds to accept the COVID19 vaccine compared to respondents with income
less than 30,000. Respondents with previous vaccination experience after the age of 18 years had 4.79 times higher odds
compared to respondents who do not have any vaccination after age 18 years. People who disagreed with the statement
“the vaccines that are being inoculated worldwide are effective and safe” had a 90% lower likelihood to accept the COVID19 vaccine relative to those who agreed with it. Participants who believe they have a medium and a high chance to be
infected with COVID-19 in the future showed respectively 3.19 times and 8.68 times higher odds of taking the COVID19 vaccine compare to the respondents who believe they have low or no chance to be infected with COVID-19 in future.
Respondents who believe if they get infected with COVID-19 it would be highly severe demonstrated 4.47 times higher
odds of being in the vaccine accept group compared to the respondents who believe if they get infected with COVID-19 it
would be mild. The people with good knowledge about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines exhibited 22.23 times higher
4

odds of accepting the COVID-19 vaccine compare to people with lower knowledge about COVID-19 and COVID-19
vaccine.
The odds of accepting vaccines immediately was 47% lower among female respondents than male. The odds of accepting
the COVID-19 vaccine immediately was 2.03 times higher among rural respondents compared to urban respondents. Hindu
participants displayed 3.79 times higher odds of taking the COVID-19 vaccine immediately compared to Muslim
participants. The odds of taking the COVID-19 vaccine immediately was 84% lower for the respondents who heard about
any vaccine (s) that have been approved globally for mass inoculation compare to respondents who did not hear about any
vaccine (s) that have been approved globally for mass inoculation. Married people had almost 2 times higher odds of being
vaccinated immediately compared to unmarried people. Participants who disagreed with the statement “the vaccines that
are being inoculated worldwide are effective and safe” had a 68% lower likelihood to accept the COVID-19 vaccine
immediately compared to those who agreed with it.
Participants were asked a series of yes/no questions to assess more general knowledge and belief about COVID-19 and
COVID-19 Vaccination. The percentage of yes, no and don’t know with the correct answer can be seen in Table 2. A large
number of respondents (62.15%) think that COVID-19 is a lethal infectious disease. Almost half (51.40%) of respondents
provided a positive answer with the question “Is COVID-19 deadlier for elderly people (60+ years)” and 84.63% of respondents
provided the correct answer to the question “Do only elderly and sick people die of COVID-19?”. Very few (30.51%) of
the participants thought that COVID-19 is a normal disease like cold/cough and fever. The survey results showed overall
39.67% of respondents have good knowledge, 44.97% of respondents have medium knowledge and 16.36% have limited
knowledge about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccination (Fig 3). Attitudes and beliefs towards vaccination, perceived
barriers, and perceived risks were also inspected in Table 2. A large proportion of respondents (74.71 %) agreed with the
statement “vaccination is an effective way to prevent and control a disease” while 15.54% disagreed and 9.75% were
neutral. A small proportion of 10.91% agreed with the statement “Young (less than 30) and children do not need any vaccination
against COVID 19” while 54.55% disagreed and 34.55% were neutral. A large proportion ( 39.01%) of respondents were
neutral with the statement “The COVID-19 vaccines that are being inoculated worldwide are not effective and safe” while 37.85%
agreed and 23.14% disagreed. A lower portion (28.10%) of the respondents reported that it would not be herd to find a
provider or clinic that could give him/her the vaccine while 42.31% opposed the view. A small proportion of the
respondents (34.05%) mentioned that there is a low chance to get COVID-19 in the future, while 40.17% mentioned
medium chance, and 25.79% mentioned medium chance. Concerning perceived severity, 23.47% of respondents indicated
that they would experience highly severe COVID-19 symptoms, 36.36%, and 40.17% indicated medium and low,
respectively.

4 Discussion
We conducted a cross-sectional study among randomly selected individuals across the whole country to inspect the
potential acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccines and factors associated with the acceptance. Almost 61.16% (370/605) of
the respondents would like to accept the COVID-19 vaccine. Among the vaccine accepted group, only 35.14% have shown
the willingness to take the COVID-19 vaccine immediately, while 61.62% would delay the vaccination until they are
confirmed about vaccine’s efficacy and safety or COVID-19 becomes deadlier in Bangladesh. And the remaining 3.24%
would delay the vaccination but they don’t know the reasons for the delay (Fig 1). However, still, a large proportion
(38.84% or 235/605) of respondents showed unwillingness to accept the COVID-19 vaccine and reported several reasons
behind it. The main reasons include doubt about the side effects (78.52%), worries about the vaccine’s effectiveness
(76.17). Some of the respondents indicated unwillingness because they think they do not need vaccine (36.58%), some do
not want the vaccine since it is coming from India (36.58%), and some do not believe in vaccination (36.58) Fig 2. For the
newly introduced vaccine, safety has been reported as one of the major concerns [30,31]. Several new vaccines have been
developed worldwide and one of them (Oxford-AstraZeneca) has been selected to circulate in Bangladesh. No clinical trial
was conducted in Bangladesh for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and the govt. approved the vaccine following the
approval of India without any study of their own. There was no evidence for reference about the COVID-19 vaccine’s
safety in the context of Bangladesh. This might be one of the main probable reasons for observing vaccine delay in this
study. The vaccine confidence in the public would lower because of the uncertainties of new vaccines and new infectious
diseases [32]. Although estimates of herd immunity and vaccination are changing rapidly, some of the estimates indicated
at least 60% of a population needs to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity. To ensure equitable distribution of COVID19 vaccine, it is crucial to make a projection of the acceptance in public and identify the predictors associated with vaccine
acceptance [25,33]. However, without any projection, in Bangladesh, a nationwide COVID-19 vaccination campaign
started on February 7, 2021, and 0.26% of people were registered to receive the COVID-19 vaccine and 0.1% were
vaccinated till February 27, 2021[34]. On March 24 the dose administration rate in Bangladesh was 3%. Although this is
a good achievement for Bangladesh, this vaccination rate is still lower than many countries such as UK (46%), United
States (38%), Maldives (41%), India (3.6%) [35].
14

In this study, we attempted to identify factors that influence the decision-making of respondents of accepting the COVID19 vaccines. We found that COVID-19 vaccine acceptability has a statistically significant correlation with sociodemographic characteristics such as age, gender, higher educational qualification, employment status (See Table 2). Table
3 presents the results of regressions by modeling the acceptability of the COVID-19 vaccine and willingness to be
vaccinated immediately.
Determining the factors of acceptability of vaccine or immediate vaccination are complex and context-specific and the
factors vary with time, place, and type of vaccines [31,36]. In this study, the vaccine acceptability was higher among males,
older, and highly educated people. Higher acceptability was also found among people who live in urban areas and have
higher incomes. The socio-demographic factors were also found as significant factors for pandemic vaccine acceptability
in the UK, France, Australia, US, and Japan [25,26,37–39]. In Saudi Arabia, only age and marital status were found as
significant factors in determining the willingness of accepting the COVID-19 vaccines [36]. We found that one of the
strong correlates of vaccine acceptability was previous vaccination experience in adulthood. People who think they are at
a higher risk of being infected with COVID -19, who believe that COVID-19 might be highly severe for them and good
knowledge about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccination were also found to be significantly linked with vaccine
acceptability. The previous vaccination, vaccination beliefs, and attitudes about COVID-19 vaccination were also found
as significant determinants in Italy, UK, China [40,25,27]. Higher knowledge about COVID-19 symptoms, transmission
routes, and prevention and control measures against COVID-19 were found associated with willingness of accepting
COVID-19 among general population vaccine in Greece[41].
Although the COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rate was found a bit higher (61.16%) among the public in Bangladesh, there
are some barriers in the way of converting from the vaccination intention to real uptake attitudes. A large proportion of
people (64.86%) with the willingness to be vaccinated would delay taking the vaccine until the safety and efficacy of the
COVID-19 vaccine are confirmed. Vaccine safety has been reported as the main barrier for deciding for immediate
vaccination among people especially for vaccines that are newly developed [37,42,43]. For instance, in a large vaccine
accepted group (67%) in Australia, 13% of them wanted to delay in vaccination to see the efficacy and safety [11]. Several
factors were identified in our study that are influencing the immediate vaccination intention among the public in
Bangladesh. Gender, religion, region, and marital status were found to be associated with immediate vaccination. People
who live in rural areas and males were more likely to be vaccinated immediately. The previous vaccination experience
after the age of 18 was significantly associated with vaccine acceptance, though, it was not a significant factor for
immediate vaccination which conflicts with other studies in different countries [11,37,38]. Employment status and
knowledge about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccination were not significant in immediate vaccination decision-making
among the Bangladeshi people.

Our results may be used to develop successful vaccination plans and immunization services for people who are afraid
and/or hesitant of taking COVID-19 vaccines. To increase vaccine acceptability among rural people, baseless rumors and
myths (especially on social media) against the COVID-19 vaccines must be checked and they should be reached out with
scientific facts describing the safety and efficacy of the vaccines. To inspire females to get vaccinated, specialist doctors’
opinions can be spread through social media, television, radio, and print media. General people and celebrities who have
already taken the vaccine should share their experience (of no, mild, or severe side-effects) on social media and other mass
media. Topics on infectious diseases, their preventive measures, and vaccination should be included in the textbooks to
better prepare for future pandemics.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to inquiry about the acceptability of the newly developed COVID-19
vaccine among Bangladeshi people. Our study divided participants based on the acceptance levels (immediate or delayed
acceptance or refusal to accept) and provides associated factors that influence the vaccine acceptability and immediate
vaccination. This study sheds light on the current scenarios of public attitudes and willingness regarding COVID-19
vaccination. Based on the findings, policymakers can identify the most priority groups (older than 70, rural, and women)
or communities that need special attention in COVID-19 vaccination campaigns. Since a higher vaccination rate is the key
factor to achieve herd immunity, mass people must be inspired to get vaccinated [44]. This research will help the
policymakers make an effective vaccination strategy for a greater uptake rate of vaccines in a bid to control the COVID19 pandemic.
However, this study has some limitations. Since the offline face-to-face survey is not possible during the COVID-19
pandemic, we have used the online platform to collect information that may limit the representativeness of the sample. We
only reached out to those who had access to the internet and smart devices. A similar study was necessary before developing
the COVID-19 vaccine to understand the changes in vaccination intention. Since self-reported information may lead to
information bias, the findings of this study may differ from the real scenario. Further study is needed to inspect the changes
in vaccination intention and its’ determinants during the pandemic.

Conclusion
15

A high prevalence of refusal and hesitancy about COVID-19 vaccination in Bangladesh was observed in the study. The
safety concern seemed to be the main reason for the unwillingness to accept vaccines. To increase the immediate
vaccination and vaccine acceptance rate among the public which is touted to be the best way to get rid of the devastating
COVID-19 pandemic, vaccination campaigns need to be designed. Special emphasis should be given to inspire rural
people, females, and senior citizens (70+). Besides, evidence-based communications and health education can reduce
public vaccine hesitancy and concern about vaccine safety.
