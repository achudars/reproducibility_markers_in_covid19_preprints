Abstract
To date, the only effective means to respond to the spreading
of COVID-19 pandemic are non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs),
which entail policies to reduce social activity and mobility restrictions.
Quantifying their effect is difficult, but it is key to reduce their social
and economical consequences. Here, we introduce a meta-population
model based on temporal networks, calibrated on the COVID-19 outbreak data in Italy and applied to evaluate the outcomes of these two
types of NPIs. Our approach combines the advantages of granular
spatial modelling of meta-population models with the ability to realistically describe social contacts via activity-driven networks. We focus
on disentangling the impact of these two different types of NPIs: those
aiming at reducing individuals’ social activity, for instance through
lockdowns, and those that enforce mobility restrictions. We provide a
valuable framework to assess the effectiveness of different NPIs, varying with respect to their timing and severity. Results suggest that
the effects of mobility restrictions largely depend on the possibility to
implement timely NPIs in the early phases of the outbreak, whereas
activity reduction policies should be prioritised afterwards.

Introduction

Following the first report of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, COVID19 has risen above 70 million cases and 1, 599, 922 reported deaths as of 13th
December 2020 [1]. The ongoing pandemic quickly reached Europe during February and March 2020, forcing most of the countries to implement unprecedented
non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to fight the spread [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Some
of these interventions promote policies to reduce human-to-human interactions,
for example by enforcing social distancing, halting nonessential activities, closing
schools, and banishing large gatherings [2, 5, 6]. Others limit human mobility by
means of travel restrictions and bans [7, 6]. Due to the considerable economic and
social cost associated with the implementation of both of these types of policies
[8, 9, 10]), it is crucial to assess their effectiveness. Mathematical and computational epidemic models are key to accurately evaluate a wide range of what/if
scenarios, predicting the evolution of the pandemic for different choices of NPIs
[11, 12, 13, 7, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18].

One of the fundamental aspects of the spread of infectious diseases is its spatial
diffusion and the concurrent role of human mobility patterns [19, 20, 21]. Extensive studies on mobility within the COVID-19 pandemic revealed that population
movements are among the main drivers of the spatial spreading of the outbreak
[4, 22]. Network structures have emerged as a powerful framework to encapsulate
such mobility patterns within mathematical models of epidemics, especially by
means of meta-population models [23]. This modelling paradigm is based on the
definition of a set of communities (Provinces, Counties, or Regions), connected by
a network that captures daily short-range commuting and long-range mobility.
Different from most of the classical meta-population models that tend to assume homogeneous mixing within each community [23, 24], we propose a network
structure that accounts for the inherent, heterogeneous and time-varying nature
of human interactions [25, 26], together with behavioural changes in response to
the pandemic evolution [27, 28]. To this aim, individuals interact on the basis of
a mechanism inspired by activity-driven networks (ADNs) [29, 30]. Our model
includes two key aspects of social communities, mobility patterns and temporal,
heterogeneous networks of contacts. Within this meta-population model, we incorporate a variation of a susceptible–infected–removed (SIR) epidemic process [31].
Such an epidemic process allows to capture several key features of COVID-19, like
the existence of latency periods and the delay in the official reporting of infections
and deaths.
We calibrate the model on epidemic data from the first wave of the Italian
COVID-19 outbreak [32], to examine different scenarios that evaluate the spatial
effects of NPIs. In particular, we explore the interplay between reduction in social
activity and mobility restrictions. At the modelling level, the former mechanism
acts upon the network of contacts, while the latter modifies mobility patterns
between communities. Our findings reveal that the timing of the interventions is
essential toward effective implementations. We conclude that mobility restrictions
should be applied at the early stage of the epidemic and coupled with appropriate
policies to reduce social activity. Surprisingly, the impact of mobility restrictions is
spatially heterogeneous. For the Italian outbreak, this results in a greater benefit
for Southern regions, that is, those located far from the initial outbreak. The
overall effect of early travel restrictions in these areas leads to 12% of reduction in
the total number of deaths. We also examine differential interventions among age
cohorts, determining that the application of severe restrictions only to the most
vulnerable age cohorts would not be sufficient to effectively reduce the deaths toll.
Different phenomena are observed upon the relaxation of containment measures,
with the contribution of keeping mobility restrictions being negligible. In this phase
of the fight against the epidemic, policies limiting social activity (for instance, by
enforcing the use of face masks or social distancing) yield the main benefits in

Methods
Model
Meta-population activity-driven model

We consider a population of n individuals partitioned into a set H = {1, . . . , K} of
communities, located in bounded geographical areas (administrative divisions, such
as Regions, Provinces or Municipalities), where nh is the number of individuals in
the hth community. Communities are connected through a weighted graph that
models travel paths between them. The weight matrix W ∈ [0, 1]K×K , called
routing matrix, is a matrix with non-negative entries, zeros on the main diagonal
and row sums equal to 1, such that Whk is the fraction of members of community
h that move to community k per unit-time.
Individuals interact according to a mechanism inspired by ADNs [29, 30],
which accounts for the inherent, heterogeneous propensity of humans to interact
with others. Specifically, individuals are divided into P baseline activity classes
0 < a1 < a2 < · · · < aP ≤ 1, where the activity ai of individuals in the ith class
quantifies their nominal propensity to interact with others, which can be interpreted as the average probability for an individual belonging to the ith class to
generate interactions in a unit time-step. At each time-step and for each activity
class i, a fraction ai of individuals, selected uniformly at random, activates and
generates interactions with others, regardless of their class. This fraction of the
population is called active. Active individuals may generate interactions within
the community where they are located, or they may travel and interact in other
communities, before returning to their community, at the end of the time-step.
This aspect is included in a mobility parameter b ∈ [0, 1] that quantifies the baseline fraction of the active population that commutes to other communities; the
commuting unfolds according to the routing matrix W (Fig. 1). The remaining
fraction 1 − b of the active population does not commute and interacts locally
with individuals randomly selected within their community. We assume that the
P activity classes are equally distributed in different communities. Specifically,
we introduce the activity distribution vector η ∈ [0, 1]P such that the expected
number of individuals with activity class ai in the hth community is equal to the
product nh ηi . We finally introduce a parameter m ≥ 0 that captures the average
number of contacts generated by each active individual in a time-unit.
Two parameters α ∈ [0, 1] and β ∈ [0, 1] are introduced to model NPIs. The
former, α, models individuals’ self-isolation due to the awareness of the disease

spreading. In the model, this corresponds to scaling down the individual activity
from its baseline value ai to αai . The latter, β, captures the effect of mobility
restrictions, which are modelled by scaling down the baseline mobility parameter
from b to βb.

2.1.2

Disease progression

The disease progression is modelled according to an extension of the classical SIR
model (Fig. 2), which encapsulates a latency period between contagion and infectiousness, a limited duration of the infectious period, coinciding with the peak
of the viral load, and a delay for deaths reporting [2]. Specifically, we adopt
a susceptible–exposed–infectious–non-infectious–removed (SEINR) compartmental model (Fig. 2). After contagion, infected individuals become initially exposed
(E) before spontaneously moving into the infectious (I) compartment with rate ν.
Once the infectious period terminates (with rate µ), individuals transition to the
non-infectious compartment (N ), before recovering (or dying) with rate γ, which
is represented by the R compartment. The compartment N captures the delay between the end of the infectious period and the reporting of a death. The number
of deaths is the most reliable parameter for calibration, given the uncertainty in
reporting active infectious cases. The parameters have immediate interpretation:
1/ν is the average latency period of the disease (time from contagion to infectiousness), 1/µ is the average period of communicability (in which individuals are
infectious) and 1/γ captures the delay before reported deaths. Hence, 1/µ + 1/γ

is the average time from infectiousness to the reported death. We comment that
other important features of COVID-19 may be easily incorporated by considering
further compartments into the model, similar to [33]. In this vein, one may include,
for instance, a differentiation between symptomatic and asymptomatic infectious
individuals, which might help implement timely feedback control interventions.
The contagion mechanism involves an interaction. We introduce a parameter
λ ∈ [0, 1] that captures the fraction of susceptible individuals that become exposed
after an interaction with an infectious one. The contagion does not depend only on
λ, but also on individual properties (their activity) and network structure, as well
as on the prevalence of infectious individuals. We denote by Πhi (t) the contagion
function, that is, the fraction of susceptible individuals with activity ai and who
belongs to community h that becomes infected at time t, whose expression is
detailed in the following.

2.1.3

Dynamics

We consider the generic activity class i and community h ∈ H. Let Sih , Eih , Iih
and Nih be macroscopic variables counting the number of susceptible, exposed,
infectious and non-infectious individuals of class i in community h, respectively.
Clearly, nh ηi − Sih − Eih − Iih − Nih is the number of removed individuals in class
i and community h. In the thermodynamic limit of large populations [23, 34, 35],
n → ∞, we describe the epidemic spreading in terms of the macroscopic variables
by writing the following system of mean-field recurrence equations:
Sih (t + 1)
Eih (t + 1)
Iih (t + 1)
Nih (t + 1)

µIih (t) + (1 − γ)Nih (t).

(1)

We now detail the contagion mechanism and derive an explicit expression for

6

Πhi (t). To simplify the notation, we omit time t, that is, Πhi is used to denote
Πhi (t). In the thermodynamic limit of large populations n → ∞ and assuming that
the epidemic prevalence is small so that we can neglect the probability of having
multiple interactions with infectious individuals at the same time, the quantity Πhi
can be written as the sum of four different terms. The first summand accounts
for the contagions caused by the fraction αai (1 − βb) of active individuals from Sih
that remains in the hth community and interacts there with infectious individuals;
the second summand accounts for the infections caused by the fraction (1 − αβai b)
of Sih that remains in community h and comes in contact there with active infected
individuals; the third and the fourth summands account for the contagions of the
fraction αβai b of Sih that is active and moves to other communities interacting with
infected individuals or receiving interactions from active infectious individuals in
the community they move to, respectively. These four terms yield

2.2

Model calibration

We calibrate the model to reproduce the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy, setting
Provinces as communities, using epidemiological parameters from the medical literature [36, 37, 38], mobility data by the Italian National Institute of Statistics
(ISTAT) [39], and data of officially reported deaths [32]. Based on available empirical data on social contacts per age groups [40], we partition the population in two

7

activity classes. The population below 65 years old forms the high activity class,
and the population above 65 years old constitutes the low activity class. Different mortality rates are associated with the two classes to estimate the number of
deaths, base on serology-informed data [41]. The details of the model calibration
can be found in the following.

2.2.1

Calibration of the meta-population model

The Italian territory is divided into K = 107 Provinces, which are chosen as
communities, extracting the corresponding population nh from the census data
[39]. Provinces are administrative units that offer most of the essential services
to the population (supermarkets, hospitals, schools, public offices, restaurants,
etc.). Hence, our choice of granularity allows one to distinguish and disentangle
the effects of the two categories of NPIs considered in this paper, whereby activity
reduction refers to the execution of everyday-life activities within a Province, and
mobility restrictions prevent travels between Provinces. Provinces are grouped in
20 Regions, gathered in 5 macro-regions: North-West, North-East, Centre, South
and Islands (Supplementary material, Sec. S1 and Fig. S1).
We partition the population into P = 2 activity classes, based on age-stratified
data on social contacts [40], aggregating age-groups that form high or low number
of contacts, respectively. Specifically, the former contains people below 65 years
old, while the latter gathers people above 65 years old. According to the same
study, we set m = 19.77. The baseline activity classes a1 and a2 are determined
by matching the average number of contacts of the individuals in the classes. The
fraction ηi of population in each class is determined from the Italian age distribution [39]. Simulations are presented in the Supplementary material (Fig. S8) to
show robustness of our results for different class partitioning.
We consider two types of mobility: commuting pattern between Provinces and
long-range mobility. The former is directly obtained from the 2011 census data in
the ISTAT database [39], which has been validated and adopted to model mobility
in recent works on COVID-19 [13]. Comprehensive data on long-range mobility is
not available. We estimate it as follows. For each province, we consider the number
of nights spent in accommodation facilities over the period from February to May
2011, which represents the destinations of travellers [39]. Origins are estimated
based on the flows between macro-regions [39]. Assuming uniformity within each
macro-region, we set the origins proportional to the population of each Province.
Finally, W is obtained by combining the two origin-destination matrices (Fig. 3).
The mobility parameter b is estimated as the fraction of population that moves
outside their Province, using data from [39].
NPIs are implemented as follows. At t = t0 , we set α = β = 1. Then, based on

αlow . Such a decrease begins on 5th March (day of the enforcement of the first
social distancing measures) and ended on 20th March (when a severe lockdown is
enacted). Similar, β is reduced to βlow . As suggested in [42], mobility restrictions
have not been implemented uniformly county-wide: changes were enacted on 1st
March for macro-regions North-East, North-West and Centre, and on 7th March
for South and Islands. The values of αlow and βlow are identified from epidemic
data.

2.2.2

Calibration of the epidemic parameters

Epidemic parameters are taken from the literature on COVID-19. Specifically,
the latency period 1/ν and the infectious period 1/µ are taken from [2], based on
clinical estimations from [43, 44], respectively; γ is the inverse of the difference
between the average time from infectiousness to the reported death [45] and 1/µ.
The infection probability λ depends on the model of social interactions. Hence,
we identify it from real-world data.Table 1 reports the parameters used in our
simulations.

2.2.3

Parameter identification

We calibrated our model by fitting the temporal evolution of the reported deaths,
during the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy. Data at the Regional level were retrieved
from the official Italian Dipartimento della Protezione Civile [32] database. This
database starts on 24th February, and we had extended it backward in time for 20
days (until 4th February). We filled with zero deaths the section of the database
from 4th February to 20th February, and we manually corrected the database to
include seven deaths that were not reported therein in the period from 20th February to 23rd February (Supplementary material, Sec. S2). To calibrate the model
we focused on the period from 4th February (denoted as t0 ) to 18th May (denoted
as tend ), namely until the first relaxation of NPIs. To enhance the reliability of
the data we applied a weekly moving average.
Using the SEINR epidemic progression model, we computed the deaths in
Province h for activity class i as a fraction of the removed individuals Rih (t),
according to the class fatality ratio f1 = 0.045% and f2 = 5.6%. The latter
was inferred from a serology-informed estimate performed on age-stratified data
from Geneva, Switzerland [41], scaled on the Italian age-distribution using census
data [39]. Since we had no access to information about the initial number of
exposed Eih (t0 ) or infected Iih (t0 ) individuals, such initial conditions needed to be
identified. For each Province h and activity class i, we initialised the number of
exposed and infected as a fraction k1 and k2 of the total reported cases at the end
of the observation time (24th June) C h (tend ) from the official database [32]:
Eih (t0 ) = k1 ηi C h (tend )

and Iih (t0 ) = k2 ηi C h (tend ),

(4)

where k1 and k2 were identified together with the other parameters.
The parameter identification was formulated as a minimisation problem, solved
by means of a dual-annealing procedure [46]. Specifically, we defined the cost
function c as the weighted sum of the squared error between the number of deaths
predicted by the model and the Regional real data, normalised with respect to
the maximum number of deaths in the Region. To this aim, we defined the set of
Regions R and the partition of Provinces into Regions as the function π : H → R,
such that π(h) = r if and only if Province h was located in Region r. For each
r ∈ R, we introduced:

Results
Implementation of NPIs

Here, we elucidate the role of NPIs in halting the spread of COVID-19. We aim
at disentangling the contribution of the two most common kinds of interventions:
reduction of individuals’ activity, through lockdown or social distancing, and enforcement of mobility restrictions. We take as a reference the NPIs implemented
in Italy (detailed in the Supplementary material, Sec. S2) and identify the NPIrelated parameters from available data. The enforcement of lockdown and social
distancing policies, gradually enacted during a time-window of two weeks (from 5th
March 5 to 20th March) are modelled through a linear decrease of the α parameter
from 1 to αlow = 0.176. The effect of the nearly complete mobility restrictions between Provinces has been observed from 1st March in the northern macro-regions
and from 7th March in the southern ones [42]. We model these restrictions by
setting the mobility parameter to βlow = 0 on the corresponding dates.
We start from investigating the effect of mobility restrictions in combination
with activity reduction policies (Fig. 5a). We simulate the mobility restrictions as
being applied on 4th February, that is, almost one month earlier than the actual
date. We compare the number of deaths over the time-window that ranges from
4th February to the date of the first relaxation of NPIs in Italy (18th May). We
observe that the effect of mobility restrictions becomes significant for intermediate
levels of activity reduction policies (that is, 0.3 < α < 0.7). On the other hand,
a negligible effect of mobility restrictions is registered for milder levels of activity
reduction policies (α > 0.7) and for extremely severe activity reductions (α < 0.3).
The latter, counter-intuitive finding, is due to a balance between the increased
number of deaths in some northern macro-regions (close to the initial outbreak)
and the decrease of deaths in others (Supplementary material, Fig. S5).
To detail this mechanism, we examine the number of deaths in each macroregion, using different levels of mobility restrictions and setting the activity reduction to the lockdown level, αlow = 0.176 (Fig. 5b). Our results suggest that the

between the two NPI mechanisms, assuming an earlier application of mobility
restrictions, and activity reduction applied at the original date (5th March).
We consider different combinations of levels of activity reduction and mobility
restrictions, where higher levels of α or β denote less severe NPIs. The heat
map codes the reduction of deaths with respect to a scenario where mobility
restrictions are not applied. Panel (b) details the effect of earlier mobility
restrictions at a macro-regional level, assuming a level of activity reduction
as per the lockdown phase (αlow = 0.176). The inset illustrates the effect

impact of mobility restrictions is strongly dependent on their geographical location, and it vanishes if not timely implemented. Notably, we find that the timely
implementation of severe mobility restrictions would have reduced the number of
deaths by more than 12% in the Islands macro-region (that is, far from where the
outbreak was initially located) over the duration of severe NPIs. Such an advantage becomes smaller and smaller as the considered macro-regions are closer to
the initial location of the outbreak. Paradoxically, mobility restrictions becomes
even slightly detrimental if applied in the North-West macro-region, where the
outbreak started. This is due to the commute of infected individuals from the
most affected Provinces to the rest of the Provinces and of susceptible individuals
from less impacted Provinces to the rest of the country. For comparison, we also
report death count for the implementation of the same restrictions on 1st March,
corresponding to the actual date of their implementation. We observe that the
timing of NPIs is essential; an early application of travel restrictions by one month
would have saved twice as many lives. Similar results are obtained for the peak of
the epidemic incidence (Supplementary material, Figs. S6 and S7).
The large geographic variability of the number of deaths is confirmed in Figs. 6a–
6f, which depict the total number of deaths for two representative Provinces under
different timing and intensity of implementation of NPIs. While the Province of
Bergamo (in the North-West macro-region), one of the earliest and biggest outbreaks, seems unrelieved by mobility restrictions, the Province of Sud Sardegna (in
the Islands macro-region), an area much less affected by the pandemic than the
former, would have largely benefited by such an intervention. To deepen this aspect, we factor out the role of the two types of NPIs by performing a non-negative
matrix factorisation [47] on the outcome of our simulations at the Province level
(details in the Supplementary material, Secs. S3 and S4). Specifically, we focus on
values of α ranging over a ±50% interval with respect to the value of the lowest
activity coefficient αlow = 0.176, identified from real-world data during the lockdown, and we simulate the early application of mobility restrictions with different
intensity levels and timing. Our analysis leads to the characterisation of two sets of
Italian Provinces. The first (in green in Fig. 6g) comprises Provinces where timely
implemented mobility restrictions are effective in reducing epidemic prevalence (for
example, Sud Sardegna). The second set (in brown in Fig. 6g) contains Provinces
for which mobility restrictions have instead a negligible impact. Predictably, most
of the Provinces in the North-West (where the outbreak started) are unaffected by
mobility restrictions, while the majority of Provinces in South and Islands would
benefit from an early implementation of such restrictions.
Surprisingly, some important exceptions are identified. For instance, the Provinces
of Varese and Monza (close to the Milan metropolitan area) would have benefited
from timely mobility restrictions. We believe that this is due to the initially

scenarios. In panels (a,d), both mobility restrictions and activity reduction
are applied at the actual application dates. In panels (b,e) both strategies
are hypothetically implemented earlier by 15 days. In panels (c,g) mobility
restrictions are further set earlier on 4th February, while keeping activity
reduction applied earlier by only 15 days. In panels (a–c), the province of
Sud Sardegna are illustrated as an example of the positive effect of early mobility restrictions. In panels (d–f), the province of Bergamo look unaffected

small number of cases in those two Provinces, and to the large number of daily
commuters from those Provinces to the Milan Province and other neighbouring
locations, where the Italian outbreak started. Hence, the same dynamics between
North and South Italy is documented again over a much smaller spatial scale,
between Northern Provinces with larger initial difference in epidemic prevalence.
Similar results are observed for other intervention scenarios (Supplementary material, Fig. S2).
Finally, we discuss the possibility of implementing targeted activity reductions
that act independently on the two activity classes. This allows to study the effectiveness of differential intervention policies that could aim at strongly reducing
social activity for age cohorts that are more at risk of developing severe illness,
while implementing mild restrictions for younger people. Instead of a single parameter α, we thus introduce two parameters α1 and α2 that measure the activity
reduction for the high and the low activity class, respectively. The heat-map in
Fig. 7 illustrates the effect of different combinations of α1 and α2 on the total number of deaths; the level curves help understand the trade-off in targeting the two
classes. We observe that the total number of deaths is mostly determined by the
parameter α1 , that is, the activity reduction for the high activity class. Hence, our
results suggest that implementing targeted stay-at-home policies in which severe
activity reductions are only enforced on the age cohorts that are more at risk (in
our scenario, people over 65 years old) is not sufficient to reduce the overall death
toll.

Relaxation of NPIs toward reopening strategies

The proposed meta-population model enables the analysis of reopening strategies
to relax restrictions while avoiding resurgent outbreaks. This has recently emerged
as a key issue in the control of COVID-19 outbreaks in the medium- to long-term
period [48]. We run our calibrated model to simulate the epidemic until the date
of intervention relaxation. Then, we vary the values of parameters α and β to
account for the relaxation of the containment measures. Similar to the previous
analysis, we consider a set of different options for the parameters after intervention
relaxation and different times for starting the reopening strategies. Specifically, we
model the relaxation of the reduction of social activity by varying the parameter
α from αlow , identified during the lockdown, to a value α = 0.6. Likewise, we
describe the uplifting of mobility restrictions by varying the parameter β from 0
(no mobility allowed) to 1 (nominal mobility reinstated).
Our results suggest that the effect of maintaining mobility restrictions after the
relaxation of NPIs is negligible and dominated by the activity reduction (Fig. 8).
We evaluate the total number of deaths in a time-window of 60 days after the

Figure 7: Effect of targeted lockdown strategies. We consider the total number of deaths over a time-window of 104 days from the beginning of the
simulation (4th February) to the time corresponding to the relaxation of the
most severe NPIs in Italy (18th May). On the two axes, α1 and α2 correspond to activity reduction of high and low activity classes, respectively,
where higher levels of α denote less severe NPIs. Level curves are shown to
clarify how targeted interventions should be combined to produce the same
effect on the total number of deaths. The black dot represents the identified
activity reduction in model calibration.

relaxation date (18th May). Both at the Province level, for which we show the
examples of Sud Sargegna (Fig. 8a) and Bergamo (Fig. 8b), and at the aggregated country level (Fig. 8c), the contribution of mobility restrictions is little or
absent. These results are confirmed by other scenarios with different relaxation
dates (Supplementary material, Secs. S5 and S6 and Figs. S3 and S4). Overall,
this evidence indicates that activity reduction in the relaxation of NPIs should be
thoughtfully calibrated, trading-off the risk of resurgent outbreaks and the social
and economical costs associated with such policies. On the other hand, the further enforcement of mobility restrictions within the country after the end of the
epidemic wave does not seem to be beneficial in the relaxation phase.

Discussion

Motivated by the evidence of the key role of NPIs in the ongoing COVID-19
outbreak [2, 3, 4, 5, 6], we made an effort to propose a parsimonious mathematical framework to study NPIs and elucidate their impact on epidemic spreading.
Specifically, we combined a meta-population model, capturing the spatial distribution of the population and its mobility patterns [23, 24], with an ADN-based
structure, which reflects real-world features of social activity such as heterogeneity
[29, 30] and behavioural traits [27, 28]. We explicitly incorporated two types of
NPIs: actions aiming at reducing individuals’ activity (social distancing, forbidding gatherings and, in general, any measure that curtails the number of contacts
favouring the spread of the infection) and policies to restrict individuals’ mobility

19

(for instance, through travel bans). Through the lens of our modelling framework, we disentangled the effect of these two types of policies depending on the
time of their implementation. We calibrated the model with data on the ongoing
COVID-19 outbreak in Italy [32].
We leveraged the model to explore a wide range of what/if scenarios on spatiotemporal dynamics of COVID-19 spreading for different combinations of NPIs.
Our analysis allows to draw interesting conclusions on when and how to apply
NPIs to make the fight against the spread more effective. While the level of activity reduction is unequivocally a decisive factor, the impact of mobility restrictions
has a more nuanced impact. First, we observed that mobility restrictions produce
benefits only if applied at the early stage of the outbreak, and only if paired with
appropriate activity reduction policies. Moreover, we discovered that the effect
of mobility restrictions is strongly dependent on space. In fact, through a nonnegative matrix factorisation technique, we identified two sets of Provinces that
are differently affected by mobility restrictions. The first set, mostly consisting
of Provinces in the North (where the outbreak initially started), has little or no
benefit from mobility restrictions. The Provinces in the second set, instead, would
have benefited from early implementation of mobility restrictions. Surprisingly,
this set includes some of the Provinces in the north (most affected area). Then,
we discussed possible implementation of targeted NPIs, with severe restrictions
only for age cohorts that are more at risk of developing severe illness. Our modelling framework brought to light concerning limitations in the implementation
of these targeted interventions: although economical reasons may prompt these
interventions, their public health value could be limited. Finally, while mobility
restrictions are useful in the early stage of the outbreak, their late implementation
is ineffective. A different scenario is observed for the relaxation of NPIs, where
the level of activity reduction should be carefully and gradually relaxed.
Our study outlines several avenues of future research, which can be pursued
leveraging the generality of the heterogeneous meta-population framework proposed in this study. During the “first wave” of COVID-19 in Italy, NPIs have
been homogeneously implemented nationwide through Decrees of the Prime Minister. Hence, we have used uniform parameters among the Provinces. However,
from November 2020, local NPIs have been enacted. The proposed model could
benefit from the study of heterogeneous implementation (and relaxation) of NPIs
between Provinces and even the implementation of targeted mobility restrictions
between specific Provinces (through the modification of the routing matrix W ),
whose analysis is envisaged for future research. The outcome of such an analysis can inform policymakers on targeted interventions that may reduce social
and economical costs while effectively halting the epidemic. Also, other targeted
intervention policies, such as those leading to safe schools reopening, may be ex-

20

plored. These studies may be conducted at the entire country level or at a local
level. Country-wise interventions could be engineered by utilising further activity
classes that capture, for instance, students and teachers. In this vein, a contact matrix among activity classes could help capture inhomogeneous interaction patterns
between and within activity classes, similar to [40]. Local targeted interventions,
instead, may be pursued via our meta-population structure, where communities
are used to model specific locations, such as schools and neighbourhoods. The
introduction of a community that represents the rest of the world would enable
the study of the impact of closures of national borders.
While we considered a simple model for the epidemic progression, additional
compartments and transitions may be added to capture hospitalisation or testing
[33], and used to analyse different what/if scenarios and design feedback control
interventions, informed by the number of reported cases or hospitalisations [18]. A
limitation of our modelling framework lies in its deterministic formulation, which
prevents it from capturing phenomena such as local disease eradication. This
may be crucial to study the pandemic at longer time-scales, encompassing future
vaccination campaigns. A stochastic formulation of the meta-population activitydriven model may be proposed and utilised as a viable tool to shed light into
these important phenomena and understand their impact on the spreading process. Finally, the simplicity of our mathematical framework may be conducive
to a rigorous analytical treatment, involving for example the computation of the
epidemic threshold, toward providing further insight into the effect of NPIs on the
epidemic spreading.

Italian geographic organisation

The Italian territory is divided into four levels of administrative entities.
At the finer level, there are 7, 903 municipalities (local administrative units
according to the European standards of Nomenclature of Territorial Units for
Statistics - NUTS) that are grouped in 107 Provinces (NUTS-3). Provinces
are then organised in 20 Regions (NUTS-2), which comprise five macroregions (NUTS-1): North-West, North-East, Centre, South and Islands. See
Fig. S1 for a map. We considered Provinces as the communities of our
meta-population model. Such a choice has two main motivations. First,
municipalities are not autonomous entities, since most of them are small and
may not be able to provide all the necessary basic services to the population
(supermarkets, hospitals, public offices, etc.). Hence, it could be unrealistic
to propose that they are completely isolated with respect to the epidemic.
Furthermore, policies to reduce social interactions (such as school closures)
would impact the mobility between different municipalities, hindering the
possibility to disentangle the two categories of NPIs considered in this paper.
Second, Provinces are the smallest administrative entities for which epidemic
data can be considered consistently accurate and equally detailed nationwide.

Details of the non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF)

Here, we explain the non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) through the
scenario of early implementations of NPIs, whose results are shown in Fig. S2.
We simulated the total number of deaths, over a 104 days time-window, for
p different levels of α, q different levels of β, and for each Province h ∈ H.
The results of these simulations were stored in a set of non-negative matrices
Ph ∈ Rp×q
+ .
The NMF algorithm approximates each matrix Ph as a weighted sum of
an arbitrary number of basis matrices, which help understand the effect of
NPIs on all the Provinces. We select two basis matrices, denoted as C1 and
C2 , so that
Ph ≈ kh1 C1 + kh2 C2 ,

(1)

where kh1 and kh2 are two scalar weights that are specific to each matrix Ph .
The identification of both weights and basis matrices is performed through
the following steps. First, we normalise the entries of each matrix Ph between
|H|×(pq)

0 and 1. Then, we assemble a new matrix A ∈ R+

, containing the

vectorised of matrix Ph at row h. Third, we minimise the residual in the
|H|×2

Frobenius norm ||A − KH||F to calculate matrices K ∈ R+
2×(pq)

R+

and H ∈

. The two row vectors of matrix H contain the two basis matrices C1

and C2 in form of vectors, and the row vector h of matrix K comprises the
two weights kh1 and kh2 .

Application of NMF to the analysis of mobility restrictions

The application of the approach is presented in Fig. S2. As an illustration,
we examine Fig. S2e-S2f that details further Fig. 6(c,f) of the main document. From Fig. S2e, we register that matrix C2 encapsulates the beneficial
effect of mobility restrictions, since the numerical value of its entries reflect
the evidence that decreasing β from 1 (no mobility restrictions) to 0 (no
mobility allowed) results in a remarkable decrease in the number of deaths.
On the contrary, matrix C1 is associated with all the non-beneficial effects of
mobility restrictions. We remark that, by construction, the NMF yields the
two matrices C1 and C2 equal for all the Provinces. Hence, the relative magnitude of the two coefficients kh1 and kh2 indicates whether a given Province
is benefited or harmed by mobility restrictions. Fig. S2f plots the coefficient
pairs (kh1 , kh2 ), for each Province. To provide a more illustrative evidence,
a 2-means clustering algorithm [3] is applied to partition all Provinces in
two sets: those for which mobility restrictions are beneficial and those for
which they are detrimental. More details on the exemplary Provinces of
Sud Sardegna and Bergamo (explicitly labelled in Fig.S2f) are presented in
Fig. 6(c,f) of the main document. The other panels of Fig. S2 demonstrate
analogous results for different dates of applications of NPIs, for which the
effect of mobility restrictions is less evident.

number of deaths over a time-window of 104 days from the beginning of the
simulation (4th February) to the relaxation of the more severe NPIs (18th
May), where higher levels of α or β denote less severe NPIs. We plot the
two basis matrices for three different intervention scenarios. In (a,b), both
mobility restrictions and activity reduction are applied as per the actual
application dates. In (c,d), hypothetical 15-days early implementation of
both strategies. In (e,f), mobility restrictions are enacted even earlier, on
4th February, while activity reduction is applied 15 days in advance with
respect to its actual implementation. In (b,d,f), we show the Province’s
weights related to the two basis matrices, coloured respect to the results of
the k-means algorithm. This figure extends Fig. 6 in the main document,
which shows two exemplary Provinces.

(a,d,g), we consider a late hypothetical relaxation of the restrictions on July
1. In (b,e,h), we consider as relaxation date June 3, which corresponds to the
complete relaxation of mobility restrictions in Italy. In (c,f,i), we consider
as relaxation date 18th May, corresponding to the first relaxation of NPIs
in Italy. In (a–f), we report the results for two Provinces that have shown
different responses in the implementation of NPIs: (a–c) Sud Sardegna and
(d–f) Bergamo. In (g–i), we show the results aggregated at the country. This
figure provides further details to Fig. 8 of the main document, which only
contains panels (c,f,i).

NMF to analyse the relaxation of mobility
restrictions

NMF was utilised to perform similar what-if analyses on the scenarios of
relaxation of NPIs. Results are illustrated in Fig. S4. In all the considered
scenarios, the first component explained most of the variations, due to the
smaller values of the entries of matrix C2 and of the corresponding weights.
As a result, mobility restrictions are unlikely to have a primary effect during
relaxation of NPIs.

Additional supporting simulations and figures

Figure S5: Effect of early application of mobility restrictions, where higher
levels of α or β denote less severe NPIs. We consider the total number of
deaths over a time-window of 104 days from the beginning of the simulations
(4th February) to the time corresponding to the relaxation of the most severe
NPIs in Italy (18th May). We plot different combinations of levels of activity
reduction and mobility restrictions, implemented on 5th March (actual date)
and 4th February (early implementation), respectively. For each level of
activity reduction α (row of the heat-map), the effect of mobility restrictions
is reported in terms of the percentage difference in the total number of deaths
with respect to the corresponding case with no mobility restrictions (β = 1).
We show the results for six Provinces, selected as representative examples.
This figure extends the results illustrated in Fig. 5 of the main document,
which reports predictions aggregated at the country level.

Figure S6: Effect of early application of mobility restrictions on the peak
of the epidemic incidence, where higher levels of α or β denote less severe
NPIs. We consider the maximum number of new infected individuals from
the beginning of the simulations (4th February) to the time corresponding
to the relaxation of the most severe NPIs (18th May). In (a), we consider
the effect of different levels of mobility restrictions enacted on 4th February
(almost one month earlier than the actual dates). The figure inset shows
the effect of the same interventions applied on March 1 (the actual application date in North Italy). The activity reduction parameter is fixed to the
lockdown level αlow = 0.176. Results are aggregated at the macro-region
level and reported as the variation of the infected individuals at the peak
of the epidemic incidence Cpeak , with respect to the case with no mobility
restrictions (β = 1). In (b), we consider different combinations of levels of activity reduction and mobility restrictions, implemented on 5th March (actual
date) and 4th February (early implementation), respectively. For each level
of activity reduction α (row), the effect of mobility restrictions is reported
in terms of the percentage difference in the number of infected individuals
at the peak of the epidemic incidence with respect to the corresponding case
with no mobility restrictions (β = 1).

Figure S8: Robustness of the effect of targeted lockdown strategies for different choices of the age threshold between the two classes. In (a), the population below 60 years old constitutes the high activity class, while people
above 60 years old form the low activity class; in (b), such a threshold is set
at 70 years old. We consider the total number of deaths over a time-window
of 104 days from the beginning of the simulation (4th February) to the time
corresponding to the relaxation of the most severe NPIs in Italy (18th May).
On the two axes, α1 and α2 correspond to activity reduction of high and low
activity classes, respectively, where higher levels of α1 or α2 denote less severe
NPIs. Level curves are presented to clarify how targeted interventions should
be combined to produce the same effect on the total number of deaths. The
black dot represents the identified activity reduction in model calibration.
The results of these two analyses confirm observations in Fig. 7 of the main
document, where the threshold was set at 65 years old.
