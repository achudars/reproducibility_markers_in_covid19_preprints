Abstract
Epidemic spreading can be suppressed by the introduction of containment measures such as social distancing and lock downs. Yet, when such
measures are relaxed, new epidemic waves and infection cycles may occur. Here we explore this issue in compartmentalized epidemic models on
graphs in presence of a feedback between the infection state of the population and the structure of its social network for the case of discontinuous
control. We show that in random graphs the effect of containment measures is simply captured by a renormalization of the effective infection
rate that accounts for the change in the branching ratio of the network.
In our simple setting, a piece-wise mean-field approximations can be used
to derive analytical formulae for the number of epidemic waves and their
length. A variant of the model with imperfect information is used to model
data of the recent covid-19 epidemics in the Basque Country and Lombardy, where we estimate the extent of social network disruption during
lock downs and characterize the dynamical attractors.

Introduction
The onset of oscillations in a system as a consequence of feedback has
been highlighted since the inception of control theory [1, 2]. Traditionally, feedback-induced oscillations have been studied in engineering artificial tools like thermostats and steering devices [3]. More recently, research

1

focused also on its application to natural systems [4], in particular homeostasis and its disruption in biological systems, a classical example being
glycemic control and diabetes in human metabolism [5].
Feedback-induced oscillations are currently emerging as governments
are trying to control the evolution of the covid-19 pandemic crisis with
containment measures such as social distancing, lock downs and quarantine.
The modeling of containement measures in compartmentalized epidemic models [6] is thus under the focus of intense research [7, 8]. It
has been very recently rigorously demonstrated that compartimentalized
epidemic models display oscillations in presence of feedback between infection rate and infection states [9],and that in general a feedback between
order and control parameters in large interacting systems subject to phase
transitions triggers self oscillations [10, 11], where an Andronov-Hopf bifurcation takes over the usual phase transition.
As infection and recovery rates are changed, epidemic models on networks display out-of-equilibrium phase transitions between a phase where
a disease is prevented from spreading and a phase where a macroscopic
finite fraction of the population becomes infected [12].
In this article, we will study the SIS and SIR models in a full microscopic settings on random networks in presence of a feedback that changes
the structure of the underlying social network, and we will show that such
feedback triggers self-oscillations along the theory proposed in [10], where
suitably defined connectivity properties play the role of the control parameter. In order to mimic the occurrence of lock downs, we will focus
on a a simple discontinuous feedback control, where a certain fraction of
links is deleted if the fraction of infections exceeds a given threshold ùêº2 .
The same links are then be reinstated once the fraction of infections has
been reduced below a second threshold value ùêº1 < ùêº2 .
Oscillations in epidemic spreading have been studied mainly from the
point of view of seasonal effects that act as an external driving forces, while
in the case studied here oscillations are autonomously driven by an internal
feedback. The resulting models are described by time-independent equations and parameters, and such oscillations can be considered as emerging
self-oscillations [13, 14, 15].
The article is organized as follows: In the first section we define the
model and illustrate its behavior with results from numerical simulations
on an instance of a real social network. In the second section we then
study the model on mean-field uncorrelated networks, where we will show
that the overall effect of lock downs on the dynamics is captured by a
renormalization of the effective infection rate through a change of the
network branching ratio.
This finding is then exploited in the third section, where we analyze simple piece-wise well-mixed models with point transformation techniques, leading to analytical formulae for the number of waves and their
length. In the last section, we consider the realistic case of imperfect information on the infection state, and we infer parameters from data on
the current evolution of the covid-19 pandemic, for which we estimate
the extent of social network disruption and characterize its limit cycle
attractors.

Results
Model definition
We consider compartmentalized epidemic models on random networks,
specifically the SIS and SIR models (see [16] for a review), where individual agents are represented as the nodes of a social network and can be in
different states: Infected, Susceptible and Recovered. Infected individuals recover with a Poissonian rate ùõæ, which is a parameter of the model,
becoming either susceptible (in the SIS model) or recovered (in the SIR
model), and they infect neighboring susceptible nodes with a Poissonian
rate ùõΩ, which is the second parameter of the model. In order to model
containment measures and their relaxation, we consider a feedback between the network structure and the infected state and its history in the
following terms:
‚Ä¢ Starting from a state with few infections (whose relative number we
will indicate with ùêº) that fastly spread, if the spreading overcomes
a certain threshold ùêº > ùêº2 a central authority decides to disrupt the
network structure by randomly removing a macroscopic fraction ùëû
of the links. This will eventually revert back the spreading.
‚Ä¢ Starting from a regressing infected state in a disrupted network,
when the infection state is reverted to an acceptably low value ùêº <
ùêº1 , the network structure is restored back to its initial conditions.

friendship network reconstructed in [17] (number of nodes ùëÅ = 134).
In Fig. 2, we show instead a simulation of the SIR model on the same
network with and without feedback control, thus illustrating the effect
of enforcing containment measures. The control successfully reduces the
spreading of the infection, but for this to occur a series of lock downs have
to be put in place.

Figure 2: Fraction of infected and subsequently recovered individuals as a function of time
(that can be measured in days) from epidemic simulations of the SIR model in a school
friendship network [17] (number of nodes ùëÅ = 134) with (left) and without (right) lock down
measures in place, with parameters ùõΩ = 0.05 (bare infection rate), ùõæ = 0.07 (recovery rate).
The lock down for the feedback case is enforced if the number of infections is above 13 and
it is relaxed if they are below 2, and it consists in a dilution of the network links by a factor
ùëû = 0.99. There are three lock downs occurring at times ùë° = 25, ùë° = 80 and ùë° = 130.

We will consider in the next section the SIS and SIR models for the case
of large uncorrelated random networks, where it is possible to characterize
analytically general features of the dynamics.

Networks
We consider here the case of large annealed uncorrelated random graphs
with degree distribution ùëÉ (ùëò). At odds with static networks, in annealed
networks we assume that links are randomly rewired over a faster time
scale of the spreading process, while the assumption of uncorrelated networks implies there are no correlations between the degrees of neighboring
nodes. The locally treee-like structure of these networks makes it possible
to make analytical progress in the study of dynamical processes taking
place on them, since it allows to recur to well-controlled approximations
for the factorization of probability states. In particular, we will consider here the heterogeneous mean-field approximation, where nodes are
grouped in classes according to their degree.
Let us start from the SIS model. In absence of feedback, the rate
equation for the fraction ùêºùëò of infected individuals of degree ùëò can be
written as follows [18]
ùêºÀôùëò (ùë°) = ùõΩ (1 ‚àí ùêºùëò (ùë°)) ùëòŒò(ùë°) ‚àí ùõæùêºùëò (ùë°),

‚àëÔ∏Ä
(ùëò)
ùêºùëò (ùë°) is the probability that a randomly selected

neighbor of a node of degree ùëò is infected, and we denote by ‚ü®ùëò‚ü© the average
degree of the network.
Here we consider
‚àëÔ∏Ä the case in which, when the fraction of infected individuals ùêº(ùë°) = ùëò ùëÉ (ùëò)ùêºùëò (ùë°) exceeds a given threshold ùêº2 , a lock down
measure is implemented that removes a fraction ùëû of links, which are then
reinstated once the condition ùêº(ùë°) < ùêº1 is satisfied. The equations of the
model in presence of this feedback mechanism can therefore be written in
terms of a state-dependent infection rate as follows

We note that we can express ùõΩÀú as a function of the fraction of infected
population and its derivative because we are considering deterministic rate
equations. A more general representation for the discrete stochastic case
would require the introduction of a binary state variable to denote the
occurrence or absence of a lock down.
In Figure 3, we compare the result of numerical simulations with the
numerical solution of equation (2) for Erd≈ës-R√©nyi and scale-free random
networks. In both cases we clearly see the emergence of oscillations due
to the feedback.

The same feedback mechanism can be considered for the SIR model as
well. If we now define ùëÖùëò as the fraction of recovered nodes with degree

In figure 5 we show the evolution over time of the fraction of infected
and recovered individuals for the case of Erd≈ës-R√©nyi and scale-free networks. We see that the introduction of the feedback can lead to oscillations
corresponding to multiple infection waves. Clearly, in contrast to the case
of the SIS model, these oscillations will eventually come to an end once
a large enough fraction of the population has been infected. The number
of infection waves depends on the parameters of the model. In the next
section we provide an analytical estimation for a well-mixed population
in the limit when ùëû is close to 1.

Mixed approximation
The analysis reported in the previous section, where the effect of network embedding and the feedback enacting on it is captured by a simple
renormalization of the bare infection rate, suggests to study the model on
well-mixed populations to get analytical insights. In this section ùêº, ùëÜ and
ùëÖ will indicate the fraction of infected, susceptible and recovered individuals in the total population, respectively. The feedback law mimicking

Imperfect information and data modeling
In this section, we illustrate our framework in the context of modeling
epidemic data of the covid-19 infection in 2020 in the Italian region of
Lombardy and the Spanish region of the Basque Country. Data includes
daily reports of new infections and active cases 2 , plus a single prevalence
estimate. For the purpose of data analysis, we consider a variant of the
model with imperfect information by splitting the total number of infections into detected and undetected cases, whose numbers we denote by ùêºùëë
2 From https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19 (Lombardy) and
https://opendata.euskadi.eus/catalogo-datos (Basque country)

and ùêºùë¢ respectively. We assume the existence of a detection process by
which undetected infected individuals are spotted with rate ùëü and then
put in isolation (which is equivalent to removing them). The mean-field
rate equations are as follows

depending on whether we consider the SIS and/or the SIR model.
The inference of the model parameters has been performed by approximately solving Bayes equations under the hypothesis of Gaussian noise
by means of Monte Carlo methods and dynamical system numerical simulations (see the appendix).

In Fig. 6 we show the time series of new daily cases for the two
analyzed cases against the model with maximum likelihood parameters,
the latter showing a clear cusp peak and piece-wise exponential trends
corresponding to the lock down event. The model suggests that a closed
trajectory must be observed in the plane of new and active daily cases.
This is shown in Fig. 7, where we report data smoothened by a 7-days
moving average as well. This closed trajectory in the ideal case of a pure
SIS model with feedback would be a limit cycle attractor of the dynamics.

Conclusions
Connectivity plays a crucial role in the definition of the parameters that
control the collective behavior of a system. This finding has striking consequences, like the absence of an epidemic threshold in epidemic spreading
models defined on scale-free networks [19], and it suggests that it is possible to control the spreading by acting on the network of social interactions.
In this article we have shown that feedback control at the level of
the social network in epidemic models triggers self-oscillations along the
theory proposed in [10].
We have investigated self-oscillations induced by a simple discontinuous feedback control mimicking lock down events in classical compartmentalized epidemic models (SIS and SIR) on networks.
On random graphs, for Erd≈ës-R√©nyi as well as scale-free networks with
naive populations, we have shown that the effect of lock downs simply
amounts at renormalizing the effective infection rate to account for the
reduction in the network branching ratio.
This led to simple piece-wise mean field approximations that we solved
analytically by means of transformation point methods, recovering formulae for the number of waves and their extent in terms of the model parameters. These formulae can be in principle tested against data, once a
certain amount of evidence accumulates on the number of lock downs and
their lengths, prevalence estimates, and basic infection numbers region by
region.
A problem related to data collection during the covid-19 epidemic
outbreak was the fact that many positives were undetected. In order
to bring the model to data, we have therefore extended it by assuming
the existence of a fraction of undetected positives, who can then be detected at a given rate (for instance through testing). We have applied
our extended framework to analyze data from the first epidemic wave of
covid-19 in Lombardy and Basque country, where parameters have been
inferred leading to a characterization of the dynamical attractors in the
phase space. Apart from applications to predictive modeling ‚Äì which
would require more extensive data analysis [20] and methods of system
identification- - we do point out here briefly some potentially interesting
theoretical problems stemming from this work.
First, the issue of optimal scheduling [21] in the control of the social
network, leading to continuous feedback and potentially smoother oscillations. Current qualitative evidence from the second epidemic wave of
covid-19 seems indeed to show in some regions smoother trends and os-

10

cillations around the phase transition point (ùëÖùë° ‚àº 1), due to attempts
of finer control like partial restrictions and selected closures taken in due
course. Recently proposed analytical frameworks [7] can be very useful in
this respect.
Second, within the framework proposed here, where epidemics can be
regarded as self-oscillators, it comes naturally the question of coupling and
synchronization [22, 23] of epidemic waves running on different networks
that are weakly connected, e.g. by migration processes.
Finally, another interesting issue concerns the impact of periodically
external drive on oscillators: analogously to well-known forced double well
oscillator [24], the combined effect of seasonal changes and feedback could
potentially lead to chaotic oscillations in strange attractors, an aspect that
adds to the problem of predictability of such systems, and that we leave
for future investigations.

A Number of epidemic waves: perturbative expansion
In this section we derive formula (14-16). In the SIR model at fixed
infection rate ùõΩ (as in a simple model without feedback, or in a given
interval for the piece-wise feedback model) the peak value of the infected
fraction is (when ùêºÀôùëù = 0 and ùëÜùëù = ùõæ/ùõΩ)
ùêºùëù = ùêºùëñ + ùëÜùëñ ‚àí

ùõæ
log ùëÜùëñ ‚àí ùõæ/ùõΩ(1 ‚àí log(ùõæ/ùõΩ)).
ùõΩ

(19)

This value is not achieved if it is greater than the one triggering the lock
down, i.e. when ùêºùëù > ùêº2. Thus we will assume as halting condition that
ùêºùëù ‚â§ ùêº2 , since in this case no lock down takes place and the system proceeds towards herd immunity. We will now work out a series for fraction
of susceptible individuals at the various stages of the epidemic waves,
exploiting the piece-wise analytical solutions in each interval.
Suppose we are at the beginning of a wave ùêº = ùêº1 with given susceptible
fraction ùëÜ = ùëÜùëõ,‚àí , the system (with ùõΩ = ùõΩ1 ) will evolve towards ùêº2 and a
given ùëÜùëõ,+ that satisfies
ùëÜùëõ,+ ‚àí

ùõΩ1
ùõΩ1

(20)

where Œîùêº = ùêº2 ‚àí ùêº1 . Then we have the lock down ùõΩ = ùõΩ0 , and the system
will evolve towards ùêº1 with a given ùëÜùëõ+1,‚àí that satisfies
ùëÜùëõ+1,‚àí ‚àí

These equations define a series eventually halting when ùêºùëù ‚â§ ùêº2 .

B Inference of model parameters from epidemic data
Here we consider the task of fitting against epidemic data a model including imperfect information on the state of the system. This is an instance
of a system identification problem [25], which we solved along the following lines: We consider the time series of observed new daily and active
cases (ùëÅùë°ùëú , ùê¥ùëúùë° ) (ùë° = 1 . . . ùëá is the temporal index in days, starting from
the 1st of March, ùëá = ùëáùëô = 155 for Lombardy, and ùëá = ùëáùëè = 100 for
the Basque country), and we assume it as coming from an instance of the
model plus a noise term
ùëÅùë°ùëú = ùëüùêºùë¢ (ùë°, ‚Ñò) + ùõøùëÅ

(34)

ùê¥ùëúùë° = ùêºùëë (ùë°, ‚Ñò) + ùõøùê¥

(35)

‚Ñò = {ùõæ, ùõΩ1 , ùõΩ0 , ùëüùêº1 , ùêº2 , ùêºùë¢ (0), ùêºùëë (0)} ,

(36)

where we highlighted the dependence of the model trajectory by the dynamical parameters and boundary values.
We assume shot-noise of the form
‚ü®ùõøùëÅ ‚ü© = ‚ü®ùõøùê¥ ‚ü© = 0

‚ü®ùõøùëÅ
‚ü©=ùëÅ

‚ü®ùõøùê¥
‚ü© = ùê¥,

which for large numbers we assume to be distributed normally. Upon
assuming an uniform prior, we have the following formula for the loglikelihood of the parameters
‚àëÔ∏Å (ùëÅùë°ùëú ‚àí ùëüùêºùë¢ (ùë°, ‚Ñò))2
(ùê¥ùëúùë° ‚àí ùêºùëë (ùë°, ‚Ñò))2

From the Bayes formula, the posterior probability distribution of parameters ùëÉ (‚Ñò) ‚àù ùëí‚àí‚Ñí(‚Ñò) has been sampled by a Metropolis Montecarlo rule,
where the evaluation of ‚Ñí(‚Ñò) has been done by numerical integration of
the model equations. More explicitly we have been following the following
flowchart:
‚Ä¢ Start from some value of the parameters ‚Ñò0 : a warm start has been
provided by fitting the curve of new daily cases alone in linear approximation (ùëÜ << ùëÅ ).
‚Ä¢ Propose a change for the parameters ‚Ñòùëõ ‚Üí ‚Ñòùëõ+1 : we used independent geometrical random walks of stepsize 10‚àí3 .
‚Ä¢ Numerically integrate the model equations with the new proposed
parameters to evaluate their log-likelihood ‚Ñí(‚Ñòùëõ+1 ). We used the
standard Verlet algorithm.
‚Ä¢ Accept the proposed new parameters with probability
min(1, exp ‚Ñí(‚Ñòùëõ+1 ) ‚àí ‚Ñí(‚Ñòùëõ )) (Metropolis rule), otherwise keep the
old parameters.
This defines a series that asymptotically uniformly samples the posterior
probability for the parameters, whose peak values have been used for the
results showed in Fig. 6 and 7. Finally, we do point out that when we
numerically integrate the model equations we rejected solutions that i)
do not include at least one lock down event and ii) do not agree with
prevalence estimate from serological data. The latter gives a lower bound
for the total number ùêæ of infected individuals at a certain time, ùêæ ‚â• ùêæùëú
that can be reformulated as an inequality between the model parameters
(in particular ùëü, ùõΩ1 and ùõΩ0 ) as follows: ùêæ can decomposed
in detected
‚àëÔ∏Ä
and undetected cases ùêæ = ùêæùëë + ùêæùë¢ , where ùêæùëë =
Œîùêºùëë+ is given by the
data, while for the latter we have

In the first and second lines we have used the model hypothesis, in the
third we have decomposed the sum in terms of the increasing and decreasing part of the wave, and finally in the last line ùë• is the fraction of the
detected infections during the decreasing part of the epidemic wave. We
have finally the inequality
ùëü(ùêæùëú /ùêæùëë ‚àí 1) ‚â§ ùõΩ1 (1 ‚àí ùë•) + ùõΩ0 ùë•

(44)

Given the simplicity of the model employed ‚Äì in particular with respect
to the hypothesis of a constant detection rate ùëü ‚Äì we obtain a fairly high
value of the ùúí2 ‚àº 20, with a concomitant acceptably low average relative
error of ùúñ ‚àº 20% across data points that can be considered apt for a

14

qualitative description of the data. We report in the following table the
maximum likelihood inferred parameters with their standard deviation.

We do point out an anomalously high ùëÖ0 for Lombardy, due to a very
low average recovery rate of approximately 1 month (while the one from
Basque country is around two weeks in agreement with WHO estimates).
This is apparent upon looking at the much slower decay of the infection
curves during the lock down, and it is probably due to a biased oversampling of critically ill cases whose average recovery is typically longer.
