A BSTRACT
In this article, we investigate the historical series of the total number of deaths per month in Brazil
since 2015 using time series analysis techniques, in order to assess whether the COVID-19 pandemic
caused any change in the series’ generating mechanism. The results obtained so far indicate that there
was no statistical significant impact.

Introduction

Brazil is a country of continental dimensions, with a territorial extension of 8,510,295.914 Km2 , and an estimated
population of 211,959,316 people, which is distributed in a federation constituted by 26 States and the Federal District
(the country has 5, 570 cities) [1]. Until the time of this writing, the Brazilian Federal Ministry of Health has recorded
3,622,861 Sars-CoV-2 case reports and 115,309 deaths [2] caused by the COVID-19 pandemic [3].
According to the Coronavirus Resource Center of the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) [4], Brazil is the second country
most affected by COVID-19 in the world, both in number of cases and in number of deaths.
This article aims to investigate the historical series of the total number of deaths using time series analysis techniques.
From now on, such series will be called historical series. More specifically, we want to assess the impact of COVID-19
on the evolution of the historical series.
The analysis was performed using the R software, version 4.0.2 [5]. The developed R code, as well as the database in
Excel spreadsheet format, are available for public consultation and auditing on GitHub [6].
The database used is that made available online by the Transparency Portal of the Civil Registry Offices of Brazil
[7], which consolidates the amount of birth, marriage and death certificates available in Brazil. Online data has been
available since January 2015. Brazilian registries are regulated by the National Council of Justice (CNJ), which is a
public institution headquartered in Brasília, Federal District, that aims to improve the work of the Brazilian judicial
system, especially with regard to administrative and procedural control and transparency [8]. The president of the
Brazilian Supreme Court also presides the CNJ.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. We review basic concepts of time series analysis in Section 2.
Section 3 presents the technique used for modeling the historical series. This section also includes an exploratory
data analysis and a spectral analysis. Section 4 summarizes the conclusions and highlights some topics for further
investigation.

Background

2.1

Time Series Basic Concepts

In broad terms, a time series consists in a set of numbers corresponding to the observation of a certain phenomenon.
Figure 1 shows the Nile River mimima for the years 622 AD to 1284 AD1 [9]. By nature, such numbers are realizations
of random variables. In general, a collection of random variables, {xt }, indexed by t, is referred to as a stochastic
process [10]. In this paper, t will be discrete and vary over the integers t = 0, ±1, ±2, . . ..

Figure 1: Nile River mimima series.
Box and Jenkis [11] introduced the class of stationary ARMA(p, q) (autoregressive moving average) models2

xt − µ =

φj (xt−j − µ) + wt −

j=1

θi wt−j ,

i=1

where µ = E{xt } is the mean of xt , {φ1 , φ2 , . . . , φp } and {θ1 , θ2 , . . . , θq } are parameters of the model, and wt is a
wide-sense stationary white noise process with zero mean and power σ 2 , i. e., wt ∼ (0, σ 2 ). In a more compact form,
we have
φ(B)x0t = θ(B)wt ,

(2)

where x0t = xt − µ, B is the backward shift operator (Bxt = xt−1 ), φ(B) is the autoregressive (AR) operator of order p
φ(B) = 1 − φ1 B − φ2 B 2 − . . . − φp B p

(3)

and θ(B) denotes the moving average (MA) operator of order q
θ(B) = 1 − θ1 B − θ2 B 2 − . . . − θq B q .

(4)

In the rest of this paper, we will assume µ = 0 without loss of generality.
The process xt can be viewed as the output of a digital filter (ARMA filter) whose input is wt , with system function
H(z) =

In this work, we use the simplified notation xt to denote a discrete-time stochastic process {xt }.

where H(z) denotes the z-transform of the impulse response ht of the ARMA filter. An ARMA(p, q) process xt is said
to be wide-sense stationary (or non-explosive) if the poles of H(z) in (5) lie inside the complex unit circle (|z| = 1),
and it is invertible if the zeros of H(z) in (5) lie inside the unit circle. The autocorrelation function (ACF) 3 ρh of
an ARMA(p, q) process shows exponentially decay to zero, i. e., at lag h converges rapidly to zero as h → ∞ (short
memory property) [11].
A random process xt is wide sense (or weakly) stationary if its mean is constant [12, p. 298]
E[xt ] = µx ,

ρx (t1 , t2 ) = ρx (t1 , t1 + τ ) = ρx (τ ).

(7)

and if its ACF depends only on the lag τ = t2 − t1 :

In the literature, it is common to use the terms time series and stochastic process interchangeably [10], [13], [14], [15].
From now on, we will only use the term time series. The context will indicate to the reader whether it is a process or a
realization of a process.
2.2

Time Series Modeling

The modeling of a time series xt consists on estimating an invertible function h(.), called model of xt , such that
xt = h(. . . , wt−2 , wt−1 , wt , wt+1 , wt+2 , . . .),

(8)

in which wt ∼ Independent and Identically Distributed – IID and
g(. . . , xt−2 , xt−1 , xt , xt+1 , xt+2 , . . .) = wt ,

(9)

in which g(.) = h−1 (.). The process wt is the innovation at instant t and represents the new information about the
series that is obtained at instant t.
In practice, the adjusted model is causal, i. e.,
xt = h(wt , wt−1 , wt−2 , . . .).

(10)

The model construction methodology is based on the iterative cycle illustrated by Fig. 2 [11]:
(a) a general class of models is considered for the analysis (specification);
(b) there is the identification of a model, based on statistical criteria;
(c) it follows the estimation phase, in which the model’s parameters are obtained. In practice, it is important that the
model is parsimonious4 ; and
(d) at last, there is the diagnostic of the adjusted model by means of a statistical analysis of the residual series wt (is wt
compatible with a white noise process?)
The process xt of (10) is linear when it corresponds to the convolution of a process wt ∼ IID and a deterministic
sequence ht [16][p. 377]

xt = ht ? wt =

hk wt−k

k=0

= wt + h1 wt−1 + h2 wt−2 + . . .

(11)

= (1 + h1 B + h2 B 2 + . . .)wt
= H(B)wt
We assume that the autocorrelation function is given by ρh = γγh0 , where γh corresponds to the autocovariance of xt at lag h.
We say that a model is parsimonious when it uses few parameters. The use of an excessive number of parameters is undesirable
because the uncertainty degree of the statistical inference procedure increases with the number of parameters.

in which the symbol ? denotes the convolution operation and h0 = 1.
Eq. (11) is also known as the infinite order moving average (MA(∞)) representation [17].
As the models in practice are invertible, the model of xt can be rewritten in an infinite order autoregressive (AR(∞))
form:

2.3

Identifying AR Models

In practice, the order p of an AR series is unknown and must be empirically specified. In this paper, we use an
information criterion function [14] as will be explained below.
The basic idea of an ARMA model selection criterion is to choose the orders k and l that minimize the quantity

in which σ̂k,l
is a residual variance estimate obtained by adjusting an ARMA(k, l) model to the N series observations,
and C(N ) is a function of the series size.
)
2
The quantity (k + l) C(N
is called penalty term and it increases when the number of parameters increases, while σ̂k,l
N
decreases.

Akaike proposed the information criterium [18], [19]

AIC(k, l) = ln σ̂k,l

known as AIC, in which σ̂k,l
is the maximum likelihood estimator of σw2 for an ARMA(k, l) model.

Upper bounds K and L for k and l must be specified. Eq. (15) has to be evaluated for all possible (k, l) combinations
with 0 ≤ k ≤ K 0 ≤ l ≤ L. In general, K and L are functions of N , for example, K = L = ln N .
For the case of AR(p) models, (15) reduces to
AIC(k) = ln σ̂k2 +

(16)

Estimation of AR Models

Having identified the AR model’s order p, we can go to the parameters estimation phase. The methods of moments,
Least Squares and Maximum Likelihood may be used [20], [21]. As, in general, the moments estimators are not good
[21], statistical packages as R and S-PLUS use some Least Squares or Maximum Likelihood estimator.
2.5

ARIMA model

If a process which corresponds to the difference of order d = 1, 2, . . . of xt
yt = (1 − B)d xt = ∆d xt

(17)

is stationary, then yt can be represented by an ARMA(p, q) model
φ(B)yt = θ(B)wt .

(18)

φ(B)∆d xt = θ(B)wt

(19)

In this case,

is an ARIMA(p, d, q) model and we say that xt is an “integral” of yt [21] because
xt = S d yt .

(20)

The ARIMA(p, d, q) model
H(z) =

θ(z)
φ(z)(1 − z −1 )d

(21)

is marginally stable [22], as it has d roots on the unit circle. Also, xt of (19) is a homogeneous non-stationary process
(meaning non-explosive) or having unit roots [13], [14], [21].
Observe that [21][p.139]:
(a) d = 1 corresponds to homogeneous non-stationary series with respect to the level (they oscillate around a mean
level during a certain time and then jump to another temporary level);
(b) d = 2 corresponds to homogeneous non-stationary series with respect to the trend (they oscillate along a direction
for a certain time and then change to another temporary direction).
The ARIMA model (19) may be represented in three ways:
(a) ARMA(p + d, q) (similar to Eq. (1))
x(t) =

p+d

ϕk x(t − k) + w(t) −

Random walk

Consider the model yt ∼ I(1)
yt = yt−1 + xt ,

(23)

in which xt is a stationary process. If we assume the initial condition y0 , (23) can be rewritten as an integrated sum

yt = y0 +

t

xj .

(24)

j=1

The integrated sum

Pt

j=1

xj is called stochastic trend and it is denoted by T St . Observe that
T St = T St−1 + xt ,

(25)

in which T S0 = 0.
If xt ∼ N (0, σx2 ) in (23), then yt is known as random walk.
Including a constant in the right side of (23), we have a random walk with drift,
yt = θ0 + yt−1 + xt .

(26)

Given the initial condition y0 , we can write

yt = y0 + θ0 t +

Observe that ρk (t) ≈ 1 when t >> k and the literature states that the random walk has “strong memory” [14].
The random walk’s Sample Autocorrelation Function (SACF) decays linearly for large lags.
2.7

Spectral Analysis of Random Signals

Spectral analysis is a well-established research area [20]. However, the estimation of the power spectrum of a signal is
not a trivial matter. There are two classes of spectral analysis techniques currently in use: parametric (or model-based)
and nonparametric analysis. Both methods are used in this work.
The fundamental idea of parametric spectral analysis is fairly simple. The parametric approach assumes that the
signal satisfies a generating model, such as an AR(p), with known functional form and then proceed by estimating the
parameters in the assumed model [20], [23]. The most widely used form of parametric Power Spectral Density (PSD)
estimation uses an AR(p) model [20].
Let us now consider the nonparametric (or classical) method. Then, the estimation of PSD of a time series xt can be
made using periodogram methods based on the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), which can be efficiently calculated
by a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) Algorithm.
6

In the sequence we present the periodogram method.
Consider a time series xt with N values or samples, i. e., xt = 0 outside the time interval 0 ≤ t ≤ N − 1. In some
cases of interest, we consider that xt has a size N , even if its actual size is M ≤ N (in such cases the series xt must be
completed with (N − M ) zeros (zero padding).
The equation (32) is the DFT of xt :

−1
 NP
k
xt e−j2π N t , 0 ≤ k ≤ N − 1
X[k] =
 t=0
0,
otherwise

(32)

The PSD of xt can be estimated by calculating the periodogram, given by
Px (fk ) =

|X[k]|2
N

(33)

where X[k] denotes the DFT of xt , and

fk = 0,

The periodogram is an asymptotically unbiased spectral estimator of the PSD of a random signal [20], [23]. Its main
problem lies in its large variance. In other words, the periodogram is inconsistent (i. e., the dispersion of the estimates
is independent of N ). This motivates the use of a “refined periodogram method”, like the Daniell method.
It is possible to show that the periodogram values Px (fk ) are asymptotically uncorrelated random variables [20]. Thus
we may reduce its large variance by weight averaging the periodogram over small intervals centered on the current
frequency fk . The practical form of the Daniell estimate can be performed using the FFT. This work uses a Daniell
kernel for nonparametric PSD estimation. For further details, please refer to [20] and [23].

Figure 3: Historical series in Brazil from January 2015 to July 2020.
The series in the Fig. 3 strongly suggests that we can specify a model of the type [10][p. 58]
xt = µt + yt
7

(34)

An exploratory time series analysis of total deaths per month in Brazil since 2015

where xt are the observations, yt is a stationary process, and µt denotes a linear trend given by the regression model
µt = β0 + β1 t

(35)

in which β0 and β1 are the intercept and the slope parameters.
Table 1 shows the estimated coeffcientes for (35) and its p-values, which are negligible. The goodness of fit is
summarized by the R2 of the regression [13][p. 169]. Note that the R2 statistics given by Table 2 indicate that the
proposed model for µt explain approximately 75.8% of the total variability of the data. The great value of the F-statistic
and the neglibible model p-value show that we can not reject the null hypothesis of linear regression. Thus, we can
consider a linear model for (35) to be statistically significant given the statistical significance level of 0.01. Figure 4
shows the time series with the superimposed linear regression model.

Figure 4: Time series with the superimposed linear regression model.
To verify that the model (35) is appropriate, it is also necessary to investigate the residuals. This is what is called
residual analysis.
The residuals of (35 ) correspond to the discrepancies between the observed values (µ) and the values adjusted (µ̂) by
the model. The i-th residual is given by
êi = µi − µ̂i .

(36)

Figure 5 shows the residuals vs fitted model and the Quantile-Quantile plot (QQ-plot) of the residuals, which suggests
that they are normally distributed.
Table 3 shows a residual diagnostics using the Jarque-Bera and Shapiro-Wilks tests [13][p.61] for the null hypothesis of
normality of the residuals. The null of normality is not rejected using either tests.
At this point, we can conclude that:

• there is no statistical evidence that COVID-19 affected the deterministic linear trend of the historical series, i.
e., on average, the monthly growth in the number of deaths, which is approximately 675 deaths/month, did not
change since the first recorded death in Brazil on March 16, 2020; and
• there is no change point in the deterministic linear trend of the historical series.
3.2

Exploratory Data Analysys

The first step in exploratory analysis is to remove the deterministic trend of Eq.(35) [10][p. 58]. There are two
alternatives: remove the line estimated by the regression or take the first difference in the series. As our goal is to coerce
the data to (a possible) stationarity, then differencing may be more appropriate [10][p. 61]. The first two samples of the
historical series were discarded so that the series corresponding to the first difference has 64 points, that is, 26 points,
which facilitates the spectral analysis with FFT.
The first difference can be denote as
∆xt = xt − xt−1 = rt .

(37)

Figure 6 shows the series rt (we also demeaned the series) and its SACF.
Figure 7 shows the histogram of rt with a superimposed normal distribution and its Q-Q plot, which suggests that rt
follows a normal distribution.
Figure 8 shows the smoothed periodogram using the Daniell method and the PSD for the estimated model of rt , which
is an AR(11).
We used the Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) test [24] for the null hypothesis that rt is level stationary, i. e.,
that the series is I(0). We obtained a p-value of 0.1, which means that one can not reject that rt is level stationary.
Finally, but not least, an informal analysis of Fig. 6 suggests that the variance of rt has a change point around t = 22
(2017/jan). However, if this really happened, which we cannot guarantee with the techniques employed in this article,
ocurred long before the outbreak of COVID-19 in Brazil. This possible change point motivates a time-frequency domain
analysis using wavelets, as the localized nature of wavelet coefficients allows one to analyze the evolution of the series
variance over time [20]. This will be investigated in future work.

Conclusions and Future Work

month in Brazil since 2015. Our preliminary results indicate that:

• there is no statistical evidence that COVID-19 affected the deterministic linear trend of the historical series, i.
e., on average, the monthly growth in the number of deaths, which is approximately 675 deaths/month, did not
change since the first recorded death in Brazil on March 16, 2020;
• there is no change point in the deterministic linear trend of the historical series;
• there is significant statistical evidence that the first difference time series is stationary; and
• there is no statistical evidence that COVID-19 provoked a change in the stochastic process that generates the
time series under analysis5 .
These results are thought provoking and not intuitive. COVID-19 has caused many deaths around the world. This is
an indisputable fact. However, our results suggest that this disease does not have so far an additive effect on the total
number of deaths per month in Brazil. What would be a plausible explanation for this strange result?
In any case, further research should be carried out to confirm the results obtained.
In future work, we will analyze the historical series using wavelet methods.
