ABSTRACT
Contaminated objects or surfaces, referred to as fomites, play a critical role in the spread of
viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. The long
persistence of viruses (hours to days) on surfaces calls for an urgent need for surface disinfection
strategies to intercept virus transmission and the spread of the disease. Elucidating the
physicochemical processes and surface science underlying the adsorption and transfer of virus
between surfaces, as well as their inactivation, are important in understanding how the disease
is transmitted, and in developing effective interception strategies. This review aims to summarize
the current knowledge and underlying physicochemical processes of virus transmission, in
particular via fomites, and common disinfection approaches. Gaps in knowledge and needs for
further research are also identified. The review focuses on SARS-CoV-2, but will supplement the
discussions with related viruses.

1. Introduction
As of May 21, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has infected >5M and caused >328K deaths
worldwide,1 significantly more than MERS and SARS combined.2 In general, the primary routes
of respiratory virus transmission are: 1) direct contact between individuals, 2) indirect contact via
contaminated objects, also referred to as fomites, 3) airborne transmission via droplets and
aerosols.3
There is growing consensus that contaminated fomites play a critical role in the spread of
viruses,4 in a wide range of environments including hospitals, schools, offices, restaurants, and
nursing homes.4,5 Surface disinfection is one of the strategies to intercept fomite-based disease
transmission. For example, UV irradiation has been applied to disinfect vehicles for public
transportation.6 Mass spray chemical disinfection is also currently used in multiple countries,7–9
by using robots, unmanned aerial vehicles, and other semi-autonomous or autonomous spray
equipment. While these disinfection strategies can have multiple potential benefits, the
effectiveness of some methods, especially for the control of COVID-19, is unexamined.
Most reports on COVID-19 fomite transmission and interception measures are focused on
empirical results. Understanding the science underpinning the interactions between viruses and
surfaces, as well as their inactivation, is equally important for a better understanding of how the
disease is transmitted, how to intercept the transmission, and eventually how to devise guidelines
to prevent the spread of the disease.
The goals of this paper are to: 1) review the current knowledge and underlying
physicochemical processes of virus transmission, in particular via fomites, and common
disinfection strategies, and 2) identify gaps in knowledge and needs for further research. The
review focuses on SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, but will supplement the
discussions with related viruses, as much about SARS-CoV-2 is still unknown. We hope that the
review can provide value by stimulating research efforts to further our understanding of the
transmission of the disease, as well as by facilitating the development and implementation of
effective disinfection strategies.
The remainder of this review is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a short summary
of the structure of SARS-CoV-2 as relevant to its transmission via fomites and inactivation.
Section 3 summarizes the different routes of virus transmission, how viral load is quantified, and
efforts in modeling the infection risks via these routes. Section 4 focuses on virus transmission
via fomites, starting with a brief discussion of the physicochemical origin of virus adsorption to
and transfer between surfaces, followed by empirical findings of the transfer rate and persistence
of viruses on different surfaces. Section 5 reviews the inactivation mechanisms of viruses, and
current strategies to intercept fomite transmission. Section 6 examines methods of applying
chemical disinfectants and their effectiveness.

2. SARS-CoV-2 structure, envelope properties and surrogate viruses
Here we focus on the properties of SARS-CoV-2 that are directly relevant to their transmission
via fomites and disinfection strategies. The details of its structure, as well as other coronaviruses,
can be found in previous work.10–12
2.1 Basic Structure
SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus, which is a genus of enveloped viruses with a linear, positive
sense, single-stranded RNA genome that encodes for four main structural proteins: envelope (E),
membrane (M), spike (S), and nucleocapsid (N).10 SARS-CoV-2, similar to other enveloped
viruses, is composed of two structures: 1) a lipid bilayer envelope that surrounds 2) a
nucleocapsid, a protein capsid enclosing the genome strand.13
The E, M, and S proteins are embedded in the lipid bilayer envelope. This lipid bilayer is
derived from the host cell and is formed during the budding of a nucleocapsid through a cell
2

membrane.11 The lipid bilayer is susceptible to chemical disruption, for example, by surfactants.
Disruption of the lipid envelope could render the virus inactive.14 In addition to the lipid layer, the
M and E proteins could be targets for the inactivation or weakening of SARS-CoV-2 due to their
critical roles in viral envelope assembly and replication. While enveloped viruses are more
susceptible to inactivation than non-enveloped viruses, they possess the ability to adapt the
envelope molecular profile to evade immune systems.14,15
2.2 Physicochemical properties
While the exact size of SARS-CoV-2 has not been reported, the approximate diameter of the
closely related SARS-CoV-1 is 82-94 nm, with spikes that extend ~19 nm out (total diameter of
~120-132 nm).16 The isoelectric point (pI) of viruses is important in determining their adsorption
characteristics. Based on the protein composition, the pI of the M and N proteins of other
coronaviruses have been computed theoretically to be ~9.3-10.7.17–19 The pI of the M and N
proteins on SARS-CoV-2 are likely to be within the same range. Although the overall isoelectric
points of coronaviruses have not been reported, they are expected to be largely influenced by the
isoelectric properties of M and N proteins,19,20 and can be further approximated by accounting for
the dissociation constants of all amino acids of the virus.21
2.3 Surrogates
SARS-CoV-2 requires biosafety level (BSL) 3 facilities to handle.22 To facilitate the investigation
of its infectivity, transmission, and disinfection, it is useful to identify surrogates with similar
structures to SARS-CoV-2 but with reduced risk of human infection. The first class of surrogates
involves the use of natural viruses with low infectivity in humans. Table 1 shows these surrogate
viruses, host cells, and BSL levels reported thus far.

A second class of surrogates is pseudotyped viruses. They are derived from parent
viruses such as the murine leukemia virus (MLV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and
herpes simplex virus (HSV). The genome of the parents are modified for safer use in BSL 2 labs.23
The synthesis of pseudotyped viruses is highly adaptable and allows for the incorporation of
various kinds of envelope glycoproteins.24,25 For example, SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein has been
3

incorporated into a lentiviral pseudotyped virion system to determine the potential drug targets for
the virus.26
A third class of surrogates involves artificial capsids that emulate the viral architecture.
For example, peptide capsids have been constructed using capsid proteins to serve as nonpathogenic viral surrogates.27 They have been used to study aspects of viral infectivity, applied
as antimicrobial agents to disrupt bacterial lipid bilayer membranes, and programmed to carry
specific genetic cargo and deliver into the cytoplasm of human cells.
3. Virus transmission: routes, measurements, and modeling

Figure 1. A) Respiratory droplet (up to 500 μm) and aerosol (<5 μm) particles produced by an infected
host during coughing/sneezing, talking, or exhaling can infect fomites or another individual directly.
Droplets settle and adsorb onto fomites while aerosol particles can remain suspended in air for minutes to
hours.41,42 B) Indirect fomite-mediated transmission to a new human host occurs through contact with the
fomite and subsequent contact with regions through which a virus can enter the body. Contact times can
range from ~1-50 s.43

3.1 Transmission routes of viruses
Understanding the transmission routes of viruses is crucial to the development of effective control
measures. Three primary transmission routes have been found to contribute to the spread of
respiratory viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-1 and -2, measles, HCoV, rhinovirus, and influenza virus)
(Figure 1A): 1) direct contact between individuals, 2) indirect contact via contaminated objects
(fomites), 3) airborne transmission via droplets and aerosols.3
Direct contact involves the transmission of the virus through physical contact between an
infected host and a susceptible individual. Direct contact is a potent transmission route since the
viral load can be large, and the virus spends a shorter amount of time outside of a host compared
with other routes of transmission. For MERS, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2, direct contact is
considered a major transmission route.44,45
Indirect contact involves the transmission of the virus through a contaminated intermediate
object called a fomite. Fomites are inanimate objects or surfaces that can become contaminated
by the physical contact with either another infected fomite or skin, or by settling airborne particles.
Fomite transmission can occur when an individual touches a contaminated fomite, and then
touches their facial membranes (Figure 1B). Numerous studies have implicated fomites as a
significant virus transmission route in a range of environments.4,5 Although the transfer efficiency
of SARS-CoV-2 from fomites to other fomites or skin is not well characterized, the transfer
efficiency of a number of viruses has been investigated, and will be detailed in Section 4.

Respiratory viruses can also become airborne and spread via particles generated by
sneezing, coughing, talking, or exhaling. The particles generated can be classified into droplets
or aerosols based on a cut-off diameter of 5 μm.3 These airborne droplets and aerosols can cause
infection through inhalation into the respiratory tract,42 or by settling onto fomites.4 Due to their
large size, droplets typically fall within 1-2 m of the source within seconds (Figure 2).42,46–48
Aerosols are smaller and can remain suspended in the air for minutes to hours (Figure 2),
depending on the environmental conditions.41,42 Such prolonged suspension could increase the
distance the virus travels from the source, and the number of individuals and fomites exposed to
the virus.

Figure 2. Droplet settling time from a height of 3 m was approximated based on its terminal velocity.49 In
this approximation, settling time scales with the second power of droplet diameter and the air around the
droplet is assumed to be stagnant.

Detailed experimental and theoretical approaches have estimated that more violent
events such as sneezing can deposit droplets and aerosols up to 6 – 8 m away from the
source.47,48 Following the initial respiratory event, nearby air currents (e.g., from ventilation or
wind) can re-suspend aerosols and extend the range over which aerosols can travel.50 Although
the degree to which SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted by aerosol remains unclear, early evidence
from a study in Wuhan hospitals reported that the virus was detected in aerosol samples from
areas open to the general public, ~101 – 102 meters from the source.51 Airborne droplets and
aerosols can also deposit onto and contaminate fomites. A study on SARS-CoV-2 infected
patients in isolation rooms showed contamination of high-contact surfaces such as doorknobs
and bedrails, as well as air outlet fans which indicated virus transfer from aerosols to a surface.52
While the transmission routes discussed above are generally accepted as the main
transmission routes of respiratory viruses, sewage and dust-borne transmission have also been
implicated as possible routes. SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 have both been detected in
sewage, suggesting the possibility of transmission via the fecal-oral route, or via aerosolization of
sewage caused by flushing.53,54 Furthermore, dust-borne transmission has been proposed as a
possible mechanism in the spread of avian influenza in chickens.55
The relative importance of each transmission route in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and
most respiratory viruses remains an open question. A trend that is generally accepted, though, is
that the risk of infection increases for persons who are in close proximity to an infected individual
for extended periods of time. For example, the probability of transmission of SARS-CoV-2
between family members and close contacts44 and among passengers and workers on cruise
ships56 were much higher than that among the general population. Additionally, a ferret model
showed high transmission efficiencies of SARS-CoV-2 among ferrets living in close quarters,
while ferrets separated by a permeable partition were infected less efficiently.57

5

Because of the uncertainty or unavailability of quantitative data, it is difficult to draw
conclusions about how each transmission route contributes to the increased risk of infection in
close proximity. Furthermore, there is often a confounding effect between transmission routes.
For example, persons in sufficiently close proximity for droplet-based transmission are likely
exposed to a great intensity of virus-laden aerosols simultaneously.58 In a model of influenza
infection assessing the relative contributions of each transmission route to infection risk within a
household, fomite transmission was estimated as a major, if not the dominant, transmission
route.59 Although the relative importance of each transmission route remains poorly understood,
there has been a growing consensus that contaminated fomites play a critical role in the spread
of viruses.4
3.2 Measurement of virus infectivity
In order to determine the viability of a virus on surfaces and in aerosols, it is crucial that the
methods of collecting virus particles are effective in representing the virus titer from the
environmental sample accurately. Additionally, the methods used to analyze the collected
samples must have high specificity and sensitivity. In this section, we summarize the current
collection and analysis methods, as well as opportunities for improvement.
3.2.1 Aerosol sample collection
The most common methods of collecting aerosolized virus particles use a gelatin filter because it
is highly efficient in collecting virus particles without affecting viral infectivity.60 Gelatin filters can
also be dissolved easily for harvesting, culturing, and quantifying live virus particles. In a recent
study, the stability of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols was measured by generating an
aerosol and feeding the aerosol into a Goldberg 25 drum containing a gelatin filter. 61 Alternative
methods for collecting aerosolized viruses have been covered in a previous review.60 Briefly,
these methods use solid impactors (e.g., Andersen sampler, slit sampler, and cyclone sampler),
liquid impactors (e.g., all-glass impingers, swirling aerosol collector), filters (e.g., gelatin, cellulose,
polycarbonate, PTFE, or cotton), or electrostatic precipitators. The downside of these approaches
is the significant time delay (minutes to hours) between particle collection and virus quantification.
In an effort to develop real-time methods for virus aerosol collection and detection, microfluidicsbased assays have been developed. Briefly, these methods include microfluidic optical
immunosensing of latex agglutination,62,63 aerosol detection by impingement onto a microfluidic
droplet detector,64 and label-free virus capture using carbon nanotubes and detection by Raman
spectroscopy.65 However, these approaches are still in development and are not yet validated for
wide-spread use.
3.2.2 Surface sample collection
No study has evaluated the efficiency of virus collection from an exhaustive list of surfaces. In a
recent study examining commonly used collection methods, the most effective method for
recovering MS2 bacteriophages from nonporous fomites used polyester-tipped swabs pre-wetted
in either one-quarter-strength Ringer's solution or saline solution.66 This method recovered a
median fraction of 0.40 for infective MS2, and 0.07 for MS2 RNA from stainless steel and PVC
surfaces.
3.2.3 Quantification of infectious virus and RNA concentration
The two prevailing methods for detecting viral RNA and viable virus particles are reverse
transcriptase polymer chain reactions (RT-PCR) and plaque assays, respectively.
RT-PCR assays are used to determine both the presence of viral RNA and the number of
copies of viral RNA. While various forms of RT-PCR exist (e.g. rRT-PCR, qRT-PCR, and LAMPPCR), they all follow a general principle of amplifying specific viral RNA for detection and

6

quantification. RT-PCR assays are well characterized, straight-forward to perform, and do not
require cell culture. Their limitation is the inability to determine virus infectivity.67
Plaque assays involve culturing cells that are susceptible to virus infection in a titration of
the collected virus samples, monitoring the cytopathic effects, and counting plaque forming units
(PFU). Several recent preprint publications have used Vero E6 cells to quantify the presence of
infective SARS-CoV-1 and Sars-CoV-2.61,68–71 While plaque assays are the most popular method
for determining infectivity, they have several limitations, including: 1) the propensity to human
error, 2) the long duration of the assay (possibly exceeding a week) due to the time required for
observable cytopathic effects and/or PFUs, 3) the lack of a reliable host cell model for some
viruses, and 4) the absence of plaque formation in some viruses.67 To address some of these
limitations, alternative approaches have been developed. One alternative is the 50% tissue
culture infectious dose (TCID50), an endpoint dilution assay that quantifies the infectious titer
required to produce cytopathic effects in 50% of a tissue culture. However, the TCID50 assay is
also susceptible to some of the limitations of the plaque assay (e.g., long durations before
cytopathic effects are detectable).72
To improve the detection limit of plaque assays, integrated cell culture followed by
quantitative PCR (ICC-qPCR) has been used. The number of infective virus particles is enhanced
for detection by first culturing the virus particles with host cells. The virus is then extracted for RTPCR to quantify the amount of viral RNA. Samples that had infective virus particles produced a
larger end-point value during RT-PCR than samples that did not have viable virus. ICC-qPCR has
been used for many virus strains.67,73–76
An alternative method to detect viable viruses without cell culture is to pretreat the
collected samples with proteinase K and RNase before performing RT-PCR. If the virus envelope
is damaged (i.e., the virus is non-infective), proteinase K and RNase will break down the capsid
and any RNA that is not in a stable viral envelope. However, this method still requires optimization
and broader validation.67,77
Other detection methods exist but have not been fully developed or validated for
coronavirus. For example, ELISA and immunofluorescence assays that take 15-30 minutes have
been developed for influenza virus detection. While these tests have high specificity (98.2% from
bivariate random-effects regression), they have modest sensitivity (62.3%) only.78
As can be seen, most current methods take a few hours to measure virus RNA
concentration and days to measure virus infectivity. Additionally, most methods require
instrumentation and/or cell culture that may be inaccessible. There is a critical need for the rapid
detection (< hours) of viable infective virus not only from patient samples, but also from aerosols,
droplets, and fomites to better understand the infection risk via these transmission routes.
3.3 Modeling of infection risks
Mathematical models of infection risk can be useful to estimate the relative importance of
transmission routes and to evaluate the effectiveness of preventative measures. Here we discuss
several existing models of an individual’s risk of infection from their immediate environment. A
more detailed review can be found elsewhere.79 Large-scale models at the community level are
beyond the scope of this review, but can be found in prior work.80,81
Models of infection risk often consist of two tasks: estimating the viral load, or dose,
received, and estimating the infection risk based on the dose received. Infection risk models can
be classified as deterministic, where an individual is infected if the dose exceeds a critical value,
or stochastic, where an individual’s probability of infection is a function of the dose received.
Typically, stochastic models are more biologically relevant.79
To estimate the dose received, various strategies exist to model the transmission routes
of the virus from the surroundings to the individual. In the case of aerosol transmission, a Poisson
distribution is often used to describe the distribution of virus particles in the air.79 This distribution
can be used to estimate the dose an individual receives through aerosol inhalation.82 For the
7

Wells-Riley model (discussed later), the airborne “dose” is formulated in terms of a hypothetical
unit called a quantum of infection.83,84 The Wells-Riley “dose” includes parameters such as the
quanta generation rate, room ventilation rate, and exposure time to describe aerosol transmission
and can be further modified to account for complexities such as uneven mixing.79
In the case of fomite transmission, some models estimate the surface concentration
through deposition from an airborne source,85 while others directly prescribe a distribution on a
surface based on experimental measurements.86 The rate of virus transferred between two
surfaces is often formulated as the product of contact frequency, transfer efficiency, surface
concentration, and contact area in Eq. 1,
Ṅ𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑒 2 = 𝑓1,2 × 𝜀1,2 × 𝐶𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑒 1 × 𝐴𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑐𝑡 1,2

(Eq. 1)

where Ṅ𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑒 2 is the rate of virus transferred to surface 2, 𝑓1,2 is the frequency of contact
between surfaces 1 and 2, 𝜀1,2 is the transfer efficiency from surface 1 to 2, 𝐶𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑒 1 is the virus
concentration on surface 1, and 𝐴𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑐𝑡 1,2 is the contact area between surface 1 and 2.
The virus can be transferred serially between surfaces before finally transferring to an
individual’s facial membranes, giving the final dose received through fomite transmission.86 More
complex models integrate multiple transmission routes and phenomena together, such as a
Markov chain model of fomite and aerosol transmission that include a gradual loss of virus
viability.87
To estimate the infection risk based on the dose received, two popular models have
emerged: the Wells-Riley model and the dose-response model. The Wells-Riley curve is an
exponential curve and is based on a hypothetical “dose” unit called a quantum of infection as
described above.83,84 A basic form of the Wells-Riley curve is shown in Eq. 2,
𝑃 = 1 − 𝑒𝑥𝑝 (−

𝐼𝑞𝑝𝑡
)
𝑄

(Eq. 2)

where 𝑃 is the probability of infection, 𝐼 is the number of infectors, 𝑞 is the quanta generation rate,
𝑝 is the pulmonary ventilation rate of the susceptible individual, 𝑡 is the exposure time interval,
and 𝑄 is the room ventilation rate with clean air.79 While the Wells-Riley model is convenient to
use, its formulation based on the quantum of infection limits its application to aerosol transmission
only. Still, it remains a useful model and has been applied to various cases including SARS-CoV1.88
The dose-response model was adapted for respiratory viruses from models of toxicity.82
The dose input is a physical quantity of the virus, and can be extended to multiple situations
including aerosol transmission,82 fomite transmission,89 and the efficacy of surface disinfection
strategies.86 A basic form of an exponential dose-response curve is shown in Eq. 3,
𝑃 = 1 − 𝑒𝑥𝑝 (−

𝐼𝐺𝑝𝛽𝑡
)
𝑄

(Eq. 3)

where 𝑃 is the probability of infection, 𝐼 is the number of infectors, 𝐺 is the number of airborne
pathogens released per infector per unit time, 𝑝 is the pulmonary ventilation rate of the susceptible
individual, 𝛽 is the deposition fraction of pathogens in the alveolar region, 𝑡 is the exposure time
interval, and 𝑄 is the room ventilation rate with clean air. Extensions and alternative forms of the
dose-response curve can be found elsewhere.79,90
Some studies have begun to apply these models of individual infection risk to a larger
system such as a household. For example, interactions between multiple healthy individuals,
infected individuals, and objects in a household can be modelled and the dose-response model
is then applied to each individual.59,91 Ultimately, the choice of the model depends on the
8

application, and models of infection risks have emphasized the effectiveness of promising
interventions including fomite disinfection.85,86
4. Virus transmission via fomites
The ability of a virus to transfer between and persist on different surfaces, including skin, plays a
crucial role in the overall infectivity of a virus by means of fomite transmission. Understanding the
adsorption and transfer rates between skin and fomites is critical for modeling the spread of
viruses.5,92 Furthermore, understanding virus persistence on different surfaces under different
environmental factors can inform decision making for disinfection protocols. In this section, we
will review the factors affecting virus adsorption, transfer, and persistence on different surfaces,
and then discuss surfaces that are at high risk of contamination.
4.1 Physicochemical origin of virus adsorption and transfer
The adsorption of virus on fomites and their subsequent transfer to other surfaces is a multi-factor
problem that depends on the properties of the virus, the fomite, and the environment.
The physical description of virus adsorption borrows from formulations of colloid
adsorption, treating virus particles as soft colloidal spheres and using Gibbs free energy to model
the interactions between virus particles and the adsorbing surface. Like colloid adsorption onto
surfaces, virus adsorption onto fomites is primarily driven by electrostatic, hydrophobic, and van
der Waals interactions (Figure 3). The relative contribution of these interactions is modulated by
environment pH and ionic strength.4,92,93
Classical models of virus adsorption adopt the Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek
(DLVO) theory for colloid adsorption onto surfaces. It accounts for electrostatic and van der Waals
interactions between viruses and surfaces.94–96 However, the extended-DLVO (XDLVO) model,
which considers hydrophobic interactions, was found to agree more with experimental
observations of virus adsorption.97–99 XDLVO is expressed in terms of Gibbs free energy of
interaction, shown in Eq. 4,
𝛥𝐺𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 = 𝛥𝐺𝑑𝑙 + 𝛥𝐺𝑣𝑑𝑊 + 𝛥𝐺ℎ𝑦𝑑 − 𝑇𝛥𝑆0

(Eq. 4)

where electrostatic or double-layer (dl), hydrophobic (hyd), and van der Waals (vdW) contributions
are summed. Entropy changes (𝛥𝑆0 ) are usually ignored. A negative 𝛥𝐺𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 favors adsorption.95,96
Detailed formulations for each component of the total free energy for a spherical virus particle
adsorbing onto a flat plate can be found in prior work.98
Electrostatic forces drive long-range adsorption dynamics dictated by the radius of the
virus’s electrical double-layer (Debye length) and the charge of the absorbing surface.94,100 All
viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, express unique protein markers on their surfaces. These markers
consist of weakly acidic or basic polypeptides and amino acids ionizing residues that give viruses
characteristic isoelectric points (pI) (also see section 2.2).94,101 The net charge of a virus is thus
determined by the pH of its environment.94 The net charge on a virus causes the formation of an
electrical double-layer that extends from the Stern layer, the first layer of immobile charges
attached to the surface of the virus particles, and across the Gouy diffuse layer, the region of
charge imbalance that results in an electrical potential.102–104 In addition to pH, the ionic strength
of the surrounding medium is another important parameter affecting electrostatic interaction. At
high ionic concentrations (>100 mM NaNO3)100, electrostatic screening stunts the zeta potential
at the charge slipping plane and weakens the effects of surface charge for both attractive and
repulsive interactions.
In the absence of electrostatic interaction, if adsorption occurs, it is typically attributed to
hydrophobic interactions.100,102 The hydrophobic effect causes an attractive force between a virus
and adsorbing surface. The effect is due to electron-donor and -acceptor, i.e., Lewis acid-base,
interfacial interactions. Under hydrophobic interactions, there is a tendency of apolar species such
9

as molecular chains or particles to aggregate,96 providing an energetically favorable mechanism
of adsorption due to the minimization of interfacial area between the virus and the adsorbing
material.40 In the absence of electrostatic interactions, hydrophobic effects dominate because
they are apolar by nature. The energy of hydrophobic interactions largely depends on the
prevalence of hydrophobic groups on a virus particle’s surface. Greater virus hydrophobicity has
been shown to correlate with higher rates of adsorption regardless of ionic strength. 100,105,106 The
presence of chaotropic (i.e., SCN-, CI3CCOO-) or anti-chaotropic (i.e., NO3-, SO42-, F-) agents can
promote or hinder, respectively, hydrophobic adsorption.94 Hydrophobic interactions are
considered to have a short-range effect compared with electrostatics.
Van der Waals forces are considered to be of secondary importance. Their relative
contribution, as with electrostatic and hydrophobic interaction, is a function of virus and
environmental properties. For example, van der Waals forces may play a significant role in the
adsorption of viruses that carry a neutral charge in their environment.107 Furthermore, materials
known to generate large van der Waals potentials are also more likely to adsorb viruses. 94 The
contribution of van der Waals forces to adsorption can be quantified by Lifshitz theory, which
predicts that materials with higher dielectric susceptibility produce higher van der Waals
potentials. By this reasoning, metals have better adsorbing effectiveness than most organic
substances. In general, the effectiveness of materials to absorb viruses follows: Metals > Sulfides
> Transition Metal Oxides > SiO2 > Organics. This theory suggests that high ionic strength or a
fluid pH equal to virus pI is necessary for adsorption to most organics. Under these conditions,
the Debye length is shortened and viruses are able to get sufficiently near to organic surfaces to
absorb by van der Waals interactions.94,95,108
There exist some gaps in the comprehensive understanding of the physicochemical
mechanisms in virus adsorption onto fomites. While XDLVO theory on virus adsorption can begin
to explain the observations of many virus strains, including SARS-CoV-2, readily adsorbing to a
variety of non-porous surfaces (e.g., steel, glass, plastic),4,61,68,109,110 the observed virus adsorption
onto porous fomite surfaces (e.g., cardboard, cloth) is not well described by XDLVO. Some
studies have indicated the need to account for steric effects and surface roughness.40,106 Other
studies emphasized the pitfalls of modeling viruses as soft colloids with homogeneous charge
distributions. Unlike a soft colloid or even a virus-like particle (VLP) engineered with viral structural
proteins, the pI of true viruses depends on the complex physicochemical structure of the outer
surface and the genetic material packed within the capsid.100,107,111,112
The state of understanding in physicochemical mechanisms of virus adsorption in
aqueous environments is fairly advanced, but there is still significant room for research in
elucidating the mechanisms of dry contact transfer. Although a number of studies have quantified
the rates of transfer between dry surfaces, including skin (also see Section 4.2), the precise
physicochemical basis for virus transfer in dry conditions has been unaddressed. The tendency
of a virus to transfer between fomites is likely determined by differences in adsorption energies
between the two surfaces. In the case of porous materials, lower rates of transfer are likely due
to viruses entrapped in their matrix due to increased surface area for attachment.113,114
To our knowledge, no work has examined the physicochemical interactions, adsorption,
and transfer kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 on different surfaces especially in dry conditions.
4.2 Transfer efficiency of viruses between skin and other surfaces
Despite a lack of data on the transfer efficiency of coronaviruses, numerous studies have
examined the transfer efficiency for other viruses. An overall mean transfer efficiency of 23% ±
22% was found between fingerpads (either washed or unwashed prior to inoculation with a virus)
and glass for three types of non-enveloped bacteriophages (MS2, φX174, and fr). The efficiency
was calculated by measuring the viral PFU of the surface before and after contact. In this study,
prior handwashing was found to reduce the transfer efficiencies only slightly. The reduction due
to washing was greater in fingerpad-to-glass transmission than glass-to-fingerpad. This result is
10

likely because of changes in the skin moisture or pH due to handwashing before inoculation with
a virus.115 A similar transfer efficiency was found for MS2 from fingertips to glass and to acrylic
(~20%), but this value increased to 79.5% in humid conditions.114 Transfer efficiency of PSD-1
phage from hand to mouth was found to be 33.9%, representing a skin to skin pathway.116

and a surface. Ionizing residues on viral amino acids interact with surface hydroxyls groups on an
adsorbing surface. The Gouy layer forms from a local imbalance in charge concentration. These longrange electrostatic forces are attractive or repulsive based on the charges on the virus and the surface.
Apolar hydrophobic groups on the virus and surface exhibit shorter-range interactions. The complex
dielectric susceptibility (ε) mismatch of the virus, media, and solid surface drives van der Waals
interactions. Adapted from Gerba.94

4.3 Persistence of coronaviruses on different surfaces
Studies have shown that viruses adsorbed on surfaces can maintain high rates of survival and
infection potential. Exactly how long viruses retain their viability on a surface is highly variable
and dependent on: 1) surface porosity, 2) environmental factors, and 3) virus envelope
characteristics.113,117
First, nonporous surfaces, compared with porous surfaces, are more effective in receiving
and transferring viruses, and are typically better at preserving virus viability because they do not
draw moisture away from adsorbed viruses.118 However, if a porous material is inoculated, it is
capable of harboring most strains of viruses (especially at low temperatures e.g., 4℃), and can
remain contagious despite the lower rates of transfer to skin.113 SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated
an ability to contaminate a wide range of porous and nonporous fomites. Table 2 shows the
persistence of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses on various surfaces. To our knowledge, no
studies have evaluated the persistence of SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2 on skin. However,
parainfluenza was shown to be 5% viable within 10 minutes, while rhinovirus was shown to be
37.8% and 16% viable on skin after 1 and 3 hours, respectively. The percent of viability was
determined by comparing PFU before inoculation and at various times points.119 We note that no
work has explicitly investigated the physicochemical reasons why some surfaces support longer
virus persistence. As viruses can be inactivated by desiccation,29 improved persistence is likely
due to the ability of a surface to maintain a moist microenvironment.
Second, environmental variables such as temperature, humidity, and resident microfauna can
influence virus adsorption and viability. In general, increased temperature and moderate humidity
levels have adverse effects on the persistence and viability of coronaviruses and other viruses.32
In a study on the viability of dried SARS-CoV-1 on smooth plastic surfaces, the virus was found
to be viable for over 5 days at 22-25°C with 40-50% relative humidity (RH). However, virus viability

decreased significantly (>3 log10 reduction) at 38°C with >95% RH. 120 In another study using Phi6
as a surrogate, the virus survived best at high (>85%) and low (<60%) RHs. They also found that
RH is a more significant factor in virus survivability than absolute humidity (AH). 36 In addition to
temperature and humidity, the presence of other microbes can also influence the survival of
viruses. Though the presence of microbes can reduce the rate of desiccation of the viral particles
enhancing their persistence and viability, microbial proteases and fungal enzymes can be harmful
to their existence.121,122
Third, viral persistence on fomites also depends on the type and the strain of the virus. In
general, non-enveloped enteric viruses (e.g., adenovirus, rotavirus) can persist on fomites longer
than enveloped viruses (e.g., coronaviruses).4 The lack of a lipid membrane in non-enveloped
viruses make them less susceptible to inactivation than enveloped viruses, where the
disintegration of the lipid envelope (e.g., by common disinfectants; see details in section 5) causes
the loss of the viral envelope proteins involved in virus adsorption and cell penetration thereby
rendering them inactive.14 Additionally, non-enveloped viruses are less susceptible to desiccation
than their enveloped counterparts because of their lack of lipid membrane envelopes. These
characteristics make them easier to spread and persist on surfaces over long periods of time
compared with enveloped viruses.113
4.4 Surfaces at high risk of virus contamination
In principle, all surfaces or objects can be considered potential fomites and are at risk of
contamination.4,5 In practice, knowledge of which objects are at high-risk of contamination could
guide the design of optimal disinfection strategies. For a given object, the risk of contamination
can depend on the interaction between the virus and the material, the frequency at which the
object is contacted, the object’s distance from an infected individual, and the environmental
conditions.
First, the combination of virus composition and surface properties can influence the
likelihood of contamination (see details in Section 4.1). Second, objects that are frequently
handled or are in high contact with individuals are at higher risk of contamination. In a hospital
setting, contamination has been detected on numerous high-contact surfaces, including door
handles, bed rails, tables, call/control panels, other near-patient surfaces, office equipment, and
even sterile packaging.85,127 A study of the isolation rooms of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in
Singapore showed contamination of a similar list of high-contact surfaces.52 While the floor of the
isolation room and the shoes worn by individuals entering and exiting the room tested positive for
SARS-CoV-2, the floor immediately outside tested negative, suggesting contamination by
footwear is low.
Third, an object’s proximity to an infected individual affects its risk of contamination. An
object can be contaminated from a distance due to deposition of droplets or aerosols onto its
surface. The risk of contamination by droplets or aerosols decreases when the object is further
away from infected individuals, as viral shedding by coughing, sneezing, or exhaling can
potentially deposit droplets and aerosols onto fomites as far as 6 - 8 m away.47,48 In the
aforementioned Singapore study, all air samples taken from the isolation room tested negative
while the air outlet fans tested positive, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 is not detectably aerosolized
in these conditions but is still able to transfer from air to a potential fomite. 52 A study in Wuhan
hospitals found that the highest concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 in the air were, surprisingly, not
in patient rooms but in toilet facilities.51. Even aerosol generation from personal protective
equipment (PPE) removal can create fomites. Doffing PPE has the potential to aerosolize the
virus and transfer it to other PPE in changing rooms.51
Fourth, the environmental conditions can affect an object’s risk of contamination. Air
currents could potentially determine the flight path of droplets and aerosols, as proposed in a case
study of a Guangzhou restaurant where the SARS-CoV-2 infection pattern aligned with the air
conditioning currents.128 The amount of foot traffic and the degree of connectivity between rooms
14

could also affect where high SARS-CoV2 concentrations may be found.129 We note a limitation to
many of these studies is the use of RT-PCR to identify viral RNA. The presence of viral RNA is
not indicative of viability, and viral culture is needed to determine infective virus 66.
The above factors can be used to help identify and predict surfaces at high-risk of
contamination. To further quantify the role of these surfaces as fomites, surface viral
concentrations need to be measured, and contact frequencies can be derived from observational
studies.130 Such quantifications can be used as input parameters in modeling infection risk and
designing optimal disinfection strategies. For example, a model of disinfecting strategies for
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) predicted once-daily whole room cleaning to
be less efficient than frequent targeting of high contact surfaces in preventing indirect contact
transmission.85
5. Current strategies to intercept fomite transmission route
Strategies to intercept fomite transmission revolve around inactivating the virus, improving
personal hygiene, or using PPE. Here, we discuss different mechanisms of virus inactivation on
surfaces and hands, focusing on strategies that have been shown to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 and
other enveloped viruses. We will not discuss PPE as it has been discussed elsewhere.131–140
5.1 Reactivity of viral structures with disinfecting agents
In order for a virus to be infective, it must fuse with a host cell, insert its genome into the cell, and
replicate.141 These processes require an enveloped virus to have an intact envelope and
nucleocapsid. To inactivate a virus, at least one of these components needs to be disrupted.67
It is important to understand the mechanisms of virus inactivation based on virus
composition, structure and function in order to: 1) understand the efficacy of disinfectants on
viruses, 2) predict the response of a new strain of virus to a disinfectant, 3) identify common sites
on proteins, envelopes or genomes that are vulnerable to disinfectant treatment that are shared
by many viruses, and 4) enhance the design of antiviral agents and therapies that target specific
viral components.142
One method of predicting virus inactivation mechanisms is a composition-based method.
It takes into account the reaction rate constants between disinfectants and specific nucleotides
and amino acids found in viral structures (e.g., proteins, nucleic acids, and envelope lipids) (Table
3). The relative contribution of a viral structure to inactivation can be predicted by summing the
relative abundance of each nucleotide or amino acid multiplied by the respective rate constants
for a given disinfectant.21,142 A limitation of the composition-based method is that it does not
account for the complex interactions between adjacent monomers.142 To our knowledge, no model
exists that accounts for viral structure as well as composition.
5.2 Surface disinfection strategies
This section summarizes current disinfection strategies and their effectiveness for SARS-CoV-2
and related viruses (Figure 4).
5.2.1 Ultraviolet (UV) and solar irradiation
UV irradiation is a widely-used method of surface disinfection. Here, we discuss the inactivation
of SARS-CoV-1 by UVC and solar irradiation.
UVC irradiation (100 - 280 nm, typically 254 nm is used) damages nucleic acid bases in
genetic material, and to a lesser extent, proteins in virus capsids.67,141 UVC irradiation induces
dimerization of adjacent uracil bases in RNA, forming pyrimidine dimers that disrupt the RNA
structure, which inhibits the viral replication process and inactivates the virus.67,153 Exposure of
SARS-CoV-1 to a UVC light source (254 nm, 4016 µW/cm2) held 3 cm above the virus resulted
in a ~4.5 log10 TCID50/mL reduction in virus titer within 6 minutes. After this point, virus inactivation
plateaued, until viral activity became undetectable at 15 minutes. Exposure to other UV
15

wavelengths (e.g., UVA) was found to be insufficient to inactivate the virus.154
UVC irradiation as a disinfection strategy poses a few challenges. The time required to
inactivate SARS-CoV-1 using UVC (254 nm, 4016 µW/cm2), ~6 minutes, is significantly longer
than the time required using chemical disinfectants (30 s to 1 min). 110,154 This time to inactivate
only applies to regions of an object directly exposed to UVC irradiation. Disinfectant effectiveness
reduces significantly in shadowed regions. Additionally, UVC radiation may pose health risks,
including skin cancer and ocular damage to exposed individuals.155 Nonetheless, UVC-based
disinfection can be valuable for use in applications where the irradiation can be shielded from
humans, and have been used in, for example, empty buses and other vehicles.6
The inactivation of viruses by solar irradiation has also been studied, especially in the
context of the disinfection of water. The range of UV wavelengths in sunlight that reach the surface
of the earth is between 290 and 400 nm, as UVC is typically completely blocked by the
atmosphere.153,156 The antiviral properties of sunlight primarily come from UVB light, which can
also form pyrimidine dimers, but these mechanisms are not as well studied as the mechanisms
of UVC-based disinfection.153 Additionally, the solar spectrum, especially in the UV wavelengths,
can vary significantly depending on environmental factors, the time of day, and the season. Such
factors can lead to large variations in the efficiency of virus inactivation by sunlight.153
5.2.2 Chemical disinfectants
A wide variety of chemical disinfectants are currently available to combat the spread of SARSCoV-2 (Table 4).110 The effectiveness varies depending on the virus inactivation mechanism. In
general, there are 3 modes of inactivation by disinfectants: 1) disruption of the lipid layer of the
envelope (e.g., ethanol and detergents),67,143 2) modification of important protein sites on the
envelope or capsid (e.g., chlorine and glutaraldehyde),67,141,142,149,157 and 3) reaction with the
nucleotides and amino acids in the genetic material, leading to the degradation of the nucleic
acids (e.g., chlorine).67,141
Chemical disinfectants are typically evaluated with suspension and carrier tests.
Suspension tests combine a known titer of a virus in solution with a disinfectant and evaluate virus
titer after a period of time that depends on the disinfectant manufacturer’s directions of use.158
However, suspension tests are considered less challenging for the disinfectant under scrutiny,159
and may not reflect the practical usage of disinfectants to clean contaminated surfaces.
Quantitative carrier tests are performed by allowing an aliquot of virus solution to dry on a surface
before applying the disinfectant. This test is conducted under conditions that are more relevant to
practical use of disinfectants, and is, therefore, a more appropriate measure of disinfectant
effectiveness.159
Chemical disinfectants have been evaluated for their ability to inactivate various types of
coronavirus.68,110 For SARS-CoV-2, 1% and 2% household bleach, 70% ethanol, 7.5% povidoneiodine, 0.05% chloroxylenol, 0.05% chlorhexidine, and 0.1% benzalkonium chloride have been
found to reduce an initial viral load of ~7.8 log10 TCID50/mL to undetectable levels at room
temperature within 5 minutes in suspension tests.68 For other coronaviruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-1,
MERS-CoV, and MHV), 78%, 80%, 85% and 95% ethanol;160–162 75% 2-propanol;161 a mixture of
45% 2-propanol and 30% 1-propanol;162 0.21% sodium hypochlorite;163 and 1%, 4% and 7.5%
povidone iodine164 were found to reduce viral activity by at least 4 log10 within 30 seconds in
suspension tests.
Carrier tests performed on stainless steel disks showed >3 log10 reduction within 1 minute
for HCoV-229E, MHV, and TGEV exposed to 70% ethanol30 and for HCoV-229E exposed to 0.10.5% sodium hypochlorite and 2% glutaraldehyde.165 In another study, hydrogen peroxide vapor
inactivated TGEV in a carrier test by a reduction of 4.9-5.3 log10, but it took 2-3 hours to do so.166
Prior carrier tests have been performed primarily on stainless steel, and to our knowledge, no

carrier tests have been conducted for SARS-CoV-2 on any material. Results using stainless
steel carriers may not reflect disinfectant effectiveness on other fomites with different surface
properties (e.g., surface chemistry, wettability, porosity, roughness). The dependence of
disinfectant effectiveness on surface properties remains an open question.
5.2.3 Plasma disinfection
Plasma is an ionized gas made up of charged and uncharged particles (i.e., ions and electrons,
and molecules and atoms, respectively), reactive species, and UV photons.175,176 Plasma can be
thermal or non-thermal depending on whether electrons are at the same or higher temperature
18

as heavy particles. Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) is a low-temperature, non-thermal plasma
that is produced by a variety of methods using gases such as helium, argon, nitrogen, heliox
and/or air. Two common methods for producing CAP are dielectric barrier discharge and
atmospheric pressure plasma jet.175
CAP has been considered for disinfection applications in dentistry and oncology and in
food processing.175,176 The antimicrobial properties of CAP are attributed to reactive oxygen and
nitrogen species generated in the non-thermal plasma.176–178 The detailed inactivation
mechanisms are still under investigation. However, it is believed that the reactive species damage
genetic material and proteins.179 In one study, singlet oxygen in plasma was implicated in the
inactivation of bacteriophages through multiple mechanisms involving reactions with amino acids
and DNA nucleotide oxidation and crosslinking, but the primary mechanism was thought to be
singlet oxygen-induced crosslinking of capsid proteins.179
CAP has been shown to inactivate potato virus Y in water, in a study aimed to
decontaminate water supply systems. CAP was found to inactivate potato virus Y in 1 minute,
compared with 15 minutes using 25 mg/L of hydrogen peroxide.176 Plasma-activated water (PAW)
is another form of plasma-based disinfection. Water is treated with non-thermal plasma to produce
PAW, which is more acidic and contains more reactive oxygen and nitrogen species than regular
water180 rendering it antimicrobial. PAW has been proposed as an antiviral agent. For example,
in a study testing PAW for its potential application in producing an inactivated vaccine for
Newcastle disease (ND), the enveloped virus responsible for avian ND was found to be fully
inactivated in PAW.178 PAW has also been proposed for its potential application in the disinfection
of fresh produce.180 While promising in these studies, the effectiveness of CAP or PAW on
inactivating coronaviruses remains to be demonstrated.
5.2.4 Heat Treatment
Heat treatment is a well-known method for disinfecting surfaces. At temperatures exceeding
~80°C, viral capsid proteins are denatured and RNA is damaged.67 SARS-CoV-2 has been shown
to become inactivated within 5 minutes at 70°C, with a reduction from an initial concentration of
~6.8 log10 TCID50/mL to undetectable levels.68 Sufficiently high temperatures should be used.
Moderately high temperatures (19-37°C) only cause minor damage to the protein capsid, and fail
to inactivate some viruses.67
Autoclave is a common method of sterilizing equipment using heat treatment in a
laboratory or clinical environment. Autoclaves produce steam at high temperatures (~132°C) in a
pressurized chamber. At this temperature, most microbes, including viruses, are inactivated. The
surface being sterilized is exposed to the high temperature and pressure environment for a
varying amount of time, depending on the material and size of the object. Liquids are usually
sterilized for 30-60 minutes,181 while objects made of glass and plastics require ~30 minutes of
sterilization.182 In one experiment, avian coronavirus and avian pneumovirus carried by cotton
swabs were inactivated after heat treatment using an autoclave for 20 minutes. In the same study,
heating the same viruses in a microwave oven for 5 seconds was also found to be sufficient for
inactivation.183
5.3 Self-disinfecting materials and surfaces
Engineering self-disinfecting surfaces is an emerging avenue of research for preventing infection
transmission by fomites. While certain materials like copper and silver have long been known to
possess intrinsic antimicrobial properties, various types of surface modification and
functionalization can also give rise to antimicrobial properties against bacteria and viruses.127,184
Only a limited number of works have focused on virus-specific self-disinfection.185 This section
highlights some of these studies. Readers are referred to a recent review for details.186
Copper and silver alloys are known viricidal agents that inactivate viruses through multiple
modes of action. The primary mechanism involves direct interaction between metal ions and
19

microbial proteins, or indirect interaction through the formation of radicals that are damaging to
DNA and lipid membranes.187,188 Copper has been shown to retain its effectiveness across a
range of humidities and temperatures, while silver had drastically reduced antimicrobial
effectiveness at low humidities (~20% RH).189
Pure copper and alloys with 79-89% copper were found to be most effective in inactivating
viruses. Abrasion and removal of the outer oxide layer caused a slight decrease in effectiveness.
In one study, 5 x 105 PFU/cm2 of non-enveloped murine norovirus was inactivated in under 2
hours at room temperature.190 Inactivation of norovirus by copper was found to be up to 10x faster
in dry conditions compared to wet, but the mechanisms underlying such differences were
unclear.191 In another study, copper yielded a near 4-log reduction in enveloped influenza A virus
particle count after 6 hours.192 Table 2 includes the effectiveness of copper on some
coronaviruses in lowering viability periods. Some studies examining the clinical effectiveness of
copper surfaces have shown notable improvement towards infection control benchmarks with
94% less bacteria when compared with control plastic surfaces on ICU beds.193
Photocatalytic action has been shown to be highly effective in inactivating microbes by
damaging DNA and lipid membranes via the photocatalyzed formation of hydroxyl radicals in the
presence of photoactive oxides.194,195 Numerous enveloped and non-enveloped viruses have
been shown to become inactivated by photocatalytic disinfection.194 Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is a
popular photocatalytic material due to its long lifetime, effectiveness over a wide range of
microbes, and environmental friendliness. TiO2 has the potential to provide antiviral protection to
a range of materials. For example, cotton fabrics have been impregnated with TiO 2 via
magnesium nanoparticle carriers.196 TiO2 impregnated into resin, fiberglass, and PVC have also
been used to coat various surfaces in hospitals, schools, and other public places.197
Despite the potentials that self-disinfecting surfaces present, widespread adoption of selfdisinfecting surfaces, especially in hospitals, has been limited by three main obstacles. The first
is a lack of clinical trials showing their efficacy in practice. Second, the costs associated with
upgrading or retrofitting equipment discourages hospitals from taking initiatives to introduce selfdisinfecting surfaces, though the savings from decreasing nosocomial infections could offset this
cost. Third, characterization of effectiveness over repeated cycles has not yet been quantified.198
5.4 Hand hygiene
Frequent handwashing can lower the incidence of transfer from fomites to facial membranes via
contact.199 Considering the frequency that adults touch their faces (23 times per hour) and the
risk of infection that is associated with face touching, handwashing is a critically important
personal hygiene habit.43 In a hospital setting, the WHO recommends 5 critical moments for
healthcare workers to wash hands: 1) before contact with a patient, 2) before a cleaning
procedure, 3) after exposure to bodily fluids, 4) after contact with a patient, and 5) after contact
with fomites surrounding patients.200
Although virus transfer to hands is only mildly reduced after recent handwashing, 115,
handwashing is effective in reducing the spread of a virus from hands.199,201 However,
handwashing is only as effective as the frequency, the effectiveness of the antiseptic, and
thoroughness.201 The CDC recommends washing for a minimum of 20 seconds.202 This
recommendation was based on a few empirical studies,203–205 including one that investigated
handwashing practices such as wash time (15 s vs. 30 s) and effect of soiled hands on infectivity
reduction.206
To evaluate the effectiveness of a handwashing, a fingerpad method is typically
207,208
used.
Here a virus is inoculated on pre-cleaned fingerpads, allowed to dry, then subjected
to exposure to an antiseptic by static contact with the fingerpad.209,210 The ASTM specifies that an
effective handwashing antiseptic must yield a minimum reduction of 4 log10 (99.99%) in virus titer
from the initial inoculation titer. However, this standard does not specify a minimum contact time
between the fingerpad and the antiseptic.211 Another potential drawback of these standard tests
20

is that they may not be representative of in vivo handwashing behavior of healthcare workers or
the general public.208
Viruses present a unique challenge for handwashing in that their structure and ability to
survive on skin may evade inactivation by handwashing methods customized for bacterial
disinfection.199 Alcohol and isopropanol-based antiseptics (60-80% ethanol) are the most effective
non-hazardous antiseptic, especially against enveloped viruses.200 Other WHO-recommended
antiviral antiseptics (from the most to the least effective) are iodophors (0.5-10%), chlorhexidine
(0.5-4%), and chloroxylenol (0.5-4%), all of which are less effective than alcohol.212 In regard to
hand sanitizers, SARS-CoV-1 has been confirmed to be the most susceptible to ethanol and
isopropanol using suspension tests with 1 part virus at 107 TCID50/mL, 1 part media, and 8 parts
by volume of an ethanol- or isopropanol-based WHO-recommended antiseptic formulation. A >4
log10 SARS-CoV-1 reduction was achieved in 30 seconds using ethanol and isopropanol
formulations at 80% and 75% concentrations, respectively, and using dilutions as low as
40%.161,200
6. Methods of applying chemical disinfectants
Chemical disinfection remains one of the most commonly used methods for virus disinfection. The
effectiveness of chemical disinfection depends on the disinfectant contact time, the surface
properties of the fomite, and other environmental factors. As such, how the chemical disinfectant
is applied has a significant impact on the disinfection effectiveness. This section discusses two
common methods of disinfectant application: wiping, and spraying.
6.1 Wiping
For chemical disinfectants to work properly, they must be directly applied to the target surface.
The most straightforward and conventional method of applying a chemical disinfectant to a
surface is to use a manual wipe. Manual wiping utilizes both physical removal of viruses (which
may not kill the viruses), and chemical activity of the disinfectant.213 The chemical disinfectant can
be applied immediately before wiping, or the wipe can be packaged and pre-wetted with the
disinfectant. The wipe process typically takes seconds to complete.213 Despite its convenience,
manual wiping is limited by human error and cross-contamination between surfaces.214,215
If the proper protocols are followed, manual wiping can effectively disinfect surfaces
contaminated with norovirus,216,217 adenovirus 217 polyomavirus,217 and numerous bacteria
including Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile.218 However, the effectiveness of
manual wiping depends on multiple factors including the type of wipe, the type of disinfectant, the
target pathogen, the wiping technique (e.g., area covered, pressure applied), and the ratio of
disinfectant volume to target surface area.213 Insight into these factors, such as the effectiveness
of microfiber wipes,219 the number of wipe passes over a surface,220 and adsorption of
disinfectants to wipe material,221 could serve to optimize wipe protocols.
The key limitations of manual wiping arise from human error in the wiping process, and
cross-contamination of pathogens. Multiple studies reported that only ~40% of near-patient
surfaces in hospitals were cleaned according to policy.214 If wipes are re-used between surfaces,
there is a risk of transferring pathogens between surfaces.215 These limitations could potentially
have serious consequences especially in a hospital setting, and highlight the need for an
automated and effective disinfection strategy.
6.2 Spraying
While spray disinfectants are commonly used to disinfect surfaces,222 their effectiveness has not
been well characterized.223 To our knowledge, no comprehensive model has characterized spray
disinfection efficiency taking into account aerosol physics, virus heterogeneity, and surface
characteristics. Nevertheless, given that disinfection effectiveness depends on disinfectant
contact time (and thus disinfectant volume, if the evaporation of disinfectant is fast), the spray
21

characteristics (e.g., spray droplet size and density) and disinfectant droplet deposition on
surfaces are critical factors that must be considered in any attempt to evaluate the effectiveness
of spray disinfection (Figure 5).

Figure 5. Parameters defining spray dynamics. The sprayer/nozzle design affects the spray angle, spray
velocity and average droplet diameter. The spray droplets interact with the surface in several manners as
shown in the figure. These impact behaviors and post-impact behaviors are dependent on the droplet
properties, surface properties, droplet velocity, and temperature. Droplet-surface impact behavior
diagrams adapted from Nasr et al.223

Atomization is a general term referring to the disintegration of a liquid stream into
droplets.224 Table 5 summarizes a few common commercial atomizers. Atomizers that have been
used for applying surface disinfectants (and pesticides) include electrostatic atomizers, hydraulic
atomizers, pressure atomizers, spill return atomizers, and ultrasonic atomizers. In particular, spill
return atomizers, being able to produce fine sprays, have been shown to be applicable for
disinfecting healthcare surfaces.223 For classroom, healthcare, and general disinfection purposes,
handheld electrostatic sprayers also exist with adjustable spray parameters.225,226 In the
agriculture industry, electrostatic spray systems have been mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles
for spraying pesticides on crops.227,228 Drop size and drop-size distribution are critical parameters
determining spray disinfection efficiency.
Table 6 summarizes several considerations in the choice of droplet size for spray
disinfection.

7. Conclusions
The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed major gaps in our scientific knowledge, not only in the
biology of how the virus infects humans, but also the role of physicochemical processes and
surface science in the transmission and inactivation of the virus. Box 1 lists some of the open
questions we have identified. Addressing these questions will allow us to devise more effective
strategies to combat the spread of the disease. For example, quantitative models predicting the
locations of high-risk areas within a building and high-risk objects within those areas can inform
23

the prioritization for disinfection. The identification of surfaces with high contamination risk also
presents an opportunity for self-cleaning communal surfaces such as water faucets or door
handles. A better understanding of disinfectant effectiveness on different surfaces and their
potential side effects allows one to choose the optimal disinfection strategy for specific
applications. While our review is by no means exhaustive, we hope that it can provide the basis
for researchers in the physical sciences interested in COVID-19 to take on some of the open
research challenges, so that as a community we can be better prepared for the next pandemic.
Box 1: Open questions
Fomite transmission of viruses
● What is the infectivity of the fomite transmission route compared with other routes?
● How can infective viruses be detected in real-time?
● What is the adhesion and transfer efficiency of viruses between human skins and different surfaces?
● How do the surface properties of the virus and surfaces influence the adhesion, transfer, and persistence
characteristics?
● How can we better predict the locations and objects that are at high risk of virus contamination?
Surface disinfection
● How can one better predict the rate of virus inactivation based on its structure and composition?
● How do the surface properties (e.g., roughness, porosity, wettability, presence of impurities) alter
disinfectant effectiveness?
● What is the optimal disinfection strategy to maximize disinfection effectiveness but minimize side effects,
including health hazards, pollution, and damage to surfaces?
● What innovations are needed for self-disinfecting surface technologies to be adopted broadly?
