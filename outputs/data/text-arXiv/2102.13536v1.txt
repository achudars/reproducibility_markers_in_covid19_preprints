Abstract—Quantum key distribution (QKD) is the most used
protocol in the context of quantum cryptography for sharing a
private encryption key between two parties. Covid-19 pandemic
has raised the ever-increasing need for online communications
a lot; this requires enhanced security protocols. QKD has the
potential to meet a global scale network's security requirements.
Despite considerable progress, all ground-based QKD
approaches have distance limitations due to atmospheric or
fiber attenuation. A global network scheme can use intersatellite
links to establish a trusted node network with constellations.
This enables key elements for quantum internet which allows
secure exchange of information between quantum computers.
The most cost-effective and iterative approach for this goal is to
exploit CubeSats. This paper summarizes technical challenges
and possible solutions to enable a global QKD network using
CubeSats. We discuss practical concerns and alternative paths
involved with implementing such systems.
Keywords—QKD, entanglement, CubeSat, SPDC

I. INTRODUCTION
Increasing demand for security-enabled communication
services on the ground and in the sky necessitates adoption of
new tools and systems and the Covid-19 pandemic raised this
as more and more operations are performed online or
remotely by humans, robots, and other machines. Among the
challenges associated with realization of security-enabled
communication services, sharing a secret key is the most
critical one and requires access to a number of trusted parties.
Quantum key distribution (QKD) can do this with high level
of security using axioms from quantum mechanics. Large
scale QKD networks need direct line-of-sight optical links
that are hard to realize on the ground due to excess loss and
noise in long distances typically needed at the global scale.
Elevated altitudes can be a solution to this problem and
CubeSat is a technology that promises relatively cheap and
scalable solution to challenges of QKD [1].
This paper considers challenges in deploying a global
QKD network employing CubeSats and addresses some of
them. The paper is structured as follows. In Section II, we
will briefly review constraints and challenges of intersatellite
QKD. In Section III, protocol related concerns will be
addressed. Finally, Section IV concludes the paper and gives
ideas for further investigation.
II. CONSTRAINTS AND CHALLENGES OF INTERSATELLITE
QKD
CubeSats are proven to be ideal hosts of quantum
payloads for establishing large scale QKD networks, due to

their cost-effectiveness and ease of design [2]. However, the
trade-off of using such a technology is to miniaturize the
payload to fit into CubeSat standards, i.e. the size, weight and
power (SWaP) requirements of a CubeSat should be
considered. The SWaP requirements also put constraints on
the optical and RF link budgets, computational power of the
embedded system.
A. Optical Link
Correct modelling and subsequent optimization of the
optical link is critical for any optical communication system.
Appropriate estimation of loss factors effecting the link
quality allows for improvement of the link. The link quality
determines the communication bandwidth and error rate
directly. In a laser based classical free space optical
communication,
link
quality
is
dependent
on
transmitter/receiver efficiencies, pointing accuracy and
distance. In such systems it is possible to diverge the beam to
compensate for the pointing accuracy related losses.
However, since each photon carries information specific to
itself in QKD, perfect mode overlap between transmitter and
receiver is necessary.

Right: Layered intersatellite QKD network topology.

Transmitter and receiver efficiencies are statistical
average values for a SPDC and photon counting based QKD
protocol. SPDC process generates photon pairs
probabilistically, so effective photon rate can change with an
average value during operation. Similarly, photon detection
by APDs is a probabilistic process.
Laser beams are generally considered as Gaussian beams
with intensity distribution on a surface perpendicular to
propagation. With distance, Gaussian beams diverge with an
angle 𝜃 depending on beam waist 𝜔 , thus the aperture size
of the optical telescope assembly, and wavelength 𝜆 as
𝜃=

and beam width is 𝜔(𝑧) = 𝜔

/

.

A highly collimated beam is desired as the beam gets wider,
the photon distribution also gets wider and more photons fall
outside of receiver telescope at a distance. However, the

drawback of a narrower beam is that the received intensity
loss is more dependent on the pointing uncertainty due to the
centric nature of Gaussian distribution which can be written
as below with peak intensity:

performance against the change of temperature. The other
commonly used nonlinear mediums are periodically poled
KTP and LN crystals, which require temperature tuning to
obtain the desirable entanglement source characteristics; this
is undesirable in satellite based QKD. The photon pairs
produced in BBO crystal have high-frequency bandwidth
(low coherence time) compared to periodically poled
crystals, effectively reducing the magnitude of the
normalized second-order correlation function 𝑔( ) . Low 𝑔( )
increases noise collection in the system. Figure 1 shows the
change in the magnitude of the second-order correlation at
zero delay with different source bandwidth values. The
problem originated as the 𝑔( ) spectrum obtained at the time
stamp involves the convolution of the correlation function
and the detector impulse response (detector function) which
can be characterized by
𝑔( ) (𝜏) = 𝑒

Fig. 2.

Red beam demonstrates the mismatch in detected photons
with a pointing error.

In order to model the effects of distance and pointing error
losses on key rate, we need to consider coincidence
probabilities. If we employ a more complex intersatellite
QKD scheme such as in Fig. 1, with a satellite distributing
entangled photon pairs for QKD between two satellites
instead of the generic scheme where the two satellites share a
quantum key directly, we encounter another concern
regarding the actual coincidences. According to preservation
of momentum in SPDC process, the photons of a pair in their
respective beams are symmetrical with respect to the center
as in Fig. 2. This results in a dramatic decrease and an
eventual loss of coinciding pairs with pointing errors as one
of the photons fall outside of the receiving telescope. This
effect can be examined in the Fig. 3 below. The solution to
this problem is simple: If one of the beams is inverted through
a confocal lens structure, the beams become equivalent in
photon distributions.

Fig. 3 Blue lines represent the coincidence probability with the
effect mentioned in the above paragraph. Red lines represent the
coincidence probability with that effect compensated.

The photon source for establishing a QKD network is
realized by the spontaneous parametric down-conversion
(SPDC) process. SPDC utilizes second-order nonlinear
susceptibility tensor 𝜒 ( ) in a suitable material. Mostly,
satellite-based QKD utilizes 𝛽-barium borate (BBO) crystals
as the nonlinear medium because of its unaltered

[𝑓 (𝜏) + 𝑓 (𝜏)]

(2)

where R is the photon pair rate, 𝜏 is the coherence time of
the source that converts bandwidth 𝛥𝜈 by 𝜏 = 1 2𝜋𝛥𝜈 , 𝜏
is the combined effect of detector timing jitter 𝜏 and
timestamp coincidence window 𝜏 that defines as
𝜏 =

2𝜏 + (𝜏 /2)

and [𝑓 (𝜏) + 𝑓 (𝜏)] is the error

function
𝑓± (𝜏) = 𝑒

characterized

by

and 𝑒𝑟𝑓(𝑥) is the error

function. The timing jitter effectively creates uncertainty in
the correlation time along with the reduced magnitude of
second-order correlation as a result of the high bandwidth of
the photon pair source created in BBO crystal in the
parametric down-conversion process. The large bandwidth of
SPDC photons limits the maximum applicable spectral
filtering for daylight operation. In this context, non-critical
phase matching crystals are preferrable due to their narrow
bandwidth photons. However, the challenge of temperature
control of crystal makes critically phase-matched crystals still
better candidates, like BBO.

Fig. 4 Plots were obtained by considering the pair source having
bandwidths 300, 400 MHz, 500 MHz and 600 GHz. The difference
in the magnitude f (0) of the 𝑔( ) is increasing with bandwidth.

A. Attitude Control and Pointing Accuracy Requirements
A CubeSat-based QKD system has fundamentally the
same limitations of an optical satellite communication link,
i.e., the pointing accuracy. In a typical CubeSat optical
transmission system, the main sources of signal loss are
geometrical loss and pointing loss. For the geometric part, the

link gain which is calculated according to the antenna theory
is directly proportional to aperture size of the CubeSat and
the ground station telescopes. Size of a typical CubeSat's
telescope is limited by the bus size (10 cm) which limits the
diameter of a typical onboard telescopes to be around 8 cm.

behave in this manner: each measurement made on Alice’s
sequence alters it. Eavesdroppers trying to intercept Alice’s
message would inevitably leave a trace on the sequence, thus
the error rate of Bob’s measurements would become
unusually large, reveling the presence of third parties.

The size of the ground station's telescope is constrained
by atmospheric turbulence. The main portion of geometrical
loss is attributed to the CubeSat's telescope size. In the design
consideration of an intersatellite link, the two main sources
of losses in the link are:

2- Entanglement based: Entangled particles are born in a
way such that their quantum states are described in a
combined state, i.e. the state of each particle depends on the
other, regardless of the distance in between, making this type
of protocols are very favorable in larger networks, especially
in satellite systems. In such protocols Alice and Bob use
entangled pairs distributed by an entangled particle generator.
Measuring any entangled particle would change the state of
the overall system, therefore if any eavesdropper tries to
intercept and measure the sequence of Alice, it alters the
system, revealing the interception attempt.

1. Precise orbit determination (POD) and angle accuracy
in pitch and yaw.
2. Accurate beam pointing.
For the POD, despite high doppler shift of L-band RF
signals due to high speed of CubeSats, our solution is based
on combination of Global Navigation Satellite Systems
(GNSS) including the US GPS, the Russian GLONASS, the
European Galileo and the Chinese BeiDou. Previous works
show that with some modifications in the firmware of lowcost, low-power available commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)
devices, it is possible to reach fine positioning precision of
0.1 m and velocity precisions of 0.1 m/s [5, 6]. The stabilized
non-rotating platform of the CubeSat in this design is an
advantage for the GNSS subsystem which provides
continuous operation without loss of synchronization without
the need to re-acquisition [4]. For CubeSats, two degrees of
freedom accuracy in pitch and yaw there is no need for
modification and current technologies can be used that
generally provide around 50 microradians of pointing
uncertainty.
The next challenge in this design is accurate beam
pointing. The pointing inaccuracy is the primary cause of loss
in the link. It increases bit error rate of single photons. To
alleviate the problem of inaccurate beam pointing, in addition
to using fast steering mirror (FSM) after telescope, it is
possible to use an innovative improvement that is based on
high density matrix of Geiger-mode-operated avalanche
photodiodes also known as Silicon photomultipliers [7].
Silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) is a solid-state
photodetector made of an array of hundreds or thousands of
integrated single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs), called
microcells or pixels. By using SiPM instead of single APD in
the receiver side, a considerable improvement in pointing
requirements can be achieved because this way there is no
need to tune the FSM with such a precision to assure a single
photon lands on the active area of a single APD. In this design
instead, there are few thousands photodetectors with
milimeter size effective photosensitive area that increases the
photon capture probability by orders of magnitude even in
extreme and poor pointing conditions. Such an improvement
can be achieved with a product like S13720 from Hamamatsu
which has good sensitivity around 760 nm.
III. PROTOCOL RELATED CONCERNS
QKD protocols can be classified into two main categories
according to the quantum property they exploit:
1- Prepare and measure (PaM) protocols: In quantum
physics, any measurement made on a quantum state causes it
to “collapse”, i.e. changes the initial state itself. Qubits

Although PaM protocols are more commonly used,
entanglement based networks have the advantage as it allows
other quantum protocols that can be used to interact distant
stationary qubits.
A. Data Link Budget and Key Rate
In order to extract the actual key from the received
photons, several post processing steps must be taken. First, a
sifted key is obtained by determining the coincidences using
the time correlation between photon pairs produced by the
SPDC process. After determining the coincidences,
measurement basis reconciliation made on the public
classical channel and only the photons that are measured in
the same basis are used as the sifted key.
Due to strong correlation between the photon pairs, crosscorrelation function of the detected photons will have a peak
at the time delay value between two receiving nodes. Photons
with time difference equal to that delay are considered as
coincidences. Cross-correlation between the two functions is:
[𝑓(𝑡) ⋆ 𝑔(𝑡)](𝜏) = 𝑓(−𝑡) ∗ 𝑔(𝑡) (𝜏)
𝐹 𝑓(−𝑡) = 𝐹{𝑓(𝑡)}

(3)
(4)

Utilizing the property in Eq. (2), FFT of the signals can
be used to compute the cross-correlation in a more efficient
way. In general time complexity of the cross-correlation
function in time domain is 𝑂(𝑁 ) and in the Fourier domain
it is 𝑂 𝑁 ⋅ 𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝑁) . For long signals and low computational
power, efficiency in computing the cross-correlation is vital
for the performance of the QKD protocol. Cross-correlation
computation of two signals of 100 μs and 500 photons in this
window, with 1.296 ns time bins takes around 30 minutes
with a program written in C. Same cross-correlation is
computed in 0.021 seconds with SciPy library using an FFT
based method.
There are two parameters to be optimized while
computing the cross-correlation functions, time bin size and
coincidence window. Time bin size determines the
quantization of the timestamps and the fundamental time unit
of the QKD protocol. This quantization has three effects.
First, it determines the maximum bit rate that can be achieved
as it limits the photon count rate. Only one photon is counted
in each time bin. Second, it affects the security of the QKD
protocol from a timing jitter side channel attack, which will
be explained in the next section. Third, it reduces the required
classical communication bandwidth since the quantized
timestamps have less bits. In intersatellite communications,

data link budget can be as important and can be directly
related to power budget.
Coincidence window is the time period in which two
measured photons are counted as coincidences after time
synchronization between two parties. This window is needed
due to timing jitter of the photon detectors. As can be seen in
Figure 5, a larger coincidence window results in detection of
more coincidences. However, it also increases the rate of
accidental coincidences. Accidental coincidences may
introduce bit errors in the shared key and reduce S-value of
CHSH inequality violation check.

where 𝑥 is a label that stands for a base in a basis set which
represents a measurement basis for one communicating party.
All the bases that span the Hilbert space of this basis set
should be taken into account, e.g. 𝑥 = {0,1} for rectilinear
basis set (45 , 135 ) ≡ (0,1). 𝑝 (𝑥) is a priori probability of
appearing of 𝑥 in the protocol. 𝑑 (𝑡)is the timing histogram
of a detector, namely, the photon counting function of a
detector.
In a detection module, there are optical paths at the
amount of the number of values of 𝑥 can take relating to a
measurement basis. An optical path starts from the point that
a photon enters into the detection module and ends at the
point of its detection. Two important parameters that
determine the amount of mutual information are ∆𝑡 and time
bin size. ∆𝑡 is the difference between the optical path length
+ and the centroid location of photon counting function of
detectors.
In Fig. 6, there are two detectors, one is shifted at the
amounts of ∆𝑡 according to the other. These two detectors
have the same timing histogram profile other than the
centroid locations.

delay (4096 ns) between the signals

Any bit errors in the key due to non-ideal entanglement
fidelity, detected double pairs due to probabilistic nature of
the SPDC procedure, or other factors must be corrected using
the public channel without compromising the security of the
key. There are several methods for error correction proposed
in the literature [8]. The most common one being the parity
check based cascade, other methods include Hamming codebased Winnow protocol, and LDPC codes commonly used
for error correction in classical high-speed communications.
During the error correction process, some information
about the key is leaked to third parties as the error correction
is done on the public channel. Privacy amplification methods
are employed to mitigate this security problem. Privacy
amplification is generally achieved by using a set of universal
hashing functions to generate a shorter but randomized new
key.

B. The optimization of publicly shared information through
the classical channel
Consider two communicating parties that exchange
information about photon detection times and measurement
bases. An eavesdropper can access measurement results by
using them and it is quantified by mutual information
between them [11]:

horizontally and vertically polarized signal and idler photon are created in BBO1 and BBO2, respectively. The blue pump cut-off from the
system by a dichroic mirror. A temporal pre-compensator and post-compensator clean up the temporal information. Two BBO post
compensators (12 & 13) are placed to erase the spatial uncorrelation that can reveal which-crystal information. Photon counters and halfwave plates are indicated with letters ‘C’ and ‘H’ respectively.

In Fig. 7, change in the mutual information is shown as a
function of time bin size for different ∆𝑡 s. Time bin size
parameter is shown as bin widths in the graph. When bin
width is scanned along the main distribution of timing
histogram, it is seen that peaks occur at some points. In the
occurrance of peaks, the starting time of binning in the timing
histogram, in other words the position of the main
distribution in the whole time interval, is important. Since an
absolute decay of mutual information is not seen, the bin
width value which will be used in the QKD protocol should
be chosen carefully.
The binned versions of timing histogram corresponding
to the minimum and maximum values are seen in Fig. 9 and
10 respectively. The goodness and badness of bin widths can
be seen in the shape of the binned versions.

C. Quantum Payload Layout
The co-polarized entangled photon pairs, called signal
and idler, produced in an SPDC process spectrally separated
by a dichroic mirror as shown in Figure.4. Our QKD scheme
consists of two entangled photons sources at each party (only

one party is shown in Fig. 4 for simplicity, the other party
consists of an identical arrangement). The QKD system
involves three distinct basis settings 𝐴 = ±22. 5∘ , 𝐴 =
±67. 5∘ , A = 0∘ , 90∘ on one side and three basis settings
𝐵 = 0∘ , 90∘ , 𝐵 = ±45∘ , 𝐵 = 0∘ , 90∘ on the other side
for achieving polarization measurement on photon pairs in a
singlet state |𝜓⟩ = (|𝐻𝐻⟩ + |𝑉𝑉⟩) . Basis settings 𝐴 and
√
𝐵 are parallel, and therefore corresponds to horizontal horizontal polarization detection leads to perfectly correlated
results; used for sharing the row key. Other bases are used for
performing a violation of CHSH inequality S, with 𝑆 =
𝐸(𝐴 , 𝐵 ) + 𝐸(𝐴 , 𝐵 ) + 𝐸(𝐴 , 𝐵 ) − 𝐸(𝐴 , 𝐵 ) .
The value of E is calculated by
𝐸(𝐴 , 𝐵 ) =

D. Photon detection optimization
For the On-board single photon detection and counting
we considered two main challenges in design. The first
challenge is need for high computing power on-board
satellite for time-correlation of photons. Our solution for this
challenge is based on reconfigurable and fault tolerant use of
COTS (commercial off the shelf) FPGAs.
Application of non-radiation hardened FPGAs have been
tested in recent years and approved on many CubeSat projects
and products [12]. Using techniques like TMR fault tolerance
inside the FPGA [9, 10] enables us to use COTS FPGAs in
aerospace applications. This design can support possibility of
generating hyper-entangled states, where multiple quantum
states can be encoded into a single photon. To be able to use
both polarization and time-bin degree of freedom an on-board
reconfigurable FPGA will be used in design. The on-the-fly
reconfiguration ability of the FPGA provides a considerable
advantage in power saving and reliability. It means that for
the times that we need single-photon timestamp correlation,
the FPGA is configured as a Time-Correlated Single Photon
Counter (TCSPC) and in the free time slots it will be
configured to perform other tasks like soft processor,
software radio modem, etc. By using the mentioned advanced
techniques, we will be enabled to use COTS FPGAs like
Zynq series in our design for both On-board soft computing
purposes and hard real-time tasks like Time-Correlated
Single Photon Counting. This will enable us to implement
intersatellite Quantum links in CubeSat with low power
consumption and low cost.
The second challenge in single photon detection is based
on rapid temperature changes of the satellite due to exposure
to the sun which causes considerable changes in the photon
detection efficiency of Avalanche Photo Diodes (APD) that
are used for single photon detection. Our solution to this
challenge is based on a feedback loop which detects the
amplitudes of the analog pulses coming from APD and tunes
the High-voltage bias of the APD according to pulse
amplitudes. Using this technique, we will stabilize the photon
detection efficiency of the on-board single photon detector.
IV.CONCLUSION
The QKD reached the threshold to become a global
network. CubeSat technology seems as the best candidate for
achieving this goal. However, the SWaP restrictions impose

constraints on other parameters. A careful design is required
to overcome the challenges on optical link, data budget and
other parameters. Another set of challenges come from the
QKD protocol steps. A poor choice of time bin size, geometry
of quantum payload or type of detectors may result in
possible side channel attacks. However, it is possible to
exploit CubeSats for the purpose of a global QKD network
with careful design and optimization of parameters.
