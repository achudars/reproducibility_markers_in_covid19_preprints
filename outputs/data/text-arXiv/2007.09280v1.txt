During the beginning of 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic took the world by surprise, rapidly
spreading undetected between and within many countries and wreaking havoc on the global
economy both through death tolls and lockdowns. Healthcare professionals treating the
coronavirus patients grapple with a massive and unprecedented shortage of Facepiece
Respirators (FPRs) and other personal protective equipment (PPE), which act as fundamental
tools to protect the health of the medical staff treating the patients affected by the coronavirus.
-1-

As of as of May 18th, 2020, this shortage has directly and indirectly lead to the deaths of over
1000 medical personnel, and as the looming threat of a second wave approaches the medical
field braces for another shortage. While many FPRs are designed to be disposable single-use
devices, the development of affordable and efficient sterilization strategies is necessary to
circumvent future shortages. Here, we describe the development of a plasma-based method to
sterilize PPE such as FPRs with ozone. The system’s novel design uses a flow-through
configuration where ozone directly flows through the fibers of the PPE through the maintenance
of a pressure gradient. Canonical ozone-based methods place the mask into a sealed ozonecontaining enclosure but lack pressurization to permeate the mask fibers. In this device, ozone
is created through an atmospheric pressure Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD) fed with
compressed air. Due to limited supply and clinical need of FPRs, we demonstrated sterilization
with surgical masks. We demonstrate rapid sterilization using E. coli as a model pathogen. This
decision was made based on the safety and availability of this pathogen, with understanding
that bacterial cell walls make them generally harder to eradicate than viral pathogens. A flowthrough configuration enables a >400% improvement of the sterilization efficiency with respect
to the canonical approach. This method has potential for a broad and cost-effective utilization.
Using the power supply from a readily available plasma ball toy, a plastic box, a glass tube,
steel mesh, and 3D printed components, we designed and tested an extremely affordable
portable prototype system for rapid single mask sterilization which produced comparable
results to its large high-cost equivalent.

Introduction

In the beginning of 2020, COVID-19 rapidly emerged as a global pandemic that has resulted in
hundreds of thousands of deaths. Unprepared for this crisis, healthcare professionals
-2-

experienced a shortage of disposable Personal Protective Equipment (PPE); in particular
Facepiece Respirators (FPRs), such as designated N95 masks in the US and the FFP3 respirators
in Europe. These respirators are fundamental tools that protect medical personnel caring for
COVID-19 patients. Their designations are earned by the ability to filter out 95% and 99% of
particulate matter at or above 0.3 microns in size1, the scale of an average virion. The response
to this disease has been severely compromised by the lack of adequate PPE. Disruptions to the
PPE global supply chain have led to month-long delivery times and massive price increases,
leaving doctors and nurses unprotected. As manufacturers are called upon to meet demand,
healthcare providers have improvised with less effective substitutes.2 While, based on
manufacturer recommendations, the FPRs are single-use PPE and the US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) does not formally recommend their decontamination and re-use,
it is acknowledged that in these times of scarcity, decontamination might be considered as a
good “practical” solution.3 The development of standardized approaches to decontaminate
fibers, restore filtering electrostatic charge, and in general re-use FPRs is a necessary to mitigate
impact on both humans and the environment due to their future increased use, as the World
Health Organization estimated that a 40% increase of the global PPE supplies will be needed.4
Ozone (O3) is an allotropic form of oxygen with proven pan-viricidal and bactericidal
capabilities. It is already widely employed on an industrial scale for wastewater treatment.5
Notably, O3 has been reported as effective in de-activating other members of the coronavirus
family6,7 and the bacteriophage MS2,8 a virus previously shown to be more resistant to UVbased disinfection with respect to coronaviruses.9 Additionally, O3 can be directly produced
from air (e.g. via plasmas or irradiation with UV light) and reconverted into non-hazardous O2
with the aid of catalytic converters.10 Therefore, unlike other compounds, O3 can be readily
-3-

manufactured with cost-effective approaches at the point-of-use. As a gaseous sterilization
agent it is a particularly promising option for disinfecting poorly accessible spaces within
porous materials, such as FRPs. While both consumer-grade and large-scale O3 sterilization
devices are widely available for deodorizing and sanitizing both rooms and objects, the design
of these systems is not optimized for the disinfection of FPRs. In consumer grade O3
sterilization devices objects are loaded into a sterilization chamber which is then sealed and
flooded with O3. O3 passively diffuses into the objects and may slowly enter the porous media
of an FPR.
With this contribution we propose an efficient O3 sterilization approach specifically
designed for FPRs. Compressed air is fed into a cylindrical atmospheric pressure Dielectric
Barrier Discharge (DBD) plasma that when ignited rapidly produces O3. The gas flow is then
forced directly through the porous media of the FPR, which is directly connected to the plasma
reactor. This method uses a non-thermal plasma to produce O3, which avoids thermal
decomposition of FPRs as the output gas is near room temperature. The efficacy of this method
was compared to the canonical method by quantifying the sterilization efficiency of surgical
masks saturated with E. coli. This pathogen was chosen due to its safety, availability, and ease
of use with recognition that the cell envelope presented by bacterial pathogens are generally
more problematic to ozone than viral capsids, though there is still debate as to whether viruses
are more susceptible overall.11 Finally, we demonstrate that this approach can be readily
adapted as a low-cost solution by using the power supply of a widely available commercial
plasma globe toy, a few 3D printed parts, some steel mesh, and a plastic box, to construct a
portable low-power system capable of attaining similar sterilization efficiencies.

Experimental Section

2.1

DBD Plasma reactor for FPR sterilization

Figure 1 shows the DBD reactor used for the mask sterilization experiments. The system
comprises a quartz tube (10 mm outer diameter; quartz wall thickness 1 mm), an outer copper
electrode connected to a DC power supply (Trek High Voltage Amplifier 10/40A/HS connected
to a signal generator; 10 kHz sinusoidal wave with amplitude between 1 kV and 10kV) and a 6
mm stainless steel tube as a grounded electrode. Compressed air is flown through the system at
constant rate of 10 slm controlled by a King Instruments flowmeter.
The waveform of the discharge voltage V was measured from the output of the power supply
while the waveform of the discharge charge Q was recorded using a 20 nF capacitor, serially
connected to the grounded electrode. Both V and Q were recorded using a digital oscilloscope
(Tektronix AFG320).

experiments.

2.2

Low-cost plasma reactor for FPR sterilization

Modifying a plasma globe toy (in these experiments a 6-inch Theefun plasma globe) can
produce a system that is able to evolve O3. This is due to the flyback transformer and the timer
circuit within the system that produces low-current and high-voltage (1 kV to 6 kV) sawtooth
or ramp output signals near or at a frequency of 30 kHz. This output is low enough in frequency
and high enough in amplitude that it is capable of sustaining a DBD plasma. In order to take
advantage of this system the electrode geometry was adjusted so that a steel mesh inside the
-6-

reactor was powered and the external electrode (now consisting of metallic HVAC tape to
further lower material costs) was grounded. Additional material was placed within the mesh
acting as a flow control, forcing all compressed air to pass through the plasma region. Figure
2 displays this system via a schematic, a picture and the concurrent circuit diagram. For a more
direct comparison between the original and the low-cost system, the same flowmeter was used
in both systems, however if implemented the simple 3D-printed stopcock design is able to
effectively act as an imprecise flowmeter. Analysis of the electrical output characteristics of
this system was performed in the same way as for the system outlined in section 2.1.

2.3

Gas composition characterization

The chemical composition of the gas at the outlet of the plasma discharge was measured via an
FTIR spectrometer positioned orthogonally to the plasma stream as shown in Figure 3. The
reactor was located to one side of a stainless-steel cross connector (KF 25) and, perpendicular
to the gas flow, an IR source (Newport 80007) was placed in front of a KBr window. The
transmitted light through the gas path was collected after another KBr window by a FTIR
spectrometer (Nicolet iS50) (from 800 to 4000 cm-1; 50 cumulative averages). Absorption
spectra were measured as a function of voltage discharge from 0 to 10 kV. For each applied
voltage, a background was acquired before striking the plasma and subtracted.

Figure 3. The same system was used to characterize the chemical composition (FTIR
spectrometer and IR source) and the ozone concentration (V-INR monochromator and UV
lamp) after the plasma discharge.

-8-

The concentration of ozone after the plasma discharge was carried out by means of UV
absorption spectrum with the same configuration used for the chemical composition
measurements (see schematic Figure 3). However, a standard UV lamp (Analytik Jen Pen-Ray
90001201) and V-NR spectrometer (Acton Spectra Pro, Princeton Instruments), connected to a
CCD camera, substituted the IR source and the FTIR spectrometer, respectively. The KBr
windows were also replaced by SiO2 ones to minimize UV light absorption before and after the
gas optical path.

The signal intensity at λ=253 nm, where the peak of the ozone absorption cross section is
located,12 was captured by the CCD camera for different discharge voltages from 0 to 10 kV.
In addition, the same signal intensity was recorded at different times (from 0 min to 64 min in
steps accordingly to the sterilization times) to study the stability of the ozone production. These
measurements were used to calculate the ozone concentration by Equation 1.13

Where Ioz and Io are the intensity of the signal with and without the presence of ozone
respectively, L is the distance in cm of the light path inside the gas (in this case 10.5 cm), σ is
the absorption cross section of ozone at approximately 12 ×10-18 cm2, moz is the atomic mass of
ozone and N is the Avogadro’s number. For consistency with common presentation of ozone

All assays were performed using E. coli β10 cells transformed with a plasmid that confers
ampicillin resistance and encodes green fluorescent protein (GFP) under control of a strong
constitutive promoter. For each biological replicate, 50 mL of LB media (1% tryptone, 0.5%
yeast extract and 1% NaCl) were grown to saturation overnight at 37°C with agitation. Surgical
masks were inoculated with 200 µL of culture that were spread on defined 1” x 1” hydrophobic
(blue side) regions using sterile scoopulas. Masks were allowed to dry for 60 minutes prior to
sterilization.

2.5

Quantifying sterilization efficiency

Inoculated segments were excised from masks using sterile scalpels and placed in sterile 50 mL
conical tubes. Masks were suspended in 10 mL sterile water and agitated via pulse vortex for
10 seconds. Cells were extracted from masks via centrifugation at 4,000 RPM for 10 minutes.
Pelleted cells were resuspended in solution via pulse vortex for 10 seconds. LB agar plates
containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin were inoculated using 200 µL of resuspended cellular
solution. Each mask was used to inoculate three agar plates as technical triplicates. Agar plates
were incubated at 37˚C for 16 hours before green fluorescence imaging using a ChemiDoc MP
imaging system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA).
Sterilization kinetics were modelled as the percent of colony forming units (CFUs)
relative to control values. Control masks we placed on the mask holder with the device powered
off for 16, 32, or 64 minutes. CFUs were counted from fluorescent images using custom
MATLAB scripts (MATLAB 2019b; Mathworks, Natick, MA). Control CFUs were calculated
as the mean of three technical replicates, and time point measurements are presented as the
percent control CFU. Sterilization was modelled as the sum of two exponential decays fit by

- 10 -

non-linear least-squares regression in R. Confidence intervals were calculated using a
parametric bootstrap with 5000 sample draws.

2.6

Mask sterilization and assessment of structural integrity

The effect of the sterilization process on the overall structural integrity of the fibers of the mask
was performed with an optical microscope. A medical mask was analyzed with an optical
microscope before and after 64 min of ozone treatment (the mask was marked in its center with
a sharpie enabling to perform the analysis in a fixed position on the surface of the mask).

Results and Discussion

The power dissipated in the DBD discharge was characterized following the procedure
described by W. Liu et al.14 The applied voltage V was measured directly from the output of the
power supply, while the current flowing through the electrodes was estimated by measuring the
charge Q accumulated on a 20 nF measuring capacitor CM serially connected to the grounded
electrode. The Lissajous figure of the DBD discharge was obtained by plotting the measured
Q-V characteristics (see Figure 4a) and the powder dissipated in the discharge was estimated
from its area S and discharge frequency f using Equation 2 (see Figure 4b).

The reactor starts coupling a measurable amount of power around 4 kV, linearly increasing with
the applied voltage above this threshold (see Figure 4b). Fourier Transform Infrared
Spectroscopic (FTIR) analysis of the gas produced by the DBD discharge corresponds with the
appearance of the typical features of ozone around 4 kV (see Figure 4c). In air fed DBDs O3
production is initiated in the plasma phase by the electron impact dissociation of O2 into atomic

O (see Equation 3). O quickly reacts with O2 molecules to form O3 via three-body collision
(see Equation 4, being M a third-body collision partner).15,16

Other smaller contributions corresponding to NxOy species, such as N2O5 (1250 cm-1 and 1720
cm-1) and NO2 (1600 cm-1 and 1627 cm-1), are observed in the spectra.16 Finally, we observed
a sharp feature around 1360 cm-1. The sharp was found to be an artifact, attributed to the O3induced oxidation of the KBr windows. To demonstrate this, we acquired a series of FTIR over
few minutes after switching off the plasma (Figure 4d). While the ozone contribution disappears
over time, we observe that peak around 1360 cm-1 remained unchanged and is hence not related
to any gaseous species produced by the plasma discharge.

2 min and after 4 min.
The concentration of O3 produced by the DBD discharge as a function of the applied voltage
was measured via UV absorption spectroscopy, as described previously in section 2.3. In the
first set of experiments the plasma was ignited at a given voltage and allowed to stabilize for 4
minutes before acquiring the measurement. Figure 5a shows a linear increase of the gas
concentration above 4 kV, reaching a maximum of 750 ppm approximately at 9kV and slowly
decreasing above this voltage. This effect has been detailed in the work of S. Yagi et al on airfed DBD discharges.17 As the power consumption of the discharge increases, the ozone
- 13 -

production shows a correspondent gradual increase, reaches a maximum and then begins
decreasing. This effect is likely due to the production of NOx in the plasma discharge that
generates catalytic cycles of O3 destruction (see Equation 5 and Equation 6).

Figure 5. a) Ozone concentration as a function of DBD plasma dishcarge voltage. b) Ozone
concentration as a function of time ( maximu sterilization time) for 7 kV applied voltage.

For the following sterilization experiments with the DBD system, we fixed the applied voltage
at 7 kV as we observed increasing plasma instability above this value. The ozone concentration
was measured for 64 for minutes at 7kV, to study the overall stability of the DBD production
process. As depicted in Figure 5b, after roughly 4 min, the quantity of produced O3 slightly
decreases and reaches a stable value.
However, we note a slow concentration increase above 32 minutes, which could be related to
thermal stability of the UV lamp itself after remaining on for a long time. On average, the ozone
production over 64 minutes is around 453±27 ppm.

confidence interval calculated by a parametric bootstrap. Optical microscope image of a
medical mask (b) before and (c) after 64 min of O3 sterlization.
The sterilization efficiency was determined using E. coli incubated surgical masks (Figure 6).
Between 100,000 and 200,000 CFUs were routinely recovered from control masks. CFUs
decreased with increasing exposure time. Notably, the change in CFUs exhibits a biphasic
behavior that could be modelled as the sum of two exponential curves. This implies 2
populations: A fast dying population with a decay constant 1 (see Figure 6a) of 0.99 min-1 and
a mean lifetime of approximately 1 minute, and a slow dying population with a decay constant
2 (see Figure 6a) of 0.05 min-1 and a mean lifetime of approximately 20 minutes. Across all
experiments, we observed a 3:1 ratio (N1:N2, see Figure 6a) between fast and slow dying
populations and we speculate that the slow dying population has reduced ozone exposure due
to fouling from the saturated bacterial culture. This set of experiments indicated that most
- 15 -

bacteria are quickly killed over the first few minutes of the disinfection process, and a complete
sterilization is achieved within 64 min (Figure 6a). Finally, we performed an analysis of the
morphology of the medical mask before and after the sterilization process, to assess any
possible structural damage induced by the O3 treatment (Figure 6b-c) There was no observable
variation of the fiber structure upon sterilization, consistent with the near room temperature
operating conditions this method utilizes.
After verifying the effectiveness of the O3 based sterilization in removing bacteria from
surgical masks, we explored the characteristics of the “portable-version” of the sterilization
apparatus built using the plasma globe toy. The power supply feeds the discharge electrode with
a sawtooth signal with frequency equal to roughly 30 kHz and a peak to peak amplitude of 5.6
kV, corresponding to a discharge power of 2 W (Figure 7a and Figure 7b). Surprisingly, in
this configuration we observe an extremely stable O3 production with average concentration, in
the order of 1000 ppm (Figure 7c and 7d).

Plasma Globe Reactor and (c) corresponding O3 concentration produced by the plasma globe
reactor as a function of time. An average of 1010 ± 5 ppm along the stability period (4 to 32
minutes).
Finally, the sterilization efficiency of the plasma globe device was measured for 32 min
treatment time and compared with the one of the DBD and the more widespread configuration
where the masks is simply placed in a box flooded with O3 (the mask was simply unplugged
from the mask holder and placed in the closed 72 L plastic box containing the plasma reactor;
the DBD was operated at 7 kV with compressed air flow rate of 10 slm). Correspondingly, we
- 17 -

observe a 429% improvement in the sterilization efficiency with respect to the standard
configuration. Results summarized in Figure 8.

Conclusion

We have demonstrated that the efficiency of an ozone sterilization system for facepiece
respirators can be dramatically increased by careful design of the reactor configurations.
Specifically, a flow-through configuration where the ozone is passes directly through the porous
fiber structure of the mask demonstrated superior sterilization kinetics with respect to the
standard approach of an ozone chamber. Finally, we demonstrate the effective use of a portable
single mask sterilization device using low-cost commercially available components (a plasma
ball toy, a plastic box, a quartz tube, some steel mesh, HVAC tape, and few 3D printed parts).
