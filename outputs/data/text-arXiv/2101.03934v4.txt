ABSTRACT
We developed a model and a software package for stochastic simulations of transmission of
COVID-19 and other similar infectious diseases, that takes into account contact network structures and geographical distribution of population density, detailed up to a level of location of
individuals. Our analysis framework includes a surrogate model optimization process for quick
fitting of the model‚Äôs parameters to the observed epidemic curves for cases, hospitalizations
and deaths. This set of instruments (the model, the simulation code, and the optimizer) is a
useful tool for policymakers and epidemic response teams who can use it to forecast epidemic
development scenarios in local environments (on the scale from towns to large countries) and
design optimal response strategies. The simulation code also includes a geospatial visualization
subsystem, presenting detailed views of epidemic scenarios directly on population density maps.
We used the developed framework to draw predictions for COVID-19 spreading in the canton of
Geneva, Switzerland.

INTRODUCTION
Numerous epidemic modeling and simulation toolkits have been developed or adapted for COVID19, ranging from educational models to global-scale comprehensive frameworks [1]. Network
representations are powerful tools that allow us to understand disease transmission in human
populations while taking into account the structure of human interactions, mobility and contact
patterns. Previous studies have paid attention to the influence of various network configura-

tions (scale-free, random, small-world) [2, 3, 4] on the spreading rate and value of the epidemic
threshold. Some models also work with population mobility data, which is especially important
in the context of imposing movement restrictions to reduce transmission [5, 1]. To improve the
accuracy of epidemic models, it is necessary to account for population heterogeneity in terms of,
for example, age, social groups and mobility patterns, as well as geographical clustering of infection spreading that can arise from higher contact rates in places with higher population density.
Examples of models with a detailed representation of these factors include the age structured
household model of Pellis et al. [6] and the two-level (global and local) mixing model proposed
by Ball et al. [7] which has further been expanded to account for network structure [8]. However,
these models do not include distance metrics or account for differences in population density. In
the context of analyzing and predicting the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic, the impact
of various epidemic control and containment measures needs thorough consideration [9]. The importance of the spatial component in epidemic systems is being increasingly recognised. When
models are used to assess spatially heterogeneous interventions, they need to be able to represent
the location of hosts and the spatial pattern of transmission in enough detail. Including the spatial component to epidemic models has previously been seen as a complex technical addition that
should only be considered when absolutely necessary [10]. However, as the software and methods
improve and spatial individual-level data becomes increasingly available, we may expect that the
spatial component will take an increasingly important role in infectious disease modelling tools.
We therefore aimed to develop a geospatial network model, and calibrate it to the COVID-19
data from the canton of Geneva, Switzerland, to test its applicability and validity.
METHODS

General assumptions
We use a standard representation of the population as a network consisting of N nodes (individuals) {i} and a set of links {eij }, representing a contact between each node i and j. We assume
that the number of individuals in the network remains constant during the simulation [2]. In
our case the network is weighted (all links eij have a weight depending on the spatial distance
between the nodes i and j) and complete (i.e. a link eij exists for any pair of nodes i and j).
We represent the infection process in the network with a stochastic SEIR model, so that all
nodes are at any time point in one of the four states: S (susceptible), E (exposed in the latent
period), I (infectious) or R (recovered/removed). Stochastic infection process S ‚Üí E occurs as
a result of contact between a susceptible (i ‚àà S) and infectious (j ‚àà I) individual. Two other
random processes also take place in the network in parallel: the transition of individuals from
the exposed to infectious state E ‚Üí I and the removal process I ‚Üí R. The model assumes two
types of contact events, which we call ‚Äúlocal‚Äù and ‚Äúglobal‚Äù contacts and are distinguished using
the Euclidean distance matrix M = {mij }. Thus, we consider separately contacts that happen
in the neighbourhood of each individual‚Äôs residence, and those that take place during longerdistance mobility. Local contacts are determined by a cutoff r on the distance mij . This cutoff is
the same for all nodes in the network. Global spreading is modelled as a separate process where
each infectious individual can spontaneously transmit the infection to a random target selected
from the entire population. The process is automatically normalized for population density, as
the target will be more likely located in densely populated areas. In our model, the following

parameters affect the contact probability between two nodes:
1. The assignment of the nodes into one of 16 age groups. The frequency of contacts between
the age groups is given as an asymmetric 16x16 matrix A = {aij } [Appendix A].
2. The distance between the nodes. As only relative distances matter in our model, we use
the Euclidean distance between locations on the map. We determine a fixed cutoff distance
to distinguish between local and global contacts.
3. The population density in a particular area. The contact probability for global contacts
directly depends on the population density in the area of the contacting nodes ‚Äì this is
achieved with rejection sampling of global contacts over the entire simulated region.

Epidemic model
We represent the stochastic SEIR model as a continuous time 3-dimensional Markov chain
X = {(S(t), E(t), I(t)) : t ‚â• 0} that tracks the number of susceptible, exposed and infectious individuals at any time point. The number of removed individuals can be calculated as
R(t) = N ‚àí S(t) ‚àí E(t) ‚àí I(t).
The epidemic starts with n0 infectious individuals; the rest of the population is assumed to consist
of fully susceptible individuals; that is, the initial state of X is (S(0), E(0), I(0)) = (N ‚àín0 , 0, n0 ).
In each moment of time the state space of X is described by changing the state of individuals
according to the rules shown in Table 1. All other types of contacts do not change the state of
the system.

Simulation algorithm
To simulate the infection process, we developed and applied a new variant of the event modulated Gillespie algorithm. Our implementation supports multiple epidemic control regimes and
arbitrary functional forms and distributions of epidemic parameters. It can be used to validate
theoretical models and it is particularly suitable for the simulation of epidemic dynamics in large
regions such as entire countries.
The unmodified Gillespie algorithm is specified as follows. Consider N Poisson processes with
the rate of Œªi , i ‚àà [1, N ] running in parallel. We denote the density of the event rate for the
ith process by œÅi (Œªi ). The renewal process is fully characterised by the probability density of
inter-event times, and denoted as œÜi (œÑ ) for the ith process.

For the Poisson process with probability density of the event rate œÅi (Œªi ), we have
Z ‚àû
œài (œÑ ) =
œÅi (Œªi )e‚àíŒªi œÑ dŒª.
0

A Poisson process with rate Œª0 , i.e., œài (œÑ ) = Œª0 e‚àíŒª0 œÑ is generated by œÅi (Œªi ) = Œ¥(Œªi ‚àí Œª0 ), where
Œ¥ is the delta function. In the unmodified Gillespie algorithm applied to epidemic spreading, all
possible state transitions for nodes (S ‚Üí E, E ‚Üí I, I ‚Üí R) are Poisson processes with rates i.
Multiple simultaneous Poisson processes can be merged into a single global Poisson process with
PN
the rate Œõ = i=1 Œªi, where time intervals between events are distributed exponentially with
the geometric mean 1/Œõ ‚Äî and for every event of this process we need to calculate what exactly
is this event, and where it has happened (for that, we have to keep track of all susceptible nodes
that can currently be immediately infected, all exposed nodes that can transition to the infectious
state, and all infectious nodes that can be recovered ‚Äî and sample the probabilities of these
transitions accordingly). The original Gillespie algorithm was first invented to track chemical
reactions and later adapted to model epidemic processes in well-mixed populations, where the
only important output are the counts of entities in each state (e.g. molecules in chemical models,
individuals in epidemic models). However, in network and geospatial models, it is important to
know which node exactly is making the transition, which leads to computational difficulties.
In our event-modulated Gillespie algorithm, we cut off all non-productive (not leading to a change
of states) activations, and use a global event queue (a priority queue, i.e. all events are always
sorted by time) to automatically place all actual state transitions to the appropriate time points
in the future. Therefore, we no longer need to merge all event rates i into the global rate Œõ
but instead work directly with the SEIR parameters Œ≤, , and Œ≥, using them as the rates of the
corresponding Poisson processes and generating exponentially distributed time intervals between
events.
When a node becomes infectious (either from the Exposed state after the incubation period, or
by being one of the initially infected patients), the infection sequence starts. First, we sample the
time interval until removal (recovery or death) as ‚àí ln(U )/Œ≥, where U is a random value sampled
from the uniform distribution [0..1], and place a removal event in the priority queue. Then, we
generate exposure events and their time offsets, continuing as long as the sum of time intervals
between these events is less than the time from becoming infectious to the removal event. The
exposure process is described as follows.
We first determine whether the exposure event will be local or global, the probability of a global
transmission being q, and the probability of a local transmission 1 ‚àí q. We then sample an age
group for the target node from the discrete distribution taken from a row of the contact matrix
corresponding to the source node‚Äôs age group. If the exposed contact is local, we select randomly
a node j that is located within the Euclidean distance m ‚â§ r from the index node i and has
an age group equal to the age group we sampled in the previous step. If the exposed contact
is global, we select randomly any node j over the entire simulated geographical region using
rejection sampling (by generating random uniformly sampled Euclidean coordinates with 10m
precision until we have a location that contains a node from the chosen age group), so that the

target node is selected according to the population density distribution. Then, we sample the
time offset for this exposure event as ‚àíln(U )/Œ≤. If the time of the exposure is still less than the
time of the recovery, we place the event in the queue and move on to the next exposure event
If the exposure event is already beyond the removal time, we cancel the last exposure event and
stop the process.
The algorithm itself is outlined in (Algorithm 1), adapted from Kiss et al. [11].

Simulation running
The main simulation code is written in C++ (C++17), using the GDAL library for geospatial transformations and manipulations, and the nanof lann k-d tree implementation for radius
queries. The population density map from the Global Human Settlement Layer dataset is loaded
as a 2D array, with areas inside and outside the border marked separately. The state of the
simulation is exported into an output log each day of the simulation as current SEIR counts, and
as a PNG file representing the current state of population on the density map where susceptible individuals are represented by grey pixels, exposed ‚Äî by orange pixels, infected ‚Äî by red
pixels, and removed ‚Äî by green pixels. Localized infection clusters in the simulation, as well as
directions of infection spreading, are therefore clearly visible.
We run a set of 100 simulations, each simulation starting with the same initial condition, in which
a set of randomly chosen nodes are infected and all the other N ‚àí n0 nodes are susceptible (in
this particular configuration, n0 = 2). We measure the percentage of recovered nodes at the end
of the simulation (final size), and use the mean estimator from Seaborn [12] with ¬±1œÉ interval,
to display the data from multiple simulations conveniently. The counts of nodes at different
states can be aggregated and transformed into different indicators to be displayed as stochastic
epidemic curves.
The distance matrix M is constructed using information about population density for each
simulated region, obtained from the ESM2015 dataset [13]. The age-dependent contact matrix A
is obtained from the work of Kiesha Prem et al [14], which extended the results of the POLYMOD
project [15] to 152 countries.

Surrogate model optimization
To provide the initial epidemic parameters for the full simulation, we use surrogate model optimization. We fit a stochastic SEIR model assuming homogeneous contact network to match the
observed data on COVID-19 cases in Switzerland, provided by ETH Zurich [16].
We wrote an adapter function for running the surrogate model and exporting the simulation
results, and compared the results with the actual observed number of hospitalizations for the
selected geographical region. Then we run a nonlinear least squares optimization routine curve_fit from scikit-optimize Python package, which works with arbitrary model functions.
After the fitting, the determined parameter values are used as inputs to the simulation of the
main model, leaving only the local infection distance threshold r and the proportion of global
contacts among all contacts as free parameters.
In the first stage of the fitting procedure, we fix the  and Œ≥ values of the SEIR model (inverse
incubation period and inverse infectiousness period, as these are not changing) as X and Y ,
respectively, and assume that Œ≤ (infectiousness rate) is changing stepwise over time due to the
different epidemic control regimes. We assumed that the first infections were introduced between
January 15th and February 25th: the first case was officially registered in the canton of Geneva on
February 25th, but the infection was likely already spreading at that time. The epidemic control

regime was assumed to have changed five times: around March 18th when the first lockdown was
introduced, around May 25th when it was lifted, during the the second lockdown in the canton of
Geneva (which started November 1st and ended November 29th), and during the second federal
lockdown (which started January 18th 2021, currently ongoing as of 19th February 2021).
The following parameters were fitted:
1. tk ‚Äî the regime change dates. Some of the regime change points (the date of introduction
of the new pandemic response policies) are known, but it still makes sense to consider them
as free parameters: if the optimizer finds a regime change date completely on its own, from
data only, it is a part of verification that the model and the optimizer work correctly.
2. Œ≤k ‚Äî infection spreading rates for each time interval (Œ≤0 bounded from initial estimations
of R0 ).
3. q ‚Äî the assumed proportion of the infected population who were hospitalized.
The bounds are shown in Table 2.
The fitting routine consists of solving the optimisation problem of finding the minimum of the
function:
N
X
F (Œ∏) =
œÅ(fi (Œ∏)2 ),
i=1

where Œ∏ = (Œ∏1 , ..., Œ∏r ) is a set of parameters which we want to estimate, N is the number of
available data points, œÅ is a loss function to reduce the influence of outliers, fi (Œ∏) is the i-th
component of the vector of residuals (in this particular simulation, we are fitting for the number
of hospitalizations, as the most objective and readily available statistics, assuming that the
proportion of hospitalized patients always stays the same for each age group, at least within the
region under consideration).
Given a model function m(t; Œ∏) and some data points D = {(tI , DI |i = 1, .., N } we defined
the vector of residuals as the difference between the model prediction and the data, that is
Fi (Œ∏) = m(ti ; Œ∏) ‚àí di .
We compared the simulation outputs against the real world observation from the COVID-19
clinical dataset, provided by the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health [16]. The epidemic parameters obtained in the fitting step were submitted to the main simulation code, which was then
run 100 times independently. The initial mean contact radius r for the local transmission mode
was set to 500 meters, as adapted from [17], and modified over time between 50m and 500 m according to changes in mobility as described in [18]. Proportions of global contacts were adapted
from the same study to range between 0.01% and 1.00%, in line with mobility data. We used
the number of hospitalizations as a reference output for comparison purposes. We considered
hospitalizations to be a subclass of R (removed) compartment, as hospitalized patients normally
do not infect anybody else. The proportions of infected individuals in each age group assumed

to be hospitalized are shown in Fig.3. Additionally, we compared the cumulative percentage
of recovered patients in the simulation with the numbers obtained from seroprevalence studies
performed in the canton of Geneva [19].
The set of epidemic parameters obtained in the surrogate model is shown in Table 2. The
simulation reproduced the initial epidemic wave of COVID-19 that happened in March-April
2020 (Fig. 2, 3). The simulated number of recovered cases is consistent with seroprevalence
measurements performed in the canton of Geneva in April-May 2020 and November-December
2020 (Fig. 4).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
We developed a flexible network simulation model for COVID-19 and tested it successfully with
data from the canton of Geneva, Switzerland. Our system allows us not only to track and
predict the epidemic progression, but also to simulate and evaluate various measures introduced
to contain the spread of infection, such as limiting mobility and partial or complete lockdown.
The simulation software also makes it possible to model the effectiveness of vaccination and to
choose which population groups (based on age or location) should be prioritized in vaccination
to accelerate the development of population immunity.
As epidemic response organizations often have limited resources, optimal resource allocation
is crucial for developing the most efficient interventions. This includes determining the most
vulnerable population groups, to identify epidemic hotspots, and to determine the most impactful
dates and locations for introducing non-pharmaceutical interventions. Models without spatial
dimension have limited ability to answer some questions about intervention effectiveness and
resource allocation [8, 10]. Our framework employs age-based contact matrices to account for
differences in social networks and contact patterns of people within different age groups; it uses
detailed population density maps to predict (and visualize) geographical locations of epidemic
hotspot clusters, and it employs a robust optimization system to adapt itself for real observations
and medical statistics available for the chosen simulation area, enabling operators to choose most
impactful response options.
Our approach also has some limitations. Full representation of the population on the level of in-

dividuals is computationally much more expensive than traditional compartmental models; while
the computational resources required are still modest compared to many problems in computational physics, it makes continuous experiments and parameters optimization time-consuming
and often impractical. Our approach requires some non-standard parameters which are hard to
calculate from the observed data (such as the proportion of ‚Äúlocally‚Äù transmitted infections).
The addition of some new features that could further improve the simulation and the underlying
model. Among these are accounting for seasonality, marking up the geographical representation
with zoning (e.g. commercial, residential, business or recreational zones, with corresponding
differences in mobility patterns); or accounting for travel across the external borders of the
simulated setting (which could be represented as spontaneously generated new infection events).
Adding these features, however, constitute the risk of propelling the model well beyond analytical
tractability, and reduce it to an empirical numerical simulation limiting our ability to extract
novel theoretical results. Additional research is required to prioritize the approaches for the
greatest robustness and practical utility.
Thus, despite the fact that this model is computationally more expensive than traditional compartmental models and requires some unconventional parameters, our approach can bring more
fidelity in the simulation results. This model provides an efficient way to take into account the
age and geographical structure and mobility, without resorting to even more computationally
intensive direct simulations of people movement.
