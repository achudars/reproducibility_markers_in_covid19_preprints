Abstract
We study observed incidence of self-disclosure in a large
dataset of Tweets representing user-led English-language
conversation about the Coronavirus pandemic. Using an unsupervised approach to detect voluntary disclosure of personal information, we provide early evidence that situational factors surrounding the Coronavirus pandemic may impact individuals’ privacy calculus. Text analyses reveal topical shift toward supportiveness and support-seeking in selfdisclosing conversation on Twitter. We run a comparable
analysis of Tweets from Hurricane Harvey to provide context for observed effects and suggest opportunities for further
study.

Introduction

At the time of writing, one-third of the world’s population is
directly impacted by restrictions on movement and activity,
aimed at slowing the Coronavirus pandemic. All fifty states
of the U.S. have issued guidelines on permissible travel outside the home, limitations on public gatherings, and business
closures. Experts suggest that some of these measures may
continue for 18 months or more.
Unsurprisingly, there has been an unprecedented surge in
online activity (James 2020). Much of the increased traffic
extends beyond typical Internet surfing and video streaming, as people find ways to leverage online resources to stay
connected with one another, personally and professionally.
Video-conferencing and social media usage are soaring as
people turn to these platforms to support routine social activities (Reuters 2020; Iyengar 2020).
It is to be expected that the expanded breadth and depth
of online activity will magnify privacy risks for individual
users. In addition to simply spending more time online, the
emergence of virtual play dates and book clubs suggests that
during this time of social distancing, people are looking for
ways to stay close (e.g., ”apart but together”). This may be
particularly the case for the many individuals facing heightened anxiety, stress and depression due to social isolation,
grief, financial insecurity, and of course health-related fears
of the virus itself (Association 2020; Braverman 2020).
The literature on social communication suggests that interpersonal connectedness and relationship development is

fundamentally facilitated through iterative self-disclosure
(Altman and Taylor 1973), that is, intentionally revealing
personal information such as personal motives, desires, feelings, thoughts, and experiences to others (Derlaga and Berg
1987). In fact, there is a robust literature on (routine) selfdisclosure in online social media outside the particular domain of crisis (Bak, Lin, and Oh 2014; Joinson and Paine
2007; Nguyen, Bin, and Campbell 2012; Houghton and
Joinson 2012; Attrill and Jalil 2011). Research indicates that
as users engage in discussion online, they leverage selfdisclosure as a way to enhance immediate social rewards
(Hallam and Zanella 2017), increase legitimacy and likeability (Bak, Kim, and Oh 2012), and derive social support (Tidwell and Walther 2002). Despite the “upsides”, i.e.,
socially adaptive motivations for disclosure, we know that
self-privacy violations can come at a cost, leaving users exposed to identity theft, cyber fraud and other crimes (Hasan
et al. 2013), discrimination in job searches, credit and visa
applications (McGregor, Murray, and Ng 2018), harassment
and bullying (Peluchette et al. 2015). Indeed, studies have
repeatedly shown that an overwhelming majority of users
have privacy concerns about their online interactions (Smith,
Dinev, and Xu 2011). These concerns evolve over time, tied
to the day’s events and the longer arc of shifting norms (Acquisti, Brandimarte, and Loewenstein 2015; Adjerid, Peer,
and Acquisti 2016).
Little is known about the evolution of users’ sharing practices during crisis. We know that victims of Hurricane Harvey sought assistance through social media, in some cases
revealing their full names and addresses online (Seetharaman and Wells 2017). However, what we are witnessing in
the case of the Coronavirus pandemic is distinct from previous crises in important ways. COVID-19 is a global, relatively protracted acute threat. Unlike natural disasters or
military engagements, the pandemic has left communication
infrastructure intact. Digital outlets have become lifelines.
We posit that self-privacy violations during the Coronavirus
pandemic can help individuals feel more socially connected
during a time of anxiety and physical distance, even though
the long term impact of these disclosures is unknown.
In this work, we carry out analysis of instances of selfdisclosure in a dataset of 53,557,975 Tweets representing
conversations on Coronavirus-related topics. We leverage an
unsupervised method for identifying and labeling voluntar-

ily disclosed personal information, both subjective and objective in nature. Our main finding reveals a steep increase
in instances of self-disclosure, particularly related to users’
emotional state and personal experience of the crisis. To our
knowledge, this work is the first to study self-disclosure on
social media during the Coronavirus pandemic. We run comparative analyses on a dataset of Tweets representing conversations about Hurricane Harvey in late summer 2017.
The Harvey study provides valuable context for these unprecedented times, suggesting similarities and differences
that better inform our observations during the current crisis
and the privacy and crisis literatures in general.

Related work

Research in the space of online interactions has sought to
understand the actualization of self-disclosure in digitallymediated social communication. Studies suggest that disclosure behaviors in online environments may be meaningfully
different than their offline counterparts, e.g., anonymity and
lack of nonverbal cues afforded by social media may encourage greater disclosure of sensitive information (Forest and
Wood 2012; Joinson 2001). Similar findings are reported in
(Ma, Hancock, and Naaman 2016), where authors explore
the impact of content intimacy on self-disclosure. It is wellestablished for face-to-face communication that people disclose less as content intimacy increases, but this effect seems
to be weakened in online interactions.
Recent work has positioned online self-disclosure as
strategic behavior targeting social connectedness, selfexpression, relationship development, identity clarification
and social control (Abramova et al. 2017; Bazarova and Choi
2014; Choudhury and De 2014). Voluntary disclosure of personal information has been associated with improved wellbeing, meaningfully related to increased informational and
emotional support (Huang 2016).
There are, however, potential costs to users’ privacy, including the unforeseen use and sharing of disclosed data.
Early work by Acquisti and Gross (Acquisti and Gross 2006)
suggested that social network users were neither fully aware
nor responsive to privacy risks. Over time, studies have captured a shift toward increased privacy awareness (Johnson,
Egelman, and Bellovin 2012; Vitak and Kim 2014), but there
remains great variability in information sharing behaviors
amongst individuals and across platforms (Zhao, Lampe,
and Ellison 2016). It has been shown that culture plays a
role in disclosure decisions (Zhao, Hinds, and Gao 2012;
Krasnova, Veltri, and Günther 2012; Trepte et al. 2017),
as does gender (Sun et al. 2015) and socioeconomic status
(SES) (Marwick, Fontaine, and Boyd 2017). Overarchingly,
the cost-benefit analyses underlying an individual’s decision
to share in the presence of privacy risk is postulated by social exchange theory (Emerson 1976) and re-framed in the
context of online social networks as the so-called privacy
calculus (Krasnova et al. 2010; Dienlin and Metzger 2016).
Critically, work in a number of domains suggests that
contextual and situational factors, e.g., trust, anonymity, financial incentives, are embedded within the privacy calculus (Joinson and Paine 2012; Hann et al. 2007; Li, Sarathy,
and Xu 2010). Amongst these factors, emotion has also

been suggested to play a meaningful role in privacy behaviors (Laufer and Wolfe 1977; Berendt, Günther, and
Spiekermann 2005; Li et al. 2017). This finding is in
keeping with the general theory of feeling-as-information
(Petty, DeSteno, and Rucker 2001), whereby emotions serve
as information cues directly invoking adaptive behaviors
(Lazarus and Lazarus 1991). Studies linking emotion to disclosure online have thus far limited scope to considering the
emotional impact of a particular website. The ways in which
an individual’s mood and general emotional state impact individual privacy calculus are unknown.
To our knowledge, there is no literature examining
changes to patterns of self-disclosure in crisis through the
lens of privacy risk. The crisis community is interested in
the related but fundamentally distinct problem of mining
self-disclosed information for the purposes of identifying
and deploying assistance and relief to impacted individuals
and communities (see (Muniz-Rodriguez et al. 2020) for review).
This work also dovetails with the literature on detection
and tagging of self-disclosure in text, e.g., (Caliskan Islam,
Walsh, and Greenstadt 2014; Wang, Burke, and Kraut 2016;
Vasalou et al. 2011; Bak, Lin, and Oh 2014; Chow, Golle,
and Staddon 2008; Choi et al. 2013). Chow et. al. (Chow,
Golle, and Staddon 2008) developed an association rulesbased inference model that identified sensitive keywords
which could be used to infer a private topic. Similarly, multiple studies utilized pattern or rule based methods to detect specific types of disclosures (Vasalou et al. 2011; Umar,
Squicciarini, and Rajtmajer 2019).
Past work has attempted to classify self-disclosure by
levels, or degree of disclosure. Caliskan et.al (Caliskan Islam, Walsh, and Greenstadt 2014) used AdaBoost with
Naive Bayes classifier to detect privacy scores for Twitter
users’ timelines. Bak et.al. (Bak, Lin, and Oh 2014) applied
modified Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic models
for semi-supervised classification of Twitter conversations
into three self-disclosure levels: general, medium and high.
Wang et. al. (Wang, Burke, and Kraut 2016) used regression models with extensive feature sets to detect degree of
self-disclosure. Because the notion of sensitive information
is based on user perception and context, studies on detection of self-disclosure levels are often difficult to generalize
beyond their original context.

Primary dataset

Our primary dataset is a repository of Tweet IDs corresponding to content posted on Twitter related to the Coronavirus
pandemic (Chen, Lerman, and Ferrara 2020). At the time
of writing, the repository contains 508,088,777 Tweet IDs
for the period of activity from January 21, 2020 through
August 28, 2020. Tweets were compiled utilizing a combination of Twitter’s Search API (for activity January 21
through January 28) and Streaming API (for activity January
28 through July 31). The repository represents topicallyrelevant Tweets across the platform, canvassed based on designated keywords, as well as the full activity of selected accounts (See Tables 1, 2). Around June 6th, the repository

collection infrastructure transitioned to Amazon Web Services which generated a significant increase in Tweet ID
volume. No search parameters were adjusted or data gaps
presented because of the transition; therefore, we analyzed
the entirety of the dataset in a consistent manner. In analyses that follow, we focused our scope to highlight an important transitional period in the pandemic for most users in
the United States by considering two sub-periods – prior to
and after March 11th, the date of the World Health Organization’s pandemic declaration and just two days preceding
U.S. President Trump’s declared national emergency.
Text and metadata corresponding to these 508,088,777
Tweet IDs were obtained through rehydration using the
Twarc1 Python library. Of the IDs passed for rehydration,
461,259,923 were successfully rehydrated. The 9.21% loss
represents deleted content, therefore irretrievable through
Twitter’s API.
For the purpose of measuring and studying selfdisclosure, we filtered the corpus to capture Tweets that represent original content posted by individual users. Specifically, we removed quoted Tweets, retweets,2 as well as all
Tweets associated with verified accounts and the specific organizational accounts listed in Table 2. We narrowed our
analysis to English-language content in order to reduce situational heterogenity and maintain confidence in our labeling approach, which has been developed and validated on
English-language text. The resulting corpus, which forms
the basis of our analyses, consists of 53,557,975 unique
Tweets.

Automated detection of self-disclosure

We use an unsupervised method (Umar, Squicciarini, and
Rajtmajer 2019) to detect instances of self-disclosure in our
dataset. Consistent with the literature on detection of selfdisclosure in text (see, e.g., (Bak, Lin, and Oh 2014; Choudhury and De 2014; Houghton and Joinson 2012; Wang,
Burke, and Kraut 2016)), we consider the presence of firstperson pronouns. Specifically, we consider sentences containing self-reference as the subject, a category-related verb
and associated named entity. Consider the example of location self-disclosure shown in Figure 1. A first person pronoun “I” is the self-referent subject of the sentence. It is used
with a location-related verb “live” in the vicinity of the associated location entity “Pennsylvania”. Notably, subjective
categories of self-disclosure such as interests and feelings do
not have associated named entities. These are differentiated
through rule-based schemas based on subject-verb pairs.
The approach described is implemented in three phases: 1)
subject, verb and object triplet extraction with awareness to
voice (active or passive) in the sentence; 2) named entity
recognition; 3) rule-based matching to established dictionaries. Our dictionaries are adopted from (Umar, Squicciarini,
and Rajtmajer 2019).

Retweets were identified through the existence of the “retweetedstatus” field in the Tweet object returned by the API. Tweets
beginning with the string ’RT @’ were also treated as retweeted
records.

As the proposed approach is based on sentence structure
and syntactic resources (subject, verb, object and entities),
it can be applied to any textual content. However, we acknowledge that Tweets present unique characteristics. Due
to character limits and consequent emerging norms of the
platform, users more frequently engage acronyms and abbreviations (Han and Baldwin 2011). Relatedly, sentence
structure and syntax are noisier when compared to more
verbose platforms (Boot et al. 2019). User mentions, hashtags, and graphic symbols are embedded within text. Considering these differences, we pre-processed Tweets as follows. All Unicode encoding errors were corrected. We removed markers associated with retweets (e.g., “RT”) and
filtered user mentions and hashtags. Additionally, symbols
like “&” and “$” were replaced with their respective word
representations. Email addresses and phone numbers were
replaced with placeholders “emailid” and “phonenumber”,
while URLs were filtered. We also replaced contractions in
the Tweets like “I’m” to “I am” and corrected incorrect use
of spacing between words. These pre-processing steps enabled cleaner input to the detection algorithm.
We validated our approach on a baseline dataset of 3,708
annotated Tweets (Caliskan Islam, Walsh, and Greenstadt
2014). The dataset was manually labelled for presence or
absence of self-disclosed personal information such as location, medical information, demographic information and
so on. For our purposes, category-specific labels of selfdisclosure were binarized, resulting in a total of 3,188 selfdisclosing and 520 non-self-disclosing Tweets. Using the
unsupervised method described, we classified the baseline
data and compared against the binarized manual labels.
Our approach demonstrated acceptable performance yielding precision, recall and F scores of 92.5%, 50.3% and
65.1% respectively. Recall is lower than reported in (Umar,
Squicciarini, and Rajtmajer 2019), attributable to differences
between the taxonomy used to manually label the baseline
Twitter dataset and the taxonomy used to create the unsupervised detection method (e.g., our unsupervised approach
was not developed to detect categories like drug use and personal attacks, whereas these categories were explicitly offered to manual labelers).

Topic modeling

Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei, Ng, and Jordan
2003) was used for topic modeling of Tweets in our dataset.
In this approach, each document (a single Tweet) in the corpus (set of Tweets) is considered to be generated as a mixture
of latent topics and each topic is a distribution over words.
For a document, each word is assigned topics according to a

Dirichlet distribution. Iteratively cycling through each word
in each document and all documents in the corpus, topic
assignments are updated based on the prevalence of words
across topics and the prevalence of topics in the document.
Based on this process, final topic distributions for documents
and word distributions for topics are generated.
In addition to the cleaning steps described in Section 4,
we pre-processed Tweets using tokenization, conversion to
lower case, lemmatization and removal of punctuation and
stopwords. Topics were generated from the resulting corpora
using the LDA model within the Gensim Python library.3
We ran topic analyses over subsets of interest within the
complete Coronavirus dataset. Namely, we explored unique
topic models for Tweets in two time windows pre- and postMarch 11 (January 21 - March 11; March 12 - May 15), and
compared topical themes between Tweets with presence or
absence of detected instances of self-disclosure over the entirety of this subset. To better understand disclosure trends
presented post-March 11, we also generated topic models
over one month windows for the remainder of the Coronavirus dataset: May 16 through June 15, June 16 through
July 15, and July 16 through August 15.

Findings

Of the 53,557,975 Coronavirus-related Tweets analyzed, approximately 19.07% (10,215,752 Tweets) contain elements
of self-disclosure. Looking more closely at daily variance
from January until June, we identified a significant transition
point in activity around March 11, 2020, as shown in Figure
2. The significance of the behavioral change is supported by
overlaying 7-day and 30-day simple moving averages which
smooth day-to-day variance by taking the average disclosure
percentage value over the given time window.
In the period January 21 through March 11, the average
daily percentage of self-disclosing Tweets is 14.63%; from
March 12 through May 15, the average daily percentage is
18.89%. This change in activity coincides with an escalation in severity and increased global awareness of the crisis, with the World Health Organization (WHO) officially
classifying Coronavirus as a pandemic (March 11). Current
events coincident with observed changes in the rate of selfdisclosure are noted on March 13 and March 19 when the
United States officially declared a national state of emergency, and when the governor of California issued the first
statewide ‘stay-at-home’ order, respectively. Self-disclosure
activity remains high for the remainder of the dataset with an
average daily percentage of 19.79% from May 16 through

August 28. These observations suggest that situational context, in particular during crisis, may meaningfully influence
short- and long-term disclosure behaviors.
We further examined messaging around the the Coronavirus pandemic through topic modeling, as outlined in
Section 5. As discussed, self-disclosing behaviors increased
steeply around March 11th, and interesting distinctions are
noticeable in the topical breakdown comparing the periods
just before (January 21 - March 11) and after (March 12 May 15) this date of interest, as reported in Figure 3. Leading up to March 11th (Figure 3a), self-disclosing conversation focused on general information (Topic 1) and sentimental impacts (Topic 3) represented 20% and 24% of all
Tweets, respectively. After March 11 (Figure 3b), terms related to global and sentimental aspects of the crisis remain
present (Topic 3, Topic 2) but prominent conversations also
shift to managing the spread of the virus (Topic 1, Topic 4)
and discussions about needs, help, thanks and support (Topic
5, Topic 6). In fact, Topics 2 and 4 together make up the
majority of the Tweets in that period, representing 23% and
24% of activity, respectively. This represents a shift from
outward-looking to self-centric messaging as well as early
evidence of emotional support and support seeking through
disclosure.
Centered on the mid-March increase in disclosure behaviors, we also compare topical variance between disclosing
and non-disclosing Coronavirus-related Tweets for entirety
of the aforementioned subsetted time window (January 21
- May 15; see Figure 4). Generally, extracted topics reflect
terminology pervasive in mainstream media at the onset of
the crisis, including but not limited to expected impacts of
COVID-19 (health, market, lockdown, quarantine), recommendations (stay home, mask, cancel, school), and political

impact (Trump, administration, democrat). There is no noticeable distinction between topics extracted from the subset
of Tweets containing self-disclosure and those without.
We also analyzed monthly subsets within the remaining
timeline of our dataset, May 15 through August 15 (Figure
5), where the proportion of self-disclosing conversations remains elevated, and in fact, continues to gradually increase
higher over time. The observed sustained higher rate of selfdisclosure through the summer is particularly interesting.
We speculate that users may have recalibrated their own
sharing practices during the pandemic, and that this recalibration may represent a longer-term effect. Consistent with
preceding time windows were themes of support seeking and
political opinion. We observe the introduction of new themes
related to social movements and education, while, discussions surrounding daily life (working/staying home) become
the most prominent topic representing 38% and 41% of all
self-disclosing Tweets in the final two months of the collection. This again suggests a possible transition from discussions of anxiety and need to potentially coping with lifestyle
changes and establishing a new normal.

Comparative analysis

For context, we compared observed self-disclosure during
the Coronavirus pandemic to observed self-disclosure during Hurricane Harvey (2017). Although hurricanes are an
annual expectation, the landfall duration and subsequent impact of Hurricane Harvey created a crisis throughout communities in the South Central region of the United States.
This overwhelmed traditional emergency response infras-

tructure and affected citizens took to social media to seek
emergency assistance (Sebastian et al. 2017; Smith et al.
2018).
We consider a collection of 6,732,546 Tweet IDs representing posted content inclusive of keywords “Hurricane
Harvey”, “Harvey”, and/or “HurricaneHarvey” during the
12-day period August 25, when Harvey first made landfall, through September 5, 2017 (Alam et al. 2018). Similar
to the Coronavirus dataset, we passed the set of Hurricane
Harvey-related Tweet IDs through the Hydrator Tweet Retrieval Tool (v2.0)4 , a sister desktop application to Twarc.
We experienced a 33% loss during data reconstitution (compare to 9.21% loss in the Coronavirus-related dataset), attributable to Tweet and account deletion during the nearly 3
years which have passed. We filtered the resulting 4,379,462
Tweets for original content in the same fashion as we handled the Coronavirus data – removing all quoted Tweets,
retweets, content from verified accounts, and non-English
content as identified by Twitter. The resulting 551,061
Tweets were passed through pre-processing and unsupervised labeling to detect instances of self-disclosure, and
through topic analysis as detailed in Sections 4 and 5.
Across all 551,061 Tweets in this subset, we observed an
average 9% self-disclosure rate (49,595 Tweets) over the 12day collection period – substantially lower than the 19.07%
observed in the Coronavirus-related dataset. Several factors
might account for the difference. The current pandemic has
been marked by efforts to maintain social distance and, we
have proposed, increased levels of disclosure may be related

to relationship-building with online cohorts. But what we
may also be seeing is a reflection of a general trend toward
greater self-disclosure in online social media over the course
of nearly three years separating the two events.
With respect to topical focus, we see important parallels
between the two crises. As illustrated in Figure 6a, selfdisclosing Tweets revealed emotional messaging centered
on seeking immediate spiritual, physical, and monetary support (Topics 1, 2, 3, 4, 6) with top terms including “red
cross”, “raise money”, “donation”, “relief”, and “prayer”.
While present, these themes are less prominent in the nonself-disclosing data. This finding across both datasets suggests that support-seeking during crisis might be a driver of
self-disclosure and play a meaningful role in users’ sharing
practices.
Also mirroring the Coronavirus dataset, we observe one
self-disclosing topic representing politically-motivated conversation (Topic 5). While there is topical overlap between
the two classes of Harvey-related Tweets, non-disclosing
Tweets (Figure 6b) presented a focus on contextual information related to the crisis with relevant keywords “flood”,
“Texas”, and “Houston” (Topic 4).

Discussion

Perhaps the most striking observation in the analyses we
have described is early evidence of heightened and sustained levels of self-disclosure during the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic, as compared to observed disclosure during
Hurricane Harvey. This global crisis is unprecedented in a
number of ways, one being the scale and scope of human in-

teraction through social media. Concerns about privacy have
been at the center of discussion in popular press (see, e.g,
(Servick 2020; Cellan-Jones 2020; Lin and Martin 2020)),
but most of this conversation has been about privacy tradeoffs related to cellphone tracking and similar approaches
to location surveillance and individual health monitoring in
service to public health. Many are willing to sacrifice some
privacy in hopes of stemming the spread of the disease and
helping to accelerate the return to normalcy; others are not.
Scholarly work has begun to propose “privacy first” decentralized approaches for COVID-related tracking and notification (see, e.g., (PAC 2020; Cov 2020; DP3 2020)).
We aim, with this work, to engage the research community in the work of better understanding more subtle, voluntary self-privacy violations emergent in the Coronavirus
pandemic and in crisis more generally. We know that, during Hurricane Harvey, individuals took to social media in
search of immediate aid. Today, individuals are leaning on
their online social communities for ongoing engagement and
support. Isolation, economic uncertainty, and health-related
anxiety pose serious threat to mental health and well-being
(Holmes et al. 2020; of Medical Sciences UK 2020), but the
potential manifestations of psychological impact in the domain of voluntary self-disclosure are unknown. The existing literature hints at the role of mood and emotion in the
privacy calculus, but these relationships have not be wellestablished. Our analyses suggest that the current pandemic
and its effects may impact self-disclosure behaviors. An
open question is whether these heightened oversharing practices will become a new norm, or whether they fade over
time and we will ultimately return to pre-COVID baselines.
If heightened self-disclosure sustains beyond this crisis, we
might look to social theory for explanations. Threshold models of collective behavior (see, e.g., (Granovetter 1978; Centola et al. 2018; Wiedermann et al. 2020)) may offer insights.
As the crisis continues to unfold in the next several months,
we suggest that additional work should aim to further develop, refine and test these hypotheses.
