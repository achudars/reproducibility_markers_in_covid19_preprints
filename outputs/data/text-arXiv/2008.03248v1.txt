Abstract This work constructs, analyzes, and simulates a new SEIR-type
model for the dynamics and potential control of the current coronavirus (COVID19) pandemic. It has a compartmental structure and a differential inclusion
for a variable infection rate. The novelty in this work is three-fold. First, the
population is separated, according to compliance with the disease control directives (shelter-in-place, masks/face coverings, physical distancing, etc.), into
those who fully follow the directives and those who only partially comply with
the directives or are necessarily mobile. This allows the assessment of the
overall effectiveness of the control measures and the impact of their relaxing
or tightening on the disease spread. Second, the model treats the infection
rate as an unknown and keeps track of how it changes, due to virus mutations
and saturation effects, via a differential inclusion. Third, by introducing randomness to some of the system coefficients, we study the models sensitivity
to these parameters and provide bounds and intervals of confidence for the
model simulations. As a case study, the pandemic outbreak in South Korea
is simulated. The model parameters were found by minimizing the deviation
of the model prediction from the reported data. The simulations show that
the model captures the pandemic dynamics in South Korea accurately, which
provides confidence in the model predictions and its future use.

1 Introduction
The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 emerged in December 2019 as a mutation of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus, SARS-CoV. The
first group of COVID-19 patients, reported in Wuhan, China, exhibited flulike symptoms and the serious cases involved pneumonia. There is mounting
evidence [24] that the virus affects blood vessels which may cause long term
health issues. Currently, this very contagious disease affects almost all parts of
the world. Indeed, it can be found in over 200 countries and territories [24,27].
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on 11
March 2020, and it has caused large scale closing of borders and lock-down of
countries, states, regions, cities, and communities, as well as schools and universities. In the world, there are over 14 million confirmed cases, over 600, 000
deaths and over eight million recovered [27]. Thus, the number of COVID-19
infected by far exceeds those infected by SARS or the Middle East Respiratory
Syndrome (MERS). The SARS-CoV-2 virus is transmitted human-to-human
mainly via fluid droplets, especially among those who are in close contact,
and also by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus. Transmission from
infected patients to healthcare personnel has been often observed.
Because of the global impact of the pandemic, researchers all around the
world have been engaged in mathematical and statistical modeling of the
various aspects of the disease dynamics, especially predictions of global and
national trends, as well as specific regional predictions of the virus spread.
These are meant to help policymakers with hospital and emergency services
preparedness and utilization; national and regional policy decisions; business
plans; implementation, relaxation and evaluation of various control measures;
and scientists with understanding the disease dynamics. These efforts are reflected in the exponentially growing list of relevant publications that can be
found in several places, such as [24, 25, 27], and many recent publications such
as [5, 8–10, 14].
In this work, we construct a new model for the COVID-19 pandemic to
help researchers and policymakers evaluate the effects and effectiveness of various intervention and mitigation strategies, in real-time. In particular, it includes a new parameter θ ∈ [0, 1], which may vary in time, that measures
the compliance of the population to mitigation and control measures such
as shelter-in-place (restricted mobility), wearing masks/facial coverings and
physical distancing in public places. It allows us to study the effects of these
control measures and the possible impact of relaxing or tightening them on the
spread of the disease. A related parameter in a simpler model was introduced
in [5], where the focus was on the size of the asymptomatic population.

The second novelty in our model is that the infectiveness or the contact
parameter β is considered as one of the dependent variables instead of a fixed
constant, or even a prescribed function, and since it has a restricted range
(because it is related to the contact probability), it is described by a differential
inclusion. We decided to use this approach because there are indications that
the contagion or infectivity of the virus is changing as the pandemic evolves.
This makes the model more accurate but mathematically more complex.
A third novelty is the introduction of randomness into some of the model
parameters. This allows us to understand the sensitivity of the model to certain
parameters while providing intervals of confidence for the simulations. If the
system is very sensitive to a parameter so that small changes in its value lead
to large changes in the solution, it is crucial to get a precise value for it.
Otherwise, an approximate value may be sufficient.
The model in this work is based on the ideas underlying the MERS model
introduced in [1–3]. However, our preliminary simulations using the MERS
model for the COVID-19 pandemic produced unsatisfactory results. We suspected that the reason was the government-mandated control measures and
how well the population complied with them. Therefore, we decided to make
a distinction between those who follow the shelter-in-place directives, wear
masks when they need to be in public places, keep an appropriate distance
and frequently wash hands and/or use disinfectants, and those who do not or
only partially do these, as well as some who have to be in contact with sick
people, such as health care, delivery, and other essential workers. This led us
to introduce the fraction θ mentioned above and split the exposed and infected
subpopulations into two groups. One of the model conclusions, when applied
to South Korea, is that their success in controlling and reducing the infection
rates is related to having a period of 73 days in which 99.5% (θ = 0.995) of
the population followed the directives and disease control measures.
The second new idea, as noted above, is the variability of the contagion
or the contact parameter β. In some recent works, see, e.g., [22, 28] and the
references therein, β was considered as time-dependent but given and in this
way, the authors took into account the changes in directives and policies, as
well as seasonal variability of the infections. When we started developing this
model, there was some evidence of the virus mutations. Moreover, it is observed
that in simple SEIR models there is a saturation phenomenon, i.e., a decline
in infectivity, that is unrelated to the ‘herd immunity,’ see e.g., [12, 16, 29]
and references therein. Considering β as an unknown of the system, instead
of simply a time-dependent function, takes care of the intrinsic changes of
the contact parameter which are independent of the changes that are due to
the containment measures. This captures the evolution of the pandemic more
naturally. Therefore, we added a differential inclusion that causes β to grow
(linearly) with the number of infected people and to decay (linearly) with the
number of recovered. The linearity is an ad-hoc assumption, and it may be
of considerable interest to explore more appropriate underlying assumptions
leading to such an inclusion in the future.

A. Cesmelioglu et al.

Since the model includes a differential inclusion, we establish the existence
of the unique solution for the initial value problem, based on a theorem in
abstract Hilbert spaces, [7]. Moreover, the introduction of randomness into
some of the model parameters raises the question of the measurability of the
solutions with respect to the random variables. These mathematical issues are
discussed in some detail in Section 3.
An algorithm for the model simulations was constructed and implemented
in MATLAB and several simulations that show its predictive power are presented in this work in the context of the pandemic dynamics in South Korea.
South Korea was chosen because it is one of the first countries to go through
the disease cycle and the information provided by the government is very reliable. In the simulations, we used some of the published data to ‘train’ the
model by using an optimization routine in MATLAB which finds the model
parameters that provides the best `1 fit. We present our simulated model predictions together with the data one part of which was used in optimization
and the remaining part was gathered after the optimized parameters were determined. The simulations indicate that the model captures well the disease
dynamics in South Korea.
Following this introduction, the mathematical model for the pandemic is
constructed in detail in Section 2. It consists of a coupled system of seven
nonlinear ODEs and a differential inclusion for the virus infectivity. The existence of the unique solution to the model is established in Section 3. Section 4
describes briefly the addition of randomness and the measurability of the solutions to random model parameters. The stability of the two equilibrium states,
the disease-free equilibrium (DFE) and the endemic equilibrium (EE), is presented in Section 5, whereas an expression for the system’s Jacobian is derived
in the Appendix. Section 6 outlines the method we used for the numerical simulations of the model. Section 7 reports the results of the simulations of the
COVID-19 dynamics in South Korea. The baseline simulations are in Subsection 7.1, where the model predictions are compared to the data. This section
also provides additional information about the various subpopulations and the
variation in β as well as the stability of the DFE and EE. The effectiveness
of the control measures and their connection to θ is studied in Subsection 7.2,
while Subsection 7.3 presents the resulting case fatality rate and the infection
fatality rate. Section 8 describes a general way to perform sensitivity analysis.
Subsection 8.1 deals with the sensitivity to θ whereas Subsection 8.2 presents
the sensitivity with respect to the rate of becoming symptomatic. Conclusions,
unresolved issues and future work can be found in Section 9.

2 The Model
This section presents a mathematical model for the dynamics of the COVID19 pandemic. It is based on the ideas that led to the MERS model in [1–3].
However, there are significant differences between the compartmental structures and the resulting set of equations of the two models. In particular, this

Mathematical model of COVID-19

5

model separates the subpopulations of those who comply with the disease control directives and those who choose not to or cannot comply. Additionally, as
noted above, it takes into account the observed changes in the rate of infection,
possibly because of changing social behavior, climate, or mutations.
The model describes whole populations and assumes that they are large
enough to justify continuous dependent variables, thus, the use of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). When the geographical distribution of the disease
is important, or when the density and culture of the population vary in different parts of the country, it must be modified and partial differential equations
(PDEs) need to be used instead of ODEs. However, using PDEs considerably
increases the mathematical complexity of the model and is beyond the scope
of this paper.

death rate; pS , . . . , pR are influxes of individuals from outside; γf c , . . . , γI , δf c , δpc are infection rates; σEf c , . . . , σH are recovery rates; and df c , dpc , dH are the disease death rates;
Γ is the force of infection given in (9).

The model assumes that there may be various disease control measures
such as voluntary or mandatory isolation, shelter-in-place directives, movement controls, physical-distancing, and that a portion of the population practices these measures with varying degree. It describes the dynamics of seven
subpopulations: susceptibles S; asymptomatic (exposed) fully compliant Ef c ;
asymptomatic (exposed) partially compliant or noncompliant Epc ; infected fully
compliant, If c ; partially compliant or noncompliant infected Ipc ; hospitalized
H; and recovered R. Technically, the term ‘exposed’ above means ‘latent infectious’ and for the sake of simplicity, below we refer to partially compliant
or noncompliant as partially compliant. In addition, the model includes a differential inclusion for the infection rate function β. The populations and β are
functions of time, which is measured in days. The compartmental structure of
the model is depicted in Figure 1. The susceptible subpopulation S(t) consists
of those who are healthy (only in terms of the COVID-19, while they may

6

A. Cesmelioglu et al.

have other health conditions) and can become sick, or do not belong to any
of the other groups. The subpopulations Ef c (t) and Epc (t) denote the current
numbers of those exposed to COVID-19 who fully comply with the disease
control directives and those who do not or do so partially, respectively. The
subpopulation Epc (t) includes also those who because of work or other circumstances cannot fully follow the shelter-in-place and the other directives.
Furthermore, the subpopulations Ef c (t) and Epc (t) consist of: asymptomatics
– those who do not become sick; pre-symptomatics – those who in 5-14 days
will develop clinical symptoms; and those who do not show symptoms or are
mildly symptomatic but are not tested and documented. It is established that
both subpopulations carry the virus and can infect susceptibles.
The subpopulations If c (t) and Ipc (t) consist of documented infected individuals who are fully compliant or partially compliant, respectively, with no,
mild, or medium clinical symptoms. H(t) denotes those whose symptoms are
severe or critical and are hospitalized.
Finally, R(t) denotes the individuals who recovered from COVID-19 and as
of July 20, there are approximately 9 million such individuals in the world. We
assume that recovered individuals have temporal immunity and cannot become
infected again. However, at this stage we don’t know how long this immunity
lasts. If evidence of reinfection emerges, it is straightforward to modify the
model to add reinfection pathways in the compartmental structure, possibly
with delay.
Next, we define the parameters of the model. The total living population
at time t is given by
N (t) = S(t) + Ef c (t) + Epc (t) + If c (t) + Ipc (t) + H(t) + R(t).
We denote by pS (t) the number of susceptible individuals that are added
each day by birth or by travel from outside of the region of interest. We let
pEf c (t) and pEpc (t) be the per day influx of fully compliant and partially compliant exposed, respectively, and note that this influx (mostly by air travel)
seems to be one of the main reasons why COVID-19 spread so quickly around
the globe (see, e.g., [19]). Next, pIf c (t) and pIpc (t) denote the per day influxes
of fully compliant infected and partially compliant infected populations, respectively. Then, pH (t) is the number of those who arrive sick on day t and
need hospitalization, and pR (t) is the influx of recovered individuals.
The ‘natural’ death rate coefficient (in the absence of COVID-19) of the
population, µ (1/day), can easily be obtained from the demographic information of the country and can be considered as given.
Next, the contact rate (or the infection rate coefficient) β(t) (1/day) at time
t is the average number of contacts sufficient for transmission that measures
the ‘strength,’ infectivity or contagion of the virus. Then, the rates of infection
of a susceptible by a fully or partially compliant asymptomatic, a fully or
partially compliant infected, or a hospitalized results in infection, respectively,
are denoted by
Ef c β,

Epc β,

If c β,

Ipc β,

H β,

(1/day). The ’s are nonnegative dimensionless infection rate modification constants. When the isolation is very effective, the first and the last three are likely
to be small, since contacts are discouraged, and H should be kept small in
every hospital environment.
The rate Γ , the so-called force of infection, is given by
Γ =

β
(Ef c Ef c + Epc Epc + If c If c + Ipc Ipc + H H),
N

and measures the rate at which susceptibles get infected. The rate, per day,
at which the fraction θ of the susceptibles becomes exposed fully compliant is
θΓ S, and the rest becomes exposed partially compliant at the rate (1 − θ)Γ S.
Moreover, we allow interactions between the fully compliant exposed and partially compliant exposed populations, with rate constant γE . This takes into
account those who work in the health-care system or other essential places,
and come home; the interaction between delivery agents and fully compliant
individuals, and possible interaction between those who disobey the isolation orders and those who are exposed and fully compliant. The parameters
γf c , γpc (1/day) denote the rate constants of development of clinical symptoms
in fully compliant and partially compliant exposed individuals, while γ − , γ +
are the rate constants of clinical symptoms in fully compliant who become
partially compliant and infected (hopefully small), and those partially compliant exposed who become fully compliant infected. The model assumes that
there is no disease-induced death in the exposed populations. Next, the rate
constants at which the fully compliant infected and the partially compliant
infected individuals need hospitalization are δf c , δpc , respectively. The additional disease-induced death rates are df c and dpc , while dH is the disease
death rate of those hospitalized. To complete the flow chart, we denote by
σEf c , σEw , σIf c , σIpc and σH the recovery rates of the exposed, infected and
hospitalized, respectively.
Finally, the model takes into account the observed changes in the virulence (infectivity) of the coronavirus via a novel differential inclusion for the
infection rate coefficient β. These changes are most likely due to mutations of
the virus, or because of the changes in social behavior, or possibly the change
in weather (allowing more people to be outside where the infection rates are
smaller). We assume that the virus becomes more infective in proportion to the
infected population, with rate coefficient δ∗ ≥ 0, and becomes less infective in
proportion to the population immunity or the number of those recovered, with
rate constant δ ∗ ≥ 0. This is expressed in the differential inclusion (10) and a
detailed explanation can be found below. However, the inclusion is ad-hoc and
there may be a more appropriate expression based on a deeper understanding
of the virus and the pandemic. We hope to address this topic in the future.
With the notation and assumptions given above, our model for the COVID19 pandemic is defined below.

together with the initial conditions,
S(0) = S0 , Ef c (0) = Ef c0 , Epc (0) = Epc0 , If c (0) = If c0 , Ipc (0) = Ipc0 ,
H(0) = H0 , R(0) = R0 .
β(0) = β0 ∈ [β∗ , β ∗ ].

(11)

Here, S0 > 0 is the initial population at the breakout of the pandemic;
Ef c0 , Epc0 , If c0 , Ipc0 , H0 and R0 are nonnegative initial subpopulations, and
β0 is the initial transmission rate which can be estimated from the data.
In practice, one typically assumes that S0 = N (0) > 0, so that at the
start of the pandemic there are only susceptibles, and all the other populations vanish. However, for the sake of generality, we allow initially the other
subpopulations to be nonegative. Specifically, if the starting point is later than
the very first day of the pandemic, we assume that
N (0) = S0 + Ef c0 + Epc0 + If c0 + Ipc0 + H0 + R0 ,
so that (8) holds initially. A summary of the definitions of the model parameters is given in Table 1.
Equation (1) describes the rate of change, per day, of the susceptible population. The second term on the right-hand side is the rate at which the susceptibles become infected by contact with exposed, infected, and hospitalized

Mathematical model of COVID-19

9

individuals. The last term describes the ‘natural’ (unrelated to the pandemic)
mortality.
The rest of the equations, except (10), have a similar structure and similar
interpretation. For instance, in (6) the rate of change, per day, of the hospitalized is the sum of those who arrive from outside (say overflow in other
location), pH , and fully compliant and partially compliant infectives whose
illness becomes severe and need hospitalization, δf c If c + δpc Ipc , minus those
who recovered on that day, σH H, those who died naturally, µH, and those
who died because of the pandemic, dH H.
Next, we describe equation (10), actually a differential inclusion, for the
change in the infectiveness of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, . We assume a ‘simple’
linear relationship between the infection rate coefficient β and the fractions
of those with the virus and those who recovered. More detailed and complex
relationships will be studied in the sequel when enough data becomes available.
It is assumed that fraction of those infected, (Ef c + Epc + If c + Ipc + H)/N ,
makes the virus more infective, while an increase in the fraction of recovered
increases the immunity of the population leading to a decrease in the disease
virulence. Finally, the subdifferential imposes the limits of the infectiveness,
acting as follows. We let I[β∗ ,β ∗ ] (β) be the indicator function of the interval
[β∗ , β ∗ ], which has the value 0 when β is in the interval and +∞ otherwise.
Then, its subdifferential is the set-valued function, or multifunction,

(−∞, 0]

if β = β∗ ,
if β∗ < β < β ∗ ,
if β = β∗ ,
otherwise.

(12)

Adding this term guarantees that β∗ ≤ β(t) ≤ β ∗ for 0 ≤ t ≤ T . Indeed, when
β ∈ (β∗ , β ∗ ) then ζ = 0 and (9) is just a rate equation. When β(t) = β∗ then
there exists an element ζ ∈ (−∞, 0] that prevents β from becoming smaller
than β∗ ; and when β(t) = β ∗ there exists an element ζ ∈ [0, ∞) that prevents
β from exceeding β ∗ . This term is added to keep the interpretation of β as a
probability of infection, so naturally we assume that 0 < β∗ < β ∗ ≤ 1.
The number of active ‘documented’ or identified cases A(t), at time t, is
A(t) = If c (t) + Ipc (t) + H(t),
and, following [27], we denote by Am and Ac those with an active mild condition and those with serious or critical conditions, respectively, that is,
Am (t) = If c (t) + Ipc (t),

Ac (t) = H(t).

Next, CC(t), the cumulative or total number of cases, up to time t, is
CC(t) = A(t) + CR(t) + CD(t),

3 Existence and uniqueness of the solution
Proving the existence of a unique solution to the model for each finite time
interval is a mathematically important next step. Without the differential
inclusion (10) and when θ is a known continuous and bounded function, the
local existence in time follows from the fact that the functions on the righthand sides of the equations are locally Lipschitz. Then, the existence of the
global solution is established by demonstrating that the solution stays bounded
on every finite time interval. This includes showing that given nonnegative
initial conditions, the solution components stay nonnegative which is not only
necessary mathematically but also important for the model to be biologically
relevant. However, this is not the case in our model. Specifically, we allow θ to
be piecewise constant, hence not continuous, and β is not a given but a solution
of a differential inclusion. Therefore, the standard approach we outlined above
no longer works, requiring a more sophisticated approach that we detail in
what follows.
We assume that the input functions pS (t), . . . , pR (t) are bounded, nonnegative, and smooth and all the parameters are assumed to be positive constants.
First, we assume that θ(t) is nonnegative and bounded such that 0 ≤ θ(t) ≤ 1,
and that β is a given smooth function with values in [β∗ , β ∗ ] ⊂ (0, 1]. Below,
we relax the last two assumptions.

Positivity of S, Ef c , Epc , If c , Ipc , H, R. We first establish the non-negativity
of the solutions of the system when the initial data is non-negative (except for
S0 > 0). To that end, let S0 > 0 and assume that the other initial conditions
satisfy Ef c0 , Epc0 , If c0 , Ipc0 , H0 , R0 ≥ ε > 0, and also pR ≥ ε. Below we let
ε → 0. Thus, there exists T1 > 0, which we may assume to be the largest time,
such that the local solution exists and is unique on [0, T1 ). The continuity of
the solution implies that there is a maximal time t∗ , satisfying 0 < t∗ ≤ T1 ,
which may depend on ε, such that the solution is component-wise positive on
[0, t∗ ). Moreover, we have that N > 0 on [0, t∗ ], since otherwise if N (t∗ ) = 0
then by (8),
S(t∗ ) = Ef c (t∗ ) = Epc (t∗ ) = If c (t∗ ) = Ipc (t∗ ) = H(t∗ ) = R(t∗ ) = 0,
and it follows from (7) that at t = t∗ ,
dR
≥ ε > 0,
dt
which means that R is an increasing function at t∗ , and since R(t) > 0 on
[0, t∗ ), it is positive on [0, t∗ ], and then N > 0 on [0, t∗ ].
Then (9) implies that

0 ≤ Γ < 5β ∗ max Ef c , Epc , If c , Ipc , H := Γ ∗ ,
(17)
since Ef c , Epc , If c , Ipc , H < N and β ≤ β ∗ on [0, t∗ ]. It follows from (1) that
dS
≥ pS − (Γ ∗ + µ)S,
dt
on [0, t∗ ] since S0 > 0 and pS ≥ 0. Therefore
S(t) ≥ S0 exp (−(Γ ∗ + µ)t) ,
which means that S(t) ≥ αS0 > 0 on [0, t∗ ], where α = exp(−(Γ ∗ + µ)t∗ ).

which is necessary to prove boundedness but also makes the model biologically
relevant.
Next, we consider (2) and note that θΓ S ≥ 0 and
dEf c
≥ pEf c − γ

12

A. Cesmelioglu et al.

and since pEf c ≥ 0, we find that Ef c (t) ≥ Ef c0 exp(−b
γ1 t) > 0 on [0, t∗ ]. We
now consider (3), and since pEpc ≥ 0, (1 − θ)Γ S ≥ 0 and Ef c /N < 1, we have
dEpc
≥ pEpc − (b
γ2 + γE ) Epc ,
dt
therefore, Epc (t) ≥ Epc0 exp (−(b
γ2 + γE )t) > 0 on [0, t∗ ]. The arguments concerning (4) and (5) are similar. Noting that pIf c ≥ 0 and omitting all the
nonnegative terms in (4) yields
dIf c
≥ pIf c − δb1 If c ,
dt
and hence, If c (t) ≥ If c0 exp(−δb1 t) > 0 on [0, t∗ ]. Similarly, it follows from (5)
that Ipc (t) ≥ Ipc0 exp(−(δb1 + γI )t) > 0 on [0, t∗ ].
We turn to (6). Since pH ≥ 0 and δf c If c + δpc Ipc > 0, we have
dH
≥ −(σH + dH + µ)H,
dt
and so H(t) ≥ H0 exp (−(σH + dH + µ)t∗ ) > 0 on [0, t∗ ]. Finally, it follows
from (7) that
dR
> −µR,
dt
and hence R(t) > R0 exp(−µt) > 0 on [0, t∗ ].
We note that all the decay rates in the estimates above depend on the
problem data but are independent of ε, then all the variables S(t), . . . , R(t),
as well as N (t) and Γ (t), are positive on the closed interval [0, t∗ ], and since the
solution is continuous, we conclude that they are strictly positive on [0, T∗ ] for
some t∗ < T∗ < T1 , and by extension T∗ = T1 . Indeed, if S(t∗ ) = αS > 0 and
S is defined and continuous at t∗ , then there exists an interval (t∗ − δ, t∗ + δ),
for some δ > 0, such that S(t) ≥ αS /2 on (t∗ − δ, t∗ + δ).
We conclude that when ε > 0, i.e., the initial conditions are positive the
solution is positive as long as it exists. However, it is noted that T∗ doesn’t
depend on ε, and therefore, we have the following summary.
Proposition 1 that (20) holds and suppose that S0 > 0, the other initial
conditions are nonnegative, and θ and β are bounded and positive. Then, the
solution of system (1)-(7) is positive as long as it exists.
Under the assumptions of Proposition 1, the solution is positive as long as it
exists, and hence the only way it can cease to exist is when one or more of the
variables approaches infinity in finite time.

Boundedness of S, Ef c , Epc , If c , Ipc , H, R on finite intervals In the second step,
under the assumptions of Proposition 1, we show that each of S(t), . . . , R(t) is
bounded on every finite time interval, and therefore, the solution cannot approach infinity in finite time. This is sufficient to show that the solution exists
on each finite time interval. We begin with the interval of existence, [0, T1 ).
We note that since pS (t) is bounded and Γ > 0, equation (1) shows that
S(t) is bounded on every finite time interval it exists on. Next, using the
definition of γ
b1 given by (18) in equation (2), 0 ≤ θ ≤ 1, the bound on Γ given
by (17) and 0 < Epc /N < 1 yields
dEf c
< pEf c + Γ ∗ S − (b
γ1 − γE )Ef c .
(21)
dt
Then by assumption (20) that γE < γ
b1 and since pEf c and S are bounded, it
follows that Ef c is bounded. We now consider (3). Using the definition of γ
b2
given by (18), 0 ≤ 1 − θ ≤ 1, (17) and γE Epc Ef c /N > 0,
dEpc
< pEpc + Γ ∗ S − γ
b2 Epc .
(22)
dt
Since pEpc and S are bounded and γ
b2 > 0, it follows that Ef c is bounded.
Next, using the definition of δb1 from (18) and 0 < Ipc /N < 1 in (4) and (5),
we obtain
dIf c
< pIf c + γf c Ef c + γ − Epc − (δb1 − γI )If c ,
(23)
dt
dIpc
< pIpc + γpc Epc + γ + Ef c − δb2 Ipc .
(24)
dt
Since we assume γI < δb1 in (20), and since pIf c , pIpc , Ef c and Epc are all
bounded, the boundedness of If c , Ipc follows. The boundedness of H and R follows directly from equations (6), (7) and the fact that pH , pR and Ef c , Epc , If c ,
Ipc are all bounded independently of the choice of β as long as it is in [β∗ , β ∗ ].
We summarize the result as follows.
Proposition 2 Assume that S0 > 0 and the other initial conditions are
nonegative, and θ and β are bounded and positive. Moreover, assume that
γE < γ
b1 ,
γI < δb1 .
Then, the solution of system (1)-(7) is positive and bounded on every finite
interval.
Before proceeding with the existence proof, we note that Γ (t) is bounded
and positive and the boundedness results above and equation (8) imply that
N (t) is bounded and positive on every finite interval. Furthermore, the differential set-inclusion (10) can be rewritten as
dβ
R
+ δ ∗ β + ∂φ (β) 3 δ∗ Γ,
β (0) = β0 ∈ [β∗ , β ∗ ] ,
(25)
dt
N
where φ(β) = I[β∗ ,β ∗ ] (β), and ∂φ(β) is its subdifferential, (12). Since φ in (25)
is convex and lower semicontinuous, its subdifferential ∂φ forces β to remain
in the interval [β∗ , β ∗ ].

A. Cesmelioglu et al.

Existence and uniqueness To use the powerful tools of convex analysis for the
existence and uniqueness proof, we first reformulate the problem in an abstract
form. Letting
x = (S, Ef c , Epc , If c , Ipc , H, R),
the system defined by equations (1), (21) - (24), (6), (7), (equivalently, (1)–(7))
can be written as
x0 = F (t, x, β, θ) , x (0) = x0 ,
(26)
where F is Lipschitz in x, β, and θ and is bounded regardless of the choice of
β which is a continuous function having values in [β∗ , β ∗ ] for all t ∈ [0, T ], and
the choice of θ which is a bounded function with values in [0, 1].
We first assume that θ is continuous and θ ∈ [0, 1]. Then, below we relax
this assumption and allow it to be piecewise continuous. Let β and β̂ be two
continuous functions such that β(t), β̂(t) ∈ [β∗ , β ∗ ] for all t ∈ [0, T ]. We let x
and x̂ be the solutions to (26) corresponding to β and β̂, respectively. Then,
using straightforward computations as in [11, 17, 21] yield a constant C > 0,
independent of β and β̂, such that

Here, K is an appropriate Lipschitz constant that depends on the estimates
obtained above. Then, an application of Grönwall’s inequality shows that after
modifying the constants,
Z t

|x (t) − x̂ (t)| ≤ CK 2
|β − β̂|2 ds.
(27)

The Lipschitz continuity of F ensures the existence and uniqueness of
a solution to the initial value problem with given β and continuous θ (see
e.g., [6, Theorem 2.4]).
We summarize the result of the discussion above as follows.
Proposition 3 Assume that β is a continuous function having values in [β∗ , β ∗ ].
Then, there exists a unique solution to the initial value problem defined by (1),
(21) - (24), (6), (7). Moreover, if x, x̂ are two solutions corresponding to β
and β̂, then (27) holds for a constant C that is independent of β.
Now, let β ∈ C ([0, T ]) such that β (t) ∈ [β∗ , β ∗ ] for all t and define N and
Γ as in (8) and (9), respectively. Then, we use the solution that exists by
Proposition 3 to construct a solution to the evolution inclusion (25), based on
the following well-known theorem of Brezis [7]. In our case the Hilbert space
is R and we assume that β0 ∈ [β∗ , β ∗ ].

Mathematical model of COVID-19

Theorem 2 Let H be a Hilbert space. Let f ∈ L2 (0, T ; H) . Let φ be a lower
semicontinuous convex proper function defined on H and β0 be in the domain
of φ. Then, there exists a unique solution β ∈ L2 (0, T ; H) , β 0 ∈ L2 (0, T ; H) ,
to
β 0 (t) + ∂φ (β (t)) 3 f (t)
a.e. t,
β (0) = β0 .
We also have the following result:
Corollary 1 In addition to the assumptions of Theorem 2, suppose f (t) is
replaced with f (t) β, where f ∈ L∞ (0, T ; H). Then, there exists a unique
solution to the resulting inclusion.
Proof Let β̂ ∈ C ([0, T ] ; H) and let F (β̂) be the solution of
β 0 (t) + ∂φ (β (t)) 3 f (t) β̂.

(28)

Then, standard manipulations and the monotonicity of the subgradient, for
F (β̂) and F (β̄), yield

and shows that a sufficiently high power of F is a contraction map. Hence, F
has a unique fixed point that is the unique solution of the evolution inclusion
(28).
Now, we turn to the whole problem defined by (1), (21) - (25) and construct
a mapping Θ : C([0, T ]) → C([0, T ]) as follows. Let β̄ ∈ C ([0, T ]) having
values in [β∗ , β ∗ ]. Then, it follows from Proposition 3 that the solution to
the initial value problem for such fixed β̄ is unique. Now, we define a map
Θ : C([0, T ]) → C([0, T ]) where Θ(β̄) = β, is the solution of (25) for the given
β̄. We write the equation for β, given β̄, as
dβ
R(β̄)
+ δ∗
β + ∂φ(β) 3 δ∗ βF (β̄),
dt
N (β̄)

β(0) = β0 ∈ [β∗ , β ∗ ].

Since the estimates above do not depend on the choice of β̄, as long as it has
values in [β∗ , β ∗ ] , the differential inclusion is of the form
dβ
+ ∂φ(β) 3 G(t, x̄, β̄),
dt

β (0) = β0 ∈ [β∗ , β ∗ ] ,

where x̄ is the solution to the initial value problem with given β̄, and G is a
Lipschitz continuous function in both x̄ and β̄.
To proceed, we let β̄1 and β̄2 be given with the properties as above, and
let Θ(β̄1 ) ≡ β1 and Θ(β̄2 ) ≡ β2 . Then, it follows from the inclusion and the

16

monotonicity of ∂φ and routine computations that there exists a constant
C > 0, independent of β and a suitable Lipschitz constant K, such that

Therefore, a sufficiently high power of Θ is a contraction mapping, and it
has a unique fixed point that is the solution to the problem. This completes
the proof of the existence and uniqueness of the solution of the full problem
assuming the given function θ is continuous.
To take into account a piecewise continuous θ, we assume that there are
finitely many non-overlapping time intervals {Ii } and continuous functions
θi (t) defined on Ii such that θ (t) = θi (t) on the interior of Ii . Then, on each
interval where θ is continuous, we have a unique solution obtained as above,
and it is straightforward to piece these into a global solution of the problem.
This leads to the main mathematical result in this work.
Theorem 3 Assume that θ is bounded and piecewise continuous and
γE < γf c + γ + + σEf c + µ,

γI < δf c + σIf c + df c + µ.

(29)

Then, there exists a unique solution to the initial value problem (1) - (11) on
every finite time interval [0, T ].
We note that the assumptions on γE and γI are acceptable assumptions for
the model and it is possible to remove them at the expense of considerable
work needed to obtain the estimates.
Finally, since β has values in [β∗ , β ∗ ] and its derivative is in L2 (0, T ), it
follows that β is Hölder continuous with exponent 1/2. Therefore, the solution
is at least in C 1,1/2 (0, T ). It seems plausible that the regularity is higher since
β 0 ∈ L∞ (0, T ) and then it is Hölder continuous with exponent 1, however, we
leave open the question of further regularity of the solution.
4 Randomness in system parameters
For the sake of completeness, this short section provides a rather abstract
discussion about adding randomness to the system parameters. This allows
a better understanding of the model’s dependence on the parameter values.
Moreover, to use the model as a predictive tool, it is cruical to find out how
parameter changes affect model predictions. Small changes in the solution that
are caused by small changes in a parameter indicate that there is low sensitivity to the parameter and an approximate value is sufficient for acceptable

Mathematical model of COVID-19

17

predictions, while considerable changes in the solution caused by small changes
in the parameter values indicate that a more precise parameter value is needed
to obtain reliable predictions. It may also indicate that the model is unstable
or the process itself is unstable, in which case attempts at prediction may be
of little use.
We now introduce randomness into the system parameters. For the sake
of generality, we note that we have 41 system parameters as listed in Table 1
and let the probability space be (Ω, F, P ), where Ω is the sample space, a
box centered at the origin of R41 ; F is the Borel σ-algebra, and P is a general
probability function. In the numerical simulations for South Korea in Section 8,
we used the uniform distribution. We let ω ∈ Ω be the random variable and
define
ω=ω
b + ω,
(ω ∈ ω
b + Ω) ,
where ω
b denotes the vector containing the optimized parameters. We note that
the choice of Ω is such that ω ≥ 0 (component-wise).
Next, we consider the modified system (1), (21)– - (24), (6), (7) in the form
x0 = F (t, x, β, ω) ,

b (ω),
x0 (0) = x

b (ω) = x0 + ω̄, ω̄ ∈ Ω. together with the differential inclusion
where x
dβ e∗ R(ω)
+δ
β + ∂φ (β) 3 δ∗ Γ (ω),
dt
N (ω)

β (0) = β0 ∈ [β∗ , β ∗ ] .

Here, ∂φ(β) = I[β∗ ,β ∗ ] (β) is defined by (12). The function F depends on ω
such that ω → F (t, x, β, ω) is measurable, F is Lipschitz continuous in x and
β and is continuous in all of the first three variables.
It follows from the recent results in [18] that the uniqueness of the solutions
for each fixed ω implies that the functions ω → x (·, ω) , ω → β (·, ω) and ω →
F (·, x (·, ω) , β (·, ω) , ω) are each measurable into C ([0, T ]). Moreover, ω →
β 0 (·, ω) is measurable into L2 (0, T ), and then it follows from [18, Theorem
3.3] that (t, ω) → β 0 (t, ω) can be considered as a product measurable function.

5 Stability of the DFE and the EE
This section discusses the stability of the critical points of the system: the
disease-free equilibrium (DFE) and the endemic equilibrium (EE) (when it
exists), based on the system’s Jacobian matrix. The usual approach, see e.g.,
[4, 13, 23], is to derive the basic stability number RC . In simple SEIR models,
RC coincides with the basic reproduction number R0 , see, e.g., [3] for a more
complex form. Then, when RC < 1, all the eigenvalues of the Jacobian evaluated at the DFE have negative real parts, which indicates that the DFE is
asymptotically stable (i.e., stable and attracting), and there is no EE. On the
other hand, RC = 1 is a bifurcation point, and when RC > 1 at least one
of the real parts is positive and the DFE loses its stability. Usually when the
DFE becomes unstable the EE appears and is stable and attracting. However,

18

A. Cesmelioglu et al.

because of the complexity of our model, we did not find a closed-form expression for RC , so, instead, we derived the Jacobian of the system (Appendix A)
and evaluated it numerically at the DFE, and at the EE when it appeared.
To proceed, we assume that β = β0 ∈ [β∗ , β ∗ ] and the population is constant, that is, the number of ‘natural’ COVID-19 unrelated deaths is balanced
by pS , and so pS = N µ and pEf c , . . . , pR vanish. We let the solution
x(t) = (S(t), Ef c (t), Epc (t), If c (t), Ipc (t), H(t), R(t)),
represent the trajectory of the system in R7+ , for 0 ≤ t ≤ T . Then, the DFE is
such that is alive is susceptible, but there is no disease, that is,
DF E = (N, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),
and the force of infection vanishes, that is, Γ = 0.

We remark that a technical analysis is needed to establish rigorously that
in this model when the DFE is stable and attracting,

lim x(t) = DF E,

t→∞

for all nonnegative initial conditions, and the EE does not exist. And when
the DFE loses stability, the EE appears and is stable and attracting. We leave
this theoretical question open here and remark about it in Section 9.
In the simulations for South Korea it is found that for days 8−80, θ = 0.995
and for this value, the DFE is stable and attracting. However, the control
measures were relaxed on day 81, and then it is found that θ = 0.425, and for
this value the DFE is unstable and there is EE that is stable and attracting.
We discuss this further in Section 7.1 below.

6 Numerical Simulations
This section presents computer simulations of the model which were conducted
using MATLAB. Specifically, ode45 ordinary differential equations solver and
fmincon constrained optimization routine were used to determine the value of
the model parameters (optimized parameters) that minimize the `1 deviation
of the model predictions from the given data. In particular, we focused on the
seven-day averaged numbers daily case and death and the total number of
cases and deaths. Table 1 summarizes the meaning of the model parameters
and for the model to make sense we impose the following constraints:

γpc + γ + σEpc + µ + γE < 1,

Next, we present the numerical results of the dynamics of COVID-19 in
South Korea.
7 COVID-19 in South Korea
This section presents various simulations depicting the model predictions for
the pandemic dynamics in South Korea. We chose South Korea since it was
one of the earliest countries that went through the pandemic cycle and the
complete unbiased data was available on the web, in particular in [27]. The
pandemic there is currently under control, with minor outbreaks. The values
of the optimized baseline parameters and their intervals of feasibility can be
found in Table 2, however, N and µ were not part of the optimization process.
We solved the ODEs of Model 1 numerically using these optimized parameters
to predict the pandemic’s near future.
As is noted above, the values in Table 2 were obtained by an `1 optimization
routine in MATLAB that compared the model predictions for the total number
of cases and the total number of deaths as well as the seven-day averaged daily
cases and deaths with the data taken from [27] for the time period of 100 days,
from 15 February until 25 May 2020.
It is important to emphasize that the model uses past data and, therefore,
cannot predict outcomes resulting from major changes in the virus behavior,

population behavior, policy, or the environment. However, the model predictions for the near future seem to be reasonable and provide some details that
the current data collection cannot. In particular, the infectivity of the virus
seems to change, as we show below.

7.1 Baseline simulations
We start with the baseline simulation, using the parameters in Table 2. To
properly describe the South Korean government response to the pandemic, we
use the following values of θ: the lock-down order was declared on day 8, and
the gradual relaxation of the directive started on day 81. To represent these
policy changes in the model, we set


if t < 8,
θ1 = 0.01
θ = θ2 = 0.995 if 8 ≤ t < 81,


θ3 = 0.425 if 81 ≤ t.
These values were obtained by the optimization subroutine and in particular,
we note that θ = 0.995 for days 8 − 80 corresponds to a very effective control
policy and a highly compliant population.
The cumulative number of COVID-19 cases and the cumulative number of
deaths are depicted in Figure 2 for the period of 175 days, from 15 February
until 8 August 2020. The red filled circles are the field data for the first 100
days of the pandemic (15 February until 25 May), [27], which were used in optimizing the parameters, while the green filled squares depict subsequent data.
Therefore, the green filled squares are a measure of the model’s predictive ability. The agreement of the model prediction with the observed data is good for
the cumulative number of cases, although it slightly under-predicts the more
recent cases, however, the prediction is very good for the total deaths. We note
the model does not fully capture the initial exponential growth in the number
of cases, while it does so well with the number of deaths. Figure 3 depicts the
daily cases and deaths, respectively, for the same simulations. To allow for a
better comparison, in addition to the data (red filled circles and green filled
squares) we also introduce, similarly to various web publications, a seven-day
moving average (red curve), i.e., averaging the data over the previous seven
days (or a part of them at the beginning). Since the numbers are rather small
and have a considerable level of randomness, while the model uses continuous variables, the correspondence is rather remarkable. We conclude that the
model captures well the known details of the pandemic in South Korea.
The form of the model allows us to investigate the behavior of the other
subpopulations, which were not reported separately, and this provides further
details and considerable insight into the disease dynamics. Figure 4 depicts
the model predictions of the combined daily numbers of exposed, Ef c + Epc ,
and the daily numbers of infected If c + Ipc subpopulations, however, the corresponding data is not available (at least in open sources). Moreover, we could

also plot the different subpopulations separately, but for the sake of simplicity
lumped the exposed together and the infected together.

infected (If c + Ipc ) (bottom). 175 days from 15 February until 8 August 2020. θ changed
from θ1 = 0.01 to θ2 = 0.995 on day 8 and to θ3 = 0.425 on day 81.

Figure 5 depicts the simulation results for the other three subpopulations:
the daily decrease in the number of susceptibles S (top left), the number
of hospitalized H (top right) and the number of recovered R (bottom left),
the latter two should be known precisely to the authorities, but to the best
of our knowledge were not reported online. Finally, and this is one of the
main contributions of this work, we depict the slight decrease in the contact
rate or infectivity of the virus, β (lower right). It indicates that considering
the infection rate coefficient as a dependent variable results in better model
predictions. Moreover, simulations for other countries show considerably more
variation in β.
To determine the stability of the DFE, we compute numerically all the
eigenvalues of the Jacobian at the DFE, given by (30). For θ = 0.995 the
eigenvalues are approximately
−1.7 10−5 ,

−1.7 10−5 ,

−0.26324,

−0.06948,

−0.04947

−0.12188 ± 0.00484 i.
Thus, when θ = 0.995 all the eigenvalues have negative real parts, so we
conclude the DFE is stable and attracting, and also since two eigenvalues
have imaginary parts, some components of the solution should oscillate as they

converged to the DFE. Hypothetical runs with θ = 0.995 results in convergence
to the DFE. Furthermore, since the first two eigenvalues are very close to zero,
the rate of convergence is very slow.
However, as the directives in South Korea became more relaxed on day 81
the value of θ decreases to 0.425 and so the stability of the DFE needs to be
studied further. Using the baseline parameters (except for θ) in our simulations
show that when θ is approximately equal to θ∗ = 0.58747 there is a bifurcation
and at least one of the eigenvalues has a positive real part, and so the DFE is
unstable. Furthermore, when θ = 0.425 the eigenvalues of the Jacobian at the
DFE are
−1.7 10−5 , −1.7 10−5 , 0.02526
−0.243801,

−0.04976,

−0.14026 ± 0.00425 i.

Therefore, following day 81, the DFE in the model for South Korea is unstable,
and the EE appears and we obtain S = 50, 613, 306, Ef c = 22, Epc = 5, If c =
11, Ipc = 6, H = 11, R = 375, 797 by running the baseline simulation for 1500
days with θ = 0.425. Thus, asymptotically,
EE = (50.6 106 , 22, 5, 11, 6, 11, 37.6 104 ).
Moreover, at the end of 1500 days, β is stabilized to 0.05. The cumulative cases,
deaths, and asymptomatics were projected, respectively, to be approximately
CC = 392, 200,

CD = 13, 800,

CA = 179, 600.

Mathematical model of COVID-19

25

Using this information, we conclude that on day 1500 (i.e., asymptotically)
the predicted death rates are,
CF R = 0.035,

IF R = 0.024.

We next note that in Spain [20], about a third of the individuals who have
developed antibodies were asymptomatic, that is, they did not develop any
clinical symptoms and were undocumented until they were tested for antibodies. Using (16), we obtain that the number of such cases in South Korea
is
CA(300) = 24, 225,
which is 48% of the 50, 428 cumulative number of cases. This information may
be of interest to South Korean health authorities, as it shows that about half
of the latent infections were never detected.
Since our model predictions agree well with the data, we have enough
confidence in our model to proceed with the study of the other aspects of the
pandemic.
7.2 Effectiveness of control and θ
We study next the effectiveness of all the control measures in South Korea that
are used to contain the pandemic, lumped together, and described in the model
by the parameter θ. To that end, we conduct three hypothetical mathematical
experiments showing what would the model predict if the control measures
were less aggressive. So, we use three other values of θ representing different
responses of the government and the population to the pandemic. In these
simulations, the θ values are applied on day one and does not change over
the 150 days of simulation. In the first simulation, we choose θ = 0.5, which
means that there are some control measures but they are not very strict; in
the second simulation θ = 0.2; and in the third simulation, θ = 0.1, that is,
very few control measures are in place. All the other system parameters are
kept at their baseline values. We note in passing that if any one of these cases
was realized, some of the system parameters would have been different, and it
is very likely that the outcome would have been worse. It is seen in Figure 6
that when θ = 0.5 the number of cumulative cases and deaths on day 149 (13
July 2020) would increase by more than six-fold. Specifically, on that day the
predicted cases were about 89, 100 and deaths about 1, 960, whereas the data
was at 13, 479 and 289, respectively.
Next, Figure 7 shows that when θ = 0.2, both the number of cumulative
cases and deaths on day 150 would be more than 200-fold. Specifically, the
model predicts that on day 150 there would be about 2, 939, 984 cases and
79, 954 deaths.
Finally, it is seen in Figure 8 that if θ = 0.1 the number of cumulative
cases on day 150 would have jumped more than 300-fold and the cumulative
number of deaths would be more than 600-fold. Specifically, on day 150, the

The number of cases on day 150 would have quadrupled, and the number of deaths would
be more than 6-fold.

model predicts about 5, 326, 419 cases and 187, 231 deaths whereas the data
(on day 149) is at 13, 479 and 289, respectively.
Whereas it is common sense to expect that less control measures would
lead to worse outcomes, our model predicts substantially worse consequences

with relaxed control measures. Indeed, higher values of θ are quite effective to
avoid large scale disruptions of the health care system, and all other state and
economic systems because of the pandemic.

Fig. 8: Simulation with θ = 0.1. Cumulative cases (top) and cumulative deaths (bottom).
The number of cases on day 150 would be 300-fold and the deaths would be 600-fold.

7.3 The COVID-19 death rates in South Korea
Since there is considerable discussion in the literature and especially in the
media, about the COVID-19 death rates, we use the baseline simulations to
determine two death rates, (see, e.g., [26]). The first, the case fatality rate
(CFR), µ∗∗
cov19 (t), is the ratio of the total deaths caused by the disease to all
those who have been diagnosed (or documented) with the disease, and this
includes the current infectives, hospitalized, and those who recovered or died,
and is given by
CD(t)
CF R = µ∗∗
.
cov19 (t) =
CC(t)
Here, CD(t) is the accumulated number of deaths, (14), and CC(t), (13), is
the accumulated number of infected, up to time t. The second, the infection
fatality rate (IFR), µ∗cov19 (t), is the ratio of the deaths to all those who had
the virus, including the asymptomatics, and is given as
IF R = µ∗cov19 (t) =

CD(t)
.
CC(t) + CA(t)

Figure 9 shows that on day 149 (13 July) the CFR was approximately 2.45%

28

A. Cesmelioglu et al.

∗

time in the baseline simulation.

and the IFR was 1.61%. According to the official South Korea Center for Disease Control (KCDC) [15], on that day there were 289 deaths and 13, 479 cases,
hence the ‘real’ CF R = 2.14% was slightly less than the model prediction.
We note that whereas information on CF R = µ∗∗
cov19 can be found officially,
information for IF R = µ∗cov19 cannot since it includes those who were never
officially counted as having the virus, and usually one has to revert to different
ways of estimating it. Thus, our model provides a means to estimate this death
rate used (often loosely) in the media.

8 Sensitivity analysis
We study the sensitivity of the model to θ and the rates of infection γf c and
γpc which are chosen for their importance in the model. However, a complete
sensitivity analysis would require a 41-dimensional box for all the parameters
and is not feasible. To introduce randomness, we allow θ, and then γf c and
γpc to vary randomly in their prescribed intervals and run 100 simulations
one with each random value for 300 days. At each day the maximum and
minimum values (dashed curves in the figures) of the solutions were obtained,
and these curves constitute the envelope of the region that contains all possible
solutions (light blue region). These bounding curves provide prediction bands
with a high likelihood that the actual field data would fall into these bands.
We note that these bounding curves are not necessarily solutions of the model.

Mathematical model of COVID-19

29

8.1 Sensitivity to θ
We start with the sensitivity of the model to θ, which measures the effectiveness
of the control measures and population compliance. To that end, we run the
simulations from the beginning of the pandemic (15 February 2020), with the
baseline parameters, except that θ varies randomly (but held constant in each
simulation) between 0.01 and 0.995, using the uniform distribution. However,
we observe that the critical value θ∗ = 0.58747, which separates the cases when
the solutions approach the DFE and the EE, made it necessary to display the
results separately for the cases when (i) θ∗ < θ and (ii) θ < θ∗ . Indeed, it can
be seen in the figures that the scales in the two cases are very different, and
so information in case (i) would be lost on a joint graph. Figure 10 shows

Fig. 10: The cumulative cases for random θ (uniform distribution) : θ∗ < θ ≤ 0.995 (top)
and 0.01 ≤ θ < θ∗ (bottom). The dashed curves represent the daily maximum and the
minimum values of the solutions; all possible solutions lie in the light blue regions. The blue

the model prediction of the cumulative cases (blue curve) and the data (red
filled circles and green filled squares). It is seen that the variability in case (ii)
is 200-fold larger than in case (i). The results for the accumulated deaths are
depicted in Figure 11. It is seen that the scale in (ii) is 300-fold larger than
that in (i). Moreover, the variability in case (ii) is very large. Therefore, as
was mentioned above, when θ < θ∗ one needs to find a much more accurate
value of θ. We also note that on the scale in (ii) the data and the baseline

case.

simulations coincide with the bottom (minimum) envelope. It is seen that the
envelopes do capture the trends for the accumulated cases and deaths.
Next, Figures 12 and 13 present the simulations of the daily cases and
deaths, split by the value of θ into the two cases as above. It is seen that although the data has large daily variations, especially in case (ii), the envelopes
do capture the trend for the daily cases and deaths. Moreover, there seems to
be a potential for a large second wave. However, based on the current data,
such a wave was not realized, and the model predicts that by the middle of
September the epidemic will subside and approach the EE state.
We conclude that allowing for variations in θ provides a good picture of
the disease dynamics, and allows some confidence in the model predictions.
However, we note that the system is sensitive to θ and produces large variations
in the solutions resulting from small variations in its values. Therefore, to
obtain accurate predictions, one must estimate the value of θ accurately.

8.2 Sensitivity to γf c and γpc
We next describe the model sensitivity to the rates of infection of those exposed
who follow the directives, Ef c , and the exposed who do so partially, Epc . To
that end, we used the same baseline coefficients as in Table 2, including the

solutions. The blue curve is the baseline solution, the red filled circles and the green filled
squares are the data. The red curve in the top plot depicts the seven-day moving averages
of the data. Notice the 200-fold difference in the scales and the very wide dispersion in the

three values of θ, and then introduced randomness into the coefficients γf c and
γpc , as follows. We let
Ωf c = [0.01, 0.085],

Ωpc = [0.04, 0.15],

and then used 100 simulations of 400 days each with the random values
(γf c , γpc ) ∈ Ωf c × Ωpc ,
using the uniform distribution. The simulation results for the cumulative cases
and deaths are depicted in Figure 14 and the daily cases and deaths in Figure
15. We conclude that the system is sensitive to these two infection rates, as
small variations in their values lead to considerable variations in the solutions.
This means that they need to be estimated rather accurately for the model
predictions to be useful.
9 Conclusions and further research
This work presents a new compartmental model of the SEIR-type for the
dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic to study its course and the effectiveness
of some of the disease control and containment measures. The model’s novelty
is three-fold. First, the populations are split into those who follow fully all

the containment measures and those who do this partially, such as essential
workers who need to be mobile, or those who choose not or only partially follow
the directives. The split is controlled by the parameter θ which is designed to
mimic the changes in the severity of the control measures dictated by the
government. Second, the infection rate β(t) is defined as a dependent variable,
the dynamics of which is governed by a differential inclusion, (10). This takes
into account the intrinsic variability of β due to possible mutations of the virus
or other causes of infection rate changes, such as a change in the population
behavior. Third, randomness is added to study the model dependence and
sensitivity to some of the model parameters.
Since the model is complex and includes a differential inclusion, the existence of its unique solution is established by a nonstandard proof, using results
from convex analysis. Moreover, when the data is measurable with respect to
the random variables, then so are the solutions.
Several baseline simulations, in MATLAB, of the disease dynamics were
conducted for South Korea where the optimal model parameters were obtained by an (`1 based) optimization routine to fit our model to the data of
both cumulative and daily cases and deaths. In particular, the parameter θ
that controls the split between fully and partially compliant populations is
found to be 0.01 for the first eight days, on day eight (22 February) when a
lock-down and strict control measures were implemented it jumped to 0.995

solution baseline and the data are close to the minimum curve.

and as the control measures started to ease on day 81 (6 May) it dropped to
0.425. According to our baseline simulations, the model captures the disease
dynamics very well when compared to the data for daily cases and deaths
and cumulative cases and deaths. Furthermore, it provides additional information about the dynamics of the disease which may not be observable by the
authorities.
To gain further insight into the model predictions, we studied the equilibrium points of the system. Instead of finding a basic reproduction number RC ,
we used the system Jacobian due to the complexity of the model. Using this
Jacobian, we found that the disease-free equilibrium (DFE) is asymptotically
stable when θ = 0.995 and becomes unstable about θ∗ = 0.58747; and since we
used θ = 0.425 from day 81 onward, it was found that an endemic equilibrium
(EE) appeared and was stable and attracting. Therefore, as long as θ < θ∗ the
model predicts that the disease will linger for a very long time, but, we note
that the disease-related EE numbers are very small.
Next, we used the baseline simulations to compute the death rates and
found that the case fatality rate was CF R = 0.025 and the infection fatality
rate was IF R = 0.0163, Figure 9. When θ = 0.425, asymptotically (for large
time) the model predicts CF R = 0.035 and IF R = 0.024. Furthermore, the
model predicts that those who are asymptomatic and do not have any clinical
symptoms make up about 48% of all the cases (on 11 December, day 300).

Fig. 15: The daily cases (top) and daily deaths (bottom). (γf c , γpc ) ∈ Ωf c × Ωpc vary
randomly. The dashed curves show the daily maximum and minimum values bounding the
region where all the solutions are (light blue region). The blue curve is the baseline solution
and the red filled circles and the green filled squares are the data. In both cases the baseline
and the data are close to the minimum curve.

The next topic we investigated was the effectiveness of the disease control
measures and the values of θ. Simulations with θ = 0.5, 0.2, 0.1 shows that
not using sufficient control measures would cause a substantial increase in the
number of cases and deaths. Indeed, for θ = 0.1 our results show that there
would be more than a 300-fold increase in cases and 600-fold increase in the
fatalities.
Our sensitivity studies revealed that the model is sensitive to θ as we
observed large variation in the results when θ is randomized using the uniform
distribution between 0.01 and 0.995. Similarly, the model is sensitive to the
infection rates of the exposed (γf c , γpc ). This means that to obtain reliable
predictions, these model parameters need to be found or estimated accurately.
These results provide confidence in the model’s predictions, and using it
may provide deeper insights into other aspects of the pandemic. We now describe some of the unresolved issues that may be of interest for further study:
(i) Establish rigorously the bifurcation property in θ; the convergence of
the solutions to the DFE when it is stable and attracting, and the convergence
to the EE when it exists. Determine that there are no other equilibrium points
and analyze in more depth the properties of the two states.
(ii) Study in more detail the differential inclusion for β, and possibly derive
it from basic principles.

Mathematical model of COVID-19

35

(iii) Replace the jump in θ to 0.425 after day 81 when the lock-down control
measures started to ease, with an appropriate function of time, θ = θ(t).
(iv) Introduce more θ-like parameters to allow for the separate assessment
of the control measures, such as wearing a face mask in public, washing hands
often, keeping distance in public spaces, and following the instructions. However, such an expansion may result in a more complex model that may be
problematic to work with.
(v) Find the correlation between the model prediction of the hospitalized
H(t), Figure 5 (top right), and the field data.
(vi) Conduct sensitivity analysis to other parameters.
(vii) Find the optimal regularity of the solutions.
(viii) In the model the inputs pS , etc were assumed to be smooth timedependent functions, but in the computations we used constant values. It may
be of interest in the future treat these similarly to θ and allow them to be
piecewise smooth.
We conclude that the model has been sufficiently validated for the pandemic in South Korea. It both provides insight and allows for ‘mathematical
experiments.’ We plan to use if for other countries and states for which reliable
data can be found.

Jacobian of the system

This appendix constructs an expression for the system’s Jacobian. For the sake
of brevity of the expressions below, we let
γ
bf c = γf c + γ + + σEf c + µ,

γ
bpc = γpc + γ − + σEpc + µ,

δbf c = δf c + σIf c + df c + µ,

δbpc = δpc + σIpc + dpc + µ,

σ
bH = σH + dH + µ.

Next, we we write the part (1)–(7) of the system as
dx(t)
= f (t),
dt
where the components of f (t) are given by
f1 (t) = pS − Γ S − µS,
γE
Ef c Epc ,
N
γE
Ef c Epc ,
f3 (t) = pEpc + (1 − θ)Γ S − γ
bpc Epc −
N
γI
f4 (t) = pIf c + γf c Ef c + γ − Epc − δbf c If c +
If c Ipc ,
N
γI
f5 (t) = pIpc + γpc Epc + γ + Ef c − δbpc Ipc −
If c Ipc ,
N
f6 (t) = pH + δf c If c + δpc Ipc − σ
bH H,

f2 (t) = pEf c + θΓ S − γ
bf c Ef c +

f7 (t) = pR + σEf c Ef c + σEpc Epc + σIf c If c + σIpc Ipc + σH H − µR.

The the Jacobian matrix of the system is



J11 . . . J17


J(x) =  ... . . . ...  ,
J71 . . . J77
where Jij = ∂fi /∂xj , 1 ≤ i, j, ≤ 7. To compute J(x), we note that
