Knowing the physicochemical properties of exhaled droplets and aerosol particles is a
prerequisite for a detailed mechanistic understanding and effective prevention of the airborne transmission of infectious human diseases. This article provides a critical review
and synthesis of scientific knowledge on the number concentrations, size distributions,
composition, mixing state, and related properties of respiratory particles emitted upon
breathing, speaking, singing, coughing, and sneezing. We derive and present a parameterization of respiratory particle size distributions based on five lognormal modes related
to different origins in the respiratory tract, which can be used to trace and localize the
sources of infectious particles. This approach may support the medical treatment as well
as the risk assessment for aerosol and droplet transmission of infectious diseases. It was
applied to analyze which respiratory activities may drive the spread of specific pathogens,
such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, influenza viruses, and SARS-CoV-2 viruses. The
results confirm the high relevance of vocalization for the transmission of SARS-CoV2 as well as the usefulness of physical distancing, face masks, room ventilation, and
air filtration as preventive measures against COVID-19 and other airborne infectious
diseases.

I. INTRODUCTION

Diseases that spread via the respiratory tract, such as
measles, tuberculosis, influenza, and the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have played dramatic and important roles in global public health (e.g., Cyranoski, 2020;
Kutter et al., 2018; Tellier et al., 2019). Disease outbreaks can be driven, in whole or large part, by emissions of pathogen-laden particles that can infect nearby

persons, such as those expelled in a spray of droplets
or clouds of small airborne aerosols (e.g., Milton, 2020;
Morawska, 2006; Seminara et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2021;
Tellier et al., 2019). Knowledge on the relative importance of transmission pathways and the mechanisms of
host-to-host transmission, in relation to pathogen-host
interactions and environmental factors, remain critical
gaps of knowledge (Bazant and Bush, 2021; Bourouiba,
2020a, and references therein). A detailed understanding of pathogen transmission dynamics in space and time
is needed to improve public health interventions, which
are a cornerstone in pandemic control besides vaccination strategies, to control outbreaks and reduce infection
rates (Milton, 2020; Richard and Fouchier, 2016).
Several transmission routes for pathogens passable between humans are known (Judson and Munster, 2019;
Kohanski et al., 2020; Leung, 2021; Li, 2021; Seto, 2015).
The most widely occurring and relevant routes can be
grouped into contact vs contact-free. Contact transmission from an infected individual to a susceptible recipient
can occur through either direct person-to-person contact
(e.g., a handshake) or indirect contact via contaminated
objects or surfaces (fomites), followed by a hand-toface transport of pathogens (i.e., self-inoculation of eyes,
nose or mouth) (Asadi et al., 2020a; Schulze-Röbbecke,
2014). Transmission without physical contact, through
the air, can occur via both near- and far-field transmission from either small or large particles being emitted
by the mouth or nose of infected individuals via coughing, sneezing, talking, or even breathing (e.g., Chen et al.,
2020; Fennelly, 2020; Li, 2021; Morawska, 2006; NASEM,
2020; Scheuch, 2020; Schulze-Röbbecke, 2014; Tang et al.,
2021). For this pathway, the terms contact-free and airborne are commonly used. Particles containing viable
pathogens can then land directly on the mucosal surfaces
of the recipient or can be inhaled. This review focuses
only on emissions from the respiratory tract, defined here
as the path of respiratory air from deep lungs through the
mouth and nose. Nevertheless, other emissions of potentially pathogen-laden particles, e.g. from the human
body (i.e., the ”personal cloud” effect of skin, clothing
emissions) and of aerosolized fecal material can also play
critical roles in disease transmission, if deposited in the
respiratory tract of a recipient (e.g., Johnson et al., 2013;
Kang et al., 2020; Lai et al., 2018; Meadow et al., 2015;
Sherertz et al., 2001; Yamamoto et al., 2015; Yang et al.,
2021; You et al., 2013).
Particles with diameters larger than ∼100 µm are often called droplets in the context of respiratory emissions
(Prather et al., 2020a). After being emitted, droplets follow (semi-)ballistic trajectories to deposit directly onto
objects or mucosal surfaces, i.e., in the nose, mouth, or
eyes. Due to the large mass they are only weakly influenced by the airflow and inhalation is relatively unlikely (Hinds, 1999; Vincent et al., 1990; Volkwein et al.,
2011). Droplets also have too much mass to stay sus-

pended for longer than a few seconds and so fall to the
ground rapidly within about one to two meters of the
emitter (Chen et al., 2020; Prather et al., 2020a). The
near-field deposition of droplets largely depends on particle size and emission velocity, and thus extends increasingly further from the source via singing or shouting as
well as coughing or sneezing (e.g., Bourouiba, 2020a,b;
Bourouiba et al., 2014; Mittal et al., 2020). Particles
with diameters smaller than ∼100 µm are often called
aerosols or droplet nuclei in the context of respiratory
emissions and have sufficiently small mass and momentum to be inhalable via airflow into the respiratory tract
(e.g., Vincent et al., 1990). Respiratory aerosols are generally present in the highest concentration in the nearfield in a plume closest to the emitter, but can also mix
readily into a volume of air in the far-field (e.g., Chen
et al., 2020; Lelieveld et al., 2020; Samet et al., 2021;
Tang et al., 2021). They can remain suspended for minutes or even hours, depending on particle size and the
free air turbulence or flow dynamics (Bourouiba, 2020a).
Thus, it can be possible for aerosols to be a dominant
mode of transmission in both the near-field (1-2 m) and
far-field (e.g., mixed into room air) (e.g., Chen et al.,
2020; Li, 2021; Nissen et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020),

though mitigation strategies may differ within the two
categories of distance.
Disease transmission through exhaled particles can
tend predominantly toward the aerosol route if mostly
small and readily airborne particles containing viable
pathogens are emitted, or predominantly towards the
droplet route if mostly large and (semi-)ballistically distributed droplets are involved. This distinction is largely
a function of pathogen-host interaction and physiological
factors. The boundary between aerosols and droplets is
fraught, because, from a physical perspective, they each
lie at different ends of a size continuum (Wilson et al.,
2020). Historically, a dividing size of 5 µm has been utilized, but this has relatively little support from either
physical or physiological reasoning (Li, 2021; Tang et al.,
2021). For example, the settling velocity of a 5 µm leads
to a residence time of 25 minutes. Upward convection
from body heat and other turbulent dynamics make the
estimation of residence time more complicated, but even
particles smaller than this will mix into the majority of
the room volume and are thus relevant for inhalation in
the far-field. More recently a dividing size of 100 µm has
become more commonly accepted, largely because this
is approximately the size above which particles are un-

4
likely to be inhaled, based on the physics of airflow into
the respiratory tract (Beggs, 2020; Bourouiba, 2020b;
Jayaweera et al., 2020; Prather et al., 2020a). It should
also be noted that, while many communities differentiate between aerosol and droplet size regimes, the specific
cut-point definition between the regimes can be different. In the near-field, infection can be caused by ballistic droplet spray and contact-based mechanisms, as well
as by inhalation of concentrated aerosol clouds, which
means that near-field aerosol infection can mimic epidemiological patterns of large-droplet spray or contact
infections (Bourouiba, 2020a; Chen et al., 2020; Roy and
Milton, 2004). Accordingly, it can be very complicated
to separate these processes to identify the most significant route for a given pathogen (Fennelly, 2020; Milton,
2012; Morawska et al., 2020; Tellier et al., 2019). The size
range of deposited pathogen-containing particles can also
play an important role in the development and severity
of the disease (e.g., Port et al., 2020; Zuo et al., 2020).
The ’classical’ examples of pathogens that spread predominantly via aerosols are Mycobacterium tuberculosis causing tuberculosis (TB), the measles morbillivirus
(MeV) causing measles, and the varicella-zoster virus
(VZV) causing chickenpox (e.g., Bloch et al., 1985; JonesLopez et al., 2013; Leung, 2021; Riley et al., 1978, 1959,
1962; Tellier et al., 2019). More ’exotic’ pathogens that
can spread via aerosols are the bacteria Coxiella burnetii causing Q fever and the spores of Bacillus anthracis
causing anthrax (e.g., Fennelly et al., 2004a; de Rooij
et al., 2016). For the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the
readily transmissible severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Satija and Lal, 2007; Zuo
et al., 2020), the preponderance of evidence suggests that
SARS-CoV-2 is aerosol-transmissible with virus-laden
respiratory particles transmitted through the air being
(key) drivers of infection (e.g., Anderson et al., 2020;
Asadi et al., 2020a; Birgand et al., 2020; van Doremalen
et al., 2020; Hadei et al., 2020; Klompas et al., 2020; Kutter et al., 2020; Kwon et al., 2020; Lednicky et al., 2021,
2020; Liu et al., 2020; MacIntyre and Ananda-Rajah,
2020; Miller et al., 2020; Morawska et al., 2020; NASEM,
2020; Nissen et al., 2020; Prather et al., 2020a; Qian et al.,
2020; Santarpia et al., 2020a; Scheuch, 2020; Sommerstein et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2021). This is in line with
studies suggesting that the closely related coronaviruses
SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV (Middle-East Respiratory
Syndrome coronavirus) also spreads through aerosols as
well (e.g., Booth et al., 2005; Li et al., 2005; Olsen et al.,
2003; Wong et al., 2004; Yu et al., 2004).
Figure 1 illustrates the life cycle of respiratory particles in contact-free pathogen transmission, spanning from
exhalation over airborne transport to the potential infection of a recipient (Samet et al., 2021). The emission
of particles in relation to respiratory activities, such as
breathing, speaking, singing, coughing, and sneezing has
been analyzed in numerous studies, as summarized, e.g.,

in reviews by Gralton et al. (2011), Han et al. (2013),
and Bake et al. (2019). The fluid dynamics involved
in the spread of the exhaled multiphase cloud of potentially pathogen-laden particles was summarized, e.g., by
Bourouiba (2020a), Seminara et al. (2020), and Mittal
et al. (2020). The transmitted pathogen dose response of
the recipient is determined by multiple factors, such as
the number, size distribution, and physicochemical properties of the pathogen bearing particles being inhaled or
deposited on mucosal surfaces during a given exposure
time (Haas, 2015). The droplet route is exclusively relevant in the near-field through droplet spray deposition
on persons or objects (creating fomites). The aerosol
routes can be relevant in the near-field upon inhalation
of concentrated clouds of small particles near the emitter
as well as in the far-field when small particles accumulate in indoor environments (e.g., in schools, restaurants,
public transport) or are distributed via directed air flows
(e.g., air conditioning) before significant dilution occurs
(e.g., Birnir and Angheluta, 2020; Bourouiba et al., 2014;
Chang et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020; Jayaweera et al.,
2020; Li et al., 2005; Lu et al., 2020; Nissen et al., 2020;
Qian et al., 2020; Stadnytskyi et al., 2020; Yang et al.,
2020).
The aerosol infection pathway is largely influenced by
individual physiological factors of both the emitter (e.g.,
high individual variation in infectiousness with superspreading individuals) and the recipient (enhanced susceptibility due to pre-existing conditions, co-infections,
etc.) (e.g., Bischoff et al., 2013; Edwards et al., 2021; Leung, 2021; Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005; Miller et al., 2020).
Important is also the timing of maximum pathogen replication with associated exhalation and the encounter of
emitter and recipient. Current evidence on the replication and emission of wild-type SARS-CoV-2, for instance, peaks two to three days prior to and on the first
days of symptom onset (Ferretti et al., 2020; He et al.,
2020; Matricardi et al., 2020). A mechanistic understanding of essential processes in Fig. 1 requires transdisciplinary bridges between infection epidemiology, virology,
pulmonology, and immunology as well as aerosol physics
and chemistry, fluid dynamics, and related fields (Milton,
2020; Morawska, 2006; Santl-Temkiv et al., 2019).
This review article addresses the microphysical particle properties involved in contact-free diseases transmission. It focuses particularly on the concentrations
and size distributions of respiratory particles, as well as
the distribution of pathogens within these carrier particle populations. Section II provides a general and concise
summary of definitions, nomenclature, and key parameters as well as mechanistically relevant information on
droplet formation in the respiratory tract, followed by
rapid droplet desiccation after emission. Section III follows with an in-depth review and synthesis of the scientific literature on respiratory particle size distributions
(PSDs) from breathing, speaking and singing. A general-

5
ized multimodal, lognormal parameterization of exhaled
PSDs is introduced here, which is based on previous observations and parameterization approaches (Asadi et al.,
2019; Chao et al., 2009; Han et al., 2013; Johnson et al.,
2011; Morawska et al., 2009). The new parameterization (i) covers the size range from <10 nm to > 1000 µm,
(ii) is based on the smallest number of modes needed
to adequately represent the available experimental PSDs
weighted both by particle number and volume, (iii) is
widely representative of the existing literature, and (iv)
is readily applicable to modelling studies. The parameterization has further been related to the emission mechanisms and sites in the respiratory tract as well as to
mode-specific particle number concentrations in relation
to different respiratory activities. Finally, using the multimodal parameterization, emission mechanisms and particle size modes are identified, which are most closely
associated with the spread of common pathogens. The
literature summary and consistent parameterization of
the exhaled PSDs can be used as a framework for improved understanding, control, and prevention of infectious disease transmission, such as for COVID-19 and
other present and future diseases, which spread via the
respiratory tract.

II. DEFINITIONS, NOMENCLATURE, AND KEY
PARAMETERS IN AEROSOL AND DROPLET
PATHOGEN TRANSMISSION
A. Definitions and nomenclature on respiratory aerosol and
droplets

A major challenge in the multidisciplinary field of airborne disease transmission is that the different scientific
communities involved often ”don’t speak the same language” (Milton, 2020). Moreover, the terminology is not
always clearly defined or consistently used and, thus can
promote misunderstandings (Roy and Milton, 2004; Tang
et al., 2021). The fundamental terms aerosol and droplet
are used especially inconsistently by different scientific
communities and with different meanings and implications.
The term droplet can convey two broadly different concepts: (i) it is often used as a counterpart for aerosol in
a dichotomous classification of airborne vs (semi)ballistic
transmission routes (see details below). In this sense, the
term droplet is meant to differentiate a particular (large)
particle size regime marked by aerodynamic behavior
separate from the smaller range of the size continuum
of respiratory particles. (ii) Moreover, the term droplet
is also frequently used to mean respiratory particles that
contain water. Note, however, that all respiratory particles comprise significant amounts of water upon exhalation and, thus can be considered as droplets, regardless of size (Bourouiba, 2020a; Tang et al., 2021). Further, the term droplet nuclei is commonly used, within

broadly medically-oriented communities, for the remaining residues after evaporation of respiratory droplets
(Bourouiba et al., 2014; Chao et al., 2009; Niazi et al.,
2020). This use of the terms nucleus or nuclei is somewhat inconsistent from a process perspective. ”Nuclei”,
as defined within the scope of atmospheric physics, are
those particles involved in a nucleation process that lead
to particle growth, e.g., a physical surface on which cloud
droplets or ice crystals initiate growth. The term droplet
nuclei, however, here refers to the end point of droplet
desiccation and, thus, shrinkage of a droplet rather than
growth from a seed nucleus.
The term aerosol is used in some fields as a synonym
for droplet nucleus, whereas communities of physical science typically use the term aerosol to refer to particles
small enough to stay suspended in air for some period
of time (as defined more specifically below). Use of the
term airborne is especially contentious and inconsistently
used within the context of respiratory disease (Klompas
et al., 2020; Li, 2021; Roy and Milton, 2004; Tang et al.,
2021; Tellier et al., 2019). In most sub-fields of the physical sciences the term airborne is associated broadly with
particles that are suspended in or transported through
the air. In this context, both smaller aerosol particles
and droplets can be considered airborne, although the
residence time in air and ability to be inhaled varies
strongly with particle size (Hinds, 1999; Morawska and
Milton, 2020; Prather et al., 2020a; Samet et al., 2021).
For these reasons, the majority of discussion associated
with the term airborne among physical scientists is associated with aerosols (Chen et al., 2020). In stark contrast
to this perspective, non-physical sub-fields of science and
medicine have historically applied additional limitations
to the use of the term airborne, e.g. to aerosol-based diseases with demonstrably high basic reproduction numbers (R0 ) such as measles, but without specific physical
or mechanistic reasoning (Leung, 2021; Li, 2021; Milton,
2020; Tang et al., 2021). A broader discussion of the differences in the way different communities define this term
will not be addressed in detail here. For the purposes of
this discussion, we will adopt a physical perspective of
the term airborne, comprising both smaller aerosols and
larger droplets.
For clarity, we define here the terminology used
throughout this manuscript:
• Aerosol: According to the established text book
definition, an aerosol is defined as a suspension
of liquid or solid particles in a gas, with particle diameters ranging from few nm up to about
100 µm (Frohlich-Nowoisky et al., 2016; Hinds,
1999; Pöschl, 2005; Seinfeld and Pandis, 2016).
Note that sometimes the term aerosols (with plural s) is used to refer specifically to the suspended
particles, which frequently causes confusion in relation to the aforementioned rigorous definition of

6
aerosol, which is already plural with respect to the
particles involved. The term droplet nuclei is frequently used within medical communities to be synonymous with aerosol.

which is the ratio of the resisting force of the viscous
gas to the inertial force of the moving particle, separates
the Stokes regime (with viscous forces >> inertial forces
and Re < 1) from the purely ballistic Newton regime
(with viscous forces << inertial forces and Re > 1000)
with a semi-ballistic transition regime in between (1 <
Re <1000) (Hinds, 1999). Thus, Re quantifies to which
degree the particles are prone to follow the air streams
patterns, e.g., upon inhalation. Re is calculated through

• Droplets: Generally speaking, droplets are liquid
particles. In the medical and epidemiological literature the term droplet is frequently used for aqueous
liquid particles larger than 5 µm in diameter. Here,
the term droplet has been used cautiously to avoid
misunderstandings. We used it only for aqueous
droplets (of all sizes) directly upon emission from
the respiratory tract, regardless of particle size. After the onset of drying (which happens quickly),
the terms residue or dried particle are used for the
partially or fully dried droplets. Note that we avoid
using the term droplet nuclei, because the term nucleus has the aforementioned different meaning in
aerosol physics.

with the density of the gas (ρg ), which is the density of
air here, the relative velocity between air and particle
(vs ), which is here the settling velocity, the particle diameter (D), and the gas dynamic viscosity (η), also for
air here. For a spherical particle in the Stokes regime, vs
is calculated through

• Particles: The term particle refers here to the entire population of liquid or solid particles encompassing the full spectrum of possible sizes, as well
as physical and chemical states.

Throughout the text, we predominantly use the terms
particle and aerosol, and to only a minor degree the term
droplet. Where not clear from the context, we further
specified these terms with attributes defined by physical
properties such as aerodynamic behavior, i.e., airborne vs
(semi-)ballistic, or water content, i.e., wet vs dry/dried.
Often, a particular particle size range is of relevance –
in these cases we have numerically specified the diameter thresholds (e.g., > 1 µm or from 0.1 to 10 µm). To
broadly subdivide the modes of the particle size distribution into two groups according to the commonly applied set of measurement instrumentation (see Tab. IV,
Sect. III.B.2, and Sect. III.B.3), we have used the relative terms small for all modes centered below 5 µm and
large for all modes centered above 5 µm. Note that this
5 µm threshold is not related to the traditionally used
5 µm threshold in a dichotomous classification of aerosol
vs droplet infection routes (see details below). All particle sizes in this manuscript refer to diameter and never
to radius.
Neither the lower nor upper aerosol size ranges have
rigorously defined physical limits: The lower limit is
marked by a gradual transition from gas molecules and
larger molecular clusters to nanometer-sized particles.
The upper limit is given by the gradually changing aerodynamic properties of particles that vary as a function of
size when moving in a gas, the most important of which
is the increased sedimentation rate of large particles due
to gravity. An alternative, but parallel transition at the
upper size limit is the point at which particles become too
big to be efficiently inhalable (e.g., Hinds, 1999; Vincent
et al., 1990). Here, the particle’s Reynolds number (Re),

with the particle density (ρp ), the gravitational acceleration (g), the Cunningham slip correction (Cc ), and λ
as the gas mean-free-path (Hinds, 1999). Cc matters primarily for particles with D < 1 µm and converges to unity
for D > 1 µm. For a spherical particle in the transition
regime, vs is calculated through

with the drag coefficient (CD ). Re for water drops with
D < 80 µm in room conditions is < 1 and so for this size
range, using the Stokes drag would not result in significant errors. Note that the drag coefficient (CD ) in Eq. 3
is an empirical correction, which depends on vs .
Within the Stokes regime and in quiescent/still air,
vs scales with D2 , spanning from essentially infinite
airborne residence times for smaller particles (i.e.,
D < 1 µm) to finite settling velocities for large particles
(Fig. 2). For example, for an exhalation at 1.5 m height,
a 5 µm particle settles out within ∼30 min, a 8 µm particle settles out within ∼10 min, whereas a 20 µm particle
settles out within ∼2 min. In real-world settings, however, the air is typically not still, but rather influenced
by air movements on different scales, including upward
convection due to heating from bodies, and so the particle residence time in the air of occupied rooms is usually

much longer than in still air. The drag of the ambient air
can extend particle residence times significantly (Bazant
and Bush, 2021; Milton, 2020). For non-spherical particles, Eq. 2 should be modified to take particle shape into
account. If particle shape does not deviate clearly from
a sphere, the errors from using Eq. 2 are not significant
(Bagheri and Bonadonna, 2016).
Figure 2 shows that aerosol and droplet transmission
routes cannot be strictly separated, but exist in different size regimes of a particle size and fluid mechanical
continuum. The terminology used to separate the concepts of aerosol and droplet transmission often causes
more confusion than clarity by introducing the false notion that droplets and aerosols are somehow fundamentally different (Beggs, 2020; Bourouiba, 2020b). Further,
historically inaccurate understandings of the physics of
airborne particles persists in many scientific disciplines
today, and deeply held disciplinary beliefs and nomenclature add to the confusion (e.g., Allen and Marr, 2020;
Beggs, 2020; Gralton et al., 2011; Hsiao et al., 2020; Jones
et al., 2020; Li, 2021; Milton, 2020; Roy and Milton, 2004;
Samet et al., 2021; Tang et al., 2021). Bourouiba (2020b),
for instance, criticized the widely used and ”overly simplified [...] dichotomous classification between large vs
small droplets [with] various arbitrary droplet diameter
cutoffs, from 5 to 10 µm”, which still underlies the current risk management, recommendations, and infection
control. Bourouiba (2020b) further proposes to consider
aerosol and droplet spray transmission as a multiphase
turbulent cloud of buoyant hot and moist air that contains a continuous range of particle sizes (Bourouiba,
2020b; Bourouiba et al., 2014; Ng et al., 2020). In this

context, Prather et al. (2020a) advocated that 100 µm
would be a more appropriate threshold than the historically used 5 or 10 µm. All such clear-cut boundaries are
a simplifications of the physics involved. Nevertheless,
if a threshold has to be defined, 100 µm appears as the
most appropriate choice, as it is roughly the diameter at
which Re ≈ 1 and beyond which the drag force acting on
the particle no longer varies linearly with the Re (Fig.2).
It further corresponds to the largest particle size that is
typically inhalable, and so provides compelling practical
benefit with respect to transmission pathways and mitigation strategies.
Concerning the composition of respiratory particles,
we use the following terminology throughout the text:
Mucosal fluids comprise a large group of liquid surface
films (e.g., tear fluid, nasal mucus, bronchial mucus, gastric mucus, sweat, etc.) that cover different parts of the
body or organ surfaces exposed to the external environment (Bansil and Turner, 2006; Schenkels et al., 1995).
These fluids typically have site-specific composition and
fulfill a variety of specific functions. The following two
mucosal fluids play an essential role in respiratory particle emission:
• Saliva is present in the oral cavity, where it is produced by different salivary glands (Humphrey and
Williamson, 2001; Schenkels et al., 1995).
• Epithelial lining fluid (ELF) cover the airfacing surfaces of the lower respiratory tract (LRT).
Note that in addition to ELF, the terms respiratory tract lining fluid (RTLF), airways surface liquid (ASL), and mucus are also widely used in the
literature (Bansil and Turner, 2006). Here we restrict use to the term ELF.
Further, we use the terms mucosalivary or mucosal films
and fluids to refer to both ELF and saliva. An overview of
the complex and variable composition of saliva and ELF
can be found in Sect. II.C. The term respiratory particles
here refers to emissions from both saliva and ELF.

B. Properties of respiratory particles

The physicochemical aerosol properties that matter
most in the spread of diseases are
• particle number and volume
(Sect. II.B.1 and Sect. III.C)

concentration

• particle number and volume size distribution
(Sect. II.B.2 and Sect. III)
• size-dependent distribution of pathogens in the
respiratory carrier particle population (Sect. II.B.3
and Sect. III.D)

8
• composition and hygroscopicity of the mucosalivary particles along with their desiccation and
(re)humidification properties (Sect. II.C)
Further, physical and biochemical properties of the
pathogens themselves play important roles, which are addressed only briefly in Sect. II.B.4. For further details,
refer to the cited literature.
1. Particle number and volume concentrations and emission
rates

The particle number (N ) or volume (Vp ) concentration
(C) in an air volume (Vair ) defines the overall abundance
of exhaled (and potentially pathogen bearing) particles
according to
CN =

and CV =

The particle emission rates (Q) are derived through

and QV = Vp f

and QV = CV V̇

(6)

as well as
QN = CN V̇

with a given N and Vp , the rate (f ) of a given respiratory
event, as well as the air emission rate (V̇ ). Table I summarizes average parameters for respiratory events and
specifies those values used in the calculations in this
work. The particle source is highly variable in terms of
strength and frequency. It spans from semi-continuous
tidal breathing to short and intense events such as sneezing with a duration ∆t < 1 s (Table I). The inter- and
intrasubject variability in CN as a function of respiratory activity and physiological factors is remarkably high,
spanning two to three orders of magnitude from ∼0.1 up
to ∼100 cm−3 (e.g., Asadi et al., 2019; Bake et al., 2017;
Duguid, 1946; Gregson et al., 2021; Holmgren et al., 2010;
Morawska et al., 2009; Schwarz et al., 2015; Xie et al.,
2009). The CN and QN can be converted in CV and QV
through
CV =

and QV =

(7)

under the assumption that the particles have a (nearly)
spherical shape.
Exhaled puffs of air are discontinuous, turbulent fluid
volumes emitted from a point source (mouth or nose)
and driven at first by momentum and subsequently by
buoyancy. The puffs are spatially heterogeneous due to
mixing and dilution in turbulent eddies and variable water vapor and temperature fields, which results in a decrease in CN with distance from the source and, therefore, makes analysis of measurements complicated to interpret (Bourouiba, 2020a; Gregson et al., 2021; Ng et al.,

2020). Note further that the CN levels are typically much
lower than ambient aerosol concentrations (both indoor
and outdoor), which typically range from few hundreds
to few thousands particles per cm3 (e.g., Andreae, 2009;
Vette et al., 2001). This imposes further experimental
challenges since the ambient background aerosol must either be removed (i.e., filtration) or carefully characterized
(i.e., background subtraction). Even in a clean-room environment, however, it is very challenging to detect the
influence of respiratory aerosols on top of existing particle
concentrations unless particles are selectively detected,
e.g., based on differences in composition. For a comparison of respiration CN levels from different studies, it is
essential to specify the measurement size range as most
instruments or techniques cover only a limited band of
the overall relevant size distribution (see Table IV). Thus,
most reported number concentrations do not account for
the total CN , but rather a subset within a certain size
range determined by the instruments’ specifications. As
one result of the parameterization of particle size distributions presented in this study, Sect. III.C presents a
statistical summary of measured particle number and volume concentrations as well as emission rates in relation
to respiratory activities.

2. Particle number and volume size distributions

The initial particle size distribution (PSD) right
immediately following emission depends on the formation mechanisms and sites within the respiratory
tract (Sect. II.D) (e.g., Asadi et al., 2019; Johnson and
Morawska, 2009; Johnson et al., 2011; Morawska et al.,
2009). After emission and rapid evaporation (Sect. II.C),
the PSD determines the aerosol residence time and mobility in the air (e.g., Ng et al., 2020). The particle
movement and transport through air is driven by multiple forces, such as drag, inertial, electrostatic, radiative, gravitational, and thermophoretic forces, as well as
Brownian motion and turbulent diffusion (Hinds, 1999;
Jayaweera et al., 2020; Kulkarni et al., 2011). The influence of these forces strongly depends on the PSD and,
thus, affects transport over distances as well as either dilution or potential enrichment under given air conditions
(Gregson et al., 2021; Hinds, 1999; Lelieveld et al., 2020).
Moreover, the PSD defines the filtration efficiency of face
masks (upon both in- and exhalation) as well as the deposition sites of particles in the upper respiratory tract
(URT) and lower respiratory tract (LRT) (see also Fig. 8)
(Drewnick et al., 2020; Guzman, 2020).
The respiration PSDs have a characteristic multimodal
shape (Asadi et al., 2019; Chao et al., 2009; Han et al.,
2013; Johnson et al., 2011; Morawska et al., 2009; Papineni and Rosenthal, 1997). They can be described well
by a multimode lognormal fit function with n individual

TABLE I Parameters of different respiratory activities/events, summarized from previous studies. The following events are
specified: breathe (event = one exhalation), speak (event = one spoken word of average length), cough (event = one cough), and
sneeze (event = one sneeze). Relevant event-specific parameters are the emitted air volume (Vair ), duration (∆t), and peak flow
rate (q) per event. Relevant time-averaged parameters are the event rate (f ), which is the number of event repetitions per hour,
and the average air emission rate (V̇ ), obtained through V̇ = Vair · f (Tortora and Derrickson, 2017). For speaking, two (short)
words spoken per second were assumed to obtain a speaking-related f , according to Johnson et al. (2011). Several parameters
show an inherently high inter- and intrasubject variability, which is reflected in the table as typical parameter ranges. The
values in brackets show the characteristic values used in calculations in this review article (e.g., Sect. III.C and Sect. III.D).
Values represent the average of male and female adults. Values mostly represent healthy subjects – only for the cough rate,
healthy and diseased subjects are distinguished.

with D as the particle diameter, Di as the mode mean
geometric diameter, Ai as the number concentration at
Di , and σi the modal geometric standard deviation which
defines the mode width (Seinfeld and Pandis, 2016). For
the multimodal lognormal fitting, the smallest possible
number of modes yielding a good representation of the
experimental data is preferred. Ideally, the individual
modes can be associated with the mechanisms and sites
of specific emission processes in the respiratory tract.
Equation 8 has been used throughout this work and in
the parameterization present here. Note, that different
versions of lognormal fit functions have been broadly used
in aerosol studies and in the field of respiratory aerosols
in particular. As an alternative example, the following
Eq. 9 from Heintzenberg (1994) has been used widely
(e.g., Asadi et al., 2019; Chao et al., 2009; Han et al.,

with Di as the mode mean geometric diameter as in

of the mode, and σi as the modal geometric standard deviation. Importantly, both functions Eq. (8) and Eq. (9)
yield the same fitting results. They only differ in the
definition or meaning of the fit parameters.
Essentially all measurements of respiratory aerosols
yield particle number size distributions (NSDs) as primary data (i.e., number of counted particles in a given
sequence of size bins). The NSDs can be converted in size
distributions of the number emission rates (QN ) according to Eq. 5 and f from Table I. Further, the NSDs can
be converted in particle volume size distributions (VSDs)

assuming a (nearly) spherical particle shape.
Inconsistencies and deviations in the PSDs reported
in published literature can presumably be explained by
the highly dynamic properties of the respiratory particle population, along with experimental challenges in its
characterization (e.g., Johnson et al., 2011; Nicas et al.,
2005; Xie et al., 2009). Moreover, many different measurement techniques have been used, each of which can
detect aerosol particles over a narrow band of the overall PSD. To construct a PSD over the full range of particle sizes emitted by human respiration (< 10 nm to
> 1000 µm) requires data from a set of instruments to be
stitched together, each of which may use different physical parameters for detection (i.e., optical, aerodynamic,
physical, or electric mobility sizing). The matching of
PSDs using these different techniques introduces additional uncertainties to be considered in the interpretation of those measurements (Seinfeld and Pandis, 2016).
Section III follows up on this general overview of respiratory particle NSDs and VSDs with a comprehensive summary of the available literature and the development of
an efficient parameterization scheme, representing their
characteristic multimodal shape.

If a given type of pathogen were embedded in emitted particles at a consistent concentration, one would
expect the number of, e.g., virions to increase with particle size, and thus the dose response might scale with
the cumulative particle volume (Fig. 3). If, instead, the
pathogen were embedded with a relatively constant number of virions in a particular (e.g., smaller) particle size
fraction, the dose response would likely rather scale with
the number of inhaled particles in this specific size range
(e.g., a specific mode of the PSD). Size-resolved sampling and detection of airborne pathogens from infected
individuals, which allows important conclusions on the
mixing state, is however experimentally demanding and
corresponding studies are therefore rare (Roy and Milton, 2004). The answer may also be more complicated

3. Size distributions of pathogens within respiratory particle
populations

The pathogen mixing state – which can be defined in
relation to Riemer et al. (2019) as the distribution of
the pathogens across the carrier particle population –
is of prime relevance for a mechanistic understanding of
aerosolization, transport, and deposition (Fennelly, 2020;
Gralton et al., 2011; Zuo et al., 2020). Small pathogens
such as viruses are generally not emitted alone, but are
embedded within (much) larger mucusalivary particles
(Fig. 3) (Cox et al., 2020). Accordingly, the pathogenmucusalivary aerosol can be generally considered as an
internal mixture (Jayaweera et al., 2020; Riemer et al.,
2019; Santarpia et al., 2020a; Vejerano and Marr, 2018).
Note, however, that published data on the pathogen mixing state is sparse and microphysical details are widely
unknown. For example, it is unknown whether small
pathogens, such as virions, are located within the carrier
particles or on their surface, which is relevant for their
exposure to environmental conditions and, thus, their viability (e.g., Pan et al., 2019; Vejerano and Marr, 2018).
It is further unknown, whether respiratory particles hold
one or more pathogen copies (mono- vs poly-pathogen

FIG. 3 Figure illustrates concepts of internal vs external mixing states in relation to pathogen distribution in mucusalivary particle populations. It further emphasizes the difference between mono- and poly-pathogen particles (e.g., Nordsiek et al., 2020). Microscopy images adapted from Vejerano
and Marr (2018) shows laboratory-generated virus-laden and
internally mixed particles as surrogates for authentic respiratory particles. Here, particles comprise salt, glycoprotein, surfactant, and the well-studied Pseudomonas φ6 virions. Green
fluorescence is associated with surfactants, which are assumed
to partition to the φ6 virions. Adapted with permission under

This value is based on one measurement only.

still, e.g. as a mixture between these endpoints, where
virions may be enriched on particle surfaces or in the
bulk, but not completely devoid in the contrasting phase.
The existing studies – especially on M. tuberculosis (Fennelly et al., 2012, 2004b; Patterson et al., 2018), influenza
virus (Fabian et al., 2008; Fennelly, 2020; Lednicky and
Loeb, 2013; Li et al., 2020; Lindsley et al., 2012; Milton et al., 2013), and SARS-CoV-2 (Chia et al., 2020;
Lednicky et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2020; Santarpia et al.,
2020a) – suggest that pathogens are typically enriched
in specific size ranges of the carrier PSD, likely defined
by the particle formation mechanisms and sites, in relation to the site of infection (see Sect. II.D). Furthermore,
PSDs combined with the pathogen number density in
mucusalivary particles determines the infection risk associated with multi-pathogen aerosols, which has been
recently addressed in a new dose-response model (Nordsiek et al., 2020).
Beyond the actually inhaled dose, the mixing state is
further important for the dose-response relationship of a
given pathogen. The size range of the carrier PSD in relation to its particle deposition properties defines which

regions of the URT and LRT are reached. As different
deposition sites in the respiratory tract can show different susceptibilities to a given pathogen, the dose-response
can be size-dependent in terms of the inhaled PSD (e.g.,
Fennelly, 2020; Samet et al., 2021; Teske et al., 2014;
Thomas, 2013). Previous studies have shown clearly
size-dependent infectivities for airborne influenza virions
(Nikitin et al., 2014) as well as M. tuberculosis (Sonkin,
1951; Wells, 1955), both being significantly more infectious if carried in smaller particles. Further, pathogen
deposition in the LRT relative to the URT is often associated with higher severity, morbidity and fatality (e.g.,
Druett et al., 1953; Gralton et al., 2011; Matricardi et al.,
2020; Port et al., 2020; Thomas, 2013; Zuo et al., 2020).
Milton (2012) introduced the concept of anisotropic infection, emphasizing that the clinical severity of certain
disease depend on the mode of acquisition. This means
that differences in pathogen deposition site in the respiratory tract can be associated with dramatic differences
in disease development, ranging from an acute disease
response to a much milder course.

12
4. Decay of pathogen viability in aerosol

Another essential parameter in disease transmission
through the aerosol route is the survival of the corresponding pathogens during airborne transport. The decline in the pathogen’s viability defines the lifetime of its
infectious potential upon airborne transport and must
be considered in infection control measures and risk assessments. The inactivation typically follows a first-order
exponential decay function
Np (t) = Np,0 exp (−k t)

(11)

with Np (t) as the number of airborne and viable
pathogens at a given time t, Np,0 as the initial number
of viable pathogens at t = 0, and k as the inactivation
rate, which further gives the half-life as T1/2 = ln 2/k
(Hitchman, 2020; Knibbs et al., 2014). Various environmental factors, such as temperature, desiccation at low
humidity, radiation, i.e., ultraviolet light, and reactive
gaseous species can damage the pathogens’ lipids, proteins, or nucleic acids and, thus inactivate them (e.g.,
Dabisch et al., 2021; Fennelly, 2020; Leung, 2021; Niazi
et al., 2020; Pica and Bouvier, 2012). An overview of the
effects of temperature and humidity on pathogen viability is provided by Tang (2009). The pathogen viability
further depends on the chemical microenvironment and,
thus on ELF and saliva composition as well as water content (Niazi et al., 2020; Vejerano and Marr, 2018). For
example, ELF and saliva can act as an organic barrier
against environmental exposure after droplet desiccation.
Typical half-lives (T1/2 ) for selected pathogens in aerosol
are summarized in Table II. The variability in T1/2 is
large, and strongly enhanced decay rates were found, e.g.,
for increased temperature and irradiance (Dabisch et al.,
2021; Schuit et al., 2020).

C. Hygroscopic growth and shrinkage of respiratory
particles in relation to their chemical composition and
hygroscopicity

The composition of the exhaled mucosal fluid droplets
is complex, highly variable, and not well characterized
(Niazi et al., 2020; Sarkar et al., 2019). In the respiratory
tract and, thus also in freshly emitted droplets, the fluids
contain large mass fractions of water with >99 % in saliva
(Humphrey and Williamson, 2001) and ∼95 % in ELF
(Bansil and Turner, 2006; Hamed and Fiegel, 2014). Dissolved in the water are various salts acting as electrolytes
and buffers with sodium (Na+ ), potassium (K+ ), and calcium (Ca2+ ) as main cations as well as chloride (Cl – ),
hydrogen carbonate (HCO3 – ), and phosphates (mainly
H2 PO4 – and HPO42 – ) as major anions (see Table III).
Further, a broad variety of organic constituents is either
dissolved or suspended in the water. This includes proteins for defensive purposes (e.g., lysozyme, immunoglob-

ulins), glycoproteins responsible for the viscous and elastic gel-like properties of the fluids (i.e., mucins), as well
as further compounds such as lipids, surfactants (i.e.,
phospholipids), cholesterol, and urea (Bansil and Turner,
2006). For instance, Bredberg et al. (2012) detected more
than 100 different proteins in exhaled particle samples.
Further, the ELF composition changes from the upper
conducting airways towards the alveolar region (Cross
et al., 1994; Holmgren et al., 2011; Lakey et al., 2016; Niazi et al., 2020; van der Vliet and Cross, 2000). Table III
provides a general overview of the main constituents and
specifies typical concentration ranges, however, does not
seek to resolve the entire chemical complexity or variability of the fluids.
The life cycle of the respiratory particles is very dynamic (Martin, 2000). At the moment of exhalation, the
particles are in a liquid state and can be regarded as
droplets of mucosal fluids. The warm (∼37 ℃), watersaturated (∼100 % RH), and particle-laden air leaves
the respiratory tract and typically experiences sudden
changes in temperature and RH (e.g., Chaudhuri et al.,
2020a; Chong et al., 2021; Ng et al., 2020). A frequent
scenario is the exhalation into subsaturated water vapor conditions (i.e., RH < 100 %), such as room air at
typically 40 to 80 % RH (e.g., Chao et al., 2009; Davies
et al., 2021; Drossinos and Stilianakis, 2020; Morawska
et al., 2009). Under these conditions, the particles leave
the respiratory tract at RH ≈ 100 % with an initial diameter (Dexh ). In relation to the particle composition
and the associated hygroscopicity, evaporation of water
occurs fast (i.e., < 1 s) and causes a substantial decrease
in D (Chaudhuri et al., 2020b; Davies et al., 2021; Marr
et al., 2019; Wei and Li, 2015). For complete evaporation, the droplets shrink completely to their dry diameter (Ddry ) defined by the remaining nonvolatile solutes,
whereas at typical intermediate RH levels the droplets
shrink to an equilibrium (wet) diameter (Dwet ) (Holmgren et al., 2011; Morawska et al., 2009; Nicas et al.,
2005). The ratio of the wet diameter as a function of
RH (Dwet (RH)) and the dry diameter (Ddry ) defines the
particles’ growth factor (gd ) as

gd =

Dwet (RH)
.
Ddry

(12)

The cube of gd gives the volume growth factor (gV )
through gV = gd3 . Under certain conditions, such as during mixing of the respiratory puff with cold and humid
outdoor air, also supersaturated water vapor conditions
(i.e., RH > 100 %) can occur (Chong et al., 2021; Ng
et al., 2020). Supersaturation can cause an initial and
significant growth of the droplets, as outlined in more
detail below.

FIG. 4 Drying of saliva proxy droplets consisting of aqueous
NaCl, KCl, and protein (BSA) with dry volume fractions of
NaCl = 0.1, KCl = 0.1, and BSA = 0.8. (A) Thermodynamic modeling: equilibrium diameters plotted against relative humidity (RH) assuming different initial diameters, Dexh
(open circles), upon exhalation at 100 % RH. Steps near 50 %
RH and 40 % RH correspond to efflorescence phase transitions of NaCl and KCl, respectively. (B) Kinetic modeling:
droplet diameters plotted against time assuming different initial diameters Dexh upon exhalation at 99.5 % RH into an
environment at 55 % RH. Solid colored lines represent saliva
proxy droplets with shadings indicating uncertainties related
to different diffusivity parameterizations for semisolid phase

droplets for comparison. Grey squares and dashed grey line
represent the characteristic time of evaporation te (e-folding
time) plotted as a function of initial particle diameter Dexh .

Figure 4 illustrates the drying process for saliva proxy
droplets consisting of an aqueous mixture of salts and
protein.1 It shows, that the droplets – after emission from
the respiratory tract with RH ≈ 100 % into an environment with RH < 100 % – shrink substantially in the initial phase of drying. The shrinkage curve in Fig. 4A represents thermodynamic equilibrium states, however, particles might deviate from the equilibrium curve if changes
in RH are rapid. A droplet’s evaporation time is roughly
2
proportional to Dexh
(Langmuir, 1918; Seinfeld and Pandis, 2016; Wells, 1934; Wells and Wells, 1936) according

in which Dg is the diffusion coefficient of water in the gas
phase, Mw the molar mass of water, and ρw the density of
water. Note that this classical so-called D2 -law is based
on the assumption of isolated, pure liquid droplets evaporating into a homogeneous environment of a given RH
(Chong et al., 2021) and holds for multi-component mixtures only in the early stages of the evaporation process,
when the difference between far-surface water concentration and near-surface water concentration (cg − cgs ) is
approximately constant (Kulmala et al., 1993; Niimura
and Hasegawa, 2019).
The drying dynamics of saliva proxy particles are illustrated in Fig 4B using calculations with the kinetic
multi-layer model of gas-particle interactions in aerosols
and clouds, KM-GAP (Shiraiwa et al., 2012). Processes limiting particle evaporation are the gas-phase diffusion of water molecules away from the particle surface, heat transfer to the particle surface after evaporational cooling, and, potentially, bulk diffusion of water molecules through the partially dried-out salt-protein
matrix. While small particles equilibrate on the millisecond time scale, large particles may take seconds to reach
thermodynamic equilibrium, especially if the diffusion of
water through the salt-protein matrix is slow.
The shadings in Fig 4B illustrate the minor effect of
three different diffusivity parameterizations ranging from
fully liquid particles to particles undergoing a liquid-tosemisolid phase transition and significant drop in water diffusivity between 75 and 80 % RH.2 A Vignes-type

Saliva proxy comprises salts NaCl and KCl and protein bovine
serum albumin, BSA, with volume fractions NaCl = 0.1, KCl =

protein mixture in real saliva (compare Table III).
Diffusivity parameterizations employed for the calculations in
this study include (i) a constant diffusivity of water that would
be expected in pure liquid water droplets Dw = 1 × 10−5 cm2

mixing rule between liquid water and a semi-solid saltprotein matrix yielded near identical results to the fully
liquid scenario.
The grey dotted lines in Fig. 4B show the corresponding drying dynamics of pure NaCl solution droplets, as
shown previously and in good agreement with other modelling approaches (Davies et al., 2021). The KM-GAP
model returns near-identical evaporation speeds for saliva
proxy and NaCl particles. 3 Due to the consumption of
latent heat during evaporation, particles cool to a minimum temperature of ∼ 291.7 K, irrespective of initial
particle size. This temperature lies close to the wet bulb
temperature, which is the lower limit at which net evaporation can still take place under the given ambient conditions.
The grey squares and dashed grey line in Fig. 4B represent the characteristic e-folding time of evaporation te ,
which is the time needed for a droplet to shrink by a
factor of 1/e relative to its initial size Dexh :

It exhibits a D2 -dependence analogous to the droplet
evaporation rate (Eq. 13), which applies as long as the
evaporation kinetics are governed by gas diffusion (rather
than bulk diffusion or phase transitions).
A comparison of these evaporation times with the sedimentation times of larger respiratory droplets – as shown
in Fig. 2 – reveals that the largest droplets (i.e., ∼100 µm
and larger) may settle too fast to reach an equilibrium
state with the ambient RH (Ai and Melikov, 2018; Niazi
et al., 2020; Nicas et al., 2005; Wei and Li, 2015) and
can stay in a water-rich state over their entire lifetime.
Chong et al. (2021) further showed that the influence of
the local RH field around the droplets in the exhaled humid puffs has to be considered as it tends to delay the
evaporation significantly (i.e., factor 30 or even larger).
In this sense, the calculations in Fig. 4B (assuming an
instantaneous change in environment RH to 55 %) represent lower limits of the evaporation times (or upper
limits for the equilibration rate/speed) of characteristic
droplet sizes without the influence of the surrounding puff
of humid exhalation air (de Rivas and Villermaux, 2016;
Villermaux et al., 2017).

Fig. 4B).
Water activity parameterizations for NaCl particles were obtained using the Extended Aerosol Inorganics Model (E-AIM)
(Clegg et al., 1998), water activity in saliva particles was parameterized according to the ZSR model presented in Fig. 5B.

for drying to typical room RH levels (i.e., ∼40 to ∼80 %
RH). This is consistent with the shrinkage expected based
on typical salt concentrations in saliva (Table III): the
drying of a saline solution with ∼1 % NaCl (a typical
value for saliva, from Humphrey and Williamson, 2001)
would result in gd ≈ 6. In previous studies on respiratory
particles, estimates or measurements of gd ranged from
∼2 and ∼6 (e.g., Chaudhuri et al., 2020b; Davies et al.,
2021; Duguid, 1946; Holmgren et al., 2011; Marr et al.,
2019; Niazi et al., 2020; Nicas et al., 2005; Stadnytskyi
et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2021; Wei and Li, 2015).
The hygroscopic growth and shrinkage of the respiratory particles can be calculated by the Köhler theory,
which describes thermodynamic water equilibrium states
between the gas and aqueous phases (Köhler, 1936).
Specifically, it describes the interplay of the enhancement
in water saturation vapor pressure (p0 ) over a curved
relative to a flat surface and the reduction in p0 over a
solute surface relative to pure water. The Köhler theory
has been broadly applied in atmospheric research as it allows to describe and model the water uptake and loss by
ambient aerosol particles under variable RH conditions
(Seinfeld and Pandis, 2016). It has been particularly important to describe the nucleation of cloud droplets by
ambient aerosol particles (Andreae and Rosenfeld, 2008).
The corresponding Köhler equation

with

s = aw Ke


4 σsol Mw
Ke = exp
R T ρw Dwet

(15)

expresses the necessary conditions for an aqueous solution droplet to be in equilibrium state with the water vapor of the surrounding gas. Specifically, it relates the water vapor saturation ratio (s) to the Raoult term, which
is the water activity in the aqueous solution (aw ) and
describes the size and composition dependencies of the
droplet’s solute effect, as well as the Kelvin term (Ke),
which describes the increase in equilibrium water vapor
pressure due to droplet’s surface curvature (Köhler, 1936;
Seinfeld and Pandis, 2016). In Ke, σsol is the solution
droplet’s surface tension, Mw is the molar weight of water, ρw is the water density, R is the universal gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, and Dwet (RH) is the
droplet diameter at a given s or RH, with s = RH/100 %
(Seinfeld and Pandis, 2016). The effect of droplet curvature becomes important for Dwet < 0.1 µm (Eq. 16).
Different approximations and parameterizations exist
to describe aw and σsol as a function of the droplet’s
chemical composition as outlined systematically in Rose
et al. (2008). Typically, σsol is approximated by the surface tension of pure water. A commonly used parameterization of aw is based on the hygroscopicity parameter, κ,
introduced by Petters and Kreidenweis (2007) according

saliva from three healthy, non-smoking individuals.

with V as the volumes of the dry solute (s) and pure

in atmospheric aerosol research (e.g., Mikhailov et al.,
2013; Paramonov et al., 2013; Pöhlker et al., 2018) and
(for ambient aerosol samples) typically ranges from ∼0.1
for organic solutes to ∼0.9 for salts (Andreae and Rosenfeld, 2008). According to Rose et al. (2008) and Petters
and Kreidenweis (2007), κ can be related to fundamental

Figure 5A shows the modelled hygroscopic growth and
shrinkage of pure 100 nm NaCl and KCl particles, which
are both main constituents of saliva (Table III). Both
salts show a pronounced hysteresis in gd with sharp phase
transitions at their deliquescence and efflorescence relative humidities (DRH and ERH). For increasing RH
starting from dry particles (i.e., <ERH), a sudden deliquescence phase transition occurs at DRH ≈ 75 % for
NaCl and at DRH ≈ 85 % for KCl. In the course of the
drying from RH > DRH, the efflorescence phase transitions occur at ERH ≈ 40 % for NaCl and at ERH ≈ 50 %
for KCl (Li et al., 2014). Further shown in Fig. 5A is
the hygroscopic growth curve of BSA as a proxy for the
complex protein mixture in ELF and saliva. The protein (as well as organic compounds in general) shows a
significantly lower gd than the salts and is further characterized by the absence of a hysteresis (Estillore et al.,
2017; Mikhailov et al., 2009). The experimental gd data
points for BSA originate from Mikhailov et al. (2004) and
were fitted by a polynomial three-parameter function according to Kreidenweis et al. (2005) as follows

using k1 = 0.111, k2 = 0.0239, and k3 = −0.131, which
yields a good fit with R2 = 0.953.

FIG. 6 Hygroscopic growth behavior, represented by growth
factor gd , for the reference compounds NaCl, KCl, and the
protein bovine serum albumin (BSA) under supersaturated
water vapor conditions.

Mikhailov et al. (2009) generally defined deliquescence
as a transformation of a solid or semisolid substance into
a liquid aqueous solution, with gas phase water being
absorbed – also called liquefaction/liquescence upon humidification/hydration. Efflorescence is a transformation
of a substance from a liquid aqueous solution into a (semi)solid phase upon water evaporation – also called solidification upon drying/dehydration. Below DRH, the dissolved salts in the particles are supersaturated until the
efflorescence phase transition occurs, which is a kinetically limited, homogeneous nucleation process and depends on particle size as well as impurities (Gao et al.,
2007; Laskina et al., 2015). Accordingly, for NaCl – as a
main constituent in saliva – a range of ERH values from
37 to 50 % has been reported (Laskina et al., 2015; Martin, 2000; Mikhailov et al., 2004, and references therein).
Figure 5A and C show the NaCl ERH at ∼40 %, which is
at the lower end of the aforementioned RH range. DRH
values >50 % are commonly attributed to heterogeneous
nucleation due to the presence of impurities (Lightstone
et al., 2000; Mikhailov et al., 2004; Tang and Munkelwitz,
1994).
Figure 6 relates to Fig. 5A and shows the modelled behavior of gd beyond water saturation into the supersaturated regime. Under certain conditions, such as breathing into cold and humid air, the respiratory particles can
experience an episodic occurrence of supersaturated conditions (Ng et al., 2020). Figure 6 shows that as long as
the supersaturated conditions prevail, the exhaled particles might grow substantially before the onset of droplet
drying in the course of dilution and dissipation of the
exhaled puffs.
As a prediction of the expected hygroscopic behavior
of saliva, the three-compound system with the main con-

17
stituents NaCl, KCl, and BSA was modelled and is shown
in Fig. 5B. The overall gd of multi-compound systems can
usually be approximated accurately as the additive influence of the gd,i from the individual compounds i as well
as their corresponding volume fractions i in the mixture
! 13
gd =

X
i

i gd,i 3

and i =

(20)

with Vsi as the volume of the individual components and
Vs as the total particle volume. This approach is based on
the Zdanovskii—Stokes—Robinson (ZSR) model, which
assumes independent water uptake of individual components in mixtures (Stokes and Robinson, 1966).
The resulting gd of the NaCl-KCl-BSA system in
Fig. 5B is characterized by a hysteresis with two subsequent deliquescence phase transitions, reflecting the influence of both salts. These model predictions were compared to the results of a ’proof-of-concept’ hygroscopicity measurement of authentic saliva and the corresponding data points were added to Fig. 5B.4 The model and
experimental results agree remarkably well, despite the
fact that the NaCl-KCl-BSA system largely simplifies the
chemical complexity of real saliva. The experimental results further underline that a hysteresis in the gd and gV
curves can generally be expected in the hygroscopic behavior of saliva – and presumably also of ELF as both fluids are characterized by similar salt concentrations (Table III). Hygroscopic growth curves for a simulated ELF
system with DRH ∼ 70 % and ERH ∼ 50 % were recently
reported by Davies et al. (2021), which are largely consistent with Fig. 5B. Note in this context that the ERH
of the saliva at ∼38 % is lower than the efflorescence RH
of the constituents NaCl and KCl at ∼41 % and ∼52 %
(Fig. 5C). This can be explained by a suppression of the
efflorescence phase transition by organic compounds and
a corresponding shift of the ERH of the salts to lower
values (Mikhailov et al., 2004, and references therein).

4

The experimental proof-of-concept data in Fig. 5B were obtained
from high humidity tandem differential mobility analyser (HHTDMA) analysis in the RH range from 2 to 99.5 % according to
Mikhailov and Vlasenko (2020) for stimulated saliva from three
healthy, non-smoking individuals. The collected saliva was diluted (1 ml aliquot from each sample mixed with 75 ml of pure
water), filtered through a 5 µm syringe filter (25 mm GD/X, sterile, 6901-2504, GE Healthcare Life Science, Whatman), and nebulized for HHTDMA analysis. The HHTDMA procedure and
data analysis is outlined in detail in Mikhailov and Vlasenko
(2020) and Mikhailov et al. (2020). Briefly, three operation
modes are available for the HHTDMA instrument: a restructuring mode, a hydration mode, and a dehydration mode. The
restructuring mode was used to specify the optimal RH range, in
which initially irregular particles transform into compact spherical particles. In hygroscopic growth experiments, the restructuring mode was coupled in-situ with a conventional hydration or
dehydration mode.

FIG. 7 Hygroscopicity parameter κ in high RH regime
obtained for dried and size-selected (∼100 nm) saliva particles based on HHTDMA measurements (see Fig. 5B). Orange shading indicates uncertainty in κ through error propagation as outline in Mikhailov and Vlasenko (2020). Gray
background shading >92 % RH with increasing κ values suggests that particles underwent liquid-liquid phase separation
(LLPS).

The occurrence of a hysteresis in gd has been discussed as a presumably important microphysical process
in respiratory particles that can affect the viability of embedded pathogens (e.g., Niazi et al., 2020; Vejerano and
Marr, 2018). A hysteresis entails a ’bistability’ in the
humidity dependence within the intermediate humidity
range ERH < RH < DRH, which corresponds to typical indoor RH levels (i.e, ∼40 to ∼80 %) (Niazi et al.,
2021). If the particles are dried from RH > DRH, they
shrink upon continuous evaporative water loss and retain
a certain amount of water in a metastable salt supersaturation state until the ERH is reached. If the particles
are humidified from RH < ERH, they remain as dried
residues until the DRH is reached. This means that for
ERH < RH < DRH, the pathogen-laden particles can
be either dried residues or contain a certain amount of
water, depending on the ’history’ of RH change. It has
been proposed that this effect might help to explain conflicting observations on pathogen survival in relation to
RH (e.g., Niazi et al., 2021, 2020).
A further result of the saliva measurement is the RHdependence of κ in the high humidity regime calculated
with Eq. (18) as shown in Fig. 7. A declining trend in κ
was observed <92 % RH, followed by a sudden increase
>92 % RH. Liu et al. (2018) and Mikhailov et al. (2020)
reported very similar results for atmospherically relevant
purely organic as well as mixed organic-inorganic aerosol
particles. Both studies explained the increasing κ for
high RH with occurrence of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in the particles, which was found to be a
common and important micro-physical process in atmo-

18
spheric aerosols (e.g., Bertram et al., 2011; RenbaumWolff et al., 2016; Song et al., 2017, 2012). This suggests
that LLPS might also be a characteristic phenomenon in
saliva and ELF, again with potentially important implications for pathogen viability (Niazi et al., 2020; Vejerano
and Marr, 2018).

D. Formation mechanisms and sites of respiratory particles

Knowledge of the formation mechanisms of humanexpired particles and the corresponding sites in the respiratory tract is essential for a mechanistic understanding
of airborne pathogen transmission (e.g., Dhand and Li,
2020; Gralton et al., 2011; Johnson et al., 2011; Patterson and Wood, 2019; Wilson et al., 2020, and references
therein). Generally, the formation is driven by a complex combination of shear and film rupture instabilities,
ejecting parts of the mucosalivary films that cover the
air-facing surfaces of the respiratory tract (Bourouiba,
2020a; Grotberg, 2001; Seminara et al., 2020). These
processes are complex as they depend on a variety of factors, such as respiratory activities (e.g., breathe, speak,
and cough), geometries and movements of the air-fluid
interfaces in the respiratory tract, as well as composition and viscoelastic properties of the mucosalivary fluids
(e.g., Anwarul Hasan et al., 2010; Dhand and Li, 2020).
The formation site largely defines the composition of exhaled particles, comprising a variable mixture of ELF
from the LRT and saliva from the URT (see Sect. II.C).
Moreover, pathogens preferentially colonize certain regions of the airways (e.g., van Riel et al., 2007; Shinya
et al., 2006). Thus, expiration particles may carry particularly high pathogen loads if the site of infection is
the same or very close to the site of particle formation
(Gralton et al., 2011; Patterson and Wood, 2019). The
four particle formation mechanisms and associated sites
outlined below and summarized in Fig. 8 are widely discussed and considered as most relevant.

1. Bronchiole fluid film burst mechanism

The bronchiole fluid film burst (BFFB) mechanism – or
bronchiolar particle generation – is illustrated in Fig. 8E.
It produces comparatively small particles (< 1 µm) from
collapsing liquid films (deep) in the lungs (Johnson and
Morawska, 2009; Scheuch, 2020; Schwarz et al., 2020).
During exhalation, the airways partly close, which refers
to a compression and an associated blockage of air passage when the airway walls get in contact (Holmgren
et al., 2010). Figure 9 shows conceptually the breathing patterns that involve the BFFB process. Closure
begins in the lower lungs and progresses toward the upper lung regions with decreasing lung volume (Dollfuss
et al., 1967; Holmgren et al., 2013). During (e.g., normal

tidal) breathing, the terminal bronchioles are considered
as the primary site of airway closure. During the subsequent inhalation, the bronchioles reopen and films of the
ELF are spanned across the passages, forming a blockage
of liquid menisci (Holmgren et al., 2013). When these
films rupture, small particles form similar to soap film
droplets (Lhuissier and Villermaux, 2009; Prather et al.,
2013). These particles are first drawn into the alveoli and
subsequently exhaled, which explains why the concentrations of emitted particles increase towards the end of
an individual expiration (Holmgren et al., 2013; Schwarz
et al., 2010). Exhaled particle concentrations (CN ) decrease upon breath holding at high lung volume due to
diffusion and sedimentation losses in the alveoli, whereas
concentrations increase upon breath holding at low lung
volume due to a closure of more and more bronchioles
with breath holding time (Fabian et al., 2011; Holmgren
et al., 2013; Johnson and Morawska, 2009; Schwarz et al.,
2015).
The BFFB particle formation can be modulated by
different breathing patterns, with the CN of exhaled particles scaling proportionally to the fraction of fully contracted bronchioles (Almstrand et al., 2010; Fabian et al.,
2011; Haslbeck et al., 2010; Holmgren et al., 2013, 2010;
Johnson et al., 2011). Especially exhalation below functional residual capacity (FRC) is related to airway closure and enhanced particle emission (Schwarz et al., 2010;
Tortora and Derrickson, 2017). Schwarz et al. (2010)
showed that the CN is related to the ventilation ratio
VB /VVC through


VB
CN = CT exp b
VVC

(21)

with VB as the breathed air volume, VVC as the vital capacity (Fig. 9, CT as the particle number concentration
during low-volume tidal breathing, and b as an empirical
factor representing the shape of exponential function and
typically ranging between 4 to 12 (Schwarz et al., 2010).
The ventilation ratio for ’normal’ tidal breathing corresponds to ∼0.2 and approximates unity for airway closure
breathing patterns. Further, Schwarz et al. (2010) found
a large intersubject variability in contrast to a high reproducibility in CN for the same individual and suggested
that the properties of the BFFB particle emissions can
serve as a fingerprint for the actual individual lung status.
The BFFB particle production is active upon breathing
and, therefore, also involved in all other respiratory activities (e.g., speak, cough) (Johnson et al., 2011). Thus,
BFFB particle production is considered as potentially important for airborne pathogen transmission from symptomatic as well as presymptomatic, asymptomatic, and
paucisymptomatic infected individuals (e.g., Dhand and
Li, 2020; Scheuch, 2020).

Scheme emphasizes the subdivision into the upper respiratory tract (URT) or extrathoracic airways, reaching from larynx to
mouth and nose, vs the lower respiratory tract (LRT) or tracheobronchial airways, including trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and
alveoli. Note that the four particle formation categories (B–E) are distinguished in the literature and also here primarily by
production sites, whereas the production mechanisms are governed by the same few fluid mechanical principles. Figure relates

2. High-speed and turbulent airflows and airway compression
and vibration

Gas-fluid interactions and especially turbulence induced instabilities at the air-mucus interface (two fluids streaming at largely different speeds relative to each
other) have been discussed widely as particle generation
mechanisms, especially for short and vigorous exspirations such as coughing and sneezing (e.g., Dhand and Li,
2020; Fontes et al., 2020; Holmgren et al., 2010; Moriarty
and Grotberg, 1999; Patterson and Wood, 2019; Wilson
et al., 2020). The central airways, such as the trachea and
main bronchi, with their high-speed and often turbulent
air flows are considered as the region, where this process
is assumed to be most pronounced, whereas air flows in
the small airways are mostly laminar due to the strong increase in cross-sectional area (Dhand and Li, 2020; Hinds,

1999; Holmgren et al., 2010; Johnson and Morawska,
2009; Patterson and Wood, 2019). In such high-speed airflows, the associated interfacial shearing causes KelvinHelmholtz instabilities as interfacial waves of mucus with
increasing amplitude (Fig. 8D). Eventually small droplets
are torn off the crest of these waves or filaments of mucus
are drawn thin and fragmented into droplets (PlateauRayleigh instability) (Dhand and Li, 2020; Seminara
et al., 2020). The critical air speed, which created instabilities at the ELF-air interface is defined by the ELF
layer thickness (typically 5 − 10 µm (Seminara et al.,
2020)), along with its viscoelastic properties and surface
tension (Anwarul Hasan et al., 2010; Dhand and Li, 2020;
Moriarty and Grotberg, 1999). Furthermore, dynamic
compression and vibration of the airways ”squeezes and
loosens mucus and promotes expulsion of foreign material from the airways” (Dhand and Li, 2020). For breath-

as well as deep inhalations and exhalations. Similar representations for a variety of breathing patterns can be found in
previous studies (e.g., Almstrand et al., 2010; Holmgren et al.,
2013; Patterson and Wood, 2019).

related emissions, the turbulence-induced aerosolization
has been excluded as a relevant mechanism since variations in flow rates had essentially no influence on droplet
emissions (Johnson and Morawska, 2009; Schwarz et al.,
2010).

3. Larynx with vocal folds adduction and vibration

Vocal folds adduction and vibration within the larynx
– or laryngeal particle generation – is regarded as relevant mechanism during coughing and sneezing as well as
during vocalizations such as speaking and singing (Asadi
et al., 2019) (Fig. 8B). It has been suggested that the
narrowing of the mucus-bathed folds forms a flow restriction, in which a high-speed air-stream caused sufficient
shear stress at the ELF-air interface to tear off droplets
(Dhand and Li, 2020). Additionally, vigorous vibration
and energetic movement of the ELF-coated folds during
vocalization may create instabilities in the ELF surface
layer and result in particle formation (Morawska et al.,
2009; Moriarty and Grotberg, 1999). It has been further considered that – similar to the BFFB mechanism
– ELF films may form and burst or ELF filaments may
fragment in the open-close cycling of the glottic structure (i.e., the opening between the vocal folds) (Asadi
et al., 2019; Johnson et al., 2011; Patterson and Wood,
2019; Wilson et al., 2020). Some studies suggest that the
vocalization frequency (vocal pitch) modulates the particles’ emission rate and diameters (Asadi et al., 2019;
Morawska et al., 2009).

The upper respiratory tract, and particularly the oral
cavity between lips and epiglottis as well as nasal passage,
is regarded as the main site for large droplet formation
(Abkarian et al., 2020). Here, droplets through fragmentation of liquid sheets and filamentous structures that
are formed from the permanently present saliva in the
course of mouth, lips, and tongue movements (Fig. 8C)
(Johnson et al., 2011; Seminara et al., 2020). Also pulsed
and high velocity air flows, such as coughing and sneezing, cause significant shear forces in the throat, nasal and
buccal passages, creating a droplet spray through KelvinHelmholtz instabilities (Fontes et al., 2020). The velocity
and pressure fields involved strongly depend on anatomy
of the airflow passages as well as the chemical and fluid
properties of the saliva (Fontes et al., 2020).

5. Clinical aerosol-generating procedures

So-termed ”aerosol-generating procedures” (AGPs),
e.g. intubation or high flow nasal oxygen treatments, are
clinical procedures that are labeled as such, because they
can emit aerosols from the patient Klompas et al. (2021).
Aerosols can be generated from the nose, mouth, throat,
or lungs from a patient undergoing various kinds of invasive procedures. From a clinical perspective, these AGPs
have often been considered the one of the only sources of
infectious aerosols from patients with most respiratory
diseases, including COVID-19. The distinction is vitally
important, because protective guidelines are often very
different for situations when healthcare workers expect
to deal with AGPs versus every other situation. When
aerosols are present that could contain pathogens, protective equipment (e.g. masks, respirators, eye coverings)
need to be significantly improved to reduce inhalation of
small airborne particles (i.e. FFP2 or N95 respirators).
Thus, surgical-style procedure masks and face shields are
not sufficient protection whenever aerosols are present,
and so healthcare workers can be left at risk. A survey
of AGPs and the physical properties of aerosols emitted
by these procedures will not be discussed here, in large
part because AGPs have been shown to generally produce fewer aerosols than standard respiratory activities
like breathing, speaking, and coughing (e.g., Brown et al.,
2021; Hamilton et al., 2021; Wilson et al., 2021).

III. MULTIMODAL SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS OF HUMAN
RESPIRATORY PARTICLES AND ITS
PARAMETERIZATION
A. Literature data synthesis and development of a
parameterization scheme

Published, peer-reviewed studies with size distribution
data on human respiratory particles along with information on sampling conditions and parameters have been
collected and summarized in Table IV. The PSDs from
the individual studies have been either obtained from
data tables, if available, or have been digitized from figures. Table IV summarizes all studies with PSDs that
were found. Since not all of them were equally appropriate for the development of a general parmetrization,
the following flags specify in Table IV to what extent the
individual studies were used:
• A: The study was used in the literature and data
synthesis. The reported PSDs agree with the overall parameterization. The size resolution of the reported PSDs is sufficiently high and allows a multimodal fitting with comparatively low uncertainty.
The reported PSDs were further used to calculate
the average parameterizations in Fig. 18 and averaged fit parameters in Table VI.
• B: The study was used in the literature and data
synthesis of this work for comparison only. The
reported PSDs agree with the overall parameterization. The size resolution of the reported PSDs is
comparatively low and fitting entailed rather high
uncertainties. Therefore, the reported PSDs were
not used to calculate the average parameterizations
in Fig. 18 and averaged fit parameters in Table VI.
• C: The corresponding study was not used in the
literature and data synthesis of this work. The
study was omitted for at least one of the following
reasons: (i) data points from the original publication could not be unambiguously digitized (Mürbe
et al., 2020; Papineni and Rosenthal, 1997); (ii) important information for the calculation of concentrations from the PSDs was missing (Han et al.,
2013; Smith et al., 2020), or (iii) fundamental open
questions on the methodology or experimental limitations remained (Yang et al., 2007).
Different instruments and measurements strategies for
respiratory aerosol characterization have been applied
with specific strengths and limitations and were critically evaluated here. Moreover, the individual studies
typically cover only part of the entire aerosol size range.
The characterization of the comparatively low concentrations of respiratory aerosols requires online or offline
techniques that provide full size distributions, ideally also
at high time resolution (up to 1 Hz). The most commonly

applied online instruments are the scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS, manufactured by TSI Inc., St. Paul,
MN, USA) with a nominal size range typically from 0.01
to 0.4 µm, the aerodynamic particle sizer (APS, TSI Inc.)
with a nominal size range from 0.5 to 20 µm, and the
optical particle sizer/counter (OPS/OPC, from different
manufacturers) with a nominal size range typically from
0.3 to 10 µm. For larger particle fractions (i.e., >10 µm),
passive sampling through particle sedimentation or impaction of expelled droplets (often called droplet deposition analysis, DDA) or active sampling through droplet
impaction on solid surfaces (e.g., glass slides or culture
plates) followed by image analysis have been used.
The APS has been a widely used instrument in respiratory aerosol characterization (e.g., Asadi et al., 2019;
Gregson et al., 2021; Johnson and Morawska, 2009; Johnson et al., 2011; Morawska et al., 2009). Different models
of the APS have been used (see Table IV). However, a variety of instrumental issues have been reported for different APS models and, thus caution is required when using
APS-derived size distributions (Armendariz and Leith,
2002; Peters and Leith, 2003; Pfeifer et al., 2016; Volckens and Peters, 2005). While the sizing accuracy of the
APS is generally acceptable, issues with the counting efficiency and instrument’s unit-to-unit variability in certain
size ranges have been reported (Peters and Leith, 2003;
Pfeifer et al., 2016). Generally, Peters and Leith (2003)
showed that the counting efficiency can be strongly sizedepend and varies between different APS models. Particularly relevant for the characterization of expiration
aerosols upon release – which means in humid state – is a
substantially decreased counting efficiency of liquid particles (i.e., declining from 75 % at 0.8 µm to 25 % for 10 µm)
due to impaction losses in the instrument’s flow system
(Volckens and Peters, 2005). Pfeifer et al. (2016) recently
showed a strongly increased unit-to-unit variability (up
to 60 %) for particles smaller 0.9 µm and larger 3 µm,
probably due to different detector sensitivities. Here we
have chosen a conservative approach and limited the size
range of reported APS data to the relatively narrow band
from 0.9 µm to 5 µm, where the counting efficiency is relatively high and unit-to-unit variability relatively low.
Note in this context that Martin et al. (2010) also reported a decline in APS counting efficiency for ambient
aerosols (relative to an OPC) and limited the APS size
range (i.e., to 0.8 µm to 5 µm). The instrumental limitations of the APS have been emphasized in previous studies on expiration aerosols (e.g., Johnson and Morawska,
2009; Morawska et al., 2009). For all other instruments
and sizing strategies the entire reported size ranges (see
Table IV) have been used.
For OPC instruments, polystyrene latex spheres
(PSLs) are typically used for particle size calibration.
The refractive index of PSLs differs from respiratory particles, however, which will effect calculated sizing. Holmgren et al. (2010) provides a size correction of ∼1.6 based

on diluted isotopic water solution of organic and inorganic solutes, which approximates the composition of exhaled particles. This correction was adopted to all OPS
data, if not already implemented in the original studies.
The development of the parameterization followed the
workflow below:
1. Respiration PSDs were obtained from tables or digitized from figures of the original publications.5
The size range of the APS data was limited to 0.9 –
5 µm for aforementioned reasons. For OPC data,
the size bins were corrected according to difference
in the refractive index of calibration and respiratory particles.
2. The data was normalized by the size bin widths to
dC/dlogD and dQ/dlogD, if not already available
as such in the original publications.
3. The PSDs where fitted by a multimodal lognormal
function with least square in number and volume
(NSD and VSD) using Eq. 8. The fitting was conducted with IGOR Pro (version 8.04, Wavemetrics,
Inc., Portland, OR, USA). The fit functions were
iteratively optimized to equally describe both, the
NSD and VSD of a given data set. A fit for a given
PSD was accepted if both NSD and VSD were described in a physically meaningful way with a maximal coefficient of determination (R2 ). As a part of
the fitting process, some fit parameters were constrained, described in detail in the corresponding
parts of Sect. III.
4. After fitting, the NSDs and VSDs were normalized
to allow a comparison between all PSDs of a certain category. Normalization to a specific area under the curve was conducted: (a) for small particles
(D < 5 µm), the overall trimodal PSD were normalized to the area under breath-related bimodal
distribution (i.e., modes B1 and B2, for details see
Sect. III.B.1), (b) for large particles (D > 5 µm),
the overall bimodal PSD was normalized to the area
under the second of both modes (i.e., mode O2, for
details see Sect. III.B.2).
5. Average PSDs were calculated by the arithmetic
means of the corresponding fit parameters, based
on all PSDs flagged with A in Table IV.

B. parameterizations of particle size distributions for
specific respiratory activities
1. Breathing

Breathing is the most fundamental, frequent, and continuous respiratory activity. Speaking, laughing, singing,
coughing, and sneezing involve breathing as an underlying mode. Hence, the development of a parameterization of respiration PSDs should start with a robust representation of breath-related emissions. Several studies
have investigated aerosol formation in relation to different breathing patterns (see Fig. 9), and it is widely supposed that the BFFB mechanism is primarily – if not
exclusively – responsible for the breath-related particle
formation (Sect. II.D) (Bake et al., 2019, 2017; Holmgren and Ljungström, 2011; Holmgren et al., 2010; Johnson and Morawska, 2009). Here, we integrate the published experimental data to parameterize the shape of the
breath PSD. The largely variable particle concentrations
(CN , CV ) and emission rates (QN , QV ) of breath-related
emissions, in relation to other respiratory activities, are
addressed in Sect. III.C. This analysis shows that – after fitting and normalization – all published breath PSDs
agree remarkably well, despite differences in methodology
and variable RH conditions during the measurements.
The experimental basis for the parameterization comprises 34 breath PSDs from 14 studies (see Table IV).
Good data coverage exists for the particle size range
between 0.3 and 5 µm due to the wide use of the instruments APS (Alsved et al., 2020b; Gregson et al.,
2021; Johnson and Morawska, 2009; Johnson et al., 2011;
Morawska et al., 2009) (i.e., 0.9 to 5 µm, see Sect. III.A)
as well as different OPC models (Almstrand et al., 2010,
2009; Fabian et al., 2011, 2008; Hartmann et al., 2020;
Haslbeck et al., 2010; Holmgren et al., 2013, 2010; Mürbe
et al., 2020; Schwarz et al., 2010, 2015) (i.e., 0.3 to 3 µm)
(see Table IV). Studies with data coverage <0.3 µm are
sparse. Holmgren et al. (2010) published the only study
so far with highly size-resolved (SMPS) measurements
with D < 0.3 µm, which covers the peak and overall
shape of the breath PSD. Therefore, we used this data to
parameterize the lower end of the breath PSD. Figure 10
shows the PSDs from Holmgren et al. (2010) and the
corresponding bimodal lognormal fits for tidal breathing vs breathing with airways closure. The fits represent
the PSDs accurately in number and volume representation. Relating to Johnson et al. (2011), we refer to both
bronchiolar breathing modes as B1 (peaking D < 0.1 µm
in NSD) and B2 (peaking D > 0.1 µm in NSD). In the
fits, the position (Di ) and the height (Ai ) of both lognormal modes were free parameters, whereas the width
(σi ) of the modes was fixed to 0.9, This σi value was
iteratively optimized in this work. In fact, an important result of the fitting approach overall is the observation that σi = 0.9 describes the width of all lognormal

modes of respiratory PSDs across multiple studies well.
For comparison, the width of the characteristic modes in
the ambient aerosol is typically smaller with σ ranging
from ∼0.4 to ∼0.6 (Pöhlker et al., 2016). The data in
the studies by Haslbeck et al. (2010) and Schwarz et al.
(2010) – both with sizing data down to 0.1 µm, though
with much lower size resolution – generally support the
bimodal character of the breath PSD.

Figure 10 and Table V show that the resulting Di values for both modes are rather consistent for both breathing patterns and that the difference in PSD shape is
mainly determined by a variable height of mode B2.
Holmgren et al. (2010) attributed mode B2 to the BFFB
mechanism in the terminal bronchioles as it increased
strongly for airway closure relative to tidal breathing
(i.e., AB2 increased by factor 36). They further speculate

breathing (orange line) maneuvers were discriminated according to Holmgren et al. (2010). In the legend, T specifies tidal-like
breathing patterns and C specifies breathing patterns with airway closure. After fitting, all NSDs and VSDs were normalized
to the area under the curve to account for the widely variable breathe aerosol concentrations. The underlying lognormal modes
B1 and B2 are shown as dashed lines. Grey shading in (A) and (C) shows influence of aerosol humidification state based on

that mode B1 may originate from a similar film bursting e.g., at the alveoli openings in the course of alveolar
dynamics during respiration, which (to the best of our
knowledge) so far has remained an unverified hypothesis (Namati et al., 2008; Scarpelli, 1998; Scarpelli and
Hills, 2000). The difference in breath PSD shape can be
well described by the ratio of both mode heights in NSD
representation with AB1 / AB2 = 7.0 for tidal breathing
vs AB1 / AB2 = 0.3 for breathing with airway closure.
These fixed mode height ratios have been used in the
course of our further analyses to constrain multimodal
fits for PSD data that cover (part of) the size range of
mode B2 but not of mode B1.
Figure 11 summarizes all breath PSDs found in the
literature after fitting and normalization. It shows a
consistent picture with essentially all data points falling
within a relatively narrow ’corridor’. Only the VSDs
from Morawska et al. (2009) deviate, for unknown reasons. At first glance, the good agreement of all breath

PSDs is remarkable given that multiple studies with different instruments and data from a large number of volunteers in the experiments are combined here. In fact,
Fig. 11 suggests that breath aerosols are associated with
a characteristic bimodal shape of the PSD without a clear
inter- or intra-subject variability. This is in stark contrast
to the breath-related CN and QN , which are widely variable across individuals (Sect. III.C) (Mürbe et al., 2020;
Schwarz et al., 2010). At second glance though, the consistent PSD shape appears less surprising as the size distribution – after BFFB emission deep in the lung – is
’shaped’ by the transmissibility of the respiratory tract
upon exhalation (Schwarz et al., 2010). This means that
on their way to the mouth or nose certain small particle fractions are removed by diffusional losses and certain large particle fractions are removed by sedimentation
(von der Weiden et al., 2009). In fact, established lung
deposition models, such as the International Commission
on Radiological Protection (ICPR) model (Hinds, 1999),

FIG. 12 Number and volume particle size distributions (NSD
and VSD) for laboratory generated sea spray aerosols (SSA)
based on study by Prather et al. (2013) with lognormal fit
functions (solid lines). The size distributions were not normalized. Sea spray aerosols in Prather et al. (2013) were
generated with three different methods: (i) sintered glass,
(ii) plunging waterfall, and (iii) breaking waves (see differently colored markers). Note that the PSDs of SSA react
sensitively to the bubble size distributions. Data from plunging waterfall and breaking wave were combined and fitted
jointly with monomodal lognormal functions as size distributions were similar. Sintered glass data was fitted with separate bimodal lognormal fit and shows remarkable similarity
to breath aerosol (Fig. 11. The corresponding fit parameters
are summarized in Table V.

show a penetration maximum of the respiratory tract between 0.3 and 0.4 µm, which corresponds with the size
distribution maximum in Fig. 11. Accordingly, the characteristic shape of the breath PSD is presumably determined by both, the BFFB emission mechanism as well as
particle losses upon exhalation.
The fit functions in Fig. 11 were calculated as the averages of all fit parameters from the individually fitted NSDs and represent a robust parameterization of
breath PSDs. The average fit parameters are summarized in Table VI. Across all individual NSDs, mode
B2 ranges between DB2 = 0.15 µm and 0.53 µm (average DB2 = 0.31 µm). The variability in DB2 can presum-

ably be explained by two effects: First, the measured
droplet diameters equilibrate quickly as a function of RH
(Sect. II.C). Therefore, the difference in DB2 of the individual NSDs reflect to some extent the (large) differences in RH under the corresponding measurement conditions (see Table IV). Note that temperature and RH
are poorly defined or undefined in some studies, which
complicates the comparison of different NSDs. For many
studies in Table IV, RH levels ranged between 80 % and
water saturation – a humidity regime, in which a small
∆RH causes a large ∆D (Fig. 4 and Fig. 5). A reference point in this context has been provided by Holmgren et al. (2011), who characterized the RH-related ∆D
by measuring comparable breath NSDs (involving airway
closure) at 75 % vs 99.5 % RH. Here, the NSD at 75 % corresponds to DB2 = 0.18 µm and the NSD at 99.5 % corresponds to DB2 = 0.45 µm, yielding an increase in D by
a factor of 2.5 in good agreement with Fig. 5. The RHrelated difference in mode B2 for both PSDs is shown
in Fig. 11A and C as background shading. It shows that
the RH-related variability in D corresponds well with
the overall scattering of the data points. Second, the different breathing pattern summarized in Fig. 11 and the
associated differences in air residence time in the respiratory tract might also cause certain modulations in the
overall PSD shape (e.g., Holmgren et al., 2013; Johnson
and Morawska, 2009; Schwarz et al., 2010). This effect
seems to be smaller than the RH influence, though further studies are needed.
In Sect. II.D, the mechanistic analogy between respiratory aerosol formation through the BFFB process and
other natural bubble bursting processes, such as sea spray
aerosol (SSA) formation through bubble bursting at the
air-ocean interface, has been pointed out Holmgren et al.
(2010). For further illustration, Fig. 12 shows SSA size
distributions from Prather et al. (2013), generated in the
laboratory with natural sea water through three different
processes. Worth noting here is that the breath aerosol
vs SSA PSDs span across a similar size range and further show some analogies in terms of mode position and
shape (i.e., similar bimodal shape of sintered glass PSD
vs tidal breath PSD). This might reflect the mechanistic
relationship of both aerosol formation processes, however, should probably not be over-interpreted. In this
context, the similarity underlines the general plausibility of the breath PSD parameterizations in Fig. 11 in the
relation to the relatively well characterized SSA size distributions (e.g., Gong et al., 2020; Quinn et al., 2015;
Wex et al., 2016).

2. Speaking and singing

Speaking and singing involve opening or closing of
the glottis as well as tensing and vibrating of the
vocal folds in the larynx, producing – together with

27

FIG. 13 Combined literature data on speaking- and singing-related particle NSDs (A,B) and VSDs (C,D) with parameterization based on five lognormal modes. The modes B1, B2, and LT, centered <5 µm, are described by a trimodal lognormal
fit (A,C). The trimodal distributions in (A) and (C) were normalized to the area under the breath-related bimodal curve
(combined area of modes B1 and B2) to emphasize the relative contribution of mode LT. Grey shading shows variability
of mode LT. The influence of varying RH (i.e., 71.8 % vs 96.7 %) based on experimental data from Morawska et al. (2009)
is illustrated as light blue shading in (A) and (C). Note that this study is an outlier in terms of LT mode position (i.e.,
DLT = 0.45 lowest value observed, which, however, does not diminish its value in specifying the RH-related variability. The
modes O1 and O2, centered >5 µm, are described by mono- or bimodal lognormal fits (B,D). All NSDs and VSDs in (B)
and (D) were normalized to the area under mode O2 to emphasize the relative variability of mode O1. Legend summarizes
information on specific speak and sing activities conducted in the individual studies. For further details, refer to the original
articles directly.

mouth, lips, and tongue movements – a wide spectrum
of sounds (e.g., Abkarian et al., 2020). Both, speaking and singing, are widely variable with, e.g., speaking spanning from whispering to shouting. Speaking is
a relatively frequent and semi-continuous respiratory activity. In relation to speaking, singing is typically characterized by continuous vocalization, higher sound pressure, higher frequencies, deeper breaths, higher peak air
flows and more articulated consonants (Alsved et al.,
2020b). In airborne pathogen transmission, both speaking and singing have been considered as significant driving forces as they are major sources of respiratory particles (e.g., Asadi et al., 2019; Gregson et al., 2021; Mürbe
et al., 2020). Mechanistically, particle formation through
speaking and singing is still somewhat uncertain (Johnson and Morawska, 2009; Johnson et al., 2011). Each
likely involves two or even three formation mechanisms

and sites: (i) laryngeal particle generation, (ii) particle
formation through mouth, lips, and tongue movements,
and (iii) under vigorous conditions probably also highspeed shear forces at the ELF-air interface in the trachea
(e.g., Johnson and Morawska, 2009; Johnson et al., 2011).
The breath-related bronchiolar particle formation is involved as an underlying process.
Figure 13 summarizes the existing experimental data
on speaking- and singing-related particle emissions, spanning across a wide size range from >10 nm to ∼1000 µm.
We found that a parameterization based on five lognormal modes represents the experimental data well. Two
of these modes are the bronchiolar modes B1 and B2
since breathing is inherently involved in speaking and
singing. Beyond the modes B1 and B2 (located at
DB1 = 0.07 µm and DB2 = 0.3 µm), a third mode emerges,
which presumably originates from particle formation in

larynx and trachea (Fig. 13A,C) according to Johnson
et al. (2011). We termed the third mode LT (L and
T for larynx and trachea), accordingly. Based on the
individual NSDs in Fig. 13, mode LT ranges between
DLT = 0.7 µm and 1.5 µm (average DLT = 1.0 µm). Note
that we omitted one outlier at DLT = 0.45 based on the
study by Morawska et al. (2009) in this general statement. In the size range of large particles, the individual
PSDs can be described well by either one or two lognormal modes (Fig. 13B,D). As these large droplets presumably originate from mouth, lips, and tongue movements,
we refer to them as oral modes O1 and O2 (Johnson
et al., 2011). Mode O1 ranges between DO1 = 8 µm and
13 µm (average DO1 = 10 µm) and mode O2 is located between DO2 = 60 µm and 130 µm (average DO2 = 96 µm).
A summary of all average fit parameters can be found in
Table VI. Overall, the five modes have significant overlap
and constitute a rather continuous PSD across more than
five orders of magnitude in D.
The parameterization of speaking- and singing-related
PSDs has been developed separately for two size regimes:
a small particle range <5 µm with modes B1, B2 and LT
(Fig. 13A,C) vs a large particle range >5 µm with modes
O1 and O2 (Fig. 13B,D). This two-step approach was
chosen because the existing experimental data originates
from two ’groups’ of instruments that focus primarily either on the small or the large particle regime. For the
small particle range, the data coverage is comparatively
good between 0.9 and 5 µm, due to predominant use of
the APS (Alsved et al., 2020b; Asadi et al., 2019; Gregson
et al., 2021; Johnson et al., 2011; Morawska et al., 2009).
Data <0.9 µm is relatively sparse and so far based on

et al., 2020; Lai et al., 2011; Mürbe et al., 2020). Overall, we collected 17 speaking-related PSDs from 7 studies
and 4 singing-related PSDs from 2 study for the range
<5 µm (see Table VI). For the analysis of the large particle range between ∼5 to >1000 µm, instruments such as
an open-path laser diffraction droplet sizer (Han et al.,
2013; Smith et al., 2020), sedimentation sampling in combination with microscopy (Duguid, 1946; Johnson et al.,
2011; Loudon and Roberts, 1967a,b; Xie et al., 2009), and
interferometric Mie imaging (Chao et al., 2009) have been
used. We found 7 speaking-related PSDs from 5 studies
and no singing-related PSD for the size range >5 µm (see
Table VI).
In the trimodal lognormal fits of the modes B1, B2,
and LT, some of the 9 fit parameters had to be fixed
because (i) the available experimental data cover only a
comparatively narrow band of the relevant size range and
(ii) the modes are not separately resolved due to significant overlap. Specifically, the parameters DB1 , DB2 , σB1 ,
and σB2 were fixed as they were adapted from the average
breath PSD in Fig. 11. The only exception are two studies (Alsved et al., 2020b; Morawska et al., 2009), in which
the data points resolved part of the mode B2 sufficiently
well so that DB2 could also be implemented as a free fitting parameter. Moreover the ratio AB1 / AB2 = 7.0 for
tidal breathing was fixed, whereas the overall height of
this bimodal fit for B1 and B2 was a free parameter.
For the mode LT, the parameters DLT and ALT were
free, whereas σLT was fixed to 0.9 for reasons outlined in
Sect. III.B.1. In the bimodal lognormal fits of the modes
O1 and O2, all fit parameters (i.e., DO1 , DO2 , AO1 , AO2 ,
σO1 , and σO2 ) were free because the experimental data
cover the relevant size range well and the modes O1 and

FIG. 14 Number aerosol size distributions (NSD) for different speaking and singing maneuvers from multiple studies with
trimodal lognormal fit functions (solid black line). Panel (A) shows tidal breathing with underlying modes B1 and B2 in
relation to Fig. 10A to emphasize the emerging third speaking- and singing-related mode LT. Strength of mode LT appears to
increase with increasingly ’vigorous’ speaking and/or singing. As tidal breathe underlies all speaking and singing maneuvers,
tidal breath-related bimodal fit from Fig. 10A (with fixed ratio AB1 / AB2 = 7.0) has been used in all trimodal fits here.
Underlying modes B1 and B2 are marked by grey shading in all panels. The individual size distributions here were not
normalized. All three modes B1, B2, and LT are shown as black dashed lines.

O2 were sufficiently separated. Note that also in these
fits, where σi was implemented as a free parameters, σO1
and σO2 values close to 0.9 were obtained, which underlines that this lognormal peak width is a good representation for respiration PSD modes overall.
Figure 13 shows the variability of mode LT on top of
the modes B1 and B2. We found no systematic changes
in DLT as a function of speak or sing activities as illustrated in Fig. 14. This suggests that the shape of the
trimodal distribution is generally consistent for different
speak and sing activities, which is in line with previous studies reporting no major changes in PSD shape
in relation to vocalization, loudness, and language spoken (Asadi et al., 2019; Gregson et al., 2021; Mürbe
et al., 2020). In contrast, the ratio of the modes B2
and LT varies widely from AB2 / ALT = 180 (dominated

by the breath-related mode B2) to 0.06 (dominated by
the speaking- or singing-related mode LT). Here, the calculation of AB2 / ALT is associated with some uncertainty
since most available speaking- and singing-related PSDs
do not reach below 0.9 µm and, therefore, cover mode B2
only partly. Figure 14 suggests that the ratio AB2 / ALT
depends on the intensity of the speaking or singing activities, which is also in line with previous evidence (Asadi
et al., 2019; Gregson et al., 2021). Here, the tidal breathe
example in Fig. 14A serve as a reference case for the range
of speak and sing activities from whispering in Fig. 14B
to load singing in Fig. 14I. In relation to the general variability of the mode LT, Fig. 13A and C emphasize that
the RH influence on mode position and shape is comparatively small.

30
Mode O2 was found for all individual PSDs in Fig. 13B
and D. The presence of mode O1 is less conclusive
though. It is clearly resolved in three studies (Chao et al.,
2009; Duguid, 1946; Loudon and Roberts, 1967a) and appears to be absent in one study (Johnson et al., 2011).
Specifically, in the three PSDs in Xie et al. (2009), mode
O1 was clearly resolved in one of them and absent in
the other two. The ratio of the mode heights AO1 /AO2
varies largely from ∼10 in Duguid (1946) to ∼0.14 in
Xie et al. (2009). The ambiguous finding on mode O1
can potentially be explained by either experimental issues such as particle drying dynamics and, therefore, observations in different non-equilibrium states or different
sensitivities of the instruments used in this particular size
range. Further, the rather variable appearance of mode
O1 could potentially also be caused by mechanistic difference in the course of droplet formation in the mouth.
The remarkable differences among the PSDs in Xie et al.
(2009) (which were taken under comparable conditions
and with the same technique) suggest that the presence
of mode O1 indeed depends on differences in e.g., saliva
composition. This particular study focused on the PSDs
in relation to the use of food dye in the mouth for better
microscopic detection of settled particles. Here, mode
O1 was present when sugar and dye were used, whereas
mode O1 was absent when no dye was used. Clearly,
further studies are needed to extent our knowledge on
speaking- and singing-related emission in this large particle range.
Regarding the drying dynamics and measurements under non-equilibrium states, Fig. 4B shows that the evaporation times of particles in the smaller modes B1, B2,
and LT is comparatively short, which implies that these
particle were likely dried to a significant extent under
the experimental conditions of most studies in Table IV.
For the particles in the larger modes O1 and O2, however, Fig. 4B shows comparatively long evaporation times
– especially if evaporation delays as shown in Chong
et al. (2021) are taken into account – which implies
that these particles were likely measured under nonequilibrium conditions. Accordingly, these kinetic effects
probably entail that the extent of drying decreases from
mode B1 towards O2. For Fig. 13, this presumably entails that the modes O1 and O2 are shifted to larger
diameters and would move closer towards the mode LT,
if they were dried to the equilibrium state under the given
RH conditions.

3. Coughing and sneezing

Coughing is caused by an abrupt parting of the vocal
folds and an associated sudden expulsion of air (Grotberg, 2001; Morawska et al., 2009). Sneezing is a sudden violent spasmodic expiration with a blast of air
being driven through the nasal and mouth chambers

(Brubaker, 1919; Fontes et al., 2020; Han et al., 2013).
Both are short, non-continuous, and vigorous respiratory
activities associated with an ejection of ELF and saliva.
Traditionally, they have been regarded as main drivers
for pathogen transmission (e.g., Bourouiba et al., 2014;
Dhand and Li, 2020). Similar to speaking and singing,
(i) laryngeal aerosol generation, (ii) droplet formation
through mouth, lips, and tongue movements, and (iii)
high-speed shear forces at the ELF-air interface in the
trachea and (main) bronchi are probably the relevant formation mechanisms and sites (Johnson and Morawska,
2009; Johnson et al., 2011; Patterson and Wood, 2019).
The breath-related bronchiolar particle formation is involved as an underlying process. Compared to breathing
and speaking, the available data on cough- and sneezingrelated particle formation is relatively sparse: for the size
range <5 µm, we found 5 PSDs from 5 studies for coughing and no PSD for sneezing. For the size range >5 µm,
we found 5 PSDs from 5 studies for coughing and 1 PSD
for sneezing.
Figure 15 summarizes the experimental data on coughrelated particle emissions in the size range from >10 nm
to ∼1000 µm. The PSD shape is similar to the speakingand singing-related PSDs and can also be described
by five lognormal modes (Fig. 13). In addition to the
bronchiolar modes B1 and B2, the LT mode emerges,
similar to speaking and singing. The mode LT is located between DLT = 0.8 µm and 1.2 µm (on average
DLT = 1.0 µm). The mode height ratio AB2 /ALT ranges
from 20 to 7.5 and is therefore higher than the ratio
AB2 /ALT for speaking- and singing-related PSDs, which
means that the cough-related mode LT is weaker than
the speaking- and singing-related mode LT, relative to
mode B2 (at least within the scope of the data reviewed
here).
The large particle size range can be represented by
two oral modes O1 and O2 as for speaking and singing
(Johnson et al., 2011). Mode O1 is located between
DO1 = 8 µm and 13 µm (on average DO1 = 11 µm). Mode
O2 is located between DO2 = 90 µm and 200 µm (on average DO2 = 128 µm). The mode height ratio AO1 /AO2
is rather variable, ranging from 0 in Duguid (1946) to
∼16 in Loudon and Roberts (1967a,b). Similar to speaking and singing, mode O2 is present in all five studies,
whereas mode O1 is present in three studies (Chao et al.,
2009; Duguid, 1946; Loudon and Roberts, 1967a) and
absent in two studies (Johnson et al., 2011; Xie et al.,
2009). The PSD for sneezing for the large particle size
range based on Duguid (1946) shows mode positions
DO1 = 8 and DO2 = 130 as well as a mode height ratio
AO1 /AO2 = 48. A summary of all average fit parameters can be found in Table VI.
A remarkable observation is the similarity between
speaking-/singing-related vs coughing-related PSDs in
terms of properties of all five modes (compare Figs. 13
and 15). This suggests that for both respiratory activi-

size distributions, VSDs, (C,D) and parameterization based on five lognormal modes. Figure is closely related to Fig. 13.
The modes B1, B2, and LT, centered <5 µm, are described by a trimodal lognormal fit (A,C). The trimodal distributions in
(A) and (C) were normalized to the area under the breath-related bimodal curve (combined area of modes B1 and B2) to
emphasize the relative contribution of mode LT. The modes O1 and O2, centered >5 µm, are described by mono- or bimodal
lognormal fits (B,D). All NSDs and VSDs in (B) and (D) were normalized to the area under mode O2 to emphasize the
relative variability of mode O1.

ties the modes LT, O1, and O2 are formed by the same
or at least similar mechanisms in the respiratory tract.
Another remarkable observation is that the sneezingrelated PSD in Fig. 15B and D resembles the corresponding coughing-related PSDs. At least in the range of
modes O1 and O2), both respiratory activities can be
described by a similar PSD, at least within the scope
of data in Fig. 15. Note that PSD data on sneezing is
generally sparse. Besides Duguid (1946), also Han et al.
(2013) reported sneeze PSDs, which, however, could not
be implemented in Fig. 15 due to difficulties with normalization. 6 Nevertheless, qualitatively the data from Han

Since the area under mode O2 was used for normalization in
Fig. 15B and D and not all PSDs in Han et al. (2013) showed
mode O2, the data could not consistently be normalized. Furthermore, the PSDs were only provided in relative and not in
absolute terms so that no mode-specific particle number and volume concentrations could be retrieved for the further steps of our
analysis.

et al. (2013) are mostly consistent with Fig. 15 as about
half of the their PSDs show a bimodal PSDs with one
mode at ∼70 µm, corresponding to mode O2. In their
data, another mode is reported at ∼400 µm, indicating
the presence of an additional mode O3, although comprising very low particle concentrations. The other half
of PSDs in Han et al. (2013) is monomodal showing mode
O3 only.

C. Number concentrations and emission rates

The previous sections focused on the shape of the
PSDs and developed a consistent parameterization of
their multimodal character. Here, we used the multimodal parameterization to calculate and summarize the
statistics of mode-specific properties in Fig. 16, such as
number and volume concentrations (CN , CV ) as well as
number and volume emission rates (QN , QV ) based on
the available studies with quantitative PSDs (flag A in

FIG. 16 Statistical summary of mode-specific particle concentrations (C), emission rates (Q), and peak diameters (D) for
individual modes B1, B2, LT, O1, and O2. Figure illustrates the wide variability of C and Q across several orders of
magnitude. Particle concentrations and emission rates are provided for number and volume (CN vs CV and QN vs QV ).
Further, the ratios of CN of adjacent modes (CN (i)/CN (i + 1)), derived from individual studies with PSD data covering two
or more modes (i.e., CN (B1)/CN (B2), CN (B2)/CN (LT), CN (LT)/CN (O1), and CN (O1)/CN (O2)) are shown. Colored markers
(short vertical lines) distinguish between respiratory activities (see legend). In the box-whisker plots, the boxes represent the 25
and 75 percentiles, the grey lines the medians, the blue diamond markers the means and the whiskers the 9 and 91 percentiles.

Table IV). Consistent with previous studies (e.g., Asadi
et al., 2019; Bake et al., 2017; Gregson et al., 2021; Holmgren et al., 2010; Mürbe et al., 2020; Schwarz et al., 2015;
Xie et al., 2009), the obtained C and Q levels are highly
variable and span across several orders of magnitude.
The large variability in Q among infected individuals has
been considered as a potential explanation for the existence of superspreaders in infectious disease transmission
as they emit much more potentially pathogen-laden particles than others (e.g., Asadi et al., 2019; Bischoff et al.,
2013; Edwards et al., 2021).
On average, the highest CN and QN levels were found
for the modes B1 and B2, which then decrease via mode
LT to modes O1 and O2. The opposite trend – a strong
increase from mode B1 to O2 – was found for CV and QV
since the volume scales with D3 and, therefore overcompensates the decreasing trend in number representation.
Figure 16F shows the comparatively low variability of the
peak position of individual modes and further emphasizes
that some modes (i.e., B2 and LT) overlap significantly,
whereas others (i.e., O1 and O2) appear rather well separated. The ratios CN (i)/CN (i + 1) in Fig. 16C shows
that the variability of the relative strength of individual modes is rather high (compare with Sect. III.B.2 and
Sect. III.B.3).

Both the particle concentration and emission flux for
a given respiratory activity are relevant quantities for
a better understanding of airborne disease transmission,
which can in principle occur in the near-field or far-field
(Fig. 1). Figure 17 provides total C and Q levels for selected particle size ranges to emphasize the relative importance of breathing, speaking, and coughing in nearand far-field scenarios of disease transmission.
In a potential near-field aerosol transmission scenario,
the recipient is located closely (few meters) to the emitter and inhales her/his concentrated particle puff(s) relatively soon after release (Fig. 17A). Thus, the time span
between emission and inhalation is presumably too short
for particle cloud dilution as well as large particle sedimentation to occur to a significant degree. Thus, Fig. 17B
and C compare the total CN and CV levels for the size
range from 0.1 to 100 µm. Here, 0.1 µm was chosen as a
lower limit as it is the physical size of, e.g., SARS-CoV-2
and infuenza virions (see Sect. III.D). Coughing as well as
presumably also sneezing (not shown here due to sparse
data availability) causes the highest concentrations in the
near-field aerosol cloud. For CN in the range from 0.1
to 100 µm, coughing clearly exceeds speaking, which is
closely followed by breathing. For CV in the range from
0.1 to 100 µm, coughing is highest, comparatively closely

33

FIG. 17 Total number and volume concentrations (CN , CV ) as well as emission rates (QN , QV ) of exhaled particles for different
respiratory activities. Two different particle size ranges were chosen to compare conditions under near- vs far-field disease
transmission scenarios: (i) In the near-field (A–C), CN and CV in the exhaled puff(s) prior to dilution and dissipation are
primarily relevant. Here, a lower threshold of 0.1 µm (typical size of virus pathogens, Fig. 19) and an upper threshold of 100 µm
(upper limit of common aerosol definitions, see Sect. II.A) were chosen. (ii) In the far-field (D–F), QN and QV are primarily
relevant, especially if emission extends over longer periods. Here, a lower threshold of 0.1 µm and an upper threshold of 5 µm
(particles below this threshold have particularly long residence time in air, Fig. 2) were chosen. In addition, C and Q across
the entire size range of the parameterization (i.e., 0.002 to 4000 µm) are shown in all cases for reference. The total CN and CV
as well as QN and QV values were derived as the integral under the average multimodal PSDs (e.g., Fig. 19B and C).

followed by speaking, and breathing being significantly
smaller. These trends in number and volume representation result from the differences in the multimodal shape
of the corresponding PSDs and have to be considered in
the choice of either CN or CV for risk assessments.
In a potential far-field aerosol transmission scenario,
an infected individual emits pathogen-laden particles and
those can accumulate over time in confined spaces, such
as a restaurant room or public transport (Fig. 17D) (e.g.,
Azimi et al., 2021; Birnir and Angheluta, 2020; Hwang
et al., 2021; Kohanski et al., 2020; Lelieveld et al., 2020).
If critical pathogen concentrations can build up in room
air, depends on multiple factors, such as particle size,
room size, ventilation rates etc (e.g., Lai, 2002; Nazaroff,
2016; Riley et al., 2002, and references therein). Infection
risks depend on the airborne pathogen concentrations,
exposure times, and the recipient’s susceptibility. Here,
the source strength, which is represented by the particle emission rate as a function of respiratory activities, is
of primary relevance. To emphasize the different source
strengths of breathing, speaking, and coughing, we focus
on the particle size range from 0.1 to 5 µm, comprising
those particles with particularly long airborne residence
times. Figure 17E and F shows that in a far-field sce-

nario speaking clearly dominates in QN and QV in the
range from 0.1 to 5 µm, followed by coughing and then
breathing. This suggests that speaking might be a particularly important driver for airborne transmission as it
represents a comparatively strong particle source and further occurs more frequent/continuous that, e.g., coughing. Note further that the transmission of SARS-CoV-2
occurs mostly pre-symptomatically, which further diminishes the supposed relevance of coughing and emphasizes
the supposed importance of speaking.

D. Multi-modality of size distributions in airborne disease
transmission

Figure 18 combines main findings of this review and
data synthesis and emphasizes that a detailed understanding of the multimodal shape of the respiration PSDs
provides novel mechanistic insight into airborne disease
transmission and the effectiveness of preventative measures (Johnson et al., 2011). An important parameter
for the transport of viruses, bacteria, as well as bacterial
or fungal spores by respiratory particles is the pathogen’s
size. Figure 18A, summarizes the size of selected aerosol

34
transmissible pathogens, such as rhinoviruses (one of the
agent groups causing the ’common cold’) (e.g., Fabian
et al., 2011; Pitkaranta and Hayden, 1998), measles morbilliviruses (e.g., Liljeroos et al., 2011), SARS-CoV-2
(e.g., Ke et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020),
influenza viruses (e.g., Enoki et al., 2012; Mosley and
Wyckoff, 1946; Rossman and Lamb, 2011) and M. tuberculosis (e.g., Schafer, 1999). The pathogen size defines the lower limit for the respiratory particle size range
that is relevant for pathogen transport. Figure 18B and
C combine the parameterizations for different respiratory activities, in relation to the average mode-specific
emission rates from Fig. 16 and Fig. 17. The breathrelated bimodal PSD is shown in relation to the speakingand singing-related as well as cough-related pentamodal
PSDs, yielding a coherent overall picture. The comparison shows that all viruses in Fig. 18A are in principle
small enough to be transmitted with all five modes. For
the larger M. tuberculosis, the modes B1 and B2 can presumably be excluded as potential carriers, which leaves
the modes LT, O1, and O2 for transmission.
Particularly valuable – but also sparse since difficult
to obtain – is experimental data on the actual pathogen
size distributions in the carrier aerosol as introduced in
Sect. II.B.3. It provides evidence on the modes, in which
the pathogens are actually being transmitted. The available data from size-resolved sampling of airborne M. tuberculosis, influenza virions, and SARS-CoV-2 virions are
shown in Fig. 18D, E and F. Generally, the available data
suggest that these pathogens are enriched in a certain size
range of the overall PSD, which presumably reflects the
sites of infection and particle formation in the respiratory
tract. Note however, that the number of existing studies
is small and certain parts of the overall size range (i.e.,
> 10 µm) have not been investigated with size-resolved
sampling approaches, yet.7
Under the assumption that airborne pathogen transmission is driven by specific respiratory activities and
their associated PSD modes, we applied the previously
defined parameterization to the pathogen size distribu-

Different aerosol samplers were used in the studies summarized
in Fig. 18D, E and F: (i) the Sioutas five-stage personal cascade
impactor (SKC, Inc.) (described in Misra et al., 2002; Singh
et al., 2003) and (used in Lednicky et al., 2021; Lednicky and
Loeb, 2013; Liu et al., 2020); (ii) the cascade cyclone of the
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)
sampler (described in Cao et al., 2011) and (used in Chia et al.,
2020; Lindsley et al., 2010; Santarpia et al., 2020a); (iii) the Andersen six-stage cascade impactor (described in Fennelly et al.,
2015) and (used in Fennelly et al., 2012, 2004b; Patterson et al.,
2018), and (iv) a two-stage slit impactor with an intermediate
condensational growth step as part of the G-II sampling setup
(described in McDevitt et al., 2013) and (used in Milton et al.,
2013). Strengths and limitations of the individual sampling approaches have to be kept in mind when results are compared
(further information can be found in Mainelis, 2020).

tions. Specifically, we described the size-resolved concentrations of the pathogens – i.e., ribonucleic acid (RNA)
copies for virions and culture forming unit (CFU) for
M. tuberculosis – by the previously defined mode properties (see Table VI). Here, the position (Di ) and width
(σi ) of the mode(s) were mostly constrained and only
slightly adjusted, whereas the number of modes (one or
two) as well as their heights (Ai ) were scaled to represent the pathogen size distributions best. In all cases,
the pathogen size distributions could be described consistently with one to three of the modes B2, LT, and O1.
This approach holds uncertainties, especially due to the
small number of data sets as well as the comparatively
coarse size resolution (e.g., three to six size bins only).
Nevertheless, Fig. 18D, E and F show conceptually that
the pathogen size distributions can be described consistently with an underlying modal structure in agreement
with the overall PSD parameterization.
M. tuberculosis in Fig. 18D was sampled by Fennelly et al. (2012, 2004b) and Patterson et al. (2018)
from infected and coughing individuals and the resulting pathogen size distributions can be fitted well by the
cough-related mode LT. The agreement between the M.
tuberculosis size distributions and mode LT is remarkably consistent. The M. tuberculosis size distribution
decreases towards the modes B1 and B2, which is consistent with the fact that those exhaled particles are too
small for pathogen transport. Moreover, the M. tuberculosis size distribution decreases (rather steeply) towards
the modes O1 and O2, which suggests that also these
modes may not play a primary role in TB transmission.
It has to be kept in mind, however, that large particles are
particular prone to impaction and sedimentation losses
in the sampling setup and that the potential influence
of such sampling artifacts on the shape of the pathogen
size distribution has to be critically evaluated (Mainelis,
2020; Niazi et al., 2020; von der Weiden et al., 2009).
The size distributions of airborne influenza virions,
obtained from breathing (Fabian et al., 2008; Fennelly,
2020; Milton et al., 2013) and coughing (Lindsley et al.,
2010) individuals as well as from mixed respiratory activities (Lednicky and Loeb, 2013) are shown in Fig. 18E.8
The breath-related influenza size distributions suggest a

The upper limit of the largest size bin is not specified on all studies or pre-defined by the design of the samplers. It is needed, however, for the normalization of concentrations to the bin widths.
Lednicky et al. (2021) and Liu et al. (2020) define 10 µm as upper limit of the largest size bin. For all other influenza- and
SARS-CoV-2-related studies (Chia et al., 2020; Lednicky and
Loeb, 2013; Milton et al., 2013; Santarpia et al., 2020a) 10 µm
were chosen here as well for consistency. Note also that 20 µm
was tested instead of 10 µm as an upper size limit and did not
affect the bin width-normalized concentration of the corresponding size bin significantly. The lower size threshold of the smallest
size bin was set to 0.1 µm, which is given by the average size of
the SARS-CoV-2 virions.

FIG. 18 Synthesis figure emphasizing the relevance of the multimodal character of the exhaled particle size distribution (PSD)
in airborne disease transmission. Figure combines the PSD parameterization (B & C) with the size of selected pathogens
(physical diameter, Dp , for all viruses and aerodynamic diameter, Da , for M. tuberculosis) as a lower limit for pathogen
carriage (A), measured size distributions of selected pathogens embedded in respiratory particles (D – F), deposition properties
of the respiratory tract (ICPR model) (G), and filtration efficacy of face masks (H). D – F: The pathogen size distributions
were obtained from the original studies (see legend), bin-normalized, and converted in pathogen entities per air volume. The
legend further specifies involved respiratory activities (bold, black font) and activities that might be involved as well (gray
font). The parameterization was applied to the pathogen size distributions by adapting the position(s) and width(s) of modes
B2, LT, and O1 (with only slight changes) and freely adjusting the mode height(s). H: Face mask transmission curves were
measured at high air velocity, with surgical mask transmissibility representing the average of three types of surgical masks and

predominance of mode B2 without strong contributions
by mode LT. This underlines a statement by Scheuch
(2020) that ”breathing is enough” for the transmission
of influenza. Furthermore consistent with our results
(Sect. III.B.3) is that the cough-related influenza size distribution involves the mode B2 as well as the modes
LT and O1, which both occur in relation to coughing. The low size resolution bears rather large uncertainties regarding the relative contributions from modes
LT and O1. Nevertheless, a co-occurrence of both
these modes would be expected for coughing according
to Sect. III.B.3. The upper size limit of the sampling at
∼10 µm does not allow solid conclusions on the influenza
abundance in modes O1 and particularly O2. Overall,
these results underline previous observations of influenza
virions especially in the small aerosol size range and emphasize that essentially all respiratory activities might be
driving forces in the spread of this virus (e.g., Bischoff
et al., 2013; Cowling et al., 2013; Leung et al., 2020; Milton et al., 2013; Shiu et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2018).
The four available SARS-CoV-2 size distributions with
at least two size bins based on studies by Santarpia et al.
(2020a), Liu et al. (2020), Lednicky et al. (2021), and
Chia et al. (2020) are summarized in Fig. 18F. In the
studies by Santarpia et al. (2020a), Liu et al. (2020), and
Chia et al. (2020), the sampling did not target specific
respiratory activities, but was rather conducted inside
hospital rooms with COVID-19 patients. Presumably,
the sampling probed a mixture of breathing, coughing
(a common symptom of COVID-19), and probably also
speaking. Chia et al. (2020) specified that the sampled
patients were coughing. In the study by Lednicky et al.
(2021), aerosol samples were collected inside a car driven
by a COVID-19 patient with a mild clinical course of
the disease and, thus an unknown mixture of respiratory
activities was probed. The size distributions show a similar bimodal shape and the mode B2 could be allocated
to them rather clearly, which suggests that COVID-19 is
also transmissible by breathing (Scheuch, 2020). Further
a second mode centered between the modes LT and O1
is resolved. This suggests that also the modes LT and/or
O1 from speaking/singing or coughing can be drivers in
COVID-19 transmission. Generally, the cough-related influenza and both SARS-CoV-2 size distributions show a
rather similar bimodal shape, which might indicate mechanistic analogies in transmission mechanisms of both diseases.
Beyond aerosol emission and transport from host to
host, the size-dependent deposition of pathogen-laden
particles throughout the human respiratory tract is of
critical importance. Figure 18G shows the established
ICPR deposition model, distinguishing deposition in the
alveolar, tracheobronchiolar, and head airways, which is
driven by the size-dependent influences of diffusion, impaction, and sedimentation particle losses. Here, a detailed understanding of the modality of the inhaled PSD

FIG. 19 Effects of particle deposition in respiratory tract
and face mask filtration on speaking-related particle size distribution (PSD, here number emission rate, QN , adapted from
Fig. 18B). Figure compares (i) PSD after emission, (ii) fraction of PSD deposited in respiratory tract (compare Fig. 18G),
and (iii) fraction of PSD deposited in respiratory tract after filtration through community masks, surgical masks, and
FFP2 masks (compare Fig. 18H). Only the mask filtration
and not the mask fitting properties (loose vs tight) are taken
into account. Background shading divides overall size range
according to common definitions (up to 100 µm) and a size
spanning from the physical size of influenza and SARS-CoV-2
virions (∼0.1 µm) to ∼5 µm, which the fraction being particularly relevant for far-field transmission.

(Fig. 18B and C) in combination with knowledge on those
modes that presumably carry most of a given pathogen
(Fig. 18D, E and F) allows to assess to what extend the
pathogens reach their corresponding target sites in the
respiratory tract. For example, alveolar macrophages are
the target site for airborne infection with M. tuberculosis
(Lin and Flynn, 2010; Roy and Milton, 2004). The combination of Fig. 18D and G shows that the carrier mode
LT is co-located with a secondary maximum of alveolar deposition, underlining that the bacteria could reach
the target directly in airborne state. Note further, that
the modes O1 and O2, for which Fig. 18D suggests that
the bacteria are only sparsely present, corresponds with
a size range in which the alveolar deposition approaches
to zero. In this sense, mode LT appears to be the ’evolutionary optimized’ vehicle for the airborne spread of TB
directly to its target sites.
Finally, Fig. 18H completes the picture by illustrating
the characteristic size-dependent filtration efficiencies of
selected face mask materials. Wearing face masks is a
main measure to decelerate the spread of diseases, given
that (semi)ballistic droplet spray and aerosol transmission are major infection routes. Accordingly, the liter-

37
ature on the influence of face masks - especially in the
context of the current COVID-19 pandemic – has grown
considerably (e.g., Asadi et al., 2020b; Cheng et al., 2021;
Clapp et al., 2020; Drewnick et al., 2020; Gandhi and
Marr, 2021; Leith et al., 2021; Li et al., 2020; Lindsley
et al., 2021; Mitze et al., 2020; Pan et al., 2020; Rogak
et al., 2020). The similarity between the size-dependent
deposition in the respiratory tract and the face mask
filtration efficiency is obvious, which can be explained
by the fact that the relevant particle loss mechanisms
(i.e., diffusional, impaction, and sedimentation losses) are
comparatively ineffective in the range roughly between
100 to 500 nm. In the field of atmospheric aerosol physics,
this size band is known as the location of the so called accumulation mode because particles tend to accumulate in
here due to the minimum in particle loss/removal efficiencies (e.g., Cheng, 1997; He et al., 2005; Lai, 2002; Seinfeld
and Pandis, 2016). Scheuch (2020) emphasized that this
size band is particularly important as it is the co-location
of the minimum in face mask efficiency and the maximum
of the atmospheric lifetime of pathogen-laden particles.
The peak of mode B2 falls within this range, which implies that it has on average the longest lifetime in the
air as well as the largest transmissibility through common face mask materials (especially so called community
masks). Face masks with high filtration efficiencies (e.g.,
N95/FFP2) show a much lower transmissibility in this
particular size range and are thus particularly useful for
preventing the airborne transmission of diseases such as
COVID-19 (e.g., Cheng et al., 2021; Howard et al., 2021;
Lelieveld et al., 2020; Nordsiek et al., 2020).
Figure 19 visualizes the filtration effect of face masks
on the size distribution of speaking-related particles emission rates as shown in Fig. 18B. All PSDs – the initial
speaking-related PSD and the PSDs after face mask filtration – have been multiplied by the total deposition
curve of the respiratory tract as shown in Fig. 18H. Thus,
the (black) PSDs in Fig. 19B compare the deposited particle fractions with and without face mask filtration.
Note that this assumes mask filtration without leaks (i.e.,
a tight fit of the mask). Clearly, all masks have a high
efficacy for large particles (i.e., larger ∼5 µm). For the
small particle range (i.e., smaller ∼5 µm), however, the
transmission curves of community, surgical, and FFP2
masks show significant differences. Note that these differences overlap with the size range of the modes B2 and
LT, which are likely involved in the transmission of the
pathogen shown in Fig. 18D, E, and F.

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
A. Aerosol and droplet transmission of infectious human
diseases

(1) A critical review of definitions, nomenclature, and
concepts regarding airborne or contact-free disease transmission was presented. Through this process we clarified
critical aspects of the discussion for efficient transdisciplinary exchange and collaboration between the medical
and physical sciences (e.g., use of the term airborne, the
continuity and overlap of respiratory aerosol and droplet
size ranges, as well as droplet desiccation and hygroscopicity). Moreover, we highlighted important knowledge
gaps that currently hamper the quantitative assessment
and prediction of the spread of pathogens. Improved connection between infectious disease medicine and a physical or mechanistic understanding of respiratory emissions thus provides basis for improved control of disease
transmission, including non-pharmaceutical intervention
strategies (e.g. mask type, ventilation, filtration), especially for diseases for which no effective vaccination exists. While we endeavor to provide tools to bring groups
of scientists closer together, we acknowledge disciplinary
bias is implicit and have written primarily from the perspective of physical scientists.
(2) Based on a comprehensive review and synthesis
of the scientific literature, we developed a parameterization of particle emissions from the full respiratory tract.
The parameterization requires only five lognormal modes
for the size range from >10 nm to ∼1000 µm to efficiently describe all PSDs available in published literature. The parameterization was optimized in the course
of a ’multi-dimensional fitting’ to represent both number
and volume size distributions. As a further development
of Johnson et al. (2011), the five lognormal modes can be
subdivided in three categories that elucidate unique and
different particle formation mechanisms and sites in the
respiratory tract. The bronchiolar modes B1 and B2 are
formed in the terminal brochioles through film bursting
processes. The mode LT is presumably formed through
vibrations and shear forces in the larynx and/or high turbulence and shear forces in the trachea. Modes O1 and
O2 are formed by mouth, tongue, and lips movements.
(3) Breathing is associated with a bimodal PSD (B1
& B2), whereas speaking and singing as well as coughing
are associated with pentamodal PSDs (B1, B2, LT, O1,
& O2). Overall, the PSDs of all respiratory activities
yield a consistent pattern. Respiratory activities show
a characteristic, multimodal PSD shape, while the associated particle concentrations and emission rates vary
across orders of magnitude.
(4) The variability among PSDs within a given respiratory activity can be explained by (i) the fact that the

and preventive measures: M = mask, D = distance, F = filtration, and V = ventilation. Only the aerosol emission from the infected emitter is visualized. The approximated infection risks for the recipients are illustrated by colored circles (red = highest
risk > orange > yellow > green = lowest risk). Bottom panel shows speaking-related PSD (adapted from Fig. 19B), which represents particle concentration (most relevant in near-field) and emission rate (most relevant in far-field) that can be converted into
each other by a constant factor (see Table I). Blue dashed line in PSD panel shows that the travel range of exhaled particles (for
an exemplary emission velocity of 20 m s−1 and emission height of 1.5 m) in still air is strongly size-dependent (D2 relationship):
large particles (i.e., > 100 µm) are exclusively relevant in near-field, whereas smaller particles (i.e., < 100 µm) are relevant in
both, near- and far-field. Blue background shading in PSD panel illustrates qualitatively that particle concentrations decrease
with distance from emitter due to dilution and mixing. Threshold at 100 nm marks the physical size of SARS-CoV-2 and
influenza virions.

particles were measured under different RH conditions
and thus different particle drying states after exhalation
as well as by (ii) differences in mode height relative to
each other in relation to breathing patterns and vocalization volumes.
(5) The emission of pathogen-laden particles in the
course of all respiratory activities can transmit diseases
in the near- and far-field. For near-field aerosol transmission, the particle concentration in the exhaled puffs
is of primary relevance. Here, our parameterization

shows the following order for number concentrations
(CN ): CN (cough) > CN (speak) ≈ CN (breathe) and for
volume concentrations (CV ): CV (cough) ≈ CV (speak) >
CV (breathe). For far-field aerosol transmission, the particle emission rate – which strongly depend on the frequency of a given respiratory activity – is of primary
relevance. Here, our parameterization shows the following order for number emission rates (QN ): QN (speak) >
QN (cough) > QN (breathe) and for volume emission rates
(QV ): QV (speak) > QV (cough) > QV (breathe).

39
(6) An understanding of the multimodal shape of the
respiration PSDs provides novel mechanistic insight into
airborne disease transmission and the efficacy of preventative measures. For common aerosol-transmissible diseases, modes were identified through which the pathogens
are most likely transmitted: e.g., cough-related mode LT
for tuberculosis; breath-, speaking-/singing-, and coughrelated modes B2, LT, and O1 for influenza and SARSCoV-2.

(7) Public health recommendations can benefit from
an improved understanding of the respiration PSDs parameterized here and through an updated view of the
mechanisms of particle mixing and transmission as illustrated in Fig. 20. Larger droplets (> 100 µm) are not
generally inhalable, have rapid settling velocity, and are
thus relevant only in the near-field where ballistic trajectories can launch them onto nearby surfaces or directly
onto mucosal membranes of the recipient. For respiratory particles in this size regime, even relatively loose
fitting masks (i.e. surgical-style) or face shields are sufficient for protection (e.g., Cappa et al., 2021). Smaller
aerosols (< 100 µm) can be inhaled, have lower settling
velocity and so can remain suspended for many minutes
to hours, and are thus relevant in both the near- and
far-fields. In the near-field, aerosols are concentrated in
the breathing zone of the emitting person, but rapidly
mix into the full room volume. In both near- and farfield, improved masks (i.e. FFP2 or N95 style respirators) are most appropriate to guard against aerosol inhalation (e.g., Bischoff et al., 2013; Cheng et al., 2021;
Goldberg et al., 2021), and physical barriers are not very
effective. In the far-field, aerosols that build up in poorly
ventilated rooms (e.g., He et al., 2005; Lai, 2002, and references therein) can also be removed via ventilation and
filtration, but these added controls provide little benefit
in the near-field. Appropriate control measures and nonpharmaceutical intervention tools, such as use of highquality face masks, physical distancing, ventilation, and
room filtration should thus be matched to the type of
space involved and the sizes and properties of the respiratory particles relevant for a given respiratory disease.
Other engineering controls, such as upper-room germicidal UV light, can also be deployed as one of a layered
strategy for virus inactivation, with primary application
against far-field aerosols (e.g., Miller et al., 2013). It
is also important to note that far-field aerosol transmission is almost exclusively an indoor challenge, because
dilution as a function of increasing distance from emitter
becomes so large outdoors that infection risk is dramatically lower (although not to zero, depending on wind
patterns and other variables) (e.g., Bulfone et al., 2021;
Maggiore et al., 2021). The near-field aerosol transmission, however, is relevant under both, indoor and outdoor
settings.

B. Aerosol and droplet transmission of COVID-19 via
SARS-CoV-2 virus

(1) No definitive proof exists that SARS-CoV-2 (or
almost any other individual viral pathogens) is transmitted by a specific transmission mechanism (Leung,
2021). That said, considerable evidence suggests that the
transmission of SARS-CoV-2 proceeds primarily through
aerosol particles in the size range of ∼0.1 to ∼10 µm, possibly dominated by near-field exposure, but with important contribution from far-field mixing in rooms (e.g.,
Allen and Marr, 2020; Azimi et al., 2021; Chen et al.,
2020; Hwang et al., 2021; Klompas et al., 2020; Kutter
et al., 2020; Kwon et al., 2020; Lednicky et al., 2021,
2020; Lee et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2020; Miller et al.,
2020; Prather et al., 2020b; Tang et al., 2021, 2020).
The parameterization here suggests that the source of
these particles is PSD modes B2, LT and/or O1, originating from multiple respiratory activities, including
breathing, speaking/singing, and coughing. Fecal material aerosolized in broadly similar size ranges (.10 µm)
have also been suggested to be important for disease
spread in some cases (e.g., Gormley et al., 2021; Kang
et al., 2020), but was not discussed in detail here.
(2) The relevance of SARS-CoV-2-carrying aerosol
particles in the size range of ∼0.1 to ∼10 µm, combined with the variable filtration efficiency and poor average fit quality of so-called community face masks in
this size range imply that tight-fitting, high efficiency
masks such as N95/FFP2 are particularly important for
mitigating the airborne transmission of COVID-19 (e.g.,
Cheng et al., 2021; Drewnick et al., 2020). The small size
of these particles also supports the suggestion that increased ventilation and room-filtration will provide community health benefit against COVID-19 (e.g., Curtius
et al., 2021; Mathai et al., 2021; Nissen et al., 2020;
Rothamer et al., 2021).
(3) With regard to studies suggesting that the upper
respiratory tract (i.e., the nose) is the initial target site
for SARS-CoV-2 (e.g., Hou et al., 2020; Wolfel et al.,
2020), the particle modes LT and O1 may be particularly
important because they overlap with the size range of
highest deposition probability in the upper airways.
(4) Speaking is a frequent activity of everyday life,
often with other persons in close proximity, and is also
associated with high particle emission rates. Therefore,
speaking can play a particularly important role in both
near- and far-field transmission of COVID-19. A summary of the aerosol emission rates and particle sizes,
as shown supports the ideas that speaking is likely an
stronger driver of the pandemic than was generally considered early in the development of the COVID-19 pandemic.

40
(5) Remarkably similar bimodal distributions observed for influenza and SARS-CoV-2 in the size range
of the modes B2, LT and/or O1 indicate analogies in
the airborne transmission routes of these two pathogens.
This is a critical piece in context of available preventative against each, because it shows that observations
about mask-wearing and ventilation can be leveraged
for tremendous public health benefit against seasonal influenza as well as other emerging respiratory diseases.
(6) Together, these findings (e.g., Fig. 20) should be
implemented in updated and sophisticated hygiene concepts allowing common work and life in times of pandemics.
C. Open questions and research perspectives

(1) Experimental data on respiratory PSDs, including relevant variability, should be extended to reduce uncertainties across individuals and with respect to different respiratory diseases. Data coverage of the smallest
mode B1 (centered at ∼70 nm) and largest modes O1
and O2 (centered at ∼10 µm & ∼100 µm) is especially
sparse. Further, most available measurements have focused on a limited portion of the full range of respiratory
particle sizes (<10 nm to >1000 µm). We propose that
systematic experiments across the full size should be conducted for different respiratory activities and a large cohort of volunteers (including healthy and individual disease groups) to consolidate our knowledge on the overall
modality, mode ratios and their variability as a function
of respiratory activities. A number of instruments will
be required to span the full range of particle sizes (e.g.,
Johnson et al., 2011). Within the design of these experiments, care should be taken so that instrument PSDs
overlap for cross-validation. Instruments with high size
resolution are preferred to resolve details of the PSDs,
which ideally can be acquired at high time-resolution to
also observe differences in PSD properties as a function
of rapidly changing emission mechanisms.
(2) Existing measurements have been conducted under
widely different experimental conditions, which hampers
the comparison across studies and individuals. Standardized operational procedures for the analysis of respiratory
aerosols would therefore be desirable (e.g., as outlined for
atmospheric aerosols in Wiedensohler et al., 2014). One
effort in this area was recently conducted as a part of a
journal special issues focused on standardizing bioaerosol
measurements, however, this was only a first step, with
significant follow-up required (e.g., Alsved et al., 2020a;
Cox et al., 2020; Huffman et al., 2020; Huffman and
Ratnesar-Shumate, 2020; Mainelis, 2020; Santarpia et al.,
2020b; Santl-Temkiv et al., 2019). Important aspects of
such a standardization might be: (i) defined drying conditions e.g., <40 % RH, which is a rather reproducible
state, (ii) isokinetic and isoaxial aerosol sampling, es-

pecially for large particles, (iii) corrections for particle
losses in the experimental setup (von der Weiden et al.,
2009), (iv) documentation of the precise sampling conditions (i.e., RH, temperature), and (v) a documentation
of basic physiological, spirometric, and demographic parameters.
(3) Recorded measurements of respiratory activities
have thus far been mostly standardized maneuvers and,
therefore reflect ’normal live’ emissions only imperfectly.
Therefore, continuous measurements of respiratory emission from volunteers during different everyday activities
(e.g., conversation, office work, at school, gym workout)
would be very useful to better assess infection risks under
real-world conditions.
(4) Edwards et al. (2021) showed significant differences
in SARS-CoV-2 aerosol emission rate as a function of
age and several physiological factors, but otherwise data
is still relatively sparse regarding the physical basis to
explain why some individuals act as viral aerosol superspreaders. For example, it is still relatively uncertain
to what extent the superspreading of many diseases by
certain individuals correlates with particularly high emission rates of exhaled particles overall and why this might
be the case. Dedicated studies on the high inter-subject
variability of emission rates would be important to close
gaps in this area of knowledge.
(5) Data on the chemical composition of saliva and
ELF and its variability is sparse. Further experiments
are needed as the chemical microenvironment plays a
primary role for the decay of viability of the embedded
pathogens during airborne transport.
(6) Data on the hygroscopic properties of mucosalivary particles and their shrinkage or growth under changing RH conditions, including the influence of potential
hysteresis effects upon efflorescence and deliquescence, is
sparse. Instruments reaching high RH, such as a highhumidity tandem differential mobility analyzer (HHTDMA) (Mikhailov et al., 2020; Mikhailov and Vlasenko,
2020) or similar, may allow investigation of these parameters.
(7) The precise pathogen emission mechanisms and
sites are still largely uncertain. In this sense, our assignment of certain modes and likely emission mechanisms
and sites (i.e., B1, B2, LT, O1, and O2) can be considered as preliminary estimates. While the processes
behind mode B2 are rather well documented, the origin
of mode B1 is widely unknown. Additionally, the interplay of emission from the larynx and trachea, which we
combined here in mode LT, present large uncertainties.
Finally, the precise mechanisms and sites of droplet formation in the mouth that generate modes O1 and O2
are poorly understood.
(8) Further experimental studies on the pathogen size

41
distributions and their mixing in the carrier PSD are
highly needed as they (i) provide suggestions on droplet
formation mechanisms and sites in the respiratory tract,
(ii) allow the assessment of which PSD modes are most
relevant as drivers of pathogen spread, and (iii) help the
identification of the most likely deposition sites in the
respiratory tract in relation to data on pathogen tropism
(e.g., Hou et al., 2020; Nomaguchi et al., 2012).
(9) A better understanding of respiratory particle
transport and dilution in air as a function of particle size
will be required to help model the relative risk of infection
in both indoor and outdoor settings. Without the ability to detect the small fraction of respiratory particles, it
is impossible to use particle sizing instruments alone to
observe respiratory emissions in a room. Thus, improved
instrumental techniques will be required to selectively analyze respiratory particles amidst the overwhelming pool
of existing aerosols in any room or outdoor air volume.
Further, an improved understanding will be required on
the quantitative range of how many pathogen entities
(e.g., virions) for each disease are necessary for infection
via the inhalation of the aerosol phase or deposition of
the droplet phase (Jones and Brosseau, 2015; Rudnick
and Milton, 2003; Wells, 1955).
(10) Improved understanding of environmental viability of pathogens, as a function of aerosol size and composition, RH, temperature, and UV flux, will aid the estimation of infectivity as a function of real-world parameters (e.g., van Doremalen et al., 2020; Fears et al., 2020a;
Santarpia et al., 2020c).
