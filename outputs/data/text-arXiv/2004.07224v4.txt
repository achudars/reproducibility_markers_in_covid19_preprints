Abstract
The fatality rate of Covid-19 escalates with age and is larger in men than women.
I show that these variations correlate strongly with the level of the viral receptor
protein ACE2 in rat lungs, which is consistent with the still limited and apparently
contradictory data on human ACE2. Surprisingly, lower levels of the receptor correlate with higher fatality. However, a previous mathematical model predicts that the
speed of viral progression in the organism has a maximum and then declines with
the receptor level. Moreover, many manifestations of severe CoViD-19, such as severe lung injury, exacerbated inflammatory response and thrombotic problems may
derive from increased Angiotensin II (Ang-II) level that results from degradation of
ACE2 by the virus. I present here a mathematical model based on the influence of
ACE2 on viral propagation and disease severity. The model fits Covid-19 fatality
rate across age and sex with high accuracy (r 2 > 0.9) under the hypothesis that
SARS-CoV-2 infections are in the dynamical regimes in which increased receptor
slows down viral propagation. Moreover, rescaling the model parameters by the
ratio of the binding rates of the spike proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 allows predicting the fatality rate of SARS-CoV across age and sex, thus linking the
molecular and epidemiological levels. The presented model opposes the fear that angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), suggested as a therapy against the most adverse
effects of CoViD-19, may favour viral propagation, and suggests that Ang-II and
ACE2 are candidate prognostic factors for detecting population that needs stronger
protection.

The Covid-19 pandemics [1] is causing hundreds of thousands fatalities worldwide [2],
creating a tremendous threat to global health. It presents a strong gradient of fatalities
across age and a sex bias with much higher severity in males than females. Modelling
1

studies that extrapolate the number of infections suggest that, at young age, most SARSCoV-2 infections are asymptomatic and the fatality ratio is very low, whereas for the
elderlies most infections are severe and a large fraction of them can be fatal [3]. Understanding the biological reasons that underlie these striking differences is one of the most
pressing problems of CoViD-19 research, which might lead to better prediction of the
disease prognosis and possible treatments that approach the severity of the worst affected
groups to that of the most protected ones.
Here I show that the case fatality ratio of Covid-19 across age and sex correlates
negatively with the level of the protein Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the
cellular receptor both of SARS and SARS-CoV-2 virus [1, 4]. The correlation is very
strong with membrane-bound ACE2 protein in rat lungs, which decreases with age and
is higher in old females than old males [5]. The same qualitative pattern is observed for
membrane-bound ACE2 in mice [6], where all the anti-inflammatory axis of the ReninAngiotensin-System (RAS) [7] to which ACE2 belongs decreases with age. In humans,
ACE2 protein in serum [9] and mRNA [10–13] are lower in children than adults, but
available data and current knowledge of the RAS supports that ACE2 as membrane
protein decreases through age [8], as hypothesized here and discussed later.
The negative correlation between ACE2 and lethality is surprising: higher levels of
the receptor decrease the lethality exponentially. The paradox is only apparent because
high receptor levels do not necessarily favour viral propagation. A mathematical model
of viral infection [15], developed before the COVID-19 pandemics, computed how viral
propagation depends on the adsorption rate of viruses on cells. In terms of receptor level,
this model predicts that the speed of viral propagation is a non-monotonic function that
increases with the receptor level, reaches a maximum and then decreases.
The second mechanism that may underlie the negative correlation concerns the function of ACE2 not as viral receptor but as key enzyme of the RAS [7]. This system,
besides regulating blood pressure (BP) and electrolyte homeostasis in blood, plays a central role in inflammatory processes [17], immune response [18] and coagulation [19, 20],
which characterize the most severe Covid-19 cases [29,30]. Its main player is the family of
peptides derived from angiotensin I (Ang1-10), cleaved by the enzyme Renin from the protein angiotensinogen. Its pro-inflammatory arm is constituted by angiotensin II (Ang1-8),
cleaved from Ang1-10 by the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) homologous to ACE2.
Ang1-8 bound to the receptor ATR-1 triggers a cascade of reactions leading not only to
vasoconstriction and increased BP but also to activation of the transcription factor NFkB
that upregulates inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, TNF-α and IFN-γ among others), activates white blood cells and platelets, and favours thrombotic processes [21]. The enzyme
ACE2 limits the level of Ang1-8 by converting its precursor Ang1-10 to Ang1-9 [22] that
is subsequently cleaved by ACE to Ang1-7, and by directly converting Ang1-8 to Ang1-7,
which belongs to the anti-inflammatory arm of the RAS since it favours vasodilation,
reduces BP and attenuates inflammation [23].
Upon viral entry the spike protein of SARS-CoV and probably also SARS-CoV-2
cause the internalization and degradation of ACE2 [24] that critically contributes to lung
2

damage [25–27]. Decrease of ACE2 raises the severity of lung injury in other inflammatory
diseases [27] and in aging rats [28], which may be explained by the increase of Ang1-8
and its adverse effects.
Here I develop a set of mathematical models of SARS-CoV-2 lethality versus the preinfection level of ACE2 based on two aspects: the influence of ACE2 on viral progression
[15] and the negative effect of its degradation. These models are fitted to the CFR of
SARS-CoV-2 across six classes of age and sex in Italy, Spain and Germany, and support
the hypothesis that the receptor level slows down the virus propagation, which fits the data
much better than the competing hypothesis. Furthermore, under the same hypothesis and
by rescaling the parameters fitted to SARS-CoV-2 by the ratio between the binding rates
of the spike proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the model predicts well the CFR of
SARS-CoV further supporting the negative relationship between receptor level and virus
propagation.

Results
CoViD-19 lethality correlates negatively with ACE2 level
The level of the ACE2 protein in rat lungs were quantified across three age classes of the
two sexes by Xie et al. [5], who found that it strongly decays with age and it is higher in
female than male rats, with largest difference in the oldest cohort where the expression
is almost double for females. Here I assume that human ACE2 membrane protein levels
across age and sex are qualitatively similar to rat data, apart for multiplicative factors that
may depend on the organ. This assumption is supported by mice data [6], ACE2 protein in
human lungs [8] and ACE2 mRNA expression in the GTEx database [10], but it apparently
contrasts with the observation that ACE2 in serum [9] and ACE2 mRNA [11–13] is higher
in adults than in children. We discuss later that these discrepancies are in fact consistent
with the current knowledge of the RAS.
Strikingly, the profile of ACE2 in Ref. [5] is very strongly anti-correlated with the
lethality of SARS-CoV-2. Fig.1 represents the level of the ACE2 protein in lung rats
(horizontal axis, data from Fig.2 of [5]) versus the case fatality ratio (CFR) of CoVid-19
registered in Italy [31], Spain [32] and Germany [33] in three uniform age classes (young,
< 30, middle-age 30 − 59 and old > 60; vertical axis) of each sex. Data strongly support
the exponential decrease of mortality with ACE2 level, with r 2 = 0.91, 0.97 and 0.89,
respectively, suggesting that variations of ACE2 describe the largest part of the variation
of the CFR.
As for other two-parameter fits tested in this work, the fitted exponents for Italy and
Germany coincide within the error and the CFR differ only by a multiplicative factor,
supporting the robustness of the data. Data from Spain present higher mortality in the
young ages, which might be attributed to more frequent undetected cases in young age
with lower severity.

Mathematical model of covid-19 lethality
Mathematical models of viral growth consider three processes: virus adsorption into susceptible cells, production of virus by infected cells after a delay time τ , and viral clearance
by the immune system [34]. I translate here this mathematical formalism in terms of receptor density, exploiting that the adsorption rate is proportional to the receptor level
A expressed in susceptible cells times the association rate between the virus and the
receptor, kA ≡ kA.
The simple mean-field model that does not consider explicit space predicts a minimal
receptor density below which the virus does not grow and above which higher receptor levels accelerate the viral progression. Considering spatial diffusion modifies this situation.
The analytical solution of a model of viral propagation in space was obtained in 2002 by
Fort and Méndez [35], who tested their model with experiments on the spread of bacteriophages in lysis plaques. Their mathematical formulation is conceptually equivalent to the
present setting and can be directly applied here. Varying the receptor level A (adsorption
rate in the original paper), three regimes appear: (1) When A is small the viral velocity
4

v increases with A less than linearly. (2) For intermediate kA, large with respect to 1/τ
but small with respect to the rate of virus production, the viral velocity reaches a plateau
where it is almost independent of A. (3) Although not explicitly discussed in Ref. [35],
the formulas presented there remain valid in the regime where kA is larger than the rate
of virus production.
In this regime the viral progression slows down with receptor density
√
as v ∝ 1/ kA.
The latter result is surprising: how can the virus progress more slowly for increasing
receptor level? Since this is a mathematical model, the answer is readily found: in
the model, viral particles are consumed when they enter a cell but the viral yield per
infected cell does not increase when a cell is infected multiple times. It was in fact
proposed that multiple viral entries in the same cell interfere with viral replication. Several
viruses such as HIV [36,37], measles [38], influenza [39] and hepatitis B [40] downregulate
their own receptor, preventing multiple entries. The mathematical result that, after the
infection is established, very fast adsorption does not favour the virus, agrees with a recent
study that demonstrated the protective effect of high adsorption rate through analytic
computation, simulation and experiment [41]. In all, the mathematical model predicts
that viral progression in the organism declines above some receptor level.
Next, I consider two possible models of Covid-19 death. In the first one, death occurs
when the virus propagates through the upper respiratory tract or through endothelial
cells, reaches the lungs and infects and destroys a critical fraction X of it, the same
for all patients. The second model considers the protective effect of ACE2, assuming
that the critical fraction X is a decreasing function of the pre-infection ACE2 level A,
X = 1 − Ac /A, i.e. the larger is the initial level of ACE2, the more tolerant is assumed
to be the organism to the viral infection.
Combining these two assumptions with the three regimes of viral propagation described above gives six mathematical models. For each of them, I compute the time td
after which the virus causes death versus the ACE2 level A (see Methods). If the viral
velocity increases with ACE2 td is a decreasing function of A. This behaviour contradicts
the data and I shall not consider it further. In the regime in which the viral velocity is
independent of A td is an increasing function of A only for the model that considers the
protective effect of ACE2, which is called Model 1. Model 2 assumes that viral propagation decreases with A but neglects the protective effect of ACE2 and Model 3 considers
both the decrease of viral propagation and the protective effect of ACE2.
I compute lethality as the probability that td is smaller than the time ti needed by
the immune system for clearing the virus, which I model as a random variable with two
possible distributions: (1) The exponential distribution, which is the distribution with
maximum entropy for given average value. (2) The Gaussian distribution, justified by the
fact that ti is the sum of intermediate steps in the maturation of the immune response
and the limit of the sum of independent random variables is a Gaussian. I adopt the
same immune system parameters for all age and sex classes in order to limit the number
of free parameters and to test if variations of the receptor level are sufficient to explain
the lethality.
5

The three models, combined with the exponential and the Gaussian distribution, yield
six different functional forms of the CFR versus A. Some of them have many parameters, but simple approximations reduce the number of free parameters to two (for the
exponential distribution) or three (for the Gaussian distribution), see Methods.
The three models are fitted to the data under the same distribution, strongly regularizing the fits with rescaled ridge regression [43] to limit overfitting as much as possible
(see Methods). Under both distributions, and for the CFR of the three countries, model
1 gives the worst fit and model 3 the best. In particular, under the exponential distribution the relative quadratic error of the logarithm for models 1, 2 and 3 is 0.37, 0.19,
0.07 for Spain, 0.41, 0.30, 0.21 for Italy and 0.48, 0.23, 0.17 for Germany, using two free
parameters in all cases. Adopting the Gaussian distribution requires three parameters,
with high risk of overfitting, but it maintains the same ranking: 0.04, 0.01 and 0.01 for
Spain, 0.10, 0.04 and 0.04 for Italy and 0.14, 0.06, 0.06 for Germany, see Methods and
Supplementary Table S1.
In conclusion, for both distributions the hypothesis that the viral progression decreases
with the receptor level (models 2 and 3) fits the data much better than the competing hypothesis that the propagation is independent of the receptor level. Under the exponential
distribution model 3, which also considers the protective role of ACE2, performs better
than model 2, but they are undistinguishable under the Gaussian distribution.
The solid lines in Fig.1 represent
√ approximate fits of2 model 2 under the Gaussian
distribution: − log(CFR) = aA − b A + c. They yield r > 0.92 with only two free parameters, since the parameter c was not fitted to reduce the error of the fit (see Methods).
The parameters a and b fitted from different countries differ only slightly more than their
statistical error, which may reflect the different incidence of undetected cases across age
classes.

SARS 2003
An important prediction of Models 2 and 3 is that the fit parameters a and b depend on the
adsorption
constant per unit receptor k, with the fit parameters expressed as a ∝ k and
√
b ∝ k in Model 2. Crucially, this prediction can be tested on the CFR of the 2003 SARS
coronavirus [42], which also uses ACE2 as cellular receptor. Under the hypothesis that
the rate-limiting step for adsorption is the binding of the spike protein to ACE2, justified
if the complex is stable enough to allow membrane fusion, and supported by infection
assays, k is proportional to the spike binding rate constant, which has been measured with
biochemical experiments for both SARS and SARS-CoV-2. This allows rescaling the fit
parameters a and b obtained for SARS-CoV-2 to predict the corresponding parameters for
SARS (see Methods). Multiplying the predicted CFR times a global factor that accounts
for undetected cases as the only free parameter, we predict the CFR of SARS with very
good accuracy. The relative quadratic error is equal to 0.13, 0.08 and 0.01 using the fit
parameters from Italy, Spain and Germany, respectively, see Fig.1, Supplementary table
S1 and Discussion. This result further supports the hypothesis that the viral velocity is
6

slowed down by increasing receptor level.

NL63
It is natural to extend this analysis to the other human coronavirus that uses ACE2 as
receptor, NL63 that causes common cold and is not generally associated with pneumonia.
Its spike protein contains a very stable receptor binding domain of 120 residues that
showed high binding affinity for ACE2 [44]. However, the complete S1 domain of the
spike (717 residues) is much less stable and its affinity for ACE2 is so small that it could
not be measured with binding assays [45–47], and it was conjectured that it is 10-100-fold
smaller than that of SARS-CoV [46]. Since the CFR of SARS peaks for old females, whose
normalized ACE2 is equal to 22% of the maximum value, the model predicts that this
is the level at which SARS-CoV propagates fastest. If the binding affinity of the NL63
spike is at least ten times smaller, the ACE2 level at which NL63 propagates fastest is
more than double the highest ACE2 level, implying that NL63 is in the regime in which
the ACE2 level enhances its propagation.
This analysis agrees with the apparently surprising data reported in Fig.3A of Ref.
[45], which shows that ACE2 overexpression in 293T cells enhances NL63 infection three
times more than SARS-CoV infection, indicating that higher receptor levels accelerate the
propagation of NL63 more than that of SARS-CoV despite the latter has higher binding
affinity.

Discussion
Since ACE2 is the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, we may expect that raising its level enhances
the rate at which the virus propagates in the organism and worsens the outcome of the
infection. However, a mathematical model of viral progression presents a regime in which
the increase of the receptor level slows down the virus propagation in the organism. The
observed relation between SARS-CoV-2 lethality and ACE2 levels suggests that this is
the relevant regime of SARS-CoV-2 infections, as further supported by the prediction of
the age- and sex-dependent lethality of 2003 SARS-CoV.

Human ACE2
An important limitation of the present work is that it uses data of ACE2 protein levels
in healthy rat lungs [5] since similar data are not available for humans. A recent clinical
study could not confirm significant differences of ACE2 expression between patients of
different age with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [48]. This clinical study
measured the activity of RAS enzymes at only one time point for each patient, so that
the dynamics of the RAS during ARDS may have obscured individual differences.
Consistent with rat data, decrease through age of membrane-bound ACE2 protein was
also observed in mice, which show a general strengthening of the inflammatory arm of
7

the RAS with aging [6]. In humans, a recent preprint found that membrane-bound ACE2
is more abundant in children than in adult lungs [8]. However, other publications and
preprints showed that ACE2 is higher in adults than in children in serum [9] and at the
mRNA level [11–13]. ACE2 is detached from the cellular membrane and shed to the serum
by the metalloprotease ADAM17 [14]. The discrepancy between membrane-bound and
serum levels suggests that ADAM17 is less active in children, consistent with our current
and still limited knowledge of the RAS. In fact, ADAM17 is upregulated by the binding of
Ang1-8 to the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (ATR1). Ang1-8 increases with age [6], while
children express much more than adults the receptor ATR2 that competes with ATR1 and
counteracts its action [50]. Thus, children are expected to present lower binding of Ang1-8
to ATR1 and lower activation of ADAM17. Regarding ACE2 mRNA, this starts being
expressed after birth and reaches a maximum at young age [13]. The hypothesized lower
shedding of ACE2 in children implies that the membrane protein reaches its maximum at
younger age than mRNA. Therefore, the higher expression of ACE2 as membrane protein
is not contradicted by these observations.
Rat data are also consistent with the observation that ACE2 mRNA expression decreases through age in mice [51] and adult human cells [10], as also represented in Fig.3g
of the preprint that reported higher ACE2 mRNA in adults [13]. Mechanistically, this
decrease of ACE2 mRNA through age is probably related with the increase of Ang1-8 [6]
that downregulates ACE2 expression [81].
Regarding sex differences, Ref. [10] found that ACE2 mRNA is higher in males than
females, as in rats. Ref. [13] reached the opposite conclusion, but this seems an artefact
of the fact that smoking enhances ACE2 expression [12] and in their samples 50% of
men were smokers compared to 25% of women. It has to be noted that the ACE2 gene
is contained in the X chromosome, of which females have two copies. Although one
of these copies is epigenetically silenced, about 15% of the X-linked genes escape this
inactivation [52] and heterochromatin is known to dysregulate with age. It is interesting
that old female rats present almost exactly double ACE2 than males [5], as one would
expect if the epigenetic silencing fades at old age. Consistently, some of the sex differences
in human cardio-vascular diseases have been attributed to sex differences in the expression
of ACE2, which acts as protective factor [53].
The negative relation between ACE2 levels and severity of Covid-19 is supported by
other risk and protective factors corrected for age, sex and other comorbidities in a large
study in the UK [16]. Namely, being a current smoker constitute a curious protective
factor (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR): 0.82−0.97), and smoking enhances ACE2 expression
[12]. Contrary to single-factor analysis, diagnosed hypertension is a protective factor
(AHR 0.85 − 0.93), which may be correlated with the fact that anti-hypertensive drugs
enhance ACE2 expression [67]. Diabetes is a risk factor (AHR 1.72 − 2.09), and it has
been associated with reduced ACE2 expression [54]. Cardiovascular diseases and reduced
kidney function are additional risk factors that are related with reduced ACE2 levels [7].
Finally, Vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor for COVID-19 [55] that is also related
with low levels of ACE2 because Vitamin D inhibits the expression of Renin, which in
8

turn produces Ang1-10, the substrate from which is cleaved Ang1-8, which downregulates
ACE2 [56]. Therefore, low levels of Vitamin D are expected to reduce ACE2. Vitamin
D levels are decreased in ethnic groups with dark skin pigmentation living at temperate
latitudes, perhaps due to high screening of solar radiation, providing a possible causal
relationship between ethnic status and Covid-19 (AHR 1.30 − 1.69 for Black people,
discounting socio-economic factors), once again through ACE2. Therefore, other hazard
factors and protecting factors besides age and sex also support a negative correlation
between ACE2 and Covid-19 lethality.
Finally, the GTEx database shows that, despite lungs are the organ that is more
severely damaged by COVID-19, they do not present high expression of ACE2 mRNA [57],
which is higher in tissues from reproductive organs, intestine, adipose tissue, kidney,
hearth, thyroid, esophagus, breast, salivary glands and pancreas, among others. Some
of these organs may be infected but they experience less damage, consistent with the
negative correlation between ACE2 levels in lungs and lethality.

Role of ACE2 for virus propagation and spike mutant D614G
The above evidence strongly supports the negative correlation between ACE2 protein levels and severity of CoViD-19. This in turn supports the mathematical model presented
here, based on the hypothesis that increased ACE2 slows down viral propagation [35],
which fits the CFR from Spain, Italy and Germany with r 2 = 0.93, 0.79 and 0.83, respectively, using two free parameters. The same hypothesis predicts the lethality profile
of the 2003 SARS virus across age and sex yielding r 2 = 0.92, 0.87 and 0.99 using the
fit parameters from Spain, Italy and Germany, respectively, and a single free parameter.
This extrapolation from SARS-CoV-2 to SARS uses the ratio between the binding rate
constants of the spike proteins of the two viral species, bridging the molecular and the
epidemiological level.
The above computation predicts that SARS has higher relative mortality for young
age with respect to old age (the observed ratio is 22% for SARS compared with 1.3% for
SARS-CoV-2) due to the smaller binding affinity of the SARS spike for ACE2. It also
predicts that mutations that decrease the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike may generate a
strain more severe for younger age.
Remarkably, the mutant D614G of the viral spike, which rapidly rose to almost fixation
world-wide [58], presents lower affinity for ACE2, propagates faster in cell cultures than
the original spike [59] and its detected cases tend to be younger [60], in line with the
above prediction. A direct relation between D614G and disease severity could not be
proven, but an indirect one seems to exist since D641G is associated with increased viral
load and viral load is associated with hospitalization [60]. Nevertheless, the improved
propagation of D614G was attribute to the higher population of the binding-competent
open configuration [59], thus other possible interpretations exist.

ARB and ACE2 as protective factors
SARS and probably also SARS-CoV-2 degrade ACE2 [24], with detrimental effects on the
lungs on which ACE2 has a protective effect [25–27,70]. Several papers proposed that the
downregulation of ACE2 is a key factor for the severity of CoViD-19 and suggested that
ACE inhibitors (ACE-I) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) that limit the effects
of Ang1-8 may be beneficial for CoViD-19 patients [61–66]. A similar idea was already
proposed at the time of SARS, and a retrospective meta-analysis found that the use of
ARB and ACE-I provides a consistent reduction in risk of pneumonia compared with
controls [76]. In the context of CoViD-19, several studies found that ARB and ACE-I
protect the lungs and mitigate the severity of COVID-19 for patients that already take
them against hypertension [71–75].
However, the possible protective role of ARB and ACE-I has been out-weighted by
the fear that they may favour viral propagation since they upregulate the viral receptor
ACE2 [67], and it was proposed that they should be discontinued [68,69]. Medical societies
firmly opposed this suggestion due to lack of evidence [78–80]. The current consensus is
that available data are too limited to support either hypothesis that ACE-I and ARB may
be detrimental or beneficial in CoViD-19 infections, but withdrawal of anti-hypertensive
drugs in patients that need them may be harmful [74].
The negative correlation between ACE2 levels and lethality of SARS-Cov-2 found
here, and the mathematical prediction that the receptor level does not enhance but slows
down viral progression, contradict the fear that ARB and ACE-I may benefit the virus
and suggests two complementary protective roles of high ACE2 levels. On one hand,
they may slow down the propagation of the virus, an effect conceptually similar to that
observed in recent experiments with soluble human ACE2 [77]. On the other hand, they
reduce the accumulation of Ang1-8, whose proinflammatory and prothrombotic effects are
thought to underlie the most severe complications of CoViD-19. This work thus supports
the idea that ARB and ACE-I used to treat high blood pressure may limit the most
adverse manifestations of CoViD-19.
A note of caution concerns the effect of these drugs on the bradykinin system. This
system is strongly coupled with the RAS and causes vasodilation, reduces blood pressure
and increases vascular permeability. Its overactivity can lead to increased inflammation,
thrombosis and angioedema in the lungs, and it was proposed that it mediates the severe
manifestations of COVID-19 [84–86].
The bradykinin system consists of two axes. The first one is downregulated by ACE2,
which degrades the signalling peptide des-Arg9 -bradykinin (DABK) whose receptor BK1R
is upregulated by Ang1-8 (in turn downregulated by ACE2) bound to the receptor ATR1.
Stimulation of this axis may lead to release of pro-inflammatory chemokines, lung inflammation and injury [87] and is expected to be reduced through ARB and ACE-I, which
would exert a protective role.
The other axis is downregulated by ACE, which degrades the signalling peptide BK,
whose receptor BK2R is in turn activated by Ang1-7 and Ang1-9 produced by ACE2,
10

and is stimulated by Ang1-8 bound to the receptor ATR2 [88]. Thus, ACE2, ATR1 receptor blockers and even more ACE-I can upregulate the BK2R axis with pathological
consequences, as observed in severe side-effects of ACE-I [89], and their use should be
limited in the presence of hypotension. Nevertheless, adverse effects have not been reported in studies of the effect of these drugs on COVID-19 patients. We speculate that
the synergy between BK2R and ATR1 through heterodimerization [90] might generate a
negative feedback that limits the effect of ARB on the BK2R axis.

Positive feedback loop
It is noteworthy that degradation of ACE2 increases the level of Ang1-8, which in turn
binds the ATR1 receptor and down-regulates ACE2 even further both at the mRNA and
at the protein level [81]. Thus, the SARS-CoV-2 infection may trigger a dangerous positive
feedback loop that strongly raises Ang1-8, exacerbating inflammatory response [17,18] and
coagulation problems [19,20], frequent complications of severe CoViD-19 patients [30,82].
Positive correlation between Ang1-8 levels and viral load has been reported in CoViD-19
patients [83], supporting the link between severe CoViD-19 and dysregulation of the RAS.
Under this point of view, ARBs appear to be more favourable than ACE-I because
they can interfere with the positive feedback loop of Ang1-8 and because Ang1-8 can be
generated by other proteases if ACE is inhibited [7].

Concluding remarks
Of course, clinical trials are necessary to establish whether ARB and ACE-I have a positive, negative or neutral effect on CoViD-19 severity. To this aim, the clinical trials
NCT04312009 and NCT04311177 started in April 2020 at the University of Minnesota.
The present work aims at stimulating others to join efforts to assess this promising treatment.
Finally, the results presented here suggest a prognostic role for the measurements of
ACE2 levels in bronchial aspirated lavage samples and Ang1-8 in the serum, which may
predict the severity of the disease already at an early stage and may allow detecting risk
groups that need higher protection besides the elder, as supported by the association
between ACE2 and known risk and protecting factors against CoViD-19 [16]. We are
currently investigating this possibility through retrospective studies.

Materials and Methods
Case-fatality-rates and expression data
Case fatality rates (CFR) were taken from Ref. [31–33] for CoViD-19 in Italy, Spain and
Germany, respectively, and from Ref. [42] for the 2003 SARS outbreak in Hong-Kong.
At the beginning of an outbreak, CFR underestimate the true fatality rate because their
11

calculation assumes that all people currently infected will recover, which unfortunately
is not true. This effect may not be uniform across age-sex classes if patients of some
classes tend to die more rapidly, as assumed by the model. However, at a late epidemic
stage this effect is expected to be small. On the other hand, CFR overestimate the true
fatality rate because of undetected cases that tend to lower the denominator. Since agesex classes with higher lethality also tend to have more severe cases and less undetected
cases, the overestimation is larger for classes with smaller lethality, with the consequence
of reducing the differences among classes for larger fraction of undetected cases. The data
currently available do not allow correcting for this bias, which may account for some of
the differences in the fit parameters.
Expression data presented in Ref. [5] were grouped in three age classes of 3 (young),
12 (middle) and 24 months (old). CFR were presented in bins of 10 years, and I grouped
them in three equally spaced groups 0-29 (young), 30-59 (middle) and ≥ 60 years (old).
Grouping the 20-29 years class with the middle age gave similar results with approximately
exponential decrease of lethality with ACE2 expression.
For SARS CFR [42], ages were grouped differently: 0-44 (young), 45-74 (middle) and
≥ 75 (old). To compare these groups with those of SARS-CoV-2, I interpolated expression
data of ACE2 A for these groups as A(0 − 44) = 0.667A(0 − 29) + 0.333A(30 − 59),
A(45 − 74) = 0.5A(30 − 59) + 0.5A(≥ 60) and A(≥ 75) = 0.667A(≥ 60). Other schemes
gave qualitatively similar results: The CFR decreases approximately exponentially with
A and the exponent is smaller than for SARS-CoV-2, which are the two important points
made in the paper.

Mathematical model of viral propagation
The simplest mathematical model of viral propagation considers three populations: uninfected cells U(t), free virus V (t) that enter the cells with rate kA U(t)V (t) (adsorption)
and are cleared with rate c, and infected cells I(t) that produce new virus at rate kV Y I(t)
(Y stands for yield) after a delay τ called eclipse time, until they ultimately die [34]. Here
I express the adsorption rate as a function of the receptor density A, kA = kA. The viral
population cannot grow below the minimum receptor density given by Amin = c/(kU0 Y )
(U0 is the initial concentration of susceptible cells). A spatially explicit version of this
model in which virus diffuse through susceptible cells [15] was found amenable to analytical solution that explicitly gives the viral velocity v as a function of the model parameters [35]. Here I describe this solution in terms of the receptor density. The authors
describe two regimes: (1) For small A (A < 1/(kU0 τ Yq), A < 1/(kU0 kV )), the viral ve-

kA U0 Y
. (2) For intermediate
locity increases with A, but less then linearly, as v = 2 D 1+k
A U0 Y
p
receptor density 1/(kU0 τ Y ) < A < 1/(kU0 kV ) the viral velocity is given by v = 2D/τ ,
where D is the effective diffusion constant that depends on cell shape and density, and
it is almost independent of A [35] so that the viral progression is not enhanced by the
expression of the receptor. (3) The formulas presented in the paper are also valid in the

12

third regime of very high receptor density, when kA is larger than the rate at which viral
particles are produced: A > 1/(kU0 τ Y ), A > 1/(kU0 kV ), although this regime was not
explicitly discussed. Counter-intuitively,
in this regime the viral progression slows down
p
with receptor density as v = kV /kAU0 .
The time that it takes for the virus to propagate through the upper respiratory tract
(URT) can be estimated as tU = lU /v. When the virus reaches the lungs, the number of
infected cells grows with time as I(t) ∝ (vt)dF , where dF ≈ 2.35 is the fractal dimension
of the lungs [91], which are one of the classical examples of a fractal

reaches the critical level Ac after the time tL = (lL /v)(1−Ac /A0 )1/dF ≈= lvL 1 − dAFc A(0)
I used the approximation Ac ≪ A(0), and A(0) is the receptor density at the beginning of
the infection, which in the main text is simply denoted as
these

Ac 1
I estimate the time at which death occurs as td ≈ (1/v) lU + lL 1 − dF A .
√
I consider three situations: (1) v is independent of A; (2) v decreases as 1/ kA and
almost all the cells in the lungs must be infected to produce the death, i.e. Ac = 0; (3)
v decreases with A and Ac > 0. In each situation, the death
time td depends on A as
√ √
√ √

A − dAFc √1A (Model 3).
td ∝ 1 − dF A (Model 1), td ∝ k A (Model 2), td ∝ k
In the model, death occurs if td is smaller than the time ti needed by the immune
system to control the virus, which is modelled either as an exponential (E) or a Gaussian
(G) random variable. In the first case, the probability that ti is larger than td can be
computed as Pd = exp(−td /T ), where T is the average value of ti . In the Gaussian case,
the probability is well approximated as Pd = C exp (−(td − µ)2 /(2σ 2 )). Combining these
expressions with the three models of td versus A and grouping together terms with the
same power of A, we obtain six mathematical models of the lethality Pd as a function of
the initial level of ACE2 A:
 a

− Ab √+ c (1G)

aA − b√A + c (2G)
a A + b (2E)
− ln(Pd ) ≈
 √
b
√
a A − A (3E) aA − b A + √cA (3G)
a, b and
√ c are√positive fitting parameters. In Eq.(3G), there are five terms proportional
to A, A, 1/ A, 1/A and constant, corresponding to five fitting parameters. In order to
fit only three parameters, the same number as for the other Gaussian fits, I neglected the
terms proportional to 1/A √
and constant, obtaining Eq.(3G), while neglecting the terms
proportional to 1/A and 1/ A yields Eq.(2G).

Fits of the model
The fitting parameters a and b are determined through regularized fits performed with
rescaled ridge regression [43], which minimizes the quadratic error plus the term Λ(a2 +b2 )
that penalizes large values of the parameters. The regularization is necessary to avoid
13

amplifying the noise due to covariant explanatory variables, as in the present case, and
it allows more robust parameter estimation, often avoiding that they acquire unphysical
values with incorrect sign, at the price of some bias. Rescaled ridge regression yields
non-vanishing parameters even in the limit of large Λ, overcoming a drawback of other
regularization schemes, and it fixes the parameter Λ based on an analogy with statistical mechanics at the transition between the phase dominated by the noise and the one
dominated by the bias.
For ridge regression there is no analytic formula to determine the statistical error of
the fitting parameters, therefore I applied a bootstrap approach, repeating the fit while
eliminating each of the data points and computing the standard deviation of the fitting
parameters numerically.
Models (1G,2G,3G) coupled to the Gaussian distribution depend on three parameters
but only
√ the parameters a and b were fitted while c was fixed, fitting − ln(Pd ) − c =
aA − b A. The parameter c was determined not by minimizing the fit error but by
selecting the value of c that yields 50% relative error on the parameters a and b. The
plots shown in Fig.1 were obtained in this way.

Prediction for SARS
The models fitted to SARS-CoV-2 were rescaled in order to apply them to SARS-CoV,
adopting the ratio between the binding rates of the spike proteins of both viruses to ACE2.
The most precise measures available in the literature are kSARS−2 = (2.3±1.4)105 nM −1 s−1
and kSARS = (1.7±0.7)105 nM −1 s−1 (table 1 in [93]). Although the error bars are huge, the
greater rate constant of SARS-CoV-2 agrees with the more precisely determined binding
affinity from the same table (KSARS−2 = (1.2 ± 0.1)nM and KSARS = (5.0 ± 0.1)nM), and
from Ref. [92] that indicates that the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 has greater affinity
for ACE than the one of SARS-CoV. In that paper only one experiment was performed
instead of five in Ref. [93] and the binding rate constant was greater for SARS-CoV, which
is consistent with the large statistical errors measured in Ref. [93]. Thus, although the
available data is quite noisy, the best available evidence suggests that the binding rate
of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is on the average faster than for SARS and the binding is
more stable, which may also contribute to faster adsorption giving the virus more time
to perform membrane fusion.
For predicting the CFR of the 2003 SARS outbreak, I used the parameters of SARSon
CoV-2 and rescaled them with the ratio between the kinetic binding
√ constant k of the
two spike proteins: aSARS = aSARS−2 /1.35
√ and bSARS = bSARS−2 / 1.35. I obtained the
lethality profile as exp(−aSARS A + bSARS A), where A is the ACE2 level of each sex and
age class, and multiplied it times a constant factor that accounts for the different fraction
of undetected cases, which was the only free parameter determined through a fit.
