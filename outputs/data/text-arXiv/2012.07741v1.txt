ABSTRACT
The use of technology has been ubiquitous in efforts to combat the ongoing public health crisis
due to emergence and spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. African countries have made
tremendous use of technology to disseminate information, counter the spread of COVID-19, and
develop cutting-edge techniques to help with diagnosis, treatment and management of patients.
The nature and outcomes of these efforts sometimes differ in Africa compared to other areas of
the world due to its unique challenges and opportunities. Several countries have developed
innovative technology-driven solutions to cater to a diverse population with varying access to
technology. Much of the efforts are also earmarked by a flexible approach to problem solving,
local tech entrepreneurship, and swift adoption of cutting-edge technology.

INTRODUCTION
The first cases of COVID-19 in Africa and sub-Saharan Africa were reported in Egypt and
Nigeria on February 14th and 27th 2020, respectively (Figure 1).(1,2) As of September 27,
1,460,084 cases, 35,445 deaths and 1,206,237 recoveries have been reported across the
continent.(3) The response to COVID-19 across Africa has varied with some countries
implementing stringent physical distancing interventions and integrating data and analytics into
their response, while others have not. However, since the start of the pandemic, governments,
organizations and individuals have repurposed existing technologies and created novel
innovations to fight COVID-19. We provide a comprehensive review of how technology and
innovation has been used for enforcing physical distancing interventions, spreading awareness,
tracking cases, diagnosing disease, contact tracing, clinical management of disease, and
addressing misinformation.

Figure 1. Timeline of first reported cases of COVID-19 in each of the African countries.

We conducted a literature review on August 24th and 25th, 2020 using Google, Google Scholar
and PubMed. We searched for articles using the following broad search terms: “[Country] AND
Coronavirus AND Technology”. The search was conducted for each of the 54 African countries.
To supplement this search, we also searched for “Africa AND Coronavirus AND Technology” to
identify articles that were missed in the country-specific searches. We included articles if they
mentioned the use of technology in the control of COVID-19 in any of countries. Due to the
novelty of the pandemic, most of the relevant literature identified were not found in peer
reviewed publications. The included articles were from trusted news sites, government, and
organization websites such as, the United Nations and the World Health Organization. The
articles included in this review can be grouped into (1) disease prevention, (2) tracking cases, (3)
healthcare and (4) addressing misinformation.

MAIN TEXT
Disease prevention
Enforcing Physical Distancing Interventions
Some African countries implemented physical distancing interventions before and after
confirming the first COVID-19 case. The interventions ranged from border closures to
lockdowns lasting days, weeks or months.(4) Enforcing these physical distancing interventions
has been challenging and countries have adopted technology in different ways to “flatten the
curve”. For example, Ethiopia introduced an internet-based transportation payment system to

3

enforce distancing for bus travelers.(5) Similarly, the government of Sierra Leone developed an
electronic pass (e-pass) management system to limit movement to essential workers (i.e.,
individuals needed to maintain essential services such as, supply of food, medical resources,
gasoline, electricity, water and telecommunications) during the national lockdown. Individuals
wishing to move could apply for an e-pass and receive confirmation of acceptance or rejection
via SMS within 12 hours.(6) The Sierra Leone government also used drones to capture images to
assess citizen compliance during lockdown in Freetown,.(7) Drones were also used to enforce
lockdowns and physical distancing in South Africa, Morocco and Tunisia by issuing warnings
and announcements, and questioning people on the street about their reasons for being out.(8–10)

Awareness and Hygiene
From the start of the pandemic, African countries have used innovative approaches to spread
awareness and hygiene messages. For example, the Rwandan National Police deployed drones to
spread COVID-19 awareness messages, while in Ghana, drones were used for disinfecting public
places.(11,12)

Startups, governments and UN organizations also used existing technologies to support COVID19 response efforts. Existing tech-enabled supply chains (e-commerce) were used to source and
distribute hygiene equipment to various parts of Kenya.(13) Ushahidi, a decade-old Kenyan tech
innovation, was used worldwide to ask and receive help during lockdown, gather information
about the virus and report contamination.(14) A startup in Morocco released a bot which
answered questions regarding COVID-19 in Arabic.(15) In Uganda, the UN Innovations Data
Lab used machine learning to deploy a text-to-speech radio monitoring technology to gather

4

first-hand incidents and local opinions and beliefs about the pandemic. The data gathered could
be used to identify areas with greatest need of healthcare resources, combat misinformation and
gauge the social and economic impacts of lockdown.(16) While in Guinea, the government
capitalized on bulk SMS messaging and broadcasted information through caller ringtones in the
various regional languages.(17)

There were also locally designed interventions used to spread awareness and hygiene messaging.
For example, an automatic hand sanitizer dispenser developed in Senegal was used to reduce the
need for supervised handwashing.(18) A contactless electrical soap dispenser was developed and
used in communities in Ethiopia.(19) Similarly, a solar-powered hand washing sink was
developed by local innovators in Ghana and a touchless handwashing station was developed and
distributed in Uganda.(20,21)

Medical Supplies
To address the challenge posed by a lack of medical supplies, some countries have adopted
technology in the printing and distribution of certain medical supplies such as, masks, test kits
and ventilators. 3D printing and drones have been used to make and deliver medical supplies,
respectively. For instance, drones were used to deliver medical products and testing samples to
labs in Rwanda and Ghana, respectively.(22) Drones were also used to deliver personal
protective equipment (PPE) and COVID-19 test kits in these countries.(23,24)

5

In Kenya, the 3D printing community printed affordable PPE, plastic face shields and ventilator
adaptors that allow doctors to treat two to four patients at the same time.(25) 3D printing was
used to develop personal protective equipment in Cameroon, Egypt and the Gambia.(26–28)
Local inventors in Uganda created plastic motorcycle shields to keep motorcycle taxis running
during the pandemic.(29)

There have also been efforts to locally develop ventilators. For example, a cheap, portable,
automatic ventilator made by a Nigerian student was used in COVID-19 wards to combat the
shortage of ventilators.(30) Similarly, a young inventor in Ethiopia created a ventilator that used
a plastic pouch, mechanical ventilator and a screen operated from a phone.(31) Students at the
Fourah Bay College in Sierra Leone also developed a mechanical ventilator.(32)

Furthermore, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the African Union created the Africa
Medical Supplies Platform, a collaborative platform that operates across national boundaries and
partners with African governments at all levels to connect COVID-19 response teams with
medical supplies.(33,34)

Tracking cases
Assessing Risk and Tracking Cases/Burden
Several countries developed dashboards that were used for monitoring the number of cases and
deaths.(35–38) In Rwanda, a GIS system was used to track cases at the household level and the
data was used to assess the need for lockdown measures and other public-health

6

interventions.(39) Post lockdown, South Africa adapted a technology used for identifying
rhinoceros poaching hotspots and integrated with health and location data to spot new COVID19 case clusters in their community.(40)

Sierra Leone launched a symptom checker and COVID-19 information resource that can be used
with and without the internet.(41) The system can be accessed via SMS and a previously
launched USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) portal which was developed to
provide timely information to its residents. On April 26, there had been about 250,000 USSD
responses.(42) Residents in Ghana could dial a USSD code on a phone after which, they were
prompted to answer questions about their symptoms, age, travel history etc. The data collected
was aggregated and analyzed to predict if the person was likely to get the virus. This tool was
accessible by most people since it did not require a smartphone to operate an app or website.(43)
Additionally, a COVID-tracking app was also released in Ghana to track cases based on location,
enforce adherence to quarantine rules and reach out to people who needed to quarantine.(44)
Humanitarian agencies also used satellite imagery and data to map and identify high-risk areas to
generate situational awareness and capacity.(26) Researchers in Burkina Faso used
phenomenological models to characterize the growth of the COVID-19 outbreak and forecast
future growth. (45)

Tunisian agencies used Tableau dashboards to analyze calls made to the country’s general
emergency number (which saw two years’ worth of calls in less than a month due to the
pandemic) in order to find patients who needed immediate attention.(46) In Nigeria, a digital
triage tool was used to assess the user’s risk to COVID-19 based on their answer to a curated

7

questionnaire.(47) A WhatsApp bot developed in South Africa was used to deliver health alerts
to people.(48) In Algeria, a free mobile self-diagnosis and case-monitoring application was
developed and deployed in Arabic.(49) Ethiopia has developed dedicated mobile phone apps for
recording personal identification information at ports of entry and followed it up with the
traveler’s temperature. This information was further used by a COVID-19 surveillance and
tracking system for contact tracing activities. Additionally, a data collection tool was developed
to gather data during door-to-door COVID-19 screening campaigns.(50)

Contact Tracing
The official triaging app in Ghana was used to augment the contact tracing efforts of the
government by recording the location of app users.(51) In South Africa, handsets equipped with
location-tracking technology were distributed in the hardest-hit areas to perform contact
tracing.(52) Tunisia launched a contact tracing mobile phone app which alerted users if they
have been in close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19.(53) In Rwanda,
contact tracing was performed by tracing infections through the paperless Open Data Kit
application.(54)

Genomic epidemiology has also played a significant role in understanding the spread of COVID19 in some countries. Ghanaian scientists were among the first to sequence the SARS-Cov-2 in
Africa using local resources.(55) Zambian scientists used nanopore sequencing to track
mutations in SARS-CoV-2, understand the origin of cases and track people in the chain of
infection.(56) Similarly, Gambian scientists traced the origin of the first six cases in their country

8

by sequencing the virus strain from cases and mapping it to eleven other strains of Asian,
American and European origin.(57)

Diagnosing Disease
Testing capacity remains a challenge in many African countries. A lab in Senegal has developed
at-home test kits for COVID-19 that could cost as low as $1 per kit and can provide results in ten
minutes.(58) They are undergoing trials and can be rapidly produced in massive amounts, if
given the go-ahead. Furthermore, sample pooling for COVID-19 testing which involves testing
samples from many people at once has been used in some countries. The growing pressure to test
more people for COVID-19 has made pooling an attractive option since it conserves chemical
reagents, time and money. Researchers in Rwanda have come up with an improved manner of
group testing that could reduce the cost of testing from 9 USD to 0.75 USD per person.(59) In
response to Ebola, Measles and now COVID-19 outbreaks, Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC) has been steadily ramping up investment in laboratory capacity and more importantly,
genomic surveillance with DNA databases in order to trace the path of transmission and explain
dynamics of the outbreak.(60) Furthermore, an open-source software developed in Tunisia was
used to compare chest X-rays of patients suspected of having the virus to X-rays of patients with
confirmed COVID-19 disease.(61)

Home-grown swab tests in Uganda have brought down the prohibitive 65USD per test cost of
COVID-19 testing. These tests can also be used for point-of-care deployment in remote
areas.(62) Makerere University in Uganda has built innovations like thermal imaging for
detecting COVID-19.(63)

Healthcare
Clinical Management
Telehealth has been adopted in several countries for clinical management. For example,
telehealth has gained traction in Uganda to prevent congestion and spread of COVID-19 in
healthcare facilities.(64) In Eswatini, ongoing in-person care of TB and HIV patients was
adapted for no-contact care by asking patients to film a video while taking the required
medications and send it to a nurse who monitors their health.(65) In Rwanda, a digital-first
solution was developed to encourage COVID-19 patients to self-care at home instead of
overcrowding their healthcare system, leaving the urgent care free for critically ill patients.(66)
A telehealth platform, created by a Libyan entrepreneur to connect healthcare professionals in
the diaspora to patients in their home countries, became the go-to app for triaging of COVID-19
patients in Libya.(67) Telehealth usage surged in Ghana and demonstrated that time-taking,
manual clinical management can be replaced with a less stressful technology-driven solution.(68)
Egypt’s broadband network has been leveraged to deploy telehealth solutions for primary care
units.(69)

Several innovative tools were used throughout Africa in the clinical management of patients. For
example, in a bid to minimize contact of health workers with COVID-19 patients, robots were
deployed in healthcare settings in Rwanda to perform simple tasks like taking temperature,
monitoring the health of patients, delivering food and medicine etc.(70) Similarly, a hospital in
Tunisia used a robot to take the pulse, check temperature and blood oxygen levels of patients to

10

limit contact between patients and clinicians.(71,72) Student engineers in Senegal used their
technical skills to create inventions to alleviate the burden of the COVID-19 problem. One such
example was in the designing of a small robot called ‘Dr. Car’ that would measure the
temperature and blood pressure of infected patients at hospitals, reducing the risk of exposure to
healthcare workers. Additionally, the robot could also ease patient-doctor communications
during treatment, especially in hard to reach rural areas.(73)

Digital solutions have played an important role in the care and management of health for
COVID-19 as well as non-COVID patients. For example, an app for pregnant mothers in Uganda
provided up-to-date guidelines on practicing social distancing during pregnancy, handling
unexpected situations and healthcare information.(74) The Moroccan Ministry of Health
introduced an app platform for healthcare professionals to promote fast exchange of knowledge
on COVID-19 with other healthcare professionals.(75) A healthcare platform in Benin was used
to connect hospitals and different healthcare stakeholders on a single platform saving the time
spent on procuring patients’ medical records.(76) A voice and SMS messaging system for HIV
patients was repurposed by Ugandan researchers to support quarantined individuals and flag
potential concerns.(77)

Other innovations include, medicine delivery by connecting COVID-19 patients with pharmacies
in Egypt and ride-hailing apps that offered doorstep delivery services for medical necessities
such as contraceptives, pregnancy and HIV tests in Uganda.(78,79)

11

Addressing misinformation
COVID-19 misinformation has been considered a major issue affecting the control of the
pandemic. Inaccurate information on the SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19 disease has
prevented people from following the correct preventive guidelines and prompted them to accept
hoax cures. For instance, in Namibia, elephant dung was briefly sold for exorbitant prices with a
claim to cure COVID-19.(80)

To address misinformation, several African governments, organizations and communities have
launched efforts that use technology and context-specific approaches.(81) The Nigerian Health
Ministry used WhatsApp push notifications to broadcast accurate information about COVID-19,
its treatment, symptoms and prevention.(82) Residents in Sierra Leone could verify information
seen on social media and other sources through their USSD portal, which can assist in combating
misinformation.(83) Relatedly, Benin set up an official digital platform which was accessible to
all its citizens, to broadcast accurate information on COVID-19. It has a flash news functionality
to respond to instantaneous fake news.(84) The Moroccan government passed a controversial bill
to stem the spread of fake news by making it illegal and detainable by law.(85)

There were also opportunities for youths to be involved in combating misinformation. For
example, a knowledge synthesis team in Ethiopia curated and analyzed information on COVID19 daily and produced updated treatment and prevention guidelines which were then published
by the Ethiopian Ministry through all available social media channels in order to combat
misinformation.(86) Similarly, Zimbabwean youths combed through online comments on social
media in order to dispel incorrect statements made by the general public about COVID-19.(87)

12

Volunteers in Sudan used online platforms to educate the public about COVID-19 and dispel
rumors.(88) Niger also launched an audio-visual campaign and trained numerous young people
to make videos that counter fake news or misinformation on COVID-19 and disseminate them
online.(89)

Radio and other media (including, TV and social media) have been used in Zambia, Mali and
Uganda to debunk fake news, and deliver reliable and accurate information on the pandemic in
local languages.(90–92) In Ghana, young healthcare workers and volunteers visit high risk areas
to spread information.(92) When technology was not an option, such as for some areas in Chad
where families did not have resources to own a radio, traditional storytellers (troubadours) have
been spreading COVID-19 prevention messages to combat rumors. Awareness posters were also
used to serve such off-the-grid areas.(93) While most efforts on fighting misinformation have
been commendable, there has also been troubling news that laws passed by some African
countries in order to curb misinformation were used to curb citizen privacy and press
freedom.(94)

Challenges
While technology has been adopted to address many COVID-19 related concerns, it is difficult
to measure their impact on controlling the pandemic. Furthermore, challenges still persist that
limit the adoption of new technologies. For example, tele-health has gained traction as a safe
alternative to in-person clinical visits; however, its widespread adoption is impeded by internet
connectivity (or lack thereof) and geographical limitations to accessing medicine deliveries and
lab sample pick-ups.(95) The COVID-19 pandemic has brought a focus to the need for data,

13

digital connectivity and technology among countries in Africa. For digital health solutions to
succeed and be accessible to everyone, barriers to widespread distribution of the internet needs to
be addressed and all stakeholders must cooperate to come up with a resilient, affordable,
scalable, long-term plan that enables rapid deployment.

Furthermore, local innovations continue to highlight the need to invest in and adopt “home
grown” technology that can assist in the control of future outbreaks and improve public health
across the continent. Solutions to health crises should not be left to local and international
experts, youth and community health workers should be included in pandemic planning and
response conversations. The median age across the African continent is 19 years, and many of
these young people have innovative ideas and are passionate about developing technology and
using data to address local problems.(96) For example, tech startups are being funded in Nigeria
to come up with innovative solutions that promote primary care, improve efficiency of health
processes, communicate health risks, assist patients with self-triage etc.(97) Morocco has a
dedicated industrial base for unmanned flight technology, however most of its drones are
imported from China. The pandemic has prompted the rise of startups with the aim to build
drones in Morocco for thermal surveillance and disinfectant-spraying.(98) Several startups in
Morocco have been funded to assist with solutions for tackling COVID-19, including one that
uses 3D printers to develop masks, PPE and ventilators for hospitals. The Tunisian
entrepreneurial ecosystem financed several scientific ideas which have promising impact on the
pandemic crisis.(99) Egyptian IT Agency’s dedicated innovation and entrepreneurship center
supported hackathons for building different parts of a COVID-19 response system that helps

14

people, disrupted businesses and health agencies.(100) If sustained, these technological advances
can lead to long-term improvements in public health infrastructure in Africa.

Furthermore, limitations identified during this pandemic can be used to spur the development of
better public health surveillance systems. It has been recommended to create genomic hubs in
well-placed locations throughout the continent so that Africa can rapidly generate and curate
genomic data related to outbreaks.(101) Point-of-care diagnostic services (on-location healthcare
including testing, scanning etc.) supplemented with machine learning and information systems
should be prioritized in combating the ongoing pandemic and future outbreaks, since they have
proved their necessity in previous healthcare epidemics like HIV.(102) The development of
reliable disease detection systems including, diagnostics, monitoring and developing wellequipped health facilities can help countries to prepare for future outbreaks.(103)

CONCLUSION
Africa has a long history of combating disease epidemics, which has proven extremely useful in
combating the COVID-19 pandemic across the continent. This experience in fighting epidemics
has been channeled to build resilient public health responses to COVID-19 elsewhere in the
world.(104) However, to create significant advances in healthcare, African nations must invest in
technologies (such as AI, satellite imagery, drones, robotics, 3D printing, cloud computing). This
should include investment in human capital, and establishing legal and regulatory frameworks
that govern the use of these technologies. This will facilitate innovation, encourage financial
investment and foster entrepreneurship. Combining technology with well-established public

15

health techniques for combating epidemics would enable governments to solve problems quicker
and more robustly if used sensibly and ethically.
