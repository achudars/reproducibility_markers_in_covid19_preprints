COVID-19 | spreading pattern | trajectory data | activity centroid |
human mobility | Kendall model

Here, we fill this gap by leveraging the trajectory data of
197,808 smartphone users (including 17,808 anonymous confirmed cases) in 9 cities in China. To have a comprehensive
analysis, we select confirmed cases from Wuhan (where the
initial outbreak of COVID-19 took place in China), Beijing
and Urumqi (the cities with COVID-19 resurgences) and other
cities (where cases were mainly imported). We try to address the following three questions: 1) Does the spreading
of COVID-19 in different cities have a universal pattern? 2)
What is the underlying mechanism for the spreading pattern
of COVID-19? 3) How to utilize such a spreading pattern for
control and prevention of COVID-19? We find a universal
spreading pattern existing in all cities: the spatial distribution
of confirmed cases follows a power-law-like model and the
spreading centroid is time-invariant. Moreover, we reveal that
human mobility in a city drives the spatial-temporal spreading process: long average travelling distance results in a high
growth rate of spreading radius and wide spatial diffusion of
confirmed cases. With such insight, we can accurately predict the shapes of spatial distribution of cases and the time
when the peak of COVID-19 cases arrives. Our results unveil
the underlying mechanism behind the spatial-temporal urban
evolution of COVID-19, and can be used to evaluate the performance of mobility restriction policies implemented by many
governments and to estimate the evolving spreading situation
of COVID-19.

Currently, the global situation of COVID-19 is aggravating, pressingly
calling for efficient control and prevention measures. Understanding
spreading pattern of COVID-19 has been widely recognized as a vital step for implementing non-pharmaceutical measures. Previous
studies investigated such an issue in large-scale (e.g., inter-country
or inter-state) scenarios while urban spreading pattern still remains
an open issue. Here, we fill this gap by leveraging the trajectory
data of 197,808 smartphone users (including 17,808 anonymous confirmed cases) in 9 cities in China. We find a universal spreading pattern in all cities: the spatial distribution of confirmed cases follows
a power-law-like model and the spreading centroid is time-invariant.
Moreover, we reveal that human mobility in a city drives the spatialtemporal spreading process: long average travelling distance results
in a high growth rate of spreading radius and wide spatial diffusion of
confirmed cases. With such insight, we adopt Kendall model to simulate urban spreading of COVID-19 that can well fit the real spreading process. Our results unveil the underlying mechanism behind
the spatial-temporal urban evolution of COVID-19, and can be used
to evaluate the performance of mobility restriction policies implemented by many governments and to estimate the evolving spreading situation of COVID-19.

s of Dec. 18, COVID-19 has struck over 222 countries,
resulting in 72,851,747 cases and 1,643,339 deaths(1). The
maximum of global daily new cases have exceeded 600,000, and
situations in many countries are increasingly aggravating. It is
pressing to find efficient ways to suppress the transmission of
SARS-CoV-2(2–8), which has been recognized as top priority
since the very beginning of the initial outbreak in China and
reiterated by the multidisciplinary online conference on Aug.
3, 2020, organized by the World Health Organization(9).
Recently, resurgences of COVID-19 have been reported
in many countries (e.g., United Kingdom, France, Spain).
When a local resurgence takes place(10, 11), a fundamental
issue for practical control and prevention is how does COVID19 spread temporally and spatially within a city? Previous
studies have investigated wide-range (e.g., inter-country or
inter-state) spreading patterns of infectious diseases(12–15).
They fall short for urban scenario, since the spreading of
infectious diseases is highly dependent on spatial scale(16).
Moreover, the difficulty in obtaining fine-grained trajectory
data of infectious cases has hindered the in-depth investigation
of urban spreading pattern(17). As such, little is known about
the urban spreading pattern of COVID-19 so far, one of the
most important spreading characteristics.

Significance Statement
By leveraging the trajectory data of 197,808 smartphone users
(including 17,808 anonymous confirmed cases) in 9 cities in
China, we find a universal spreading pattern in all cities: the
spatial distribution of confirmed cases follows a power-lawlike model and the spreading centroid is time-invariant. Moreover, we reveal that human mobility in a city drives the spatialtemporal spreading process: long average travelling distance
results in a high growth rate of spreading radius and wide spatial diffusion of confirmed cases. Our results unveil the underlying mechanism behind the spatial-temporal urban evolution
of COVID-19, and can be used to evaluate the performance of
mobility restriction policies implemented by many governments
and to estimate the evolving spreading situation of COVID-19.

Characterize the Activity Centroids of Confirmed Cases. We

adopt a collection of trajectory data contributed by anonymous
smartphone users in China. The trajectory data record activity
locations and corresponding timestamps when smartphone
users are using location-based services. Clearly, these data
reflect the real-time activity locations of smartphone users, at
which they might get infected or infect others. To see how the
spreading of COVID-19 is spatially correlated with the activity
locations of confirmed cases, we first characterize their activity
locations by a statistical metric: activity centroid (denoted by
σ). The activity centroid of a smartphone user is defined as
the average of activity locations reported by this smartphone
user within a given period (e.g., 1 month).nThat is, assuming
o
that there are Nj activity locations P j =

j
P1j , P2j , · · · , PN
j

for a smartphone user j, the
P activity centroid σj for user j, is
defined as σj = E P j = k Pkj /Nj .

We illustrate the calculation of activity centroid σ in Fig.
1A. The activity centroid should be stable over time for most
smartphone users so that it can represent the intrinsic characteristic of activity locations. For this purpose, we randomly
select 20,000 smartphone users in Wuhan and calculate their activity centroids in different periods (1 to 6 months), obtaining
6 activity centroids σj (t), t ∈ [1, 6] for each smartphone user
j. The distances between
P6 6 activity centroids and the average
centroid (i.e., σj =
σ (t)/6) for each j are then calcut=1 j
lated. The mean and standard variance of these 6 distances for
each user are computed and the cumulative distributions of all
smartphone users are displayed in Figs. 1B and 1C. Clearly,
the mean values of 95.3% smartphone users are less than 1.5
kilometer (Km) and the standard variance is relatively small.
This implies that the activity locations of smartphone users
exhibit strong stability, independent of the chosen period (see
sensitivity analysis of the periods in Fig. S2). Such an intrinsic
behavior can be well captured by the activity centroid.

The Temporal Spreading Pattern. To characterize the temporal
spreading pattern, we divide the spreading duration in each
city into L equal periods, and allocate confirmed cases in set U
into subset Ui if their confirmation dates are within ith period,
i ≤ L. An illustration of division is provided in the x-axis
index of Figs. 2A, C and E, where L = 10. Given a set U of all
confirmed cases, we are able to calculate the overall spreading
centroid (denoted by ρ) of U as the average of their activity
centroids, i.e., ρ = E(σ), where σ = {σj }j∈U . The cumulative
spreading centroid is then defined as corresponding cumulative
value until ith period, thatSis, the averages of activity centroids
i
of confirmed cases in set k=1 Uk .
We display the difference between the overall spreading
centroid and cumulative spreading centroid until ith period in
Figs. 2A, C and E for Wuhan, Beijing and Urumqi, respectively.
Interestingly, as the situation of COVID-19 evolves, cumulative
spreading centroids at different periods in Wuhan, Beijing
and Urumqi are close to the overall spreading centroid: the
Mean Absolute Errors (MAE) between cumulative and overall
spreading centroids in Wuhan, Beijing and Urumqi are 0.3
Km, 0.4 Km and 0.7 Km, respectively. It is clear to see that
the temporal spreading centroid of COVID-19 has a feature
of time invariance. That is, the spreading centroid is stable
and nearly does not migrate during COVID-19 spreading.
We now
P study the spreading radius γ of set U , defined
as γ =
d(σj , ρ)/|U |, where d(·) is the Euclidean disj∈U
tance between the activity centroid of a confirmed case and
the spreading centroid ρ of a set U of confirmed cases, and
|U | denotes the number of confirmed cases in U . Obviously,
the spreading radius quantifies the mean distance between
confirmed cases’ activity centroids and the spreading centroid.
Similarly,
we introduce cumulative spreading radius for set
Si
U . The cumulative spreading radius in different periods
k=1 i
increase slowly over time in these three cities except for periods
with few cases (less than 10 cases).
We also conduct analysis for the other 6 cities with relative
large number of confirmed cases in China: Xiaogan, Suizhou,
Xiangyang, Huanggang, Guangzhou and Wenzhou (Fig. S4),
where cases are mainly imported. Similar conclusions for
spreading centroid and spreading radius can be made in these
cities. We proceed to perform sensitivity analysis by varying
the number of spreading period L (Fig. S3) and find that L
does not have much impact on the observed temporal pattern.
Therefore, the temporal spreading pattern of COVID-19 in
China features time invariance of spreading centroid and slow
growth of spreading radius.
As can be seen in Figs. 2 and S4, there are significant
disparities in growth rate of spreading radius in different cities
and different time periods. To find intrinsic mechanisms for
these disparities, we first divide the spreading period T (T in
Beijing for instance lasted from June 11 to July 10 with 30
days) of each city into two periods L1 and L2 (L1 in Beijing for
instance lasted from June 11 to June 25 with 15 days). Then,
two spreading radii (R1 and R2 ) can be calculated based on
activity centroids of confirmed cases reported in the spreading
periods L1 and L2 , respectively. We define the growth rate of
spreading radius as 2(R2 − R1 )/|T |, where |T | denotes number
of days in spreading period T . Further, we randomly select
20,000 smartphone users in each city and leverage their trajectory data during the outbreak of COVID-19 to compute their
mean travel distance. Since these smartphone users are ran-

The most frequently visiting location (MVL) is also a statistical metric of great interest. It indicates the activity location
that a smartphone user visits most frequently. We calculate
the percentage of top k (k = 1, 2, · · · , 5) activity locations
of each smartphone user and show the average of all 20,000
smartphone users in Figs. S1A-S1C. The MVL (i.e., top 1
activity location) only accounts for about 45% of all activity locations, that is, more than one half of activity location
information is not utilized by MVL to characterize the activity behavior. Further, the performance of the metric of
top k activity locations approaches that of activity centroid
when k increases (see detailed information in Figs. S1D-S1I).
Therefore, we choose activity centroid as the statistical metric
instead of MVL in this article.
By collaborating with Westlake Institute for Data Intelligence and local institutions for disease control and prevention,
we obtain a dataset of confirmed cases who are also smartphone users for location-based services, including their activity
centroids and dates of confirmation (see details on the data
description in supplementary materials). We visualize the
spreading process of COVID-19 in Wuhan through heat map
in Fig. 1D. The introduction of activity centroid enables us
to quantify the spatial and temporal spreading pattern of
COVID-19 in the following sections.

The Spatial Spreading Pattern. To characterize and visualize

The Underlying Mechanism. The classic susceptible-infected-

recovered model (SIR) and its variants have been widely
adopted to understand the transmission characteristics of
infectious diseases. The Kendall model (19–21) introduces the
spatial dimension to the SIR model and can be used to explain the spatial-temporal evolution of infectious diseases. Its
differential equations can be expressed as equations (1)-(3) of
supplementary materials. Note that confirmed cases in China
get isolated for medical treatment once they are confirmed and
would not cause further infection. Under such a condition, the
confirmed cases can be regarded as recovered individuals in
Kendall model. Then, the differential equation for proportion
of recovered individuals can be written as
∂R
= −λR(x, t) + λI0 (x)
∂t 


Z ∞

λ 1 − exp −
R(y, t)K(x − y)dy
.
λ −∞

[1]

where R(x, t) denotes the proportion of recovered individuals
at location x and time t, satisfying R(x, 0) = 0. Note that λ
can be obtained by inverse of the basic regeneration number
R0 in the model, that is, λ = 1/R0 = γ/βξ, where γ, β, ξ
represents recovery rate, infection rate and the number of
initial susceptible individuals, respectively.
Besides, the kernel
R∞
function K(x − y) > 0, satisfying −∞ K(y)dy = 1, quantifies
the probability that an infected individual at location y visits x.
Here, we use power-law distribution to describe the city-level
movement behaviors(22), which can be written as K(∆r) =
∆rη . Hereby, K(∆r) represents the probability for the step
size ∆r and η, the power-law exponential, denotes the travel
willingness, which has a strong correlation with the mean
travelling distance.
To fit the model for recovered individuals, we first calculate
the parameter η in the power-law distribution by utilizing the
mobility data of anonymous smartphone users, with which to
capture the inherent human movement behaviors for each city.
Moreover, the diagnosed date for each confirmed case and
corresponding activity centroid are also calculated as input of
the model. Through the fitting the model (i.e., equation (1))
based on these precalculated parameters and Least Squares
algorithm, we can finally obtain a set of optimal parameters
(λ and I0 (x)). Note that we assume initial confirmed cases
originates from the grid (0, 0). The parameter I0 (x) fitted in
the model could therefore be written as I0 (0, 0). A detailed
discussion about Kendall model and parameter fitting process
are provided in supplementary materials.
Figs. 4A-4C illustrate the evolution of recovered individuals R(x, t) under different timestamps for Wuhan, Beijing
and Urumqi, in which Root-Mean-Square-Error (RMSE) is
also added to quantify the performance of model fitting. The
values of RMSE for Wuhan, Beijing and Urumqi during whole
spreading period are 0.55, 0.18 and 0.57 respectively, indicating that the evolution of recovered individuals R(x, t) during

spatial spreading pattern, we divide the geographical area into
grids of 1Km × 1Km(18). The overall spreading centroid is
set as the original point of grids. Confirmed cases of COVID19 are then projected into grids according to their activity
centroids. As illustrated in Figs. 3A-3C, three-dimensional
histograms are used to describe the spatial distributions of
confirmed cases in Wuhan, Beijing and Urumqi, respectively,
where the height of each bar represents the case count in each
grid. To analyze the spatial distribution function F (d), we
first apply the logarithm to the number of confirmed cases
and the distance from overall spreading centroid in all cities.
The spatial distributions F (d) of Beijing, Urumqi, Xiaogan,
Suizhou and Huanggang exhibit a prominent linear pattern
(Figs. 3E-3F, Figs. S5 and S6), indicating that the spatial
distributions in these cities follow power-law model. Therefore,
we adopt F (d) = dα for linear regression. Specifically, we
have α = −1.80 for Beijing (the Pearson correlation: -0.93)
and α = −2.15 for Urumqi (the Pearson correlation: -0.93),
respectively.
As shown in Fig. 3D, the spatial distribution of confirmed
cases in Wuhan is power-law-like since it deviates slightly
from power-law model when d is small. Due to the influence
of human mobility pattern in Wuhan during the lockdown
period (Fig. S7A), initial cases have a higher probability
to infect susceptible individuals around spreading centroid.
As a result, the risk of infection around spreading centroid
is much higher than that at distant locations (a significant
92% of cases are close to the spreading centroid). To have
a more accurate quantification of the spatial distribution of
Wuhan, we divide the area into two parts by their distance to
the spreading centroid, and adopt two different models to fit
the data. Specifically, spatial distribution of confirmed cases
around spreading centroid (d ≤ 18) is fitted by an exponential
model F (d) = αd , and that when d > 18 is fitted by a powerlaw model. As illustrated in Fig. 3D, F (d), d ≤ 18 is well fitted
by an exponential model with Pearson correlation of −0.99 and
F (d), d > 18 is well fitted by a power-law model with Pearson
correlation of −0.96. This indicates that spatial distribution of
confirmed cases in Wuhan indeed has different characteristics,
depending on the distance to the spreading centroid. We also
observe the similar phenomenon in Xiangyang (Fig. S5F).
Interestingly, we find that this is mainly determined by human
mobility pattern (to be elaborated in the next Section).
We also notice that for cities (such as Guangzhou and

Wenzhou) where imported cases are widely scattered, the
spatial spreading pattern is less prominent. It is clear that
there are multiple clusters of confirmed cases in these two cities
(Fig. S6), which impacts the power-law-like spatial spreading.
Therefore, the observed spreading pattern does not apply to
the case with multiple infection sources.

T

domly selected, we use this mean distance (over 20,000 users)
to approximate that of all citizens in each city. Clearly, a large
value of mean travel distance reflects a strong willingness of
people for long distance travelling. Considering that different control measures imposed in Wuhan and Urumqi since
the outbreak of COVID-19 affected corresponding mobility
pattern and spreading of pandemic significantly (Fig. S7),
we divide the spreading period of these two cities into two
sub-periods: before and after the implementation of travel restriction, and then calculate mean travel distance and growth
rate of spreading radius in these two sub-periods, respectively.
The correlation analysis results for all 9 cites are illustrated in
Fig. 2G. Interestingly, we observe a clear positive correlation
between mean travel distance and growth rate of spreading
radius, indicating that mobility pattern accelerates the urban
spreading of COVID-19.

centroids to study the spatial-temporal spreading pattern
of COVID-19 in China. Our results are complementary to
previous research, and will provide a fresh perspective to
understand the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. Our
findings can be used to find the most possible infection center
(spreading centroid), evaluate the growth rate and the infection
risk of different communities in a new outbreak of COVID19. Such information is very helpful for practical control and
prevention. One shortcoming of the study is that we do not
have the information of all confirmed cases in the studied cities.
Instead, we only obtain those who use location based services
and authorize their activity location data for research purposes.
This could bring potential bias to our analysis. To have a
valid conclusion, we study the spreading pattern of COVID-19
in 9 cities in China, and the results turn out to be consistent.
The selection of confirmed cases in our analysis can be viewed
as a result of random sampling from all the confirmed cases.
Therefore, the results have a good approximation.

spreading period can be well captured by the proposed Kendall
model. More results on the performance of model fitting can
be found in Fig. S8.
We proceed to study the impact of parameter η in the
model on spatial dispersion of confirmed cases, the number
of daily new confirmed cases, and growth rate of spreading
radius during the whole spreading period. To characterize
the spatial dispersion of confirmed cases, we introduce the
concept of Simpson Divergence: div = 1/Σi p2i , where pi represents the proportion of confirmed cases distributed in grids
whose distance to overall spreading centroid is within [i, i + 1].
Therefore, a small value of div reflects a high clustering of the
confirmed cases, i.e., a large proportion of confirmed cases are
distributed in a small number of grids. Fig. 4D illustrates the
impact of η on spatial dispersion of confirmed cases. We consider two scenarios under different basic regeneration number
R0 : R0 < 1 and R0 > 1. We see that, with the decrease of
η Simpson Divergence decreases to 1, at which all confirmed
cases are distributed in one grid. The impact of η on growth
rate of spreading radius is illustrated in Fig. 4G. Clearly, the
growth rate of spreading radius decreases with the decrease of
η, which is consistent with results in Fig. 4D. Figs. 4E and
4H show the impact of η on the number of daily reported confirmed cases. Interestingly, a large η, which means long mean
travelling distance in the human mobility model, results in
quick spreading of COVID-19, which makes the peak of daily
reported cases arrives early. This also shows that travel restriction policies will delay the peak arrival. Finally, we study
the impact of η on the growth rate of spreading radius. As we
can see in Figs. 4F and 4I, spreading radii under different η
increase with time and converge to a fix value when R0 > 1.
However, when R0 < 1, the spreading radius increases only
when η is relatively large. This indicates that when R0 < 1
and the mean travelling distance is also low, the pandemic
will not spread spatially. Therefore, η in the mobility model
drives the temporal-spatial spreading process. In practice, we
can optimize η by implementing a specific travel restriction
policy to have a desired control and prevention performance.
Discussion. Most previous studies investigated wide-range
(inter-country or inter-state) spreading patterns of infectious
diseases(12–15), revealing that the number of infected cases
at the destination has a strong correlation with total population and the weighted distance from the source to the
destination, which is determined by the corresponding population flow. Combining the population flow data and epidemic simulation model, these works accurately characterize
large-scale spatial-temporal spreading of epidemics (23) and
predict future spreading trends (24). Since the population flow
is driven by human mobility, existing works have examined
the intrinsic mechanism of how human mobility impacts the
spreading of diseases(16, 25) and provided theoretical insights
about how to mitigate transmission of epidemics through
travel restriction(26, 27). In particular, since the outbreak
of COVID-19, many studies have been done to find a more
effective and practical way of slowing down the spreading
of COVID-19 (28–32). Since the spatial-temporal spreading
pattern of infectious diseases is highly dependent on spatial
scale(16), previous works focused on the spreading patterns
between countries or states could not be applied to urban
scenario directly.
