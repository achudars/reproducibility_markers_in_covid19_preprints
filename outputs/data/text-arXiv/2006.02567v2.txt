Abstract
We present a corpus of 7,500 tweets annotated
with COVID-19 events, including positive
test results, denied access to testing, and
more. We show that our corpus enables
automatic identification of COVID-19 events
mentioned in Twitter with text spans that fill
a set of pre-defined slots for each event. We
also present analyses on the self-reporting
cases and user’s demographic information.
We will make our annotated corpus and
extraction tools available for the research
community to use upon publication at https:

Introduction

In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, SARSCoV-2, emerged and began rapidly spreading
around the world. In early 2020, many countries
initiated social distancing measures and lockdowns
to help slow the spread of the virus which has infected 5.5 million people and led to 347,864 deaths
as of 2020/05/26.1 Because COVID-19 is a novel
infectious disease, much is unknown about when
and where it is safe to resume various activities.
Official data on COVID-19, from agencies such as
the World Health Organization (WHO) or Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) present
aggregated views, such as the number of cases per
city or county. However, these datasets do not
capture statistics about more specific events that
might be of interest, for instance people who were
refused access to testing. On the other hand, people share a wide variety of information related to
COVID-19 publicly on social media. For example,
Twitter users often indicate when they might be at
increased risk of COVID-19 due to a coworker or

event.

other close contact testing positive for the virus, or
when they have symptoms but were denied access
to testing. Moreover, news reports on public figures
who are tested positive are also widely circulated
on social media, such as British PM Boris Johnson
and U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar’s husband.
In this paper, we show that it is possible to automatically extract structured knowledge on events
related to COVID-19 from Twitter. We annotate a
corpus of tweets describing positive/negative tests,
denied access to testing, deaths due to COVID-19,
etc. For each tweet that mentions one or more such
events, we further annotate text spans within the
tweet to fill a set of pre-defined slots that answer important questions (e.g., Who tested positive? Where
did they recently travel? Who is their employer?)
There are a number of important factors to consider when using COVID-related information from
Twitter. Facts should be independently verified before they are assumed to be true. However, we
believe that event extraction may be useful for epidemiologists, journalists or policymakers, helping
them find relevant pieces of information. Furthermore, our tools could enable new kinds of aggregate data analysis, which could prove useful so
long as consumers of this information clearly understand its limitations. We will make our data
available to the research community. To protect
users’ privacy we will only distribute IDs of the
tweets in our dataset.

COVID-19 Twitter Event Corpus

2.1

To extract structured knowledge from tweets about
COVID-19, we formulate the problem as a slot
filling task: given a tweet, first identify whether it
corresponds to a relevant event, then find relevant
text spans corresponding to a pre-defined list of
slots associated with the event type (Benson et al.,
2011). As an example, consider the tweet that
reports a CAN - NOT- TEST event in Figure 1. In
this case, the model should fill the L OCATION slot
with “Houston” and also identify that the author
of the tweet is currently experiencing COVID-19
symptoms. Table 1 shows the overall statistics of
our corpus.
Data Collection. We consider five event types related to COVID-19: TESTED - POSITIVE, TESTED NEGATIVE, CAN - NOT- TEST, DEATH, CURE & PRE VENTION .2 The first four events aim to extract
structured reports of coronavirus related events,
many of which are self-reported cases or come
from news stories about public figures who have
been exposed to the virus. As there is no widely
accepted antiviral treatment or vaccine for COVID19 as of 2020/06/01, we also dedicate one event
type for CURE & PREVENTION to study how some
potentially misleading information are perceived
by public.

Table 1: Statistics of COVID-19 Twitter Event Corpus.

We have been continuously collecting our data
since 2020/1/15 by tracking keywords using the
Twitter API.3 For example, “tested positive” is
used as one of the keywords for TESTED - POSITIVE
events. We have annotated 7,500 tweets sampled
from 2020/01/15 and 2020/04/26. For duplicate
tweets, we only keep the earliest post. We also use
Jaccard similarity with a threshold of 0.7 to remove
near-identical tweets that are posted same-day.
2
We are actively expanding the list to include more event
types, such as WAITING - FOR - THE - TEST- RESULTS, HOSPI TALIZATION , ICU , RECOVERY , and REOPENING .
3
We list all keywords for data collection in Appendix A.

Annotation Process

We use crowd workers on Amazon Mechanical
Turk to annotate our dataset. We provide annotation interface in Appendix B. Each tweet is annotated by 7 workers in two steps:
1. Specific Events. Some tweets are generic news
reports, however, we are more interested in capturing tweets with fine-grained information, especially the self-reporting cases. Therefore, we
first ask the annotators to decide whether a tweet
is regarding an individual or a group of people.4
Annotators proceed to the next step only if they
answer yes to this question.
2. Slot Filling. In this second step, we ask questions to collect factual information and user’s
opinions for filling our designated slots (Table
2). We provide the annotators with a list of candidate answers, which include all noun chunks
and name entities extracted by a Twitter tagging
tool (Ritter et al., 2011). We also combine noun
chunks if they are adjacent or separated by a
preposition phrase.5 We include “author of the
tweet” as an additional option for who questions
and “near author of tweet” for where questions.
For each tweet, annotators have an average of
10 to 11 possible answers to choose from, and
are allowed to choose more than one answers
for WH-questions. We also collect Wikipedia
links for public figures involved in the events.
Inter-annotator Agreement. During annotation,
we track crowd workers’ performances by comparing their annotations with the majority votes and
remove workers whose F1 scores fall below 0.65.
In addition, we independently annotated 100 tweets
(20 tweets for each event) and compared them with
the majority votes of crowdsourcing workers. We
observe an average of 0.76 Cohen’s Kappa (Artstein and Poesio, 2008) for specific-event questions
and an average F1 score of 0.74 for slot-filling.

3

Automatic Event Extraction

We develop models to automatically extract structured information as slot-filling tasks for COVID19 related events (Table 2). We set up each slot
filling task T as a binary classification problem:
4
For CURE & PREVENTION, we ask annotators if the tweet
describes a cure or prevention for COVID-19.
5
We notice in some cases our provided chunks are not perfect and may include some extra words. We provide explicit
guidelines for annotators stating that an option should only be
chosen when it contains no more than two extra words.

Table 2: Slot filling questions used for annotation.

given the tweet t and the candidate slot s, the classification model f (t, s) → {0, 1} predicts whether
s answers its designated question. To keep the
evaluation consistent for all Ts, we convert the nonbinary slot “gender” (with labels M, F, NA) into two
independent binary classification tasks.
3.1

Models and Baseline

LR model. We use a logistic regression classifier
as a baseline, using n-gram (n = 1, 2, 3) features.
We replace the slot s in the tweet t with a special
token <TARGET> before computing the n-grams.
BERT model. We fine-tune a BERT (Devlin et al.,
2019) based classifier that takes a tweet t as input
and encloses the candidate slot s, within the tweet,
inside special entity start <E> and end </E> markers. The BERT hidden representation of token <E>
is then processed through a fully connected layer
with softmax activation to make the binary prediction for a task T (Baldini Soares et al., 2019). By
design, many slots within an event are semantically
related to each other. For example, “gender” slot
is directly related to the “who” slot. To leverage
this, we jointly train the final softmax layers of all
the Ts in an event by sharing their BERT model
parameters. We use BERTbase cased model and
HuggingFace PyTorch implementation (Wolf et al.,
2019). All the shared BERT models are fine-tuned

with 2 × 10−5 learning rate using Adam (Kingma
and Ba, 2015) algorithm for 8 epochs. This model
has ≈ 110M parameters.
3.2

Evaluation

For all the slots and events, the gold labels are assigned based on the annotators’ majority votes. We
use a 60/15/25 ratio for train/dev/test. The best
threshold for each T is found by grid search on dev
data.6 We report the model performance by precision (P), recall (R) and F1 score in Table 3.7 The
BERT-based classifier significantly outperforms logistic regression on all the slot filling tasks. By
exploiting the shared BERT representations across
the slots of the same event, the BERT model is able
to get reasonably good F1 scores, even on slots that
have a limited amount of labeled training data.

Additional Analysis

Our annotations can be potentially used for other
analytical purposes besides event slot filling.
Tracking Self-reporting Cases. One feature of
our dataset is that it enables tracking of selfreporting cases. We consider tweets with “who”
6

Candidate thresholds for grid-search ∈ {0.1, 0.2, ..., 0.9}
We excluded several slots that have too few annotations,
such as “duration” for T ESTED NEGATIVE events and “when”
for C AN NOT TEST, from the evaluation.

Demographics of Users. Based on the public profiles of the 348 unique users who posted these 350
self-reporting tweets, we observe the following interesting trends: (1) The gender of self-reported
users is roughly evenly split (female 55.7% versus
male 44.3% for 271 users with gender information).
(2) The top two categories for race are white (171
users) and black (34 users), excluding 92 users that
we are not able to identify race. (3) Among 153
users whose political inclinations can be identified,
143 are democrats. (4) 55.6% of the 223 users who
are reporting their ages are from age group 25-50.
(5) 69.0% of the 348 users who self-reported information related to COVID-19 also disclose their geolocation information on Twitter. 74.2% of these
users are located in the United States and 10.8% in
European countries.
Bots and Organization Accounts. Within 7,326
unique users in our corpus, 2.4% are potentially
bots, as identified by the Botometer API (Varol
et al., 2017). We also note 4.1% of tweets about
CURE & PREVENTION are potentially posted by
bots.8 18.5% of user accounts belong to organizations, according to the Humanizr (McCorriston
et al., 2015).
Perceived Cures and Treatments. There are 219
different descriptions of cure or prevention methods for COVID-19 in our corpus, including widely
discussed ones “toilet paper” and “alcohol”. The
top 5 cure or prevention methods that Twitter users
believe effective are “social distancing”, “vitamin c”, “hydroxychloroquine”, “chloroquine” and
“bathroom hygiene”.
