Abstract
We consider the control of the COVID-19 pandemic through a standard SIR compartmental model.
This control is induced by the aggregation of individuals’ decisions to limit their social interactions: when
the epidemic is ongoing, an individual can diminish his/her contact rate in order to avoid getting infected,
but this effort comes at a social cost. If each individual lowers his/her contact rate, the epidemic vanishes
faster, but the effort cost may be high. A Mean Field Nash equilibrium at the population level is formed,
resulting in a lower effective transmission rate of the virus. We prove theoretically that equilibrium exists
and compute it numerically. However, this equilibrium selects a sub-optimal solution in comparison to the
societal optimum (a centralized decision respected fully by all individuals), meaning that the cost of anarchy
is strictly positive. We provide numerical examples and a sensitivity analysis, as well as an extension to a
SEIR compartmental model to account for the relatively long latent phase of the COVID-19 disease. In all
the scenarii considered, the divergence between the individual and societal strategies happens both before
the peak of the epidemic, due to individuals’ fears, and after, when a significant propagation is still underway.

Introduction
As of April 10th 2020, almost half of world population is under strong restrictions (lockdown) enforced by
local governments to limit the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 mediated COVID-19 pandemic. These restrictions mainly
concern the reduction of social interactions. They are instantiated at different geographical scales (householdings, towns, states, countries...) and already had a significant worldwide economic impact. All individuals
affected by epidemic control measures pay a cost in terms of health (reports show an under-reporting of severe
illnesses such as hearth, ischemic strokes, ...), time, money, social interactions, psychological pressure (domestic
violence increased), etc. However, until a sufficient proportion of the population becomes immune (by infection
or vaccination), the choice of control measures together with an adequate tracking of the virus spread are key
to limit the epidemic as well as the social and economic impacts of the contact rate decay. In such context, each
individual needs to balance the individual and collective outcomes of his/her behavior, when choosing his/her
level of social interaction with the population. For instance, he/she may be tempted to use the so-called ”free
lunch” strategy, i.e., take advantage of the low epidemic activity (due to others’ efforts) while not contributing to
the effort himself/herself. However, population benefits are at stake because the epidemic dynamics is induced
by the aggregation of individual decisions. In practice, an equilibrium is formed between the individuals and
we analyze in this work this equilibrium.
From the technical point of view, we study a ”Mean Field Game”. Introduced by Lasry and Lions in
[38, 39, 40] and independently by Huang, Caines, and Malhamé [33, 30, 31, 32], Mean Field Games focus on the

derivation of a Nash equilibrium within a population containing an infinite number of individuals, see [16] for
a complete mathematical description. Such asymptotic viewpoint simplifies the game theoretic analysis of the
interactions among the population, as typically the impact of each individual over the entire population can be
neglected. It is worth pointing out that the optimal strategy in a Mean Field game provides approximate Nash
equilibrium for similar games involving a finite number of players (see [16]). Fields of applications of Mean
Field games, mentioned in [28], include energy [24], finance [17, 25], crowd modeling [3], and also epidemic
dynamics [10, 36, 37, 34, 50]. These latter works focus on the impact of individual vaccination decisions on
the dynamics of the epidemic. In this paper, we follow a similar approach but study the impact of individual
decisions concerning distancing and isolation, in an epidemic dynamics where no vaccination is (yet) available.
Optimal control of epidemic is often modeled through a combination of isolation and vaccination strategies.
Early work of [1, 2] focuses on the optimal vaccination timing of individuals, while combined with cost free instantaneous isolation strategy. More realistic impacts and constraints on the quarantine and isolation strategies
have been considered in [43, 58] or [11, 29]. The main objective of such policy is to control the reproduction
number of the epidemic (see [45]) together with limiting the social and economic impact of such policy. An
other part of the literature (see [26, 49, 48, 23, 22, 13, 57] for example) tries to model and to take into account
the individual behavioral response to isolation policy in such context. Such modeling of individual response
is of course greatly influenced by cultural habits together with societal, economic or religious need for social
interactions. The addition of such individual based feedback effect on quarantine governmental policy is key in
the modeling of optimal control for epidemic dynamics. The main outcome of this paper is to provide an easily
tractable modeling approach for such a purpose.
We address in this work the question of epidemic control using an individual based modeling approach,
and ask the question of how does the cost of a social distancing strategy disseminate among individuals. Each
individual chooses optimally his/her contact rate with others, striking a balance between the cost of being
infected by the virus, and the cost induced by reducing social interactions. On one hand, the epidemic dynamics
is induced by the aggregation of all individual contact rate decisions. On the other hand, the epidemic level
influences the contamination probability of each individual and hereby their own contact rate. We prove that a
Mean Field Nash equilibrium is reached among the population and we quantify the impact of individual choice
between epidemic risk and other unfavorable outcomes. Numerical experiments show that the self isolation
equilibrium strategy is characterized by a quick contact rate reduction followed by a slower return to the usual
social interaction level. It allows to reduce significantly the proportion of infected individuals required in order
to achieve herd immunity.
We also compare the induced epidemic dynamics to a situation where a global planner (typically a strongly
empowered government) is able to control all the interaction rates among individuals. We observe numerically
that the Mean Field Nash equilibrium provides a sub-optimal contact rate strategy in comparison to the societal
optimum, and measure the corresponding so-called cost of anarchy. We observe in particular that the divergence
between the individual and societal strategies happens after the epidemic peak but while significant propagation
is still underway. By taking into account the individual responses to different cost structures, our modeling
approach can provide insights on the impact of political decisions concerning the costs induced by contact rate
reduction.
The paper is organized as follows. We first present in Section 1 the SIR model used to describe the COVID19 2020 epidemic dynamics, together with the control problem faced by each individual. We prove in section
2 the existence of a Mean Field Nash equilibrium in our setting and present a numerical algorithm for its
approximation. Section 3 focuses on the numerical experiments and presents the computing strategy, and the
results in terms of cost of anarchy and sensitivity of the optimal contact rate strategy to the main key modeling
parameters. It provides in particular a comparison with a global planner setting. In order to take into account
for the relatively long latent phase of the COVID-19 disease, we extend our study in Section 4 to an SEIR
epidemic model, and present some numerical results. Section 5 provides the technical parts of the mathematical
analysis associated to our study. Finally, Section 6 summarizes the main outputs of the paper and discusses
their limits and potential extensions.

Individual based modeling of the epidemic dynamics

1.1

The model

The dynamics of the epidemic is modeled by the standard SIR (Susceptible - Infected - Recovered) compartment
model represented in Figure 1. We refer to [7, 14, 15] for additional details on this model, as well as the
description of many other mathematical epidemic propagation models (and to [44, 55, 19, 56] for specific
coronavirus models). During the epidemic propagation, each individual can be either ”Susceptible”, ”Infected”
or ”Recovered”, and (St , It , Rt ) denotes the proportion of each category at time t ≥ 0. The group of ”Recovered”
represents the collection of individuals whose behavior does not impact the transmission of the virus anymore.
This includes the individuals who potentially did not survive the epidemic, as well as the individuals tested
positive and isolated in a perfect quarantine. Besides, we hereby implicitly assume that the immunity acquired
by the ”Recovered” lasts for ever. As a first step, we choose to restrict our analysis to a simple SIR model rather
than considering more complex (and realistic) models, in order to focus our analysis on the role of individual
decisions aggregation on the epidemic dynamics. Nevertheless, our study can be extend to more complicated
epidemic models. In particular, an extension to the SEIR compartment model is presented in Section 4.

More precisely, the (continuous-time) evolution of the disease is described by the following equations:


dRt = γIt dt,

(1)

with a given initial compartmental distribution of individuals at time 0 denoted (S0 , I0 , R0 ), which is supposed
to be known. We assume that initially S0 +I0 +R0 = 1, and observe that the system (1) possesses a conservation
law, i.e., for all t ≥ 0, St + It + Rt = 1.1 As the dynamics of the epidemic is not impacted by the size of the
class R, we can restrict our focus on the evolution of the proportion (S, I) of both susceptible and infected.
The model described by (1) involves two parameters, γ and β̄. The constant parameter γ > 0 is exogenous
and identifies the recovery rate, i.e., it represents the inverse of the lenght (in days) of the contagious period
(or time before strict isolation). In our framework, the key parameter is the transmission rate of the disease,
denoted (β̄t )t≥0 , which is considered to be endogenous and time-dependent, contrary to more classical SIR
models. To focus our study on this transmission rate, we assume that the parameter γ is fixed and known.
The transmission rate β̄ depends essentially on two factors: the disease characteristics and the contact rate
within the population. We will denote by β0 the constant initial transmission rate of the disease, i.e., without any
control measures or effort from the population. Although the society cannot modify the disease characteristics, it
can produce (possibly strong) incentives to each individual to reduce his/her contact rate with other individuals
in the population. This mitigation strategy (lockdown) has been chosen by many countries during the Covid19 epidemic propagation, some countries starting strict measures in January (China) while other countries in
February, March and so on; this is implemented in order to slow down the epidemic propagation. However, for
each individual, reducing the contact rate with others comes at a cost, as described in the introduction (health
hazards, psychological pressures, loss of social relationships, income uncertainty...) and it may even expose the
1 The SIR model can be extended to include births and deaths. Nevertheless, given that the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic
is assumed to, hopefully, be relatively short with respect to the life expectancy at birth in most of the concerned countries, the
demographic dynamics is not relevant and will not be taken into account.

individual to yet unknown risks. The latter is especially true for long epidemics that require substantial efforts
from the individuals. On the other hand, if everybody else lowers his/her own contact rate then the epidemic
diffusion will be vanishing and a given individual, having this knowledge, can act as a free-rider and effectively
increase his/her contact rate without too much risk.
Finally, the global epidemics propagation rate β̄ of the society follows from the aggregation of all individuals
contact rates, so that an equilibrium is reached between all contact rates β chosen by each individual and the
overall epidemic transmission rate β̄ in the society.

1.2

Individual viewpoint: contact rate optimization

We focus in this section on the individual perspective on the epidemic control. Consistent with the literature,
we suppose that the population can be partitioned into several collections of identical individuals (here the
”Susceptible”, ”Infected and infectious” and ”Removed” classes), so that each individual in a given collection
takes the same decisions as other individuals in the same class. This implies that we can consider a ”representative” individual, which is an arbitrary individual in a given class. As we are interested in the unfold of the
COVID-19 pandemic (as opposed to an endemic disease such as measles, mumps, rubella, pertussis, ...) we will
consider a finite time horizon T > 0, large enough so that the epidemic is over at time T .2
The probability of infection of the representative individual depends on both his/her own contact rate β
with the population, together with the proportion It of infectious individuals in the population. More precisely,
let τ denote the random infection time of the representative individual. His/Her probability Ptβ = P(τ ≤ t) of
being infected before time t, when using contact rate β, has the following dynamics (see [36, 37]):

dPtβ = βt It 1 − Ptβ dt, for t ∈ [0, T ],

(2)

where It is the proportion of (contagious) infected at time t, whose dynamics is driven by the population contact
rate β̄ (as described in (1)).
We assume that, while in the Susceptible class, i.e., before the (possible) infection time τ , the representative
individual can choose his/her contact rate βt ∈ [βmin , β0 ] (for all t ≤ τ ). Recall that β0 represents the
transmission rate of the disease without any control measures, while βmin > 0 is the lowest possible contact
rate value that can be attained by the representative individual. The efforts of an individual for decreasing
social interactions, in order to lower the transmission rate of the virus from β0 to some β ∈ [βmin , β0 ], induce
an instantaneous cost, represented by a decreasing function c : [βmin , β0 ] → R+3 .
Following [36], we assume that the global cost (seen from time t = 0) of an individual, while infected at time
τ and choosing a dynamic contact rate (βt )t , is defined by:
Z

τ ∧T


c βs ds + rI 1τ ≤T ,

C(β, τ ) :=

(3)

0

where τ ∧ T denotes for the minimum between τ and T .
More precisely, when reducing his/her social interactions on the time interval [0, T ], the representative
individual faces a global cost given by the sum of:
(i) a cost for reducing social interactions until being infected, represented by:
Z

τ ∧T

c βt dt,

2 Considering a finite horizon time also allows some technical simplifications of the mathematical analysis, mainly for the proof
of the existence of a Nash equilibrium, without sacrificing qualitative conclusions. Nevertheless, the results can be extended to an
infinite horizon, with relevant technical adaptations. Moreover, since the numerical simulations can only tackle finite times, this
choice has the advantage to use an unified framework for both contributions.
3 See Assumption 2.1 for the rigorous statement of the hypothesis made on the cost function c(·).

meaning that, if the individual is not infected during the period [0, T ], his/her efforts are costly until T .
On the contrary, if the individual is infected before T , his/her effort are only costly before τ .
(ii) a cost incurred at the infection time τ , defined by rI 1τ ≤T , where rI denotes the unitary cost of infection
as quantified by the representative individual, together with any other costs that the presence in the
”Infected” class implies. Note that rI is taken here as a constant which does not depend on the pandemic
evolution neither on the individual control measures that are specific to the ”Infected” class.
We do not specify here the nature of these previous costs, both have health components but may also include
other types of costs. We refer the reader to the literature on the QALY/DALY scales for further details [59, 5, 51].
Hence, the expected cost of the representative individual, seen from time t = 0, when using individual
contact rate β while the population contact rate is β̄, is given by the following:

 Z τ ∧T


c(βs )ds + rI 1τ ≤T ,
(5)
C(β, β̄) := E C(β, τ ) = E
0

where the distribution of τ is given by (2) and thus indirectly driven by β̄.
In order to determine his/her optimal contact rate β ∗ while the population rate driving (It )t is β̄, the
representative individual faces the following minimization problem:
min C(β, β̄),
β∈B

(6)

where the set B of admissible contact rate strategies is defined by:
B := {β : [0, T ] → [βmin , β0 ], β measurable}.

Societal viewpoint: induced epidemic dynamics

In the previous subsection, we described the situation from the point of view of a representative individual.
We assumed that each individual chooses his/her own contact rate β in order to minimize the associated cost
C(β, β̄), while β̄ represents the population’s contact rate. In our (Mean Field games) framework, one individual
taken alone has no influence on the pandemic dynamics when choosing his/her contact rate. However, the
global epidemic propagation rate β̄ of the society is induced by the aggregation of all individuals contact rates.
Besides, the behavior of the representative individual described in the previous section, is the one used by all
individuals assumed to be identical.
Hence, following the prescriptions of the Mean Field games framework, an equilibrium is sought between the
contact rate β chosen by each individual and the overall epidemic transmission rate β̄ observed at the society
level. More precisely, we look for an equilibrium among all individuals in the population, in the sense of the
following definition.
Definition 1.1 (Mean Field Nash equilibrium). The contact rate β ? ∈ B together with the epidemic dynamics
(S ? , I ? , R? ) is a Mean Field Nash equilibrium if the following relations are satisfied:
(i) Individual rationality: it is optimal for the representative individual to choose the contact rate β = β ?
when the epidemic dynamics is (S ? , I ? , R? );
(ii) Population consistency: whenever the population contact rate is β̄ = β ? , the induced epidemic dynamics is given by (S ? , I ? , R? ).
Identifying such an equilibrium boils down to a fixed point property of the optimal best response function
of the representative individual as described in the following Section.

2.1

Mean Field Nash equilibrium and Numerical approximation
Mean Field Nash equilibrium

As emphasized in the previous section, the contact rate chosen by each individual is impacted by the epidemic
dynamics through the proportion of infected (It )t , while the number of infected is a direct consequence of the
aggregation of all individuals’ behavior. We thus look for an equilibrium in such context, i.e., in the sense of
Definition 1.1. In fact, finding a Mean-Field Nash equilibrium is equivalent to identifying a fixed point of the
so-called best response function, which provides an optimal individual contact rate β ∗ ∈ B (or a set of optimal
strategies if non-uniqueness of the optimal strategy) in response to a population contact rate β̄.
We therefore introduce the best response function T , which associates to any societal transmission rate
β̄ ∈ B, the optimal individual contact rate β ? :
n
o
T : β̄ ∈ B −→ β ? ∈ arg min C(β, β̄) .
(8)
β∈B

As mentioned earlier, although we expect to find at least one fixed point to this application, in general T is a
multi-valued mapping. We make the following assumption:
Assumption 2.1. The cost function c is decreasing, two times differentiable with continuous second derivative
(i.e., of C 2 class) and the following holds:
inf

β∈[βmin ,β0 ]

c00 (β) > 0.

(9)

Most of the results that follow also hold under much less demanding assumptions, but at the price of
increasing technicalities. We first state the theoretical result concerning the existence of a unique best response
strategy in T (β̄) for a given β̄ ∈ B.
Lemma 2.1. Suppose β̄ ∈ B is fixed. Under Assumption 2.1, there exists a unique β ?,β̄ ∈ B satisfying
C(β ?,β̄ , β̄) ≤ C(β, β̄), for all β ∈ B.

(10)

We are now in position to state the main mathematical result of the paper, concerning the existence of a
Mean Field Nash equilibrium.
Theorem 2.2. Under Assumption 2.1, the model (1) admits a Mean Field Nash equilibrium β ? ∈ B together
?
?
?
with (S β , I β , Rβ ), in the sense of Definition 1.1, i.e., for any β ∈ B,
C(β ? , β ? ) ≤ C(β, β ? ).

(11)

Note that the result of Theorem 2.2 only informs on the existence of an equilibrium and not to its possible
uniqueness. The uniqueness of a Mean Field equilibrium has been recognized as a difficult problem from the
very beginning of the MFG theory (see counter-examples in [38, remark after Theorem 2.2]) and very little
theoretical guidance exists to support such a claim. Among the methods that can allow to obtain uniqueness
one can list the monotony assumptions (see [40, 38, 39]) or the evolution dynamics (see [54]) but none seems to
apply directly here. Moreover, with few exceptions, the epidemic Mean Field equilibrium has rarely been proved
to possess systematic uniqueness properties. For sake of clarity, the proofs of both Lemma 2.1 and Theorem
2.2 are postponed to Section 5.4.

2.2

Numerical approach

We describe below the methodology used in the numerical experiments in order to approximate the Mean Field
Nash equilibrium β ? . Recall that the cost for the representative individual when choosing a contact rate β while
the societal transmission rate is β̄, is given by C(β, β̄).
6

The metric equilibrium flow approach introduced in [54] (to which we refer the reader for rigorous mathematical transcription of the objects below, see also [50] for an application) prescribes the following iterative
procedure in order to reach an equilibrium: choose a pseudo-time step h > 0 and define iteratively β n+1 as a
minimizer of the following functional
β 7→

d(β, β n )2
+ C(β, β n ).
h

(12)

Here, d(·, ·) is a geodesic distance on the space B of all possible individual choices β. Note that when B is a
Hilbert space, C(·, ·) is smooth enough, and d(·, ·) is the distance induced by the canonical norm, the fact that
β n+1 is a minimizer of the functional in (12) implies:
β n+1 = β n − h∇1 C(β n+1 , β n ),

(13)

where ∇1 denotes for the derivative with respect to the first argument.
Relation (13) is similar to the JKO scheme used in one variable gradient flows, see [4]. The problem with
(13) is that it is implicit and thus not compatible, in this form, with numerical computation. In practice, when
the vectorial structure on B is compatible with the topological structure, one can propose an iterative procedure
to find β n+1 solution of (13): start with β n+1,0 = β n and iterate for ` ≥ 0
β n+1,`+1 = β n − h∇1 C(β n+1,` , β n ).

(14)

It is standard to see that for h small enough and in presence of (e.g. Lipschitz) regularity of ∇1 C with respect to
its first argument, the iterations are guaranteed to converge, by a Picard fixed point argument, to the (unique)
solution of (13). However, for numerical convenience, in practice only L iterations of (14) are performed, and
for our numerical simulations, L = 1 worked just fine. Therefore, we implement the following proxy for the
minimization in (12):
β n+1 = β n − h∇1 C(β n , β n ).

(15)

When B is a Hilbert space and forgetting any possible regularity issues, we obtain an Explicit Euler discretization
of the equilibrium flow defined in [54]. Thus, we can expect that limn→∞ β n will be the equilibrium we want to
compute.

3.1

Numerical experiments
Choice of parameters

The following numerical experiments are done using a contact rate reduction cost function defined by:
c(b) :=

β0
− 1, b ∈ [βmin , β0 ] .
b

(16)

Recall that the parameter βmin represents the minimal achievable contact rate by a representative individual,
while β0 denotes the usual contact rate used before the beginning of the lockdown measures. In other words, β0
represents the transmission rate of the disease without any isolation effort of the population. The shape of the
cost function encompasses the increasing difficulty to bring the contact rate closer to zero. Conversely, without
effort of the individual at time t, meaning that βt = β0 , the associated cost c(βt ) is equal to zero. In addition,
note that this function c satisfies Assumption 2.1.
The set of parameters used in the experiments are provided in Table 1. The associated reproduction number
R0 without isolation measure, commonly defined by R0 := β0 /γ in the literature on epidemic models, is equal to
2.0 in our framework, and is thus in the confidence interval of available data [42]. The parameter γ corresponds
7

to the inverse of the virus contagious period see [6]. We assume that the initial proportion of infected I0 in the
overall population is 1% at time 0, when the contact rate optimization starts. We set the cost rI incurred by
an infected individual to rI = 300. We recall that this cost is not necessarily expressed in terms of money, but
can also be medical side effects or general morbidity (see [59, 5, 51] for an introduction on QALY/DALY) and
is relative to the definition of c(·).

equilibrium contact rate β ? (magenta line), identical to the contact rate at the penultimate step of the algorithm

We plot in Figure 2 the convergence towards the minimal cost; the decay of the cost is very fast in terms
of the learning time h. The contact rate at equilibrium is represented in the right plot, while the empirical
convergence of the algorithm is confirmed by its superposition with the approximate contact rate computed at
the previous step. At this numerical Mean Field Nash equilibrium, the cost function C(β ? , β ? ) is 211.33 and
provides for each individual a relative gain of 12% in comparison to the zero effort strategy β0 . In addition,
only 85% of this cost is explained in terms of the wealth impact (instead of 100% for the strategy β0 ), with
the remaining 15% being related to the cost of social effort; the probability of being infected over the interval
[0, T ] decreases from 80% in the 0-effort benchmark scenario, to 62%, see Figure 3. Note that in this case, the
minimum attainable infection probability is 50% (as calculated from [35, Lemma A.1] or from equation (1)).
The equilibrium contact rate β ? is characterized by three major phases, in response to the Mean Field Nash
equilibrium epidemic dynamics presented in Figure 3. First, at the beginning of the epidemic, the number I of
4 We tested other initial guesses and all the convergence rate was the same. Moreover, in all cases, the same equilibrium is
obtained.

Infected, implying a significant increase of the individual’s probability of contracting the virus. In response
to this, individuals begin to reduce significantly their social interactions, implying a strong reduction of the
transmission rate of the disease. Finally, after the epidemic peak, all individuals slowly reduce their effort until
the number of infected people is relatively close to 0.

in Table 1. Solid lines represent the evolution at the Mean Field Nash equilibrium, i.e., with transmission rate
β ? . The evolution at equilibrium is compared to the epidemic dynamics with constant transmission rate β0
(dashed lines).
Figure 3 provides a comparison between the SIR dynamics of the Mean Field Nash equilibrium (solid lines),
and the one generated by the no-effort strategy β0 (dashed lines). Even if driven by self-interest, individual
efforts do reduce social interactions population-wise. This can be explained as follows. First, we observe that
the proportion RT of recovered at terminal date drops from 80% to 60% when the population is applying the
Mean Field Nash equilibrium strategy. This means that the proportion of the population spared by the virus
goes from 20% in the case without effort to 40% at equilibrium. Second, one can observe that the infection
peak occurring around t = 50 days is twice less critical at equilibrium, but, as a counterpart, the epidemic lasts
longer as the number of infected decreases more slowly after the epidemic peak. As the infection peak is less
critical, it limits, and may even prevent, the saturation of the healthcare facilities. Although not represented in
our model, this necessarily implies a decrease in the mortality rate of the virus.

B̄, of particular piece-wise constant strategies:

Figure 4: Comparison between Mean Field Nash equilibria in B (plain lines) and B̄ (dashed line), using the
parameters described in Table 1.
Figure 4 compared the Mean Field Nash equilibria obtained over both sets B̄ and B. The equilibrium strategy
over B̄ starts isolation measures at time t1 = 20 by decreasing the contact rate from β0 = 0.20 to β = 0.14. The
duration of the lockdown is 81 days, after which the contact rate is immediately returning to normal, i.e., β0 .
The cost induced for each individual is around 210.78, which is lower than the one around 211.33 associated to
the equilibrium over B. Moreover, we observe that the induced SIR dynamics provides a lower epidemic size
RT together with a lower proportion of infected at the epidemic peak, hereby reducing the potential mortality
rate induced by the virus. This observation enlightens as well how the Mean Field Nash equilibrium β ? in B is
not optimal for the society as a whole, as it can be improved by restricting the set of admissible strategies to
B̄. This observation leads us to look towards the optimal societal contact rate for the population as a whole.

3.4

Cost of anarchy

In our previous equilibrium analysis, each individual is considered to be too small in order to impact the
epidemic dynamics of the society and can hence acts in a selfish manner: each individual minimizes his own
cost C(·, β̄) in response to the transmission rate β̄ of the epidemic. On the other hand, a global planner, e.g., a
government with full empowerment, will optimize the global cost of the entire society with respect to the choice
of the transmission rate in the society. Namely, the global planner will solve:
min C(β̄, β̄),

(18)

β̄∈B

This leads to a different optimization problem, which is well documented in the literature, see for example
[52, 11, 29, 20], and even more largely on the topic of vaccination (see, e.g., [2, 43, 46, 35]).

Figure 5: Comparison between two strategies: the Mean Field Nash equilibrium contact rate β ? ∈ B (solid
lines) and the optimal transmission rate for the society (dashed line), using the parameters described in Table
1.
In our framework, we can compute, through classical optimization procedures (e.g., the Pontryagin principle),
the optimal control of the transmission rate from the society point of view. We refer to the literature previously
cited for the details on the techniques allowing to find this optimal control and we only present here the numerical
results. Note that in such context there are several additional, classical, procedures available to compute the
optimal control (see for instance the forward-backward sweep method in [41, Chapter 4]). Nevertheless, in
our framework, a slight modification of the previously implemented gradient descent detailed in Subsection 2.2
works just fine.
11

First, observe that the societal optimal transmission rate imposes larger effort at the beginning of the
control period, and relieves these constraints much more slowly. The total control duration period for the
societal optimum is 151 days in comparison to 96 days for the Mean Field Nash equilibrium, although societal
control begins later than in the case of the Nash. Secondly, observe that the optimal transmission rate chosen by
the global planner accentuates the already encouraging results obtained with the Mean Field Nash equilibrium
on the epidemic dynamics: the epidemic size RT represents only 55% of the total population.
The societal optimum allows to reach an individual cost around 200.25, while the Mean Field Nash equilibrium provides a cost valued around 211.33. This phenomenon allows to mathematically quantify the so-called
”cost of anarchy”, induced when letting each individual decide on his/her own, instead of letting a global planner
take decisions for the population as a whole. Of course, the societal optimal strategy is not a Mean Field Nash
equilibrium: given this optimal transition rate for the society, each individual is tempted to make less effort in
reducing his/her own contact rate which will drive away the global rate towards the Mean Field equilibrium.

Figure 6: Comparison between two strategies: the societal optimum contact rate in B (solid lines) and the
societal optimum contact rate in B̄, using the parameters described in Table 1.
We also compare in Figure 6 the societal optimal transmission rate in B to the optimal one in B̄, where only
one strong effort period is allowed. The societal-wide optimum control period in B̄ starts at time t = 23 and
lasts 111 days. This induced cost is around 2% higher than the one induced by the optimal social diffusion rate.
This may allow to quantify the importance of going through a progressive lock-out strategy.
Finally, Figure 7 provides a closer look on the four aforementioned strategies, focusing on the time interval
[10, 150], in order to highlight the control (lockdown) and control-less (lockout) properties. One can observe
that for both Mean Field Nash equilibrium strategies, the control period starts and ends earlier in comparison to

12

the societal optimum situation. Indeed, on one hand, individuals engage in preventive measures by decreasing
their interactions earlier than a global planner would recommend, due to fear of the infection spreading. On
the other hand, they release their efforts just after the peak of infection, whereas a global planner would
recommend maintaining a relatively high level of effort in order to avoid further spreading of the virus. Therefore,
while the Nash equilibrium of individuals allows, through premature efforts, to decrease the peak of infection,
the socially optimal strategy allows a more rapid decrease in the proportion of infected after the peak, by
maintaining intense efforts. Nevertheless, we shall remind that the global planner should also take into account
the possible saturation of the healthcare system, leading to a lower epidemic peak induced by the optimal
societal transmission rate.

Sensitivity to parameters

The parameters used in the previous numerical experiments are provided in Table 1 above. Nevertheless, as
the current medical literature still shows considerable uncertainty concerning the numerical values for those
parameters, we tested the sensitivity of our findings with respect to the choice of the main parameters of the
model. The corresponding figures are provided in Appendix A for better readability.
(i) Figure 9 provides the Nash equilibrium and the epidemic dynamics for three different values for rI ,
13

describing the relative effects of the two parts of the costs. As expected, the more costly is the infection
for an individual, the more efforts he/she will do in order to limit his social interactions, in order to
decrease his/her probability of infection. In particular, reducing the sanitary cost rI from 350 to 250
implies a 20% decrease on the level of the epidemic peak.
(ii) Figure 11 provides a similar study for three different values of the reproducing number R0 . For higher
R0 , individuals make more effort in order to reduce their social interactions. Bringing R0 from 2.5 to 1.8
reduces the epidemic peak by 40% together with reducing the size RT of the epidemic from 70% to around
60%. This result is perfectly understandable since the higher R0 is, the higher the probability of being
infected without effort is. Each individual limits his social interaction in order to decrease the probability
of being infected, and thus diminishes the wealth impact of the epidemic.
(iii) Finally, Figure 10 studies the sensibility of our findings with respect to the initial proportion I0 of infected
at time 0. A higher I0 induces an earlier beginning of the control period, together with a stronger efficacy
of it. At terminal date, the total proportion of susceptible remains similar. This implies that the long
term effects of a late detection of the epidemic can be compensated by a stronger isolation equilibrium
policy. Once again, we omit here the possible negative outcomes induced by the saturation of the health
care system.

The SEIR model and application to COVID-19

It should be noted that the COVID-19 disease is characterized by a relatively long latency phase (as well as many
other complex dynamics). To account for this latent phase, where infected individuals are not yet contagious,
we can extend our reasoning to an SEIR model, where the class E represents the individuals infected but not
yet infectious. The dynamics of the SEIR model are described by the following system:


where β̄ still represents the societal transmission rate, and α > 0 is a parameter specific to the SEIR model,
representing the rate at which an exposed person becomes infectious. The average incubation period is therefore
given by 1/α.
The computations provided in Section 5 still hold for the SEIR model. Therefore, the application of the
numerical scheme described in Section 2.2 is straightforward, and only the numerical results are presented
here. The parameters used for the numerical simulations are those provided in [8, 21], and are described in the
following table. Other parameters given in Table 1 remain unchanged.

Table 2: Set of parameters for the SEIR model
The numerical results are provided in Figure 8 and have the same features as for the SIR model. More
precisely, the proportion of the population spared by the virus goes from less than 20% in the case without
effort to 40% at equilibrium. Moreover, the infection peak occurring around t = 50 days is three times less critical
at equilibrium. This result would limit, and may even prevent, the saturation of the healthcare facilities, and
thus implies a decrease in the mortality rate of the virus. However, as a counterpart, the epidemic lasts longer
14

as the proportion of exposed and infected individuals decreases more slowly after the epidemic peak. Finally,
and similarly as for the SIR model, the cost of anarchy exists. In particular, the societal optimal transmission
rate requires a greater and longer-lasting effort, even if it starts a little later. The optimal transmission rate at
the societal level thus improves the rate of recovery from 60% to 55%. However, since the effort begins later,
the infection peak is higher than for the Nash equilibrium.

Mathematical details

In this section, we detail the computations and proofs when the epidemic is modeled by a SIR. Nevertheless,
these computations still hold if we consider instead an SEIR model, as mentioned in Section 4. More precisely,
since the individual is considered infected as soon as he/she enters class E, the probability of being infected in
the considered time interval [0, T ] remains unchanged. In particular, the cost satisfies the same formula (27) as
for the SIR model, as well as the gradient formula (30).

5.1

Probability of infection

We introduce (Stβ̄ , Itβ̄ , Rtβ̄ ) in order to denote, at time t ≥ 0, the solution of the system (1) with contact rate
β̄. For all t ∈ [0, +∞), we denote by ϕβ̄t (β) the probability that infection occurs before time t for an individual
choosing his/her own contact rate β, while the epidemic evolves according the population’s transmission rate
β̄. Note that ϕβ̄ (β) is redundant with the notation P β but emphasizes the dependence in β̄ of the distribution
function of the random infection time τ .
Lemma 5.1. The probability of being infected before time t ≥ 0, for an individual choosing a contact rate β ∈ B,
and when the proportion of infected is I β̄ , is equal to:
ϕβ̄t (β) = 1 − e−

Rt
0

βs Isβ̄ ds

.

(20)

To compute this probability, we follow [36, 37]. The Markov chain of an individual, who chooses a contact
rate β ∈ B with infected individuals, and whose state at time t ∈ [0, T ] is denoted by Mt , is described in terms
of the following passage probabilities:

P Mt+∆t = S Mt = S = 1 − βt Itβ̄ ∆t + o(∆t),

P Mt+∆t = I Mt = S = βt Itβ̄ ∆t + o(∆t),

P Mt+∆t = I Mt = I = 1 − γItβ̄ ∆t + o(∆t),

P Mt+∆t = R Mt = I = γItβ̄ ∆t + o(∆t),

P Mt+∆t = R Mt = R = 1 + o(∆t).

(21)

The probability of being infected before time t + ∆t can be written as follows:

ϕβ̄t+∆t (β) = P ∃τ ∈ [0, t + ∆t], Mτ = I M0 = S

= P Mt+∆t ∈ {I ∪ R} M0 = S


= P Mt+∆t ∈ {I ∪ R} Mt = S × P Mt = S M0 = S


+ P Mt+∆t ∈ {I ∪ R} Mt ∈ {I ∪ R} × P Mt ∈ {I ∪ R} M0 = S .

(22)

Noting that


P Mt+∆t ∈ {I ∪ R} Mt = S = P Mt+∆t = I Mt = S = βt Itβ̄ ∆t + o(∆t),

P Mt+∆t ∈ {I ∪ R} Mt ∈ {I ∪ R} = 1 + o(∆t),

(23)

and replacing in (22), we obtain:

ϕβ̄t+∆t (β) = βt Itβ̄ ∆t × 1 − ϕβ̄t (β) + 1 × ϕβ̄t (β) + o(∆t).

(24)

Using the fact that ϕβ̄0 (β) = 0, and letting ∆t → 0, the previous equation naturally implies the formula (20).

Recall that given a finite time horizon T , the expected cost of an individual is defined by (5). In other words,
we have:

In order to obtain the gradient of this cost, we have to compute the Gateau derivative Dh C of C with respect

Proof of the existence of an equilibrium

First we recall that Equation (1) has a unique solution for any β̄ ∈ B (see for instance [12, 18, 53]). In particular
one can prove that if β̄n is a sequence of functions in B converging in L1 (thus also in L2 ) to some β̄∞ then the
corresponding solution (Stβ̄n , Itβ̄n , Rtβ̄n ) of (1) converges (for any given t) to (Stβ̄∞ , Itβ̄∞ , Rtβ̄∞ ). Moreover for any
β ∈ B the solution (Stβ̄ , Itβ̄ , Rtβ̄ ) is a Lipschitz function of time with Lipschitz constant LS ≤ β0 + γ.
We start with the proof of Lemma 2.1.
Proof. To this end, we consider that β̄ is fixed. Define the value function at time t (compare with formula (27)):

This corresponds to the optimal cost of an individual starting at time t in the susceptible class. By invoking
standard arguments (see [9]) one can show that Πt is the (unique) solution of the following Hamilton-JacobiBellman equation:

(33)

where

(34)

Under Assumption 2.1, the minimization in (34) is straightforward to analyze (and in general is related to the
Fenchel transform of c(·)). Moreover the value y ∗ realizing the minimum is unique and the following mapping,
n
o
(35)
x 7→ βopt (x, Itβ̄ ) = y ∗ = arg min c(y) + (rI − x) · y · Itβ̄ ,
y∈[βmin ,β0 ]

is Lipschitz in both arguments with a constant LH valid for all x ∈ [0, rI ] and Itβ̄ ∈ [0, 1]. Since Itβ̄ is Lipschitz (in
particular continuous) we obtain that βopt (Πt , Itβ̄ ) is continuous with respect to time and thus Πt is a classical
solution of (34). It is a Lipschitz function of time with Lipschitz constant LΠ ≤ c(β0 ) + rI β0 .
We now prove Theorem 2.2.
Proof. The proof consists of applying Schauder Theorem (see for example [60, Theorem 1.C] or [47, Theorem
18.20]) to the mapping T , in order to prove that it has a fixed point. To this end, we define a subset D ⊂ B
consisting of Lipschitz functions with constant LH (LΠ + β0 + γ). Obviously D is a compact set in L2 (0, T ).
Previous considerations show that for any β̄, the corresponding optimal individual choice βopt (Πt , Itβ̄ ) is in D.
Moreover D is a compact subset of L2 (0, T ). For any sequence β̄ n in B converging in L2 to some β̄ ∞ we have
n
∞
that on the one hand Itβ̄ → Itβ̄ for any t. Moreover the corresponding value functions Πnt (which depend
n
n
on β̄ n through Itβ̄ ) will also converge pointwise. This means that finally the optimal values βopt (Πnt , Itβ̄ ) will
∞
β̄
2
converge to the corresponding limits βopt (Π∞

n
∞
convergence of T (β̄ ) to T (β̄ ) which ends the proof, by application of the Schauder fixed point theorem.

Conclusion and closing remarks

In this work, we consider, within both a SIR and SEIR models, the question of the COVID-19 control measures
as seen from the point of view of the individuals. We assume that each individual can choose to decrease his/her
social interactions in order to slow down the spread of the virus. This means that the transmission rate, usually
constant and exogenous in standard SIR models, is endogenous and time-dependent. Individuals can choose
to lower their contact rate, which will allow them to minimize the likeliness of being infected, but this comes
at a cost. The impact on the overall epidemic unfold from a single individual is negligible but the aggregating
behavior of all individuals determine the epidemic evolution. This is formalized through a Mean Field approach.
We prove the existence of a Mean Field Nash equilibrium, i.e., a contact rate such that no individual has an
interest in choosing a contact rate different from the overall societal contact rate. We then perform numerical
simulations in order to find this equilibrium, which seems to be unique for the tested cases. The transmission
rate of the disease induced by the equilibrium allows a clear improvement in the evolution of the epidemic,
compared to the evolution with the initial transmission rate β0 , which corresponds to the transmission rate
of the disease without any effort of the population. In particular, despite the selfishness of individuals (who
only seek to minimize their own cost), their efforts make possible to reduce the number of people affected by
the disease by 25%. In addition, the infection peak is less critical, which limits, and may even prevent, the
saturation of the health care system and a corresponding decrease in the mortality rate of the virus.
However, the Nash equilibrium is not the best that can be achieved if compared with a situation where
individuals are 100% altruistic and only see the good of the society as a whole. To quantify this difference, we
compute the societal-wide optimum to compare the two strategies. We observe that the divergence between
the two strategies arrives both before and after the peak of the epidemic. More precisely, the Nash equilibrium
allows, through premature efforts, to decrease the peak of infected, but the centralized epidemic control implies a
more rapid decrease in the proportion infected after the peak, by maintaining intense efforts. As a consequence,
there is a cost of anarchy, meaning that the Nash equilibrium induces a higher cost than the societal optimum.
While stopping early, at a point where the epidemic decreases but is not yet over, may be intuitively explained
by the selfish nature of individuals, the fact that they decide collectively to begin efforts early than the societal
optimum is a more intriguing feature. The latter fact is consistent with the experimental results documented
in the remarkable work [27].
Of course, any model is but an imperfect description of the reality and there are some limitations of our
model too. First of all, as there is no consensus in the medical literature on the parameters of the epidemic, this
impacts our model too. Indeed, the recent literature on the COVID-19 epidemic is abundant but discordant on
the dynamics of the epidemic, in particular on the parameters γ and R0 := β0 /γ. Moreover, the appropriate
estimation of the cost of effort, denoted by the function c, and its counterpart rI are still object of research, as
they are not necessarily monetary or economic costs, but often costs related to health and social interactions.
The modeling of these costs needs to be related to the concept of QALY/DALY, see [59, 5, 51].
To account for the long latency phase of the disease induced by the COVID-19, we extend our reasoning
from a SIR model to a SEIR. This choice can also be discussed since the disease induced by the COVID-19 has
many other complex dynamics (for e.g. large number of asymptomatic carriers, see [44, 55, 19] for alternatives
already used in coronavirus epidemics). Our model could also be extended to take into account other ways to
control an epidemic, such as vaccination for example, even if no vaccine is known to date. Moreover we assume
that all individuals are rational, identical, and that they have a perfect knowledge of the epidemic dynamics.
The model could also be extended to a add some heterogeneity between individuals, since the epidemic does
not affect individuals in the same way, and is more costly for those at risk. All these remain for future work.
The study of the cost of anarchy raises the question of incentives: what levers can healthcare authorities
use to bring the Nash equilibrium closer to the societal optimal? Indeed, many countries have introduced fines,
or even prison sentences, in the event of failure to comply with lockdown. Our model can give details in this
direction, and invites a finer assessment of the costs related to the epidemic, but also to the lockdown. A model
with centralized control also opens up the question of modeling the interaction (or not) between countries with
different levels of epidemic dynamics.
