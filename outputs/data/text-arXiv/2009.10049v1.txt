Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in more than 30.35 million infections and 9, 50, 625 deaths in
212 countries over the last few months. Different drug intervention acting at multiple stages of pathogenesis of COVID-19 can substantially reduce the infection induced mortality. The current within-host
mathematical modeling studies deals with the optimal drug regimen and the efficacy of combined therapy in
treatment of COVID-19. The drugs/interventions considered include Arbidol, Remdesivir, Inteferon (INF)
and Lopinavir/Ritonavir. It is concluded that these drug interventions when administered individually or
in combination reduce the infected cells and viral load. Four scenarios involving administration of single
drug intervention, two drug interventions, three drug interventions and all the four have been discussed.
In all these scenarios the optimal drug regimen is proposed based on two methods. In the first method
these medical interventions are modeled as control interventions and a corresponding objective function and
optimal control problem is formulated. In this setting the optimal drug regimen is proposed. Later using
the the comparative effectiveness method the optimal drug regimen is proposed based on basic reproduction
number and viral load. The average infected cell count and viral load decreased the most when all the four
interventions were applied together. On the other hand the average susceptible cell count decreased the best
when Arbidol alone was administered. The basic reproduction number and viral count decreased the best
when all the four interventions were applied together reinstating the fact obtained earlier in the optimal
control setting. These findings may help physicians with decision making in treatment of life-threatening
COVID-19 pneumonia.

Introduction

The unprecedented pandemic affecting more than 212 countries by infection of Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing Covid-19. There are already 30.35 million infected individuals
and 9, 50, 625 deaths worldwide, and further daily exponential increase [20].
A detailed pathogenesis and a corresponding within-host model involving crucial inflammatory mediators
and the host immune response has been developed and discussed at length by the authors elsewhere [2]. This
work dealt with the natural history and course of infection of COVID-19. The authors also briefly discussed
about the optimality and effectiveness of combined therapy involving one or more antiviral and one or more
immuno-modulating drugs when administered together.

The present work deals with optimal drug regimen and the efficacy of combined therapy in treatment of
COVID-19. The drug interventions considered include Arbidol, Remdesivir, Interferon and Lopinavir/Ritonavir.
It is concluded that these drug when administered individually or in combination reduce the infected cells and
viral load significantly. Four scenarios involving administration of single drug, two drugs, three drugs and all
the four drugs have been discussed. In all these scenarios the optimal drug regimen is proposed based on two
methods. The first method in the optimal control problem setting and the second method being comparative
effectiveness studies. The average infected cell count and viral load decreased the most when all the four interventions were applied together. On the other hand, the average susceptible cell count decreased the best
when Arbidol alone was administered. The comparative effectiveness studies showed that the basic reproduction
number and virus count decreased the best when all the four interventions were applied together reinstating
the fact obtained earlier in the optimal control setting.
Some of the important mathematical modelling studies that deal with transmission and spread of COVID19 at the population level can be found in [1, 8, 12, 21]. In the recent work [5], an in-host modelling study
deals with the qualitative characteristics and estimation of standard parameters of corona viral infections. The
optimal control studies involving four clinical drug interventions which is being attempted here is the first of its
kind for COVID-19.

OBJECTIVES
1. To investigate the role of pharmaceutical interventions such as Arbidol, Remdesivir, Interferon and
Lopinavir/Ritonavir by incorporating them as controls at specific sites in the pathogenesis.
2. To study and compare the dynamics of susceptible, infected cells and viral load with and without these
control interventions by studying them as optimal control problems.
3. To propose the optimal drug regimen in four scenarios involving administration of single drug, two drugs,
three drugs and all the four drugs based on the average susceptible, infected cell count, average viral load
and basic reproduction number.
4. To propose the optimal drug regimen using the comparative effectiveness studies.
Research In Context
Evidence before the study: The efficacy of drugs in the treatment of COVID-19 infection was assessed and
reported in a few clinical trials and observational studies. The role of combination of anti-microbial agents
in achieving the favorable outcome is very well established in several viral diseases including HIV, dengue
hemorrhagic fever etc. To determine the utility of combined anti-microbials through the clinical studies will
take a long way and considering the current mortalities due to COVID-19 cannot be awaited for.
Added value of this study: The current research study is the first hand evidence for the efficacy of
combined anti-microbial agents for the treatment of COVID-19. The study assessed the combined efficacy
of four therapeutic interventions namely Arbidol, Remdesivir, Interferons and Lopinavir/Ritonavir. Optimal
reduction in the viral load and the number of infected cells can be significantly achieved when the above four
interventions used in combination as compared with the efficacy of individual therapeutic agent.
Implications of all the available evidence: The mathematical evidence generated out of this study will
pave a way for developing a standardized clinical treatment regimen both on therapeutic and research avenues.

METHODS
A within-host mathematical model incorporating four drug interventions was studied as an optimal control
problem. The Fillipov Existence Theorem was used to obtain an optimal solution [11]. Characterization of
optimal controls is done using Maximum Principle [11]. Numerical simulations involving with and without
control interventions were performed for obtaining optimal drug regimen. Comparative effectiveness method [6]
was used to study the change in basic reproduction number and virus count for single and multiple interventions.

Optimal Control Studies

2.1

Optimal Control Problem Formulation

Drugs such as Remdesivir inhibit RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and drugs Lopinavir/Ritonavir inhibit
the viral protease there by reducing viral replication [17]. Interferons are broad spectrum antivirals, exhibiting
both direct inhibitory effect on viral replication and supporting an immune response to clear virus infection
[18]. On the other hand drugs such as Arbidol not only inhibits the viral replication but also blocks the virus
replication by inhibiting the fusion of lipid membranes with host cells [22].
Motivated by the above clinical findings in similar lines to control problem in [2], we consider a control
problem with the drug interventions Arbidol, Remdesivir, Lopinavir/Ritonavir and Interferon as controls.

To reduce the complexity of the problem here we choose to model the control efforts via a linear combination
of the quadratic terms. Also when the objective function is quadratic with respect to the control, dierential
equations arising from optimization have a known solution. Other functional forms sometimes lead to systems
of dierential equations that are dicult to solve [4], [9].

L(S, I, V, U1 , U2 , U3 , U4 ) = A1 U1 + A2 U2 + A3 U3 + A4 U4 − I(t) − V (t)
is called the Lagrangian of the running cost.
Here the cost function (4) represents the benefits of each of the interventions and the number of infected
cells and viral load throughout the observation period. Our goal is to maximize the benefits of each of the
interventions and minimize the infected cell and virus population.
The coefficients Ai , for i = 1, 2, 3, 4 are the constants related to the benefits of each of the interventions and
their values will be chosen based on the value of the hazard ratio of individual drugs.
The admissible solution set for the optimal control problem (1) - (4) is given by,
Ω = {(S, I, V, U1 , U2 , U3 , U4 ) | S, I and V that satisfy (1) − (3) ∀ Ui ∈ U }
where U is the set of all admissible controls given by
U = {U1 = (µ1A (t), µ2A (t), µ3A (t)), U2 = (µ2Rem (t), µ3Rem (t)), U3 = (µ2IN F (t), µ3IN F (t)), U4 = (µ2Lop/Rit (t), µ3Lop/Rit
µ1A (t)) ∈ [0, µ1A max], µ2A (t) ∈ [0, µ2A max], µ3A (t) ∈ [0, µ3A max], µ2Rem (t) ∈ [0, µ2Rem max], µ2IN F (t) ∈

[0, µ3Lop/Rit max], t ∈ [0, T ]}.

Existence of Optimal Controls

Theorem 1. There exists a 9-tuple of optimal controls (µ∗1A (t), µ∗2A (t), µ∗3A (t), µ∗2Rem (t), µ∗3Rem (t),
µ∗2IN F (t), µ∗3IN F (t), µ∗2Lop/Rit (t), µ∗3Lop/Rit (t)) in the set of admissible controls U such that the cost functional
is maximized i.e.,

J = max(µ1A ,µ2A ,µ3A ,µ2Rem ,µ3Rem ,µ2IN F ,µ3IN F ,µ2Lop/Rit ,µ3Lop/Rit )∈U J[µ1A (t), µ2A (t), µ3A (t)), µ2Rem (t)), µ3Rem (t)),

µ2IN F (t)), µ3IN F (t)), µ2Lop/Rit (t)), µ3Lop/Rit (t)] corresponding to the optimal control problem (1) - (4).
Proof. In order to show the existence of optimal control functions, we will show that the following conditions
are satisfied :
1. The solution set for the system (1) - (4) along with bounded controls must be non-empty, i.e., Ω 6= φ.
2. U is closed and convex and system should be expressed linearly in terms of the control variables with
coefficients that are functions of time and state variables.
3. The Lagrangian L should be convex on U and L(S, I, V, µ1A , µ2A , µ3A , µ2Rem , µ3Rem , µ2zinc , µ3zinc ,
µ2Lop/Rit , µ3Lop/Rit ) ≥ g(µ1A , µ2A , µ3A , µ2Rem , µ3Rem , µ2IN F , µ3IN F , µ2Lop/Rit , µ3Lop/Rit ), where g is a
continuous function of control variables such that |(µ1A , µ2A , µ3A , µ2Rem , µ3Rem , µ2IN F , µ3IN F , µ2Lop/Rit , µ3Lop/Rit )|−1
g(µ1A , µ2A , µ3A , µ2Rem , µ3Rem , µ2IN F , µ3IN F , µ2Lop/Rit , µ3Lop/Rit ) → ∞
whenever |(µ1A , µ2A , µ3A , µ2Rem , µ3Rem , µ2IN F , µ3IN F , µ2Lop/Rit , µ3Lop/Rit )| → ∞, where |.| is an l2 (0, T )
norm.
Now we will show that each of the conditions are satisfied :
1. From positivity and boundedness of solutions of the system (1) - (3), all solutions are bounded for each
bounded control variable in U .
Also, the right hand side of the system (1) - (3) satisfies Lipschitz condition with respect to state variables.
Hence, using the positivity and boundedness condition and the existence of solution from Picard-Lindelof
Theorem [14], we have satisfied condition 1.
2. U is closed and convex by definition. Also, the system (1) - (3) is clearly linear with respect to controls
such that coefficients are only state variables or functions dependent on time. Hence condition 2 is satisfied.

3. Choosing g(µ1A , µ2A , µ3A , µ2Rem , µ3Rem , µ2IN F , µ3IN F , µ2Lop/Rit , µ3Lop/Rit )
= c(µ1A , µ2A , µ3A , µ2Rem , µ3Rem , µ2IN F , µ3IN F , µ2Lop/Rit , µ3Lop/Rit ) such that c = min {A1 , A2 , A3 , A4 }, we
can satisfy the condition 3.
Hence there exists a control 9-tuple (µ1A , µ2A , µ3A , µ2Rem , µ3Rem , µ2IN F , µ3IN F , µ2Lop/Rit , µ3Lop/Rit ) ∈ U
that maximizes the cost function (4).

Characteriztion of Optimal Controls

We now obtain the necessary conditions for optimal control functions using the Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle
[11] and also obtain the characteristics of the optimal controls.
The Hamiltonian for this problem is given by
H(S, I, V, µ1A , µ2A , µ3A , µ2Rem , µ3Rem , µ2IN F , µ3IN F , µ2Lop/Rit , µ3Lop/Rit , λ)

Here λ = (λ1 ,λ2 ,λ3 ) is called co-state vector or adjoint vector.
Now the Canonical equations that relate the state variables to the co-state variables are given by

Now, to obtain the optimal controls, we will use the Hamiltonian minimization condition ∂u

Optimal Drug Regimen

In this section, we perform numerical simulations to understand the efficacy of single and multiple drug interventions and propose the optimal drug regimen in these scenarios. This is done by studying the effect of the
corresponding controls on the dynamics of the system (1) - (3).
The efficacy of various combinations of controls considered are:
1. Single drug/intervention administration.
2. Two drugs/interventions administration.
3. Three drugs/interventions administration.
4. All the four drugs/interventions administration.
The theoretical results obtained are validated for a set of model parameters obtained using ode23 solver in
MATLAB. For our simulations, we have taken the total number of days as T = 30. The values of ω, µ and µ1 , α
are taken from [15] and [5] respectively. The rest of the parameter values of the model are estimated minimizing
the root mean square difference between the model predictive output and the experimental data chosen from
[19, 16]. Based on the above, the parameter values chosen for the model 1 are summarized in the following table.

We first solve the state system numerically using Fourth Order Runge-Kutta method in MATLAB without
any interventions. We take the initial values of state variables to be S(0) = 3.2 × 105 , I(0) = 0, V (0) = 5 and
the initial values of the control parameters as zeros.
Now, to simulate the system with controls, we use the Forward-Backward Sweep method starting with the
initial values of controls to be zero and solve the state system forward in time. Following this we solve the
adjoint state system backward in time due to the transversality conditions, using the optimal state variables
and initial values of optimal controls which are zero4.
Now, using the values of adjoint state variables, the values of optimal control are updated and with these
updated control variables, we go through this process again. We continue this till the convergence criterion is
met [11].
In Survival analysis, Hazard Ratio (HR) plays a crucial role in determining the rate at which the people
treated by drug may suffer a certain complication per unit time as the control population. Larger the hazard

6

ratio, more harmful the drug to be administered. We use this concept in assigning weights to our objective
function in our model. In the following table we enlist the the hazard ratios for the four drugs considered in
this work.

Table 1: Hazard Ratios (HR) for drugs considered

Based on the hazard ratio and effectiveness of the drugs in treatment of Covid-19 we choose the positive
weights for objective coefficients as A1 = 500, A2 = 400, A3 = 250, A4 = 200. A1 is chosen high compared to
other coefficients because it has the least hazard ratio.

5.1

WITHOUT ANY DRUGS / INTERVENTIONS

In this section we simulate the behavior of susceptible, infected cells and viral load over time. As can be seen
from figure 1 the susceptible cells reduce and the infected cells increase exponentially due to the increase in
viral load over a period of time.

growth of the infected cells and viral load can be observed.

From the table 4 the average values of the susceptible cells, infected cells and the viral load with respect to
three control interventions administered at a time is listed. From this table 4 it can be seen that the combination
of Arbidol, INF and Lopinavir/Ritonavir (U1 = U1∗ , U3 = U3∗ , U4 = U4∗ ) reduces the infected cells and viral load
the best compared to other combination of drugs when administered followed by drug combination Arbidol,
Remdsivir and Lopinavir/Ritonavir (U1 = U1∗ , U2 = U2∗ , U4 = U4∗ ). On the other hand, surprisingly the average
number of the susceptible cells are lesser in no control intervention case compared to any other case having
three control interventions. This can be attributed to side effects of multiple drug interventions involving more
than two drug administration at a time to patient.

interventions are administered at a time. Figures 11, 12, 13 depict the susceptible, infected population and viral

From the table 5 the average values of the susceptible cells, infected cells and the viral load with respect to all
four control interventions administered at a time is listed. From this table 5 it can be seen that the combination
of all four drug interventions reduce the infected cells and viral load compared to no intervention case. Like in
the three drug control intervention case here also the average number of the susceptible cells are lesser in no
control intervention case compared to all four control interventions case. This again can be attributed to side
effects of multiple drug interventions involving more than two drug administration at a time to patient.

Broadly we consider two kinds of interventions for this comparative effectiveness study.
1. Drugs that inhibit viral replication: All the fours interventions Arbidol, Remdesivir, Interferon, Lopinavir/Ritonavir
does this job. So we now choose α to be α(1 − 1 )(1 − 2 )(1 − 3 )(1 − 4 ), where 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 are chosen
based on the efficacy of the drugs Arbidol, Remdesivir, Interferon and Lopinavir/Ritonavir respectively.
2. Drugs that block virus binding to susceptible cells : Arbidol does this job. So we now choose β to be
β(1 − γ), where γ is the efficacy of the drug Arbidol in blocking virus binding to susceptible cells.

R0 plays a crucial role in understanding the spread of infection in the individual and V determines the
infectivity of virus in an individual. Taking the two kinds of interventions into consideration, we now have
modified basic reproductive number RE and modified virus count V E of the endemic equilibrium to be
α(1 − 1 )(1 − 2 )(1 − 3 )(1 − 4 )β(1 − γ)ω

The efficacy of these interventions is taken based on hazard ratios. For Arbidol, we choose γ = 0.7 and 1 =
0.173 ; for Remdesivir, we choose 2 = 0.67 ; for Interferon, we choose 3 = 0.625; for Lopinavir/Ritonavir, we
choose 4 = 0.6;
We now do the comparative effectiveness study of these interventions by calculating the percentage reduction
of R0 and V for single and multiple combination of these interventions. Percentage reduction of R0 and V are

Table 6: Comparative Effectiveness Study
In the table 6 the comparative effectiveness is calculated and measured on a scale from 1 to 16 with 1
denoting the lowest comparative effectiveness while 16 denoting the highest comparative effectiveness. The
conclusions from this study are the following.
1. When single drug/intervention is administered, Arbidol outperforms other drugs/interventions w.r.t reduction both R0 and V (refer rows 2 to 5 in table 6).
2. When two drugs/interventions are administered, Remdesivir and Arbidol combination performs better
than any combination of two drugs/interventions in reducing R0 and V (refer rows 6 to 11 in table 6).
3. When three drugs/interventions are administered, Remdesivir,Interferon and Arbidol combination performs better than any combination of three drugs/interventions in reducing R0 and V (refer rows 12 to
15 in table 6).
4. The best reduction in R0 and V is seen (refer row 16 in table 6) when all the four drugs/interventions are
applied in combination.

Discussion and Conclusions

In this work we have considered four drug interventions namely, Arbidol, Remdesivir, Interferon, Lopinavir/Ritonavir
and studied their efficacy for treatment of COVID-19 when applied individually or in combination. This study
is done in two ways.
The first by modeling these interventions as control interventions and studying the optimal control problem. In this approach, we find a control for a Dynamical system over a period of time such that an objective
function is optimised. It has numerous applications in both science and engineering. For this modelling study,
the dynamical system is the dynamics of cells and virus in a human body. An optimal control problem with
drug-treatment control on the within host dynamical system is proposed and studied. The second study was the
comparative effectiveness study. This research study adopts many of the same approaches and methodologies
as cost-effectiveness analysis, including the use of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and qualityadjusted life years (QALYs). Engaging various strategies in this process, while difficult, makes research more
applicable through providing information that improves patient decision making
Conclusions from the optimal control studies and comparative effectiveness studies suggest the following.
1. All the drugs when administered individually or in combination reduce the infected cells and viral load
significantly.
2. The average infected cell count and viral load decreased the most when all the four interventions were
applied together.
3. The average susceptible cell count decreased the best when Arbidol alone was administered.
4. The best reduction in basic reproduction number and viral count was obtained when all the four drugs/interventions
are applied in combination.
