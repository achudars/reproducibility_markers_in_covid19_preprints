Abstract
Shaped by human movement, place connectivity is quantified by the strength of spatial
interactions among locations. For decades, spatial scientists have researched place connectivity,
applications, and metrics. The growing popularity of social media provides a new data stream
where spatial social interaction measures are largely devoid of privacy issues, easily assessable,
and harmonized. In this study, we introduced a place connectivity index (PCI) based on spatial
interactions among places revealed by geotagged tweets as a multiscale, spatiotemporal-

continuous, and easy-to-implement measurement. The proposed PCI, established and
demonstrated at the US county level, exhibits a strong positive association with SafeGraph
population movement records (10% penetration in the US population) and Facebook’s social
connectedness index (SCI), a popular connectivity index based on social networks. We found
that PCI has a strong state boundary effect and that it generally follows the distance decay effect,
although this force is weaker in more urbanized counties with a denser population. Our
investigation further suggests that PCI has great potential in addressing real-world problems that
require place connectivity knowledge, exemplified with two applications: 1) modeling the spatial
spread of COVID-19 during the early stage of the pandemic, and 2) modeling hurricane
evacuation destination choice. The methodological and contextual knowledge of PCI, together
with the launched visualization platform and open-sourced PCI datasets at various geographic
levels, is expected to support research fields requiring knowledge in human spatial interactions.

Introduction
Since the proposal of “social physics” in 1948 by John Stewart, an astrophysicist who
first attempted to reveal spatial interaction based on the concept of the Newtonian gravitational
framework (Stewart, 1948), research on modeling, documenting, and understanding human
spatial interaction has been a research hotspot in geography and related fields. From a
geographic perspective, human movements express the spatial interactions among places,
featured by human characteristics (population, land use, culture, etc.) and physical characteristics
(climate, geology, landscape, etc.) (Massey, 1994). Relationships among places are shaped by
constant human movement, and the intensity of such movement further quantifies the
connectivity strength among places. Thus, understanding connectivity between two places
provides fundamental knowledge regarding their interactive gravity, benefiting various
applications such as infectious disease modeling, transportation planning, tourism management,
evacuation modeling, and other fields requiring knowledge in human spatial interactions.
However, measuring such interactions is a challenging task. For decades, geographers
have been trying to document spatial interactions and place connectivity at various
spatiotemporal scales. Early efforts (widely adopted until now) to examine spatial interactions
involved survey utilization. Researchers used questionnaires to understand spatial interactions,
aiming to gauge both long-term spatial movement, such as migration patterns (Barcus and
Brunn, 2010; Boyle, 2014; Salt, 1987;), and short-term spatial displacement, such as evacuation
and traveling (Buliung and Kanaroglou, 2006; Calantone et al., 1989; Durage et al., 2014; Pham
et al., 2020; Santos et al., 2011; Siebeneck and Cova, 2012). The well-documented spatial
interactions from these surveys contribute to our understanding of how people move across space
and how places are connected; however, such an approach suffers from limitations of small

sample sizes (Martín et al., 2020a), limited temporal resolution (Pereira et al., 2013), and
resource demands (Martín et al., 2020b).
The limitations of survey-based approaches largely preclude spatiotemporal-continuous
observations in spatial interactions, therefore inducing discrete place connectivity measurements.
However, place connectivity should not be considered as a fixed spatiotemporal property of
places. Instead, connectivity is ever-changing and evolving rapidly in modern society (Batten,
2001; Gao, 2015; Macdonald and Grieco, 2007). As argued by many, technological advances in
the past decades have greatly facilitated connectivity by the weakening geographic limits (Tranos
and Nijkamp, 2013). To capture the temporal nature of spatial interactions, researchers have
emphasized the importance of transportation data that detail people’s moving patterns. Place
connectivity has been measured using various transportation means that include airline flows
(Derudder and Witlox, 2008; Xu and Harriss, 2008), highway traffic (Zhang et al., 2020),
railway flows (Yang et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2019), and intercity bus networks (Ghafoor et al.,
2014). The rich traffic information and the derived spatial networks greatly facilitate our
understanding of how places are connected via these transportation modes. However,
transportation-based approaches pose new challenges. First, such data are generally difficult to
obtain, as they are often confidential or collected by private companies. Second, the data
themselves are mode-specific, lacking the holistic views of the overall human spatial interactions
and place connectivity, which are often needed in fields such as infectious disease modeling. A
notable effort to tackle the latter issue is by Lin et al. (2019), who constructed a combined intercity connectivity measurement based on multiple data sources for 9 cities in China and
demonstrated its advantage over the index derived from a single data source. This study offers
valuable insights in understanding how cities are connected using a holistic approach. Due to

data availability issues, however, it is challenging to construct such a combined index that are
spatiotemporal-continuous for a large area (e.g., a country or the entire world) at various
geographic settings and levels (e.g., urban, suburb, or rural; county, state/province, or country).
The emerging concepts of “Web 2.0” (O'Reilly, 2007) and “Citizen as Sensors”
(Goodchild, 2007), largely benefiting from the advent of geo-positioning technologies, offer a
new avenue to actively and passively gather and collect the digital traces left by electronic device
holders (Liu et al., 2015; Li et al., 2019). For example, passive trace collection involves data
obtained from mobile phone data (Amini et al., 2014; Gonzalez et al., 2008), smart cards (Agard
et al., 2006; Ma et al., 2013), or wireless networks (Perttunen et al., 2014). The spatial
interactions documented from these passively collected traces tend to have high
representativeness, given their high data penetration ratios. However, privacy and confidentiality
concerns have been raised for such approaches, as individuals do not intend to actively share
their locational information and are unaware of the usage of the generated positions (de
Montjoye et al., 2018; Kontokosta and Johnson, 2017).
An approach less encumbered with privacy issues is based on spatial information from
social media, a digital platform aiming to facilitate information sharing that has been popularized
in recent years. Owing to their active sharing characteristics, social media data are less abundant
compared to passively collected GPS positions from mobile devices but are less intrusive (Huang
et al., 2020a; Jiang et al., 2019a), more accessible (Hu et al., 2020), and more harmonized
(Huang et al., 2020b). The huge volume of user-generated content covering extensive areas
facilitates the timely need for summarizing human spatial interactions. Twitter, for example, has
quickly become the largest social media data source for geospatial research and has been widely
used in human mobility studies (Fiorio et al., 2017; Jurdak et al., 2015; Li et al., 2020a; Soliman

et al., 2017), given its free application programming interface (API) that allows unrestricted
access to about 1% of the total tweets (Hawelka et al., 2014). We believe that the enormous
sensing network constituted by millions of Twitter users worldwide provides unprecedented data
to measure place connectivity at various spatiotemporal scales.
As an essential component in human interaction, social connections that involve online
searching, friendships, account following, news mentioning, and information reposting can also
contribute to place connectivity measurement. For example, the co-occurrences of toponyms on
massive web documents, news articles, or social media were extracted to measure city
relatedness and connectivity (Liu et al. 2014; Hu et al., 2017; Ye et al., 2020). A recent effort
from Facebook explores connectivity measurement among places (called Social Connectedness
Index, SCI) utilizing the social networks constructed from massive friendship links on Facebook
(Bailey et al., 2018). However, whether or how the place connectivity measured by social
connections differs from the one measured by physical connections is worth further
investigation. In view of the existing studies, gaps still exist in 1) the effort to construct a
harmonized, multi-scale, spatiotemporal-continuous place connectivity measurement based on
the physical movement from social media users, 2) examining the utility of the derived place
connectivity in solving real-world problems, and 3) applications to visualize place connectivity
at various geographic levels with downloadable and ready-to-use connectivity matrices to
support research needs.
Taking advantage of big social media data and the advancement of high-performance
computing, we introduce a place connectivity index (PCI) based on people’s movement among
places captured from big Twitter data. Specifically, in this study, we computed PCI from billions
of geotagged tweets for various geographic levels including US census tract, US county, world

first-level subdivision, and world country. We compared population movement derived from
Twitter data with the SafeGraph (2020) movement data in the U.S. to evaluate how well
geotagged tweets captured population movement. We compared PCI with Facebook’s SCI, a
popular connectivity index based on social networks, to reveal the association between spatial
interactions and social interactions. We also investigated the spatial properties of PCI and found
that PCI has a strong state boundary effect and that it generally follows the distance decay effect,
although this effect is weaker in more urbanized counties with denser populations.
The utility of PCI is exemplified in two applications: 1) modeling the spatial spread of
COVID-19 during the early stage of the pandemic, and 2) modeling hurricane evacuation
destination choice. The results demonstrate the great potential of PCI in addressing real-world
problems requiring place connectivity knowledge. Finally, we constructed massive PCI matrices
and launched an interactive portal for users to visualize the strength of connectivity among
geographic regions at various scales. The derived worldwide PCI matrices at various geographic
levels are open sourced to support research needs. Serving as a harmonized and understandable
connectivity metric, the Twitter-derived PCI data are expected to benefit varied domains
demanding place connectivity knowledge, such as disease transmission modeling, transportation
planning, evacuation simulation, and tourist prediction.

Place Connectivity Index
A Place Connectivity Index (PCI) between two places is defined as the normalized
number of shared persons (unique Twitter users) between the two places during a specified time
period (e.g., one year; Fig. 1). For example, if a user is observed at both places during the time
period, the user is considered a shared user between the two places. PCI can be computed at
various geographic scales. For example, a place can be a county, state, or country. PCI does not

aim to capture the real-time population movement between places (though it is derived from such
movement); rather, it provides a relatively stable measurement of how strong two places are
connected by spatial interactions. The strength of the connection between two places can be
determined by many factors, such as geographic distance (the first law of geography; Miller,
2004), transportation, administrative/regional limits (e.g., states), physical barriers (e.g., rivers
and mountains), social networks, demographic and socioeconomic similarities or differences.
The shared users among places derived from Twitter data can be considered as an observable
outcome of the combined force of these factors, and thus is modeless, with the understanding of
Twitter data limitations (e.g., population bias). In this sense, PCI should be calculated in a
relatively long time period (e.g., a year) to gather sufficient information to summarize the
general patterns.

Fig. 1. Illustration of Place Connectivity Index based on shared social media users.

Following the general geometric average and normalization strategy (Liu et al., 2014;
Bailey et al., 2018; Lin et al., 2019), the PCI between place i and place j (denoted as PCIij) is
computed by Eq. 1.

𝑃𝐶𝐼𝑖𝑗 = √

𝑺𝒊𝒋 𝟐
𝑺𝒊 𝑺𝒋

𝑖, 𝑗 ∈ [1, 𝑛]

Eq. 1

where Si is the number of observed persons (unique social media users) in place i within time
period T; Sj is the number of observed persons in place j within time period T; Sij is the number
of shared persons between places i and j within time period T; and n is the number of places in
the study area.
Places with a higher population tend to have more social media users, and thus tend to
have more shared users among them. The denominator in Eq. 1 is used to normalize the metric
based on the relative populations in the two places. PCI ranges from 0 to 1. When no shared user
is observed between two places, PCI equals 0. If all users in place i visit place j (vice versa) and
the two places have the same number of users (or when i = j ), PCI equals 1. PCI provides a
relative measurement of how strong places are connected through human spatial interactions
when assuming all places have the same population (social media users). This allows us to
compare PCI among different places to reveal potential spatial, population, and socioeconomic
structures. The PCI derived from Eq. 1 is non-directional. The discussion for a directional PCI
capturing the asymmetrical connection forces between two places can be found in Appendix A.
In the following sections we use US county level PCI to explore PCI properties and demonstrate
the utility of PCI.

Results
Computation of PCI
The computation of PCI is data and computing intensive as it involves billions of
geotagged tweets and millions of place pairs at various geographic levels. To address this
challenge, the computation was performed in a Hadoop-based high-performance computing

environment (Li et al., 2020a). The steps for computing the 2019 US county level PCI are
detailed in Appendix B. With Eq. 1, PCI was computed for the following four geographic levels
in this study: 1) 2019 census tract level PCI for the Las Angeles county, US, 2) 2018 and 2019
county-level PCI for the entire contiguous US, 3) 2019 worldwide first-level subdivision PCI,
and 4) 2019 worldwide country level PCI.
An interactive web portal was developed to visualize a place’s connectivity (PCI) to other
places (Fig. 2). The number of shared users between two places (without normalization) at
different levels are also included in the portal for comparison with PCI.

(Chicago), Illinois, to all other counties. The portal and PCI datasets are publicly accessible at

Comparing with SafeGraph Population Movement

One of the key concerns of using social media data (e.g., Twitter) for human mobility
studies is its low population penetration rate. For example, only 24% of US adults use Twitter
(Pew Research Center, 2019), and the public Twitter API only returns about 1% of the whole
Twitter streams. Also, Twitter data show bias in its representativeness of population groups. This
issue has been examined in a few studies (Jiang et al., 2019; Li et al., 2013; Malik et al., 2015).
In light of these issues, it is important to evaluate how well geotagged tweets capture population
movements (at the county level in this study) since PCI is computed from such movement.
For this purpose, we compared the US county-level population movement derived from Twitter
to the movement derived from SafeGraph (https://www.safegraph.com), a commercial data
company that aggregates anonymized location data from various sources. According to
SafeGraph (2019), the data are aggregated from about 10% of mobile devices (e.g., cellphones)
in the US, and the sampling correlates highly with the actual US Census populations, with a
Pearson correlation coefficient r of 0.97 at the county level. Specifically, the data we used in this
study are the publicly available SafeGraph’s Social Distancing Metrics (SDM) (SafeGraph,
2020), a census block group level daily mobility data product going back to January 1, 2019
covering the entire US. Since these data only provide aggregated mobility information, deriving
the shared users among counties is not possible. Alternatively, we computed the total number of
person-day movements between all contiguous US county pairs in 2019 using the SDM (see
Appendix C). To make it comparable, we also computed the total number of person-day
movements between all US county pairs in 2019 using Twitter data (see Appendix D). We then
compared, using Pearson’s r, the two person-day movement datasets by county.

Fig. 3. Distribution of the Pearson’s r between the log Twitter person-day movements and log
SafeGraph person-day movements for all counties (a) Spatial distribution; (b) histogram

The overall Pearson’s r for all county pairs (n = 1,516,210) between log Twitter personday movements and log SafeGraph person-day movements is 0.71. The rationale for using log
transformation (with base 10) is to address the highly skewed distribution of movements among
counties. To reveal the spatial variations of the relationship for different areas, we further
evaluated the association between the two movement datasets for the county pairs from each
county to other counties. The spatial distribution of r illustrates lower values generally clustering
in less populated areas, such as the Great Plains portion of the US (Fig. 3a). This is as expected,
as Twitter data generally suffer in less populated areas due to insufficient tweets collected using
the public free API. The histogram (Fig. 3b) indicates the most repeated r ranges between 0.65
and 0.75.

To further examine the associations between the two movement datasets and the impact
of county population size on the associations, we selected four counties with different
geographical contexts and populations ranging from 3,300 to 10,000,000, and plotted the
Twitter-derived person day movements and SafeGraph-derived person day movements in 2019
for each county. The scatter plots (Fig. 4) reveal a quasi-linear positive pattern for all four
counties. Consistent with Fig. 3, the r value decreases as population decreases for the four
counties of Los Angeles County, CA (0.88), Harris County, TX (0.87), Horry County, SC (0.82),
and Ford County, KS (0.57). Notably, we observed only a slight drop in r (from 0.88 to 0.82) for
Horry County with a relatively small population of 354,081. The findings indicate that geotagged
Twitter-derived movement has a strong linear association with SafeGraph-derived population
movement and reinforce that geotagged tweets can well capture population movements among
places (counties in this study).

person day movements in 2019 for the four selected counties with varying populations. (a) Los

million; (b) Harris County, Texas (TX), including Houston city. The most populous county in TX. 2019
population: 4.71 million; (c) Horry County, South Carolina (SC), including the popular beach destination
Myrtle Beach. 2019 population: 354,081; and (d) Ford County, Kansas (KS), including the small Dodge
City. 2019 population: 33,619. Population data were derived from the American Community Survey
(ACS) 5-Year Data (2015–2019). US Census (2019).

Comparing PCI with Facebook SCI
We contrasted the PCI for each of the US counties with the Facebook Social
Connectedness Index (SCI) data (Bailey et al., 2018a). This comparison allows us to evaluate the
hypothesis that places connected through (social media) friendship links are likely to have more
physical interactions (e.g., population movement). This hypothesis has already been suggested in
recent studies (Kuchler et al., 2021), but not corroborated using SCI data. Thus, demonstrating
this connection is relevant for many reasons, such as understanding spatial behavior under
normal circumstances (e.g., business or commercial relationships, tourism, and migrations) or
during extraordinary events such as a pandemic (e.g., the spread of infectious diseases) or a
natural hazard (e.g., evacuation corridors).
As a measure of social connectedness based on friendship links on Facebook, SCI
revealed that the majority of these links are found within 100 miles, showing an intense distance
decay effect (Bailey et al., 2018b). The hypothesis of a positive association between social and
spatial connections makes intuitive sense and helps understand population dynamics at different
scales. To evaluate this, we first analyzed the correlation between PCI and SCI using all county
pairs that had both PCI and SCI values (n = 1,702,531). Log transformation was used to address
the highly skewed distribution of the PCI and SCI values among counties. Note that PCI values
were multiplied by 1000 before taking the log to avoid negative values. The overall r of 0.62
indicates a strong linear association between social and spatial connections.

Fig. 5. Scatter plots of log PCI and log PCI for the four counties

Fig. 5 shows the scatter plots of log PCI and log SCI in 2019 for the four counties used in
the previous section, further confirming the association of a measure of social connectedness
with an index of spatial connectivity. The scatter plots also reveal that the association between
SCI and PCI are not always stronger in more populated counties (e.g., r for Harris County is 0.66
while for the less populated Horry County it is 0.75). Another interesting observation is that the
slope of the best-fit line is higher in more populated counties (e.g., Los Angeles County) than in
lowly populated areas (Ford County), indicating that the same amount of change in friendships

(SCI) is associated with larger change in people’s movement (PCI) in more populated counties,
vice versa. To further examine the variations of such association among counties, we computed
the Pearson’s r between PCI and SCI for each county to other counties. Fig. 6a shows that strong
correlations are generally clustered in Midwest US, Texas, and Southeast Georgia. The
histogram (Fig. 6b) shows the most repeated r ranging between 0.70 and 0.75.

Fig. 6. Distribution of the Pearson’s r between log PCI and log Facebook SCI for all counties(a)
Spatial distribution; (b) histogram

The strong association between PCI and SCI confirms the hypothesis that regions
connected through (social media) friendship links are likely to have more physical interactions.
However, our findings also suggest caution about the relationship between these two variables.
Although PCI and SCI are associated, one cannot substitute one for the other, as they represent
different phenomena: social versus spatial behavior. More studies are needed to better
understand the driving forces (e.g., urban-rural, demographic, and socioeconomic factors) behind

the associations of the two variables. We believe PCI is an important addition, as it involves a
new standardized measure of spatial connectivity based on population movement.
Distance Decay Effect
Our analysis revealed that PCI expresses a clear distance decay effect. In other words, the
spatial connectivity between two distant places is likely to be lower than that observed between
two near counties. However, there are some nuances in this broad assertion. Fig. 7 illustrates the
association between log PCI and the log distance for each county to all other counties. The map
(Fig. 7a) shows that less populated (rural) areas of the Midwest, Pacific northwest, or Texas have
a stronger negative association between PCI and distance, meaning that these communities are
more tightly knit with surrounding areas than with more distant communities (stronger distance
decay effect). This phenomenon is also reflected in Fig. 8, where R2 values of the power law
function decrease dramatically from lowly populated Ford County (0.494) to Harris County
(0.154) to highly populated Los Angeles County (0.065). Pearson’s r was not used as the scatter
plot, as the relationship is nonlinear. It should be noted that population size is likely a
compounding factor that goes along with urban centers (e.g., metropolis) with large airports.

Fig. 7. Distribution of the Pearson’s r between log PCI and log distance for all counties(a) Spatial
distribution, (b) histogram

Fig. 8. Scatter plots of PCI and distance for the four counties.

The maps in Fig. 9 depict how the selected four counties are connected to other counties
based on the PCI, which agrees with the above observations. On the other hand, Fig. 9 also
shows that highly populated and touristy urban areas (well connected through airports), such as
New York City, Miami, Orlando, Chicago, or Las Vegas, act as poles of attraction for people
from distant locations. This is clear in Fig. 9a, where we can see how Los Angeles County, for
instance, is more closely linked through spatial interactions with the New York City metropolitan
area than with some California or Nevada counties. This behavior is also easily detected in Fig. 8
through the outliers of the point distributions in Los Angeles County.

with other counties in the contiguous US. Population data were derived from ACS 5-Year Data (2015–
2019) and US Census (2019).

Boundary Effect
Inspired by Bailey et al. (2018b), we also considered the effect of administrative borders
shaping spatial connectivity. A higher PCI between a county pair indicates a strong relationship
geographically. In a general sense, people tend to travel to their adjacent counties more
frequently than non-adjacent counties. However, do the residents near the state border prefer the
in-state counties as their destinations rather than the adjacent county across the state border? Or
are the out-of-state counties more attractive? If state borders have a role in explaining spatial
connectivity, people will tend to travel more within their home states than in neighboring states,
even when the distance is fixed.
To evaluate the state boundary effect for each of the four counties, we first ran a linear
regression with the following variables: the distance between the county and all other counties in
contiguous US (distance), a categorical variable (same_state), and PCI (as the dependent
variable). The result indicates that same_state variable shows a strong positive effect (p < .001)
on PCI even after controlling for distance (Table 1). This implies that these four counties are
more tightly (spatially) connected with other counties within the same state, even when
compared to nearby counties in other states.

To test whether existing state borders are similar to the borders formed when we grouped
together the US counties into communities (clusters) based on their spatial connectivity (i.e.,
PCI), we used a hierarchical agglomerative linkage clustering method following Bailey et al.
(2018b) to create such homogenic spatial connectivity communities and compare them with the
state administrative division of the US. Hierarchical agglomerative clustering groups county
pairs based on their distance in feature space. In our experiment, the “distance” is defined as the
inverse of PCI, which means a low PCI in a county pair has a long distance, and vice versa. In
the beginning, every county is viewed as a separate community, and the two closest communities
are combined into a new community. Distances of combined communities will be updated by the
average of distances between county pairs of community pairs. The clustering stops when all
counties are combined into a target number of communities. We chose 20, 50, and 75 clusters as
the targeted number of communities.

Fig. 10. Results of the hierarchical agglomerative clustering of PCI with three different targeted
numbers of communities for the contiguous US. Each color depicts a community.

As shown in Fig. 10, most resulting distinct communities in the three maps are spatially
contiguous, revealing the strong spatial connectivity of neighboring counties, an obvious
consequence of spatial proximity. However, the resemblance of these three maps with state
boundaries is quite remarkable across many areas, supporting the assertion that state boundaries
do play a decisive role in shaping the spatial behavior of the population. For example, we can see
how several clusters in the southwest US are essentially the state boundaries. Also, many other
smaller clusters also respect the actual state boundaries. This pattern holds in the three maps with
different cluster sizes. A strong state boundary effect was also observed in social connectivity
with Facebook SCI (Bailey et al. 2018b). These two findings are likely to be related; however,
we do not know which one drives the other or if there are other variables conditioning this
behavior (e.g., socio-spatial factors based on institutional or administrative circumstances).
Further studies are needed to better understand the state boundary effect of PCI and its
connections with SCI.
Fig. 11 shows the hierarchical agglomerative clustering of 2019 PCI for the worldwide
first-level subdivisions with two different numbers (25 and 100) of targeted communities (the
clustering results for 50 and 200 targeted communities can be found in Appendix E). The country

boundaries could be clearly observed in both maps. The results also reveal that the groupings
with the 25 communities are consistent with what most people perceive as connected regions
(e.g., US with Canada and the Europe). However, once into the 100 level the divisions between
east and west show up. Another interesting finding is how unconnected of the regions in Africa
are, though the country boundary effect is still observable. However, it should be cautious that
whether such disconnection is resulted from the sparsity of Twitter data in Africa countries as
elaborated in the Discussion section needs further investigation. In summary, the different
regions identified in the US and the world using the agglomerative clustering not only
demonstrates the boundary effect of PCI, but also suggests that PCI can be used as a potential
tool in regionalization analysis to reveal how places are connected and regions are formed at
different geographic levels.

Applications
PCI can potentially be applied in diverse fields that can benefit from a better
understanding of human movement at varying spatial scales, such as infectious disease spread in
public health, transportation, tourism, evacuation, and economics. Two examples are provided to
exemplify how PCI can be used as a potential factor in analyzing and predicting infectious
disease spreading and hurricane evacuation destination choice.
PCI as a Factor in Predicting the Spatial Spread of COVID-19 During the Early Stage
Westchester County is an early (March 2020) hotspot of COVID-19 in the US (Hogan et
al., 2020). Early confirmed cases and a high infection rate to family and friends increased social
tension that residents from Westchester and surrounding areas were reportedly fleeing away
(Tully and Stowe, 2020). In this application example, we explored the relationship between the
spread of COVID-19 in the US and PCIs for Westchester County, NY.
Given that the incubation period of COVID-19 is about two to three weeks (Lauer et al.,
2020), the number of cases confirmed before the end of March was used in the later calculation
to capture the spread of COVID-19 in early and mid-March. Fig. 12 shows the county-level
infection rate (number of confirmed cases per 10,000 people) as March 31, 2020. The number of
confirmed cases is based on the New York Times (2020) database, and the total county
population is based on the ACS five-year estimation (US Census, 2019). Dark red spots show the
hotspots of COVID-19 confirmed cases. Westchester County and surrounding New York City
areas were the main hotspots at the end of March.

Fig. 12. County level COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people as of March 31, 2020. COVID-19 case data
were downloaded from NYT Github (New York Times, 2020). The county population was retrieved from
the ACS five-year estimates (2014–2018).

To explore whether outbreaks of COVID-19 in the US are related to people who fled
away from New York City in early March (Carey and Glanz, 2020), we used a linear regression
model to examine the relationship between COVID-19 infection rate (as a dependent variable)
and the connectivity between a given county and Westchester County using four measurements,
including PCI computed with 2018 and 2019 Twitter data, respectively, Facebook SCI as of
August 2020, and 2020 SafeGraph movement data (the person-day movements computed with
the method in Appendix C using data from January to March, 2020). Note that PCI was scaled
by 1000 in the regression models to ease the result presentation. Table 2 shows the results of the
four linear regression models. For all four measurements, positive relationships are significant at

the 0.01 level. Among these four measurements, PCI for both 2018 and 2019 showed the highest
adjusted R2 of 0.24 for both years. In other words, 24% of the variance of COVID-19 infection
rate in each observed county can be explained by PCI alone. SafeGraph movement results in an
adjusted R2 of 0.13. Facebook-based SCI shows the lowest adjusted R2 of 0.08, though the
coefficient is still significant (p < 0.01).

Regression models controlling for the effect of geographic distance were also conducted
with the four human mobility measurements. Results show that all four measurements still show
significant positive correlations with the COVID-19 infection rate (p < 0.01; Table 3). The
adjusted R2 for SafeGraph-derived movement and Facebook SCI remain unchanged, and the
coefficient of the distance variable is not significant (p > 0.1). The adjusted R2 for both 2018 and
2019 PCIs only slightly increased by 0.01, from 0.24 to 0.25. While the distance variable is
significant in these two models, its impact on the infectious rate is relatively weak given the
small coefficient values (β = 0.00087 for 2019 PCI and β = 0.00091 for 2018 PCI).

This application demonstrates that PCI, computed from historical Twitter data, is a
promising indicator in predicting the spatial spread of COVID-19 during the early stage,
outperforming more current Facebook SCI (data as of August 2020) and SafeGraph-derived
person-day movement data (from January 1 to March 31, 2020). We remark that PCI calculated
with historical Twitter data of either 2018 or 2019 exhibits similar performance in the two
models, suggesting the stability of place connectivity measured by PCI.

PCI as a Factor in Predicting Hurricane Evacuation Destination Choices
Evacuation of coastal residents has been an effective and important protective action
before the arrival of a hurricane (Cutter and Smith, 2009). Understanding where coastal residents
are evacuating helps in evacuation route planning and resource allocations (Cheng et al., 2008).

Residents of a county are likely to evacuate to a county where they have established relationships
(friends, colleagues, familiar lodging stays, etc.). The preexisting relationships would be
expressed by the PCI or SCI. In this section, we examined the association between PCI
(computed using the 2019 Twitter data) and people’s evacuation destination choice using
Hurricane Matthew in 2016 as a case study. We hypothesize that people are more likely to
evacuate to a county that has a high PCI with the evacuation county. For comparison, we also
tested the hypothesis that people are more likely to evacuate to a county that has a high SCI with
the evacuation county.
Hurricane Matthew was a category 5 hurricane that visited the east coast of the US at
category 1 in early October 2016. Evacuation orders for coastal counties under potential impact
were placed by the governors of Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina on October 4,
2016. Twitter users were selected as individual evacuees for testing our hypothesis. The
evacuation identification procedure followed the study area and evacuation timeline determined
by Martin et al. (2017) and Jiang et al. (2019). In this study, we identified 272 evacuated
individual Twitter users from Chatham County, GA, and 241 evacuated users from Charleston
County, SC. All selected users had evacuated more than 50 miles away from their original
coastal counties, and all of their destinations were not in the potential impact zone. The 272
evacuated individuals leaving Chatham County ended up in 120 destination counties, and the 241
Charleston County evacuees ended up in 118 destination counties (Fig. 13).

Fig. 13 Hurricane Matthew Evacuation Estimation Using Geotagged Tweets. Red dots indicate user
locations during the pre-evacuation period (October 2–4, 2016). Blue dots show user locations during the
post-evacuation period (October 7–9, 2016).

To test our hypotheses and the potential of PCI in predicting evacuation destination
choice, we used a linear regression to model the relationship between the number of evacuated
users in the destination counties (dependent variable) and PCI of the county pairs between
Charleston County (origin) and each of the destination counties (n = 118). Note that PCI was
scaled by 1000 in the regression models to ease the result presentation. Distance between the
evacuation county and each of the destination counties were used in the regression model as
controls. SCI was tested by replacing PCI in the regression model for comparison. The same
model configuration was used for Chatham County (n = 120). Table 4 shows the regression
results for the four models.

For both counties, PCI shows a significant positive association with evacuee counts (p <
0.01). SCI shows a significant positive association with evacuee counts for Charleston County (p
< 0.01), but the coefficient is not significant for Chatham County (p > 0.1). The distance variable
is not significant for all four models (p > 0.1). The PCI model for Charleston County has an
adjusted R2 of 0.71, indicating 71% variance can be explained by PCI. However, the adjusted R2
value for SCI has a much lower value of 0.29. For Chatham County, the PCI model has an
adjusted R2 of 0.47, while the adjusted R2 value for the SCI model is only 0.04. This application
demonstrates the potential of using PCI as a factor in modeling hurricane evacuation destination
choice. The comparison of PCI and SCI shows that PCI outperforms SCI in this application
scenario.

Discussions
In this increasingly connected world, new places within cities or new types of relations
across different places may emerge. Human societies comprise many interrelated contexts where
individuals influence and interact with each other over space, time, and networks. Real-time
social media data provide a promising opportunity that allows researchers and professionals to
detect how places in cities are preferred, used, and related. Tweets capture a considerable portion
of the activities, events, and issues about our society at a fine space-time scale. They reflect not
only the socioeconomic activities that happen in our physical world, but also some cultures,
human interests, and public concerns that exist only in the perceptions of people. The geotagged
Twitter data allow us to detect locations where people visit. The sample size is much larger than
that of conventional surveys. Such large samples can capture the behavior of population groups
that are not easily accessible and hence difficult to be involved in conventional surveys,
particularly those underrepresented neighborhoods. Tweets allow a more natural and direct
sharing of information in contrast to surveys in which the subjects may feel that their behavior is
monitored.
This research employs massive geotagged Twitter data to delineate the spatial
interactions between places by developing PCI. The results show that tweets can be used to
reveal place connectivity, which also has strong correlations with other data streams such as
SafeGraph and Facebook. Compared to the latter data sources, Twitter data are more openly
available over time and at the individual level, which depicts the robust connection between
places from the human dynamics level. Given the increasing dynamic interplay among places
and in particular cities, the open-sourced PCI datasets at various geographic levels provide
invaluable opportunities to explore human behavior and social phenomena from the individual

perspective to the population level. As demonstrated by the two application examples, PCI can
be used for research in infectious disease and hurricane evacuation that benefit from a better
understanding of human movement.
The world should be viewed as networks rather than the mosaic of cities (Beaverstock et
al., 2000). Scholars of regional science, urban studies, and geography have long been interested
in the spatial interactions between cities as they convey the spatial structure of a region. The PCI
computed from billions of tweets offers promising opportunities to measure and compare the
connections and flows between cities. Also, PCI can be jointly linked to emerging geotagged
data, such as Yelp and Transportation Network Company data, to reveal a more complete picture
of spatial structure dynamics. Combined with PCI, the place hierarchy and spatial clusters can be
revealed based on both virtual and physical interactions.
Although the outcome of the behavior of PCI largely matches our expectations and with
the results of other big social data sources, using social media data to identify spatial interaction
has the following limitations. First, research using social media data has been criticized for being
biased for representing all populations. For example, young adults are more likely than their
older counterparts to use Twitter (Malik et al., 2015; Jiang et al., 2018). Second, the correlation
between PCI and other indicators from social networking platforms in the US is contextsensitive. Hence, the results may not be readily generalized or used for prediction in other places.
Further studies are needed to evaluate the PCI for geographic areas other than US. Third,
episodic events, such as holidays and hurricanes, would largely attract/hinder users' movement to
specific places, which might distort the connectivity if data is only collected for short periods.
These episodic events will affect the accuracy and consistency of measurement results. This
issue can be in part addressed by computing PCI over a relatively long period (e.g., one year) or

filtering out the data during the affected time period. Lastly, geotagged tweets are unevenly
distributed across space and time, which also affects the reliability of such measurements. Such
sparsity is caused by a variety of factors in including population density, Internet access, and
governmental policies on social media. Despite this limitation, to the best of our knowledge
Twitter data is the most accessible dataset offering the opportunity to extract worldwide human
movement at various spatiotemporal scales for a relatively long time period. While we argue that
any data has bias and limitations, studies using the Twitter-derived PCI datasets should be aware
of such limitations when interpreting the results.

Conclusions
Documenting and understanding human spatial interaction has been an active domain in
not just geography but other space-related social sciences for decades. Place relationships are
believed to be shaped by dynamic human movement, whose intensity further quantifies the
connectivity (strength of the linkages) among places. With the advances in technologies in the
past decades, the connectivity among places is ever-evolving dynamically, thus demanding
spatiotemporal-continuous observations with harmonized approaches. Fortunately, the
emergence of big social media data, benefiting from the advent of geo-positioning techniques
and the popularity of social media platforms, offers a new venue where collecting human spatial
interactions becomes less-privacy concerning, easily assessable, and harmonized.
In this study, we introduced a place connectivity index based on people’s spatial
interactions among places revealed from geotagged Twitter posts. Defined as the normalized
number of Twitter users who shared spatial interactions during a specified time period, the

proposed PCI is a harmonized and spatiotemporal-continuous place connectivity metric,
expected to benefit various domains requiring knowledge in human spatial interactions. The
interactive web portal aims to facilitate place connectivity visualization and provide
downloadable connectivity matrices to support research needs.
To better understand the characteristics of PCI, we conducted a series of experiments
using PCI and other data sources. An overall Pearson’s r of 0.71 between the population
movement derived from Twitter and SafeGraph (10% penetration in the US population) reveals
that geotagged tweets can well capture the population movement at the US county level. The
comparison between PCI and Facebook SCI (a popular connectivity index based on social
network) with an overall r = 0.62 suggests a strong connection between spatial interactions and
social interactions, confirming the hypothesis that “regions connected through many friendship
links are likely to have more physical interactions between their residents” (Kuchler, Russel &
Stroebel, 2021). Like many connectivity measurements that are bounded by the first law of
geography, we found that PCI generally follows distance decay form, while the distance decay
effect is found weaker in more urbanized counties with a denser population. This phenomenon
can be explained by the existence of long-distance transportation facilitates (e.g., airports,
railways, and bus stations) that, to some extent, express a hierarchical diffusion relationship
rather than a contagious diffusion. We further observed a strong state boundary effect in PCI,
indicating that counties in the same state are more connected, evidenced by their higher PCI
values. The different regions identified in the US and the world by using the hierarchical
agglomerative clustering suggests that PCI can be used as a tool in regionalization analysis to
reveal how places are connected at different geographic levels.

We demonstrated that PCI could address real-world problems requiring place
connectivity knowledge using two applications: 1) modeling the spatial spread of COVID-19
during the early stage and 2) modeling hurricane evacuation destination choices. In the first
application, we found that the proposed PCI for Westchester County, NY, an early hotspot of
COVID-19 in the U.S., could explain 22% of the variance in COVID-19 cases among U.S.
counties at the early outbreak, which was much higher than Facebook SCI (8%) and the
population movement derived from SafeGraph (13%). In the second application, we found that
PCI explains a considerably higher percentage of variance in local residents’ choices of
destination county during 2016 Hurricane Matthew compared with Facebook’s SCI, suggesting
the superiority of spatial interactions in modeling evacuation choices than social interactions.
With the effects of geographic distance being weakened by technological advances, place
connectivity quantified by human spatial interactions has been evolving since the very first day
of modern society and will continue to evolve at an accelerating pace in the future. Taking
advantage of the growing popularity of social media, the PCI proposed in this study contributes
to a scale-free, spatiotemporal-continuous measurement of place connectivity, benefiting
numerous applications such as infectious disease modeling, transportation planning, evacuation
modeling, tourism management, to list a few. The methodological and contextual knowledge of
PCI, together with the launched visualization platform and data sharing capability, is expected to
support research fields in need of prior knowledge in human spatial interactions.

Appendix A
Directional (or Asymmetrical) PCI
The same number of shared users between two places may have different impact on each
place. Suppose that two places i and j have 50 shared users, place i has 100 users in total, and
place j has 1000 users in total. In such a case, place j can be considered to have a larger impact
on place i as it has 50% of users shared with place j. Similarly, place i has a smaller impact on
place j as it only has 5% of users shared with place i.

Fig. A1. Illustration of the asymmetrical impact of the shared users on different places

To capture the asymmetrical impact of the same number of shared users on different
places, a directional PCI can be derived from Eq. A1 and Eq. A2.

Where PCIi→j denotes the impact of place i on place j, and PCIj→i denotes the impact of
place j on place i. Si is the number of observed persons (unique social media users) in place i
within time period T; Sj is the number of observed persons in place j within time period T; Sij is
the number of shared persons between places i and j within time period T; and n is the number of
places in the study area. For the two places illustrated in Figure A1, the directional PCIi→j =
0.500, PCIj→i = 0.050, and the non-directional PCIij = 0.158.
Same as the non-directional (or symmetrical) PCI discussed in the paper, the directional
(or asymmetrical) PCI was also computed for the following four geographic levels: 1) 2019
census tract level PCI for the Las Angeles county, US, 2) 2018 and 2019 county-level PCI for
the entire contiguous US, 2) 2019 worldwide first-level subdivision PCI, and 4) 2019 worldwide
country level PCI. While the directional PCI makes reasonable sense conceptually,

understanding its characteristics and applications require further investigation. To facility further
studies, the derived asymmetrical PCI can be downloaded at
https://data.humdata.org/dataset/social-connectedness-index, and be visualized/explored at
http://gis.cas.sc.edu/GeoAnalytics/pci.html.

Appendix B
Computation of US County Level PCI Using 2019 Geotagged Twitter Data
Worldwide geotagged tweets were collected in 2019 using the public Twitter Stream Application
Programming Interface (API). A total of 391,503,203 geotagged tweets from 4,892,458 distinct
Twitter users were extracted within the bounding box covering the contiguous United States.
These tweets are geotagged at different geographic levels. About 80% of tweets are tagged at the
place level, such as a city, neighborhood, and point of interest (POI), and the rest are geotagged
with latitude and longitude. For computing PCI at the county level, we filtered out tweets
geotagged at a geographic level lower than a city (e.g., state level). If a tweet is geotagged at the
place level, the coordinates (latitude and longitude) of the place centroid was used in the
analysis. Following Martin et al. (2020), we filtered out the non-human tweets (e.g., automated
weather reports, job offers, and advertising) by checking the tweet source from which application
a tweet is posted. For example, tweets automatically posted for job offers from the source
TweetMyJOBS and CareerArc are removed. After spatial filtering and non-human filtering, a
total of 316,797,441 tweets remained from 4,609,040 unique Twitter users. The process was
performed using Apache Impala in a Hadoop environment.

After data cleaning, each Twitter user was assigned to a county based on that user’s tweet
location daily. For example, if a user tweeted in three counties on a specific day, then for that
user on that day, three rows were generated. After processing all users, counties, and days in
2019, a big table (CountyUserDate) with three fields (county, user, date) was generated,
including 95,701,425 county-user-date tuples. The daily table was then aggregated along the date
to produce a new table (CountyUserDays) with three fields (county, user, days), where days
indicates the number of days (in 2019) a user was observed in a county, including 11,875,433
county-user-days tuples. Based on the CountyUserDays table, for each county, two numbers
were derived: 1) the number of shared users with other counties and 2) the number of total
observed users in each county. Finally, PCI was computed for each county pair (those with
shared users) using Eq. 1. This process was conducted using Apache Hive coupled with Esri GIS
tools for Hadoop (Esri, 2019).

Appendix C
Computation of the County Person-Day Movements Using 2019 SafeGraph Data
The SafeGraph’s Social Distancing Metrics (SDM) data (SafeGraph, 2020) were downloaded
and loaded to our Hadoop cluster. There were 23 fields in the SDM table, and three were used to
derive the population movement, including origin_census_block_group, destination_cbgs, and
date_range_start. The origin_census_block_group is the unique 12-digit FIPS code for the
Census Block Group. Destination cbgs contains a list of key-value pairs with key indicating the
destination census block group (from the origin census block group) and “value is the number of
devices with a home in census_block_group that stopped in the given destination census block

group for >1 minute during the time period” (https://docs.safegraph.com/docs/social-distancingmetrics). The date_range_start was used to extract the date information.
Based on the three fields, we generated a new table (SgDailyOD) with each row showing
the number of devices from an original block group to a destination block group on a specific
day, resulting in over 6 billion (6,144,802,397) origin-destination flows. Based on the
SgDailyOD table, we further aggregated the flows to the county level for 2019, generating a new
table (SgCountyPersonDayMovement) with each row showing the total number of device
movements between two counties on all days of 2019, resulting in over 6 million county pairs
(6,119,765). Note that the number of movements includes the movements from both directions.
For instance, if there are m number of movements from county A to county B, and n number of
movements from county B to county A, then the number of movements between the two counties
is calculated as m + n. The entire process was conducted in our in-house Hadoop cluster using
Apache Hive and Impala.

Appendix D
Computation of the County Person-Day Movements Using 2019 Geotagged Twitter Data
After data cleaning, each Twitter user was assigned to a county based on that user’s tweet
location daily. For example, if a user tweeted in three counties on a specific day, then for that
user on that day, three rows were generated. After processing all users, counties, and days in
2019, a big table (CountyUserDate) with three fields (county, user, date) was generated,
including 95,701,425 county-user-date tuples. This step was conducted using Apache Hive
coupled with ESRI tools for Hadoop. The person-day movement with geotagged tweets was

calculated by aggregating the CountyUserDate table along the date, generating a new table
(SgCountyPersonDayMovement) with each row showing the total number of user movements
between two counties on all days of 2019, resulting in over 3 million (3,405,113) county pairs.
