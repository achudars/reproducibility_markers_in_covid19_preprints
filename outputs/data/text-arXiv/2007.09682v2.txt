Summary Paragraph: Several high-profile sources1–4 have focused worldwide attention on the
dangers of misinformation about COVID, with the World Health Organization declaring a
COVID-19 social media “infodemic”. Prior work has associated such misinformation with lowcredibility sources that are known to spread conspiracy theories and malicious content.5,6 Here,
we report the results of an analysis of over 500 million social media posts from Twitter and
Facebook between March 8 and May 1, 2020. We find that messages about COVID-19 are more
likely to come from high quality sources, with clearer provenance, when compared to other
health topics. Low-credibility sources were less likely to post about COVID-19, with the
important exception of state-sponsored propaganda outlets on Twitter. Finally, a known
conspiracy theory was more likely to be “laundered” through social media platforms than lowcredibility news sources. In contrast, misinformation reflecting legitimate scientific uncertainty
was primarily discussed by credible news sources. These results suggest that the social media
discourse reflects an attempt to come to grips with deep scientific uncertainty during an
emerging pandemic, with significant content emanating from unrated; not low credibility,
sources. When low-quality content is generated by these unrated sources, they may be amplified
by high-credibility sources inadvertently lending them credibility.

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARSCOV-2 virus, a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Concurrently, the WHO also declared an
“infodemic” – indicating overwhelming amounts of information about COVID-19. A recent joint
statement by the WHO and the United Nations (https://www.who.int/news/item/23-09-2020managing-the-covid-19-infodemic-promoting-healthy-behaviours-and-mitigating-the-harmfrom-misinformation-and-disinformation), and several other high-profile sources1,3,7 have
characterized this infodemic as a “misinfodemic” – a vector for sharing low-quality content –
misinformation, conspiracy theories, scams, geopolitical manipulation2,8–10, and other malicious
activities – all of which could lead to unhealthy behaviors and loss of life. To date, no systematic
evidence has been proffered to support the claim that COVID-19 is more likely to spread
malicious activity than other topics. We therefore seek to characterize the infodemic’s scale and
scope.
We analyzed data from the two largest social media platforms in the USA – Facebook
and Twitter – and examined the volume and quality of URLs shared. Initial estimates of the
prevalence of credible content about COVID-19 vary widely11–14 and have not been compared to
equivalent samples from other time periods, or other topics. Cross-platform comparisons are few
in number14. Thus, our first question is:
(1) Are posts about COVID-19 more likely to contain links to low-credibility sources?
Beyond source credibility, several reports have alleged that state-sponsored actors use the
infodemic to promote narratives advancing their geopolitical interests8–10. Thus, our second
question is:
(2) How did the behavior of different types of low-credibility sources change with the
infodemic?
4

Finally, beyond low-credibility sources, misinformation may be “laundered” through digital
platforms, including social media and even online product reviews. Thus, our third question is:
(3) Which sources most discuss low quality content?
We identified three sets of keywords pertaining to 1) COVID-19, 2) generalized health topics,
and 3) vaccine-preventable illnesses. For each set, we retrieved all available English-language
public posts generated between March 8, 2020 and May 1, 2020 from Twitter, Facebook Pages,
and Facebook Groups. We compared COVID-19 posts to health and vaccine posts generated
during the same dates in 2019, yielding 15 datasets.
For each data set, we identified and, when necessary, unshortened all URLs, extract their toplevel domains. We enumerated the frequency of each top-level domain in each dataset, excluding
share or retweets without other URLs.
We next obtained credibility ratings for each top-level domain using ratings and categories
compiled by the NewsGuard database (https://www.NewsGuard.com/) and the
MediaBiasFactCheck website (https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/). These domains were then
assigned high-level indicators of credibility: “More Credible”, “Less Credible”, and “Not
Credible”. Government (e.g., .gov) and academic (e.g., .edu) websites were also assigned to the
“More Credible” category. We also labeled digital platforms (e.g., YouTube) and satire websites
as such. Finally, we used the Webshrinker Category API (https://docs.webshrinker.com/) to
assign unrated domains into discrete content categories until at least 90% of URLs shared in each
dataset was assigned a label. We compared the proportions of each of these categories across all
15 datasets.

5

For each platform, we identified the top ten sources rated as “Not Credible”. Additionally, we
identified a subset of domains that were associated with state-sponsored news outlets in the
NewsGuard database. Finally, we examined the relative likelihood that a URL from each source
was shared in a post about COVID-19 versus general health and vaccine topics.
We examined two COVID-19 misinformation topics: 1) the conspiracy theory that 5G wireless
technologies cause COVID-19, and 2) the claim that hydroxychloroquine is an effective COVID19 treatment. We selected the 5G topic because it has no basis in scientific fact, and therefore
could be termed a “conspiracy theory”. In contrast, we selected the hydroxychloroquine topic
because it reflects a case of genuine scientific uncertainty during the time period of our study
(March – May, 2020)15–17, when leaders within the scientific community expressed caution, but
no clinical trials had yet been conducted (clinical trials have so far failed to demonstrate
hydroxychloroquine’s efficacy; https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-haltsclinical-trial-hydroxychloroquine)18,19. For each topic, we examined whether URLs were
primarily shared from low-credibility sources.
762,669 unique domains were shared across all fifteen datasets. Of these, 16,614 (2%) domains
were given a rating. Of the remaining domains, 80,539 (11%) were assigned a Webshrinker
category. These 97,153 (13%) categorized domains were shared in the vast majority of posts
containing URLs: within any given dataset, at least 95% of all out-of-platform URLs were to
categorized domains (see Figure 1).
COVID-19 datasets contained more rated URLs. COVID-19 datasets also had higher proportions
of rated out-of-platform URLs than did any other datasets. Thus, posts about COVID-19 had a
clearer provenance than posts from other datasets. On all platforms, COVID-19 posts also
contain the highest proportion of domains from high-quality “More Credible” sources (p<0.001;
6

see Table S1 and Figure 2). Additionally, “More Credible” sources were shared more often than
“Less Credible” and “Not Credible” sources combined in all COVID-19 datasets. Within all
datasets, links to other social media platforms, and “Unknown” sites made up at least 10% of all
domains shared. Links to other social media platforms made up roughly 10-20% of domains
shared on Twitter and in Facebook Groups, but not on Facebook Pages.
We next examined the top ten low-credibility domains and state-sponsored domains making up
at least 0.01% of posts in each dataset. Figure 3 shows a stark contrast between Twitter and
Facebook: Saudi, Iranian, and Chinese outlets were all more than five times as likely to tweet
about COVID-19 than about other health topics, and more than twice as likely to tweet about
COVID-19 than vaccines. One Russian and Qatari source, each, also tweeted more about
COVID-19 than about health or vaccines. In contrast, the top five non-state-sponsored lowcredibility domains were less likely to tweet about COVID-19 than vaccines, with comparable,
or lower, levels of tweets about health. Official state-sponsored amplification was largely absent
on Facebook Groups and was slightly elevated in a single Saudi source on Facebook pages.
We next examined which sources were most likely to discuss hydroxychloroquine and 5G in the
context of COVID-19. Figure 4 shows that rated news sources make up a higher proportion of
posts about hydroxychloroquine. Within these rated sources, there was a smaller proportion of
“More Credible” posts, which nevertheless made up the plurality of rated posts. In contrast, 5G
posts were more likely to be disseminated through unrated sources (p<0.001 in all cases; see
Table S1), including social media platforms, “arts & entertainment” sites (including podcasts
explaining 5G technology, propagating conspiracy theories, or debunking these conspiracy
theories) and “unknown” domains.

7

Contrary to expectations, across all platforms, COVID-19 datasets contained more
credible content than comparator datasets. Additionally, we find that the COVID-19 datasets
contain among the smallest proportions of non-credible sources. Non-credible sources that
usually spread conspiracy theories made up a smaller proportion of COVID-19 posts about other
health topics. Rather than propagating malicious content, our results suggest that the “infodemic”
is an expression of deep scientific uncertainty, with credible sources disseminating most rated
content. This is especially reflected in the breakdown of sources pertaining to
hydroxychloroquine.
An exception seems to exist for Twitter activity sharing Chinese, Iranian, Russian, Qatari,
and Saudi state-sponsored media, all of which were more likely to discuss COVID-19 than other
health concerns. Clearly, COVID-19 was of more importance to these governments than were
other health topics. Notably, these findings did not replicate in Facebook pages or groups,
suggesting that Twitter’s structure as a broadcast medium makes it uniquely susceptible to this
particular type of information propagation. Given previous work demonstrating how states can
weaponize health information20,21, these finding should be deeply concerning. Additionally, we
cannot rule out different types of manipulation on other platforms. However, our findings do
indicate that these specific state-sponsored sources are far exceeded in volume by content from
More Credible sources.
Roughly half of all content from each of our datasets came from websites that could not
be rated. This was especially the case for messages pertaining to 5G. These unrated data
primarily contained links to user-generated content (e.g., social media and podcasts).
Additionally, “Unknown” and “Uncategorized” sites were especially prevalent reflecting
inability to assess content credibility based solely on source. For example, the “Unknown”
8

category contains both unrated news sources (e.g., abc7.com, newsfilter.io), and self-published
content, (e.g., onlyfans.com). Finally, the “News / Weather / Information” category contained
several international, and especially African, news sources, perhaps reflecting an emphasis
towards familiar media markets in credibility ratings. These results highlight the diversity of
online content, with many sources that have not been, and perhaps cannot be, validated.
Nevertheless, they play an important role in the “infodemic”.
Our study highlights that credible sources do not necessarily indicate credible content,
and vice versa. Especially during a pandemic, where what is truthful is highly uncertain,
misinformation may spread through credible channels, such as when credible sources attempt to
debunk, fact-check, or otherwise validate misinformation, inadvertently driving attention to it 22.
Our results demonstrate that the information environment cannot be characterized by simple
“false” vs. “true” dichotomy of online content, calling into question the ability of fact-checking
efforts to scale. Those characterizing the infodemic by low credibility or malicious content may
be missing the larger body of misinformation that is credible yet subject to deep scientific
uncertainty, factually mixed, or even true, yet out of context. In a pandemic, where there is
genuine and deep uncertainty about what is true, looking to whether the source is credible may
be a false signal of misinformative content. Furthermore, we find that most content is unrated
and perhaps even can't be rated. Worse, high credibility sources may be “hacked” when they
report on misinformation and disinformation, inadvertently amplifying the false and misleading
claims of conspiracy theorists 22.
The widespread use of digital platforms disseminating user-generated content means that
fact-checkers cannot be deployed at the scale required to provide credibility assessments for all
content. Furthermore, there is no legitimate expectation that user-generated content is subject to
9

the same fact-checking standards as journalistic, government, or academic sources.
Nevertheless, this content is overwhelming in scope and varied in style, making it difficult for
users to distinguish between fact, opinion, misinformation, and satire.
It is precisely when society faces this deep uncertainty that misinformation becomes
plausible, possibly moving from the fringes (e.g., state-sponsored propaganda and conspiracist
sites) into the mainstream 23. Under these circumstances, efforts to fact-check or otherwise
promote “mythbusters” may be missing the larger point that there is a need to communicate the
fundamental gist of uncertainty as information about the virus changes from day-to-day, and to
manage expectations by preparing the public that information will change as we learn more. Our
research therefore points to the urgent need for interdisciplinary collaboration between
computational scientists, and health, social, and communication scholars, to solve the problem of
providing informed, contextualized human insights to the public at Internet scale during a
pandemic.

Methods
Measuring Volume of Information
We collected three groups of five datasets from two social media platforms.
1. The first group was collected from Twitter
a. Using the Social Feed Manager software,24 we collected English-language tweets
from the Twitter API's statuses/filter streaming endpoint
(https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/filter-realtime/api-reference/poststatuses-filter) matching keywords of “#Coronavirus”, “#CoronaOutbreak”, and
“#COVID19” posted between March 8, 2020 and May 1, 2020.25
b. Using the Twitter Streaming API, we collected English-language tweets
containing keywordsi pertaining to generalized health topics (the “health
stream”26) posted between March 8, 2020 and May 1, 2020, and March 8, 2019
and May 1, 2019
c. Using the Twitter Streaming API, we collected English-language tweets
containing keywordsii pertaining to vaccine-preventable illnesses (the “vaccine
stream”27) posted between March 8, 2020 and May 1, 2020, and March 8, 2019
and May 1, 2019
The second and third groups of datasets were collected from Facebook, using CrowdTangle, a
Facebook-owned tool that tracks interactions on public content from Facebook pages and groups,
verified profiles, Instagram accounts, and subreddits.28 It does not include paid ads unless those
ads began as organic, non-paid posts that were subsequently “boosted” using Facebook’s
advertising tools. It also does not include activity on private accounts, or posts made visible only

19

to specific groups of followers. All Facebook data were downloaded from CrowdTangle on July
23, 2020.
2. English-language posts from Facebook Pagesiii matching keywords of:
a. “coronavirus”, “coronaoutbreak”, and “covid19” posted between March 8, 2020
and May 1, 2020
b. the same health-related keywords used in the health stream posted between March
8, 2020 and May 1, 2020, and between March 8, 2019 and May 1, 2019
c. the same vaccine-related keywords used in the vaccine stream posted between
March 8, 2020 and May 1, 2020, and between March 8, 2019 and May 1, 2019
3. English-language posts from Facebook Groupsiv matching the same keywords used to
collect data from Facebook pages.
There was some overlap between datasets – especially in 2019 – due, in part, to the inclusion of
the keyword “vaccine” in both the health and vaccine streams. However, for 2020, at least
roughly 2/3 of each dataset was distinct (see Figure S1).
Extracting Posts Relevant to 5G and Hydroxychloroquine
For each COVID-19 dataset (Twitter, Facebook Pages, and Facebook Groups), we identified
every post containing the terms “5G” (for the 5G subsets), or “hydroxy”, “hydroxychloroquine”
“chloroquine”, “azithromycin”, or “hcq” (for the hydroxychloroquine subsets).
Measuring Source Credibility
For each data set, we identified all posts containing a URL, and extracted these URLs.
Specifically, we used the “tldextract” Python module29 to identify the top-level domain for each
link. Next, we identified URLs that had been shortened (e.g. "bit.ly/x11234b") by examining

20

whether their top-level domains were present on a list of commonly-used URL shorteners that
we compiled from several online sources.v We unshortened these links using the Python
“requests” module30 and then identified the top-level domain for each unshortened link. Next, we
enumerated the frequency of each top-level domain in each dataset.
We obtained credibility ratings for each domain using data compiled on July 5, 2020 by two
independent sources:
1.

Ratings from the NewsGuard database, licensed from NewsGuard. NewsGuard provides
“detailed ratings of more than 4,500 news websites that account for 95% of online
engagement with news.” (https://www.NewsGuard.com/) For each website in its
database, NewsGuard provides a composite rating from 0-100, constituting a sum across
nine separate journalistic standards.

2. Ratings from the MediaBiasFactCheck website (https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/).
MediaBiasFactCheck rates several domains according to their factual accuracy into six
categories: “Very Low”, “Low”, “Mixed”, “Mostly Factual”, “High”, and “Very High”.
We found that 950 domains across all datasets were assigned ratings by both NewsGuard and
MediaBiasFactCheck. Treating MediaBiasFactCheck factual accuracy ratings as a six-point
Likert scale with increments of 20 (0="Very Low" to 100 = "Very High"), we found that
NewsGuard and MediaBiasFactCheck scores were strongly correlated, r(948)=0.81, p<0.001.
Following true score theory (28), this high correlation indicates that NewsGuard and
MediaBiasFactCheck scores measure the same underlying construct – source credibility.
Our procedure for rating domains, implemented in R, was as follows:
1. For each domain that was rated by both sites, we averaged these ratings (n=950 domains).

21

2. We coded as “government” all remaining unscored domains ending in .gov, .gc.ca, .mil,
.nhs.uk, starting with gov., mygov., government., containing .govt. or .gov., or matching
who.int, paho.org, un.org, canada.ca, ontario.ca, toronto.ca, or alberta.ca (n=6,900
domains).
3. We coded as "academic" all unscored domains ending in .edu, containing .edu., .ac.,
thelancet.com, sciencedirect.com., medrxiv.org, pnas.org, apa.org, nature.com,
sciencemag.org, nejm.org, bmj.com, mayoclinic.org, aaas.org, healthdata.org,
researchgate.net, or rand.org (n=5,102 domains).
4. NewsGuard coded several domains, including social media platforms such as reddit.com,
and news aggregators such as eurekalert.com and medium.com, as “Platforms”. To this
list, we added blogspot.com, facebook.com, instagram.com, linkedin.com, t.me,
tiktok.com, twitter.com, t.co, and whatsapp.com. Any unscored domains on this list were
coded as “Platforms” in our analysis (n=29 domains).
5. Among the remaining domains, several (n=3,598 domains) were given a numerical rating
by either MediaBiasFactCheck or NewsGuard, but not both. In this case, we retained this
single numerical rating.
6. Among the remaining unscored domains, several were categorized by either
MediaBiasFactCheck or NewsGuard as “Satire” (n=30 domains), or by
MediaBiasFactCheck as “Questionable” (indicating propaganda or fake news; n=5
domains). We retained these categories if no other numerical ratings were available.
Although NewsGuard rates all sites with a score below 60/100 as “untrustworthy”, sites in the
middle third tended to contain sources that were perceived as biased by MediaBiasFactCheck,
including cnn.com (rated as liberal bias), foxnews.com (rated as conservative bias) and several
22

state-sponsored domains (e.g., aljazeera.com, or xinhuanet.com), whereas those in the bottom
third tended to propagate explicit conspiracy theories (e.g., zerohedge.com, rt.com). Thus, scores
were assigned into high-level indicators of credibility, with academic, government, and scaled
news credibility scores exceeding 2/3 labeled as “More Credible”; scaled news credibility scores
between 1/3 and 2/3 labeled as “Less Credible”, and scaled news credibility scores less than 1/3,
and “Questionable” MediaBiasFactCheck scores (but no NewsGuard scores) labeled as “Not
Credible”.
Categories that were not assigned to these three high-level groups, including platforms, satire
sites, and all remaining domains, were labeled as “unrated”.
We next used the Webshrinker Category API (http://docs.webshrinker.com) to assign the most
popular of these remaining domains into discrete content categories and, where available,
subcategories. Due to the highly skewed distribution of domains that were shared, we scored the
domains containing the top 90% of all unrated domains shared in each group of datasets (Twitter,
Facebook Pages, and Facebook Groups). We compared proportions of these categories across
each of our datasets.
Measuring State-Sponsored News Sources
Using the NewsGuard database, we identified a subset of domains that were associated with
state-sponsored news outlets. Specifically, we examined domains whose “Owner” or “Type of
Owner” categories contained the word “government” (or its equivalent in another language, such
as the French “gouvernement”), or which were otherwise marked as state-owned. We excluded
domains that fell into the “government” category outlined above (e.g., nih.gov), and were
therefore explicitly identifiable as a government agency (e.g., a public health agency), rather than
news, source. For each remaining domain, we identified its sponsoring nation and extracted the

23

frequency with which that domain was shared within each dataset and platform. Finally, we
calculated the increased likelihood with which that domain posted about COVID-19 compared to
general health and vaccine posts, as follows:
𝑂𝑅 ! =
"

𝑓#," × ∑%" 𝑓!,"
𝑓!," × ∑%" 𝑓#,"

where i indexes either the health or vaccine datasets, -d indicates all domains except domain d, C
denotes the COVID datasets, d is a top-level domain, and 𝑓!," is the frequency of domain d in
dataset i.
