Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has influenced virtually all aspects of our
lives. Across the world, countries have applied various mitigation strategies, based on social, political, and technological instruments. We postulate that multi-agent systems can provide a common platform to study
(and balance) their essential properties. We also show how to obtain a
comprehensive list of the properties by “distilling” them from media snippets. Finally, we present a preliminary take on their formal specification,
using ideas from multi-agent logics.

Introduction

COVID-19 has inﬂuenced virtually all aspects of our lives. Across the world,
countries applied wildly varying mitigation strategies for the epidemic, ranging
from minimal intrusion in the hope of obtaining “herd immunity”, to imposing
severe lockdowns on the other extreme. It seems clear at the ﬁrst glance what all
those measures are trying to achieve, and what the criteria of success are. But
is it really that clear? Quoting an oft-repeated phrase, with COVID-19 we ﬁght
an unprecedented threat to health and economic stability [Soltani et al., 2020].
While ﬁghting it, we must protect privacy, equality and fairness [Morley et al.,
2020] and do a coordinated assessment of usefulness, effectiveness, technological
readiness, cyber security risks and threats to fundamental freedoms and human
rights [Stollmeyer et al., 2020]. Taken together, this is hardly a straightforward
set of goals and requirements. Thus, paraphrasing [Stollmeyer et al., 2020], one
may ask:
What problem does a COVID mitigation strategy solve exactly?
1

Even a quick survey of news articles, manifestos, and research papers published since the beginning of the pandemic reveals a diverse landscape of postulates and opinions. Some authors focus on medical goals, some on technological requirements; others are concerned by the economic, social, or political
impact of a containment strategy. The actual stance is often related to the
background of the author (in case of a researcher) or their information sources
(in case of a journalist). Moreover, the authors advocating a particular aspect
of the strategy most often neglect all the other aspects. We propose that the
ﬁeld of multi-agent systems can oﬀer a common platform to study all the relevant properties, due to its interdisciplinary nature [Weiss, 1999, Wooldridge,
2002, Shoham and Leyton-Brown, 2009], well developed theories of heterogeneous agency [Bratman, 1987, Cohen and Levesque, 1990, Rao and Georgeﬀ,
1991, Wooldridge, 2000, Broersen et al., 2001], and a wealth of formal methods
for speciﬁcation and veriﬁcation [Dastani et al., 2010, Shoham and Leyton-Brown,
2009, Jamroga, 2015].
This still leaves the question of how to gather the actual goals and requirements for a COVID-19 mitigation strategy. One way to achieve it is to look
at what is considered relevant by the general public, and referred to in the
media. To this end, we collected a number of news quotes on the topic, ordered them thematically and with respect to the type of concern, and presented
in [Jamroga et al., 2020]. Here, we take the news clips from [Jamroga et al.,
2020], and distill a comprehensive list of goals, requirements, and most relevant
risk. The list is presented in Section 2. In Section 3, we make the ﬁrst step
towards a formalization of the properties by formulas of multi-agent logics. We
conclude in Section 4.
Besides potential input to the design of anti-COVID-19 strategies, the main
contribution of this paper is methodological: we demonstrate how to obtain a
comprehensive and relatively unbiased speciﬁcation of properties for complex
MAS by searching for hints in the public space.

Extracting Goals and Requirements from News
Clips

Speciﬁcation of properties is probably the most neglected part of formal veriﬁcation for MAS. The research on formal veriﬁcation usually concentrates on
deﬁning the decision problem, establishing its theoretical properties, and designing algorithms that solve the problem at an abstract level Dastani et al. [2010].
Fortunately, the algorithms are more and more often implemented in the form
of a publicly available model-checker [Alur et al., 2000, Lomuscio et al., 2017,
Behrmann et al., 2004, Kant et al., 2015, Kurpiewski et al., 2019]. The tools
come with examples of how to model the behavior of a system, but writing
the input formulas is generally considered easy. The big question, however, is:
Where do the formulas come from? In a realistic multi-agent scenario, it is not
clear at all.

2

Mitigating COVID-19 illustrates the point well. Research on mitigation
measures is typically characterized by: (a) strong focus on the native domain
of the authors, and (b) focus on the details, rather than the general picture.
In order to avoid “overlooking the forest for the trees,” we came up with a
diﬀerent methodology. We looked for relevant phrases that appeared in the
media, with no particular method of source selection [Jamroga et al., 2020].
Then, we extracted the properties, and whenever possible generalized statements
on speciﬁc measures to the mitigation strategy in general. Finally, we sorted
them thematically, and divided into 3 categories: goals, additional requirements,
and potential risks and threats.
While most of the collected snippets focus on digital contact tracing, the
relevance of the requirements goes clearly beyond that, and applies to all the
aspects of this epidemic, as well as the ones that may happen in the future.

2.1

Epidemiological and Health-Related Concerns

COVID-19 is ﬁrst and foremost a threat to people’s health and lives. Accordingly, we begin with requirements related to this aspect of mitigation strategies.
2.1.1

Epidemiological Goals

The goal of the mitigation strategy in general, and digital measures in particular,
is to:
(i) provide an epidemic response [Soltani et al., 2020]
(ii) bring the pandemic under control [Morley et al., 2020]
(iii) slow the spread of the virus [Woodhams, 2020, NCS, 2020, Soltani et al.,
2020, Bicheno, 2020, hel, 2020, Ilves, 2020]
(iv) prevent deaths [AFP, 2020]
(v) reduce the reproduction rate of the virus, i.e., how many people are infected
by someone with the virus [AFP, 2020].
The speciﬁc goals of digital measures are to:
(i) trace the spread of the virus and identify dangerous Covid-19 clusters [Ilves,
2020]
(ii) find potential new infections [Timberg, 2020]
(iii) register contacts between potential carriers and those who might be infected [Ilves, 2020]
(iv) deter people from breaking quarantine [Clarance, 2020]
Requirements:
(1) The eﬀorts must meet public health needs best [Soltani et al., 2020, Ilves,
2020].

3

(2) Digital measures should be a component of the epidemic response [Soltani et al.,
2020], and enhance traditional forms of contact tracing [Timberg, 2020]
(3) They should be designed to help the health authorities [hel, 2020].
2.1.2

Effectiveness of Epidemic Response

Requirements:
(1) The strategy should be effective [Soltani et al., 2020, Stollmeyer et al.,
2020]
(2) It should make a difference [Burgess, 2020].
Risks and threats:
(a) Inaccurate detection of carriers and infected people due to the limitations
of the technology and the underlying model of human interaction [Soltani et al.,
2020]
(b) Speciﬁcally, this may adversely impact relaxation of lockdowns [Woodhams,
2020]
(c) Misguided assurance that going out is safe [Soltani et al., 2020].
2.1.3

Information Flow to Counter the Epidemic

The strategy should support rapid identiﬁcation and notiﬁcation of the most
concerned. That is, it should allow:
(1) to identify people who might have been exposed to the virus [Zastrow, 2020]
(2) to alert those people [Morley et al., 2020, hel, 2020, Timberg, 2020, POL,
2020].
(3) The identiﬁcation and notiﬁcation must be rapid [Zastrow, 2020, Morley et al.,
2020].
2.1.4

Monitoring Pandemic and Containment Strategy

The containment strategy should enable:
(1) monitoring the state of the pandemic, e.g., the outbreaks and the spread
of the virus [POL, 2020, Frasier, 2020]
(2) monitoring the behavior of people, in particular if they are following the
rules [Scott and Wanat, 2020]
(3) to monitor the effectiveness of the strategy [Davies, 2020].

4

2.1.5

Tradeoffs

There are tradeoffs between eﬀective containment of the epidemic and other
concerns, such as privacy and protection of fundamental freedoms [McCarthy,
2020, Clarance, 2020, POL, 2020, Ilves, 2020]. E.g., eﬀective monitoring is often
at odds with privacy [Davies, 2020]. The strategy should
(1) strike the right balance between diﬀerent concerns [Ilves, 2020].
We will see more tradeoﬀ-related requirements in the subsequent sections.

2.2

Economic and Social Impact

Most measures to contain the epidemic are predominantly social (cf. lockdown),
and have strong social and economic impact.
2.2.1

Economic Stability

The containment strategy should:
(1) minimize the cost to local economies and the negative impact on economic
growth [Soltani et al., 2020, AFP, 2020]
(2) allow for return to normal economy and society and make resumption of
economic and social activities safer [Timberg, 2020, Taylor, 2020].
2.2.2

Social and Political Impact

The containment strategy (and digital measures in particular) should:
(1) ease lockdowns and home confinement [Soltani et al., 2020, Stollmeyer et al.,
2020, Zastrow, 2020, Taylor, 2020]
(2) minimize adverse impact on social relationships and personal well-being [Soltani et al.,
2020]
(3) prohibit economic and social discrimination on the basis of information
and technology being part of the strategy [Soltani et al., 2020]
(4) protect the communities that can be harmed by the collection and exploitation of personal data [Soltani et al., 2020].
Detailed requirements:
(1) Surveillance technologies should not become compulsory for public and social engagements, with unaﬀected individuals restricted from participating
in social and economic activities [Soltani et al., 2020].
Risks and threats:
(a) Little knowledge about social impact of the measures [O’Neill et al., 2020]

5

(b) Discrimination and creation of social divides [Soltani et al., 2020, Mat,
2020]
(c) Disinformation and information abuse [Soltani et al., 2020, Woodhams,
2020]
(d) Providing a false sense of security [Soltani et al., 2020]
(e) Political manipulation, creating social unrest, and dishonest competition
by false reports of coronavirus [Soltani et al., 2020]
(f) Too much political inﬂuence of IT companies on the decisions of sovereign
democratic countries [Ilves, 2020].
2.2.3

Costs, Human Resources, Logistics

Requirements:
(1) The financial cost of the measures should be minimized [Hern, 2020]
(2) Minimization of the involved human resources [Scott and Wanat, 2020,
Soltani et al., 2020]
(3) Timeliness [Hern, 2020]
(4) Coordination between diﬀerent institutions and authorities[Tahir and Lima,
2020, Eur, 2020], including the establishment of common standards [Tahir and Lima,
2020].

2.3

Ethical and Legal Aspects

In this section, we look at requirements that aim at the long-term robustness
and resilience of the social structure.
2.3.1

Ethical and Legal Requirements

(1) The mitigation strategy must be ethically justifiable [Morley et al., 2020]
(2) The measures should be necessary, proportionate, legitimate, just, scientifically valid, and time-bound [Morley et al., 2020, Woodhams, 2020, Oslo,
2020, Scott and Wanat, 2020, Mat, 2020]
(3) They should not be invasive [Clarance, 2020] and must not be done at the
expense of individual civil rights [Bicheno, 2020, O’Neill et al., 2020, Mat,
2020]
(4) Means of protection should be available to anyone [Morley et al., 2020]
(5) They should be voluntary [O’Neill et al., 2020, NCS, 2020]
(6) The measures must comply with legal regulations [Mat, 2020, McCarthy,
2020, Wodinsky, 2020]
(7) Implementation and impact must also be considered [Morley et al., 2020,
Woodhams, 2020]
6

(8) Impact assessment should be conducted and made public [Mat, 2020].

2.3.2

Risks and Threats

(a) Serious and long-lasting harms to fundamental rights and freedoms [Morley et al.,
2020]
(b) Costs of not devoting resources to something else [Morley et al., 2020]
(c) Measures designed and implemented without adequate scrutiny [Woodhams,
2020]
(d) Measures that support extensive physical surveillance [Woodhams, 2020]
(e) Mandatory use of digital measures, collecting sensitive information, sharing the data with the government [Clarance, 2020, Zastrow, 2020]
(f) Censorship practices to silence critics and control the ﬂow of information [Woodhams, 2020].

2.4

Privacy and Data Protection

Privacy-related issues for COVID-19 mitigation strategies have triggered heated
discussion, and at some point gained much media coverage. This is understandable, since privacy and data protection is an important aspect of medical
information ﬂow, even in ordinary times. Moreover, the IT measures against
COVID-19 are usually designed by computer scientists and specialists, for whom
security requirements are relatively easy to identify and understand.
2.4.1

General Privacy Requirements

(1) The strategy should be designed with privacy and information security in
mind [Soltani et al., 2020, Timberg, 2020, O’Neill et al., 2020]
(2) It should mitigate privacy concerns inherent in a technological approach [Soltani et al.,
2020]
(3) It should be anonymous under data protection laws, i.e., it cannot lead to
the identification of an individual [Burgess, 2020]
(4) The information about users should be protected at all times [NCS, 2020]
(5) The design should include recommendations for how back-end systems
should be secured, and identify vulnerabilities as well as unintended consequences [Soltani et al., 2020].
Risks and Threats:
(a) Lack of clear privacy policies [Woodhams, 2020, Eisenberg, 2020, O’Neill et al.,
2020]

7

(b) Exploitation of personal information by authorities or third parties [Eisenberg,
2020, Woodhams, 2020, Garthwaite and Anderson, 2020], in particular live
or near-live tracking of users’ locations and linking sensitive personal information to an individual [Garthwaite and Anderson, 2020]
(c) Linking different datasets at some point in the future [Wodinsky, 2020]
(d) Alerts can be too revealing [BBC, 2020]
(e) It may be possible to work out who is associating with whom [McCarthy,
2020].
2.4.2

Data Protection and Potential Misuse of Data

Here, the key question is: What data is collected and who is it shared with? [O’Neill et al.,
2020, Soltani et al., 2020] This leads to the following requirements:
(1) Clear and reasonable limits on the data collection types [Tahir and Lima,
2020, Clarance, 2020, NCS, 2020, Soltani et al., 2020, Timberg, 2020]
(2) Limitations on how the data is used [O’Neill et al., 2020]
(3) In particular, the data is to be used strictly for disease control and not
shared with law enforcement agencies [Clarance, 2020, Taylor, 2020]
(4) Less state access and control over user data [Bicheno, 2020]
(5) Data collection should be minimized [O’Neill et al., 2020] and based on
informed consent of the participants [Ilves, 2020]
(6) Giving access to one’s data should be voluntary [O’Neill et al., 2020]
(7) One should be able to delete their personal information at any time [hel,
2020, McCarthy, 2020]
(8) One should have the right to access their own data [hel, 2020, McCarthy,
2020]
(9) For digital measures, the user should be able to remove the software and
disable more invasive features [hel, 2020].
Risks and threats:
(a) Data storage that can be hacked and exploited [Davies, 2020, Zastrow,
2020, Woodhams, 2020]
(b) Data breaches due to insider threats [Eisenberg, 2020]
(c) Function creep and state surveillance [Zastrow, 2020]
(d) Sharing data across agencies or selling to a third party [Eisenberg, 2020,
Woodhams, 2020]
(e) Integration with commercial services [Woodhams, 2020].

8

2.4.3

Sunsetting, Safeguards, and Monitoring

Requirements:
(1) Sunsetting: the measures should be terminated as soon as possible [Scott and Wanat,
2020, Soltani et al., 2020, hel, 2020]
(2) Data should be eventually or even periodically destroyed [Scott and Wanat,
2020, O’Neill et al., 2020, hel, 2020, McCarthy, 2020, Soltani et al., 2020,
Timberg, 2020], in particular when it is no longer needed to help manage
the spread of coronavirus [NCS, 2020]
(3) Transparency of data collection [O’Neill et al., 2020]
(4) There should be clear policies to prevent abuse [O’Neill et al., 2020]
(5) Privacy must be backed up with clear lines of accountability and processes
for evaluation and monitoring [Wodinsky, 2020]
(6) Judicial oversight must be provided [Soltani et al., 2020]
(7) Safeguards should be backed by an independent figure [Scott and Wanat,
2020].
Risks and threats:
(a) Surveillance might continue to be used after the threat of the coronavirus
recedes [Garthwaite and Anderson, 2020]
(b) Data can stay with the government longer than necessary [Scott and Wanat,
2020].
2.4.4

Impact of Privacy

Requirements:
(1) People must get the information they need to protect themselves and others [BBC, 2020]
(2) There must be protections against economic and social discrimination
based on information and technology designed to ﬁght the pandemic, in
particular with respect to communities vulnerable to collection and exploitation of personal data [Soltani et al., 2020]
(3) Information should be used in such a way that people who fear being
judged will not put other people in danger [BBC, 2020].
Risks and threats:
(a) Fear of social stigma [BBC, 2020]
(b) Online judgement and ridicule [BBC, 2020].

9

2.4.5

Privacy vs. Epidemiological Efficiency

There is a tradeoﬀ between protecting privacy vs. collecting and processing all
the information that can be useful in ﬁghting the epidemic:
• Privacy hinders making the best possible use of the data, including analysis of the population, contact matching, modeling the network of contacts, enabling epidemiological insights such as revealing clusters and superspreaders, and providing advice to people [McCarthy, 2020, Zastrow,
2020, Taylor, 2020]
• Privacy-preserving solutions put users in more control of their information
and require no intervention from a third party [McCarthy, 2020].
The relationship is not simply antagonistic, though:
• Privacy is instrumental in building trust. Conversely, lack of privacy undermines trust, and may hinder the epidemiological, economic, and social
effects of the mitigation activities [Eisenberg, 2020].
2.4.6

Reasonable Privacy

While it might be necessary to waive users’ privacy in the short term in order
to contain the epidemic, one must look for mechanisms such that
(1) exploiting the risks would require significant effort by the attackers for
minimal reward [Zastrow, 2020].

2.5

User-Related Aspects

The measures must be adopted and followed by the people, in order to make
them eﬀective.
2.5.1

User Incentives

Goals:
(i) High acceptance rate for the mitigation measures [Timberg, 2020].
(ii) Creating incentives and overcoming incentive problems for individual people to adopt the strategy [Soltani et al., 2020]
Risks and threats:
(a) Lack of immediate benefits for the participants [Soltani et al., 2020]
(b) Perceived privacy and security risks [Timberg, 2020]
(c) Some measures can divert attention from more important measures, and
make people less alert [Szymielewicz et al., 2020]
(d) Creating false sense of security from the pandemic [Frasier, 2020].
10

Countermeasures:
(a) Pointing out indirect benefits (e.g., opening of the schools and businesses,
reviving the national economy) [Soltani et al., 2020]
(b) Reliance on personal responsibility [Stollmeyer et al., 2020].
2.5.2

Adoption and Its Impact

Requirements:
(1) Enough people should download and use the app to make it effective [Timberg,
2020, O’Neill et al., 2020, Zastrow, 2020, Bezat, 2020]. Note: this requirement is graded rather than binary O’Neill [2020], Hinch et al. [2020].
Risks and threats:
(a) Lack of users’ trust [Burgess, 2020, Eisenberg, 2020], see also the connection between privacy and trust in Section 2.4.5
(b) Lack of social knowledge and empathy by the authorities [POL, 2020].

2.6

Technological Aspects

General requirements:
(1) The concrete measures and tools must be operational [McCarthy, 2020,
Scott and Wanat, 2020]
(2) In particular, they should be compatible with their environment of implementation [Wodinsky, 2020]
(3) Design and implementation should be transparent [O’Neill et al., 2020,
SDZ, 2020].
Speciﬁc requirements for digital measures:
(1) They should be compatible with most available devices [Wodinsky, 2020]
(2) Reasonable use of battery [Wodinsky, 2020]
(3) Usable interface [Wodinsky, 2020]
(4) Accurate measurements of how close two devices are [Zastrow, 2020]
(5) Cross-border interoperability [Cyb, 2020]
(6) Possibility to verify the code by the public and experts [SDZ, 2020].

11

2.7

Evaluation and Learning for the Future

COVID-19 mitigation activities should be rigorously assessed. Moreover, their
outcomes should be used to extend our knowledge about the pandemic, and
better defend ourselves in the future. The main goal here is:
(i) to use the collected data in order to develop efficient infection control
measures and gain insight into the effect of changes to the measures for
fighting the virus [hel, 2020, McCarthy, 2020].
Requirements:
(1) A review and exit strategy should be deﬁned [Morley et al., 2020]
(2) Before implementing the measures, an institutional assessment is needed
of their usefulness, effectiveness, technological readiness, cyber-security
risks and threats to fundamental freedoms and human rights [Stollmeyer et al.,
2020]
(3) After the pandemic, there must be the society’s assessment whether the
strategy has been eﬀective and appropriate [BBC, 2020]
(4) The assessments should be conducted by an independent body at regular
intervals [Morley et al., 2020].

3

Towards Formal Specification

Here, we brieﬂy show how the requirements presented in Section 2 can be rewritten in a more formal way. To this end, we use modal logics for distributed
and multi-agent systems that have been in constant development for over 40
years [Emerson, 1990, Fagin et al., 1995, Wooldridge, 2000, Broersen et al., 2001,
Alur et al., 2002, Bulling et al., 2015]. Note that the following speciﬁcations are
only semi-formal, as we do not ﬁx the models nor give the precise semantics of
the logical operators and atomic predicates. We leave that step for the future
work.

3.1

Temporal and Epistemic Properties

The simplest kind of requirements are those that refer to achievement or maintenance of a particular state of aﬀairs. Typically, they can be expressed by
formulas of the branching-time logic CTL⋆ [Emerson, 1990], with path quantiﬁers E (there is a path), A (for all paths), and temporal operators X (in the
next moment ), F (sometime from now on), G (always from now on), and U
(until ). For example, goal (ii) in Section 2.1 can be tentatively rewritten as the
CTL⋆ formula
AF control-pandemic,

12

saying that, for all possible execution paths, control-pandemic must eventually hold.1 Similarly, goal (iii) can be expressed by formula ∀n . (R0=n) →
AF (R0<n). It is easy to see that the latter requirement is more precise than
the former. Moreover, goal (iv) can be captured by AG (#deaths<k), for a
reasonably chosen k.
The identiﬁcation and monitoring aspects can be expressed by a combination
of CTL⋆ with epistemic operators Ka ϕ (“a knows that ϕ”). For example, the information ﬂow requirement (1) in Section 2.1.3 can be transcribed as exposedi →
AF Ka exposedi , where a is the name of the agent (or authority) supposed to identify the vulnerable people. A more faithful transcription can be obtained using
the past-time operator F −1 (sometime in the past) [Laroussinie and Schnoebelen,
1995] with
expi → AF Ka expi ,

where expi ≡ F −1 exposedi ,

saying that if exposedi held at some point in the past, then a will eventually
know about it. Likewise, the information ﬂow requirement (2) can be captured by Ka expi → AF Ki expi . Similar temporal-epistemic formulas may be
used to express some privacy-related requirements in Section 2.4, e.g., ∀j 6=
i . AG (¬Kj (x = i) ∧ ¬Kj (x 6= i)) tentatively captures the anonymity of person
i wrt. the database entry represented by x, cf. requirement 2.4.1.(3).

3.2

Strategic Requirements

The temporal and epistemic patterns, presented above, can be reﬁned by replacing path quantiﬁers A, E with strategic operators hhAii of the logic ATL∗ [Alur et al.,
2002, Bulling et al., 2015], where hhAiiϕ says that “the agents in A can bring
about ϕ”. For example, the information ﬂow requirement 2.1.3.(2) can be rewritten as
Ka (F −1 exposedi ) → hhaiiF hhiiiF Ki (F −1 exposedi ),
saying that if the health authority a knows that i was exposed, then a can provide i with the information suﬃcient to realize that. Strategic operators are also
useful for the monitoring requirements in Section 2.1.4, e.g., hhaiiG (Ka outbreak∨
Ka ¬outbreak) can be used for requirement 2.1.4.(1). The same applies to the
access control properties in Section 2.4.2, e.g., requirement (6) can be formalized
by formula ∀d ∈ data(i) ∀j 6= i . hhiiiF access(j,d) ∧ hhiiiG ¬access(j,d).
For some requirements, this should be combined with bounds imposed on
the execution time [Penczek and Polrola, 2006, Knapik et al., 2019], mental
complexity [Jamroga et al., 2019], and/or resources needed to accomplish the
tasks [Alechina et al., 2010, Bulling and Farwer, 2010, Alechina et al., 2017].
For example, the notiﬁcation requirement 2.1.3.(2) can be reﬁned as:
hhaiiF t≤10 hhiiicompl≤5 F Ki (F −1 exposedi ),
1 In fact, a better specification is given by AF G control-pandemic, saying that the pandemic
is not only brought, but also kept under control from some point on.

13

based on the assumption that a should notify i in at most 10 time units, and i
has a strategy of complexity at most 5 to infer the relevant knowledge from the
notiﬁcation.
To reason explicitly about the outcome of anti-COVID-19 measures, we may
need model update operators (supp a : σ) saying “suppose that agent a plays
strategy σ” [Bulling et al., 2008], and similar to strategy binding in Strategy
Logic [Mogavero et al., 2010] and ATL with Strategy Contexts [Brihaye et al.,
2009]. Then, the eﬀectiveness requirement (2) of Section 2.1.2 for mitigation
strategy S can be written as
¬ψ ∧ (supp a : S)ψ,
where ψ can be any of the properties of epidemic response, formalized in Section 3.1.

3.3

Probabilistic Extensions

Many events have probabilistic execution, e.g., actions may fail with some
(typically small) probability. Scenarios with probabilistic events can be modeled by variants of Markov decision processes, and their properties can be
speciﬁed by a probabilistic variant of CTL⋆ [Baier and Kwiatkowska, 1998] or
ATL∗ [Chen et al., 2013]. For instance, formula
hhaiiP ≥0.99 F t≤10 hhiiicompl≤5 F Ki (F −1 exposedi ),
reﬁnes the previous speciﬁcation by demanding that the authority can successfully notify i with probability at least 99%.

3.4

Meta-Properties

The requirements presented in Section 2, and formalized above, refer to the
“correctness” of a given mitigation strategy. Two meta-properties, well known
in computer science, can be also useful in case of the present scenario, namely
diagnosability and resilience [Ezekiel and Lomuscio, 2017]. Given a correctness
requirement Φ and a responsible agent a, those can be expressed by the following
templates:
AG (¬Φ → hhaiiF Ka ¬Φ)
AG (¬Φ → hhaiiF Φ)

(diagnosability)
(resilience)

The templates can be used e.g. for monitoring-type requirements.

3.5

Towards Formal Analysis

Ideally, one would like to automatically evaluate COVID-19 strategies with respect to the requirements, and choose the best one. In the future, we plan
to use model checking tools, such as MCMAS [Lomuscio et al., 2017], Uppaal [Behrmann et al., 2004], or PRISM [Kwiatkowska et al., 2002], to formally
14

verify our formulas over micro-level models created to simulate and predict the
progress of the pandemic [Neil M. Ferguson, Daniel Laydon, Gemma Nedjati-Gilani et al.,
2020, Adamik et al., 2020, Bock et al., 2020, McCabe et al., 2020]. As we already pointed out, diﬀerent requirements may be in partial conﬂict. Thus,
selecting an optimal mitigation strategy may require solving a multicriterial
optimization problem [Zionts, 1981, Collette and Siarry, 2004, Radulescu et al.,
2020], e.g., by identifying the Pareto frontier and choosing a criterion to select
a point on the frontier.

Conclusions

In this paper, we make the ﬁrst step towards a systematic analysis of strategies
for eﬀective and trustworthy mitigation of the current pandemic. The strategies
may incorporate medical, social, economic, as well as technological measures.
Consequently, there is a large number of medical, social, economic, and technological requirements that must be taken into account when deciding which
strategy to adopt. For computer scientists, the latter kind of requirements is
most natural, which is exactly the pitfall that computer scientists must avoid.
The goals (and acceptability criteria) for a mitigation strategy are much more
diverse, and we must consciously choose a solution that satisﬁes the multiple
criteria to a reasonable degree. We suggest that formal methods for MAS provide an excellent framework for that. We also propose a methodology to collect
preliminary requirements while avoiding the usual bias of research papers.
