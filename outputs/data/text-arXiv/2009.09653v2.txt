Abstract
This paper shows that the generalized logistic distribution model is derived from
the well-known compartment model, consisting of susceptible, infected and recovered compartments, abbreviated as the SIR model, under certain conditions.
In the SIR model, there are uncertainties in predicting the final values for the
number of infected population and the infectious parameter. However, by utilizing the information obtained from the generalized logistic distribution model, we
can perform the SIR numerical computation more stably and more accurately.
Applications to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) using this combined method are also introduced.

1. Introduction
The well-known compartment model, consisting of susceptible, infected and
recovered compartments, abbreviated as the SIR model, has been commonly
used in infectious disease spread simulations for more than half a century although the mathematical model is very simple (see Kermack and McKendrick,
1933; Anderson and May, 1991; Diekmann and Heesterbeek, 2000, e.g., for general descriptions). Such a long life-length proves the effectiveness of this model,
resulting in a variety of expansions and many actual applications (see Berge et
al., 2017; Chowell et al., 2006; Ferguson et al., 2001; Vaidya et al., 2014, e.g.,
for specific applications). Similar to other cases, this model has been recently
applied to Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); see Wu et al., 2020;
Tuite et al., 2020; Dehning et. al., 2020; Fang et al., 2020; Fokas et al., 2020;
Giordano et al., 2020; Anand et al., 2020; Bertozzi et al., 2020.

Meanwhile, the generalized logistic distribution has also been used in statistical infectious disease spread predictions (see e.g., Zhou and Yan, 2003; Hirose,
2007) as an empirical model. The method is also used in COVID-19 case (see
Aviv-Sharon and Aharoni, 2020, e.g.).
However, there seems to be no plain explanations connecting this differential
equation model and the probability distribution model. In this paper, firstly, we
show that the generalized logistic distribution model can be derived from the
SIR model under certain conditions. Then, we can propose a more accurate and
stable prediction method by combining these two models. Applications to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and COVID-19 using this combination
method are also introduced.
2. SIR Model and Its Uncertainties in Numerical Computations
2.1. SIR Model with Cumulative Infected Population
The SIR model uses the ordinary differential equations
dS(t)
dt
dI(t)
dt
dR(t)
dt

=

−λS(t)I(t),

(1)

=

λS(t)I(t) − γI(t),

(2)

=

γI(t),

(3)

where S, I, and R mean the susceptible, infectious, and removed populations,
and the parameters λ, and γ are the infection rate, and removal rate (recovery
rate). In the SIR model, for example, a person could change his or her condition
from susceptible to infected with a ratio λ, then to removed with a ratio γ.
Removed persons will never become susceptible. From Equations (1), (2), (3),
we have
dS(t) dI(t) dR(t)
+
+
= 0,
dt
dt
dt

(4)

which means S(t) + I(t) + R(t) = const. This is a total population size, and we
denote this by N . Here, we introduce T (t) = I(t) + R(t) for further discussions.
This is the number of cumulative infected persons.
2.2. Importance of Reproduction Number
Assuming that I(t) is small enough comparing to S(t) at early stages, that
is, S(t) ≈ S(0) ≈ N , then Equation (2) can be written
dI(t)
dt

=

λS(0)I(t) − γI(t) = (λS(0) − γ)I(t).

(5)

This fundamental ordinary differential equation can be easily solved as
I(t)

=

I(0)e(λS(0)−γ)t ,
2

(6)

using integration, where I(0) and S(0) are the initial number of infected persons and the initial number of susceptible persons, respectively. If we define
R0 = λS(0)/γ ≈ λN/γ which is called the basic reproduction number, I(t)
becomes increasing when R0 > 1, and decreasing when R0 < 1. That is, R0
plays an important role in determining the pandemic phenomena or extinction
phenomena at early stages of the infectious disease spread. Therefore, to know
R0 as early as possible is considered to be crucial as well as to find the solutions
for the SIR model. By rewriting R0 = λS(0)/γ to R0 = (λS(0)I(t))/(γI(t)), it
is worth mentioning that the condition that the number of inflow of infected persons is equivalent to the number of outflow of removed persons results in R0 = 1.
Later, this concept is useful to consider the current reproduction number Rc (t)
at current time t such that
λ(t)S(t)
,
γ(t)

Rc (t) =

(7)

where λ(t) and γ(t) are infection rate and removal rate at time t, respectively.
2.3. Uncertainties of SIR Numerical Computations
In solving the SIR ordinary differential equations as an initial value problem,
we require parameter values of λ and γ, and initial values of S(0), I(0) and R(0).
2.3.1. Solving Difference Equations
By observation, we can obtain daily populations for I(t) and R(t) because
daily numbers of newly infected, died and recovered (cured) persons are noticed
in public. We note that I(t) is not identical to the daily number of newly infected
persons. Then, parameters λ and γ for the SIR model at time t can be roughly
obtained by using the simultaneous difference equations below, regarding the
differential equations as the difference equations.
λ(t)

=

γ(t) =

S(t) − S(t + 1)
,
S(t)I(t)
R(t + 1) − R(t)
.
I(t)

(8)
(9)

Since daily values of λ(t) and γ(t) are unstable to some extent, such an
instability shall be removed by adopting the mean values computed from the
latest λ(t) and γ(t) values; for example, seven days average values can be used.
However, this is not an optimal solution. To find much more accurate estimates
for parameters λ and γ, we may use the best-backward solution (BBS) method
explained below.
2.3.2. Best-bakward solution, BBS
First, we obtain the initial guesses of λ(0) and γ (0) for λ and γ, e.g., by using
the simultaneous difference equations above. Then, we estimate the optimum
values of λ̂ and γ̂ for λ and γ by using the simplex method (Nelder and Mead,
3

1965), which is shown to be an extension from the method previously proposed
(Hirose, 2012). In optimization, we evaluate the following function E(n, s)(k)
iteratively,
E(n, s)(k)

=
=

n
X

j=n−s
n
X

j=n−s

{(T (k) (tj ) − T̃ (tj ))2 + (R(k) (tj ) − R̃(tj ))2 },

(10)

{(S (k) (tj ) − S̃(tj ))2 + (R(k) (tj ) − R̃(tj ))2 },

(11)

where T̃ (tj ), S̃(tj ) and R̃(tj ) are the numbers of observed values for cumulative
infected persons, susceptible persons and removed persons; T (k) (tj ) and R(k) (tj )
are k-th iterative solutions for the numbers of cumulative infected persons, susceptible persons and removed persons of the ordinary differential equations of
the SIR. We continue this iteration until |E(n, s)(k+1) − E(n, s)(k) | < ε holds,
where ε is a small positive number. In solving the SIR equations, the solutions
are obtained backward from time t = tn to time t = tn−s somehow, e.g., RungeKutta method. Finally, we could find the converged values λ̂ and γ̂. We note
that T (k) (tn ) = T̃ (tn ), S (k) (tn ) = S̃(tn ) and R(k) (tn ) = R̃(tn ) for all k. Taking
into account the importance of the most recent observed values, we often use
s = 7.
However, S(t) becomes unreliable because it strongly depends on N , and
we cannot determine an appropriate size of N . It may be a small district size,
or a large country size, depending on the region of disease spread. That is,
N is unknown in general because plausible uninfected persons who can contact
infected persons are not identified. It is an uncertainty factor in using the SIR
model that we cannot determine N . There may be a resolution to such an
inconvenience by removing the term N from Equations (1), (2) and (3). That
is, we assume S(t) + I(t) + R(t) = 1. However, we often want to know the actual
infected population size, but not the ratio of infected population to the total
population N . We will deal with such the case.
2.3.3. Uncertainty Factors in the SIR
To look at this phenomenon, we have performed a simulation study using the
SARS case in Hong Kong in 2003 (SARS case data, (2003)). We assume cases
that N is 2,000 (strongly restricted area population), 10,000, 100,000, 1,000,000,
and 6,810,000 (actual Honk Kong population in 2003).
Figure 1 shows the predicted curves for the number of cumulative infected
persons, T (t), after 30th day using observed data from 22nd to 30th day via the
SIR model; here, day 1 was March 17, 2003. In the figure, the observed values
corresponding to T are the superimposed using dotted points. We see that the
prediction curves strongly depend on N . The larger the value of N , the steeper
the increasing tangent. In the cases of N ≥ 100, 000, the curves show blow-up
at the moment of 30th day, although T (t) is bounded above by the upper limit
N . Therefore, we can mention that we cannot predict the robust value for T if
N is unknown, typically at early stages.

in Honk Kong in 2003). We assumed cases that N is 2,000, 10,000, 100,000, 1,000,000, and
6,810,000.

There is also another uncertainty factor in solving the SIR ordinary differential equations. We cannot estimate the consistent value for λ(t) unless N is
clearly predetermined, typically at early stages.
3. The Generalized Logistic Distribution and the SIR
The generalized logistic distribution (GLD) model developed by Richards
(see Richards, 1959) can be applied to flexible growth function for empirical
use. This model is based on a simpler model (see Von Bertalanffy, 1938) to
describe the increase of weight as a function of the metabolism process of animals. The GLD is applied also to other fields such as hydrology (see Zakaria
et al., 2012, e.g.), medical fields in infectious disease spread modelling such as
SARS, foot and mouth disease (FMD), Zika virus disease, Ebola virus disease,
and SARS Cov-2 and in growth modelling such as physiochemical phenomenon,
psychological issues, survival time of diagnosed leukemia patients, and weight
gain data.
3.1. Generalized Logistic Distribution
The three-prameter generalized logistic distribution function is defined as
F (t; σ, µ, β) =

1
,
β
{1 + exp(− t−µ
σ )}

(12)

where σ, µ and β denote the scale, location, and shape parameters, respectively. By introducing z = (t − µ)/σ, we have the standard generalized logistic
5

distribution expressed by
F (z; β) =

1
,
{1 + exp(−z)}β

(13)

where
exp(−z) = exp(−

t−µ
µ
t
) = exp( ) exp(− ).
σ
σ
σ

(14)

In estimating the parameters θ = (σ, µ, β)T , we often use the maximum
likelihood estimation method. Since observed data are usually daily data, the
likelihood function L(θ) can be constructed by using the grouped truncated
model expressed as
L(θ) =



F (t0 ; θ)
F (tn ; θ)

k0 Y
k
n 
F (ti ; θ) − F (ti−1 ; θ)} i
·
,
F (tn ; θ)
i=1

(15)

where ki (0 ≤ i ≤ n) represents the number of infected persons from time −∞
to t0 or ti−1 to ti . When the total number of cases is known in advance, we can
also use the trunsored model (Hirose, 2007).
3.2. Derivation of GLD from the SIR
In the SIR model (1), (2), (3), we have assumed that I(t) is small enough
comparing to S(t) at early stage, i.e., S(0) ≈ N , then we have derived the simple
ordinary differential equation (4) with the solution of (5). This solution shows
the explosive increasing population for the infected persons when R0 > 1. In
the real world, the number of infected persons is bounded above. Thus, a much
more realistic model is required at later stages in disease spreading.
Since T (t) = N − S(t), from Equation (1), we have
dT (t)
dS(t)
=−
= λS(t)I(t) = λS(t)(T (t) − R(t)).
dt
dt

(16)

Assuming that R(t) = 0, i.e., none of infected persons will be transferred to the
removed population, then, this equation becomes
dT (t)
= λT (t)(N − T (t)).
dt

(17)

This equation shows a symmetry between T (t) and (N −T (t)), and consequently,
the solution represents increasing flat S-shaped curve. By integration, we can
easily derive the solution of (17) as
T (t) =

1+

( TN
(0)

N
,
− 1)e−λN t

(18)

which is called the logistic function. The inflection point becomes (log(N/T (0)−
1)/λN, N/2) by solving d2 T (t)/dt2 = 0.
6

In the real world, this model is still unrealistic because asymmetric curves
are often observed. Then, we assume that (T (t)/N ) shall be (T (t)/N )m because
it would be natural to think that the susceptible persons would be more/less affected by infected persons depending on the magnitude of m rather than linearly
affected. For example, if half of the population is already infected, the ratio of
infectious persons will not
√ be half but will be inflated to 3/4 when m = 2, and
it will be shrunk to (2 − 2)/2 when m = 1/2.
Thus, we assume the following ordinary differential equation
T (t) m
dT (t)
= bT (t)(1 − (
) ),
dt
N

(19)

where b is a constant holding that b = λN when m = 1. To solve this equation,
firstly, we set y(t) = T (t)/N , and further, we use change of variables such that
z(t) = (y(t))−m (refer to Skiadas, 2009, e.g., for such transformations). Then,
Equation (21) can be written as
dz
= −bm(z − 1),
dt

(20)

which can also be solved by integration, and the solution is
T (t) =

N
{1 +

(0) −m
(( TN
)

− 1) exp(−bmt)}1/m

.

(21)

This reveals that the curve of T (t) shows the same shape to one expressed
by Equation (13) except for the scale. Therefore, the generalized logistic distribution is derived from the SIR model with certain assumptions. These assumptions could be applied to the cases at early stages of the disease spread,
we may use this probability distribution as the statistical model representing
the infectious disease spread phenomena. The time t for the inflection point
becomes (log(((N/T (0))m − 1)/m))/bm by solving d2 T (t)/dt2 = 0.
We have the relationships of parameters between Equation (12) and Equation (21) such that b = β/σ, k = (1 + exp(µ/σ))−β , m = 1/β, σ = 1/(bm),
µ = (log(k −m − 1))/(bm), β = 1/m.
3.3. Estimation of N
Using exactly the same example in the previous section, we show, in Figure
2, the predicted curves for the number of cumulative infected persons, T (t),
after 30th, 33rd, 45th and 73th day using observed data from the first day to
the last observed day, by maximizing the likelihood function (22). Dotted points
show the observed values for T . In this GLD model, we can estimate the final
(i.e., t → ∞) value for T (t) such that
T̂ (∞) =

T (t)
F (t; θ̂)

,

(22)

where F (t; θ̂) expresses the cumulative distribution function value using estimated parameter θ̂ at time t. Looking at the figure, we see that the prediction
7

Figure 2: Predicted curves for the number of cumulative infected persons, T (t), after 30th,
33rd, 45th and 73th day using observed data from the first day to the last observed day via
GLD model (SARS in Honk Kong in 2003).

curves for T (t) are close to the observed values, although the prediction curves
show underestimated results to some extent.
In addition, the GLD model can predict the final value T̂ (∞) = N even
at early stages. It will not make sense that we compare the final value T̂ (∞)
using the GLD model with that using the SIR model because T̂ (∞) using the
SIR model does not provide consistent values. Therefore, we compare the value
T̂ (tconv ) using the GLD model with that using the SIR model, where tconv expresses the time when T̂ (t) seems to converge. In the SARS case example, we set
tconv = 117. We introduce the two terms of T̂ (tconv )GLD (t) and T̂ (tconv )SIR (t);
the former represents predicted T̂ (tconv ) estimated at truncation time t using
the GLD model, and the latter T̂ (tconv ) at time t using the SIR model.
We define L-plot such that time t locates in horizontal axis, and that T̂ (tconv )
locates in the vertical axis. Figure 3 shows the comparison between T̂ (tconv )GLD (t)
and T̂ (tconv )SIR (t) at various time t; in the figure, observed T (t) are superimposed. Although we have selected a rather small value of 117 for tconv , the estimated value of T̂ (117)SIR (t) shows unstable behavior than T̂ (117)GLD (t) does.
Therefore, we consider using the information for N using the GLD model, and
to combine the GLD model use and the SIR model use next.
4. Combination Method
As described above, we can predict the number of cumulative infected persons after the last day of observation using the SIR model under appropriate
conditions. However, to keep the estimates reliable, we should pay attention
to provide adequate parameter values, in particular for infection parameter λ

8

Figure 3: Comparison of the L-plots between T̂ (117)GLD (t) and T̂ (117)SIR (t) (SARS in Honk
Kong in 2003).

and total population N . Otherwise, even if we can roughly obtain the current
reproduction number Rc , we cannot know consistent estimates for λ and N .
On the contrary, we do not require the information of N to estimate the
parameter θ in the GLD model. In addition, we can estimate N even at early
stages. Thus, in order to obtain the more accurate estimates of the parameters
in the SIR model, we may utilize that information from the GLD model. This
is called the combination method. Using these two models simultaneously, we
can expect to make more accurate predictions.
4.1. Application to COVID-19 case
Figure 4 shows the observed COVID-19 case data in Hubei in 2020 (Hubei
case data, (2020)). Looking at the figure, we see that the infection spreads very
quickly, but recovered slowly. From the infection to recover, it took three weeks
referring the median time of infection curve and recovered curve.
First, we have fitted the generalized logistic distributions to observed values
of cumulative number of infected persons, cumulative number of died persons
and cumulative number of recovered persons. Figure 5 shows the cumulative
distribution functions and corresponding observed data, i.e., the cumulative
number of persons are divided by the total number of persons. We can see
that the three observed cases are well fitted to the generalized logistic distributions. According to Hirose, 2007, among the generalized lognormal, generalized
extreme-value, generalized gamma and generalized logistic distributions, the
generalized logistic distribution showed the best-fit model.
To the observed number of infected persons, we have applied the L-plot in
Figure 6, assuming that the observed values follow generalized logistic distributions. From the figure, we see that the estimates for N seem to stable after

29th day from the beginning, and it seems to converge around 70, 000. Thus,
we set N to 70, 000 in the SIR model.

Figure 6: L-plot for COVID-19 case data in Hubei in 2020. Observed values are superimposed
using dots.

Figure 7 shows the predicted curves after the last day of observation. In
the figure, solid curves express the case of N = 70, 000, and dotted curves
N = 1, 000, 000 for the sake of comparison. Clearly, the case of N = 1, 000, 000
is misleading because there are large discrepancies between the predicted values
and observed values. On the contrary, it seems that the predicted values are
close to observed values in the case of N = 70, 000.
5. Concluding Remarks
Although the SIR model has been actively used for a long time and has been
useful for prediction, there are uncertainties in predicting the final values for the
number of infected population and the infectious parameter. In this paper, we
have introduced that the generalized logistic distribution model can be derived
from the SIR model under certain conditions. In using the generalized logistic
distribution model, we can resolve one of the uncertainty factors, resulting in
the use of such the information for the numerical computations in the SIR
model. We have proposed a more accurate and stable prediction methodology
by cooperating these two models with each other. Applications to SARS and
COVID-19 using this combined method are also introduced.
