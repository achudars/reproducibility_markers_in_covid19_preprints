A BSTRACT
With the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic spreading across the world, protective
measures for containing the virus are essential, especially as long as no vaccine or effective treatment
is available. One important measure is the so-called physical distancing or social distancing. In this
paper, we propose an agent-based numerical simulation of pedestrian dynamics in order to assess
behaviour of pedestrians in public places in the context of contact-transmission of infectious diseases
like COVID-19, and to gather insights about exposure times and the overall effectiveness of distancing
measures. To abide the minimum distance of 1.5 m stipulated by the German government at an
infection rate of 2%, our simulation results suggest that a density of one person per 16 m2 or below is
sufficient. The results of this study give insight about how physical distancing as a protective measure
can be carried out more efficiently to help reduce the spread of COVID-19.

Introduction

Starting at the end of 2019, the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first described in Wuhan, China [1], and
has rapidly spread world-wide over the past months causing an unprecedented pandemia with more than 431, 541
deaths so far (first wave of disease) [2]. The illness is caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus
2 (SARS-CoV-2). Despite drastic restrictions in every-day life, numbers of new infections are still on the rise [3].
Hence, special attention should be given to the protection of vulnerable patients with high risk of a severe course of the
disease. Diagnostic gold standard to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection is reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) of viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) collected by a combined nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and oropharyngeal
swab (OPS) [4]. As long as no vaccine or at least no therapy is available, only exit restrictions and social distancing can
slow down the spread of COVID-19. Social distancing, also called “physical distancing” means limiting face-to-face
contact with others. A model developed to support pandemic influenza planning [5, 6] was adapted using the data of the
COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan to explore scenarios for the United States and Great Britain [7] resulting in the advice
of social distancing of the whole population and household quarantine of infected individuals as well as school and
university closures. By simulating the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan using a deterministic stage-structured SEIR
(susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered) model over a 1 year period, Prem et al. [8] came to the conclusion that a
reduction in social mixing can be effective in reducing magnitude and delaying the peak of outbreak. These British
epidemiologists from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine suspect that a second wave of COVID-19

Agent-based Simulation of Pedestrian Dynamics for Exposure Time Estimation in Epidemic Risk Assessment

disease could only be prevented if exit and contact restrictions were maintained over the long term or at least resumed
intermittently. It is therefore increasingly important to know what distances must be maintained to avoid infection. As
far as these distances are concerned the study of Bischoff et al. [9] revealed that healthcare professionals within 1.829 m
of patients with influenza could be exposed to infectious doses of influenza virus, primarily in small-particle aerosols.
This led to the advice of keeping a minimum distance of 1 m to 2 m from the Robert Koch Institut (RKI) [10], which is
evaluating available information of the corona virus and estimating the risk for the population in Germany. The RKI
and the German Federal Ministry of Health has in response published a handout [11] stating that in public, a minimum
distance of 1.5 m must be maintained wherever possible. Besides, it is relevant whether people are next to each other,
staggered behind each other, or directly behind each other. Especially in indoor areas, e.g. shopping, corresponding
constellations occur in combination. Simulations can help to make the necessary distance measures easier to understand.
Different distance scenarios can be simulated and recommendations for the distance can be suggested.
In their call to action Squazzoni et al. [12] give an overview of computational models for global pandemic outbreak
simulation and their limitations and Chang et al. [13] propose a microscopic model for the simulation of the COVID-19
outbreak in Australia. The model consists of over 24 million individuals with different characteristics and social context
and was calibrated with the 2016 census data of Australia.
In the context of the simulation of pedestrian dynamics there exists a variety of comprehensive surveys [14, 15, 16].
Models were differentiated mainly into macroscopic and microscopic. In macroscopic models the crowd is assumed as
the smallest entity. These models allow the representation of high density crowds, but cannot model the interaction
between pairs or groups of pedestrians. Microscopic models assume one pedestrian as the smallest entity. They are
roughly divided into physical force models, cellular automata or queueing models. This work focusses on the so called
social force model by Helbing et al. [17, 18, 19, 20] which can be categorised as a physical force model.
Main contributions of this work are
• adaptable social force-based model for pedestrian dynamics in realistic environments
• exposure time measurement for assessment of the spreading of diseases
• discussion of the effects of distancing measures on exposure times.
This paper is organised as follows. Firstly, Section 2 gives an overview of existing models for simulations of the
spread of diseases. In Section 3 we set forth the agent-based model and the accompanying simulation we used for
our experiments. Section 4 describes the experiments concerning the simulation of pedestrian dynamics in realistic
environments, the effectiveness of distancing measures, and measuring of exposure time in the context of infectious
diseases in general and COVID-19 in particular. Following, in Section 5 we present the results from the experiment,
and in Section 6 we give a short conclusion/summary and outlook.

Related Work

As far as the simulation of the spreading of diseases is concerned most approaches are based on macroscopic models.
The so called compartment models [21] divide the population of interest into compartments with different characteristics.
The simplest model is the SIR model. It consists of three compartments susceptible, infectious and recovered. The
population is split into these three compartments. Entities in the susceptible group model the entities most likely to be
infected. The entities in the infectious group are the ones already infected and the entities in the recovered group have
recovered from the infection. An entity transfer from for example susceptible to infectious state and from infectious to
recovered state could be modelled. Thus, re-infection with the modelled disease would not be depicted by this model.
A plethora of different variations of this scheme exist with varying numbers of compartments [22]. The independent
variable in the compartment models is the time t. The transfer ratios of the population from one compartment to another
are expressed as derivatives with respect to t, thus resulting in differential equations for the compartments of the model.
One of the shortcomings of these models is, that each individual in the population is modelled with the same set of
features. This is overcome by the introduction of metapopulations [23, 24] building sub compartments of, e. g., entities
with natural immunity or asymptomatic individuals. Still each of the metapopulations share a homogeneous set of
model parameters.
With rapid growth of available processing power individuals based models (IBM) or agent based models (ABM)
are used to model infectious disease outbreaks. Willem et al. [25] and Nepomuceno et al. [26] give comprehensive
overviews of IBM/ABM usage in the field of epidemiology. Based on the work by Brockmann [27], Frías-Martínez

et al. [28] propose an agent-based model of epidemic spread based on social network information from data of base
transceiver stations (BTC) captured during the 2009 H1N1 outbreak in Mexico. By simulating an outbreak of measles
that occurred in Schull, Ireland in 2012 based on open data, Hunter et al. [29] have shown recently, that agent based
modelling in combination with open data leads to regionally transferable models. Bobashev et al. [30] discuss the
combination of compartment models and microscopic agent-based models into an so called hybrid multi-scale model.
In this paper, we propose a microscopic model for simulating pedestrian dynamics in the context of infectious disease
spread, including monitoring of contacts and exposure times in realistic scenarios. The simulation devised in this work
runs in real-time, giving instantaneous feedback about the considered scenario and thus allowing for visual assessment,
in addition to resulting statistics.

Materials and Methods

In the following, we describe in detail the underlying physical model of pedestrian dynamics and the simulation
we implemented. Our simulation is adapted to realistic scenarios in the context of the assessment of infectious
disease spread, with focus on exposure time measurement. Specifically, we apply it to a supermarket scenario and the
corresponding measures taken with regard to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The simulation we present is an agent-based approach based on the model of Helbing et al. [17, 18, 19, 20]. The
simulation is carried out on a static scenery with a defined number n ∈ N of agents or particles pi . Each agent has an
individual starting point si and destination point di (t) (both ∈ R2 ), the former being static and the latter varying with
time t ∈ R≥0 .
Motion of an individual pi is governed by Equation 1, which is composed of the term for self-propelling aself and
external forces f acting upon pi

Here, xi ∈ R2 denotes the position of pi , and mi (in kg) its mass.
Self-acceleration of agents, as defined in Equation 2, is the adjustment of the actual velocity vi (t) to the desired velocity

.
(2)
τ
The parameter τ ∈ R>0 (in s) determines the amount of delay time for an agent to adapt. The desired velocity of an
agent pi is the product of its speed vi0 and the desired direction of movement e0i (t). The latter depends on the destination
di (t) and is determined by the pre-computed navigation method described below.

The model by Helbing mainly consists of different types of forces acting upon an agent, social and physical forces. The
social forces f soc model a pedestrian’s endeavour to avoid contact with other pedestrians, while the physical forces f ph
model effects arising when pedestrians are so close that there is actual contact between them. While in the original
model of Helbing et al. the social force is only comprised of a normal component (called f norm here), in this paper, we
add an additional tangential term f tang .
The social force thus takes the following form:
f soc = f norm + f tang .

where A determines the force (in N) and B the range (in m) of repulsive interactions, and λ ∈ [0, 1] the (an-)isotropy.
The vector nij (t) denotes the normal from pi to pj of unit length, φ the angle between current direction ei (t) of
particle pi and nij (t). The scalar value rij is the sum of the respective radii ri and rj of the considered particles,
while dij (t) = kxi (t) − xj (t)k is the distance between their centres, both quantities measured in metres. Note that for
the experiments performed, the distance d0ij between the perimeters is measured. This is defined as d0ij = dij − rij .
With regard to the measures taken by the German government for prevention of the spread of COVID-19, we set
the critical distance dmin for a possible transmission to 1.5 m. Figure 1 shows different aspects of agent interaction.
Figures 1a and 1b show interaction in the simulation with regard to the critical distance, while Figure 1c shows
associated quantities of the mathematical model between two particles.
The tangential term f tang (Equation 5) is now defined as a fraction γ ∈ R of the normal term, but in direction tij ,
orthogonal to nij . Furthermore, this term is added only if the pedestrians involved, pi and pj , are heading into opposite
directions. This is taken care of by the function ψij (Equation 6).

f tang (t) = ψij (t) · γ · kfij

The value of γ ∈ [0, 1] determines the amount of normal social force added in tangential direction. For the experiments
performed, we set γ = 0.7. The function ψ (Eq. 6) determines the pedestrians’ directions by evaluating the dot product
between their respective directions of movement ei (t) = kvvii (t)

The added tangential term makes for a more realistic movement of the agents, as they evade each other early, if applied.
This is even more noticeable in conjunction with the method we employ for pathfinding, as described below.

Here, constants κ and k determine amounts of friction and the force counteracting body compression. The term

∆vji

physical forces only arise when two particles actually touch, i. e. the distance dij between them is lower than the sum of

Figure 3: Supermarket scene with walkable areas shown in white and obstacles in black

In Equation 9, dib denotes the distance, and nib the normal and tib the tangential direction towards the closest obstacle(point) b to pi , which are all determined directly from the scene representation described below. Parameters Awall and
B wall are the analogues to A and B in Equation 4. This is a slight deviation from the model by Helbing et al., as we
define separate social distance parameters for obstacles and for other agents.
For the experiments conducted in this work, a scene the agents can move around in needs to be defined. This will
define the supermarket scenario considered in the simulation we performed with regard to the COVID-19 measures,
as described in Section 4. The scene is represented as a distance transform [31, 32] of a two-dimensional, binary
discretised map, as depicted in Figure 3. This map defines the size of the simulated area, as well as the regions within
which are walkable (shown as white) or pose an obstacle to the agents (black). The scene in the experiments performed
is represented by a discretised map at a resolution of 8 pixels per m. Agent navigation depends on pre-calculated paths
based on Dijkstra’s algorithm [33]. Accordingly, for each destination, a map containing the directions of movement
towards it for each walkable point in the area is generated. This way the direction of movement ei (t) of an agent
pi is determined by looking up the given direction of movement at position xi from the map corresponding to pi ’s
current destination di (cf. Section 3). Colour-coded renderings of maps for three different destination points are shown
in Figure 2. Agent navigation in the context of our COVID-19 simulation, including details on how destinations are
chosen, is described in Section 4.
The need for the added tangential social force f tang becomes apparent in cases of symmetry, which arise when forces
are at an equilibrium. The pre-calculated paths may impose symmetries, as they minimize the distance towards the
destination. This means, the prescribed way can be a thin line even though there is more space available, resulting in
unnatural behaviour and building of queues, especially when agents are approaching others head-on. In the worst case,
this can lead to “deadlocks” or clogging of pedestrians, even in cases where the surrounding area provides enough space
for the agents to evade each other.

Experiments

The simulation was carried out with a basic “supermarket” scenario of size 80 m × 60 m (cf. Figure 3) with varying
numbers n of agents, which represent customers. The scene is aimed to mimic a typical German supermarket with
shelves, counters and cashiers. Within the simulated area, a set of 34 destinations is defined (Figure 3a), representing
points of interest within the supermarket. We performed simulations for number of agents (population size) of
n ∈ {50, 100, 200, 300}. A defined amount of the agents were marked as “infected”.
Figure 3b shows the scene with 100 agents. Infectious persons are marked red in the visualisation, all others green.
Infected agents carry the virus and can potentially infect others. The amount of infected agents was varied from
{0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2} in the experiments, tantamount to ratios of 2% to 20%. The agents’ radii ri were sampled
uniformly from [0.25, 0.35]. Mass is then determined proportionally to the individual radii as mi = 160 · ri in kg. The
desired speed vi0 was sampled uniformly from the range [0.3, 0.8] (in m s).
Simulation parameters were chosen as A = 10 000 N, B ∈ {0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 1.5}m, Awall = 10 000 N, B wall = 0.5 m, and
τ = 0.5 s. As body contact does hardly ever occur, constants k and κ supposedly have very little impact on the outcome
of the simulation, if at all. For the sake of completeness, we set k = 20 000 kg · m−1 · s−1 , and κ = 40 000 kg · s−2 .

Initially, agents were distributed randomly across the area, i. e. their starting points si are set to random (walkable)
positions within the scene. The set of destinations were assigned to the agents in an even split, determining the agents’
initial destination points di . During the simulation, if an agent reaches its destination, a new destination is assigned
randomly from the available set of destinations (excluding the current one). Agent movement is then determined by
the direction map corresponding to the destination, as described in Section 3. Thus, a typical behaviour of customers
walking around the supermarket is simulated. The simulation time was set to fifteen minutes.
During the simulation, for each agent, we keep track of exposure time to infected agents. More precisely, the time span
an agent comes below the prescribed safety distance dmin of 1.5 m (cf. Section 1) to an infected agent is accumulated
per individual during the course of the simulation.

Results

The box-and-whisker plots [34] in Figure 4 show the average deviation of the exposure time concerning the different
population sizes, distances, and infection rates, as described in Section 4. The boxes are representing the interquartile
range which contains 50% of the values and the whiskers are marking the minimum and maximum values, excluding
outliers (marked as black diamonds).
The first scenario depicted in Figure 4a shows the results for a minimal population of 50 agents. With a uniform
distribution of the individuals and if superstructures (cf. Figure 3a) are neglected a density of one individual per 96 m2
is to be expected. Thus, enough space for avoidance is available. This is supported by the box plots. Even if a very
short desired distance of 50 cm is considered, the mean exposure time is 7.78 s (standard deviation (std) 9.1 s) for an
infection rate of 2% of the individuals. Even if very high infection rates of 10% are considered the mean exposure time
is below one minute (52 s, std 29.16 s). If the requested distance of 1.5 m (cf. Section 1) is maintained mean exposure
time for an infection rate of 20% is 2.3 s (std 2.9 s). With a growing number of agents exposure times are rising (cf.
Figure 4b). Expected density with a population of 100 is one individual per 48 m2 . For small desired distances and
medium infection rates of 5% the mean exposure time is 84.95 s (std 36.5 s) which is 61% higher than the results
6

Agent-based Simulation of Pedestrian Dynamics for Exposure Time Estimation in Epidemic Risk Assessment

with the same parameters and a population of 50. As the desired distances increase the exposure times are decreasing.
Considering the requested 1.5 m distance the mean exposure time for an infection rate of 20% is 19.85 s (std 11.79 s),
which is 836% higher than the exposure times for a population of 50. As far as realistic infection rates of 2% are
concerned, the mean exposure time is 2.49 s (std 2.84 s). The results for a population of size 200 is shown in Figure 4c.
This population size with an expected density of one agent per 24 m2 representing the maximum density allowed during
lock down in most of German federal states at the time of writing. For an infection rate of 2% and an desired distance
of 1.5 m the mean exposure time is 6.19 s (std 6.02 s). With an expected density of one individual per 16 m2 Figure 4d
shows the results for a simulation with 300 agents. Mean exposure time is 11.31 s (std 15.03 s). The 50% percentile
(median) for all simulations with this parametrisation is below 8 s (7.7 s, 4.64 s, 1.37 s, 0 s), showing the effectiveness
of distancing tactics in the minimisation of exposure times.

Discussion

We have presented a simulation of pedestrian dynamics in realistic scenarios with focus on the spread of infectious
diseases by contact transmission. An important measure taken to reduce the spread of COVID-19 is the so-called
social distancing or physical distancing, aiming to reduce close contacts between individuals in public places. In the
experiments we conducted, we showed how our simulation can give insights about exposure time to infected individuals
and the feasibility and effectiveness of keeping distance in realistic crowded scenarios. Our experiments suggest that, if
we assume an infection rate of 2%, the prescribed minimum distance of 1.5 m can be maintained if a density of one
person per 16 m2 is not exceeded.
In this work, we have presented a method for risk assessment concerning pedestrian dynamics and exposure time in
conjunction with COVID-19 in particular and infectious diseases in general. Due to the flexibility of the approach, it
can be applied to a great variety of scenarios prone to transmission of contagious diseases. This especially includes
public places, indoor as well as outdoor.
Our simulation can serve as a tool for a better assessment of quantities regarding the number of people to admit, or
on guidelines for distances to keep between individual persons. Due to the nature of the simulation, it can also give
insight about optimisation on the geometry of the surrounding, like identification of bottlenecks and hotspots, in order
to reduce risks for people moving around and meeting in the place in question.
With the COVID-19 pandemic affecting countries all over the world at the time of writing, the urgent need of models
and tools for better assessment of situations in public places is apparent. We are confident that our simulation results
can serve as a basis for better risk assessment in public places in the context of infectious diseases, and for further
research in this area.
