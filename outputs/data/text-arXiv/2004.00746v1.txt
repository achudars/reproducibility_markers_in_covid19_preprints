Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2: Analysis of subgenomic mRNA transcription, 3CLpro and PL2pro
protease cleavage sites and protein synthesis
Corresponding autor: Miguel Ramos-Pascual
Abstract
Coronaviruses have recently caused world-wide severe outbreaks: SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome) in 2002 and MERS (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome) in 2012. At the end of 2019, a new
coronavirus outbreak appeared in Wuhan (China) seafood market as the first focus of infection, becoming a
pandemics in 2020, spreading mainly into Europe and Asia [Zu et al 2020]. Although the virus family is wellknown and symptoms are similar to other coronaviruses (fever, pneumonia, small pleural effusions), this
specific virus type presents considerable differences, as higher transmission and mortality rates, being a
challenge for diagnostic methods, treatments and vaccines.
Coronavirus.pro (SARS-CoV-2) App is a module of Virus.pro, a C++ application which simulates Coronavirus
replication cycle. This software identifies virus types in short times and provides FASTA files of virus
proteins, a list of RNA sequences (regulatory, packaging, transcription and translation) and secondary
structures (stem-loops, helices, palindromes, mirrors), once the virus genome has been sequenced. The
code is supported by other bio-informatics tools, such as Vienna RNA package, Varna software and
ClustalW2.
Coronavirus.pro has identified 2019-nCoV virus as a beta-coronavirus more close related to SARS type than
to MERS. However, it presents significant differences, such as the spike glycoprotein precursor,
characteristic of this virus type, and the increased number of transcription regulating sequences (TRS),
producing more subgenomic mRNAS and synthesizing more fusion proteins than SARS/MERS. This could be
related with those severe health effects (toxicity) on host patients than other coronaviruses.
The software has identified a list of structural, non-structural and accessory proteins in 2019-nCoV virus
genome similar to SARS and MERS. It has found also several ORF encoding some accessory proteins with
unknown TRS (i.e. AP3b, AP9b, AP11, AP12 and AP14a/b). Furthermore, there is a subgenomic mRNA, the
shortest with 374bp, which translates no proteins, specific only of SARS type virus. Finally, there are some
accessory proteins AP2 in SARS/MERS and AP2a/b in 2019-nCoV, encoded before ORF1.2 and ORF1.4
respectively, which have not been previously reported.
2019-nCoV protein sequences have been compared with those from SARS and MERS. As 3CLpro (nsp5) and
RdRp (nsp12) have >90% similarities with SARS, some antiviral drugs effective with SARS coronavirus, such
as protease inhibitors or RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors could be also effective to this virus
type. Nevertheless, further comparisons would be required, including other types of estimators.
These results are useful as a first step with other bio-informatics and pharmacological tools in order to
develop diagnostic methods (real time RT-PCR or ELISA tests), new vaccines or antiviral drugs, which avoid
virus replication in any stage: fusion inhibitors, RdRp inhibitors and PL2pro/3CLpro protease inhibitors.

1. Introduction
Coronaviruses (CoVs) are specific viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds, including humans, with
symptoms such as enteritis in bats, mice and pigs and upper respiratory malfunctions and potentially lethal
respiratory infections in humans [Fehr and Perlman 2015] A large variety of coronaviruseses have been
previously studied and analyzed. These viruses are responsible in a 2-10% of common cold in
immunocompetent individuals (i.e. 229E, OC43E, NL63 and HKU1 types). However, other types can cause
severe respiratory syndromes, such as SARS-CoV (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus) that
caused an epidemics in 2002-2003, with origin on Guangdong (China) [Vijayanand et al 2004] and MERSCoV (Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus) expanded in 2014-2015 through Saudi Arabia into
Egypt, Oman and Qatar, from bats to dromedary camels, as the source of infection in humans [Aleanizy et
al 2017].
At the end of 2019, a new SARS outbreak appeared in Wuhan (China) seafood market as the first focus of
infection, becoming a pandemics in 2020 and spreading mainly into Europe and Asia, declaring general
state of alarm in several countries, as Spain and Italy [Liao et al 2020, Zu et al 2020, Giovanetti et al 2020].
Coronavirus infections have normally low case fatality rates, with symptoms more severe than common
cold, affecting mainly respiratory tract (cilia epithelium of the trachea, nasal mucosa and alveolar cells of
the lung). Although the virus family is well-known and symptoms are similar to other coronavirus (fever,
pneumonia, small pleural effusions), this specific type of virus presents considerable differences, as a higher
infection/transmission and mortality rate, being a challenge for disease protection, prevention, diagnostic
methods, vaccines and treatments [Wu et al 2020, Zhu et al 2020].
Virus pharmacology is based on preventive actions (vector-based or RBD-based vaccines), diagnostic
methods (real time RT-PCR or ELISA tests) and antiviral drugs. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics have
expanded the use of several drugs, specially virus cycle inhibitors against coronaviruses (fusion inhibitors,
RdRp inhibitors or PL2pro/3CLpro protease inhibitors) [Li G and De Clercq 2019, Raoult et al 2020]
In order to develop these methods, virus replication cycle must be simulated through computerized tools,
specially for this virus family, with a complex replication cycle. Coronaviruses synthesize in a first stage a
viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and multiple proteases, transcribes several subgenomic
mRNAs and translates them progressively into viral proteins through several ribosomal pathways: (-1)
programmed frameshift, leaky scanning and internal ribosome entry site (IRES) [Plant et al 2005]. Some
mRNAs include genes encoding large polypeptide chains, which are cleaved through 3CLpro and PL2pro
proteases, producing non-structural proteins as enzymes for catalyzing assembly and packaging of new
viruses [Sawicki et al 2007, Fehr and Perlman 2015, Oxford et al. 2016]
Coronavirus.pro (2019-nCoV) App is a C++ code which simulates Coronavirus replication cycle. This
software identifies virus types in short times and provides FASTA files of virus proteins, a list of RNA
sequences (regulatory, packaging, transcription and translation) and secondary structures (stem-loops,
helixes, palindromes, mirrors), once the virus genome has been sequenced [Ramos-Pascual 2019]. The code
is supported by other RNA analysis tools, such as Vienna RNA package and Varna software [Gruver et al
2008, Darty et al 2009]. These results are useful as a first step with other bioinformatics and
pharmacological tools in order to develop diagnostic methods, new vaccines and antiviral drugs.

2. The Coronavirus: classification, structure, genome and virus cycle
2.1 Classification
Coronaviruses (CoVs) are part of the order Nidovirales, from the family Coronaviridae and formed by
several subtypes: Alpha-, beta-, gamma- and delta-coronavirus. Virus 229E and OC43, the first of being
isolated and responsible of common cold, belong to alpha-coronavirus group I, while SARS and MERS are
beta-coronavirus.
2.2 Structure of the virion
Coronaviruses have diameters from 100 to 160 μm with very large heavily glycosylated spikes (S) of 200kDa
and 20 μm, placed around virus membrane as a crown, hence their name, in a trimer configuration (fig. 1).
Viral RNA genome is encapsulated in a helicoidal nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N), known also as
ribonucleoprotein (RNP), and enveloped into a virus particle with different membrane (M) and envelope
glycoproteins (E).
Some coronaviruses include also a hemagglutinin-acetyleserase glycoprotein (HE) in the outer membrane.
HEs helps during attachment, destroying certain sialic acid receptors in host-cell surface. Not all strains
demonstrated hemagglutination, as observed only in beta-coronaviruses subgroup 2a (HCoV-HKU1, MHV)
and toroviruses (BToV) [Brian et al. 1995, de Groot 2006]

2.3 Virus genome
Coronavirus genome is a type of positive single-stranded RNA of approximately 30kb, the largest of RNA
viruses, 5’capped, 3’polyadenylated and infectious. This Poly(A) tail allows coronaviruses direct translation
after infection without needing an intermediate transcription stage.
Transcription initiation is regulated in coronaviruses by several types of consensus transcription regulating
sequences: TRS1-L, 5’-cuaaac-3’, TRS2-L, 5’-acgaac-3’ and merged into TRS3-L, 5’-cuaaacgaac-3’. These
multiple TRS give place to several subgenomic polycistronic mRNAs, encoding structural, non-structural and
accessory proteins. In case of some coronaviruses (i.e. MERS-CoV), transcription starts mainly in TRS2-L,
while other coronaviruses start transcription indistinctly in all TRS, in a way of regulating protein
frequencies [Sethna et al 1989, Irigoyen et al 2016].
Coronavirus genome includes multiple open-reading frames (ORF) containing genes which are transcribed
by several transcription regulating sequences (TRS). Genes encoding non-structural proteins are placed at

3

5’ UTR (ORF1.1, ORF1.2 ...), whereas at 3’ UTR are genes for structural (N, M, E and S). These genes are
interspaced with several accessory genes, encoding accessory proteins (AP), characteristics in number of
each virus type. Some of these AP are not essential for in vitro or in vivo replication.
As transcription starts at different TRS in each subgenomic mRNA, the number of ORF genes is variable on
virus type, and therefore the number of polypeptide chains. This produces different frequencies of nonstructural proteins during virus cycle. For example, SARS produces ORF1.1 and ORF1.2 genes, whereas
2019-nCoV, produces ORF1.1 to ORF1.6 genes, synthesizing several groups of fusion proteins [van
Boheemen et al. 2012]. A (-1) programmed slippery ribosome frameshift is placed approximately in the
middle of ORF1 genes, then translated into polypeptides pp1a and pp1ab [Dinman 2012, Bock et al 2019].
Furthermore, Coronaviruses uses a leaky scanning mechanism (shunting) to synthesize proteins from
overlapping ORF, translating different proteins from the same mRNA [Nakagawa et 2016].
Surface glycosyllabed Spike (S) is processed in some coronaviruses from a proteollytic cleavage of a spike
precursor [Belouzard et al 2009]. The number of spike precursors is characteristic of each coronavirus. For
example, in the case of SARS-CoV, two spike precursors (Sp1 and Sp2) are proteolytically cleaved, producing
two surface glycosyllabed spikes (S1 an S2) and a protease fragment (S0).
Figure 2 shows a scheme of the main genes in Coronavirus family, including ORF1.1 with a -1 slippery
ribosome frameshift. Genes transcribed from different TRS are placed in another line. Figure 3 presents a
scheme of ORF1.1 gene and non-structural proteins (nsp1 to nsp16), including accessory protein AP2.
Tables 1 and 2 summarize main genes and proteins of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV coronaviruses.

2.4 Virus replication cycle
As other viruses, Coronavirus employs glycosillabed spikes placed in the outer surface to attach specific
receptors of host cells (i.e. APN/ACE2/DPP4 receptor). Specially, betacoronaviruses attach to angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, a membrane protein expressed mainly in the surface of epithelial
cells of the pulmonary alveolus [Jia et al 2005]. Once attachment is carried out, viral transmembrane is
fused through an endocytotic pathway and viral RNA is released into the cell cytoplasm [Wang et al 2008].
Viral RNA genome is positive stranded, 5’ capped and 3’polyadenylated, therefore it can be directly
translated into proteins by host-cell ribosomes. Specifically, ORF1 gene contains several non-structural
proteins in a polypeptide complex, that once translated, is are catalytically autoprocessed by 3CL/2PL
proteases, and assembled into a replicase-transcriptase complex with RNA-dependent RNA activity (RdRp).
At this point, several subgenomic mRNAs are produced by transcription and translated into structural (N, M,
E and S), non-structural and accessory proteins (AP), assembling new virions. These virus particles are
formed on smooth-walled vesicles located between the ER and the Golgi, named as ERGIC (Endoplasmic
Reticulum Golgi Intermediate Compartment). Once these vesicles fuse with the plasma outer membrane,
virions are released to continue infection (see fig 4).

3. Coronavirus.pro
3.1 Description
Coronavirus.pro is a module of Virus.pro, a C++ software application developed in modules that simulate
mainly RNA and DNA virus replication cycles: Ebola, HIV-1, HCV (Hepatitis C), CoV, HSV1 (Human Herpes
Virus), PV1 (Poliovirus 1, Mahoney) The software reproduces several virus cycle replication stages, from
attachment and fusion to virion exit from host-cell, focusing into more complex stages, such as subgenomic
mRNAs translation, protein synthesis and protease catalytic processing (see fig. 5 and 6).
Virus.pro contains a set of RNA/DNA databases and protein databases to scan viral genome and protein
sequences for recognized motifs, reconstruct secondary structures (helixes, stem-loops, palindromes,
mirrors) and identify RNA-protein interaction regions. The software is supported with other applications, as
Vienna RNA package, for bracket-dot notation and Varna for plotting (see fig. 7) [Gruber et al 2008, Darty et
al 2009]. The code contains also machine-learning algorithms, in which new virus, RNA/DNA sequences and
proteins can be included to the internal databases to future identifications and analysis. The software has
been validated with other bio-informatic tools, as Blastp or Swiss-Model [Altschul et al 1990, Camacho et al
2008, Waterhouse et al 2018, Ramos-Pascual 2019].

format (nucleotides list). Preprocessor supports genomes in formats: FASTA, EMBL, GenBank, Stockholm
1.0 and GCG (see fig 8).

3.2 Simulation of translation, protein synthesis and protease cleavage sites
Each subgenomic mRNA transcribed by coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is translated
into virus proteins by host-cell ribosomes. ORF1.1 and ORF1.2 in SARS-CoV, ORF1.1 to ORF1.4 in MERS-CoV
and ORF1.1 to ORF1.6 in 2019-nCoV encode a polypeptide chain of variable length, with a -1 programmed
ribosomal frameshift (PRF). This frameshift is followed by a pseudoknot structure located few nucleotides
downstream and is able to change reading frame -1 position backward, translating an alternative
polypeptide (pp1ab with frameshift). Frameshifting probability is approximately between 5-10%. In same
cases, translation starts after a leaky scanning (shunting) [Dinman 2012, Bock et al 2019] or Internal
Ribosomal Entry Site (IRES) [Bonnal et al 2003, Mokrejs et al 2006]
After this, viral proteases cleave with enzymatic activity these polypeptides at specific cleavage sites to
synthesize non-structural proteins [Kiemer et al 2004]. Protease cleavage sites are predicted depending on
protease family (aspartic, cysteine, metallo or serine protease) and through specific cleavage patterns
[Song et al. 2012] Coronavirus proteases are a papain-like (PL2pro) and a cysteine 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro)
synthesized from nsp3 and nsp5, respectively [Chen et al 2005].

9

Coronavirus.pro simulates proteolytic effect of coronavirus proteases PL2pro and 3CLpro though multiple
protease pattern sequences (table 3). Most of these sequences have been previously validated in some
research studies and others have been proposed by comparison with protein databases, as UniProt or NCBI,
and recursive simulations with the software [Kiemer et al 2004, Sulea et al 2006, Ramos-Pascual 2019].

Cleavage sites are identified with a coarse approximation in which each protease cleavage sequence (A)
scans through each protein aminoacid sequence (B). If ka and kb are respectively the amino acid length of A
sequence and protein B, protein is cleaved at positions with the highest Levenshtein distance, calculated as:
for (i = 1; i <= ka; i++) d[i][0] = i; for (i = 1; i <= kb; i++) d[0][i] = i;
for (i = 1; i <= ka; i++)
for (j = 1; j <= kb; j++)
c = 0;
if (a[i - 1] == b[j - 1]) { c = 0; }
else { c = 1; };
d[i][j] = min(d[i - 1][j] + 1, d[i][j - 1] + 1, d[i - 1][j - 1] + c)

4. Results and discussion
4.1 Virus identification: comparison with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV
Coronavirus.pro has been used with sequence MN908947 (Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus isolate
Wuhan-Hu-1, complete genome) This sequence is specific of the virus type that caused the outbreak in
Wuhan of Hubei province (China), the first infection focus (23-jan-2020), which has been named as 2019nCoV [NCBI database]
The code has been also applied to other coronavirus types, such as sequences NC004718 (SARS coronavirus,
complete genome) and NC019843 (MERS Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, complete genome)
[Snijder et al 2003, Moreno et al 2017], which have been taken as reference sequences. Other sequences
have been also applied to compare similarity with 2019-nCoV virus genome (see table 4)

4.2 Coronavirus RNA structure
4.2.1 Regulatory regions: 5’utr
Beta-coronaviruses have several stem-loop structures in the 5’utr region (SL1 toSL5C). The first
transcription regulating sequence (TRS-L) is placed around the same positions in all beta-coronaviruses
(SL3).
MERS-CoV presents a 5’utr region of 356bp, with a TRS-L without SL3. Stem-loop SL4b is only present in
2019-nCoV and MERS-CoV. Furthermore, there are several regulatory sequences (RS) with unknown
functionality. Stem-loops SL6 and SL7 are placed into the adjacent ORF1 coding region. [Yang and Leibowitz
2015, Madhugiri et al 2018]
SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV have a common 5’ utr region of approximately 300bp, with several negative
regulatory elements: NRE-I (IL-2R/EBS), NRE-II (Ap1) and NRE-III (Ap1) at positions 101/153/250 and
104/154/251, respectively. Stem-loop SL4b is absent in SARS-CoV, whereas in 2019-nCoV contains a
palindrome sequence (-UAAUUA//UAAUUA-) with an unknown function.
Figures 9 to 11 shows 5’utr regions in MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV coronaviruses, obtained
through bracket-dot notation from Vienna RNA package and plotted with Varna software.

4.2.2 Regulatory regions: 3’utr
Beta-coronaviruses have a short 3’utr region of approximately 100bp with a stem-loop of variable length
followed with a poly(A) tail. This stem-loop, in the case of MERS-CoV is 27bp, including other recognition
sequences, different as SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV coronaviruses, as presented in figure 12. The 3’ utr region
of these coronaviruses contains also a conserved pseudo-knot structure of approximately 55bp [Lin et al
1996, Yang and Leibowitz 2015, Peng et al 2016].

4.3 Protease cleavage sites
Coronavirus.pro has predicted all canonical protease cleavage sites in coronavirus polypeptides, from nsp1
to nsp16. Furthermore, the software has identified a protease cleavage site in spike glycoprotein precursors
(Sp) in all coronaviruses. This cleavage site splits spike precursors (Sp) into S/S0 proteins, where S0 is the
same protease fragment in both precursors.
Another cleavage site has been predicted in membrane protein (M) of 2019-nCoV virus, producing
fragments M1/M2 In the case of MERS-CoV nucleocapsid (N), the software has found two protease
cleavage sites, N1/N2 and N2/N3. In addition to these cleavage sites, the code has identified other protease
cleavage sites giving place to some hypothetical proteins, as nsp3a↓nsp3b, nsp8a↓nsp8b and
nsp13a↓nsp13b (see table 5). These cleavage sites must be discussed in detail and supported with other
methods.

4.4 Subgenomic mRNA
Most frequent transcription regulating sequence (TRS) in MERS-CoV is TRS2 (5’-acgaac-3’). MERS-CoV
transcribes 11 subgenomic mRNAs, with several ORFs translating polypeptide chains (ORF1.1 to ORF1.4)
and several fusion proteins [Li et al 2019].
ORF3b is translated with an Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES). Other ORF encode some proteins (AP8b,
AP7b, AP9b and AP14) with unknown transcription regulating sequences and functionality [Narayanan et al
2008]. ORF8b overlaps nucleocapside gene (N) and encodes an accessory protein AP8b, called AP9b in SARS.
Although it is not translated directly by any TRS, some studies have found antibodies specific to this protein
in both in vitro and in vivo samples [Sharma et al 2011]
Tables 6 and 7 present a summary of ORF and proteins identified with Coronavirus.pro in MERS-CoV.

SARS-CoV includes a transcription regulating sequence TRS which is not in MERS virus type, TRS3 (5’cuaaacgaac-3’), also present in 2019-nCoV. SARS-CoV has several accessory protein (AP3a, AP6, AP7a),
which are translated directly from mRNAs. In the case of AP6, although in some studies is named as nsp6, it
is not processed by any protease, as other non-structural proteins. Other proteins, as AP11 is only
characteristic from SARS-CoV. Furthermore, the shortest mRNA (ORF15), with a length of 263bp, translates
no significant proteins and has an unknown functionality. Tables 8 and 9 show open-reading frames (ORF)
and proteins (structural, non-structural, accessory and fusion) for SARS identified with Coronavirus.pro.

2019-nCoV coronavirus presents relative differences in transcription and subgenomic mRNAs translation
with other beta-coronavirus. This virus initiates transcription in 20 TRS sites, transcribing more types of
subgenomic mRNAs than SARS/MERS. 2019-nCoV synthesizes around 9 types of fusion proteins, which are
remarkably more than SARS/MERS coronavirus, and it is expected than the concentration of non-structural
proteins, specially nsp12 (RdRp), nsp3 (PL2pro) and nsp5(3CLpro) is also higher. This fact could be related
with the most severe health effects (toxicity) and highest infectivity on host patients than other
betacoronavirus.
Furthermore, 2019-nCoV transcribes a mRNA (ORF15), with the shortest length (374bp), with no significant
proteins encoded, as also present in SARS-CoV. Finally, 2019-nCoV virus translates another accessory
protein, AP12, specific of this virus type.
Table 10 and 11 shows open-reading frames (ORF) and proteins (structural, non-structural, accessory and
fusion) identified with Coronavirus.pro software in 2019-nCoV virus.

In general to all of these betacoronaviruses, there are several accessory proteins which expression in vivo
and in vitro has not been proved, and therefore its function is still unknown. It is the case of accessory
protein AP2 in SARS/MERS and AP2a/b in 2019-nCoV.
4.5 Coronavirus proteins
There are considerable differences between spike glycoproteins. For example, the number of spike
glycoproteins is variable with MERS and also between SARS virus types. KY417149 (SARS) virus sequence
encodes three spike glycoprotein precursors of different amino acid lengths (S1p, S2p and S3p), which later
are processed by virus protease into S1, S2 and S3 spikes, with a common fragment S0. In the case of,
NC004718 and AY278488 (SARS), it synthesizes two spike precursors (S1p and S2p), whereas 2019-nCoV
and MERS, only one is processed. Spike glycoproteins from the same virus, although having different
lengths, are estimated with a 100% identity, as observed from their identity matrices.
In the case of other proteins (N, M and E), it can be observed that this virus is more close related to SARS
than to MERS, as also discussed previously. However, it presents also around 10% differences with other
SARS, so it could be considered as a different virus type
All these proteins have been aligned with Clustal 1.2 to compare similarities [Higgins 1994, Brown et al
1998] (see Annex A for alignment details).
Table 12 compares structural proteins in these genome sequences of beta-coronaviruses.

2019-nCoV protein sequences have been compared with SARS/MERS, through a distance estimator,
calculated as id(%) = (1-d/L)x100, where d is the Levenshtein distance between both sequences and L is the
protein length of the SARS/MERS reference protein sequence. Although there are other distance
estimators (Needleman-Wunsch, Smith-Waterman, Damerau-Levenshtein), the Levenshtein distance is an
accurate estimator for high similar sequences.
In the case of MERS, no identity has been found in any protein (< 50%). Table 13 compares 2019-nCoV
proteins with several virus genome sequences of SARS-CoV. As observed, most of non-structural proteins
(nsp1, nsp3b and nsp5 to nsp16), accessory proteins AP7a/b and structural proteins M, N and E have the
highest percents of similarity (>70%), proving that this virus is more close related with SARS type than
MERS. Glycoprotein spike (S), most of accessory proteins (except AP7a/b, AP11 and AP14a) and nonstructured proteins nsp2 to nsp3a and nsp4 have low similarity (< 50 %), proving that those proteins are
characteristics of this virus type, and potential targets for specific vaccines and antiviral drugs. The fact that
non-structural proteins are similar to SARS, indicates that antiviral drugs could be effective also to this virus.

As 3CLpro (nsp5) and RdRp (nsp12) have >90% similarities with SARS, some antiviral drugs, such as protease
inhibitors or RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors could be effective to this virus type. Nevertheless,
further comparisons would be required, including other types of estimators.
5. Conclusions
Coronavirus.pro software provides an accurate and reliable simulation model of Coronaviruses replication
cycles: SARS/MERS/2019-nCoV. The code simulates transcription of subgenomic mRNAs, translation,
protease cleavage, protein synthesis and virus assembly, including all fusion proteins.
As a result of the analysis, 2019-nCoV can be identified as a beta-coronavirus type SARS-CoV virus with high
confidence, named SARS-CoV2, and it is consistent with other recent research analysis. Similarities have
been found in 5’utr and 3’utr regions, protease cleavage sites and amino acid composition of both
structural and non-structural proteins [Ceraolo and Giorgi 2020, Gorbalenya et al. 2020, Wu et al 2020]
However, there are still differences between both coronavirus (SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV), as the number
of spike precursors and accessory proteins.
Coronavirus.pro is able to identify virus type and family, comparing virus genome and proteins with protein
and RNA motifs databases. In this case, 2019-nCoV has been identified as a beta-coronavirus SARS in more
than 70% than with MERS. However several differences have been found with SARS/MERS. 2019-nCoV has
more transcription regulating sequences (TRS) interspaced in the genome and consequently, is producing
more subgenomic mRNAs and more fusion proteins during RdRp transcription, which could explain more
severe health effects and infectivity than SARS/MERS.
The software has identified those proteins characteristics of 2019-nCoV: Spike S, AP3a, AP3b, AP8, AP9b,
AP12 and AP14b and nsp2/3/3a, with similarity < 50 % with other beta-coronaviruses.
Coronavirus.pro has predicted also some accessory proteins in all beta-coronavirus which have not been
previously described, called AP2 in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and AP2a/AP2b in 2019-nCoV, respectively.
These proteins are encoded in the same genetic region as PL2pro protease (nsp3) and are translated before
ORF1.2 (SARS/MERS) and ORF1.4 (2019-nCoV). If they are expressed in vivo or in vitro is not clearly
understood, as they could be part of a leaky scanning/shunting mechanism.
The software has predicted some additional protease cleavage sites, giving place to some hypothetical
proteins, as nsp3a↓nsp3b, nsp8a↓nsp8b, nsp13a↓nsp13b, M1↓M2 and N1↓N2↓N3. These cleavage
sites must be discussed and supported in detail with other methods.
As a conclusion, Coronavirus.pro (2019-nCoV) is able to identify virus genomes and provides in short times
useful results (FASTA files of virus proteins and RNA secondary structures). Future research will be focused
in interactions between RNA and protein sequences and intracellular processes, fusion protein synthesis,
RNA packaging and virus assembly, as carried out before with HIV virus with Monte Carlo simulations.
These results will be applied to develop preventive actions (vaccines), diagnostic methods (real time RTPCR or ELISA tests), and antiviral drugs (fusion inhibitors, RdRp inhibitors or PL2pro/3CLpro protease
inhibitors).
