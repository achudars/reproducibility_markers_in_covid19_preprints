Introduction

Since the first cases occurred in Wuhan (China), Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused
by SARS-CoV-2 virus, has raised serious concern. The virus, which made the inter-species jump
to humans probably from bats through another intermediate animal host (Li et al., 2020c),
causes a severe respiratory syndrome characterized by a strong person-to-person contagiousness
via aerial route (Guan et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020a). Not surprisingly, SARS-CoV-2 has spread
throughout and outside of China in a short time following an uneven spreading pattern, despite
the severe control measures put in place in the Wuhan region. Italy is the second most affected
country in the World and the first in Europe, with 35 713 confirmed cases according to the
Italian Department of Civil Protection as of 18 March 2020. The reasons for Italy’s strong
involvement are not yet clearly identified, especially because it seems this was not the first
European country involved in the epidemic (Rothe et al., 2020). Furthermore, the spread of
COVID-19 in Italy has not followed a uniform pattern on the territory. After the first case
not directly connected with China has been discovered on 20 February 2020 in the province
of Lodi (north-west Italy), it has been possible to observe the diffusion of the disease in the
three northern regions of Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna. It took some days to record
contagions in other Italian regions, whether near or far, and even today that COVID-19 is
spread throughout Italy, some provinces are more affected than others. Currently, 17 713 out
of 35 713 confirmed cases (49·6%) came from Lombardy region, while Lombardy, Veneto and
Emilia-Romagna accounted for 25 452 cases (71·3%), as a whole. It took some days to record
contagions in other Italian regions, whether near or far, and even today that COVID-19 is
spread throughout Italy, some provinces are more affected than others.
Italian regions are extremely different to each other, especially between southern and northern regions, with the latter representing the industrial, economic and financial epicentre of the
country. Furthermore, on the northern Italian territory insists large flows of people coming
from other areas because of labour commuting, and also of people looking for a more efficient
healthcare, which is located right in the area where the virus is occurring with greater force.
These differences might have obvious in influences on the spread pattern of COVID-19. Strict
measures to prevent and contain the epidemic, including social distancing, closure of businesses
and schools, prohibitions of travel and going outdoor, were enforced starting from the cited regions and later applied to the entire country. It is therefore of striking importance to trying to
understand the contagion phenomenon and to predict its spatial diffusion as well as its temporal
trend.

Many scholars are trying to give a contribution to the problem, both in open online venues
and on scientific publications, debating about reproductive number, mortality distributed for age
and gender and, more in general, epidemic features, without neglecting to avail of mathematical
and statistical models. The main contributions use deterministic epidemiological models (see
Kucharski et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020a; Sun et al., 2020, among others), all focussing on
the time evolution of the phenomena, especially with predictive purposes. The prediction of
new infected, deceased and healed is certainly essential for health policy in order to estimate
the capacity of a health system to cope with the stress caused by a pandemic. Nevertheless,
in the recent literature the relevance of space in the diffusion of the COVID-19 is treated
only marginally (Chinazzi et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020b), although the importance of spatial
and spatio-temporal autocorrelation in epidemiology was already highlighted in the seminal
book by Cliff and Ord (1981). The authors show the effectiveness of statistical methods in
analyzing the incidence of some epidemics, such as e.g. measles in Cornwall, 1969–1970, cholera
in London in 1849 and tuberculosis and bronchitis in Wales, 1959–1963. In the last 20 years
spatial epidemiology has been evolving rapidly and it has found a great response in medical
applied research (for a recent review on methods and applications in the field, see Kirby et al.,
2017).
The importance of the space in the study of disease transmission, like all natural phenomena,
answers to the first law of geography (Tobler, 2020), for which everything is related to everything
else, but near things are more related than distant things”. Reformulating this concept, it could
be said that the phenomenon external to an area of interest affects what goes on inside. In light
of this, we found imperative to include a component that can account for spatial dependence
among areal units in the study of COVID-19 diffusion, in order to explain the strength and
direction of the spreading on the territory as well as in time. This is particularly relevant in
countries such as Italy or Germany in which the local health systems interested by the disease
are strongly regionalized. The territorial specificity, which can result in more or less drastic
containment measures, cannot be neglected in a model construction that has the ambition
to explain how the contagion moves in space and time and to allow reliable spatio-temporal
predictions.
The purpose of the present paper is to model and predict the number of COVID-19 infections,
drawing out the effects of its spatial diffusion. Forecasts about where and when the disease will
occur may be of great usefulness for public decision-makers, as they give them the time to
intervene on the local public health systems.

Methods

2.1

Data

The Italian Department of Civil Protection according with the Italian Ministry of Health, has
started to release a daily bulletin about COVID-19 infections in Italy since 26 February 2020.
By 3 March 2020 data were also released at NUTS-3 level (provinces),1 having been previously
released only at the highly aggregated NUTS-2 level. Data are available from the websites of
the main Italian newspapers, such as, Il Sole 24 ore.2 Therefore, immediately after the release,
we were able to collect the infectious disease count time series at provincial level for the period
1

NUTS (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) is a European Union geocode standard for referencing
the subdivisions of countries for statistical purposes, established by Eurostat in agreement with each member
state. The level of NUTS are four, nested into each other: NUTS-0 are the sovereign countries; NUTS-1 are the
major socio-economic regions; NUTS-2 are basic regions for the application of regional policies (Italian regions);
NUTS-3 are small regions for specific diagnoses (Italian provinces).

from 26 February 2020 to 18 March 2020 using two sources. Since spatial dependence may result
stronger than it actually is at a coarse spatial resolution (Arbia et al., 1996), we have wanted to
use data at the provincial level of aggregation, which is the freely available finest possible level
of aggregation. For the first six days, data were provided only to media outlets and published
by newspapers in the form of interactive maps. For this period, we have used web scraping
techniques to track raw data upon which maps have been constructed. For the remaining days,
we simply downloaded data about provinces released by the Department of Civil Protection.
Clearly, at this stage, data suffer from several problems of quality. The number of contagions
is continuously updated and positive swabs need to be confirmed by the National Institute of
Health, not to mention several cases of delayed reporting by the local authorities. Therefore,
the results presented in the paper may benefit from availability of more accurate data.
The overall temporal distribution of daily counts of COVID-19 infections is depicted in
Figure 1,3 while the spatial distribution is showed in the map in Figure 2. The two plots
indicate that while the growth of cases over time in Italy has been globally exponential, it is
characterized by strong local heterogeneity and also by a relevant spatial pattern in the form
of a hot-spot in the northern part of the country (the plot of the time series disaggregated for
all Italian provinces is reported in the Appendix).

2.2

Statistical analysis

The evolution of the number of daily infections is studied by means of a statistical model which
has been adapted from that proposed in Held et al. (2005) and Paul and Held (2011), where both
temporal dynamics of the infections and its geographical mechanism of spread are considered
and estimated (see Adegboye and Adegboye, 2017; Cheng et al., 2016, for an implementation
of the model in epidemiology).
The expected number of infections occurred in a province in the course of a day may be decomposed according to three additive components representing three different channels through
which the contagions may increase.
The first component of contagion is represented by the spread mechanism of the COVID-19
within each province, which depends on the cumulative incidence of the disease and determines
the speed of diffusion of the virus in the future. This component determines the temporal
dynamics of the contagion within each province and for this reason is referred to as epidemicwithin component (see Appendix).
Another channel is attributable to contagions originated from other provinces, and in particular from provinces which are geographically close to each other. The origin of such spatial
dimension of contagion can be found in the high mobility of people across provinces, and substantially contributes to explain the observed diffusion of the virus from a limited number of
focuses to a wider area which, at the time we are writing, heavily affects the most part of
northern Italy. In the following, this source of contagion is referred to as epidemic-between
component, as it concerns the inter-province spread of COVID-19 (see Appendix).
The last portion of cases should be attributed to province-specific conditions which determined the first centres of infections and the initial exposure to the risk of contagion. Such
a local component of the overall daily province infections is referred to as endemic component, according to terminology introduced in Paul and Held (2011), and which, in this context,
does not implies any epidemiological qualification of the COVID-19 in the population of Italian
provinces. We point out that in this paper both terms epidemic and endemic have been inherited from Paul and Held (2011), whereas terms within and between are introduced in order to

to as epidemic component.
The statistical model is structured in three parts which contribute to the number of daily
infections per province according to the three described components. Each part of the model
considers also the presence of heterogeneity both in the temporal and in the geographical mechanisms of contagion, so that the different dynamics existing inside the provinces, both in terms
of temporal and geographical mechanisms spread of COVID-19 are modelled.
All analyses presented in this paper were performed using the R software (R Core Team,
2018).

Results

The estimated model provides useful insights about the evolution and spread of COVID-19
occurrences across the territory of Italy. The most striking evidence is that the epidemic potential across areas is, on average, very strong; however, it is also highly heterogeneous among
provinces.
To better assess the degree of spatial heterogeneity, Figure 3 shows three maps depicting
the decomposition of the estimated expected number of infections into its three components
— namely the within-epidemic, between-epidemic and endemic contributions — by provinces.
For each province, the three fitted components are expressed as proportions of their sum. We
can clearly see that only few provinces, the most affected by the disease until now, are mainly
influenced by the local endogenous transmission of the contagion (map on the left). For a
relatively higher number of provinces, mostly located in the north and center parts of the
country, a relevant number of cases is instead explained by the transmission from neighboring
provinces (map on the centre). For the majority of provinces, located mainly in the south, the
contagions follow essentially the endemic trend (map on the right). The comparison among
provinces in terms of the three investigated components is robust to spuriousness because the
Italian population is entirely and homogeneously susceptible, that is immunologically “naive”, to
this new virus. Moreover, being vaccines still missing, there are no differences among provinces
deriving from vaccination coverage.
To gain further insights about the relative importance of the three components we take
into consideration some paradigmatic provinces located in the part of the country with the
highest number of cases, that is the northern areas (see Figure 4). In particular, we focus
the attention on the northern part of Italy because after the illness started to occur in the
country, it took several days to spread throughout the territory, thus leading to an unbalanced
spatial distribution of infections. Figure 5 depicts the mean number of cases estimated by
the model along with the observed number of cases for the paradigmatic provinces. First
of all, the province of Lodi (Lombardy region), which is the first area that reported cases,
sees a predominance of the component related to the internal diffusion of the disease. This
evidence agrees with the quarantine to which some of its municipalities underwent since the
beginning of the outbreak and with the hypothesis that the epidemic in Italy started right
there. The province of Lodi shares the eastern border with the province of Cremona (Lombardy
region), that in turn shares the northern border with the province of Bergamo (Lombardy
region) as depicted in Figure 4. The latter two are so far some among the most severely
affected provinces in Italy. Their proximity with the province of Lodi makes them widely
susceptible to the contagion effect between neighboring regions. This suggests that the contagion
of infections among inhabitants occurred before containment measures were carried out and
that the disease remained undetected before patient 1 was discovered. A similar situation arose
for the province of Parma (Emilia-Romagna region), which share the norther border with the

province of Cremona. Even here the between-epidemic component is relevant and it may be
explained with the strong social and economic ties existing among the areas. The second in
time discovered outbreak of COVID-19 in Italy was detected in a small town in the province
of Padova (Veneto region). Even in this case, strong control measures to reduce transmission
outside have been carried out, as evidenced by the almost total influence of the within-epidemic
component. This shows that there have been no “return infections” from the surrounding areas
but it does not mean that, before the quarantine, the infection could not have circulated in the
neighboring provinces. In fact, the province of Venice (Veneto region), which is geographically,
culturally and economically near to that of Padova demonstrates to be affected by these form
of interactions. The cases of the provinces near the national borders are also of particular
interest, such as the provinces of Turin (Piedmont region) and Trieste (Friuli Venezia Giulia
region), adjoining with France and Slovenia, respectively. These provinces may be affected
by the so-called boundary problem for which the analysis of a phenomenon may be biased
by the presence of arbitrary administrative geographic borders. Thus, on one side we might
lose information regarding what happens beyond the country border, due to different ways of
collect information and monitor the diffusion of the disease. One the other side, we might not
have a clear overview about cross-border phenomena as job trajectories. In addition, the two
considered provinces seem to be not connected with the aforementioned outbreaks originated in
Lombardy and Veneto regions. Due to these reasons, the provinces of Turin and Trieste show
a limited effect of epidemic components and a prevalence of the endemic component, which is
due only to the evolution of the disease over time. Looking at the national aggregated counts,
the exponential evolution of COVID-19 contagions is clear. On the country as a whole, the
main component seems to be the temporal trend but also the epidemic components have a not
negligible role. The observed decomposition is probably mainly due to the central and southern
provinces, which are characterized almost exclusively by the spread over time component.
Moreover, to check the ability of the proposed model in explaining the spatio-temporal
distribution of the COVID-19 occurrences in Italy, we examine how it is good at predicting the
future daily counts of infections. Therefore, we re-estimate the model using the data between
26 February 2020 – 17 March 2020 and we make prediction for 18 March 2020. The observed
total number of cases at 18 March 2020, obtained by aggregating the province data, is 4204;
the model provides a prediction of 4191 cases. Therefore, the model underestimates by only 14
units. Naturally, the advantage of the proposed model is that it provides predictions for each
individual province (point predictions can be found in Tables 2 and 3 of the Appendix) but it is
clear that the use of predictions at local level can have positive effects on the prediction of total
number at country level. We report (in Figure 2 of the Appendix) the 80% prediction intervals
of the provincial counts of infections at 18 March 2020. Given the brevity of the observed time
series, to obtain a reasonable degree of precision we cannot require higher confidence levels.
Despite the fact that the intervals are quite wide, the results are promising if compared with
the known observed counts. We expect that the level of precision will improve as the data are
updated and the observed time series become longer.

Discussion

In this article, we analyzed, by modelling, the trend of COVID-19 epidemics along time and
space. The use of spatio-temporal models can greatly improve the estimation of number of
infected and can help the public decision-makers to better plan health policy interventions.
Italy has viewed a massive spread of the disease with peculiar patterns on the territory. Started
from some provinces in the northern area, this serious illness descended down the Boot and is
nowadays present in all 107 Italian provinces. Several discrepancies among provinces, especially

between north and center-south of the country, persist but coming weeks seem to be decisive to
understand the behavior of the contagion trend. Containment measures in Italy have followed
an application in three steps: first, some municipalities in Lombardy and Veneto regions underwent to quarantine; second, the entire Lombardy and some provinces in other northern regions
(Veneto, Piedmont, Emilia-Romagna and Marche) were isolated from the rest of the country;
third, all Italian territories were subjected to a complete lockdown. Such stepwise approach
in imposing hard control measures to the entire national territory might have conducted to a
temporal shifting of the contagion dynamics.
Emblematic is the case of the province of Lodi, the first area submitted to the quarantine.
After an average increment of 85 cases when the illness began to be systematically discovered,
in the last 5 days of the time series, which correspond to three weeks after the lockdown, this
province seems to have settled the average number of newly discovered contagions equal to
42 cases (so the contagions have been halved). This fact suggests that policies of contagion
containment seem to exert a mild success so far in the areas in which there was an effective
enforcement of the control measures. Instead, in metropolitan areas where the population
density and the more active social behavior make more difficult to comply properly to the
recommendations, the whished effects are not yet taking place. This is the case of the province
of Milan, which is experiencing an increasing number of cases in last days (from an average
of 9 new cases detected of the beginning to an average of 273 new cases of last days). And
then there is the case of center and southern provinces, which have viewed a delayed start
8

of the epidemics but also the arrival, in the last two weeks, of flows of people escaped from
northern regions undergone to lockdown. As an example, the province of Florence went from
an average increment of 3 new cases of the first period to an average increment of 41 new cases
of last 5 days, and, similarly, the province of Naples, has gone from an average increment of
4 new cases to an average increment of 29 new cases, confirming the hypothesis of downhill
race of the disease along the peninsula. All this has led to the failure in applying homogeneous
measures at national level, also due to regional autonomy in force in Italy and to important
local differences, which may lead to delays or failures in containing the contagions from a global
point of view. This evidence suggests that consider the peculiarities of local territories may be
effective in planning specific strategies for enforcing the containment measures established at
national level.
These differences in the dynamics of the epidemics in Italy demonstrate the crucial importance of a strong national coordination level for the homogeneous enforcement of control
measures, but also reveal how essential predictions at local level are. Since the epidemics
started, a frequent question of the public decision-maker is about when the peak of contagions
will manifest. Probably a more appropriate request should concern the emergence of different
local peaks in different moments, which Italy should expect in next weeks. The dramatic events
in northern provinces can serve as a test bench for the health system, offering an overview about
what southern provinces might be confronted. Analyses and predictions both in space and time
offer a decisive perspective about which areas may be more affected and when, given the time
to the decision-makers to intervene on the local policies.

A

Statistical model

The data about the spatio-temporal distribution of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections at province level consist in multivariate count time series whose spatial references are
in the form of irregular spatial lattices. Therefore, the proper regression modelling framework
for this empirical circumstance is the class of the so-called areal Generalized Linear Models
(GLMs). By extending the seminal model originally introduced by Held et al. (2005), Paul and
Held (2011) proposed an endemic-epidemic multivariate time-series mixed-effects GLM for areal
disease counts, which proved to provide good predictions of infectious diseases (see Adegboye
and Adegboye, 2017; Cheng et al., 2016, among the others).
The main equation of the model describes the expected number of infections µr,t in a region
(province) r at time (day) t as follows:
X
µr,t = λr Yr,t−1 + φr
wr0 ,r Qr0 ,t−1 + er νr,t ,
(1)
r0 6=r

where Yr,t is the number of infections reported in the region r at time t, which follows a negative
binomial distribution with region-level overdispersion parameter ψr . If ψr > 0 the conditional
variance of Yr,t−1 is µr,t (1 + ψr µr,t ), while if ψr = 0 the negative binomial distribution reduces
to a Poisson distribution with parameter µr,t .
The three terms on the right-hand side of Equation (1) correspond to the three components
of the model: the epidemic-within, the epidemic-between, and the endemic.
The first component models the contribution of temporal dynamics of contagions to the
expected number of infections within region r. The term includes the number of infections
observed in the previous day (time t − 1), which affect µr,t depending on the value of the
coefficient λr > 0. As the notation suggests, λr changes amongst the provinces because of a
random effect which allows for heterogeneous behaviour in the dynamics of contagions.
The epidemic-between component models the contagion between neighbouring provinces by
0
including the average incidence of the infections Qr0 ,t−1 of provinces
P r which are neighbours of
province r. In particular, the coefficients wr0 ,r in the summation r0 6=r wr0 ,r Qr0 ,t−1 are positive
if either province r0 and r share a border or province r0 and r share a border with the same
province, whereas wr0 ,r is zero otherwise. The coefficient φr determines the magnitude of the
effect of inter-province spread of contagion, and changes amongst provinces according to the
population as well as to unobserved heterogeneity in the diffusion process.
The last component determine the province-specific contribution to the number of infections,
once the temporal and spatial autoregressive effect are accounted for. The term er is the
population of province r, whereas term νr,t consists of a national time trend component, and a
province-specific effect depending on the share of population over 65, and on a random effect
which catches the heterogeneity due to unobserved factors.
Paul and Held (2011) suggested that the endemic and epidemic subcomponents can be
modelled themselves through log-linear specifications:
> (λ)

log(λr,t ) = αr(λ) + β (λ) z r,t ,
log(φr,t ) =
log(νr,t ) =

> (φ)
αr(φ) + β (φ) z r,t ,
> (ν)
αr(ν) + β (ν) z r,t .

12

(·)

(·)

where the αr parameters are region-specific intercepts and z r,t represent observed covariates
that can affect both the endemic and epidemic occurrences of infections. The varying intercepts
allow to control for unobserved heterogeneity in the disease incidence levels across regions due,
for example, to under-reporting of actual infections (Paul and Held, 2011). Given the regionally
decentralized health system in Italy, non-negligible differences in case reporting of COVID-19
infections among Italian regions are very likely, which make the opportunity to have regionspecific intercepts very important. Following Paul and Held (2011) region-specific intercepts
can be obtained through the inclusion of random effects. In particular, we assume here that
iid

iid

iid

αr(λ) ∼ N (α(λ) , σλ2 ), and αr(φ) ∼ N (α(φ) , σφ2 ),

αr(ν) ∼ N (α(ν) , σν2 ).

The Paul and Held (2011) model with normally distributed random effects can be estimated
through penalized likelihood approaches that have been implemented in the R package surveillance (Meyer et al., 2017). See Paul and Held (2011) for futher details.

A.1

Epidemic-within submodel

Given the brevity of the observed time series, the epidemic-within autoregressive parameter is
assumed to be constant over time and, in absence of useful exogenous covariates, the model of
Equation (2) takes the form
log(λr ) = αr(λ) ,
that is, the “internal” infectiousness depends only on a spatially varying intercept.

A.2

Epidemic-between submodel

Following Meyer and Held (2014), the subcomponent model for the epidemic within autoregressive parameter, Equation (3), is here specified as
(φ)

log(φr,t ) = αr(φ) + β3 log er ,
which accounts for the fact that the regions may have different propensities to be affected by
the other neighbouring regions, and this may depend by their resident population share. The
rationale is that the more populated regions tend to be more susceptible to transmission across
regions.

A.3

Endemic submodel

Since some first recent empirical evidences suggest that the number of COVID-19 infections
seems to grow exponentially over time (Liu et al., 2020b; Maier and Brockmann, 2020), the
endemic component model assessing the temporal dynamic of disease incidence, Equation (4),
is specified as a second-order polynomial log-linear regression:4
(ν)

(ν)

(ν)

log(νr,t ) = αr(ν) + β1 t + β2 t2 + β3 log(ar ),
where t = 1, 2, . . . is the time in days and ar is the proportion of inhabitants over 65 years old.
In the global model of Equation (1) the endemic predictor νr,t is multiplied by the offset er ,
which in our case is the regional share of resident population.

We do not include higher-order terms to avoid the risk of introducing spurious endemic patterns and overfitting.
