Abstract: With a two-layer contact-dispersion model and data in China, we analyze the costeffectiveness of three types of antiepidemic measures for COVID-19: regular epidemiological
control, local social interaction control, and inter-city travel restriction. We find that: 1) inter-city
travel restriction has minimal or even negative effect compared to the other two at the national
level; 2) the time of reaching turning point is independent of the current number of cases, and
only related to the enforcement stringency of epidemiological control and social interaction
control measures; 3) strong enforcement at the early stage is the only opportunity to maximize
both antiepidemic effectiveness and cost-effectiveness; 4) mediocre stringency of social
interaction measures is the worst choice. Subsequently, we cluster countries/regions into four
groups based on their control measures and provide situation assessment and policy suggestions
for each group.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been recognized as a pandemic by the World Health
Organization in March 2020 (1). Nonetheless, on March 18, mainland China observed their first
day with zero increase of local cases since the outbreak (2). This indicates that, aside from the
imported cases, the pandemic has been locally close to the end. Many experiences and lessons
can be shared by the rest of the world from the trajectories of the outbreak and the control
strategies in mainland China. One question that is of particular importance is the costeffectiveness of different antiepidemic measures. Drawn from the Chinese experiences and
lessons, three categories of measures have been implemented: a) “regular” epidemiological
control and prevention measures, including identification of infected cases, tracing their close
contacts, and quarantines for both; b) In-city activity restrictions, including work-from-home,
shutdown of schools and public spaces, cancellation of events, and lock-down of residential
neighborhoods; c) Inter-city travel restrictions, including temperature screening at all
transportation terminals, cancellation of flights and trains, and eventually travel bans from/to
certain cities. Specifically, (b) and (c) are considered “irregular,” which contain the spread of
disease in an aggressive manner through the suppression of all possible social interactions.
However, these measures lead to enormous economic loss, which may mean higher
unemployment rates, and shortage of food, medical services, and other necessities. Those chain
effects may also endanger the lives of certain social groups. Fundamentally this is a trolley
dilemma, and the life and health of human beings can hardly be evaluated using monetary
values. Nevertheless, a comprehensive understanding of the cost of each measure—including the
opportunity cost of the shutdown economic activities—and the effectiveness of lifesaving can
still help policy makers to compare different antiepidemic strategies in a more operable way.
Further, with these insights, we can then perform a cross-sectional assessment of the situation of
the global antiepidemic campaign regarding the aforementioned measures in different
countries/regions, such that typical policies can be clustered and prescriptive policy suggestions
can be provided accordingly, which also echoes the argument in (3).
In prior research, scholars have used deductive models to find that the timing of lockdown, including both inter-city travel restrictions and social distancing, significantly changes the
size of infected population and the spatial extent of spread (4–7). Nonetheless, all prior research
only focused on specific instances of policies without discussing generalizable impacts of
different measures and lacked a cost-effectiveness assessment of each measure (8–10). In this
article, based on the transmission pattern of COVID-19 in China, we build a two-layer contactspread model (Fig. 1) to recover the whole spatio-temporal transmission process, especially the
early-stage numbers and distribution of cases at the prefecture level (see SM 1, 2, and 4). With
this model as a generalizable baseline, we conducted a comprehensive sensitivity analysis for all
antiepidemic measures (Fig. 2) and concluded the following assessment on the effectiveness of
the measures, in terms of number of infected cases, and number of infected cities.
1.
Containing daily social interaction, parameterized in the model as 𝜅! , 𝜅" for the
infected and the exposed populations, is the most effective measure for controlling both the
number of infected cases and the spatial extent of the spread. More specifically, we find that a)
the controls of 𝜅! and 𝜅" show comparable and substitutable effects in containing the spread of
disease, with different elasticity in different stages of the epidemic. Controlling 𝜅" is more
effective when the number of cases is small (e.g., fewer than 10 in a city), and 𝜅! is more
effective when the number of cases is sufficiently large. The implication is that at the early stage
of transmission, comprehensive epidemic surveys and contact tracing, alongside with strict
quarantine and social distancing, should be used to prioritize the reduction of the social
2

interaction levels of the exposed population (𝜅" ), while after the number of cases has increased
to a sufficiently high level, comprehensive testing and identification of all infected cases should
be prioritized in order to reduce the social interaction levels of the infected population (𝜅! ). b)
Stricter control of social interaction for both 𝜅! and 𝜅" have diminishing returns in reducing the
number of cases, but increasing returns in limiting the spatial extent of spread. For example, in
one month of simulation, when daily social interaction drops from 100% to 90% of the normal
level, the number of infected cases drops by 10%–25% (depending on the stage of epidemic),
while the number of cities with infected cases drops only by 0–1%; when daily social interaction
drops from 10% to 0, however, the number of cases drops only by 0.05%–0.5% for infected
cases versus 2%–35% for cities with infected cases. An exception is at the ending stage of the
epidemic, when controlling social interaction has increasing returns in both effects. c) The
effects of the epidemiological and social interaction control measures are monotonic for the
reduction of infected cases and the spatial extent of spread: the stricter they are enforced, the
lower number of infected cases and the narrower spatial extent of spread can be observed.
2.
The time of reaching turning point is independent of the current number of
infected cases but is only related to the stringency of epidemiological and social interaction
control measures, i.e., the relative change of 𝜅! , 𝜅" . When the two parameters are 1/4–1/3 of the
normal everyday values, the turning point comes in two weeks and the clearance of cases
happens in two to three months; when 𝜅! , 𝜅" are larger than 1/2–2/3 of the normal values, the
turning point will never come, i.e., the peak value of case numbers will remain the same as if
there are no such measures, but they only delay the time of peak.
3.
Except at the early stage and the ending stage, inter-city travel restriction has only
minimal effect on both the reduction of infected cases and control of disease spread in a city
network. Overall, compared with in-city epidemiological and social interaction control measures,
the contribution of inter-city travel restrictions to the reduction of the number of infected cases
and the spatial spread of disease is much smaller—lower by two orders of magnitudes. When the
number of cases is sufficiently large, inter-city travel restriction even exacerbates the situation
since it limits the social interaction of infected cases, and “condenses” 𝑅# locally (11). This
finding is consistent with that in prior research (12, 13). Therefore, to national or regional
governments who manage a city network, and to international antiepidemic collaboration, travel
restriction should only be regarded as an auxiliary measure at the beginning and ending stage of
the spread to protect cities which have not been infected at all, or only with a sufficiently small
number of cases. In the latter case epidemiological and social interaction control measures
should also be implemented simultaneously to get the health care system and other prevention
measures prepared.
The simulation-based formal analysis above is consistent with the empirical evidence in
China. The lockdown of Wuhan, and nationwide strict enforcement of epidemiological control
and social distancing policies around January 23, including the cancellation of all Chinese New
Near gatherings mark the key move of the antiepidemic campaign. At that time point, all other
cities in China were at early stages of the epidemic, which guaranteed the effectiveness of the
Wuhan travel ban. In addition, with aggressive social interaction control in all cities the turning
point of the number of cases arrived in two weeks outside of Wuhan. In Wuhan, the key move
was the functioning of 16 fāngcāng hospitals (mobile cabin hospitals) in early February which
enabled citywide comprehensive quarantine of the infected population (14). This measure
reduced the social interaction of infected cases to almost zero, and together with strict social
distancing they effectively reversed the trend of spread after two weeks. In terms of inter-city
3

travel restrictions, since they were during the Chinese New Year and the extended holidays, and
overlapped with social distancing measures, the net effect could not be easily isolated
empirically. Nonetheless, since mid-February the economy had re-opened. By the end of March,
the inter-city migration in southern and eastern Chinese cities had recovered to the same level as
in previous years (15), but most cities still observed almost zero increase of infected cases. This
further supports that the effectiveness of travel restriction is very limited for the cities with small
numbers of cases. Another evidence to support this point is the 300,000 people who left Wuhan
right before the lockdown night (16). This “escaped” population did not significantly change the
effectiveness of the national antiepidemic effort.
Further analysis on the cost-effectiveness of the measures shows more irregularity and
non-linearity, leading to more nuanced relationships (detailed in SM 5). Here we summarize the
most critical general patterns as follows:
1.
The measures which can achieve both high antiepidemic effectiveness (low
number of cases and narrow spatial spread) and high cost-effectiveness (smaller loss of
economic outputs) only exist at the early stage of transmission. At the early stage, if
epidemiological and social interaction control measures can be strictly enforced (sufficiently low
𝜅! and 𝜅" ), it is possible to keep the spread at a low level, with a loss of economic outputs only
up to 4%. The intuition is as follows: based on the assumptions of this article, the early-stage
measures only include comprehensive testing, close contact tracing, and quarantine, but do not
include indiscriminate restrictions of in-city social interaction and inter-city travel, which incurs
high costs. The policy implication is straightforward: for early-stage cities and regions, it is
critical to practice epidemiological control interventions, but not to necessarily mobilize the
whole society into social interaction reduction. This finding is consistent with the suggestions in
(6).
2.
Except for the early stage, it is impossible to simultaneously achieve both high
antiepidemic effectiveness and high cost-effectiveness. Except for a few “plateaus,” the
effectiveness of epidemiological and social interaction control measures monotonically increases
with the stringency of control measures. However, the cost and cost-effectiveness functions are
non-monotonic and there usually exists more than one peak (see details in SM 5), which in most
cases do not coincide with the effectiveness peak. Typically, the costs are the lowest when the
control measures are at sufficiently low or sufficiently high levels. While the latter case has been
explained in the last point, the sufficiently low control measure scenario basically leaves the
whole population to be infected.
Therefore, the tradeoff between sufficiently low and sufficiently high levels of control
measures depend on many technological factors, including the short-term and long-term capacity
of healthcare systems, long-term uncertainty of virus mutation, and development of vaccines, as
well as many non-technological factors, including the risk averse attitudes for the short term and
the long term, the mental discounting between short-term and long-term tradeoffs, and the
fundamental value judgement on the “value of lives,” the discussion of which are beyond the
scope of this article, and will be left for discussion at the end of this article.
3.
Lastly, although it is difficult to choose the optimal control strategy, the worst
choice is explicit: mediocre control of social interaction, e.g., social distancing with leakage.
This choice still incurs 20–60% loss of economic outputs, but only achieves 30–40% reduction
in the number of cases, an extent which is insufficient to overturn the epidemic curve. Except for
moderately delaying the spread of disease which may be taken advantage of to get the healthcare
system prepared, this strategy is the worst choice in all other dimensions.
4

With the formal results above, we can now perform a cross-sectional assessment of the
global situation of the antiepidemic campaign from a transmission-prevention policy perspective.
Among the three types of measures (epidemiological control measures, social distancing, and
travel restriction), we disregard the travel restriction measure as our results clearly show that it is
ineffective for most countries/regions under the current situation (we will discuss the exceptions
later). Rather, we use two datasets (17, 18) which codified the antiepidemic measures chosen by
countries/regions as of April 7 (due to the lack of testing data, we use Wuhan as a proxy for
mainland China), and for the countries/regions analyze the relationship of their two stringency
indices, 𝜅$ and 𝜅% , i.e., the activity levels of the infected and exposed populations, and the
respective effectiveness on the reduction of infected cases. Based on the stringency of the two
dimensions of antiepidemic measures, we can divide all countries/regions into three groups (Fig.
3), each with a different antiepidemic “strategy”: elimination, control, and delay. More than 100
countries/regions are not included because of the lack of data. We will also discuss the
implications of this fact.
1.
The “elimination” group: This group (up right corner of Fig. 3) consists of only a
few countries/regions, including mainland China (represented by Wuhan), Hong Kong SAR,
Vietnam, UAE, Bahrain, etc., all with 𝑅# ≪ 1, such that the epidemic could be expected to dwarf
within a reasonably short time period. Mainland China is the most prominent example of this
group, where aggressive measures have been taken on both dimensions to reduce the activity of
the infected population as well as the exposed population. The measures include effective
epidemiological control interventions, such as comprehensive testing and close contact tracing,
and also aggressive social distancing measures, such as shutdown of schools, workplaces, and
public transport, cancellation of events, and mass disease control education. These measures
incur 40%–90% loss of economic outcome in a month, and the loss accumulates as the epidemic
is not completely “eliminated”. Obviously, the underlying value judgment of the elimination
strategy is an overwhelmingly high weight on health and lives over any cost-control or costeffectiveness reckoning.
Although the treasuring for lives is always respectable, long-lasting economic tightening
also constitutes a threat to society, especially to the disadvantaged social groups. Due to the
existence of asymptomatic carriers, false-negative test results, and international imports of cases,
a complete elimination of the epidemic is extremely difficult. Thus, if the aim is to literally
eliminate all cases, the economic losses are highly likely to accumulate to an unbearable level.
Therefore, we suggest that countries/regions which have followed the elimination strategy
consider turning to the “control” strategy (elaborated below) to avoid excess economic losses on
the condition that the active number of infected cases has been reduced to a sufficiently low
level. We also suggest that these countries/regions keep the travel restriction measures—the most
effective measure at this stage of the epidemic indicated by our simulation results.
2.
The “control” group: This group includes South Korea, Singapore, Qatar,
Norway, Slovenia, Russia, and New Zealand, etc., all with 𝑅# < 1, but still not sufficiently small,
such that the epidemic can be reduced to a lower level (but not eliminated), depending on the
stringency of intervention measures. The Singapore in February was the most prominent
example within this group, where antiepidemic measures have been mild enough not to affect
everyday life by aggressive social distancing. Through regular epidemiological control practices,
they were managed to maintain a daily increase of infected cases fewer than 10, and only
suffered 0.5%–4% loss of economic outcome in a month. The control strategy requires a highly
capable epidemic control system. Given the aforementioned long-term uncertainties, even with
5

such a capable system, the strategy is still a tightrope-walking game with the risk of abrupt
system overload by accidentally untracked surges of infection, which, unfortunately, appears to
be the case in Singapore in early April. Under such circumstances, a timely turn to the
“elimination” strategy may be necessary.
3.
The “delay” group: All other countries/regions in Fig. 3 belong to the third group,
which appears to follow the “delay” strategy, with 𝑅# > 1, such that the epidemic will continue
to grow. This is often referred to as the “flatten the curve” strategy, which aims not to reduce the
epidemic to an as-low-as-possible level within a short period of time, but only to delay its growth
through mediocre epidemiological control and social distancing measures. Our results show that
this is usually the worst scenario in terms of cost-effectiveness. A country/region may opt to this
strategy because their tradeoff between short-term certainty (economic loss avoidance) and longterm uncertainty (possible disappearance of the epidemic in the summer, development of
vaccines, etc.) leans towards the former. Unless they have strong evidence to justify the tradeoff,
we strongly suggest they reconsider. Moreover, our results show possible directions to
improve—enhancing the social interaction control for the infected population through more
comprehensive testing or enhancing the social interaction for the exposed population through
stricter social distancing measures, whichever sees fit based on the location of the country/region
on Fig. 3.
4.
Rest of the world: More than 100 countries/regions do not appear in Fig. 3 due to
the lack of data, most of which are third-world countries/regions. Although little information is
available to us about the situations in these places, we conjecture that they may at this moment
be pursuing cost-effectiveness of their antiepidemic interventions because of their limited
availability of resources, which we call the “worth every penny” strategy. As our results show
that the most cost-effective measures are usually neither the most effective one (actually they are
usually very ineffective), nor the least costive ones, the “worth every penny” strategy is not a
good option either. If a country/region opts to this scenario solely because of the lack of
resources, it should be viewed as a humanitarian disaster, and we call for international aid in this
situation.
At the end, we acknowledge the extreme difficulty of even trying to lay out the
comparison between human lives and economic activities, or the tradeoffs of lives between
different social groups. We believe that the ethical discussion should be open to the whole
society and hope that this article can contribute to the discussion.

A Spatial-Temporal Explicit SEIR (STEx-SEIR) Model
Classical SEIR model characterizes the dynamics of the susceptible, exposed, infected, and
removed population, assuming a certain population size and transmission rate. In closer scrutiny,
the fixed transmission rate assumption requires contact-based transmission process (19). From
the perspective of spatial interaction, this requirement is contradictory to the prior assumption of
fixed population. Due to the high mobility of modern society, fixed population requires a large
spatial scale of the model, e.g., the national scale. Moreover, contact-based assumption is valid
only at the scale of human daily activities—such scale should not exceed the urban scale to
incorporate multiday intercity travels.
At a larger spatial scale, human activity is featured by the “return–explorer” dichotomy
(20). The former spreads outbreaks through daily contact, while the latter “diffuses” the
epidemic through long-distance travels. The order of magnitude of the intercity long-distance
migration can be massive in China, and related studies have also discussed the effect of this
population flow on the spread of COVID-19 outbreak (8, 9, 21, 22). Thus, the COVID-19
outbreak is actually subject to a “contact-spread” two-step transmission process. Therefore, the
classic SEIR model is insufficient to accurately describe the epidemic dynamics in the urban
network and needs to be expanded.
Thereupon, we constructed a series of SEIR models for all cities, coupled with an intercity
network. The node-edge structure of the model corresponds to the above-mentioned contactspread process; and the required data (epidemic parameters of each city, and intercity spatial
interaction) are relatively simple. Here, the choice of appropriate spatial resolution is critical. On
the one hand, while prior research have adopted similar model design, they conducted the
analysis mostly at the provincial resolution (5, 23, 24). According to the analysis above, the
provincial level is not the best choice to reflect the intercity-spread mechanism. On the other
hand, at too fine spatial scales, such as 1 km-grid, township, or census blocks, modeling results
can hardly be verified due to the lack of data, and random errors can be large. Attempting to
make a compromise between simplicity and completeness, interpretability and prediction
accuracy, data spatial accuracy and verifiability (25–27), we took cities (administratively called
prefectures in China) as the unit of analysis and built a model which we call the SpatialTemporal Explicit SEIR Model (STEx-SEIR). This model can not only be used to analyze the
number of infected cases, spatial range of infection, and dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak,
but can also be used to reveal the arrival time of the first case in each city. We calibrate the
model with Chinese case statistics. Although it does not cover the entire globe, it is still
informative to other countries since China has gone through the whole process of the epidemic.
1.1

Model Assumptions
The STEx-SEIR model relies on the following assumptions: 1) Intra-city population is
homogeneous, i.e., it is a “meta-population,” which is a common practice in the absence of real
demographic data; 2) Omitting the impact of foreign imports and exports of COVID-19 cases:
the proportions of imported and exported cases during the COVID-19 outbreak in China are
extremely small and can be omitted over the study period. 3) Virus remains unmuted: although a
very large number of mutations have been recorded (28), the transmission patterns of the virus
have not noticeably changed so far.

1.3 Model Calibration
1.3.1 Model Initialization
The case data used in this article come from the national and provincial health commissions
in China (29). Wuhan is the city hit hardest by the epidemic, accounted for 61.87% of the total
number of cases. The number of cases in Hubei province other than Wuhan accounted for
another 22.03%. Therefore, Wuhan and Hubei Province have very different medical conditions,
prevention and control measures from other cities and provinces in China. Thus, we assigned
different initial parameters for Wuhan, other cities in Hubei, and cities in other provinces. The
initial number of cases in Wuhan was set to be 1, and the initial numbers in other cities in Hubei
and in other provinces was set to be 0.
According to the national report, the first confirmed infected case in Wuhan can be traced
back to December 8, 2019. Thus, we chose December 8, 2019 as the starting point for the
simulation. According to other studies (30), this date is as close as possible to the real starting
point of the pandemic, and epidemiological data are only available from this point to calibrate
model.
The endpoint of model calibration is February 26, when the epidemic in China was almost
over and the model has converged by that time. We will simulate the spread of the COVID-19
epidemic from that date until the end of April as verification and prediction (by the time of
writing this article).
1.3.2 Baseline Calibration
We used Chinese national, provincial, and municipal reports as the baseline to calibrate our
model, so that the fitted number of cases would match with the surveyed data. On the one hand,
the assumption, based on case statistics, is reliable. Reports are released separately by more than
300 cities nationwide and updated daily. Panel data from different provinces are inter-validated
with other and are also supported by data from other sources (e.g., total mortality rate of the
population, or mortality data of similar symptoms such as influenza, pneumonia, etc.). Thus, it is
extremely unlikely that the data are fabricated continuously without being noticed. On the other
hand, research shows that due to delayed diagnosis at the early stage of outbreak, the actual onset
date of most confirmed cases is actually one week ahead of the report date (30, 31). Considering
the incubation period, we pushed the outbreak curve from the reported dates backwards by a few
days, thus yielding the baseline for model calibration.
1.3.3 Parameter Values
The calculation and initial values of 𝑁, 𝛼, 𝛽3 , 𝛽4 , 𝛾, 𝜇, 𝜐, 𝜃" , 𝜅! , 𝜅" , and ∆𝑁 were articulated
in Section 4 of the Supplementary Material.

2. Effectiveness and Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Antiepidemic Measures
2.1 Control Measure Categorization
Among the three basic dimensions of epidemic control (control of the source of infection,
cutting off transmission, and protection of the susceptible), we focus on the transmission cuttingoff dimension. Specific measures belonging to this dimension can be further divided into three
categories: 1) “regular” epidemiological control Measures; 2) in-city social interaction control
and 3) intercity travel restrictions. These measures can be directly mapped to the three key
parameters 𝜅! , 𝜅" , and ∆𝑁 (denoted as TL henceforth) in the STEx-SEIR model (Table S1), and
thus empower the quantitatively evaluation of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of various
scenarios.
2.2

Epidemiological Control Measures
Regular epidemiological control measures include thorough epidemiological surveys, close
contact tracing, and quarantines of all the infected individuals and their close contacts as early
and as possible—especially the close contacts, who may be potential carriers. These measures
are reflected in the model by tuning the values of 𝜅! and 𝜅" .
It is noteworthy that the limits of the effectiveness of regular epidemiological control
measures:
• It is very difficult for the close-contact tracing and quarantines to be exhaustive, so they
cannot reduce 𝜅" to 0, indicating an effectiveness “roof”;
• Close contact tracing is a tedious work and is heavily manpower dependent. Given that
the epidemiological control system in regular practice usually has limited capacity. Under
outbreaks the system could be overloaded and becomes dysfunctional. Under these
circumstances, more aggressive measures are needed to reduce 𝜅" .
2.3

In-city Social Interaction Control Measures
In-city social interaction control measures include work-from-home, shutdown of schools,
workplaces, public transit, and public spaces, cancelation of public events, lockdown of
residential neighborhood, etc. The effects of these measures are to reduce the chance of close
contact between the infected/exposed and susceptible individuals, and are represented in the
model by the values of 𝜅! and 𝜅" , especially 𝜅" , with contributions of different measures
aggregated to a final value. We collected the measures adopted in different prior papers and
coded them to estimate the final values of 𝜅! and 𝜅" . It needs to be noted that the effects of
specific measures are clearly overlapping with each other. For example, when social distancing
both at the work and home ends are effectively implemented, the marginal “contribution” of an
additional control on public transit usage would be minimal. Also, despite of the nominal public
orders, the actual stringency of the measures could be flexible in practice. For simplicity, we
utilize expert knowledge to estimate the overall efforts, i.e., the values of 𝜅! and 𝜅" .
2.4

Intercity Travel Restrictions
Intercity travel restriction includes suspending inter-provincial and intercity buses, trains
and flights, closing highways and roads, etc. The purpose is to reduce the intensity of personnel
exchanges across cities, thereby reducing the transmission of the infected/exposed individuals.
This is represented in the model by the reduction of spatial interaction parameter TL, or ∆" and
∆! .

2.5

Evaluating Effectiveness of Antiepidemic Measures
In this paper we use two indicators to evaluate the effectiveness of disease control
measures: the number of infected cases, and the spatial extent (represented by the number of
cities with infected cases).
2.5.1 Number of Infected Cases
Minimizing the total infected population is a self-explanatory goal from the perspective of
epidemic control. Since E will eventually be converted to I with a fixed probability, we only need
to focus on the infected population I and use the relative change of I over the simulation period
(one month) as one indicator of effectiveness.
Effect )! =

𝐼$ (𝑡 + 30) − 𝐼$ (𝑡)
× 100%
𝐼$ (𝑡)

The total antiepidemic effect in all cities is the summation:
Effect ! = 2 Effect )!
$

2.5.2 Number of Cities with Infected Cases
Aside from the total number of infected cases, the spatial extent of the epidemic is also an
indicator worth noticing. If the epidemic can be contained within a narrow spatial extent, the
medical resources in other cities can be diverted to the infected cities to help, which actually
happened in China where medical teams across the country were sent to Wuhan for support. We
also use the relative change of the number of cities with infected cases during the simulation
period (one month) to quantify the effect:
Effect 5! =

𝐶$ (𝑡 + 30) − 𝐶$ (𝑡)
× 100%
𝐶$ (𝑡)

The total effect in all cities is the summation:
Effect 6 = 2 Effect 5!
$

2.6

Cost of Antiepidemic Measures
We used the opportunity cost of economic output as the indicator for the cost of the
antiepidemic measures. For simplicity, we only used the work-hour loss as a proxy for the
economic output loss and did not convert it to monetary values of goods and services.
2.6.1 Cost of Travel Restriction
Travel restriction leads to reduction in the total number of personnel exchanges between
cities. In particular, the outbreak of COVID-19 in China overlapped with the Spring Festival
holidays, and travel restriction apparently caused the migrant workers who previously travelled
back hometown not be able to return to cities where they had worked after the holidays. While
the impact on economic output is affected by factors such as the productivity difference between
the migrant workers and local workers, we can use wages as a proxy for productivity and
estimate the differences (32–34).
6

Calculations show that the average income of migrant workers in 2017 was 100.36% of that
of the local workers, or roughly the same, so we do not need to adjust for the differences in the
model1. Therefore, this study ignores the role of the above factors. Factors such as employment
elasticity, which are more difficult to estimate, are also omitted for simplicity. Therefore, the loss
of economic output of city i at time t from travel restriction is:
Inter_Cost $ (𝑡) = (𝑁_normal$ (𝑡) − 𝑁$ (𝑡)) × 𝜅" _𝑛ormal$ (𝑡)
where 𝑁_normal is the urban population in the normal status, approximated by the number of
urban populations in the same period last year, and 𝜅" _normal is the 𝜅" in the normal status.
2.6.2 The Cost of In-city Social Interaction Control Measures
For those who are not affected by the intercity travel restriction, we argue that the
indiscriminately implemented in-city social interaction control measures reduce their intensity of
social interaction, which in turn reduces their productivity and thus reduces the economic output.
More specifically, we used 𝜅" and 𝜅! as the proxy for productivity.
It should be noted that lower 𝜅" or 𝜅! is not necessarily the result of indiscriminate
suppression of daily interactions but could also be the result of regular epidemiological control
measures. A distinction needs to be made between these two situations. It can be reasonably
assumed that when the number of the infected cases is small. For example, the daily increase of
the number of infected cases does not exceed a certain threshold, the goal of reducing 𝜅! and 𝜅"
can be achieved solely by regular epidemiological control measures. Therefore, a rational
administration will choose not to opt to universal in-city social interaction control measures to
avoid collateral loss. What is lost in this case is the output of only those who have been
quarantined, i.e., the exposed and infected cases.
We admit that it is extremely difficult to estimate such a threshold, which could be highly
dependent on specific contexts such as governance capability, the resourcefulness of the
epidemic control system, and cultural and geographic factors. Although, a numerical estimation
would still be of help. There was no opportunity to observe this threshold during the outbreak in
China: in the early stage of the epidemic (before January 23, 2020), no effective epidemic
control practices were taken outside of Wuhan, and after January 23, the country had generally
turned to aggressive and universal antiepidemic measures and it is difficult to separate the net
effect of the each epidemic control measure. However, the Singapore situation in January and
February may constitute a good example, where in most cases daily reported new infected cases
were under 10. Another remark is that the Chinese government sets a threshold of 3 cases for
reporting a newly discovered epidemic to the national CDC. In light of these numerical example,
we use 10 daily new infected cases as an estimate of the capacity threshold value. Therefore, the
loss of economic output of city i at time t from in-city social interaction control measures is set
as follows.
Intra_Cost / (𝑡) = Y

𝑆$ (𝑡) × Z𝜅" _normal$ (𝑡) − 𝜅" $ (𝑡)[ ,

𝛼𝐸$ (𝑡) > 9

(𝑁$ (𝑡) − 𝑆$ (𝑡)) × (𝜅" _normal$ (𝑡) − 𝜅" $ (𝑡)),

1

𝛼𝐸$ (𝑡) ≤ 9

The monthly wage level of the migrant population is from the result of the “2017 China Migrant Population
Dynamics Monitoring Survey.” There are 170,000 samples, which are nationally representative. The calculation
process uses weighted PPS sampling. The average urban wage is calculated by weighting the employment based on
the urban private and non-private wage level.
7

2.6.3 Comprehensive Cost Function
For straightforwardness, we convert the economic output loss into to a relative value: the
proportion of the output with regard to that of the baseline (the normal situation). The total
output loss ratio of city i during the entire simulation period is
Cost $ =

∑789#(Inter_Cost $ (𝑡) + Intra_Cost $ (𝑡))
× 100%
∑789#(𝑁_normal$ (𝑡) × 𝜅" _normal$ (𝑡))

and the ratio of total output loss of all cities during the entire simulation period is:
Cost =
2.7

∑$ ∑789#(Inter_Cost $ (𝑡) + Intra_Cost $ (𝑡))
× 100%
∑$ ∑789#(𝑁_normal$ (𝑡) × 𝜅" _normal$ (𝑡))

Comprehensive Cost-effectiveness of Antiepidemic Measures
In summary, the comprehensive cost-effectiveness function of antiepidemic measures is:
Effect !
Cost
Effect 6
Cost/Effectiveness6 =
Cost
Cost/Effectiveness! =

Particularly, if Cost = 0, it is stipulated that both Cost/Effectiveness! , Cost/Effectiveness6
equal to 0.
2.8

Scenario Design for Epidemic Control Measures
For simplicity, we only calculated the cost and cost-effectiveness functions at the national
level (the entire city network). To discover any initial value-dependence of the cost and the costeffectiveness functions, we ran the simulation at different stages of the epidemic. Based on the
calibrated model, five scenarios with the following starting and ending dates are set:
•
•
•
•
•

Early Stage: December 31, 2019–January 29, 2020
Accelerating Stage: January 16, 2020–February 15, 2020
Peak/Inflecting Stage: February 5, 2020–March 5, 2020
Declining Stage: February 28, 2020–March 28, 2020
Ending Stage: March 16, 2020–April 14, 2020

The model is run for 30 days for each scenario, and five indicators are calculated: number of
total infected cases, number of cities with infected cases, overall cost, effectiveness/cost ratio
with respect to the number of infected cases, and effectiveness/cost ratio with respect to the
number of cities with infected cases.
We calculated the gradient function of the five indicators with respect to 𝜅" , 𝜅! , and TL to
analyze the structure of the solution space. For simplicity, we calculate the gradients discretely at
the following points: 𝜅! = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}; 𝜅" = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16}; TL =
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, where the five levels of TL correspond to 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1 times of the
8

normal intercity travel level. Note that the lowest level of TL is not 0. This is because according
to the situation in China (given by Baidu Migration Data), when the TL is the lowest, the travel
level is still about 20% of the normal level, and we believe that the stringency of intercity travel
restriction in reality cannot be greater than this level. In contrast, aggressive in-city social
interaction control measures can reduce the values of 𝜅" and 𝜅! to levels very close to 0.

3.

Antiepidemic Situation Assessment of Countries/Regions
We evaluated the antiepidemic situation of countries/regions based on the stringency of
activity control policies of the infected and exposed, i.e., the degree of which 𝜅! and 𝜅" are
reduced. This takes 3 steps: 1) codifying policies and computation of the stringency indices; 2)
mapping of the stringency indices into values of 𝜅! and 𝜅" ; and 3) assessment of the
antiepidemic situation based on the results of our analysis.
3.1

Codifying Policies and Computing Stringency Indices
For the exposed, effective activity control measures include close-contact tracing and social
distancing. For the computation of the stringency of these measures, we used the data and
method provided by the Oxford COVID-19 government response tracker (17), and computed and
compiled the exposed activity control stringency index with six indicators: school shutdown,
workplace shutdown, public events cancelation, public transport shutdown, public information
campaign, and close-contact tracing.
For the infected population, quarantine is the most important measure to reduce their
activities, which but also requires testing in the first place. We therefore used the
comprehensiveness of testing as the proxy for the infected activity control stringency. As testing
policy coding from the aforementioned source is rather coarse, we instead designed an
alternative index based on two indicators: tests per 1 million population, and the ratio between
cumulative cases and the number of total tests. The compiled index is gained through dividing
the first indicator with the second, logarithmically transforming the quotient, and finally
normalizing the result to the 0-100 range to match that of the exposed population’s activity
control stringency index. The logarithmic transformation is used only for visualization purposes,
as very few countries/regions have much higher original indices. For the testing data, we
employed sources from www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/. It should be noted that as
mainland China does not publish testing data, we used the data from Wuhan as a proxy.
For both indices, we use the data as of April 7. A total of 99 countries/regions are present in
the final dataset.
Mapping of the stringency indices into 𝜿 values, and division criteria of the three
strategy groups
Analysis results show that there exist two threshold values for both 𝜅! and 𝜅" that
correspond to the “elimination” (R0 << 1) and “control” (R0 < 1) strategies, as shown in Table S2.
It should be noted that the effects of the two indicators are substitutable, with the elasticity of 𝜅!
to be larger.
For the mapping from 𝜅! to the respective stringency index of a specific measure, it is clear
that the mapping should not be linear because of the non-linear transformations we have done.
We therefore employed an estimation method based on expert knowledge: to achieve 2/3
3.2

9

reduction of 𝜅! which is required to “eliminate” the epidemic, it is needed to quarantine as many
infected cases as possible. Considering that about 1/3 to 1/2 infected cases are asymptomatic
(35), this roughly means that all symptomatic cases should be tested. Based on the statistics from
Wuhan and South Korea, this requires the tests per 1 million population to be greater than
10,000, and the ratio between the number of cumulative cases and total tests to be smaller than
5%.
Converted from the above estimation to the respective stringency index, the value is around
70. We thus used this value as the boundary between “elimination” and “control”. Following
similar methods, we estimated that the boundary between the “control” and “delay” policy
groups to be around 60.
For the mapping from 𝜅" to the respective stringency index, because all six indicators’
contribution to the actual stringency level are roughly equally weighted, we simply conducted a
linear mapping between the composite stringency index and 𝜅" . Thus, the stringency index
boundary between the “elimination” and “control” groups is 75, and that between “control” and
“delay” is 50.
4. Data Processing and Parameter Estimation
4.1 Estimation of Epidemiological Parameters
Epidemic parameter estimation is the first and fundamental step in the SEIR model. In
previous studies, choices of these parameters usually adopted mathematical interpretation, such
as the inverse of the incubation period or infectious period (7, 23) and thus the numbers are not
physically interpretable. However, if we consider the actual characteristics of COVID-19 as
shown in epidemiological studies, the ambiguity of the model can be greatly reduced. We
estimated these parameters based on real-world data, considering errors caused by possible
concealment, omission, and late reports.
4.1.1 Transmission Rates from Susceptible to Infected (𝜷𝑰 ) and Exposed (𝜷𝑬 )
We used close contact tracing data after January 28 to estimate 𝛽! , since statistical data in
the early stage showed fluctuation due to the lag of reactions from the government. In the
equation following, 𝐼(𝑡) indicates the number of newly confirmed cases in a day. And 𝐶(𝑡)
indicates the number of close contacts who are still under medical observation in the same day.
We averaged 𝛽! (𝑡) with regard to t and got 0.01986, so we set 𝛽! to 2%.
𝛽! (𝑡) =

𝐼(𝑡)
𝐶(𝑡)

In addition, we considered COVID-19 to be infectious in the later stage of the incubation
period: there is no evidence of weaker infectivity during the incubation period, and it is assumed
that it can be as infectious as during the infected period, indicating 𝛽" = 𝛽! = 2%. The
incubation period is generally 2-14 days, and 3-7 days in most cases. The median incubation
period is 4 days. Assuming infectivity in the 1-3 days before the end of the incubation period,
with an average of 2 days, the ratio of infectious exposed people (𝜃" ) can be calculated as
follows
𝜃" =
10

𝐸d<
𝐸e

where 𝐸d< is the average infectious day of the exposed, and 𝐸e is the median of the incubation
period.
4.1.2 Ratio of Exposed Cases Turning to Infected Cases: 𝜶
According to the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program (Second
Edition), suspected cases are those with similar clinical symptoms as infected people. If a
suspected case tests positive for nucleic acid test or its viral gene sequencing is highly
homologous with SARS-CoV-2, it is diagnosed as a confirmed case.
Considering the relationship between suspected and confirmed cases, the ratio between new
confirmed cases to existing suspected cases is recorded as the ratio of the exposed cases
becoming infected cases. This index is a characteristic of the disease itself and is generally the
inverse of the incubation period from the mathematical interpretation. Therefore, it should be
uniform for all cities. This parameter has converged since January 28 and the average value is
0.1404 (14.04%).
Because of the presence of asymptomatic infections, only considering suspected cases can
lead to overestimation. Since asymptomatic infections accounted for 1.2% of confirmed cases,
we scaled up the suspected cases and the revised 𝛼 to be 13.87%.
4.1.3 Mortality Rate
According to the Epidemiology Working Group of the Chinese Center for Disease Control,
at least 104 cases existed in Hubei Province in December 2019, spread in fourteen counties. By
January 10, 2020, there were 757 cases and 102 deaths in 113 cities of 20 provinces. However, in
the national epidemic reporting system, the first death was not reported until January 20 in the
whole country except Wuhan. Therefore, we took the results (Table S3) published by the
Epidemiology Working Group and calculated the mortality rates in different regions at each
stage (Table S4).
We fitted the mortality rates with the following functions:
Wuhan:
𝜈 = 2.337𝑒 =3.33?8 − 4.942𝑒 =4.#?@8
Hubei province except Wuhan:
𝜈 = (2.337𝑒 =3.33?8 − 4.942𝑒 =4.#?@8 ) ∗ 0.69
Mainland China except Hubei province:
𝜈 = 0 , 𝑡 < 𝑡A/2B(
l
𝜈 = 0.05046𝑡 =4.CDE , 𝑡 ≥ 𝑡A/2B(
where 𝑡A/2B( indicates January 1, 2010, which means that there were no deaths in any region of
China except Hubei province in December 2019. The above fitting all passed the goodness-of-fit
tests.
4.1.4 Recovery Rate
Recovery rate is closely related to the capacity of local medical resources and city
governments’ responsiveness, so we conducted parameter fitting for each city. It is reasonable to
believe that the number of cured cases published is reliable since there is no obvious reason for
concealing recovery.
11

Therefore, the recovery rate is calculated as the ratio between newly cured cases and existed
confirmed cases. The recovery rate has changed significantly by time. Taking Wuhan as an
example, the abrupt outbreak led to a lack of medical resources at the beginning. Then, aid
resources from all over the world were sent to Hubei province. In addition, Huǒshénshān and
Léishénshān Hospitals were built quickly to treat patients in severe conditions. These efforts
contributed to the improvement of recovery rates (7). To capture the time-wise changes, we fitted
piecewise functions to the recovery rates based on the characteristics of each stage.
Among the different stages, the early recovery rate in Wuhan fluctuated too heavily to fit, so
we took the average value in the period as an indicator of the recovery rate.
The specific fitted functions are as follows:
Mainland China except Hubei province:

4.2

Estimating Parameters of Social Interaction Intensity
Close contact tracing is a common epidemiological control measure, especially when early
treatment is not clear, and when vaccines are not available. This approach can identify
potentially infected individuals, quickly isolate them before they turn to severe patients, and
prevent the occurrence of secondary transmission (36).
Social interaction intensities of the exposed and infected individuals are denoted as 𝜅" and
𝜅! respectively in our model. These two parameters are highly related to local population
densities. Considering that the COVID-19 outbreak occurred during the Chinese New Year, the
intensity of social interaction was significantly higher than usual.
Wuhan, as China's large transportation hub, may have a higher per capita social interaction
intensity than other cities. To address this, we used the contact rate of the infected population
during SARS (maximumly 12) as the initial value of 𝜅! (37).

12

In general, the behavior of the exposed population is less restricted than the infected, so we
assume that the maximum contact rate of the exposed is twice as high as that of the infected,
which means that the maximum 𝜅" is 24.
According to the local epidemic reports, the initial values of 𝜅! and 𝜅" in each area can be
obtained (Table S5). Then, based on the local control policies and response time, we adjusted the
contact values at different stages. In January 20, 2020, Zhong Nanshan announced that there was
a risk of human-to-human transmission of COVID-19, and some people in Wuhan began to
consciously reduce their activities. Until the citywide lockdown, the number of cases surged, and
people began to realize the severity of the situation. Then, strategies such as business shutdown,
school shutdown, stay-at-home notices, and community shutdown were gradually implemented
throughout the country to avoid contact between the susceptible and the infected population.
In the late stage of the epidemic, numerous prevention and control strategies, including
hospitalizing all confirmed cases and isolating all suspected cases, have greatly reduced the
values of 𝜅! and 𝜅" (Figs.1 and 2).
4.3

Urban Population and Human Interaction Data
The initial value of each city’s population in our model is that on December 8. Then, the
population changed after the New Year migration, which can be calculated through the spatial
interaction matrix.
Our research includes 368 prefectures in mainland China, with the time span from
December 1, 2019 to April 30, 2020. The data collected included migration data from the Baidu
Migration Map (15), statistical yearbooks, and local COVID-19 reports. The original Baidu
migration data is consisted of migration flows of 91,788 city pairs among 368 cities from January
1, 2020 to February 26, 2020.
Since there was no news of the COVID-19 outbreak in December, the intensity of social
activities was not affected and remained the same as normal workdays. In March and April after
the outbreak, we assumed that due to the impact of the travel restrictions in most cities, residents’
travel remained at a very low level.
Therefore, the migration data for December was set to be the same as an average workweek
from January 6, 2020 to January 12, 2020, and the intercity migration after February 26 was set
to be the same as between February 17 to February 23. In addition, the numbers of COVID-19
cases in our model and population data for the 368 cities were collected from the National
Bureau of Statistics of China (38) and the National Health Commission of China’s reports.
4.4

Codifying Local Epidemic Control Policies
We collected the publicly announced epidemic control policies of all prefectures in China
from January 23 to February 20. This dataset includes about 4,000 documents, among which 364
were issued at the provincial level. We codified the policies into 6 categories: one for longdistance travel restrictions, and the other five for in-city social interaction control measures
(Table S6). We further translated the policies into their control stringency in terms of social
interaction reduction based on expert evaluation on the policy terms as well as enforcement level
inferred from media coverage. We lastly mapped the codified policies to the values of 𝜅! and 𝜅"
(Figs. 1 and 2).

5. Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Specification
5.1 Early Stage: December 31, 2019 to January 29, 2020
5.1.1 Effectiveness of Antiepidemic Measures
In the baseline (real-world) model, the initial number of cases at this stage was 53 and
increased to 7,780 after 30 days. The initial number of infected cities were 23 and increased to
301 after 30 days.
In terms of the reduction of infected cases, the decreases of the three coefficients, 𝜅! , 𝜅" ,
and TL all have positive effects, but the effects are non-linear—with all returns diminishing
marginally. The marginal contribution of 𝜅! and 𝜅" are roughly comparable and also
substitutable, with that of 𝜅" slightly higher when the level of social interactions is high (i.e., the
values of 𝜅! and 𝜅" are high, or close to the ordinary level, which is 9 for 𝜅! and 16 for 𝜅" ), and
that of 𝜅! higher when the level of social interactions is low (as low as 0). However, the marginal
contribution of 𝜅! and 𝜅" are both 2-5 times higher than that of TL in most cases, and the latter is
only significant when the values of 𝜅! and 𝜅" are both very low. When 𝜅! ≤ 3 and 𝜅" ≤ 4, the
number of infected cases will shrink, and will be reduced to 0 after approximately two months
(Table S7).
In terms of the reduction of number of cities with infected cases, the decreases of the three
coefficients, 𝜅! , 𝜅" , and TL all have positive and non-linear effects, but with increasing returns
marginally. The marginal contribution of 𝜅! and 𝜅" are roughly comparable and also
substitutable, with that of 𝜅" slightly higher when the level of social interactions is high, and that
of 𝜅! slightly higher when the level of social interactions is low. However, the marginal
contribution of 𝜅! and 𝜅" are both 1–2 times higher than that of TL in most cases, and the latter
is only significant when the values of 𝜅! and 𝜅" are both very low. When 𝜅! ≤ 3 and 𝜅" ≤ 4, the
number of cities with infected cases will shrink, and will be reduced to 0 after approximately two
months.
5.1.2 Cost-Effectiveness of Antiepidemic Measures
Since there was no baseline control at this stage, any change in the three coefficients means
tighter control on social interactions, and hence a cost to economic output.
First, the marginal contribution from the reduction of TL to the cost function is
approximately 2–5 orders of magnitude lower than that of 𝜅! and 𝜅" such that its impact is
mostly negligible.
Second, the cost function has a ridge along the direction of (𝜅! = 9, 𝜅" = 12) and (𝜅! = 0, 𝜅"
= 16). The global gradient between the ridge and (𝜅! = 0, 𝜅" = 0) is moderate, and a lowest
plateau appears when 𝜅! ≤ 6 where the value of the cost function is 0. On the other side, the
global gradient is much steeper, with a minimal value of the cost function that is also 0 at the
corner. The global cost peak appears at (𝜅! = 9, 𝜅" = 12), at which point the peak cost slightly
exceeds 4% of the total output.
In terms of cost-effectiveness, as the peaks and trends of the cost function and two effect
functions are different, the two cost-effectiveness functions show greater non-linearity. In terms
of the cost-effectiveness with respect to the reduction of the number of infected cases, two local
peaks exist. One is at the “strictest control” point i.e., (𝜅! = 0, 𝜅" = 0), when each 0.3% reduction
in the number of infected cases is associated with 1% of economic output cost within a month;
another peak occurs at the “non-control” point i.e., (𝜅! = 9, 𝜅" = 16), when each 1.7% reduction
in the number of infected cases is associated with 1% of economic output cost within a month.
14

However, in the latter case, there will be no reduction in the number of infected cases at all
according to the respective effectiveness function, while the former case coincides with the
effectiveness peak. In terms of the cost-effectiveness with respect to the reduction of the number
of cities with infected cases, situations are similar, only that a third peak appears at (𝜅! = 0, 𝜅" =
16), which is also a hardly effective solution. Overall, the best solution considering both
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in whichever terms at this stage of epidemic is at the
“strictest control” point (Fig. S3).
5.2 Accelerating Stage: January 16, 2020 to February 15, 2020
5.2.1 Effectiveness of Antiepidemic Measures
In the baseline (real-world) model, the initial number of cases at this stage was 1,059 and
increased to 8,920 after 30 days. The initial number of infected cities were 178 and increased to
310 after 30 days.
In terms of the reduction of infected cases, the decreases of the three coefficients, 𝜅! , 𝜅" ,
and TL all have positive effects, but the effects are non-linear—with all returns diminishing
marginally. The marginal contribution of 𝜅! and 𝜅" are roughly comparable and also
substitutable, with that of 𝜅" slightly higher when the level of social interactions is high (i.e., the
values of 𝜅! and 𝜅" are high, or close to the ordinary level, which is 9 for 𝜅! and 16 for 𝜅" ), and
that of 𝜅! higher when the level of social interactions is low (as low as 0). However, the marginal
contribution of 𝜅! and 𝜅" are both up to two orders of magnitude higher than that of TL in most
cases, and the latter is only significant when the values of 𝜅! and 𝜅" are both very low. When 𝜅!
≤ 3 and 𝜅" ≤ 4, the number of infected cases will shrink, and will be reduced to 0 after
approximately two months (Table S8).
In terms of the reduction of number of cities with infected cases, the decreases of the three
coefficients, 𝜅! , 𝜅" , and TL all have positive and non-linear effects, but with increasing returns
marginally. The patterns of marginal contribution of the three coefficients are similar with the
“reduction of infected cases” case and we do not elaborate here.
5.2.2 Cost-Effectiveness of Antiepidemic Measures
First, the marginal contribution from the reduction of TL to the cost function is
approximately 2–4 orders of magnitude lower than that of 𝜅! and 𝜅" such that its impact is
mostly negligible.
Second, the cost function has a ridge along the direction of (𝜅! = 9, 𝜅" = 4) and (𝜅! = 0, 𝜅"
= 16). The global gradient between the ridge and (𝜅! = 0, 𝜅" = 0) is moderate and roughly linear,
and a lowest plateau appears when 𝜅! ≤ 3 and 𝜅" ≤ 4 (the “strictest control” scenario) where the
cost is a small number (2%–4%). On the other side, the global gradient is much steeper with
increasing margins, with a minimal value of the cost close to 0 at the corner (the “non-control
scenario). One noteworthy character of the cost function is that the value of 𝜅! does not affect the
position of the peak, but affects its value: keeping 𝜅" the same, each 10% reduction in 𝜅! reduces
the cost function by 2%–4%. The global cost peak appears at (𝜅! = 9, 𝜅" = 4), or a “loose
control” scenario, at which point the peak cost exceeds 40% of the total output. The intuition is
that in this case, the control on social interactions is not sufficient to reverse the trend curve of
the epidemic, and after the number of infected cases exceeding a certain threshold (the capacity
“roof” of regular epidemiological measures to contain the epidemic), cities have to opt to a
universal control on everyday social interactions to contain the epidemic, inflicting heavy loss on
economic output.

15

The global gradients of the cost-effectiveness function for both effectiveness metrics show
similar patterns with the previous stage, only with more non-linearity, which is too complicated
to be elaborated here. For more details, refer to Fig. S4.
5.3 Peak Stage: February 5, 2020 to March 5, 2020
5.3.1 Effectiveness of Antiepidemic Measures
The baseline model witnessed the turning point of the epidemic, when the initial number of
cases at this stage was 10,345 and reduced to 1,913 after 30 days. The initial number of infected
cities were 314 and reduced to 253 after 30 days.
In terms of the reduction of infected cases, the decreases of 𝜅! and 𝜅" both have positive
effects, but the effects are non-linear—with all returns diminishing marginally. The decrease of
TL, however, have varying directions of effect dependent on the values of 𝜅! and 𝜅" , with
negative effect when both 𝜅! and 𝜅" values are high and positive otherwise. The marginal
contribution of 𝜅! and 𝜅" are roughly comparable and also substitutable, with that of 𝜅" slightly
higher when the level of social interactions is high (i.e., the values of 𝜅! and 𝜅" are high, or close
to the ordinary level, which is 9 for 𝜅! and 16 for 𝜅" ), and that of 𝜅! one order of magnitude
higher when the level of social interactions is low (as low as 0). However, the marginal
contribution of 𝜅! and 𝜅" are both up to two orders of magnitude higher than that of TL in most
cases, and the latter is only significant when the values of 𝜅! and 𝜅" are both very low. When 𝜅!
≤ 3 and 𝜅" ≤ 6, the number of infected cases will shrink, and will be reduced to 0 after
approximately two months. Higher values of 𝜅! and 𝜅" (looser control on the level of social
interactions) will not be sufficient to reverse the epidemic trend curve. And at the non-control
scenario, the number of infected cases will grow to approximately 200,000, or 20 times the
number at the beginning of the baseline scenario (Table S9).
In terms of the reduction of number of cities with infected cases, the decreases of the three
coefficients, 𝜅! , 𝜅" , and TL all have positive and non-linear effects, but with increasing returns
marginally. The patterns of marginal contribution of the three coefficients are similar with the
“reduction of infected cases” case and we do not elaborate here.
5.3.2 Cost-Effectiveness of Antiepidemic Measures
First, the marginal contribution from the reduction of TL to the cost function is
approximately 2–4 orders of magnitude lower than that of 𝜅! and 𝜅" such that its impact is
mostly negligible.
Second, the cost function has a ridge along the direction of (𝜅! = 9, 𝜅" = 0) and (𝜅! = 2, 𝜅"
= 16). The global gradient between the ridge and (𝜅! = 0, 𝜅" = 0) is moderate, and the lowest
cost at the corner (the “strictest control” scenario) is a small number (2%–4%). On the other side,
the global gradient is much steeper, with a minimal value of the cost function close to 0 at the
corner (the “non-control scenario). Again, the value of 𝜅! does not affect the position of the peak
but affects its value: keeping 𝜅" the same, each 10% reduction in 𝜅! reduces the cost function by
8%–9%. The global cost peak appears at (𝜅! = 9, 𝜅" = 0), or a “loose control” scenario, at which
point the peak cost exceeds 90% of the total output.
The global gradients of the cost-effectiveness function for both effectiveness metrics show
similar patterns with the previous stage, only with more non-linearity, which is too complicated
to be elaborated here. For more details, refer to Fig. S5.
5.4 Declining Stage: February 28, 2020 to March 28, 2020
5.4.1 Effectiveness of Antiepidemic Measures
16

In the baseline model, the initial number of cases at this stage was 3,886 and reduced to 22
after 30 days. The initial number of infected cities were 288 and reduced to 1 (Wuhan) after 30
days.
In terms of the reduction of infected cases, the decreases of 𝜅! and 𝜅" both have positive
effects, but the effects are non-linear—with all returns diminishing marginally. The decrease of
TL, however, have varying directions of effect dependent on the values of 𝜅! and 𝜅" , with
negative effect when both 𝜅! and 𝜅" values are high and positive otherwise. The marginal
contribution of 𝜅! and 𝜅" are roughly comparable and also substitutable, with that of 𝜅" slightly
higher when the level of social interactions is high (i.e., the values of 𝜅! and 𝜅" are high, or close
to the ordinary level, which is 9 for 𝜅! and 16 for 𝜅" ), and that of 𝜅! 4 times higher when the
level of social interactions is low (as low as 0). However, the marginal contribution of 𝜅! and 𝜅"
are both up to 1 order of magnitude higher than that of TL in most cases, and the latter is only
significant when the values of 𝜅! and 𝜅" are both very low. When 𝜅! ≤ 9 and 𝜅" ≤ 10, or 𝜅! ≤ 6
and 𝜅" ≤ 12, the number of infected cases will shrink, and will be reduced to 0 after
approximately two months. Higher values of 𝜅! and 𝜅" (looser control on the level of social
interactions) will not be sufficient to reverse the epidemic trend curve. And at the non-control
scenario, the number of infected cases will grow to approximately 10,000, or three times the
number at the beginning of the baseline scenario (Table S10).
In terms of the reduction of number of cities with infected cases, the decreases of the three
coefficients, 𝜅! , 𝜅" , and TL all have positive and non-linear effects, with increasing returns
marginally at most times except when the values of 𝜅! and 𝜅" are both very low—a noteworthy
character that is different with the symmetric accelerating stage. Another noteworthy character of
the effectiveness function is the occurrence of plateaus when 𝜅! ≤ 9, where the change of 𝜅" and
TL will not affect the spatial scope of the epidemic.
5.4.2 Cost-Effectiveness of Antiepidemic Measures
First, the marginal contribution from the reduction of TL to the cost function is
approximately 2–4 orders of magnitude lower than that of 𝜅! and 𝜅" such that its impact is
mostly negligible.
Second, the cost function has a ridge along the direction of (𝜅! = 9, 𝜅" = 10) and (𝜅! = 0, 𝜅"
= 10). The global gradient at both sides of the ridge drops close to 0 with increasing margins and
plateaus when 𝜅! is sufficiently low or high. Again, the value of 𝜅! does not affect the position of
the peak, but affects its value: keeping 𝜅" the same, each 10% reduction in 𝜅! reduces the cost
function by 5%–8%, and when 𝜅! < 6, a plateau occurs where cost is minimal. The global cost
peak appears at (𝜅! = 9, 𝜅" = 10), or a “loose control” scenario, at which point the peak cost
exceeds 20% of the total output.
The global gradients of the cost-effectiveness function for both effectiveness metrics show
similar patterns with the previous stage, only with more non-linearity, which is too complicated
to be elaborated here. For more details, refer to Fig. S6.
5.5 Ending Stage: March 16, 2020 to April 14, 2020
5.5.1 Effectiveness of Antiepidemic Measures
In the baseline model, the initial number of cases at this stage was 267 and reduced to 1
after 30 days. The initial number of infected cities were 99 and reduced to 1 (Wuhan) after 30
days.

17

In terms of the reduction of infected cases, the decreases of the three coefficients, 𝜅! , 𝜅" ,
and TL all have positive effects, but the effects are non-linear—with all returns diminishing
marginally. The marginal contribution of 𝜅! and 𝜅" are roughly comparable and also
substitutable, with that of 𝜅" about two times higher at all times. However, the marginal
contribution of 𝜅! and 𝜅" are both up to one order of magnitude higher than that of TL in most
cases, and the latter is only significant when the values of 𝜅! and 𝜅" are both very low. When 𝜅"
≤ 12, or 𝜅! ≤ 6 and 𝜅" ≤ 14, the number of infected cases will shrink, and will be reduced to 0
after approximately two months. Higher values of 𝜅! and 𝜅" (looser control on the level of social
interactions) will not be sufficient to reverse the epidemic trend curve (Table S11).
In terms of the reduction of number of cities with infected cases, the decreases of the three
coefficients, 𝜅! , 𝜅" , and TL all have positive and non-linear effects, this time all with decreasing
returns marginally – a noteworthy character that is different with the symmetric early stage.
Plateaus also exist at this stage, when (𝜅! , 𝜅" ) is to the left (smaller) side of (6, 0)–(0, 8), where
any further change of the coefficients will not affect the spatial scope of the epidemic.
5.5.2 Cost-Effectiveness of Antiepidemic Measures
At this stage, the shape and value of the cost function are both dominated by 𝜅" . They
decrease monotonically and roughly linearly along with the direction of 𝜅" ’s decline, and the
effects of 𝜅! and TL are very small.
At this stage, the epidemic at the baseline has come to an end. Although the initial number
of cases is roughly equivalent to the initial stage of the epidemic, the strict control at the previous
stages has led to a significant reduction in the number of the exposed population. Therefore, the
cost function at this time is dominated by 𝜅" , and the peak value of the cost function is only
0.5% of the output, a great reduction compared to those in the previous three stages.
Since the lift of controls on social interactions will help restore economic output, the peak
cost-effectiveness at this stage all occurs when all controls are lifted, at which time economic
output will be very close to the normal level (when there is no epidemic). The second highest
cost-effectiveness peak appears when the controls are maintained (given the number of infected
cases, the controls now are realized predominately through effective epidemiological measures,
rather than universal containment of social interactions), where the maximum loss of economic
output is about 0.5%. While the former appears tempting, in the long run (about two months
later) it is likely to cause a rebound in the epidemic (we only run the simulation for one month,
so this effect cannot be directly observed in the model. However, the situation is similar to the
initial period of the epidemic, and thus the lift of controls is just equivalent to starting the entire
epidemic from the beginning, such that a second outbreak is inevitable if other conditions remain
unchanged). The latter, on contrary, appears to achieve a good balance between cost and
effectiveness within this study’s analytical framework (Fig. S7).
