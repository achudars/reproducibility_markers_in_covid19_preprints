ABSTRACT

KEYWORDS

Today, we are all threatened by an unprecedented pandemic: COVID19. How different is it from other coronaviruses? Will it be attenuated or become more virulent? Which animals may be its original
host? In this study, we collected and analyzed nearly thirty thousand publicly available complete genome sequences for COVID-19
virus from 79 different countries, the previously known flu-causing
coronaviruses (HCov-229E, HCov-OC43, HCov-NL63 and HCovHKU1) and the lethal, pathogenic viruses, SARS, MERS, Victoria,
Lassa, Yamagata, Ebola, and Dengue. We found strong similarities
between the current circulating COVID-19 and SARS and MERS, as
well as COVID-19 in rhinolophines and pangolins. On the contrary,
COVID-19 shares little similarity with the flu-causing coronaviruses
and the other known viruses. Strikingly, we observed that the divergence of COVID-19 strains isolated from human hosts has steadily
increased from December 2019 to May 2020, suggesting COVID-19
is actively evolving in human hosts. In this paper, we first propose
a novel MLCS algorithm HA-MLCS 1 for the big sequence data (with
sequence length over 103 ) analysis, which can calculate the common model for COVID-19 complete genome sequences to provide
important information for vaccine and antibody development. Geographic and time-course analysis of the evolution trees of the
human COVID-19 reveals possible evolutional paths among strains
from 79 countries. This finding has important implications to the
management of COVID-19 and the development of vaccines and
medications.

INTRODUCTION

Since its first report in December 2019, the severe infectious pneumonia caused by the new COVID-19 virus has spread widely from
the Wuhan City, across China, and to 188 countries. On March
11, 2020, the WHO announced COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic,
the first of its kind since the 2009 Swine Flu. Internationally, as
of May 29, 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in more
than 5,851,494 cases and 361,270 deaths2 . COVID-19 is currently
the biggest health, economical and survival threat to the entire
human race. We are in urgent need to understand this virus, find
treatment and develop vaccines to combat it.
One challenge in developing effective antibodies and vaccines
for COVID-19 is that we do not yet understand this virus. How far
away is it from other coronaviruses? Has it undergone any changes
since its first discovery? These questions are critical for us to find
cures and design effective vaccines and medications, and critical
to manage this virus. The study of COVID-19 began only recently
[1–6]. So far, pioneering studies related to the virus have been limited to a few COVID-19 complete genome sequences (COVID-19
sequences/strains/viruses for short) and a few related viruses [7].
One study used six COVID-19 sequences from patients in Wuhan
and compared them with those of SARS and MERS [8]. Another
two studies used nine and five sequences respectively, and found
that COVID-19 is similar to SARS [9, 10]. Recent work [11] studied the emergence of genomic diversity and recurrent mutations

in COVID-19 by using 7666 public genome assemblies. These pioneering efforts laid the foundation for our work. In this paper,
we collected nearly thirty thousand complete genome sequences,
covering 29,305 genomes isolated from COVID-19 in human hosts
from 79 countries, 21 genomes from animals and the environment
(outside the human bodies), 101 genomes from the four previously
known flu-causing coronavirus, and 61 genomes from the seven
potentially lethal pathogenic viruses. This collection allows us to
analyze the evolution and diversity of COVID-19 in depth. Note
that, in this paper all computations/analyses are done using only
the collected COVID-19 complete genome sequences.
In this paper, we report strong shared similarity between the currently circulating COVID-19 and the SARS virus, as well as strong
shared similarities with COVID-19 in rhinolophines (especially with
two strains) and in pangolins. On the contrary, COVID-19 shares a
moderate sequence similarity to the four flu-causing coronaviruses,
despite reported similar symptoms. Strikingly, we observed the
divergence of COVID-19 strains isolated from human hosts steadily
increased from December 2019 to May 2020, suggesting COVID-19
is now actively evolving in human hosts. This may potentially explain the differences in the death rate in different areas, as the virus
might have evolved into strains of different lethality. Importantly,
in this paper we first proposed a novel MLCS algorithm for the
big sequences analysis, which can calculate the common model
(common subseuqneces) for COVID-19 sequences and provide important information for future studies of vaccine and antibody
design. Evolutionary analysis of the human COVID-19 from 79
countries reveals the following important discoveries: As early as
Dec. 2019, the COVID-19 virus was widespread in many countries and
regions, and it is particularly worth noting that the entire genome
sequences of the top 15 countries with the most severe epidemics,
except Russia and Spain, almost do not reside in the first generation
on the evolution tree from 79 countries’ sequences, which is of great
significance to the traceability of COVID-19. Moreover, the other
findings by big sequences analysis in this paper may also provide
important information to the understanding and the management
of COVID-19 and to the development of vaccines and medications
for the virus in the near future.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses
our proposed novel MLCS (Multiple Longest Common Subsequence)
algorithm HA-MLCS for COVID-19 big sequence data similarity
analysis. The big data analysis results for COVID-19 strains are
reported in Section 3. Section 4 concludes the paper.

2 A MLCS ALGORITHM HA-MLCS
2.1 Preliminaries
MLCS Problem. We define a subsequence of a given sequence
over a finite alphabet Σ as a sequence obtained by deleting zero
or more (not necessarily consecutive) characters from the given
sequence. Let 𝑋 = 𝑥 1𝑥 2 ...𝑥𝑛 and 𝑌 = 𝑦1𝑦2 ...𝑦𝑚 be two sequences
with lengths 𝑛 and 𝑚, respectively, over a finite alphabet Σ, i.e.,
𝑥𝑖 , 𝑦 𝑗 ∈ Σ. The goal of the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
mining problem is to find all longest common subsequences of 𝑋
and 𝑌 . Similarly, the goal of the MLCS problem is to find all longest
common subsequences from 𝑑 (𝑑 ⩾ 3) sequences of equal length 𝑛
or different lengths. LCS is a special case of MLCS.

The MLCS problem is a classical NP-hard problem [12], which is
related to the identification of sequences similarity and to the common model extraction between sequences. It has many important
applications in bioinformatics, computational genomics, pattern
recognition, etc. Based on the adopted method, existing MLCS algorithms can be classified into two categories: dynamic programming
based and dominant-point based exact or approximate algorithms.
(1) Dynamic Programming Algorithms. Given two sequences
𝑋 = 𝑥 1𝑥 2 ...𝑥𝑛 and 𝑌 = 𝑦1𝑦2 ...𝑦𝑚 with lengths 𝑛 and 𝑚, respectively,
over a finite alphabet Σ with 𝑋 [𝑖] = 𝑥𝑖 , 𝑌 [ 𝑗] = 𝑦 𝑗 , 𝑥𝑖 , 𝑦 𝑗 ∈ Σ,
1 ⩽ 𝑖 ⩽ 𝑛 and 1 ⩽ 𝑗 ⩽ 𝑚, a dynamic programming algorithm
iteratively constructs a (𝑛 + 1) · (𝑚 + 1) score matrix 𝐿, where 𝐿[𝑖, 𝑗]
is the length of an 𝐿𝐶𝑆 between two prefixes 𝑋 ′ and 𝑌 ′ of 𝑋 and 𝑌 .
Once the score matrix 𝐿 is calculated, all the LCSs can be obtained
by tracing back from the end element 𝐿[𝑛, 𝑚] to the starting element
𝐿[0, 0]. Both the time and space complexities of this algorithm are
𝑂 (𝑚𝑛). Given 𝑑 (𝑑 ⩾ 3) sequences with equal or unequal lengths,
the matrix 𝐿 can be extended to 𝑑 dimensions for the MLCS problem,
in which the element 𝐿[𝑖 1, 𝑖 2, ..., 𝑖𝑑 ] can be calculated in a similar
way. Both the time and space complexity is 𝑂 (𝑛𝑑 ) [13].
(2) Dominant-point Based Algorithms. The dominant-point
based algorithms are motivated by the observation that most of
the cells in the score matrix 𝐿 of the input sequences are useless
and do not need to be computed. Only a very small subset of the
cells, called dominants (see Def.1 in Sec. 2.3), should be computed
and stored. A dominant-point based MLCS algorithm consists of
two steps [14, 16]: 1) constructing a directed acyclic graph, called
MLCS-DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), which consists of all MLCSs
of input sequences; 2) computing all of the MLCSs of the sequences
based on the MLCS-DAG.
Although many MLCS algorithms [13, 16, 17] have shown that
the dominant-point based MLCS algorithms are much faster than
the classical dynamic programming based algorithms, theoretical
analysis and some statistical experiments[18, 19] reveal that the
current mainstream dominant-point based MLCS algorithms
are hard to apply to big sequence data due to their MLCSDAG with a massive number of redundant points, as well
as memory and computation combinatorial explosion for
large-scale and/or big sequence data, namely big sequences.

Related Work

Considering the space-time cost, approximate MLCS algorithms
are usually designed for mining MLCSs of big sequences. As we
aim to propose a high precision and efficient approximation MLCS
algorithm in this paper, we only review existing representative
approximation MLCS algorithms.
Existing approximate MLCS algorithms can be divided into two
categories: with or without a guaranteed performance ratio, the
ratio of MLCS length (i.e., |MLCS|) of an approximate solution to
that of the optimal one.
Algorithms such as LR, ExpA, and BNMAS belong to the first category [17]. They all provide a guaranteed performance ratio of 1/|Σ|,
where |Σ| is the size of the sequence’s alphabet Σ. Although interesting theoretically, they are not very useful in practice because the
performance ratio of 1/|Σ| is too small, e.g., 1/4 for DNA sequences
(|Σ| = 4). Algorithms in the second category usually use heuristic

COVID-19 Evolves in Human Hosts
or probabilistic search techniques to achieve a good performance.
For example, Shyu and Tsai [20] used ant colony optimization to
find approximate solutions. Wang et al. [21] proposed a heuristic
greedy search algorithm MLCS-APP, and Pro-MLCS [17] adopted
an iterative best first search strategy to progressively output better
and better solutions. Yang et al. [22] presented two space-efficient
approximate MLCS algorithms, SA-MLCS and SLA-MLCS with an
iterative beam widening search strategy to reduce the space usage
during the iterative calculating process. Experiments show that
SA-MLCS and SLA-MLCS can solve an order of magnitude larger
size instances than the state-of-the-art approximate algorithm ProMLCS. Although this second class of algorithms claims that optimal
solutions can be found, the quality of the solutions is difficult to
evaluate as there are no exact baseline algorithms for comparison.
From the literature review of existing representative approximate
MLCS algorithms, we make the following observations: 1) These
algorithms’ precision is too low to meet the practical need; 2) these
algorithms are hard to apply to big sequences due to the weakness
of their underlying dominant-point based methods; 3) despite great
efforts, no approximate MLCS algorithm can tackle the big sequence
data MLCS mining efficiently and effectively. The proposed HAMLCS algorithm aims to achieve this.

A Novel Approximate MLCS Algorithm

Definition 1: For a sequence set 𝑇 = {𝑆 1, 𝑆 2, ..., 𝑆𝑖 , ..., 𝑆𝑑 } over a
finite alphabet Σ, and |𝑆𝑖 | = 𝑛,3 let 𝑆𝑖 [𝑝𝑖 ] (𝑆𝑖 [𝑝𝑖 ] ∈ Σ) be the 𝑝𝑖 -th
character in 𝑆𝑖 . The point 𝑝 = (𝑝 1, 𝑝 2, ..., 𝑝𝑑 ) is called a matched
point of 𝑇 , if and only if 𝑆 1 [𝑝 1 ] = 𝑆 2 [𝑝 2 ] = ... = 𝑆𝑖 [𝑝𝑖 ] = ... =
𝑆𝑑 [𝑝𝑑 ] = 𝑐 (𝑝𝑖 ∈ {1, 2, ..., 𝑛}, 𝑐 ∈ Σ).
Definition 2: For two matched points, 𝑝 = (𝑝 1, 𝑝 2, ..., 𝑝𝑑 ) and
𝑞 = (𝑞 1, 𝑞 2, ..., 𝑞𝑑 ) of 𝑇 , if ∀𝑖, 𝑝𝑖 < 𝑞𝑖 , we say that 𝑝 strongly dominates 𝑞, denoted by 𝑝 ≺ 𝑞, where 𝑝 is referred to as a dominating
point (dominant for short) and 𝑞 as a dominated point or successor of 𝑝. Further, if there is no matched point 𝑟 = (𝑟 1, 𝑟 2, ..., 𝑟𝑑 ) for
𝑇 such that 𝑝 ≺ 𝑟 ≺ 𝑞, we say that 𝑞 is an immediate successor
of 𝑝 and 𝑝 is an immediate predecessor of 𝑞.
Definition 3: A dominant point 𝑝 = (𝑝 1, 𝑝 2, ..., 𝑝𝑑 ) is called the
k-th dominant (the k-level point for short), if in the score matrix,
𝐿[𝑝 1, 𝑝 2, ..., 𝑝𝑑 ] = 𝑘. The set of all 𝑘-th dominants is denoted as 𝐷 𝑘 ,
and the set of all dominants of 𝑇 is denoted as 𝐷.
In what follows, we’ll go into detail on the main procedures of
our novel approximate MLCS algorithm and its underlying theory.
Constructing Successor Tables (ST). To obtain all the immediate successors of a dominate 𝑝 from sequences 𝑇 in 𝑂 (1) time,
we design a new data structure, called successor tables 𝑆𝑇 of 𝑇 . The
construction and operation of 𝑆𝑇 are detailed in Appendix A.
Constructing optimized MLCS-DAG. To overcome the weaknesses of the MLCS-DAG of the existing dominant-point based
algorithm, we construct an optimized MLCS-DAG, called MLCSODAG, with a minimum number of non-critical points (not contributing to MLCSs of sequences set 𝑇 ). To this end, we construct
its MLCS-ODAG with the following procedure:

3 The algorithms apply to the general case where the length of 𝑆 may not be the same. The only
𝑖

reason that we fix |𝑆𝑖 | = 𝑛 here is to facilitate the subsequent discussions.

1) Two dummy 𝑑-dimensional points (0, 0, ..., 0) (the source point)
and (∞, ∞, ..., ∞) (the sink point) are first introduced into the MLCSODAG for 𝑑-dimensional sequences, with all the other points in
MLCS-ODAG being the successors of (0, 0, ..., 0) and the predecessors of (∞, ∞, ..., ∞). Initially, let 𝑘 = 0 and 𝐷 𝑘 = {(0, 0, ..., 0)}.
2) If 𝐷 𝑘 = ∅, goto 6); otherwise, for each point 𝑝 in 𝐷 𝑘 , calculate
all its immediate successors by the successor tables of 𝑇 and add
a directed edge to each of their successors from 𝑝. If point 𝑝 has
no successor, a directed edge from 𝑝 to the sink point is added. All
of the successors of points from 𝐷 𝑘 constitute an initial (𝑘 + 1)𝑡ℎ

With the above steps, an optimized MLCS-ODAG of sequences 𝑇

𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 (𝑝) =
𝑝 𝑗 /𝑑 + max(𝑝 𝑗 ), (1 ⩽ 𝑗 ⩽ 𝑑)
(1)
where max(𝑝 𝑗 ) is the maximum value over all dimensions of 𝑝.
The lower the value of 𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 (𝑝), the greater the likelihood that 𝑝
will contribute to MLCSs of the input sequences, and vice versa.
The property of the proposed empirical function 𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 (𝑝) has been
proved in [14, 19]. And it works well in our experiments.
Mining all MLCSs. Given the constructed MLCS-ODAG, we
need to design an efficient and effective strategy to extract all MLCSs
from it. We start by reviewing the following related concepts.
Definition 4: For a directed acyclic graph 𝐺 = ⟨𝑉 , ⪯⟩, the topological sorting is to find an overall order of the vertices 𝑉 in 𝐺 from
the partial order ⪯ [24].
Definition 5: A topological sorting algorithm [24] iteratively
performs the following two steps until all vertices in 𝑉 have been
traversed and processed: 1) outputing the vertices with in-degree
0; 2) deleting the edges connecting to the vertices.
Inspired by the topological sorting algorithm, after investigating
our constructed MLCS-ODAG, we obtain the following important
properties.

𝑝 𝑘 to the sink point. So, its backward-level value 𝑏𝑎𝑐𝑘𝑤𝑎𝑟𝑑𝑙 (𝑝 𝑘 )

■
Based on the above observation, we replace the in-degree with
the out-degree and layer the MLCS-ODAG by the topological sorting algorithm from the sink to the source, denoted as Algorithm
BackwardTopSort. With this, all the non-critical points in MLCSODAG are now identified and can be easily removed. Fig. 2 shows
the result of BackwardTopSort to Fig. 1. Note that the MLCS-ODAG
shown in Fig. 2 contains only those key points, that is, each path
in the MLCS-ODAG corresponds to an MLCS of 𝑆 1 , 𝑆 2 and 𝑆 3 . In
addition, as shown in Fig. 2, some key points, such as point (7,5,5),
would be deleted in the procedure of constructing MLCS-ODAG, resulting in some lost MLCSs of MLCS-ODAG, so our proposed MLCS

algorithm, called HA-MLCS (High-precision Approximate MLCS
Algorithm), belongs to the approximate MLCS algorithm category.
The pseudo-code of our algorithm HA-MLCS is given in Appendix D.
We compared our algorithm with the state-of-the-art algorithms
CRO and SA_MLCS via extensive experiments. From the experimental results shown in Appendix B, we can draw the following
conclusions: 1) Although the baseline CRO always has the fastest
speed, it has the lowest precision; 2) Our algorithm HA-MLCS is
much better than SA_MLCS in both running time and precision. In
terms of running time, our algorithm is orders of magnitude faster
than the baseline SA_MLCS; 3) Our HA-MLCS works well on big
sequence data.
Notably, our HA-MLCS has the following unique properties:
1) Low space-time complexity
Theorem 2: The proposed algorithm HA-MLCS has 𝑂 (𝑁 log 𝑁 )
time complexity and 𝑂 (𝑑𝑁 + |𝐸|) space complexity, respectively.
Proof: For each sequence 𝑆𝑖 of 𝑇 over the alphabet Σ with
length 𝑛, 𝑂 (𝑛|Σ|) time is needed for constructing its successor
table. The main operations in constructing the MLCS-ODAG consist mainly of the following. Firstly, establish the predecessorsuccessor relationships among dominants in MLCS-ODAG. Sec𝑘+1 by Algorithm BestNondominatedondly, sort all the points in 𝐷𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡
Sorting [23]. Thus the time complexity for constructing the MLCSÍ |𝑀𝐿𝐶𝑆 |−1 𝑘+1
ODAG is 𝑂 (𝑁 log 𝑁 ), where 𝑁 = 𝑘=1
|𝐷𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡 |. The backward topological sorting on MLCS-ODAG by algorithm BackwardTopSorting needs 𝑂 (𝑀), where 𝑀 is the total number of points
in the final constructed MLCS-ODAG, and 𝑀 ≪ 𝑁 . Therefore,
the total time complexity of the proposed algorithm HA-MLCS
is 𝑂 (𝑑𝑛|Σ|) + 𝑂 (𝑁 log 𝑁 ) + 𝑂 (𝑀) = 𝑂 (𝑁 log 𝑁 ) as 𝑂 (𝑑𝑛|Σ|) ≪
𝑂 (𝑁 log 𝑁 ).
■
Similarly, the storage space of successor tables is 𝑂 (𝑑𝑛|Σ|), and
the storage space of the MLCS-ODAG with 𝑁 points and |𝐸| edges
is 𝑂 (𝑑𝑁 + |𝐸|). The space complexity of HA-MLCS is 𝑂 (𝑑𝑛|Σ| +
𝑑𝑁 + |𝐸|) = 𝑂 (𝑑𝑁 + |𝐸|) as 𝑂 (𝑑𝑛|Σ|) ≪ 𝑂 (𝑑𝑁 + |𝐸|).
2) 100% MLCS’ length precision
Theorem 3: The precision of MLCS length is 100%, and the
precision of the number of MLCS of HA-MLCS is calculated by Eq. 3.

Proof: Since the key points in MLCS-ODAG uniquely contribute to
and determine both the length and the total number of mined MLCSs
in MLCS-ODAG, we argue that the precision of an approximate
MLCS algorithm should be evaluated by both the mined MLCS’
length and the number of MLCS of the algorithm. As the procedure
for constructing MLCS-ODAG always keeps the frontier points of
MLCS-ODAG, none of MLCS’ length precision is lost, and the MLCS’
length precision of HA-MLCS is 100%. However, since the deleted

Notice that this property is very important for practical applications. In practice, it is not necessary to extract all the MLCSs
between sequences, but to ensure that the length of the extracted
MLCSs is accurate.
3) A novel approximate MLCS algorithm suitable for big
sequences analysis in practice
The theoretical analysis and extensive experiments show that
the proposed algorithm HA-MLCS is an efficient MLCS algorithm
suitable for big sequences analysis in practice.

3 THE EVOLUTION OF COVID-19 VIRUS
3.1 COVID-19 sequences
We have collected nearly thirty thousand complete genome sequences of COVID-19 shown in Table 1 that are available publicly, covering 29,305 genomes isolated from COVID-19 in human
hosts from 79 countries, 21 genomes from animals and the environment (outside the human bodies), 101 genomes from the four
previously known flu-causing coronavirus, HCov-229E (3 genomes),
HCov-OC43 (78 genomes), HCov-NL63 (16 genomes) and HCovHKU1 (4 genomes), and 61 genomes from seven potentially lethal
pathogenic viruses, SARS (11 genomes), MERS (11 genomes), Victoria (5 genomes), Lassa (6 genomes), Yamagata (5 genomes), Ebola
(11 genomes), and Dengue (12 genomes). These sequences are
downloaded from the following databases: GenBank or NCBI4
(National Center for Biotechnology Information), GISAID5 (Global
Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data), and CDC6 (Center for
Disease Control and Prevention). The average sequence length is
approximately 30,000.

3.2

Computing platforms and tools

Our investigation is carried out using two main computational tools,
our proposed big sequence data analysis algorithm HA-MLCS (for
similarity analysis) and existing MEGA X system[24] (for evolutionary relationship analysis). All the calculations were done on a
computing cluster of 18 nodes (Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 5115 CPU, 2
chip, 10 cores/chip, 2 threads/core, @2.4 GHz and 96GB RAM).

3.3

Similarity metrics

Based on the similarity metric design criteria and a common method
for extracting subsequences among sequences in bioinformatics and
computational biology [19, 20], we give the following definitions
and equations for computing the similarity of big sequences.
Definition 6 (LD): Lowenstein/edit distance 𝐿𝐷 [22, 23, 24] is
the minimum number of operands required to convert a character
sequence 𝑆𝑖 to another sequence 𝑆 𝑗 using the operations of inserting, deleting or changing a character. 𝐿𝐷 is the most commonly
used measure of similarity [20] between two sequences, on which
the similarity between a pair of sequences 𝑆𝑖 and 𝑆 𝑗 is defined as
𝑠𝑖𝑚 (𝑆𝑖 , 𝑆 𝑗 ) = 1 − 𝐿𝐷/𝑚𝑖𝑛 ( |𝑆𝑖 |, |𝑆 𝑗 |)

4 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
5 https://www.gisaid.org/
6 https://www.cdc.gov/

(4)

The LCS-based similarity of a pair of sequences 𝑆𝑖 and 𝑆 𝑗 is
defined as
𝑠𝑖𝑚 (𝑆𝑖 , 𝑆 𝑗 ) = |𝐿𝐶𝑆 |/𝑚𝑎𝑥 ( |𝑆𝑖 |, |𝑆 𝑗 |)

(5)

where |𝐿𝐶𝑆 | represents the length of the LCSs mined from the
pair of sequences 𝑆𝑖 and 𝑆 𝑗 . |𝑆𝑖 | and |𝑆 𝑗 | represent the lengths of
sequences 𝑆𝑖 and 𝑆 𝑗 , respectively.
We use two similarity metrics/measures for each analysis experiment, one based on Lowenstein/edit distance LD (Eq. 4) and
the other based on LCS (Eq. 5). We used the two similarity metrics to represent the similarities between a set of sequences, which
can reveal some potential biological evolutionary or genetic relationships of different species quantitatively, enabling medical professionals and biological researchers to perform cross-verification
or cross-comparison, and possibly deciding which method makes
more biological sense.

Evolution and diversity of COVID-19

3.4.1 Evolution of COVID-19 viruses from 79 countries. In order
to more accurately reveal the evolutionary relationship between
the nearly 30,000 collected COVID-19 stains in 79 countries from
December 2019 to May 2020, we first select all 25 sequences from
China, the first country that reported the COVID-19 outbreak, from
December 23, 2019 to December 31, 2019, and all the 401 sequences
from China and other 18 countries in January 2020, which gives us
a total of 426 earliest sequences out of all the collected nearly thirty
thousand COVID-19 sequences from 79 countries. Then, we fed
these 426 COVID-19 sequences into MEGA X to construct the evolutionary tree. From the constructed evolutionary tree, we selected
all of the first generation sequences. After that, by the uniform random sampling method, i.e., by ensuring the sequences from each
of 79 countries and their earliest sequences from Dec. 2019 to May
2020 can be drawn, we randomly sampled 10 groups of sequences
from 79 countries between February and May, 2020, respectively.
Then we added some new sequences with high confidence in each
group to replace the low-confidence sequences with multiple 𝑁
placeholders (𝑁 means the number of unknown characters). Finally,
each group of sequences with all of the first generation’s sequences
calculated previously were fed into MEGA X to generate their evolution trees, respectively. 10 evolutionary trees produced by MEGA X
demonstrated a high degree of consistency. Due to space limitations,
we only present one evolutionary tree here in Fig.3 and Appendix C, and others are available at https://github.com/HA-MLCS/
HA-MLCS/tree/master/supplementary_materials.
Investigating the evolutionary tree shown in Fig. 3 allows us to
make the following observations:
1) Although China was the first country to report COVID-19 outbreaks and to provide COVID-19 sequences, none of the sequences
were the earliest generations, and they were concentrated in the
sixth and the eighth branches of the later generations in the tree.
2) Apart from the two sequences from Russia in the third branches
and Spain in the forth branches of the tree, respectively, all the sequences from the top 15 countries currently reported to have the
most severe outbreaks reside in the later generations in the fifth to
tenth branches of the tree.
3) Of all the existing 29,305 COVID-19 sequences in human hosts
from 79 countries, the earliest sequence No. GWHABKF00000000
2019,12.23 from Wuhan, China was sampled on Dec. 23, 2019. But it

denoted 1 to 10, respectively. In each branch, COVID-19 sequences from different countries shown on the right side of the figure
are represented with different color dots. The 14 countries with the worst outbreaks in the legend on the left are indicated by
square dots in different colors.
unexpectedly resided in the eighth branches of the later generations
in the tree, which indicates that COVID-19 virus probably began to
spread among people in multiple countries as early as December
2019. This is also confirmed in a recent study [11].
4) The earliest sampled sequences from the 79 countries are
distributed in different branches of the tree, which indicates the

widespread infections and diversity of the COVID-19 virus in the
world due to traveling and other reasons.
5) Although there is not yet enough evidence to trace COVID19’s origin, investigating the earliest generations’ sequences in this
evolution tree may provide some clues.

Figure 5: The evolution tree of COVID-19 viruses from Italy.
3.4.2 Similarity and evolution of COVID-19 viruses. In this study,
we calculated all similarities of COVID-19 viruses among themselves and also between COVID-19 viruses and other related viruses.
Notice that the similarity matrix of homogeneous sequences is a
symmetric matrix, which represents pairwise comparisons of two
sequences of the same virus type; otherwise an asymmetric matrix, which represents pairwise comparisons of two sequences of

two different virus types. Note that each sequence in the symmetric/asymmetric matrix represents a common sequence of 5
sequences calculated by the proposed algorithm HA-MLCS. The
average similarity between sequences in the same virus type is
computed using all the elements of the upper/lower half of the symmetric similarity matrix except the diagonal elements, while the
average similarity between sequences of two different virus classes
is calculated using all the elements of the asymmetric similarity
matrix.
Since China was the first country that reported the COVID19 outbreak and submitted COVID-19 viruses, and USA, Italy and
England are the countries most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic
with a lot of sequences from Jan. to May 2020, the similarity and
evolutionary analysis of the sequences of the above four countries
are specially reported here7 , which are shown in Table 2, Figs. 4-5
and Appendix C, respectively. From the above analysis, we can
make the following observations:
1) Although the overall similarities of these human strains are
high, we observed a reduction of the similarities in later months of
all the above four countries, indicating mutations within the human
population is already occurring.
2) Averages of nucleotide differences from the four countries
are 286.39, 292.35, 268.49 and 247.61, respectively, corresponding
to averages of nucleic acid mutation points 325, 423, 378 and 289,
respectively. These changes imply rapid evaluations of this virus,
which might result in attenuation or more virulent strains. All these
differences are statistically significant (𝑝<0.0013), which indicates
that COVID-19 has begun its divergence in the human population.
3) Although the sequences of COVID-19 virus from the above
four countries have evolved at different rates, all the different countries’ viruses are steadily mutating, which potentially explains the
underlying differences in virulence and alerts us to consider this
divergence in designing antibodies and vaccines.
4) By investigating the sequence locations in their evolutionary
tree of the above countries, as well as all other countries, we can
infer that the first generation sequences is positively related to their
sampling time, but not entirely. In addition, for each country, there
are also some outlier sequences, e.g., strain EPI ISL 417180 China
2020.02.03. Further research on the first generation strains including
outliers from these countries will have important significance in
searching for the virus transmission path.
3.4.3 The similarity between COVID-19 and related viruses. To help
trace the original or the intermediate host of COVID-19 and to
assist the finding of natural remedies, we analyzed the similarity
between COVID-19 viruses in different hosts, including human,
rhinolophine, pangolin, and environmentally collected strains.
We found that COVID-19 virus living in the environment is
highly similar to that living in the human body. The average similarity can reach 0.9972/0.9972 (LCS/LD). This is expected as this is likely
to reflect what is being transmitted right now among the human
population. We also found strong similarities between TG13 and
RaTG13 (rhinolophine host) and COVID-19 (human host), reaching
0.9599/0.9584 (LCS/LD) and 0.9599/0.9585 (LCS/LD), respectively.
But the average similarities between COVID-19 with human host

sequence similarity matrices and evolutionary analysis of other heavily affected
countries are available at https://github.com/HA-MLCS/HA-MLCS.

KDD ’20 Health Day: AI for COVID-19, August 23–27, 2020, CA, USA
and the other COVID-19 strains with rhinolophine host are not
very high, 0.7416/0.6631, lower than the similarity with COVID-19
strains (pangolin host), 0.8742/0.8604, by 13% and 20% (LCS/LD).
It has been reported that many symptoms of COVID-19 patients
resemble those of the influenza patients infected with one of the four
known flu coronaviruses. Therefore, we computed the sequence
similarities between COVID-19 viruses and the four known flu coronaviruses, HCov-229E, HCov-OC43, HCov-NL63 and HCov-HKU1.
The average similarity matrices, computed with Eq. 4 (LD-based)
and Eq. 5 (LCS-based), respectively, are shown in Appendix E. The
average similarities, are 0.6532/0.5557 for HCov-229E, 0.6806/0.5619
for HCov-OC43, 0.6597/0.5607 for HCov-NL63 and 0.6909/0.5612
for HCov-HKU1. We observed that the difference in the similarity
values between the two (LCS and LD) metrics is about 10%, but the
trends of the two results are consistent.
Compared to the shared similarity between COVID-19 and the
seven lethal strains, the similarity between COVID-19 and other
known flu-causing coronaviruses is in general higher except SARS
and MERS. This pinpoints the importance of revisiting the treatment of flus and studying whether drug repurposing could possibly
alleviate the current COVID-19 crisis.
It is also worth noting that the similarities between COVID-19
strains and viruses HCov-OC43, Lassa, MERS, Victoria, Yamagate,
Ebola and Dengue have increased steadily over the past six months.

CONCLUSION

Pathogenic mechanism, virus detection, and vaccine and drug developments all heavily depend on the analysis of the complete genome
sequences of COVID-19. This study provides important information
to support the decision making of medical and healthcare professionals in tracking COVID-19’s mutation paths, developing virus
detection tools, vaccines and drugs, and controlling the epidemic.
Below, we reiterate several key findings.
First, the genome sequences of COVID-19 viruses in humans
have already gone through mutations over the past six months. This
has important implication for developing COVID-19 test kits, vaccines and antibody treatments. Recently, efforts to isolate antibodies
for COVID-treatment have been announced by several pharmaceutical companies, and vaccines are being actively developed by many
research labs around the world. The breadth of the coverage of the
antibodies and vaccines will be critical in determining its efficacy.
Second, COVID-19 shares little similarity with Ebola, but more
with the four previously known flu-causing coronaviruses (HCov229E, HCov-OC43, HCov-NL63 and HCov-HKU1), and even more
with SARS. The sequence analysis suggests that treatments to SARS
and other flu-inducing coronaviruses might be another roadmap
that we should explore. We recommend considering this during
medication and treatment development.
Third, COVID-19 virus strains from most countries might have
gone through multiple evolution paths. Extensive analyses of COVID19 strains from different countries potentially lead us to find the
first generation COVID-19 virus and its origin. As the data shown
here, at the national scale, COVID-19 could have already spread
through multiple routes. This also highlights the need to develop
more aggressive isolation and quarantine procedures for anyone
demonstrating suspicious symptoms, even without direct or known
contact with a patient.

MAIN DATA STRUCTURE

Successor tables (ST). The successor tables {𝑆𝑇1 , 𝑆𝑇2 , ..., 𝑆𝑇𝑑 } of the
sequence set𝑇 = {𝑆 1, 𝑆 2, ..., 𝑆𝑑 } are built to support the compression
of the data and quick search for the immediate successors of the
points. For a sequence 𝑆𝑙 = 𝑥 1, 𝑥 2, ..., 𝑥𝑛 from the sequence set 𝑇
over a finite alphabet Σ = (𝑐 1, 𝑐 2, ..., 𝑐𝑘 ), its successor table 𝑆𝑇𝑙 is a
two-dimensional array, where 𝑆𝑇𝑙 [𝑖, 𝑗] (the element of the 𝑖th row
and the 𝑗th column) is defined as
𝑆𝑇𝑙 [𝑖, 𝑗] = 𝑚𝑖𝑛{𝑟 |𝑥𝑟 = 𝑐𝑖 , 𝑟 ⩾ 1, 𝑟 ⩾ 𝑗, 1 ⩽ 𝑖 ⩽ |Σ|,
0 ⩽ 𝑗 ⩽ 𝑛}

The set 𝑆𝑠𝑢𝑐 of immediate successors of a 𝑑-dimensional point
𝑝 = (𝑝 1, 𝑝 2, ..., 𝑝𝑑 ) can be obtained efficiently in 𝑂 (𝑑 |Σ|) time. For
a 𝑑-dimensional point 𝑝, the operation for producing its 𝑆𝑠𝑢𝑐 can
be characterized by Eq. 7.

𝑆𝑠𝑢𝑐 = {(𝑆𝑇1 [𝑖 ′, 𝑝 1 ], 𝑆𝑇2 [𝑖 ′, 𝑝 2 ], ..., 𝑆𝑇𝑑 [𝑖 ′, 𝑝𝑑 ])}
𝑠.𝑡 .1 ⩽ 𝑖 ′ ⩽ |Σ|, ∀𝑆𝑇𝑙 [𝑖 ′, 𝑝𝑖 ] ≠ ∅, 1 ⩽ 𝑙, 𝑖 ⩽ 𝑑

(7)

For example, for the dominant (2, 3, 4) of the sequences 𝑆 1, 𝑆 2
and 𝑆 3 (in the paper), we can couple the corresponding rows 14 of the second, third and forth columns from the successor tables 𝑆𝑇1, 𝑆𝑇2 and 𝑆𝑇3 to obtain all its immediate successors (3, 7, 6),
(4, 4, 7), (5, 8, 8) and (7, 5, 5) corresponding to the characters A, C,
G, and T, respectively. There is no immediate successor for the dominant (6, 7, 3) due to the coupling results (_, _, 6), (8, _, 7), (_, 8, 4)
and (7, _, 5), which indicates none of the points is an immediate
successor according to Eq. 7.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

We evaluate the performance of the approximate algorithms, whose
performances vary in terms of not only efficiency but also precision.
Here, the precision is measured by Eq. 3. The results for all the
tested approximate algorithms, including the state-of-the-art CRO,
SA_MLCS as well as our algorithm HA-MLCS are shown in Tables 3
and 4.
