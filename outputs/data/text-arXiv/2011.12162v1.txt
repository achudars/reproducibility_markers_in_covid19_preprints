Abstract
Fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, most countries have implemented
non-pharmaceutical interventions like wearing masks, physical distancing,
lockdown, and travel restrictions. Because of their economic and logistical
effects, tracking mobility changes during quarantines is crucial in assessing
their efficacy and predicting the virus spread. Chile, one of the worst-hit
countries in the world, unlike many other countries, implemented quarantines at a more localized level, shutting down small administrative zones,
rather than the whole country or large regions. Given the non-obvious effects of these localized quarantines, tracking mobility becomes even more
critical in Chile. To assess the impact on human mobility of the localized
quarantines in Chile, we analyze a mobile phone dataset made available by
Telefónica Chile, which comprises 31 billion eXtended Detail Records and
5.4 million users covering the period February 26th to September 20th,
2020. From these records, we derive three epidemiologically relevant metrics describing the mobility within and between comunas. The datasets
made available can be used to fight the COVID-19 epidemics, particularly
for localized quarantines’ less understood effect.

Background & Summary

As of November 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic is a global threat that resulted
in around 52 million infected people and more than one million deaths globally
[17]. In South America, Chile is among the most severely affected countries,
with more than 500 thousand infected people and a death toll that surpassed
the 15,000 mark as of November 22nd, 2020. Similarly to other severely affected
1

countries [35, 31, 25, 11, 26, 32, 47], Chile implemented Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) such as regional lockdown, stay-at-home orders, and travel
restrictions, in an attempt to mitigate the COVID-19 epidemics through reducing individual mobility and promoting social distancing. In contrast with
countries such as China, Italy, and the USA, which implemented NPIs at the
national or regional level [8, 12, 35, 26, 47], Chile’s NPIs were implemented at
a very localized level, i.e., cities or urban zones (aka comunas) [28, 20]. Thus,
two comunas in the same region may be regulated by different NPIs: whereas
one is in lockdown, adjacent ones might have no travel restrictions. Given the
peculiarity of NPIs’ spatial scale in Chile, tracking mobility changes is crucial to
assess local quarantines’ efficacy and measure the effect of mobility reductions
on predicting the virus spread [10].
Mobile phone records provide an unprecedented opportunity in tracking human movements [7, 5], allowing for estimating presences and population density
[24, 16, 40], mobility patterns [27, 37, 46, 1, 5], flows [30, 4, 9], and socioeconomic status [41, 18, 23, 45, 38]. When used correctly and adequately
aggregated to preserve privacy [14, 15, 42, 43, 22], mobile phone data represent a crucial tool for supporting public health actions across the phases
of the COVID-19 pandemic [39, 10]. Motivated by the potential of mobile
phone data in capturing the geographical spread of epidemics [21, 48, 50, 6],
researchers and governments have started to collaborate with mobile network
operators to estimate the effectiveness of control measures in several countries
[33, 34, 12, 44, 35, 36, 2, 13, 28, 3].
To assess the impact of the NPIs imposed by Chilean authorities in response
to the epidemics, we analyse a mobile phone dataset provided by Telefónica
Chile, which comprises 31 billion eXtended Detail Records (XDRs) and 5.4 million users distributed all over the country covering the period February 26th,
2020 to September 20th, 2020. An XDR is created every time a user explicitly requests an HTTP address or their device automatically downloads content
from the Internet (e.g., emails, text messages), thus describing individual movements in great detail [40]. From the XDRs, we derive three epidemiologically
relevant metrics: the Index of Internal Mobility (IMint ), which quantifies the
amount of mobility within each comuna of the country; the Index of External
Mobility (IMext ), quantifying the mobility between comunas; and the Index of
Mobility (IM), which considers any movement, both within and between comunas. We hence analyse how these metrics change as the COVID-19 epidemics
spread out in Chile, highlighting a considerable heterogeneity of response to
local quarantines across the country.
The datasets we make available will grow as time goes by and, to the best
of our knowledge, are the only ones describing mobility changes and dates of
local quarantines in Chile. They can be used not only for fighting against the
COVID-19 epidemics but will also benefit other research and applications such
as emergency response [29, 52] and crowd flow prediction [54, 51, 53]. The
datasets described here are currently used at all levels of the Chilean government.

Methods

Mobile phone operators collect several different streams of mobile phones interaction with the cellular network for billing and operational purposes. Among
them are the eXtended Detail Records (XDRs), a mixture of human- and devicetriggered, either by explicitly requesting an HTTP address or automatically
downloading content from the Internet (e.g., emails). Formally, an XDR is a
tuple (u, t, A, k), in which there is only one antenna A involved, u is the caller’s
identifier, t is a timestamp of when the record is created, and k is the amount
of downloaded information (Figure 1a). From the XDRs of the individuals, we
define two types of trips. Every time a user moves from an antenna to another
antenna within the same comuna, they generate an intra-comuna trip. Every
time the user moves from an antenna to an antenna in a different comuna, they
generate an inter-comuna trip (Figure 1b). For each day and comuna, we construct three indicators of mobility based on the intra- and inter-comuna trips:
1. IMint (Index of Internal Mobility), the number of intra-comuna trips for
that day;
2. IMext (Index of External Mobility), the number of inter-comuna trips for
that day;
3. IM = IMint + IMext (Index of Mobility).
All the three indices ranges in [0, ∞), where a value of 0 indicates no mobility
at all. We normalize the three indices with respect to the number of users
that reside in the comuna, estimated as the total number of unique mobile
devices whose home antenna falls in that comuna. Each device’s home antenna
is computed as the antenna in which it has the highest number of XDRs during
nighttime (between 7pm and 7am, inclusive) [40, 49]. The number of estimated
resident users in the comunas is strongly correlated (R2 = 0.96, slope=4.37,
intercept=298.30) with the official population of the comunas as per the official
2017 Chilean Census.

at [19].
Table 1 shows the structure of the dataset describing the mobility indices.
Each record refers to a comuna in Chile and describes:
• the official name of the region (region, type:string);
• the identifier of the region as per the official 2017 Chilean Census (rid,
type:string);

• the official name of the comuna (comuna, type:string);
• the identifier of the comuna as per the official 2017 Chilean Census (cid,
type:string)1 ;
• the area of the comuna in km2 (area, type:float);

Technical Validation

In our analysis, we consider two periods: the pre-quarantine period, from March
9th to March 15th, 2020, and the quarantine period, from June 22nd to June
28th, 2020. Although we have two weeks before March 9th, the transition from
February to March marks the start of the Fall school semester in Chile. In 2020,
March 6th was the start of the semester, so we assume that the “business as
usual” period would be best represented by the week of March 9th until March
15th. March 16th marked the start of NPIs in Chile, with the closure of schools,
universities and large public gatherings. After that, on March 26th, there was
a partial lockdown of seven comunas in the Metropolitan Region. By June 2228, more than half of the population of the country was under quarantine, and
mobility was at 40% reduction.
During the pre-quarantine period, comunas with high mobility indices and
comunas with low mobility indices coexist. Geographically, high-mobility comunas are concentrated near urban areas such as the capital Santiago and,
in general, in the center of the country (Figures 6a, 7a, 8a, and 9a). The
northern and southern parts of Chile have fewer high-mobility comunas. The
comunas with the highest mobility registered during the pre-quarantine period
are located in the regions of Metropolitana de Santiago, Arica y Parinacota,
Valparaíso, Ñuble, and Magallanes (Table 3).
The top-ten comunas with the highest mobility indices change during the
quarantine period, except for Rinconada in the region of Valparaíso (Table 4),
mirroring the different degree of reduction in human mobility in the Chilean
regions (Figure 3). All regions show a reduction in all three mobility indices
during the quarantine period, albeit with different intensities (Figure 2). At
the comuna level, high-mobility comunas are rare and clustered near the large
urban areas located in central Chile (Figures 6, 7, 8, and 9).
These results are supported by the distributions of the mobility indices of the
two periods (Figure 4). There is a clear shift towards the left of the distribution
of the IM index (Figure 4a): (i) the average IM during the quarantine period
(5.16 ± 2.74) is 27.6% lower than the average IM during the pre-quarantine
period (7.13 ± 4.15); (ii) the distribution of IM during the quarantine period is
more skewed to the left, showing a decrease of the mobility in Chile during the
selected days. Regarding IMint and IMext , we observe no net shift of the curve,
but rather a flattening, suggesting that intra- and inter-comuna trips decreased

computed over the period from June 22nd and June 28th, 2020.
We further analyze the reduction of the mobility defining IMred as the relative reduction of the IM index in the quarantine period with respect to the
pre-quarantine period. The distribution of IMred shows that a large number
of comunas have a reduced mobility, following Chilean government interventions, by an average of 25.37% ± 43.2 (Figure 4d). However, comunas that were
not in quarantine during the quarantine period do not reduce their mobility
significantly (Figure 5a).
The percentage of population that live in comunas where the authorities
applied NPIs increases with time (Figure 5a) reaches its peak (≈ 57%) in late
July 2020. With the increase of the number of people under quarantine, IMred

initially increases, but it slightly decreases over time even if both the number
of individuals and the number of comunas under quarantine increase. This
phenomenon suggests that mobility restrictions are more effective in the shortmedium term and become less effective as time goes by, and it can be observed
both at regional (Figure 2) and comuna level (Figures 5a and 5b).
