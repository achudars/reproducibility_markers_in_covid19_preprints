Abstract
It has long been known that epidemics can travel along communication lines,
such as roads. In the current COVID-19 epidemic, it has been observed that
major roads have enhanced its propagation in Italy. We propose a new simple
model of propagation of epidemics which exhibits this effect and allows for a
quantitative analysis. The model consists of a classical SIR model with diffusion,
to which an additional compartment is added, formed by the infected individuals
travelling on a line of fast diffusion. Exchanges between individuals on the line
and in the rest of the domain are taken into account. A classical transformation
allows us to reduce the proposed model to a system analogous to one we had
previously introduced [5] to describe the enhancement of biological invasions
by lines of fast diffusion. We establish the existence of a minimal spreading
speed and we show that it may be quite large, even when the basic reproduction
number R0 is close to 1. More subtle qualitative features of the final state,
showing the important influence of the line, are also proved here.

Keywords: COVID-19, epidemics, SIR model, reaction-diffusion system, line of fast

Context and motivation of this study

In the present context of the COVID-19 pandemic, a worldwide scientific effort is
currently under way to develop the modelling of its dynamics and propagation. Such
1

an endeavour is of essential value to monitor, and forecast the propagation of the
epidemic.
Most of the models that are used rely on various extensions of the classical SIR cornerstone model of epidemiology. That is, they use population compartmental models
that contain various additional compartments to the SIR ones to account for segments
of the populations that are exposed, asymptomatic, presymptomatic, treated, etc.
Such models yield the evolution of the infected population at a given level of territorial granularity (whole countries, regions, counties or cities). The spatial interplay
aspect, mostly overlooked, is included by involving transfer matrices of populations
and infected between various patches each of which being considered as uniform.
Yet, the propagation of COVID-19 exhibits remarkable spatial structure properties. Indeed, the spatial organization and spreading of epidemics in general reveal
important features of the transmission process. This is especially true in relation with
movements of individuals who carry with them infectious characteristics. It has long
been known, since ancient times, that epidemics travel along lines of communications.
In the black death epidemic of the 14th century, contagion advanced along roads connecting trade fair cities, and from there spread inwards leading to a front like invasion
of Western Europe roughly from South to North, pulled by these roads. Such a mode
of propagation was also at work for the propagation of rumours. (See for instance the
propagation of the “big fear” in France, after the Revolution. Compare, for example,
the presentation given by Siegfried in [28] and the analogies between these two phenomena.) In studying the early spread of HIV virus in Congo [15], Faria et al. pointed
out that the virus mostly travelled along the main lines of communications (railways
and waterways), see Figure 1 below.

movement are projected along the transportation network for the Democratic Republic
of Congo (railways and waterways). Reprinted with permission of AAAS.

Some current studies are bringing to light a similar effect in the spread of the
COVID-19 virus in Italy. Gatto et al. [16] and Sebastiani [27] have established that
the coronavirus spread foremost along the main expressways. They argue indeed that
2

cities located along the main North-South and East-West highways in Italy have faced
an earlier and stronger contagion than cities with similar or higher population sizes
but not located on these roads. The spatial signatures of the spreading of the epidemic
is clearly revealed by Figure 2 taken from the work [16] by Gatto et al.

level, spanning the time period from Feb. 25 to Mar. 25. The quantity represented

Then, Figure 3 is a snapshot from a video in [16] which accounts for hospitalisation. It highlights the radiation of the epidemic along highways and transportation
infrastructures. Figure 4 below, taken from Sebastiani [27], depicts the Italian cities
with more than 1,000 infected individuals reported as for April 5. For two of them,
Piacenza and Cremona, which are located respectively at the crossroad of these two
main highways and 40 Km away from it, infected people are above 1% of the population. We point out that the cities represented in this figure are by far not the most
populated ones in Italy.
That this effect of roads still matters in such a global and “modern” epidemic as
COVID-19 shows that spatial diffusion still plays an important role in the spreading of
epidemics. At an early stage, long distance “jumps” through the air transport network
played the key role in the global dissemination of the pandemic. However, the role of
ground transportation became relevant in a second phase. This is even more true after
the lockdown in many countries, that all but halted all flights. Even though ground
travel was limited, it was never interrupted and, furthermore, ground transportation
was essential in transporting all needed supplies.
With respect to patch models that include transfer matrices, it thus transpires that
the effect of lines is of a different nature. And as we have seen, these lines can be roads,
railroads or rivers.
The aim of this paper is to propose a new model to account for such effects and then
to study quantitatively how a line acts on the overall epidemics propagation. We thus
introduce a model that we call the SIRT system, standing for Susceptibles, Infected,
Recovered, and Travelling infected. This model takes explicitly into account the existence of a line along which infected individuals can travel with a specific diffusion
coefficient. Our aim here is to gain insight into this spreading aspect at the fundamental mathematical level of a SIR type model that now incorporates the possibility
of infected to travel along a specific line.

The SIR model dates back the fundamental paper of Kermack-McKendrick [23],
Kendall [21] introduced the SIR model with spatial interaction in the discussion of
a statistical study of measles by Bartlett [3]. These models may be rewritten as
nonlinear integro-differential equations in time and space variables, for which the study
of spreading dates back to the 1970’s with, in particular, the milestone papers of
Aronson [1] and Diekmann [11]. We choose in this paper to restrict our model to local
(Brownian) diffusion and local interaction. Regarding the existence of travelling waves
for the local (homogeneous) diffusion model, see the studies of Källen [20], HosonoIlyas [17, 18]. For a survey, see Murray [25].
The model we propose here aims at a fundamental mathematical understanding
of this effect. We look at a stylized situation – a laboratory case as it were. The
population of susceptibles diffuse in a homogeneous open territory, that we take to be
a half plane. Then, the infected can travel along the line bounding this half plane.
The populations of infected in the open territory and on the lines are in constant
exchange. This is represented in our model by transmission parameters between these
two populations (stable and travelling infected). We aim at understanding the effects
of such lines on the speed of propagation of the epidemics, and how they affect the
balance of the total number and locations of infected individuals.
As a benchmark we use the classical SIR model with diffusion, for which we briefly
recall the basic results and how to compute the speed of spreading. The latter coincides
with that of Aronson-Weinberger [2], we simply rewrite the formulas in terms of the
basic reproduction number R0 .
Let us mention that the SIR model falls into a more general class of systems in
which one equation – the one for I here – exhibits a self-reinforcement mechanism

when the other unknown function – S – is above some threshold level. BerestyckiNordmann-Rossi [4] develop a mathematical study of this class of systems, called
Activity/Modulator. As described there, SIR models also arise in a variety of contexts
to model contagion phenomena. They are particularly useful in the study of collective
behaviours, such as social unrest. The work by Bonasse-Gahot et al. [9], developed
such a system to model the spread of riots in France in 2005.
Of course, more realistic epidemiology models will incorporate networks rather
than single lines and, likewise, the remaining propagation does not take place in a
homogeneous territory. From this simplified model, one can nonetheless deduce a
more realistic one involving a network of roads and a distribution of cities. Regarding
the latter aspect, Bonasse-Gahot et al. [9] use explicitly such a network of cities.
This family of models lends itself to various extensions. But since we want to derive
the mathematical properties of this system we only consider here the stylized model.
We hope that this stylized model can shed some light on how lines influence the global
unfolding of an epidemic.

2.1

A model for the propagation of epidemics along
lines
The SIR model with infected diffusion

The classical SIR model divides the overall population in three compartments: Susceptibles S, Infected (and infectious) I and recovered R. Since the total population N
is viewed as fixed, one derives the latter in a straightforward manner from the former
two: R = N − S − I. Therefore, we do not mention explicitly this function henceforth.
When taking into account spatial dependence, we view the unknowns S and I as depending on both time t and space location X ∈ R2 . We consider that the individuals
in the susceptible population S do not move around (or rather that movement does
no affect its distribution). We can think of S as the ambient population. Thus, we
assume that only the infected population I is subject to movement. We choose here
to represent this movement as a pure local diffusion that can be viewed as a limiting
Brownian movement of individuals. In the second part of this work [8], we consider
the case of non-local diffusions. We denote by d the diffusion coefficient. We are thus
led to the following spatial diffusion SIR model:
(
∂t I − d∆I = βSI − αI (t > 0, X ∈ R2 )
(2.1)
∂t S = −βSI
(t > 0, X ∈ R2 ).
The system is supplemented with initial conditions. We assume that the initial distribution of S, S(0, X) ≡ S0 is constant and that I(0, X) = I0 (X) is compactly
supported.
The cumulative number of infected at location X, at time t is given by
Rt
I(t,
X)dt.
Several authors have considered this model or closely related ones with
0
integral formulations. We mention some of the references in Subsection 3.1 below. For
the sake of completeness we derive here the main results concerning this system (2.1):
existence and properties of a final state to which the solutions and the cumulative
number of infections at each location converge, characterization of epidemic spreading, and asymptotic speed of propagation. These properties involve the classical basic
reproduction number R0 := S0 β/α. As we will recall, the position of R0 with respect to 1 determines here too a threshold for the epidemic to spread. These various
properties will serve as benchmarks for our study of the effect of the presence of a
road.

2.2

A “SIRT ” model in the presence of a road

Let us now introduce this system, which we call a road/field model. It represents a
situation where there is a road on which infected individuals can travel with a specific
diffusion coefficient D. We are especially interested in the case of a large D. The aim
is to understand in what way such a road alters the epidemic spreading, in particular
if it enhances its propagation and in what measure exactly. The starting point of
our analysis consists in distinguishing the infected individuals which are moving on
the line with fast diffusion from the ones present in the rest of the territory, by using
two distinct density functions. This is the same modelling hypothesis we made in our
6

previous paper [5] to describe the dynamics of a single population in the presence of
a road.
As before we use the densities S(t, x, y) and I(t, x, y) of susceptible and infected
individuals at time t > 0 and position X = (x, y) ∈ R2 . We still assume that we
can ignore the movement of susceptibles. We introduce a new compartment of the
population that we call T (t, x) standing for “travelling individuals”. This is the density
of infected individuals on the road, that is the line R. It is worth emphasizing that
I(t, x, y) and T (t, x) are two different compartments, in particular T (t, x) is not the
same as I(t, x, 0). Both populations are assumed to diffuse, but with different diffusion
coefficients: D for T on the line and d for I in the plane. The two compartments
interact by a constant exchange of individuals: at each time t > 0 and point x ∈ R,
the line yields an amount µT (t, x) of individuals to the domain, and receives an amount
νI(t, x, 0) of individuals from the domain.
To shed light on the effect of such a road it is enough to consider the interplay
of a half-plane with the road that bounds it. Indeed, results in this framework can
be translated for results in the whole space by straightforward symmetry arguments.
But it can also be seen that propagation properties in the plane in general can easily
be deduced from the half-plane case. (For such a discussion, we refer to our earlier
paper for the KPP equation with a road [5].) We prefer to carry our analysis in the
half-plane case for the sake of clarity and to simplify notations.
Thus, we consider the following system for the unknown S, I, T : By symmetry, we
can reduce to study the problem in the upper half-space R × (0, +∞). We end up with
the following system :

∂t I − d∆I + αI = βSI

∂t T − D∂xx T = νI(t, x, 0) − µT (t > 0, x ∈ R, y = 0).
We assume a uniform initial susceptible density: S(0, x, y) ≡ S0 > 0. The initial
density of infected individuals is assumed to be zero outside a bounded region:
(T (0, x), I(0, x, y)) = (T0 (x), I0 (x, y))
are nonnegative and compactly supported in R and R × [0, +∞) respectively, with in
addition I0 6≡ 0, but possibly T0 ≡ 0. Actually, to simplify matters, most fo the time
we will look at the case T0 ≡ 0, not that it changes much in the proofs.

2.3

Organization of the paper

In the next section, we will first analyse systems (2.1) to have sound benchmarks that
will be useful to discuss the effects of the road. Then, the remaining of the paper will
be devoted to the study of (2.2). We will start by discussing the stationary limiting
state and see whether the epidemic spreads or not in Subsection 3.2. There we will
also derive the asymptotic speed of propagation for the spatial spread of the epidemic.
In Section 4, we discuss how the presence of the road affects the distribution of the
total number of infected per location. Section 5 is devoted to the mathematical proofs
7

of these various results. These depend on the various parameters and we discuss their
influence in Section 6.

Analysis of the models

We are going to compare the behaviour of (2.2) to that of the classical SIR model
in the whole plane, with no diffusion of the susceptible population, that is (2.1). The
proofs of the results (in a slightly broader framework) are presented in Section 5.1.

3.1

Benchmark: the SIR model

System (2.1) can be reduced to the classical Fisher-KPP equation by noticing that
S(t, X) is easily computed from I(t, X):


Z t
S(t, X)
= −βv(t, x), v(t, x) =
I(s, X)ds.
(3.1)
ln
S0
0
Thus, the function v(t, X) satisfies the equation
vt − d∆v = f (v) + I0 (X)

(t > 0, X ∈ R2 )

(3.2)

with
f (v) := S0 (1 − e−βv ) − αv,
together with the initial condition
(X ∈ R2 ).

v(0, X) ≡ 0

(3.3)

Transform (3.1) is a well-known particular case of a broader class (see for instance
Aronson [1], Diekmann [10]) that reduces the SIR model with nonlocal interactions,
and with no diffusion on the susceptible individuals, to nonlinear integral equations. In
this particular case, we retrieve a parabolic equation. Pulsating waves and spreading
speeds for periodic S0 are studied for (2.1) by Ducrot-Giletti [14]. The integral equation
resulting from the model with nonlocal interactions is studied by Ducasse [13].
The nonlinearity f is concave and vanishes at 0, it is then of the KPP type. Only
the presence of the “source” term I0 differs from the standard Fisher-KPP equation.
However, being I0 compactly supported, the dynamics of the equation is still governed
by the sign of f 0 (0). Using a notation commonly employed in the literature, we write
f 0 (0) = α(R0 − 1),

where R0 :=

S0 β
.
α

The quantity R0 can be viewed as the classical basic reproduction number, see for
instance [20] and the discussion on such number and its interpretation in [12]. This
parameter plays a crucial role and is widely mentioned by experts, decision makers
and media for the analysis of the present COVID-19 pandemic. The sign of f 0 (0) is
determined by the position of R0 with respect to the threshold value R0 = 1. The
presence of I0 in (3.2) prevents the existence of constant steady states, making the
dynamics of the equation more complex. Nevertheless, the following Liouville-type
result holds.
8

Theorem 3.1. The equation in (3.2) admits a unique positive, bounded, stationary
solution v∞ (X). Moreover, v∞ satisfies
(
0 if R0 6 1
lim v∞ (X) =
|X|→∞
v∗ if R0 > 1,
where v∗ is the unique positive zero of f .
The proof of this result, as well as the others in this section, are presented in
Section 5.1. They can also be found in Ducrot-Giletti [14], at least for the case R0 > 1,
in the more general framework of periodic coefficients α(X), β(X) and distribution
S0 (X). Some additional qualitative properties of v∞ are contained in Theorem 5.1
below. Namely, v∞ is radially decreasing outside the support of I0 and it has the
shape of a bump above the value 0 or v∗ .
It turns out that the steady state v∞ is a global attractor for the dynamics of (3.2).
Theorem 3.2. The solution v(t, X) to (3.2)-(3.3) converges locally uniformly to v∞ (X)
as t → +∞.
Since the above convergence holds true for the time derivatives (see the proof in
Section 5.1), a first consequence we derive is:
I(t, X) = ∂t v(t, X) → 0 as t → +∞,
that is, the number of infected individuals drops to 0 asymptotically in time.
One can also read Theorem 3.2 in terms of number of remaining susceptibles at
time t and position X, which is S(t, X) = S0 e−βv(t,X) . Hence, the amount of people
that will be infected by the virus at a given place X, throughout the whole course of
the epidemic, is given by

Itot (X) = S0 1 − e−βv∞ (X) .
We point ou that the fact that this function is not constant is a consequence of the
hypothesis that susceptibles do not diffuse. Otherwise the diffusion tends to “flatten”
the density S, and this mechanism occurs for rather general systems, see e.g. [4, Theorem 4.3]. For this reason, the description of the function v∞ is extremely important
in the study of the epidemic. With this regard, Theorem 3.1 leads to the following
crucial dichotomy for the total amount of infected people far from the epicentre:
(
0
if R0 6 1

lim Itot (X) =
−βv
|X|→∞
S0 1 − e ∗
if R0 > 1.
This corresponds to two opposite scenarios. If R0 6 1, the epidemic does not propagate
and areas very far from the initial outburst (the support of I0 ) will be essentially not
infected. Conversely, if R0 > 1, the epidemic propagates across the territory, and, even
though its impact will be weaker on places far from the epicentre, the total infected
people there will be a portion 1 − e−βv∗ of the overall population.
What is important to determine in the case R0 > 1 is the speed at which the
epidemic spreads. This is provided by the following.
9

Theorem 3.3. Assume that R0 > 1. Call
p
cSIR := 2 dα(R0 − 1).

(3.4)

Then, for all ε ∈ (0, cSIR ), the solution v(t, X) to (3.2)-(3.3) satisfies

v(t, X) = 0.

The quantity cSIR is the asymptotic p
speed of spreading of the epidemic wave. It
coincides from one hand with the speed 2 df 0 (0) of the standard Fisher-KPP equation,
and from the other with the minimal speed of the waves for the SIR model (2.1)
obtained by Källén [20].
A word must be said about the proof, presented in Section 5.1. It is essentially
a direct consequence of Theorem 3.2 above and Aronson-Weinberger [2]. Indeed, the
former describes the behaviour of the solution in compact regions, while the latter
provides the estimates far from the origin, where the influence of I0 is negligible.

It occurs that the very same transform works for the model with the line (2.2):

with, as before, f (v) := S0 (1 − e−βv ) − αv. The initial datum is
(u(0, ·), v(0, ·)) ≡ (0, 0).

(3.6)

This is the same system studied in [5], except for the “source” terms I0 , T0 . We
recall that these are assumed here to be nonnegative and compactly supported, with
I0 6≡ 0 (and typically T0 ≡ 0).
We start with the Liouville-type result, analogous to Theorem 3.1.
Theorem 3.4. System (3.5) admits a unique positive, bounded, stationary solution

Theorem 3.5. The solution (u, v) to (3.5)-(3.6) converges to (ur∞ , v∞
locally uniformly in x ∈ R, y > 0.

At this stage, the picture is identical to the standard SIR model described in the
previous section. The total amount of infected individuals after the passage of the
epidemic wave, at a given point (x, y), is

r
Itot (x, y) = S0 1 − e−βv∞ (x,y) ,

which is the same as in the case without the line.
Next, we investigate the speed at which the epidemic spreads across the territory,
along the line.
Theorem 3.6. Assume that R0 > 1. Let (u, v) be the solution to (3.5)-(3.6). Then,
there exists cTSIR > 0 such that, for all ε ∈ (0, cTSIR ),

locally uniformly with respect to y > 0.
In addition, the spreading speed cTSIR satisfies
(
= cSIR if D 6 2d
cTSIR
> cSIR if D > 2d.
The asymptotic speed of spreading cTSIR coincides with the one for the homogeneous
model, i.e. with I0 , T0 ≡ 0, which is provided by [5, Theorem 1.1]. Form a mathematical
point of view, this means that the presence of the compact perturbation does not affect
the speed of propagation, as in the case of the SIR model (3.2). The fact that the
speed cannot decrease if one adds the perturbation is a straightforward consequence
of the comparison principle. Instead, to derive the opposite inequality, we need to go
into the proof of [5, Theorem 1.1] and use the supersolutions constructed there. This
is done in Section 5.2 below.
Theorem 3.6 shows that the presence of the line has a true impact on the speed at
which the epidemic spreads. Indeed, if the diffusion coefficient on the line D is larger
than twice the one in the field d, the asymptotic speed of spreading in the direction of
the line is enhanced, compared with the standard one cSIR . How much the spreading
11

is enhanced is discussed in Section 6. One can then wonder what is the effect of
the line on the other directions. In the case I0 , T0 ≡ 0, we have shown in [6] that
the enhancement of the speed occurs in a cone of directions around the line, with an
associated critical angle. We suspect the same scenario to hold true for system (3.5).
We conclude this section by showing that our model accounts for a true epidemic
wave, in the following sense. At every point of the domain under consideration, the
number of infected individuals, that was initially close to 0, raises to a nontrivial level
around a certain time, then decays back to 0.
Proposition 3.7. Assume that R0 > 1. There is a constant T∗ > 0, a function I∗ (y),
defined for y > 0 and locally bounded from below away from 0, and a function τ∗ (x),
defined for x ∈ R and such that

(3.7)

for which the following is true.
1. (peak around τ∗ (x)). We have
T (τ∗ (x), x) > T∗ ,

I∗ (τ∗ (x), x, y) > I∗ (y).

(3.8)

2. (decay far from τ∗ (x)). The following limits hold uniformly in x ∈ R and locally
uniform in y > 0:


lim T (τ∗ (x) + t, x), I(τ∗ (x) + t, x, y) = (0, 0)



(3.9)
lim
T (τ∗ (x) − t, x), I(τ∗ (x) − t, x, y) = (0, 0).
τ∗ (x)>t→+∞

This proposition is proved in Section 5.2. We note that, for the true SIR model,
one has a much stronger result, as one may relate the maximum of I to the maximum
of the derivative of the one-dimensional Fisher-KPP wave. While we do have the
existence of travelling wave here (see [7]), we do not have precise convergence results
for the solution of the Cauchy Problem. This will be done in a future study.

Effects of the line on the total number of infected
per location

We recall that the total number of infected people at a given location (x, y), for both
models without and with the road, is given by

Itot (x, y) = S0 1 − e−βev∞ (x,y) ,
r
where ve∞ is either v∞ or v∞

stationary solution of the problem. We know that v∞ and v∞
have the same limit at

infinity: 0 if R0 6 1 and the positive zero v of f if R0 > 1. What differs is the rate

This result has the important consequence of showing that v∞
> v∞ close to the
x-axis and far away from the origin. Namely, the presence of the road increases the
number of infected people far from the epicentre of the epidemic.
Observe that the decay of v∞ is the natural one provided by the linearised equation (outside supp I0 ) and it is obtained through rather standard arguments. On the
r
is slower than the natural one. The proof of Theorem 4.1,
contrary, the decay of v∞
presented in Section 5.2, relies on some ideas from [5], the keystone consisting in the
construction of suitable sub and supersolutions.
Let us sketch the argument. To start with, we look for a stationary solution to (3.5)
as a perturbation of the limit at infinity:
ν

v(x, y) = v∗ + he
v (x, y),
u(x) = v∗ + he

where, for notational simplicity, we have set v∗ := 0 in the cases R0 6 1. Dropping
the o(h) terms, outside the supports of I0 and T0 we get the linearised system

If R0 6= 1, i.e. f 0 (v∗ ) < 0, this system admits a unique positive solution, that we
denote (a∗p
, b∗ , γ∗ ), whose first two components are represented in Figure 5. Observe
that a∗ < −f 0 (v∗ )/d, which is the radius of the disk. If R = 0, i.e. f 0 (v∗ ) = 0, then
the unique solution of (4.3) is (a∗ , b∗ , γ∗ ) := (0, 0, µ/ν). This will provide us with a
supersolution to (3.5), whence the exponential upper bound in Theorem 4.1.
For the lower bound, we need to modify the construction in order to obtain a
subsolution supported in a strip. First of all, we penalise the reaction term in the field
by considering a parameter ζ > −f 0 (v∗ ) > 0. Next, we modify the above function ve,
considering now the pair

This leads to a family of bounded subsolutions with a decay in the x-variable arbitrarily
close to a∗ .
The next result shows that there are regions where the road has the opposite effect.
Theorem 4.2. Suppose that R0 6= 1 and that I0 (x, y) is either symmetric with respect
to y, or satisfies supp I0 ⊂ R×[0, +∞). Then there exist two subsets E ± of R×[0, +∞)

Proofs of the results
The SIR model

We give here the proofs of the results of Section 3.1, and we also derive some further
qualitative properties of the solution. We consider a more general framework: we
set problems (2.1), (3.2) in arbitrary space dimension N > 1, i.e., X ∈ RN , and for
initial data v(0, X) not necessarily identically equal to zero, but rather nonnegative
and compactly supported. This does not entail any additional difficulty.
Proof of Theorem 3.1. On one hand, the function identically equal to 0 is a subsolution
to the stationary equation
d∆v + f (v) + I0 (X) = 0 (X ∈ RN ).

(5.1)

On the other hand, the constant function v̄ ≡ s is a supersolution of this equation
provided s > 0 is sufficiently large, because I0 is bounded and f (+∞) = −∞. The
existence of a solution 0 6 v∞ 6 s then follows from the standard sub/supersolution
method. Actually, as 0 is not a solution, the elliptic strong maximum principle yields
v∞ > 0 in RN .
Let us now derive the limit as |X| → ∞. By elliptic estimates, any sequence
of translations v∞ (X + Xn ), with (Xn )n∈N diverging, converges (up to subsequences)
towards a nonnegative, bounded solution ve to
d∆e
v + f (e
v ) = 0 (X ∈ RN ).
If R0 6 1, i.e. f 0 (0) 6 0, then f < 0 on (0, +∞), from which one readily derives ve ≡ 0
(for instance by comparison with the ODE u̇ = f (u)) that necessarily. This shows
that v∞ (X) → 0 as |X| → ∞ when R0 6 1.
In the case R0 > 1, we remark that v∞ is a supersolution to the classical FisherKPP equation
∂t v = d∆v + f (v) (t > 0, X ∈ RN ),
(5.2)
for which the “hair-trigger” effect holds, see [2]: any solution with a positive, bounded
initial datum converges as t → +∞, locally uniformly in space, to the positive zero v∗
of f . We infer by comparison that v∞ > v∗ in RN . This shows in particular that ve
is positive, and thus applying the “hair-trigger” effect to ve we derive ve ≡ v∗ . We have
shown that v∞ (X) → v∗ as |X| → ∞ when R0 > 1.
To prove the uniqueness, we distinguish again the cases R0 > 1 and R0 6 1.
Case R0 > 1.
We need to show that, for any pair of positive, bounded solutions v1 , v2 to (5.1), there
holds that v1 6 v2 in RN . Assume by way of contradiction that
k := sup
RN

v1
> 1.
v2

15

Since v1 , v2 → v∗ at infinity, the above supremum is a maximum, attained at some
point X̄. Subtracting the equations we get
d∆(v1 − kv2 ) + f (v1 ) − kf (v2 ) + I0 (X)(1 − k) = 0,
which, evaluated at the point X̄ (where v1 = kv2 and ∆(v1 − kv2 ) 6 0) yields
kf (v2 (x̄)) 6 f (v1 (X̄)) = f (kv2 (X̄)).
But this is impossible because, being concave and vanishing at 0, f satisfies
∀s > 0,

f (ks)
f (s)
<
.
ks
s

Case R0 6 1.
Now, any given positive, bounded solutions v1 , v2 to (5.1) tend to 0 at infinity. Take
ε > 0 and call v2ε := v2 + ε. Because f is decreasing in R+ , we see that
d∆v2ε + f (v2ε ) + I0 (X) < 0 (X ∈ RN ).
Assuming by contradiction that v1 > v2ε somewhere and repeating the same arguments
as before with v2 replaced by v2ε , we end up with the inequality
kf (v2ε (X̄)) < f (kv2ε (X̄)),
at some point X̄ and for some k > 1. As seen before, this is impossible. This means
that v1 6 v2ε in RN , which, by the arbitrariness of ε, entails the desired inequality
v1 6 v2 .
The following result contains some additional properties ov v∞ .
Theorem 5.1. The stationary solution v∞ (X) satisfies the following properties:
(i) v∞ is radially decreasing outside the support of I0 , i.e.,
∀e ∈ S1 , δ 6 r1 < r2 ,

v∞ (r1 e) > v∞ (r2 e),

where δ is such that X · e 6 δ for all X ∈ supp I0 ;

Proof.
Statement (i).
We make use of a reflection argument due to Jones [19]. Fix a direction e ∈ SN −1 and
take r > δ, where δ is such that X · e 6 δ for all X ∈ supp I0 . Let T be the reflection
with respect to the hyperplane {X · e = r}, and define ve := v∞ ◦ T . In the half-space
{X · e < r} (⊃ supp I0 ) the function ve solves d∆e
v + f (e
v ) = 0, hence it is a subsolution
of the equation satisfied by v∞ . In addition, ve ≡ v∞ on {X · e = r}. Repeating the
comparison argument in the proof of Theorem 3.1 with v1 = ve and v2 = v∞ , but in
{X ·e < r}, and observing that the point X̄ cannot belong to the boundary {X ·e = r},
one infers that ve 6 v∞ in {X · e < r}. Actually, the strong maximum principle and
Hopf’s lemma imply that the inequality is strict and moreover
∇e
v (re) · e > ∇v∞ (re) · e.
Since ∇e
v (re) · e = −∇v∞ (re) · e, this gives the desired monotonicity.
Statements (ii)-(iii).
We have shown in the proof of Theorem 3.1 that, in the case R0 > 1, v∞ > v∗ in RN .
The strict inequality follows from the strong maximum principle.
We simultaneously derive properties (5.3)-(5.4).
p To do so, we set v∗ = 0 in the
case R0 < 1. For given e ∈ SN −1 , k > 0 and λ = −f 0 (v∗ )/d, consider the function
w(X) := ke−λX·e . Using the concavity of f , we derive
−d∆w = f 0 (v∗ )w > f (v∗ + w),
that is, v∗ + w is a supersolution to (5.1) outside supp I0 . Let ρ > 0 be such that
supp I0 ⊂ Bρ . We choose
k := eλρ max v∞ ,

so that v∗ + w > v∞ in Bρ ⊃ supp I0 . As a consequence, the function min v∞ , v∗ + w
is a generalized supersolution to (5.1). It then follows from the sub/supersolution
method, that there exists a solution 0 6 v 6 v∞ , v∗ + w , which is actually positive
by the strong maximum principle. Then v ≡ v∞ thanks to the Liouville result of
Theorem 3.1. We have thereby shown that
√
− −f 0 (v∗ )/d X·e
.
∀|X| > ρ, v∞ (X) 6 v∗ + kz(X) = v∗ + ke
This being true for all e ∈ SN −1 , we obtain the upper bound
√ 0
∀|X| > ρ, v∞ (X) 6 v∗ + ke− −f (v∗ )/d |X| .
Let us derive the lower bound. Take

It follows that, for h > 0 sufficiently small, the function v∗ +hz is a subsolution to (5.1)
for |X| > dλ(Nε −1) . Up to decreasing h if need be, we further have that v∗ +hz < v∞ for

|X| 6 dλ(Nε −1) , hence v := max v∞ , v∗ + hz is a generalized subsolution to (5.1). By
the sub/supersolution method, there exists a solution v 6 v 6 s, where s is such that
f (s) < max I0 . Theorem 3.1 eventually yields v ≡ v∞ . This shows the lower bound

from which the limits in (5.3)-(5.4) follow due to the arbitrariness of ε > 0.
We now turn to the results about the Cauchy problem (3.2), with an initial datum
v(0, X) nonnegative and compactly supported.
Proof of Theorem 3.2. Let v, v be the solutions to the Cauchy problem emerging from
the initial data identically equal to 0 and s respectively, with s > 0 large enough so
that f (s) + max I0 < 0. We further take s > max v(0, ·). The parabolic comparison
principle yields
∀t > 0, X ∈ RN ,

v(t, X) 6 v(t, X) 6 v(t, X).

Since the initial data of v, v are respectively a sub and a supersolution of the problem,
the comparison principle implies that v, v are respectively increasing and decreasing
in t and then, by parabolic estimates, they converge to two stationary solutions 0 <
V 6 V < s. The convergences occur locally uniformly in space and hold true for the
time derivatives. Theorem 3.1 implies that V ≡ V ≡ v∞ . The proof is complete.
Proof of Theorem 3.3. Take ε ∈ (0, cSIR ) and consider a sequence (tn )n∈N diverging
to +∞ and a sequence (Xn )n∈N in RN such that |Xn | 6 (cSIR − ε)tn . If (Xn )n∈N
is bounded, we already know from Theorem 3.2 that v(tn , Xn ) − v∞ (Xn ) → 0 as
n → ∞. Suppose now that (Xn )n∈N diverges (up to subsequences). Recall that v is a
supersolution to the standard
pFisher-KPP equation (5.2), for which spreading occurs
with the asymptotic speed 2 df 0 (0), that is exactly cSIR . Because v(1, ·) > 0, we infer
that

lim inf v(tn , Xn ) − v∞ (Xn ) ) > v∗ − v∗ = 0.
n→∞

To derive the upper bound, we consider the
ke−λX·e as in
p same function w(X)N:=
the proof of Theorem 5.1(ii), with λ =
−f 0 (v∗ )/d and e ∈ S −1 , k > 0. We
have seen that v∗ + w is a supersolution to (5.1) outside supp I0 . We then take k
large enough, independently of e, so that v∗ + w(X) > v(t, X) for all t > 0 and
X ∈ supp I0 ∪ supp v(0, ·). Hence, by comparison, v(t, X) < v∗ + w(X) for all t > 0,
18

X ∈ RN . This being true for any e ∈ SN −1 , with k independent of e, yields v(t, X) 6
v∗ + ke−λ|X| , for all t > 0, X ∈ RN . It follows that

lim sup v(tn , Xn ) 6 lim sup v∗ + ke−λ|Xn | = v∗ .
n→∞

n→∞

The proof of the first limit stated in the theorem is achieved.
p
SIR
Let us deal with the second limit. For c = cSIR = 2 df 0 (0), λ = c2d
and any given
N −1
−λ(X·e−ct)
e∈S
and k > 0, the function w(t, X) := ke
satisfies

∂t w − d∆w − f 0 (0)w = cλ − dλ2 − f 0 (0) w = 0.
Hence, by the concavity of f , it is a supersolution to (3.2) outside supp I0 . We choose k
large enough, independently of e, in such a way that w(0, X) > v(t, X) for all t > 0
and X ∈ supp I0 ∪ supp v(0, ·). Hence, by comparison, v(t, X) < w(t, X) for all t > 0,
X ∈ RN , and therefore, letting e vary in SN −1 , we get
v(t, x) 6 ke−λ(|X|−cSIR t) ,
which gives the desired limit.
Using the same reflection argument as in the proof of Theorem 5.1, one can show
that the solution v(t, X) to (3.2) is radially decreasing with respect to X outside the
support of I0 .
We conclude this section with a monotonicity result with respect to the diffusion
coefficient d. We assume now for simplicity that the initial datum v(0, ·) is identically
equal to 0.
Proposition 5.2. Under the assumption that I0 is radially decreasing, the values
v∞ (0) and v(t, 0), for any t > 0, are decreasing with respect to the diffusion coefficient d.
Proof. Let v 1 , v 2 be the solutions to (3.2) associated with the coefficients √
d = d1 and
2
j
j
d = d respectively, with 0 < d1 < d2 . The function ve (t, X) := v (t, dj X), for
j = 1, 2, satisfies
√
vetj − ∆e
v j = f (e
v j ) + I0 ( dj X) (t > 0, X ∈ R2 ).
Thus, owing to the monotonicity of I0 , the comparison principle yields ve1 (t, X) >
ve2 (t, X) for all t > 0, X ∈ RN , which, evaluated at X = 0, gives v 1 (t, 0) > v 2 (t, 0).

Moreover, because v j converges towards the steady state v∞
as t → +∞, thanks
to Theorem 3.2, one further derives

5.2

The SIRT model

We will make repeatedly use of the weak and strong comparison principles for the
road-field system. They are provided by [5, Proposition 3.2] in the case I0 ≡ 0,
and one can check that the presence of the bounded source term I0 does not affect
their proofs. When applied to a stationary subsolution (u, v) and supersolution (u, v)
satisfying (u, v) 6 (u, v), the strong comparison principle implies that the inequality
is strict unless (u, v) ≡ (u, v). Here and in the sequel, inequalities are understood
component-wise.
Proof of Theorem
p 3.4. We start with constructing a stationary supersolution to (3.5).
Take 0 < σ < α/d and define the functions
u := K

2ν + dσ
,
µ


v := K 1 + e−σy ,

(5.7)

where K is a positive constant that will be fixed later. The pair (u, v) satisfies the last
equation of (3.5). Moreover, we compute
−D∂xx u − νv(x, 0) + µu = 2dKσ,
−d∆v − f (v) > −Kdσ 2 − S0 + Kα,
We then choose K sufficiently large so that the above right-hand sides are larger than
max T0 and max I0 respectively. Then (u, v) is a supersolution to (3.5).
The existence of a positive, stationary solution follows from the sub/supersolution
method, applied with (0, 0) as a subsolution and (u, v) as a supersolution. Owing to
the strong maximum principle, this provides us with a solution
r
(0, 0) < (ur∞ , v∞
) < (u, v).

We derive the uniqueness result, as well as the limit at infinity, by distinguishing
the cases R0 6 1 and R0 > 1.
Case R0 > 1.
r
) is a supersolution to the problem with I0 , T0 ≡
The positive steady state (ur∞ , v∞
0, which reduces to the system studied in [5]. For such system, we know from [5,
Theorem 4.1] that positive solutions converge as t → +∞ to the steady state (ν/µ, 1)v∗
(v∗ = 1 for the f in [5]), whence by comparison,
r
(ur∞ , v∞
) > (ν/µ, 1)v∗ .

(5.8)

Consider a sequence ((xn , yn ))n∈N in R × R+ , with (yn )n∈N diverging to +∞. Then,
r
by elliptic estimates, as n → ∞, v∞
(x + xn , y + yn ) converges locally uniformly (up
to subsequences) towards a solution ve of the equation −d∆e
v = f (e
v ) in R2 . Moreover,
ve > v∗ due to (5.8). Then, as seen in the Proof of Theorem 3.1, we necessarily have
ve ≡ v∗ . This proves the second limit of the theorem in the case R0 > 1.
Take now a diverging sequence (xn )n∈N in R, and let (e
u(x), ve(x, y)) be the limit
r
of (a subsequence of) (ur∞ (x + xn ), v∞
(x + xn , y)), whose existence is guaranteed by
elliptic estimates up to the boundary. Thus, (e
u, ve) is a stationary solution of (3.5)
with I0 , T0 ≡ 0, which is positive due to (5.8). It follows from [5, Theorem 4.1] that
20

(e
u, ve) ≡ (ν/µ, 1)v∗ . This proves the first limit stated in the theorem (the uniformity
in y following from the first limit).
It remains to prove the uniqueness. Let (u1 , v1 ) and (u2 , v2 ) be two pairs of positive,
bounded, stationary solutions to (3.5). Assume by way of contradiction that

Suppose we are in the latter case. Then, exactly as in the proof of ..., the concavity
of f prevents the maximum from being achieved in the interior of R × R+ . Then, it is
achieved at some point (x̄, 0), and Hopf’s lemma yields
∂y (kv2 − v1 )(x̄, 0) > 0.
Using the third equation in (3.5), together with v1 (x̄, 0) = kv2 (x̄, 0), we find that
ku2 (x̄) = −

This is impossible because v1 < kv2 .
We have thereby shown that k 6 1, that is, (u1 , v1 ) 6 (u2 , v2 ). Exchanging the
roles of the solutions, yields the uniqueness result.
Case R0 6 1.
We start with the uniqueness result. We derive it in the more general framework of
nonnegative solutions, with possibly I0 ≡ 0. We need to show that, for any two pairs
(u1 , v1 ), (u2 , v2 ) of nonnegative, bounded, stationary solutions to (3.5), there holds
that (u1 , v1 ) 6 (u2 , v2 ). Assume by contradiction that, on the contrary,

21

This is impossible, because f 0 (0) = α(R0 − 1) 6 0 and hence f is decreasing on R+ .
If, instead, yn → 0 (up to subsequences), then the pairs (uj (x + xn ), vj (x + xn , y))
converge locally uniformly (up to subsequences) towards two solutions (e
uj , vej ) of the
same system, which is of the form (3.5) with I0 either translated by some vector (ξ, 0),
or replaced by 0. Moreover, (e
v1 − ve2 )(0, 0) = max(e
v1 − ve2 ) = h. If the maximum is also
attained at some interior point, we get the same contradiction as before. Therefore,
Hopf’s lemma yields
0 > d∂y (e

v1 − ve2 )(0, 0) − µ(e

This contradicts the definition of h.
Suppose now that
h=

Considering now a maximizing sequence (xn )n∈N for u1 − u2 , then the limits (up to
subsequences) (e
uj , vej ) of the translations (uj (x + xn ), vj (x + xn , y)), which, once again,
satisfy a system analogous to (3.5). The difference u

This contradicts supR×R+ (v1 − v2 ) < h.
The proof of the uniqueness is concluded. Let us pass to the limits at infinity. The
r
(x, y) → 0 as y → +∞, uniformly with respect to x, follows from the negativity
limit v∞
of f , exactly as in the above proof of Theorem 3.1. Consider now a diverging sequence
r
(x+xn , y)) converges locally
(xn )n∈N in R. The sequence of translations (ur∞ (x+xn ), v∞
uniformly (up to subsequences) towards a bounded, stationary solution (e
u, ve) to (3.5)
with I0 ≡ 0. We have seen above that the Liouville-type result holds for nonnegative
stationary solutions of such system, hence, necessarily, (e
u, ve) ≡ (0, 0). This concludes
the proof of the theorem.
We now turn to the set of results on the solution of the Cauchy problem (3.5)-(3.6).
Proof of Theorem 3.5. Since the initial datum (0, 0) is a subsolution to (3.5) which
is not a solution, the comparison principle implies that the solution (u, v) is strictly
increasing in t. It further implies that (u, v) is smaller than the supersolution constructed in the proof of Theorem 3.4, defined by (5.7). It follows that, as t → +∞,
(u, v) converges locally uniformly to a positive, bounded, stationary solution, which
r
necessarily coincides with (ur∞ , v∞
) due to Theorem 3.4.
Proof of Theorem 3.6. In the case I0 , T0 ≡ 0, the result reduces to [5, Theorem 1.1],
with the only difference that the initial datum there must not be identically equal to
(0, 0) (otherwise the solution remains (0, 0) for all times). In that case, the limit state
r
is simply (ur∞ , v∞
) ≡ (ν/µ, 1)v∗ . We call cTSIR the speed provided by [5, Theorem 1.1].
Take ε ∈ (0, cTSIR ) and consider a sequence (tn )n∈N diverging to +∞ and a sequence
(xn )n∈N in R such that |xn | 6 (cTSIR − ε)tn . If (xn )n∈N is bounded, then the convergence
of (u(xn ), v(xn , y)) towards the steady state follows from Theorem 3.5.
22

Suppose that (xn )n∈N diverges (up to subsequences). By the strong maximum
principle, the solution (u, v) is strictly larger than (0, 0) at, say, t = 1. Fitting a
compactly supported datum below it, and applying the spreading result from [5, Theorem 1.1] to the solution of (3.5) with I0 , T0 ≡ 0, emerging from such datum, we infer
by comparison that

comparison, (u, v) 6 (ur∞ , v∞
proved.
Let us derive the second limit. We restrict to x > 0, the case x < 0 being obtained
by a specular argument. We recall how the asymptotic speed – named here cTSIR –
is obtained in [5]: it is the least c so that the linearised form of (3.5) around (0, 0),
i.e. when f (v) is replaced by f 0 (0)v = α(R0 − 1)v and when I0 , T0 are set to 0, admits
plane wave solutions of the form

ϕ(t, x), ψ(t, x, y) = e−a(x−ct) (1, γe−by ), (a, b, γ) > (0, 0, 0).
Thus the triple (c, a, b) solves the algebraic system (the coefficient γ is easily computed
from the exchange condition):

−Da2 + ca + dbµ = 0
ν + db
−d(a2 + b2 ) + ca = α(R − 1).
0

Hence, for c = cTSIR , the pair (ϕ, ψ) above is a solution to the linearised system and
therefore, by the concavity of f , it is a supersolution to the original system (3.5) outside
the supports of I0 , T0 . The second limit in Theorem 3.6 for x > 0 then follows by
r
comparison with k(ϕ, ψ), with k sufficiently large so that k(ϕ, ψ) > (ur∞ , v∞
)(> (u, v))
inside the supports of I0 , T0 .
Proof of Proposition 3.7. For x ∈ R, define τ∗ (x) as the first time t such that
v(t, x, 0) =

v∗
.
2

This is possible due to Theorem 3.6 and (5.8). These also entail that the function τ∗ (x)
is locally bounded and satisfies (3.7). It is also clear that inf τ > 0, because v identically
vanishes at t = 0 and it is uniformly continuous by parabolic estimates. Assume (3.8)
to be false. Namely, there exists a sequence (xn )n∈N in R and a bounded sequence
(yn )n∈N in [0, +∞) such that one of the following situations occurs:
lim I(τ∗ (xn ), xn , yn ) = 0,

n→∞

or

lim T (τ∗ (xn ), xn ) = 0.

n→∞

(5.9)

Because τ (x) is bounded from below away from zero and bounded from above, and
I, T are positive for t > 0, we necessarily have that (xn )n∈N diverges. Set
Tn (t, x) := T (τ∗ (xn ) + t, xn + x), In (t, x, y) := I(τ∗ (xn ) + t, xn + x, y),
Sn (t, x, y) := S(τ∗ (xn ) + t, xn + x, y);
23

from parabolic estimates, a subsequence of (Sn , In , Tn )n∈N (that we may assume without loss of generality to be the whole sequence) converges to an entire (i.e., for all t ∈ R)
solution (S∞ , I∞ , T∞ ) of the SIRT system (2.2). We may also assume (yn )n∈N to converge to some y∞ > 0; by (5.9) we have that either I∞ (0, 0, y∞ ) = 0 or T∞ (0, 0) = 0. In
the latter case we deduce from the last equation in (2.2) that T∞ ≡ 0 and then I∞ ≡ 0;
in the former case the same conclusion follows from the strong maximum principle and
the Hopf lemma, using the first and third equations in (2.2). Set
un (t, x) = u(τ∗ (xn ) + t, xn + x), vn (t, x, y) = v(τ∗ (xn ) + t, xn + x, y);
as un = ∂t Tn and In = ∂t vn , a subsequence (that we may once again to be the whole
sequence) converges to a t-independent pair (u∞ (x), v∞ (x, y)), as their time derivatives
converge to 0 as n → ∞. So, (u∞ , v∞ ) is a stationary solution of (3.5) with I0 , T0 ≡ 0.
But we know from [5, Theorem 4.1] that the Liouville-property holds for such system,
that is, either (u∞ , v∞ ) ≡ (0, 0) or (u∞ , v∞ ) ≡ ( µν , 1)v∗ . This is impossible because
v∞ (0, 0) = lim v(τ∗ (xn ), xn , 0) =

v∗

by the definition of τ∗ (x).
We now prove the result about the rate of decay of the steady state.
Proof of Theorem 4.1. We derive these limits in the case x → +∞, the limits at −∞
being analogous.
Upper bound.
In order to simultaneously treat the cases R0 6 1 and R0 > 1, we set in the former
v∗ := 0. It follows that f 0 (v∗ ) 6 0 for all R0 > 0. Consider the pair (e
u, ve) given
by (4.2), with (a, b, γ) = (a∗ , b∗ , γ∗ ) unique positive solution of (4.3) if R0 6= 1, or
(a∗ , b∗ , γ∗ ) = (0, 0, µ/ν) if R0 = 1. Namely, (e
u, ve) satisfies the linearised problem (4.1).
By the concavity of f , we see that, for h > 0,

than the supersolution (u, v) used in the proof of Theorem 3.4, defined by (5.7). As a

and, in addition, that in the half-strip S ε , (u, v) is smaller than the supersolution (u, v)

having (u, v) as initial datum. We know from the Liouville-type result that (u, v) &

v(t, 0, y) > v∞
(0, y) > v(0, y),

and moreover v(t, x, y ε ) > 0 = v(x, y ε ) for x > 0. We can therefore apply the comparison principle for the road-field system in the half-strip S ε and deduce that, there,
(u, v) remains larger than (u, v) for all t > 0. Thus, we infer that

Owing to the arbitrariness of ζ > −f 0 (v∗ ) and 0 < ε < 1, one then gets the desired
lower bound using (4.6) and noticing that y ε → +∞ as ε → 0.
We conclude with the comparison between the steady state for the models without
and with the line.
Proof of Theorem 4.2. The existence of the set E + , of the form |x| > ρ, y < h, directly
follows from Theorems 5.1 and 4.1. Let us show the existence of E − .
In the case where I0 (x, y) is symmetric with respect to y, the stationary solution v∞
is symmetric with respect to y too, by uniqueness. Instead, if supp I0 ⊂ R × [0, +∞)
then we know that v∞ (x, y) is decreasing with respect to y in [0, +∞), for any x ∈ R.
Then, in any case, ∂y v∞ (x, 0) 6 0 for all x ∈ R. Thus, integrating the equation

The influence of R0 and other parameters

We wish to understand here how the different coefficients in our model will influence
the speed cTSIR . For that we first write (2.2) in non-dimensional form. We then write
the algebraic system that leads to the (non-dimensional) velocity. Finally, we study
how the reduced parameters will contribute to the enhancement of the SIRT velocity.

large minimal speed wSIR
is only slightly larger than 1. So, wSIR is now a small parameter. From the second
equation of (6.2) we suspect that a, b and w will scale like wSIR , while the first equation
leads us to think that a will additionally scale like D−1/2 , and that w will scale like
D1/2 . So, we perform a last round of scalings:

Recall now that we are interested in a situation where R0 is slightly above 1, that
is, wSIR is small. From the scalings (6.3), enhancement of propagation by the line
should be achieved by a large reduced diffusion coefficient D. As the parameter ρ
T

is proportional to wSIR , we anticipate that it will be small. Let ωSIR

Discussion and conclusions

In this paper, we discuss the effects of the presence of a road on the spatial propagation
of an epidemic within the context of a spatial SIR model. The road has specific
diffusion and infected can travel faster along it. To this end, we introduce a new model
that we call a SIRT model. In addition to the classical S, I and R compartments, it
involves a compartment T for travelling infected on this road. Here we only discuss
the case of local Brownian diffusion and local interactions. In a forthcoming paper [8],
we carry an analogous analysis for non-local interactions.
By means of a classical transformation, this model can be reduced to a system
involving a non-homogeneous Fisher-KPP type equation. The unknown functions for
this system are
Z t
Z t
I(t, x, y)ds.
T (s, x)ds,
v(t, x, y) :=
u(t, x) :=

0

This allows us to extend previous works and to derive some rather precise properties
of this model. The main outcomes of our work are the following.
1. We first show that the SIRT system in the (u, v) unknowns admits a unique
positive (bounded) steady state, which describes the long-time behaviour of the
solutions of the evolution system. When R0 6 1, this steady state tends to 0
at infinity. We interpret this as saying that the epidemic does not propagate.
On the contrary, when R0 > 1, the steady state converges to some positive
constant and the epidemic has propagated. Thus, the position of R0 relative to
1 still governs the propagation or dying out of the epidemic. At this stage, the
scenario is exactly the same as for the standard SIR model.
2. We compute an asymptotic speed of propagation for this model, that we call cTSIR ,
and compare it with cSIR , the speed of propagation for the classical SIR model
with diffusion (2.1). We show that cTSIR > cSIR if D > 2d, where D and d are
the diffusion coefficients on the road and in the rest of the territory respectively.
In the case D 6 2d, then, cTSIR = cSIR . Thus, the presence of a road with fast
diffusion enhances the speed of propagation of the epidemic.
3. We show that the SIRT system is governed by four parameters: the basic reproduction number R0 (from which the classical SIR speed of propagation is computed), the reduced transmission coefficients µ̄ and ν̄, and the ratio D = D/d
29

between the diffusion on the road and the diffusion in the field. We find that,
even if R0 is very close to 1, the diffusion on the road may trigger a wave of
contamination spreading at high speed. Even though the growth of the infection
at each location may be slow, the propagation along the road may be fast. This
may lead to situations where an epidemic may seem dormant and thus innocuous
while it spreads seeds far away bringing about outbreaks and clusters apparently
unconnected to the regions with a significant prevalence.
4. We compare the total cumulative number of infected individuals per location,
Itot (x), in the cases with and without the road. We show that, compared with
the standard SIR model, the Itot (x) in the presence of the road is larger in the
range of x large, that is, far from the epicentre of the epidemic. This result is not
intuitive a priori. Indeed, from the enhancement of the speed of spreading of the
epidemic wave by the road, it also follows that at any location the epidemic peak
lasts less than without this enhancement. Therefore, one might have thought
that, moving faster, the total number of infected by the epidemic would go down.
However, far from the epicentre, the contrary happens. We also prove that
while the total number of infected is higher far away, there is also a region E − ,
presumably close to the epicentre, where the total number of infected Itot (x) for
the model with the road is smaller than the corresponding one for the standard
SIR model. It would be interesting to characterise such a set E − in some specific
cases, establishing for instance whether it actually contains the epicentre of the
epidemic. We leave this as an open question.
The lower number of infected near the epicentre due to the presence of the road
could be related to another phenomenon that we observe on the standard SIR
model. In Proposition 5.2 above we prove that the quantity Itot (x) evaluated at
the epicentre of the epidemic x = 0 is a decreasing function of the diffusion coefficient d. This reflects the fact that a higher diffusion coefficient “scatters” more
quickly the infected individuals far from the epicentre. The same mechanism
could be at work for our model SIRT , where the road allows for more infected
individuals to move away from the centre.
5. In a general manner, the SIRT -type of models we introduce here adds a compartment in the population dynamics and fills a gap at an intermediate scale.
Indeed, for instance, most models presently used in monitoring the COVID19 epidemic rely on the detailed analysis of two types of networks: the global
network of air travel or the microscopic socio-economic or family and schools
network. As our analysis shows, the intermediate network of roads and railways
play an important role in the spatial spreading of epidemics at levels of a region
or a country.
This model and its generalisations open the way to many open problems. For
instance, a similar study would have to be carried out when there is diffusion not only

The model we have presented and analysed in this paper sheds light on the effect
of a road within an environment of slow diffusion for the spreading of epidemics. It
allows us to explain some observations and to uncover various effects. The simplified
structure allows us to carry a fairly complete mathematical analysis. Yet, this model
could lend itself to more practical developments. Indeed, involving a newtork of roads
should yield more precise results. To take into account roads in a more realistic fashion
in discrete models is an important perspective.
