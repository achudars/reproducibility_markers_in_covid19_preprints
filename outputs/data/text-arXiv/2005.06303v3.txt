Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in school closures and distancing requirements that
have disrupted both work and family life for many. Concerns exist that these disruptions caused
by the pandemic may not have influenced men and women researchers equally. Many medical
journals have published papers on the pandemic, which were generated by researchers facing the
challenges of these disruptions. Here we report the results of an analysis that compared the
gender distribution of authors on 1,893 medical papers related to the pandemic with that on
papers published in the same journals in 2019, for papers with first authors and last authors from
the United States. Using mixed-effects regression models, we estimated that the proportion of
COVID-19 papers with a woman first author was 19% lower than that for papers published in the
same journals in 2019, while our comparisons for last authors and overall proportion of women
authors per paper were inconclusive. A closer examination suggested that women’s representation
as first authors of COVID-19 research was particularly low for papers published in March and
April 2020. Our findings are consistent with the idea that the research productivity of women,
especially early-career women, has been affected more than the research productivity of men.

Introduction
During the COVID-19 pandemic, many governments have shuttered schools and implemented social
distancing requirements that limit options for childcare, while simultaneously requiring researchers to
work from home (Minello, 2020). Robust evidence suggests that women in academic medicine shoulder
more of the burden of domestic labor within their households than do men. One study of an elite sample
of NIH-funded physician-researchers showed that women spent 8.5 hours more per week on parenting
and domestic tasks than their men peers (Jolly et al., 2014). Recent research also suggests that women in
academia take on more domestic responsibilities than men, even in dual-career academic couples (Derrick
et al., 2019). Therefore, the recent restrictions in access to childcare might reasonably be expected to have
disproportionate impact on women in academic medicine, as compared to men (Viglione, 2020). The
impact of new professional service demands that now compete with time for scholarly productivity in
academic medicine, including restructuring of teaching and clinical care using virtual platforms, may also
disproportionately impact women medical researchers, who are disproportionately represented on
clinician-educator tracks (Mayer et al., 2014).

2

Here, we focus on the published medical research literature, where it may be possible to provide an early
evaluation of whether the gender gap in academic productivity is widening. The medical literature now
includes a substantial number of articles directly relating to COVID-19, mostly generated rapidly after the
broader social restrictions came into being, in most US states, in March 2020. We identified 15,839
articles on COVID-19 published between January 1st and June 5th 2020, including 1,893 articles that had a
first author and/or last author with an affiliation in the US. Here we report the results of an analysis that
compared the proportion of women scientists in various author positions in this sample and a sample of
85,373 papers published in the same journals in 2019 (with first and/or last authors with a US affiliation;
see Materials and Methods for details).

Results
Panels a, b and c (figure 1) juxtapose the observed proportion of women authors (bars) for COVID-19
papers and for papers published in the same journals in 2019. This descriptive analysis suggests that
women’s respective share of first authorships, last authorships and overall representation per paper is
14%, 3% and 5% lower for COVID-19 papers compared to 2019 papers (COVID-19 sample: first
authorships, arithmetic mean= 0.33; last authorships, arithmetic mean: 0.28, overall proportion: 0.33;
2019 sample: first authorships, arithmetic mean= 0.38; last authorships, arithmetic mean: 0.29; overall
proportion: arithmetic mean= 0.35).
The crosses and error-bars in figure 1 (panels a, b and c) plot the adjusted means and 95% confidence
intervals derived from three mixed regression models that adjust for variations in COVID-19 related
research activities across scientific journals. The plots suggest that women’s estimated share of first
authorships, last authorships, and overall proportion per paper is 19%, 5% and 8% lower in the COVID19 sample (first authorships, adjusted mean= 0.32, CI: 0.28-0.36; last authorships, adjusted mean: 0.26,
CI: 0.23-0.30; overall proportion, adjusted mean= 0.36, CI: 0.33-0.30) than in the 2019 sample (first
authorships, adjusted mean: 0.40, CI: 0.37-0.42; last authorships, adjusted mean: 0.28, CI: 0.26-0.31;
overall proportion, adjusted mean: 0.38, CI: 0.36-0.40) (see Figure 1- source data 1 to 3 for model
specifications). However, as indicated by the overlapping confidence intervals in panels b and c, the
results are inconclusive for last authorships and for the overall proportion of women per paper.
An earlier iteration of this study (https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.06303v2) based on COVID-19 papers
published between January 1st and May 5th 2020 suggested larger differences than those reported here.
3

Specifically, we found that women's share of first authorships, last authorships and general representation
per author group was 23%, 16% and 16% lower for COVID-19 papers compared to 2019 papers
published in the same journals. The present analysis covers a larger publication window of COVID-19
research (January 1st and June 5th 2020), which has increased the sample from 1,179 US-based COVID19 papers to 1,893 (61% increase). Moreover, the present analysis is restricted to COVID-19 papers
authored by US-based first and/or last authors, while the prior analysis included all papers with at least
one US-based author. While this difference in sampling criteria might explain part of the observed
variation in outcomes, we wanted to examine whether there has been a change over time. In panels d to f
in figure 1, we report the estimated proportion of women first authors (d), last authors (e) and overall
representation per paper (f), for studies published in 2019 (orange crosshairs), during March and April
2020 (blue crosshairs) and in May 2020 (purple crosshairs). All three models indicate lower participation
rates for women in March and April 2020 compared to May 2020, but the uncertainty of the estimates
make these results inconclusive. However, panel d shows that the relative difference between women’s
proportion of first-authored COVID-19 papers compared to 2019 papers increases to 23%, when the
COVID-19 sample is restricted to papers published in March and April 2020.

Figure 1: COVID-19 papers have fewer female authors than papers from 2019 published in the same journals. Observed
(bars) and estimated (crosses and error-bars) proportions of women among authors of 1,179 U.S. papers on COVID-19
and 37,531 papers published in the same journals in 2019. The bars show differences in the observed proportions of
women in different author positions (a and b) and for the complete author list (c), for papers published in 2020 COVID19 papers (blue bars) versus papers from the same journals in 2019 (orange bars). All three panels suggest a decrease in
the observed proportion of women. The crosses and error-bars laid over the bars report the adjusted means and 95%
confidence intervals derived from mixed regression models with scientific journal as random effect parameter. Panels d-f
show the change from 2019 to those papers published in March and April 2020 or May 2020. For all models, there is a
drop in March and April, followed by some, but not full, resurgence in May. However, the uncertainty of the estimates
make these comparisons inconclusive.

To obtain a closer approximation of differences across research areas, we calculated the proportion of
women authorships per journal specialty. As shown in Table 1, women are represented at lower rates
across most specialty groupings in the COVID-19 sample as compared to the 2019 sample. The relative
gap in women’s participation is most salient in infectious diseases, radiology, pathology, and public
health. Importantly, none of these groups show extreme deviations from the overall trend. This suggests
that the observed differences are not due to a journal-specialty bias, where specialties with a high
representation of men produce the majority of COVID-19 research.

Table 1. Number of observations, N, and proportion of women by author list position for journals grouped by their
specialty. The grouped columns show results by journal specialty for COVID papers published in 2020 (four rightmost

clear gender for first and last author are included.

Discussion
Prior research has raised concerns about women’s underrepresentation among authors of medical
research, including both original research and commentaries (Clark et al., 2017; Hart and Perlis, 2019;
Jagsi et al., 2006; Larson et al., 2019; Silver et al., 2018). Our study suggests that the COVID-19
pandemic might have amplified this gender gap in the medical literature. Specifically, we find that
women constitute a lower share of first authors of articles on COVID-19, as compared to the proportion
6

of women among first authors of all articles published in the same journals the previous year. However,
our analysis also indicates that the first-author gender gap in COVID-19 research might have decreased
during the past month of the pandemic. Our findings are consistent with a contemporaneous study of preprints (Vincent-Lamarre et al., 2020), which also found women to be under-represented
Our findings are consistent with the idea that restricted access to child-care and increased work-related
service demands might have taken the greatest toll on early-career women, particularly early on when the
disruptions were most unexpected, although our observational data cannot conclusively support causal
claims. As more robust evidence becomes available, mechanisms which disadvantage specific ethnic, age
and gender groups should be monitored and inform policies that promote equity (Donald, 2020).
Some have argued that the authorship gender gap in academic medicine is best explained by a slow
pipeline and the historical exclusion of women from medical school enrollment (Association of American
Medical Colleges, 2019). However, as time has passed, and women have reached parity in the United
States and even begun to constitute the majority of the medical student body in many other countries,
their persistently low participation as authors has raised concerns about bias in unblinded peer review
processes and unequal opportunities prior to manuscript submission (Jagsi et al., 2014; Silver, 2019).
Studies have demonstrated differences in the very language used by men and women to describe their
research findings (Lerchenmueller et al., 2019), and evidence suggests that women’s writing may be held
to higher standards (Hengel, 2017). In any case, the current study suggest that if authorship of COVID19-related papers is a bellwether, women’s participation in the medical research literature may now be
facing even greater challenges than before the pandemic (Kissler et al., 2020).
This study is limited to a relatively small sample produced early in the course of the pandemic and misses
information on important covariates. A key limitation is that we have not been able to adjust for variations
in COVID-19 related research activities across medical research specialties. Since women’s
representation as authors varies across specialties (Andersen et al. 2019), this may introduce a bias. We
have attempted to mitigate this bias by including scientific journal as random effect parameter in the
regression models, hereby adjusting for variations in COVID-19 related research activities across
publication outlets. Moreover, descriptive analysis that breaks down our results by journal specialty does
not suggest that those journal specialties that might dominate research related to COVID had low
proportions of women among authors in 2019. Indeed, many such specialties, including infectious disease
and public health, qualitatively appear to have a markedly lower proportion of women among authors in
the 2020 COVID-related dataset than in the 2019 dataset within those fields. Nevertheless, future research
7

might refine our analysis by using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) to infer the research specialty of
each paper (Andersen et al. 2019). The US National Library of Medicine usually assign MeSH terms to
medical papers within 3-6 months after publication.

Although we were reliably able to determine gender for the vast majority of the first and last
authors and a large majority of all authors, bias is possible due to omission of those whose
gender could not be determined. There is no difference in the percentage of matched names
between the treatment and control groups.
Despite limitations, this early look suggests that the previously documented gender gap in academic
medical publishing may warrant renewed attention (Jagsi et al., 2006), and that ongoing research on this
subject is necessary as more data become available. The need for greater equity and diversity is most
evident in times of crisis. Abundant literature reveals the importance of diverse teams for solving complex
problems like those related to COVID-19 (Mayer et al., 2014; Nielsen et al., 2017a, 2018; Phillips et al.,
2014; Woolley et al., 2010). If societal constraints limit the talent pool who may contribute to research
informing the crisis response, the consequences will be profound indeed. Policies to support the full
inclusion of diverse scholars and transformation of norms for dividing labor appear to be urgent priorities.
Policies that merit consideration include providing more teaching support for female faculty or relieving
them of teaching duties, supporting child-care costs and identifying child-care options, extending the
tenure-clock for the duration of the lockdown, or adjusting the criteria used to assess and select candidates
for research funding and tenured positions.

Materials & methods
On June 5th 2020, we searched PubMed Medline for papers including “COVID-19” or “SARS-CoV2” in
the title or abstract, to identify publications most likely generated after pandemic-related societal changes
developed. This resulted in 15,843 articles, of which only 4 were published prior to 2020. We extracted
journal information and matched the 2020 papers [treatment] to 2019 papers [control] from the same
journals (N = 316,367). Only journals with at least 5 papers on COVID-19 were included in the analysis
(629 of 2,420 journals (25.9%), 12,855 of 15,843 papers (81.1%)). We extracted author names for both
treatment and control, and used these to determine author gender as in prior work (Andersen et al., 2019;
Nielsen et al., 2017b). Please see these papers for a clarification of the gender-API algorithm and our
robustness checks of gender inference. Gender was reliably estimated for 90.2% of the entire sample. The
majority of insecure inferences are due to Chinese names, which are commonly not gendered (Andersen
et al., 2019; Nielsen et al., 2017b). For the papers with at least one US author, gender could be established
for 90.7% of US first authors and 91.7% of US last authors. Only papers with gender reliably identified
for first and last authors were included. Limiting the sample further to papers with at first author and/or
last author with a US address, with gender determined for authors, gives us a treatment group of 1,893
papers (14.7%) and a control group of 85,373 papers (30.0%). The treatment group is relatively smaller,
because proportionally more COVID-19 research has been done by researchers outside the US, especially
those in China and Italy.
As a robustness check, we selected a random sample of 300 publications from the treatment group and
looked up information supplied by the publishers on submission and publication dates. Far from all
publishers offer this information and to our knowledge there are no databases gathering this information
consistently. Thus, we were able to find submission dates for 153 (51.0%) of the 300 publications. Of
these, 129 (84.3%) were submitted after March 15th, 2020, and 276 of the 300 (92.0%) were published
after this date.
We used mixed logit models with random intercepts and random slopes to estimate the relationship
between the dichotomous intervention variable (2019 sample=0, COVID-19 sample=1) and (i) women’s
share of first authorships (outcome variable: man=0, woman=1), (ii) women’s share of last authorships
(outcome variable: man=0, woman=1), and (iii) women’s overall representation per article (two-vector
outcome variable: number of women, number of men) (Crawley, 2012). We included scientific journal as

9

random effect parameter to adjust for variations in COVID-related research activities across scientific
journals.
For the time factor analysis, we used the date of electronic publication (or date of publication, if
electronic publication date was not available) from PubMed to create dichotomous variables for COVID19 studies published in March/April 2020 and May 2020. Following the procedure specified above, we
used mixed logit models to estimate the relationship between these time-specific dichotomous and the
three outcome measures.
The statistical analyses were conducted in R version 4.0.0. For the mixed logit models, we used the
“lme4” v. 1.1-23 package in R. We used the “emmeans” v. 1.4.7 package to produce adjusted means and
“ggplot2” v. 3.3.0 to produce figures.
To produce Table 1, we manually categorized journals by specialty. Four authors participated in grouping
the journals, with at least two independently coding every journal, and with discrepancies addressed by
team consensus.
