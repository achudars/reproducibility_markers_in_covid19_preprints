The annual meeting of the European Astronomical Society took place in Lyon, France,
in 2019, but in 2020 it was held online only due the COVID-19 pandemic. The carbon
footprint of the virtual meeting was roughly 3,000 times smaller than the face-to-face
one, providing encouragement for more ecologically minded conferencing.
The scientific evidence that we live in a climate emergency calls for urgent action8. As a
society, we are collectively failing to live within our environmental boundaries9 with possibly
catastrophic consequences for human civilisation​1​. The time to address these issues is now​1,
10
. The United Nations Emissions Gap Report from 2019 states that each year a global
reduction of emissions of 7.6% is required to limit the average global temperature rise to
1.5​°C​3​ - the target that was outlined in the Paris agreement in 201611. At the current rate of
emissions, we will exceed the ‘carbon budget’ to meet this goal within the next eight years12.
While ultimately system change is required to solve the climate crisis, there is also the
responsibility of individuals to reduce our emissions. This applies in particular to astronomers
who rely heavily on fossil fuel energy for, e.g. computation, telescope operation and travel13,

,. To future-proof astronomy, we must recognise impending environmental change,
financial uncertainties and the need for moral introspection, which threaten to hinder the
continuation of the discipline. At the same time, the advancement and sharing of knowledge
in general is becoming even more vital as we face a global threat.

EWASS 2019 equivalent emissions
Conferences are a vital element of astrophysical research and collaboration, but the air
travel often connected with face-to-face conferences is a major source of concern. Following
last year’s annual European Astronomical Society meeting in Lyon (EWASS2019), we
conducted a short survey among participants who had agreed to receive such
communication via email (719 out of 1240), to estimate the current, collective carbon
emissions generated through travel by attendees. In establishing this initial estimate it was
hoped that guidance could be developed to reduce future travel-related emissions. The
anonymous questionnaire was very simple and only asked for the participants’ origin and
final destination and their main mode of transport. After two weeks we had collected 267
(22% of all participants) valid responses.
Just over two thirds of the respondents (66.9%) indicated that they arrived in Lyon by
airplane, 27.8% arrived by train and the remaining 5.3% used other means of transport such
as car, bus, metro, bike or by foot. 86.5% returned directly to their origin after the conference
using the same means of transport. Of those who did not, the modal split was similar to the
inbound journey.
We computed the CO​2​-equivalent emissions (CO2eq) associated with every plane or train
trip using the online Travel Footprint Calculator16 with its default settings and we refer to the
accompanying paper17 for a discussion on the pitfalls of the methods used in these
calculations (e.g. assumptions about the Radiative Forcing Index). For car trips, we used
Google Maps to compute the shortest road distance and assumed emissions of 110 g/km18.
The result of this computation is shown in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1: Histogram of CO2eq emissions per trip (histogram and left axis) and cumulative
emissions (red line and right axis). Some example destinations are indicated for reference.
Note that these numbers refer to respondents only (~ 22% of all participants).
The majority of trips (~80%) produced CO2eq emissions of less than 1000 kg per trip.
Conversely, the intercontinental flights (~ 10% of all trips) produced 50% of the total
emissions of respondents.
In addition we also looked up the equivalent train travel time for all European travellers who
arrived by plane, except for those where a train connection does (currently) not exist. This
resulted in 159 theoretically possible train connections. 135 (85%) of these would take less
than 24 hours; 114 (72%) less than 15 hours. We show a histogram of the latter together
with the (looked up) train travel times for those 74 respondents who actually journeyed by
train in Fig. 2.

Fig. 2: Actual or hypothetical train travel time to Lyon for all European participants who
actually traveled by train (green) or could have traveled by train but took the plane (orange).
Train travel times for the six countries with most participants are indicated as horizontal bars.
Note that these numbers refer only to those participants who filled the survey (~ 22% of all
participants).

From additional data shared by the EAS, we know that ~ 84% of all participants (not just
survey respondents) came from European destinations which are almost all accessible by
train. The majority of EWASS 2019 participants could therefore have traveled to Lyon by
train if they could have spent some more (working) time for the travel. It is important to note
that a two hour flight usually converts into at least four hours of door-to-door travel time of
which only a small fraction of time can be used for productive work. On the other hand, the
median train travel time for those 85% of participants who could have traveled by train, was
eight hours. Most of this time can be used productively for work, especially if traveling in
modern trains that are equipped with power sockets and reliable WiFi connections. If a full
week of conferencing (Monday, 9 am till Friday 5 pm) is to be combined with train travel,
however, this requires flexibility for the participants to spend weekend days for travel, which
may not always be possible. Another obstacle for choosing the train instead of the plane are
the often higher costs of train tickets compared to equivalent airfares. This does not reflect
the real costs of both modes of transport, however, since air fares do not include VAT or
taxes on energy, and also do not usually include compensation for the significant
environmental damage that airplanes create. On the other hand, some universities, including

the Dutch universities of Leiden and Groningen and the Belgian university of Ghent, already
have environmental-friendly travel policies in place that require researchers to take the train
for connections that take less than six hours and recommend to take the train for
connections that take up to eight hours.
Lastly, we estimated the total travel emissions associated with EWASS 2019 by correcting,
country-per-country, for incompleteness in our survey responses. For example, to compute
the total travel emissions for all Dutch participants, we computed the average emissions of
Dutch respondents for both their outbound and return trip (673 kg) and multiplied this by the
total number of participants from this country (78). This assumes a similar modal split (plane
vs. train) for those participants who did not fill in the travel survey. The total travel emissions
for all 1240 participants is then an estimated 1855 t CO2eq. This is of the same order of
magnitude as the ​yearly​ emissions of a medium-sized astronomical research institute (e.g.
the emissions of the MPIA in Heidelberg19 were 2726 t CO2eq in 2018). The average
per-capita travel emissions for EWASS 2019 (1.5 t) are also comparable to the ​annual
emissions of developing countries (e.g. India: 1.8 t20). It gives a sense of the scale of the
problem and the responsibility that we have that the ​additional​ emissions burden involved in
one average astronomer participating in a single conference in Europe is roughly equal to
the average total annual per capita emissions in India.
We note that our brief analysis does not include other emissions / waste associated with
single-use items (such as plastic bottles, conference booklets, other give-aways), extra food
production, energy for the building etc. We estimate that these factors are only a small
fraction of the travel-related emissions, however (e.g. based on K. Jahnke’s analysis of the
carbon footprint of the Max-Planck-Institute for Astronomy21).

EAS 2020 equivalent emissions
We can also compare the EWASS 2019 travel emissions to EAS 2020 -- the first online-only
version of the European Astronomical Society’s annual meeting: With 1777 participants,
EAS 2020 was the largest online astronomy meeting to date – a change that impacted not
only carbon emissions, but also diversity and inclusivity, as a forthcoming article will
illustrate.
681/1777 participants (38%) answered the EAS 2020 exit survey and of those, 57% said
they would have taken the plane if they had travelled to Leiden. This number is lower than
last year’s (67%) which may be connected to the fact that Leiden (via Rotterdam or Utrecht)
is well connected to the high-speed rail network (e.g. direct connections to Paris, Brussels,
London, Cologne, Frankfurt). Nevertheless, this result may also give reason to hope that
astronomers are becoming more aware of the environmental damage that flying causes.

Of course EAS 2020 was not entirely carbon-neutral either, since virtual conferencing
consumes a considerable amount of electrical energy both at the end user’s site and for
running the network infrastructure (and servers). A simple estimation can be made based on
the fraction of people joining each of the five days of the conference (~80%, based on the
exit survey), the number of hours people were online per day (5.5 hours, based on the exit
survey), the data rate of a Zoom webinar (1.2 Mbps downstream22) and the electricity use
per Gigabyte transferred over the internet (0.06 kWh/GB for 201523). In addition, electrical
energy is required for running the participants’ laptops (~ 30 W) and the Zoom server itself.
For the latter we estimate that a single 24-core Xeon machine would suffice which consumes
approximately 300 W of electrical power. The total electrical energy consumption for EAS
2020 is then 1173 kWh (laptops), 1263 kWh (network) and 15 kWh (Zoom servers). With the
CO2eq emission intensity for electricity generation (240 g CO2eq/kWh24) we arrive at a total
carbon footprint for EAS 2020 of 588 kg – roughly the emissions of a ​single​ return trip by
airplane from Liverpool to Lyon.25
We conclude that the internet-related emissions of EAS 2020 were insignificant compared to
the travel-related emissions alone of EWASS 2019. This is comparable to other recent
estimates for large international conference, e.g. a virtual annual meeting of the American
Geophysical Union was calculated to emit less than 0.1% of the travel emissions of the real
AGU 2019 meeting26.
The emerging picture is that there is a real opportunity for future EAS meetings to adopt
practices that provide a range of attendance possibilities for participants, which promote a
more sustainable, accessible and diverse meeting concept for the growing international
community.

Note that this estimation does not take into account electricity consumption for routers/modem at
home as well as other home electricity use such as lighting/heating/air condition. We assume that
these facilities would anyhow be running. Since laptops are normally also in use during working hours,
the number above can therefore be seen as a conservative estimate of the added emissions of joining
EAS 2020 compared to working in the home office.
