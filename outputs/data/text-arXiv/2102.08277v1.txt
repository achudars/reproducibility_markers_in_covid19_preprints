Most of the works on the dispersion of droplets and their COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease) implications
address droplets’ dynamics in quiescent environments. As most droplets in a common situation are immersed
in external flows (such as ambient flows), we consider the effect of canonical flow profiles namely, shear flow,
Poiseuille flow, and unsteady shear flow on the transport of spherical droplets of radius ranging from 5µm
to 100 µm, which are characteristic lengths in human talking, coughing or sneezing processes. The dynamics
we employ satisfies the Maxey-Riley (M-R) equation. An order-of-magnitude estimate allows us to solve
the M-R equation to leading order analytically, and to higher order (accounting for the Boussinesq-Basset
memory term) numerically. Discarding evaporation, our results to leading order indicate that the maximum
travelled distance for small droplets (5µm radius) under a shear/Poiseuille external flow with a maximum
flow speed of 1m/s may easily reach more than 250 meters, since those droplets remain in the air for around
600 seconds. The maximum travelled distance was also calculated to leading and higher orders, and it is
observed that there is a small difference between the leading and higher order results, and that it depends
on the strength of the flow. For example, this difference for droplets of radius 5µm in a shear flow, and with
a maximum wind speed of 5m/s, is seen to be around 2m. In general, higher order terms are observed to
slightly enhance droplets’ dispersion and their flying time.

INTRODUCTION

So far, COVID pandemic is still growing, as of 18:34pm
Central European Time (CET), February 6 2021, there
have been 104, 956, 439 corroborated cases of COVID-19,
encompassing 2, 290, 488 deaths, reported to the World
Health Organization (WHO). It is believed that airborne transmission is one of the main mechanisms for
COVID spreading1,2 and that potential sources of infected droplets are breathing, sneezing, coughing or simply talking. Unfortunately, most of the reported literature neglects the effect of ambient flows on droplets
transport. These flows are often present in daily activities such a wind flows, ventilation generated currents in
offices, homes, malls, among other public places.
Recent studies suggest that talking may be among
the most dangerous mechanisms for generating infected
droplets1,3–5 . According to Tan5 and Bourouiba6 , speech
induced plumes can travel 1.3m in 2s or even 8m, which
is a distance way longer than the 2m social distancing.
Abkarian and Stone3 using high-speed imaging showed
that pronouncing consonants (typical to many languages)
such as ’Pa’,’Ba’, and ’Ka’ are potent aerolization mechanisms. Abkarian et al 4 using theory, experiments, and
simulations documented the flow generated after speaking and breathing, which is in fact the responsible for
droplets’ transport. Notice that the 2m social distancing, only considered quiescent flows4,6,7 . This situation
is not always satisfied in daily conditions, where wind is
frequently present either naturally or induced by air condition in buildings or even by simple motion of people8 .

disease possible enhanced by air currents are: A reported
infection of 96 people out of 216 working in a eleventh
floor in a call center of South Korea9 ; a singing rehearsal
in Washington, where 53 singers were infected even they
were located in a volleyball court but ventilation air currents were present5 . A study precisely on the effectiveness of air ventilation and COVID implications8 suggests
that only certain type of ventilation called ’displacement
ventilation’ properly designed to extract contaminated
hot air, could be the most effective air condition mechanism to reduce the risk of infection. Related works where
droplets produced by breathing, sneezing, coughing, or
talking, and immersed in external flows are few. Some
examples are Cummins et al 10 who studied micrometric
spherical droplets in the presence of a source-sink flow,
which simulated a scenario where droplets are produced
and subjected to an extraction mechanism (air condition). Incorporating evaporation, humidity, and an uniform external wind, Dbouk and Drikakis11 presented a
conjugated heat and flow transfer problem (occurring in
a saliva droplet) and coupled to a CFD analysis. They
proposed a transient Nusselt number and varied relative
humidity (RH), temperature, and speed of flow. Contrary to past studies, they conclude that evaporation
of droplets is enhanced at low RH and high temperatures. As an example, they results indicate that in a
cloud of droplets in an environment at RH=50%, temperature T < 30o C, and under an external flow of 4km/h,
there will not be evaporation. Their simulation however, only reached five seconds, hence the full dispersion of droplets could not be reached. B. Blocken et al 12
also performed a CFD analysis for people exhaling while
walking or running, and emanating from them possible
infected droplets. However, their simulation only considered droplets of radius 20µm and beyond. As it has

recently been observed, the smallest the size of a droplet,
the more dangerous it may be13 . Feng et al 14 located
two virtual humans 3.05m apart and let one human to
eject droplets while coughing or sneezing. Using a computational particle fluid dynamics model that considered
evaporation, external wind and condensation, and even
Brownian motion, they found that at this distance, potentially infected droplets easily reach hair and face of
the other human. They also performed a study on the
filtration efficiency of several masks. In conclusion, most
of the previous works suggest that the safe distancing is
not enough under wind conditions.
In this work, we consider micrometrical spherical
droplets emanating from a person while talking either normally (exit speed of droplets around 1m/s) or
strongly (exit speed of droplets around 5m/s)4,10 , and
under the presence of external flow currents, and calculate, following the Maxey-Riley (M-R) equation15 , their
effect on the maximum spreading of droplets of constant
radius ranging from 5µm to 100µm. The wind currents
profiles are modeled as a shear flow, a Poiseuille flow,
and an unsteady shear flow that considers the typical
time-dependent situation of wind blowing and ceasing.
The present study is organized as follows: Section II describes the model, and the order-of-magnitude of each
term in the M-R equation. Section III presents analytical
results for the dispersion of micrometric droplets subject
to three external flow profiles namely, shear, Poiseuille,
and unsteady shear flow. Here, the Boussinesq-Basset
memory force is neglected. Section IV is intended to
study, by performing numerical simulations, the effect of
the Boussinesq-Basset memory force (and the same external flows as in Sec. III) on the dispersion of droplets.
Discussions and conclusions are offered in Sec. V.

PHYSICAL MODEL

Let us analyze the motion of noninteracting spherical
droplets of mass m, radius a, in an environment with air

density ρa and air viscosity µa , under gravity g, and subject to an external flow of the form u (r, t), with a characteristic speed Umax , where r(t) = (x, y, z) is the droplet’s
position, here t represents time. In this study we will be
considering three flows namely shear, Pouiseuille, and
unsteady shear flow. Droplets immersed in these profiles
will have a characteristic speed v(t) which decreases as
the droplets fall due to gravity. With the latter physical quantities a Reynolds number (Re) can be defined
as Re = ρa (Umax − v)a/µa which satisfies Re < 1.
Therefore, these droplets individual dynamics described
by their translational velocity, v(t) = (vx , vy , vz ), follows
the Maxey-Riley equation15

The forces on the right hand side of Eq. (1) are respectively, the droplet’s weight; bouyancy force; forces in
the undisturbed flow due to local pressure gradients; the
added or virtual mass force; Stokes drag force; and the
last two terms represent the Boussinesq-Basset memory
force. To find the order-of-magnitude of each term in the
Maxey-Riley Eq. (1), one can introduce the following
dimensionless quantities r = r/a, v = v/U, t = (U/a) t,
where the characteristic speed is defined as U = mg/RT ,
which is the terminal velocity of a falling droplet. After

The latter result belongs to the so-called overdamped
approximation, where inertia does not play a role, and
particles immediately reach the external flow speed. Alternatively,
by keeping inertia and neglecting terms of
√
order Re and higher, the Maxey-Riley equation can be
rewritten as

= −g (k + vT ) .

(8)

This equation allows us to observe the dynamics of
droplets at short times.
where the Reynolds number Re = ρa U a/µa has been
introduced, as well as the ratio λ = ma /m = ρa /ρ =
1.225 × 10−3 . Here g = ga/U 2 .

Let us start analyzing the order of magnitude estimate
of the terms in Eq. (1) based on typical droplets ejected
after talking. According to recent studies4,10,16 , the radius of those droplets range between 5µm to 100µm,
hence Table I shows their respective Reynolds number
and the order-of-magnitude involved in Eq. (5). From
this table and for droplets of radius a ∈ [5µm, 20µm],
the limit Re → 0 can be applied to the M-R Eq. (5) to
finally get
(6)

which implies that the dynamics of droplets of this size
is
v x = 0; v y = uy , v z = −1.

Shear and Poiseuille flows as external wind

Let us solve Eq. (8) under the presence of shear and
Poiseuille flows modeling the effect of wind on the spherical droplets. These profiles are given by

A more realistic situation, is to consider the fact that
air flows for a while, and then stops, and then flows again.
The simplest model is to assume a time-dependent shear
flow scenario. This unsteady vector flow field u(r, t)
should satisfy the time-dependent Navier-Stokes equations, which after assuming u(r, t) = (0, uy (z, t) , 0), incompressibility, and a null pressure, reduce to

Once Eq. (12), Eq. (13), and Eq. (21) are available, we
can now exemplify a typical droplets’ dispersion (cloud)
after a person talks and generates micrometric droplets
(radius between 5 µm to 100 µm4,10 ), which are subject to either a shear flow (Fig. 3(a)), a Pouiseuille flow
(Fig. 3(b)), or an unsteady shear flow (Fig. 3(c)). We
simulate the situation of a normal and a strong talk by
imposing an exit speed of droplets (from a cone shape of
velocities representing a person’s mouth) of v0 = 1m/s
and v0 = 5m/s, respectively. The cloud is made of
1000 droplets of random size between 5 µm to 100 µm.
Additionally, we impose a moderate (Umax = 5m/s)
and a calm (Umax = 1m/s) wind scenario. The cone
shape as the initial velocity distribution, and as observed from experiments10 , is implemented by imposing
v(0) = (v0 cos ϕ0 sin θ0 , v0 sin ϕ0 sin θ0 , v0 cos θ0 ), whose
angular polar and azimuthal initial extremum are set to
θ0max = 110o , θ0min = 81o , ϕmax
= 110o , and ϕmin
=
0
0

81o . The case of a Poiseuille flow profile considers for a
calm flow {Umax , U0 } = {1m/s, −0.4m−1 s−1 } wheread
for a moderate flow {Umax , U0 } = {5m/s, −2m−1 s−1 }:
The simulations for the unsteady flow profile consider
ω = 0.5s−1 . Finally, (ϕ, θ) will randomly vary between
their extremum. The results can be visualized in Fig. 3
which shows the distribution of droplets at three different
times namely, t = 0.08s, t = 0.4s, and t = 1.33s. A color
code indicating the droplets’ sizes is also introduced. The
safe distancing is indicated as a vertical dotted-black line.
Clearly, droplets move beyond the safe distancing. As it
can be seen, droplets under a moderate wind and after only 1.33s, are already 6m away from the person’s
mouth. Droplets under a calm wind and less than 50µm
in radius will overpass the safe distancing in the next second. These results indicate a potential danger for people in a public space since the safe distancing has been
easily surpassed. We finally take Eq. (12), Eq. (13),
and Eq. (21) to find the maximum travelled distance
(yM ) along the y−direction as a function of droplets’ size,
as well as a function of different external flows namely,
shear, Poiseuille, and unsteady shear flow. The results
are shown in Fig. Figs. 3(a)-(c). Figures 3(a)-(c) show
that droplets under a Pouiseuille profile reached the the
longest distance compared to the other analyzed profiles.
This figure also indicates that for Umax = 5m/s, droplets

IV. DYNAMICS WITH BOUSSINESQ-BASSET
MEMORY

In the literature, the Boussinesq-Basset (B-B) memory force has been less frequently considered, probably
because of its order-of-magnitude and because of the required computational effort. However, there exist some
theoretical15,17–21 , numerical22–25 and experimental26,27
works dealing with this force. In this section we analyze
the effect of the memory force term on the dispersion an
flying time of spherical droplets.
Consider first small droplets ranging between a ∈
[5µm, 20µm]. According to Table I, their motion can
be modeled by the M-R equation under the overdamped
√
approximation. However, by keeping terms of order Re
to see the effect of the B-B memory force, Eq. (5) reads

of radius 5µm, and under a Poiseuille flow, can travel until 2000m, while around 1500m under a shear flow. As
expected, the condition of having a wind blowing and
ceasing (unsteady flow) reduces the droplets maximum
dispersion to around 750m for Umax = 5m/s. On the
other hand, our results to leading order indicate that the
maximum travelled distance for small droplets (5µm radius) under a shear/Poiseuille external flow with a maximum speed of Umax = 1m/s may easily reach more than
250 meters. The long distance achieved by these small
droplets is because they remain in the air for around 600
seconds, see Figs. 3(d)-(e). In these figures, the flying
time obtained from Eq. (12), is shown as a solid-black
line; while the red circles represent the approximated
equation tF ≈ 9µa h/2ρga2 . These figures also indicate
that the largest (100µm radius) droplets can only stay in
the air for about 1.5s. It is worth mentioning that all the
studied droplets (a ∈ [5µm, 100µm]) reached a constant
vertical terminal velocity U ≈ mg/RT .

A similar expression as Eq. (24) is obtained for the other
spatial components. In the case of larger droplets and
from Table I, one notices that the order-of-magnitude of
all terms in Eq. (5) is the same. Therefore, one has to
solve for the full M-R Eq. (5). Using the Euler method
together with Eq. (23), one can show that the discretized
z−component of Eq. (5) in dimensional variables reads

where constants R, b0 , b1 , b2 , b3 are defined in Appendix
X. The discretization of the other components in Eq. (5)
is similar to Eq. (25). After posing Eq. (24) and Eq.(25),
we are ready to find the droplets’ dynamics under higher
order terms.
Because of the external flows we have chosen and from
the simulations in Sec. III, we observe that the dynamics mostly occurs along the z − y plane, and that initial
conditions are not relevant for long times (at least for
vT (0) = 0); thus from now on, a 2D problem with initial
conditions vz (0) = 0 and vy (0) = Umax , will be considered. Equations (5) and (22) are then numerically solved
using the discretized scheme in Eq. (24) and Eq. (25),
under the presence of a shear flow (the other flows basically share the same features), and for two typical exit
initial speeds while talking4,10 namely, 1m/s and 5m/s.
The time-step used for solving Eq. (5) and Eq. (22)
was 4 × 10−4 s and 5 × 10−3 s, respectively. The results
of the simulations are shown in Figs. 4(a)-(c). In those
figures, ∆y = yM B − yM , where yM B is the maximum
travelled distance along the y-direction by droplets of size

a ≤ 20µm and obtained from Eq. (22). For droplets of
size a > 20µm, yM B represents the maximum travelled
distance along the y-direction obtained after solving the
full M-R equation (5); whereas yM represents the solution
directly obtained from Eqs. (12) and (13). One can observe that for a low wind speed, the effect of higher order
terms barely enhance the droplets’ dispersion. However,
for a wind speed of 5m/s and for the smallest considered
droplet, higher order terms can increase its dispersion
around 2 m. Figures 4(a)-(c) also indicate that as the
size of the droplets increases, higher order terms effects
become smaller until they finally disappear.

The effect of first order terms and the full terms in the
M-R equation, on the flying time of spherical droplets
as a function of the radius a is also analyzed. Using
Eq. (12), the numerical solutions from Eq. (24) and Eq.
(25), and defining ∆tF = tF B − tF ; where for a ≤ 20µm,
tF B represents the flying time of a droplet calculated
using first order terms (Eq. (22)). For a > 20µm, tF B
represents the flying time calculated using the full terms
in the M-R equation. On the other hand, tF is the flying
time directly obtained from Eqs. (12). This analysis is
shown in Fig. 3(d). It can be seen that ∆tF increases as
the droplets’ sizes decrease. In fact, for a = 5µm there is
a 0.8s flying time difference between the dynamics of Eq.
(5) and Eq. (8). This extra time also contributes to the
observed enhancement of dispersion of small droplets. A
numerical analysis on the convergence of ∆y = yM B −
yM , as the time-step ∆t in the simulations decreases, is
also performed. Fig. 4(f) shows this convergence for
a droplet of radius 30µm after discretizing the full MR equation (5). As expected, a linear convergence can
be appreciated. The convergence for a droplet of radius
19µm and after using the overdamped M-R equation (22)
is shown in Fig. 3(b). Once again a linear convergence
is achieved. Therefore, the latter analysis validates our
employed first order numerical algorithm.

Finally, the implications of the Boussinesq-Basset
memory force term on the sedimentation velocity component vz (t) with vz (0) = 0 is also studied. The numerical
results are shown in Fig. 5, which illustrates the dynamics of vz (t) + U versus time in a log-log plot, and for
two different spherical droplets reaching their terminal
velocity U . The black-solid lines belong to an exponential decay of vz (t) towards U ; whereas the red-dashed
lines indicate a t−1/2 decay. It can be observed that for
short times, vz (t) exponentially decays towards U ; however, vz (t) decays according to the scaling t−1/2 for long
times. This is a rather surprising result, since the orderof-magnitude of the B-B term is really small. This t−1/2
decay of the sedimenting velocity has been also recently
reported17 . Further consequences of the B-B term on
the motion of particles at low Reynolds numbers may be
search for in future investigations.

DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS

According to Dbouk and Drikakis11 and others, evaporation and relative humidity play a role on droplets’
dispersion. Those factors may reduce or increase the size
of droplets and their cloud shape as it travels. Therefore,
our results could be improved to account for a rocket-like
dynamics (drops varying mass). Following Dbouk and
Drikakis11 , who considered a conjugated flow-heat-mass
transfer problem and CFD dynamics, it can be conclued
that evaporation of droplets takes place at high relative
humidities, and high temperatures. Thus for the case
of countries with an annual average of relative humidity,
RH = 50%, a wind speed of 4km/h = 1.1m/s, a temperature less than 30C o , and five seconds later since a cloud
of droplets originated, there will be a null evaporation11 .
Other works also supporting a long time survival of infected droplets is Stadnytskyi et al.28
Based on this information, Fig. 6(a) shows four
droplets’ distributions (cloud) five seconds later since the
cloud originated under a shear (S) or an unsteady shear
(U N S) flow with {Umax , v0 } = {1m/s, 5m/s}. The
other numerical parameters employed and the initial velocity distribution of droplets are the same as in Fig.
2. This figure indicates that droplets with a > 75µm
have already reached the floor, and that droplets of size
50µm < a < 75µm are about to reach the floor. How-

8
ever, the smallest droplets under a calm wind (1m/s) for
both U N S and S, have surpassed the social distancing
(vertical black-dashed lines). The same droplets under
a moderate wind (5m/s) for both U N S and S, reached
15m and 25m, respectively. Thus from this figure, one
can explicitly visualize a more real scale to which people may be in risk of contagion. Fig. 6(b) compares the
position of droplets’ distribution (cloud) under an uniform flow ({h, Umax , v0 } = {h = 1.7m, 1.1m/s, 1m/s}),
either using single particle dynamics (this work) or employing a more elaborated CFD analysis11 . Both methods result in a similar cloud’s position. Finally, using
the latter parameters, the droplets’ distribution at t =
{1s, 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s} and some paths followed by droplets
of different sizes are shown in Fig.6(c). These paths have
a linear behavior since the cloud dynamics is practically
overdamped, implying y(t) ≈ Umax t and z(t) ≈ h − U t,
thus particles will follow the function z ≈ h−(U/Umax )y.
In summary, using single particle dynamics, which has
the advantage of requiring a minimum computational
cost, this paper provided an estimate of the maximum
dispersion of micrometric droplets generated after talking. Briefly, under conditions of a null evaporation and
only five seconds later since droplets were originated, it
was found that an unsteady shear calm wind (1m/s) can
disperse droplets beyond the social distancing, and until
more than 15m when droplets are subject to a moderate
unsteady shear flow (5m/s). As expected, an unsteady
shear profile is less efficient to disperse droplets than a
constant Poiseuille or shear profile. These constants profiles modeling a calm wind (1m/s) were found to provide a maximum dispersion beyond 250m for the smallest
droples (5µm). The effect of the Boussinesq–Basset force
term was also analyzed. Although its order-of magnitude
is small, it was found to be enough to change the behavior of the sedimentation velocity (from exponentially
decaying towards its terminal velocity, to proportionally
decaying as t−1/2 ) of a micrometric particle and slightly
increase droplets’ dispersion and their flying time.
Future research would be to consider external flows in
the presence of buildings and to find the complex streamlines generated and their effects on droplets’ distribution.
It may be inferred for example that the presence of a
corner on a common street, could generate stagnation
points, that may risk areas of infection, since those points
could storage for a while infected droplets. Furthermore,
walls may induce three-dimensional flows that may drag
particles away from the floor, thus increasing its flying
time and hence their capability of traveling longer. We
hope this study helps people to be more aware about the
effect of daily wind currents on the propagation of potentially infected droplets. Based on our findings of droplets
easily dispersing beyond the social distancing when subject to wind currents, we recommend the use of masks8
able to contain the virus, as well as flex seal googles,
since droplets dragged by wind may reach eyes. We also
recommend to wash all your wearing clothes and shoes,
and to shower after being out from home, since infected

droplets may be attached to clothes or hair14 . Direct exposure to wind currents, mainly in crowded cities, should
also be avoided.
