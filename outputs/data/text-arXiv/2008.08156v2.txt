shelter-in-place have significant impact on the economy [4],
as up to the time of writing this paper no vaccine or other
contagion control method has been developed. Essential
workers often have higher risks of exposure to the virus
because of the lack of options of working from home.
As city dwellers mainly rely on public transportation,
and more notably the subway, to move around, it is expected
that a highly contagious virus such as SARS-CoV-2 would
easily spread through the fabric of NYC population. It
is expected that a crowded NYC subway, as an enclosed
environment and a major indicator of people’s mobility,
would be directly correlated with spreading of SARS-CoV2.
While the NYC subway was expected to be a major
vehicle for the transmission of COVID-19 in NYC in early
2020 [5], the correlation between the subway ridership and
COVID-19 prevalence and deaths has not been presented
until now. In this paper, we show this correlation on the
public turnstile usage data of NYC subway provided by the
NYC Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) [6] and
the statistics of the confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths
provided by the NYC Department of Health (DOH) [7].
There is a large number of prediction models for the
COVID-19 pandemic [8]–[24]. Much of the literature focuses on modeling the prevalence of COVID-19 in different
countries and partially enclosed environments, such as cruise
ships [8], [11]–[16]. These models use local and regional
data to examine the correlation of COVID-19 cases with
environmental or social factors. Some models forecast the
number of COVID-19 cases according to the population size
[18], [22], [25]. Other models estimate the impact of the use
of public transit and others study the contagion by airborne
transmission [9], [10].
Our analysis leverages on the reported number of deaths
for an accurate correlation because the reported number of
cases are known to have large errors caused by the lack of

Abstract—In this paper, we show a strong correlation between
turnstile usage data of the New York City subway provided
by the Metropolitan Transport Authority of New York City
and COVID-19 deaths and cases reported by the New York
City Department of Health. The turnstile usage data not only
indicate the usage of the city’s subway but also people’s
activity that promoted the large prevalence of COVID-19 city
dwellers experienced from March to May of 2020. While this
correlation is apparent, no proof has been provided before.
Here we demonstrate this correlation through the application
of a long short-term memory neural network. We show that
the correlation of COVID-19 prevalence and deaths considers
the incubation and symptomatic phases on reported deaths.
Having established this correlation, we estimate the dates when
the number of COVID-19 deaths and cases would approach
zero after the reported number of deaths were decreasing by
using the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average model.
We also estimate the dates when the first cases and deaths
occurred by back-tracing the data sets and compare them to
the reported dates.

1. Introduction
New York City (NYC) has been the locus of a major
prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused
by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2), in early 2020 [1]. Many people have been hospitalized and also many have lost their lives to this disease.
It is not clear when the first cases occurred in the city
but the numbers of cases and deaths in the city peaked in
mid April 2020 [2]. This pandemic has also brought and
continues to bring economical hardship to city dwellers and
people worldwide, especially those in the lowest economical
strata [3]. Measures taken to contain the spreading of SARSCoV-2 including social distancing, business shut-downs, and

testing and possible asymptomatic cases.
In this analysis, we employ long short-term memory
(LSTM) neural network for analyzing time series data to: 1)
show the correlation between NYC subway turnstile (entry)
data and COVID-19 deaths and cases, and Auto-Regressive
Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) to both 2) predict
the dates when COVID-19 deaths would approach zero,
according to the reported data, and 3) estimate the time
when the contagion started in NYC by identifying the dates
when the first cases and the first deaths occurred through
analysis of the provided data. We compare the estimated
dates with the reported dates.
The analysis performed in this paper uses exclusively
the mentioned public datasets, and other factors that are not
included in the analyzed dataset may have affected the actual
counts of cases and deaths. For example, the data analyzed
in this paper was recorded while no face coverings were
widely considered.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 describes the models used in this paper for data
analysis. Section 3 describes the obtained results. Section
4 provides a discussion and remaining questions. Section 5
presents our conclusions.

and LSTM. Linear regression is a statistical method for
finding the relationship between a dependent variable and
independent variables or features [26]. In this paper, we use
a linear regression model with L1 regularization to find the
precedence of features. We adopt multiple linear regression
with xj independent variables. The estimated value ŷ in the
linear regression model follows:
X
ŷ = β0 +
βj x j + ε
(1)
j

where βj represents the model weights or regression coefficients and ε is the residuals error. L1 regularization is
equal to the absolute sum of the model weights multiplied
byPa shrinkage value (λ). L1 regularization is formulated as
λ |βj | and the regression model goal is to minimize:

where yi is the actual data point and xij is the value of the
independent variables for each data point.
LSTM is a recurrent neural network (RNN) model [27]
capable of learning both recent sequences of inputs and
historical data. LSTM is mainly used to model time-series
data to learn the time evolution of sequences of data [28].
We use a SavitzkyGolay filter to smooth out the prediction
results from LSTM [29].
The ARIMA model is used to forecast the time-series
data [30]. ARIMA consists of three models: auto-regressive
(AR), integration, and moving average (MA). It uses three
hyper parameters: p, d, and q , where p is the order of autoregressive model, d is the degree of difference, and q is the
order of moving average [30]. The ARIMA(p, d, q ) equation
is defined as

2. Model Description
In this section, we present the data sources and analysis
tools used in this paper.

2.1. Datasets
The NYC DOH dataset reports the first COVID-19 case
on February 29, 2020 and the first death on March 11, 2020.
The MTA turnstile usage data [6] includes the number of
subway entries and exits per station in NYC, recorded hourly
each day. The total number of stations in the dataset is
379. We calculate the average daily entries of NYC subway
stations per day for our analysis. We also use the number of
daily cases and deaths of the COVID-19 dataset published
by the NYC DOH [7].
We consider that there is an incubation and symptomatic
period for people who lost their lives to COVID-19. We
consider those periods as features to analyze the correlation
of the studied data. We call these feature day-shifted subway
entries. Shifted here means subway entries from days prior
to the reported death’s date. This is, for a given day t0 , the
turnstile usage is denoted as xt0 and the turnstile entry of m
days before t0 is denoted as xt0 −m . We use xt0 and xt0 −m
as features to predict the number of deaths and cases for
day t0 , where 1 ≤ m ≤ 25. We use 20% of the NYC DOH
data as test data for validation and the rest for training in
our analysis.

where α is the coefficient of discrete time linear equation
of AR, L is a time lag operator defined as LXt = Xt−1 ,
Xt is the observed value at time t, β is the coefficient for
the noise term, ε, in MA [31].

3. Results of Data Analysis
3.1. Performance Metrics
The performance of the prediction models is evaluated
using R2 score, mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean
square error (RMSE). Coefficient of determination or R2
score is the proportion of variation explained by independent
variables [26]. R2 score is calculated as
R2 = 1 −

where SSR is the residual sum of squares and
PSST is the

To analyze the turnstile usage data and its correlation

actual value and ȳ is the mean of actual values. R2 shows the
variance of residuals (or prediction errors) in the predicted
data points divided by the variance of data points from the
average of all data points. R2 represents the performance of
a model as compared to randomly guessed predictions that
are equal to the average of all data. The closer R2 is to 1,
the predictions are closer to the actual values.
MAE is defined as the average of sum of residuals, or
n

where n is the number of observations. When MAE is close
to 0, the model has a high accuracy in predicting data
points. We use MAE to measure the training and validation
losses of LSTM. If training loss is significantly lower than
validation loss, the model is overfitting the training data,
which means the model is learning complex patterns of
training data that may not generalize in predicting unseen
test data and it results in poor performance. If validation
loss is significantly lower than training loss, the model is
underfitting the training data, which means that the model
is unable to learn important patterns of the training data, and
it results in poor performance of the model. As the training
progresses if the losses grow apart, then we should stop

In other words, RMSE is the standard deviation of residuals.
With normally distributed data points, one can expect 68%
of predicted points to be with one RMSE from the mean and
95% to be within two RMSE from the mean of the actual
data.
Figure 1 shows the average number of subway station
entries and the reported number of COVID-19 deaths and
cases each day starting from March 1, 2020 to May 15,
2020. The figure shows that the number of deaths peaked
on April 7, 2020 before it started to decline. The number
of cases peaked on April 6, 2020. The trend of the deaths
curve trails the cases curve with a few days delay between
March 15, 2020 to April 15, 2020.
To find the correlation between NYC subway turnstile
entries data and the number of reported COVID-19 deaths,
we start from present day’s turnstile usage data and then
move it backwards m days and use the historical data from
the previous days to find the correlation between the number
of COVID-19 deaths and subway entries. Figure 2 shows the
calculated R2 score in each test.

3.2. Correlation between NYC Subway Usage and
the Number of COVID-19 Deaths

The x-axis represents the independent variables of each
test. For example, 1 shifted day (one day prior) in this figure
shows the R2 score obtained by the linear regression model
for the turnstile usage of a single day and one day prior as a
feature and the corresponding number of deaths reported on
that day. The y -axis shows the R2 score of the regression
model between COVID-19 deaths on day t0 and the subway
entries on days t0 and t0 − m. We calculated R2 score for
0 ≤ m ≤ 25, where we use the turnstile usage of prior 25
days.
From the R2 scores shown in Figure 2, we looked into
those shifted days with high R2 scores as candidates for
features. We tested different combinations and the ones that
produced the lowest MAE were selected. These selections
are shown in Table 1.
Feature set A consists of subway entries of the current
day and 14 days prior (i.e., with one shifted-day data; that
with the largest R2 ). Feature set B consists of subway
entries of the current day, 13, and 14 days prior (i.e.,
feature with two shifted-day data). Feature set C consists
of subway entries of current day, 10, 12, 13, 14, and 17
days prior (i.e., feature with five shifted-day data, those
with the highest R2 s). Feature set D adds two new features
to Feature set C: the difference between subway entries of
prior 8 and 13 days and that of prior 13 and 18 days (i.e.,
feature with two shifted days and difference from Friday to
Monday for a weekly difference). We added these two new
features with the speculation that changes in average subway
ridership from Friday to Monday may also be indicators of
trends. Feature set E includes shifted days with high R2
but also shorter shifted days that have large R2 (i.e., short
and average incubation/symptomatic periods). Feature set F
includes the combinations of the current date and prior-day
data of up to 25 days (i.e., it includes all considered incubation/symptomatic periods in this paper that once they are
added are 1 to 25 days). This set is selected for completeness
and as a reference.

We applied the feature sets described in Table 1 to
LSTM to predict the number of deaths and cases. We
compared the predicted number of deaths and cases using
different features with the actual reported data. Figures 3(a)
and 3(b) show the MAE and the prediction of the number
of deaths, respectively, of the LSTM model with Feature set
A. The R2 score for Feature set A is 0.36 and the RMSE
is 78.06. Figures 3(c) and 3(d) show the results for Feature
set F. These results show that Feature set F produces the
most accurate prediction with an R2 score of 0.96 and an
RMSE of 25.66. These two features show the best and worst
performance of the predictions, as shown in Table 2. This
table summarizes the R2 scores and the RMSEs for Feature
sets A - F for deaths and cases.
We also used Feature sets A-F to predict the number
of cases. Figure 4(a) shows the MAE and training and
validation losses for feature set A. Here, the validation loss
is slightly higher than the training loss. But both losses
become steady after 100 epochs. The LSTM predictions
on Feature set A (Figure 4(b)) follow the trend of the actual
data. However, the predicted cases are less accurate than the
predicted deaths because the reported cases are not accurate
enough as compared to the reported deaths. The R2 score on
test data is 0.49 and the RMSE for all predicted data points
is 851.85, which explains the observed discrepancies. Figure
4(c) shows the training and validation losses of LSTM
predicting number of cases by using Feature set F. Here,
both losses are lower than those with Feature set A, which
shows the high performance of LSTM in predicting cases.
Additionally, the LSTM prediction in Figure 4(d) follows the
actual data closely. Table 2 also summarizes the R2 scores
and RMSE for each feature set. We observe a higher R2
score does not necessarily lead to a more accurate prediction
results as indicated in the cases prediction. The RMSEs for
the case predictions are much higher than that of the deaths
predictions. This further confirms the lack of accuracy in
the reported cases.

We use ARIMA analysis on the number of deaths to
find the estimated date that the number of deaths in NYC
reached zero. Figure 5(a) shows that on May 16, 2020, the
lower band of 95% confidence interval of forecasts reaches
zero. However, the upper bound does not cross zero value.
That trend seems to indicate that the number of deaths could
also grow again.
Figure 5(c) shows the ARIMA forecast of the progression of the number of COVID-19 cases in NYC after May
15, 2020. The forecast follows the decreasing trend of the
number of cases. The red arrow here shows the date that
the upper band of 95% confidence interval crosses zero.
To find origin date of the first case in NYC, we used
ARIMA to forecast the trend of COVID-19 cases in reverse

4. Discussion

chronological order, as Figure 5(d) shows. The lower and
upper band of 95% confidence interval of ARIMA forecast
shows that the first case of COVID-19 in NYC may have
occurred between January 28, 2020 and February 24.

The reporting of cases has been affected by the deployment and execution of testing for SARS-CoV-2. The
effective and widespread testing offers better identification
of the cases and their locations. But because of the limitation
of testing capabilities at the beginning of the pandemic, the
reported COVID-19 cases may not be accurate enough for
modeling and thus resulting in larger errors. Therefore, the
reported deaths data have been used to forecast and estimate

Table 3 shows the first reported COVID-19 cases (Feb.
29, 2020) and deaths (Mar. 11, 2020) in NYC DOH dataset.

the correlation between subway usage and the reported
numbers of cases and deaths in this paper.
The estimations performed with ARIMA are based on
the provided data with no additional information. The discrepancies on the estimated dates and the reported dates are
the product of the model using solely past data.
Public health suggestions on the use of face covering
and social distancing are not considered in the models to
reflect the multi-variant effects in linear regression. The use
of face covering at some point can lead to different results.
Comparisons of NYC data with those of other cities that
experienced an early face-covering measure is of interest for

Figure 5. ARIMA forecast of (a) the number of COVID-19 deaths. The 95% confidence interval of forecast after May 15, 2020 indicates that the number
of deaths may increase or decrease. The lower bound of confidence interval marks May 16, 2020 as the day with zero deaths; (b) the number of deaths
backward in time to find the possible first death. The upper bound of 95% confidence interval of forecasts indicates Mar. 07, 2020 as the first possible
death-case date; (c) the number of deaths backtracking in time to find the possible first death. The upper bound of 95% confidence interval of forecasts
indicates Mar. 07, 2020 as the first possible death-case date; (d) the number of cases in reverse chronological order to find the approximate dates of the
occurrence of cases. The first case is projected to have occurred between January 28, 2020 and February 24, 2020.

forecasting future prevalence or containment of the spread
of this virus.

5. Conclusions
We have shown the discrepancy of the estimated and
reported dates in such scenarios and showed that some of
these dates are close. In these models, we considered that
the recorded number of cases may have large errors as
testing for COVID-19 was not widely available nor easy to
apply at the beginning and the peak of the pandemic in the
first half of 2020.

We used data on the NYC subway turnstile usage published by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority of New
York City during the heavy prevalence of COVID-19 in the
city and the data of confirmed cases and deaths reported by
NYC Department of Health to investigate their correlation.
Here, we show that by considering different incubationsymptomatic periods for subway users after traveling by
subway as features, there is a strong correlation between
the reported number of COVID-19 deaths and the number of
NYC subway passengers through long short-term memory
analysis for the first time. We have also shown that the
ARIMA model can predict the dates when the numbers
of deaths and cases are reduced to zero and estimate the
