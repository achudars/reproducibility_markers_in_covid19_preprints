The seemingly simple process of inhalation relies on a complex interplay between muscular contraction in the thorax, elasto-capillary interactions in individual lung branches, propagation of air
between different connected branches, and overall air flow into the lungs. These processes occur
over considerably different length and time scales; consequently, linking them to the biomechanical
properties of the lungs, and quantifying how they together control the spatiotemporal features of
inhalation, remains a challenge. We address this challenge by developing a computational model of
the lungs as a hierarchical, branched network of connected liquid-lined flexible cylinders coupled to a
viscoelastic thoracic cavity. Each branch opens at a rate and a pressure that is determined by input
biomechanical parameters, enabling us to test the influence of changes in the mechanical properties
of lung tissues and secretions on inhalation dynamics. By summing the dynamics of all the branches,
we quantify the evolution of overall lung pressure and volume during inhalation, reproducing the
shape of measured breathing curves. Using this model, we demonstrate how changes in lung muscle
contraction, mucus viscosity and surface tension, and airway wall stiffness—characteristic of many
respiratory diseases, including those arising from COVID-19, cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, asthma, and emphysema—drastically alter inhaled lung capacity and breathing
duration. Our work therefore helps to identify the key factors that control breathing dynamics, and
provides a way to quantify how disease-induced changes in these factors lead to respiratory distress.

INTRODUCTION

The ongoing COVID-19 crisis highlights the critical importance of lung biomechanics in our everyday
lives: COVID-19 patients frequently develop shortness
of breath and often, debilitating and possibly fatal respiratory failure [1–5]. These complications are thought to
arise in part from virus-induced alterations in the biomechanical properties of the lungs—specifically, an increase
in the surface tension of the airway mucus lining and a
decrease in the strength of the thoracic muscles [6, 7].
Such complications also manifest in diverse other disorders arising from cystic fibrosis (CF), chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and emphysema;
these are again thought to be linked to changes in airway surface tension or muscular contraction, as well as
to other alterations in the mechanics of airway tissues
and secretions such as an increase in mucus viscosity and
a decrease in airway wall stiffness [8–11]. As a result,
treatments frequently rely on mechanical ventilation and
exogenous administration of surfactant and/or mucusthinning agents [4, 12–23]. However, these interventions
often proceed by trial-and-error due to a limited understanding of how biomechanical factors impact the overall
dynamics of breathing.
While experiments provide a wealth of information
quantifying muscle strength, mucus surface tension and
viscosity, and lung airway wall stiffness, directly connecting alterations in these tissue-scale biomechanical factors
to organ-scale alterations in breathing is challenging. In
particular, measurements of tissue properties can be invasive and often do not provide a way to assess the largerscale impact of variations in these factors, while measure-

ments of overall breathing dynamics are non-invasive but
do not shed light on the underlying biomechanical factors
at play. Computational models provide a promising way
to overcome these limitations. For example, computational fluid dynamics approaches are capable of resolving
air pressure and flow-induced stresses in the lungs with
exquisite detail [24–37]; however, they are computationally intensive and frequently focus on static lung morphologies for simplicity. Conversely, sophisticated pulmonary mechanics models have been developed to elaborate the competition between capillary, viscous, and elastic stresses in determining how individual lung branches
deform [38–51]; however, these models do not incorporate the complex hierarchical structure of the lungs and
thus cannot reproduce the full dynamics of breathing.
Models that simplify the representation of the different
lung branches as an interconnected network provide a
promising way to bridge these extremes; however, previous implementations have not treated dynamic changes
in lung structure during breathing or have only been used
to specifically investigate the influence of structural heterogeneity on breathing [52–55]. Thus, an understanding
of how lung biomechanics impacts respiration in general
remains elusive.
Here, we address this problem by developing a dynamic
network model of the lungs that connects the multi-scaled
processes underlying inhalation: contraction of the thoracic muscles, opening of the individual lung branches,
flow of the mucus lining, propagation of air between different connected branches, and overall air flow into the
lungs. We hypothesize that the network representation
of these processes resolves the relevant length and time
scales, while still providing a simplified and computation-

ally tractable representation of the interconnected and
hierarchical geometry of the lungs. In support of this hypothesis, we show that our model can describe the evolution of overall lung pressure and volume, as well as the
hierarchical and heterogeneous opening of different lung
branches, during inhalation starting from a completely
closed respiratory zone as a proof of principle. We use
the model to demonstrate how disease-induced weakening of the thoracic muscles, increased mucus viscosity and
surface tension, and alterations in lung airway wall elasticity impact inhalation. Thus, our results help elucidate
how lung biomechanics control breathing dynamics.

THEORY OF INHALATION DYNAMICS
Lung network representation

Motivated by morphological data, we computationally represent the lungs as a binary branched network
of thin-walled, liquid-lined flexible cylinders coupled to
a viscoelastic thoracic cavity (Figure 1). This tree can
be classified into two sections leading from the trachea
[57, 58], indexed by the generation number i: the con-

ducting zone (0 ≤ i ≤ 16), which has a constant open
volume and does not contribute to oxygen uptake into
the bloodstream, and the respiratory zone (17 ≤ i ≤ 23),
which has branches that can collapse and open during
respiration, and is the primary site of oxygen uptake.
We therefore represent the conducting zone as one static
airway branch, and the respiratory zone as a binary tree
spanning generations 17 through 23. We index each individual branch by the labels i and j, where 17 ≤ i ≤ 23
denotes the generation number and 1 ≤ j ≤ 2i corresponds to the index of the branch within a given generation i. The branches are all connected; thus, branches
deeper in the lungs are only able to open when branches
above them have opened.
Each branch is characterized by an open inner radius
Rij , length Lij , and wall thickness Tij , and therefore an
2
open airway volume Vij = πRij
Lij (Fig. 1b, right inset). For each generation, the mean values of these morP2i
phological parameters Ri ≡ hRij ij = j=1 Rij /2i , Li ≡
P2i
P2i
hLij ij = j=1 Lij /2i , and Ti ≡ hTij ij = j=1 Tij /2i are
given by experimental measurements of the mean branch
radius, length, and thickness, respectively (Table I). To
incorporate heterogeneity, a natural feature of the lungs,
we then randomly select the individual Rij , Lij , and Tij

3
from a uniform distribution bounded by ± 25 % of Ri , Li ,
and Ti , respectively. The results shown in Figs. 2–7 all
utilize the same lung architecture parameterized by the
same values of {Rij , Lij , Tij }, to isolate the influence of
biomechanical factors on breathing. However, an advantage of our network representation is that it is generalizable: specific values of the morphological parameters can
be incorporated in future extensions of this work. For
example, our model could be used to assess the distributions of outcomes across different airways with different
{Ri , Li , Ti }, or between different realizations of the same
airways having the same {Ri , Li , Ti }, given the importance of structural heterogeneity on breathing [55].
Further, to incorporate the biomechanical properties
of lung tissues, we make the simplifying assumption that
the inner walls of the branches are uniformly coated by
a Newtonian fluid of negligible thickness with dynamic
shear viscosity µ and surface tension γ, and the lung airway wall is a linear elastic solid with Young’s modulus E;
we use values of µ, γ, and E obtained from experimental
measurements, as listed in Table II, and take them to be
constant throughout the lungs. This model therefore represents a key first step toward computationally describing the lungs, which in reality have non-Newtonian mucus
with a non-negligible, generation-dependent thickness, as
well as generation-dependent values of the parameters µ,
γ, and E. However, our network representation enables
specific branch-dependent values of these biomechanical
parameters to be incorporated, which would be another
useful direction for future work.

Stress exerted by thoracic muscles

As a first step toward modeling the full dynamics
of respiration, here we consider the process of inhalation starting from a completely closed respiratory zone—
characteristic of newborn infants or patients with severe
respiratory distress [74]. We therefore initialize the model
with all branches with 17 ≤ i ≤ 23 closed. Building
on this model to explore the additional dynamics of exhalation as well as multiple breathing cycles will be an
important direction for future research.
Inhalation begins with the contraction of the thoracic
muscles that, as a first approximation, we assume pull
with a constant stress σ0 on the intrapleural cavity. Motivated by previous work [61, 75], we model the viscoelastic
behavior of the chest using a Kelvin-Voigt model, which
treats the chest as a combination of an elastic spring and
a viscous dashpot connected in parallel (Fig. 1b, bottom): σ(t) ≡ σ0 = Kip ε(t) + µip ε̇(t), where Kip and
µip are the effective elastic and viscous constants characterizing the intrapleural cavity and ε ≡ ∆Vip (t)/Vip,0
represents the volumetric strain in the intrapleural cavity, where ∆Vip represents the difference in the cavity
volume compared to its initial value Vip,0 . Thus, the in-

trapleural space expands over time in a stress-dependent
manner:


(1)
ε(t) = εmax 1 − e−t/τB
where εmax ≡ σ0 /Kip is the maximal strain and τB ≡
µip /Kip is the characteristic time scale of inhalation.
Based on previous measurements [60, 61], we take Kip =
100 kPa and τB = 1 s.
Elasto-capillary interactions in individual branches

The expansion of the thoracic cavity reduces the intrapleural pressure pip (Fig. 1, right): given a fixed
amount of air within the intrapleural space, pip (t) =
pip,0 / [1 + ε(t)], where pip,0 ≈ 99.6 kPa as determined
experimentally [76] and ε(t) is given by Eq. 1. Thus, the
transpulmonary pressure difference across the lung airway wall ptp (t) ≡ pL (t)−pip (t) transiently increases; here
pL (t) is the air pressure in the respiratory zone, which
we take to be constant throughout due to the low air
flow resistance of the respiratory zone, as justified in the
Methods.
As established in many previous studies [55, 77–79],
as ptp increases, it exceeds the threshold pressure pth
ij =
8γ/Rij required to open a collapsed branch ij that is
in contact with the open region of the lungs [38]. In
this case, an air finger propagates into the branch at
a speed Uij that is determined by a complex interplay between viscous forces in the airway mucus lining as the branch is pulled apart, capillary forces holding the walls of the branch together, and elastic forces
resisting bending of the branch walls. Motivated by
the results of previous three-dimensional numerical solutions [38], we estimate this speed using the relation
ptp −pth

Caij = Γ1ij γ/Rijij where Caij ≡ µUij /γ is the capillary number and Γij ≡ (γ/Rij ) /Bij is a dimensionless
parameter that quantifies the competition between capillary and elastic stresses in 
the branch, with bending

3
stiffness Bij ≡ E (Tij /Rij )
12 1 − ν 2 and ν ≈ 0.5
is the Poisson’s ratio of the airway wall. This equation
highlights three key features of branch opening. First,
capillary forces hold the walls of a branch together, and
thus, the transpulmonary pressure ptp must overcome the
capillary pressure threshold pth
ij to force a branch to open.
Second, the elastic energy penalty associated with deforming a branch also promotes opening, as quantified
by Γij . Third, branch opening is not instantaneous, but
is limited by viscous dissipation as the mucus lining is
pushed apart, as quantified by Caij .
We directly implement this relation into our model,
with the condition that a given branch can only open if
its proximal end is in contact with the open region of the
lungs. For ease of computation we treat the branch as

that the biomechanical parameter ζ ≡ (R17 /L17 )/Γ17 is
a key factor that governs the amount of lung opening during inhalation: when ζ is large, elasticity tends to peel
the lung branches open, while when ζ is small, capillarity
tends to hold lung branches shut.
Overall opening of the lungs

The physics described in the previous subsection governs the opening of individual branches; summing over
all open regions of the airways then yields the total opened lung volume V (t) = VC + VR (t) = VC +

j=1 Vij (t), where VC is the constant open volume of the conducting zone and VR is the time-dependent
open volume of the respiratory zone, with Vij given
by Eq. 2. Thus, as ptp increases, the open volume of the respiratory zone VR increases, causing the
lung pressure pL to transiently decrease. This decrease in pressure draws air into the lungs from the

Computational implementation of the model

Analysis of these coupled processes enables us to quantitatively model the full dynamics of inhalation. Specifically, as detailed in the Methods, we input values of the
morphological parameters {Rij , Lij , Tij } and the biomechanical parameters {µ, γ, E, σ0 } and iteratively solve the
equations described in the Theory section at uniform discrete time steps ∆t. This scheme thus enables us to determine the full evolution of the pressures {p̃ip , p̃tp , p̃L },
the volumes {Ṽip , V̂ij , Ṽ } and the flow rate q̃ over time t̃,
where the tilde notation (˜) indicates lung-scale variables
that have been normalized by the atmospheric pressure
p0 , maximal open lung volume V0 , characteristic flow rate
V0 /τB , and breathing time τB respectively. Importantly,
this network representation reduces computational cost:
the complete dynamics of inhalation can be obtained
within a matter of minutes on a conventional personal
computer. For example, the entirety of the results in
Fig. 2 were obtained using a laptop with an 8th Gen
Intel Core i7-8750H 6 core processor with 2.2 GHz and
16GB RAM in 20 minutes. Thus, our network model
provides a computationally tractable way to characterize
the dynamics of respiration that can be implemented by
specialists and general users alike.

RESULTS
Typical inhalation dynamics

We begin by describing the full inhalation dynamics of
a representative healthy lung, using published measurements for the input parameters [56, 60, 61, 63–73]. The
simulation captures the expected dynamics of inhalation.
First, the contraction of the respiratory muscles gener-

ates a stress on the intrapleural cavity, expanding it (Fig.
2a, green) and reducing its internal pressure (Fig. 2a,
blue). The transpulmonary pressure difference between
the lung interior and the intrapleural space subsequently
builds up (Fig. 2b, red), causing respiratory branches to
successively open (Fig. 2c-d, dark blue to green to yellow), reducing the pressure in the respiratory zone (Fig.
2b, purple) and driving air flow into the lungs (Fig. 2b,
yellow). This process continues as the intrapleural cav-

6
ity expands over time. Eventually, however, the applied
stress is able to expand the chest by less and less (Fig. 2a,
plateau in green curve), and branches open at a slower
rate; the flow rate of air into the lungs eventually reaches
zero at a time t̃max ≈ 2.5 (Fig. 2b, yellow), and inhalation ceases.
Each generation is made of progressively smaller
branches having progressively larger threshold pressures
for opening. Thus, we expect lung opening to be hierarchical: the larger proximal branches open first, and
then smaller distal branches open later, after air is able
to propagate to them and exceed the capillary pressure
threshold. Our computational model captures this hierarchy of branch opening, as shown in Figs. 2c-d, complementing previous investigations of collective branch
opening [55, 77–79]. Fig. 2c shows an example of individual, connected branches in different generations as
they open. The branch in the first generation of the respiratory zone opens first (i = 17, dark blue); once it
has fully opened, air can propagate into the branch in
the next generation (i = 18, lighter blue), causing successive opening of branches through the different generations and eventually reaching the terminal alveoli (i = 23,
yellow). Notably, however, even though these terminal
generations must open later, and though their individual branches are smaller, they collectively contribute the
largest volume to the open lung, as shown in Fig. 2d; the
dark blue to yellow curves show the volume of all the open
P2i
branches in a given generation i, VG,i (t) = j=1 Vij (t),
while the brown curve shows the total open volume of the
lung V (t). Though the first generation of the respiratory
zone (dark blue) is the first to open during inhalation,
it contributes only ∼ 3% volume to the open lung; by
contrast, the terminal generation (yellow) is the last to
open, but contributes ∼ 35% of the overall lung volume.
Thus, our model quantifies the expectation that opening
later generations is key for healthy lung performance.

Influence of changes in biomechanical parameters on
inhalation

Having characterized the typical dynamics of inhalation, we next investigate how these dynamics are controlled by key biomechanical factors. Specifically, motivated by their relevance to respiratory distress stemming from the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, as well as from
prevalent conditions such as CF, COPD, asthma, and
emphysema, we focus on the role of four key factors: (i)
Muscle-induced stress σ0 , (ii) Mucus viscosity µ, (iii) Mucus surface tension γ, and (iv) Airway wall stiffness E.

Role of muscle-induced stress

Patients with COVID-19, CF, or COPD frequently exhibit fatigue and muscle weakness [80, 81]; similar symptoms also manifest in patients who have undergone mechanical ventilation as a treatment for prolonged periods
of time [82]. The analysis presented in the Theory section
suggests that this decrease in σ0 reduces the expansion
of the intrapleural cavity during inhalation, limiting the
amount of air that can be taken into the lungs and giving
rise to respiratory distress.
Our simulations with varying σ0 confirm this expectation. In particular, we find that the dynamics of lung
opening strongly depend on the applied stress (Fig. 3a),
indicating that it is a key regulator of breathing; reducing the stress exerted by the thoracic muscles decreases
the rate at which air is drawn in and prolongs the overall duration of inhalation (Fig. 3c). Indeed, when σ0 is
reduced to just half of its typical healthy value ≈ 500 Pa
[66–69], the full duration of lung opening takes nearly ten
times longer, and only reaches half the fully opened volume, as shown by the squares and circles in Fig. 3b, respectively. The corresponding stress-dependent pressurevolume (Fig. 3d) and flow rate-volume (Fig. 3c, inset)
curves obtained in our simulations are strikingly similar to those observed in experimental measurements [83].
Thus, our computational approach provides a way to
quantify the impact of specific changes in muscle-induced
stress on inhalation, shedding light on its relative influence in causing respiratory distress.

Role of mucus viscosity

A common symptom of bronchitis, CF, COPD, interstitial lung disease, and possibly COVID-19 is a large
increase in the viscosity of lung mucus [64, 84–87]. The
analysis presented in the Theory section suggests that
this increase in µ increases the time scale over which individual lung branches open, possibly slowing the opening
dynamics during inhalation and giving rise to respiratory
distress.
Our simulations with varying µ confirm this expectation. In particular, we find that the dynamics of lung
opening strongly depend on the mucus viscosity (Fig.
4a), indicating that it is another key regulator of breathing; increasing the mucus viscosity increases the time
needed to reach the capillary pressure threshold pth and
open airway branches, decreasing the rate at which air is
drawn in and prolonging the overall duration of inhalation (Fig. 4c). Indeed, when µ is increased by a factor of
∼ 10 from its typical healthy value ≈ 100 mPa-s, as can
be the case in many lung diseases [64, 84–87], the fully
opened lung volume is unchanged, but the full duration
of lung opening takes approximately five times longer, as
shown by the circles and squares in Fig. 4b, respectively.

FIG. 3. Stress applied by thoracic muscles strongly regulates dynamics and full extent of inhalation. In all panels, different
colors show different applied stresses σ0 . (a) Simulated evolution of the total open volume of the lung airways V , normalized
by the maximal lung volume V0 , as a function of the dimensionless inhalation duration τ̃ ≡ t/τB , where τB = 1 s is the
characteristic inhalation time. (b) Maximal opened volume of the lung airways Vmax (circles) decreases, and the time needed
to reach this volume tmax (squares) increases, with decreasing applied stress. Volume and time are normalized by the maximal
lung volume V0 and the characteristic inhalation time τB , respectively. Simulations are performed for times up to t̃ = 20;
therefore, values of t̃max and Ṽmax for σ0 ≤ 300 Pa are truncated, and could be even larger for simulations run over longer
durations. (c) Air inflow rate q, normalized by the characteristic flow rate V0 /τB , over time. Inset shows the variation of
the flow rate with total opened lung volume, as is often measured experimentally via spirometry. (d) Opened lung volume
V -transpulmonary pressure ptp curves, as is often measured experimentally. Pressure is normalized by atmospheric pressure
p0 ; to show the small variation of p̃tp more clearly, we plot (p̃tp − 1) × 103 on the horizontal axis. In all these simulations,
mucus viscosity µ = 100 mPa-s, mucus surface tension γ = 15 mN/m, and biomechanical parameter ζ = 1.3 × 10−3 .

Thus, alterations in mucus viscosity alter the dynamics,
but not full extent, of lung opening during inhalation.
The corresponding viscosity-dependent pressure-volume
(Fig. 4d) and flow rate-volume (Fig. 4c, inset) curves obtained in our simulations are again strikingly similar to

those observed in experimental measurements [83]. Thus,
our computational approach provides a way to quantify
the impact of specific changes in mucus viscosity on inhalation, shedding light on its relative influence in causing respiratory distress.

Role of mucus surface tension

One of the most prominent pathological features of
COVID-19 is hindered production of lung surfactant due
to viral infection, resulting in a large increase in the surface tension of airway mucus [88–91]. Similar complica-

tions arise in COPD and possibly in asthma and emphysema [81, 92, 93]. The analysis presented in the Theory
section suggests that this increase in γ has two key effects,
both of which could contribute to respiratory distress.
First, it increases the threshold pressure pth
ij = 8γ/Rij required to open a collapsed branch ij. Second, it decreases

the biomechanical parameter ζ ∝ 1/γ, which quantifies
the competition between elastic and capillary stresses in
the lung: when ζ is smaller, capillary forces are more
likely to overcome the elastic energy penalty of holding
lung branches shut. Both effects likely hinder the opening
of the lungs during respiration, giving rise to respiratory

distress in diseased patients.
Our simulations with varying γ confirm this expectation. In particular, we find that the dynamics of lung
opening strongly depend on the surface tension (Fig. 5a),
indicating that it is another key regulator of breathing;
increasing the surface tension decreases the rate at which

FIG. 6. Competition between elasticity and capillarity, quantified by the biomechanical parameter ζ, strongly regulates full
extent and dynamics of inhalation. In all panels, different colors show different ζ. (a) Simulated evolution of the total open
volume of the lung airways V , normalized by the maximal lung volume V0 , as a function of the dimensionless inhalation duration
τ̃ ≡ t/τB , where τB = 1 s is the characteristic inhalation time. (b) Maximal opened volume of the lung airways Vmax (circles)
decreases, and the time needed to reach this volume tmax (squares) increases and then decreases, with increasing ζ. Volume
and time are normalized by the maximal lung volume V0 and the characteristic inhalation time τB , respectively. (c) Air inflow
rate q, normalized by the characteristic flow rate V0 /τB , over time. Inset shows the variation of the flow rate with total opened
lung volume, as is often measured experimentally via spirometry. (d) Opened lung volume V -transpulmonary pressure ptp
curves, as is often measured experimentally. Pressure is normalized by atmospheric pressure p0 ; to show the small variation of
p̃tp more clearly, we plot (p̃tp − 1) × 103 on the horizontal axis. In all these simulations, applied muscular stress σ0 = 500 Pa,
mucus viscosity µ = 100 mPa-s, and mucus surface tension γ = 15 mN/m.

air is drawn in and prolongs the overall duration of inhalation (Fig. 5c). Indeed, when γ is increased by just a
factor of two from its typical healthy value ≈ 15 mN/m
[72, 73], as can be the case in COVID-19 and COPD
[81, 88–93], the full duration of lung opening takes nearly
four times longer, and only reaches a tenth of the fully

opened volume, as shown by the squares and circles in
Fig. 5b, respectively. Intriguingly, the duration of inhalation varies non-monotically with γ, as shown by the
squares: when γ is small, the capillary pressure threshold pth is easily overcome and the lungs open quickly,
while as γ increases, capillarity increasingly resists lung

11
opening and the duration of inhalation increases. However, as γ increases above ≈ 21 mN/m, capillarity holds
increasing numbers of branches of the lungs shut, and
inhalation is truncated—causing the duration of inhalation to decrease again. This behavior also manifests in
the simulated pressure-volume (Fig. 5d) and flow ratevolume (Fig. 5c, inset) curves, which are again strikingly
similar to those observed in experimental measurements
[83]. Indeed, we even observe the previously-reported
[94, 95] non-monotonic variation of ptp with V at low γ, as
shown by the dark purple curve: under these conditions,
because the capillary pressure threshold pth is easily overcome, rapid lung opening causes an abrupt decrease in
the lung pressure—a phenomenon that has been termed
an “elastic shock” [94, 95]. Together, these results indicate that our computational approach provides a way to
quantify the impact of specific changes in mucus surface
tension on inhalation, isolating its relative influence in
causing respiratory distress.

Role of airway wall stiffness

The elasticity of the airway wall changes greatly in
disease, often in opposing ways. For example, buildup of
excess fibrous connective tissue stiffens the airway walls
in CF, COPD, and asthma [96–99], while weakening of
the tissue leads to weaker airway walls in emphysema
[11, 100–102]; whether lung tissue elasticity increases, decreases, or stays unchanged is currently still being studied for COVID-19. The analysis presented in the Theory
section suggests that weakening of the airway walls in
emphysema hinders lung opening during inhalation, and
is likely the main contributor to respiratory distress in
this case: capillary forces due to the surface tension of
the mucus lining tend to hold the soft walls of closed
branches together. Conversely, we expect that stiffening
of the airway walls in CF, COPD, and asthma paradoxically promotes lung opening, in opposition to the respiratory distress associated with these conditions: stiffer
lungs are more difficult to bend and close shut. Thus, in
these cases, we expect that respiratory distress arises instead due to changes in other biomechanical factors, such
as mucus viscosity and surface tension, as suggested by
clinical studies [103–105].
This competition between lung elasticity and capillarity is quantified by the biomechanical parameter ζ ≡
E(T17 /R17 )3
R17
L17 12(1−ν 2 )(γ/R17 ) . When ζ is large, elastic stresses, as
quantified by 
the characteristic bending stiffness B17 ≡

3
E (T17 /R17 )
12 1 − ν 2 , dominate and peel the lung
branches open; conversely, while when ζ is small, capillarity, as quantified by the characteristic capillary pressure
γ/R17 , dominates and tends to hold the lung branches
shut. Our simulations with varying ζ, exploring the full
physiological range of ζ using measurements of the vari-

ation that arises in E and γ [56, 60, 61, 63, 64, 72, 73],
confirm this expectation. Similar to the cases of varying
σ0 and γ, the dynamics of lung opening strongly depend
on ζ (Fig. 6a), indicating that it is another key regulator of breathing; decreasing ζ decreases the rate at which
air is drawn in and prolongs the overall duration of inhalation (Fig. 6c). Intriguingly, similar to the case of
γ, the duration of inhalation varies non-monotically with
ζ, as shown by the squares in Fig. 6b: when ζ is large,
the lungs open quickly due to elastic stresses, while as ζ
decreases, elastic stresses do not pull the lungs open as
quickly and the duration of inhalation increases. However, as ζ decreases below ≈ 10−4 , elastic stresses cannot
open many branches of the lungs, and inhalation is again
truncated. This behavior also manifests in the simulated
pressure-volume (Fig. 6d) and flow rate-volume (Fig. 6c,
inset) curves, which are again strikingly similar to those
observed in experimental measurements [106, 107].
We expect that because E decreases in emphysema
[11, 100–102], and γ possibly increases [81, 92, 93], ζ
concurrently decreases and is thus the key biomechanical parameter that controls the onset of respiratory distress in this case. Conversely, because E increases in CF,
COPD, and asthma [96–99], ζ may not decrease in these
cases—suggesting that the onset of respiratory distress is
instead controlled by increases in the mucus viscosity or
surface tension, as described above. Thus, our computational approach provides a way to separately quantify
the impact of specific changes in airway wall stiffness E
on breathing, shedding light on its relative influence in
causing respiratory distress.

DISCUSSION

The work described here represents a first step toward developing a model of the lungs that accurately
describes the multi-scaled spatial and temporal features
of respiration, while still managing to be computationally
tractable. Our dynamic network approach explicitly resolves the relevant length and time scales of branch opening during inhalation, while also capturing how opening
propagates through the interconnected and hierarchical
architecture of the lungs. We demonstrate this principle
by directly connecting alterations in four key biomechanical factors—the strength of thoracic muscle contraction,
the viscosity and surface tension of the airway mucus
lining, and the elasticity of the airway wall—to overall
alterations in breathing, in qualitative agreement with
experimental and clinical findings. Our model thus helps
to establish how lung biomechanics impact respiration—
both deepening our fundamental understanding of this
ubiquitous process, and helping to elucidate how diseaseinduced changes in tissue-scale factors give rise to respiratory distress. However, despite the similarity between
our results and published measurements, direct valida-

12
tion against systematic experimental measurements or
more sophisticated models, for which the values of all
the input parameters are known, will be a crucial next
step.

Given the increasing prevalence of respiratory diseases
[108], there is a critical need for computational tools capable of quantitatively assessing the efficacy of different
therapeutic interventions, such as mechanical ventilation,
exogenous administration of lung surfactant, and exogenous administration of mucus thinners. The work described here addresses this critical need. Specifically,
it yields a generally-applicable computational model for
which measured treatment-induced changes in biomechanical parameters—e.g. {σ0 , γ, ζ, µ, Kip }—can be input, and the impact on breathing outcome can be assessed. Because different treatments alter lung biomechanics in different ways, this approach may yield useful
insights into how treatments that influence these specific
parameters will affect breathing dynamics in general—
and may eventually provide a straightforward way to
quickly assess the impact of different treatments for a
given patient.

The model presented here focused on the case of inhalation starting from a completely closed respiratory
zone as a proof of principle; however, the dynamics described in the Theory section can be extended in future work to also describe the closure of individual lung
branches due to compression of the thoracic cavity, as
well as breathing dynamics in a lung with regional atelectasis, involving a mixture of both open, partially-closed,
and fully-closed branches. Accomplishing this extension
will require development of a form of Eq. 2 that characterizes branch closure instead of opening. Further, for
both inhalation and exhalation, Eq. 2 can be replaced
by the results of more sophisticated tube models that
incorporate non-axisymmetric deformation modes, possible collapse of the mucus film, mucus-wall liquid-solid
interactions arising from the competition between viscous stress, capillary stresses, and wall deformations, and
heterogeneities in airway branch geometry [38–45, 47–
51, 57, 109–111]. Finally, while our network representation necessarily simplifies many of the rich complexities
of the lung in favor of ease of computation, it can be extended by incorporating different lung architectures, by
directly inputting specific values of {Rij , Lij , Tij }; heterogeneity in the biomechanical parameter values, by
directly inputting specific values of {Eij , γij , µij }; and
non-Newtonian mucus rheology, by incorporating a ratedependent viscosity in Eq. 2. Exploring the influence of
these different features on breathing will be an important
extension of our work.

METHODS

To simulate the dynamics of inhalation, we implement
the rules given in the Theory section in discretized form,
evaluating volumes, pressures, and flow rates at successive time steps separated by ∆t̃ using the iterative scheme
described below. We use two different notations to differentiate between branch-scale quantities and overall lungscale quantities. The tilde notation (˜) indicates that
pressure, volume, flow rate, time, and flow resistance
have been normalized by the atmospheric pressure p0 ,
maximal open lung volume V0 , characteristic flow rate
V0 /τB , breathing time τB , and characteristic flow resistance p0 τB /V0 , respectively. The hat notation (ˆ) indicates that the variables Vij , t, Rij , Γij , and ptp − pth
ij
have been normalized by the characteristic branch-scale
2
th
quantities πR17
L17 , µ/pth
17 , (γ/R17 ) /B17 , and p17 , respectively, where the subscript 17 refers to the mean
value at the first generation of the respiratory zone. For
simplicity, we assume that the air is an ideal gas at a
fixed temperature.
1. The applied stress σ0 forces the volume of the intrapleural cavity to increase:





Ṽip t̃ + ∆t̃ = Ṽip t̃ + Ṽip,0 ε t̃ + ∆t̃ − ε t̃ , (3)
where ε(t) is given by Eq. 1.
2. Given a fixed amount of air within the intrapleural space, the expansion of the intrapleural cavity
causes the pressure in the intrapleural cavity to
concomitantly decrease:


 p̃ip t̃ Ṽip t̃
(4)
p̃ip t̃ + ∆t̃ =

Ṽip t̃ + ∆t̃
3. This decrease in intrapleural pressure transiently
increases the transpulmonary pressure, which we
estimate as:



p̃tp t̃ + ∆t̃ ≈ p̃L t̃ − p̃ip t̃ + ∆t̃ .
(5)
We take p̃L to be a constant throughout the
respiratory zone due to the low air flow resistance of the respiratory zone.
In particular,
we compare the flow resistance of air through

is given by the Hagen-Poiseuille equation with an
air viscosity µair ≈ 18.5 µPa-s. Using measurements of Li and Ri throughout the airways [56, 59],
we estimate ΩC ≈ 16.4 Pa-s/L and ΩR ≈ 0.2
Pa-s/L. Since ΩR  ΩC , we assume that the air

FIG. 7. Simulation results do not change with finer discretization. Plots show the simulated evolution of lung pressures and
volumes just as in Fig. 2, but with a smaller time step ∆t̃ = 10−4 ; results are indistinguishable from those presented in the
main text with a large time step ∆t̃ = 10−3 .

flow resistance of the lungs is given by that of the
conducting zone, and the air pressure is constant
throughout the respiratory zone.
4. For each branch ij that is in contact with the open
region of the lungs, if ptp exceeds the threshold
pth
ij , this pressure difference across the branch wall
forces it to open, as given by Eq. 2:

5. As branches open, the open volume of the lungs
P23 P2i
V = VC + i=17 j=1 Vij increases, causing the
pressure in the respiratory zone pL to transiently
decrease to an intermediate value pL,int . In normal respiration, the lungs are an open system, and
air in the lungs can be treated as incompressible,
so that its density does not vary with the pressure

changes that arise during breathing due to inertial and viscous losses in the airways. However, in
our discretized representation of the lungs, for sufficiently small ∆t̃, the lungs can be approximated
to be a closed system at each intermediate time
step: the time scale of volume changes of the lungs
is much shorter than the characteristic air inflow
time scale. Thus, assuming a constant V and a
constant amount of air within the respiratory zone
during this intermediate step, we estimate the intermediate pressure as:
p̃L,int (t̃ + ∆t̃) =

p̃L (t̃)ṼL (t̃)
.
ṼL (t̃ + ∆t̃)

(7)

6. This decrease in pressure draws air into the lungs
from the atmosphere with a volumetric flow rate
q, driven by the pressure difference ∆pint ≡ p0 −
pL,int . To evaluate this flow rate, we first consider

14
the limit of ΩC → 0; in this case, the pressure
difference is fully equilibrated at each time step,
and conservation of the amount of air exchanged
int V
, where Ω0 ≡ p0 ∆t/V
= ∆pΩint
yields q = ∆p
p0 ∆t
0
is an intrinsic resistance that reflects the discrete
time formulation of the simulation. For the case
of ΩC > 0, we then modify this expression to also
incorporate ΩC :
q̃(t̃ + ∆t̃) =

∆p̃int (t̃ + ∆t̃)
.
Ω̃0 (t̃ + ∆t̃) + Ω̃C

(8)

7. Because ΩC > 0, this air flow does not fully equilibrate the pressure difference ∆pint . Instead, the
pressure in the respiratory zone at the end of the
time step is given by:

For each simulation presented in the main text, we iteratively solve Eqs. 3–9 over successive time steps separated
by ∆t̃ = 10−3 up to t̃ = 20. We obtain identical results
with even finer discretization, as shown for the case of
∆t̃ = 10−4 in Fig. 7, validating the assumptions made in
Steps 5–6 above. This iterative solving is done using a
C++ framework that explicitly considers a given lung
network structure described by the input morphological parameters {Rij , Lij , Tij , Vip,0 } and the biomechanical parameters {µ, γ, E, ν, σ0 , Kip , pip,0 }. This framework
is split into a layer of virtual classes that treat memory management, multithreading, and provide the basic
functions to create a branched network; each simulation
is then derived from these virtual base classes with data
structures defining the specific parameters that are input
into the model. This scheme thus enables us to determine
the full evolution of the pressures {p̃ip , p̃tp , p̃L }, the volumes {Ṽip , V̂ij , Ṽ } and the flow rate q̃ over time t̃.
