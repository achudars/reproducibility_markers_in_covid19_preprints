Abstract
This paper presents the assessment of time-dependent national-level restrictions and control actions and their effects in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. By analysing the transmission dynamics during the first wave of
COVID-19 in the country, the effectiveness of the various levels of control
actions taken to flatten the curve can be better quantified and understood.
This in turn can help the relevant authorities to better plan for and control
the subsequent waves of the pandemic. To achieve this, a deterministic population model for the pandemic is firstly developed to take into consideration
the time-dependent characteristics of the model parameters, especially on the
ever-evolving value of the reproduction number, which is one of the critical

measures used to describe the transmission dynamics of this pandemic. The
reproduction number alongside other key parameters of the model can then
be estimated by fitting the model to real-world data using numerical optimisation techniques or by inducing ad-hoc control actions as recorded in the
news platforms. In this paper, the model is verified using a case study based
on the data from the first wave of COVID-19 in the Republic of Kazakhstan.
The model is fitted to provide estimates for two settings in simulations; timeinvariant and time-varying (with bounded constraints) parameters. Finally,
some forecasts are made using four scenarios with time-dependent control
measures so as to determine which would reflect on the actual situations
better.

1. Introduction
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 41.5 million diagnosed cases related to COVID-19 with almost 1.15 million deaths
have been reported globally as of October 23, 2020 [27]. Although some countries such as South Korea [6], Japan [24], New Zealand [16, 23], Malaysia [22],
and Vietnam [23] had this pandemic under control during its early stages,
many countries are now battling the second [4] or even the third wave of
the pandemic [9]. In Kazakhstan, the first cases were reported on March 13,
2020 [10], which was quite late compared to other countries within the region. Right after that, the Kazakhstan government implemented aggressive
intervention methods such as lockdowns of its main cities, social distancing, quarantines, and closure of schools. Despite those efforts, the spread

2

of COVID-19 was still developing in the country before it was eventually
brought under control as seen in Figure 1, which shows the 7-day moving
average of active confirmed cases (left subfigure) and the confirmed deaths
(right subfigure) in Kazakhstan.
As such, mathematical models are essential to help analyse the dynamics
of the spread of COVID-19. One of the conventional mathematical models, namely the deterministic compartmental SIR (susceptible, infectious,
and recovered/removed) model, has been used to predict viral or bacterial
transmission diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), tuberculosis, meningitis, cholera, measles, influenza A (H1N1), and HIV [3],
[20]. The SIR model demonstrates the transportation of individuals as they
go through three mutually exclusive stages (compartments) of infection during the epidemic: susceptible (S), infected (I), and recovered/removed (R),
where the disease transmission rates with respect to time can then be simulated. The SIR model and its variations have also been used to model the
COVID-19 pandemic. For example, a discrete-time SIR model was reported
in [1], whilst a control-oriented SIR model was presented in [5]. Also, in [28],
the SIR model was used to estimate the clinical severity of COVID-19.
A commonly-used variation of the SIR model is the SEIR model, where an
exposed (E) compartment is added to model a subpopulation of people who
have been exposed to the disease but have yet to become infectious (I) [14].
This seems to be a more suitable model to describe the dynamics of COVID19 as it has been established that there exists an incubation period where an
exposed person is pre-symptomatic before starting to show symptoms and
become infectious [13]. In the literature, there are some studies on using the

SEIR model and its variants to model the COVID-19 outbreak. For example,
[11] extended the SEIR model to include age-specific studies to provide shortterm forecasts and to analyse the impact of compliancy (or the lack of) onto
the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in the UK. Meanwhile, [2] and [19]
used the SEIRD model to model the spread of COVID-19 in Korea and
Italy, respectively. [19] also used time-dependent parameters in their model.
However, these works did not provide the analysis on the effects of timedependent control actions and restrictions taken by the respective countries
to flatten the curve of COVID-19.
One of the main challenges to predict the evolution of the pandemic is

4

the curve-fitting problem. The Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) and trust-regionreflective (TRR) algorithms are amongst two of the solutions that can be
used to help solve this problem [15], [21]. They were first introduced in the
1960’s to solve nonlinear least squares problems. The least squares problems
address the issues of fitting a parameterised function to a set of measured
data points by minimising the sum of the squares of the errors between the
reference data and the prediction from the model. This could be used to
solve the parameter estimation problem for compartmental models such as
the SIR and SEIR models. Basically, the LM algorithm is the combination of
the gradient descent method and Gauss-Newton method [8]. The LM method
acts more like a gradient-descent method when the parameters are far from
their optimal value, and becomes more like the Gauss-Newton one when the
parameters are close to the optimal value. However, the LM algorithm may
not converge nicely if the initial guess is too far from the optimum, which
can be prevented by using the TRR algorithm.
The paper presents the assessment and forecast of the COVID-19 pandemic using a modified SEIRD model to estimate the time-invariant and
time-varying (with bounded constraints) parameters of the model, and also
to analyse the effects of time-dependent control actions onto the kinetics of
the spread of the virus. The SEIRD (susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered, and death) model is a variant of the SEIR model, where the death (D)
compartment is used to represent the fraction of the infectious subpopulation
who have unfortunately succumbed to the disease. As of October 25, 2020,
there have been more than 110,400 confirmed cases and 1796 deaths recorded
in Kazakhstan. The first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in Kazakhstan is

5

studied in detail as a case study. This is both critical and necessary in order
to inform on the response of the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 to the
control actions taken by the authorities in the country. The data used for
this study is represented by the shaded regions (data up till Day 108 (June
28, 2020)) in the plots in Figure 1. First, the initial fitting based on the real
data in Kazakhstan is performed using TRR algorithm using both constant
and bounded time-related parameters to obtain crucial information such as
the reproduction number of the pandemic. Further simulations are also carried out by inducing ad-hoc control actions into the model. These results
are able to help translate the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 as well
as the effects and efficacy of the control actions taken in the country. Then
some predictions are made based on these estimated parameters, where four
scenarios of reinstating of intervention measures are introduced at different
times. Simulation results show that one of the scenarios is able to describe
the current COVID-19 situation in Kazakhstan, and hence can be used to
further inform on the future plan in controlling the pandemic, especially during the unfortunate event of a second wave. Therefore, this paper will focus
mainly on the solution of the inverse problem of the model using TRR as
well as other methods that will be discussed later in this paper. This paper
does not provide the solution of the forward problem of the model. Despite
the discussion on the predictions made by the proposed model in a later
part of the paper, its main contribution is to understand the effects of timedependent control actions in flattening the COVID-19 curve. As a result, it
is of a higher interest to solve the inverse problem of the model.
This paper is organised as follows: Section 2 introduces the mathemati-

6

cal modelling of COVID-19 using SEIRD with feedback for control actions;
Section 3 presents the TRR least-squares algorithm used to estimate the reproduction number and other parameters of the model; Section 4 provides
a case study for the algorithm based on the data in Kazakhstan along with
other simulation settings with an extensive discussion of the simulation results; and Section 5 concludes the paper.
2. Mathematical Modelling of COVID-19
Firstly, consider the SEIRD model below, which is modified from the
SEIRS model in [17],
dS(t)
dt
dE(t)
dt
dI(t)
dt
dR(t)
dt
dD(t)
dt

= Λ − µS(t) − β(t)S(t)I(t),

(1)

= β(t)S(t)I(t) − (µ + α)E(t),

(2)

= αE(t) − (µ + γ)I(t) − φI(t),

(3)

= γI(t) − µR(t),

(4)

= φI(t),

(5)

where S(t), E(t), I(t), R(t), and D(t) are the compartments representing the
susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered, and deaths population, respectively. The overall population N (t) is established to be N (t) = S(t) + E(t) +
I(t) + R(t) + D(t). The constants Λ and µ are the birth rate entering the
population and death rate due to non-COVID-19-related conditions, respectively. The parameter α is the rate from being exposed to becoming infectious, and γ is the recovery rate. As a result, the incubation and recovery
periods can then be computed to be τinc = 1/α and τrec = 1/γ. The constant
7

φ = δ (dold Nold + doth (1 − Nold )) is used to describe the population from the
infectious compartment that could potentially succumb to the disease, resulting in fatality, where Nold represents the fraction of elderly population (above
65 years old), whilst dold and doth are the fatality rates of the elderly and the
rest of the population, respectively. The time to death can be computed
using τdeath = 1/δ.
The function β(t) represents the transmission rate per S-I contact, such
that β0 is the initial transmission rate at time t = 0, i.e. β(0) = β0 . Also,
define the function σef f (t) ∈ [0, 1] to represent the effective efficacy of the
intervention measures introduced to control the spread of the virus and to
flatten the curve where it is assumed that σef f (0) = 0. Therefore, β(t) can
be expressed using

 β,
0
β(t) =
 β (1 − σ
0

where σef f (t) =

Pn

i=1

for t = 0

ef f (t)),

.

(6)

for t > 0

σi (t) such that σi (t) represents the individual control

actions introduced on any particular day i of n days since the first cases have
been recorded. Therefore, σi (t) > 0 would indicate that a positive control
action has been introduced to reduce the spread of the virus. Conversely,
σi (t) < 0 would indicate a negative control action (relaxation of intervention
measures) has been taken, such as the lifting of lockdowns and other restrictions, which would then cause the transmission rate of the disease to rise
again. This condition will be further explored and studied in Section 4.4.
The value for σi (t) is assigned such that the effective efficacy of the control
actions are bounded, i.e. 0 ≤ σef f (t) ≤ 1. From (6), it can be seen that
if σef f (t) = 1, then the transmission rate becomes β(t) = 0. As a result,
8

the disease would cease to further transmit in the society and is successfully
eradicated.
Using (6), the initial basic reproduction number R0 can then be formulated, before any control action are taken (see, for example, [17] for the
mathematical proof), using
R0 =

αΛβ0
,
µ(µ + α)(µ + γ + φ)

(7)

The basic reproduction number R0 represents the average number of people
that each infected person is spreading the virus to, i.e. R0 > 1 indicates that
each infected person spreads the virus to more than one other person, hence
signifying a growing pandemic whilst R0 < 1 indicates that each infected
person spreads the virus to less than one other person, bringing the pandemic
under control. Therefore, σef f (t) has a direct effect on the basic reproduction
number for time t > 0, where the time-dependent function for the effective
reproduction number Ref f (t) can be written using
Ref f (t) =

αΛβ0 (1 − σef f (t))
.
µ(µ + α))(µ + γ + φ)

(8)

where Ref f (0) = R0 .
Assuming a closed population with negligible birth and death rates, i.e.

9

Λ/µ ≈ 1, Λ ≈ 0, and µ ≈ 0, the system (1)–(5) can be rewritten using
dS(t)
dt
dE(t)
dt
dI(t)
dt
dR(t)
dt
dD(t)
dt

= −β(t)S(t)I(t),

(9)

= β(t)S(t)I(t) − αE(t),

(10)

= αE(t) − γI(t) − φI(t),

(11)

= γI(t),

(12)

= φI(t),

(13)

and that the overall population is invariant such that
dN (t)
= 0 ∀t ≥ 0 −→ N (0) = N (∞).
dt
As a result, the initial basic reproduction number in (7) can be re-expressed
using
β0
,
(14)
γ+φ
and subsequently, the time-dependent effective reproduction number in (8)
R0 =

can be written using
Ref f (t) =

β0 (1 − σef f (t))
.
γ+φ

(15)

This assumption and model setup will be used for the case study in Section
4. Figure 2 shows the block diagram of the model.
3. Estimation of Reproduction Number and Other Model Parameters
The system (9)–(13) can be described using the continuous-time dynamical system

at time t = 0. The vector p = (α, β, γ, δ) ∈ R4 represents the parameters in
the system that are to be estimated. The other parameters, namely Nold , doth ,
and dold are assumed to be constants, thus they are omitted from being included into the vector p. Therefore, by estimating β, γ, and δ, an estimation
for Ref f (t) can be produced using (15).
The function f : U → R5 is a nonlinear map such that the domain U has

and x̂(t) is the predicted or estimated states of the system. It is also established that the parameters are bounded, i.e. pmin ≤ p ≤ pmax , to reflect on
more realistic real-world values.
4. Case Study: Modelling the COVID-19 Outbreak in Kazakhstan
At the time of writing, Kazakhstan has passed the first wave of the
COVID-19 infected curve but it has still yet to encounter a second wave
like many other nations. As such, the data obtained in the country will be
an interesting case study for modelling the outbreak of the virus and the
prediction of the reproduction number such that its transmission dynamics
and the effectiveness of the national-level control actions can be better understood. These results could then be potentially used to predict the future
dynamics of the pandemic in Kazakhstan and the suitable control actions
12

to be taken to help flatten the curve. Table 1 shows the major events and
control actions taken by the Kazakhstan government up till Day 103 (Jun
22, 2020) in controlling the spread of COVID-19.
4.1. Population Facts and Initial Assumptions of the Model
The current population N in Kazakhstan is approximately 18.8 million
according to the [25] and the fraction of elderly population (65 years of age
and above) Nold is 8% according to the [18]. The incubation period τinc is
set to 5.1 days in line with the report in [13] and the recovery period τrec is
18.8 days according to [7]. For this simulation, it is assumed initially that
the time to death τdeath is the same as the recovery period, i.e. τdeath = τrec ,
where the patient spends the same amount of time hospitalised whether or
not they recover from the disease. Based on the data published by [27],
the fatality rates of the elderly population and nonelderly population are
approximated to be 3% and 1.5%, respectively. The initial infectious cases are
set to I(0) = 2 and it is assumed that E(0) = 20×I(0). This initial condition
for E(0) is made assuming that 20 persons are exposed to each of the initially
infectious person through various physical means and contacts. It is also
found through simulations that these assumptions also fit the model well to
the initial dynamics of the reported cases. The initial basic reproduction
number R0 is assumed to be 3.0. Table 2 shows the summary of the initial
assumptions of the states and parameters used to fit the initial trajectory of
COVID-19 in Kazakhstan.
However, it is to note that given the limited data available on COVID19 where most countries only report on the cumulative infectious and deaths
cases, only a subset of the states x(t) can be used to estimate the parameters.

4.3, the model is fitted and its parameters estimated using a time step of 7
days, assuming constant and bounded constraints for time-related parameters, respectively. In Section 4.4, the effects of the control actions taken by
estimating the value of the control actions efficacy σi (t) and subsequently,
σef f (t), over time in relation to the timeline of COVID-19-related events in
the country are analysed. This paper will also provide some analysis on the
trajectories past Day 108 of the virus for different times of which control
actions can be reinstated.
4.2. Simulation 1: Estimating Model Parameters Using TRR Assuming Bounded
Constraints for β and Constant α, γ, δ
First, the fitting of the model is made using the algorithm in (20) assuming that the parameters α, γ, and δ remain constant as set out in Table 2. As
for β(t), it is assumed to be bounded such that 0.01 ≤ β(t) ≤ 1. See Table 3.
Figure 3 shows the results of the fitting of the model compared with the data.
Figure 3A and Figure 3B show the key plots of the 7-day moving average of
the active confirmed cases and the cumulative deaths, respectively. Figure
3C shows the trajectories of all compartments in the SEIRD model. It can
16

be seen that although the active confirmed cases can be predicted relatively
well, the predictions for the cumulative deaths are not able to follow the actual data. This is due to the less flexibility in the fitting of the model as all
time-related parameters are assumed to be unchanged. Figures 3D–3F show
the extended trajectories of Figures 3A–3C until the model reaches its equilibrium after about 1000 days since the first cases were reported, assuming
that no further control action is taken after Day 108. These results show that
the active confirmed cases could peak around Day 500 with approximately
0.6 million cases whilst the cumulative deaths could reach a total of about
50,000. Given that the fitting for the cumulative deaths is underestimated,
the actual numbers could potentially rise much higher than the result shown
in Figure 3E. Table 4 shows the estimated reproduction number Ref f (t) over
time.
4.3. Simulation 2: Estimating Model Parameters Using TRR Assuming Bounded
Constraints for All Parameters
The simulation is then repeated assuming now that all parameters to
be estimated are bounded. The incubation period is assumed to be bounded
with a range from two to 14 days [13]. The recovery period and time to death
are assumed to be bounded with a range from one to 60 days [7]. See Table
5. The results shown in Figure 4A and Figure 4B depict that both the active
confirmed cases and cumulative deaths are able to fit to the actual data much
better compared to Figure 3A and Figure 3B from Simulation 1 in Section 4.2.
Figure 4C shows the trajectories of all compartments in the SEIRD model.
Table 6 shows the results for the estimated parameters from the optimisation
process, which indicate that with the bounded constraints now applied to the

15 and 22 (highlighted using bold text in Table 6) could be attributed to
potentially lack of testing and record of cases as the country was still coming
to grips with the presence of the virus in the society during the earlier stages
of the pandemic. Figures 4D–4F show the extended trajectories of Figures
4A–4C until the model reaches its equilibrium after about 1200 days since
the first cases were reported, assuming that no further control action is taken
after Day 108. The results show that with bounded constraints applied to all
parameters, the active confirmed cases could peak at slightly over 0.75 million
cases around Day 600 whilst the cumulative deaths could reach a total of
slightly over 250,000 cases. Nonetheless, both simulations in Sections 4.2 and
4.3 agree that the virus would continue to spread in the society with a mean
reproduction number of Ref f (t) ≈ 1.44 for the time window beginning Day
106. Hence, it is essential that effective intervention measures and control
actions have to be taken to bring the pandemic under control, i.e. to achieve
the reproduction number of Ref f (t) < 1.

4.4. Simulation 3: Estimating σef f (t) and Assessment of Current COVID-19
Profile
To understand the effectiveness of the intervention measures taken by the
Kazakhstan government to stop the spread of the virus up to Day 108, the
model is simulated by inducing ad-hoc control actions σi (t) into the model
in line with the main events shown in Table 1 as well as to fit to the actual
data.
The same fitting parameters in Table 2 are used with the exception of R0
and I(0), where initial values of R0 = 3.7 and I(0) = 5 are assumed, respectively. The solid lines in Figure 5A and Figure 5B represent the estimated
data based on the fitting parameters; the solid line in Figure 5A shows the
number of 7-day moving average active confirmed cases whereas the solid line
in Figure 5B shows the number of cumulative deaths. The results show that
without any control measures, the curves would rise exponentially indicating
that the pandemic would continue to grow. For example, the number of active infected cases would reach about 55,000 by Day 140 whilst the number
of deaths would exceed 5000 by Day 180. It is further noted that this trend of
rising cases agrees with the results obtained from Simulation 2 in Section 4.3.
The unshaded rows in Table 7 show the progress of the efficacy of individual
control actions σi (t), the effective efficacy of control actions σef f (t), and the
reproduction number Ref f (t) over time since the first confirmed cases in the
country. The negative values for the efficacy of individual control actions,
i.e. σi (t) < 0 (highlighted using bold text in Table 7) indicate the relaxation
of the control actions such as the lifting of lockdowns or state of emergency
and the removal of checkpoints between cities. It can also be seen that these

21

coincide with such corresponding events in Table 1, i.e. Day 40 with the
easing of quarantine regulations and the reopening of certain business and
industries and 60 with the gradual lifting of quarantines and end of state
of emergency (σi (t) = −0.48 on Day 63 in Table 7), and Day 78 with the
removal of checkpoints between cities (σi (t) = −0.40 on Day 88 in Table
7), respectively. As a result, a resurgence of the spread of COVID-19 would
follow where the Ref f (t) increase to 2.37 and 1.85 on Days 63 and 88, respectively. It can be observed that there is a lag of 10–20 days between the
announcements of the enforcements or lifting of control actions to the actual
effects being recorded via the confirmed cases. This could be due to a few
reasons, namely (i) the incubation time with a median of 5.1 days before a
patient starts to show symptoms and become infectious; (ii) the time delay
incurred for the population and the industries involved to respond and act
according to the control actions announcements, which could take one to two
weeks.
4.5. Comparison of Simulation Results
The simulation results obtained in Sections 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4 are then
compared to see how well each of the simulation methods are able to fit to
the actual data. See Figure 6, where Figure 6A and Figure 6B compare the
model fitting error for the active confirmed cases and cumulative deaths of
the three simulation methods, respectively.
For the model fitting error for the active confirmed cases, Figure 6A
shows that all three methods manage to achieve errors with a median of less
than 150 cases; medians of 57.13, 3.67, and 115.10 for Simulations 1, 2, and
3, respectively. Whilst Simulation 2 produces the smallest error amongst

the three simulation methods, this could also indicate that the model is
overfitted. This might not be able to inform well on the effectiveness of the
control action taken on the effective reproduction number Ref f (t) in relation
to the timeline of the main events tabulated in Table 1.
As for the model fitting error for the cumulative deaths, Figure 6B shows
that again all three methods manage to achieve errors with relatively low
median of less than ten cases (medians of 8.70, 0.82, and 9.10 for Simulations
1, 2, and 3, respectively) even though Simulation 3 produces a much larger
interquartile range (IQR) compared to Simulations 1 and 2. And as with the
model fitting error for the active confirmed cases, the model obtained from
23





Simulation 2 could be overfitted.
Despite results from Simulation 3 producing slightly larger errors with a
higher median and larger IQR compared to Simulations 1 and 2, this method
will be used in Section 4.6 to simulate and predict the future trajectories of
the dynamics from reinstating control and intervention measures to bring the
pandemic under control. The main reason for this is that the method used
in Simulation 3 allows for manual setting of ad-hoc control actions in the
model in line with the timeline of the main events in Table 1. Hence, this
will help to inform and allow us to understand more on the effectiveness of
time-dependent control actions taken in reducing the value of Ref f (t), hence
bringing the outbreak of COVID-19 under control.
4.6. Predictions on Reinstating Control and Intervention Measures
Assume now that following the results obtained via Simulation 3 in Section 4.4, the reproduction number is to be reduced to Ref f (t) < 1 such that
the spread of the virus is under control. As a result, the necessary intervention measures have to be reinstated. Hence, four scenarios are simulated
where the intervention measures would be reinstated on Days 116, 123, 130,
and 137, respectively by setting σi (t) = 0.58 such that the reproduction
number becomes Ref f (t) = 0.50 as shown using the shaded rows in Table 7.
With Scenario 1, the number of active confirmed cases would reach its
peak around Day 120 with 14,500 cases before they gradually reduce indicating that the pandemic is under control. For Scenarios 2–4, the active
confirmed cases peak on Days 128, 135, and 142, with about 21,600, 32,200,
and 48,000 cases, respectively. These data are shown using the dashed, dotted, dashed-dot, and dashed-x lines in Figures 5A and 7A, where the latter
24

shows the trajectories until the model reaches equilibrium. Similarly, the
dashed, dotted, dashed-dot, and dashed-x lines in Figure 5B and Figure 7B
show the total number of deaths for these four scenarios. The total number
of deaths are estimated to be approximately 1000, 1400, 2000, and 2900 for
Scenarios 1–4, respectively. On a further note, although the active confirmed
cases would reach the equilibrium around Day 400 with almost the same
value of approximately 45–130 cases (see Figure 7A), the simulation results
from the four scenarios clearly show that with every delay of 7 days in reinstating the intervention measures, the peaks of the active confirmed cases
and cumulative deaths (see Figure 7B) would increase exponentially. Therefore, it is obvious that the sooner the reinstating of intervention measures are
implemented, the better the outcomes of the situation, especially to reduce
deaths and save precious lives.
From these simulations, it is evident that the current situation in Kazakhstan is developing quite closely to Scenario 3 for both active confirmed
and cumulative deaths cases. As a result, perhaps these information can be
potentially used to address and control the pandemic during an unfortunate
event of a second wave. In addition, the results shown in Table 7 can also
be further analysed to model the mobility and dynamics of the population
in the country and its various districts in responding to various levels of
intervention measures taken by the authorities.
5. Conclusion
This paper has discussed and presented a methodology to assess the current COVID-19 pandemic profile and to use those information to provide
25

critical information on efficacy and effects of time-dependent control actions
in flattening the curve of COVID-19. A modified SEIRD model was used
in this study and the parameters of the mathematical model as well as
the reproduction number were estimated, for both constant and bounded
constraints conditions for time-related parameters, using the trust-regionreflective (TTR) algorithm where the data in Kazakhstan were used as a
case study. A further analysis was carried out by inducing ad-hoc control
actions into the model and to determine how well they correspond to actual events and control actions recorded in the country. Four scenarios were
further simulated to provide understanding about the effects of reinstating
intervention measures taken 7 days apart of each other onto the active confirmed and cumulative deaths cases. The results show that any delay in
reinstating the intervention measures would increase the peak of the active
confirmed cases and also the cumulative deaths exponentially. Of course, the
quantitative analysis in this paper is highly dependent on the accuracy of the
input data. With the limited data available and using the presented modelling, assessment, and prediction techniques, it is hope that this research
is able to inform the transmission dynamics of the virus and provide some
useful information and analyses for the COVID-19 situation in Kazakhstan.

Figure 5: Simulation 3: The solid lines in both subfigures show the simulation results
from fitting the SEIRD model onto the data in Kazakhstan by updating the value of the
control action efficacy σef f (t) over time as discussed in Section 4.4. The subfigures show
the results for (A) the 7-day moving average active confirmed cases and (B) cumulative
deaths, respectively. The dashed, dotted, dashed-dot, and dashed-x lines in both subfigures
show the predictions based on four control action scenarios on Days 116, 123, 130, and
137 (vertical blue dotted lines), respectively, as presented in Section 4.6. The vertical grey
dotted lines show the timestamps related to COVID-19 in Kazakhstan as listed in Table
1.
