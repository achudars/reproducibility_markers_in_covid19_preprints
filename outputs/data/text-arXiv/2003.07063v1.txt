We study the data for the cumulative as well as daily number of cases in the Covid-19 outbreak in
China. The cumulative data can be fit to an empirical form obtained from a Susceptible-InfectedRemoved (SIR) model studied on an Euclidean network previously. Plotting the number of cases
against the distance from the epicenter for both China and Italy, we find an approximate power law
variation with an exponent ∼ 1.85 showing strongly that the spatial dependence plays a key role,
a factor included in the model. We report here that the SIR model on the Eucledean network can
reproduce with a high accuracy the data for China for given parameter values, and can also predict
when the epidemic, at least locally, can be expected to be over.

The novel corona virus (COVID-19), which causes an
acute respiratory disease in humans has already spread
to nearly 150 countries and has recently been declared
as a pandemic by the World Health Organisation [1, 2].
The original epicenter has been identified as the city of
Wuhan in mainland China and the virus has later spread
to other countries, affecting most severely Italy and Iran.
At present, the epicenter is believed to have shifted to
Europe. While the rise in the number of cases in the
western world is alarming, drastic precautionary steps
taken in China, South Korea and Hongkong have been
successful in containing the virus as of now. A clear picture of the space-time dependence of the spread of the
virus can be understood best from the data of China for
which the numbers are quite large.
Considerable number of analysis of the available data
of the number of cases and deaths have been attempted
recently, and a few data driven models have also been
proposed [3–18]. In particular, an exponential growth
in time in the early stage is noted in all the countries
majorly affected, however, the number of deaths is seen
to follow a power law behaviour [17]. This could be due
to purely medical reasons, the possibility of survival also
depends on the stage of detection and treatment received.
Since the virus can be contracted only once, an affected person either dies or recovers; it belongs to the
class of infectious diseases considered in the SusceptibleInfected-Removed (SIR) type of models. In this model,
the population is divided into three categories, Susceptible, Infected and Removed; the total population (including the deaths) is constant. As the disease propagates,
susceptibles are liable to get infected, the infected people either die or recover (treated in the same manner);
the total infected population over time form the removed
category. Usually the densities are considered and denoted by S, I and R for the three categories and depend
on time t, with I = dR
dt and S + I + R = 1. In such
epidemics, I, corresponding to newly infected density in
real situations, initially shows a slow increase with time
that changes into a steep rise before it reaches a maximum value. Typically, the increasing phase shows an

exponential behaviour. After reaching the peak, it gradually decreases before reaching a zero value when one
can declare that the epidemic is over. China is already
in this decreasing phase while most other countries are
yet to reach the peak value. The cumulative data, R,
accordingly, shows a saturation once the peak value has
been crossed.
In Fig. 1, we plot the data for the total fraction of cases
R versus time for China where the number of total cases
is divided by the total population NChina , using the data
in [19] where the daily reports are available starting from
January 21, 2020 (Day 0), The number of records is 50 up
to March 11. A jump in the data shows up on the 26th
day, this is presumably because initially, the criteria to be
satisfied to confirm that a person has actually contracted
the disease had been more stringent and relaxed later on.
The resultant jump in the data makes it a bit difficult
to fit with a smooth function, nevertheless, one can fit
the data to the empirical form
R(t) = a exp(t/T )/[1 + c exp(t/T )]

(1)

with a = 1.15698 × 10−6 , c = 0.0201529 and T = 5.22.
The error involved for a and c are about 16% while for
T it is 4.3%. This was already noted in an earlier report
for the data up to day 40 [18]. The data for the number
of newly infected people I has more scatter and instead
of a direct fitting, we calculate it by differentiating R
with respect to t. The peak value of I can be found out

FIG. 2. The number of cases recorded in a place at a distance
from the epicenter is shown in a log-log plot for China and
Italy. Data updated till March 12, 2020. For Italy, the number
of cases is multiplied by 50 for better comparison, these data
have also been logarithmically binned.

by calculating the maximum of I and one can also locate the time tp when the peak occurred: tp = T ln(1/c).
This gives a value 20.38 which is larger than the actual
value (∼ 15), the discrepancy may be due to the discontinuity in the data as mentioned earlier. Note that the
above analysis can be made only when I has entered the
decreasing phase.
The empirical form given in Eq. (1) was actually obtained from a theoretical model of SIR on an Euclidean
network studied previously [20] and was also shown to
fit accurately the data for the Ebola outbreak in West
Africa [21] that occurred around 5 years back. In this
model, one assumes that apart from the nearest neighbours, there are also connections randomly at a distance
ℓ with a probability P (ℓ) proportional to ℓ−δ . Here an
infected person can infect her nearest neighbours with
a probability q. Although one assumes that there is no
mobility for the agents here, the fact that they can infect
a person at a distance, implicitly includes the possibility
that the agent can travel.
To justify that one requires a Euclidean model to fit
the data, we have also calculated the number of cases
R(d) recorded as a function of the Haversine distance d,
in Km, from the epicenter. Taking Wuhan as the epicenter, this data are obtained for China. Since Italy has
also recorded a large number of cases, we plot the data for
Italy alongside, taking Bergamo as the epicenter, where
the largest number of cases have been recorded. Both
show consistency with a power law decay at larger distances as shown in Fig. 2;
R(d) ∝ d−γ

distance ( d )

with γ = 1.85 ± 0.1. Since the data understandably have
a large amount of scatter (even after binning), this estimate is approximately made. While it is expected that
R(d) will decrease with d, the power law behaviour is not
obvious. The correlation coefficient is also calculated for
the two sets of data; for China it is -0.268 while for Italy
the value is -0.383.
This distance dependence, however, can only be obtained with the identification of the epicenter, otherwise
one obtains no systematic dependence as was the case

when the data for the rest of the world were plotted with
Wuhan as epicenter [18].
The form of R and the power law dependence of the
infection supports the claim that a Euclidean network
model is appropriate to study the outbreak phenomena.
However, to establish that indeed a SIR model on a Euclidean network can explain the data, we next simulate
a “agent based” to find the appropriate values, if any, of
the parameters that can reproduce the data accurately.
For Ebola outbreak, this was quite successfully done using this simple model.
For the SIR model on the Euclidean network, we have
two parameters, δ, already defined, and q, the infection
probability. The value of δ essentially denotes the range
of contact, δ ≥ 2 corresponds to a short range model.
The model shows long range behaviour for δ < 2 and
for sufficiently small values of δ manifests small world
behaviour [22]. For real world network, δ is therefore expected to be less than 2, however, the data plotted in Fig.
2 suggests it is not very far from 2. In the model, there
exists a critical value of the infection probability, denoted
by qc , above which the disease becomes epidemic. qc obviously depends on δ and for appropriate reproduction of
the data, q must be above qc (δ).
In the simulation, 100 different network configurations
have been used. Initially, one randomly chosen node is
infected. For each network, 800 such choices have been
considered. A system of 212 nodes has been taken; each
node is connected to its nearest neighbours and one more
node at a distance randomly on an average. To compare
the results of the model with the real data, it is also required to normalise the latter and thus we consider the
fraction of total infected people that is plotted in Fig. 1.
However, this number is rather small even for the saturation value while in the model it is O(0.1). Thus one needs
to rescale the data obtained from the model to show
the agreement. The time unit is one Monte Carlo Step
(MCS) in the simulation, and also needs to be rescaled
according to the real data. The rescaling factor for the
fraction of affected people for the results obtained from
the data is determined from the saturation values of the
real data and data from the simulations. The rescaling is
done such that the two coincide, of course, this does not

3
ensure the entire data will match. We also argue that
this factor gives an idea of the fraction of the population
exposed to the disease. For China, the fraction (rescaling
factor) ρ = 6.0783 × 10−5. This factor can be interpreted
as the fraction of the population exposed to the disease.
For the time axis, we find T in days ≈ 0.95 times a Monte
Carlo step and the rescaling is done accordingly.
Fig. 3 shows the real data and the results from the
model after the rescaling is done with the parameters
δ = 1.8 and q = 0.85. Here we have also shown the
comparison for the new case density. We note that the
data match quite well with the simulation results, apart
from the discontinuity in the real data that cannot be
reproduced in the simulation. Both δ and q values, when
varied within ±0.05, continue to show fairly good agreement.
From the model, one can also predict when the disease
is going to stop. Ideally this happens when I becomes
zero - no infected person is left in the population. Here,
if I becomes less than 1/NChina , one can assume that no
infected person remains. Accordingly we find that time
to be around 64 MCS steps which corresponds to 61 days.
On the other hand, the simulation shows zero infected
agents at 82 MCS steps which corresponds to about 78
real days. This indicates one can expect the disease to be
eradicated from China approximately within 60-78 days
from January 21, 2020. Of course these are averaged
values and fluctuations will be there.
Discussions: We find a rather high value of δ which
gives nice agreement: this may indicate the range of the
contact between infected and infectious agents is quite
short. In principle, δ can vary from country to country
depending on density of population, travel patterns and
other factors. It is also significant that the value of δ is
quite close to γ (eq. (2)) found in the real data.

The model, as mentioned earlier, had also reproduced
quite well the data for Ebola outbreak. In comparison,
we find a larger value of q, the infection probability, here.
This is consistent, as in Ebola, the infection is transmitted through more intimate contact.
An important and interesting point is we obtained
good agreement without any factor representing preventive measures in the model. Here, how the disease is contained in the model should be well understood. In the
model, at later stages, the disease gets controlled as an infected person no longer finds enough susceptible people to
infect. Indirectly this means, the susceptible people now
live in isolation which is exactly what is being aimed at
by imposing curbs on the mobility and social life of the
citizens. So the model, where mobility is not allowed, in
a way successfully mimics this situation. Incorporating
preventing factors by making e.g, q time dependent or
reducing the number of neighbours in the model will of
course show a flattening of the daily cases curve [23], on
the other hand one must then also include the possibility
that the virus mutates and becomes stronger. In another
recent analysis, the death factor has also been incorporated in the SIR [24]. In any case these factors will make
the model more complicated and our results show it is
not necessary. Also, whether in reality improvement in
treatment helps in controlling the disease is a debatable
point. A recent analysis suggests that enhanced medical
facilities can theoretically have an effect in flattening the
daily cases curve, but not so in practice [25]. So social
isolation is the key factor that is ultimately responsible
for the control of the disease.
