Abstract
Coronavirus (COVID-19) creates fear and uncertainty, hitting the global economy and
amplifying the financial markets volatility. The oil price reaction to COVID-19 was gradually
accommodated until March 09, 2020, when, 49 days after the release of the first coronavirus
monitoring report by the World Health Organization (WHO), Saudi Arabia floods the market
with oil. As a result, international prices drop with more than 20% in one single day. Against
this background, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of COVID-19 numbers
on crude oil prices, while controlling for the impact of financial volatility and the United States
(US) economic policy uncertainty. Our ARDL estimation shows that the COVID-19 daily
reported cases of new infections have a marginal negative impact on the crude oil prices in the
long run. Nevertheless, by amplifying the financial markets volatility, COVID-19 also has an
indirect effect on the recent dynamics of crude oil prices.

1. Introduction

The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic outbreaks Wuhan (Hubei region from China),
where the first infection case is reported on December 31, 2019. 49 days after the release of the
first coronavirus monitoring report by the World Health Organization (WHO) on January 21,
2020, over 100,000 people from more than 100 countries around the world are affected.
Although COVID-19 does not present similar patterns in terms of fatality rate as compared to
the 2002-2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), or in terms of global spread as
compared to the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1919, the new coronavirus is very contagious and
triggers a lot of uncertainty in the real economy and financial markets. 1 COVID-19 negatively
affects the overall demand, creating short-run volatility in the food prices,2 and impending the
mobility of workers and tourists. In addition, COVID-19 creates fear and additional stress on
financial markets, where the price volatility is continuously increasing. Anticipating a strong
decrease in the global demand in the next period, Saudi Arabia starts an oil price war on March
09, 2020, and floods the market with oil. In one single day, the crude oil price plunges with
more than 20%. This shock spills over financial markets that crash during the same day (the
Black Monday).
In this context, the present research tempts to investigate how the COVID-19 new
infection cases affect the oil price, while controlling for the role of financial stress and volatility
(VIX index), and the United States (US) economic policy uncertainty (EPU). To this end, we
resort to an Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) specification, which allow us to see if the
relationship between oil price, financial volatility, economic policy uncertainty and COVID-19
converge toward a long-run equilibrium, in the presence of both stationary and non-stationary
series.
The relationship between stock prices and oil prices was intensively debated in the
literature given the financialization of commodity markets (for a recent review, see Balcilar et
al., 2019; Wen et al., 2019). However, the interaction between financial volatility on the one
hand and oil prices on the other hand, has received less attention. Illing and Liu (2006) notice
that oil price shocks correspond to picks in the financial stress index for Canada, and formally
test this relationship. In fact, financial stress episodes affect the stock market returns and create
volatility, whereas the stock prices and oil prices are highly correlated. Recent works in this

line document a bidirectional relationship between oil prices and financial volatility (e.g. Basher
and Sadorsky, 2016; Das et al., 2018; Nazlioglu et al. (2015).
Another strand of literature investigates the relationship between the oil price and the
economic policy uncertainty (EPU), resorting to the EPU index constructed by Baker et al.
(2016). This relationship is particularly important for the US, the dollar being the transaction
currency on oil markets. Oil prices influence the forecasts of macroeconomic variables and
therefore the US EPU. At the same time, policy-induced uncertainty influences the asset prices
in general, including oil prices. Therefore, recent papers investigate the both sides of the coin,
looking to the reverse causality between the oil price and the EPU, and reporting mixed
findings. A first set of papers (e.g. Antonakakis et al., 2014; Kang et al., 2017) shows that oil
price shocks impact the US EPU. A second set of studies underlines, on contrary, that US EPU
dynamics triggers movements in international oil prices (Aloui et al., 2016; Yang, 2019).
Finally, a separate strand of the literature assesses the interaction between both economic
uncertainty and financial volatility, and the oil price. In a quantile regression framework,
Reboredo and Uddin (2016) test to what extent the financial stress and policy uncertainty impact
the energy and metal commodity prices in the US. They report a nonlinear effect of EPU and
VIX on oil prices. With a focus on the shocks in oil prices, Degiannakis et al. (2018) document
a time-varying effect on the US EPU and financial uncertainty, in specific periods.3 However,
none of these studies investigates the uncertainty, fear and panic triggered by COVID-19 on oil
prices.
Therefore, our first contribution to the exiting literature is the assessment of the impact
of COVID-19 on oil prices, while controlling for the role of US EPU and VIX. As far as we
know, this is the first paper approaching this subject, which will certainly modify the public
agendas for the following months.4 We use the WHO official announcements in terms of
COVID-19 new infection cases, and the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for crude oil prices.
Second, resorting to daily data, we look to both the short- and long-run relationship between oil
prices, VIX and the US EPU. Our series are either I(1) or I(0), which recommends the use of
the ARDL approach proposed by Pesaran et al. (2001). Third, we assess the effect of COVID19 on oil prices, looking to the impact of the total number of new infection cases, as well as to

We notice that the relationship between economic uncertainty, financial volatility and oil prices is characterized
by reverse causality. In fact, even the economic policy uncertainty represents a reliable cause of financial markets
volatility as shown by Antonakakis et al. (2013), Li et al. (2019), Mei et al. (2018), Phan et al. (2020), Su et al.,
(2019), Tiwari et al. (2019), Zhenghui and Junhao (2019).

findings considering the BRENT crude prices.
The rest of the paper presents the literature (Section 2, data and methodology (Section 3),
the empirical findings (Section 4) and the robustness results (Section 5). Finally, we conclude.

2. Literature review

Our paper stands at the crossroad of two strands of the literature, the first one investigating
the relationship between the oil price and the financial volatility, and the second one addressing
the interaction between the oil price and the economic policy uncertainty.
Within the first line of research, Illing and Liu (2006) investigate the financial instability
in Canada and notice a positive correlation between the level of financial stress and oil price
shocks. More recently, Gkillas et al. (2020) discover that financial stress helps to improve the
oil price forecasts. Conducted an analysis over the period January 4, 2000 – May 26, 2017, the
authors resort to different financial stress indexes and underline that particular attention should
be paid to the financial volatility originated from the US, in order to correctly anticipate the oil
price dynamics.
The implied financial volatility of S&P 500 (VIX) is often used as a proxy for financial
stress and volatility. For example, Nazlioglu et al. (2015) conduct a volatility spillover analysis
on the US for the period 1991 to 2014 and document a bidirectional relationship between VIX
and the US EPU. The authors also report the dominance of the long-run volatility spillover. In
the same spirit, Das et al. (2018) examine the dependence between stock prices, commodity
prices, and financial stress. The authors resort to a nonparametric causality-in-quantile
technique and focus on the US economy. They document a bilateral causality between oil prices
and financial volatility. The result confirms the findings by Basher and Sadorsky (2016) who
investigate the hedging property of oil prices and VIX, for emerging markets stock prices.
The relationship between EPU and oil prices reveals its turn the existence of a reverse
causality situation. For example, Chen et al. (2020) apply a discrete wavelet transform and show
that the impact of oil price shocks on EPU is positive at all frequencies, a result in line with
Kang et al. (2017) and the findings reported by Antonakakis et al. (2014). Likewise, Kang et
al. (2017) investigate the interaction between the US EPU and different economic and financial
variables, including the oil price. They find that the oil supply shocks originated from US and
non-US explain over 20% from the US EPU variation. Similar findings are reported by
Antonakakis et al. (2014) who resort to the spillover index proposed by Diebold and Yilmaz
4

(2012) and report that EPU shocks negatively respond to oil price shocks and vice-versa.
Hailemariam et al. (2019) extend the analysis at the level of G7 countries using monthly data
from 1997 to 2018. They underline the existence of a time-varying effect of oil prices on EPU.
Other studies highlight the impact of uncertainty on oil price returns. With a focus on
extreme dependencies and resorting to a copula approach, Aloui et al. (2016) show that an
increased EPU index has a positive effect on oil prices in periods that precede financial crises’
outburst. A nonparametric causality-in-quantiles method is proposed by Shahzad et al. (2017)
to investigate the causal effect of investors’ sentiments and EPU on commodity prices,
including oil. At the same time, Ma et al. (2018) resort to threshold forecast frameworks and
notice that EPU is important to explain oil futures price. Similar, Yang (2019) performs both a
causality and a spillover analysis between EPU and oil price shocks and emphasizes that oil
prices behave as net receivers of information from EPU. Albulescu et al. (2019) implement a
different approach and show that the US EPU influences the connectedness between oil and
currency markets.
None of these studies focuses, however, on the recent situation generated by the COVID19 crisis. Therefore, we fill in this gap and test the impact of coronavirus numbers and West
Texas Intermediate (WTI) prices on the US EPU (we use BRENT crude for robustness
purpose). As far as we know, this is the first paper addressing the impact of the COVID-19
crisis on the US policy-induced economic uncertainty.

3. Data and methodology

3.1. Data
COVID-19 data are extracted from the daily situation reports released by WHO starting
with January 21, 2020. Consequently, our sample covers the period January 21, 2020 – March
09, 2020 (49 observations). The oil price data are obtained from the US Energy Information
Administration (EIA), whereas the financial volatility (VIX) data comes from the Chicago
Board Options Exchange (CBOE). The US EPU daily data are derived from Baker et al. (2016)
and daily updated for the US on their website.5
Figure 1 presents the dynamics of the indicators. Figure 1(a) shows that crude oil prices
record a continuous decline since the official monitoring of COVID-19, and a severe crash
starting with March 6, 2020. During this period, the financial volatility and economic policy

uncertainty were continuously growing. On February 17, 2020 the Chinese authorities reported
19,461 new infection cases which created a panic on the US financial markets and the
transactions were closed during that day. This number is intentionally omitted from Figure 1(b)
which underpin two waves of COVID-19 new infections, the first recorded in China, and the
second mirroring the conditions outside China, where countries as Italy, Iran and South Korea
are severely affected. The death ratio climbed to 3.5% on March 10, 2020. Figure 1(c) shows
that the number of infected people overpasses the psychological barrier of 100,000, whereas
the number of affected countries increases exponentially since February 24, 2020. Finally,
Figure 1(d) highlights opposite movements of oil prices and death ratio associated with
COVID-19 starting with the second part of February.

2.2. Methodology
In order to estimate the relationship between oil prices, COVID-19, VIX and EPU, we
use the ARDL model proposed by Pesaran et al. (2001), who is compatible with both I(0) and
I(1) series.6
The Pesaran et al.’s (2001) framework uses a linear transformation to integrate short-run
adjustments into the long-run equilibrium, resorting to an Error Correction Model (ERM), as
follows:
p

∆Oilt =c+δoil Oilt-1 +δCOVID-19 COVID-19t +δVIX VIXt-1 +δEPU EPUt-2 + ∑i=1 αi ∆Oilt-i +

where: (i) c and ε is the intercept and the error term respectively, (ii) short-run terms are denoted
by ∆, whereas the long-run terms are indicated with δ-terms, (iii) is the maximum number of
lags (four in our case), (iv) the error correction term is denoted by ECT (θ should be negative
and significant in order to validate the long-run relationship).

The optimal number of lags is selected based on the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC).
The existence of a long-run relationship is validated using a F-statistic, where the null

The WHO reports released at date “t” contains information and figures about COVID-19 reported by countries
at the end of day “t-1”. The press usually announces new numbers, significantly higher at date “t”, which are
recorded by WHO reports at date “t+1”. Therefore, in our estimation we consider the impact of COVID-19 data
reported at “t+1” on the oil price recorded at date “t”. At the same time, the EPU index is daily updated, and might
impact the oil prices with a small delay. Therefore, EPU t-1 is considered in our general equation.

hypothesis of no cointegration is δOil =δCOVID-19 =δVIX =δEPU =0.7 We perform a series of postestimation tests to check for the residual serial correlation (Breusch-Godfrey LM test)8, the
presence of ARCH effects (Engle ARCH-LM test), and normality (Jarque-Bera test).

3. Empirical results

In the first step we check for the existence of a long-run relationship, applying the bound
tests which assume a lower bound for I(0) series, and an upper bound for I(1) series, the critical
values being derived from Narayan (2005). The F-statistic indicates a cointegrating relationship
if the values are higher than the critical value of the upper bound. For the first two models
referring to the new infection cases daily reported at global level and in China, we notice the
existence of a long-run relationship between oil prices, coronavirus numbers, financial volatility
and the US economic uncertainty (Table 3). However, the situation outside China can only have
a short-run effect on crude oil prices.

In the second step, we estimate the three ARDL models (Table 4). For Model 1, covering
the overall situation, a negative long-run connection between oil prices, coronavirus numbers,
financial volatility and US economic policy uncertainty is noticed. The negative effect is
stronger for the VIX, whereas COVID-19 has only a marginal effect on WTI. A similar situation
is recorded in the short run, except for the influence of US EPU, which becomes insignificant.
Model 2 evidences similar findings in the long run, result which is not surprising given
that in January – February 2020, the new cases of infection are dominated by those reported in
China. The results shows that an increase of 100% in the number of new infections reported,
lead to a decrease of oil price of 0.1%. For Model 3, there is no significant long-run relationship
between our variables. However, in the short run, it appears that the effect of COVID-19 on oil

prices is more important as compared to those reported in China. These results can be easily
explained by the reaction of commodity and financial markets to the COVID-19 spread in
Europe and the US.

The robustness results considering the BRENT prices confirm our initial findings.
However, the bound tests shows that the existence of a cointegration relationship is documented

whereas the effect is not significant for the cases reported outside China. The short-run equation
reveals mixed findings.

All in all, we notice that even if the direct negative impact of COVID-19 new infection
cases on crude oil prices is rather limited, the indirect effect manifested through the volatility
of financial markets cannot be neglected. Given the speed of propagation of this pandemic virus,
if the world governments are not proactive, promptly implementing the required measures to
isolate the suspected cases of COVID-19, the global economy risk to be paralyzed in few weeks.

5. Conclusions

The new coronavirus has generated noteworthy shock waves on financial markets, but
also on commodity prices, including oil. Oil prices recorded the hardest cut after 1991, which
10

help, for the moment, the economy of oil-importing countries severely affected by the
coronavirus crisis. However, the crash of oil prices clearly shows that an economic downturn
cannot be avoided.
In this context, the purpose of our paper was to see how the COVID-19 numbers, in terms
of daily announcements of new infection cases, influenced the international oil prices. Our
ARDL estimation documented a negative and significant impact of the coronavirus crisis, but
relatively small as compared to the effect of financial volatility and economic policy uncertainty
on oil prices. The COVID-19 impact on oil prices seems to be rather indirect, affecting first the
financial markets volatility (Albulescu, 2020).
Even if the figures reported outside China seem to have, for the moment, no significant
effect on oil prices in the long run, the exponential increase of new infection cases risks to block
the world economy and to freeze oil prices at a low level for a long period. The amplitude of
the economic contraction will be correlated with the coronavirus persistence. Although China
seems to gain the fight against COVID-19, the virus exponentially propagates in Europe and
the US. Consequently, a strong coordinated worldwide reaction is required, including economic
measures to prevent a severe economic downturn. Central banks have already started to cut the
interest rates, but this measure should be followed by appropriated fiscal facilities.
