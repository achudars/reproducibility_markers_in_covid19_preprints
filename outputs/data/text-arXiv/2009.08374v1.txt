Abstract
As scientists worldwide search for answers to the overwhelmingly unknown behind the deadly
pandemic, the literature concerning COVID-19 has been growing exponentially. Keeping abreast
of the body of literature at such a rapidly advancing pace poses significant challenges not only to
active researchers but also to the society as a whole. Although numerous data resources have
been made openly available, the analytic and synthetic process that is essential in effectively
navigating through the vast amount of information with heightened levels of uncertainty remains
a significant bottleneck. We introduce a generic method that facilitates the data collection and
sense-making process when dealing with a rapidly growing landscape of a research domain such
as COVID-19 at multiple levels of granularity. The method integrates the analysis of structural
and temporal patterns in scholarly publications with the delineation of thematic concentrations
and the types of uncertainties that may offer additional insights into the complexity of the
unknown. We demonstrate the application of the method in a study of the COVID-19 literature.
Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted so many people’s everyday life worldwide and it is still
threatening our society as a whole. The COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented in several ways
that make it particularly challenging and threatening: it is still largely unknown of its origin and
transmission routes; there may be months or even longer before COVID-19 vaccines can be
expected to be a powerful line of defense; the prolonged pandemic continues to pose social,
economic, and political challenges to businesses and entire industries such as airlines and
international travels as well as schools and many other areas.
Scientists and researchers have actively responded to the urgency and severity of the pandemic.
Publications relevant to COVID-19 have increased rapidly across disciplines since the beginning
of the year 2020. Several institutions and corporate organizations have contributed openly
accessible datasets of COVID-19 publications, notably including the CORD-19 dataset and the
Lens.
The CORD-19 dataset, the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset, covers the scholarly literature of
COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and the coronavirus group1. Its initial release contained over 29,000
articles, over 13,000 of which contained full text. The CORD-19 dataset has been updated
regularly. By the beginning of September 2020, the CORD-19 dataset reached 130,000 articles.
It has been studied by many researchers, especially from communities that are well-equipped to

1

analyze and model text documents, including data science and AI for example. A scientometric
researcher, however, may find the CORD-19 dataset and other similar datasets inadequate, for
example, due to the lack of cited references as part of the dataset, missing elements such as
abstracts, or other data coverage or quality issues.
Several widely used analytic methods in the field of scientometrics rely on citations in scholarly
publications to derive indicators and metrics of underlying research and its impact, for example,
including the h-index and the g-index. Eugene Garfield pioneered the notion of Science Citation
Index in the 1950s, which subsequently formed the basis for citation analysis and quantitative
studies of science in general (Garfield 1955). Typically, authors of a scholarly publication refer
to, i.e. cite, previously published works in their narratives. There are many studies of how and
why authors ought to cite their references appropriately and how and why they often failed to do
so (Greenberg 2009). The Web of Science, Scopus, Dimensions, the Lens, and Microsoft
Academic (MA) are among the most widely used multi-disciplinary bibliographic databases
(Visser, Eck et al. 2020), although they differ considerably in terms of the breadth and depth of
their coverage, data quality, and accessibility. Document Co-Citation Analysis (DCA) (Small
1973) and Author Co-Citation Analysis (ACA) (White and McCain 1998) are network-based
analytic methods for studying scientific literature. Networks in such studies are constructed
based on co-occurrences of a pair of entities such as cited references or cited authors. The
resultant networks then lend themselves to a wide variety of network analysis, modeling, and
visualization techniques. Although networks can be derived from co-occurrences of words and
phrases in text, references may play valuable roles at a higher level of abstraction, especially in
what is known as concept symbols (Small 1978, Small 1986). A major advantage of
bibliographic databases such as the Web of Science and Scopus is the provision of references
cited by a scholarly publication. These databases are conveniently used by researchers to conduct
citation analysis and other citation-based studies. In contrast, PubMed, a well-known resource of
the literature of biomedicine, does not provide references of an article as part of its metadata.
CORD-19 provides a similar depth of coverage as PubMed, i.e. the references cited by an article
are not readily available from the dataset, which prevent researchers from conducting citationbased network analyses.
Microsoft Academic (MA) is a major source behind the construction and dissemination of
CORD-19. Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) organizes entities and relations of scholarly
publications as a graph and allows flexible ways to retrieve bibliographic data, including
references cited by an article (Wang, Shen et al. 2019). Furthermore, instances of a citation of a
reference, often known as citances (Nakov, Schwartz et al. 2004), are also retrievable from MAG
in terms of citation contexts. Citation contexts of a reference consist of sentences in which the
reference is cited along with surrounding sentences to provide a meaningful context.
In the rest of the article, we will introduce a generic and reproducible method based on MA for
visual analytic studies of the COVID-19 literature. In fact, the method is applicable to the
literature of other topics. This method contributes to the study of a research field as follows: 1)
enable anyone who is interested to construct their own CORD-19-like dataset with an enriched
inclusion of cited references and citation contexts; 2) eliminate the barrier to conduct
scientometric studies with the citation enriched data; 3) expand the current visual analytic studies
of research literature further with the inclusion of citation contexts and enhance network-based
analyses with deeper insights identified at a finer level of granularity; 4) enable analysts to
interactively exploring uncertainties associated with the citations of a reference; and 5) conduct
these analyses in an integrated visual analytic environment – an enhanced implementation of a

widely used science mapping tool – CiteSpace (Chen 2004, Chen 2006, Chen, Ibekwe‐SanJuan
et al. 2010, Chen 2017).
CiteSpace
CiteSpace is designed for conducting a visual analytic study of the scholarly literature of a
research field, a research area, or a discipline, collectively known as a knowledge domain (Chen
2004, Chen 2006). CiteSpace constructs a series of networks of underlying entities and their
relations derived from a representative dataset of the corresponding knowledge domain.
Structural patterns and trends are combined with temporal patterns and indicators to inform
analysts significant developments of a research field in question. A typical workflow divides a
synthesized network into distinct clusters of entities such as cited references. The analyst would
focus on the meaning of individual clusters and their interrelationships so as to uncover critical
insights from high-levels of aggregation to lower levels. For example, applications of CiteSpace
typically aim to address the following questions:
 What are the major thematic concentrations in the field of research in terms of clusters of
co-occurring references?
 How are neighboring clusters connected? Which articles serve as bridges between
distinct clusters?
 Which articles are the most representative members of a particular cluster?
 What would be the most accurate word or phrase to sum up the role of a cluster?
Technically, CiteSpace decomposes a network into distinct clusters. Each cluster consists of a set
of references that are frequently cited together by the same citing articles. In other words, the
member references of a cluster are more often cited within the same article than references from
different cluster. The quality of the decomposition is measured in terms of network modularity,
the silhouette score of each cluster, and a cluster-size weighted silhouette mean. The closer these
values are to 1.0, then higher the overall clarity of the configuration.
Conceptually, the position of a reference in the underlying network representation can be used to
guide our navigation. According to the Structural Hole Theory (Burt 2004), nodes located at
structural holes tend to be associated with creativity, originality, and boundary-spanning. In
CiteSpace, structural holes are highlighted as nodes with high betweenness centrality scores.
Landmarks provide useful guidance for navigation. Highly cited articles are depicted as large
tree-rings of citations per year. Articles with sharp increases in citations they received experience
citation bursts, which indicate their particularly noteworthiness because of their extraordinary
attraction of attention.
CiteSpace supports Structural Variation Analysis (SVA), which is a predictive analytic process
that can be used to identify newly published articles with transformative potentials (Chen 2012).
Transformative potentials are measured in terms of significant structural variations induced by
newly published articles. At a given time, a newly published article contributes to the literature
by connecting previously disjoint bodies of thematic concentrations. Such connections may lead
to transformative changes to the underlying knowledge structure. Transformative changes are
realized if the research community follows and consolidates the promising paths forged by the
innovative connections. On the other hand, not all such connections lead to changes that are
responded by the research community, thus they are considered as the potential at the point of
recognition other than as actual transformative changes.
The role of uncertainties in representing scientific knowledge is proposed in our recent work to
capture the state of the art of a research field as well as to explain what drives the dynamics of

underlying research activities (Chen and Song 2017, Chen, Song et al. 2018). We proposed a
framework of uncertainties with three major types of uncertainties that are measurable at the
linguistic level, namely, epistemic uncertainty (E), hedging (H), and transitional (T). Epistemic
uncertainty is measured based on the presence of uncertainty cue words that indicate the
unknown, incomplete, controversial, and contradictory aspects of a topic. Hedging is measured
in terms of hedging words such as may, suggest, and imply. Hedging words are essential
linguistic devices to render the certainty or, rather the uncertainty, of a statement more
appropriately. Recently, there is a growing interest in the connection between hedging and
citations (Small 2018, Small, Boyack et al. 2019). Transitional uncertainties are measured by the
presence of transitional words such as however and nonetheless, which often signify a change in
an argument or the possibility of multiple alternative interpretations of a situation. These
uncertainties are measured in terms of information entropy. Using information entropy has
several advantages over other metrics. First, information entropy has been widely used to
represent uncertainties. Second, measuring uncertainties at different levels of aggregation
follows naturally with information entropy. For example, the uncertainty associated with an
article can be defined as the sum of all the uncertainties associated with the text passages of the
article, such as its citation contexts. Similarly, the uncertainty of a cluster of cited references is
naturally the sum of the uncertainties of all its member references.
Currently, citation contexts are not available from the most commonly used bibliographic
databases, such as the Web of Science, Scopus, Dimensions, and the Lens, except Microsoft
Academic Services (MAS)(Sinha, Shen et al. 2015, Wang, Shen et al. 2019).
Microsoft Academic Services
Microsoft Academic Services (MAS) provides two ways to access the Microsoft Academic
Graph (MAG): through API to access the MAG hosted by MAS or maintain a copy of MAG of
your own. The potential and limitations of Microsoft Academic (MA) for citation analysis have
been studied and compared with other commonly used resources (Hug and Brandle 2017, Hug,
Ochsner et al. 2017, Thelwall 2017, Thelwall 2018, Visser, Eck et al. 2020). More recent reviews
of MAS are presented in (Wang, Shen et al. 2019). An interesting study of the core concepts of
classic philosophical books made a good use of the MAG (Bornmann, Wray et al. 2020).
Each article in MAG has a MAG ID, for example, 2160441315 for (Chen 2004) and 2150999626
for (Chen 2006). One may retrieve publications from MAG based on their MAG IDs, DOIs, and
fields of study. It is also possible to retrieve articles that cite a set of references in their MAG IDs,
thus this function enables us to enrich an article’s metadata with its references. For each returned
article, citation contexts provide a unique advantage of MAS over other major bibliographic
databases. The integration of visual analytics of citation contexts with other citation-based
analytic processes is a significant contribution of our new method.
To demonstrate the application of the integrated and enhanced method, we focus on the COVID19 literature. Instead of using the currently available CORD-19 dataset due to its lack of cited
references, we construct a dataset of the COVID-19 literature directly from MAS. A major
advantage of this approach is its flexibility and extensibility. Anyone who is interested would be
able to perform the construction with the new version of CiteSpace on a subject of their own
interest. In particular, it is possible to further extend CiteSpace to support Cascading Citation
Expansion (Chen and Song 2019), which is so far only feasible in CiteSpace with Dimensions’
API. At the time of writing, the Lens API currently does not support retrieving citing articles of a

given reference, although the Lens ScholarlyWorks API is very powerful in other aspects and it
is supported in CiteSpace.
We constructed the MA-based COVID-19 dataset based on fields of study. The following query
means a qualified record should match with at least one of the fields of study.
expr=Or
(Composite(F.FN=='coronavirus disease 2019'),
Composite(F.FN=='severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2'),
Composite(F.FN=='2019 20 coronavirus outbreak'),
Composite(F.FN=='covid-19'),
Composite(F.FN=='covid19')
)
The dataset constructed on September 5, 2020 contains a total of 79,476 records and 7,693 of
them have corresponding citation contexts. This dataset represents a snapshot of the COVID-19
literature published in the first eight months of 2020 on MAG. 77,897 records have been cited at
least once. These records are stored in a format that is a superset of the Web of Science fielddelimited data format. The citation contexts are stored in a separate file to maximize the
interoperability. The integrated analytic functions involving citation contexts use a database on a
local host. Users who do not install such databases can still use CiteSpace to process the dataset
retrieved from MAS as if they were from the Web of Science.
The MAS-enriched COVID-19 dataset can be studied at three levels. First, the dataset contains
cited references the same way as bibliographic records of the Web of Science origin. All the
visual analytic functions in CiteSpace that can be applied to the Web of Science data now can be
applied to the MAS-enriched dataset. We will illustrate a visualization of the co-citation network
with monthly time-sliced intervals and an overview of its major thematic concentrations (i.e.
clusters of co-cited references). Second, the integrative analysis of citation contexts along with
Level-1 analyses, which are visual analytic tasks typically used with tools such as CiteSpace.
Citation contexts serve the source of information from which three types of uncertainties are
measured. One reference can be cited by the same citing article in multiple citation contexts as
well as by multiple citing articles in an even larger number of citation contexts (Ding, Liu et al.
2013, Hu, Chen et al. 2013). Making sense of key themes in the potentially diverse and extensive
narratives is a time consuming and cognitively demanding task. Uncertainty scores provide an
extra layer of organizing the information and highlight information that is potentially valuable to
the sense-making process. Finally, at the third level, we demonstrate the application of the SVA
procedure to the dataset and identify a set of newly published articles that are too young to
standout in terms of their citation counts but start to show signs of transformative potential.
Data
To demonstrate the method, we constructed a dataset of the COVID-19 literature from the MAG
based on matching fields of study. The resultant dataset contains publications as earlier as 2014.
Interestingly, the dataset also contains publications from the future, all the way from next month
to next year. Table 1 summarizes the dataset. Our subsequent discussions will focus on the
subset of the first eight months in 2020.

Table 2 lists the number of articles found on major bibliographic databases on September 5, 2020
with the identical or closely matched queries to the query used for this study. For example, the
following query was used to search in the titles only in Dimensions DSL. For full text search,
replace the scope title_only with full_data.
search publications in title_only for "\"coronavirus disease 2019\" OR
\"severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\" OR \"2019 20
coronavirus outbreak\" OR \"covid-19\" OR covid19" return publications

A search on Google Scholar used the following query:

'coronavirus disease 2019' OR 'severe
coronavirus 2' OR '2019 20 coronavirus
'covid19'

acute respiratory syndrome

The search on MAG used the following query:

Composite(F.FN=='severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2'),
Composite(F.FN=='2019

Composite(F.FN=='covid-19'), Composite(F.FN=='covid19'))

The CORD-19 dataset is the most comprehensive one with 130,000 articles. Full text searches on
Dimensions and the Lens returned over 100,000 articles. Searches in the metadata alone of
course returned fewer articles than full text searches. We used fields of study to construct our
demonstrative dataset to reduce the complexity of the query formation. More sophisticated
strategies such as Cascading Citation Expansion can be used to optimize the overall quality of
the data collection step (Chen and Song 2019). A topic search in the Web of Science returned the
lowest number of articles in this group. In terms of the percentage of the CORD-19 dataset, the

Web of Science represents about 23% of its volume, MAG over 62%, and full text searchers on
Dimensions and Lens over 75%.

Overview
The first question regarding the literature of a topic that is full of uncertainty is: what are the
major components of the COVID-19 literature? What aspects of the subject are predominant in
the first eight months of the pandemic?
Figure 1 shows an overview of the underlying network of references that are often cited together.
The nodes are references cited by citing articles, which are records from the dataset retrieved
from MAG, whereas links between them represent the strengths of their co-occurrences.
Groupings of references, i.e. clusters, emerge as some references are co-cited more often than
others. These clusters represent concentrations of themes, although their degrees of concentration
may vary widely across different clusters. Each cluster is assigned an automatically generated
cluster label, for example, #3 spike protein and #5 pregnant women. Clusters are numbered from
#0 onwards. Clusters are depicted in different colors, starting with the red for the largest cluster
#0 and follow the rainbow colormap. We are of course aware that the rainbow colormap may be
harmful if used inappropriately but in this case as long as we can differentiate one cluster from
another, it would be sufficient.
The largest cluster #0 wuhan china is shown in red near the center of the network. The second
largest cluster #1 renin angiotensin aldosterone system is located near the top. Clusters #2
systematic review meta analysis, #3 spike protein, #5 pregnant women can be found on the left.
On the right half of the graph, there are clusters #4 dental practice, #6 chest [CT], and #12
mental health.
The configuration of the parameters for this network is shown in the upper left corner. Users may
adjust them accordingly. The provision of citation contexts provides another option to enhance

the conventional Document Co-Citation Analysis (DCA), which typically treats each reference
with an equal weight for a citing article because no further data beyond the reference list is
available. In this study, we utilize the additional information accessible from the corresponding
citation contexts such that references frequently cited in the article can be retained, whereas
references cited below average can be discarded. Users may control this option.

Figure 1. An overview of 1,330 top-cited articles in the COVID-19 literature of 77,897 articles.

Concept Trees
The MAG-based COVID-19 dataset contains 111,360 citation contexts made by 7,693 citing
articles, involving 39,995 references. Although this represents only 9.88% of the 77,897 citing
articles that have at least one citation in the dataset, the available citation contexts provide
enough information for us to assess the feasibility of the integrative approach.
The overview in Figure 1 gives us some general idea about the most active areas of the literature.
To understand what each cluster involves, one option is to characterize the thematic structure of
the cluster in a hierarchical representation of its component concepts (Palla, Tibely et al. 2015,
Balogh, Zagyva et al. 2019). Figure 2 shows a concept tree of Cluster #5 pregnant women. The
nodes of the tree are concepts, which are noun phrases extracted from citation contexts of the
member references in this cluster. Major branches of the tree highlight the key themes or
concerns of the cluster. For example, vertical transmission is shown as the root of the tree, which
is the primary concern of this cluster. Users may interactively inspect the citation contexts of
each concept, as shown in the right window in Figure 2. The citing paper’s MAG ID is shown as
a hyperlink. Following the hyperlink will take the users to the record displayed on the Microsoft
Academic website.

Figure 2. Making sense of a cluster (#5 pregnant women). The list of citation contexts shown in the left window corresponds to
the currently mouse-over event on the concept of vertical transmission.

Concept trees can be used to highlight the structure of a cluster, a reference, or a word or a
phrase. Figure 3, for example, is generated from a single reference that has the highest epistemic
uncertainty score. The concept tree reveals that incubation period and mean incubation period are
major themes emerged from citation contexts made by subsequently published articles.
Interactive inspections of the concept of mean incubation period reveal specific days mentioned
in various citation contexts shown in the left window. For example, the mean incubation period
of 5.2 days appears frequently in these contexts. This function can facilitate traditional
systematic reviews and meta analyses as one can efficiently collect values of a specific variable
from a large number of publications.

Figure 3. Making sense of major themes of citations to a specific reference (Li, Q., 2020).

Uncertainties
Each citation context consists of a few sentences in which a particular reference is cited by a
citing article. The uncertainties of these sentences can be measured in terms of the presence of
uncertainty cue words and how often these cue words appear in a global bibliographic database
such as the entire collections of over 200 million articles on Dimensions. Semantically
equivalent cue words are learned from initially hand-picked cue words as seeds (Chen, Song et al.
2018). Epistemic uncertainties are designed to capture uncertainties in our knowledge, which can
be manifested by the appearance of cue words such as controversial, contradictory, inconsistent,
unknown, and uncertain.
While the uncertainties of citation contexts can be identified independent of the underlying topic
as shown in the above example, a more valuable option is the combine the level of uncertainty
with specific rhetorical cues or specific concepts. For example, we may want to see how
epistemic uncertainties are associated with concrete concepts such as social distancing, face
masks, and international travels. As shown in Table 3, a combination of epistemic uncertainty
cues and rhetorical words on conclusions reveals additional insights into the challenges we are
facing.

are highlighted in yellow, whereas rhetorical words are highlighted in green.

rly complex and counter-intuitive due to the uncertainty in the transmission
mechanisms, possible seasonal variation in both susceptibility and
transmission, and their variation within subpopulations[7]. The media has
given extensive coverage to analyses and forecasts using COVID-19
models, with increased attention to cases of conflicting conclusions, giving
the impression that epidemiological models
[35] conclude that not only the COVID-19 numbers will grow but also
uncertainty about forecasts will also grow.
(14) Finally, a recent systematic review of the literature concluded that
while further research on this topic was required, the limited data available,
albeit not adjusted for other factors potentially impacting on outcome,
concluded that smoking was most likely associated with negative
progression and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2,(15) while a second metaanalysis concluded that active smoking was not associated with severity of
SARS-CoV-2.(16) Nevertheless, despite this current uncertainty many
organisations, such as the World Health Organization and the National
Institute of Drug Abuse, recommend smoking cessation strategies not only
to alleviate the harm caused by smoking, in general, but also because
smoking cessation may potentially lessen the risks of SARS-CoV-2
infection.
It can be concluded that the results of previous studies on the immune
system have been inconsistent.
21 The conflicting conclusions from our two scenarios, driven largely by
the differences in the extent of presymptomatic transmission, highlight the
urgent need for more data to clarify key epidemiological parameters of
COVID-19, particularly the serial interval and the extent of presymptomatic
transmission, in order to inform response efforts.
Moreover, the contradictory findings about smoking in the literature, with

studies published before the COVID-19 pandemic reporting that smoking
and nicotine down-regulate ACE2 [3, 4] and other studies published during
the pandemic reporting that they up-regulate ACE2 [5] [6] [7] , do not
allow for solid conclusions regarding the effects of nicotine or smoking on
ACE2.
Compared with the results of the two studies on Wuhan cases by Chen et al
18 and Huang et al 19 , we found that the gender proportion was equal in
the 80 patients we included, contradicting to the conclusion that men were
more susceptible than women.

Figure 4 shows a screenshot of the Node Details window in CiteSpace for the article (Li, Guan et
al. 2020), which has the largest epistemic uncertainty score in the dataset. The screenshot shows
a list of citation contexts of the reference in chronological order. The length of an orange bar
depicts the epistemic uncertainty score (E). Major uncertainty cue words contributing to the
uncertainty score are highlighted in red, including unknown, uncertainty, and controversial. The
visual representation reduces the cognitive burdens for us to manually sift through numerous
citation contexts across different articles. It makes it easier for us to concentrate on the key
information. We can quickly scan citation contexts and focus on ones with high uncertainty
scores. It is out belief that uncertainties can provide valuable insights into the heart of research
(Chen and Song 2017).

the hierarchical representation of the concepts co-occurring with the words vaccine or

contexts.

The examples shown above illustrate the application of the method on datasets retrieved from
MAG. The following examples demonstrate Structural Variation Analysis (SVA), which is a
predictive analytic method to identify newly published articles with transformative potentials
(Chen 2012). In other words, SVA aims to identify new articles that may have profound impacts
on the underlying literature in the future.
Structural Variation Analysis (SVA)
The structural variation analysis is built on the basis of Structural Hole Theory, which was
originally proposed for social networks (Burt 2004, Chen 2012). According to the Structural
Hole Theory, people’s positions in their social network or a network of their co-workers may be
associated with social capitals, which may be in turn translated into competitive edge.
Furthermore, positions that play a significant role in connecting different parts of the network
tend to have a greater potential than other positions. From an information flow point of view,
individuals who are in such positions are exposed to different ideas, perspectives, and opinions,
which make them more open-minded and creative. We extended this insight to networks of
scholarly publications. References located at such positions, i.e. connections are limited or
completely missing, have the potential to make a profound impact on the global structure of the
underlying research field. The SVA procedure looks for newly added connections that may alter
the global structure or have the potential to do so. In essence, each newly published article is
compared against a baseline network formed by the literature up to the publication of the article
in question. Co-occurring links made by the article are examined in the baseline network to

determine whether a specific link is novel between clusters or incremental within clusters or
anything else in between. Transformative potential scores are given to articles that make novel
links between distinct clusters.
Figure 6 shows the overview of the network we will work with for SVA. The current
implementation of SVA is computationally expensive; therefore, we used a smaller network than
the one we showed earlier for the demonstration. The overview shows a similar set of clusters
with slight shifts of focus. The largest cluster is #0 spike protein. The second largest one is #1
transmission route. The three articles labeled in black background are the three articles with the
highest epistemic uncertainty scores, including the article (Li, Guan et al. 2020), which we have
seen earlier in the study.

Figure 6.An overview of a smaller network to illustrate SVA. The size of a disc in red depicts the epistemic uncertainty (E). The
largest three discs are labeled in black background.

Figure 7 shows the same set of clusters in a more separated arrangement. The separation reveals
that the largest cluster #0 spike protein contains the most nodes with significant levels of
epistemic uncertainty. One of the three most ‘uncertain’ nodes, (Li, Guan et al. 2020), is in this

cluster, whereas the other two belong to cluster #2 meta analysis. In contrast, the overall
uncertainty of cluster #6 is very low. The distribution of epistemic uncertainty at the cluster level
requires further investigation. One possible direction would be along the hypothesis that a high
epistemic uncertainty indicates a sophisticated level of articulation in scholarly communication.
Another possible direction would be that a high concentration of epistemic uncertainty articles
may indicate the origin of a field of research when researchers conceptualize the fundamental
research needs.

Figure 7.The distribution of citation contexts with uncertainties is uneven. The most of uncertainties are in clusters 0, 2, and 5.

Figure 8 shows an overlay of cluster #0 spike protein over the overall network. Such overlays
highlight the scope of a cluster and inter-cluster relations. The visualization also suggests that the
majority of the epistemic uncertainty appear to concentrate on the central area of the network.

Figure 8. References associated with the strongest sentiment of uncertainty are from Cluster #0 spike protein.

Figure 9 shows a newly published article identified with a high transformative potential based on
the centrality divergence metric, one of the three structural variation metrics. The article is also
ranked high on another metric – modularity change. The visualization reveals the distribution of
the references cited by the article in different clusters. The next question is why these references
from different areas are cited by the same citing article.

The review article (Fang and Meng 2020) was published in June 2020. Its citation contexts are
not found on MAG at the time of writing. We manually located the citation contexts from the
original publication. Table 4 shows the citation contexts of four of the references cited by (Fang
and Meng 2020). Each of the references is cited in different sections on distinct topics, which
partially explains the diverse footprint found by SVA.

A practical question in constructing a systematic review of a subject is that given the current
landscape of its literature, where are the promising areas to watch for future growth? Where can
one expect the next breakthrough? In the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, monitoring the
spread of the virus and the development of new vaccines are among the top of such a list. About
10% of the records in the MAG-based COVID-19 dataset have corresponding citation contexts
available. Nearly 15% of them contained the words vaccine or vaccination. SVA enables
researchers to watch activities in valleys between hills on the current literature landscape, i.e.
innovative connections that link thematic islands. The literature-based discovery community
pioneered by Don Swanson has been devoted it to uncover this type of connections that are
missing or weak in the current literature (Chen and Song 2019).
Table 5 shows a list of articles identified with the strongest transformative potentials in terms of
modularity change, which is essentially consistent with the citation-based ranking, suggesting
that the validity of the list can be further verified in the near future when their citation contexts
become available. Most of the articles on the list are published in June 2020, slightly over two
months ago. The second one on the list has already been cited 19 times. It shows how fast the
COVID-19 literature is growing as well as a promising visibility of this article. The title of the
article is “COVID-19: From epidemiology to treatment.” Interested readers may revisit this list
regularly in the next few months and monitor whether their transformative potential is
strengthened and realized or diminished and forgotten.

Discussion
The illustrative examples demonstrate the advantages and further potentials of integrating MAG
for the study of a rapidly growing body of literature over a monthly time scale, comparing to a
much longer time period typically used in contemporary scientometric studies. Our experience
shows that it is feasible for end users to construct their own datasets at a pace of their own choice.
More importantly, this method opens a wide range of possibilities for researchers to compare
different bibliographic databases. Such possibilities until recently have been limited to the few
due to the resource-demanding nature (Chen and Song 2019, Visser, Eck et al. 2020).
At the basic level, we have demonstrated that end users would be able to conduct scientometric
studies using commonly used methods such as DCA in the same way as they would with datasets
from the long established but relatively more selective sources such as the Web of Science. At
the same time, an equivalent topic search in the Web of Science returned 29,858 records,
whereas CORD-19 has reached 130,000 records. MAG is in the same category as the Lens and
Dimensions within the range of 70,000~90,000 records.
At the next level, integrating citation contexts with the visual analytic workflow significantly
extends the depth of scientometric studies. The ability to cross-reference between structural
indicators and linguistic cues of uncertainties has a great potential to enrich the sense-making
process when facing a rapidly growing body of the literature. The integrated method enables
analysts to visually inspect all the instances in which the mean incubation period are discussed
with reference to a particular study. The interactive visualization considerably reduces the
overhead and cognitive load. Such improvements are promising examples of integrating
network-based visualization and analytic approaches with text-based visual exploration guided
by different types of uncertainty metrics.
At the third level, our examples have demonstrated that the integrated approach can further push
the envelope of scientometric studies and the provision of citation contexts opens up valuable
opportunities for researchers to monitor and track articles identified with transformative
potentials. It is also conceivable how one may extend studies along the direction demonstrated in
(Bornmann, Wray et al. 2020), which resembles closed search when researchers identify

concepts they would like to trace as opposed to open-ended search when researchers would
welcome concepts identified by computational models and/or interactive visual exploration.
MAG has its limitations. The most noticeable one is the relatively low rate of records with
citation contexts at the time of writing. We found about 10% of the records in the dataset have
citation contexts. We tested the distribution of the records with citation contexts by overlaying
the network of records with citation contexts on the network of all records. The result is assuring
– the records with citation contexts seem to be located in the core of the larger network, whereas
the missing ones tend to be located at the peripherals of the network. Even with the current level
of the available citation contexts, we are able to reveal answers to some of the specific questions
such as the consensus on the mean incubation period in the literature. Encouraged by the recent
review of MAS (Wang, Shen et al. 2019), we believe MAS will continue to improve and the
overall quality of MAG as a data source will steadily increase. The current MAS allows free API
access to the MAG with a minor compromise in terms of the limit of API calls per minute and
the total calls per month. MAS provides an alternative for users to host their own copy of MAG
so that these restrictions can be eliminated. This is another reason why we consider MAG as a
promising component to integrate in the workflow of visual analytic studies of the literature.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we have introduced a visual analytic method that can overcome a few significant
shortcomings in the practice of conducting scientometric studies of the literature. The method
provides a flexible and extensible approach that allows researchers to tailor the breadth and the
depth of a dataset to meet their own requirements. Researchers are enabled to apply existing
tools to such self-constructed datasets on topics of their interest at a pace of their own choice.
The easy access to citation contexts provides valuable contributions to the workflow of visual
analytic studies of the literature. Integrating citation contexts with network-centric analytic
paradigms may serve as a stepping stone to a fully integrated workflow for the study of scientific
literature at all levels of details as well as insightful patterns and trends.
