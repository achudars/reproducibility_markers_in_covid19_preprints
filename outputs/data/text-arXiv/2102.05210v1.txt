Background and Objective: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused great casualties and
becomes almost the most urgent public health events worldwide. Computed tomography (CT) is a
significant screening tool for COVID-19 infection, and automated segmentation of lung infection in
COVID-19 CT images will greatly assist diagnosis and health care of patients. However, accurate
and automatic segmentation of COVID-19 lung infections remains to be challenging. In this paper we
propose a dilated dual attention U-Net (D2A U-Net) for COVID-19 lesion segmentation in CT slices
based on dilated convolution and a novel dual attention mechanism to address the issues above.
Methods: We introduce a dilated convolution module in model decoder to achieve large receptive
field, which refines decoding process and contributes to segmentation accuracy. Also, we present a
dual attention mechanism composed of two attention modules which are inserted to skip connection
and model decoder respectively. The dual attention mechanism is utilized to refine feature maps and
reduce semantic gap between different levels of the model.
Results: The proposed method has been evaluated on open-source dataset and outperforms cuttingedges methods in semantic segmentation. Our proposed D2A U-Net with pretrained encoder achieves
a Dice score of 0.7298 and recall score of 0.7071. Besides, we also build a simplified D2A U-Net
without pretrained encoder to provide a fair comparison with other models trained from scratch, which
still outperforms popular U-Net family models with a Dice score of 0.7047 and recall score of 0.6626.
Conclusion: Our experiment results have shown that by introducing dilated convolution and dual
attention mechanism, the number of false positives is significantly reduced, which improves sensitivity
to COVID-19 lesions and subsequently brings significant increase to Dice score. Significance: Our
proposed method improves segmentation performance on COVID-19 lesions in CT slices, and can be
regarded as a potential AI-based approach utilized in diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 patients.

1. Introduction
COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-nCov-2 continues to spread all over the world [24], and most of the countries have been affected in this unprecedented public health
event. By August 2020, more than 23.75 million of cases of
COVID-19 have been reported and more than 810,000 died
[2] of COVID-19 infection. Due to the strong infectivity of
SARS-nCov-2, identification of people infected by COVID19 is significant to cut off the transmission and slow down
virus spread. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is considered as the gold standard of diagnosis [29] for its high specificity, but it is time-consuming and
laborious. Also, the capacity of RT-PCR tests can be rather
insufficient in less-developed regions, especially during the
pandemic. Computed tomography (CT) imaging is one of
the most commonly used screening methods to detect lung
infection and has proved to be efficient in the diagnosis and
follow-up prognosis of COVID-19.
Compared with chest X-ray images, CT imaging is more
sensitive, especially in the early stage of infection. Ground
glass pattern is the most common finding in COVID-19 infections, usually in the early stage, while pulmonary consol∗ Corresponding

idation can be observed in the later stage. Pleural effusion
can also be observed in pathological CT slices. These typical features of COVID-19 lung infection are shown in Fig.

Thus, chest CT imaging is regarded as a convenient, fast
and accurate approach to diagnose COVID-19. The evaluation of localization and geometric features of infection area
could provide adequate information of disease progress and

help doctors make better treatment [10] [16] [19]. However,
manual annotation of infection regions is a time-consuming
and laborious work. Also, the annotation made by radiologists can be subjective and biased due to individual experience and personal judgements.
Recently, a number of deep learning systems using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been proposed to
detect COVID-19 infection. For instance, Wang and Wong
[27] have developed a COVID-Net to perform ternary classification between healthy people, COVID-19 patients and
people infected with other pneumonia in chest X-ray images, which achieves an overall accuracy of 93.3 %. In terms
of deep learning systems for CT imaging, Zhou and Canu
[39] have proposed an automatic network facilitated with attention mechanism to segment infection area in CT slices.
Fan et. al [6] developed an Inf-Net and corresponding semisupervision algorithm to perform CT segmentation. Zheng
et al. [37] proposed a weakly-supervised deep learning method
to detect COVID-19 in CT volumes. Xi et al. [18] presented
a dual-sampling attention network to diagnose COVID-19
from community acquired pneumonia. However, detecting
lung infection caused by COVID-19 in CT images remains
to be challenging. As infection regions vary in shape, position and texture, and the boundaries with normal tissues can
be rather blurred, which add to the difficulty in COVID-19
detection and limit model performance, especially in terms
of recall score.
To address the issues above, we proposed a dilated dual
attention U-Net (D2A U-Net) framework to automatic segment lung infection in COVID-19 CT slices. Since infected
tissues can be hardly distinguishable with normal tissues, we
introduce a dual attention mechanism consisting of a gate
attention module (GAM) and a decoder attention module
(DAM) to refine feature maps and produce more informative feature representation. The proposed GAM is utilized
by fusing features and semantic-rich gate signals to refine
skip connections. The proposed DAM is introduced to the
decoder of the network to improve model decoding quality
and better segment blurred infected tissues. As COVID-19
infection varies in position and size, we utilize dilated convolution with different dilation rate in the model decoder to obtain larger receptive fields and balance the segmentation on
both large and tiny objects, which thus provides better segmentation results. Such refinement improves segmentation
recall score and thus provides better segmentation results.
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 offers a review of related works on CT segmentation. Section 3 describes the overview of this work and details our model. Section 4 presents the details of our experiments and provides
both quantitative and qualitative segmentation results. Section 5 discusses the proposed method and concludes our work.

2. Related Works
In this section, we will go through 4 types of most related works, which includes chest CT segmentation, attention mechanism, dilated convolution and AI-based COVIDFirst Author et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier

19 segmentation systems.

2.1. Chest CT Segmentation
Chest CT imaging is one of the most popular screening
methods for lung disease diagnosis[9]. Segmentation of organs and lesions provides crucial information for disease diagnosis and prognosis. However, manual segmentation remains time-consuming and laborious and subjective error
is inevitable, thus automatic CT segmentation gains much
popularity in the research fields. Recent researches upon
automatic segmentation mainly focus on utilizing machine
learning techniques. Related works most feature a pixel-wise
classifier to infer from extracted features to make predictions. For example, Mansoor et. al [13] proposed a texturebased feature classifier for pathological lung segmentation in
CT images. Yao et. al [34] utilized texture analysis and support vector machine to segment infections in lung tissues.
These algorithms have realized automatic segmentation in
chest CT images but several issues remain unsolved, including subjective bias in feature extraction and difficulties in
segmenting nodule regions. Deep learning algorithms feature powerful fitting capacity and require no laborious preprocessing. Most cutting-edge segmentation algorithms are
based on deep learning approaches. For example, Shaziya
et. al [23] used U-Net to segment lung tissues in chest CT
scans. Zhao et. al [36] proposed a fully convolutional neural
network with multi-instance and conditional adversary loss
for pathological lung segmentation.

2.2. Attention Mechanism
Attention plays an important role in human perception
and visual cognition [5]. One significant property in human
perception is that humans hardly process visual information
as a whole. Instead, humans usually process visual information recurrently, where top information is utilized to guide
bottom-up feedforward process [15]. Inspired by this principle, attention mechanism has been widely used in computer vision, especially in image classification [7] [31] [25].
Related algorithms typically refine feature maps in spatial
dimension, channel dimension or both. For example, Hu et
al. [7] introduced a Squeeze-and-Excitation module, where
global average pooling is performed on input features to produce channel-wise attention. Woo et. al [31] proposed a
convolutional block attention module (CBAM) to introduce
a fused attention consisting of channel attention and spatial
attention. Wang et al. [25] presented a residual attention
network, which contains an attention module featuring an
encoder-decoder architecture. Attention mechanism has also
been utilized in semantic segmentation tasks to make more
accurate dense predictions. For instance, Li et. al [11] proposed a Pyramid Attention Network to exploit the impact of
global contextual information in semantic segmentation.
These typical algorithms resemble in some aspects. Certain operations, such as global pooling, convolution and the
combination of downsampling and upsampling, are utilized
to enhance informative regions in the feature maps and suppress unrelated information, which makes the network learn

more generalized visual structures and improves robustness
to noisy inputs.

2.3. Dilated Convolution
Traditional deep convolutional networks often involve
convolution with stride or pooling operations to improve receptive fields, and input images are downsampled in this
process. However, these operations often lead to the loss
of global information in dense predictions, such as semantic segmentation and object detection. Yu and Koltun [35]
introduced dilated convolution to deep networks, which has
proved useful in dense predictions. The basic idea of dilated
convolution is to insert “holes” (zeros) in convolution kernels to obtain large receptive fields without downsampling.
Dilated convolution avoids information loss during downsampling and has been widely used in semantic segmentation tasks [30] [14] [20]. However, it has been observed that
simply stacking dilated convolution in CNNs may cause grid
effects and irrelevant long-ranged information [35] and lead
to performance deterioration. Wang et. al [28] proposed a
hybrid dilated convolution (HDC) framework to avoid grid
effects and improve segmentation performance on both large
and tiny objects.

2.4. AI-Based COVID-19 Segmentation Systems
Artificial intelligence has been widely utilized in fighting
against COVID-19. We mainly focus on AI-based semantic
segmentation systems upon CT scans. Many works focus on
learning robust and noise-insensitive representations from
limited or noisy inputs. For example, Xie et. al [33] proposed a RTSU-Net for segmenting pulmonary lobes in CT
scans. A non-local neural network module was introduced to
learn both visual and geometric relationships among feature
maps to produce self-attention. Wang et. al [26] presented
a noise-robust framework for COVID-19 lesion segmentation. They utilized a noise-robust Dice loss and adaptive
self-ensembling strategy to learn from noisy labels. Chen
et. al [4] proposed a residual attention U-Net which introduced aggregated residual transformations and soft attention
mechanism to learn robust feature representations. Also, researchers look into segmentation solutions that achieve both

high speed and high accuracy. For example, Zhou et. al [38]
developed a rapid, accurate and machine-agnostic segmentation and quantification method for automatic segmentation
on COVID-19 lesions. The innovation of their work lies in
the first CT scan simulator for COVID-19 and a novel network architecture which solves the large-scene-small-object
problem. Qiu et. al [21] developed a parameter-efficient
framework to achieve fast segmentation of COVID-19 lung
infection with relatively low computational cost.

3. Methods
In this section we will go through the details of the proposed D2A U-Net architecture. In the first part, we will offer the overview of proposed network. We then provide details about dual attention mechanism and proposed attention
modules. Finally we introduce our proposed decoder blocks.

3.1. Overview of Network Architecture
Basically, our proposed network is based on the U-Net
[22] architecture, which is quite popular in medical image
segmentation. Compared with original U-Net, dilated convolution and a novel combination of attention mechanism are
integrated in our framework to obtain better feature representation. As COVID-19 pandemic broke out rapidly, available
open access CT image data with gold-standard annotations
is hard to acquire, and thus utilizing pretrained encoder in
the segmentation model can offer a better parameter initialization and improve generalization ability. Therefore, in this
work, we utilize a ResNeXt-50 (32×4d) [32] pretrained on
ImageNet as the encoder of our model. Furthermore, we
integrate a dual attention mechanism in model decoder. A
gated attention mechanism is inserted inside skip connections to utilize both high and low levels of feature representations and reduce semantic gap between encoder and decoder. Also, we introduce another fused attention mechanism in model decoder to refine feature maps after upsamling. We utilize a hybrid dilated convolution module [28] as
the basic block of model decoder to enlarge receptive field
and produce better dense predictions. The network scheme
is shown in Fig. 2.

as input to generate fused attention. The number shown in the parentheses inside conv
block means the number of outchannels. See 3.2.1 for details.

3.2. Dual Attention Mechanism
We introduce a dual attention mechanism composed of a
gate attention module (GAM) and a decoder attention module (DAM) to our network. GAM is utilized to refine features extracted by model encoder and reduce semantic gap
by fusing high and low level feature maps. DAM is inserted
in model decoder to refine feature representations after upsampling.

3.2.1. Gate Attention Module
Feature concatenation from encoder to decoder is the
typical topological structure in U-Net, where the combination of high-resolution features in the encoder and upsampled features in the decoder enables better localization of
segmentation targets [22]. However, not all visual representations in encoder feature maps contribute to precise segmentation. Also, semantic gap between encoder and decoder
could limit model performance as well. Thus, we introduce a
gate attention module before concatenation to refine features
coming from model encoder and reduce semantic gap.
Oktay et. al [17] proposed an attention gate to refine encoder features with attention mechanism. But in their proposed attention gate only spatial attention mechanism is implemented to refine features. We believe introducing channel
attention and spatial attention simultaneously will improve
the efficiency of attention mechanism. Thus, inspired by the
global attention upsample module proposed in pyramid attention network [11] and CBAM [31], we provide a novel
design of a gate attention module to enable both channel attention and spatial attention. Detailed scheme of the proposed GAM is shown in Fig. 3. Two feature maps are fed
into the attention module. The guiding signal refers to the

feature map coming from model decoder (or the last convolution block in model encoder), and the feature refers to feature maps coming from model encoder to concatenate with
upsampled feature maps. We use 𝐆 ∈ ℝ𝐶𝑔 ×𝐻𝑔 ×𝑊𝑔 to denote
guiding signal and 𝐅 ∈ ℝ𝐶𝑓 ×𝐻𝑓 ×𝑊𝑓 to denote features.
In a U-Net shaped architecture, compared with 𝐅, 𝐆 contains more deep and high-resolution semantic information
which is encoded in channel dimension. We utilize global
average pooling and a multilayer perception (MLP) to create
a channel attention map 𝑍𝑐 (𝐅) ∈ ℝ𝐶𝑓 ×1×1 . The output size
of the MLP is smaller than the input size, thus we suppress
irrelevant feature representations in channel dimension and
implement channel-wise attention mechanism. In short, we
compute channel attention as follows:
𝑍𝑐 (𝐅) = 𝜎(𝑀𝐿𝑃 (𝑃𝑎𝑣𝑔 (𝐆)))
= 𝜎(𝑊𝐶𝑓 (𝑅𝑒𝐿𝑈 (𝑊𝐶𝑔 ∕𝑟 (𝑃𝑎𝑣𝑔 (𝐆)))))

(1)

where 𝜎 denotes sigmoid activation, 𝑃𝑎𝑣𝑔 denotes global average pooling, 𝑊0 ∈ ℝ𝐶𝑔 ∕𝑟×𝐶𝑔 and 𝑊1 ∈ ℝ𝐶𝑓 ×𝐶𝑔 ∕𝑟 , 𝑟 denotes reduce ratio and in our experiments it is set to 16.
Spatial attention is guided by both guiding signal and input feature itself. We use convolution operation with 1 filter
to squeeze channel dimension of 𝐆 and 𝐅. Then reduced feature map from 𝐆 is upsampled to match the size of 𝐅. A combination of convolution operation with different kernel size
is utilized to produce spatial attention 𝑍𝑠 (𝐅) ∈ ℝ1×𝐻𝑓 ×𝑊𝑓 .
In short, we compute spatial attention as:
𝑍𝑠 (𝐅) = 𝜎(𝑓3×3 ([𝐅𝐫 , 𝐆𝐫 ]) + 𝑓5×5 ([𝐅𝐫 , 𝐆𝐫 ]) + 𝑓7×7 ([𝐅𝐫 , 𝐆𝐫 ]))

3.2.2. Decoder Attention Module
In semantic segmentation, high-resolution visual representations in the encoder need to be upsampled to make dense
predictions. Transposed convolution and interpolation are
both popular solutions to image upsampling, but both have
their drawbacks. Compared with interpolation, transposed
convolution is trainable and offers more nonlinearity to deep
networks, which improves model fitting capacity. But grid
effect is hard to avoid if hyperparameters are not configured properly, while such drawback can be more troublesome when stacking more than one transposed convolution
layer. Thus we propose a combination of bilinear interpolation and following convolution to upsample feature maps.
However, as interpolation is not trainable, it is inevitable
to introduce irrelevant information or noise to upsampling.
First Author et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier

We introduce a decoder attention module to solve this issue. A fused attention mechanism is utilized to refine postupsampling feature maps in both channel and spatial dimensions. The scheme is shown in Fig. 4. Compared with
GAM, DAM is more simplified and only takes one input,
but the implementation of both channel and spatial attention
is quite similar. We use 𝑍𝑐 (𝐅) ∈ ℝ𝐶×1×1 to denote channel
attention, 𝑍𝑠 (𝐅) ∈ ℝ1×𝐻×𝑊 to denote spatial attention and
𝑍(𝐅) to denote fused attention. In short, DAM is computed
as follows:

4.1. CT Segmentation Dataset

Standard convolution hardly reaches a large receptive field
due to kernel size. Such drawback in traditional design of
U-Net based network decoder can limit the performance in
segmentation. Inspired by the design of hybrid dilated convolution [28], we proposed a residual attention block (RAB)
as the basic module in model decoder. Unlike similar works
using dilated convolution in the encoder, we explore to use
it in the decoder to capture multiscale patterns of upsampled
feature maps. Hybrid dilated convolution is utilized in our
RAB to acquire large receptive fields and avoid grid effects.
The stem of RAB is a stack of dilated convolution with kernel size 3 and dilation rate [1, 2, 5], followed by a decoder
attention module. The scheme is shown in Fig. 4.
We assume initial receptive field as 1 × 1. The equivalent
kernel size of dilated convolution is computed as follows:

CT slices used in our experiments consist of 3 datasets[1][8].
Details about dataset used are shown in Table 1. Dataset
1 contains 100 axial CT slices from more than 40 patients,
which have been rescaled to 512 × 512 pixels and grayscaled.
All slices are segmented by a radiologist using three labels:
ground-glass opacity, consolidation and pleural effusion. Dataset
2 contains 9 axial CT volumes, where 373 out of the total of
829 slices have been evaluated by a radiologist as positive
and segmented using 2 labels including ground-glass opacity and consolidation. Dataset 3 contains 20 CT axial volumes, which have been segmented by two radiologists and
verified by an experienced radiologist.
Dataset 2 and Dataset 3 contain 29 CT volumes in total, but not all slices contain infection regions. We choose to
discard all slices containing no COVID-19 infection and use
slices with annotations only. As annotations in Dataset 3 do
not distinguish ground-glass opacity and consolidation, we
take both ground-glass opacity and consolidation in Dataset
2 as COVID-19 lesions and do not distinguish them as well,
thus creating a binary segmentation dataset. An intensity
normalization has been applied on both datasets and all slices
have been rescaled to 512 × 512 pixels to match Dataset 1.
We take all ground-glass, consolidation and pleural effusion
in Dataset 1 as COVID-19 lesions, just the same as what we
have done to Dataset 2.
We did not choose to combine processed Dataset 1 to 3
together and then split them randomly, because in this way
slices of one certain subject can exist in both training and
test datasets, which could be regarded as a data leakage and
cause a virtual-high model performance. Instead, we finally
obtain 1645 processed slices from processed Dataset 2 and
Dataset 3 in total and use these slices as our final training
dataset, and then we use 100 axial slices from Dataset 1 as
our final test dataset. Such data split can best evaluate model
generalization capacity.

𝐾 = 𝑘 + (𝑘 − 1)(𝑛 − 1)

(7)

where 𝐾 denotes equivalent kernel size, 𝑘 denotes actual
kernel size and 𝑛 denotes dilation rate.
Thus, the equivalent kernel size of dilated convolution
with kernel size 3 and dilation rate [1, 2, 5] is 3, 5, 11, respectively. According to the definition of receptive field,
such design of stacked dilated convolution reaches a receptive field of 17 × 17, which enables the capture of global
information. Also, dilated convolution with different dilation rate can capture multiscale information in feature maps,
which can contribute to the accurate segmentation on both
large and small objects.
As we use a ResNeXt-50 (32 × 4d) as model encoder, we
utilize residual connection in decoder as well to avoid gradient vanishing. Dilated convolution is followed by a DAM to
refine upsampled features and produce fused attention maps.
In short, the output of our RAB is computed as follows:

4.2. Implementation Details
4.2.1. Model Hyperparameters and Settings

lows:

Model encoder is a ResNeXt-50 (32 × 4d) pretrained on
ImageNet-1K. We remove the global average pooling and
full connection layers from original network. Number of
output channels is 64, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, respectively,
just the same as original paper of ResNeXt. Convolution
operations in model decoder are padded, without stride, if
not specified. Bilinear interpolation is utilized to upsample feature maps, and scale factor is set to 2. Dice loss is
widely utilized in semantic segmentation, but the differential of Dice loss is sometimes numerically unstable and may
lead to oscillation in training process. The combination of
Dice loss and cross-entropy could avoid this issue. Thus we
combine Dice loss 𝑑 and binary cross-entropy loss 𝑐 as
our final loss function:
𝑠𝑒𝑔 = 𝑑 + 𝛼𝑐

(9)

where 𝛼 = 1 in our experiments.

4.2.2. Training Details
Our model is implemented using PyTorch on an Ubuntu
16.04 server. We use a NVIDIA RTX 2080 Ti GPU to accelerate our training process. Data augmentation is utilized in
our training process to reduce overfitting and improve generalization capacity. First all input images are rescaled to
560 × 560, followed by random flip, random rotation, random gamma and log transform. Finally images are randomly
cropped to 448 × 448 and fed into network. The model is optimized by an Adam optimizer with 𝛽1 = 0.9, 𝛽2 = 0.999,
𝜖 = 1𝑒 − 8. 𝐿2 regularization is utilized to reduce overfitting
as well. We set model weight decay to 1e-4. Initial learning
rate is set to 1e-4 and reduced when faced with plateau, with
reduce factor being 0.1 and patience being 10. The batch
size is set to 6 and we perform evaluation on test set after 30
epochs. The training process takes approximately 140 minutes.

4.3. Evaluation Metrics
We use Dice similarity coefficient and pixel error as the
main metrics to evaluate segmentation performance of our
D2A U-Net. Dice is a statistic used to gauge the similarity
of two samples, and has been widely used to evaluate performance in semantic segmentation. Pixel error measures the
number of pixels predicted falsely in the image, which shows
the global segmentation accuracy of the proposed models.
Both metrics measure segmentation performance in a global
way. In addition, we calculate recall score of infection regions as recall score measures model’s sensitivity to lung
infection, which is rather significant in terms of COVID-19
infection. We use 𝐺 to denote ground truth, 𝑃 to denote
dense predications, 𝑇 𝑃 to denote true positive, 𝐹 𝑃 to denote false positive, 𝑇 𝑁 to denote true negative and 𝐹 𝑁 to
denote false negative. These metrics are calculated as fol-

4.4. Comparison with Cutting-Edge Methods
We compared the performance of proposed network with
U-Net [22], Attention U-Net [17] and U-Net++ [40]. The
VGG-style backbone refers to the encoder design proposed
in original U-Net paper [22].
Also, we compared our model with 2 cutting-edge models widely used in natural image segmentation, including
FCN8s [12] and DeepLab v3 (output stride = 8) [3], with
both models containing a pretrained backbone as well.
Apart from model performance comparison, model parameters and computational costs (FLOPs) are also compared in our experiments.
As our model differs with other U-Net family models in
terms of model encoder, to best evaluate our design of model
decoder and attention mechanism, we also build a simplified D2A U-Net with a VGG-style backbone as well. We
believe the simplified version offers more fair comparison
between proposed network and other U-Net based models,
while standard D2A U-Net with backbone ResNeXt-50 (32
× 4d) provides best segmentation results.
To best evaluate model performance, all the metrics reported in Table 2 are averaged in 5 reduplicate experiments
to report a fair and reliable result.

4.5. Segmentation Results
4.5.1. Quantitative Analysis
Detailed comparison among different models in our experiments is shown in Table 2. As has been shown, without
pretrained backbone, our proposed network outperforms UNet, Attention U-Net and U-Net++ in terms of Dice, pixel
error and recall. As these models are identical in model encoder, it is clear that the proposed dual attention mechanism
and RAB contribute to infection segmentation a lot. The
utilization of attention mechanism aids the model to detect
infected tissues more accurately, which reduces the number
of false positives and improves recall score. Also, RAB in
model decoder captures both large and tiny visual structures,
which is helpful to segment infection lesions with different
size. Also, it should be noted that proposed D2A U-Net with
VGG-style backbone outperforms U-Net++ with comparably lower model parameters and computational costs, which
could prove the balance of efficiency and performance in our
models.

that introducing GAM to U-Net model can boost the performance, which leads to a better Dice score and recall.

Utilizing pretrained backbone could also improve model
performance. As can be seen, our D2A U-Net with pretrained ResNeXt-50 (32 × 4d) backbone outperforms other
networks including ones with similar pretrianed backbones
in terms of Dice, pixel error and recall by a large margin
and yields best results on our dataset. Also, our D2A U-Net
with pretrained ResNeXt-50 (32 × 4d) backbone takes fewer
computational resources than FCN8s and DeepLab v3 (output stride = 8). As can be seen from Table 2, pretrained
encoder could offer a better initialization of model parameters and reduce overfitting, especially when data amount
is insufficient. Overall, the proposed architecture performs
better than existing cutting-edge models.

Effectiveness of Proposed RAB We conducted similar experiments (No.1 and No.3) to explore the effectiveness of
proposed RAB, which includes a hybrid dilated convolution
block and a decoder attention module. Experimental results
indicate that introducing RAB to our model yields better results as well, but the performance boost is comparably limited compared with GAM.

4.5.2. Qualitative Analysis
We visualized segmentation results, as is shown in Fig.
5. It can be seen from the visualization that our proposed
model outperforms other models obviously. U-Net and Attention U-Net are the least sensitive to COVID-19 lesions,
and the background pixels have much stronger activation compared with other models. U-Net++ produces more accurate
segmentation results, but still not promising as some tiny
lesions or lesions with blurred edge are segmented poorly.
D2A U-Net with VGG-style backbone produces most accurate segmentation masks compared with other U-Net based
models mentioned above, and when backbone is switched to
ResNeXt-50 (32 × 4d), D2A U-Net produces the best segmentation results, which is comparably more sensitive to
blurred or tiny lesions than other models.

5. Conclusion

4.5.3. Ablation Study
Several ablation experiments were conducted to evaluate
the performance of components presented in our model, as
is shown in Table. 3.

Effectiveness of Proposed GAM To evaluate the validity of proposed GAM in our experiments, we designed two
baselines shown in Table. 3, including No.1 (U-Net only)
and No.2 (U-Net + GAM). Experimental results have shown
First Author et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier

Effectiveness of Combining GAM, RAB and PB As can
be seen from Table. 3, in experiment No.4, introducing GAM
and RAB together (proposed D2A U-Net) yields best results
in our experiments, and the performance boost exceeds the
simple addition of each module’s performance boost. Such
experimental results indicate that introducing GAM and RAB
together promotes the performance mutually. Also, in No.5,
pretrained backbone as better parameter initialization could
further improve model performance.

In this paper we proposed a novel segmentation network,
D2A U-Net, for COVID-19 CT segmentation. Inspired by
global attention upsample and CBAM, we propose a novel
gated attention mechanism, called gate attention module, to
produce a fused attention map on features extracted by encoder. We introduce a decoder attention module as well,
which helps refine upsampled feature maps. Also, inspired
by hybrid dilated convolution, we present a residual attention block containing a hybrid dilated convolution and a decoder attention module; we use it as the basic block in model
decoder. Attention mechanism is utilized to increase model
sensitivity to positive pixels and improve recall score. And
we use residual attention block as decoder basic block to
refine upsampled feature maps and increase receptive field
simultaneously. Experimental results indicate that our network design is capable of segment COVID-19 lesions from

CT slices automatically, and achieves best results among popular cutting-edge models evaluated in our experiments. But
our work is still limited to some degree, as only binary segmentation is performed in our experiments, which can limit
model’s potential use in both diagnosis and health care. We
expect to gather more CT scans and perform multi-class segmentation in the future. Also, despite the significantly better performance of our D2A U-Net with ResNeXt-50 (32 ×
4d) backbone, the model has much more model parameters
than other architectures with similar backbones (FCN8s and
First Author et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier

DeepLab v3). We believe that as ResNet family models have
a large number of channels (eg. 1024 and 2048 in the last two
layers), the parameters of model decoder becomes extremely
large. Such problem might be addressed by introducing socalled Bottleneck in ResNets to the decoder of D2A U-Net
to reduce channels and thus model parameters.
