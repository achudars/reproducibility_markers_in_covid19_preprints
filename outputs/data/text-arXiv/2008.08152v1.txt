Abstract. In order to investigate the effectiveness of lockdown and social distancing
restrictions, which have been widely carried out as policy choice to curb the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic around the world, we formulate and discuss a staged and
weighed networked system based on a classical SEAIR epidemiological model. Five
stages have been taken into consideration according to four-tier response to Public
Health Crisis, which comes from the National Contingency Plan in China. Staggered
basic reproduction number has been derived and we evaluate the effectiveness of lockdown and social distancing policies under different scenarios among 19 cities/regions
in mainland China. Further, we estimate the infection risk associated with the sequential release based on population mobility between cities and the intensity of some
non-pharmaceutical interventions. Our results reveal that Level I public health emergency response is necessary for high-risk cities, which can flatten the COVID-19 curve
effectively and quickly. Moreover, properly designed staggered-release policies are extremely significant for the prevention and control of COVID-19, furthermore, beneficial
to economic activities and social stability and development.

Introduction

Since late December of 2019, an increasing number of atypical pneumonia cases caused by
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) have been reported in Wuhan,
China [20]. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID19 outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEI). However, the
COVID-19 has been kept spreading around the world at an alarming speed, and has now
spread to more than 200 countries, areas, or territories. On March 11, 2020, WHO declared
the spread of COVID-19 as a global pandemic [36]. As of August 14, 2020, there have been
more than 21 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide with more than 757,000 deaths
[36].
To fight the highly contagious new coronavirus that has ravaged the world in such a
short period of time, most of the countries around the world have taken strict prevention
and control measures to mitigate and curb the spreading of the pandemic. In the absence of
effective antiviral treatment or vaccines, it is now popular to implement non-pharmaceutical
interventions (NPIs), including social distancing, contact tracing and testing, self-quarantine
or isolation, closing schools and workplaces, banning the gatherings. In particularly, in order
to block the spreading, more than 100 countries carry out full or partial lockdown strategy
to battle the pandemic [4, 6, 8, 9].
Among some of the few successful countries, China was the one to have stopped the
spatial propagation of the virus earlier [18], and now the country is gradually coming back
to normal. There have been extensive modeling studies about the transmission of the virus
and how Wuhan and other provinces in China had successfully controlled the epidemic.
Recall that after the SARS outbreak in 2003, China has established a legal framework with
the Law on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases as its core part. In response
to public health emergencies, the National Contingency Plan for Public Health Crisis is
formulated, and the Plan divides public health emergency response into four-tier: extremely
significant (Level I or Top level), major (Level II), relatively major (Level III), and general
(Level IV), with level I the most serious [25].
The outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan was unprecedent. After it was recognized that the
virus was some novel coronavirus and can transmit from one individual to another quickly[30],
Wuhan quickly adopted the response system and treated as Level I emergence. On January
23, 2020, the megacity was lockdown. On January 25, a total of 26 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across China have initiated Level I public health emergencies
response, covering more than 1.2 billion population. Hence, after locking down and with
strict NPIs to limit population mobility and to reduce the local community transmission in
the whole country, the level of emergency response gradually dropped from high to low level
till the prevalence of COVID-19 was effectively controlled as of the early of April, 2020 [26].
Naturally, different control policies will result in different control effectiveness on the
transmission of infectious diseases. Assessing the infection risk and compare the effectiveness
of NPIs have become essential tools for public health policymakers. Nowadays, a large

3
number of mathematical models have been developed to incorporate some NPIs to explain
the mechanisms of the propagation of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic [8, 24, 28, 44].
Numerous data-driven modeling studies have been developed play important role to inform
the public health and policymakers [13, 29, 31, 42]. Some predictive models were developed to
serve as early warning tools to estimate the final infection size of the outbreak and spreading
speed, and assess the effectiveness of the NPI control measures. Especially, most of the above
models are based on SEIR-type (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed) compartmental
models [1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 19, 20, 24, 29, 33], and few takes into account the spatial spread of the
COVID-19.
Factually, even with the strictest prevention and control measures for the lockdown,
individual’s basic living needs, such as going to the hospital for medical treatment and the
basic food supply chain, cannot be stopped. Population mobility will inevitably happen
in intercity and intracity, nonetheless, which play significant roles in shaping the epidemic
spreading process. Therefore, many multi-patch models have been proposed to explore
the influence of population mobility on the spatial spread of disease between patches with
different level of disease prevalence [14, 32, 46].
On the other hand, population mobility in epidemic models can be characterized via
network or graph. In the past two decades, epidemic transmission in networked models have
been extensively explored, see details in [4, 17, 22, 27, 34] and the references therein. Recently, Population mobility in a SIRS epidemic model was considered via graph Laplacian
diffusion [34], the discrete Laplacian operator has been introduced to describe the transmission between each two cities.
Most research in networked epidemic dynamics have been carried out with the nonweighted graph, i.e., the passenger numbers between each two cities are constant. However,
it turned out more practically that the passenger number between each two cities could
always be different. For controlling the outbreak of COVID-19 in China, public health
has taken some prevention and control measures strictly following the guideline of four-tier
response system, and on different level of epidemic, the extent of NPIs were taken accordingly.
Then, on each level, the contact transmission probability between susceptible and infectious
individuals varies over time. For example, in different levels of the epidemic, the travel
restrictions are different to maintain the contact transmission probability at a low level.
In present paper, we will develop a novel weighted network epidemic model by accounting
for time-varying population mobility in different stages according to the adjustment of the
four-tier response system. We will investigate the impacts of transportation restrictions and
NPIs taken in different stages on the propagation of the raging COVID-19 around the world.

A weighted network model at different level of response

Recently, the classical SEAIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Asymptomatic-Infectious-Removed) compartmental models have been used to look into the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. If
we denote susceptible S (which are under risk of contracting the infection), exposed E, infectious but asymptomatic A, infectious with symptoms I, and removed R, see Figure 1,
then a typical ODE model for COVID-19 can be written as

The N = S + E + A + I + R is the total population. The class R includes the hospitalized
population, recovered population and the dead due to disease, therefore the class is not
infectious to others. The natural death and the disease-related death are ignored since the

corresponding parameters (for example, the natural death rate is about 60×365
) are very
small. All other parameters are summarized in Table 1.

The SEAIR type model is a deterministic meta-population transmission model that simulates each individual in the population as a separate compartment, and predicts the disease
transmission mechanism, which depends on the parameters, the start time and initial values [3, 13, 29, 42]. Obviously, system (2.1) neglects the spatial dispersal of the population.
To understand the spatial propagation of the virus, we will employ the discrete Laplacian
operators defined on a network to describe the individual’s mobility between cities into the
epidemic dynamic system (2.1) [5, 34].

5
In what follows, for the readers’ convenience, we introduce some definitions and notations
about the graph in network structure. Networks are mathematically characterized as graphs.
A graph G = G(V, E) is a collection of points V , which called vertices (nodes in the physics
literature). These points are joined by a set of connections E, which called edges. Each edge
denotes the presence of a relation or interaction between the vertices it joins. Specifically,
x ∈ V if x is a vertex in G(V, E), some pairs of vertices are connected by links called edges,
and E = {(x, y)} where (x, y) is an edge between the vertices x and y. Two vertices x and
y are said to be adjacent if they are connected directly by an edge, and we write x ∽ y to
denote that x and y are adjacent.
A weighted graph G(V, E; ω) is a graph G(V, E) with a weight function ω : V × V ×
[0, ∞) → [0, +∞) satisfying ω(x, y; t) ≥ 0 and ω(x, x; t) = 0 for x, y ∈ V , and ω(x, y; t) > 0
if and only if x ∽ y, x, y ∈ V. Similarly as stated in [11, 27, 34], we assume that total n cities
are in danger of COVID-19 and each city is viewed as a vertex. The function ω(x, y; t) can
be thought of as the probability per day that an individual of corresponding compartment
travels from city y to city x at time t.
Definition 2.1 For the function f (x, t) : V × [0, ∞) → R, the discrete Laplacian operator
∆ω of x on V at time t is defined by
X

ω(x, y, t)f (y, t) − ω(y, x, t)f (x, t)
∆ω f (x, t) :=
y∼x, y∈V

and the discrete gradient operator ∇ω of x on V at time t is defined by
X
∇ω f (x, t) :=
ω(x, y, t)f (y, t).
y∼x, y∈V

By regarding graph as a spacial domain, we extend model (2.1) incorporating the discrete
Laplacian operator via finite weighted graph to the model reads as
 ∂S
− △ω S + β ∗ (t)∇ω (εI + ξA) = −β(t)S I+ξA

 ∂R
− △ω R = γA (t)A + γI (t)I,
(x, t) ∈ V × (0, +∞),
∂t
where ω(x, y, t) describes the population mobility from city y to city x, ∆ω E(x, t) means that
ω(y, x, t)E(x, t) exposed population in city x move to city y, at the same day, ω(x, y, t)E(y, t)
exposed population in city y move to city x. The coefficient ε is imposed on the infectious
with symptoms based on the assumption that only small portion of infectious with symptoms can travel successfully. Moreover, during the travel from city y to city x, the mobile
susceptible population ω(x, y, t)S(y, t) inevitably come into contact with the mobile infectious population ω(x, y, t)(I + ξA)(y, t) , hence, it may have more probability to be exposed
with contact transmission rate β ∗ (:= kβ > β). Therefore the travel leads to an increasing of

due to all population are almost susceptible. The flowchart of the transmissions between

According to four-tier public health emergency response in mainland China, and similarly
as statement in [41], we define ω(x, y, t) as the following step functions to investigate the
impact of the population mobility between cities on the spatial spreading of COVID-19

where we assume that there are five different stages according policy choices, that is, there is
no lockdown strategy at the initial outbreak [T0 , T1 ] with normal population mobility ω(x, y);

7
Level I response is launched and strict lockdown strategy is carried out during the second
stage (T1 , T2 ] with bigger effect rate µ2 ∈ [0, 1]; In the third stage (T2 , T3 ], the emergency
response is lowered to level II and part of transportation restore to restart economic activities
and necessary travels. In the forth stage (T3 , T4 ], level III emergency response is carried out,
economic activities further restart and travels are permit subject to half of the normal flow.
In the fifth stage t > T4 , most of transportation restore but there are still some travel
restrictions.
The parameters µi ∈ [0, 1] for i = 2, 3, 4, 5 represent weighted averages of restriction
levels of transportation between city x and y, where µi = 0 means usual transportation
without any restriction and µi = 1 means very little transportation permit. The factor
0.95 is imposed to reflect the fact that complete lockdown of every city is impossible and
impractical, there are still some necessary business transactions and population movements
between cities, see more details in [41].
Another important control policy is keeping social distancing, which has been proved to
be effective to reduce the contact transmission rate and depends on the policy choices, too.
In the initial outbreak stage [T0 , T1 ], people has no self-protection consciousness, the contact
transmission rate β0 in this stage is comparatively high; In the second stage, people are
required to stay at home and keep social distancing, and the contact transmission rate β(t)
becomes smaller than that in the first stage, which depends on the intensity and scope of
the implementation of prevention and control measures, as well as the severity of the disease
and individual’s compliance with policies. In the third stage, part economic activities are
reopen and the contact transmission rate may be increasing comparatively. In the forth
stage, most economic activities are reopen, but large scale gathering activities are forbidden,
and in the fifth stage t > T4 , mandatory requirements have been canceled but people may be
used to take self-protection measures and continue to keep social distancing to some extent.
According the staggered properties, we define

β = β0 ,



β5 = (1 − 0.95ϑ5 )β0 , t > T4 .
Similarly, the parameters ϑi ∈ [0, 1] for i = 2, 3, 4, 5 represent weighted averages of restriction
levels of social distancing in all cities, and the factor 0.95 is imposed to reflect the fact that it
is impossible to keep social distancing completely even under the strictest segregation policy.
On the other hand, the time from the confirmed cases to be quarantined become shortened, and then γI and γA turn to be bigger over time. Assume that γI (t) := γI (0)γ(t) =
0.1γ(t) and γA (t) := γA (0)γ(t) = 0.25γ(t), where γ(t) gets its minimum value 1 (valued at
the initial time) and its maximum is α with α > 1, and then it can be described by the

Basic reproduction number and risk assessment

We assume that the initial condition
(A1) S(x, 0), E(x, 0), A(x, 0), I(x, 0), R(x, 0) ≥ 0,

X

E(x, 0) + A(x, 0) + I(x, 0) > 0, and

x∈V

∗

N(x, 0) = N (x) > 0, for x ∈ Ω,
which indicates that the total population of city x at the initial time is N ∗ (x). It follows
from the qualitative theory of ordinary differential equations [3] that a unique nonnegative
solution of (2.2) exists for all t > 0. The existence and uniqueness of the solution can be
also obtained by upper and lower solution methods, see [34] and references therein.
As the threshold which reflects the transmission mechanism of the disease, the basic
reproduction number R0 is defined as the number of new infections generated by one infected
individual during the entire infectious period in a fully susceptible population [35], and it
reflects the ability of an infection spreading during the early stage of an outbreak.
We first assume that all parameters in (A1) are all independent of t. Recalling that the
numbers of population in different cities are different, however the number of population in
city x moving to city y is almost equal to that of the population in city y moving to city x,
so here we assume that ω(y, x)N ∗ (x) = ω(x, y)N ∗ (y) for x, y ∈ V .
It is easy to check that system (2.2) subject to assumption (A1) possess a unique diseasefree equilibrium (N ∗ (x), 0, 0, 0, 0). Since the infected individuals are in the compartments
E, A and I, therefore, by means of the next generation matrix approach [35], we can deduce
the vector of new infections F and the vector of transitions between compartments V as
follows

Noticing that if ωij ≪ 1, we can easily prove that V11 , V22 and V33 are all irreducible nonsingular M-matrices with positive column sums, therefore, Vii−1 > 0 for i = 1, 2, 3. The basic
reproduction number for (2.2) is the spectral radius of the next generation matrix F V −1 ,

where the first term accounts for the risk of infection within each city and the second term
accounts for the risk of infection induced by the individual’s mobility between cities.
Specially, neglecting the dispersal between cities (ωij = 0), the basic reproduction number
with control measures can be expressed as follows

The following dynamical result of problem (2.2) without control measures is obvious, we
omit the proof since it is a modification of Theorem 3.1 in [14].
Theorem 3.1 Assume that the parameters ω, β, γA, γI are all independent of time t,
ω(y, x)N ∗(x) = ω(x, y)N ∗(y) for x, y ∈ V , and ωij ≪ 1 or the matrix [ωij ] is irreducible.
If R0 < 1, the disease-free equilibrium of (2.2) with the initial condition (A1) is globally
asymptotically stable.

10
However, during the spread of COVID-19 pandemic, consequent policy decisions (such as
quarantine, isolation, or traffic restrictions) have been made according to different situations,
the basic reproduction number is no longer a constant and it is time-varying. Therefore, it
is usually expressed by the effective reproduction number Re (t) or the basic reproduction
number with control measures Rc (t). However, owing to characteristics of stages, we have
the following staggered reproduction number:
β(t)σ ρ(ξ(1 − θ)V22−1 V11−1 + θV33−1 V11−1 )(t)
+β ∗ (t)σ ρ(ξ(1 − θ)V22−1 MV11−1 + θεV33−1 MV11−1 )(t)

It is obvious from (3.2) and (3.3) that staged policy choices for lockdown and social distancing
both lead to the change of the basic reproduction number, which reveals that appropriate
control measures can reduce the risk of pandemic and slow the spread of the COVID-19.

Robustness of the simulation results

We retrieved daily numbers of COVID-19 cases in Wuhan and 18 other cities/regions in mainland China that reported more cases than other cities/regions by January 23, 2020 (Wuhan,

11
Chongqing, Beijing, Xiaogan, Shanghai, Taizhou, Shenzhen, Huanggang, Jingzhou, Jingmen,
Changsha, Zhuhai, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Foshan, Beihai, Hangzhou, Hefei, Wenzhou). We
obtained the population flow data from Baidu platform (https://qianxi.baidu.com).
Figure 2 shows a comparison of the number of population flow between 2019 and 2020
in a typical city (Guangzhou). We can clearly find that after the implementation of the
level I response, the number of people move in and move out from Guangzhou in 2020
was significantly lower than that in 2019. The gap was slightly narrowed when the level II
response is launched. Daily number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in each city was assumed
to follow a Poisson distribution. We calculate the maximum likelihood estimates of µi , ϑi , α, ε
and k by fitting model to the number of newly reported cases before June 1, 2020. Then we
obtained the 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of these parameters by applying the profile
likelihood estimation framework with a cutoff threshold provided by Chi-square quantile.
Please note that reported cases in Wuhan was not included in the fitting process since
researches [23, 43] suggested that the under-reporting was likely to occur in the early stage
of outbreak in Wuhan and confirmed cases increased dramatically after February 12, 2020 in
Wuhan, due to the changing of the diagnosis criteria. The fitting results are largely consistent
with daily numbers of newly reported cases by June 1, 2020 in cities/regions selected (Figure
3).
As for Wuhan, we assumed a ascertainment rate of 1.8% [37] on January 1 and increased
linearly to 14% [23] on January 23 and then increased linearly to 80% before February
12 when diagnosis criteria was changed in Wuhan. We assumed a 14-day reporting lag of
COVID-19 cases before 17 January [45] and increased linearly to 3 days before February 12.
Due to the diagnosis criteria change, we assumed that cases undocumented in the previous
20 days were reported on February 12. In addition, ascertainment rate and reporting lag
after February 12 was assumed to be 100% and 0 days, respectively. Figure 4 presents that
the adjusted estimates of daily reported and cumulative number of infections was close to
the observations. Table 2 lists the value and 95% CI of estimated parameters.

Since none of the selected cities has entered the Level IV response yet, We
assumed the value of µ5 and ϑ5 according to the content of the policy.

As shown in Table 3, we simulated three additional scenarios other than baseline condition: The overall response intensity decreased to 70% (alternative 1), all the response

intensity decreased to 70% after Level I response (alternative 2) and all the response intensity decreased to 70% after Level II response (alternative 3). In Figure 5, our simulations
implies that if intensity of lockdown and social distancing restrictions were 70% of the current
situation, the duration of the epidemic would be significantly prolonged. A low intensity of
the response is likely to lead to the second wave of the epidemic. We also estimated the basic
reproduction numbers Re (t) in five stages under these scenarios in Figure 6, which suggests
that stringent lockdown and social distancing policy provide a smaller basic reproduction
number, reduce the infection risk and low the virus spreading speed.

To examine the impact of the timing of the emergency response, Figure 7 presents the
simulated results for additional scenarios that all responses were deferred for one week (7
days) and two weeks (14 days). It shows that a later implementation of the lockdown and
social distancing policy significantly increased the total number of infections. Compared
with the baseline scenario, a 7-day and a 14-day delay of the interventions may lead to
a three times and ten times of the peak daily infections, and postpone the peak of daily

Discussion

The modeling and simulations reveal that Level I public health emergency response was essential and proven to be a successful strategy for high-risk cities. Level II response is suitable
for medium-risk regions where the basic reproduction number has dropped significantly, and
the social and economical needs to restart, but the basic reproduction number is still near 1.
It means that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has not been completely contained, prevention and control measures cannot be relaxed, and the self-protection measures is still needed
to prevent the second wave of the epidemic. Level III public health response is effective for
lower-risk regions, where there has been no new confirmed case for six consecutive days, and
most of the patients have been discharged from hospitals. Level IV will be the normalize
life for several months or even longer until the vaccine has been successfully developed and
put into use. These research results show that it is necessary to adopt different levels of
public health emergency response to prevent and control the epidemic in multi-stage and
multi-region. The success of prevention and control of the COVID-19 in Wuhan and other
provinces of mainland China also reveals that this is an effective approach to inhibit the
large-scale and rapid spread of COVID-19 pandemic.
Mathematically, the stricter the control strategies, the smaller the staggered reproduction
number. However, the implementation of the policy is also a double-edged sword. The strict

control strategies will certainly lead to heavy economic losses and great inconvenience to
people’s work and life. It was easimated in [39] that the total monthly economic losses
during the first month of the lockdown of Wuhan from January 23 to February 23, 2020
reach 177.0413 billion yuan. Also, it was also shown in [38] that the lockdown also increased
the mental stress of residents. Strict traffic restrictions and suspension of non emergency
medical services are likely to delay hospitalization of non-COVID-19 patients, some of whom
may already be in critical situation [16]. Therefore, adopting a multi-stage control strategies
according to the public health emergency response levels is not only conducive to the control
of the epidemic, but also conducive to social development and the normalization of people’s
lifestyle. How to balance epidemic control, economic activities and social development is a
difficult choice for every decision maker. We will discuss it in our coming work.
