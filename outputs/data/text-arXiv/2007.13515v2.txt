Abstract
There is a wide-ranging debate about the merits and demerits of searching for, and sending messages to, extraterrestrial intelligences (SETI and METI). There is however reasonable (but not universal) consensus that replying to a
message from an extraterrestrial intelligence should not be done unilaterally, without consultation with wider society
and the rest of the world. But how should this consultation actually work? In this paper we discuss various ways
that decision making in such a scenario could be done democratically, and gain legitimacy. In particular we consider
a scientist-led response, a politician-led response, deciding a response using a referendum, and finally using citizens’
assemblies. We present the results of a survey of a representative survey of 2,000 people in the UK on how they thought
a response should best be determined, and finally discuss parallels to how the public is responding to scientific expertise
in the COVID-19 Pandemic.
Keywords: SETI

1. Introduction
Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) is the
process of searching for intelligent life forms in the Universe beyond planet Earth. There are many such searches
underway [1], conventionally using large astronomical telescopes. The current scientific consensus1 is that there is
no life (intelligent or otherwise) beyond planet Earth in
our Solar System [3]; whether there is life elsewhere in
the Milky Way or indeed the Universe remains an open
question[4, 5]. Alongside SETI, sometimes researchers consider the prospect of actively Messaging Extraterrestrial
Intelligence (METI, sometimes called active SETI) - sending messages out into the Universe with the intention of an
as-of-yet unknown intelligence finding and understanding
the message[6].
Modern SETI projects are generally considered to start
with Project Ouzma in 1960[7, 8]. Notable contemporary
examples include Breakthrough Listen[9] and Search for
Extraterrestrial Radio Emissions from Nearby Developed
Intelligent Populations (SERENDIP)[10]. METI conventionally takes either the form of physical artefacts (e.g.
the Voyager Golden Records[11]) or electromagnetic signals beamed at astrophysical bodies (e.g. radio signals
like the Arecibo Message [12] or perhaps with pulsed laser
signals [13]). There is an extensive literature considering
how many extraterrestrial species there might be in the

Universe [14, 15], and the practicalities of sending messages, and how they might be decoded, are fields in and
of themselves[16]. SETI and METI remain speculative enterprises, but have grown as disciplines over time, particularly since the discovery that exoplanets are ubiquitous
throughout the Galaxy[17].
There is considerable debate in the literature about the
merits and demerits of METI[18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25].
Those against typically would argue that METI risks ‘revealing’ the location and existence of our planet, and that
it might attract the attention of a hostile species, with potentially civilisation ending consequences. The arguments
in favour typically counter that Earth’s regular electromagnetic signals (TV etc.) have already revealed our location if that was a reasonable worry, and furthermore
that First Contact might bring unimaginable benefits if
they are friendly2 . Perhaps the consequences and nature
of First Contact would simply be so beyond our current
frame of reference that inevitably any predictions will have
been made in vain[26, 27]. The purpose of this paper is not
to discuss these arguments, but instead to focus on the issue of how that decision ought to be made. Opponents have
proposed banning or regulating METI[24, 28], so the question is not completely hypothetical - and would rapidly become imperative if there ever was a real life First Contact
scenario. There are a few suggested protocols, but little
discussion of how these decision making processes might
acquire legitimacy - how can METI be made democratic
(if indeed it needs to be).
2 There are many more details to these arguments, better summarised elsewhere.

that they should try to have some international consultation in the determination of any message5 . This trend has
continued into the 2010’s6 , a 2012 follow-up to the ‘Wow!’
signal consisted of 10,000 Twitter messages7 , and in 2016
the European Space Agency message ‘A Simple Response
to an Elemental Message’ included 3775 messages from the
worldwide public8 .

Outer space has presented democratic, political, legal
and governance issues for decades e.g. regulating satellite ownership and liability and managing ownership issues
of mining asteroids. For example, legally a key plank in
the international framework for space is the Outer Space
Treaty of 1967[29], which limits the types of weapon that
can be placed in space, forbids governments from making
claims over the Moon or other bodies in the Solar System,
and regulates ownership of objects launched into space.
Politically, exploration of outer space has been charged
since the dawn of spaceflight e.g. who is chosen to be an
astronaut[30, 31, 32]. Here we discuss various democratic
processes that have been relevant for SETI and METI to
date.

2.2. Composing Replies
In terms of replying to received messages, there is no
universally endorsed approach, but probably the most popular/well recognised outlook is the 1989 International Academy
of Astronautics SETI Post-Detection Protocols. The protocols lay out some guiding principles to be followed in the
event of a detection, and gives an outline of a procedure to
be followed, namely to not publicly announce the detection until it has been independently verified, and to then
inform other observers through the International Astronomical Union, and the Secretary General of the United
Nations (in accordance with Article XI of the Outer Space
Treaty). In particular the 8th protocol proposes ‘No response to a signal or other evidence of extra-terrestrial
intelligence should be sent until appropriate international
consultations have taken place. The procedures for such
consultations will be the subject of a separate agreement,
declaration or arrangement.’910 More recently, on the 13th
February 2015, SETI experts met at an annual meeting of
the American Association for the Advancement of Science,
and released a declaration concluding that: ‘A worldwide
scientific, political and humanitarian discussion must occur before any message is sent.’11 The question of what
amounts to an ‘international consultation’ or a ‘worldwide scientific political and humanitarian discussion’ is left
unanswered in the IAA protocol and the AAAS declaration12 . It is the aim of this paper to discuss what such
a process might involve and how it might become to be
perceived as legitimate.

2.1. Composing Messages
Early 1970’s METI effects were typically led by an individual, or small group of individuals, who then took a series of consultations to improve and clarify their proposed
message, before sending. The Pioneer Plaques (launched
1972 and 1973) were essentially developed just by Carl
Sagan, Frank Drake and Linda Salzman Sagan[33] over
three weeks. Similarly the 1974 Arecibo message similarly
was developed by a team of about four people led by Frank
Drake[34]. A few years later for Voyager Golden Records
(1977) NASA required a more formal process over the
much longer period of a year. The images and music (and
message from US President Carter) that went on the discs
were selected by a six person committee chaired by Carl
Sagan, selected by NASA. NASA is known to have vetoed
some choices of the committee, so there was effectively
an oversight process[11]. Making a plaque/record/message
that is representative of all humanity is an incredibly challenging task[35, 28], and the contents of the record have
been debated substantially in the subsequent decades[36].
In all these cases, the number of humans directly contributing to the development of the message was less than
ten, with arguably with some informal oversight from a
larger number of people from NASA.
IRM Cosmic Call 2 was sent to 5 Sun-like stars in
2003 and contained messages composed by citizens of the
USA, Canada and Russia3 [37], likely the first international METI effort. More recent METI attempts have expanded the number of people involved in determining the
content of any message to extraterrestrials. In 2008 ‘A
Message From Earth’ was sent towards Gliese 581 c, and
the content of the message was determined by online submissions and votes on social media website Bebo4 . Bebo
at the time had 12 million users who in principle could
have voted, and half a million actually participated. The
trend is clear; by the 2000’s METI attempts generally felt

3. Approaches in SETI and Democracy

process of this type differently and come to different conclusions on the science itself14 . Not all representatives are
elected15 , and there are ways to introduce elements of public engagement and accountability without shifting away
entirely from technocratic representation. The question is
what the aim of this public engagement is for, is it to act
as a check on the actions of representatives or to introduce
elements of feedback and transparency.
Consider too the ways in which scientific and political
representation can bleed into each other16 . It is important
to think not only what kinds of representatives will be
involved in a SETI and METI processes, but how those
actors will exercise their expertise and judgement, and to
what degree the public will perceive that expertise and
judgement as legitimate.

In this section, we will critically assess the range of
democratic approaches taken to SETI and METI. We will
consider these approaches - scientist-led, representativeled, referendums, and citizens’ assemblies - separately as
well as the ways in which they are connected. The nature
of SETI and METI are such that none of these decisionmaking methods on their own can satisfy the requirements
of the protocol and declaration of a ‘worldwide scientific
political and humanitarian discussion’ (Section 2).
The key to assessing the appropriateness of the decisionmaking procedures for SETI and METI is the balance
between expertise and judgement. Technocratic, expertise based arguments are more appropriate for those questions where there are clear answers, but for questions of
judgement and trade-offs, traditional political representation may be more appropriate13 . The Protocol and the
declaration both suggest with the mention of ‘political and
humanitarian elements’ that SETI and METI are not only
scientific questions, but also questions of political judgement. Consequently, a range of decision making processes
are required for a process to be perceived as legitimate.

3.2. Representative Led
An alternative approach would centre on elected and
governmental representatives. To date there has not been
huge amounts of interest in playing a major part in SETI
by elected representatives at the national government level,
but this is of course a mainstay of science fiction e.g.
“Take me to your leader”. The IAA protocols do centre the United Nations in the process, and the possibility
of international treaties about METI have been considered
before[43]. The challenge of engaging with the United Nations is that the underlying democratic credentials and
political expectations vary enormously from jurisdiction
to jurisdiction. Indeed, that kind of approach would bring
all of the limitations of achieving international consensus
to the process of SETI and METI. A different group of
elected representatives, perhaps established specifically for
this purpose, would have opposing problems in that while
it could be more nimble, it could have far less publicity
and so would likely be perceived to be less legitimate. It is
important to emphasise again that certain decisions about
METI, particularly a “take me to your leader” scenario,
have a very short turnaround time. It is essential that
there is a global discussion in advance[24, 44, 28] in order
to avoid SETI and METI descending into realpolitik[45],
and to continue to see SETI and METI in scientific and
humanitarian terms rather than defence terms.

3.1. Scientist/Expert Led
A scientist led response is probably the most studied
mode of reply[41], and to some degree is implied by the
9th protocol of the IAA Protocols, which proposes that
‘...an international committee of scientists and other experts should be established to serve as a focal point for
continuing analysis of all observational evidence...’ (although it doesn’t explicitly suggest that this body should
have decision making responsibilities per se). With respect
to the Pioneer Plaques and Golden Records, the process
was almost entirely expert led. There was some government oversight, via NASA, but the approach to these processes was that this was a fundamentally a scientific question, and so the appropriate method of decision-making
was technocratic, based on scientific expertise. The conception of scientific expertise informing these approaches
did not involve consulting widely among scientists who
took different views, were of different backgrounds, or representing different jurisdictions.
It is important to reflect too on what it means for a
scientist to be a representative. Different scientists will
likely, and rightly, conceive of their roles in a consultation

3.3. Direct Democracy/Referendums
‘A Message From Earth’ and other similar crowd-sourced
METI efforts are of course drawing heavily upon Direct
Democracy ideas. SETI@Home, where members of the
public can contribute some of their home computing power
to SETI searches[46], similarly to some degree draws upon

13 ‘Political issues, by and large, are...not likely to be as arbitrary
as a choice between two foods; nor are they likely to be questions
of knowledge to which an expert can supply the correct answer.
They are questions about action, about what should be done; consequently, they involve both facts and value judgements both ends
and means. And, characteristically, the factual judgements and the
value commitments, are inexplicably intertwined in political life.”
Hanna Pitkin, The Concept of Representation (University of California 1967). 212 [40]

14 Weingart gives a helpful account of this in the context of the
debate about ozone at 156 [42]
15 Representation need not mean representative government. A
king can represent a nation as can an ambassador. Any public official
can sometimes represent the state. Pitkin 2 [40]
16 ‘The boundary between politics and science has to be constantly
redrawn and reiterated’ Weingart 160 [42]

the principle that SETI/METI are a universal endeavour
that should be carried out collectively. The challenges
of working across languages and political systems persist
from the challenges with elected representatives, and inequities with respect to access to technology should be
taken seriously too. Even in these cases, there is worry
about what the democratic credentials of such a process
would be without a global demos, and whether a global demos is possible such that cross-national processes can have
democratic legitimacy17 . Furthermore, the voting stage of
a referendum is significantly shaped by the agenda-setting
stage and a familiar criticism of these types of processes
is that they are dominated by elites18 . If referendums,
polls, and other forms of direct democracy are employed,
it must be clear in advance how these processes are being
used and what the implications are in advance, and there
must be equity in the agenda-setting processes that takes
different languages, political backgrounds, and scientific
perspectives seriously.
Governments occasionally reply to petitions on topics
to do with SETI e.g. 17,465 signatures on a petition to the
White House that got an official response[48]19 . There has
been one real world government mandated referendum to
do with the topic of SETI to our knowledge; Initiative
300 in Denver, Colorado, USA. Voters in the area on the
2nd November 2010 voted on whether or not to charge the
city with creating a seven person commission to investigate UFOs. Campaigners had to get 3,973 signatures for
the referendum to go ahead, but it was rejected 31,108
(17.66%) to 145,022 (82.34%).

METI efforts that were advertisements for products[38].
This allows for nimbleness but not the sort of widespread
public perception of legitimacy that is necessary for the
sort of broad consensus imagined by the IAA protocol[28].
4. Survey Data
Over 2019-2020 we performed a series of formal and
informal projects to sample opinions in the UK on how
METI efforts might best acquire democratic legitimacy.
These public perceptions are crucial for understanding what
kinds of processes have broad public support. The most
rigorous of these studies was a survey we commissioned
from the British polling agency Survation. On our behalf,
Survation asked 2000 people 18 years or older resident in
the UK two questions:
Question 1)
Imagine a scenario in which scientists receive an unambiguous message from extraterrestrials (alien life forms)
on a distant planet. Of the following options, which would
be your preference in terms of how humanity’s response to
this message should be determined?
1.
2.
3.
4.

Team of scientists
39%
By elected representatives
15%
By a planet-wide referendum
11%
By a citizens’ assembly of randomly selected adults
11%
5. Don’t know
23%
Question 2)
In the event that a planet-wide referendum on whether
to reply to a message from extraterrestrials or not was held,
would you vote to initiate contact with the alien species,
vote to not initiate contact with the alien species or would
you not vote in that referendum?

3.4. Consultative/Citizens’ Assembly
Citizens’ assemblies, or mini-publics, are processes where
participants are selected randomly and participation reflects broader demographics20 [49]. So, for example, if the
population is 52% female so too would the participants
be. This creates challenges for understanding what demographic characteristics to isolate. Citizens’ assemblies
are sometimes used as freestanding democratic processes,
and at other points they are built into larger democratic
processes such as by producing proposals that then lead
to referendums[50]. They provide a reasonably efficient
mechanism of public consultation, but not the sort of broadbased public legitimacy of wide-spread participation.

1. Vote to initiate contact with the alien species 56%
2. Vote to not initiate contact with the alien species
13%
3. Would not vote
10%
4. Don’t know
21%
Survation weighted the sample to be representative in
terms of age, sex, region, household income, education,
2017 General Election Vote, 2016 EU Referendum Vote,
and 2019 European Parliament Election Vote, and we have
answers to the poll broken down by those responses. The
data was taken 2nd - 5th September 2019. These breakdowns are included in Appendix A, but responses largely
were uncorrelated with demographics.
The polling questions were designed to be indicative
rather than definitive, and of course Q1 artificially separates the approaches; people largely tried to suggest a
mixture when given the option in person. Participants also
occasionally brought up the issue of whether a world-wide
referendum would be administratively possible. To our

minds such an undertaking would indeed be challenging but 614,684,398 people voted in the 2019 Indian general
election, so democracy on a large scale is possible.
To our knowledge no comparable polling for the first
question exists. Our second question has been asked in
various forms, although to our knowledge this is the first
time it has been asked posed in the form of a voting intention question. Our Q2 however is consistent with other
polls that find that in the absence of more information
people’s attitudes are largely positive towards communication with extraterrestrials e.g. a 2015 Yougov UK poll
in 46% found in favour of communication, 33% against
communication and 21% don’t know21 .
The limits of the poll are clear and important 1) it
covers only the UK (and just 18 year olds and older) and
2) it was taken at an exceptional time for democracy in
the UK. These limitations did however in some ways make
the question a ‘Rorschach test’ for attitudes to democratic
processes. The authors’ interactions with people suggested
quite a low satisfaction with representatives and referendums (although that is for another time and place). It
also proved a useful pedagogical tool to get members of
the public to think about different democratic processes
in a non-partisan way.
We also asked the question in a range of less structured
ways, including: British Science Festival (10th September
2019), Stargazing Oxford (25th January 2020), secondary
schools (Europa School in Oxfordshire on the 15th March
2019, Dover Grammar School for Girls in Kent on the 1st
November 2019) and a British Science Association twitter
poll22 . Interestingly the results were fairly robust across
slightly different audiences and slightly different ways of
asking the question.
Participants did sometimes get to give their own suggestions of how to make the decision. Suggestions included: letting famous individuals make any decision (Sir
David Attenborough and HM Queen Elizabeth II were suggested), flipping a coin, letting psychologists decide and
letting children decide23 .
Finally we did during 2019 ask a real sitting Member of
the UK House of Commons (who will remain anonymous)
this question, who simply said that they did not want the
referendum option.

processes associated with SETI and METI. It is no longer
enough - if it ever was - for a few scientists to go it alone.
It is essential for purposes of legitimacy of the processes
that the public sees them as legitimate. This creates a
tension in that processes that are genuinely consultative
take time, and some instances of METI may happen very
quickly. It is essential too to consider what kind of issues
SETI and METI are. We have argued so far that they
include elements of expertise and judgement, and so this is
going to require different types of representatives working
together with the public around the world.
We broadly support the view put forward by Churchill
that scientists should be ‘on tap, but not on top’. The
IAA has rightly signalled that there are scientific issues at
stake, but not scientific issues that are beyond doubt, and
they intersect too with political issues that are questions
of judgement. We think that the process should be driven
by a team of scientists nominated by different jurisdictions
rather than countries (the global north, global south etc)
with broad opportunities for consultation through polls
and citizens’ assemblies. Ideally there would be a role for
elected representatives who already specialise in science
such as those who lead parliamentary select committees
on science.
Essentially: there is a role for scientists, individuals,
referendums, and representatives in the process of designing ‘global humanitarian and political consultation’. It requires attending to the parts of SETI and METI that are
technical scientific issues, how to communicate (which requires social science and humanities as well as science) and
those of judgement, should such initiatives be undertaken
in the first place, what should be said. The best balance
between these different types of representation will lead to
the best outcome. Designing such a process is challenging,
but when grounded on the right principles it is certainly
possible.
6. The COVID-19 Pandemic as a SETI Event Proxy
The bulk of the research and thinking behind this paper was performed in 2019. In 2020 the world was hit by
a real-life scientific crisis that affected the entire world,
across society, leading to mass death and economic damage. Here we discuss similarities and differences between
the pandemic and a First Contact event, and why the
world’s response to COVID-19 might be the best chance
of seeing how governments and scientists might interact in
such a scenario[53], before a First Contact event actually
happens.
Although the pandemic remains an evolving situation
at the time of writing, we suggest that there are some similarities between the COVID-19 crisis and a First Contact
event for the following reasons - both are:

5. Recommendations
The purpose of the protocol and the declaration are
to say that a greater degree of legitimacy is required for

1171422013308559362
23 This possibility had in fact, unknown to the authors, already
been implemented in the Teen Age message and the ‘New Arecibo
Message’, which both used submissions from youths [38].

• Crises of a fundamentally scientific nature
• Also of huge social, moral, economic, political impact

• World-wide crises affecting essentially every human
on Earth

was no desire for the public to be directly involved in decisions about lockdown. All of these are observations about
how the crisis played out rather than approval/criticism.
Could a committee of just scientists have had the authority
to order lockdown? Would voting to end or lift lockdown
have led to good outcomes? We will likely never know
the answers to these questions - hopefully it will be many
years before democracies are given comparably challenging
decisions.

• ‘External’ threats i.e. all of humanity is ‘on the same
side’ (in contrast to say, WWII)
• ‘Out of the blue’; both have been seen as possible in
advance, but were essentially unanticipated
They are of course also many ways in which a pandemic
is different from First Contact:
• Pandemics are not completely without precedent;
the last major global pandemic was 100 years ago,
whereas First Contact would be completely without
precedent

7. Conclusions
While historically consultation processes with respect
to SETI and METI have been ad hoc and limited, the IAA
have signalled with their declaration that a more demanding process is required going forward. We have surveyed
different models of representation in light of the different
parts of the METI and SETI questions, which are in fact
composed of a number of sub-questions about science and
politics. We argued that different types of representation
are required for different parts of this question, and that
many types of representation will need to work together.
We suggested some recommendations for how this is possible. This takes time, and it is important to be proactive
rather than reactive given that METI can happen quickly,
but it is certainly possible to satisfy the standard of a
global humanitarian and political and scientific conversation, and it may be that having such conversations is
timely for other global issues such as climate change and
public health.
Key points:

• Pandemics are wholly negative events, whereas First
Contact could have both positive and negative impacts
The full social impact of COVID-19 will take many
years to unravel. We briefly note a few salient occurrences
that may be insightful for how a real First Contact incident
could occur (again predominantly from a UK perspective):
• Scrutiny of individual involved scientists skyrockets to levels normally only experienced by top level
politicians24
• Other scientists setting up alternative sources of advice25
• The public rapidly learning that scientific advice can
be conflicting26

• Within the limited scope of this project, it appears
the the public are happy about scientists having a
key role in determining how contact with extraterrestrials is made

In particular we would note the response has been largely
led by politicians. For example, politicians could have at
the start of the crisis completely passed over judgement
about when lockdowns would be imposed and raised to an
independent body. This did not happen in the UK (and
not to our knowledge anywhere else in the world). Similarly it is not completely unimaginable to completely pass
decision making about the crisis out to the public; let people vote every three weeks if they were ready to reduce the
severity of lockdown27 . There were some weak efforts at
direct democracy e.g. petitions, but these currently have
far fewer signatures than the petitions about Brexit, which
clearly there was much more demand for direct input into
the process (the top Brexit-related petition has ∼ 6 million
signatures, wheras the top COVID-19 related petition only
has approximately a tenth of this). There were also some
small citizen-assembly-like processes, but essentially there

• The COVID-19 crisis gives an insight into how scientific advice can be politicised very rapidly, and suggests that scientific and representative mechanisms
will find it easy to dominate any First Contact scenario
• Thought should be given to making sure dealing with
a detection has maximum legitimacy. One possible
way we believe this could be achieved is by having decision making driven by a team of scientists
nominated by different jurisdictions (rather than nation states) with broad opportunities for consultation; ideally there would be elected representatives
who already specialise in science. For example those
who lead parliamentary select committees (and similar) on science might be particularly well placed to
contribute to decision making, having both expertise
as well as democratic legitimacy.

(23rd June 2016), and 2019 European Parliament Election Vote (23rd May 2019). Targets for the weighted data
were derived from Office for National Statistics data and
the results of the respective votes. In all questions where
the responses are a list of parties, names or statements,
these will typically have been displayed to respondents in
a randomised order. The political parties abbreviations
are CON (Conservative Party), LAB (Labour Party), LD
(Liberal Democrat Party), SNP (Scottish National Party),
BREXIT (Brexit Party) and GREEN (Green Party of
England and Wales).
The tables show the unweighted total of individuals in
a given sub-population, the weighted total, and then the
weighted number and percentages of people selecting the
given options. Needless to say, not all differences in survey
answers between sub-groups are statistically significant.
