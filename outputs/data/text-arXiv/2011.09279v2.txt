By the end of May 2020, all states in the US have eased their COVID-19 mitigation measures.
Different states adopted markedly different policies and timing for reopening. An important question
remains in how the relaxation of mitigation measures is related to the number of casualties. To
address this question, we compare the actual data to a hypothetical case in which the mitigation
measures are left intact using a projection of the data from before mitigation measures were eased.
We find that different states have shown significant differences in the number of deaths, possibly due
to their different policies and reopening schedules. Our study provides a gauge for the effectiveness
of the approaches by different state governments and can serve as a guide for implementing best
policies in the future. It also indicates that the face mask mandate seems to correlate with the
change in the death count more dramatically than other measures.

I.

INTRODUCTION

At of the beginning of November, there are close to 10
million confirmed cases and more than 237,000 casualties
attributed to COVID-19 in the United States. Although
the first case was confirmed on January 20, the number
of reported cases was rather low until early March. The
exceedingly slow spreading in these early months may
have partially been due to the lack of adequate testing,
which has remained a major issue for a long time. The
number of reported cases then dramatically increased in
early March.
Since the growth rate of infections was alarmingly high
in most areas by mid-March, the majority of states implemented mitigation efforts by the end of March. These
measures included closing restaurants and bars, shutting
down schools, and implementing stay-at-home orders. By
early April, nearly all states were under some form of
lock-down. The infections tapered down appreciably due
to these mitigation efforts. The daily number of new
cases seemed to peak in early April and both the number
of new cases and deaths steadily decreased from April to
late May.
While the total number of infections never dropped below 16,000 per day, many states decided to reduce their
mitigation efforts after this first wave. By the end of
May, all states had rolled back their restrictions in some
capacity. Certain states were more aggressive in reopening than others. While the number of infections was not
particularly large at the beginning of reopening since the
observed effect of the spread is delayed due to the incubation time and waiting time to receive testing results,
many states saw a sharp increase in the number of cases
between late May and early June. This concerning situation forced several states to scale back plans for reopening
in order to stabilize the exponentially increasing number
of cases.
There are several factors which are expected to reduce
COVID-19 mortality rate. Adequate testing was rather
limited before May. Testing has since expanded apprecia-

bly and stabilized at about 800,000 per day. One would
expect an increase in testing rate to reduce the number of fatalities, as people who tested positive as well as
their close contacts should be quarantined. Moreover,
the death rate was particularly high at the beginning of
the pandemic due to the large number of infections in
high risk groups, such as residents of assisted living facilities. The fact that the average age of infected persons
has been decreasing since March should correspond to
a reduction in the death rate. Finally, improvement in
treatments should also help to reduce the mortality rate.
Together with the awareness of preventative measures,
such as wearing masks in public areas, all of these factors
should help to reduce the mortality rate and the number
of casualties per day providing that the mitigation efforts
remain intact.
Since all of these factors point to a decrease in the
number of fatalities, the marked increase in the number
of deaths since late May clearly indicates that relaxation
of the mitigation efforts is the prominent reason for the
increase. This is also consistent with the fact that states
which were more aggressive in reopening, in terms of both
the timing and the restrictions lifted, seem to have experienced a higher percentage increase in death counts.
Therefore we believe understanding the relation between
reopening policies and death count is a timely topic.
This paper provides an estimate of the change in the
number of fatalities with respect to easing mitigation efforts. We not only quantify the additional number of
deaths, but more importantly, by comparing between different states, this study provides clues to the reopening
strategy which could minimize loss of life. We find significant differences between different states, as while most
states display an increase in the number of fatalities, a
handful of states actually show a decrease. This should
be important and timely information as another infection
wave may occur in the winter season.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we
describe the model and methods. The results are presented Section III. In section IV, we discuss our results
in the context of the different state reopening policies.

The confirmed positive count is P (t) = Q(t) + RQ (t) +
C(t), where RQ (t) are the recovered patients previously
in quarantine. P (t) can be estimated as:

We conclude our discussion in Section V.

MODEL

Z

We employ the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR)
model1,2 modified to consider the number of quarantined people. Similar modifications on the SIR model
have been considered elsewhere to model the spread of
COVID-19.3–43 This model is essentially a coarse grained
or mean field approach that assumes the population is
homogeneous and well mixed and that the dynamics do
not exhibit an explicit time delay. The advantage of this
model is in its simplicity, as it tries to describe the development of an epidemic with a minimal number of variables and parameters. It allows for an intuitive understanding of the spreading of the virus, which is not often
the case for a generic model of time series with a lot
of tunable parameters. The limitations of the model are
thoroughly discussed in a recent publication.45 The equations defining the dynamics of the model are as follows:
dS(t)

dI(t)

dQ(t)

(3)

= ξ(t)Q(t) + αI(t),

(4)

= δ(t)Q(t),

(5)

where N is the total population size, S is the susceptible
population count, I is the unidentified while infectious
population count, Q is the number of identified positive
cases which are quarantined, R is the number of recovered
patients, and C is the number of deaths. The model
is characterized by the following parameters: β is the
infection rate, η is the detection rate, α is the recovery
rate of asymptomatic people, ξ is the recovery rate of
the quarantined patients, and δ is the casualty rate of
the quarantined. All of the parameters are in units of
(1/day). The quarantined population Q is composed of
the identified positive cases regardless of whether they
are hospitalized or at home. We further assume that all
casualties had been in quarantine prior to death and we
consider that only ξ and δ are time dependent out of the
coefficients. All of these assumptions are approximations
made to allow for inference of the model parameters from
the currently available data.
The total death count at time t, D(t), can be estimated
as:

Method

We determine two sets of parameters, one before the
stay-at-home order and the other after the social distancing measures are in place, as discussed in our previous
work.44,45 Instead of extrapolating the data from other
areas or countries, we choose to determine it from the
casualty and confirmed case counts in each state separately. We estimate the first set of parameters by fitting
the data at the beginning of the epidemic to an exponential growth. We consider the effects of social distancing
measures to be reflected in two parameters, the reduction of the infection rate, and the first day when the
measurements are effective, since there is a time delay in
the influence the stay-at-home orders have on the number of cases and deaths. We determine both parameters
by minimizing the χ2 of the values and daily changes of
the death and the confirmed infected count based on the
data before April 30th.45 The data for the daily casualties and new cases are obtained from the database of the
New York Times.46

III.

RESULTS

Within the present model, there are two major routes
for slowing the initial exponential growth of the epidemic,
which is characterized by the parameter β − (α + η). The
first route is to decrease the infection rate β and the second route is to increase the testing rate η. Mitigation
efforts in the spring sharply reduced the infection rate.45
Testing rate also grew during the spring and summer.47
Increasing the recovery rate of unidentified infected people, α, can also reduce the spread, but this is more difficult to achieve. Overall, we can expect that the recovery rate should improve slightly over time. The average
age of an infected person has trended towards decreasing since March.47 This fact should lower the death rate
among infected cases, since our model does not differentiate between different age groups.
All of these factors point out that the major, if not
the only, reason for drastic increases on the number of
infections and deaths is the relaxation of the mitigation
efforts and by consequence an increase in the infection

FIG. 2: Total death count (dots)46 and projected fatalities count without easing the mitigation efforts (solid line) as functions

the end of April.

TABLE I: The actual confirmed and the projected number of
deaths by August 31st. The projected count is obtained by
assuming the mitigation efforts in place at the end of April
were maintained by the end of August. The last column is
the factor of increase (if larger than 1) or decrease (if smaller
than 1) of the actual death count when compared with the
projection.

rate. If the mitigation efforts were to have remained intact, one would naively expect that both the number of
infections and fatalities would decrease over time.
We attempt to quantify how many additional people
died due to the relaxation of mitigation efforts. We
project the number of casualties under the assumption
that the mitigation efforts remain intact from the end of
April to the end of August, and compare this projection
with the actual death counts by the end of August. We
choose this date for the reason that the summer peak
seems to be passed by the end of August.
We investigate the twelve states with the largest number of casualties by the end of August. They are
New York, New Jersey, California, Texas, Florida, Massachusetts, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia,
Arizona, and Louisiana. Figs. 1 and 2 display the projected number of deaths, assuming that the mitigation
efforts and all of the parameters in the model remain
unchanged since the end of April, alongside the actual
number of deaths. Table I displays the confirmed and
the projected number of deaths by August 31st, as well
as the ratio between both counts. Fig. 3 shows the ratio
between the actual and the projected death count by the
end of August as a bar chart.
From the data presented in Figs. 1, 2 and 3, and Table
I, one can conclude that there are marked differences in
the increase of the death count among various states. As
we discussed above, the major factor in this difference
should be due to the distinct policies in relaxing the mitigation efforts. An interesting and important topic is to
find any possible correlation between these policies and
the increase or decrease of fatalities.

FIG. 3: Bar chart with the ratio between the actual and the
projected death count by the end of August for the twelve
states with the largest counts. The projected count is calculated assuming that the mitigation efforts have been maintained since the end of April. This projection represents the
ideal upper bound for the number of casualties as other factors which should lower the death count are not taken into
account in the present model. See the text for details. Most
states are within 50% of the projection. Two states, Massachusetts and Illinois, demonstrate a lower death number
relative to the projections. Three states, Texas, Florida, and
Arizona, show a substantial increase relative to the projections. Another state which shows an increase greater than a
factor of two is Georgia.

REOPENING SCHEDULES OF DIFFERENT
STATES

In this section, we break down the details of the reopening policies of various states by considering the status of five categories of activities. These include the reopening of outdoor restaurants, indoor restaurants, bars,
gyms, and stores. The timings for reopening these businesses vary significantly between states. For example,
indoor restaurants were allowed to open on April 27th
in Georgia, but not until September 1st in New Jersey.
Besides the schedule of reopening of different businesses,
the face mask mandate can also be an important policy
which affects the spreading of the virus,48 therefore we
also considered the dates face mask mandates were enacted. The schedule for reopening and the date for the
state mask mandate, if applicable, are displayed in Table
II.

For a quicker visual understanding of the reopening
policies, we also plot the reopening dates of different cat-

TABLE II: The reopening policies of different states. These include the dates of reopening of outdoor restaurants, indoor
restaurants, bars, gyms, and stores. The date of the state mask mandate is also listed in the last column. An entry of “NA”
indicates that a statewide reopening of the particular category or mask mandate has not been implemented by the September
1.49

egories as a radar chart for all the twelve states we consider (Fig. 4). The size of the pentagon is related to
the speed of the reopening. The larger the pentagon,
the slower the approach to reopening. By contrast, the
smaller the pentagon, the more aggressive the reopening
policies.

Previously, we investigated the effects of reopening by
considering both the timing of reopening as well as the
extent of the prevention measures implemented to lower
the risk of infection after reopening. We found that lowering the infection rate is more important than the timing
of reopening in the long term.45 A probable way to lower
the infection rate is by wearing personal protective gear,
in particular a face mask.48
According to the data presented above, the four states
(Texas, Florida, Arizona, Georgia) which have the largest
increase of deaths due to reopening all have a common
feature – a mask mandate has never been implemented.
While the reopening date is markedly difference among
different states, these four states tend to reopen early, but
not by much compared to other states such as Michigan
and Louisiana. The reopening dates do not seem to have
as strong a correlation as the implementation of a mask
mandate to the death count. For comparison, the Pearson correlation coefficients between the reopening date
and the increase of the death count from the data presented in the table II fall between 0.5 and 0.7.
This observation seems to be consistent with the idea
that the lowering of infection rate after reopening is more
critical than the timing of reopening.44,45 The reopening
dates primarily affect the initial conditions of the epidemic, but the mask mandate affects the dynamics, in
particular the infection rate, of the epidemic. By the end

of August, California and Louisiana did not show as substantial an increase in casualties as the above four states,
although it is clear that the number of deaths per day is
increasing starting around mid-July.
The two states with a lower death count than projected, Illinois and Massachusetts, both started mask
mandates at earlier dates. Together with being comparatively late in reopening, they both show a clear decrease
in death counts as one would predict from the trend in
April.
While one can legitimately argue that correlation does
not imply causation, it does seem that lack of a face mask
mandate demonstrates the strongest correlation with the
increase in the death count after reopening. Delaying
the reopening should naively lower or at least delay the
increase in the number of fatalities, but it seems to be
a secondary factor when comparing to the effect of the
mask mandates. One cannot directly identify the lack
of a mask mandate as the cause of the increase in the
number of casualties, as the states which do not have a
mask mandate may also not have other policies which
could help in lowering the infection rate. It is beyond
the scope of the present study to uncover those possible
causes.

V.

DISCUSSION

The various mitigation efforts in the spring of 2020, in
particular the stay-at-home orders, helped to stabilize the
number of infections and casualties. All states passed or
very nearly passed the phase of exponential growth in the
number of infections by the end of April.45 Many other
factors should have reduced the spread of the virus and
the fatality rate. Awareness of the COVID-19 among the
public and the general increasing trend of wearing face

FIG. 4: Radar charts for the reopening policies in different states. Five different categories are included: indoor restaurants,
outdoor restaurants, gyms, bars, and stores. The earlier the reopening, the closer to the origin of the radar chart the vertex is.
The zeroth day (origin of the radar chart) is April 1st, and the last day (the edge of the radar chart) is August 30th. A smaller
pentagon implies a more aggressive approach in the reopening.

masks in public areas should contribute to the lowering of
the infection count, and thus the death count. Together
with substantial improvement in the number of tests administered as compared to last March and the reduction
of the share of infections between senior citizens, all these
factors should reduce the infection and the death counts.
Thus, if the mitigation efforts had remained intact, the

infection rate should have decreased over time. Therefore, the hypothetical projection presented in this paper
represents an upper bound estimation, since it assumes
these factors which potentially reduced the infection rate
to be unchanged since the end of April.
The pressure to reopen starting in April led many state
governors to relax their states’ mitigation efforts. The

8
extent of the relaxation is markedly different between
states, as is the change in mortality.49 Our analysis provides a quantitative assessment of the increase in the
number of deaths due to the relaxation of the mitigation
efforts and as consequence does or does not corroborate
the states’ policies. This study should provide insight on
what is a a good strategy for controlling the infection rate
in the process of reopening. While various strategies do
incur different impacts on human interactions and consequently the economy and many others, how to balance
the effectiveness of lowering the infection rate against the
negative effects of reducing human interactions is a broad
topic which is beyond the scope of this study.
From the analysis presented in this paper, we found
that three states show the largest increase in casualties
due to their reopening policies: Texas, Florida, and Arizona. Georgia also shows substantial increase, though
not to as great of an extent. On the other hand, Illinois and Massachusetts both show appreciable lowering
of the death rate after April. A common policy of the
four states with the largest increase of deaths due to reopening is the absence of a mask mandate in the state.
These four states tended to have reopened early, but not
excessively so relative to other states. Therefore, we conclude that reopening dates do not seem to have correlate
as strongly as the implementation of a mask mandate

with an increasing number of infections and deaths.
A thorough survey of the differences between policies
for states that show a marked increase in the death rate
compared to those that show a reduction should provide
guidance for a strategy which achieves the best results for
lowering the number of infections and deaths. In reality,
relaxing the mitigation efforts is perhaps not purely a
scientific problem, as it involves economic, political, and
other social considerations. A delicate balance between
all of those factors may need to be found.
Given that the winter season may present another wave
of infections, a thorough study is particularly time sensitive. Our analysis seems to suggest that the face mask
mandate is the most important policy for lowering the
death count.
