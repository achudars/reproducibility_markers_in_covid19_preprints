Abstract: We explore the spread of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Lebanon by
adopting two different approaches: the STEIR model, which is a modified SEIR model accounting for
the effect of travel, and a repeated iterations model. We fit available daily data since the first diagnosed
case until the end of June 2020 and we forecast possible scenarios of contagion associated with
different levels of social distancing measures and travel inflows. We determine the initial reproductive
transmission rate in Lebanon and all subsequent dynamics. In the repeated iterations (RI) model
we iterate the available data of currently infected people to forecast future infections under several
possible scenarios of contagion. In both models, our results suggest that tougher mitigation measures
would slow down the spread of the disease. On the other hand, the current relaxation of measures and
partial resumption of international flights, as the STEIR reveals, would trigger a second outbreak of
infections, with severity depending on the extent of relaxation. We recommend strong institutional and
public commitment to mitigation measures to avoid uncontrolled spread.

1. Introduction
The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been widely spreading worldwide since it appeared
in the city of Wuhan, China towards the end of December, 2019. The World Health Organization
classified the spread as a pandemic in March 2020 [1]. Europe and the United States of America
have endured the severest repercussions in terms of number of infections and deaths. The US cases
amounted to more than one fourth of total global infections by June 2020 [2]. Governmental and
institutional reactions and measures varied across countries with respect to the time of introduction of
social distancing measures (SDM, henceforth) and with respect to their degree of severity. In spite of
some governments being slower in adopting mitigation measures and endorsing the epidemiological

2

concept of herd immunity [3] to create a resistance to the contagion in the long run at the expense
of short term losses while keeping the economy functional, the majority adopted SDM’s that reached
countrywide lockdowns.
A considerable amount of research has been carried out focusing on the dynamics and extent of
the pandemic in different countries notably in the countries that witnessed the first cases [4–8]. In
comparison with the most recent deadly mass pandemic of the ”Spanish flu” that hit the world after
World War I during the years of 1918–1919 and recurred in two waves, and caused the death of tens
of millions of people [9, 10], the extent of the spread of COVID-19 has been far less. The question of
the containment of COVID-19 and preventing its spread and expansion into a similar deadly pandemic
is a key motivation for the study of various models that describe, simulate and forecast epidemics and
dynamics of infections under different reproductive rates and mitigation measures.
In Lebanon, the spread of COVID-19 coincided with a period of political turmoil, few months
of popular uprising and economic collapse finally depicted by the default on debts in early March
2020 [11].
Lebanon SDM SDM were adopted at a relatively early stage in Lebanon. The first confirmed case
was recorded on February 21, 2020, and consequently all educational institutions were closed starting
the first of March. This was followed by a resolution of ”Public Mobilization” and ban of public
gatherings that imposed closure of all places of worship, shops, restaurants, etc. except for grocery
stores and drugstores on March 22 [12]. Another subsequent measure consisted in constraining
vehicles’ mobility to alternating between odd- and even-ending plate numbers, while fully prohibiting
mobility on Sundays. Gradual and partial relaxation started on May 10, but the deep economic crisis
helped in slowing down social activity despite the easing of measures. The government decided to
open the airport with one-fifth of its normal capacity starting July 1st, after a period of limited returns
for Lebanese people living abroad between April 8 and June 30.
The source of the first infection was documented before the international travel ban to be from a
traveler coming from Iran [13] where the spread of the virus had started early on [14]. However, it has
been discussed that many of the following first cases were transmitted by travelers coming from the
Vatican city during the early stages of the pandemic spread there [15]. The efficacy of SDM’s can be
examined by discerning the daily rate of infection as shown in the daily data of the first 130 days [16].
Our results were obtained in relation to data available until June 30, 2020.
Literature and methodology Models exploring contagion and particularly spread of infections
were developed and extensively studied in various fields of mathematics, physics, economics and
epidemiology [17–22]. Mitigation measures have been shown to be effective in reducing and slowing
down the spread of infection by [23–25].
The SEIR model [26–28] has been widely employed to investigate contagion of diseases including
that of COVID-19 recently. In this paper, we establish a novel STEIR model, which consists of
modifying the SEIR model to take into account the effect of travel. We use the STEIR and a repeated
iterations model presented in [29] (henceforth the RI model) and implement it on the daily data of the
Coronavirus in Lebanon provided mainly by the Ministry of Public Health [16] over a duration of 130
days.

Figure 1. Daily infections (per million) in Lebanon, Turkey, Iran, Italy and the USA. In
comparison, Lebanon relatively maintained a low infection rate during the first 120 days.

The structure of the paper is as follows. In section 2, we present the two models. Results and
forecasts are discussed in section 3 and section 4 concludes the paper.
2. Theoretical framework
We describe here two models that we use to forecast the path of daily cases and to measure the extent
of the epidemic in Lebanon. Following an abrupt rise in infected cases at the start, the rate has fallen
to a significantly low level after implementation of severe SDM, in comparison with other regional
and country-level data [30] before slowly rising again after partial relaxation. Figure 1 illustrates the
progression of the number of daily infections over time in different countries: Lebanon, Turkey, Iran,
Italy and the USA. Day 0 represents the date of the first reported infection. Lebanon has a relatively
low number of infections per capita, despite the fact that the first case was recorded relatively early.
The proposed models accommodate for the actual data and allow for future predictions.
2.1. STEIR model
The spread of epidemics can be studied by the prominent SIR model first introduced by Kermack
and McKendrick [31], that consists of dividing the population into different compartments and
investigating the contagion of the disease by examining the rate of change of the sizes of these groups.
Later versions were developed to accommodate for different settings and assumptions [32–34]. The
STEIR model that we use is described as follows. Consider a population N initially normalized to
size 1 and divided into five categories of individuals: susceptible S , incoming travellers T , exposed E,
infectious I and removed (through recovery or death) R ∗ . The cumulative number of cases is
∗

The exposed individuals represented by E are those who are infected but not yet infectious, as defined in [35]. Recent studies reveal
that during incubation period, individuals are not infectious, and infectivity starts on an average of only 1-2 days before symptoms [23].

provided by C = I + R, since each recorded case would at a given time be either infectious or
recovered or dead. The rates of change of these categories are given by dS
, dT , dE , dI and dR
dt dt dt dt
dt
respectively. The model is formally characterized using the following differential equations:
S

dI

dt

(2.3)

dR
= γI
dt

(2.4)

dN

dt

(2.5)

with βt = Rt γ where βt is the rate at which infected individuals come across others (the NS susceptibles),
σ is the rate at which exposed individuals become infected and it is associated to the mean incubation
period; γ is the rate of exit by recovery or death per-day and it is associated to the average illness
period. In this sense, Rt = βγt is the ratio of meeting rate to exit rate; it determines the transmission from
susceptible to infected and is a proxy for social distancing measures. τ is the daily rate of incoming
travellers relative to the total population N and it contributes to both, the infected I and the susceptible
S . θ is the average infection rate among the travellers. The population size N slightly increases due
to the influx of travellers whose relative contribution is more apparent in the increase in the number
of infections I. We neglect the natural changes in the population as the time scale of the epidemic is
much faster than that of demographic changes [35].
There are several ways to model Rt . It can be taken as a constant parameter in some contexts, or as
a time dependent function as in [26]. Here, we introduce a novel parameterization for Rt . Using data
available from the first 130 days in Lebanon, we parameterize Rt by the step function

changed after this period of SDM, Rt is parameterized as follows:

where R0 , R1 , R2 and R3 are constant parameters that depend on the severity of measures and
commitment to those measures. R0 is the reproductive transmission rate of the disease in the initial
phase, while R1 and R2 are the reproductive transmission factors under strict and relaxed SDM
respectively. R3 represents the potential future rate under different possible relaxation schemes. Using
1
in relation to an average period of incubation of 5.2 days. We
the estimates in [35], we take σ = 5.2
1
use γ = 20 underlying an average period of recovery (or death) of 20 days. This value is in line with
the reports of the World Health Organization that estimate the average time of recovery to be in the
range of 2–3 weeks [36]. We can determine τ from Eq (2.5), and we find that
N

τ=

ln( Nif )
∆t

(2.8)

where Ni is the population on April 8 and N f is the population on June 30, after the arrival of air
passengers. The time ∆t is the number of days of incoming flights. This corresponds to τ = 2.91 ×
10−5 /day. From official data provided in [16], we also find that θ = 0.0377 by taking the ratio of all
positive cases among arriving travellers to the total number of incoming travellers until June 30, 2020.
Assuming that initially no SDM are applied, R0 represents the transmission of disease with no
mitigation measures. In [35] they adopt R0 = 3.1, while in [37] they take values between 2.76 and
3.25, and [26] considers different values between 3 and 1.6. Recent studies reveal that R0 of
COVID-19 can assume higher values up to 5.7 and 6.47 according to data analyzed from
China [38, 39]. After introduction of measures, Rt can assume values less than 1 in case extremely
severe mitigation measures are applied [40]. It was well established that COVID-19 has higher R0
than other infections like SARS [41]. The estimation of R0 and Rt is essential for forecasting the
spread, but their determination depends on the available data and the accuracy of the reporting of
initial cases and dates.
1
We assume that the initial value of I is I0 = 6M
, in line with the first initial case in Lebanon reported
on February 21 and a gross population of 6 million inhabitants. We take E0 = 12I0 to account for the
fact that the initial case registered had been in contact with many people on a flight from Iran which
raises the number of initially exposed people. The passengers were unprotected as they were not aware
of the presence of an infection among them until late during the flight [42]. To account for this fact,
1
we took E0 to be triple the value used by [26] where they consider I0 = 10M
with 33 initial cases in
the United States whose population stands at around 330 millions, and E0 = 4I0 given 132 individuals
were initially carrying but not contagious, acknowledging the considerable uncertainty related to initial
cases in the US. This entails some uncertainty in the initial conditions of the spread due to the lack of
readily available data.
By fitting the values of the reproductive number parameters in our model, we find that R0 = 5.6,
R1 = 0.52 and R2 = 1.1 for t1 = 32 days, t2 = 63 days and t3 = 130 days respectively, provide the best
numerical prediction to account for the actual reported cases. We assume that relaxation of measures
would increase the reproductive rate, but that public awareness and remaining measures will keep it
well below its initial value. Accordingly, we simulate four possible future scenarios with R3 = 1.1, 1.4,
1.7 and 2 after t3 = 130 days. Regarding τ, we inspect four possible cases for t > 130 days, upon the
opening of Beirut airport, and the expected increase in the number of travellers entering the country.
We simulate the effect of τ multiplied by 2, 3 and 4 in comparison to the previous rate of arrivals, and
its consequences on the cumulative number of infected cases.

2.2. The RI model
In this section, we adopt an alternative approach, the RI model, which exploits the available daily
data of infections and recoveries to forecast progression of the disease. Here we implement a variation
of the repeated iterations method proposed in [29]. We denote the active infected daily values by Ii
where i is the index of days and i ∈ [1, n]. We use the last m values of Ii to determine the average
arithmetic gross rate in the last m days as
!
n
1 X
Ii
Ga =
−1
m i=n−m+1 Ii−1

(2.9)

and the average geometric gross rate of the same set of data as
Gg =

Ii

! m1
(2.10)

Ii−m

Ga and Gg indicate the average rate of increase in the number of current infections during the last m
days, using arithmetic and geometric means. We forecast the progression of the number of infections
accordingly as follows
Ii+1 = Ii (1 + Ga )

(2.11)

using the arithmetic gross infection rate Ga or alternatively
Ii+1 = IiGg

(2.12)

using the geometric gross infection rate Gg .
To account for the removal of active cases, we define the death and recovery rates by p and 1 − p
respectively, the number of days need for recovery by h and the average number of days between
infection and death by d. This implies that on day (i + 1), the number of deaths will be p (Ii−d − Ii−d−1 )
where (Ii−d − Ii−d−1 ) represents the number of people who caught the virus d days ago. Similarly, the
number of people recovered would be proportional to the number of people who caught the virus h
days ago and is given by (1 − p) (Ii−h − Ii−h−1 ). The values of p and h vary in the literature and in the
available data from the country under consideration. To simulate the available data from Lebanon, we
take p = 0.04, h = 20 days and d = 24 days. h is in accordance with the average period of recovery
taken in the STEIR model used before, and p and d are discussed in available literature [29].
Given the aforementioned parameters, we define the recursive relation used in our forecast as
follows
(Ii+1 )net = Ii+1 − p (Ii−d − Ii−d−1 ) − (1 − p) (Ii−h − Ii−h−1 )

(2.13)

where (Ii+1 )net is the net number of infected people on day (i + 1). In every iteration, we use the
available data up to the day under consideration, estimate the number of infections on the next day,
and reevaluate Ga and Gg accordingly, hence recursively predicting the progression of the rate and
the number of active infected cases. We will consider m = 14 previous days, and forecast the next
upcoming 14 days as well. The interesting feature of the RI model is that as new daily data is revealed,
we update our daily future forecast, hence have a new 14 day future expectation every day.

Figure 2. Cumulative number of infections according to the STEIR model in Lebanon, with
appropriate parameterization with R0 = 5.6 for the first 32 days, R1 = 0.52 for the next 63
days and R2 = 1.1 until day 130. The actual cases are represented in black and the predicted
cumulative infections are in brown.

The average gross rate G (the arithmetic rate Ga or the geometric rate Gg ) is a dynamic quantity
and it is contingent on the promptness and severity of public policies of isolation, curfews and social
distancing as well as on the degree of individual commitment and personal preventive efforts e.g.
sanitation, use of face masks, etc. For this end, we consider several scenarios to predict the progression
of G in relation to SDM. Furthermore, we conduct the simulations using both Ga , Gg , the maximum
value of G attained in the previous m days, and possible increases or decreases of those rates.
3. Results
3.1. STEIR
In the parameterization of the STEIR model based on the cases reported in Lebanon, we find that
the initial value of the reproductive transmission factor is remarkably high at R0 = 5.6. However, it
significantly decreases to R1 = 0.52 at t1 = 32 days, before rising moderately to R2 = 1.1 at t2 = 90 days
following a partial relaxation of SDM. This parameterization provides an accurate fit of the registered
cases for the first 130 days. In addition to the absence of any SDM, a relatively high value of R0 could
be attributed to late reporting or under reporting of the early cases, hence the fast surge of registered
results during the first few days of testing. R0 here reflects the fast pace of spread of the disease in
the early days before implementing social distancing measures. The rapid fall of the rate from R0
to R1 occurs after the implementation and the social commitment to mitigation measures, hence the
rapid decrease in the number of daily infections and the slow increase in the cumulative number of
infections. The significantly low rate of R1 sharply diminishes the number of new infections, and the
curve of the cumulative number of infections (Figure 2) starts flattening out slowly, before its new rise
when the SDM are eased.

Figure 3. The reproduction transmission factor R(t) as a function of time t in days. It starts
at R0 = 5.6 then falls down at t = 32 days to R1 = 0.52 after strong mitigation measures, then
rises to R2 = 1.1 at t = 90 days. At t = 130 days, we inspect four possible scenarios of R3
corresponding to different levels of relaxation of mitigation measures, with numerical values
equal to 1.1, 1.4, 1.7 and 2 in black, brown, blue and red respectively.

However, if the measures are relaxed at a time t3 = 130 days, we expect an increase in the
reproductive rate from R2 to a another constant value R3 . The exact value of R3 will still depend on the
extent of relaxation and the public commitment to SDM. We consider here four possible values of R3
(Figure 3): continued partial mitigation measures with R3 = R2 = 1.1, a weakly higher relaxation with
R3 = 1.4, while more public social interaction and moderate relaxation has R3 = 1.7. Finally, we
investigate R3 = 2 which corresponds to a wider relaxation of measures that yet coincides with
self-awareness and individual efforts, hence preventing the return to the initial rate R0 .
We find that the cumulative number of infections will rise again at a higher pace as depicted in
Figure 4 even for the lowest increase in R3 . The number of cumulative infections could reach a total
varying between 4491 to more than 7042 infections in a period of 50 days, depending on the extent
of relaxation. A constant level of SDM of R2 would lead to a total of 3697 infections over the same
period. Moreover, we find that even for the low constant value of R3 , an increase in the flow of
incoming travelers would drive the number of infectious cases upward, depending on the rate of travel
over the period of the posterior 50 days (Figure 5). More precisely, the simulation of the first 130 days
with absolute closure of the airport and no incoming travelers shows that the cumulative number of
infections would have reached 948 instead of the 1778 registered cases on June 30.
This also suggests that the disease can rapidly spread again once the measures are relaxed, at a
pace contingent on the degree of relaxation of the measures. A combination of loosened measures and
a higher rate of travel arrivals would trigger a stronger second phase of infection. These results are
numerically specific to Lebanon, but they can be naturally generalized, and they suggest that a second
outbreak of COVID-19 infections would be inevitable in absence or weakening of within as well as
cross-country measures.

Figure 4. Cumulative number of infections with different possible SDM relaxation scenarios
after t = 130 days. The figure represents a forecast with R3 = 1.1, 1.4, 1.7 and 2, plotted in
black, brown, blue and red respectively in correspondence with Figure 3. It shows that the
number of infections can still grow exponentially once the measures are relaxed.
3.2. RI model
The arithmetic and geometric means proposed in equations (2.9) and (2.10) assume that all the SDM
will remain unchanged over the m subsequent days under consideration. Nevertheless, this might not
be the case. In order to take into account possible changes we consider the following scenarios that we
simulate in Figure 6:
1. We determine the arithmetic and the geometric means of the last 14 days and the corresponding
future forecasts are plotted in brown and black respectively. It is clear that with the rate infection
registered in Lebanon, and with more people recovered, the number of currently infected people
would slowly increase during the upcoming couple of weeks, and the geometric and arithmetic
means considered lead to very similar forecasts.
2. The infection rate decreases by an absolute value of 2% and the number of recovered is also on
the rise; hence, the total number of active cases decreases faster.
3. The rate of progression is defined as the maximum of the rates of increase recorded in the past
fourteen days
n
o
Gmax = Max Gg i−(m−1) , Gg i−(m−2) , ....Gg i
The number of active cases would witness a steep increase despite of recoveries and deaths.
4. The mean rate of infection increases by an absolute rate of 1%, and the number of currently
infected people would rise quickly despite recoveries or deaths from previous cases.
Similarly to the forecasts obtained using the STEIR model, the different scenarios are contingent on
the imposed governmental measures as well as on public behavior and social distancing. If precautions

Figure 5. Cumulative number of infections with four possible travel influx scenarios after
t = 130 days. The figure represents a forecast with R3 = 1.1 and τ multiplied by 2, 3 and 4,
plotted in black, pink, green and red respectively. The increase in international travel influx
to the country leads to a rapid increase in the spread of the infection.

are diminished, the number of infections will be on the rise again according to scenarios 3 or 4. The
continued enforcement of measures would lead to scenario 1 or more optimistically scenario 2 in case
of severe SDM and perhaps the resumption of a countrywide lockdown (Figure 6).
4. Discussions
The low infection rate recorded in the second month of the COVID-19 spread in Lebanon could
likely be attributed to public commitment to social distancing and the strict mitigation measures
imposed. Another factor that could have affected this outcome is the number and extent of distribution
of tests undertaken.
To address this issue, we compare the number of daily tests conducted per million residents in
Lebanon, with that of several other countries that witnessed stronger spreads like Italy, USA, Iran and
Turkey. We find that the percentage of people tested in Lebanon is similar to that in Iran, and tends to
rise with time but it is significantly less than the other countries as shown in Figure 7. This suggests
that the number of detected infections is possibly lower than the actual number of cases.
Furthermore, we check the ratio of the cumulative number of infections with respect to the
cumulative numbers of tests conducted. This criterion would give the rate of infected out those of
tested, hence eliminates the uncertainty related to under-testing. An examination of the publically
available data reveals that the cumulative rate of infection among those who were tested in Lebanon
was 1.37% on June 24th, 2020, compared to 8.17% in the USA, 4.63% in Italy, 6.21% in Turkey and
14.04% in Iran [2]. This is an assertion that the low rate of infection is more related to the mitigation
measures applied in the country, as rates in more affected countries are larger by several orders of
magnitude.

Figure 6. Number of currently infected people according to the RI model. The colored
lines represent the progression of the number of currently infected people in the next 14 days
according to five possible scenarios. The lower pink line corresponds to an absolute decrease
of 2% in the current rate of infection. The middle black and brown lines almost coincide
and they correspond to the continuation of the current geometric and arithmetic average rate
of infection. The red line represents a progression with a rate corresponding to the maximal
attained daily rate of the last 14 days, while the upper green line corresponds to an absolute
increase of 1% in current average rate.

On the other hand, the relaxation of measures and the rise of the reproductive rate of infections due
to increased interaction could reinstate a high rate of infections within a couple of weeks as forecasted
in Figure 4 and Figure 6. This is confirmed by the simulations conducted based both on the STEIR and
the RI models. The aforementioned models both forecast a resumption of a quick spread of the disease
and an increase in the number of infected people once the SDM are reduced or abandoned, and once
the inflow of travelers commences and increases. We note that the RI model, by construction, already
accounts for all infected cases, whether residents or travellers, but it only allows a projection for a short
term future behavior of infectious spread.
Our data also depicts that the mean age of infected individuals has fallen from 43.8 years to
36.7 years old between April 8 until June 30, 2020, which might have been generated by the travel
inflows during this period.
Under all circumstances, the continued SDM and travel restrictions are essential to keep COVID-19
under control [43] until the introduction of effective medications or vaccines, which is estimated to
take at least between 12 to 18 months [44], despite ongoing medical and clinical research around the
globe [45].

5. Conclusion
This paper presented two different models used in the simulation of the spread of infectious
diseases which are the STEIR model and the RI model. We developed the STEIR model, a novel
parameterization of the reproductive rate of infection, an improved RI model and adjusted all relevant
parameters to fit the available data from Lebanon. We analyzed in detail the current spread and
different forecasts for potential progressions. We found out that the rate of infection and the number
of infected people fell down quickly due to the rapid fall in the reproductive number R due to strong
mitigation measures. However, relaxing the measures, partially lifting the travel ban and the
resumption of social activity and interaction would swiftly put the infections on a rapid rise again,
thus reversing the temporary success in limiting the spread of COVID-19.
The results obtained can be further extended in different directions. At the theoretical level, the
suggested models can be enhanced and generalized to include other within and cross-country features
of the progression of pandemics. Furthermore, the findings can be exploited to draw policies and
establish appropriate measures to limit the spread of the disease.
