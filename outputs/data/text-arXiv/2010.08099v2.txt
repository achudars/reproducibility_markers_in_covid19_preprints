Abstract
Exploiting the SIQR model for COVID-19, I show that the wavy infection curve in
Japan is the result of fluctuation of policy on isolation measure imposed by the government
and obeyed by citizens. Assuming the infection coefficient be a two-valued function of
the number of daily confirmed new cases, I show that when the removal rate of infected
individuals is between these two values, the wavy infection curve is self-organized. On the
basis of the infection curve, I classify the outbreak of COVID-19 into five types and show
that these differences can be related to the relative magnitude of the transmission coefficient
and the quarantine rate of infected individuals.

1 Introduction
Since November 2019, the pandemic COVID-19 is still expanding in the world. The time
dependence of the number of daily confirmed new cases, which I call an infection curve for
simplicity, shows clearly a wavy structure in some countries like USA, Japan, Luxembourg and
Sweden [1]. Since the period of the wave is much shorter than that of the wave observed in the
Spanish flu in 1918-1920, which is believed to be the result of virus mutated while travelling
around the globe, there must be a different origin of the wavy infection curve of COVID-19. Besides the wavy infection curve, there are several different types of the infection curve observed
in each country in the past 8 months.
Epidemic oscillations have been investigated on the basis of compartmental models [2, 3].
Most of approaches attributed the oscillation to a sinusoidal time dependence of parameters
of the model. Oscillations in SIR models have also been discussed by evolving networks [4]
1

and asynchronous probabilistic cellular automaton [5]. Recently, Greer et al [6] proposed a
simple dynamical model with timevarying births and deaths to explain sustained periodicity of
epidemics like smallpox. These approaches may not be appropriate to COVID-19 since (1) there
are strong effects of measures including social-distancing on the outbreak, (2) presymptomatic
and asymptomatic patients are infectious and (3) these patients can be identified and quarantined
by PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) test.
The transmission coefficient of the virus from an infected individual to a susceptible individual depends on the trait of the virus as well as the frequency of social contact. Depending on
the infection status, a government imposes a strong measure or a moderate request of lockdown
and citizens reduce social contact among them voluntarily, which introduces fluctuation of the
transmission coefficient.
In this paper, I investigate various infection curves on the basis of SIQR model, focusing
on the fluctuation of the transmission coefficient which depends on the infection status. In Sec.
2, I first analyze the wavy infection curve of COVID-19 in Japan and show that it can well be
fitted by a transmission coefficient depending on the infection status. In Sec. 3, I investigate a
model society where the transmission coefficient takes two-values depending on the phase of the
outbreak and show that if the sum of quarantine and recovery rates is between these two values,
a wavy infection curve is self-organized. Analysis of various infection curves in apparent steady
states is presented in Sec. 4 where I classify them into five types which is related to the relative
strength of lockdown and quarantine measures. Results are discussed in Sec. 5.

2 Wavy infection curve in Japan
2.1 Model
In the SIQR model[7, 8, 9], population are separated into four compartments; susceptible individuals, infected individuals at large (will be called infecteds for simplicity), quarantined
patients in hospitals or at home who are no longer infectious in the community and recovered
(and died) patients. The population in each compartment are denoted by S, I, Q and R, respectively, and the total population is given by N(= S + I + Q + R). The basic equations for the
time evolution of the populations are given by a set of ordinary differential equations.

where t is the time. The term βS NI denotes the net rate at which infections spread, where β is a
transmission coefficient determined by lockdown measure including social-distancing and selfisolation of people and by the trait of virus. Infected individuals at large, regardless of whether
they are symptomatic or asymptomatic, are quarantined at a per capita rate q and become noninfectious to the population. The quarantine rate is determined by the government policy on
PCR test. Quarantined patients recover at a per capita rate γ ′ (where 1/γ ′ is the average time it
takes for recovery) and infected individuals at large become non-infectious at a per capita rate
γ (where 1/γ is the average time that an infected patient at large is capable of infecting others).
It is apparent that Eqs. (1) ∼ (4) guarantee the conservation of population N = S + I + Q + R.
At the end of November 2020, the total number of infected, quarantined and recovered
people is much smaller than the entire population in any countries, and thus the pandemic can
be regarded as in its early stage far from the stage of herd immunization. Therefore, I can
assume that I + Q + R << N is satisfied and S = N − (I + Q + R) ≃ N. Then the basic
equation governing the time evolution of the number of infecteds is written as
dI
= βI − qI − γI ≡ λI I,
dt

(5)

where the net rate of change of the number of infecteds is denoted as
λI = β − q − γ

(6)

which determines the short-term behavior of the number of infecteds. The number of infecteds
increases when λI > 0 and decreases when λI < 0.
It is straightforward to obtain the solution to Eq. (5):
I(t) = I(0) exp(

Z

λI (t′ )dt′ ),

(7)

where I(0) is the initial number of infecteds.

2.2 Analysis of the infection curve in Japan
The observed data for the outbreak of COVID-19 is the daily confirmed new cases ∆Q(t) ≡ qI,
which is given by a convolution of the incubation period distribution function ψ(t) and the
number of infecteds I(t). Therefore ∆Q(t) can be expressed as
∆Q(t) ∝

Z

t

ψ(t − t′ )I(t′ )dt′ .

(8)

Since the incubation period distribution is a well behaved function with a single peak [15, 16],
the convolution can be evaluated by the saddle-point method of integration and it is given by[8]
∆Q(t) ∝

2π
ψ(τ )3/2 I(t − τ ),
|ψ ′′ (τ )|

(9)

2

where τ is a characteristic time representing the peak position of ψ(t) and ψ ′′ (t) = d dtψ(t)
2 .
Therefore, defining λ(t) ≡ λI (t − τ ), I assume that the infection curve can be written as
∆Q(t) = ∆Q(t0 ) exp(

Z

t

t0

λ(t′ )dt′ ),

(10)

and redefine β(t) and q(t) so that λ(t) can be written as λ(t) = β(t) − q(t) − γ.
The first wave of the outbreak of COVID-19 in various countries has been analyzed on the
basis of Eq. (10), where ∆Q(t) is approximated by a piece-wise simple exponential function
[8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14].
In order to fit the infection curve in Japan by Eq. (10), I first assume that γ is a constant
since no treatment could be given to infecteds and set γ = 0.04 [15, 16, 17].
Next, I assume that β(t) and q(t) change in time continuously between two values represented by a hyperbolic tangent function

The fitting procedure is as follows. First, I assumed that the quarantine rate satisfies q(0) =
0.02 and q(200) = 0.029, and transition occurs at tq = 10 with width dtq = 30 as given

Figure 1: The daily confirmed new cases ∆Q(t) in Japan from March 26 to November 20, 2020.
The solid curve is a fitting by the piece-wise hyperbolic tangent functions for the transmission
coefficient with parameters listed in Table 1.

by Eqs. (11) ∼ (13). Then, the transmission coefficient is assumed to be given by Eq. (11)
for t2i ≤ t ≤ t2i+2 with β(t2i ) = β2i and β(t2i+2 ) = β2i+2 and t2i+1 as the transition point
and dt2i+1 as the width of the transition (i = 0, 1, 2, . . .). Table 1 summarizes parameters
determining the time dependence of β(t) used for fitting in Fig. 1.
Figure 2(a) shows the time dependence of β(t), q(t) and λ(t) and Fig. 2(b) shows a parametric plot of β(t) as a function of ∆Q(t). It should be emphasized that the assignment of β
and q from λ is not unique since adding any amount to β and q at a given time does not change
λ. In the present study, I assumed that the time dependence of q is weak since the procedure
for the PCR test did show no drastic change in the period for identifying infected individuals at
large.

3 Self-organization of wavy infection curve
The time dependence of the transmission coefficient β(t) must be attributed to the attitude of
people to self-isolation under government policy and massive information from news media.
As Fig. 2(b) indicates, β(t) depends strongly on ∆Q(t). Therefore, I consider the transmission
coefficient be a function of ∆Q and d∆Q
, and I introduce a model country in which β is given

β(∆Q) =

when dt < 0 and ∆Qℓ ≤ ∆Q < ∆Qh ,
where βℓ < q + γ < βh is satisfied. Figure 3 (a) shows β(∆Q).
The infection curve for β(∆Q) given by Eq. (14) is shown in Fig. 3 (b), where I set
∆Q(0) = ∆Q0 = 10, ∆Qh = 100 and ∆Qℓ = 20, and βh = 0.15, βℓ = 0.05 and q = 0.05,
γ = 0.04. In this plot, ∆Qℓ is set to 0 after the third wave. The infection curve clearly shows
wavy nature. If ∆Qℓ is kept at the same value after the third wave, the wavy infection curve

continues. If β(∆Q) is given by a continuous function, then the infection curve becomes a
smooth function as in Fig. 1.

4 Assessment of measures
According to the data available at Coronavirus Resource Center, Johns Hopkins University [1],
the steady behavior of the infection curve in each country up to November 19th seems to be
classified into the following five types:
Type I The infection curve keeps increasing, like Jordan, Ukraine and Morocco.
Type II After some number of peaks, the infection curve increases again like Type I. This is
seen in Japan, USA, Russia, Canada and many European countries. This can be changed
to Type III by some measures.
Type III The infection curve shows oscillation like in UAE, Finland and Ireland. Countries in
this type move easily to Type II unless strong measures are introduced to move to Type
V.
Type IV Infection curve is characterized by a sharp peak followed by more or less constant
infection for a long time. This infection curve is seen in Equador, Kuwait and Honduras.
Countries in this type usually move to either Type II or Type III, though they could move
to Type V.

the model transmission coefficient.

Type V After a small peak, few new cases are observed like in China, Taiwan, Thailand and
Viet Nam.
As discussed in Sec. 3, the relative magnitude of β and q + γ must be responsible for the
structure of the infection curve. Here, keeping q + γ constant, I discuss the relative magnitude
of these parameters for different types of infection curve. It should be emphasized that the
difference β − (q + γ) determines the infection curve. For the sake of simplicity, I fix q + γ and
attribute all effects to change in β. It is possible to discuss in the same way by changing q with
a fixed β.
For Type I infection curve, β > q + γ is satisfied (Fig. 4(a)) and thus the infection curve
keeps increasing. The infection curve will reach eventually its maximum and start to decline
because of the non-linear term SI/N in Eqs. (1) and (2). The Spanish flu belongs to this type.
Type II infection curve will be realized when a strong lockdown measure is introduced at
the outbreak and it is lifted in fear of economic break down (Fig. 4(b)). After a little peak and
some length of tail, the infection curve will follow the same trend as Type I.
Wavy infection curve (Type III, Fig. 4 (c)) has already been discussed in Sec. 3.
Infection curve of Type IV is characterized by a fixed point in the β - ∆Q plane which is
reached after the first peak (Fig. 4(d)), and ∆Qℓ determines the size of the daily confirmed new
cases.
Type V infection curve represents the most efficient measure; the transmission coefficient is
brought below q + γ (or q is increased) so that β < q + γ is satisfied, and the measure is kept.
The trajectory in the β - ∆Q plane has a fixed point near ∆Q = 0 as shown in Fig. 4(e).

5 Discussion
In this paper, I discussed the infection curves of COVID-19 observed in many countries and
showed that the infection curve in an apparent steady state can be classified into five types. In
particular, a wavy infection curve can be self-organized due to change in self-isolation and/or
quarantine measures making β above or below q + γ. It is shown that these different infection curves are caused by relative strength of lockdown measure and quarantine measure. It
should be emphasized that the infection curve is determined by the interplay between tranmission of the virus and quarantine of patients, and thus unless loosening of lockdown measures is
compensated by strengthening of quarantine measures, the infection will continue to expand.
It will be possible to formulate the optimum policy specific to the country for controlling
the outbreak on the basis of the present theoretical framework, if the cost function and the aim
of policy in each country are given [18].
The pandemic in countries whose infection curve is of Type I or Type II will stamp out
when sufficient number of population get immunized. According to percolation theory [19], the
condition for the herd immunity is that the fraction of immunized individuals is larger than a
critical value
4.5
pc = 1 −
,
(15)
nβ
where β is the transmission coefficient and n is the average number of people with whom an
infected individual meets while it is infectious. The critical value depends on β and n and it
could be as large as 50 ∼ 80 %. Therefore, it could take much longer time before the herd
immunity is realized in any countries in the world.
