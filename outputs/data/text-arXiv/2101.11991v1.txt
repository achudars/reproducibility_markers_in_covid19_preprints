Abstract
In 2020, Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency reported three rounds
of surveys on seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) antibodies in South Korea. We analyze the seroprevalence surveys
using a Bayesian method with an informative prior distribution on the seroprevalence parameter, and the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic test. We construct the informative prior using the posterior distribution obtained from the clinical evaluation data based on the plaque reduction neutralization test. The constraint
of the seroprevalence parameter induced from the known confirmed cornonavirus
2019 cases can be imposed naturally in the proposed Bayesian model. We also prove
that the confidence interval of the seroprevalence parameter based on the Rao’s test
can be the empty set, while the Bayesian method renders a reasonable interval estimator. As of the 30th of October 2020, the 95% credible interval of the estimated
SARS-CoV-2 positive population does not exceed 307, 448, approximately 0.6% of
the Korean population.

Introduction

In December 2019, the Chinese government reported a cluster of pneumonia patients of
unknown cause in Wuhan, China. It was found that an unknown betacoronavirus causes
the disease (Zhu et al.; 2020). The Coronaviridae Study Group (CSG) of the International
Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses has named the virus as severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), due to the similarity to SARS-CoV (Gorbalenya
et al.; 2020). The World Health Organization (WHO) also has named the disease caused
by SARS-CoV-2 as COVID-19, short for coronavirus disease 2019 (The World Health
Organization; 2020a). As of January 10, 2021, over 90, 000, 000 people in the world are
confirmed positive for COVID-19, and there are over 68, 000 confirmed cases in South
Korea.
Most statistical approaches use the number of confirmed cases to assess the spread
of infectious diseases in a population. However, the number of confirmed cases does not
include those that are infected but not detected. A seroprevalence survey can be an alternative in this case. The seroprevalence is the number of people with antibodies to the virus
in a population. The WHO (2020b) proposes to analyze seroprevalence surveys for the inference on the spread of a novel coronavirus. Seroprevalence surveys have been conducted
in many countries, and the results are collected in Serotracker, a global seroprevalence
dashboard (Arora et al.; 2020). According to the recent update on December 12, 2020,
Serotracker provides the survey results of 56 countries based on 491 studies.
The seroprevalence survey data can be analyzed under either the assumption that the
diagnostic tests used in the survey are 100% accurate or the assumption that the tests are
not 100% accurate. We will term these assumptions as the accuracy assumption and the
inaccuracy assumption, respectively. Under the accuracy assumption, Song et al. (2020)
and Noh et al. (2020) analyzed outpatient data sets in southwestern Seoul and Daegu,
respectively, and estimated the seroprevalence. Although the statistical models are simpler
under the accuracy assumption, the estimates can be biased unless the assumption is met
as pointed out in Diggle (2011). Under the inaccuracy assumption, Diggle (2011) proposed

2

a corrected prevalence estimator and Silveira et al. (2020) constructed a confidence interval
of the seroprevalence using a resampling method. In an analysis of a seroprevalence survey
data of southern Brazil, Silveira et al. (2020) showed that confidence intervals can be {0},
which is hardly reliable. See Supplementary Table 2 in Silveira et al. (2020). In Section 3,
we also prove that the confidence interval constructed from the Rao’s test using the duality
theorem (Bickel and Doksum; 2015) can be the empty set. These examples show that the
frequentist confidence intervals of the seroprevalence under the inaccuracy assumption
can be unreliable.
In this paper, we propose a Bayesian method under the inaccuracy assumption and
apply the proposed method to the seroprevalence surveys of the South Korean population
conducted in 2020 (Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency; 2021). We use the
posterior distribution obtained from the Bayesian model of the clinical evaluation data
(Kohmer et al.; 2020) as the informative prior distribution of the sensitivity and specificity
on the diagnostic test.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we describe the
seroprevalence surveys of SARS-CoV-2 motivating this work and the plaque reduction
neutralization test for detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. In Section 3, we conduct a
frequentist analysis and discuss the phenomenon of empty confidence sets. In Section 4,
we propose a Bayesian method for the seroepidemiological survey that gives nonempty
interval estimates, and analyze the seroprevalence surveys of the South Korean population
using the proposed Bayesian method. We conclude the paper with a discussion section.

of a serology test

2.1

Seroepidemiological surveys of SARS-CoV-2 in South Korea

Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) conducted three rounds of seroprevalence surveys of SARS-CoV-2 for South Korean population in 2020. KDCA used
3

the sets of samples collected in the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (KNHNES), which is a regular national survey to investigate the health and nutritional status of South Koreans since 1998 (Kwon et al.; 2014), as the samples of the
seroprevalance surveys. KDCA performed a serology test for SARS-CoV-2 to the residual
serums, and the test results (Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency; 2021) are
summarised in Table 1. In Table 1, the periods during which the samples are collected
are also given.

Prevention Agency; 2021). The column of the announcement date represents dates when

Clinical evaluation of plaque reduction neutralization test
for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies

When KDCA performed a serology test for SARS-CoV-2, KDCA used their in-house
plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). In the PRNT, serum samples are tested for
their neutralization capacity against SARS-CoV-2. To estimate the sensitivity and specificity of PRNT methods for SARS-CoV-2 empirically, we use a set of clinical evaluation
data (Table 2) which is conducted by Kohmer et al. (2020).

Maximum likelihood estimator and a confidence interval

Under the inaccuracy assumption, we specify a statistical model for seroprevalance surveys, and present the maximum likelihood estimator and a confidence interval of the
seroprevalance. We assume that the sensitivity and specificity of serology test are fixed
values for the estimator and the confidence interval. Note that the sensitivity and specificity are the probabilities that the positive has the positive test result and the negative
has the negative test result, respectively.
We define seroprevalance parameter, θ, as the proportion of those who have antibodies
against SARS-CoV-2 in the population. Let N be the number of samples of seroprevalence
survey, X be the number of test-positive samples by serology test, and p+ and p− denote
the sensitivity and specificity of the serology test, respectively. We assume X is generated
from the binomial distribution:
X ∼ Binom (N, θp+ + (1 − θ)(1 − p− )) ,

(1)

where Binom(n, p) denotes the binomial distribution with parameters n ∈ N and p ∈
[0, 1]. When p+ and p− are known, the maximum likelihood estimator for θ is as follows.

if X ≥ N (1 − p− )
if X ≤ N p+
if N p+ < X < N (1 − p− ).

Note if the number of test-positive samples is small or large enough, the maximum likelihood estimator can be 0 or 1. This means that nobody or everybody in the population
has antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, which is hardly reliable.
We construct a confidence interval of θ from Rao’s test (Rao; 1948) using the duality
thoerem (Bickel and Doksum; 2015), and show that when X is too small or large, the
confidence interval can be the empty set. Let A(θ0 ) = [lθ0 , uθ0 ] be the 100(1 − α)% acceptance interval of the Rao’s test under the null hypothesis H0 : θ = θ0 . By the duality
theorem S(X) = {θ0 ∈ [0, 1] : X ∈ A(θ0 )} is a 100(1 − α)% confidence interval for θ.
Theorem 3.1 gives the acceptance interval, A(θ0 ), and the condition that the confidence
interval S(X) is the empty set.
Theorem 3.1 Consider the model (1).
(a) The 100(1 − α)% acceptance region of the test
H0 : θ = θ0 vs H1 : θ 6= θ0
by the Rao’s Score test is given as
[lθ0 , uθ0 ] = [N θ0∗ − {N χ20.05 (1)θ0∗ (1 − θ0∗ )}1/2 , N θ0∗ + {N χ20.05 (1)θ0∗ (1 − θ0∗ )}1/2 ],
where θ0∗ = θ0 p+ + (1 − θ0 )(1 − p− ) and χ2α (1) is (1 − α)100% quantile of chi-square
distribution with 1 degree of freedom.

(b) If

θ0 ∈[0,1]

the 100(1 − α)% confidence interval S(X) = {θ0 ∈ [0, 1] : X ∈ A(θ0 )} is the empty
set.

which proves (a).
(b) If
X < inf lθ0 or X > sup uθ0 ,
θ0 ∈[0,1]

θ0 ∈[0,1]

then X ∈
/ A(θ0 ) for all θ0 ∈ [0, 1]. It implies the confidence interval of X is the empty set.
This completes the proof. 
The intuitive reason for the empty confidence interval is as follows. The set of sampling
distributions for X is
{Binom(N, θ) : (1 − p− ) ≤ θ ≤ p+ } .
7

When X/N is smaller (larger) than 1 − p− (p+ ), the probability that X is observed is
small for every sampling distribution in the set. This makes test decisions rejected for
every null hypothesis. Thus, the extreme X implies p− and p+ are doubtful.
For the three rounds of surveys given in Table 1, we show all the maximum likelihood
estimators are zero and the confidence intervals are the empty set. We assume the fixed
(p+ , p− ) to be (42/45, 34/35), which is calculated from the clinical evaluation data (Table
2) and formula (r++ /r·+ , r−− /r·− ) according to the notation in Table 3. Based on equation
(2), all the maximum likelihood estimatiors are zero, since values of N (1 − p− ) are 42.9,
41.1 and 39.4 which are all larger than the observed Xs. The confidence intervals are the
empty set since values of inf lθ are 30.2, 28.8 and 27.3 which satisfy condition (3) in
θ∈[0,1]

Theorem 3.1.

A Bayesian method with informative prior distributions

We propose a Bayesian method that avoids the empty confidence set problem. For the
Bayesian analysis of model (1), we assign prior distributions on θ, p+ and p− . According
to KNHNES design, the parameter θ refers to the seroprevalence in the population that
includes those who have been confirmed to be tested positive for COVID-19 by the government. Thus, it is reasonable to assume θ is larger than the proportion of the confirmed
cases, and we choose the following constrained prior distribution on parameter θ:
π(θ) ∝ (θ)−1/2 (1 − θ)−1/2 I(θ > θ̃),

(4)

where π(θ) is the density function of the prior distribution on θ, and θ̃ is the total number
of confirmed cases divided by the number of the population. Note that the constrained
prior distribution (4) is constructed by constraining Jefferey’s prior or reference prior
distribution for binomial parameter (Yang and Berger; 1996).
To construct prior distributions on p+ and p− , we use the posterior distribution on the
sensitivity and specificity obtained from a clinical evaluation of the serology test. In the
8

clinical evaluation, we consider that the serology test is applied to samples of which the
true states are known. The true state of a sample refers to whether the sample has the
antibodies in reality. The data from the clinical evaluation is then represented as Table
3.
Table 3: Data format for clinical evaluation when the true states of samples are known.

For the analysis of the clinical evaluation (Table 3), we specify a statistical model using
the binomial distribution as
r++ ∼ Binom(r·+ , p+ )
r−− ∼ Binom(r·− , p− ).
By applying the Jefferey’s prior (or reference prior) to the binomial parameters p+ and
p− , we obtain the densitiy functions of posterior distributions, π ∗ (p+ | r++ , r·+ ) and
π ∗ (p− | r−− , r·− ), as
π ∗ (p+ | r++ , r·+ ) ∝ pBinom (r++ | r·+ , p+ )(p+ )1/2 (1 − p+ )1/2
π ∗ (p− | r−− , r·− ) ∝ pBinom (r−− | r·− , p− )(p− )1/2 (1 − p− )1/2 ,

(5)

where pBinom (· | n, p) is the densitiy function of the binomial distribution Binom(n, p) for
n ∈ N and p ∈ [0, 1]. Note that the Jefferey’s prior is a conjugate prior for the likelihood
function pBinom (· | n, p). Thus, the density function of the posterior distributions are
calculated as
π ∗ (p+ | r++ , r·+ ) ∝ (p+ )(r++ +1/2) (1 − p+ )(r·+ −r++ +1/2)
π ∗ (p+ | r−− , r·− ) ∝ (p− )(r−− +1/2) (1 − p− )(r·− −r−− +1/2) .
9

Finally, we use the posterior distributions to construct the informative prior distributions
on p+ , p− of model (1). That is, we set
π(p+ ) ∝ (p+ )(r++ +1/2) (1 − p+ )(r·+ −r++ +1/2)
π(p− ) ∝ (p− )(r−− +1/2) (1 − p− )(r·− −r−− +1/2) ,
where π(p+ ) and π(p− ) are the densitiy functions of the informative prior distributions.
We analyze the survey data (Table 1) using the proposed Bayesian method. Let θ1 , θ2
and θ3 be the seroprevalance parameters for each survey. We assign the constrained prior
distributions on θ1 , θ2 and θ3 as equation (4). When calculating the percentage of the
confirmed cases, we use the cumulative confirmed cases at the last dates in the collection
periods of the sets of samples, and let them denoted by θ̃1 , θ̃2 and θ̃3 . We construct
informative prior distributions on p+ and p− using the clinical evaluation of the PRNT
for SARS-CoV-2 performed by Kohmer et al. (2020). By applying the clinical evaluation
data (Table 2) to equation (5), we obtain the informative prior distributions as
p+ ∼ Beta(42.5, 3.5)
p− ∼ Beta(34.5, 1.5),
where Beta(α, β) denotes the beta distribution with the density function of
f (x) = R 1
0

xα−1 (1 − x)β−1
xα−1 (1 − x)β−1 dx

.

Collecting the prior distributions and three rounds of seroprevalance survey results, we

10

construct the generative model as
X1 | θ1 , p+ , p− ∼ Binom(N1 , θ1 p+ + (1 − θ1 )(1 − p− ))
X2 | θ2 , p+ , p− ∼ Binom(N2 , θ2 p+ + (1 − θ2 )(1 − p− ))
X3 | θ3 , p+ , p− ∼ Binom(N3 , θ3 p+ + (1 − θ3 )(1 − p− ))
p+ ∼ Beta(42.5, 3.5)
p− ∼ Beta(34.5, 1.5)
π(θ1 ) ∝ (θ1 )−1/2 (1 − θ1 )−1/2 I(θ1 ≥ θ̃1 )
π(θ2 ) ∝ (θ2 )−1/2 (1 − θ2 )−1/2 I(θ2 ≥ θ̃2 )
π(θ3 ) ∝ (θ3 )−1/2 (1 − θ3 )−1/2 I(θ3 ≥ θ̃3 ),
where (Ni , Xi ) is the pair of the number of samples and the number of test-positive
samples of ith seroprevalance survey for i ∈ {1, 2, 3}.
For inference, we generate posterior samples using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
sampling method. Specifically, we generate 4,000 posterior samples through running 4
Markov chains with different initial values, where each chain has 1,000 samples after a
burn-in period of 1,000 samples. We implement the MCMC algorithm with Stan (Carpenter et al.; 2017). We extract the posterior samples of θ1 , θ2 and θ3 , and multiply the
number of the population in 2020, 51, 829, 023 (Ministry of the Interior and Safety; 2021),
to the parameters. We then give the summary statistics of the multiplied posterior samples in Table 4. According to Table 4, the ratio of the posterior mean to the confirmed
cases ranges from 3.1 to 4.5, which represents the proportion of
[The total number of the infected]
.
[The total number of the detected]
Finally, we compare the result of the proposed Bayesian method with the cumulative number of confirmed cases and the result of statistical analysis under the accuracy
assumption. Under the accuracy assumption, we consider the statistical model
X ∼ Binom (N, θ) ,

instead of model (1). We use X/N as a point estimator for θ, and we construct a confidence
interval of θ by Clopper and Pearson (1934). As in the proposed Bayesian method, we
multipy the number of the population to the point estimator and the confidence interval.
The comparison is then represented in Figure 1. Figure 1 shows that the lower bounds of
interval estimation by the Bayesian method are larger than the number of confirmed cases
as expected, but the other does not satisfy the inequality condition. Each upper bound
of the interval estimations by the Bayesian method is smaller than the corresponding one
obtained under the accuracy assumption. Under the inaccuracy assumption, the Bayesian
method considers that test-positive cases may include false-negative cases, which is critical
when the test-positive number is small enough. Thus, the Bayesian method makes the
upper bounds shrink.

Discussion

In this article, we have proposed a Bayesian method with informative prior, which uses
the clinical evaluation results of the plaque reduction neutralization test for analyzing
data on the seroprevalence surveys in South Korea. We have compared the method with
the frequentist’s method under the inaccuracy assumption and the statistical analysis

under the accuracy assumption. The main advantages of the proposed method are two.
First, the method allows the constrained parameter space, which has an obvious lower
bound as the proportion of the cumulative confirmed cases. Second, when we consider the
inaccuracy assumption, the method can provide a practically corrected estimate contrary
to the frequentist’s method.
However, this study has a limitation. Each set of samples in the seroprevalence survey
does not cover all the regions in South Korea. In the first survey announced on the 9th of
July, the survey samples do not include those from the populations of several major cities
such as Daegu, Daejeon, and Sejong. Daegu particularly was the city of the first mass
outbreak in South Korea. The other surveys also do not cover all the cities. The second
survey samples do not include those from Ulsan, Busan, Jeonnam, and Jeju, and for the
third survey, Gwangju and Jeju are not covered.
