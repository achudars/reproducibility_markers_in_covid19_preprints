Abstract
The SIQR model is reformulated where compartments for infected and quarantined
are redefined so as to be appropriate to COVID-19, and exact properties of the model are
presented. It is shown that the maximum number of infected at large depends strongly on
the quarantine rate and that the quarantine measure is more effective than the lockdown
measure in controlling the pandemic. The peak of the number of quarantined patients
is shown to appear some time later than the time that the number of infected becomes
maximum. On the basis of the expected utility theory, a theoretical framework to find out an
optimum strategy in the space of lockdown measure and quarantine measure is proposed for
minimizing the maximum number of infected and for controlling the outbreak of pandemic
at its early stage.

1 Introduction
Since November 2019, the pandemic COVID-19 is still expanding in the world, infected of
which totals more than 15 million at 22 nd of July, 2020[1]. It is an important problem of sociophysics to construct a simple model by which one can understand the nature of the outbreak,
and to construct a theoretical framework for formulating the optimum strategy to control it.[2]

1

Epidemics can be considered to be a problem of physics concerning reaction and relaxation
processes and the simplest understanding of its outbreak can be provided by a mean field analysis. The SIR model[3] assumes three compartments (or species) in population, susceptible (S),
infected (I) and removed (R), and the infection is transferried from an infected individual to
a susceptible individual. The number of symptomatic patients, which is identical to the number of infected, decreases in the community by treatment and/or quarantine. The SIR model
is considered a standard model to explain the infection trajectory of ordinary epidemics like
influenza.
COVID-19 has unusual characteristics: (1) transmission of the virus by presymptomatic patients and (2) existence of asymptomatic infectious patients, and (3) patients, symptomatic or
asymptomatic, can be identified by PCR test. Because of these characteristics, the number of
infected cannot be obtained directly and the number of daily confirmed new cases and its time
dependence are the only essential observables. Therefore, COVID-19 showing these characteristics may not be represented properly by the SIR and the SEIR models which assume that the
number of patients is known and do not treat quarantined patients as a compartment.
The SIQR model [5, 6] is a compartmental model which represents a community by four
compartments, assuming an additional compartment of quarantined (Q), and describes the transmission process by a system of ordinary nonlinear differential equations. The SIQR model
seems to be appropriate to COVID-19 and it has been successfully applied in the analysis of the
early stage of the outbreak of COVID-19 in Italy[7], India[8, 9], Sweden[10] and Japan[11].
In this paper, I redefine the SIQR model so as to make it appropriate to COVID-19[11].
Namely, I classify patients into two groups; (1) infected patients at large (I) who can be in any
of three states, presymptomatic, symptomatic and asymptomatic and (2) quarantined patients
(Q) who are in a hospital or self-isolated at home and no longer infectious in the community. I
treat the number of daily confirmed new cases explicitly and consider the quarantine rate or the
2

fraction of infected at large put in a quarantine or self-isolation as a key parameter which can be
determined from the observation of the daily confirmed new cases. I also discuss the optimum
strategy for controlling the pandemic.
This paper is organized as follows. First, I explain in Sec. 2 the SIQR model and discuss
its relevancy to COVID-19. I also present the basic properties of the model, showing parameter dependence of the maximum number of infected. Section 3 considers the exact solution of
the SIQR model and shows the time dependence of various quantities including the number of
quarantined. A theoretical frame work for optimizing measures to control the outbreak is discussed in Sec. 4, where the expected utility theory[12] is exploited. The frame work is applied
for optimizing strategy for reducing the epidemic peak and for stamping out the epidemic as
fast as possible. Results are discussed in Sec. 5.

2 SIQR model and basic properties
2.1 Model
The basic concept of the SIQR model is identical to the chemical reaction, which can be described by rate equations. The dynamics of the SIQR model is given by the following set of
ordinary nonlinear differential equations:
dx
dt
dy
dt
dw
dt
dz
dt

= −βx(t)y(t),

(1)

= βx(t)y(t) − qy(t) − γy(t),

(2)

= qy(t) − γ ′ w(t),

(3)

= γy(t) + γ ′ w(t),

(4)

where t is the time, and x(t), y(t), w(t) and z(t) are the fractions of population (N) in each compartment, susceptible, infected at large, quarantined patients and recovered (and died) patients.
3

Here, I assumed that new patients immediately after they get infected cannot be quarantined
since the incubation period is long for COVID-19. The parameters of this model are a transmission coefficient β, quarantine rate of infected at large q, and recovery rates γ and γ ′ of infected
at large and quarantined, respectively. These parameters can be estimated from observations; β,
γ and γ ′ from epidemiological survey and q from the time dependence of the daily confirmed
new cases. Although time can be scaled by one of parametes, I use one day as a unit of time in
this paper so that ordinary citizens and policy makers can understand results without difficulties.
Infected at large, regardless whether they are symptomatic or asymptomatic, are quarantined
at a per capita rate q and become non-infectious in the community. Quarantined patients recover
at a per capita rate γ ′ (where 1/γ ′ is the average time it takes for recovery) and infected at large
become non-infectious at a per capita rate γ (where 1/γ is the average time that an infected
patient at large is capable of infecting others). It is apparent that Eqs. (1) ∼ (4) guaranteee the
conservation of population x(t) + y(t) + w(t) + z(t) = 1.
If one considers quarantined and recoverd together as removed, the set of differential equation is the same as the set of equations for the SIR model with removal rate of infected q + γ.
Since the value of q depends strongly on government policies and the only observable is the
number of quarantined patients ∆w(t) = qy(t) on each day, it is important to treat the quarantined and recovered patients separately in the analysis of the outbreak of COVID-19.
Figure 1 shows the elementary processes of the SIQR model.

Therefore, the set of Eqs. (1), (2) and (9) is identical to the basic equations of the SIR model as

parameters.

Figure 4 shows the time dependence of x(t), y(t), w(t) and z(t) for β = 0.4, q = 0.1 and
γ = γ ′ = 0.06. It is interesting to note that the number of quarantined patients w(t) takes its
maximum at some time later than the time that the number of infected y(t) becomes maximum.

The observable in COVID-19 is the daily confirmed new cases ∆w(t) = qy(t), which is
simply q-times smaller than y(t) as shown in Fig. 5.

(21)

These solution can also be obtained by setting x(t) = x0 = 1 in Eqs. (1) ∼ (4) and have been
used in the analysis of the outbreak of COVID-19 [7, 8, 9, 11].
The short-term solution indicates that the initial growth rate of the number of infected at
large is determined by
λ = β − q − γ.

(22)

In order to control the outbreak, a measure must be formulated to make the growth rate λ
negative under various restrictions in economic activities and medical care systems.

4 Optimum measure
4.1 General frame work
As shown in Fig. 4, the present model like the SIR model shows that the epidemic curve will
converge to an equilibrium state after several months, passing a maximum number of infected
which could be 15 ∼ 25 % of population depending on the value of parameters. This means that
if we wait the natural epidemic equilibrium, the number of causalities will become unacceptably large. In order to reduce the number of causalities, all governments in the world have been
struggling against COVID-19 with various measures. Lockdown and social distancing are measures to reduce the effective transmission coefficient β, but it has a severe damage on economic
activities. For COVID-19, quarantine measure including self-isolation has been employed in
many countries to increase the quarantine rate q.
Since γ in the SIQR model cannot be altered, β and q are the essential parameters which
can be modified by policy. I parameterize β as β = (1 − a)β0 where a represents the strength
of lockdown measure; a = 0 corresponds to no measure on social distancing and a = 1 denotes
complete lockdown. I consider a measure M = M(a, q) which is a function of a and q. The
10

transmission rate β0 can be determined from the growth rate of the epidemic at the earliest stage
when no measures are imposed.
I consider a cost function C(a, q) of a measure characterized by a and q which must be an
increasing function of a and q. The problem is to move M in a desired direction, making the
cost as small as possible. Namely, for a given M, an optimum set (a, q) minimizing the cost
is obtained which in turn determines the optimum trajectory in the (a, q) space. I introduce a
Lagrange multiplier µ and consider a function F (µ, a, q) defined by
F (µ, a, q) = C(a, q) − µ [M − M(a, q)] .

(23)

It is well known that the optimum value of C(a, q) is given by the solution to
∂F
∂a
∂F
∂q
∂F
∂µ

= 0,

(24)

= 0,

(25)

= 0.

(26)

In the following discussion, I consider a model cost function in an arbitrary unit[14]
q
C(a, q) = a + k
β0

.

(27)

Here, k is a parameter characterizing relative importance of measures. When k = 1 , both
measures cost equally. When k > 1, cost for medical treatment is larger than the economic
cost, and when k < 1, economic cost due to social distancing is larger than the medical cost.

4.2 Optimum measure to reduce the epidemic peak
As shown in Fig. 3, the epidemic peak and hence the number of quarantined strongly depend
on parameter a and q. Taking Eq. (8) as a measure, I set
M(a, q) = 1 −

q+γ
q+γ
q+γ
+
ln
.
(1 − a)β0 (1 − a)β0 (1 − a)β0

(28)

It is straightforward to find that the optimum trajectory (a∗ , q ∗ ) satisfies
a∗ (1 − a∗ )β02 = kq ∗ (q ∗ + γ).

(29)

Figure 6 shows the optimum strategy for k = 2, 1, 0.5.

4.3 Optimum measure to stamp out the epidemic
In this subsection, I discuss an optimum measure to stamp out the epidemic at the beginning of
the outbreak. The growth rate of the number of infected at large is given by Eq. (22) in the early
stage of the outbreak, and I set
M(a, q) = (1 − a)β0 − q − γ.

(30)

The aim of a measure is to bring the state from the region M(a, q) > 0 at (a = 0, q = 0) to
some region M(a, q) < 0.
It is straightforward to find that the optimum trajectory (a∗ , q ∗ ) satisfies
a∗ = k

5 Discussion
In this paper, I presented exact properties of the SIQR model relevant to COVID-19 in the entire
time span and in the early stage of the outbreak. In particular, I investigated dependence of the
outbreak on parameters, transmission coefficient and quarantine rate, which can be controlled
by measures. It is important to note that the peak of the number of quarantined patients w(t)
appears about 10 days later than the time that the number of infected y(t) becomes maximum,

for the choice of parameters used in Fig. 4. Within this model, the number of infected at large
y(t) can be estimated from the daily confirmed new cases ∆w(t), once the quarantine rate q is
obtained from the infection trajectory. I also discussed a theoretical framework for optimizing
measures to control the outbreak on the basis of the expected utility theory, when the social cost
is given by a function of the social distancing policy and the quarantine measure. The optimum
strategy depends on the aim; reducing the epidemic peak or accelerating the stamping out the
outbreak. It should be emphasized that a simple lockdown (a = 1) is not the optimum strategy.
Given the cost function and the aim of policy in each country, it will be possible to formulate
the optimum policy specific to the country for controlling the outbreak on the basis of the present
theoretical framework.
The SIQR model does not consider any memory effects of the epidemic like the incubation
period and the infectious period functions. It is an important future problem to include memory
effects of β and q in the SIQR model.
