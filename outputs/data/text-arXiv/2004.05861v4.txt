Abstract
In this paper, we present ArCOV-19, an Arabic
COVID-19 Twitter dataset that spans one year,
covering the period from 27th of January 2020
till 31st of January 2021. ArCOV-19 is the first
publicly-available Arabic Twitter dataset covering COVID-19 pandemic that includes about
2.7M tweets alongside the propagation networks of the most-popular subset of them (i.e.,
most-retweeted and -liked). The propagation
networks include both retweets and conversational threads (i.e., threads of replies). ArCOV19 is designed to enable research under several
domains including natural language processing, information retrieval, and social computing. Preliminary analysis shows that ArCOV19 captures rising discussions associated with
the first reported cases of the disease as they
appeared in the Arab world. In addition to the
source tweets and propagation networks, we
also release the search queries and languageindependent crawler used to collect the tweets
to encourage the curation of similar datasets.

Introduction

Twitter streams hundreds of millions of tweets
daily. In addition to being a medium for the spread
and consumption of news, it has been shown to
capture the dynamics of real-world events including the spread of diseases such as the seasonal
influenza (Kagashe et al., 2017) or more severe
epidemics like Zika (Vijaykumar et al., 2018),
Ebola (Roy et al., 2020), and H1N1 (McNeill et al.,
2016). Moreover, collective conversations on Twitter about an event can have a great influence on the
event’s outcomes, e.g., US 2016 presidential elections (Grover et al., 2019). Analyzing tweets about
an event, as it evolves, offers a great opportunity
to understanding its structure and characteristics,
informing decisions based on its development, and
anticipating its outcomes as represented in Twitter
and, more importantly, in the real world.

Since the first reported case of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) in China, in November 2019,
the COVID-19 topic has drawn the interest of many
Arab users over Twitter. Their interest, reflected
in the Arabic content on the platform, has reached
a peak after two months when the first case was
reported in the United Arab Emirates late in January 2020. This ongoing pandemic has, unsurprisingly, spiked discussions on Twitter covering a
wide range of topics such as general information
about the disease, preventive measures, procedures
and newly-enforced decisions by governments, upto-date statistics of the spread in the world, and
even the change in our daily habits and work styles.
In this work, we aim to support future research
on social media during this historical period of our
time by curating an Arabic dataset (ArCOV-19)
that exclusively covers tweets about COVID-19.
We limit the dataset to Arabic since it is among
the most dominant languages in Twitter (Alshaabi
et al., 2020a), yet under-studied in general.
ArCOV-19 is the first Arabic Twitter dataset
designed to capture tweets discussing COVID-19
starting from January 27th 2020 till end of January
20211 , constituting about 2.7M tweets, alongside
the propagation networks of the most-popular subset of them. To our knowledge, there is no publiclyavailable Arabic Twitter dataset for COVID-19 that
includes the propagation networks of a good subset
of its tweets. Some existing efforts have already
started to curate COVID-19 datasets including Arabic tweets, but Arabic is severely under-represented
(e.g., (Chen et al., 2020a; Singh et al., 2020)) or
represented by a random sample that is not specifically focused on COVID-19 (e.g., (Alshaabi et al.,
2020b)), or the dataset is limited in the period it
covers and does not include the propagation networks (e.g., (Alqurashi et al., 2020)).
1
The dataset will be continuously augmented with new
tweets over the coming months.

The contribution of this paper is three-fold:
• We release ArCOV-19,2 the first Arabic Twitter dataset about COVID-19 that comprises
about 2.7M tweets collected via Twitter search
API. It covers a full year allowing for capturing discussions on the topic since it started to
be popular in the Arab world. In addition to
the tweets, ArCOV-19 includes propagation
networks of the most popular subset, search
queries, and documented implementation of
our language-independent tweets crawler.
• We present a preliminary analysis on ArCOV19, which reveals insights from the dataset
concerning temporal, geographical, and topical aspects.
• We suggest several use cases to enable research on Arabic tweets in different research
areas including, but not limited to, emergency
management, misinformation detection, and
social analytics.
The reminder of the paper is organized as follows. We present the crawling process followed
to acquire ArCOV-19 in Section 3. We then thoroughly discuss the analysis that we conducted on
the dataset in Section 4. We suggest some use cases
to enable research on Arabic tweets in Section 5.
We finally conclude in Section 6.

Related Work

Social media platforms and Twitter specifically
showed to be an indispensable medium for sharing
information and discussions about the COVID-19
pandemic since December 2019. A considerable
body of raw social media datasets were released
to facilitate analyzing these discussions including
Twitter datasets (Banda et al., 2020; Lopez et al.,
2020; Chen et al., 2020b; Qazi et al., 2020; Gao
et al., 2020; Alqurashi et al., 2020; Dashtian and
Murthy, 2021), Instagram (Zarei et al., 2020), or
the Chinese social media platform Weibo (Hu et al.,
2020; Gao et al., 2020).
Banda et al. (2020) released a multilingual
dataset that includes over 800M tweets, the data is
collected since 1st of January 2020 using Twitter
streaming API. Dashtian and Murthy (2021), collected multilingual tweets posted between March
and July 2020. The most dominant languages
covered by their dataset are English and Spanish

constituting 65% and 12% of the tweets respectively. Chen et al. (2020b) are continously collecting tweets since 21st of January 2020, where at
the time of writing, around 66% and 11% of the
tweets are in English and Spanish respectively. Another multilingual ongoing collection is released
by Lopez et al. (2020). Qazi et al. (2020) enriched
their large-scale multilingual Twitter dataset with
geolocation information.
The only raw Arabic Twitter dataset available is
the one released by Alqurashi et al. (2020), however it covers the period from 1st of January to 15th
April 2020 only. Moreover, it does not include the
propagation networks of tweets.
Compared to existing datasets, we release an
only-Arabic collection of tweets, where we exclude
retweets to avoid having copies of the same tweet.
Moreover, we also release the most-popular subset of them (i.e., most-retweeted and -liked and
spam free tweets). Furthermore, we collect the
propagation networks including both retweets and
conversational threads (i.e., threads of replies) for
the most-popular subset.

Data Collection

ArCOV-19 includes two major components: the
source tweets (i.e., tweets collected via Twitter
search API every day) and the propagation networks (i.e., retweets and conversational threads
of a subset of the source tweets). In this section,
we present how we collected each in Sections 3.1,
and 3.2 respectively, and summarize the released
data in Section 3.3.
3.1

Tweets Collection

To collect the source tweets, we used our tweet
crawler3 that uses Twitter search API4 . The crawler
takes a set of manually-crafted queries, comprising
a target topic, as input. At the end of each day, the
crawler issues a search request for each of those
queries. Queries can be keywords (e.g., “Corona”),
phrases (e.g., “the killing virus”), or hashtags (e.g.,
“#the new coronavirus”). Twitter returns a maximum of 3,200 tweets per query. We customized
the search requests to return only Arabic tweets,5
and to exclude all retweets to avoid having copies

of the same tweet. Additionally, duplicate tweets
(returned by different queries) are removed in each
day. Finally, tweets are sorted chronologically.
We started collecting our data since 27th of January 2020 using a set of queries that we manuallyupdated based on our daily tracking of trending
keywords and hashtags. For example, starting from
16th of December 2020, we extended our queries
to cover tweets related to COVID-19 vaccines as
that sub-topic was gaining interest on Arabic social
media. The full list of queries used in each day
is released alongside our dataset. We denote all
collected tweets as source tweets.
Due to technical reasons, we missed collecting
tweets for a few days. Since Twitter search API
limits the search results to the past 7 days, we
missed the old tweets. To overcome that, we used
GetOldTweets36 python library to download the
search results using the same trending keywords
and hashtags we selected around those days.
3.2

Propagation Networks Collection

In addition to the source tweets, we also collected
the propagation networks (i.e., retweets and conversational threads) of the top 1000 most popular
(i.e., top-retweeted & -liked) tweets each day. To
our knowledge, this is the first Arabic tweet dataset
to include such propagation networks.
Before getting the most popular tweets on any
day, we started from source tweets collected in
that day and applied a qualification pipeline. We
first excluded tweets containing any inappropriate
word (using a list of inappropriate words we constructed). Next, tweets with more than two URLs
or four hashtags, or shorter than four tokens (all
are potentially spam) were dropped. Additionally,
duplicate tweets that have exact textual content are
also dropped to avoid redundancy; only the most
popular of them (according to our scoring criterion
below) is kept. Qualified tweets are then scored by
popularity defined by the sum of the tweet’s retweet
and favorite counts. We finally sort the qualified
tweets by their scores and select the most popular
1,000 tweets. We denote the set of all such tweets
over all days as the top subset.
For those 1K top tweets per day, we then collected all retweets and conversational threads (i.e.,
direct and indirect replies).7 We collected the

At the time of writing, we have collected the replies for
tweets until end of April 2020 and we are still collecting the

retweets using Pickaw,8 a platform for organizing contests on social media, and the replies using

Data Release

In summary, we release the following resources
as ArCOV-19 dataset, taking into consideration
Twitter content redistribution policy:10
• Source Tweets: IDs of the tweets crawled in
each day.
• Search Queries: the list of search queries, including keywords, phrases, and hashtags, used
in each period to collect our source tweets.
• Top Subset: IDs of the top 1,000 most popular tweets for each day.
• Propagation Networks: the propagation networks for the top subset which include for
each tweet in the top subset:
– Retweets: IDs of the full retweet set.
– Conversational Threads: tweet IDs of
the full reply thread (including direct and
indirect replies).
Along with the dataset, we provide some pointers
to publicly-available crawlers that users can easily
use to crawl the tweets given their IDs.

ArCOV-19 in Numbers

In this section, we present a statistical summary and
conduct an analysis on ArCOV-19 to shed some
light on its major characteristics.
4.1

Tweets and Users Distribution

Table 1 presents an overall summary of the tweets
and users statistics in ArCOV-19. It indicates that
the total number of source tweets in the dataset
is about 2.7M posted by over 690k unique users.
We note that 18.66% of the tweets were posted by
verified users (who constitute only 0.81% of the
unique users). This is a relatively large percentage,
showing that a good portion of the source tweets
are popular. The average numbers of followers,
friends, and statuses of users are also relatively
large, showing that users observed in ArCOV-19
are also popular (and possibly more influential).

The table also indicates that 25.40% of the tweets
include URLs. We anticipate that this is due to the
extensive spreading of news (linked from tweets)
during this period. The numbers of tweets that are
geotagged and geolocated are also indicated in the
table; however, we defer the discussion of such
types of tweets to Section 4.3.
Figure 1 illustrates the monthly distribution of
tweets in ArCOV-19. The volume of tweets drastically increased in March when the virus started
to spread in several Arab countries. Then, tweets
number started to decrease monthly. We speculate
this is due to the fact that the topic was not heavily
discussed as in the first days. In December, we
expanded our queries list to include hashtags and
keyword related to more current sub-topics such as
vaccines and the new variant of the virus, which
resulted in an increase in the volume of tweets.
Figure 2 presents the top 25 tweeting users in
ArCOV-19. We notice that several of them are news
sources, and 20 are verified Twitter accounts.

Tweets Content & Topics

It is important to demonstrate that the tweets in
ArCOV-19 constitute a good representative sample
of the Arabic tweets posted during the target period
on COVID-19, and that they cover the prevalent
topics discussed over Twitter during that period.
To help examine this hypothesis, we analyzed the
textual content of the tweets; in particular, we identified the most-frequent words, hashtags, and Arab

Jan 2021.

country names for the tweets posted in the period
of 27th Jan to 31st Mar 2020. We focus on this
critical period since the virus started to spread in
the Arab world during that time. We then tracked
their frequency over time. Figure 3 shows the time
series (over days) of the three types of keywords.11
The 10 most-frequent words shown in Figure 3(a) indicate two different types of words:
those that are directly related to COVID-19 (e.g.,
“health”) and those that are not but related to prayers
and supplications (e.g., “Allah/God”)). It is interesting to see the word “Allah” is very frequent
early on when the news about the virus started to
spread (probably over discussions around whether
the pandemic is a punishment from God or not, we
believe), then declines over time only to become
frequent again when the virus started to widely
spread in the Arab world.
11

When identifying the most frequent words and hashtags,
we excluded the ones we used in our search queries since they
are expected to be very frequent by definition.

(c) Word frequency of Arab countries

Figure 3: Time series of the frequency (in percentage of tweets) of top general keywords, hashtags, and Arab
country words for the period of 27th Jan to 31st Mar. The time of first reported cases in Arab countries is also
indicated and aligned with the time series.

Figure 3(b) demonstrates how “#China” hashtag
was the most trending one from 27 of January until
20 of February, as COVID-19 was prevalent only
in China and still not widely spread (at that time) in
other countries. We can see how it started to be less
trending as the number of cases started to decline
in China by that date.12 On the other hand, when
COVID-19 started to spread in the Arab world,
other hashtags started to become viral. Furthermore, Figure 3(b) shows that frequency spikes of
“#Iran”, “#Lebanon”, and “#Kuwait” exactly match
the confirmation dates of first reported cases in
Iran,13 Lebanon,14 and Kuwait,15 respectively.
To further analyze trending topics, Figure 3 features the timeline of the first reported cases in the
Arab countries and aligns them with the time series throughout the figure. Aligning the timeline
with the series in Figure 3(c) reveals a significant
match between the frequency peaks of several country names and the corresponding dates of first reported cases in those countries, most notably in
UAE, Egypt, Lebanon, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain,
Algeria, and Libya.
Figure 3 also demonstrates the power of ArCOV19 in capturing further controversial and trending
topics. Table 2 shows a timeline covering dates
of specific topics of discussion trending on social
media around times of peaks in tweeting frequency
in Figure 3(c).

ArCOV-19 by considering the domains of URLs
shared in the tweets. We focused on the top tweets
subset of ArCOV-19 (constructed as detailed in Section 3.2) and identified the URLs posted in those
tweets. We then expanded them (since Twitter
URLs are shortened) and dropped URLs of images
and videos uploaded to Twitter, to focus only on
URLs referring to external sources. We extracted
110,220 URLs from 2,617 unique domains. Figure 4 shows that URLs from news websites are
dominantly the most-commonly shared. We observe that these news websites mainly originate
from three Arab countries, namely, Egypt, Saudi
Arabia, and United Arab Emirates. Interestingly,
videos from YouTube are among the most commonly shared media. Coupled with the fact that
36% of the tweets in ArCOV-19 include embedded
images and videos (Table 1), we believe this enables ArCOV-19 to be a potential dataset to further
support the evaluation of multi-modal retrieval and
classification systems.

Geographic Distribution of Tweets

Although Twitter provides automatic geo-reference
functionally, few users (solely around 1-3% (Murdock, 2011; Jurgens et al., 2015)) opt to enable it

have an insight about the geographical distribution
and diversity of the tweets in our dataset, we examined the place and coordinates attributes of the
Tweet object.16 We note that the place attribute is
an optional attribute that allows the user to select a

Figure 5: Distribution of geolocated tweets for the period of 27th Jan 2020 to 31st Jan 2021.

The geolocated tweets were indeed posted by
users from 102 countries from around the globe.
We found that 92.75% of them were posted from
the Arab world. The largest contribution of the geolocated content (about 41.7%) comes from Saudi
Arabia; this is somewhat expected as Saudi users
represent the highest number of active Twitter users
in the Arab world.17 Surprisingly, Kuwait comes
second with 9.6% of the geolocated content. We
believe the rationale is that it was among the first
countries that reported COVID-19 cases in the Middle East. Since then, Kuwait started a series of strict
precautions such as a wide lock-down in many vital facilities until the government had imposed a
nationwide curfew. We think, after the curfew, the
people become more active on Twitter as a platform to break news and discuss developments of
the virus. Additionally, we used related phrases
and hashtags to “Kuwait”, “Lebanon”, and “UAE”

location from a list provided by Twitter (therefore,
the location might not necessarily show the actual
location from where the tweet is posted), whereas
the coordinates attribute represents the geographic
location of the tweet as reported by the user or
client application.
Table 1 shows that ArCOV-19 has 60,873 geolocated tweets (i.e., having values in the place
attribute) and 2,078 geotagged tweets (i.e., having
values in the coordinates attribute). Those tweets
were posted by 24,072 and 256 unique users respectively. The geolocated tweets constitute about
2.28% of the total source tweets, which is consistent with previous studies (Huang and Carley,
2019).

Propagation Networks

As discussed earlier, we collected the propagation
networks of the top subset. Overall, the number of
retweets is 7,925,821 for the entire subset, and the
number of replies is 1,476,950 18 .
At the time of collecting the retweets, we were
not able to get the retweets of some of the tweets either because they were deleted or they were posted
from private accounts. For those collected successfully, Figure 6 illustrates the distribution of
retweets per day using boxplots. It shows that the
average (and median) number of retweets follows
a similar pattern to what was shown in Figure 1
(notice that the Y-axis here is in log scale). We also
notice that a good number of tweets got more than
100 retweets; some of them got even larger numbers reaching about 10k retweets or more, showing
highly propagated content. As shown in Figure 7,
we applied a similar analysis to the replies per day,
and found similar patterns to the retweets.

Arab countries and the subsequent procedural measures taken by the local governments, it continued
to dominate discussions over social media (and

Twitter in particular) to the time of this writing. To
enable research on different tasks on Arabic Tweets,
we make ArCOV-19 publicly-available for the research community. Having quantified the topical,
geographical, and community representativeness
of ArCOV-19, we envision that it is suitable for
diverse natural language processing, information
retrieval, and computational social science research
tasks including, but not limited to, emergency management, misinformation detection, and social analytics, as we discuss below. Furthermore, we provide propagation networks of daily highly popular
subset (the most popular 1K) to ensure the quality
of tweets. This sample is drawn after filtering out
potential low-quality tweets (e.g., spam) and content duplicates. We anticipate the top subset and
the network to support these tasks on the popular
Arabic tweets that we assume have the most effect
on shaping public opinion and understanding.
Emergency Management: As COVID-19 is an
international pandemic, national and international
health organizations need to analyze the effects of
the outbreak. We believe ArCOV-19 can support
several tasks in that domain, such as filtering of informative content, events and sub-events detection,
summarization, identification of eyewitnesses, geolocation, and studying information and situational
awareness propagation, to name a few.
Social Analytics: In addition to sharing reports
and awareness during the outbreak, people tend to
discuss their opinions (e.g., stance towards the situation and its consequences) and express their emotions (e.g., big changes in lifestyle, social distancing, loss of their beloved ones, etc.). Therefore, analyzing the tweets to detect sentiment, stance, hate
speech, and generally, offensive language, among
other aspects, is of interest to many stakeholders.

Misinformation Detection: With the sheer
amount of information shared about COVID-19,
many rumors are disseminated and getting high attention from the community, which causes a fast
propagation of misinformation. This hinders the
efforts of the health and governmental organizations on fighting the pandemic as such rumors
spread panic and may lead to undesirable consequences (e.g., increase of cases and mortality rate,
or lack of supplies due to hoarding). ArCOV-19
supports studying information/claims propagation,
claims check-worthiness detection and verification
tasks on the most popular tweets. Furthermore,
the retweet networks and conversational threads
provide a valuable resource for early detection of
fake news and identification of malicious rumorspreading accounts. To further facilitate work in
this domain of problems, we recently constructed
ArCOV19-Rumors, an annotated dataset on top of
ArCOV-19 to support claim and tweet verification
(Haouari et al., 2021).

Conclusion

In this paper, we presented ArCOV-19, the first
Arabic Twitter dataset about the Novel Coronavirus
(COVID-19) that includes propagation networks
of a large subset of tweets. We release all source
tweets, top subset, search queries, and the propagation networks. Preliminary analysis showed that
ArCOV-19 captured spikes in tweeting frequency
for country-specific tweets that are consistent with
the first reported cases of COVID-19 in several
Arab countries. We also found dominance of news
agencies among top tweeting users and among most
shared URLs. ArCOV-19 enables research under
many domains including natural language processing, information retrieval, and social computing.
We plan to continue collecting tweets for the foreseeable future and the dataset will be continuously
updated with newly collected tweets and propagation networks.
