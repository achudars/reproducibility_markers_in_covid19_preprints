Abstract
The novelty of new human coronavirus COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 and the lack of effective drugs and
vaccines gave rise to a wide variety of strategies employed to fight this worldwide pandemic. Many of these
strategies rely on the repositioning of existing drugs that could shorten the time and reduce the cost
compared to de novo drug discovery.
In this study, we presented a new network-based algorithm for drug repositioning, called SAveRUNNER
(Searching off-lAbel dRUg aNd NEtwoRk), which predicts drug–disease associations by quantifying the
interplay between the drug targets and the disease-specific proteins in the human interactome via a novel
network-based similarity measure that prioritizes associations between drugs and diseases locating in the
same network neighborhoods. Specifically, we applied SAveRUNNER on a panel of 14 selected diseases
with a consolidated knowledge about their disease-causing genes and that have been found to be related to
COVID-19 for genetic similarity (i.e., SARS), comorbidity (e.g., cardiovascular diseases), or for their
association to drugs tentatively repurposed to treat COVID-19 (e.g., malaria, HIV, rheumatoid arthritis).
Focusing specifically on SARS subnetwork, we identified 282 repurposable drugs, including some the most
rumored off-label drugs for COVID-19 treatments (e.g., chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab,
heparin), as well as a new combination therapy of 5 drugs (hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, lopinavir,
ritonavir, remdesivir), actually used in clinical practice.
Furthermore, to maximize the efficiency of putative downstream validation experiments, we prioritized 24
potential anti-SARS-CoV repurposable drugs based on their network-based similarity values. These topranked drugs include ACE-inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies (e.g., anti-IFN, anti-TNFα, anti-IL12, antiIL1, anti-IL6), and thrombin inhibitors.
Finally, our findings were in-silico validated by performing a gene set enrichment analysis, which confirmed
that most of the network-predicted repurposable drugs may have a potential treatment effect against human
coronavirus infections.

Introduction
The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by an enveloped positive-strand RNA virus,
named SARS-CoV-2, which affects the respiratory system and whose genome has been likened to the
previously identified SARS-CoV strain responsible for SARS outbreak in 2003 1. Unfortunately, the world
population is completely immune-naïve and therefore vulnerable against this new coronavirus, which has
rapidly spread becoming a global pandemic with high morbidity and mortality

2–4

. While COVID-19

lockdowns are easing across the world, main concerns come from its arrival in Africa where the countries are
unprepared to counteract the storm’s outburst of the new coronavirus and 1.2 billion people are at
tremendous risk 5. For example, Kenya has only 200 intensive care beds for its entire population of 50
million, whereas United States has 34 beds for every 100,000 people. Countries, like Mali, have only a few
ventilators for millions of people, health facilities are overcrowded and understaffed. Yet, in many countries
throughout Africa, people live together in close quarters, often without access to clean running water that
makes social distancing and frequent handwashing, the only possible prevention strategy, all but impossible
5

. Given that, the COVID-19 pandemic demands the rapid identification of repurposable drug candidates to

fight the disease progression in the short term and to prevent it from happening in the future.

Drug repurposing is a recent drug development strategy used to identify novel uses for drugs approved by the
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) outside the scope of their original medical indication 6. It aims at
establishing whether an ‘old drug’ can be reused for new therapeutic purposes representing a faster and
cheaper alternative to de novo drug discovery process, which generally takes 12-15 years and 2-3 billion
dollars (from production to approval, passing through the various phases of preclinical and clinical trials) 6.
Thus far, several therapeutic agents have been evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, but none have yet
been shown to be efficacious

7,8

. Currently, the most promising therapeutic candidate, made available under

an emergency-use authorization by the FDA, is remdesivir. It is an inhibitor of the viral RNA-dependent
RNA Polymerase with proven ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro 9. In fact, according to recent
preliminary results of randomized clinical trials, remdesivir has been shown to be superior to placebo in
shortening the time to recovery in adults hospitalized with COVID-19 and evidence of lower respiratory tract
infection

10

. However, despite the use of remdesivir, the mortality remains high, indicating that treatment

with an antiviral drug alone is not likely to be sufficient. To continue to improve patient outcomes in
COVID-19, combinations of antiviral agents or antiviral agents in combination with other therapeutic
approaches should be evaluated by future strategies.

Very promising insights comes from the new emerging field of network medicine

11,12

, which applies tools

and concepts from network theory to elucidate the relation between perturbations on the molecular level and
phenotypic disease manifestations. The basic premise of this exercise is that the human interactome (i.e., the
cellular network of all physical molecular interactions) can be interpreted as a map and diseases as local
perturbations 13. Yet, the molecular determinants of a given disease (disease genes) are not to be randomly
scattered, but co-localize and agglomerate in specific regions (disease modules) of the interactome and
perturbations in these disease modules may contribute to the pathobiological phenotype 12. From a network
medicine perspective, also the action of drugs can be interpreted as a local perturbation of the interactome
and thus, for a drug to be on-target effective against a specific disease or to cause off-target adverse effects,
its target proteins should be within or in the immediate vicinity of the corresponding disease module.
Network-based approaches marrying this philosophy can aid in identifying the specific interactome
neighborhood that is perturbed in a certain disease and/or for the effect of a certain drug and guide the search
for therapeutic targets, identify comorbidities, as well as rapidly detect drug repurposing candidates 14–18.

Here, we presented SAveRUNNER (Searching off-lAbel dRUg aNd NEtwoRk), a new network-medicinebased algorithm for drug repurposing. It constructs a bipartite drug-disease network by quantifying the
interplay between the drug targets and the disease-specific proteins in the human interactome via a novel
network-based similarity measure that prioritizes associations between drugs and diseases locating in the
same network neighborhoods. SAveRUNNER yielded a high accuracy in the identification of well-known
drug indications, thus revealing itself as a powerful tool to rapidly highlight potential novel medical
indications for various drugs, which are already approved and used in clinical practice, against the new
human coronavirus (2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2).

Results
Identification of predicted drug-disease associations
SAveRUNNER algorithm requires in input a list of drug targets and a list of disease genes to evaluate the
extent to which a given drug can repositioned to treat a given disease.
In the present study, disease-associated genes were downloaded from Phenopedia

19

, which provides a

disease-centered view of genetic association studies; whereas drug-target associations were obtained from
DrugBank

20

, which collects huge amount of drug-related data, recently enabling the discovery and

repurposing of a relevant number of existing drugs to treat rare and newly identified diseases 6,14 (Figure 1a).
We tested the performance of SAveRUNNER on a panel of 14 diseases that have been found to be related to
COVID-19 for genetic similarity, comorbidity, or for their association to drugs with the potential to shorten
the recovery time for seriously ill COVID-19 patients. Thus, we included Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome (SARS) since it is caused by the coronavirus with the highest nucleotide sequence identity with
SARS-CoV-2

16,21

. Unlike COVID-19, for which there is still a partial knowledge of its associated disease

genes, SARS has been widely studied and a reliable list of the its molecular determinants is available in the
most common databases of human genetic associations 19. Yet, we comprehended cardiovascular diseases,
diabetes and hypertension, whose comorbidity in COVID-19 patients is well documented

22,23

. In addition,

we included other viral infections (i.e., malaria, HIV and Ebola) and immune disorders (i.e., rheumatoid
arthritis), since drugs that have been authorized for their treatment (i.e., chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine,
lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir, and tocilizumab, respectively) are being investigated worldwide for their
potential to treat coronavirus disease (COVID-19) 7,9,24–30.
For what concerns drug-target associations, we assembled target information for a total of 1875 FDAapproved drugs. In addition, we considered in our input list of drug targets also the combination of
remdesivir with other four antiviral agents, i.e. hydroxycloriquine, chloriquine, lopinavir, and ritonavir
(referred as “5-cocktail”), as well as the combination of two of them, i.e. lopinavir and ritonavir (referred as
“kaletra”), whose antiviral action against coronavirus infections has been demonstrated both in vitro and in
vivo studies 31,32. In fact, despite significant progress in the COVID-19 management pointing to remdesivir as
the most promising therapeutic candidate, the mortality remains high, indicating that treatment with an

antiviral drug alone is not likely to be sufficient and combinations of antiviral agents should be evaluated by
future strategies to improve patient outcomes in COVID-19 10.
The complete lists of the analyzed diseases and drugs are provided in Supplementary Table 1.
The rationale behind SAveRUNNER algorithm lies on the hypothesis that, for a drug to be effective against
a specific disease, its associated targets (drug module) and the disease-specific associated genes (disease
module) should be nearby in the human interactome

14

(Figure 1b). To quantify the vicinity between drug

and disease modules, SAveRUNNER implements a novel network similarity measure:

1

𝑓(𝑝) =
1+𝑒

−𝑐[

(1+𝑄𝐶)(𝑚−𝑝)
− 𝑑]
𝑚

where p is the network proximity measure defined in 14:

𝑝(𝑇, 𝑆) =

1
∑ 𝑚𝑖𝑛 𝑑(𝑡, 𝑠)
𝑠𝜖𝑆
‖𝑇‖
𝑡𝜖𝑇

that represents the average shortest path length between drug targets 𝑡 in the drug module 𝑇 and the nearest
disease genes 𝑠 in the disease module 𝑆; 𝑄𝐶 is the quality cluster score; 𝑚 is 𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑝); 𝑐 and 𝑑 are the
steepness and the midpoint of 𝑓(𝑝), respectively (see Materials and Methods). To assess the statistical
significance of this new defined network-based similarity measure, SAveRUNNER applies a degreepreserving randomization procedure, expecting a p-value ≤ 0.05 for proximal drug and disease modules.
The novelty of our approach resides in having implemented a procedure to prioritize the predicted off-label
drug indications for a given disease (see Materials and Methods section). This prioritization procedure
exploits a clustering analysis to reward associations between drugs and diseases belonging to the same
network cluster, based on the assumption that if a drug and a disease group together is more likely that the
drug can be effectively repurposed for that disease. In this sense, we say that drugs and disease that are
members of the same group (cluster), are more similar to each other than to members of other groups
(clusters).
SAveRUNNER algorithm releases as output a weighted bipartite drug-disease network, in which one set of
nodes corresponds to drugs and the other one corresponds to diseases. A link between a drug and a disease
occurs if the corresponding drug targets and disease genes are nearby in the interactome more than expected

by chance (p-value ≤ 0.05) and the weight of their interaction corresponds to the new defined network-based
similarity measure. In this study, the final drug-disease network was composed of a total of 1682 nodes (i.e.,
14 diseases associated to 1668 drugs) and 7177 edges.
This drug-disease network was naturally rendered as a matrix reporting the 14 diseases on the rows, and the
1668 drugs on the columns (Figure 2), labeled with their original medical indication according to the
Therapeutic Target Database (TTD). Each matrix cell was colored according to the corresponding similarity
value of a given drug-disease pair: shades of yellow denote drug-associated targets more proximal (high
similarity) to the disease-associated genes in the human interactome, whereas shades of blue denote drug
targets more distal (low similarity) to the disease genes (Figure 2).
For elucidating drugs/diseases relatedness in terms of network similarity, we computed a hierarchical
biclustering on the drug-disease similarity matrix. This analysis pointed out two main disease clusters: one
including SARS, RDS, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, malaria, and viral infection diseases (magenta
box in Figure 2); the other one including cardiovascular diseases and their risk factors, i.e., diabetes mellitus
and hypertension (green box in Figure 2).
As proof of validity of SAveRUNNER, among the predicted drug-disease associations, we found several
already

known

associations.

For

example,

tocilizumab,

interferon-beta

1a/b,

chloroquine/

hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, resulted to be significantly associated (p-value ≤ 0.05) with the
diseases for which they were approved (i.e. rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, malaria, and HIV
infection, respectively).

SARS-CoV-host interactome
In total, we found 41 host proteins associated with SARS-CoV and their specific subnetwork within the
human interactome is shown in Figure 3a.
By mapping the known drug–target network into the SARS-CoV-host interactome, we revealed that 21 out
of 41 (51%, light blue nodes in Figure 3a) SARS-CoV-associated disease genes are druggable cellular
targets, i.e. can be directly targeted by at least one FDA-approved drug. For example, F2, TNF, FCGR2A,
ACE, are the most targetable proteins. The KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed that this 21
targetable SARS-CoV-associated disease genes are involved in multiple significant (adjusted p-value ≤

0.05) viral infection-related pathways, including TNF signaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling
pathway, Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, IL-17 signaling pathway, Epstein-Barr virus infection,
Inflammatory bowel disease, and Influenza (Figure 3b), mirroring the enrichment results found for the total
41 SARS-CoV-associated disease genes (Figure 3c).
The high druggability of SARS-CoV-host interactome and the relevance of the pathways in which the 21
druggable SARS-CoV-associated disease genes are involved strongly supports a drug repurposing strategy
for potential treatment of COVID-19, by specifically targeting cellular proteins associated with SARS.
The remaining 20 non-targetable SARS-CoV-associated disease genes include proteins (e.g., CD14, IFNA1,
IFNB1, IL4, IL10, CCL5) having key roles in the immune-inflammatory response to viral infection as well.
This strongly supports a network-based view of drug action, according to which most disease phenotypes are
difficult to reverse through the use of a single “magic bullet”, that is, an intervention that affects a single
node in the network and encourages to inspect all the molecules that are situated in the neighborhood of the
targetable proteins, leading to also detect possible side-effects 12.

SARS-CoV drug-disease network
In total, SAveRUNNER identified 282 repurposable drugs that were significantly associated (p-value ≤
0.05) with the SARS-CoV infection (Supplementary Table 2). Figure 4a illustrates a sketch of SARS drugdisease network in which SARS is connected to the other analyzed diseases via the high-confidence
predicted drugs (with their original medical indications) that could be repurposed for potential SARS
fighting. This network is composed of two independent sets of nodes: one set corresponds to 13 diseases
(i.e., SARS and the other 12 diseases sharing at least one drug with SARS) represented as red circles and
whose size scales with their degree; the other one corresponds to the 66 FDA-approved non-SARS drugs for
which known therapeutic indications were available from TTD or to the drugs combination proposed as new
potential medical indication, colored accordingly. Two nodes of the two independent sets were connected
whether the network similarity of the drug targets and disease genes in the human interactome was
statistically significant (p-value ≤ 0.05).

Looking at Figure 4a, it clearly emerges that there exist several candidate repurposable drugs for treatment of
SARS. Among them, we pointed out the 5-cocktail (adjusted similarity = 0.89, p-value = 0.036) that
appeared as a promising candidate for targeting SARS showing a quite high network similarity.
In total, among the candidate repurposable drugs for SARS with an already known medical indication, we
found 16 drugs indicated for hypertension treatment, including enalapril which is also the top potential antiSARS-CoV repurposable drug (adjusted similarity = 0.99, p-value = 1.21 10-32); 14 drugs for cardiovascular
diseases, including heparin (adjusted similarity = 0.19, p-value = 0.0046); 11 drugs for rheumatoid arthritis,
including tocilizumab (adjusted similarity = 0.99, p-value = 6.5 10-4); 7 drugs for respiratory diseases; 6
drugs for diabetes mellitus; 4 drugs for multiple sclerosis, including interferon beta-1a (adjusted similarity =
0.99, p-value = 8.22 10-7) and interferon beta-1b (adjusted similarity = 0.99, p-value = 2.18 10-16); 4 drugs
for HIV infection; 3 drugs for malaria, including chloroquine (adjusted similarity = 0.35, p-value = 0.01) and
hydroxycloriquine (adjusted similarity = 0.51, p-value = 1.85 10-6); and 2 drugs for influenza (Figure 4b).
By analyzing the distribution of all the known medical indications associated to the drugs shared between
SARS infection and each analyzed disease, hypertension- and cardiac-associated drugs appeared as highly
frequent drugs, followed by rheumatoid arthritis- and respiratory disease-associated ones (Figure 4c). This
findings appear in accordance with the fact that patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection also showed potential
hypertension and cardiac injuries, including arrhythmia and myocardial dysfunction

22,23,33,34

. This could be

owed to the disruption of the subtle balance between angiotensin‐converting enzyme 1 (ACE1) and
angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), identified as functional receptor of both SARS‐CoV/SARS-CoV‐
2 for host cell entry 35 and normally devoted to present various cardiovascular protective effects 33.

GSEA validation
In order to validate the 282 anti-SARS repurposable drugs predicted by SAveRUNNER, we performed a
gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) as in 16, by using transcriptome data of SARS-CoV infected cells as
gene signature for SARS. The gene expression data of drug-treated human cell lines from the Connectivity
Map (CMAP) database were exploited to obtain drug signatures and thus to calculate a GSEA score for each
drug as an indication of in-silico validation. In particular, for each SARS dataset, we selected drugs with a
score > 0 in order to focus on those drugs able to have a potential treatment effect on genes that are hallmark

for that phenotype. The assigned GSEA score, ranging from 0 to 2, corresponded to the number of datasets
satisfying this criterion for a specific drug.
The GSEA analysis validated a total of 61 out the 282 candidate drugs to be repositioned against SARS
infection, including 26 with a GSEA score of 2 and 35 with a GSEA score equal to 1 (Supplementary Table
2).

SARS-CoV-2 host interactome
In this study, we focused on SARS disease, which is caused by the coronavirus having the higher genetic
similarity with SARS-CoV-2 16,21 and for which the specific disease genes are known. Conversely, given the
novelty of the new coronavirus COVID-19 in the spectrum of human disease, the knowledge of the COVID19-associated genes is far from completeness. However, a study has been recently published, where the
authors identified 332 human proteins interacting with 26 SARS-CoV-2 proteins by using affinity
purification mass spectrometry 36. Although the authors verified that these proteins were preferentially highly
expressed in lung tissue (typical environment where the virus causes a major damage), this study has been
carried out on human HEK293T kidney cells that does not represent the primary physiological site of
infection.

For a more generalizable understanding of human coronaviruses infection, we completed our analysis by
applying SAveRUNNER on these the 332 human proteins preliminarily associated to SARS-CoV-2. The
obtained results are encouraging and appears in accordance with the analysis carried out on SARS-CoV.
Indeed, by performing a hierarchical clustering on the network of predicted drug-disease associations, we
found COVID-19 in the same cluster of SARS, RDS, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, malaria, and
viral infection diseases (Figure 5a). This is in accordance with recent studies that are attempting to
repurpose, for COVID-19 treatment, drugs approved to treat other viral infections such as influenza, malaria,
HIV, and Ebola or immune-related disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis 9,24–26,28,29,37.

The list of network-predicted drugs potentially able to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection contains a total of 98
drugs, including 54 (i.e., 55%) COVID-19 specific and 44 (i.e., 45%) in common with the 282 candidate
repurposable drugs found for SARS-CoV (Supplementary Table 2 and Figure 5b). The high number of

repurposing candidates shared between SARS-CoV-2 an SARS-CoV is also reflected in the result of the
greedy clustering algorithm implemented by SAveRUNNER, which places COVID-19 and SARS together in
the cluster with the highest quality cluster score.

We then investigated whether the network-predicted repurposable drugs could counteract the gene
expression perturbations caused by SARS-CoV-2, i.e. if they could up-regulate genes down-regulated by the
infection or viceversa. To verify that, we performed the GSEA analysis by using, as COVID-19 gene
signature, the 120 differentially expressed genes in SARS-CoV-2-infected A549 cells reported in

38

and, as

drug signatures, the gene expression data of drug-treated human cell lines from the CMAP database

39

.

Interestingly, this analysis revealed that 24 out of 98 candidate drugs to be repositioned for COVID-19
treatment achieved the highest GSEA score. In particular, 14 of them, encompassing lopinavir, were
included in the 54 specific-SARS-CoV-2 predicted drugs (Supplementary Table 2 and Figure 5b).

In a recent study

18

, the authors exploited the new knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 host interactome

36

and

integrated several network-based drug repurposing strategies to prioritize 81 promising repurposing
candidates against COVID-19. The overlap between these 81 repurposable drugs and the 98 ones predicted
by SAveRUNNER is of 5 drugs, i.e. isoniazid, lopinavir, romidepsin, sulfinpyrazone, tadalafil.

Prediction of disease comorbidity
In order to predict potential comorbidity patterns among all the diseases analyzed in this study, for each
disease module corresponding to the 15 analyzed disorders, we computed the non-Euclidean separation
distance, which measures the modules’ overlap 40:
𝑠(𝐴, 𝐵) = 𝑝𝐴𝐵 −

𝑝𝐴𝐴 + 𝑝𝐵𝐵
2

where 𝑝(𝐴, 𝐵) is the network proximity defined as:

𝑝(𝐴, 𝐵) =

1
[∑ min 𝑑(𝑎, 𝑏) + ∑ min 𝑑(𝑏, 𝑎)]
𝑏𝜖𝐵
𝑎𝜖𝐴
|𝐴| + |𝐵|
𝑎𝜖𝐴

𝑏𝜖𝐵

and 𝑑(𝑎, 𝑏) is the shortest distance between disease gene 𝑎 of module 𝐴 and disease gene 𝑏 of module 𝐵. A
positive value for the separation measure indicates that two disease modules are topologically well-separated
in the human interactome, whereas a negative value for the separation measure indicates that two disease
modules are located in the same network neighborhood and thus overlap.
We found that SARS-CoV disease module directly overlapped with RDS and Influenza disease modules (s <
0) and appeared to be closest to Malaria (smallest s) followed by cardiomyopathies. (Figure 6a). On the other
hand, by using SARS-CoV-2 disease genes, we found that the COVID-19 disease module did not directly
overlap with any disease module here analyzed (Figure 6b). However, among the closest diseases (smallest
s), we found cardiovascular diseases (i.e., cardiomyopathies, arrhythmia, heart arrest), whose comorbidity in
COVID-19 patients has been already discussed 22,23.

Comparison with other methods
In the last few years, several computational network-based methods have been proposed to predict direct
drug–disease associations for drug repositioning

41–46

. Among them, the MBiRW algorithm adopts adopted

an effective mechanism to measure similarity for drugs and diseases and applied a Bi-Random walk (BiRW)
algorithm to predict potential new indications for existing drugs 46. This methodology has been shown to
outperform other well-known network-based prediction methods

15,47,48

in correctly predicting true drug–

disease associations. These captivating results prompted us to implement a BiRW-based algorithm (see
Materials and Methods) against which we compared the performance of SAveRUNNER.
The effectiveness of the drug–disease predictions provided by BiRW and SAveRUNNER were evaluated
and compared in terms of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) probability curves with their
corresponding Area Under the Curve (AUC) (see Materials and Methods). In particular, we found that
SAveRUNNER yielded over 70% accuracy (AUC = 0.73) for identifying well-known drug-disease
relationships and overcame the one obtained by the BiRW-based algorithm (AUC = 0.59). In other words,
there is 73% chance that SAveRUNNER algorithm will be able to distinguish between positive class (known
drug-disease associations) and negative class (unknown drug-disease associations) against the 59% of the
BiRW-based algorithm.

Discussion
Ongoing clinical trials for the management of COVID-19
Thus far, no proven effective therapies for the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 exist and the majority of
available data are based on expert opinions and anecdotal experiences

49

. Old and new agents have been

proposed and explored for treatment of COVID-19 50, but clinical trials are still underway. Currently, 291
active trials specific to COVID-19 are present on Clinical-Trials.gov. We will next discuss some of the most
popular ongoing clinical trials for the management of the COVID-19 pandemic 7,9,27,51–56.
Remdesevir is a novel nucleotide analogue currently under evaluation in clinical trials for Ebola infection and
it has shown an excellent activity against early coronavirus infections (SARS, MERS) both in vitro and in
animal models. Recently, Grein J et al.

56

provided remdesivir on a compassionate-use basis to patients

hospitalized with COVID-19. In this cohort of patients, clinical improvement was observed in 36 of 53
patients (68%). Although remdesivir has not yet been approved by US Food and Drug Administration, a
preliminary report published on May 22, shows that it was superior to placebo in shortening the time to
recovery in adults with COVID-19 and evidence of lower respiratory tract infection 10.
Chloroquine is an old and widely used anti-malarial drug and it is also efficacious as an anti-inflammatory
agent for rheumatologic disease. Earlier studies have demonstrated a potential antiviral effect of chloroquine
that may depend by several mechanisms such as the change of cell membrane pH, which is necessary for
viral fusion and the interference with glycosylation of viral proteins. A recent study has demonstrated in vitro
efficacy of chloroquine and remdesivir in inhibiting replication of SARS-CoV-2 9. Moreover, emerging
reports from China suggest that chloroquine has shown a superiority in reducing both the severity and the
duration of clinical disease without significant adverse events in almost one hundred patients

26,51,52

. In light

of this results, an expert consensus group in China has recommended chloroquine for COVID-19 treatment
26

.

Hydroxychloroquine (brand name plaquenil) is an analogue of chloroquine, which was demonstrated to be
much less toxic than chloroquine in animals and with similar in vitro efficacy on SARS-CoV-2 25,27

Lopinavir/ritonavir (brand name kaletra) is a well-known protease inhibitor, which has been widely used for
many years for the treatment of HIV infection. Compared to remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir has the
advantage that it is widely available and has an established toxicity and drug-drug interactions profile. Its
antiviral action against coronavirus infections has been previously demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo
(animal and human data) studies conducted on SARS

31,32

. Recently Cao et al.

7

conducted a randomized,

controlled, open-label trial involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. A
total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were
assigned to the lopinavir/ritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group. Unfortunately, the trial results
were disappointing and no benefit was observed with lopinavir/ritonavir treatment in hospitalized adult
patients with severe COVID-19. Nevertheless, lopinavir/ritonavir is currently under investigation within
other randomized clinical trials and the results of such trials will provide convincing positive or negative
findings on this therapy.
In absence of proven antivirals for COVID-19, adjunctive therapies of support represent the cornerstone of
care. In particular: anticytokine drugs, corticosteroids, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), and
immunoglobulin therapy. Monoclonal antibodies directed against key inflammatory cytokines or other
aspects of the innate immune response represent another potential class of adjunctive therapies for COVID19.
One of the most promising monoclonal antibodies under investigation for the management of COVID-19 is
tocilizumab (TCZ). Specifically, TCZ is an anti-human IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody that inhibits
signal transduction by binding sIL- 6R and mIL-6R. Currently, TCZ is licensed for the treatment of adult
patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, but several studies in China showed a
possible correlation of massive inflammation and severe lung damage on the rapid evolution of fatal
pneumonia. Indeed, in COVID-19 patients, significant differences in IL-6 plasmatic levels were observed at
different stage of disease with a higher expression in severe cases

37

. Despite the lack of clinical trials on

TCZ efficacy and safety for COVID-19 treatment, “off-label” TCZ has been used as potential treatment
strategy in severe and critical COVID-19 patients. Currently, in Italy a multicenter study on the efficacy and
tolerability of tocilizumab in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia is ongoing.

Another remarkable candidate for the treatment of COVID-19 is LMWH, with the aim to improve the
coagulation dysfunction of COVID-19. Really, during the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection, an increased
incidence of acute pulmonary embolism episodes was detected. These were often COVID-19 patients with
risk factors for embolism, increased D-dimer and deterioration of general conditions and respiratory failure.
Recently, Tong N. et al.

53

showed that anticoagulant therapy mainly with LMWH appears to be associated

with better prognosis in severe COVID-19 patients meeting criteria of the sepsis-induced coagulopathy score
or with markedly elevated D-dimer. However, its efficacy remains to be validated in large clinical trials.
Interestingly, LMWH seems exert anti-inflammatory effects by reducing IL-6 and increasing lymphocyte %,
so that the potential of LMWH could be to mitigate cytokine storm in severe COVID-19 patients.
To complete the clinical landscape of potential adjunctive therapy for COVID-19, we mention also the use of
convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulins obtained from recovered patients

57

. The rationale

for this treatment is that antibodies from recovered patients may help the immune clearance of SARS-CoV-2.
In conclusion, several drugs demonstrate in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2. Of these, several repurposed
agents used to treat a variety of other diseases (malaria, HIV, rheumatoid arthritis) have been proposed as
possible cure options for COVID-19. Lopinavir/ritonavir and chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine are the
treatments with the most clinical evidence, either positive or negative, in the treatment of COVID-19.
Currently, randomized clinical trials have not proven that any of these drugs are undoubtedly effective.

In-silico drug predictions for the management of COVID-19
In this study, we developed a novel network-based algorithm for drug repurposing, called SAveRUNNER,
with the aim to offer a promising framework to efficiently screen potential novel indications for currently
marketed drugs against COVID-19.
Our findings, in accordance with several recent works

14,16,58

, suggested that the discovery of efficacious

repurposable drugs (or drug combinations) could benefit from the exploration of the relationship between
drug targets and the disease genes in the human interactome. The novelty of SAveRUNNER relies on the
definition of a new network-based similarity measure, which quantifies the vicinity between drug and disease
modules and considers the drug-disease network modular structure to reward predicted associations between
drugs and diseases that are located in the same network neighborhoods.

Focusing on SARS disease, which is caused by the coronavirus having the higher genetic similarity with
SARS-CoV-2

16,21

and for which the specific disease genes are known, we identified 282 candidate

repurposable drugs. Among them, we recovered some of the most rumored off-label drugs, like chloroquine,
hydroxycloriquine, tocilizumab, and heparin. While lopinavir/ritonavir and remdesivir were not found to be
significantly associated with SARS, their combination together with chloroquine and hydroxycloriquine
(here referred as 5-cocktail) was predicted as a promising anti-SARS-CoV repurposable drug.
Although all the 282 repurposable drugs predicted by SAveRUNNER warrant to be explored, a prioritization
of these drugs according to the decreasing value of their network similarity value with SARS may offer the
possibility to maximize the efficiency of subsequent experimental screening and clinical trial validation. This
does not mean that drugs located at a lower-ranking have no potential efficacy or must be a priori excluded
from further exploration.
Thus, we found that the 95th percentile of the similarity values distribution includes ACE-inhibitors (i.e.,
enalapril, trandolapril, fosinopril, benazepril, cilazapril, zofenopril, spirapril, rescinnamine, quinapril),
thrombin inhibitors (i.e., thrombomodulin alfa, bivalirudin, dabigatran etexilate, argatroban, ximelagatran),
and several monoclonal antibodies like: anti-TNFα (i.e., adalimumab, golimumab, infliximab, certolizumab
pegol), anti-IFN (i.e., emapalumab), anti-IL1 (i.e., canakinumab), and anti-IL6 (i.e., siltuximab).

These findings are in accordance with the current therapeutic avenues tentatively proposed for fighting
COVID-19, even if, for some of them, the effectiveness in treating COVID-19 remains controversial. Indeed,
several recent studies hypothesized that COVID-19 patients receiving ACE-inhibitors may be subject to
poorer outcomes

59,60

, whereas other investigators argued that the usage of ACE-inhibitors could be

beneficial in COVID-19 infection 61. On the contrary, the potential efficacy of the other top-ranked predicted
off-label drugs seems to be less uncertain. Indeed, several evidences suggested that COVID-19 may
predispose patients to arterial and venous thrombotic disease and then common antithrombotic medications,
including the already mentioned heparin or direct thrombin inhibitors such as dabigatran, have been
proposed as potential adjunctive therapy against COVID-19

62

. Yet, monoclonal antibodies targeting key

inflammatory cytokines or other aspects of the innate immune response are increasingly recognized as
another promising class of anti-COVID-19 drugs. In particular, the class of anti-TNFα antibodies, mostly

used for the treatment of inflammatory rheumatic diseases, could be able to challenge COVID-19 by two
main actions: the classical TNFα inhibition and a down-regulation of ACE2 expression resulting in
decreased binding sites for SARS-CoV-2
thanks to its excellent safety profile

63,64

. Thus, anti-TNFα antibodies, and adalimumab in particular

65

, could inhibit the basic mechanisms of COVID-19, and could be

potentially useful in managing/preventing COVID-19-driven pneumonia66. As proof of this, a study
evaluating adalimumab injection in COVID-19 patients has recently been registered in order to assess the
role of this antibody in treating COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia 67.

In-silico validation of SAveRUNNER predictions
As indication of in-silico validation of the 282 candidate repurposable drugs predicted by SAveRUNNER,
we performed a GSEA analysis that allowed to investigate whether these repositioning candidates have
potential treatment effect against SARS-CoV infection. The GSEA analysis validated a total of 61 out the
282 anti-SARS repurposable drugs. Among the drugs achieving highest GSEA scores, we found some of the
ACE-inhibitors above-mentioned (i.e., enalapril, benazepril, quinapril, fosinopril, rescinnamine) as well as
ACE-inhibitors with multiple targets (i.e., perindopril, captopril, moexipril, ramipril), and chloroquine.

In addition, this analysis came up other interesting but less obvious drugs falling far outside antiviral use
such as ruxolitinib, lovastatin, and a group of H1-antihistamines (i.e., loratadine, fexofenadine,
levocetirizine, desloratadine, clemastine, ketotifen, diphenhydramine, cetirizine).
Ruxolitinib is a potent and selective Janus-Associated Kinase (JAK) inhibitor approved for treatment of
myelofibrosis, but thanks to its powerful anti-inflammatory effect, it could be likely to be effective against
the consequences of the elevated levels of cytokines typically observed in patients with COVID-19 68,69.
Lovastatin is widely prescribed to reduce the levels cholesterol in the blood and prevent cardiovascular
diseases. Experimental evidence suggested that statin-induced reduction of cholesterol in the plasma
membrane results in lower viral titers and failure to internalize the virus 70.
H1-antihistamines are mostly used to treat allergic reactions, but they potentially could have beneficial antiinflammatory effects on immune dysregulation during COVID 19 infection. Indeed, histamine is a

biologically active substance that potentiates the inflammatory and immune responses of the body, regulates
physiological function in the gut, and acts as a neurotransmitter.
Notably, among the repurposable drugs against SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both predicted by
SAveRUNNER and validated by GSEA analysis, we found 10 common off-label drugs, encompassing ACE
inhibitors (i.e., enalapril, and quinapril) and antihistamines (i.e., cetirizine and fexofenadine). Moreover,
among repurposable drugs validated by the GSEA analysis as potential treatment effect against SARS-CoV2 infection, we found the protease inhibitor lopinavir.

Drugs’ likely mechanism-of-action in SARS
Moving beyond the “one drug, one target” vision prompted us to explore all the molecules that are situated in
the interactome neighborhood of the drugs targetable proteins, which may be altered by the drug activity as
well as may cause side-effects (Figure 7).
We interestingly observe that all drug subnetworks include genes involved in the immune-inflammatory
response and share individual-specific genetic factors (i.e., HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C), as well as some
crucial pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e., IFN-, IL-1, TNF). The HLA genes encodes for the proteins of the
major histocompatibility complex of class I (MHC-I), that is directly involved in the antigen presentation
process. The cytokines IFN-, IL-1, and TNF have a critical role in promoting inflammation

71,72

and

several studies demonstrated as their suppression may lead to therapeutic effects in many inflammatory
diseases, including viral infections 66,73–75. An overwhelming production of these pro-inflammatory cytokines
indeed contributes to a hyper-inflammatory condition, denoted as cytokine storm, which destroys the normal
regulation of the immune response and may induce pathological inflammatory disorders 75–77.
Some drugs are characterized by highly complex interaction networks, whereas others, like the case of
remdesivir, seem to have a poorly connected substructure. However, it is worth noting that the observed
network complexity does not scale with the potential drug effectiveness. The lack of interactions may be
likely ascribable both to the current incompleteness of the human interactome and to the shortage of drugtarget information. As in the case of remdesivir, which being designed to target specifically virus proteins,
little is known about its human targetable proteins, leading to a less wired subgraph.

This is not the case of the heparin subnetwork (Figure 7f), where the highly complexity in its interaction
network perfectly matches its versatile role of anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral drug turning
out in a strong multifactorial impact in the new human coronavirus

55

. In fact, the heparin subnetwork

includes: disease genes associated to the complement and coagulation cascades pathway (MASP2, MBL2),
confirming its primary anticoagulant function; pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL12B and its receptor
IL12RB1) and chemokines (CXCL5, CXCL9, CXCL10), supporting its anti-inflammatory function; all the
disease genes of the antiviral drugs subnetworks (Figure 7a-d), linking to its antiviral action.
Yet, the networks of JAK inhibitors such as ruxolitinib (Figure 7i) and of the H1-antihistamines (Figure 7l)
strongly confirm their anti-inflammatory effect, showing common and specific key players of the
inflammatory response. In particular, ruxolitinib subnetwork includes several pro-inflammatory cytokines
(IFN-α, IFN-IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, TNF-α), chemokines (CCL2, CCL5), and other important specific
interleukines (IL-10, IL-4); whereas the H1-antihistamines network shows how the drug may control the
level of the interleukin IL-6, directly linked to the histamine receptor H1 (HRH1).

Materials and Methods
Human protein–protein interactome
The human protein–protein interactome was downloaded from the Supplementary Data of

14

, where the

authors merged their inhouse systematic human protein–protein interactome and 15 commonly used
databases with several types of experimental evidences (e.g., binary PPIs from three-dimensional protein
structures; literature-curated PPIs identified by affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry, Y2H,
and/ or literature-derived low-throughput experiments; signaling networks from literature-derived lowthroughput experiments; kinase-substrate interactions from literature-derived low-throughput and highthroughput experiments). This updated version of the human interactome is composed of 217,160 protein–
protein interactions (edges or links) connecting 15,970 unique proteins (nodes).

Disease-gene associations
Disease-associated genes were downloaded from Phenopedia 19, which provides a disease-centered view of
genetic association studies collecting by the online Human Genome Epidemiology (HuGE) encyclopedia 78.

The updated version of Phenopedia (released 27-04-2020) collects gene associations for 3,255 diseases.
Among them, we selected a panel of 14 diseases of interest with their associated genes (Supplementary Table
1).

Drug-target interactions and drug medical indications
Drug-target interactions were acquired from DrugBank

20

, which is a comprehensive, freely accessible,

online database containing information on drugs and drug targets. The updated version of DrugBank (version
5.1.6, released 22-04-2020) contains 13,563 drug entries including 2,627 approved small molecule drugs,
1,373 approved biologics (proteins, peptides, vaccines, and allergenics), 131 nutraceuticals, and over 6,370
experimental drugs. For our analysis, we selected a total of 1,875 FDA-approved drugs with at least one
annotated target. The target Uniprot IDs were mapped to Entrez gene IDs by using BioMart – Ensembl tool
(https://www.ensembl.org/). Note that, for some drugs of interest for which no targets were found in
DrugBank, we integrated drug-target interactions available from Therapeutic Target Database (TTD)
Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB)

80

79

and

database. In particular, for remdesivir (an anti-virus

drug designed to target specifically virus proteins), we extracted its human target information from TTD.
The known drug medical indications were obtained from TTD 79, whose last version was released on 11 Nov
2019.

SAveRUNNER algorithm
SAveRUNNER (Searching off-lAbel dRUg aNd NEtwoRk) is a network-based algorithm for drug
repurposing that, taking as input a list of drug targets and disease genes, constructs a drug-disease network
with predicted drug-disease associations by performing the steps that will be next discussed (Figure 8).
Step 1: Computation of network proximity
In order to investigate the extent to which disease and drug modules are close in the human interactome,
SAveRUNNER implements the network-based proximity measure defined as 14:
𝑝(𝑇, 𝑆) =

1
∑ 𝑚𝑖𝑛 𝑑(𝑡, 𝑠)
𝑠𝜖𝑆
‖𝑇‖
𝑡𝜖𝑇

which is the average shortest path length between drug targets 𝑡 in the drug module 𝑇 and the nearest disease
genes 𝑠 in the disease module 𝑆 (Figure 1b). To evaluate the statistical significance of the observed network
proximity between the two modules 𝑇 and 𝑆, SAveRUNNER builds a reference distance distribution
corresponding to the expected distance between two randomly selected groups of proteins with the same size
and degree distribution of the original sets of disease proteins and drug targets in the human interactome.
This procedure is repeated 1,000 times and the z statistics, together with the corresponding p-value, is
computed by using the mean and the standard deviation of the reference distance distribution.
Step 2: Computation of network similarity
The network proximity measure is then translated in a similarity measure assuming values in the range [0-1]:

𝑠𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑙𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑦 =

max(𝑝) − 𝑝
max(𝑝)

where null similarity means that the corresponding disease and drug modules are very distal in the human
interactome (i.e., 𝑝 is maximum); whereas maximum similarity means that the corresponding disease and
drug modules are very proximal in the human interactome (i.e., 𝑝 equal to zero).
Step 3: Selection of p-value threshold
In order to filter out statistically insignificant drug-disease associations, a significance level for the p-values
is set. It means that, given a disease A and a drug b, if the p-value associated to their distance in the human
interactome is smaller of the chosen significance level, the probability that the off-label drug b would be
effective for this disease A is greater than expected by chance. In our analysis, predicted drug-disease
associations with a p-value ≤ 0.05 were selected.
Step 4: Cluster detection
Next, SAveRUNNER performs a cluster analysis to detect groups of drugs and diseases in such a way that
members in the same group (cluster) are more similar to each other than to those in other groups (clusters).
To do that, SAveRUNNER exploits a cluster detection algorithm based on the greedy optimization of the
network modularity 81. Specifically, modularity measures the strength of network division into clusters, i.e.

networks with high modularity have dense connections between the nodes within clusters but sparse
connections between nodes in different clusters. The greedy clustering algorithm was adopted in view of its
good performance and high speed in detecting community structure from very large networks 81. The quality
of each cluster is evaluated by SAveRUNNER by computing the following quality cluster (𝑄𝐶) score:

𝑄𝐶 =

𝑊𝑖𝑛
𝑊𝑖𝑛 + 𝑊𝑜𝑢𝑡 + 𝑃

where 𝑊𝑖𝑛 denotes the total weight of edges within the cluster, 𝑊𝑜𝑢𝑡 denotes the total weight of edges
connecting this cluster to the rest of network, and 𝑃 is a penalty term which considers the node density
within the cluster.
Step 5: Adjustment of network similarity
The quality cluster score serves to reward associations between drugs and diseases belonging to the same
cluster, based on the assumption that if a drug and a disease group together is more likely that the drug can
be effectively repurposed for that disease. In this sense, we say that drug and the disease that are members of
the same cluster tend to be “more similar” and this translates into the following adjustment for the similarity:
𝑠𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑙𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑦 = (1 + 𝑄𝐶) ∙ 𝑠𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑙𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑦

(1)

Thus, whether two nodes fall in the same cluster their similarity value increases by a factor proportional to
the 𝑄𝐶 score of the cluster which they belong; otherwise whether two nodes do not fall in the same cluster
𝑄𝐶 is set to zero and their similarity value does not change.
Step 6: Normalization of network similarity
To bound the similarity measure defined in Eq. 1 to values that monotonically increase from 0 to 1,
SAveRUNNER performed a normalization procedure by applying the following sigmoid function:
𝑓(𝑥) =

1
1 + 𝑒 −𝑐(𝑥−𝑑)

where 𝑥 is the adjusted similarity measure (Eq. 1), d is the sigmoid midpoint (i.e., the value at which the
function approaches to 0.5), c is the sigmoid steepness. We set 𝑑 =

max(𝑥)
2

and 𝑐 = 10.

At the end of this step, SAveRUNNER offers a list of predicted/prioritized associations between drugs and
diseases as a weighted bipartite drug-disease network, in which one set of nodes corresponds to drugs and
the other one corresponds to diseases. A link between a drug and a disease occurs if the corresponding drug
targets and disease genes are nearby in the interactome more than expected by chance (p-value ≤ 0.05) and
the weight of their interaction corresponds to the adjusted and normalized similarity value.

Performance evaluation
The effectiveness of predicted drug–disease associations provided by the SAveRUNNER algorithm was
evaluated in terms of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) probability curve analysis. The drug–
disease associations were ranked according to increasing p-values and a “real association” was assigned
according to TTD information: 1 if the predicted drug-disease association is known, 0 otherwise. For a
specified p-value threshold, the true positive rate (i.e., sensitivity) was calculated as the fraction of known
associations that are correctly predicted, while the false positive rate (i.e., 1-specificity) was computed as the
fraction of unknown associations that are predicted. The ROC probability curve was drawn based on these
measures at different thresholds and the corresponding Area Under the Curve (AUC) was computed. Higher
the AUC, better the algorithm is at distinguishing between two classes (i.e., known drug-disease associations
versus unknown drug-disease associations).

Bi-Random walk-based algorithm
Inspired by an already existing algorithm of drug repurposing called MBiRW 46, we exploited a Bi-Random
walk-based (BiRW) approach to infer potential reuse for existing drugs. We started from the known drug–
disease associations available on the TTD
information retrieved from DrugBank

20

19

and iteratively we added new associations integrating

, for what concerns targets of already approved drugs, and from

Phenopedia 19, for what concerns disease genes. Denoting with 𝑚 the total number of the approved drugs and
𝑛 the total number of diseases, the known drug-disease associations were translated into a binary matrix
𝑚×𝑛
𝑊𝑟𝑑
by assigning 1 if the given drug (matrix row) is associated to a given disease (matrix column), and 0

otherwise. Next, a weighted adjacency matrix 𝑊𝑟𝑟𝑚×𝑚 was computed to model drug similarity, where weights
𝑛×𝑛
are the number of common targets between any pair of drugs. Further, a weighted adjacency matrix 𝑊𝑑𝑑

was computed to model disease similarity, where weights are the number of common disease genes between
any pair of diseases (Figure 9a).

In analogy with 46, the matrices 𝑊𝑟𝑟 and 𝑊𝑑𝑑 were adjusted based on the known drug–disease associations.
The underlying hypothesis is that drug (disease) pairs, whose similarity value is greater of what expected by
chance, are more likely to share common diseases (drugs).
From the adjusted matrix 𝑊𝑟𝑟 , a weighted drug similarity network was built, in which nodes are the
approved drugs and an edge occurs between two nodes if they share at least one target gene, with a weight
given by the corresponding element of the matrix 𝑊𝑟𝑟 . Likewise, from the adjusted matrix 𝑊𝑑𝑑 , a weighted
disease similarity network was built, in which nodes are the diseases, and an edge occurs between two
diseases if they share at least one disease gene, with a weight given by the corresponding element of the
matrix 𝑊𝑑𝑑 .
Next, new drug–disease associations were predicted through an iterative random walk process on drug and
disease similarity networks, simultaneously. Denoting with the parameters 𝑙 and 𝑟 the walks in the drug
network (left walks) and in the disease network (right walks), the bi-random walk can be described by the
following equations:
𝐴𝑙𝑡 = 𝛼𝑊𝑟𝑟 𝐴𝑡−1 + (1 − 𝛼)𝐴0

𝐴𝑟𝑡 = 𝛼𝐴𝑡−1 𝑊𝑑𝑑 + (1 − 𝛼)𝐴0
where 𝐴0 denotes the drug-disease association at 𝑡 = 0 (matrix 𝑊𝑟𝑑 ), while 𝐴𝑙𝑡 and 𝐴𝑟𝑡 represent the
predicted drug–disease associations at iteration 𝑡 starting from left or right, respectively. The hypothesis
behind is that an association between a drug R1 and a disease D1 can be added following these two avenues
(Figure 9b):
1. a random walker starts from a random vertex R1 of the drug similarity network and in each step
walks to one of the neighboring vertices (for instance R2, with a known or previously predicted
association with D1) with a probability proportional to the weight of the edge traversed (i.e., the
corresponding element of 𝑊𝑟𝑟 )

2. a random walker starts from a random vertex D1 of the disease similarity network and in each step
walks to one of the neighboring vertices (for instance D2, with a known or previously predicted
association with R1) with a probability proportional to the weight of the edge traversed (i.e., the
corresponding element of 𝑊𝑑𝑑 )
In both cases, the existence of a known association between a drug R1 and a disease D1 has been considered
with a probability (1 − α). Then, in each step of the iteration process, the predicted drug–disease
associations matrix 𝐴𝑡 is given by the mean between 𝐴𝑙𝑡 and 𝐴𝑟𝑡 .
Finally, a bipartite drug-disease network was constructed consisting of two sets of nodes: one set
corresponding to all disease, the other set corresponding to all approved drugs. An edge between a drug and
a disease occurs if an association is already known or has been predicted among them.
Tenfold cross-validation
The performance of BiRW-based algorithm in predicting new drug–disease associations was evaluated
through a tenfold cross validation 46. This is a technique to investigate the predictive power of an algorithm
by partitioning the original sample into a training and test set. In particular, the tenfold cross-validation
consists of randomly partitioning the original sample (in our case the drug-disease associations) into 10 equal
size subsamples. Of the 10 subsamples, a single subsample is retained as test set and the remaining 9
subsamples are used as training set. The cross-validation process is then repeated for 10 iterations so that
each of the 10 subsamples is used exactly once as the test set.
The results of each iteration were evaluated in terms of ROC probability curves. In particular, each time, the
predicted drug-disease associations were ranked according to the similarity score estimated by the BiRWbased algorithm (i.e., the corresponding element of matrix 𝐴𝑡 ) and the N top-ranked drug-disease
associations were selected to be evaluated by the ROC curve analysis, where N is the length of the test set.
It’s worth to stress that, in each cross-validation trial, we didn’t use the information about the known drug–
disease associations for the test set that were put to zero at first iteration of the bi-random walk process.
Then, the ROC curve is constructed for different values of a specified threshold, where a true drug–disease
association was considered as correctly predicted if the estimated similarity score of this association was
higher than the specified threshold. The results of the ROC curve analysis obtained for each iteration were

averaged to obtain a mean ROC curve and the corresponding Area Under the Curve (AUC) was calculated.
Higher the AUC, better the algorithm is at distinguishing between two classes (i.e., known drug-disease
associations versus unknown drug-disease associations).

Functional enrichment analysis
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis aiming to evaluate functional
pathways of SARS-CoV-associated disease genes was performed by using R statistical software and the
package clusterProfiler

82

. P-values were adjusted with the false discovery rate (FDR) method and a

threshold equal to 0.05 was set to identify functional annotations significantly enriched amongst the selected
gene lists.

Gene set enrichment analysis
In order to test whether the selected anti-SARS repurposable drugs can counteract the gene expression
perturbations caused by the virus, (i.e., whether they down-regulate genes up-regulated by the virus or vice
versa), we performed a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) as in

16

. We first collected gene expression

datasets of hosts infected SARS-CoV available through the GEO public repository. In particular:
transcriptome data of SARS-CoV-infected samples from patient’s peripheral blood (GSE1739) and Calu-3
cells (GSE33267). To define differentially expressed genes, we selected adjusted p-values less than 0.05 and
0.01 for GSE1739 and GSE33267 dataset, respectively. These differentially expressed genes were used as
SARS-CoV signatures, whereas the gene expression data of drug-treated human cell lines from the
Connectivity Map (CMAP) database 39 were used as drug signatures. For each drug that was in both CMAP
database and in our SARS-drug network, CMAP computed a score to evaluate the treatment effects of
various drugs on genes that are hallmarks for SARS disease phenotype. Selected repurposing candidates with
a score > 0 were considered to have potential treatment effect and the number of such SARS-CoV signature
datasets was used as the final GSEA score that ranges from 0 to N, being N the total number of SARS-CoV
signatures used.

Figure 6. Disease comorbidity. The bar plots show the values of the non-Euclidean separation distance computed for the SARSCoV (a) and SARS-CoV-2 (b) disease module with respect to all the other disease modules analyzed in this study.

Figure 7. Mechanism-of-action of anti-SARS-CoV repurposable drugs. The subnetworks show the inferred mechanism-of-action
for: antiviral drugs (a-d), tocilizumab (e), heparin (f), ACE-inhibitors (g-h), ruxolitinib (i), and H1-antistamines (l). Each subnetwork
was designed to point out the shortest paths from drug targets and SARS disease genes in the human interactome. In each
subnetwork, disease genes specifically targeted by each drug are marked with a yellow star; major histocompatibility complex of
class I (MCH-I) and pro-inflammatory cytokines shared by all drug networks are marked with an orange and a green circle,
respectively. Legend: red circles refer to SARS disease genes, blue squares refer to drug targets, red squares refer to SARS disease
genes that are also drug targets, violet circles refer to the first nearest neighbors (that are not disease genes) of the drug targets in the
human interactome. Anti-ACE drugs of panel (g) refer to enalapril, trandolapril, fosinopril, benazepril, cilazapril, zofenopril,
spirapril, rescinnamine, and quinapril. H1-anistamines of panel (l) refer to fexofenadine, levocetirizine, desloratadine, clemastine,
cetirizine.

Figure 8. SAveRUNNER algorithm. SAveRUNNER encompasses six steps: (1-3) compute a weighted bipartite drug-disease
network, where nodes are both drugs and diseases, edges are the statistically significant drug-disease associations (p-value ≤ selected
threshold), and weights are either the proximity or similarity measure; (4-6) compute the normalized adjusted similarity measure to
correct the weights of the drug-disease network and to prioritize the predicted drug-disease associations. Legend: QC is the quality
cluster score; 𝑊𝑖𝑛 is the total weight of edges within each cluster; 𝑊𝑜𝑢𝑡 is the total weight of edges connecting each cluster to the
rest of network; P is the node density within each cluster; c and d parameters are the sigmoid steepness and midpoint, respectively.

Figure 9. BiRW-based algorithm. Schematic representation of the construction of input matrices (a) and predicted drug-disease
associations network (b).
