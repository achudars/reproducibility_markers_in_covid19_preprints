Abstract
The emergence of COVID-19 has severely compromised the arsenal of antiviral and
antibiotic drugs. Drug discovery is a multistep process with a high failure rate, high
cost and it takes approximately 10-12 years for the development of new molecules
into the clinical candidate. On the other side, drug repurposing also called old drugs
for new uses, is an attractive alternative approach for a new application of marketed
FDA approved or investigational drugs. In the current pandemic situation raised due
to COVID-19, repurposing of existing FDA approved drugs are emerging as the first
line of the treatment. The causative viral agent of this highly contagious disease and
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) shares high nucleotide
similarity. Therefore, many existing viral targets are structurally expected to be similar
to SARS-CoV and likely to be inhibited by the same compounds. Here, we selected
three viral key proteins based on their vital role in viral life cycle: ACE2 (helps in entry
into the human host), viral nonstructural proteins RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
(RdRp) NSP12, and NSP16 which helps in replication, and viral latency (invasion from
immunity). The FDA approved drugs chloroquine (CQ), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ),
remdesivir (RDV) and arbidol (ABD) are emerging as promising agents to combat
COVID-19. Our hypothesis behind the docking studies is to determine the binding
affinities of these drugs and identify the key amino acid residues playing a key role in
their mechanism of action. The docking studies were carried out through Autodock
and online COVID-19 docking server. Further studies on a broad range of FDA
approved drugs including few more protein targets, molecular dynamics studies, invitro and in-vivo biological evaluation are required to identify the combination therapy
targeting various stages of the viral life cycle.

Introduction
The recent outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the new
coronavirus 2019-nCoV. Although the original epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in
December 2019 was located in the seafood market of Wuhan city, Hubei province of
China. [1] The disease has spread to more than 190 countries with over 1,353,361
conﬁrmed cases and over 79,235 conﬁrmed deaths worldwide in a very short span of
approximately three months as of April 08, 2020. [2] The extremely rapid chain
transmission and deadly pathogenic nature of this virus are some of the major
concerns for all sector of society across the world.[3] So far, the best possible solution
of this nightmare viral disease is only social distancing which is resulting in the
mandatory isolations/quarantines and lockdown across the word at different time
points. [4] Further, the lives of the millions of the people and the world economy have
been severely impacted due to this outbreak. The pathogenic nature of this agent
implicates a plausible sever biothreat across the globe. The severity of the COVID-19
outbreak could force to impose major changes to health system across the globe and
possible bring a major challenges to human being for the survival followed struggling
to keep the global economy on correct pace, if the spread of the virus is not eﬀ ectively
controlled. [5, 6]
The causative agent of this devastating disease COVID-19 belongs to Beta
coronavirus which shares 89.1% nucleotide similarity with acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (SARS-CoV). [7] The key amino acid residues are conserved in many viral
key drug targets, including those found in both SARS-CoV and COVID-19 pathogens.
Consequently, many common viral targets are structurally similar to SARS-CoV and
likely to be inhibited by the same compounds. The emergence of COVID-19 has
severely compromised the arsenal of antiviral and antibiotic drugs. New compounds
and targets are needed to meet the growing threat from Beta coronavirus. The
possibility that COVID-19 and other viruses/bacteria can be perniciously engineered
as biowarfare agents creates another demand for new treatment options. Drug
discovery is a multistep process with a high attrition rate, substantial cost and slow
pace of development of new molecules into the clinical candidate. On the other side,

drug repurposing also called old drugs for new uses, is an attractive alternative
approach for the new application of FDA approved or investigational drugs that are
outside the scope of the original medical condition. [8] There is a plethora of literature
evidence indicated the vital application of drug repurposing for various infectious
diseases.[9-11] Given the current scenario of COVID-19 outbreak across the world
and the complex nature of the disease repurposing of existing FDA approved drugs is
the first line of the treatment.
Given the pandemic nature of the disease, there is a hard-pressing need to uncover
the possible treatment/s as early as possible. The researchers and physicians have
been putting sincere efforts to understand this new virus, the pathophysiology of the
disease to and the possible therapeutic effective agents and vaccines. Tremendous
effects have been done to study the newly emerged virus and find potent drugs for
clinical usage. A PubMed search with key work COVID-19 resulted in more than 900
publications from November 01, 2019, to April 31, 2020. A glance at the title of these
papers indicated that the majority are focused on manifestations and treatment
options.
It has been shown in the literature that the FDA approved antimalarial and autoimmune
disease drug chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), known to inhibit
viral infection by raising endosomal pH necessary for the interaction of virus/cell
fusion.[12,

13]

[14]

HCQ

interferes

glycosylation

or

glycosyltransferases within human cells or inhibits sialic acid biosynthesis by inhibiting
quinone reductase 2. The immunomodulatory property of chloroquine synergistically
involved with the anti-viral property. The antiviral drug remdesivir (RDV) can inhibit
the growth of COVID-19 and found to be efficacious in the clinic in combination.[13,
15, 16] [17]The mechanism of action of RDV is under investigation, however, the high
sequence similarity (>95%) between COVID-19 and SARS-CoV RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase (RdRp) indicating the inhibition of RdRp. Similarly, the broad-spectrum
virus-host cell fusion inhibitor marketed antiviral drug arbidol (ABD), prevents the
entry of the virus entry into the host cell acting through ACE2 has entered into a clinical
trial for the treatment of COVID-19. [18, 19]
Inspired from the current pandemic situation and our experience in drug
repurposing/drug design through computational and medicinal chemistry tools, we
have carried docking studies with selected FDA approved drugs against COVID-19
selected key protein targets. Given the complex nature of this rapidly and severely

infecting lower respiratory system disease, our hypothesis is to identify FDA approved
drug combinations targeting the different key viral proteins. The selection of the key
proteins is based on the virus life cycle starting from attachment onto the human host,
replication, viral latency (invasion from immunity), release and complex nature of the
disease. The selection of four key targets: PDB ID: 6LZG which is the structure of
novel coronavirus spike receptor-binding domain complexed with its receptor ACE2;
PDB ID: 6NUR a recently identified SARS-Coronavirus NSP12 bound to NSP7 and
NSP8 co-factors, PDB ID: 6W4H the crystal structure of NSP16-NSP10 Complex from
SARS-CoV-2 of SARS-COV, and homology model of nonstructural protein 12 (nsp12)
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) with RNA and without RNA. While we
carried out the docking with the homology model of RdRP, the crystal structure of PDB
ID: 6M71 SARS-Cov-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in complex with cofactors
was reported. So, we carried out the docking using this crystal structure as well. The
online COVID-19 Docking Server” (http://ncov.schanglab.org.cn) which contains the
homology model of COVID-19 RdRp with RNA and without RNA was taken in the
experiment. The non-structural proteins, nsp16-nsp10 and 3plPro play an important
role in virus genome replication and evasion from innate immunity.

Experimental section
Docking methodology:

Molecular docking studies are a method of providing

valuable information on the rationale of designing ligands for a particularly active site
of a well-known macromolecule. This is an economic and modern trend of drug
discovery where technology base ligand-protein interaction reveals the presynthesizing possibilities. The in-silico study of the four FDA drugs chloroquine (CQ),
hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), remdesivir (RDV), and arbidol (ABD) (Figure 1) was
performing blind docking both in online and offline modes.

The offline docking was carried out using Autodock 4.2 program package
(http://autodock.scripps.edu/).[20] The X-ray crystal structures of three different
proteins were retrieved from the RCSB protein data bank (www.rscb.org).
Macromolecule having PDB ID: 6LZG which is the structure of novel coronavirus spike
receptor-binding domain complexed with its receptor ACE2; 6NUR a recently identified
SARS-Coronavirus NSP12 bound to NSP7 and NSP8 co-factors, 6M71 SARS-Cov-2
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in complex with cofactors and 6W4H the crystal
Structure of NSP16 - NSP10 Complex from SARS-CoV-2 of SARS-COV were
selected based on the resolution and similarity with COVID-19. All the protein and
ligand preparation were performed using MGL Tools 1.5.6 and Autodock Tool (ADT).
The energy was minimized using Chem 3D program file. Standard precision with
flexible ligand sampling was used and no specific grid was used at any stage of the
experiment. The ADT was used to calculate the binding free energies and inhibition
constant of the best-docked complex of the aforementioned proteins. Observation and
visualization of the results were carried out using the latest version of Discovery Studio
Visualizer

(https://www.3dsbiovia.com/products/collaborative-science/biovia-

discovery-studio/visualization-download.php). Finally, the top binding modes are
according to their energy calculation as the default parameter in AutoDoc.
Further to expand the specificity, we performed online docking by using “The COVID19 Docking Server” (http://ncov.schanglab.org.cn) which contains the structure of the
proteins involved in SARS-CoV virus life cycle based on the homologs of coronavirus.
[21, 22] Ligands preparation and energy minimization were carried out using the Chem
3D application and uploaded to the server in .mol2 format. Autodock Vina was used
as a docking engine in the sever and prepared Nonstructural protein 12 (nsp12) RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) with RNA and without RNA was taken in the
experiment. All the standard parameters were set as default except the
exhaustiveness value is set to 12 to achieve higher accuracy. Visualization of the
result was done by the latest version of Discovery Studio Visualizer and binding free
energy was collected from the aforesaid web server.[23]
Results and discussion:
1. The binding mode analysis and predicated binding affinity calculations of
chloroquine (CQ) against surface receptor and nonstructural proteins: The Auto
dock software was used for molecular docking studies of chloroquine (CQ) against the

novel coronavirus spike receptor-binding domain complexed with its receptor ACE2
(PDB ID 6LZG) revealed the interaction of CQ

with TRP349 ALA348 PRO346

ASP350 as shown in Figure 2 A. The negative values of the binding free energy (6.67 kcal/mole) further indicated the stability of the complex (Table 1). The receptor
pocket and top 10 conformers are shown in figure 2A. Similarly, the docking studies
and binding mode analysis of CQ against SARS-Coronavirus NSP12 bound to NSP7
and NSP8 co-factors (PDB ID 6NUR) showed the interactions with MET542 ALA558
ARG624 SER682 SER681 ASP623 ASP452 ALA554 (figure 2B). The negative free
energy calculation (-6.49 kcal/mole) as shown in table 1 is an indication of the
interaction of CQ with nonstructural viral proteins. Our docking studies of CQ with
NSP16- NSP10, however, our docking methodology did not work very well with this
target resulted in the high positive values of binding energy (data are not shown here).
We will further improve our next publications.

2. The binding mode analysis and predicated binding affinity calculations of
chloroquine against the homology model of COVID-19 RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase (RdRP): The viral nonstructural protein 12 (nsp12) or RNA-dependent
RNA polymerase, RdRp) is essential for the replication and transcription of the viral
genome. RdRp upon binding with the cofactors nsp7 and nsp8 catalyze the replication
of RNA from an RNA template. The structure of viral RdRp of COVID-19 is not yet
known, however, recently a web-based COVID-19 docking server has been launched
which incorporates the homology model of RdRp built on PDB ID 6NUR, RdRp crystal
structure of SARS-COV. Two structures of RdRp, one structure is constructed with
RNA and others without RNA were reported for small molecules docking. Therefore,
this web-based server was utilized for docking studies of CQ. The docking studies of
RdRp with RNA revealed the interaction of CQ with A Chain: ALA840 ARG858
ARG555 ALA547 PHE441 ILE548 P Chain: G7 as shown in figure 3 A. The negative

values of the binding free energy (-7.10 kcal/mole) further indicated the stability of the
complex (Table 2). The receptor pocket and top 10 conformers are shown in figure 3
A. Similarly, the docking studies of CQ on RdRp without RNA revealed the interaction
of CQ with A Chain: ALA558 THR556 SER682 ASP452 ARG624 ASP623 as shown
in figure 3 B. The negative values of the binding free energy (-6.20 kcal/mole) further
indicated the stability of the complex (Table 2). The receptor pocket and top 10
conformers are shown in figure 3 A.

3. The binding mode analysis and predicated binding affinity calculations of
hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) against surface receptor and nonstructural proteins:
The Auto dock software was used for molecular docking studies of hydroxychloroquine
(HCQ) against the novel coronavirus spike receptor-binding domain complexed with
its receptor ACE2 (PDB ID 6LZG) revealed the interaction of HCQ with ASP382
HIS378 HIS401 ASP350 TRP349 as shown in figure 4 A. The negative values of the
binding free energy (-6.65 kcal/mole) further indicated the stability of the complex
(Table 3). The receptor pocket and top 10 conformers are shown in figure 4A.
Similarly, the docking studies and binding mode analysis of HCQ against SARSCoronavirus NSP12 bound to NSP7 and NSP8 co-factors (PDB ID 6NUR) showed the
interactions with ASP452 VAL667 MET542 ALA558 VAL557 ARG624 SER682
THR556 SER681 ASP623 (figure 4B). The negative free energy calculation (-6.75
kcal/mole) as shown in table 3 is an indication of the interaction of HCQ with

nonstructural viral proteins. Our docking studies of HCQ with NSP16- NSP10,
however, our docking methodology did not work very well with this target resulted in
the high positive values of binding energy (data are not shown here). We will further
improve our next publications.

4. The binding mode analysis and predicated binding affinity calculations of
hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) against the homology model of COVID-19 RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRP): As mention in the binding mode of CQ with
RdRp, Therefore, this web-based server was utilized for docking studies of HCQ. The
docking studies of RdRp with RNA revealed the interaction of HCQ with A Chain:
A Chain: ARG858 ILE548 ALA547 ARG836
P Chain: G6 G7 as shown in figure 5 A. The negative values of the binding free
energy (-7.20 kcal/mole) further indicated the stability of the complex (Table 2). The
receptor pocket and top 10 conformers are shown in figure 5 A. Similarly, the docking
studies of HCQ on RdRp without RNA revealed the interaction of HCQ with A Chain:
TYR456 THR680 TYR455 ARG553 ASP623 as shown in figure 5 B. The negative
values of the binding free energy (-6.00 kcal/mole) further indicated the stability of the
complex (Table 2). The receptor pocket and top 10 conformers are shown in figure 5
A.

5. The binding mode analysis and predicated binding affinity calculations of
remdesivir against surface receptor and nonstructural proteins: Molecular
docking studies of remdesivir (RDV) against the novel coronavirus spike receptorbinding domain complexed with its receptor ACE2 (PDB ID 6LZG) revealed the
interaction of RDV with TYR385 ALA348 GLU398 ARG514 as shown in figure 6 A.
The negative values of the binding free energy (-4.55 kcal/mole) further indicated the
stability of the complex (Table 5). The receptor pocket and top 10 conformers are
shown in figure 6 A. Similarly, the docking studies and binding mode analysis of RDV
against SARS-Coronavirus NSP12 bound to NSP7 and NSP8 co-factors (PDB ID
6NUR) showed the interactions with ALA558 LYS676 ARG553 ASP623 ARG555
SER682 TYR456 VAL667 VAL557 ARG624 (figure 6 B). The negative free energy
calculation (-4.34 kcal/mole) as shown in table 3 is an indication of the interaction of
RDV with nonstructural viral proteins. Our docking studies of RDV with NSP16NSP10, however, our docking methodology did not work very well with this target
resulted in the high positive values of binding energy (data are not shown here). We
will further improve our next publications.

7. The binding mode analysis and predicated binding affinity calculations of
arbidol against surface receptor and nonstructural proteins: Molecular docking
studies of arbidol (ABD) against the novel coronavirus spike receptor-binding domain
complexed with its receptor ACE2 (PDB ID 6LZG) revealed the interaction of ABD with
ASP350 TRP349 ALA348 HIS378 ASP382 HIS401 as shown in figure 8A. The
negative values of the binding free energy (-7.49 kcal/mole) further indicated the

Here, we report the preliminary docking studies of the selected FDA approved drugs
which have shown promising anti-COVID-19 activity. Literature evidences are
indicating a single drug is probably not effective for the treatment of this disease. The
viral polymerases and proteases are known to be the most suitable targets for the
treatment of viral born disease. Therefore, we selected the targets to cover a range of
targets starting from the entry point to the multiplication and release of the viruses. In
our in-silico experiment based on mainly molecular docking approach, we investigated
four different types of pharmacologically active and US-FDA approved drugs towards
their potential application alone or in combination with drug repurposing. Our studies
can give an insight into the possible the pocket(s) of ligand interaction, best conformer
and its orientation and interactions with the respective targets. The molecules are
arranged in decreasing order of their binding free energies, in respective tables. Based
on their binding affinity, we found that these compounds may be potential inhibitors
against SARS-CoV having promising interactions with the selected targets.
Future direction and limitations of the study: The work presented here is a
preliminary study based on the hypothesis to repurpose the FDA approved drugs to
identify the combination therapy potentially targeting the various stages of the virus
life cycle for the management of COVID-19. The study needs further investigation
through the various computational tool and further detailed biological evaluation for
the selection of possible combination therapy to potentially deal with the current
pandemic situation.
