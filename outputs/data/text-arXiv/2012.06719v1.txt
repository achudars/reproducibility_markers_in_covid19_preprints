Abstract
COVID pandemic has catalysed the development of novel coronavirus vaccines across pharmaceutical
companies and research organizations. In a situation where the vaccine is still unavailable and the disease
is spreading exponentially, an effective control measures seems to be the need of an hour to at least contain
the size of the disease. In this context, age related transmissibility of COVID-19 has become a public
health concern. This disease has caused the most severe health issues for adults over the age of 60 with
particularly fatal results for those 80 years and old. In this situation an age structured modelling could be
helpful in understanding the spread of the disease across different age groups. In this study initially, we
propose an age structured model and calculate the equilibrium points and basic reproduction number. Later
we propose an optimal control problem to understand the roles of treatment in controlling the epidemic.
From the Stability analysis we see that the infection free equilibrium remains asymptotically stable whenever
R0 < 1 and as R0 crosses unity we have the infected equilibrium to be stable. From the sensitivity analysis
parameters u11 , b1 , β1 , d1 and µ were found to be sensitive. Findings from the Optimal Control studies
suggests that the infection among the adult population(age ≥ 30) is least considering the second control u12
whereas, when both the controls u11 and u12 are considered together the infectives is minimum in case of
young populations(age ≤ 30). The cumulative infected population reduced the maximum when the second
control was considered followed by considering both the controls together. The control u12 was effective for
mild epidemic (R0 ∈ (1, 2)) whereas control u11 was found to be highly effective when epidemic was severe
(R0 ∈ (2, 7)) for the population of age group (≤ 30). Whereas for age group (≥ 30) the control u12 was
highly effective for the entire range of basic reproduction number. The effect of saturation level in treatment
is also explored numerically.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious respiratory and vascular disease caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The Coronavirus caused disease COVID-19 has been declared a pandemic by WHO. As on 20 November 2020, around 55 million have been affected and around 1.3
million have lost their worldwide [3]. The social and economic life of people is drastically affected by this
COVID-19 Pandemic.
This pandemic has catalysed the development of novel coronavirus vaccines across pharmaceutical companies
and research organizations. Many potential vaccines for COVID-19 are being studied and some are under
clinical trials. Drugs such as remdesivir, favipiravir, ivermectin, lopinavir/ritonavir, mRNA-1273, phase I trial
(NCT04280224) and AVT technology are being used as therapeutic agents by different countries for treating
Covid-19 [1, 2, 4, 18]. Therefore, in situation where the vaccine is still unavailable and the disease is spreading
exponentially, an effective control measures has become the need of an hour to at least contain the size of the
disease.
In this context age related transmissibility of COVID-19 has become a public health concern. It has caused
the most severe health issues for adults over the age of 60 with particularly fatal results for those 80 years and
older. This is due to the number of underlying health conditions present in older populations [5]. A study
with 425 patients indicated that the median age was 59 years (range, 15 to 89) and reported different case
distributions in four age groups groups: 0 – 14, 15 – 44 , 45 73 – 64 , and ¿ 65 years [6]. However, there is no
enough epidemiological evidence to classify the age groups in transmission. Age structure modelling studies for

1

diseases such as influenza and Dengue can be found in ([16], [11]).
Motivated by the above, in this study, we have proposed a non-linear age structured compartmental model
in which the population is divided into two age groups. The first group with age ≤ 30(we call this group by
young population) and the other group with age≥ 30(we call this group by adult population) and in each of
these age groups we have three compartments, namely susceptible denoted by S1 (young) and S2 (adult), infected
denoted by I1 (young) and I2 (adult) and recovered denoted by R1 (young) and R2 (adult). Later, we frame an
optimal control problem to understand the role of treatments by considering them as controls in the two age
groups considered.
We have used Holling type III recovery rate function of infected adult individuals wherein the treatment
provided initially is less, owing to less infected individuals, and as the epidemic progresses, the treatment
increases accordingly and non-linearly saturates due to limitations on medical facilities.
The section-wise split-up of the paper is as follows: In the next section we talk about the formulation of age
structured model followed by the Positivity and Boundedness of the model. In section 3 the equilibrium points
and the basic reproduction number is calculated following which the stability of equilibrium is analysed. In
section 5 we perform the sensitivity analysis of the parameters of the model. We formulate an optimal control
problem and do the simulations to see the role of the controls in reducing the infection in section 6. Finally, we
present the discussions and conclusions.

Model Formulation

We have divided the entire population into two age groups, one with age ≤ 30(we call this group as young
population) and the other ones with age ≥ 30(we call this group as adult population). In each of these groups
we have three compartments namely susceptible(S1 , S2 ), Infected(I1 , I2 ) and the Recovered(R1 , R2 ). At any
time an individual can be in one of the states namely susceptible, infected, or removed. Susceptibles are
the ones who are not infected but can get infected when it comes in contact with he infected ones. Infected
are those who spread the infection to others and ones an infected individual recovers from the disease then
he develops immunity against the disease and is said to be recovered. The parameters β1 , β2 , β3 , β4 are the
infection rates corresponding to two age groups considered. We assume that there is a constant birth rate of
the young susceptible population denoted by parameter b1 and also the recovered can again become susceptible
again with rate δ1 and δ2 . Transition rate or maturation rate describing transition from age group to another
is used and is denoted by parameters m. We have assumed that the natural mortality rate is common across
all the compartments and is denoted by parameter µ, whereas the disease induced death rate differs among age
groups denoted by d1 and d2 . As the recovery from a disease differs among different age groups we denote the
recovery rate for the first age group by u11 and for the second group by u12 . This model leads to the system of
ordinary differential equations as follows:

Positivity and Boundedness

We now show that if the initial conditions of the system (1)-(6) are positive, then the solution remain positive
for any future time. Using the equations (1)-(6), we get,

Thus all the above rates are non-negative on the bounding planes (given by S1 = 0, I1 = 0, R1 = 0, S2 = 0,
I2 = 0, and R2 = 0) of the non-negative region of the real space. So, if a solution begins in the interior of
this region, it will remain inside it throughout time t. This happens because the direction of the vector field
is always in the inward direction on the bounding planes as indicated by the above inequalities. Hence, we
conclude that all the solutions of the the system (1)-(6) remain positive for any time t > 0 provided that the
initial conditions are positive. This establishes the positivity of the solutions of the system (1)-(6). Next we
will show that the solution is bounded.
Boundedness: Let N (t) = S1 (t) + I1 (t) + R1 (t) + S2 (t) + I2 (t) + R2 (t)

Equilibrium points and Reproduction Number

The system (1.1)-(1.6) admits two equilibrium namely the disease free equilibrium and the infected equilibrium.
The disease free equilibrium denoted by E0 is calculated to be,

Calculation of R0

The basic reproduction number which is the average number of secondary cases produced per primary case is
calculated using the next generation matrix method described in [8]. Our system (1.1)-(1.6) has two infected
states and four uninfected states. Calculating the jacobian matrix at infection free equilibrium E0 considering
infected states we have,

Numerical Simulation

Parameters Values In the following table we provide the parameter values and the source from which the
parameter values are taken. Since the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) mimics
the influenza virus regarding clinical presentation, transmission mechanism, and seasonal coincidence [7] and
also due to the lack of data on the age structure modelling of COVID-19, we have taken some of the parameter
values from the work on influenza disease [11]. In similar lines to ([11],[12]) for numerical simulation we take
the values of δ1 and δ2 and u11 and u12 to be same. Taking parameter values from table 2, we will numerically
show the asymptotic stability of E0 and E1 based on the values of basic reproduction number in similar lines
to [11].

Stability of infection free equilibrium
We will numerically show that whenever we have R0 < 1 the infection free equilibrium E0 is locally asymptotically stable. For the parameter values from table 3, the value of R0 was calculated as 0.98 and E0 =
(0.1157, .00039, 0, 0, 0, 0). From figure 1 we see that the disease free equilibrium E0 is locally asymptotically
stable. The initial values were taken as (S1, S2, I1, I2, R1, R2) = (100, 150, 5, 70, 10, 30)

Stability of infected equilibrium
Here we shall numerically show that whenever the value of basic reproduction number denoted by R0 crosses
unity we have the infected equilibrium E1 to be locally asymptotically stable. The value of R0 was calculated
to be 2.7615 and E1 = (10.42, 1, 0.144, 0.0041, 0.03, 0.0005) for the parameter values from table 4 . From figure
2 we see that the infected equilibrium E1 is locally asymptotically stable provided R0 > 1. The initial values
were taken as (S1 , S2 , I1 , I2 , R1 , R2 ) = (100, 200, 1, 2, 1, 2).

Corona virus has caused the most severe health issues for adults over the age of 60 — with particularly fatal
results for those 80 years and older[5]. With the parameter values from table 2, now we will numerically illustrate
this fact. From figure 3 we see that the number of infected cases in case of adult population is comparatively
higher than that in case of young.

Sensitivity Analysis

In this section we check the sensitivity of all the parameters of the model (1.1)-(1.6). As each parameter is
varied in different intervals, the total infected cell population, mean infected cell population and the mean square
error are plotted with respect to time. These plots are used to determine the sensitivity of the parameter. The
different intervals chosen are given in the following table 5. The fixed parameter values are taken from table 2.

Parameter b1

The results related to sensitivity of b1 , varied in three intervals as mentioned in table 5, are given in figure
(4-6). The plots of infected population for each varied value of the parameter b1 per interval, the mean infected

the parameter b1 is not sensitive in interval III and sensitive in I and II.

The results related to sensitivity of µ, varied in two intervals as mentioned in table 5, are given in figure (78). The plots of infected population for each varied value of the parameter µ per interval, the mean infected

the parameter µ is sensitive in interval I and insensitive in II.

The results related to sensitivity of β1 , varied in two intervals as mentioned in table 5, are given in figure (910). The plots of infected population for each varied value of the parameter β1 per interval, the mean infected

the parameter β1 is sensitive in interval I and insensitive in II. In similar lines, the sensitivity analysis is done

OPTIMAL CONTROL PROBLEM

In this section, we will formulate an optimal control problem to see the role of treatment in reducing the number
of infection. The controls that we considered are:
1. The first control that we consider is the treatment based recovery of young infected individuals as a result of
which an infected young individual recovers. This treatment could be any common drugs interventions that
are recommended in the treatment of COVID-19. Many potential vaccines for COVID-19 are being studied
and some are under clinical trials. Drugs such as remdesivir, favipiravir, ivermectin, lopinavir/ritonavir,
mRNA-1273, phase I trial (NCT04280224) and AVT technology are being used as therapeutic agents by
different countries for treating Covid-19 [1, 2, 4, 18]. We denote this intervention by the control variable
u11 .

2. The second control that we consider is the treatment based recovery of adult Population. We consider a
µ2 I22
µ2 I22
limited treatment as 1+αI
2 where µ2 (t) is a constant treatment rate. Here 1+αI 2 represents Holling type
2
2
III response where the initial treatment is less because of less infectives and as the disease spreads, the
treatment also increases and non-linearly saturates due to the limitation in the medical facilities.
The set of all admissible controls is given by
U = {(u11 (t), u12 (t)) : u11 (t) ∈ [0, u11 max], u12 (t) ∈ [0, u12 max], t ∈ [0, T ]}
Without medical interventions, u11 and u12 , are just constant parameters.
In order to reduce the complexity of the problem here we choose to model the control efforts via a linear
combination of the quadratic terms. Also when the objective function is quadratic with respect to the control,

14

differential equations arising from optimization have a known solution. Other functional forms sometimes lead
to systems of differential equations that are difficult to solve ([9], [13]). Based on these we now propose and
define the optimal control problem with the goal to reduce the cost functional defines as follows,

The integrand of the cost function (6.1), denoted by
L(S, I, V, u11 , u12 ) = (I1 (t) + I2 (t) + A1 u11 (t)2 + A2 u12 (t)2 )
is called the Lagrangian or the running cost.
Here, the cost function represents the number of infected population throughout the observation period, and
the overall cost of implementation of the treatments. Effectively, we want to minimize the infected population
and the cost. Here, A1 and A2 are positive weight constants which not only balance units of integrand but also
related cost.
The admissible solution set for the Optimal Control Problem (6.1)-(6.2) is given by
Ω = {(S1 , I1 , R1 , S2 , I2 , R2 , u11 , u12 ) | S1 , I1 , S2 , I2 , R1 , R2 that satisfy (8)}
EXISTENCE OF OPTIMAL CONTROL
We will show the existence of optimal control functions that minimize the cost functions within a finite time
span [0, T ] showing that we satisfy the conditions stated in Theorem 4.1 of [10].
Theorem 1. There exists a 2-tuple of optimal controls (u∗11 (t), u∗12 (t)) in the set of admissible controls U such
that the cost functional is minimized i.e.,

(u11 ,u12 )∈U

corresponding to the optimal control problem (6.1)-(6.2).
Proof. In order to show the existence of optimal control functions, we will show that the following conditions
are satisfied :
1. The solution set for the system (6.2) along with bounded controls must be non-empty, i.e., Ω 6= φ.
2. U is closed and convex and system should be expressed linearly in terms of the control variables with
coefficients that are functions of time and state variables.
3. The Lagrangian L should be convex on U and L(S, I, V, u11 , u12 ) ≥ g(u11 , u12 ), where g(u11 , u12 ) is a
continuous function of control variables such that |(u11 , u12 )|−1 g(u11 , u12 ) → ∞ whenever |(u11 , u12 )| →
∞, where |.| is an l2 (0, T ) norm.
Now we will show that each of the conditions are satisfied :
1. From Positivity and boundedness of solutions of the system(6.2), all solutions are bounded for each
bounded control variable in U .
Also,the right hand side of the system (6.2) satisfies Lipschitz condition with respect to state variables.
15

Hence, using the positivity and boundedness condition and the existence of solution from Picard-Lindelof
Theorem[15], we have satisfied condition 1.
2. U is closed and convex by definition. Also, the system (6.2) is clearly linear with respect to controls such
that coefficients are only state variables or functions dependent on time. Hence condition 2 is satisfied.
3. Choosing g(u11 , u12 ) = c(u211 + u212 ) such that c = min {A1 , A2 }, we can satisfy the condition 3.
Hence there exists a control 2-tuple (u∗11 , u∗12 ) ∈ U that minimizes the cost function (6.1).
CHARACTERIZATION OF OPTIMAL CONTROL
We will obtain the necessary conditions for optimal control functions using the Pontryagin’s Maximum
Principle [14] and also obtain the characteristics of the optimal controls.
The Hamiltonian for this problem is given by

H(S, I, V, u11 , u12 , u2 , λ) := L(S1 , I1 , R1 , S2 , I2 , R2 , u11 , u12 )+λ1

Simulations for Optimal Control Problem

In this section, we perform numerical simulations to understand the role of the treatments in reducing the
infection. Entire simulations is done using MATLAB software.
16

The various combinations of controls considered are:
1. Implementation of treatment only for young population
2. Implementation of treatment only for adult population.
3. Implementation of treatment for both young and the adult population.
For our simulations, we have taken the total number of days as T = 100 and the other fixed parameters
from table 2.
We first solve the state system numerically using Fourth Order Runge-Kutta method in MATLAB without
any interventions along with the initial values as (S1 , S2 , I1 , I2 , R1 , R2 ) = (100, 100, 10, 10, 5, 5)
Now, to simulate the system with controls, we use the Forward-Backward Sweep method stating with the
initial values of controls and solve the state system forward in time. Following this we solve the adjoint state
system backward in time due to the transversality conditions, using the optimal state variables and initial values
of optimal control.
Now, using the values of adjoint state variables, the values of optimal control are updated and with these
updated control variables, we go through this process again. We continue this till the convergence criterion is
met [14]. In similar lines to [19] the positive weights chosen for objective coefficients are A1 = .0001, A2 = .005.
We have chosen the weights related to the treatment of adults 10 times more than that of young ones because
the cost related to the treatment of adult population is generally higher compared to the cost of treatment of
young.
First, we solve system (6.2) in the absence of the controls (u11 = 0, u12 = 0) along with same initial
population size. The corresponding count of the infectives (I1 , I2 ) are shown in figures 11 and 12 with blue
color. From figure 11 we see that the number of infected adult cases considering the implementation of controls
are less than the case considering no controls and best result is obtained when the control u12 is considered
alone as the number of infected adult population is least compared to the other two cases.

Figure 11: I2 under optimal controls u∗11 , u∗12

17

We also calculate the average values of infected adult population in table 7 over the time period t = 100 to
support the above fact.

In figure 12 we simulate the infected young population over the time considering different control combinations. We see from the figure that the number of infectives is higher when no control is implemented and as
treatment is implemented the number of infectives reduces and reduces the maximum when both u11 and u12
is considered followed by considering only u11 .
We also calculate the average values of the infected young population over the time period considered. From
table 8 we see that the average value of infected young population is least in case when both the controls are
implemented.

We also simulate the recovered population over the time with and without controls in figure 13 and figure
14. From Figure 13 we see that the recovered young population is highest when the control u11 is considered.
Whereas the recovered young population remains almost constant at constant value 5 in case of second control
u12 consideration. From figure 13 we also see that the recovered population curve considering u12 alone and
the curve without controls coincide with each other. The reason for this could be that the second control u12
features only in the second age group(adult) population considered in the model.
From figure 14 we see that the recovered adult population is highest considering the control u12 whereas it is
least in case of no control consideration and implementation of only u11 . Similar to the previous case we see that
the recovered population curve considering u11 alone and the curve without controls coincide with each other
and the reason for this could be that the control u11 features only in the first age group(young) population
considered in the model. In figure 15 we plot the cumulative infected population over the time considering
different controls and we see that the cumulative count of the infectives is minimum when the second control
u12 is considered followed by considering both the controls. Average values of the recovered population are
calculated for young and adult population considering different combinations of the controls in table 9 and
table 10.

The Effect of R0 on Optimal Controls and on Disease Burden

This section devotes to study the dynamics of disease and the effect of optimal controls on the disease when the
basic reproduction number (R0 ) varies. Since the severity of the epidemic characterized by the high epidemic
peaks which is measured by the higher values of R0 , therefore we will observe the prevalence of the cumulative
count of the disease by varying the basic reproduction number. For this purpose, we will consider the basic
reproduction number R0 in absence of any controls i.e. u11 = 0 and u12 = 0 as follows for the system (1.1)-(1.6):
21

R0 =

(β1 S∗1 p + β4 S∗2 q) +
2

√

M

where,
p=

1
d1 + µ

q=

1
d2 + µ

We choose the parameters same as taken above for the comparative study to explore the impact of R0 on
optimal controls and on the disease. For this purpose, the total infected population is plotted to depict the
severity of the disease by varying the degree of transmissibility as reflected by the basic reproduction number
R0 for different control strategies.
In figure (16,17,18) we plot the effect of R0 on the infected young population, infected adult and the
cumulative infected population considering different controls. Our findings suggest that when the epidemic is
mild (R0 ∈ (1; 1.5)), the second control u12 treatment works better than the control u11 as given in yellow and
violet colored curves in figure 16. Whereas when severity of the epidemic increases (R0 ∈ (1.5; 7)), the effect
of the controls u11 and u11 and u12 together is found to be better than the effect of u12 alone. From figure 17
and figure 18 we see that the treatment u12 works better in keeping the severity very low throughout the range
of the basic reproduction number (R0 ∈ (1; 7)) as shown in yellow colored curve in the figure 17 followed by
the combined effect of both the controls. In figure 19 we plot the cumulative recovered population and see that
with the control u12 , we have the highest recovered population throughout the range of the basic reproduction
number (R0 ∈ (1; 7)).

The Effect of α and R0 on Optimal Controls and Disease Burden

In this section we focus on studying the effect of saturation level in treatment by varying the value of α on
the disease burden for mild as well as severe epidemic for each designed control strategy. In figure 20 we plot
the effect of α on the cumulative count of infected population considering both the controls u11 and u12 . We
observed from figure 20 that the cumulative count of the disease grows significantly as the level of saturation
increases for entire range of R0 . In figure 21 we consider the control u12 alone and study the effect of α by
varying the value of α on the disease burden. Here again we see that the cumulative count of the disease grows
significantly as the level of saturation increases but as epidemic becomes severe (R0 > 5) the effect of α remains
the same as the cumulative count of infection saturates.

Discussion and Conclusion

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious respiratory and vascular disease caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The Coronavirus caused disease COVID-19 has been declared a pandemic by WHO. As on 20 November 2020, around 55 million have been affected and around 1.3
million have lost their worldwide [3].
In this study, initially we have proposed a non-linear age structured compartmental model in which the
population is divided into two age groups the young (age ≤30) and the adult ones (≥30) and in each of to age
groups we have three compartments, namely susceptible denoted by S1 (young) and S2 (adult), infected denoted
by I1 (young) and I2 (adult) and recovered denoted by R1 (young) and R2 (adult). We have used Holling type
III recovery rate function of infected adult individuals wherein the treatment provided initially is less, owing to
less infected individuals, and as the epidemic progresses, the treatment increases accordingly and non-linearly
saturates due to limitations on medical facilities. Later we proposed an optimal control problem to investigate
the role of the control strategies namely the role of treatments in reducing the infection.
From the Stability analysis we conclude that the infection free equilibrium remains asymptotically stable
whenever R0 < 1 and as R0 crosses unity we have the infected equilibrium to be stable. From the sensitivity
analysis of the parameters of the model we conclude that the parameters u11 , b1 , β1 , d1 and µ are the only
sensitive parameters in some intervals as discussed in table 6. Findings from the Optimal Control studies
suggests that the infection among the adult population(age ≥ 30) is least considering the second control u12
whereas, when both the controls u11 and u12 are considered together the infectives is minimum in case of young
populations(age ≤ 30). The cumulative infected population reduced the maximum when the second control was
considered followed by considering both the controls together.
We have also studied the effect of R0 and α on the disease burden considering different control strategies.
Our findings suggests that when the epidemic is mild (R0 ∈ (1; 1.5)), the second control u12 treatment works
better than the control u11 as given in yellow and violet colored curves in figure 16. Whereas when severity of
24

the epidemic increased (R0 ∈ (1.5; 7)), the effect of the controls u11 and u11 and u12 together was found to be
better than the effect of u12 alone. From figure 17 and figure 18 we see that the treatment u12 works better in
keeping the severity very low throughout the range of the basic reproduction number (R0 ∈ (1; 7)) as shown in
yellow colored curve in the figure 17 followed by the combined effect of both the controls.
From the study on the effect of α on disease burden we saw that the cumulative count of the disease grew
significantly as the level of saturation increased for entire range of R0 considering both the controls together.
Whereas when we considered the second control alone we saw that the cumulative count of the disease grew
significantly as the level of saturation increased but as epidemic became severe (R0 > 5) the effect of α remained
the same.
