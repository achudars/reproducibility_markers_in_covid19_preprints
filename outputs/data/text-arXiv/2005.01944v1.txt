Due to modern transportation networks (airplanes, cruise ships, etc.) an epidemic in a given
country or city may be triggered by the arrival of external infected agents. Posterior government
quarantine policies are usually taken in order to control the epidemic growth. We formulate a
minimal epidemic evolution model that takes into account these components. The previous and
posterior evolutions to the quarantine policy are modeled in a separate way by considering different
complexities parameters in each stage. Application of this model to COVID-19 data in different
countries is implemented. Estimations of the infected peak time-occurrence and epidemic saturation
values as well as possible post-quarantine scenarios are analyzed over the basis of the model, reported
data, and the fraction of the population that adopts the quarantine policy.

INTRODUCTION

The COVID-19 pandemic started in the Chinese state
Hubei at the end of 2019, and since then it propagated to
almost all countries. Contrarily to an epidemic developing in a local closed region, the external propagation was
triggered by the arrival of infected travelers that return
from the other countries. In fact, at a continental level,
after Asia, the epidemic propagated to Europe (with focus on Italy and Spain) and later to America (USA and
Latino American countries) and Africa.
After the initial propagation, different administrations
adopted quarantine policies. The main goal is to slow
down the velocity of infected people increase, which in
turn should avoid the collapse of the national health systems. This issue is of central importance because the
disease mortality is decreased under appropriate medical
attention.
At the present time, for most of the countries, the epidemic did not reach its maximal value. From a mathematical modeling perspective, the main challenge is to
estimate the posterior epidemic evolution taking into
account the quarantine policies and the available data.
Magnitudes of special interest are the maximal (accumulative) number of infected agents as well as the epidemic
peak and its time of occurrence. A qualitative description
of possible post-quarantine scenarios is also of interest.
In fact, while strict quarantine policies are effective for
controlling the epidemic propagation, its sustainability
and economical cost are aspects under discussion.
The mathematical modeling of epidemic propagation
and evolution is a well established topic [1, 2]. One of the
simplest descriptions is given by the so called SusceptibleInfectives-Recovered (SIR) models. The three variables

of interest (S, I and R) count the number of persons in
each possible state. A non-linear contribution (the product of S and I) governs the transition from the healthy to
the infected group. There exists a vast and growing literature dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic description,
which is based on SIR like models and related ones (see
for example (non-exhaustive) Refs. [3–15]). In contrast
to standard SIR models, where saturation of an epidemic
occurs due to a dominant number of recovered agents,
here saturation and epidemic decay are mainly produced
(in a first stage) by the quarantine policies.
The goal of this contribution is to formulate a simple
and minimal epidemic mathematical model that takes
into account both the external injection of infected agents
as well as the quarantine government policies. In contrast
to other approaches, we consider that the initial free epidemical growth and its posterior constrained evolution
(due to quarantine) must be described in intrinsic separate ways. In fact, both stages are determined by different mechanisms whose underlying complexities may be
quite dissimilar. The proposed evolution is defined with
a minimal number of parameters whose estimation follows from data fitting and also public information. In
the pre-quarantine period the dynamic is linear while in
the post-quarantine stage the model can be related to a
linearized SIR model. The approach is applied to available data of different European countries and Argentina.
The maximal number of infected agents as well as the size
of the epidemic peak are estimated in each case. A qualitative description of post-quarantine scenarios in terms
of the fraction of isolated population is also proposed.
The manuscript is outlined as follows. In Sec. II we
present the model and its derivation. In Sec. III it is
applied in the description of COVID-19 data for different countries: Italy, Spain, France, United Kingdom, and
Argentina. In Sec. IV post-quarantine scenarios are discussed. The Conclusions are provided in Sec. V. A mapping with SIR models is presented in the Appendix.

EPIDEMIC MODEL

Due to the connectivity between diverse parts of the
world (airplanes, cruise ships, etc.), in most countries
the beginning of the epidemic was produced by travelers
returning from an infected region. In this first period,
where no local governmental policy has been taken yet,
the growth of the (total) infected population n(t) results
from external injection plus local contagions. These features depend on a complex way on flight connectivity and
local passenger displacements, which in turn may lead to
very different average behaviors. For example, the infected population may grow in an exponential (Latino
American countries) or sub-exponential way (some European countries). Given the increase of infected people,
in a second period local governments take different policies such as total or partial quarantine (avoiding local
spread), jointly with the cancellation (partial or full) of
infected external injection. In our approach, due to their
intrinsic different origins, these two stages are modeled
in a separate way.
A.

Modelling free grow stage under external
infected injection and local contagions

At the beginning, the epidemic increase is produced
by an external injection of infected agents, which in turn
may produce a local spreading of the disease. At this
stage, we propose the evolution
dn(t)
= a(t) + r(t)n(t),
dt

0 ≤ t ≤ tq .

(1)

The function a(t) > 0 measures the velocity of external
infected injection (i.e. airplanes). Furthermore, the function r(t) > 0 gives the rate of local (regional) contagions.
This evolution is taken between the initial time t = 0,
the day before the arrival of the first infected agent, up
to the time tq where a government policy is taken. Time
is measured in day. We analyze different possibilities for
the functions a(t) and r(t).
1.

Pure imported cases

One assumption is to consider that the local spreading
of the disease gives a small or null contribution. Thus,
we consider the functions
 tν 
a(t) = atν−1 exp c
,
r(t) = 0.
(2)
ν
Here, the rate constants a and c have units 1/(day)ν ,
while ν > 0 is a dimensionless positive parameter. This
functional form of a(t) is justified from the solution it
gives rise. Eq. (1) can be integrated as n(t) = n(0) +
Rt ′ ′
dt a(t ), with n(0) = 0. Therefore,

Imported cases plus local propagation

Alternatively, we may take a nonvanishing contribution due to local propagation, r(t) 6= 0. We assume
a(t) = atν−1 ,

r(t) = ctν−1 ,

(4)

where as before the rate constants a and c have units
1/(day)ν , while ν > 0 is again a dimensionless positive
parameter. With these definitions, the solution of Eq. (1)
reads [n(0) = 0]
n(t) =

0 ≤ t ≤ tq .

A compromise solution

We notice that the models (2) and (4) lead to exactly the same solutions, Eqs. (3) and (5). Hence,
their underlying different mechanisms cannot be discerned from n(t). On the other hand, the solutions
present the desired time behavior. In fact, in a short
time regime n(t) ≃ (a/ν)tν , in an intermediate regime,
n(t) ≃ (a/ν)tν [1 + (1/2)(c/ν)tν + · · · ], while in the posterior long time regime n(t) ≃ (a/c) exp(ctν /ν). The parameter ν allows us to cover very different growing behaviors. A standard exponential growth corresponds to
ν = 1.
One may argue that the equality of the previous solutions only applies to the special chosen functions a(t)
and r(t) [Eqs. (2) and (4)]. This is certainly true. Nevertheless, in real experimental data it is hard to separate
between imported and local contributions. Thus, while
it is possible to chose other functional forms of a(t) and
r(t), from the data is very hard to distinguish between
them. Thus, we model the epidemic growth as
n(t) ≃

 tν 
i
ã h
exp c̃
−1 ,
c̃
ν

0 ≤ t ≤ tq .

(6)

This function corresponds to Eq. (3) or Eq. (5). As a
solution of compromise, the value of the parameters ã, c̃,
and ν are determined from the experimental data. These
parameters take in an effective way both the external injection as well as the local propagation of the disease. In
a roughly way, the parameter ν can be read as a measure
of the flight and local spread networks complexities. The
time tq is taken from public information corresponding to
each country. Given that any change in social behavior
does not occur instantaneously, this time has an intrinsic
and unavoidable uncertainty.

B.

Modelling evolution after quarantine
government policies

Given the global network information structure, in diverse countries (or cities) the local governments dictated

3
quarantine policies in order to change the free epidemic
growth [Eq. (6)] and try to get saturation in the total
number of reported cases at the minimum number of
cases possible. In order to take into account this underlying change in the epidemic dynamics, we split the
total number of infected as
n(t) = nI (t) + nR (t).

(7)

The term nR (t) gives the number of infected agents that
recovered their health or died. Thus, nI (t) is the number of infected agents able to propagate the disease. For
times t ≤ tq , for the data we analyze in the next section,
it is possible to approximate
nI (t) ≃ n(t),

nR (t) ≃ 0,

0 ≤ t ≤ tq .

(8)

where n(t) is given by Eq. (6).
After the quarantine, we assume the evolution
dnI (t)
1
= rq (t)nI (t) − nI (t),
dt
τ̃

tq ≤ t.

(9)

Here, the time τ̃ is a parameter to determine. It can be
read as the average number of days that an infected agent
is able to propagate the disease in the quarantine period.
The rate of local contagions rq (t) > 0 is proportional to
the number of susceptible population able to be infected
in the quarantine period. We notice that the structure
of Eq. (9) [with an exponential rq (t)] can be derived
from a linearization of a non-linear SIR like model [see
Appendix]. For nR (t) we take the evolution
dnR (t)
1
= nI (t),
dt
τ̃

tq ≤ t,

(10)

which guarantees that in a long time limit all the population falls in this group. From Eqs. (9) and (10), and the
relation (7), the total number of infected people evolves
as
dn(t)
= rq (t)[n(t) − nR (t)],
dt

tq ≤ t.

(11)

Given that quarantine leads to saturation of n(t), the
function rq (t) must fulfill
lim rq (t) = 0.

t→∞

(12)

In addition, at time t = tq we demand the continuity of
the derivative of n(t), which leads to
dn(t)
dt

= rq (tq )n(tq ),

(13)

t=tq

where the left and right terms follow from Eqs. (6) and
(11) respectively.

A saturation model

The post-quarantine dynamics is completely defined
after knowing the rate rq (t). In order to fulfill condition (12) we propose the function

tµ 
,
(14)
rq (t) = λtµ−1 exp − γ̃
µ
where γ̃ has units 1/(day)µ , while µ > 0 is a dimensionless positive parameter. As before, this parameter
can be associated with different complexities of the postquarantine dynamics. Under the condition (13), taking
n(tq ) ≫ 1, we get λ = c̃tqν−µ exp[γ̃tµq /µ].
The solution of Eq. (9) can be written as
h (t − t ) i
q
nI (t) = nI (tq ) exp −
n̂(t),
tq ≤ t, (15a)
τ̃
where the auxiliary function n̂(t) reads
n c̃ h
 γ̃
io
ν
n̂(t) = exp
1 − exp − (tµ − tµq )
.
(15b)
γ̃µ
µ
For shortening the expression we defined the rates c̃ν ≡
c̃tqν−1 , and γ̃µ ≡ γ̃tµ−1
. In Eq. (15) the fitting parameq
ters are γ̃, τ̃ , and µ. The initial condition nI (tq ) = n(tq )
follows from the fitting function Eq. (6).
The functional form of nI (t) always assumes an extremum maximal value, whose time of occurrence is denoted as tM , (d/dt)nI (t)|t=tM = 0. This time can be
obtained in an analytical way in the case µ = 1. From
Eq. (15) we get
tM = tq +

1
ln(c̃ν τ̃ ),
γ̃

µ = 1,

(16)

which leads to nI (tM ) = nI (tq )[e(c̃ν τ̃ −1) /c̃ν τ̃ ]1/γ̃ τ̃ . For
µ 6= 1, a trascendental equation determines tM .
The solution of Eq. (10) can be written as
Z
1 t ′
nR (t) = nR (tq ) +
dt nI (t′ ),
tq ≤ t,
(17)
τ̃ tq
where the initial condition is nR (tq ) = 0. In general, the
integral can be performed in a numerical way [16]. Complementarily, a series solution can be obtained for µ = 1.
From Eq. (15) we get (tq ≤ t)

The total number of infected n(t) can be determined
from Eq. (7) and the solutions defined by Eqs. (15)
and (17).
Its saturation value is limt→∞ n(t) =

Consistently, the saturation value depends on both the
pre- and post-quarantine parameters.

In this section, on the basis of the proposed evolution,
we analyze the (2020) COVID-19 pandemic in different
countries. For times before and after quarantine the predicted behaviors are given by Eqs. (6) and (7) respectively. The number of infected and dead in each day are
taken from ”Our World in Data” [17], while the number
of recovered are taken from [18], which are based on official data provided by each country. Furthermore, the
(approximate) times of the quarantine onset tq are taken
from public information. As a result of standard fitting
techniques, in a first step, the data previous to the quarantine implementation allows us to obtain the parameters
c̃, ã, and ν. In a second step, the parameters γ̃, τ̃ , and
µ are chosen for fitting the data after the quarantine imposition. The starting date of the epidemic is considered
to be 12/31/19 in Wuhan-China, after which it becomes
a pandemic spreading around the entire world. The data
of disease reported in this work is until 04/11/2020.
We consider the European countries Italy, Spain,
France, United Kingdom (UK), and Argentina. In these
cases the quarantine has been applied strictly as a unified
national policy. Among these countries, Italy and Spain
reported collapse of the national health systems, which
may be related with a delay in the implementation of
the quarantine. In Table I the epidemic starting date

obtained from public information. We also include the
results of the fitting parameters {c̃, ã, ν} associated to
Eq. (6). Table II summarizes the fitting parameters {γ̃,
τ̃ , µ} associated to Eq. (7), with solutions (15) and (17).
For the European countries, in Fig. 1 it is shown
the (available) data and the performed fits for the total number of infected n(t). Even in a logarithmic scale,
the model provides a very good fitting of the reported
data. From Table I, it follows that the dynamics of virus
propagation in the first pre-quarantine stage [Eq. (6)] is
not exponential, ν 6= 1. For Italy, Spain and France, the
growth is proportional to t1/2 , while for UK is proportional to t0.78 . This last value is consistent with a very
pronounced increase of the number of infections at the
end of the data. On the other hand, in the post quarantine period we find that the best fitting of the available
data is with µ ≈ 1 [Table II], corresponding to the solutions (15) and (18). This feature is valid for all countries,
which shows that the epidemic after quarantine assumes
the same dynamics.
The previous results provide a strong support to our
modeling, which in a first stage is able to capture departures with respect to a pure exponential growth, as well
as a posterior development of a universal dynamics.
In a linear time-scale, in Fig. 2 we show the predicted
time evolution of n(t) and nI (t) jointly with the available data. It can clearly be seen that the quarantine
turns out to be an effective policy that reduces infections
considerably. In fact, with quarantine (full line) nI (t)
develops a maximal value and departs considerably from
the unconstrained (free) evolution (dotted line) Eq. (6).
For Italy, Spain and France, the peak of the epidemic
is estimated to develop in 55-60 days after the epidemic
beginning. Instead, for the UK case, the peak emerges
after 90 days. These estimations follow from Eq. (16).
On the other hand, in all cases, the saturation value of
n(t) can be very well approximated by the first term of

Eq. (19).
In Fig. 3 we show the Argentinean case, country that
also follows a severe quarantine. Contrarily to the European cases, here the epidemic growth before the quarantine is exponential (ν = 1, Table I). During the quarantine, a considerable decrease in the growing velocity is
observed. Given that this country implemented the quarantine when the number of reported cases hadn’t increase
considerably, a small level of infection is predicted at the
epidemic peak when compared with the previous countries. The maximal number of infected cases can also be
very well approximated by the first term of Eq. (19).
With the information of Tables I and II, it is possible to estimate an important parameter that characterizes the propagation dynamics of the disease, this is
the so-called reproduction number R(t) ≡ n(t + α)/n(t)
[Eq. (6)]. The time interval α is the number of days
for which R(t) acquires a certain value. In the case of
Argentina, in the pre-quarantine period, taking for ex-

ample R(t) = 2 (doubling the number of infections) it
is possible to obtain α ≈ c̃−1 ln(2) = 3.5 days, which is
in accordance with the values of 3-4 days obtained from
the infections reported at the beginning of the spread
of the disease. Making a similar analysis in the postquarantine stage, the new value of α for which R(t) = 2
is given by α ≈ γ̃ −1 ln(2) = 12.6 days. This result is
also in agreement with the values of 10-11 days obtained
from reported data. The change in the value of R(t)
(3.5 → 12.6 days), clearly reflects the beneficial effect of
the quarantine in decreasing the spread of the epidemic.
For European countries a similar analysis can be done.

IV.

QUARANTINE RELAXATION SCENARIOS

The quarantine policy is one of the most appropriate
mechanisms to control an epidemic in a social way. Nevertheless, this kind of solution cannot be maintained during large periods of time. Therefore, establishing simple
criteria that allow softening tightness of the quarantine
without implying a collapse of the health system, is a
problem whose characterization is demanded.
In a roughly way, each quarantine scenario can be defined by the fraction f ∈ (0, 1) of the total population
that is completely isolated. Thus, a quarantine softening can be related to a change in this parameter. In our
minimal model, the parameters associated to the quarantine period are the time-dependent rate rq (t) and the
time τ̃ [see Eqs. (9) and (10)]. Given that τ̃ defines the
time scale for the transition nI (t) → nR (t), we consider
that it has a weak dependence on f. Nevertheless, it has
a strong regional dependence [see Table II].
For the analyzed countries rq (t) is defined by Eq. (14)
with µ = 1. Therefore, the unique parameter that can be
related with f is the rate parameter γ̃, which defines the
time scale of the decay of rq (t). As an ansatz, we relate

6
6k

Here, tI is the average number of days it takes a person
to develop health signals of the disease. Consistently a
higher f leads to a higher γ̃, which from Eq. (19) implies
a lowering in lim t→∞ n(t). In Table II we summarize the
values of f that follow from Eq. (20) taking tI = 14
days [19]. These values give a roughly estimation of the
quarantine tightness implemented by each country.
The relation (20) allows us to analyze in a qualitative way the changes in the epidemic dynamics under a
governmental softening of the quarantine policy. Each
scenario corresponds (or can be related) to a different
value of f → fp < 1, which now measures departures (or
relaxation) from a more strict quarantine policy, fp < f.
The inverse case fp > f corresponds to an increasing of
the quarantine tightness. The problem is to estimate the
new epidemic peak (if it develops) and new epidemic saturation value as a function of fp and the time tp at which
the quarantine relaxation begins (tp > tq ).
We assume that for times t ≥ tp the evolution remains
the same [Eqs. (9) and (10)], being defined with updated
parameters. Thus, the expressions for nI (t) and nR (t)
are given by Eqs. (15) (µ = 1) and (18) respectively,
under the replacements
tq → tp ,

c̃ν → c̃ν e−γ̃(tp −tq ) .

(21)

The replacement c̃ν → c̃ν e−γ̃(tp −tq ) guarantees that the
evolution remains the same when the translation tq → tp
is introduced. In a second step, in all places the rate
parameter γ̃ is updated as follows
γ̃ → γ̃p ≡

which introduces the change in the quarantine policy. It
is simple to check that when fp = f, the epidemic dynamics remains unaltered or invariant.
By introducing the replacements (21) and (22) into
Eq. (16), after some algebra it is simple to obtain the
time tMp at which nI (t) may develop (or not) a second
peak,
tMp = tq +

In fact, considering that the condition tp < tMp must be
fulfilled, a second peak emerges if the following inequality
is satisfied

Thus, when this inequality is satisfied a second epidemic
peak is observed in the interval t > tp . When the condition (24) is not satisfied the epidemic does not develop a
second peak in the interval t > tp .

FIG. 4: Estimated temporal evolution of n(t) and nI (t) for
different scenarios with quarantine softening (see text) for the
Argentinean case. The solid curves correspond to the original
dynamics (Fig. 3) where f = 0.77. In (a) to (d) it is taken
fp = 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, and 0.3 respectively. In all cases tp =
60 days. The dotted lines correspond to the (free) behavior
without quarantine.

After quarantine softening, the saturation value of the
total number of infected follows again from the relation
limt→∞ n(t) = limt→∞ nR (t). From Eq. (18), by using
the update rules (21) and (22) we get

In order to enlighten the previous results, in Fig. (4)
we analyze different possible post-quarantine scenarios
for the Argentinean case [Fig. 3]. The characteristic
parameters before and after the quarantine are those of
Table I and II respectively. In particular, f = 0.77.
In Figs. 4(a) to (d) we take a fixed tp = 60 days while
fp = 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, and 0.3. As expected, in all cases, under the quarantine softening f → fp the maximal number
[limt→∞ n(t)] of total infected increases [Eq. (25)]. This
change starts to be significant for smaller values of fp ,
where most of the population recovers its mobility. In
addition, a diminishing in fp also leads to the appearance of extra epidemic peaks in the number of active
infected nI (t), whose time of occurrence can be inferred
from Eq. (23). Due to the condition (24), for the higher
value of fp the extra peak does not develop.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

Given the international network of public transportation, the epidemic growth in a given city or country may
be triggered by external agents that arrive from an infected region. This first stage is not universal. After
that, local governmental policies such as quarantine ones
are taken in order to mitigate the epidemic growth. We

7
presented a minimal model were all these components
are taken into account, being defined by parameters that
can be deduced from public information and fitting of the
available reported data.
The first stage, that is the importation of external
cases plus the beginning of local contagions, was modeled by a linear dynamics [Eq. (1)]. The proposed solution [Eq. (6)] is able to fit different sub, super, as well as
standard exponential behaviors. The quarantine period
was modelled by splitting the total number of infected in
active and inactive (recovered and dead) [Eq. (7)], which
dynamics can be read as a linearization of a SIR like
model [Eqs. (9) and (10)].
The model was applied to the COVID-19 pandemic,
analyzing reported data in different countries. For European countries such as Italy, Spain, France, and UK, the
model provides a very good fitting of the available data.
In addition, estimations for the corresponding epidemic
peaks were obtained. Similarly to the case of Argentina,
these countries established quarantine as a rigorous national policy. While in the pre-quarantine period a universal behavior is not observed, this is the case in the
post-quarantine stage, where independently of the country the epidemic can be fitted with the same complexity
parameter. These features support the splitting introduced in our model, as well as the estimations obtained
from it.
The present approach also allows to analyze possible
quarantine softening scenarios. The dynamics remains
the same, being defined with a modified rate that depends on a factor that is proportional to the fraction
of the total population under quarantine. The formalism furnishes roughly estimations for the changes in the
epidemic peak and saturation values. Thus, we conclude
that the present contribution may provide a valuable tool
for taking relevant decisions about epidemic control. In
particular, it allows to obtain qualitative estimations of
the degree of quarantine softening in order to avoid a
posterior collapse of a given health system.

Under the mapping rq (t) = αs0 e−κ0 t and τ̃ −1 = (β +
κ0 + κ), we recover the proposal Eq. (9), nI (t) ↔ I.

Appendix: Relation with non-linear SIR like-models

In the recent literature there are alternative generalizations of SIR models that take into account different
governmental quarantine policies [3–15]. For example,
from [3], we write
dS
= −αSI − κ0 S,
dt
dI
= αSI − βI − κ0 I − κI.
dt

(A.1a)
(A.1b)

S and I are the number of susceptible and infected persons respectively. The rate κ0 measures the removed
agents due to quarantine, while the rate κ measures the
removed infected people. The constant α and β have the
usual meaning in SIR models [1, 2].
The previous non-linear evolution can be linearized under the condition αSI ≪ κ0 S. Thus, it follows that
S ≃ s0 exp(−κ0 t).

(A.2)

Introducing Eq. (A.2) into Eq. (A.1) we get
dI
≃ [αs0 e−κ0 t − (β + κ0 + κ)]I.
