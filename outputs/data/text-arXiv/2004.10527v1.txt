Abstract
Extreme public health interventions play a critical role in mitigating the local and global prevalence
and pandemic potential of COVID-19. Here, we use population size for pathogen transmission to measure
the intensity of public health interventions, which is a key characteristic variable for nowcasting and forecasting of the epidemic. By formulating a hidden Markov dynamic system and using nonlinear filtering
theory, we have developed a stochastic epidemic dynamic model under public health interventions. The
model parameters and states are estimated in time from internationally available public data by combining an unscented filter and an interacting multiple model filter. Moreover, we consider the computability
of the population size and provide its selection criterion. We estimate the mean of the basic reproductive number of China and the rest of the globe except China (GEC) to be 2.46 (95% CI: 2.41-2.51) and
3.64 (95% CI: (3.55-3.72), respectively. We infer that the number of latent infections of GEC is about
7.47 × 105 (95% CI: 7.32 × 105 -7.62 × 105 ) as of April 2, 2020. We predict that the peak of infections in
hospitals of GEC may reach 3.00 × 106 on the present trajectory, i.e., if the population size for pathogen
transmission and epidemic parameters remains unchanged. If the control intensity is strengthened, e.g.,
50% reduction or 75% reduction of the population size for pathogen transmission, the peak would decline
to 1.84 × 106 , 1.27 × 106 , respectively.

Introduction

In December 2019, a new type of coronavirus pneumonia named COVID-19 spread very rapidly in the city
of Wuhan, China [1]. It swept the globe in late January to April, 2020. This outbreak of COVID-19 is now
present in at least 100 countries and the virus has infected over 9.64 × 105 people with more than 4.95 × 104
deaths as of April 2, 2020. This new coronavirus has been considered to be a true global health emergency.

The World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19 to be a global pandemic on March 11,
2020 local time in Geneva. Faced with the severe epidemic trend of COVID-19, many countries have declared
a state of emergency and have instituted drastic actions and interventions to stop the spread of the virus. For
example, China implemented unprecedented intervention strategies on January 23, 2020 to prevent further
outbreak of COVID-19. These policies have included large-scale quarantine, strict controls on travel and
extensive monitoring of suspected cases which have made a huge difference in controlling the spread of the
virus. Nevertheless, the outbreak is still continuing and having a devastating impact in Europe, USA and
many other countries. Many scientific research groups in the world including those in China, Europe, and
the United States are working independently or together by sharing their results and experiences, including
analyzing the mechanism of disease transmission [2–4] and identifying optimal control measures [5–7] for
countries where the outbreak is in its early stages. In addition, the prevention and control experience of the
2003 SARS epidemic [8–10], the worldwide 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic [11], and the 2012 MERS-CoV
[12] are also being used for COVID-19.
Mathematical modeling and prediction tools are extremely important tools for decision-making by policy
makers for epidemic control. The classical SIR, SEIR and GLEAM models are extensively used [13–18]
for comprehending the mechanism of disease transmission, its spread and forecasting. These approaches
have become remarkably successful in free infection and transmission patterns and predicting the temporal
evolution of ongoing epidemics. However, under strict control measures, the abundance of different, often
mutually incompatible, forecasting results, suggest that we still lack a fundamental understanding of the key
factors of infection and transmission dynamics. One of the them is the population size under consideration
for pathogen transmission. Here, we assume that there exists a closed subsystem in a city or country when
the uninfected people are in home quarantine or some cities are locked down. The population size of the
subsystem is considered as the population size for pathogen transmission, which is usually much smaller
than the total population of a city or county when deploying intervention strategies. The total population is
divided into the population for pathogen transmission and the isolated uninfected population (see Fig. 1).

Figure 1: The total population and its division.

In this paper, we use the population size Nc for pathogen transmission to measure the intensity of public
health interventions, discuss the identifiability of the population size Nc and propose an intuitive and efficient criterion to select the unknown population size. Furthermore, we concentrate on three specific aims
compatible with WHO’s objectives [7]: (i) Modeling: develop mathematical differential equation dynamic
models that account for the random variations in pathogen, society, and public health intervention variables
etc.; (ii) Nowcasting: estimate the states and parameters as a function of time through nonlinear filtering with
publicly available international data of COVID-19. Moreover, we analyze the key factor, the number of latent
infections, which determines the size of the newly confirmed infections in the next seven to fourteen days in
terms of the incubation period [4], [19]; (iii) Forecasting: predict local and global spread trends (e.g. scales,
peaks and confidence intervals) of the infections under different control intensities, i.e., different population
sizes for pathogen transmission. Our main contributions are summarized as follows:
• We have developed a stochastic epidemic dynamic model under public health interventions. By formulating a hidden Markov dynamic system, the model parameters and states are estimated in time
from publicly available international data by combining an unscented filter and an interacting multiple
model filter.
• Moreover, we consider the computability of the population size and provide its selection criterion. We
use it to measure the intensity of public health interventions, which is a key characteristic variable for
estimation and prediction of the epidemic.
• We provide comprehensive nowcasting and forecasting results for the local and global infections. We
estimate the mean of the basic reproductive number of China and GEC to be 2.46 (95% CI: 2.41-2.51)
and 3.64 (95% CI: (3.55-3.72), respectively.
This paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, stochastic SEIR models under public health interventions
are proposed. And then, the nowcasting and forecasting methods for this problem are introduced in Section
3. Data analysis of COVID-19 is given in Section 4, and the discussion of our results and conclusion are
given in Section 5.

Mathematical Epidemic Modeling

In this section, we introduce a stochastic susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model for the free
propagation stage of the epidemic, where random variables and processes are included in the epidemiological
process model to characterize the uncertainty associated with the propagation of the epidemic. Moreover, we
develop a stochastic SEIR model under public health interventions.

2.1

The Stochastic SEIR Model

Based on the classical SEIR model proposed by Aron and Schwartz [15] that is deterministic in nature. In
order to account for system uncertainties, we modify the SEIR model by introducing random noises and
random parameters in the SEIR model as follows:
dS(t)
dt
dE(t)
dt
dI(t)
dt
dR(t)
dt
dD(t)
dt
dp(t)
dt

S(t) · I(t)
+ wS (t),
N
S(t) · I(t)
= α(t) ·
− β(t) · E(t) + wE (t),
N
= −α(t) ·

(1)
(2)

= β(t) · E(t) − (γ 1 (t) + γ 2 (t)) · I(t) + wI (t),

(3)

= γ 1 (t) · I(t) + wR (t),

(4)

= γ 2 (t) · I(t) + wD (t),

(5)

= wp (t),

(6)

where S(t), E(t), I(t), R(t) and D(t) are the number of the susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered and
disease-caused death cases at time t, respectively. We denote the state vector as
x(t) = S(t), E(t), I(t), R(t), D(t), p(t)T

T

,

T
where the parameter vector p(t) = α(t), β(t), γ 1 (t), γ 2 (t) includes the mean contact rate, transfer rate
from exposed to infective, recovery rate and disease-caused mortality. Since these model parameters may
experience random changes in the spreading process due to different climate changes, population densities,
public health interventions, and medical cares in different regions, we model the uncertainty associated with
the parameters as Brownian motions, which could be explained by a random walk with a small noise due to
the fact that the parameters represent average random characteristics of a large number of members of the
T
total population [20], and wp (t) = wα (t), wβ (t), wγ 1 (t), wγ 2 (t) is a white noise process with spectral
density Qp (t). Moreover, we define the basic reproductive number R0 = α/(γ 1 + γ 2 ), which means that
the mean number of infections caused by an infected individual in a susceptible population [21]. Besides,
the birth rate, natural death rate and other uncertainties are considered as a zero mean white noise process
w(t) = (wS (t), wE (t), wI (t), wR (t), wD (t))T with spectral density Qw (t). In a short epidemic period, the
total population size remains constant, and
S(t) + E(t) + I(t) + R(t) + D(t) = N.

(7)

The stochastic model (1)-(6) is suitable for the free propagation of epidemic without control measures. It
also characterizes the uncertainties of parameters and states in the propagation process.

2.2

The Stochastic SEIR Model Under Public Health Interventions

When there are public health interventions and the infections are isolated, we extend the stochastic SEIR
model as follows:
dSc (t)
dt
dEc (t)
dt
dIc (t)
dt
dRc (t)
dt
dDc (t)
dt
dpc (t)
dt

Sc (t) · Ec (t)
+ wSc (t),
Nc
Sc (t) · Ec (t)
− βc (t) · Ec (t) + wEc (t),
= αc (t) ·
Nc
= −αc (t) ·

(8)
(9)

= βc (t) · Ec (t) − (γc1 (t) + γc2 (t)) · Ic (t) + wIc (t),

(10)

= γc1 (t) · Ic (t) + wRc (t),

(11)

= γc2 (t) · Ic (t) + wDc (t),

(12)

= wpc (t),

(13)

where Sc and Nc are the susceptible and the population size under public health interventions, respectively.
Ec (t) and Ic (t) are redefined as the number of latent infections, and confirmed infections at time t, respectively. The reason is that the confirmed infections can be observed each day and it is convenient to
estimate the model parameters and forecast the number of confirmed and latent infections by nonlinear filtering methods. Moreover, the infectious I(t) in (1) are replaced by Ec (t) in (8), which means that the
susceptible are not infected by isolated infections. The state vector and the parameters xc (t), pc (t), wpc (t)
and wc (t) = (wSc (t), wEc (t), wIc (t), wRc (t), wDc (t))T are similarly defined as that in the stochastic model
(1)-(6).
It is worth noting that under public health interventions, we assume that there exists a closed subsystem
in a city or country when the uninfected people are in home quarantine or some cities are locked down. The
population size of the subsystem is considered as the population size for pathogen transmission Nc , which is
usually much smaller than the urban or national population when deploying intervention strategies. The total
population is divided into the population for pathogen transmission and the isolated uninfected population
(see Fig. 1). In fact, the population size Nc plays a key role in nowcasting and forecasting epidemic trends
and measures of control intensity. This paper aims to analyze the data of COVID-19 epidemic when the
population size Nc is unknown. The subscript c of Nc , Sc , Ec , Ic , Rc , Dc , pc , xc , wc and wpc is omitted for
simplicity when there is no confusion.

Nowcasting and Forecasting Methods

In this section, we provide the observation model for the stochastic SEIR dynamic system (8)-(13) as well as
methods for nowcasting, forecasting and the selection criterion of the population size N .

5

3.1

Continuous-discrete Dynamic System

On the basis of the state x(t) defined in the model (8)-(13) and the prevalence data that can be obtained, we
model the observation equation as follows:
zk , (Mkc , Rkc , Dkc )T = Hx(tk ) + vk ,

(14)

where zk is, the measurement of the system state x(tk ), which includes the number of the cumulative confirmed infections Mkc , cumulative recovered cases Rkc and cumulative disease-caused death cases Dkc at time
tk . The statistical error associated with the measurements is modeled as a Gaussian white measurement noise
vk with a small covariance Rk , and H is a linear measurement matrix defined as follows:


0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0


H =  0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 .
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
As a consequence, we have the following continuous-discrete hidden Markov dynamic system:
dx(t)
= f (x(t), wx (t)),
dt
zk = Hx(tk ) + vk ,

(15)
(16)

where f (·) is a simplified expression of the drift function corresponding to the system (8)-(13), and the
T
process noise wx (t) = w(t)T , wp (t)T has a covariance Q(t) as follows:
!
Qw (t)
,
Q(t) =
Qp (t)
where the process noise wx (t), measurement noise vk , and initial state are assumed to be mutually independent.

3.2

Nowcasting and Forecasting

For the nonlinear system (15)-(16), the optimal Bayesian state estimation is usually intractable. There are
several strategies to approximate the optimal estimation, such as the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) [22],
[23], and particle filter [24]. For the system under consideration, we employ the continuous-discrete UKF
[22], [23] to estimate the random state recursively by the daily data zk . Specific steps of the continuousdiscrete UKF are shown in Appendix 7.1, where the continuous state model is implemented by the fourth
order Runge-Kutta method [25].
Remark 1. Since there are sudden changes in the states and parameters, e.g., the scheme to designate the
confirmed infections in China was revised on February 12, 2020 so that the number of cumulative confirmed

6

infections had a drastic increase of 15152 persons [26]. The transfer rate β(t) should be modeled differently
before and after February 12, 2020. Moreover, the classical interacting multiple model (IMM) filter in
maneuvering target tracking [27] can be used to enhance the stability of the algorithm and improve the
performance of the nowcasting and forecasting methods.
Furthermore, the prediction of the state and covariance are derived by the model prediction step of UKF
T
through the model (8)-(13) and smooth parameters. Let mi+j|i = Ii+j|i , Ri+j|i , Di+j|i denote the vector
consisting of the prediction of the confirmed infections, recovered cases and disease-caused death cases
c
from time ti to ti+j , where Mi+j|i
= Ii+j|i + Ri+j|i + Di+j|i represents the prediction of the cumulative
c
confirmed infections from time ti to ti+j , and σi+j|i is the standard deviation of the error of Mi+j|i
. Then,
the approximate 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are calculated as follows:


c
c
− 2σi+j|i , Mi+j|i
+ 2σi+j|i .
(17)
Mi+j|i
Based on the proposed stochastic SEIR model under public health interventions (8)-(13), the nowcasting
and forecasting methods described above, the local and global spread trends of the epidemic are analyzed
under public health interventions and different control intensities, respectively.

3.3

Selection Criterion of the Population Size N

When the epidemic spreads freely in a city, the urban population can be chosen as the population size N .
However, under public health interventions, the value of N should be selected carefully, and we use N to
measure the intensity of interventions. Note that the E, I, R, D are integer valued in practical applications,
based on the recursive method, Propositions 1-2 (see Appendix 7.3-7.4) show that N cannot be estimated
since the state estimates are the same for different N when they are large. Thus, it is unnecessary to consider
a very large N , especially under strict control measures or early on in an outbreak. On the other hand, it is
is not infinitesimal
not difficult to show that N can be estimated when it is not too large since E(E+I+R+D)
N
(see the analysis in Appendix 7.2). Moreover, we provide a selection criterion for the value of N by solving
the following optimization problem, i.e., we select the population size by minimizing the average relative
prediction error of the cumulative confirmed infections in the next J time steps:
min
N

J
1X
ej (N )
J
j=1

(18)

s.t. N ≤ Nu ,
where J is a constant, e.g., 7 days. N is the variable over which optimization is to be carried out, Nu may
be half of the regional population or other values based on prior data, which depends on the intensity of the
control measures etc., and the ej (N ) is calculated as follows:
ej (N ) =

k−j
c
c
1 X Mi+j|i (N ) − Mi+j
,
c

where Mi+j
i+j|i (N ) are the observations of the cumulative confirmed infections and the prediction of
the cumulative confirmed infections based on the population size N through time ti to ti+j for j = 1, . . . , J,
respectively.

Data Analysis of COVID-19 Epidemic

Based on the proposed stochastic SEIR model under public health interventions (8)-(13) and the nowcasting
and forecasting methods, the local and global spread trends of COVID-19 epidemic are analyzed under
different control intensities, respectively. All the data are collected from daily reports of National Health
Commission of the Peoples Republic of China (NHC) and Tencent News real-time epidemic tracking [28],
[29], including the number of cumulative confirmed infections, recovered cases and disease-caused death
cases.
The initial prior ranges of the states and parameters for the stochastic SEIR model (8)-(13) are as follows:
• E, I, R, D: the initial values of I, R, D can be set as the number of reported confirmed cases, recovery
cases and disease-caused death cases, respectively. The initial number of latent infections E can be set
as c · (I + R + D), where 5 ≤ c ≤ 20.
• α: the contact rate. 0.1 ≤ α ≤ 0.3.
• β: the transfer rate from latent to confirmed. 7 days ≤

1
β

≤ 14 days.

• γ 1 , γ 2 : the recovery rate and disease-caused death rate. 0.05 ≤ γ 1 ≤ 0.1, 0.001 ≤ γ 2 ≤ 0.01.

4.1

The Selection of the Population Size N and Estimation of the Basic Reproductive Number

Fig. 2(a) shows the prediction of the confirmed infections I(t) based on the data through January 20 to February 24 of Hubei Province, China under different intensities of public health interventions, i.e, maintaining
the control intensity and the population size N = 1 × 106 , relaxing the control intensity and the population
sizes N = 2 × 106 , and N = 3 × 106 , respectivley. The results indicates that relaxing the Hubei quarantine
would lead to a second epidemic peak. It also indicate that the selection of the population size for pathogen
transmission is a key factor for the forecasting of the epidemic and N is identifiable for this case.
Fig. 2(b) shows the prediction for Beijing City. It indicates that when N is greater than 105 , the predicted
values are the same, i.e, N is unidentifiable. This is consistent with Propositions 1-2. In fact, early on in the
epidemic, Beijing took very strict control measures so that the basic reproductive number is very small, the
small number of infections cannot spread to a larger population.

Figure 2: The forecasting of the epidemic trend of I(t) with different population sizes.
Therefore, for global prediction, it is required to select the population size carefully. Through the selection criterion (18) and setting J = 7, we select the population size based on the prevalence data of COVID-19
epidemic [28], [29] from the date of the first confirmed infection to April 2, 2020.
Table 1 gives the selected values of N and national populations [30] of several major epidemic affected
countries and GEC. Here, we restate that N is the population size for pathogen transmission. The total
national population is divided into the population for pathogen transmission and the isolated uninfected
population. It shows that the selected N under public health interventions are far less than the national
population. Comparing Iran with Italy, they have a similar total population, however, Iran has a smaller size
N for pathogen transmission, i.e, stronger control measures [31].

Moreover, to validate the selected population sizes N , Fig. 3 shows the reported confirmed infections
from the date of the first confirmed case to April 2, 2020, daily prediction of one time step and the corresponding 95% CIs for several major epidemic affected countries and GEC, respectively. It indicates that

9

the 95% CIs can cover the true confirmed infections, no matter what in the outbreak phase (see Fig. 3(a),
3(c)-3(l)), or end of the outbreak (see Fig. 3(b)).
Specifically, it’s worth noting that in Fig. 3(b) the number of cumulative confirmed infections has a
sudden increase owing to the revision of the diagnosis scheme in China on February 12, 2020 [26], the
stochastic SEIR model under public health interventions (8)-(13) and the UKF method can quickly track the
state in several time steps, and then predict the state with a small CI. Besides, Fig. 3(l) indicates the epidemic
trend of COVID-19 globally is still in the outbreak with exponential growth. Furthermore, more prediction
results of 1-7 days are updated and available on https://github.com/SCU-Bigdata/2019-nCoV-Forecast in
time since February 7, 2020.

Fig. 4(a) shows the estimation of the basic reproductive number R0 of China from January 21, 2020 to
March 18, 2020 when there were no local newly confirmed cases [28]. It shows that the basic reproductive
number increases monotonically early on in the outbreak, then monotonically decreases with a sharp infection
point. This is consistent with the policy decision in which Chinese government implemented unprecedented
public health interventions to prevent the spread of the epidemic and the incubation period is about 7-14 days

11

[4]. The reason for monotonic increase in the early stages of the epidemic may be that, in a limited local
city, the density of infections increases as a result of the infections increasing exponentially. It results in a
quick growth of the contact rate α(t). The recovery rate is very low due to the recovery cycle. The reason
for monotonic decrease is that the public health interventions (e.g. scales of quarantine, strict controls on
travel, hand hygiene, and use of face masks etc. [32]) significantly decrease the contact rate α(t) and the
recovery rate gradually increases, which results in a monotonic decrease of R0 . In Fig. 4(b), although the
basic reproductive number of GEC has passed the infection point, which is consistent with the policy decision
in which European countries and USA have implemented strict public health interventions, the current R0 is
still high and fluctuates around 3.64.

The Nowcasting of Local and Global Infections

The number of latent infections E(t) can be estimated in time again by UKF nonlinear filtering. Fig. 5
shows the reported cumulative confirmed infections, and the estimate of the actual infections, where the
difference between the two lines represents E(t). It indicates that the situation in USA is the most serious
one and it has 1.90 × 105 (95% CI: 1.87 × 105 -1.92 × 105 ) latent infections on April 2, 2020. In England,
the latent infections account for a very large fraction 58% of the total number of infections. We infer that
the outbreak will commence in the next two weeks with a lag time about 7-14 days [4]. Similar results are
anticipated for Austria, Japan and Netherlands with ratios between 51%-54%. Basically, Italy is near the
point of inflection. Moreover, the estimated number of latent infections of GEC is about 7.47 × 105 (95% CI:
7.32 × 105 -7.62 × 105 ), which is 32% of the total infections of GEC and about 0.47 times of the confirmed
infections.
Herein, we estimated the latent infections in 109 major epidemic affected countries worldwide except
China where the reported infections are over 100 cases. Fig. 6 shows the estimate of the latent infections
E(t) on April 2, 2020. It indicates that there are 61 countries, 14 countries and one country with more than
1,000, 10,000, 100,000 latent infections, respectively. USA is the most serious one as it has 1.90 × 105 (95%
CI: 1.87 × 105 -1.92 × 105 ) latent infections. Germany and Spain have 6.70 × 104 (95% CI: 6.55 × 104 6.86 × 104 ), 8.66 × 104 (95% CI: 8.59 × 104 -8.73 × 104 ) latent infections, respectively. The number of latent
infections of Austria, Belgium, Canada, England, France, Italy, Iran, Netherlands, Portugal and Switzerland
and Turkey are between 10,000 and 50,000.

The Forecasting of the Local and Global Infections

To compare the global trend for two weeks later, Fig. 7 shows the confirmed infections I(t) around the globe.
There are 46 countries, 11 countries and one country where the number of confirmed infections are greater
than 1,000, 10,000 and 100,000, respectively. The number of confirmed infections I(t) of USA, Germany,
Italy and Spain are about 203,402, 61,556, 80,572 and 73,492, respectively. Some other countries such as
Belgium, England, France, Iran, Netherlands, Switzerland and Turkey are between 10,000 and 50,000.
Fig. 8 shows that the trend of I(t) across the globe on April 17, 2020, i.e., two weeks later. Compared
with Fig. 7, there are 71 countries, 26 countries and 4 countries in the considered 109 countries where the
number of confirmed infections are greater than 1,000, 10,000 and 100,000, respectively. It indicates that the
global trend of I(t) would become worse, especially in some European countries and USA. The prediction
of I(t) in USA is the maximum, which would be more than 500,000 on April 17, 2020.

Figure 8: The prediction of the epidemic trend of I(t) around the globe on April 17, 2020 (two weeks later).

Number of countries

Fig. 9 shows that forecasting of the number, peak and arrival time of the infections in hospitals of major
countries under different control measures by changing the population size for pathogen transmission and for
fixed contact rate, e.g., 1) maintaining the selected population size N for pathogen transmission, 2) relaxing
the control intensity and the population size N has a 50% increase, 3) strengthening the control intensity
and the population size N has a 50% reduction. We find that except Korea, by decreasing of the population
size, i.e., strict control measures, the peaks would have a decrease, especially in Austria, England, France,
Germany, Iran, Japan, Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland and USA, and the time of peaks would arrive earlier.
It is worth noting that this is different from the results in [5]. The reason is that the authors in [5] assume
that the population size is fixed and strengthen the control intensity by reducing the contact rate α(t). Thus,
it is not contradictory. In Korea, there are no effects of different population sizes. The reason is that Korea is
near the end of the epidemic. There are very small number of the latent infections. The prediction of states
are same for different N when they are large enough. This is consistent with Propositions 1-2.
Furthermore, Fig. 10(a)-10(b) show the percentage of reduction of epidemic peak by decreasing the
population size and the contact rate, respectively. It indicates that Korea under different control intensities
remains unchanged because it has passed the epidemic peak. However, Austria, England, France, Germany,
Iran, Japan, Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland and USA under different control intensities change significantly
because they are still in the outbreak period. Italy change very little because it is near the epidemic peak based
on the present trajectory.

Discussion

Nowcasting and forecasting of epidemics play a vital role in predicting geographic disease spread as well as
case counts so as to better inform public health interventions when outbreaks occur [39]. In this study, we
developed a stochastic SEIR model under public health interventions, the nonlinear filtering and prediction
methods and selection criterion for the population size for pathogen transmission, which could be valuable to
national and international agencies for public health situation perception and design of intervention strategies.
Our technical contributions are made with a the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic that has engulfed the
world. We infer that USA has the most serious situation as it has 1.90 × 105 (95% CI: 1.87 × 105 -1.92 × 105 )
latent infections as of April 2, 2020. And in England, the latent infections account for a very large fraction
as high as 58% of the total number of infections, which would maintain outbreaks with a lag time about
1-2 weeks. And then, similar phenomenon will occur in Austria, Japan and Netherlands. The global latent
infections of GEC is about 7.47 × 105 (95% CI: 7.32 × 105 -7.62 × 105 ) as of April 2, 2020. Based on
the present trajectory, the latent infections may cause further outbreaks in the case of weak public health
interventions.

18

Therefore, it is essential to strengthen control intensity such as large-scale quarantine, strict controls on
travel and extensive monitoring of suspected cases to reduce the contact rate and the population size of the
susceptible. Here we regard the population size N for pathogen transmission as one of the measures of the
control intensity, which is conducive to assess the effectiveness of public health interventions. Moreover, it
is valuable to obtain the more accurate number of the latent infections, which is helpful to design control
strategies (e.g., scales of quarantine, strict controls on travel, contact isolation, hand hygiene, and use of face
masks) in the future. However, on the population size N , we selected it by minimizing the prediction error
based only on the current data, which may be prone to overfitting of the data. One possible improvement
approach is to include the prediction covariance in the selection criterion. Besides, the stochastic model
(8)-(13) ignored the impact of the imported cases, which are considered as random noises. If the airline
transportation data can be obtained, by combining the networked dynamic metapopulation model (e.g., [14,
18, 40]) and selection of the local population sizes in time, more accurate prediction methods and results for
the local and global trend may be obtained. We believe that it is extremely important to predict further spread
of COVID-19 globally and evaluate the effectiveness of different mitigation strategies and to try to mitigate
the impact of this pandemic on the entire global population.

Lemma 1 and its Proof

Lemma 1. Considering the deterministic SEIR model (i.e., neglecting the random noises and randomness of
the deterministic parameters in (1)-(5)), if the states E, I, R, D and model parameters have a perturbation
O( N1 ) which is infinitesimal of the same order of N1 , and the population size N = S + E + I + R + D
is large enough, then the forecast results in finite time interval derived by Runge-Kutta integration are with
perturbation O( N1 ) as well.

Proof. Since N = S + E + I + R + D, the deterministic SEIR model can be simplified as follows:
dE(t)

where the parameters α, β, γ 1 , γ 2 are constants, and S = N − E − I − R − D holds for all time. Denote

where x(tk ) represents the true state E(tk ), I(tk ), R(tk ), D(tk ), α, β, γ 1 , γ 2 at time tk . We use the convention fd (x(t), t) as the drift function in differential equations (41)-(44). Herein, we adopt the fourth order

be concluded that k̃i = ki + O( N1 ), i = 2, 3, 4 as well. By (45), we have

Proposition 1 and its Proof

Proposition 1. If the current state estimation and covariance at time tk have a perturbation O( N1 ) which
has a compatible dimension and the population size N = S + E + I + R + D is large enough, then the state
prediction x̂(t) and covariance P(t) in finite time derived by the model prediction step of the continuousdiscrete UKF via Runge-Kutta integration are with perturbations O( N1 ) as well.

Proof. Considering the model prediction step, the Runge-Kutta integration is implemented for the differential equations (20)-(21) to derive the state prediction and covariance. Without loss of generality, we assume
that the state and covariance at time tk are with a perturbation O( N1 ),

P̃(tk ) = P(tk ) + O( ).
N
Rewriting (52), we obtain that
X̃(tk ) = X̂(tk ) + O(

N

(53)

namely, the sigma points of x̃(tk ) are also with a perturbation O( N1 ) compared with the sigma points of
x̂(tk ).
Thus, we adopt the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method to calculate the state and covariance prediction
(20)-(21). By Lemma 1, we have that the state and covariance prediction x̃(tk+1|k ), P̃(tk+1|k ) based on
x̃(tk ), P̃(tk ) are still with a perturbation O( N1 ) comparing with the state and covariance x̂(tk+1|k ), P(tk+1|k )
predicted by x̂(tk ) and P(tk ).

Proposition 2 and its Proof

Proposition 2. If the state estimation and covariance at time tk are with perturbations O( N1 ) which has a
compatible dimension and the population size N = S + E + I + R + D is large enough, then the state
update of x̂(t) and P(t) in finite time through continuous-discrete UKF via Runge-Kutta integration are still
with perturbations O( N1 ).

Proof.
Denote the state estimation and covariance with perturbations as follows:

1
x̃(tk+1|k ) =x̂(tk+1|k ) + O( ),
N
1
P̃(tk+1|k ) =P(tk+1|k ) + O( ),
N
then the state prediction and covariance x̂(tk+1|k ), P(tk+1|k ) without perturbation are updated by measurement zk+1 through (32)-(33), i.e.,

where ẑk+1|k , Cov ẑk+1|k , Kk+1 are calculated by (34)-(40).
Besides, for the state prediction and covariance x̃(tk+1|k ), P̃(tk+1|k ) with a perturbation, similarly as
(53), the sigma points of x̃(tk+1|k ) are with perturbations, i.e.,
X̃(tk+1|k ) = X̂(tk+1|k ) + O(

Moreover, the state prediction and covariance are updated by measurement zk+1 as follows:

x̃(tk+1 ) = x̃(tk+1|k ) + K̃k+1 zk+1 − z̃k+1|k

= x̂(tk+1 ) + O( ),


P̃(tk+1 ) = P̃(tk+1|k ) − K̃k+1 Cov−1 z̃k+1|k K̃Tk+1

= P̂(tk+1 ) + O( ).

Therefore, the state estimation and covariance at time tk+1 are with perturbations O( N1 ) as well.
