(Dated: December 9, 2020)
We consider the pandemic spreading of COVID-19 in India after the outbreak of
the coronavirus in Wuhan city, China. We estimate the transmission rate of the initial
infecting individuals of COVID-19 in India by using the officially reported data at the
early stage of the epidemic with the help of Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Infected (I),
and Removed (R) population model, the so called SEIR dynamical model. Numerical
analysis and model verification are performed to calibrate the system parameters
with official public information about the number of people infected, and then to
evaluate several COVID -19 scenarios potentially applicable to India. Our findings
provide an estimation of the number of infected individuals in the pandemic period
of time-line, and also demonstrate the importance of governmental and individual
efforts to control the effects and time of the pandemic-related critical situations. We
also give special emphasis to individual reactions in the containment process.

INTRODUCTION

COVID-19, a disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-COV 2), was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei,
China, and has since spread globally [1]. The World Health Organization (WHO) an-

2
nounced COVID-19 as an international public health emergency on 30th January, 2020, and
subsequently a pandemic on 11th March, 2020 [2]. The number of patients is growing exponentially and thousands of people are losing their lives in many a countries, almost every
day due to COVID-19 [3–5]. The complexity of the situation can be realized from the fact
that as on 15th May, 2020 the number of coronavirus cases worldwide has reached a staggering 46,39,427, with infected patients being 25,64,442 and more than 3,08,810 confirmed
deaths have been reported due to this disease [6]. Moreover, the outbreak has also spread to
more than two hundred countries [6] (Note added in revision: In continuation, the number
of coronavirus cases reached as 46,403,652 with currently infected patients being 12,079,415
and 1,211,421 confirmed death cases as on 2nd November, 2020).
Much work indicates that COVID-19 could spread from animal to human (zoonotic) [7].
In addition, a rapid increase of COVID-19 infections show the main finding that secondary
transmission can occur through human-to-human contacts or through droplets transmitted
by coughing or sneezing from an infected person [4, 7] or even when an infected person
speaks to a non-infected one. With the above trend, this spread of human-to-human disease
is growing significantly almost everywhere in the world and the infection is rapidly increasing
in many countries through local transmission [4].
In India, the infection due to COVID-19 was first identified on 02nd March, 2020. The
Indian Government announced a 21-day country-wide lock-down as a preventive measure for
the COVID-19 outbreak on 24th March, 2020. The aim of the lockdown was to slow down the
spread of the novel coronavirus, to allow the Government to follow a multi-pronged strategy
to add more beds in its hospital network, to increase the development of the COVID19 test kits and of personal protective equipments (PPEs) for health workers, etc. The
government frequently uses different platforms to keep the public aware of COVID -19.
In India, conditions including very high population density in urban areas, unavailability
of vaccines and inadequate data about the disease’s transmitting process also make it a
herculean task to adequately fight the disease.
Mathematical simulations were often used to forecast the effects of various epidemics
and also to test the efficacy of the different prevention approaches in reducing the burden
of the epidemics [8]. Recently, concerning the current COVID-19 pandemic, considerable
research has been carried out using actual occurrence from the impacted countries, analyzing
various aspects of the epidemic, as well as assessing the impact of preventive approaches

3
adopted in order to limit the epidemic in the countries concerned [9]. In particular, various
kinds of dynamical models have been employed, essentially considering nonlinear governing
equations. For instance, the nature of human coronavirus infection and defining contact
between human cells and the virus have been described in Ref [10]. The statistical model
for estimating virus transmission, taking into account a condensed version of the bats-hostsreservoir-people transmission model, known as a reservoir-people model was also reported
in Ref [11].
Susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model is an important tool for tackling
coronavirus transmission statistical simulations. Lin and his co-workers have proposed a
method to develop analytical models for the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan taking into
account human behavioral responses and government decisions, such as holiday extension,
travel restriction, hospitalization, and quarantine [3]. Some recent studies based on these
works use numerical simulations and attempt to provide a reliable real-time forecast of
COVID-19 cases in various countries with the help of this mathematical model. For instance,
Savi et al have obtained the general transmission of the novel coronavirus to test various
scenarios of coronavirus propagation in different countries, taking into account the model
testing of the evolution of infected populations in China, Italy, Iran and Brazil based on
government and individual reactions [12].
In this work, we consider the situation in India starting from the initial outbreak period
and fitted SEIR model to the daily infected cases reported between 2nd March, 2020 to 15th
May, 2020. We estimate the basic transmission rate of COVID-19 in the initial stage of the
epidemic between 2nd March, 2020 and 24th March, 2020. Further, the general propagation
of the novel coronavirus is also studied in our investigation to evaluate different scenarios of
the propagation of coronavirus. In addition, the model verification takes into consideration
the evolution of the infected population and simulates different scenarios based on the rate
of transmission and the governmental and, especially individual reactions. Finally it proposes potential evolution of the spread and possible mitigations, specifically emphasizing the
significance of individual reactions at the societal level during the pandemic period which
includes both lock-down and various unlock periods.
The structure of the paper is as follows. In section II, we briefly describe the SEIR
dynamical model. The estimation of transmission rate and detailed numerical analysis of
the mathematical model with actual data is described in section III. Finally, we discuss the

II.

THE DYNAMICAL MODEL

Lin and his co-workers have proposed a susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR)
model to explain coronavirus disease (COVID-19) [3]. This model was inspired by He et al’s
original influenza model [13, 14]. The SEIR model also has two supplementary terms: D is
a public perception of risk with respect to serious cases and deaths, and C is the number
of recorded and unreported incidents. In addition, S is the susceptible population, E is the
population exposed, I is the currently infectious population (excluding the recovered and
death cases) and R is the population removed which includes both the cases of recovered and
deaths. The simplified version of the governing equations takes account of the interaction
between all these populations, and is represented by the following set of coupled nonlinear
differential equations [3],

where γ is the mean infectious period, γR is the delayed removed period, which denotes the
relation between removed population and the infected one, σ is the mean latent period, d
denotes the proportion of severe cases and λ is the mean duration of public reaction [3, 4, 12].
In Eq.(1), β(t) denotes the transmission rate function which incorporates the impact of
governmental action (1 − α), and the individual action, which is denoted by the function

D k
1− N
[3, 12]. Here, the parameter k defines the intensity of individual reaction, which

is measured on a scale of 0 to 105 with a normal value of 1117.3 obtained from previous and

recent epidemic and pandemic studies [3, 13]. We also assume that the effect of governmental
action is different during different lock-down periods. Therefore, the transmission rate β(t)
is defined as

The value of β0 is derived by assuming that the basic reproduction number is R0 =

which measures the average number of new infections generated by each infected person.
The values of the system parameters are mentioned in Table I, based on the information
deduced from the references in [3, 4, 12, 13, 17].
The above parameters must be modified for each state/country which is important for
the analysis of COVID-19. In general, the physical meanings of the parameters are based on
a variety of facts, identifying which constitute a difficult task [3]. It should be also pointed
out in this regard that the real data has spatial aspects that are not covered by the above
set of governing equations. Consequently, this kind of study is a sort of average activity that
needs careful adjustment to suit real data as followed by earlier studies [3, 12].
In our present study, we use step-like functions to define certain parameters that allow
for a proper representation of different scenarios, especially the rate of transmission. It is
also important to remember that all governmental or individual decisions have a delayed
impact on the dynamics of the system. Further, virus mutation is another important factor
related to the definition of COVID-19 dynamics which can affect the reaction of the system
significantly but is not discussed in our present study [12]. The next sections treat the
COVID-19 dynamics considering two different objectives. To start with, we identify the
initial value of transmission rate with the data from initially infected people, and then it
examines various scenarios for the COVID -19 situation in India, using different transmission
rates and government and individual action strengths.

DATA ANALYSIS WITH NUMERICAL MODEL

As a first phase of the established study, model verification is performed using information available on India covid-19 tracker and worldometers.info [6]. We follow the SEIR
implementation methodology described for various countries in [12]. The model employed
for simulations is with a total population of India at N ≈ 139 × 107 [15], and 3 infected
COVID-19 confirmed as on 02-Mar-2020. The initial state is taken to be with I0 = 3 and a
susceptible initial population is assumed to be S0 = 0.9N. Another information needed for

the model is the number of individuals exposed to each infected person. Each infected individual is believed to have the potential to infect a further 20 individuals, E0 = 20I0 [3, 12].
Initially, we started with the estimation of the initial transmission rate.

A.

Estimation of initial transmission rate

To start with, we note that, intensified precautionary measures to curb the spread of
COVID -19 was carried out in India. In particular, when patients were found at a location,
the Committee of Physicians and Experts checked those people who had contacts with the
patients. After that, both the patients and the contaminated people were quarantined in
a hospital or in other isolated areas. In India’s data published, in the initial few days, the
active cases were automatically moved to quarantined cases [19]. Therefore, the active cases
correlate after a few days with the omitted quarantined cases. From the recorded data we
can match real infected individuals (excluding quarantined people) as a function of time at
the early stage of the disease spreading bar the initial quarantined people [20].
In order to solve the model (1), we consider the susceptible population to be close to the
overall population in the early stages of transmission of the disease [20], and we can rewrite
the dynamic equation of the epidemic with

≈ 1.

where I(0) = I01 + I02 is the initial number of individual infected people. Now the curve
is fitted with the initial real infectious population data available in [6]. Further we identify
an exact fit with the curve 3e0.473t . From this we obtain the parameter values as I01 = 3,
I02 = 0 and the initial value of β is 0.56. This β value can be considered as the initial
transmission rate β0 in (2). It gives the reproduction number R0 =

β0
γ

= 2.8. One may note

that a few recent studies suggest a reproduction rate of R0 about 2.52 for the first 22 days
before lockdown, and then identify the value of R0 to vary between 1.9 to 3.0 in various
places in India, due to the variation of transmission rates [17, 18, 20], but in our analysis
the estimation of R0 from the model is confirmed with real data of daily infected individuals
(excluding recovered and death cases). In Fig. 1 we represent the curve fit of the infected
people as a function of time at the early stage of the disease spreading in India.

B.

Verification through Simulations

In this section, the first scenario for model verification based on the results of India is
presented. It should be noted that our analysis considers all infected cases in entire India,
and it is not restricted to any specific state or place. The parameters which are used in
the model are specified in Table I, and these parameters should be treated as average since
they are appropriate for the country as a whole. Initially, we started with the value of
transmission rate starting with β0 = 0.56 and the value attributable to governmental action
strength is also considered as different during the periods before and after lock-down. Fig.
2 charts the transmission rate β(t), before and after the lock-down period with respect to
various governmental action strengths. One may note that one important constraint on
the parameter β(t) is that this variable should be a step-like function with time due to the
impact of government action strength. Therefore, using the daily COVID-19 incidence data,

(excluding recovered and death cases) in India up-to 15th May, 2020. Note that this simulation
(See column IV) shows the rate of newly infected population after May 3 with respect to the values
of government action strength α in (2) with (a) α = 0.22, (b) α = 0.25, (c) α = 0.3, and (d)
α = 0.4. The strength of individual reaction considered is a rather low value of k = 1117.3 and
the remaining parameters are taken from Table I.

numerical simulation is carried out for the model (2) with the value of β0 = 0.56. Fig. 3
shows the evolution of the number of infected individuals (excluding both recovered and
death population), indicating a strong agreement between simulation and actual data. The
infected people regions are marked as I, II,III and IV and they correspond to the periods
of Mar 02 -Mar 24 (before lock-down), Mar 25-April 14 (first lock-down), April 15 - May 3
(second lock-down) and May 4 - May 17 (third lock-down), respectively.
It is apparent that our estimation of the number of infected individuals in the model

strengths upto the end of the second lock-down period starting from initial outbreak
(Mar 2 -May 3) shows good agreement with the actual data of infected individuals (See
Fig.3(a)). This study helps to predict newly infected individuals in the near future. For
instance, we choose low values of governmental action strengths, α = 0.3 and 0.4, in the
third lock-down period (due to the minimum relaxation given by the government, when certain activities were permitted and restricted in each zone) compared to α = 0.45 during the
second lock-down period, and our model study predicts the number of infected individuals
reasonably well with the real data for α = 0.4 in the region IV (See black curve in Fig.3(b)).

Note that in Figs.3, we have also included the strength of individual reaction at a rather
low value of k = 1117.3, see Eq. (2) above, but the contribution due to this term is only
minimal. A sample summary of the actual infected people in India [6], and prediction of
infected individuals from the model (1) are given in Table.II.

(For instance 4th May, 2020 - 10th June, 2020, and beyond, marked as region IV in Figs.
4(a)-(d)). Strategies for prevention include preventive mechanisms such as lock-down, information campaign by newspapers and television, adequate hand sanitation, social distancing
etc. which results in slowing down the COVID-19 transmission process. These strategies
of prevention as modeled in terms of the parameter α and k in Eq. (2), which imply that
there will be a reduction in the transmission rate β(t). Now, we start with the efficiency
of prevention by varying government action strength alone, keeping k at fixed low strength
k = 1117.3 [3]. For such low values of strengths, that is for α = 0.22 and α = 0.25, it
is observed that the number of infected individuals will peak around 8 × 105 and 7 × 105
respectively by June 10 (see Fig.4(a)-(b)). If the strength is increased (for α = 0.30), the
peak of the infected/active people cases may decrease and the occurrence of the peak is

14
shifted down to 5 × 105 on June 10 (see Fig.4(c)). Now, we consider a further increased value
of government action strength (for α = 0.4), and the newly infected cases can decrease and
reach around 2.5 × 105 by June 10 (see Fig.4(d)).
Analyzing the results of the above, the present dynamical model clearly shows that when
the value of α is reduced, new infected cases continue to quickly increase, while a larger
value of α decreases the infected cases to a considerable extent. However, the later will not
also help in reducing the infection to approach zero unless perhaps α approaches a value
close to unity. Moreover, it is not practical to keep increasing the governmental action
to a higher and higher level even in the fourth lock-down period and further due to the
necessity of opening up the economic front for survival of the nation. On the other hand,
with relaxation of governmental action over time, particularly in the fourth lock-down period
and subsequent period, the above type of prevention method alone will not end up in the
eradication of the disease.
In the above, in Figs. 4, we have shown our simulations, based on the various governmental
action strengths with fixed low value of intensity of individual reaction (k = 1117.3) in
Eq.(2). Individual reactions or behavior can include social distancing, personal hygiene,
health habits and avoiding crowded places and so on [2]. It will also include alerting fellow
citizens to wear masks, to follow personal hygiene and social distancing, political and social
organizations urging fellow citizens to follow social norms and so on. Now, we also address
the importance of individual reactions with low value of governmental action strength α =
0.3 and α = 0.4 in the region V (which corresponds to the period beyond May 18) in
Figs. 5. We observe from Figs. 5 that the number of infected people increases for no action
of individual response (for k = 0), while the number of infected people decreases when the
value of individual response increases to k=3000, 5000 and 10000. From these figures we also
learn that individual behavioral responses are also very important along with governmental
action.
In the above scenario, we further considered different low values of government action
strength α in the region IV in Figs.4(a)-(d) (i-e May 3- June 10) and various values of
intensity of individual reaction in the same region in Figs. 5(a)-(b). The corresponding
figures show that the disease continues to infect more and more people due to low value of
governmental action strength, but it can become controllable with respect to appropriate
individual reactions. In order to break the chain of infection spread and to get more con-

15
trollable handle on infected individuals one may choose immediate action of the individual
reaction response after third lock-down period, that is range IV, and consider appropriate
values of α and k in the time window V in Figs. 6. For α = 0.3 or 0.4 and k = 10000 or
k = 20000 the newly infected cases tend to decrease within a few weeks, after May 18 (see
Figs. 6(a)-(b)). If the individual reaction is increased further (k = 30000 and k = 50000) we
see that the disease can be effectively eradicated within 1 to 2 months from 18th May, 2020
(see Figs. 6(a)-(b)).
Based on our analysis in Figs. 4-6, we find that if we introduce appropriate values of
individual reaction strength k, then even for low values of governmental action, the reduction
can become substantially impressive and one can approach a regime of complete controlling
of the disease in a reasonably short period in the absence of appropriate vaccination and so
on.

IV.

CONCLUSION

On 3rd May, 2020 the total number of active infected cases registered for COVID-19 and
deceased cases in India were 29,339 and 1391, respectively and on May 15th they stood
at 52,773 and 2753, respectively and on November 04, 2020 they stood at 5,33,787 and
1,23,611, respectively [19]. This amount of rise in the active infected cases has happened
after some minimal relaxation in the government lock-down, and several hundred new cases
are reported every day from different locations across India. Our study analyzed the effect
of lock-down days on the spread of COVID-19 disease in India. Therefore, predictive mathematical/dynamical models can also provide useful insights to strengthen our understanding
of COVID-19 transmission and control.
In our study, we considered a dynamical model of Susceptible-Exposed-InfectiousRemoved (SEIR) spreading epidemic, and estimated the initial rate of COVID-19 transmission by considering the initially infected people in India. In addition, a verification
procedure is also performed with respect to different transmission rate values based on the
data available from India. Our findings also indicate that the government and in particular
individual efforts are important in reducing infected populations and also in reducing the
overall epidemic period. In addition, we would like to note that these kind of epidemic
mathematical models and their predictive simulations are also valuable resources which can

16
be helpful for public health planning and in governmental as well as individual acts. Further,
our study also shows that the COVID-19 pandemic can be suppressed by a lock-down.
Our model and current data seem to indicate that the confirmed infected individuals
continue to grow in India every day, in spite of rapid response by the government to the
pandemic through various quarantine measures, nationwide lock-down and risk-based zoning
and so on when the individual reaction rate (k) is taken as low. But we find that for appropriate increased values of individual reaction, even with low governmental action strength,
there can be dramatic reduction in the total number of infected people. Depending upon the
increased individual contribution the disease can be effectively controlled in a rather short
period. It is then imperative that society as a whole contributes its might by simple social
measures, besides appropriate governmental action. These combined efforts can contribute
towards a total control of the disease in a short period in India and perhaps elsewhere as
well.

Study of infected individuals during lock-down and unlock periods

In order to get a clear insight on the estimation of our prediction, Fig. 7 shows the rate
of infected individual people with respect to timeline of various lock-down and unlock periods. It shows that various intervention strategies (lock-down, spreading awareness program,
public reaction, proper hand sanitization, etc), including measures like governmental action
strength α and intensity of individual reaction k play an important role in controlling the
number of infected individual people in India.
Staring from the initial date of outbreak, we consider a period of 300 days as timeline
and study the impact of various interventions during this period. Speaking in terms of the
actual dates, we consider the time period between 2nd March 2020 to 27th December 2020.

FIG. 7. Numerical simulation of infected people with the value of initial transmission value β0 =
0.56. The red curve denotes actual data from refs [6, 19] for the daily infected people in India up-to
Oct 31,2020. Note that the present present simulation (I-XI column) shows the rate of infected
people in the timeline, from Mar 02,2020 to Dec 27,2020 with respect to the various values of
government action strengths α and individual reaction k as given in Table III. If the strength of
the individual reaction k is increased further (after October 31,2020), the number of the infected
individuals may decrease and come to an end in a short period of time (black curve in region XI).

Our study shows that with comparatively low values of the parameters α and k the time of
occurrence of the peak of the outbreak happens during the unlock period Unlock 4.0, and it
is represented as region IX in Fig. 7. If the strength of the intensity of individual reaction
increases further from k = 2500 in region IX to 3500 in region X and then to 6000 and
then to 10000 or even 20000 in the region XI, the number of infected individuals decreases
rather quickly and can reach a minimum at the end of December 2020 (The increased value
of individual reaction k may be attributed to increased awareness among people and more
number of individuals following basic hygiene,etc..). Our results seem to agree well with a
recent COVID-19 data on India [2, 19]. Further, our study also shows that when the value
of k is decreased further in the forthcoming period in the XI window region (Fig.7), the new
