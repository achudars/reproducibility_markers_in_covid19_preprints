Abstract—COVID-19 disease, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has
resulted in a global pandemic recently. With no approved
vaccination or treatment, governments around the world have
issued guidance to their citizens to remain at home in efforts
to control the spread of the disease. The goal of controlling
the spread of the virus is to prevent strain on hospital. In this
paper, we have focus on how non-invasive methods are being
used to detect the COVID-19 and assist healthcare workers in
caring for COVID-19 patients. Early detection of the COVID19 virus can allow for early isolation to prevent further spread.
This study outlines the advantages and disadvantages and a
breakdown of the methods applied in the current state-ofthe-art approaches. In addition, the paper highlights some
future research directions, which are required to be explored
further to come up with innovative technologies to control this
pandemic.

1. Introduction
Since late 2019, countries around the world have been
experiencing a global pandemic through the surfacing and
spread of the potentially fatal COVID-19 (COronaVIrusDisease 2019) caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory syndrome CoronaVirus 2) virus [1]. The COVID-19
causes victims to develop a fever and display respiratory
difficulties causing coughing or shortness of breath [2, 3,
4]. Data collected from victims of the virus shows that
the majority of deaths occurred in patients with underlying
health issues with elderly people being at a higher risk of
death [5]. The first confirmed case of the virus is considered
to be in Wuhan, China in December 2019 with some of
the early cases thought to be traced to seafood markets
trading live animal species such as bats and snakes [6, 7,
8, 9]. The virus has been discovered to likely be related to
bats. It is suspected that the virus may have transmitted to
humans through bats which were being sold as food items

[10, 11]. The exact cause of the virus is still unknown and
it has also been suggested that the virus could originate
from pangolins, which are natural hosts of corona viruses
[12]. Pangolins is unlikely linked to the outbreak as the
corona viruses found on the animal differ to COVID-19
[13]. Although it is possible the pangolin could have served
as a intermediate host. As a result, these markets were
shutdown in China [14]. The virus rapidly spread throughout
China and eventually spread throughout the world. The
virus was officially declared a global pandemic by the
world health organisation (WHO) on 30th January 2020
[15, 16]. Although new discoveries are being made at the
time of writing this paper, the virus has been found to
be highly contagious and this has led to the rapid spread
throughout the world [17]. The virus is spread primarily
through respiratory droplets from an infected person [18].
These droplets can be dispensed by an infected person when
coughing or sneezing. The droplets can then infect others
directly via the eyes, mouth or nose when they are within a
one meter radius of an infected person. The droplets can also
be passed to others indirectly due to their long-term presence
on surfaces [19]. Another leading factor in the rapid spread
is that those infected with COVID-19, can be contagious
during the early stages of infection while they are showing
no symptoms [20]. This leads to people believing they are
not sick while unknowingly spreading the virus. One of the
main challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic is the how the
spread of the virus can be controlled. The rapid spread of the
COVID-19 virus has highlighted how the world’s population
interacts when faced with a pandemic [21]. Governments
around the world have outlined guidelines to their citizens
to adhere to lock down rules. Currently, the best strategy
to control the spread of COVID-19 is to ensure socially
distancing people until a vaccine or an effective treatment
can be produced [22, 23]. The National Health Service
(NHS) of the United Kingdom is expecting an increased
demand for their services as more COVID-19 patients are

admitted and staff sick leave increases as staff members
contract the disease [24]. Technology is being rapidly introduced in healthcare applications to develop systems that
can ease the demand of the health service [25, 26, 27]. Any
assistance via healthcare technology will free up valuable
clinical resources to focus on other areas of care. In this
paper we look at the state of the art non-contact sensing
techniques and how these technologies can be used to assist
in the care and detection of people suffering from COVID19.

2. Non-contact sensing to detect COVID-19
symptoms
Non contact sensing is the ability to detect information
without direct contact with a subject. In terms of healthcare, non contact can be used monitor the human body
without devices physically touching the body. Non contact
techniques are considered highly valuable in dealing with a
highly infectious disease such as COVID-19 as contact may
contribute to the spread of disease. Healthcare sensing technologies aim to collect information from a person which can
be processed by Artificial Intelligence (AI) to provide decision support or directly analysed by a clinician to diagnose a
disease or monitor existing conditions. Non-contact remote
sensing technology is able to sense such healthcare markers
without introducing anything to the body (e.g. wearable
devices). Wearable devices can be uncomfortable for some
which will entice users to remove the device and results in
misplacement or damage [28]. The non-contact techniques
can assist in the detection of COVID-19 and the care of
patients suffering from COVID-19. Vital sign monitoring
can provide great assistance in the fight against COVID19 for a number of reasons. Although COVID-19 affects
the respiratory system [29, 30], it has also been shown
to take affect on the cardiovascular system [16]. Therefore
non-contact sensing that monitors these vital signs can be
used to aid in the detection and treatment of COVID-19.
Examples of Non-contact techniques described in this paper
include computed tomography (CT) scans, X-rays, Camera
Technology, Ultrasound Technology, Radar Technology and
Radio Frequency (RF) signal sensing. Table 1 details the
advantages and disadvantages of each technique. Table 2
provides a summary table of the current literature contained
within this review paper.

2.1. CT Scanning
An example of a non invasive technique to detect
COVID-19 is using Computed Tomography (CT) scans [31].
This process involves taking several X-ray images of a
persons chest to create a 3D image of the lungs. The images
can be reviewed by professionals to look for abnormalities
in the lungs. The activity in the lungs is more prominent in
the later stages of infection, however ultimately the CT scans
showed a sensitivity of 86 % - 98 % [32]. This technique is
non-contact as nothing is directly introduced into the body

of the patient. CT scans are able to achieve high precision
with high image resolution however the technology used
to perform CT scans is expensive. The equipment is not
portable and it requires skilled professional for image analysis. Another disadvantage of CT scanning is that the patient
is exposed to radiation [33]. The radiation levels in CT scans
have been found to result in an estimated cancer mortality
risk of 0.08% within a 45 year old adult [34]. Recently, AI
has been used on CT images for diagnosis of COVID-19
[35].
Fei Shan et al. [36] developed a deep learning model
which was able to detect COVID-19 and also the level of
infection. Their model adopted human-in-the-loop (HITL)
strategy. HITL is when specialists are used to label a small
amount of training data. Then an initial model is trained.
Then this initial model is then used to classify new data. The
specialist then correct any incorrect labels and the dataset
can be used to train further models. This task can be iterated
numerous times to reduce the tedious task of labeling large
amounts of data. The experiment used 249 confirmed cases
of COVID-19 for training. The experiment achieved a high
result of 91.6 % accuracy. The experiment of this paper used
3 iterations. The first iteration made classifications on the
validation data using 36 labeled images as a dataset with an
an accuracy score of 85.1 %. The labels are then corrected
and added to the second iteration. The second iteration used
114 images for training and achieved an accuracy result of
91.0 %. The labels are then corrected and passed to the
third iteration The third iteration is used on all 249 training

improved accuracy greatly reduces the human involvement
and time devoted to labeling the full data. Figure 1 displays
a flow chart of the process of HITL.
Li, Lin, et al. [37] used a COVNet - a deep learning neural network to predict COVID-19. The data used included
400 COVID-19 CT images, 1396 Pneumonia CT images
and 1173 non infected CT images. The model takes CT
images as input and extracts Pneumonia features from the
images. The features are combined and the neural network
is applied to make predictions on COVID-19, Pneumonia
or non infected. Results found that the model was able to
predict COVID-19 in patients with 90 % sensitivity. The
model proved to not only be able to detect infected and non
infected lungs but was also able to differentiate between
COVID-19 and Pneumonia [37]. Figure 2 shows the process
followed in this research.

machine learning on a dataset of 150 CT images. The dataset
contains 53 infected cases. Patches of the images are taken.
Different sized patches are used to create 4 different samples
of different sized patches. The patch sizes are 16x16, 32x32,
48x48 and 64x64. The images were labelled as infected
and non-infected in regards to COVID-19. The research
used different methods of feature extraction on the images.
These methods include Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix
(GLCM), Local Directional Patterns (LDP), Grey Level Run
Length Matrix (GLRLM), Grey Level Size Zone Matrix
(GLSZM) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). Support
Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm was then used to classify
the extracted features of each of the methods. SVM was
experimented on the features using 2-fold, 5-fold and 10fold cross validation. The highest accuracy result achieved
was 99.64 %. This result was achieved using DWT with 10
fold cross validation using 48x48 patch dimension images.

is shown in figure 3.
The above papers show that CT scanning is capable of
showing the signs of COVID-19 within a persons lungs. The
research has also shown how AI can be used to assist in the
determination of whether COVID-19 is present in the lungs.
The studies have also shown how AI can also determine the
level of infection and differentiate between Pneumonia and
COVID-19 infections. Table 3 provides a break down of the
above research papers.

X-ray images are able to provide an analysis of the
health of the lungs and is used frequently to diagnose pneumonia [39]. The same strategy is used with X-ray images of
the lungs to display the visual indicators of COVID-19 [40,
41]. Similar to CT scans, X-ray equipment is also expensive
and requires professionals to analyse the X-ray image.
The paper entitled ”Automatic detection of coronavirus
disease (covid-19) using x-ray images and deep convolutional neural networks” used X-ray images of COVID-19
infected and non infected patients to create a dataset which

was used to predict COVID-19 automatically in patients.
The X-ray images are used in a ResNet-50 Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) which successfully obtained results
of 98 % accuracy [42].
The paper of Zhang, Jianpeng, et al. [43] used Deep
learning on a dataset of X-ray images of 70 patients confirmed to have COVID-19. Additional images of patients
with Pneumonia are added from a public chest X-ray dataset.
The model is used to identify between patients with COVID19 and Pneumonia. The proposed deep learning model was
able to achieve a sensitivity of 90 % detecting COVID-19
and a specificity of 87.84 % in detecting non COVID-19
cases.
Ozturk, Tulin, et al. [44] also conducted experiments
of using deep learning to classify X-ray images of patients.
The experiments made use of a custom deep learning model
named DarkNet to perform binary and multi-class classifications. The binary classification seeks to distinguish between
COVID-19 and no findings of disease. The multi-class classification distinguishes between no findings of disease and
the presence of Pneumonia. The experiments used a publicly
available dataset of COVID-19 X-ray scans and another
publicly available dataset for non-infected and pneumonia
X-ray scans. The complete dataset included 127 COVID19 samples and 500 each of non-infected and Pneumonia.
The deep learning used the DarkNet neural network. The
data was divided between 80 % training and 20 % testing.
The deep learning was ran for 100 epochs using 5 fold
cross validation. The results produced an accuracy score
of 98 % for binary classification and an accuracy score of
87.02 % for multi class classification. It is expected that the
result will fall as the number of classifications increase as
the AI will need to recognise more features to distinguish
between classes. The complete process followed in this work
is detailed in figure 4.

2.3. Camera Technology
Camera technology can be used to provide non contact
sensing by observing the chest movements of an individual
[45]. This can provide assistance in the detection of COVID19 as one of the symptoms include an increase in breathing
rate.
The paper ”Combining Visible Light and Infrared Imaging for Efficient Detection of Respiratory Infections such as
COVID-19 on Portable Device” used RGB-thermal camera
footage for the detection of COVID-19. The footage was
used with machine learning to detect normal and abnormal
breathing from people wearing protective masks. The research collected real world data and applied deep learning
to achieve a good result of 83.7 % accuracy which is
the highest result in the literature in regards to breathing
detection using RGB-thermal cameras using deep learning.
This research can provide a scanning method which can be
used to control the spread of the virus [46].
Wang, Yunlu, et al. [47] used Microsoft Kinect cameras
to take depth images of volunteers breathing. A total of
20 volunteers were asked to sit on a chair and simulate

Figure 4. Flow chart of work for detection of COVID-19 from X-ray Image
(Reproduced from [44])

6 different breathing patterns. The breathing patterns were
Eupnea, Bradypnea, Tachypnea, Biots, Cheyne-stokes and
Central Apnea. Patients of COVID-19 display the rapid
breathing pattern of Tachypnea. During data collection, a
Spirometer was used to ensure the breathing pattern was
being simulated correctly. The images taken using the camera are used in a deep learning neural network to classify
abnormal breathing patterns associated with COVID-19. The
deep learning model used was the BI-AT-GRU algortithm.
Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is a simplified version of
Long Term Short Memory(LTSM) algorithm. The BI-ATGRU algorithm results achieved the best accuracy score
of 94.5 %. This research shows how depth images can be
used to identifiy the Tachypnea breathing pattern observed
in COVID-19 patients. The process map for this research is
shown in figure 5.
The primary disadvantage of using this method is the
cost of thermal and depth cameras and the camera operators.
Although the price of these cameras is falling gradually, it
still remains substantially high [48]. The reseach done with
cameras has shown that the devices can be used with AI in
the detection of COVID-19 without contact with the body.

2.4. Ultrasound Technology
Ultrasound technology can be applied to detect respiratory failure of the lungs. An ultrasound machine is a

Figure 5. Flow chart of work for detection of COVID-19 from Depth
Camera Image (Reproduced from [47])

device that uses high frequency sound waves to image body
movements [49]. The sound waves bounce off different
parts of the body which create echoes that are detected
by the probe and used to create a moving image. Lung
ultrasounds has seen great development in recent years
[50]. The use of Ultrasound Technology can be used in
the detection of COVID-19 in a non contact method where
the risk of healthcare professionals becoming infected from
patients can be decreased [51, 52]. Ultrasound technology
can be performed using smart phones for the signal and
processing of ultrasound images in a portable setting [53].
The disadvantage of ultrasound technology is that patients
must prepare themselves before an ultrasound can effectively create an image of the body [54]. This preparation
can include not eating for a few hours before.
The work of Born, Jannis, et al. [55] shows that ultrasound technology can be used with deep learning to
distinguish the differences in COVID-19, Pneumonia and
no infection. The research collects a dataset of lung ultrasound images which contain video recordings of lung
ultrasound scans. The dataset includes a total of 64 video
recordings with 39 of the recordings of COVID-19 patients,
14 videos of Pneumonia patients and 11 videos of noninfected patients. The paper has developed a convolutional
neural network named POCOVID-Net. The deep learning
algorithm was able to achieve an accuracy score of 89 %.
Figure 6 shows a simplified flow graph of the experiment
undertaken in this paper.

2.5. Radar Technology
Radar Technology can be used to monitor the respiratory
system within a home environment and provide a quick
response if abnormalities are found which suggest COVID19 being present. Radar systems use frequency-modulated
continuous-wave (FMCW) to observe the Doppler effect
when a person moves [56, 57, 58, 59]. This can be used
to monitor the fine movements associated with breathing.
Research done shows that radar technology can achieve 94
% accuracy for the detection of breathing rates and 80 %

Figure 6. Flow chart of work for detection of COVID-19 from Ultrasound
Technology (Reproduced from [55])

accuracy for heart rate detection [60, 61, 30]. The Israeli
military force has made use of radar systems for monitoring
the vital signs of COVID-19 patients. The goal of using this
method is to prevent medical staff from becoming infected
while caring for patients [62, 63]. Using radar technology to
monitor vital signs can provide non-interference monitoring,
however the disadvantages of radar systems is that it has
high power requirements and the technology comes at a
high cost [64].

2.6. Radio Frequency Signals

The use of radio frequency (RF) signal sensing can be
used to detect the vital signs of individuals by sensing the
minute movements of the chest made while breathing as the
heart beats ( [65, 66, 67, 68, 69]). This technique can be
used for monitoring the vital signs of patients independent
of their activities [70]. The RF signals detect the movement
by observing the Channel State Information (CSI) which
can show amplitudes of the RF signals while movement
occurs between a RF transmitter and receiver. [71, 72].
The Emerald system has been developed to monitor patients
using RF signals. The system uses RF signals to detect the
breathing rate of COVID-19 patients and then uses AI to
infer the breathing rate of the patient. This allows for doctors
treating the patients to be able to monitor the patient from a
safe distance. This method prevents the risk of infection to
staff and provides the patient comfort as they do not need to
wear monitoring devices [73]. RF signals can be vulnerable
to other movements within the room. The other movements
create noise in the CSI which can then in turn cause false
readings.

2.7. Future Directions
This section will detail some of the future directions
which may be suitable for expanding on the research presented in this paper. The research has highlighted how the
detection of COVID-19 is possible using various techniques.
This section will now discuss how this research can be taken
further to work within real life scenarios.

One of the biggest challenges with CT scanning
as a means to diagnose COVID-19 is the lack of
portability. This means that although the method is
non contact, its use still requires individuals to travel
to a location where the machine is available. As the
CT images are able to provide high resolution, the
AI can be used to for the detection of COVID-19.
Therefore future directions of this method should
look to creating highly accurate models that can
eventually lead to the automation of COVID-19
detection. This can allow for faster diagnosis. Which
can allow for more patients to be tested and increase availability of staff operating and analysing
CT scans.
X-rays similarly to CT scans are not portable. Like
CT scans professionals are required to operate these
machines and analyse the X-ray images. The research presented in this paper has shown that AI can
be used to make predictions if COVID-19 is present
in the lungs. This can be useful similarly to CT scans
where AI can be applied to make the predictions
and speed up the process. The more data collected,
the more advanced the model will become. Perhaps
initially the predictions will need to be confirmed by
humans but eventually the checks can become less
frequent. Since the research above have displayed an
ability of AI to distinguish between not just COVID19 and non infected but also pneumonia at high
accuracy, then the AI has proved to be capable of
accurate classifications.
Thermal and Depth cameras are able to detect the
irregular breathing patterns that are associated with
COVID-19 symptoms. The issue here is that even
though the camera can detect the irregular breathing
pattern it is unable to categorically define COVID19 as the cause for individuals displaying the irregular breathing patterns. In a real life situation, the
camera method may be better suited to monitoring
vulnerable people who are considered high risk from
COVID-19. Then once the monitoring system has
identified the irregular breathing patterns and alarm
can be raised with a career or family member. Then
appropriate action can be taken for greater accuracy
such as diagnosis with CT scanning or X-ray scanning.
Ultrasound technology is able to take moving images
of the lungs and detect COVID-19. This can also be
made portable by using mobile devices. AI can be
applied to recognise if COVID-19 or pneumonia is

•

present in the lungs. This research can be further
applied to develop applications on a mobile that
device can capture an ultrasound of the lungs then
compared to a AI model to predict if COVID-19 is
present. Although not all phones may not have the
necessary hardware to achieve this, the non contact
method can allow for others to be able to use the
devices for diagnosis at a safe distance.
Radar technology is able to identify the breathing patterns of individuals. Much like camera technology, the identification of breathing patterns are
able to raise cause of concern but it cannot isolate
COVID-19 as the sole cause. Radar technology can
again be used to monitor individuals but due to the
high costs its more likely to be used as a monitoring
system within a hospital and not a home environment.
Any future directions should consider the use of RF
signals as a means to detect the breathing patterns
which give indication of COVID-19 symptoms. The
RF systems can be implemented inexpensively using existing WiFi technology present within many
homes. This allows for monitoring of individuals
without the costs incurred in implementing radar or
camera technologies highlighted in this paper.

3. Conclusion
The works listed in this paper have shown that the
COVID-19 virus can be detected using contact-less techniques. Techniques such as CT scans and X-ray imaging
provide high accuracy and high image resolution but the
cost of the equipment is high and not portable. Thermal and
depth camera technology has been used to detect breathing
patterns which is associated with COVID-19 symptoms.
However these cameras are expensive and needs to be
operated by a professional. Radar technology also able
to detect the breathing patterns but carries disadvantages
of high operating expenses and capital expenditures. RF
signals provide low cost and high accuracy as compared with
other non-invasive technologies. The technologies are able
to work on AI which can allow for skilled professionals to
be available to assist in other areas of healthcare during the
pandemic. The non-contact methods also protect healthcare
workers from contracting the disease. The future direction of
non-contact detection should look at the use of RF systems
as the cost is cheap and it is easier to implement within
a home environment in comparison to other methods. This
gives the advantage of allowing the users to remain within
isolation.
