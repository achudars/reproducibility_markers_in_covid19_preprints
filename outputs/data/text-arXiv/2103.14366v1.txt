Abstract
At the end of 2020, policy responses to the SARS-CoV-2
outbreak have been shaken by the emergence of virus variants. The emergence of these more contagious, more severe,
or even vaccine-resistant strains have challenged worldwide
policy interventions. Anticipating the emergence of these
mutations to plan ahead adequate policies, and understanding how human behaviors may affect the evolution of viruses
by coevolution, are key challenges. In this article, we propose coevolution with genetic algorithms (GAs) as a credible
approach to model this relationship, highlighting its implications, potential and challenges. We present a dual GA model
in which both viruses aiming for survival and policy measures
aiming at minimising infection rates in the population, competitively evolve. Simulation runs reproduce the emergence
of more contagious variants, and identifies the evolution of
policy responses as a determinant cause of this phenomenon.
This coevolution opens new possibilities to visualise the impact of governments interventions not only on outbreak dynamics, but also on its evolution, to improve the efficacy of
policies.

Introduction
The recent awareness on the emergence of variants has
transformed the trajectory and impact of the SARS-CoV-2
outbreak. As early as June 2020, the initial COVID-19
strain identified in China was replaced as the dominant
variant by the D614G mutation, found to have increased
infectivity and transmission (WHO (2020b)). On November
5 2020, a new strain of SARS-CoV-2 was reported in Denmark (WHO (2020a)), linked with the mink industry, found
to moderately decrease the sensitivity of the disease to
neutralising antibodies. On 14 December 2020, the United
Kingdom reported a new variant VOC 202012/01, with a
remarkable number of 23 mutations, with unclear origin
(Kupferschmidt (2020)). Early analyses have found that the
variant has increased transmissibility, though no change in
disease severity was identified (WHO (2020b)). Quickly
becoming dominant in Europe, this variant was held responsible for a significant increase in mortality, ICU occupation
and infections across the country (Wallace and Ackland
(2021); Iacobucci (2021)). On 18 December 2020, the

variant 501Y.V2 was detected in South Africa, after rapidly
displacing other virus lineages in the region. 501Y.V2
was associated with a higher viral load, which may cause
increased transmissibility (WHO (2020b)), and found to
undermine the efficacy of vaccines (Mahase (2021)).
Policy interventions against COVID-19 are changing objects as well, that can be seen as evolving towards greater
efficacy through experimentation, learning and communication. As the virus mutates, so do the policy interventions, in
a competitive coevolution process. The large search spaces
involved, the focus on individual viruses, hosts ((Guo et al.
(2020))), and inner focus on a genetic representation makes
GAs adequate to model this competitive adaptation (Holland
(1992); Lohn et al. (2002); Vie (2021)). It is common in
coevolution that greater ecological pressures can increase
the fitness of the populations involved (Rosin and Belew
(1997)). We are here examining this phenomenon with
COVID-19 variants, evaluating the impact of policy interventions evolution over the evolution of the viruses.

Model
Starting from initial conditions constituted by i) a population
distribution of SARS-CoV-2 variants with identified genome
sequences and traits and ii) a distribution of the current policy measures, we can simulate the evolution of viruses and
policy actions as two coevolving GAs1 .
We assume that viruses do not have any fitness function
to maximise. Each virus is characterised by a reproduction
rate, composed of a base rate and the sum of the impacts of
its mutations. In initialisation, all viruses have no active mutations. Some mutations will increase the virus reproduction
rate, some will be innocuous and others will decrease it. At
each period of time, each individual virus genome replicates
itself by infecting new individuals according to its reproduction rate, reduced by policies’ effects. Each replication can
trigger random binary mutations that (dis)activate specific
mutations in the virus gene.

Policy interventions in the model are composed of 46 different non-pharmaceutical interventions, which effects on
the virus reproduction rate have been identified (Haug et al.
(2020)), from lockdowns to targeted closures. Policies are
initialised with no active measure, and aim at minimising
the virus reproduction rate. By fitness-proportionate selection, uniform crossover and random binary mutations, policies can activate different measures, increasing their efficacy. Policies reduce the effective reproduction rate of the
viruses, controlling the outbreak.

Frequency

Under coevolution, virus adaptation towards more infectious variants is considerably faster than when the virus
evolves against a static policy. Although unguided by an
objective, viruses evolve more efficiently facing a strong
policy opposition (coevolution) than when the policies stay
inactive (virus-only evolution). The average virus reproduction rate rises considerably more (up to 3.1) under coevolution than under virus-only evolution, in which this increase
is low, and stays close to the natural reproduction rate of
2.63 (Mahase (2020)). Despite fewer hosts, selection in the
virus population becomes more efficient under coevolution.
More contagious strains become dominant much
faster in the virus population under coevolution. Figure
1d displays the frequency of viruses in the virus population
containing the mutation gene granting the highest increase
in reproduction rate. This fraction rises to 0.35 in the coevolution case, while staying considerably lower under virusonly evolution. This phenomenon is not driven by diversity
and population size, but by a higher efficiency of evolution.
Figure 1c shows that the number of different variants in the
population rises up to 800 under virus-only evolution, but
only to 200 under coevolution. This difference is explained
by the relatively large number of cases obtained under unconstrained virus-only evolution. As this extreme variant
becomes dominant, the coevolution simulation run reproduced a variant-induced second wave of infections similar to
the impact of VOC 202012/01 in the UK (Figure 1b). Both
relaxing measures for political or economical motives, and
emergence of variants, can thus trigger multiple waves.
Seeing more infectious virus variants becoming dominant may signify that the policy measures are effective.
When policies are not evolving, more infectious variants are
slower to become dominant in the population. Several countries today see contagious variants quickly attain such dominance. While this dynamic constitutes a new challenge, it
can be seen as the sign that the current measures are putting
stress on the virus: they are efficient in pushing weaker
strains to extinction. Our future work with this model will
strive to include vaccines as a policy measure, allow viruses
to obtain a vaccine-resistant trait by mutations, and observe
how the evolution of vaccine policies shapes the emergence
of vaccine-resistant strains of SARS-CoV-2.
