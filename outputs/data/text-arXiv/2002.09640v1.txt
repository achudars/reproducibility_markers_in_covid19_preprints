Abstract—There were 27 novel coronavirus pneumonia cases
found in Wuhan, China in December 2019, named as 2019nCoV temporarily and COVID-19 formally by WHO on 11th
February, 2020. In December 2019 and January 2020, COVID19 has spread in large scale among the population, which brought
terrible disaster to the life and property of the Chinese people.
In this paper, we will first analyze the feature and pattern of
the virus transmission, and discuss the key impact factors and
uncontrollable factors of epidemic transmission based on public
data. Then the virus transmission can be modelled and used for
the inflexion and extinction period of epidemic development so as
to provide theoretical support for the Chinese government in the
decision-making of epidemic prevention and recovery of economic
production. Further, this paper demonstrates the effectiveness
of the prevention methods taken by the Chinese government
such as multi-level administrative region isolation. It is of great
importance and practical significance for the world to deal with
public health emergencies.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) in
Wuhan at the end of 2019 has been spreading rapidly, which
was designated as “public health emergencies of international
concern” by World Health Organization (WHO). In just one
month from the beginning of January 2020, COVID-19 has
spread to more than 30 Provinces and Municipalities in
various countries and regions as the center of Wuhan [1]. This
outbreak not only poses a huge threat to people’s health, but
also has a huge economic and political damage, i.e., changing
our daily life.
In order to control the epidemic, Wuhan (source of the
virus, also Capital of Hubei Province) first announced to
close the city on 24th Jan, 2020 (Eve of Chinese New Year),
then other Provinces and cities have started the first-class
response to this major public health emergencies in succession
to control population flow [2]. At the same time, medical
teams carrying a large amount of medical supplies from other
Provinces of China have arrived in Wuhan to support the local
hospitals. However, the National epidemic situation, especially
the situation in Hubei Province, is still disconcerting. The

public is quite concerned about the development trend of the
epidemic and expects the emergence of “inflection point” [3].
The outbreak of the COVID-19 has given rise to alarm for
public health emergencies. So far, many medical problems
about COVID-19 and its spread have yet to be studied, and
questions and lessons are worthy investigating. Moreover, at
the end of Spring Festival holiday, many enterprises will be
back to work and the possibility of reemergence cannot be
ignored and should be taken seriously.
Therefore, it is necessary to further study the epidemic
process and the trend of the development of COVID-19,
and provide a strong basis for effective control of disease
epidemics. Focusing on the problem of work restoration,
this paper establishes a mathematical model to evaluate the
potential risk of returning to work during the epidemic period,
and provide a theoretical basis for guiding enterprises under
safe and controllable condition.
In this paper, we first analyze the characteristics of the
epidemic transmission from the visualization of the collected
data, then establish the dynamic model of the infectious
disease. Through the evaluation of the epidemic prevention
and control measures, suggestions are provided considering the
epidemic progression prediction, as a reference for epidemic
prevention & decision-making for public behaviours.
II. OVERVIEW OF THE EPIDEMIC TRANSMISSION IN C HINA
We use the daily confirmed data [4] published by the
National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of
China (NHC-PRC) to reproduce the spread of NCP through
the heat map, shown in Fig. 1. It is easy to find that the spread
of the epidemic is mainly centered in Wuhan and spread to
the surrounding areas. Through the population mobility, the
epidemic will spread to the central cities, i.e., Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and other places, becoming the secondary
transmission centers.
The source of the NCP is wild animal, reported by the Officials, and it can be transmitted via human-to-human, droplets
or direct/indirect contact [5] [6]. There is no specific cure for
the disease till now. On the other hand, the traditional Chinese
medicine has made certain progress in clinical treatment to
alleviate the symptom, and some experts pointed out that the
plasma of cured patients has positive therapeutic effect. As a

countries near China. In particular, a total of 542 confirmed
cases were reported on the Diamond Princess cruise which
was docked at the Japanese dock.
The current confirmed cases on daily in China is demonstrated in Fig. 2, the cumulatively confirmed in China, Hubei
Province and Wuhan city is demonstrated in Fig. 3, while the
comparison of the three main areas in Hubei is demonstrated
in Fig. 4.

Fig. 1. The heat map of COVID-19 in China (till 24:00 17th Feb 2020)

consequence, COVID-19 is included in category-B infectious
disease by NHC-PRC, which is a contagious disease subject to
quarantine, but China takes prevention and control measures
corresponding to category-A infectious disease.
When the sudden outbreak of COVID-19 occurred at the
New year eve of China, the Wuhan government failed to take
effective measures in time to stop the spread of the NCP.
Since Wuhan is the most important city in central China and
transportation hub in China, it results in the rapid spread of
the disease from Wuhan to the whole country, directly causing
the epidemic control difficulty.
From 23rd Jan 2020, Wuhan city was closed and stop all
traffic with the outside, announced by the Government. A
series of actions have been taken in order to reduce the risk
of infection and cut the disease epidemic. Traffic control has
been implemented all over China, and temperature checkpoints
have been set up at highway junctions to check the vehicles.
Furthermore, local governments implement community closed
management to restrict people travelling from the beginning
of Feb 2020 in succession, especially in Hubei area and
shuts down the entertainment and shopping malls. People are
required to stay at home and not return to work and wait for
further notice.
In the mean time, medical supplies and stuff are deployed
and arranged from all over the country to support Wuhan and
Hubei Province. Besides, the first two temporary hospitals,
Leishenshan and Huoshenshan are constructed and completed
in only 7 days to admit the patients. Till the midnight on 17th
Feb 2020, there were cumulatively reported 72,436 confirmed
cases, 58,016 confirmed cases in mainland China, 6,242 suspected cases, cumulatively 1,868 death cases, 12,552 cured
cases and discharged from hospital [4]. Total 92 confirmed
cases were reported in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, and
900 confirmed cases outside China, most of which are in

Comparison of cumulative confirmed cases in China, Hubei and

Fig. 4. Comparison of cumulative confirmed cases among three cities in
Hubei: Wuhan, Xiangyang and Huanggang

The data demonstrate that most of the confirmed cases are in
Hubei Province, of which Wuhan is the most severely affected
city. According to the reports, almost all confirmed cases
outside Hubei province come from Hubei or have a history
of contact with someone from Hubei. For instance, one of the

authors who has infected NCP due to contact people from
Wuhan on 22th Jan 2020 at a gathering has just discharged
from the hospital on 16th Feb 2020.
Huanggang city and Xiangyang city are the most severe
areas in Hubei Province, expect Wuhan. It can be seen from
Fig. 4 that the number of the confirmed cases in Wuhan is
much larger than those in these two cities, which can also
prove the effectiveness of closure of Wuhan from stopping
the virus spread from 23rd Jan, 2020.
Fig. 8. The new confirmed cases in China, Hubei and non-Hubei

Fig. 5. Comparison between the death rate and the cured rate
Fig. 9. The new death cases in China, Hubei and non-Hubei

It demonstrates that the density of the infected people in
Hubei Province is still quite large, and the current medical
facilities cannot meet the demand. In contrast, the situation
of the areas outside Hubei Province is rather easier to control
due to effective community isolation and individual monitoring. Currently, different App programmes in each district or
even community on the smart phone are developed to report
personal tracks when on the move, i.e., ‘Shen i’, ‘Health code’.
Fig. 6. The tendency of the death rate in Hubei and other areas

Fig. 10. The tendency of new cases in non-Hubei area
Fig. 7. The tendency of the cured rate in China, Hubei and non-Hubei

It can be seen from Fig. 5 that the cured rate has increased
rapidly since the 3rd Feb 2020, while the death rate is rather
stable. The tendency of the death rate and cured rate in Hubei
and other areas are shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, repectively. As
the origin of COVID-19, the death of Hubei Province is much
higher than those of other Provinces, and the newly confirmed
cases and newly dead cases are both much higher than the sum
of other provinces, shown in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9.

As demonstrated in Fig. 8, there is a sudden rise for the
new confirmed cases in Hubei area at the 12th Feb 2020,
which is caused by the confirmation of the previous suspected
population since the virus symptom can not be diagnosed
at the first place [9] [10]. However, the inflected population
with confirmation are roughly stable after this point, due to
appropriate traffic and medical support from other Provinces
of China. The new cases from non-Hubei area are decreasing
gradually, shown in Fig. 10. Therefore, it can be concluded

that the current measures taken by the Chinese Government
can effectively prevent the spread of virus.
III. T HE YJ-SEIR MODEL BASED PROPAGATION OF
COVID-19
In the classical SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-InfectiveRecovered) model, the total population can be divided into
four categories, i.e., susceptible population (S-type), referring
to those who have no disease but lack of immune ability
and are easy to be infected after contact with the infected
ones; exposed (E-type), referring to the people who have been
exposed to the infection but no obvious symptom in incubation
period; infective (I-type), referring to the infected people who
can transmit virus to the members of S-type and turning them
to the E-type or I-type members; recovered (R-type), referring
the people who are isolated or have immunity from the disease
and they can be changed to S-type again if the immune period
is limited [7].
Assuming these four types of people can be transferred
among these categories based on certain probability, the state
transition diagram and the prediction result are illustrated in
Fig. 11 and Fig. 12 as follows.

Fig. 11. The SEIR state transferring model

Fig. 13. The SEIR model based prediction after isolation measures taken in
Wuhan

are 150,000 people travelling in the city each day and the
estimation result is depicted in Fig. 13.
As shown in Fig. 13, the maximum number of the infected
people reaches about 60,200 when the Chinese government
take isolation measures against Wuhan. So the taken measures
can effectively reduce the number of the infection. Besides, it
takes 50 days to reach the inflection point (see Fig. 13), which
is contradictory to the current virus development situation. In
order to predict the COVID-19 progression more accurately,
this paper proposes a YJ-SEIR model, which has been improved based on the typical SEIR model from three aspects:
1) The backlog impact of the indirect infection and suspected cases on the development of the epidemic situation;
2) The measures of medical staff from all over the country
to support Wuhan and the construction of temporary
rescue hospitals to improve the treatment capacity have
positive impact on the suspected cases;
3) The measures of traffic block and residential isolation.
In the YJ-SEIR, 6 categories are divided for the population
and two new categories are added, shown in Table I.

It can be seen from Fig. 12, the peak of the infected people
will appear around the 73rd day with more than 56 million
population without any isolation measures, which will be a
huge disaster for human beings. In the case that the Chinese
government adopts closing Wuhan and people are isolated
at home such measures, however, only a small number of
people who have to travel in the city, which can greatly reduce
the base number of vulnerable people. We predict that there

illustrated in Fig. 14. Under this YJ-SEIR model, the virus
prediction result of the Wuhan area is shown in Fig. 15
without new rescue hospitals and any support from outside
consideration, while the treatment capacity is 1000 cases and
the recovery rate of the patients is set as 0.243.
It can be seen from Fig. 15 that the number of infected
people in Wuhan reaches the highest value of 79,510 in 31
days of closure, which is basically consistent with the current

epidemic situation as reported. Chinese government has taken
efficient measures to organize medical staff from all over the
country to support Wuhan and construct temporary hospitals,
which can increase hospital readiness and recovery rate.
Three groups of experiments are performed with the above
measures taken by the Chinese government, and the experimental settings of the hospital admission capacity and recovery
rate are set for each group as: (1000, 0.243), (5000, 0.243)
and (15000, 0.3), respectively. The cumulative number of the
suspected cases under these three situations is demonstrated in
Fig. 16. It can be seen that the backlog of the suspected patients can be admitted timely and cured largely with enhanced
hospital admission capacity.
IV. P OTENTIAL RISK ASSESSMENT OF REWORK DURING
EPIDEMIC PERIOD BASED ON ENTROPY- FUZZY FACTOR
The assessment of the potential risk of rework during
COVID-19 epidemic period is a multi-level comprehensive
evaluation problem, which involves various factors, especially
influenced by certain subjective factors [8][11][12][13]. Therefore, it is necessary to distinguish the priority and determine
the main factors. Based on the three basic components (i.e.,
source of infection, transmission route and susceptible population) of the epidemic of infectious diseases, the evaluation

for the potential outbreak risk (EPOR) of the factory rework
during epidemic mainly include such factors, listed in Table
II.
As shown in Table II, each factor is composed of several subfactors, which are either qualitative or quantitative.

However, the risk of work restoration during epidemic can
only be evaluated by the perfection degree. So the fuzzy
comprehensive evaluation method is used here, i.e., entropy
weight combined with fuzzy comprehensive analysis method
[14]. The process of the EPOR model establishment are
described as follows.
Step 1) Determine the impact factor set of the EPOR
for rework during epidemic.
The 1st -level indexes of EPOR for rework during epidemic
are composed of 6 primary factors (see the first row in
Table II), and the 2nd -level indexes are composed of 25
risk factors (see the second row in Table II), written as
y = {y1 , y2 , · · · , y25 }, as shown in Table II.
Step 2) Determine the assessment set of EPOR for
rework during epidemic.
The assessment set is first determined by the experts,
where the assessment of each factor can be divided into
m levels, written as V = {V1 , V2 , · · · , Vm }, denoting as
{highest risk, higher risk, medium risk, low risk, lower
risk}. Here, m = 5 is selected.
Step 3) Risk assessment based on entropy weight-fuzzy
[15].
Let the fuzzy evaluation matrix for the EPOR for rework
during epidemic be R = {rij }n × m, i = 1, 2, · · · , n; j =
1, 2, · · · , m, where rij is the membership degree of the j th level of the ith factor. The ratio of the j th level with the ith
index based on the entropy weight can be calculated as:
Pij = (1 + rij )/

m
X
(1 + rij )

(1)

j=1

Then the entropy of the ith index is calculated as:
ei = −

m
X

Pij • ln Pij /ln m

(2)

j=1

So the entropy weight of the ith index can be calculated as:
ai = (1 − ei )/

n
X

(1 − ei )

(3)

i=1

and the vector of the entropy weight of the EPOR of rework
during epidemic can be written as A = (a1 , a2 , · · · , an ).
Therefore, the corresponding comprehensive evaluation vector B is calculated as B = A × R, denoted as B =
(b1 , b2 , · · · , bi , · · · , bm ). There are many evaluation methods

for the determination of bi considering the relationship among
factors, such as principal subordinate relationship or balance
all factors with weighted average model [14].
Case study
According to the index listed in Table II, a potential risk
investigation for a factory to restore work randomly selected
is conducted on the six primary indexes (Ui , i = 1, · · · , 6),
and the statistical results are shown in Table III.

R EFERENCES

Here, the risk assessment vector is set as V =
{0.95, 0.75, 0.5, 0.35, 0.1}, so the comprehensive evaluation
score of the potential risk assessment of a factory to restore
0
work is calculated as, D = B × V , thus the potential risk of
resuming work at this factory is calculated to be 0.4423. In
other words, the probability of the potential risk of this factory
returning to work is about 44.23%. Therefore, the head of
the Enterprises can take necessary measures to restore normal
production step by step.
V. C ONCLUSION
Based on the released public data of COVID-19 and the
improved infectious disease dynamic model, the following
comments are concluded:
1) The Chinese government adopts five-level regional isolation measures in Wuhan, concentrates on the temporary
isolation and rescue hospital construction, and organizes
the medical staff of all Provinces from China to support
Wuhan in improving their treatment capacity, so as to
rapidly digest the backlog of suspected cases and reduce
the number of viral infection. It is of great significance
that the implementation of these measures makes the
virus infection rate in Wuhan well controlled.
2) Considering the impact of indirect infection and suspected cases backlog on the epidemic situation, the
prediction results can be more consistent with the progression of the epidemic.
3) The human factors are not considered in the paper.
Quite a few infected cases are caused by certain people
wandering but ignoring close regulations during the
epidemic or deliberately concealing contact history of
Hubei.
The epidemic is different from the general illness, which not
only affects the people’s health, but also affects the politics,
economy, culture and education in China, as well as people’s
mental health and quality of life. In order to reduce the
negative impact of the epidemic on whole development of
China, it is urgent to effectively deal with the problem of
the enterprise resumption and how to balance the epidemic
prevention and economic development.
In this paper, the entropy and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation methods are combined to establish a potential risk
assessment model for large-scale work resumption, so that
such qualitative and fuzzy relationships related to the epidemic
can be solved mathematically. As a result, the risk of work
resumption under different protection conditions are evaluated
by the model accurately and scientifically, which can provide
