Running title: Coronavirus receptors and associated factors in human embryos

Abstract
To predict if developing human embryos are permissive to coronaviruses, we analyzed publicly
available single cell RNA-seq datasets of zygotes, 4-cell, 8-cell, morula, inner cell mass, epiblast,
primitive endoderm and trophectoderm for the coronavirus receptors (ACE2, BSG, DPP4 and
ANPEP), the Spike protein cleavage enzymes (TMPRSS2, CTSL). We also analyzed the presence of
host genes involved in viral replication, the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport
(ESCRT) and SARS-Cov-2 interactions. The results reveal that ACE2, BSG, DPP4 and ANPEP are
expressed in the cells of the zygote, to blastocyst including the trophectodermal lineage. ACE2,
TMPRSS, BSG and CTSL are co-transcribed in a proportion of epiblast cells and most cells of the
trophectoderm. The embryonic and trophectodermal cells also express genes for proteins ESCRT,
viral replication and those that interact with SARS-CoV-2. We identified 1985 genes in epiblast and
1452 genes in the trophectoderm that are enriched in the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expressing cells;
216 genes of these are common in both the cell types. These genes are associated with lipid
metabolism, lysosome, peroxisome and oxidative phosphorylation pathways. Together our results
suggest that developing human embryos could be permissive to coronavirus entry by both canonical
and non-canonical mechanisms and they also express the genes for proteins involved in viral
endocytosis and replication. This knowledge will be useful for evidence-based patient management
for IVF during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Introduction
Infection with the novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARSCoV-2) causes Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in humans, (Singhal, 2020) and the virus has
spread worldwide and infected millions of individuals including pregnant women. Perinatal
infections including with coronaviruses can cause maternal and fetal illness and account for 2-3% of
all congenital abnormalities (Silasi et al., 2015; Racicot and Mor, 2017; Di Mascio et al., 2020).
Like most viruses, the coronaviruses enter host cells by receptor binding followed by endocytosis,
genome replication, exocytosis, and budding. Human Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme II (ACE2) is
the host receptor specific to SARS-CoV-2 (Letko et al., 2020) and the S protein of the virus binds to
ACE2 with high affinity (Jagtap et al., 2020; Shang et al., 2020a, 2020b). SARS-CoV-2 does not use
other coronavirus receptors viz; alanine aminopeptidase N (ANPEP) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4
(DPP4), which are used by CoV-229E and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus
(MERS-CoV), respectively, for entry into host cells (Li, 2015; Letko et al., 2020). In addition to
ACE2, SARS-CoV-2 utilizes Basigin (BSG), also known as CD147, as an alternate receptor for viral
entry (Wang et al., 2020). The binding of the virus to the host receptors occurs via the SARS-CoV-2
spike (S) protein that is processed by a range of host proteases (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Shang et al.,
2020a) like transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), TMPRSS4, FURIN, and cathepsin L
(CTSL). The host receptors and S protein processing enzymes are collectively referred to as SARS
coronavirus-associated receptors and factors (SCARFs), and their co-expression in the tissues is the
determinant of susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Singh et al., 2020b). SCARFs are expressed
in a variety of human tissues such as the airway and alveolar epithelium, oral and nasal mucosa,
nasopharynx, stomach, small intestine, colon, skin, lymph nodes, thymus, bone marrow, spleen,
liver, kidney, and placenta (Lukassen et al., 2020; Qi et al., 2020; Seow et al., 2020; Singh et al.,
2020b; Xu et al., 2020).
Epidemiologic and clinical evidence suggests that pregnant women are at higher risk of severe illness
and mortality from viral infections, which can lead to several adverse outcomes such as spontaneous
abortion, intrauterine fetal deaths, still-births, and mother-to-child transmission resulting in
congenital viral syndromes (Silasi et al., 2015; Racicot and Mor, 2017; Adams Waldorf et al., 2018).
In pregnant women, COVID-19 is associated with severe pregnancy complications such as preterm
labor and premature rupture of membranes (Gajbhiye et al., 2020; Knight et al., 2020). A small but
significant proportion of women with COVID-19 experience still-births or intrauterine fetal death,
and there is evidence of vertical transmission of the virus through the placenta (Bahadur et al., 2020;

3

Gajbhiye et al., 2020; Hosier et al., 2020; Knight et al., 2020; Verma et al., 2020; Vivanti et al.,
2020). Indeed, SCARFs are expressed in the trophoblast cells (Ashray et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020a;
Singh et al., 2020b) suggesting that the placenta may be permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Beyond the adult tissues, viruses can also infect gametes and developing embryos (Racicot and Mor,
2017). It has been recently shown that Zika virus can infect and propagate in the trophectodermal
cells of preimplantation human, rhesus monkey, and mouse embryos, causing death of neural
progenitors leading to microcephaly and miscarriage (Tan et al., 2019; Block et al., 2020). Thus,
studies on preimplantation mammalian embryos are important because viral infections during early
pregnancy can induce embryonic death or abnormal embryonic development (Hardy, 1974; Silasi et
al., 2015; Tan et al., 2019; Block et al., 2020). With the high population spread and the observation
that a large proportion of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection may be asymptomatic, (Bharti et
al., 2020; Hao et al., 2020; Kaur et al., 2020; Kissler et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020b) it is likely that
many women may have conceived during the course of subclinical infection. Secondly, many
assisted reproduction clinics may have handled human gametes and embryos from sub-clinically
infected couples or inadvertently exposed them to infected laboratory personnel. Given the fact that
SARS-CoV-2 has a high surface stability on various materials (Ong et al., 2020; van Doremalen et
al., 2020), there can be many potential routes by which gametes/embryos could be exposed to SARSCoV-2. However, whether the human gametes or early embryos are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 or
other coronaviruses remains unknown.
As a preamble towards our understanding of the potential effects of SARS-CoV-2 in early
pregnancy, we analysed publicly available single-cell RNA-Seq datasets of human embryos to
determine the expression of SCARFs in the zygote to late-blastocyst-stage human embryos. In
addition, we determined whether endocytotic and viral replication machinery are also expressed by
the cells of early embryos.

Materials and Methods
To understand the expression of SCARFs in various cells of the embryo (zygote to late blastocysts),
single-cell RNA-Seq datasets (Petropoulos et al., 2016; Stirparo et al., 2018) were analysed. The
dataset by Stirparo et al. was chosen as it contained uniformly analysed samples from the three
published studies (Yan et al., 2013; Blakeley et al., 2015; Petropoulos et al., 2016) and recapitulated
the known lineage markers of zygote to late blastocyst embryos. It allows an in-depth exploration of
the transcriptome of multiple cells in the inner cell mass (ICM), epiblast, and primitive endoderm.
4

The dataset from Petropoulos et al., 2016 (accession number: E-MTAB-3929 allowed in-depth
exploration of the largest numbers of trophectodermal cells from day 5 to day 7 blastocysts of in
vitro fertilization. Table 2 and Table 3 give the number of embryos and the total number of cells
tested at each time point of embryonic development.
The percentage of ACE2, BSG, TMPRSS2, CTSL, DPP4, and ANPEP expressing cells were obtained
for each cell at each stage; the percentage of cells co-expressing ACE2 and BSG, ACE2 and
TMPRSS2, ACE2 and CTSL, and BSG and CTSL were also estimated for each cell type. The list of
genes representing protein products involved in the Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for
Transport (ESCRT I, II, and III) and SARS virus replication in host cells were obtained (de Wilde et
al., 2018; Ahmed et al., 2019), and their mRNA levels in cells of the zygote to blastocyst (including
trophectoderm) were extracted. In addition, the data containing mRNA levels of 332 proteins that
physically interact with SARS-CoV-2 (Gordon et al., 2020) were extracted.
We aimed to identify the gene signatures associated with ACE2+TMPRSS2+ cells in the developing
embryos. Pseudo-bulk analysis of single-cell data of the epiblast and trophectodermal lineage on day
7 was carried out for ACE2- and TMPRSS2-positive (ACE2+TMPRSS2+) and ACE2- and
TMPRSS2-negative (ACE2–TMPRSS2–) cells. The epiblast cells and day 7 trophectoderm cells were
chosen as they had a reasonable proportion of both ACE2+TMPRSS2+ co-expressing cells versus
those that did not express either. This allowed us to have enough numbers of cells in both groups to
reasonably apply statistical testing. For pseudo-bulk analysis, the mean values of all the genes
expressed in the ACE2+TMPRSS2+ and ACE2–TMPRSS2– cells were computed. Genes that had a
ratio of >1.5 or <0.5 were filtered. Welch’s t-test was applied and genes that had significantly
different mean values (p<0.05) were filtered.
The Gene Ontologies (GO) associated with the differentially expressed genes in ACE2- and
TMPRSS2-positive cells were obtained using gProfiler (https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/gost). Categories
with Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery Rate [FDR] <0.05 were considered as enriched. The
terms were selected based on negative_log10_of_adjusted_p_value. Pseudo-bulk and deconvoluted
single-cell data were visualized using Morpheus (https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus) and R
Studio version 3.6.2 with the Seurat and ggplot2 packages (RStudio Team (2020). RStudio:
Integrated Development for R. RStudio, PBC, Boston, MA http://www.rstudio.com/).

Table1. summarizes the receptors used by the various coronaviruses known to infect humans. As
evident from Fig.1 ACE2 mRNA was detected in the zygotes, which decreased until the morula stage
and subsequently increased in the ICM, epiblast, and the primitive endoderm. Almost all cells of the
trophectoderm of day 5 and day 6 embryos expressed ACE2, and the numbers of cells and transcript
abundance of ACE2 declined in trophectoderm of day 7 blastocysts.

BSG mRNA was consistently detected in all stages of embryonic development with an increase in
expression from the zygote to blastocyst stage (Fig. 1). Almost all the trophectodermal cells of the
day 5-7 blastocysts expressed BSG mRNA (Fig. 1).
TMPRSS2 was not detected in the zygotes, and very few TMPRSS2-positive cells were detected until
the blastocyst stage. The highest mRNA levels of TMPRSS2 were observed in epiblast cells, but their
numbers were lower in the primitive endoderm (Fig. 1). Abundant TMPRSS2 was detected in most of
the trophectodermal cells of day 5-7 blastocysts (Fig. 1).
A low abundance of CTSL mRNA was observed in the zygotes and 4- and 8-cell embryos, but its
levels increased in all the cells of the morula, ICM, epiblast, and primitive endoderm (Fig. 1). CTSL
mRNA was expressed in most trophectodermal cells of the day 5-7 embryos (Fig. 1).

and BSG are the receptors for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, DPP4 is the receptor for MERS-CoV,

TMPRSS2 or CTSL. scRNAseq data for embryonic cells (in A) was extracted from (Stirparo et al.,
7

2018) while that of trophectodermal cells on different days of embryonic development (in B) was
extracted from (Petropoulos et al., 2016).

DPP4 and ANPEP mRNA was not detected in the zygote and 4- and 8-cell embryos; however,
abundant DPP4 and ANPEP transcripts were detected in the cells of the morula, ICM, epiblast, and
primitive endoderm (Fig.1). Both DPP4 and ANPEP were also abundantly expressed in
trophectodermal cells of day 5-7 blastocysts (Fig. 1).

Co-expression of transcripts of SARS-CoV-2 receptors and processing enzymes in early stages
of human embryonic development
We next determined the numbers of cells at different stages of embryonic development that coexpress transcripts of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Cells of the zygote, 4- and 8-cell, and morula stage
embryos did not co-express ACE2 and TMPRSS2. A small proportion of cells in the ICM and
primitive endoderm co-expressed ACE2 and TMPRSS2, and the largest proportion (34%) of ACE2
and TMPRSS2 co-expressing cells were detected in the epiblast (Fig. 2). In the trophectodermal
lineage, the day 5 blastocysts had 77% (110/142) and day 6 blastocysts had 83% (275/331) of cells
co-expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2. The numbers of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 double-positive
trophectodermal cells declined to 33% (129/388) in day 7 blastocysts (Fig. 3).
We also determined the co-expression of ACE2 and CTSL, ACE2 and BSG, and BSG and CTSL in
single cells of developing human embryos. The results reveal that all the zygotes and all cells of the
4- cell stage co-expressed ACE2 and BSG (Fig. 2). In the ICM, around 86% (37/43) of cells coexpressed ACE2 and BSG; 39% (25/64) of the cells of the epiblast and 39% (11/28) of the cells of
the primitive endoderm co-expressed ACE2 and BSG (Table 2). Most trophectodermal cells of day 5
and day 6 blastocysts co-expressed ACE2 and BSG (Fig. 3); on day 7, the number of trophectodermal
cells co-expressing ACE2 and BSG declined to 38% (149/388)(Table 3).

ACE2 and CTSL were co-expressed in the zygotes and all the cells of 4-cell stage embryos, 31% of
cells in the 8-cell stage, and 10% of the cells in the morula. Around 86% (37/43) of ICM, 39%
(25/64) of epiblast, and 39% (11/28) of primitive endoderm cells co-expressed ACE2 and CTSL (Fig.
2). In the trophectoderm, 99% (140/142), 88% (290/331), and 38% (149/388) of trophoblasts from
day 5, 6, and 7 blastocysts co-expressed ACE2 and CTSL (Fig. 3).
BSG and CTSL co-expressing cells were observed at all stages of development. All the cells of the
ICM (43/43), epiblast (64/64), and primitive endoderm (28/28) co-expressed BSG and CTSL (Fig. 2).
In the trophectodermal lineage, 100% (142/142) of day 5, 330/331 day 6, and 100% (388/388) of day

mRNA levels of genes involved in viral endocytosis and replication in human embryos at
different stages of development.
We next hypothesized that if the virus can bind to the embryonic cells, the embryos may express the
cellular machinery necessary for viral endocytosis and viral replication. Towards this, we analysed
mRNA levels of the 33 genes involved in the human ESCRT of viruses. The pseudo-bulk analysis
revealed that from the zygote to the morula stage, the mRNA for most of the ESCRT genes is
undetected or present in low abundance. However, the transcripts for almost 90% of these genes
dramatically increased in the ICM, epiblast, and primitive endoderm. Additionally, almost all the
genes were expressed in high abundance in the trophectodermal lineage of day 5-7 embryos (Fig.4).
Coronaviruses enter the cells and utilizes the host cell machinery for replication. We determined the
mRNA levels for host genes involved in SARS-CoV replication by pseudo-bulk analysis and
observed that the mRNA of genes representing protein products involved in viral replication was not
expressed or was present in low abundance from the zygote to morula stages of embryonic
development. However, the mRNA levels of most of these genes surged in the ICM, epiblast, and the
primitive endoderm, and maximal expression of almost all these genes was observed in the
trophectodermal cells of day 5-7 embryos (Fig. 4).
SARS-CoV-2 interacts with 332 proteins in human cells. Transcripts for only a few of these genes
were abundant; most were weakly expressed in the zygote, 4- and 8-cell, morula, and ICM stages as
evident by pseudo-bulk analysis. However, many cells of the epiblast and primitive endodermal
lineage expressed the mRNA for these genes. Almost all the cells of the trophectodermal lineage of
day 5-7 blastocysts expressed mRNA encoding for the proteins that interact with SARS-CoV-2
(Fig4).

13

Analysis of individual cells of the epiblast and day 7 blastocyst, which had proportions of ACE2 and
TMPRSS2 co-expressing cells (most permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection), revealed that almost all
the genes representing protein products involved in ESCRT, viral replication, and SARS-CoV-2
interaction were expressed with minimal cell-to-cell heterogeneity (Supplementary Fig 1). Similar
results were observed for day 5 and day 6 blastocysts (not shown).

Differentially expressed genes and the biological processes enriched in ACE2 and TMPRSS2
co-expressing cells of the epiblast and trophectodermal cells of day 7 blastocysts.
In the epiblast, 34% of cells co-expressed ACE2 and TMPRSS2 while the others did not express
either ACE2 or TMPRSS2 (Table 2). By pseudo-bulk analysis, we identified 1985 genes that were
differentially expressed (fold change >1.5 or <0.5) with statistical significance (p-value <0.05)
14

between ACE2- and TMPRSS2-positive cells and ACE2- and TMPRSS2-negative cells of the
epiblast. Fig. 5 depicts the deconvolution of these 1985 differentially expressed genes in single cells
of the epiblast. As compared to ACE2- and TMPRSS2-negative cells, nearly 67% (1323/1985) of
genes were present at a higher abundance in the ACE2- and TMPRSS2-positive cells of the epiblast.
While there was cell-to-cell heterogeneity in expression of the differentially abundant genes in the
ACE2–TMPRSS2– cells, many of these genes were uniformly expressed in most ACE2+ TMPRSS2+
cells (Fig 5).
In the trophectodermal lineage of day 7 blastocysts, 71 cells were negative for both ACE2 and
TMPRSS2 transcripts whereas 97 cells expressed both the transcripts above the cut-off. Pseudo-bulk
analysis identified 1452 differentially abundant genes between ACE2+TMPRSS2+ and ACE2–
TMPRSS2– cells. Of these, 1212 genes were present in higher abundance and 240 genes were present
at lower abundance in the ACE2+TMPRSS2+ cells (Supplementary Table 4). The expression of the
majority of these genes was homogeneous in the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expressing cells, and
expression was highly heterogeneous in the non-expressing cells (Fig. 5).

Significantly different (p<0.05) mean values are marked as *. Data were extracted from single-cell
RNA-Seq of the epiblast of developing human embryos (Stirparo et al., 2018), trophectoderm data
was extracted from (Petropoulos et al., 2016).
In both epiblast and trophectodermal cells, the ACE2+TMPRSS2+ cells were also enriched for other
S protein cleavage enzymes. In the epiblast and day 7 trophectoderm, TMPRSS4, TMPRSS13, CTSB
and CTSL transcripts were present in significantly higher abundance in the ACE2+TMPRSS2+ cells
as compared to the cells that did not express either of the two genes (p-value <0.05). Many other
members of the TMPRSS and Cathepsin family were also enriched in the ACE2+TMPRSS2+ cells,
although many did not reach statistical significance (Supplementary Fig. 2)
Comparative analysis of the differentially abundant transcripts identified 216 genes that were
common in both the epiblast and day 7 trophectodermal lineage, while 1768 genes were unique to
epiblast and 1236 genes were unique to the trophectodermal lineage (Fig. 6). The list of these genes
is given in Supplementary Table 5.
The biological processes associated with the 216 common genes involved sterol, alcohol and
cholesterol metabolism and localization; the enriched KEGG pathways included lysosome and
steroid biosynthesis (Fig. 6). The genes unique to epiblast cells involved biological processes
associated with embryonic development and energy metabolism; enriched KEGG pathways included
oxidative phosphorylation and small molecule metabolism (Fig. 6). The genes unique to the
trophectoderm lineage involved biological processes associated with glycolipid metabolism,
liposaccharide metabolism, and leukocyte activation; enriched KEGG pathways included lysosome,
peroxisome, glycan degradation and herpes simplex virus infection (Fig. 6).

Discussion
The results of the present study demonstrate that early human embryos express coronavirus entry
receptors and S protein proteases. The embryonic cells also expressed the genes for proteins that are
involved in viral endocytosis and replication.
Considering the scale at which the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread globally and the fact that a
proportion of individuals harbouring the virus are asymptomatic, it is likely that some of the infected
individuals may have conceived or are trying to conceive during the duration of the pandemic.
Further, with nearly 1 in 6 couples facing infertility, many would resort to in vitro fertilization (IVF)
techniques for achieving biological parenthood during the pandemic. In both these scenarios, it is
imperative to understand whether the developing embryo is at risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. To
address this question, we analysed single-cell RNA-Seq datasets of developing human embryos for
SCARFs in zygotes to hatched blastocysts. Our results reveal that gametes, zygotes, and 4-cell
embryos express ACE2 and BSG along with CTSL but not TMPRSS2. While the levels of ACE2
decline in the compact morula, the expression of ACE2 and the S protein processing enzymes
increases in the ICM and epiblast of the blastocyst embryos. Along with the cells of the embryo
proper, we also detected abundant expression of these genes in the trophectodermal lineage of the
blastocysts. Although ACE2 is essential for SARS-CoV-2 infection, the processing of the viral spike
protein by the membrane-bound serine protease TMPRSS2 promotes viral infectivity. We observed
that even though more than 80% of cells of the ICM express ACE2, none of these cells express
TMPRSS2. However, in the epiblast (but not the primitive endoderm) and the trophectodermal cells
of the blastocysts, a significant proportion of cells co-express ACE2 and TMPRSS2, indicating that
the early embryonic cells may be permissible to viral entry by the canonical ACE2 mode of entry.
Beyond ACE2, a study has shown that the extracellular matrix metalloproteinase enhancer, CD147,
encoded by the gene BSG binds to both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, promoting viral entry
independent of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (Chen et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2020). We observed that BSG
transcripts were abundantly expressed in all the cells of the developing embryos from the zygote
19

stage to blastocyst stage including the trophectodermal lineage. With regard to S protein priming,
cathepsins are a class of endosomal proteases, and of these, cathepsin L encoded by CTSL is required
for endosomal cleavage of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins (Hoffmann et al., 2020).
Interestingly, along with BSG, CTSL was co-expressed in most of the cells of the developing embryo.
In a subset of cells of the blastocyst cell stage, embryos also co-expressed ACE2 and BSG.
Presently, it is unclear if CD147-mediated viral entry requires cathepsin L or TMPRSS2; the fact that
both these proteins are co-expressed in most trophectodermal cells as well as epiblast cells imply that
both canonical and non-canonical modes of SARS-CoV-2 entry may be operative in developing
embryos.
Two other members of the coronavirus family that are highly infectious and can cause significant
mortality are MERS and HCoV-229E. Unlike SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, MERS and HCoV229E utilize DPP4 and ANPEP as receptors to infect the human host cells (Li, 2015). Interestingly,
we found that DPP4 and ANPEP transcripts are not expressed in the zygotes until the morula stage,
but both receptors are expressed in almost all the cells of the ICM, epiblast, and early endoderm.
Together our data for the first time suggest that early human embryos could be permissive to SARSCoV-2 and other coronaviruses; embryos at the blastocyst stage may be most susceptible to
infection. It will be of interest to study the protein expression of these genes in these cell types and
experimentally determine the effects of SARS-CoV-2 (and other coronaviruses) on blastocyst health.
During development, the cells of the embryo proper are enveloped by a layer of trophectodermal
cells that form the placenta. The placenta is a key determinant of the health of the developing fetus
and protects it from maternal infections. We and others have shown that the trophoblast cells of the
human placenta in the first to third trimester express SCARFs, suggesting that the placenta may be
permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Ashray et al., 2020; Singh et al., 2020b). Extending these
findings, herein we show that the trophectodermal cells that are the precursors of the placenta
abundantly express the SCARFs as early as day 5 when they make their first morphologic
appearance. Furthermore, we also observed that unlike in the case of the placenta, where 5-15% of
the trophoblasts express ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (Ashray et al., 2020), almost all the cells of the
trophectoderm co-express both these factors. Similarly, almost all the trophectodermal cells of the
blastocysts co-transcribe the non-canonical receptor CD147 and the S protein protease CTSL along
with other coronavirus receptors ANPEP and DPP4. These results indicate that the trophectoderm of
early human embryos may be highly permissive to multiple coronaviruses.
Once the virus binds to the receptor and the spike protein undergoes cleavage, SARS-CoV-2 releases

20

its content into the host cells and initiates replication. At this point of the viral infectious cycle, most
enveloped viruses recruit the ESCRT machinery of the host cell. The viral structural protein engages
the tumour susceptibility gene protein (TSG101) in ESCRT-I, which subsequently delivers ESCRTIII to sites of viral budding where membrane scission releases new viral particles (Votteler and
Sundquist, 2013). Several proteins are involved in the ESCRT pathway, and blocking any of these
enzymes can prevent viral endocytosis (Wang et al., 2017; Mazzon and Marsh, 2019). Whether
coronaviruses utilize ESCRT for endocytosis and budding is unknown but there is some evidence for
the SARS-CoV-2 proteins interacting with human proteins of ESCRT pathway (Gordon et al., 2020;
Maaroufi, 2020). Thus, we postulated that for SARS-CoV-2 to be pathogenic to human embryos, the
early embryonic cell must possess the components of the ESCRT machinery for viral endocytosis
and release. Interestingly, we observed that genes for many components of the ESCRT machinery
are not expressed in zygote and morula stages, but a surge in the expression of these genes occurs in
the cells of the blastocyst including the ICM, epiblast, and primitive endoderm and most abundantly
in the cells of the trophectoderm. These results indicate that the human blastocysts expressing SARSCoV-2 receptors not only have the necessary machinery for viral attachment onto the cell surface but
also readily express the infrastructure to facilitate endocytosis and viral budding.
Once the virus enters the cells, the next step in the infectious cycle is replication, which requires
interaction of the viral proteins with host proteins (de Wilde et al., 2018). Our results reveal that as
compared to the zygote, 4- to 8-cell stages, and morula stage embryos, the cells of the blastocyst
show a surge in mRNA expression of most host proteins involved in viral replication. Almost all of
the proteins involved in viral replication were abundantly expressed in the ICM, epiblast, and
primitive endoderm with the highest expression in the trophectoderm. Together our data show that
early developing human embryos have the necessary machinery to facilitate viral replication.
Our analysis, so far, suggests that several genes involved in endocytosis and viral replication are
expressed in the cells of developing embryos. However, it remains imperative to determine if all or a
subset of the cells express these genes. Since most ACE2- and TMPRSS2-positive cells were present
in the epiblast and the trophectoderm, we analysed the data at single-cell resolution and observed that
irrespective of the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, cells of the epiblast and trophectoderm have
transcripts of genes involved in viral endocytosis and replication, albeit with varying degrees of
expression. These genes were also uniformly expressed in cells of the early ICM and the primitive
endoderm (not shown). These results imply that along with the trophectoderm and epiblast, the other
cells of the blastocyst could be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

21

Once the viral RNA enters the host cells, it translates several of its non-structural proteins, which in
turn physically interact with various host proteins to regulate host cell machinery. There are 332
human proteins that physically interact with SARS-CoV-2 (Gordon et al., 2020). These proteins have
a wide range of functional roles in host cellular processes such as DNA replication, vesicle
trafficking, lipid modification, RNA processing and regulation, nuclear transport machinery,
cytoskeletal organization, mitochondrial functions, and extracellular matrix modelling (Gordon et al.,
2020). We observed that mRNA of genes encoding for the SARS-CoV-2 interacting proteins are
expressed in most cells of the ICM, primitive endoderm, and the epiblast; the mRNA levels of these
genes were also high in the cells of the trophectodermal lineage. Together our observations imply
that in human embryos, a high proportion of genes representing protein products that interact with
SARS-CoV-2 are expressed in the cells of the embryo proper and even more so in the
trophectoderm.
In developing embryos, the health of the cells of the epiblast and trophectoderm are crucial as these
cells subsequently undergo gastrulation and placentation, respectively. Any damage to these cells,
physically or functionally, may lead to embryo lethality or organ dysfunctions in later development.
To understand the molecular characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 permissive cells, we analysed the
gene signature of the ACE2+TMPRSS2+ epiblast and day 7 trophectodermal cells. We identified
1985 genes in the epiblast that were differentially expressed between the ACE2- and TMPRSS2positive cells and ACE2- and TMPRSS2-negative cells; 1452 genes were differentially abundant in
the trophectodermal lineage. Unique gene signatures of ACE2-positive cells have also been reported
for other tissues (Seow et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020; Ziegler et al., 2020). Amongst the overabundant
genes in the ACE2+TMPRSS2+ epiblast and trophectoderm cells were cathepsins (including CTSL)
and members of the TMPRSS family, some of which are required for SARS-CoV-2 S protein
cleavage (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Shang et al., 2020a; Zang et al., 2020). Beyond the proteases,
mRNA levels of several other proteins such as TROP2 (also known as TACSTD2) were also detected
in higher abundance in the ACE2+TMPRSS2+ cells of the epiblast and trophectoderm. In the adult
human liver, the highest expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are detected in TROP2-positive cells,
and viral infection of the TROP2+ progenitors may be a cause of hepatic failure in patients with
COVID-19 (Seow et al., 2020). These observations imply that the ACE2+TMPRSS2+ cells could
have a unique profile of genes that could aid in viral infectivity and pathogenesis of COVID-19.
Single-cell RNA-Seq has revealed that in developing human embryos, the inner cell mass and
trophectoderm segregate on day 5 of development, the trophectodermal lineage progressively gets
specified, and by day 7 two distinct sub-populations of trophectoderm become evident (Petropoulos
22

et al., 2016). In contrast, the epiblast retains pluripotency, and transcriptomic hallmarks of selfrenewal are observed well until day 7 (Singh et al., 2019). Despite such developmental divergence,
we observed that the ACE2+TMPRSS2+ cells of the epiblast and trophectoderm shared a unique
gene signature. The biological processes associated with the common genes involved sterol, alcohol,
and cholesterol metabolism, and the steroid biosynthesis KEGG pathway was enriched. Host cell
fatty acid synthesis machinery plays a crucial role in viral genome replication and virion production,
and accumulation of sterols allows for production of secluded membranes for viral replication, which
shields viral nucleic acids from immune surveillance (Mayer et al., 2019). In the context of
coronaviruses, a fine-tuned host lipid profile is essential to achieve optimal viral replication (Yan et
al., 2019). Along with lipid metabolism, the common genes in the ACE2+TMPRSS2+ cells of the
epiblast and trophectoderm are also enriched in lysosomes and lysosomal proteases. Endosomelysosome fusion profoundly promotes infection, and lysosomal proteases are an important
determinant of the species and tissue tropism of coronaviruses (Burkard et al., 2014; Zheng et al.,
2018). Furthermore, genes in endocytosis and lysosome pathways are highly enriched in cells of the
lungs of patients with COVID-19 (Xiong et al., 2020) and lysosomotropic drugs like
hydroxychloroquine and others have potential for anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity (Gordon et al., 2020;
Sarma et al., 2020). Thus, it appears that the ACE2+TMPRSS2+ cell subsets in the developing
embryo have a milieu conducive for viremia.
The ACE2+TMPRSS2+ cells of the trophectoderm and epiblast also had unique gene signatures. In
the trophectoderm pathways of herpes simplex viral infection, glycan modifications and peroxisomes
were enriched. Glycans are essential components of viruses including SARS-CoV-2 and play a key
role in their pathogenesis (Fanibunda et al., 2011; Watanabe et al., 2020). Peroxisomes are
multifunctional organelles with roles in cellular metabolism and signalling; some virus-host
interactions rewire host peroxisomes to support viral replication and spread (Lazarow, 2011). The
role of host glycan modifications and peroxisome machinery in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis is yet to
be understood; it is tempting to propose that since these pathways are enriched in the
ACE2+TMPRSS2+ cells, it will be worth exploring these processes for identifying novel drugs for
SARS-CoV-2. In the epiblast, the unique genes in ACE2+TMPRSS2+ cells, as expected, had roles in
cellular organization for embryonic development, which also included enriched genes in oxidative
phosphorylation. A higher expression of genes involved in metabolic pathways including oxidative
phosphorylation is reported in neutrophils of COVID-19 patients (Gardinassi et al., 2020; Singh et
al., 2020a). Together the results imply a possible role of mitochondrial activity in SARS-CoV-2
infection.
23

Thus, our analyses reveal that the ACE2- and TMPRSS2-positive cells in the epiblast and
trophectoderm are enriched for genes involved with lipid metabolic pathways and lysosomes; the
trophectoderm cells specifically are enriched for genes involved in the peroxisome while the epiblast
cells are enriched for genes involved in mitochondrial functions. Since all these processes are
utilized by viruses (including coronaviruses), it is tempting to propose that the coronaviruses have
adapted to optimize access to the host cells that are highly permissive for viral propagation, and in
different tissues, multiple pathways could be utilized for their spread.
Viral infections in pregnancy are associated with adverse outcomes such as miscarriages, stillbirths,
and congenital abnormalities (Adams Waldorf et al., 2018). Preimplantation embryos are considered
to be protected because the zona pellucida acts as a barrier that reduces the susceptibility of
embryonic cells to viral infection. However, reduced survival of zona-intact mouse embryos is
observed upon exposure to Zika viruses (Tan et al., 2019; Block et al., 2020), suggesting that the
zona pellucida may be more vulnerable than it is believed to be. In addition, the Zika virus has been
shown to infect the trophectoderm and ICM of preimplantation embryos that express the Zika
receptors, and exposure of early preimplantation embryos to Zika viruses compromises fetal brain
development (Tan et al., 2019). Extrapolating from these observations and the fact that cells of the
embryo proper and the trophectoderm are potentially permissive to viral entry, it is plausible that
SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses may also have embryo-toxic effects. Indeed, ACE2 and
TMPRSS2, which are highly expressed in the developing trophectoderm, are also expressed in the
human placental cells, and virions are detected in the trophoblast cells of the placenta from a
pregnant women with COVID-19 (Ashray et al., 2020; Hosier et al., 2020; Vivanti et al., 2020).
Further, placental damage is observed in pregnancies complicated by SARS-CoV-2 infection
(Bahadur et al., 2020; Verma et al., 2020). While it will be impossible to generate data on the longterm consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human embryos, clinicians and patients seeking
fertility options via in vitro fertilization specifically must be aware of the potential negative impact
of SARS-CoV-2 on early developing embryos.
Overall, this study provides a roadmap for future studies on embryo-toxic effects of SARS-CoV-2
and other coronaviruses. While this is the first in-depth survey of SCARF expression in developing
human embryos, it is limited by the constraints and shortcomings of scRNA-seq. These include
under-representation of rare cell types, isolation biases, and statistical cutoffs. Furthermore, RNA
expression levels do not always accurately reflect protein abundance; therefore, our observations
must be corroborated for protein expression in situ. Also, SCARF expression may be modulated by
co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens, resulting in completely diverse consequences.
24

Nevertheless, our study provides valuable baseline data on SCARFs in developing human embryos,
which may prove to be a useful resource in the context of not just SARS-CoV-2 but also other viral
infections in general. This knowledge will be useful to clinics performing IVF procedures during the
COVID-19 pandemic in order to develop evidence-based guidelines for patient management.

Contribution to the field
This study is the first in-depth survey of coronavirus receptors and its associated factors in
developing human embryos. We show that human embryonic and the trophectoderm cells (which
develop in to the placenta) express the necessary factors that can aid in viral entry, replication and
dissemination. Overall, this study provides evidence for potential embryo-toxic effects of SARSCoV-2 and other coronaviruses. Clinically, this knowledge will be useful in developing guidelines
