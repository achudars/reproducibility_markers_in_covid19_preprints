The worldwide spread of COVID-19 has called for fast advancement of new modelling strategies
to estimate its unprecedented spread. Here, we introduce a model based on the fundamental SIR
equations with a stochastic disorder by a random exchange of infected populations between cities to
study dynamics in an interacting network of epicentres in a model state. Although each stochastic
exchange conserves populations pair-wise, the disorder drives the global system towards newer routes
to dynamic equilibrium. Upon controlling the range of the exchange fraction, we show that it is
possible to control the heterogeneity in the spread and the co-operativity among the interacting
hotspots. Data of collective temporal evolution of the infected populations in federal states of
Germany validate the qualitative features of the model.

The sudden outbreak of the pandemic of the Novel
Coronavirus (COVID-19) has caught emergency attention for its unprecedented rage in most parts of the
globe, overwhelming the healthcare facilities, locking
down cities, hitting hard the economy [1, 2]. Within the
first four months from the very first report from the city
of Wuhan at the end of December 2019[1, 3], the epidemic
has already reached more than 200 countries, in all the
inhabited continents, infecting more nearly 2.5 million
people globally [4]. The death toll is already touching
the sky at a devastating pace[4].
Such pandemics, however, are not new in recent times:
The 1918 Spanish flu resulted in 50-100 million deaths
throughout the globe[5, 6]. In recent years, similar coronavirus outbreak happened in 2003 (SERS-Cov) [7] and
2012 (MERS) [8] killing around a thousand people in
China and the Middle east. Following that the outbreak
of Ebola cost more than ten thousand lives in Africa[9].
After resulting in massacres in Europe, the pandemic has
turned its head towards the United States where more
than half of a million people have already been infected
within a short span[10]. The complexity in understanding and estimating the spatial spread of the pandemic
lies in the conflicting numbers of the rates at which the
virus is transmitted to the neighbourhood[11]. Specifically, when multiple hotspots coexist together, only a few
recursive events of local transmission turn into a catastrophic avalanche with dramatically increasing number of
infections in a very short time window[12]. Moreover, the
adaptability of the virus in ever-changing environments
is also surprising[13]. Thus, identification of the true
character and the self-organization of the epidemic has
emerged as one of the biggest global challenges in human
history. This is pivotal to develop non-pharmaceutical
antidotes with sophisticated intervention strategies to
control the dispersal of the pandemic until some clinical solutions arrive in support[14].
Indeed, there are many major challenges in predicting the spatial spread in a country having multiple epicentres of human transmission, using phenomenologi-

cal models[15]. Since an effective model requires the
prior knowledge of transmission and recovery rates, it
is almost impossible to estimate them in the midway
of an epidemic, for the rates depend on the nature
of instantaneous social preparedness that vary locally.
For instance, Germany had three major infected regions, Bavaria, Baden-Wuerttemberg and North RhineWestphalia which had roughly twenty thousand cases in
each of these federal states on average by the first week
of April[16]. In contrast, the other neighbouring states,
Rhineland-Palatinate, Saarland, Hesse had surprisingly
smaller numbers[16]. This situation is significantly different from Hubei that alone had more than eighty percent
of the total cases in China[17].
”Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are
useful”[18]. Here, we address the dynamics in an epidemic using a model of interacting hotspots. We consider
a model state consisting of multiple cities that exchange
infected populations pair-wise stochastically where the
local dynamics in the individual cities are governed by
the deterministic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR)
model with instantaneously or regularly updated populations. Moreover, the order of the random exchange
of the infected populations is controlled by a connectivity parameter. We show that tuning the connectivity
parameter, it is possible to control the cooperativity of
the infection propagation. However, the heterogeneity in
the cooperativity determines controls over the outbreak.
We validate the qualitative features of the model with
the data of the heterogeneous evolution of COVID-19 in
different provinces of Germany. We discuss further possibilities of development.
We consider model dynamics in a state consisting of
different cities that are allowed to exchange populations
among themselves. The population exchange is subject
to a containment measure modelled via a connectivity
parameter which is assumed to be a constant and identical for all cities. M such interacting cities are considered with initial total populations N i being the sum of
the Susceptible (S i ), Infected (I i ) and Recovered (Ri )

2
populations in a city i. For simplicity, the exchange
process uses the criteria of classic random exchange of
econophysics[19]. During an exchange each of two cities
retains an identical fraction of population η and redistributes a random fraction of the infected population
pair-wise. The interactions between a pair of cities (i
and j) with infected population I i and I j are governed
by the exchange rules :
I i → I˜i

(1)

I j → I˜j

(2)

I˜i = ηI i + fR (1 − η)(I i + I j )

(3)

I˜j = ηI j + (1 − fR )(1 − η)(I i + I j )

(4)

where

with I i + I j = I˜i + I˜j . The process also ensures the
conservation: N i + N j = Ñ i + N˜j during the exchange
processes. However. after t = 0, the model does not use
any restrictions to enforce any conservation in the global
population. Here, fR is the random fraction (taken as a
uniform deviate between 0 and 1) and η is the connectivity parameter. The parameter serves in the same way as
the saving propensity does in the context of econophysics
models[19].
Now in the city, i, the time dependent population,
N i is sum of instantaneous updated susceptible(S i ),
infected(I˜i ) and recovered (Ri ) populations following the
SIR equations of motions[15]:

We consider M
2 number of stochastic random exchanges using Eq. (3-4) between the cities before we update populations using Eqs. (5-7) (See numerical scheme
in the Supplementary Information(SI), SI Note.1 ) in
each time step. The number of exchanges are optimised
in order to ensure significant amount of exchange of infected population among the cities that drives the process. In each of the time steps, we now solve 3M number

of coupled differential equations alongside M
2 [20] number of random exchanges to extract the dynamics. We
use the time step δt = 1 for the integration throughout
the calculation.
We monitor the dynamics of such a state consisting
of M = 64, 1024 and 4096 cities with identical initial
population (N i = 1 at t = 0) for different ranges of magnitudes of connectivity parameter, η. Here N i , S i , I i , Ri
represent the fraction of the total population in the state
M . Each city has identical initial infected population
as I i (0) = 0.0001[21]. The initial conditions make sure
that every city has identical behaviour for η = 1 when
the cities are made isolated by some intervention protocol as, for η = 1, the cities retain all the population and
does not actively take part in the exchanges. In contrast,
they exchange freely for η = 0.
In Fig. 1, we show the dynamics of the infected (I) and
recovered (R) population in the state with M = 64 for
η = 1.0, 0.5 and 0.0. For η = 1.0, the cities are isolated
completely. Hence, the behavior of the individual cities
are identical to the solutions of SIR equations for a case
with identical parameters (See SI Note:2 and SI Fig. 1).
For β = 0.5 and γ = 0.3333, the peak in I appears at
t ≈ 50 with a peak height I P = 0.06 while S and R
saturates to steady values S S ≈ 0.45 and RS ≈ 0.55
respectively beyond t ≈ 80. This we also see in the upper
panels in Fig. 1 for η = 1.0. The peaks in I also appear
simultaneously for all the cities t ≈ 50.
For η < 1, as the exchanges of the infected fraction between the cities set in, the behavioural differences in the
cities become prominent. In the middle panels of Fig. 1,
we show the evolution of Infected and Recovered population for η = 0.5. We see heterogeneity in the infection
propagation: Not only the peaks appear in different times
in the different cities, but also the height of the peaks in
I i become distinct for each city. The dynamic equilibrium is attained when I i → 0 for all i simultaneously
at sufficiently long time after the individual peaks in the
infected populations in the cities are observed. These effects become more prominent for lower η. For η = 0, the
exchange is completely uncontrolled as individual cities
do not have any restriction in retaining the fraction of infected population. Hence, the distributions of both I and
R become more diffused as shown in the bottom panels
of Fig. 1.
Now for all these cases, we look at the time evolution of
the probability distribution of the infected populations,
P (I; t) with increasing t. In Fig. 2, we show the evolution of P (I; t) for different cases of η. As there is a
tiny population of infected population in the beginning
due to the initial condition, the distribution at t = 0,
P (I; 0) ≈ δ(I(0)) for all values of η. For η = 1, as individual cities show a peak at t ≈ 50, the delta peak of
P (I) also shifts to higher values of I (Fig. 2.(a.2)). Since
all the cities behave identically for η = 1, there is no
spread in the distributions for all t. At higher t when the
infected population → 0, the distribution again shifts to

smaller values of I(Fig.2(a.3)).
The situation changes for any η < 1 as the exchanges
bring broadening in P (I; t), specifically at t → 50. For
η = 0.5, there is a significant broadening in P (I) for
40 < t < 60 [Fig.2(b)]. The nature of the tail in P (I) albeit changes with t. We even observe a shift in the mode
of the peak in P i [Figs. 2(b.1) and 2(b.2)]. The length of
the tail decreases [Fig. 2(b.3)] and disappears at higher t.
For η = 0 [Fig.2(c)], the broadening in the distributions
is more prominent, even at intermediate t[Fig.2(c.1)]. At
t ≈ 50, the tail in P (I) exists upto I ≈ 0.375. It affirms that there is finite probability to have cities with
extremely large proportion of the infected populations of
the order of I ≈ 0.375 which is almost 37.5 percent of the
total population [Fig.2(c.2)]. With increasing t, the tail
decreases in I and the peak reaches ≈ 0 as the epidemic
mitigates around t ≈ 75.
In order to understand the role of heterogeneity in the
infection propagation, we now focus on the behaviour of
the moments of P (I) for different values of the connectivityRindex, η, at different t [Fig. 3]. The mean of P (I),
µ = IP (I)dI is shown in Fig. 3(a). The behaviour

of µ doesn’t show much heterogeneity, suggesting that
the collective peak appears almost at similar times as
for individual cities. This doesn’t change much as η is
varied. However, the height of the collective peak decrease for smaller η around t ≈ 50. The variance of
P (I), σ 2 (t) =< I(t) >2 − < I 2 (t) > show interesting
pattern for t ≈ 50 [Fig. 3(b)] as η is varied. Quite naturally, σ 2 (t) → 0 for η → 1. As η is decreased, the cooperativity also decreases due to increasingly larger disorder. For small η and η = 0, σ 2 (t) show prominent
non-monotonic behaviour with increasing t. However,
the non-monotonic dependence vanishes as η → 1.
The shift in µ occurs due to the simultaneous increase
in the infected populations while the peak in σ 2 is due
to distinct behaviours of the cities. We now look at the
behaviour of σ/µ that captures the competition between
the two factors. In Fig. 4(a), we show the phase diagram
of σ/µ. σ/µ has prominent non-monotonic dependence
near t ≈ 50 for smaller values of η. The peak defines
the timescale of heterogeneity in the collective infection

transmission.
We now attempt to understand the COVID-19 data
of the cases in different provinces of Germany using the
insights of the model. The time series data for Germany
for all 16 provinces are shown in Supplementary Information (SI Figs. 2-5). We now analyse the behaviour of
σ/µ computed from the distribution of the infected populations in provinces of Germany (See SI Figs. 2-5). We
see σ/µ has a sharp peak on 23rd March, 2020. In order
to verify the heterogeneity, we further look at the dynamic statistical correlation between the daily new cases
in the different provinces for the successive days, using
the Pearson correlation between the distribution of the
infected populations at all the provinces in time t and
t + 1, given by

ρ(t, t + 1) =

cov[P (I; t), P (I; t + 1)]
σ(t)σ(t + 1)

(8)

We show the dynamic statistical correlation, ρ(t, t + 1)
between the number of cases on successive days from all
the federal states of Germany in Fig. 5. We avoid the
double count in the data. The trend in the statistical correlation behaves non-monotonically in the period, with a
dip on 23rd March when the peak in σµ appeared, reiter-

ating the effect of heterogeneity due to lack of dynamical statistical correlation. Surprisingly, the date exactly
matches the date of the beginning of the lockdown in
Germany. From the first week of April, there is a clear
trend of flattening of the curve with significantly smaller
number of cases with respect to the maximum numbers
recorded on 27th March.
Always, there are continuous exchanges of populations
between the provinces in a country unless any intervention is imposed. The mobility between the cities without

5
restriction, in principle resembles the η = 0 case of the
model while the situation with strict intervention behaves
as η = 1 case of the model when the cities are considered
isolated. Considering time dependence in η, it is possible
to realize a dynamic picture from pre to post lockdown
situations. The behaviour of σ/µ qualitatively features
the balance between the spread of the infection in the
cities and the relative change in the collective spread of
the epidemic in the state. The extremum in σ/µ captures
the extreme heterogeneity in the infection propagation as
it optimize the relative balance between the local spread
and drive in the collective transmission. On this note, the
model that we use delivers the similar qualitative feature
of the data of COVID-19 cases in the states of Germany.
Whether the appearance of the peak in heterogeneity
is a universal confirmatory signature of containment, can
be confirmed only by further studies. There are many
possible ways to develop the minimalistic model. It is
possible to include time dependence in the parameters.
Random deviates of a different kind can also be tested
for modelling specific situations. Also, possibilities of
further customization needs system specific details and
the set of governing equations where specific rules of
death, quarantine or hospitalization counts could be considered in addition. Further, it would be challenging to
model the transportation of the infected populations using deterministic equations[22], vis-a-vis the data driven
approaches[23, 24]. On this note, we believe, that this
study, opens up horizons in exploring the rich dynamics
of infection propagation inluding sophisticated intervention among the interacting hotspots.
