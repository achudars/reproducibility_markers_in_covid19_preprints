Abstract: The current pandemic caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is having
negative health, social and economic consequences worldwide. In Europe, the pandemic
started to develop strongly at the end of February and beginning of March 2020. It has
subsequently spread over the continent, with special virulence in northern Italy and inland
Spain. In this study we show that an unusual persistent anticyclonic situation prevailing in
southwestern Europe during February 2020 (i.e. anomalously strong positive phase of the
North Atlantic and Arctic Oscillations) could have resulted in favorable conditions, in
terms of air temperature and humidity, in Italy and Spain for a quicker spread of the virus
compared with the rest of the European countries. It seems plausible that the strong
atmospheric stability and associated dry conditions that dominated in these regions may
have favored the virus’s propagation, by short-range droplet transmission as well as likely
by long-range aerosol (airborne) transmission.

Background
The world is currently undergoing a pandemic associated with the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is a new coronavirus first noticed in late
2019 in the Hubei province, China1,2. The virus has a probable bat3,4 origin, and causes the
ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Although it is crucial to find a proper
vaccine and medical treatment for this pandemic, it is also relevant to know the main
factors controlling the transmission of the virus and disease, including the role of
meteorological conditions in the spread of the virus. The World Health Organization
(WHO) states that robust studies are needed to refine forecasting models and inform public
health measures5.
Respiratory virus infections can be transmitted via direct and indirect contact, or by means
of particles (droplets or aerosols) emitted after a cough or sneeze or during conversation by
an infected person. The large particles (>5 μm diameter) are referred to as respiratory
droplets and tend to settle down quickly on the ground, usually within one meter of
distance. The small particles (<5 μm in diameter) are referred to as droplet nuclei and are
related to an airborne transmission. These particles can remain suspended in the air for
longer periods of time and can reach a longer distance from the origin6. These small aerosol
particles are inhalable and can penetrate all the way down to the alveolar space in the
lungs7, where cell receptors for some infectious respiratory viruses are located, including

the angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) used by SARS-CoV-2 to infect the
individual3.
Airborne transmission has been suggested to play a key role in some diseases like
tuberculosis or measles, and even in coronaviruses8–10. A recent study has described that the
SARS-CoV-2 virus can remain viable at least up to 3 hours in airborne conditions11.
Respiratory droplets and aerosols loaded with pathogens can reach distances up to 7-8
meters under some specific conditions such as a turbulence gas cloud emitted after a cough
of an infected person12. A study performed in Wuhan, the capital of the Hubei province, has
shown that the SARS-CoV-2 virus could be found in several health care institutions, as
well as in some crowded public areas of the city. It also highlights a potential resuspension
of the infectious aerosols from the floors or other hard surfaces with the walking and
movement of people13. Another study has also shown evidence of potential airborne
transmission in a health care institution14.
Recent studies have pointed out a main role of temperature and humidity in the spread of
COVID-19. Warm conditions and wet atmospheres tend to reduce the transmission of the
disease15–22. For example, it has also been pointed out that the main first outbreaks
worldwide occurred during periods with temperatures around 5-11ºC, never falling below
0ºC, and specific humidity of 3-6 g/kg aproximately18.
The first major outbreak in Europe was reported in Northern Italy in late February 2020.
Following that, several major cases have been reported in Spain, Switzerland and France in
early March, with a subsequent spread over many parts of Europe. At present (28th March
2020) Italy and Spain are still the two main contributors of cases and deaths in the

continent, with major health, political and socio-economic implications. The main
hypothesis of this work is that the atmospheric circulation pattern in February 2020 has
helped to shape the spatial pattern of the outbreak of the disease in Europe.

February 2020: a highly unusual circulation pattern
The main atmospheric circulation pattern during February 2020 was characterized by an
anomalous anticyclonic system over the western Mediterranean basin, centered between
Spain and Italy, and lower pressures over Northern Europe centered over the Northern Sea
and Iceland (Figure 1, Figure S1). This spatial configuration represents the well-known
North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)23,24 in its positive phase, which is the teleconnection
pattern linked to dry conditions in southern Europe whereas the opposite occurs in northern
Europe25.
Figure 2 and Figure S2 show maps for February 2020 for several meteorological fields that
provide clear evidence of the stable atmospheric circulation in southern Europe, with a
tendency towards very dry (i.e., lack of precipitation) and calm conditions. As suggested in
an earlier analysis18, the SARS-CoV-2 virus seems to be transmitted most effectively in dry
conditions with daily mean air temperatures between around 5ºC and 11ºC, which are the
conditions shown in Figure 2 for the major part of Italy and Spain. By contrast, northern
Europe has experienced mainly wet and windy conditions due to an anomalous strong
westerly circulation that is linked to rainy conditions. These spatial patterns fit with the
well-known climate features associated over Europe during positive phases of the NAO26.
The Arctic Oscillation (AO), which is a teleconnection pattern very much linked to NAO,

showed in February 2020 the strongest positive value during 1950-2010 (Figure S3). The
AO reflects the northern polar vortex variability at surface level27, and it consists of a lowpressure centre located over the Norwegian sea and the Arctic ocean and a high-pressure
belt between 40 and 50ºN, forming an annular-like structure. Positive values of the AO
index mean a strong polar vortex, and the anomalous positive phase experienced during
early 2020 has been linked with the recent ozone loss just registered over the Arctic
region28.

Meteorology and the spatial pattern of the outbreak in Europe
We argue that this spatial configuration of the atmospheric circulation might have played a
key role in the modulation of the early spread of the COVID-19 outbreaks over Europe. It
is known that some cases were reported already in mid-January in France, with subsequent
cases in Germany and other countries29. Thus, the SARS-CoV-2 virus was already in
Europe in early 2020, but it may only have started to extend rapidly when suitable
atmospheric conditions for its spread were reached. It is possible that these proper
conditions were met in February, mainly in Italy and Spain, due to the anticyclonic
conditions previously mentioned.
The link between the COVID-19 spread and atmospheric circulation has been tested as
follows. We have extracted the monthly anomalies of sea level pressure (SLP) and 500 hPa
geopotential height for February 2020 over each grid point of the 15 capitals of the
European countries (Figure S4) with the highest number of COVID-19 cases reported so far
(see Data and Methods). Figure 3 (top) shows that there is a statistically significant

(R2=0.481, p<0.05) second order polynomial fit between the anomalies of the 500 hPa and
the total cases per population. Italy, Spain, and Switzerland, which are the only countries
with more than 1,000 cases/million inhabitants in our dataset, clustered together in regions
with very large positive anomalies of 500 hPa geopotential heights. For the total number of
deaths the fit is also statistically significant for a second order polynomial regression
(R2=0.50, p<0.05), and it shows clearly how Italy and Spain are out of scale compared to
the rest of the European countries. Similar results are obtained using SLP fields (not
shown).
These results evidence that it seems plausible that the positive phase of the NAO, and the
atmospheric conditions associated with it, provided optimal conditions for the spread of the
COVID-19 in southern countries like Spain and Italy, where both the start and the most
severe impacts of the outbreak in Europe were located. To test this hypothesis further we
have also analyzed the COVID-19 and meteorological data within Spain (see Data and
Methods, Figure S5). The results show that mean temperature and specific humidity
variables have the strong relation with COVID and fit with an exponential function (Figure
4). They indicate that lower mean temperatures (i.e., average of around 8-11ºC) and lower
specific humidity (e.g., <6 g/Kg) conditions are related to a higher number of cases and
deaths in Spain. Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning that both meteorological variables are
highly correlated (R2=0.838, p<0.05) and are not independent of each other. The
temperatures as low as 8-10ºC are only reached in a few regions such as Madrid, Navarra,
La Rioja, Aragon, Castille and Leon and Castilla-La Mancha. These areas are mainly
located in inland Spain where drier conditions were reported the weeks before the outbreak.
The rest of Spain experienced higher temperatures and consequently were out of the areas

of higher potential for the spread of the virus, as reported so far in the literature15–22. In
addition, higher levels of humidity also limit the impact of the disease, and therefore the
coastal areas seem to benefit from lower rates of infection. Thus, in the southern regions of
Spain (all of them with more than 13ºC and higher levels of specific humidity) we found
lower rates of infection and deceases. This is in line with the spatial pattern in Italy, with
the most (least) affected regions by COVID-19 mainly located in the North (South). In
contrast, when the whole of Europe is considered on a country by country basis (see above
and Figure 3), we find the opposite, a clear gradient with more severity from North to South
as commented previously.
The spatial pattern of COVID-19 described above has some intriguing resemblances with
the 1918 influenza pandemic, which is the latest deadly pandemic in modern history of
Europe. The excess-mortality rates across Europe in the 1918 flu also showed a clear northsouth gradient, with a higher mortality in southern European countries (i.e., Portugal, Spain
or Italy) as compared to northern regions, an aspect that is not explained by socio-economic
or health factors30. In Spain, a south-north gradient is also reported in the 1918 flu after
controlling for demographic factors31. The central and northern regions of Spain
experienced higher rates of mortality, and this has been suggested to be linked to more
favorable climate conditions for influenza transmission as compared to the southern
regions31. Interestingly, the SLP anomalies of the months before the major wave of this
pandemic (which occurred in October-November 1918) shows a clear south-north dipole
with positive anomalies in southern Europe centered over the Mediterranean, and negative
ones in northern Europe (Figure S6). In other words, the NAO was also in its positive phase
just before the major outbreak of the 1918 influenza pandemic. This resembles the spatial

patterns described above for the current COVID-19 outbreak, both in terms of the spatial
distribution of the mortality of the pandemic over Europe as well as in prevailing
atmospheric circulation conditions before the major outbreak. These intriguing
coincidences need further research in order to better understand the spatial and temporal
distribution of large respiratory-origin pandemics over Europe.
Taking into account these results, we claim that the major initial outbreaks of COVID-19 in
Europe (i.e., Italy and Spain) may be favored by an anomalous atmospheric circulation
pattern in February, characterized by a positive phase of the NAO and AO. Taking into
consideration current evidences in the literature, it seems that suitable conditions of air
temperature and humidity were reached in Northern Italy and inland Spain. Indeed,
meteorological conditions can affect the susceptibility of an infected host by altering the
mucosal antiviral defense32 and the stability and transmission of the virus33, as well as
social contact patterns34. We also hypothesize that the anomalous meteorological conditions
experienced in Italy and Spain promoted the airborne contagion both indoors and outdoors,
in addition to the direct and indirect contact and short-range droplets, which helped to
speed up the rates of effective reproductive number (R) of the virus (Figure S7). Equally,
the anticyclonic conditions, amplified in some areas by temperature inversions, may have
reduced the dispersion of the virus outdoors. This stability and lack of precipitation can also
produce more processes of suspension and resuspension of the infected aerosols indoors
and, especially, outdoors, in a similar way as resuspension of anthropogenic pollutants in
cities35,36. Equally, it is also suggested that high atmospheric pollutant concentrations can
be positively related to increase fatalities related to respiratory virus infections37,38 and even
COVID-1939. This is a relevant issue as the main hotspot of COVID-19 in Italy is located

in the Po valley, one of the most polluted regions of Europe, as well as the Madrid region
(the most affected region so far in Spain)40.

Conclusions and outlook
Although the outbreak of a pandemic is controlled by a high number of biological, health,
political, social, economic and environmental factors, with complex and non-linear
interrelationships between them, the results of this study indicate that an anomalous
atmospheric circulation may explain why the COVID-19 outbreak in Europe developed
more easily (or faster) in the south-west (mainly north of Italy and inland of Spain).
Specifically, the extreme positive phase of the AO and NAO during February 2020 could
have modulated the beginning of the major outbreaks of COVID-19 in Europe. This
detected anomalous atmospheric pattern, which produces dry conditions over southwestern
Europe, may have provided optimal meteorological conditions for the virus propagation. In
the context of anthropogenic climate change, it has been shown that in future emissions
scenarios a poleward expansion of the Hadley cell is expected41, which in turn is in line
with a tendency to increase the frequency of positive phases of the NAO42 (Figure S8).
This should be taken into account for planning against future epidemics and pandemics that
arise from respiratory viruses.
Interestingly, the conditions during the last major pandemic experienced in Europe (the
Spanish flu in 1918), seem to resemble the current spatial pattern of affectation with more
cases in the South of Europe as compared to the North. Equally, the dominant atmospheric
situation was strongly affected by anticyclonic (cyclonic) conditions in the South (North) of

Europe. Further research is needed in order to better understand the spatio-temporal
patterns of large epidemic and pandemic situations, and their connection with the prevailing
atmospheric conditions patterns.

Data and methods
NCEP/NCAR1, ERA52 and ERA20C3 atmospheric data are used in this manuscript. The
maps and data have been retrieved by using the tools and websites referenced in the main
text, and more details about the spatial and temporal resolution, vertical levels, assimilation
schemes, etc. can be consulted in their references. In brief, an atmospheric reanalysis like
those used here is a climate data assimilation project which aims to assimilate historical
atmospheric observational data spanning an extended period, using a single consistent
assimilation scheme throughout, with the aim of providing continuous gridded data for the
whole globe.
The Artic Oscillation (AO) index has been extracted from the Climate Prediction Center of
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The AO index is
constructed by projecting the daily 1000 hPa height anomalies poleward of 20°N onto the
loading pattern of the AO, this latter being defined as the leading mode of Empirical
Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis of monthly mean 1000 hPa height. More details and
data: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/precip/CWlink/daily_ao_index/ao.shtml.
COVID-19 data on country basis were obtained on March 26th, 2020 from the website
https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/, which it is mainly based on the data provided
by the Coronavirus COVID-19 Global Cases by the Center for Systems Science and
Engineering (CSSE) at the Johns Hopkins University. Data from Spain on regional scale

were obtained on March 28th, 2020 from the Spanish Government through the Institute of
Health Carlos III (ISCIII): https://covid19.isciii.es/
For the link between the COVID-19 spread on European scale and atmospheric circulation
we have extracted the monthly anomalies of sea level pressure (SLP) and 500 hPa
geopotential height for February 2020 over each grid point of the 15 capitals of the
European countries. We have selected the SLP and 500 hPa fields in order to summarize
the meteorological conditions over each location, as it is known that several meteorological
variables can be involved in the transmission of respiratory viruses4,5. With this approach
we also avoid the lack of properly updated data for all potential meteorological variables
involved in the COVID-19 spread, which needs further research as soon as the pandemic
ends and a more reliable and complete database of both COVID-19 impact and
meteorological data can be compiled6.
For Spain, several meteorological variables with high-quality records were obtained from
the Spanish Meteorology Agency (AEMET) based on surface observations for each of the
capital cities of the provinces inside each autonomous region. Specifically, monthly
averages for February 2020 of 2-m temperature, 2-m maximum temperature, 2-m minimum
temperature (°C), air pressure (hPa), wind speed (km h−1), specific humidity (g Kg-1),
relative humidity (%), total precipitation (mm) and days of more than 1 mm of
precipitation. An arithmetic average has been calculated for the autonomous regions with
more than one province.
We have checked Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) simulations
for two future scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) at the end of the 21th century.

Statistical analysis was performed with R software package for linear, multiple and
polynomial regressions. The statistical significance was considered at the 5% level of
confidence (p<0.05).

Figure S3. Time series of the Artic Oscillation (AO) index from 1950 to 2020 provided by
the Climate Prediction Center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA). The February 2020 is the highest value (3.417), closely followed by 1990 (3.402)
and 1989 (3.279) and far away from the 4th largest value in 1959 (2.544). This highlights
the exceptionally extreme AO pattern of the past February 2020 in a long-term perspective.

Figure S7. Schematic representation of particles emitted by a cough, with the large droplets
settled down nearby (e.g., 1 m distance) and the smaller airborne particles spreading in
suspension for longer time, and reaching longer distances, especially in dry and stable
conditions as compared to wet environments. It is also possible that a resuspension of
aerosol particles can eventually happen due to human activities (e.g., walking, cleaning,
etc.) or air flows, which is enhanced under dry conditions due to the lack of precipitation.

CMIP5 ensemble (one member per model) for the (top) RCP4.5 and (bottom) RCP8.5
emission scenarios at the end of the 21th century. The differences are computed expressed
as the 2081-2100 minus 1986-2005 period. Only statistically significant fields (p<0.05) are
plotted as estimated by a Student’s t-Test. Map composed with the data and tools provided
by the KNMI Climate Explorer website (https://climexp.knmi.nl/start.cgi). The maps show
a consistent picture of an intensification of the positive NAO phase, which implies that in
the future winter conditions as experienced over Europe past February 2020 could become
more common.
