Abstract
The respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) that has been declared as pandemic by the world health organization (WHO) in March, 2020. It is
evident that the infection with this coronavirus starts with the upper respiratory tract and as the virus grows, the
infection can progress to lungs and develop pneumonia. According to the statistics, approximately 14% of the infected
people with COVID-19 have severe cough and shortness of breath due to pneumonia, because as the viral infection
increases, it damages the alveoli (small air sacs) and surrounding tissues. When the alveoli are damaged, there is an
influx of liquid which is mostly inflamed cells and protein that leads to pneumonia. The conventional way of COVID19 diagnosis is reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is less sensitive during early stages
specially, if the patient is asymptomatic that may further lead to more severe pneumonia. To overcome this problem an
early diagnosis method is proposed in this paper via one-class classification approach using a novel pinball loss function
based one-class support vector machine (PB-OCSVM) considering posteroanterior chest X-ray images. Recently, several
automated COVID-19 diagnosis models have been proposed based on various deep learning architectures to identify
pulmonary infections using publicly available chest X-ray (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) of corona positive
patients for early diagnosis, better treatment and quick cure. In these datasets, presence of less number of COVID-19
positive samples compared to other classes (normal, pneumonia and Tuberculosis) raises the challenge for unbiased
learning in deep learning models that has been solved using class balancing techniques which however should be avoided
in any medical diagnosis process. Inspired by this phenomenon, this article proposes a novel PB-OCSVM model to work
in presence of limited COVID-19 positive CXR samples with objectives to maximize the learning efficiency while minimize
the false-positive and false-negative predictions. The proposed model outperformed over recently published deep learning
approaches where accuracy, precision, specificity, sensitivity and confidence interval are used as performance measure
parameters.

1. Introduction
The SARS-CoV-2 is the most recently identified member of the coronavirus family causing COVID-19 [1]. This
respiratory disease started for Wuhan, China during late
December, 2020 and spread to all the countries worldwide
[2]. World health organization (WHO) declared this infectious disease as a public health emergency of international
concern (PHEIC) on January 30, 2020 as it reached to
more than 18 countries [3] and on Feb 11, 2020 named
this “COVID-19” and later, declared this a pandemic on
March 11, 2020 [4, 5]. After the ten months journey, this
virus caused over 37 million positive cases and more than
1 million deaths worldwide till October 10, 2020 [6]. This
disease is highly infectious and to control its spread, following three ways have been suggested as most desirable

preventive measures: social distancing [7], use of mask [8]
and early identification of infected people.
Till now, there is no best-known medication or vaccine is available for the proper treatment of COVID-19;
therefore to stop the infection the infected person must be
quarantined to break the chain of infection. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
is the best known method of COVID-19 diagnosis. This
came into effect after the rapid antibody tests showed unreliable results, because antibodies appear after 9-28 days
of the infection and by this time, an infected person may
spread the disease, if not isolated [9]. The RT-PCR test
is a costly and time taking process, whereas inability to
early-stage diagnosis and due to rapid growth of infections, medical experts are continuously trying to search
some other means of diagnostic measures.
SARS-CoV-2 virus initially affects the respiratory system of the infected person and in later stages, it affects
lungs that may cause severe pneumonia [10]. It is evident
October 19, 2020

that the symptoms of COVID-19 are extremely heterogeneous, ranging from minimal symptoms to significant
hypoxia with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
[11]. Like common flu, the common early symptoms of
COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, nausea, diarrhea, muscle aches, vomiting, headache, loss of smell or taste, sore
throat, etc. Statistics show that 40%-45% of COVID-19
patients remain asymptomatic, but the virus affects their
respiratory system silently resulting in severe pneumonia.
COVID-19 starts affecting the lungs as soon as it reaches
through the nose or throat.
Aiming to the diagnosis at initial stage; specially for
asymptomatic patients, chest imaging may play a key role
because the study shows that COVID-19 pneumonia is different from normal pneumonia and tuberculosis [12]. Although for lung-related disease diagnosis, chest CT imaging has been proven more effective, the CXR is preferred
because comparatively it is widely available, faster and
cheaper. Since, SARS-CoV-2 attacks the epithelial cells
that line respiratory tract, hence CXR image analysis can
help diagnose pneumonia, inflammation, abscesses and enlarged lymph nodes. Identification of COVID-19 cases
from other types of pneumonia and tuberculosis using CXR
images is a crucial task and objective of this research is to
develop a quicker way of COVID-19 diagnosis in presence
of a minimum number of positive class samples.
Biomedical image segmentation and classification via
machine learning algorithms have become admired areas
of research to make the existing healthcare system more
responsive and robust [13, 14, 15]. Concerning the same,
the computing infrastructure advancements make it feasible to apply the deep learning approaches for complex
biomedical image analysis tasks. It is evident from recent
research works that the COVID-19 CXR images patients
depicts certain abnormalities [12]. Deep learning architectures specially, convolution neural networks (CNN) are
found to be very effective and efficient feature learning approaches in the field of biomedical image analysis [16]. For
pneumonia detection a transfer learning based deep network approach pre-trained on ImageNet was proposed by
Chouhan et al. [17], whereas Wang et al. [18] proposed
a customized VGG16 model to classify different types of
pneumonia. Later, the importance of image augmentation
with CNN was demonstrated by Ronneburger et al. [19]
in presence of limited number of images. Afterwards, to
diagnosis of pneumonia in chest X-rays, Rajpurkar et al.
[20] proposed a 121-layered dense CNN, whereas Lakhani
et al. [21] proposed a pneumonia detection model based on
AlexNet and GoogLeNet along with image augmentation.
Recently, several deep-learning based COVID-19 detection techniques have been proposed using CXR and
CT images, where Linda [22] introduced COVID-Net, a
deep CNN based architecture for the detection of COVID19 infection in CXR images. Afterwards, Wang et al.[23]
achieved specificity, sensitivity and accuracy of 88.0%, 87.0
% and 89.5% respectively for COVID-19 identification using CT images. Recently, Punn and Agarwal proposed

the random oversampling and weighted class loss function
approach for unbiased fine-tuned learning (transfer learning) with various state-of-the-art deep learning approaches
such as baseline ResNet, Inception-v3, Inception ResNetv2, DenseNet169 and NASNetLarge. All above discussed
deep learning approaches have used pneumonia CXR images from different datasets [24, 25, 26, 27]. The limited
availability of COVID-19 positive samples may lead to biased outcome therefore, all the above discussed approaches
follow oversampling to build the model. The oversampling of medical images is not always a reliable practice
to increase the classification accuracy, hence this article
proposes a one-class approach for COVID-19 diagnosis in
the presence of a limited number of samples using pinball
based OCSVM. One-class classification techniques, specially one-class support classifiers (OCSVCs) [28] are found
more suitable for anomaly and novelty detection tasks [29].
In present research work, COVID-19 CXR images [24], radiological society of North America (RSNA) images [27]
and U.S. national library of medicine (USNLM) collected
montgomery country - NLM(MC) [30] are utilized for experiments to justify the workability of proposed model and
also used for comparison with existing deep learning approaches.
The identification of COVID-19 infection or pneumonia in CXR images is specifically considered as anomaly
detection task which is specifically one-class classification
problem, where the samples of only one-class are available
and other class samples are totally absent or ill-defined.
In the present research it is assumed that only COVID-19
infected CXR images are available, whereas other type of
pneumonia and normal CXR images are either ill-defined
or totally absent at the time of training. It is evident that
OCSVCs (support vector data description (SVDD) [31]
and OCSVM [28]) are suitable in such circumstances where
the negative class samples are totally absent [29, 32, 1].
For more precise results OCSVM has been extended under the supervision of pinball loss function [33] and the
proposed model is named as PB-OCSVM, which possesses
the following advantages:
• It is less sensitive to the noise.
• It’s computational complexity is nearly equal to the
conventional OCSVM, because pinball loss function
does not add any computation overhead.
• PB-OCSVM reduces to the original OCSVM when
pinball loss parameter tend to ‘1’, and thus OCSVM
could be considered as a particular case of the proposed PB-OCSVM.
• PB-OCSVM computes a hyperplane similar to original OCSVM.
In the rest of the manuscript, section 2 discusses the
recent research articles and section 3 describes the utilized
datasets. The proposed methodology is discussed in section 4 whereas the experiments and results are discussed

aspects are discussed in section 6.

with various abnormalities present in the samples. For
experiments, two different datasets have been used where
images belong to three different categories: COVID-19,
viral/bacterial pneumonia and normal cases. This article validated the suitability of the deep learning approach
via following performance parameters: accuracy, precision,
sensitivity and specificity.
In the same race of COVID-19 diagnosis, Khalifa et al.
[41] offered generative adversarial network (GAN) based
approach for pneumonia detection using CXR images while
ensuring the robustness against the over-fitting by generating more images. The dataset used for experiments
contains 5863 chest x-ray samples of two classes: pneumonia and normal, in addition the GoogLeNet, Squeeznet,
Resnet18 and AlexNet deep learning architectures have
been experimented along with GAN. This is evident from
this article that the Resnet18 along with GAN outperformed among other models. Further, Sethy et al. [42] introduced deep feature based support vector machine (SVM)
model for COVID-19 infection classification of CXR images. It is found that features extracted by ResNet50 outperformed with SVM compared to other models. Later,
workability of ResNet-50 architecture was proved by Bukhari
et al. [43] under three categories of CXR images: nonCOVID pneumonia, normal and COVID-19 pneumonia.
The experimental results show that this approach efficiently
diagnose COVID-19 infection from the other types of pneumonia.
As an alternate way of COVID-19 infection detection,
a customized ResNet-50 CNN based deep learning architecture named ‘COVIDResNet’ has been proposed [44],
where for robust, faster and reliable training, conventional
ResNet-50 is used along with different training techniques.
For experiments the input images are progressively resized
to 128 × 128 × 3, 224 × 224 × 3 and 229 × 229 × 3 pixels
and the network is fine-tuned at each stage with automatic learning rate selection, whereas the proposed model
attained higher accuracy with minimum computational
complexity. Later, Zhang et al. [45] proposed a novel
deep anomaly detection method for quicker and early diagnosis. To validate the performance of the proposed approach CXR images of two different categories have been
considered: COVID-19 positive cases and other pneumonia. To eliminate the data imbalance problem in the collected samples, authors proposed a CXR based COVID19 screening model through anomaly detection task [46].
Most recently, Punn and Agarwal [12] proposed a transfer learning based deep learning architecture for COVID19 infection detection, whereas to handle the class imbalance problem random oversampling and weighted class approaches have been used. The experimental results show
that the proposed approach outperformed other state-ofthe-art approaches.
From the above discussion, it is clear that all the proposed solutions for COVID-19 infection detection reported
till date work based on different deep learning architectures. It is known that every deep learning model is hun-

CXR images are always preferred for disease diagnosis
due to easy availability and easy handling of X-ray machines. As discussed in the preceding section, the conventional way of testing COVID-19 via means of RT-PCR
technique is a time taking and error prone process, specially for asymptomatic patients. Hence, the CXR image
analysis is claimed to be a more robust alternate way to
diagnose COVID-19. Concerning the same, several studies
(binary and multi-class classifications based deep learning
models) have been reported using multiple CXR datasets
[24, 25, 26, 27] for diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. The
objective of these studies is to develop a fully automatic
diagnosis system, because the manual analysis is time taking process and unable to serve the purpose due to limited
availability of radiology experts.
2.1. Deep Learning Approaches
In the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic, several organizations and researchers are trying to apply machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches
as quicker and alternate ways to identify COVID-19 infection on CXR images [12]. It is evident with deep insight into recent COVID-19 related publications that deep
learning models are capable to diagnose and triage new infections, that supplant the conventional testing methods,
thus helpful to reduce the growing burden on radiologists
during this pandemic. It is also interesting that there is
always a chance of infection while collecting samples for
swab test, whereas CXR analysis is comparatively safer
and easily manageable. Towards this objective, Kermany
et al. [34] proposed a deep learning approach to detect
pneumonia in CXR images with 92.80% accuracy, whereas
seeking the same objective in addition to classical image
augmentation Stephen et al. [35] proposed an efficient
deep learning model with 4 convolution and 2 dense layers, and obtained 93.73% accuracy. Afterwards, Saraiva
et al. [36] proposed a 7 convolution and 3 dense layers
based childhood pneumonia diagnosis model and attained
95.30% accuracy. Later, Liang and Zheng [37] proposed
a transfer learning based pediatric pneumonia diagnosis
technique with 49 convolution and 2 dense layers with
a deep residual network, and achieved 96.70% accuracy.
Later, concerning the same, Wu et al. [38] proposed a
pneumonia prediction model based on CNN and random
forest, and achieved 97% accuracy for CXR images.
Seeking to identify COVID-19 infection using CXR images, Narin et al. [39] proposed a deep CNN based on
ResNet50, InceptionV3 and Inception-ResNetV2 pretrained
transfer models. Later, Apostolopoulos et al. [40] applied
state-of-the-art CNN architectures for CXR image classification based on transfer learning approaches to deal

gry for data and consumes massive computing resources
as well as time. Hence a faster way of diagnosis process
is needed due to the rapid growth of COVID-19 cases and
limited availability of healthcare experts (specially doctors
and pathologists). Meanwhile, due to limited availability
of COVID-19 CXR images, class imbalance appears the
most critical issue that has been addressed by all recently
proposed approaches. Therefore, a more robust solution
is desired, capable of working in the presence of limited
number of positive class samples whereas the other class
samples are not present at all. Naturally, the diagnosis
of COVID-19 cases can be formulated as an anomaly or
novelty detection problem and with this notion following
are the contributions of the present research:

approaches is done with following parameters: accuracy, precision, specificity and sensitivity.
3. Dataset Description
In present research, CXR images of COVID-19 [24], radiological society of North America (RSNA) [27] and U.S.
national library of medicine (USNLM) collected Montgomery
country - NLM(MC) [30] datasets are considered for experiments. COVID-19 image dataset contains CXR images of
following pneumonia classes: COVID-19, MERS, SARS
and ARDS from multiple public domain resources available without infringing patient’s confidentiality (Fig. 1 (b)).
The dataset includes the statistics up to October 01, 2020
consisting of five categories of pneumonia such as SARSrCoV-1 (SARS), SARSr-CoV-2 (COVID-19), Pneumocystis spp., Streptococcus spp. and ARDS with metadata:
patient ID, offset, sex, age, finding, survival, view, modality, etc. For experiments other samples from COVID-19
infected images are considered as another class named as
‘other pneumonia’.

collection of 30,000 images chosen from the NIH CXR14
dataset [27]. Out of these samples, 15,000 images are
pneumonia infected and out of remaining 15,000 samples,
7,500 had no findings whereas other 7,500 had different
symptoms from pneumonia. Medical experts and radiologists annotated these images. A sample image is shown in
Fig. 1(c). Initially, this dataset was published with 25,684
training and 1,000 test images and later, the 1000 test
images were merged to the existing training set to from
26,684 training images whereas 3,000 new images were introduced as test set. For robust testing and comprehensive coverage of the comparative analysis, NLM(MC) [30]
dataset is also utilized that consists of 138 chest posterioranterior x-rays samples of tuberculosis and normal cases.
A sample image is represented in Fig. 1(d). Table 1 presents
the class summary details of the fused dataset resulting
from the above discussed datasets, which is utilized for
training and testing of the proposed approach. The fused
dataset is composed of 1214 posteroanterior chest x-ray
samples with classes labeled as COVID-19 (108), other
pneumonia (515), tuberculosis (58) and normal (533).
4. Proposed approach
From preceding sections, it is inferred that deep learning approaches are playing a decisive role in advanced
biomedical image analysis tasks. For the recent pandemic,
several deep learning based models have been proposed
and following key issues have been identified with these
approaches:
• These models need massive computation power to
train the neural network.
• Fails to work if only single class samples are available
for training. This phenomenon is the motivation of
this research.
• May give biased outcomes if the dataset suffers with
class imbalance problem.
The above issues have been marked as the research gap
and this research proposes a one-class based approach to
solve these issues. OCSVM (a variant of OCSVCs) and
the proposed PB-OCSVM are used as a one-class classifiers, capable of working with only target class (also known
as class of interest (CoI)) samples. One-class classification

problem is different from conventional binary and multiclass classification tasks, where only target class is well defined and the other class samples are either totally absent
or poorly sampled. In present research, only COVID-19
samples are used as training samples and the performance
evaluation is done in two phases: considering all COVID19 samples as test samples and considering other class samples as test samples. The objective of this research is to
maximize the learning ability in presence of limited number of samples while ensuring minimum false-rejection and
false-acceptance. Fig. 2 describes the proposed approach
where it is assumed that only the target class samples are
available. Initially, data preprocessing is performed to remove the noise from the images and then preprocessed
images are fed to PB-OCSVM for training. After training, test samples (inclass samples and other class samples)
are tested.

where for input image i(x, y), the mask is designed with
minimum and maximum threshold values defined as T hmin
and T hmax respectively. Even after filtering out undesired
information, there is always a possibility of uncertainty at
the deep pixel level representation [48]. To preserve the
original pixel value distribution, the adaptive total variation method [49] is opted to eliminate such uncertainties.

is also shown. It is evident that the opted pre-processing
approach is capable to eliminate the irregular intensities
while preserving the original nature of the pixel distribution.

4.1. Data pre-processing
Data pre-processing is an important step in the presence of heterogeneous samples. In this article, COVID-19
infected posteroanterior CXR images of COVID-19 dataset
are used to train the PB-OCSVM, whereas the other class
samples are used as test samples. To validate the performance of the proposed approach the other pneumonia samples from COVID-19 dataset, RSNA [27] and NLM(MC)
[30] datasets are used as test samples. The RSNA and
NLM(MC) datasets consist of samples of pneumonia and
tuberculosis respectively along with normal cases. It is evident that the CXR images in the aggregated dataset suffers with undesired artifacts such as varying resolutions,
pixel level noise, bright texts and unnecessary symbols,
hence pre-processing is desired for further analysis. To
overcome from the textual and symbolic noise, in-painting
is performed with the image mask generated using binary
thresholding [47] (Eq. 1), whereas image resizing is performed for a fixed size resolution of 331 × 331 × 3.

4.2. Preliminaries
This section gives brief description of OCSVM, variants
of OCSVM with different loss functions and Pinball-SVM.
This discussion will help to understand the formulation of
proposed PB-OCSVM.
4.2.1. OCSVM
One-class classification (OCC) techniques are majorly
used for anomaly/novelty detection; specially when the
negative class is ill-defined or totally absent. The objective of OCC is to maximize the learning ability using only
the target class samples. For unbiased operation of binary or multi-class classifiers, presence of two well-defined
classes is necessary; but if the test sample belongs to unknown class, the classifier may exhibit biased behaviour.
One-class classification techniques are proven as robust solutions to handle this problem and majorly applicable for
concept learning and outliers/novelty detection [50].
5

Tax et al. [31] proposed a novel OCC model termed as
SVDD, where the target class samples are enclosed by a
hypersphere, and the boundary points are called support
vectors. If a data sample falls outside of the hypersphere,
SVDD treats it as outlier and rejects (Fig. 4). The objective function of SVDD is defined as:
L(R, a, αi , γi , ξi ) =R2 + C

the maximal margin from the origin, whereas the negative
class samples reside in the subspace of the origin. The

where in feature space the data sample xi is represented
by φ and the outlier is penalized by slack variable ξi . υ
 (0,1] decides the lower bound on the number of support
vectors and upper bound on the fraction of outliers.
The dual optimization problem of Eq. 7 is defined as

where radius of the hypersphere is R, xi and a are outlier

controls the trade-off between the volume and the errors,
and slack variable ξ penalizes the outlier. With the Lagrange multipliers αi ≥ 0, γi ≥ 0 where i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , N },
the objective is to minimize R for reducing the volume of
the hypersphere to cover all CoI samples with slack variable penalty for outliers. By putting partial derivatives to
zero and substituting the constraints into Eq. 3, following

If the description value of a test sample xi is greater
than C then it is treated as an outlier. Kernels can be
used to reformulate the SVDD as follows:
2

kφ(x) − ak ≤ R2

where sign(.) is sign function.

(5)

The SVDD outcome can be computed as follows:
2

R2 − kφ(x) − ak

(6)

The output of Eq. 6 is positive for samples inside the
boundary and negative for an outliers.
Later, Schlökopf et al. [28] proposed one-class support
vector machine (OCSVM) as an alternate OCC approach
to SVDD, where a hyperplane separates the target class
samples from outliers as shown in Fig. 5. In OCSVM,
the samples of CoI are separated by a hyperplane with

Figure 5: Working of OCSVM.

It is observed that both SVDD and OCSVM perform
same with Gaussian kernel and origin plays a key role because all outliers reside there. Norm of the centre of SVDD
is equal to margin of a hyperplane of OCSVM in unit norm
feature space is [51] as depicted in Fig. 6(a). Thus, reformulation of SVDD can be done by a hyperplane as follows:
k φ(x) − a k2 ≤ R2 ⇔ wSV DD .φ(x) − ρSV DD ≥ 0

In feature space, the distribution of samples is represented by the sample margiin. Fig. 6(c) shows the distribution of sample margin of training data and hyperplane of
OCSVM in feature space. It is also observed that for RBF
kernel both SVDD and OCSVM perform equally, hence in
the present research, OCSVM is chosen for enhancement
with the help of pinball loss function.

(13)

4.2.2. OCSVM with other loss functions
For every machine learning tasks such as classification,
regression, etc., the loss functions plays vital role. Consider the training set S = {x1 , x2 , . . . xn } , where xi ∈ Rn
are inputs and target class y is defined as y ∈ {1}. Let,
f : Rn →
− R is a mapping from xi ∈ Rn to y ∈ {1}. During
training and testing the predicted output value of samples
is supervised by the associated loss functions.

where a represents the the centre the hypersphere. wsvdd
and ρsvdd are the normal vector and the bias respectively
of SVDD hyperplane and defined as below:
wSV DD =

ρSV DD =k a k

(14)

• OCSVM with hinge loss function:

In feature space, the virtual hyperplane passes through
the origin and the sample margin is defined by its distance
from the image of the data x as shown in Fig. 6(b). The
SVDD’s sample margin is defined as below:
γSV DD (x) =

a.φ(x)
kak

Like other machine learning tasks the hinge loss for
OCSVM [52] is defined as follows:
Hloss (zi ) = max(0, ρ − zi )

(15)

This unbounded loss function is capable to deal with
the shortest distance of the target class samples, but
sensitive to the noise. The hinge loss OCSVM can
be written as:

where y(x) is the image of data x in feature space and the
sample margin of OCSVM is defined as follows:
γOCSV M (x) =

• OCSVM with ramp loss function:

Because data samples exist on the surface of a unit
hypersphere, the maximum and minimum value of sample
margin is defined as ‘1’ and ‘0’ respectively as follows:

As described above, the hinge loss function is unbounded and sensitive to the noise, the ramp loss
function was introduced to OCSVM to make the
model more robust [52]. The ramp loss function is
described as follows:

Also, sample margin of unbounded support vectors xU SV (

where zi = wφ(xi ). The constraints defined in Eq. 21
are integrated into Hloss (zi ). The samples satisfying
zi = w.φ(xi ) ≥ ρ, are positioned above the hyperplane and no penalty is added, hence Hloss (zi ) = 0,
whereas samples satisfying zi = wφ(xi ) < ρ are located on the other side of the hyperplane and some
penalty should be inflicted, therefore Hloss (zi ) =
ρ − zi > 0, which says that if the samples move far
away from the hyperplane the penalty increases.

where zi = wφ(xi ). Due to non-convexity of ramp
loss the OCSVM problem is no longer a convex optimization. This problem is solved by the phenomenon
that the Rloss is actually the difference between two
hinge loss functions and the modified formulation of
the ramp loss OCSVM consists of the convex part
and the concave part. This new problem is solved
by “Concave-Convex Procedure” (CCP) procedure
[53].

4.3. OCSVM with pinball loss function (PB-OCSVM)
From above discussion it is clear that the hinge loss is
sensitive to the noise. To overcome from this problem and
to improve the performance of OCSVM, pinball loss function [33] is fused to standard OCSVM to obtain pinball
OCSVM (PB-OCSVM). This enhanced version deals with
quantile distance [54] that reduces the sensitivity to the
noise. After introducing pinball loss function, the conventional OCSVM can be rewritten as follows.

Huang et al. [33] introduced pinball loss into the
SVM. Consider the data points to be classified denoted by the set T . To solve the classification task,
w ∈ Rn and b ∈ R must be identified such that:

w φ(xi ) + b ≤ −1

for yi = −1

where φ(.) is a nonlinear mapping from the input
space to a new feature space. The optimal hyperplane wT φ(x) + b = 0, lies exactly between the supporting parallel hyperplanes given by:
wT φ(x) + b = 1 and wT φ(x) + b = −1

(29)

where ξ = (ξ1 , ξ2 , ..., ξN )T is a slack variable and
c > 0 is a penalty parameter. The parameter c de2

complexity to that of standard SVM. Note that the
second constraint of Eq. 29 becomes ξ ≥ 0 when
τ = 0, and thus Pin-SVM reduces to the hinge loss
SVM.

Huang et al. [33] derived quantile classification using the idea of support vector machine (SVM). It
has been shown that pinball and hinge loss SVM
have similar consistency property and computational
complexity, moreover the pinball loss SVM is less
sensitive to noise.

(27)

After employing the pinball loss function in Eq. 27,
following quadratic programming problem (QPP) come
into existence for Pin-SVM:

obtained:

other with a margin of kwk
residing on the supporting hyperplanes (Eq. 26) are
termed as support vectors. The classifier is obtained
by maximizing the margin. If the data points of two
different classes are not linearly separable in feature
space then to separate all the data points correctly,
pinball loss Pτ (x, y, f (x)) is introduced to allow the

4.3.1. Dual problem and kernel formulation
Now after introducing a kernel based formulation to
the PB-OCSVM, the Lagrangian with αi ≥ 0, βi ≥ 0 of
Eq. 31 is as follows:

Therefore, the complexity of the PB-OCSVM is equal to
conventional OCSVM, hence pinball loss function does not
increase the computation time of PB-OCSVM.

existing models have been proposed considering all four

other pneumonia classes as a single class that gives three
classes: COVID-19, normal and other pneumonia. Few
papers considered normal, Tuberculosis and other pneumonia as non COVID class that gives two classes COVID
and non COVID. For existing deep learning architectures,
experiments have been performed in three categories with
consideration of 4, 3 and 2 classes. For exhaustive comparative analysis, all cases have also been considered with

6. Conclusion
The objective of this research is to ensure a quicker way
of early detection of COVID-19 with minimum computational cost. All existing deep learning based approaches
for COVID-19 diagnosis work as binary or multi-class classifiers, and suffer with class imbalance problem therefore
need enormous multiclass data samples for unbiased operation. To resolve these issues, it is evident that all these
deep learning based approaches are using collection of multiple datasets and prefer oversampling strategies to ensure
smooth functioning. The COVID-19 is a newly known
deadly pandemic and precise characteristics are still unknown. Hence, oversampling cannot be considered as the
reliable suite to achieve higher diagnosis accuracy.
In this research, a novel variant of OCSVM is proposed
with pinball loss function to diagnose COVID-19 in presence of limited number of CRX images. Considering the
available COVID-19 positive CXR images, OCSVM and
proposed PB-OCSVM are trained and tested on in-class
samples and other class samples of fused dataset. The performance of one-class approach is compared with existing
deep learning models and it is evident that both OCSVM
