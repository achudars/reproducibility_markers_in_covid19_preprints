Abstract
Originating in Wuhan, the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome 2
(SARS-CoV-2), has astonished health-care systems across globe due to its rapid and
simultaneous spread to the neighboring and distantly located countries. To gain the
systems level understanding of the role of global transmission routes in the COVID-19
spread, in this study, we have developed the first, empirical, global, index-case transmission network of SARS-CoV-2 termed as C19-TraNet. We manually curated the
travel history of country wise index-cases using government press releases, their official
social media handles and online news reports to construct this C19-TraNet that is a
spatio-temporal, sparse, growing network comprising of 187 nodes and 199 edges and
follows a power-law degree distribution. To model the growing C19-TraNet, a novel
stochastic scale free (SSF) algorithm is proposed that accounts for stochastic addition
of both nodes as well as edges at each time step. A peculiar connectivity pattern in
C19-TraNet is observed, characterized by a fourth degree polynomial growth curve,
that significantly diverges from the average random connectivity pattern obtained from
an ensemble of its 1, 000 SSF realizations. Partitioning the C19-TraNet, using edge

1

betweenness, it is found that most of the large communities are comprised of a heterogeneous mixture of countries belonging to different world regions suggesting that there
are no spatial constraints on the spread of disease. This work characterizes the superspreaders that have very quickly transported the virus, through multiple transmission
routes, to long range geographical locations alongwith their local neighborhoods.

Introduction
Recent outbreak of COVID-19 has been emerged due to a new species of human infecting
coronaviruses (HCovs), namely, SARS-CoV-2 1 that was isolated from a cluster of pneumonia
cases in Wuhan, capital city of Hubei Province, China 2 in December 2019. It rapidly spread
across the globe and was declared as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern
(PHEIC) on January 30, 2020 3 , and was later declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020
by the World Health Organization (WHO) 4 . As of June 25, 2020, more than 9.1 million
confirmed cases, and more than 0.47 million deaths have been reported due to COVID-19 in
216 countries/territories 5 . The outbreak is attributed to a zoonotic transmission of SARSCoV-2 from primordial or intermediate host to humans, it could have further propagated
through human-to-human contacts 6,7 . Globalization of transport systems via air, sea and
land routes has resulted in drastic decrease in journey time alongwith an unprecedented
increase in transport volume of passengers. Although global transport has played a pivotal
role in world’s economic growth, it has also facilitated the disease causing agents to move
to remote and otherwise unreachable places very quickly 8 , and therefore has enhanced the
potential of any endemic to become a pandemic 9 .
2

In the past five centuries the world has witnessed several major pandemics, like, plague 10
(caused by Yersinia pestis), cholera 11 (Vibrio cholera), influenza 12 (influenza virus), HIV/AIDS 13
(HIV), SARS 14 (SARS-CoV) etc., that had badly affected most of the world population as
well as economy. All these pandemics had been originated in localized regions and had different means of human-to-human transmission, however, they were transported to distant
geographical locations by human movements via air, land or sea transport 15–18 . There are
many other emerging, reemerging infections, with varying consequences in terms of severity, morbidity, mortality, which the world continues to confront 19 . Different epidemiological
strategies, like, modeling disease dynamics, spread, mitigation and other epidemiological
parameters of different outbreaks have been applied successfully in the past 20–22 . Network
theoretic approaches have also been successfully utilized to gain understanding about the
topology of different epidemiological disease transmission networks 23–26 . Topological understanding of infection transmission networks provides us critical insights about infection
growth and distribution. Furthermore, knowledge of potential transmission routes allows us
to devise effective control strategies to contain infection 27 .
Due to lack of specific medication for SARS-CoV-2, non-pharmaceutial containment
based intervention methods have become indispensable tools to grapple with the infection.
A large number of studies are being published to investigate important metrics, like, CFR,
basic reproduction rate (R0 ), spread kinetics etc., however, a comprehensive study investigating the transmission routes of the virus across countries is still lacking. The actual
structure (topology) underlying the global spread of the SARS-CoV-2 is also less explored.
To prevent virus re-invasion in the countries/territories/regions (from where the virus has
been eradicated) considering large incubation period of SARS-CoV-2, at this stage of outbreak, it is crucial to gain insights about the short range human-to-human contacts as well
as long range geographically separated country-to-country global transmission pathways. It
may have implications in making SARS-CoV-2 prevention policies as well as better prepare
ourselves to fight against future outbreaks. In this study, we have constructed an empirical

3

global transmission network of SARS-CoV-2 and explored its topological space to explore the
mechanism of global spread of infection. Increased topological knowledge will provide us the
understanding about the epidemiological dynamics of the virus invading remote geographical
locations.

Methods
Network construction
In this work, we have constructed the index-case empirical global transmission network of
SARS-CoV-2 by manually going through the daily situation reports published by WHO,
government press releases of various countries, their official social media handles (facebook,
twitter), and other online news reports providing relevant information regarding the travel
history of the patients for a period of 84 days ranging from January 13, 2020 to April 5, 2020.
The transmission network is a dynamic network having the potential to grow on daily basis.
Countries comprise the nodes of this network, while infected index-case individuals carrying
the infection from a given country X to some other country Y connect these two countries
with a directed link with X as the source node and Y as the target node. The direction
of an edge indicate the flow of virus infection across borders. The connection between two
countries have been placed on the basis of travel history of the patient. Any foreign national
reported to be corona positive in any country has been considered as a carrier of virus to
that country irrespective of his home nation. For the countries reporting more than one
patient as their index-cases, if the reported patients had different travel histories we first
observed the timeline to find the countries in which virus had been already spread out and if
the the virus had already reached in the source countries then we placed a link between all
these source countries with the target country. On the other hand for the source countries
where the virus had yet not reached, we considered that the patient has contracted the virus
enroute and did not place link between them.

Stochastic scale free (SSF) random network models
SARS-CoV-2 or any other outbreak that spread through human-to-human contacts will follow a peculiar spread pattern where the infection starts from a source area and then gradually
spreads across other countries/areas/regions. To model this specific spread pattern, we are
proposing a novel algorithm, namely, stochastic scale free (SSF). SSF is developed as an
extension of the basic Barabási-Alberts (BA) model of scale free network. In the proposed
SSF algorithm, network grows stochastically over time with number of nodes and their associated edges both being drawn from an appropriate distribution. The algorithm follows
three basic steps: (i) The infection spread is unidirectional i.e. from source to target, new
nodes (targets) attach preferentially with already existing nodes (source) and have linkage
probabilities proportional to source degree. (ii) At every time step, any number of nodes
(0, 1, 2, . . . , maximum-nodes) can be incorporated into the network. (iii) Every node can
bring one or more number of links (1, 2, 3, . . . , maximum-nodes) with it. The key purpose
of stochastically adding both nodes and edges is to model the index-case of SARS-CoV-2
infection across various countries as a growing transmission network. In this network, the
index-case import in various countries may have two different scenarios, namely, (i) more
than one country can import their index-case on any given day i.e. more than one nodes
may be added at a single time step. (ii) a country can receive their index-case from more
than one countries i.e. an incoming node may have more than one in-degree.
The main characteristic of the growth of C19-TraNet is that initially very few new countries get infection so the probability of infection transmission to new countries at any given
day is very low, however, this probability increases very rapidly with increase in number of
infected countries. Therefore, while generating an SSF model of C19-TraNet, to obtain the
number of nodes and links associated with them at a unit time interval t (one day), we have
used beta distribution that is given by f (x; α, β) =

Γ(α+β) α−1
x (1−x)β−1
Γ(α)Γ(β)

where Γ is a gamma

function, and α, β are two non-zero parameters that control the shape of this distribution.
The scaling parameters at any time interval t were computed as βt =
5

Max -time−Current-time
Max -time

and αt = 1 − βt , where Max -time is the number of days for which the infection is to be
modeled (84 in the current study) and Current-time is the tth time step. On the other hand,
scaling parameters α = 0.05 and β = 0.95 were qualitatively selected to draw the number of
edges asociated with the incoming nodes. The small value for α and a high value for β are
deliberately selected considering a very low average connectivity (≈ 2.1) of C19-TraNet. The
maximum number of nodes (maximum-nodes) that can be incorporated into the network at
a discrete time step is given by maximum-nodes = hkin+out i + 1σ, while maximum number of
edges that a node can bring along with it was computed as maximum-nodes = hkout i + 1σ.
Values obtained were truncated to retain only the integer part. Corresponding to the manualy curated C19-TraNet, we constructed an ensemble of 1, 000 stochastic scale free random
networks having same number of nodes, and approximately same number of edges.

Global network metrics and community detection
Four global network metrics, namely, (i) degree (k) distribution, (ii) network density (ρ), (iii)
average clustering coefficient (C), and (iv) average path length (L) were estimated for C19TraNet and compared with the corresponding 1, 000 SSF random network models generated
via proposed SSF algorithm. The degree of a node is the number of edges connected with
it. In a directed network, the number of edges incident on a particular node constitute its
indegree (kin ), while the number of edges extending outward constitute its oudegree (kout ) 28 .
The in and out degree distributions of a network are defined as fraction of nodes having
k incoming or outgoing links. Furthermore, we computed the density of network that is
m
.
(n2 )
We also enumerated clustering coefficient for every node that is defined as the number of

defined as a fraction of existing edges in the network to the all possible edges i.e. ρ =

edges existing between first neighbors of the node i to the total possible edges existing
between the first neighbors, averaged over all the nodes i 29 . If Ni is the set of nodes directly

6

connected to node i then its clustering coefficient for a directed network is defined as

Ci =

|{ejk : vj , v∈ Ni , ejk ∈ E}|
|Ni |(|Ni | − 1)

, where E is the edge set of network G(V, E). Average path length of a network is the average
of geodesic paths between all possible pairs of nodes in the network 29 and is defined as

L=

n−1 X
n
X
2
δab
n(n − 1) a=1 b=a+1

. We identified communities based on edge betweenness, where the network is partitioned into
node sets by removing high betweenness edges 30 . We generated 1, 000 random realizations of
SSF models and Mann-Whitney U test was performed on distributions of average outdegree
obtained at different time steps for both real and random networks 31 .

Results and Discussion
The dynamic effects of heterogeneous communication routes has been central to the propagation of many diseases 32 , hence the interplay between them and the underlying transmission network of SARS-CoV-2 across different countries/territories/areas is the focus of
this study. We catalogued the first person diagnosed to have contracted SARS-CoV-2 virus
for 187 countries. By investigating the travel history of index-cases from government press
releases, their official social media handles and other online news reports, we inferred a
probable source (country where the patient contracted the virus) and the target (country
confirming COVID-19 infection in the diseased) of each edge to be incorporated in the empirical COVID-19 global transmission network (C19-TraNet). The constructed C19-TraNet
is comprised of 187 nodes and 199 directed edges specifying the route of infection transmission from the source country to the target country (1a). The final network is a combined
snapshot representing SARS-CoV-2 transmission across the countries that has grown over a

7

period of 84 days from January 13, 2020 to April 5, 2020.

SARS-CoV-2 global transmission routes
The outbreak originated from China (Western Pacific region) December 30, 2019 and within
two months (by February 25, 2020) the virus had been spread to at least one country of all
the six WHO regions. By the end of January, the contagion had been reported in five WHO
regions, namely, Western Pacific Region (45%), South-East Asia Region (40%), European
Region (13.33), Region of Americas (5.56%) and Eastern Mediterranean (4.54%). The numbers in parentheses indicate percentage of infected countries per region. Except Malaysia
and Spain, which imported virus from Singapore and Germany, respectively, all the other
23 countries imported it from China. Global transmission of SARS-CoV-2 can broadly be
attributed to two tidal waves, namely, (i) a Chinese wave, from the date of origin of outbreak
till the end of January, 2020 and (ii) a European wave that took off from mid February and
continued until almost all the countries got infection. The major reason for this quick spread
is, (i) emergence of China as an economic globaliser in past few decades that has increased
international business and trade, and (ii) expansion of highly connected local and global
travel systems 33 .
Travel data suggests that approximately 3 billion people traveled through trains or flights
during the Chunyun (Lunar New Year) holidays 34 . Also, a large volume of passengers have
been estimated to travel within 35 and outside China 36 through land and air routes from
previous travel data. These studies suggest a significant relation between transport volume
and likelihood of imported cases of SARS-CoV-2. Although ban was implemented in Wuhan
city on January 23, 2020, which was followed by travel restrictions to 14 of its neighboring
cities of Hubei Province on January 24, 2020, however, by this time the virus had been
transmitted to other Chinese cities as well as to 9 different countries belonging to four
WHO regions 37 . From these sources, the virus kept on spreading locally as well as outside
China till the end of January when the results of containment measures became visible
8

with overall decrease in cases exported from China 38 (diminishing the effects of Chinese
wave). Then from mid of February, second tidal wave took off from European Region and
circulated the infection to most parts of the globe. Italy, Iran and Spain were among the
super spreaders which aggressively spread the contagion. Owing to large incubation period
of SARS-CoV-2 along with lack of necessary infrastructure, sophisticated testing facilities,
herd immunity, a large number of undocumented asymptomatic or presymptomatic cases
passed undetected into susceptible populations of different countries/territories/areas, thus
provided unprecedented routes to virus transmission 39,40 . These large number of possible
routes also increased the strength of second wave by providing opportunities to circulate
the virus to most of the uninfected countries belonging to different regions. Therefore, we
may infer that a large incubation period, high movement and multiple routes helped global
circulation of the disease.

Global topological metrics of C19-TraNet
The final network is sparse with a very low density (0.01). This is expected, as we constructed
only the index-case transmission network. Average connectivity of the network is found to
be 2.128, computed by ignoring the edge directions. Average or characteristic path length
(APL) of a network represents closeness in the network, so lesser the magnitude of APL closer
the nodes are. The characteristic path length of C19-TraNet is found to be 1.56, while its
diameter and radius are found to be 4 and 1, respectively. As per APL, most of the countries
are infected by one or two transmission events. Network diameter suggests that most distant
country in the network is infected by a maximum of four transmission events. These short
path related metrics explain the quick global spread of virus, i.e. the virus got access to those
countries which have a wider reach on the globe that helped in propelling the infection across
the world in a very short span of time. Short APL and a very small network diameter also
indicate that there are some long range connections connecting distant geographical locations
bringing an element of small worldness to the network. There are some hub nodes (very few)
9

with a large number of edges in C19-TraNet. Plotting the degree distribution on log-log scale,
we obtained a straight line (with scaling exponent −1.63) indicating that C19-TraNet follows
power law degree distribution and possess the property of scale freeness (Fig. 1b). The power
law pattern of degree distribution has a simple interpretation that only few countries in the
network are responsible for spreading the virus to most other countries. It has been reported
that for any scale free disease transmission networks with scaling exponent less than 3, the
virus reproduction number (R0 ) is greater than 1 i.e. very few nodes (super spreaders) are
sufficient to maintain virus load in the susceptible populations 41 . Its main implications lie
in designing control strategies, like, targeting the super spreaders by implementing the basic
containment strategies e.g. prohibit transport, sanitization etc..

Global infection exportation potential (GIEP)
Emergence of a large number of countries in C19-TraNet as leaf nodes (having very low
average clustering coefficient) implies that the infection was not equally spread by all the
countries, rather only a few countries were responsible for its spread. We observed that only
38(≈ 20%) countries among 187 have at least one edge projecting outward. Among them,
only seven countries are found to have an outdegree of 10 or more, with Italy at the top of
the tally contributing a total of 47 exportation events followed by china (29) and Iran (16)
(see Table 2). Furthermore, infection import to every target node in C19-TraNet would have
occurred in two possible ways, either a domicile of the target country has brought the virus
from a source country, or a foreign national visiting a source country has spread the infection
to the target country. To investigate the proportion of these two cases in the global spread
of infection, we enlisted the nationalities of SARS-CoV-2 carriers and found that most of
the index-cases are local nationals who contracted the infection in some source country and
then brought it to their home nations.
A total of 131(≈ 65%) out of 202 index-cases were found to be local nationals. Here we
mentioned 202 index-cases because some countries, like, Kuwait, Aruba, Kazakhstan had
10

reported more than one cases on the same day (Supplementary Table 1). Remaining 71
(45%) index-cases were foreign nationals belonging to 22 countries. Among these foreign
nationals, 19 are found to be Chinese followed by 14 Italians (see Table 3). To estimate
the global infection exportation potential (GIEP) per country, we further normalized the
number foreign nationals belongiing to each of the source country by the total number
of exportation events (71) carried out by foreign nationals (Fig. 2). Above data clearly
suggests that although most of the infections are imported to the target countries by their
domiciles, however, a significant proportion of countries are infected by foreign nationals. As
an example, the number of virus transmission events (47) that took place from Italy is very
high, however, there were only 14 Italians involved in these transmission events. Thus, in the
light of above data, it can be inferred that highly robust and efficient transportation system
has played a huge role in spreading the infection across international borders. Therefore,
more caution is required specially from aviation departments regarding individual’s health
at international transportation junctions.

Connectivity dynamics modeling and analysis of C19-TraNet
Since the pandemic evolves with time, so exploring the connectivity of growing C19-TraNet
at different instances of time (t) can provide critical insights about the network topology and
growth mechanisms. Keeping that in mind we computed average out-degree of C19-TraNet
for each of the 84 days. Further, 1, 000 random networks using SSF model corresponding to
C19-TraNet were generated and average out-degree vectors for all these random networks
were computed which were further averaged to yield a single vector. We then performed
Mann-Whitney U test to verify the null hypothesis (H0 ) that the two outdegree distributions
(of real network and average of 1, 000 random networks) are equal, which is refuted by a
very low p − value = 3.041e − 09. Distributions of average outdegree per unit time (days)
for both real and average of SSF models are shown in Fig 3a. We fitted four distributions
viz. linear, logarithmic, exponential and, polynomial (up to order four), among which 4th
11

order polynomial curve is found to have the highest adjusted coefficient of determination
(Adj. R2 ) for both the real and SSF distributions (Table 4).
In the initial growth phase (i.e. till the end of January, 2020), both the curves followed
same trend, however, from February onwards a peculiar phase of no growth (for about a
fortnight) is observed in C19-TraNet which is absent in the random networks (Fig 3a).
This delay emerges due to implementation of Wuhan ban and can be attributed to the
border control measures including local and international travel ban, quarantine, symptom
screening at airports etc. simultaneously adopted by China and other countries. As stated
earlier, most of the infections in Chinese wave are disseminated from China, therefore the
two consecutive travel bans implemented by China substantially reduced the rapid local
and international flow of virus 42,43 . The second surge in average connectivity (starting from
the end of February, 2020) marks the onset of European wave which can be attributed to
passage of undocumented pre- or asymptomatic infected people from countries other than
China where restrictions were not that much strict 39,43 . Though the contagion invaded most
of the world, however, our model suggests that these containment measures have delayed
the global transmission of virus by 51 days. If the growth had continued to follow the initial
trends, the virus would have invaded South Sudan (187th country to be infected) on February
13, 2020. We obtained similar trend, in reverse order, characterized by a phase of no growth
for approximately same period when density is plotted against time (see Fig 3b). Network
density peaked when the network was very small. With the passage of time, addition of new
countries brought small increase in network size in comparison to the network order resulting
in an overall decrease in network density.

Community structure of C19-TraNet
We explored the structure of C19-TraNet by leveraging edge betweenness, in which high
betweenness nodes were recursively removed to identify sparsely connected ‘node sets’ (communities) whose members are densely connected among themselves 30 . Communities provide
12

an insight about the local connectivity patterns in C19-TraNet by partitioning the network
into densely connected, small sub-graphs. A total of 23 different communities (Fig. 4a)
were obtained with the largest set consisting of 39 countries followed by 16 countries in the
second community and 14 in the third set (Table. ??). Most of the communities were small
sized, while very few consisted of large number of countries (hubs), indicating that few countries (having high volume of international traffic) have acted as super spreaders. We further
grouped the countries into six geographical regions as per WHO, namely, European Region
(ER), Western Pacific Region (WPR), South-East Asia Region (SEAR), Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR), Region of the Americas (RA), African Region (AR) and enumerated
the country share of each region per community.
As shown in Fig. 4b, most of communities are composed of a heterogeneous mix of
countries from different regions. Most of the communities are comprised of countries from
more than one region among which larger regions (in terms of number of countries) including ER, RA and AR are the major contributors. Approximately 62% of the countries in
Community_0 belongs to ER followed by a relatively few countries of RA (15%) and AR
(≈ 13%) regions. Similarly, Community_1 is also comprised mostly of countries from two
regions, ER (42%) and EM (≈ 53%) (Fig. 4b). These results indicate that there is not any
kind of positional constraint imposed on the spread of infection, i.e., infected countries from
a given region have spread the infection to their neighboring countries (short range interactions) as well as across non neighboring countries or territories which are geographically far
away from them (long range interactions).

Summary and Conclusion
In this study, we have constructed the an empirical index-case global transmission network
of infection caused by SARS-CoV-2. Our main objective here is to develop a systems level
understanding of emergence and growth of COVID-19 from a local outbreak into a global

13

pandemic. To achieve this goal, we relied on the travel history of index-case patients obtained
from various reliable sources. It allowed us to map multiple transmission routes through
which the virus intruded into different geographical locations.
We observe that, after its origin in China, the global transmission of SARS-CoV-2 can be
attributed to two waves, namely, the Chinese wave and the European wave. Initially, during
Chinese wave, the virus invaded to a large number of neighboring as well as distantly located
countries from China due to a large volume of international traffic. By the end of January,
2020, the effect of Chinese wave started to diminish due to implementation of various border
control measures within and outside China. However, soon after a small stagnation phase,
the virus started to spread from other infected countries mainly from European Regions. The
main reason of this European wave was that a large number of asymptomatic patients (local
or foreign nationals) passed undetected to different countries and by the time we responded,
it had already victimized the whole world.
Topological structure of C19-TraNet is found to be sparse, however, its degree distribution follows a power law distribution, i.e., it possess scale free property suggesting that
few countries have played the role of super spreaders in virus transmission. Considering the
C19-TraNet as an evolving network, we further modeled the temporal growth of its average outdegree and found a delay of 51 days in virus transmission that can be attributed
to different border control measures. Data suggests that large incubation period, free flow
of international traffic and lack of coordinated action at international level in implementing
various control strategies have played a vital role in global transmission of the virus. Exploration of community structure of the network revealed that large communities are not
comprised of countries from a single region, however, they are heterogeneous composition of
countries from different regions suggesting the presence of local transmission, to neighboring
countries of the same region, as well as long range transmission to countries belonging to
different regions. These multiple transmission paths allowed the virus to rapidly invade susceptible subpopulations located in distant geographical regions. This conclusion emphasizes

14

the imposition of travel restrictions which although implemented, however, lack coordinated
actions from different countries. It suggests that a coordinated action plan is needed to put
in places to fight with any future outbreak.
The stochastic scale free (SSF) algorithm, proposed in this work to model the first case
global transmission network of SARS-CoV-2, can be implemented very easily to model other
human-to-human transmission disease networks with minor changes. The main advantage
of the proposed algorithm is that the probability of infecting new nodes changes with change
in number of infected nodes, that increases continuously until the network order approaches
saturation.
