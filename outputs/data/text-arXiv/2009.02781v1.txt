Abstract
Simulation models are valuable tools for resource usage estimation and capacity
planning. In many situations, reliable data is not available. We introduce the BuB
simulator, which requires only the specification of plausible intervals for the simulation parameters. By performing a surrogate-model based optimization, improved
simulation model parameters can be determined. Furthermore, a detailed statistical analysis can be performed, which allows deep insights into the most important
model parameters and their interactions. This information can be used to screen
the parameters that should be further investigated. To exemplify our approach,
a capacity and resource planning task for a hospital was simulated and optimized.
The study explicitly covers difficulties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. It can be
shown, that even if only limited real-world data is available, the BuB simulator can
be beneficially used to consider worst- and best-case scenarios. The BuB simulator
can be extended in many ways, e.g., by adding further resources (personal protection
equipment, staff, pharmaceuticals) or by specifying several cohorts (based on age,
health status, etc.).

1 Introduction
Simulation models are valuable tools for resource usage estimation and capacity planning.
They can either be implemented top down, e.g., using time-series approaches [Hyndman
et al., 2008] or bottom-up, e.g., using discrete-event simulation [Banks et al., 2001]. We
present a bottom-up approach: the Bartz und Bartz Simulator (BuBSim) is a discreteevent simulation model, which is applied to a hospital resource planning problem. The
project is motivated by the current COVID-19 pandemic. Health departments can use
1

BuBSim to forecast demand for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds, ventilators, and staff
resources.
Health departments are facing a very demanding situation, because the development
of the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown. No experiences about the required resources
exist. Health systems in some countries collapsed, whereas in other countries, no severe
resource problems could be observed. Resource planning is of great importance in these
situations. Unfortunately, if there is a new outbreak, no reliable data ist available.
To tackle the problem of missing data, we present an approach that relies on synthetic
data. It combines optimization and simulation techniques to build an adaptive model.
Our approach combines two powerful technologies: (a) Discrete Event Simulation (DES)
and (b) Surrogate-Model Based Optimization (SMBO) [Jin et al., 2001]. By combining
these, we are able to build a simulation model that only requires plausible intervals for
the model parameters. BuBSim has more than 30 internal model parameters which are
optimized during the simulations.
The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 briefly introduces the BuBSim model.
After introducing BuBSim, strategies for the optimization of high-dimensional simulation models will be discussed. Section 3 describes the experiments, i.e., simulation data,
optimization criteria, parameters to be optimized, and the algorithms. Section 4 discusses the results with a special focus on optimized parameters and sensitivity analysis.
The paper concludes with an outlook in Section 5, which discusses next steps.

2 The BuBSim Model
Law [2007] considers three distinctions between simulation approaches: (a) deterministic
or stochastic, (b) static or dynamic, and (c) continuous or discrete. DES is an approach
for modeling stochastic, dynamic and discretely changing systems.
The state of such systems is defined to be a collection of variables necessary to
describe the system at any time [Banks et al., 2001]. The term discrete refers to the
characteristic behavior of its components, which can be described as events: an event is
an instantaneous occurrence that may change the state of the system [Banks et al., 2001].
Between events, all the state variables remain constant. Benefits of DES are manifold
and range from providing insights into the process’ risk and efficiency to estimating
the effects of alternating configurations of the system. It helps to gain insight into
consequences of redesign strategies.
DES has been successfully applied to problems that model customers arriving at a
bank, products being manipulated in a supply chain, and the performance of configurations of a telecommunications network [Banks et al., 2001].
BuBSim models patient flows in hospitals and focusses specifically on COVID-19
patients. Each patient follows a path, i.e., after a state-specific duration dij , he moves
from state Si with a certain probability pij to the next state Sj . A graph can be used to
model this behavior (Fig. 1). For example, an infected patient (state S1 ) goes after d12
days with probability p12 to the hospital (state S2 ). With probability p17 , he recovers
(state S7 ) after d17 days without visiting a hospital. The probabilities of outgoing nodes

sum to 1, e.g., p17 = 1 − p12 . The BuBSim model used in our study requires the
specification of more than 30 parameters.

3 Simulations
3.1 Simulating Infections
Arrival times, as in queuing systems, were used to model the occurrences of COVID-19
infections. A Poisson distributed random variable was used to generate these events.
Node S1 represents the state infected, which is the starting point of our patient-flow
simulations. The Poisson distribution was selected, because it is a discrete probability
distribution that expresses the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed
interval of time. Furthermore, the Poisson distribution is applied to simulations with a
large number of relatively rare events. For the simulation of the infection process, we
assume that the infection events occur independently of the time since the last infection
with a constant mean λ. We considered the following setting: every day, on average,
four new infections occur. The simulation period ranges from the 1st of September 2020
until the 30th of November 2020, which results in a period of T = 91 days. In addition
to the “base” infection rate, we considered peak events, i.e., a larger number of infections
that occur during a short time period, e.g., one day. The variable ut is used to model
the infections at day t. The scenario is illustrated in the left panel of Fig. 2.

3

3.2 Model Parameters: ~xt
Plausible values from the literature were used as starting points for the durations dij
and probabilities pij to model the state changes. The BuBSim modeling framework does
not need exact values. The specification of plausible intervals is recommended, because
BuBSim tries to optimize the values of the model parameters (pij , dij ). Therefore, we
specified upper and lower bounds for every model parameter. The vector of model
parameters at each time step will be denoted as ~xt . The index t reflects the time
dependency of this parameter.

3.3 Ground Truth, Resources: Ri
The BuBSim model, as used in our study, models three resources:
• regular hospital beds (denoted bed)
• ICU beds without ventilation (denoted icu)
• ICU beds with ventilation (denoted vent)
Because no real-world data is available, we estimated the “ground truth” , i.e., the
observed resource usage, as follows:
1. Using the synthetic data {ut }, t = 1, . . . , T , we calculated the number of infected
individuals during a time window of two weeks. Let U14 (t) denote this number for
day t:
14
X
U14 (t) =
ut−i .
(1)
i=0

This is also possible if real data are available, because many institutions, e.g.,
Johns Hopkins University1 , publish their statistics on a daily basis.
2. The number of individuals, who are hospitalized and require a certain type of
bed is calculated as a percentage of the infected individuals. Let rbed , ricu , and
rvent denote the percentage of regular hospital beds, ICU beds without ventilation, and ICU beds with ventilation, respectively. These depend heavily on the
local situation. They can roughly be estimated from figures published by regional
health organizations. Then we can calculate the “ground truth” for the resource
allocations at time step t as follows:
Ri (t) = ri × U14 (t),

(2)

where i ∈ {bed, icu, vent}. The right panel in Fig. 2 illustrates the resource allocations over time.

3.4 Simulations
As illustrated in Fig. 4, the BuBSim simulator requires only two input parameters:
1. ~xt , the model parameters
2. ~ut , the number of infections.
Based on these two inputs, BuBSim estimates the required resources—in our case, the
beds, ICU beds, and ICU beds with ventilators, i.e., R̂bed , R̂icu , and R̂vent , respectively.
The simulation output, i.e, the required resources on each day t will be denoted as ~yˆt ,

Optimization Goals

Based on the simulation data, optimization runs can be performed to estimate reasonable
values. The optimization via simulation loop is shown in Fig. 4. The RMSE as shown
in Eq. 4, is used to measure the error of the simulator. We formulate a minimization

importance of the different bed categories can easily be implemented. In our experiments,
wk = 1/3.

Sequential Parameter Optimization

The Sequential Parameter Optimization Toolbox (SPOT) provides sophisticated statistical and machine learning tools for Design of Experiments (DOE), optimization, and
sensitivity analysis [Bartz-Beielstein et al., 2005]. It is based on SMBO [Bartz-Beielstein
and Zaefferer, 2017].
3.5.3

Optimization Results

To illustrate the impact of the SPOT optimization, we performed two simulations of the
patient flow. The first simulation used the default model parameters, which are based
on the plausible intervals. The second simulation uses the optimized parameter set that
was obtained with SPOT. Optimization reduces the RMSE by more than 25 percent
(from 9.16 to 6.81). The result is illustrated in the right panel of Fig. 3
3.5.4

Sensitivity Analysis

The regression analysis is shown in Table 1. Results from the regression analysis can be
interpreted as follows: to reduce the model error, the amount of days, i.e., x1 , until a
patient goes to the hospital, should be reduced. And, the estimated number of days (x2 )
until a patient leaves the normal station and recovers, should be increased. Furthermore,
the value of the shape parameter of the Gamma distribution, which is used to model the
durations (dij ), should be increased. Finally, x19 , the percentage of patients that need
an ICU bed with ventilation when they arrive at the hospital, should be increased.
In addition to the regression analysis, a tree-based analysis can be performed. The
corresponding regression tree is shown in Fig. 5. The tree-based analysis confirms the
results from the regression analysis, because the same variables are considered important: x1 , x2 , x16 , and x19 . Furthermore, SPOT offers visualization tools and statistical

4 Discussion
4.1 The BuBSim Simulator
We introduced a novel conceptual framework that allows reliable and detailed resource
planning for hospitals. To exemplify our approach, we focused on simulating bed capacities. The BuBSim model that was implemented in our study modeled three different
bed categories:
• hospital beds
• ICU beds without ventilation
• ICU beds with ventilation.

4.2 Synthetic Data
Most importantly, the BuBSim model can be run without any real-world data (although
it would benefit from it). BuBSim only requires the specification of plausible intervals
for the model parameters ~xt and infection data ~ut . Using the sophisticated optimization
toolbox SPOT, improved parameters are found. BuBSim allows the simulation of different infection scenarios to analyze both best- and worst-case scenarios. In particular,
this allows practitioners to simulate the impact of peak and superspreader events on the
bed capacities.

4.3 Validation and Automated Learning
If real-world data is available, e.g., from local hospitals, it could be used to further refine
the model. BuBSim allows easy integration of additional data sources. Furthermore,
SPOT and BuBSim provide interfaces to integrate dynamic data (data streams). Data
from online sources, e.g., Johns Hopkins, Robert Koch Institute, and others, can be fed
directly into the BuBSim simulator. This enables dynamic and continuous updates of
the model without any intervention.

5 Outlook
Comparability: To demonstrate the usefulness of the SPOT approach, a comparison
with other optimization tools is of great interest. This comparison will be subject of a forthcoming study, which will use a portfolio that includes optimiza9

tion approaches based on simulated annealing, Nelder-Mead, quasi-Newton and
conjugate-gradient algorithms.
Validation: BuBSim and SPOT can show their strengths, if real data is available.
Anyhow, even if this is not available, the simulation environment can be fed with
synthetic data and provide valuable insights into future developments (resource
usage for certain scenarios).
Extensibility: Further resources can easily be added. Until now, we considered three
different bed categories. In addition, different resources like personal protection
equipment, staff, pharmaceuticals, technical equipment (various ventilators), hospital facilities, etc. can be modeled. In addition, several cohorts (based on age,
health status, etc.) can be implemented.
Applicability: This simulator is specifically designed for hospitals, health departments,
COVID-19 crisis teams, decision makers in politics and many others. It is applicable to many different scenarios that require predictive planning.
