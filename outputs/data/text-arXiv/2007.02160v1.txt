Abstract
Due to immature treatment and rapid transmission of COVID-19, mobility interventions play a
crucial role in containing the outbreak. Among various non-pharmacological interventions,
community infection control is considered to be a quite promising approach. However, there is a
lack of research on improving community-level interventions based on a community’s real
conditions and characteristics using real-world observations. Our paper aims to investigate the
different responses to mobility interventions between communities in the United States with a
specific focus on different income levels. We produced six daily mobility metrics for all
communities using the mobility location data from over 100 million anonymous devices on a
monthly basis. Each metric is tabulated by three performance indicators: “best performance,”
“effort,” and “consistency.” We found that being high-income improves social distancing behavior
after controlling multiple confounding variables in each of the eighteen scenarios. In addition to
the reality that it is more difficult for low-income communities to comply with social distancing,
the comparisons between scenarios raise concerns on the employment status, working condition,
accessibility to life supplies, and exposure to the virus of low-income communities.

Background
In December 2019, a novel coronavirus called COVID-19 began spreading across the globe. To
fight this pandemic, the U.S. government issued a national emergency on March 13 and launched
the Coronavirus Guidelines for America on March 16, in which a social distancing intervention
was strongly suggested1,2. Accordingly, statewide mobility restrictions were successively
announced upon the arrival of pandemic. The first stay-at-home order in the U.S. began in
California on March 19 and quickly swept the nation. By mid-April, stay-at-home orders were
instituted across all but eight states. Yet despite the fact that it has been two months since the U.S.
declared the nationwide national emergency, COVID-19 cases are still increasing at an alarming
speed. This indicates that more effort on reinforced interventions is needed to help stop the spread
of this pandemic. Particularly, with a nationwide partial reopening of society, decision makers and
social practitioners need research basics to make better plans and adjust measures according to
local social and economic features. As revealed in earlier studies, the transmission of COVID-19
is positively associated with various social and economic factors, such as gross domestic product
(GDP) and human development index3,4.

Some studies have investigated different income groups during the pandemic and presented a
consistently obvious mobility gap3-7. It is noteworthy that disadvantaged people encounter even
more challenges under this pandemic. Research reveals that low-income individuals are under
increased pressure due to the threat of unemployment, poor working conditions, limited health
insurance, etc., as well as the stringent choice between health and income, which are both
significant to household subsistence5. Such a dilemma not only poses a threat to public health, it
also makes it more difficult to contain the pandemic.

In this paper, we specifically investigate low-income communities in terms of social distancing
behavior. Multifaceted social distancing performance metrics are compared between different
income groups, including percentage of staying home, miles traveled per person, trips per person,
work trips per person, non-work trips per person, and social distancing index. We aim to answer
the following questions. Are there any significant differences in these metrics between different
income communities? Which aspects of social distancing behavior indicate these differences?
Does income really have an impact on the communities after addressing the effects of various
confounding factors? If yes, how is the income influencing each aspect of behavior in terms of
significance level, degree, and direction? What are the differences between communities of
different income levels in their best performance of being social distancing? Which income level
communities made more efforts to achieve the best social distancing performance? Which income
group performs more consistent and long-lasting social distancing behavior? And which mobility
metric is most influenced by income?

Mobile device location data, an emerging data source for analyzing mobility behaviors, has been
actively utilized to investigate public mobility during the pandemic 8-13. With access to a high
frequency and large coverage of real-world mobile device location data, the authors were able to
quickly develop an analysis at census tract level. Various mobility metrics were produced at census
tract level using the previously developed algorithm. We investigated the response of different
income group communities regarding social distancing performance (i.e., “best performance”,
“effort”, and “consistency”). The temporal mobility patterns for different income groups are first
analyzed through Repeated Measures ANOVA and post-hoc analysis, which statistically indicates
the significant differences for pairwise comparison between days14-16. Based on the temporal

analysis, we then proposed the hypothesis that high-income communities outperformed lowincome communities in social distancing performance. This hypothesis is confirmed through
Welch's t-test and propensity score modelling17-19. Our study enhances the awareness of
discrepancies between high- and low-income communities and provides evidence to policymakers
regarding interventions on the pandemic. With partial reopening underway in all 50 states, our
paper can also guide the implementation of partial reopening policies.

Results
Temporal differences between income groups
According to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code section 45D(e)(1), we classified any census tract
with at least 20% poverty rate or median household income no more than 80% of the metropolitan
area or statewide median income as a low-income community. In this section, we primarily explore
the temporal patterns of the six mobility metrics of both low- and high-income groups. Fig. 1
shows the temporal changes from March 2 to April 17. It is obvious that both income groups
experienced two critical changing points, e.g., March 13 and April 13. The finding is in line with
our previous studies at the state and national level, which suggested that March 13 (the national
emergency declaration date) and April 13 (one month after the declaration) are two critical
timepoints for mobility metrics changes7,13. The week before March 13 is called an inertia period,
meaning the mobility change gradually bottoms out; the week of March 13 is called fatigue period,
meaning relaxed efforts of social distancing and mobility begin to rebound despite ongoing
mobility restriction orders. In addition, there exists notable differences between the two income
groups in all mobility metrics. Interestingly, the status between the two income groups exchanged
during the pandemic with regards to the social distancing index, percentage of staying home, and

miles traveled per person (Fig. 1a, b, c). The difference between the two income groups gradually
enlarges during the pandemic with regards to the three other metrics: trip rate, work trip rate, and
non-work trip rate (Fig. 1d, e, f). During the two weeks before the national emergency declaration,
there was already a difference between the two income groups regarding trip rate and non-work
trip rate and this difference was shrinking. On the other hand, after the declaration, the difference
gradually grows and the two income groups once again become quite different from each other.
Putting work trip rate into context, before the pandemic, the two income groups are very similar
to each other while there is a disparity between them during the pandemic. Fig. 1 also indicates
that on average, the percentage change for high-income communities is bigger than low-income
communities. Although high-income communities have a smaller average value of social
distancing index and percentage of staying home before the pandemic, they made more effort to
follow social distancing and therefore they have a larger average value for these two metrics
afterwards. Similarly, high-income communities’ percentage reduction in miles traveled per
person and the three trip rate-related metrics are obviously larger than those of low-income
communities. Under the pandemic, high-income communities seem to be at a lower risk of
exposure to the virus according to those six aspects of social distancing performance.

Fig. 1: Temporal patterns of six mobility metrics from March 2 to April 17 by income groups.
Each subplot corresponds to one mobility metric: social distancing index (a), percentage of staying
home (b), miles traveled per person (c), number of trips per person (d), number of work trips per
person (e), and non-work trips per person (f). The temporal changes of the mean value of each
mobility metric by high- and low-income groups are shown in each subplot. There are several
findings. First, both income groups share a quite similar temporal pattern and they have two
common critical time points: March 13 and April 13. Second, there is a disparity between the two
income groups in each mobility metric. Third, high-income tracts perform better after March 13
with higher social distancing index, higher percentage staying home, less miles traveled, less trip
rate, less work trip rate, and less non-work trip rate.

Moreover, with repeated measures one-way ANOVA (RM-ANOVA), we investigated the
temporal variation of various mobility metrics (i.e., number of work trips per person, miles

travelled per person, and stay-at-home percentage) in a statistical way. RM-ANOVA tests whether
there is a statistically significant difference between each pairwise day for communities in different
income groups. The results of both groups indicate that there is a significant temporal mobility gap
in all three metrics. Post-hoc analysis additionally demonstrates which time points are significantly
different from the others. Furthermore, we sorted census tracts based on their median income and
chose the top 200 and the bottom 200 census tracts for more detailed comparison analysis. The
results of three metrics for both groups are presented in the significance plots (Fig. 2), which reveal
the following findings. First, significant change of means at a 99.9% confidence interval, denoted
by the dark green cells, are observed earlier in high-income communities regarding the three
metrics. This indicates that high-income communities responded earlier to the mobility
interventions. Among these three metrics, high-income communities responded 10 days earlier in
terms of work trips per person and miles travelled per person compared with low-income
communities (Fig. 2a, e). Second, the behavior change took place more quickly and more clearly
in high-income communities, while the low-income communities reacted inconsistently in stay-athome percentage and miles travelled per person metrics. This is supported by the cleared pink
square observed in the significance plots of the high-income group (Fig. 2c, e). Another interesting
finding is that the social distancing behavior of high-income communities is more consistent
regarding all the metrics. After the behavior change stage, high-income people keep following
social distancing. However, low-income communities show more fluctuations in mobility patterns.

Fig. 2: Time course progression of three mobility metrics. These are the significance plots of
day-pair comparisons by high- and low-income groups. The disparities in time course progression
are observed for three mobility metrics: work trip rate (a, b), percentage of staying home (c, d),
and miles traveled per person (e, f).

Hypothesis testing and identification of the performance difference
Based on the preliminary results from the section above, we proposed the hypothesis that highincome communities perform better than low-income communities in three aspects: (1) highincome communities have greater “best performance”; (2) high-income communities made more
“effort” in social distancing; and (3) high-income communities have a higher social distancing
consistency. “Best performance” means the best experienced value during the five weeks after
March 13 in each mobility metric. For example, the maximum value of social distancing index and

percentage of staying home, the minimum value of miles traveled per person, trip rate, work trip
rate, and non-work trip rate are referred to as “best performance.” “Effort” means the percentage
change in each metric by comparing “best performance” with the baseline, which is the weekday
average for the two weeks before March 13. “Consistency” refers to the stability of the status of
following social distancing in the late stage of the quarantine, which is the fourth and fifth week
after the pandemic. The fourth week is the week before April 13, during which each mobility
metric gradually stabilized, as shown in Fig. 1. Then during the week after April 13, each metric
shows a rebounding trend. We use the standard deviation of each mobility metric during these two
weeks as the indicator of social distancing consistency. Based on those three aspects and the six
mobility metrics, we have eighteen scenarios in total to compare the high- and low- income
communities. The previous section gave us some insight into the difference between income
groups at the average level. Here, we examined in more detail through the corresponding
distribution by income groups (Fig. 3). Generally, the distributions of both income groups are close
to normal distribution and high-income communities tend to perform better based on the
distribution. As for the best performance, the mean of social distancing index and percentage of
staying home for high-income communities is larger than that of low-income communities, while
the mean of other metrics for high-income communities is smaller. This is consistent with Fig. 1.
As for “effort” (percentage change), we can see that on average high-income communities made
more effort since the mean value of the percentage increase in social distancing index and staying
home of high-income communities and the percentage reduction in miles traveled per person and
the three trip related metrics of the high-income group are larger than the low-income
communities. As for the variation, the high-income communities tend to have a smaller standard
deviation, meaning that they are more stable during the late stage of the quarantine period.

Fig. 3: Distribution of the social distancing performance by income groups. Social distancing
behavior is tabulated by three types of indicators (best performance, percentage change, and

variation) and six mobility metrics for each community. Therefore, there are 18 scenarios. Each
subplot presents the corresponding distribution by high- and low-income groups. In addition, the
mean value and coefficient of variation (CV) by income groups are annotated. A major finding is
that, in each scenario, high-income communities perform better than low-income communities.

Based on current analysis, we applied one-sided Welch t-tests to eighteen scenarios to test the
common hypothesis that high-income communities outperform low-income communities. When
comparing the best performance and efforts, the alternative hypothesis used for the percentage of
staying home and social distancing index is that high-income communities’ mean is greater than
low-income communities’ mean, while for the other mobility metrics vice versa. When comparing
the consistency, the alternative hypothesis used for all mobility metrics is that high-income
communities’ mean is smaller than low-income communities. The results for all scenarios are
summarized in Table. 1, which indicates the alternative hypothesis of sixteen scenarios are
supported at 99% confidence level.

As for the comparison of best performance, it seems that the means of high- and low- income
communities are quite close. However, the two income groups are significantly different for four
metrics including social distancing index and the three trip rate related metrics. On average, highincome communities achieve a higher social distancing index while low-income communities have
a higher trip rate, work trip rate, and non-work trip rate. Communities in high- and low- income
groups do not differ significantly with regards to percentage of staying home and miles traveled
per person. As for the effort (percentage change) of following social distancing, an obvious
difference in mean can be seen for metrics like percentage of staying home (high-income 138%

vs. low-income 117%) and social distancing index (high-income 182% vs. low-income 153%) and
such difference is significant at 99% confidence level. Although the two income groups show very
close percentage change in the other four metrics, high-income communities still significantly
perform better than low-income communities at 99.9% confidence level. According to the 95%
confidence interval, high-income communities are expected to have 21% more percentage increase
in the percentage of staying home and 28.5% more percentage increase in the social distancing
index on average. Among the four trip-related metrics, the largest difference is observed in the
miles traveled per person (<= -4.3%). In addition, the difference in work trip rate (<= -2.0%) is
more obvious than in non-work trip rate (<= -1.3%). Teleworking might result in a more obvious
reduction of work trip rate in high-income communities than in low-income communities. Since
non-work trips account for a larger proportion of total trips, the difference between the two income
groups regarding the best performance of work trip rate (<=-0.02) is smaller than that of non-work
trip rate (<=-0.06) although we see a more obvious difference in the percentage change of work
trip rate (-2.0% vs. -1.3%). Overall, high-income communities made more effort to achieve social
distancing. Furthermore, we compared the two groups regarding their consistency of social
distancing during quarantine inertia and fatigue period (the fourth and the fifth week after national
emergency declaration). During the fourth week, people’s behavior change to achieve quarantine
slowed down. Then during the fifth week, those efforts of being social distancing were relaxed and
less attention was paid to quarantine, which is indicated by the bouncing back phenomenon in Fig.
1. The standard deviation during these two weeks for each mobility metric and each performance
indicator informs us the consistency performance. The one-sided Welch t-test shows that the mean
value of variation of high-income communities is lower than that of low-income communities for
all six mobility metrics. Moreover, each difference is statistically significant at 99% confidence

level. After a period of mobility change due to social distancing orders, high-income communities
present a more stable and consistent status of social distancing.

Table 1: One-sided Welch t-test results for eighteen scenarios considering three types of
indicators and six mobility metrics. The alternative hypothesis of each scenario is that highincome communities perform better than low-income communities. For instance, the best
performance on social distancing index of the high-income group is hypothesized to be higher than
the low-income group; the percentage change of trip rate for the high-income group is
hypothesized to be smaller than the low-income group (since the percentage change is negative,
the smaller it is the better); the variation during the inertia and fatigue period of high-income
communities regarding any mobility metric is smaller than that of low-income communities. The
null hypothesis for all scenarios is rejected; that is, high-income communities perform better in all
eighteen scenarios. Furthermore, the statistical difference between the two groups at 95%
confidence level for each scenario is presented.

Quantifying the performance differences between income groups
Previous analysis is based on the average behavior of both income groups. Simply comparing the
average is not adequate to draw a conclusion. In this section, we additionally conducted a causal
inference of income on human mobility change. Since there might be some systematic biases
between the two income groups caused by the confounding variables, we specifically addressed
those covariates to strengthen the analysis on the income effect using propensity score matching
(PSM). When implementing the PSM, high-income is set as the treatment. Four covariates that
probably influence the income level (treatment) and social distancing behavior (outcome) are set
as the control variables, including percentage of people 65 and over, percentage of male,
percentage of Black or African-American, and percentage of people with a high school education
or less. A multivariate binomial logistic regression model is built to estimate the probability
(propensity score) of being high-income for each community conditional on covariates. Based on
estimated probabilities, the nearest neighbor method is applied to pairing high-income and lowincome communities. Therefore, a less biased treatment impact is measured 20 for each community
by the difference between the two counterfactual values. Then the average treatment effect (ATE)
across all communities and the average treatment effect on the treated (ATET) only across highincome communities are employed as measurements of the causal effect of high-income.

Table 2 shows that high income has a causal impact at 99.9% confidence level in all eighteen
scenarios and that high income improves social distancing performance in each scenario. First, the

treatment effect is positive for both the absolute value and percentage change of social distancing
index, implying that high income improves both the value of the best performance of social
distancing index under the pandemic as well as its percentage change relative to baseline. The
average effect of high-income on SD-Index is 4.858 across all communities and is 4.780 only
across high-income communities. In addition, the percentage increase of SD-Index would be
25.49% higher on average for all communities and would be 22.809% higher on average for highincome communities (i.e., if those high-income communities were low-income, their SD-Index
would be 22.809% lower on average). Similarly, high income contributes to social distancing by
making more people stay home. Although the t test does not show a significant difference between
the two income groups regarding the best performance of percentage of staying home and miles
traveled per person (Table 1), the causal effect analysis presents that income significantly
influences the best performance of both mobility metrics (Table 2). Regarding the percentage
change of the five basic metrics, high-income has the largest causal impact on people staying
home. The reason might be that more people living in high-income communities began
teleworking during the pandemic compared with low-income communities. Meanwhile, the
percentage reduction of work-trip rate is greater than that of non-work trips (ATE: -3.90% vs. 2.933%; ATET: -3.85% vs. -2.748%). This is probably because high-income individuals are more
likely to telework while low-income people are bearing higher unemployment pressure without an
option of working from home. Also, the less significant reduction of non-work trip rate caused by
income (ATE: -2.933%; ATET: -2.748%) indicates that the mobility reduction related to non-work
daily life is less influenced by income. In addition, with the impact of high income, the reduction
of miles traveled per person would increase by 5.547% on average for all communities and by
5.586% on average for those high-income communities. The impact of high-income on the

minimum value of work trip rate is marginal (ATE: -0.028; ATET: -0.026) meaning that the two
income groups share quite similar work trip rate during the quarantine period. Nevertheless, the
causal impact of high income on work trip rate is statistically significant (p<0.001) and high
income decreases the work trip rate by 0.028 trips per person on average. Additionally, 1.259 less
miles traveled per person on average across all communities would be expected if all communities
were high income. When comparing miles traveled per person, work trip rate, and non-work trip
rate, we found that the causal impact of income on the percentage reduction of miles traveled per
person is larger than that on both work trip rate and non-work trip rate. Along with the decreasing
trip rate, the travel distance is also decreasing. Accordingly, we infer that the travel distance of
non-work trips generally decreased more in high-income communities. Regarding the social
distancing consistency, high income shows promise for reducing the fluctuations of all mobility
metrics. That is, a more stable and consistent status is expected at average level if the communities
are high income. For example, high income is expected to reduce the variation of percentage of
staying home by 0.330 standard deviation for all and 0.342 standard deviation for those highincome communities. Residents from high-income communities show a more consistent and stable
quarantine behavior with regards to social distancing index, percentage of staying home, miles
traveled per person, trip rate, work trip rate, and non-work trip rate. Additionally, being highincome statistically accounts for this good social distancing behavior to an extent.

Table 2: Causal effect of high-income for eighteen scenarios considering three types of
indicators and six mobility metrics. For each scenario, the causal effect of high-income is
significant at 99% confidence level; that is, the high-income indeed influences the social distancing
performance from those eighteen aspects. The causal effect uses the average treatment effect and

average treatment effect on the treated. This measures the expected impact of high income. It is
concluded from all eighteen scenarios that high income improves social distancing performance.

The results above present the impact of high-income for each scenario. In order to compare
different scenarios, the dataset of each mobility metric regarding best performance and consistency
were standardized (rescaling the data to a have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1)
because of different units. The same PSM modeling procedure was applied. Again, the results in
table 3 show that high-income has a significant causal effect at 99% confidence level and this
causal effect improves the social distancing performance in each scenario. Furthermore, different
degree of such impact is observed when comparing the scenarios. As for the best performance,
high-income has the largest influence on the maximum of social distance index, the second largest
influence on the minimum of trips per person, and the third largest influence on the minimum of
non-work trip rate. During the quarantine period, high-income has a larger impact on the best
performance of non-work trip rate (ATE: -0.369, ATET: -0.350) than on that of work trip rate
(ATE: -0.198, ATET: -0.200). Being high-income is more promising to furthermore reduce the
extremum of non-work trip rate than to reduce the extremum of work trip rate. Regarding the
consistency, the income has a more obvious impact on the variation of the three trip-related

metrics. And the largest impact is observed on reducing the variation of work trip rate (ATE: 0.314, ATET: 0.291) during the quarantine inertia and fatigue period. Then the income has the
forth impact on the social distancing index, which is followed by miles traveled per person. The
least causal impact of income is observed on the consistency of percentage of staying home. The
difference between communities of the two income levels in the variation of percentage of staying
home is not as notable as that in other metrics.

Table 3: Causal effect of high-income after data standardization regarding best performance
and consistency. The causal effect of high-income is significant at 99% confidence level for each
scenario and high-income improves social distancing performance. Additionally, the dataset in
each scenario is standardized considering different units of mobility metrics. Hence, the results
after standardization can be used for comparing different scenarios with regards to the impact of
income.

Discussion
This paper investigates the disparities between income groups under the COVID-19. Due to the
rapid human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus, travel restrictions became a
particularly important way to help contain the outbreak of the pandemic. Although state and local
governments issued various mobility interventions such as school closings, cancelling public

events, and stay-at-home orders, seldom are interventions customized for communities of different
income levels. However, community infection control is of great importance to help contain
COVID-19. In order to assist policymakers with improving community-targeted interventions, our
paper investigated the mobility gap between communities by income level. The nationwide highfrequency mobility location data integrated from over 100 million anonymous devices on a
monthly basis serves as valuable data support for our paper. This enables us to detect the
differences between communities through real-world observations. We made the best use of this
dataset and produced multiple mobility metrics to conduct a multi-level analysis. We conducted
the analysis in eighteen scenarios featured by six derived mobility metrics and three indicators of
social distancing performance. A major finding is that high-income communities perform better
than low-income communities in each of the eighteen scenarios. Being high-income improves the
best status of complying with social distancing, improves the efforts made to achieve the best
performance, and makes the social distancing behavior more consistent and stable during the
quarantine inertia and fatigue period. This informs us of the reality that low-income communities
face under the pandemic with regard to social distancing behavior. When implementing mobility
restrictions, low-income communities should be given more attention. They need additional
assistance to fight against the pandemic. Furthermore, income has a larger influence on reducing
work trip rate than on reducing non-work trip rate. High-income individuals have more opportunity
to work from home while low-income individuals probably need to go to an essential frontline job.
This might also be the reason why high-income communities have a more stable and consistent
status of keeping social distancing during the quarantine inertia and fatigue period. By comparing
the causal impact of income on the percentage reduction of travel distance and trip rate, we infer
that the travel distance of non-work trips in high-income communities reduced more than in low-

income communities due to the pandemic. Different accessibility to life supplies during the
pandemic probably can explain this. It might be easier for the residents living in high-income
communities to satisfy their life needs without traveling so far away as low-income people do. For
example, low-income people may not be that capable of paying daily food delivery and hence they
have to go outside frequently to buy food. Regarding the consistency of being social distancing,
being high-income reduces the daily fluctuation of all six mobility metrics during the quarantine
inertia and fatigue period. High-income communities present a more stable social distancing
behavior. Additionally, among the five basic mobility metrics (the others except social distancing
index), being high-income has the largest causal impact on reducing the variation of the three trip
rate related metrics, which is followed by the travel distance and the percentage of staying home.
This indicates that being high-income is more likely to influence those people going out regarding
trips and travel distance while is less likely to change the proportion of people staying home. In
addition to stay-in-home orders, policies that specifically target low-income people’s daily travel
demands are also needed to help contain the pandemic.

Methods
Propensity score matching
In a causal effect analysis, the two measures, Average Treatment Effect (ATE) and Average
Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATET), are ideally used in randomized experiments. However,
in practice, many observational studies do not have a randomization process. In this case, the
systematic differences between treated and untreated subjects must be addressed to reduce the
effect of confounding factors21,22. Propensity Score Matching (PSM) has been popularly applied
to estimating the treatment effect in various observational studies, such as policy analysis,

pharmacoepidemiologic research, education, econometric studies, and accounting research 19,23-24.
In this study, a causal modeling is built using PSM to measure the causal effect of income on social
distancing behavior. To strengthen the impact analysis of income, a comprehensive set of control
variables is involved from aspects of age, race, gender, education, and population density. Those
control variables are believed to potentially influence social distancing performance and are
correlated with the income level of a community based on current studies 10,25,26. All sociodemographic data used in this paper is the American Community Survey data from U.S. Census
Bureau. The first step of propensity score matching is to address the systematic biases between the
two treatment groups (high- and low-income groups) by controlling the effect of confounding
variables using a multivariate binomial logistic regression model. With all control variables being
the independent variables, the model predicts the probability of a community to perform as a highincome community (the propensity score, the probability of being treated).

The estimated propensity score for all communities would be used as reference to pair each highincome community with its corresponding low-income community. The nearest neighbor method
is applied to carry out this pairing process. Given a high-income community, the community from
the low-income group with the closest propensity score value to that of this high-income
community will be selected as the counterpart. After the matching process, we have a set of highand low-income community pairs and hence the counterfactual values are provided by each pair.
Then the average treatment effect and the average treatment effect on the treated can be measured
using the equations below.

𝐴𝑇𝐸 = 𝐸(𝑌 − 𝑌 |𝑋) = 𝐸(𝑌 |𝑋) − 𝐸(𝑌 |𝑋)

𝐴𝑇𝑇 = 𝐸(𝑌 − 𝑌 |𝑋, 𝐶 = 1) = 𝐸(𝑌 |𝑋, 𝐶 = 1) − 𝐸(𝑌 |𝑋, 𝐶 = 1)

Mobility metrics generation
To calculate the mobility metrics, the research team utilized a data panel created by integrating
several mobile device data sources that represent movements of both person and vehicle. The data
has been obtained through various data providers that collect anonymized movement data first
hand. As the next step, we conducted thorough data cleaning procedures to ensure consistency,
completeness, accuracy, and timeliness of all observations. After data cleaning, activity locations
are determined based on spatial and temporal clustering of location sightings to identify home and
work locations at the census block group level. Furthermore, we applied our previously developed
recursive algorithm to extract trips from raw location points and produce trip information including
trip origin, trip destination, departure time, arrival time, and travel distance 12,27. All anonymized
devices that did not make any trip longer than one mile from home on a calendar day were
considered as people staying home. Finally, a robust multi-level weighting algorithm was applied
to expand the observed sample to the entire population at the national, state, and county levels.
The final results were extensively validated based on several independent data sources such as
American Community Survey, National Household Travel Survey, and also peer-reviewed by an
external expert panel27. A more detailed description of the methodology used for deriving the basic
mobility metrics can be found in our previous work12.
In addition to the basic metrics produced using the aforementioned methodology, the research team
introduced a social distancing index (SDI) to better portray the different aspects of human mobility
patterns using a single metric. SDI has been calculated to measure the extent of social distancing

practices by both residents and visitors of a geographical area as a score-based index. For each
region, a score between 0 and 100 is assigned by considering the temporal changes in five basic
mobility metrics, including percent of staying at home, daily work trips, daily non-work trips, trip
distance, and percent of out-of-county trips in comparison to baseline days before the COVID-19
outbreak. The weighting schemes for incorporating these five metrics were designed to consider
the importance of each metric based on both real-world observations and conceptual guidelines.
The theoretical basics of the formulation of the SDI metric has been described in detail in our
earlier work11.
𝑆𝐷𝐼 = 0.8 ∗ {𝑋 + 0.01 ∗ (100 − 𝑋 ) ∗ (0.1 ∗ 𝑋 + 0.2 ∗ 𝑋 + 0.4 ∗ 𝑋 + 0.3 ∗ 𝑋 )} + 0.2 ∗ 𝑋
Where 𝑋 is the percentage of people staying at home, 𝑋 is the percentage reduction in the number
of total trips in comparison with the pre-pandemic benchmark, 𝑋 is the percentage reduction in
the number of work trips in comparison with the pre-pandemic benchmark, 𝑋 is the percentage
reduction in the number of non-work trips in comparison with the pre-pandemic benchmark, 𝑋 is
the percentage reduction in the total daily distance traveled in comparison with the pre-pandemic
benchmark, 𝑋 is the percentage reduction in the number of out-of-county in comparison with the
pre-pandemic benchmark.
