The exposure and consumption of information during epidemic outbreaks may alter risk perception, trigger
behavioural changes, and ultimately affect the evolution of the disease. It is thus of the uttermost importance to
map information dissemination by mainstream media outlets and public response. However, our understanding
of this exposure-response dynamic during COVID-19 pandemic is still limited. In this paper, we provide a
characterization of media coverage and online collective attention to COVID-19 pandemic in four countries: Italy,
United Kingdom, United States, and Canada. For this purpose, we collect an heterogeneous dataset including
227, 768 online news articles and 13, 448 Youtube videos published by mainstream media, 107, 898 users posts
and 3, 829, 309 comments on the social media platform Reddit, and 278, 456, 892 views to COVID-19 related
Wikipedia pages. Our results show that public attention, quantified as users activity on Reddit and active searches
on Wikipedia pages, is mainly driven by media coverage and declines rapidly, while news exposure and COVID19 incidence remain high. Furthermore, by using an unsupervised, dynamical topic modeling approach, we show
that while the attention dedicated to different topics by media and online users are in good accordance, interesting
deviations emerge in their temporal patterns. Overall, our findings offer an additional key to interpret public
perception/response to the current global health emergency and raise questions about the effects of attention
saturation on collective awareness, risk perception and thus on tendencies towards behavioural changes.

INTRODUCTION

“In the next influenza pandemic, be it now or in the future,
be the virus mild or virulent, the single most important weapon
against the disease will be a vaccine. The second most important will be communication” [1]. This evocative sentence was
written in May 2009 by John M. Barry, in the early phases of
what soon after become the H1N1 2009 pandemic. In his essay,
Barry summarised the mishandling of the deadly 1918 Spanish
flu highlighting the importance of precise, effective and honest
information in the onset of health crises.
Eleven years later we find ourselves dealing with another
pandemic. The cause is not a novel strain of influenza, but
these words are, unfortunately, still extremely relevant. In fact,
as the SARS-CoV-2 sweeps the world and the vaccine is just
a far vision of hope, the most important weapons to reduce
the burden of the disease are non-pharmaceutical interventions [2, 3]. Social distancing became paramount, gatherings
have been cancelled, mobility within and across countries have
been dramatically reduced. While such measures have been
enforced to different extents across nations, they all rely on
compliance. Their effectiveness is linked to risk and susceptibility perception [4], thus the information that citizens are
exposed to is fundamental.
History repeats itself and we seem not be able to learn from
our past mistakes. As happened in 1918, despite early evidences from China [5, 6], the virus was first equated, by many,
to the normal seasonal flu. As happened in 1918, many national and regional governments organised campaigns aimed
at boosting social activities (and thus local economies) actively
trying to convince people that their cities were safe and that

the spreading was isolated in far away locations. For example,
the hashtag #MilanoNonSiFerma (Milan does not stop) was
coined to invite citizens in Milan to go out and live normally.
Free aperitifs were offered in Venice. In hindsight, of course, is
easy to criticise the initial response in Italy. In fact, the country
has been one of the first to experience rapid growth of hospitalizations [7]. However, the Mayor of London, twelve days
before the national lockdown, and few days after the extension
of the cordon sanitaire to the entire country in Italy, affirmed
via his official Facebook page “we should carry on doing what
we’ve been doing” [8]. More in general, in several western
countries, the news coming from others reporting worrying
epidemic outbreaks were not considered as relevant for the
internal situation. This initial phase aimed at conveying low
local risk and boosting confidence about national safety has
been repeated, at different times, across countries. A series
of surveys conducted in late February provide a glimpse of
the possible effects of these approaches. They report that citizens of several European countries, despite the grim news
coming from Asia, were overly optimistic about the health
emergency placing their risk of infections to be 1% or less [9].
As happened in 1918, the countries that reacted earlier rather
than later were able to control the virus with significant less
victims [10–14].
History repeats itself, but the context often is radically different. In 1918, news circulated slowly via news papers, controlled by editorial choices, and of course words of mouth. In
2009, we witnessed the first pandemic in the social media era.
Newspapers and TV were still very important source of information, but Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Wikipedia started to
become relevant for decentralized news consumption, boosting peer discussions, and misinformation spread. Today these
platforms and websites are far more popular, integral part of society and instrumental pieces of the national and international
news circulations. Together with traditional news media, they

2
are the principal sources of information for the public. As such,
they are fundamental drivers of people perception, opinions,
and thus behaviours. This is particularly relevant for health
issues. For example, about 60% of adults in the USA consulted
online sources to gather health information [15].
With respect to past epidemics and pandemics, studies on
traditional news coverage of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic highlighted the importance of framing and its effect on people’s
perception, behaviours (such as vaccination intent), stigmatisation of cultures at the epicentre of the outbreak, and how these
factors differ across countries/cultures [16–21]. During Zika
epidemic in 2016, public attention was synchronised across US
states, driven by news coverage about the outbreak and independently of the real local risk of infection [22]. With respect
to COVID-19 pandemic itself, a recent study clearly shows
how Google searches for “coronavirus” in the USA spiked significantly right after the announcement of the first confirmed
case in each state [23]. Several studies based on Twitter data
also highlight how misinformation and low quality information
about COVID-19, although overall limited, spread before the
local outbreak and rapidly took off once the local epidemic
started. In the current landscape, this has the potential to boost
irrational, unscientific, and dangerous behaviours [24–26].
On the other hand, despite some important limitations [27],
modern media has become a key data source to observe
and monitor health. In fact, posts on Twitter [28–33], Facebook [34], and Reddit [35, 36], page views in Wikipedia [37,
38] and searches on Google [39, 40] have been used to study,
nowcast and predict the spreading of infectious diseases as well
as the prevalence of noncommunicable illnesses. Therefore, in
the current full-fledged digital society, information is not only
key to inform people’s behaviour but can be used to develop
an unprecedented understanding of such behaviours, as well as
of the phenomena driving them.
The context where COVID-19 is unfolding is thus very heterogeneous and complex. Traditional and social media are
integral parts of our perception and opinions, have the potential
to trigger behaviour change and thus influence the pandemic
spreading. Such complex landscape must be characterized in
order to understand the public attention and response to media
coverage. Here, we tackle this challenge by assembling an heterogeneous dataset which includes 227, 768 news and 13, 448
YouTube videos published by traditional media, 278, 456, 892
views of topical Wikipedia pages, 107, 898 submissions and
3, 829, 309 comments from 417, 541 distinct users on Reddit, as well as epidemic data in four different countries: Italy,
United Kingdom, United States, and Canada.
First, we explore how media coverage and epidemic progression influence public attention and response. To achieve
this, we analyze news volume and COVID-19 incidence with
respect to Wikipedia page views volume and Reddit comments.
Our results show that public attention and response are mostly
driven by media coverage rather than disease spreading. Furthermore, we observe typical saturation and memory effects
of public collective attention. Moreover, using an unsupervised topic modeling approach, we explore the different topics
framed in traditional media and in Reddit discussions. We
show that, while attentions of news outlets and online users

towards different topics are in good accordance, interesting
deviations emerge in their temporal patterns. Also, we highlight that, at the end of our observation period, general interest
grows towards topics about the resumption of activities after
lockdown, the search for a vaccine against Sars-Cov-2, acquired immunity and antibodies tests.
Overall, the research presented here offers insights to interpret public perception/response to the current global health
emergency, raises interrogatives about the effects of attention
saturation on collective awareness, risk perception and thus on
tendencies towards behavioural changes.
II.

IMPACT OF MEDIA COVERAGE AND EPIDEMIC
PROGRESSION ON COLLECTIVE ATTENTION

How is collective attention shaped by news media coverage
and epidemic progression? To tackle this important question,
we collected an heterogeneous dataset that includes COVID19 related news articles and Youtube videos published online
by mainstream information media, relevant posts and relative
discussion of geolocalized Reddit users, and country-specific
views to Wikipedia pages related to COVID-19 for Italy, United
Kingdom, United States and Canada (see subsections A, B,
C of Methods and Materials for details). This choice aims to
provide an overview of media coverage and a proxy of public
attention and response. On the one hand, the study of news articles and videos allows us to estimate the exposure of the public
to COVID-19 pandemic in traditional news media. On the
other hand, the study of users discussions and response on social media (through Reddit) and information seeking (through
Wikipedia page views) allows us to quantify the reaction of individuals to both the COVID-19 pandemic and news exposure.
As mentioned in the introduction, previous studies showed the
usefulness of social media, internet use and search trends to
analyze health-related information streams and monitor public
reaction to infectious diseases [41–45].
Hence, we consider volume of comments of geolocalized
users on the subreddit /r/Coronavirus1 to explore the public
discussion in reaction to media covering the epidemic in the
various countries, while we consider the number of views of
relevant Wikipedia pages about COVID-19 pandemic to quantify users interest. It is important to stress how Reddit and
Wikipedia provide different aspects of online users behaviour
and collective response. In fact, while Reddit posts can be
regarded as a general indicator of the online discussion surrounding the global health emergency, the number of access
to COVID-19 related Wikipedia pages is a proxy of health information seeking behaviour (HISB). HISB is the act through
which individuals retrieve and acquire new knowledge about
a specific topic related to health [46, 47], and it is likely to be
triggered on a population scale by a disrupting event, such as
the threaten of a previously unknown disease [48, 49].

Subreddits are user-created areas of interest where discussions are organized
in Reddit. /r/Coronavirus is the subreddit related to discussions surrounding
COVID-19 pandemic

3

Figure 1:
Normalized weekly volume of news articles and
Youtube videos (news)), Reddit comments (reddit), Wikipedia views
(wikipedia) related to COVID-19 pandemic and COVID-19 incidence
(covid inc.) in different countries.

Our analysis starts by comparing, in Figure 1, the weekly
volume of news and videos published on Youtube, Wikipedia
views, and Reddit comments of geolocalized users in comparison with the weekly COVID-19 incidence in the four countries
considered. It can be seen how, as COVID-19 spreads, both
media coverage and public interest grow in time. However,
public attention, quantified by the number of Reddit comments
and Wikipedia views, sharply decreases after reaching a peak,
despite the volume of news and COVID-19 incidence remaining high. Furthermore, the peak in public attention consistently anticipates the maximum media exposure and maximum
COVID-19 incidence.
The correlation between media coverage, public attention,
and the epidemic progression is quantified more in details in
Figure 2. The plot shows that news coverage of each country
is strongly correlated with COVID-19 incidence (both global
and domestic), and slightly less with the volume of Reddit
comments and Wikipedia views, which, in turn, are much
less correlated with COVID-19 incidence (both global and domestic). This holds for all countries under consideration and
highlights how the disease spreading triggers media coverage,
and how the public response is more likely driven by such news
exposure in each country rather than COVID-19 progression.
Beyond these observations, it is interesting to notice from Figure 2 that Italy is the only country where news volume shows
higher correlation with domestic rather than global incidence.
This suggests that Italian media coverage follows more closely
the internal evolution rather than the global one, at odds with
respect to other countries. This is probably due to Italy being
the location of the first COVID-19 outbreak outside Asia.
This observation is supported by Figure 3, showing the citation share of Italian locations by Italian news media, before
and after the first COVID-19 death was confirmed in Italy
on 2020/02/20. After this date, Italian locations represent
about 74% of all places cited by Italian media (in our dataset),
with an increase of 45% with respect to the same statistics
calculated before. Similar effects, though generally less intense, can be observed also in the other countries. Therefore,

Figure 2: Country specific Pearson correlation coefficients between:
1) news coverage and global/domestic COVID-19 incidence, volumes
of Reddit comments and Wikipedia views; 2) global COVID-19 incidence and volumes of Reddit comments and Wikipedia views; 3)
domestic COVID-19 incidence and volumes of Reddit comments and
Wikipedia views.

while media coverage is generally well synchronized with the
global COVID-19 incidence, the media attention gradually
shifts towards the internal evolution of the pandemic as soon as
domestic outbreaks erupt. Arguably, this may have played an
important role in individual risk perception. We can speculate
that re-framing the emergency within a national dimension had
the potential to amplify the perceived susceptibility of individuals [50, 51] and thus increase the adoption of behavioural
changes [4, 52]. Indeed, previous studies showed how at the
beginning of February 2020 people were overly optimistic regarding the risks associated with the new virus circulating in
Asia, and how their perception sharply changed after first cases
were confirmed in their countries [9, 53].
To explore more systematically the relationship between
media coverage, public attention and epidemic progression, we
consider a linear regression model to nowcast, separately for
each country, collective public attention (quantified with the
number of comments by geolocalized Reddit users or visits to
relevant Wikipedia pages) given the volume of media coverage or the COVID-19 incidence as independent variables. We
include also “memory effects” in the public attention by considering an exponential decaying term in the news time series
[22] (see subsection D of Methods and Materials for details).
We compare the three models, where the independent variable(s) are the domestic incidence, the news volume, the news
volume plus a memory term, by using the Akaike Information
Criterion (AIC) [54] and coefficient of determination (R2 ). We
found that the model considering only COVID-19 incidence
has much less predictive power than the ones considering me-

dia coverage (see Table II in Methods and Material). This
enforces the idea that collective attention is mainly driven by
media coverage rather than COVID-19 incidence. In addition,
we found that including memory effects improves significantly
the model performance. Not surprisingly, the coefficients of
the “memory effects” term reported in Table I are negative
for all countries. This implies that public attention actually
saturates in response to news exposure and gives us the chance
to quantify the rate at which this phenomenon happens.
The results presented so far are in very good accordance with
findings obtained in previous contexts related to epidemics and
pandemics. Indeed, a similar media-driven spiky unfolding of
public attention, measured through the information seeking and
public discussions of online users, has been observed during
the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic [57, 58], the 2016 Zika
outbreak [59], the seasonal flu [60] and during more localized
public health emergency such as the 2013 measles outbreak
in Netherlands [61]. Our findings confirm the central role of
media, showing how media exposure is capable of shaping and
driving collective attention during a national and global health
emergency.
Media exposure is an important factor that can influence
individual risk perception as well [62–64]. The timing and
framing of the information disseminated by media can actually
modulate the attention and ultimately the behaviour of individuals [2]. This becomes an even greater concern in a context
where the most effective strategy to fight the spreading are
containment measures based on individuals’ behaviour. For
this reason, in the next section we characterize media coverage
and online users response more specifically in terms of content
produced and consumed.

DYNAMICS OF CONTENT PRODUCTION AND
CONSUMPTION

While collective attention and media coverage are well correlated in terms of volume, the content and topics discussed
by media and consumed by online users may not be as synchronized [65, 66]. To shed light on this issue, we adopt an
unsupervised topic modeling approach to extract prevalent topics in the news articles mentioned and discussed on Reddit.
Often, indeed, users on Reddit post a submission containing a
news article, and discussion unfolds in comments under such
submission. Differently from the first part and to provide a
comprehensive overview of the topics discussed, here we do
not take into account any geographical context. Nonetheless, in
the Supplementary Information we provide some insights also
on the specific topics discussed by users in different countries.
We characterize the main topics discussed on Reddit by considering all submissions that include a news article in English.
We then apply a topic modelling approach on the content of
this news article set. Specifically, we extract topics by means
of non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) [67], a popular
method for this kind of tasks (see subsection E of Methods
and Materials for details). In this way, we extract the n = 64
most relevant topics in the news shared on Reddit. As a second
step, we apply the model trained on the Reddit news to the set
of articles published by mainstream media. That is, we characterize the news published by media in terms of the topics
discussed on Reddit. This choice allows us to directly compare
the topics covered by media with the public discussion around
such news exposure. A complete list of the 64 topics extracted
with the most frequent words is provided in the Supplementary
Information.
We consider the number of articles published on a certain
topic as a proxy of general interest of traditional media towards
it, while we measure the collective interest of Reddit users by
the number of comments under the news articles on a specific
topic. Figure 4 shows an overview of the topics extracted and
a comparison of the interest of media and Reddit users. We
find a diverse and heterogeneous set of topics. Among others,
we recognize topics about the global spreading of the virus
(Outbreaks, WHO, CDC), COVID-19 symptoms, treatment,
hospitals and care facilities (Symptoms, Medical Treatment,
Medical Staff, Care Facilities), the economic impact of the pandemic and responses from the governments to the upcoming
crisis (Economy, Money), different societal aspects (Sports,
Religious Services, Education), and also the possible interven-

(Y-axis) coordinate indicates when the topic achieved 50% of its
relevance in news outlets (Reddit) during our analysis interval.

tions to mitigate the spreading of the virus (Face Masks, Social
Distancing, Tests, Vaccine).
Overall, the attention of traditional media and Reddit users
towards different topics are in good accordance. Indeed, in
Figure 4 we represent the difference between interest share
towards different topics in media and Reddit submissions. That
is, we compute the percentage share of attention dedicated by
news outlets and Reddit users to each topic, and we subtract
these two quantities. We observe a maximum absolute mismatch in interest share of 2.61%. Nonetheless, we observe that
Reddit users are slightly more interested to topics regarding
health (Symptoms, Medical Treatment), non-pharmaceutical
interventions and personal protective equipment (Social Distancing, Face Masks), studies and information on the epidemic
(Research, Surveys, Santa Clara Study, CDC), and also to specific public figures such as Anthony Fauci. Interestingly, the
Santa Clara Study topic refers to the discussion about a controversial scientific paper suggesting that a much higher fraction

of the population in the Santa Clara County was infected respect to what originally thought [68]. Since the study suggests
a lower mortality rate, the preprint has been quickly leveraged
to support protest against lockdowns2 , while substantial flaws
have been detected in the scientific methodology of the paper 3 .
The topics overview presented so far does not take into account any temporal dynamics of interest. However, topics
showing a similar overall statistics may present a mismatch
in temporal patterns. Hence, in the following, we take into
account the temporal evolution of interest towards different
topics. In Figure 5 we represent each topic as a single point: its
x-coordinate (y-coordinate) indicates when such topic reached
50% of its total relevance in news outlets (on Reddit) during the analysis interval (see subsection E of Methods and
Materials for a formal definition of the relevance of a topic).
Therefore, topics at the bottom left became relevant very early
in the public discussion. Among these, we recognize themes
centred on early COVID-19 outbreaks (i.e., Chinese, Japanese,
Iranian and Italian outbreaks), the events related to cruise ships,
specific countries (i.e., Israel, Singapore and Malaysia), and
also topics regarding (early) health issues such as Symptoms,
Confirmed Cases and the CDC.
On the contrary, topics in the top right became relevant
toward the end of the analysis interval (early May). Reasonably, we find here topics about the resumption of activities
after lockdown (i.e. Reopening), the feasibility and timing
of a possible vaccine against Sars-Cov-2 (i.e. Vaccine), and
discussions regarding acquired immunity and antibodies tests
(i.e. Immunity). In-between, we find all other topics clustered

6
around end of March and mid-April 2020, the period when the
general discussion surrounding COVID-19 pandemic aroused
sharply, as also shown in Figure 1.
Note that the diagonal (plotted as a dashed line) in Figure 5 separates topics according to their temporal evolution.
Above (below) the diagonal, we find topics whose interest on
Reddit grows slowly (quickly) with respect to the media coverage. Therefore, above the diagonal the interest of Reddit
users is mainly triggered by media exposure, while below it
the interest grows faster and declines rapidly despite sustained
media exposure. While the top-left and bottom-right regions
are empty, indicating that, as a first approximation, temporal
patterns of attention by traditional media and Reddit users
are well-synchronized, interesting deviations from the diagonal are observable. For example, above the diagonal one can
find mainly topics related to various outbreaks, economics and
politics, for which the interests on Reddit follows the media
coverage. Below the diagonal, we observe topics more related
to everyday life, such as Schools, Medical Staff, Care Facilities,
and Lockdown, for which the attention on Reddit accelerates
with respect to media coverage, and then declines rapidly. Note
that our view of topics discussed on Reddit is limited, since we
only consider topics from news articles shared in submissions
and do not explicitly take into account content expressed in
comments. This ensures a proper comparison with topics extracted from news published and explains the absence of points
in the bottom right corner of Figure 5.

IV.

CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we characterized the response of online users
to both media coverage and COVID-19 pandemic progression.
As a first step, we focused on the impact of media coverage on
collective attention in different countries, characterized as volumes of country-specific Wikipedia pages views and comments
of geolocalized Reddit users. We showed that collective attention was mainly driven by media coverage rather than epidemic
progression, rapidly saturated, and decreased despite media
coverage and COVID-19 incidence remaining high. This trend
is very similar to that observed during other outbreaks [57–61].
Also, we showed how media coverage sharply shifted to the
domestic situation as soon as the first death was confirmed in
the home country, discussing the implications for re-shaping
individuals perception of risk [9, 53].
As a second step, we focused on the dynamics of content
production and consumption. We modeled topics published
in mainstream media and discussed on Reddit, showing that
Reddit users were generally more interested in health, data
regarding the new disease, and interventions needed to halt
the spreading with respect to media exposure. By taking into
account the dynamics of topics extracted, we show that, while
their temporal patterns are generally synchronized, the public
attention for topics related to politics and economics is mainly
triggered by media exposure, while the interests for topics
more related to daily life accelerates on Reddit with respect to
media coverage.
Of course, our research comes with limitations. First, we

characterized the exposure of individuals to COVID-19 pandemic by considering only news articles and Youtube videos
published online by major news outlets. However, individuals
are also exposed to relevant information through other channels, with television on top of these [69]. Second, a 2013 Pew
Internet Study found that Reddit users are more likely young
males [70], showing that around 15% of male internet users
aged between 18 and 29 declare to use Reddit, compared to the
5% of women in the same age range and to the 8% of men aged
between 30 and 49. Similarly, informal surveys proposed to
users showed that most of respondents were males in their “late
teens to mid-20s”, and that female users were “very much in
the minority” [71]. Furthermore, Reddit is much more popular
among urban and suburban residents rather than individuals
living in rural areas [70]. Besides socio-demographic biases,
other works suggested also that Reddit has become more and
more a self-referential community, reinforcing the tendency
to focus on its own contents rather than external sources [72].
Thus, perceptions, interests, and behaviours of Reddit users
may differ from those of the general population. A similar
argument may be raised for Wikipedia searches. Indeed, the
usage of Internet, especially for information seeking purposes,
can vary across people with different socio-demographic backgrounds [73–76].
Finally, our view on online users reaction is partial. Indeed,
we do not consider other popular digital data sources such as,
for example, Twitter. The reason behind this choice is twofold.
First, many studies already characterized public response during the current and past health emergencies through the lens
of Twitter [25, 43, 45, 58, 59, 77–80]. Second, several studies have reported high prevalence of bots as drivers of low
quality information and discussions on COVID-19 on this platform [24, 25, 81–83]. Thus, careful and challenging extra steps
would be necessary to isolate, identify, and distinguish organic
discussions/reactions possibly originated from traditional media from those sparked by social bots. We leave this for future
work.
In conclusion, our work offers further insights to interpret
public response to the current global health emergency and
raises questions about possible undesired effects of communication. On one hand, our results confirm the pivotal role
of media during health emergencies, showing how collective
attention is mainly driven by media coverage. Therefore, since
people are highly reactive to the news they are exposed to, in
the beginning of an outbreak, the quality and type of information provided might have critical effects on risk perception,
behaviours, and ultimately on the unfolding of the disease. On
the other hand, however, we found that collective online attention saturates and declines rapidly despite media exposure and
disease circulation remaining high. Attention saturation has
the potential to affect collective awareness, perceived risk and
ultimately propensity towards virtuous individual behavioural
changes aimed at mitigating the spreading. Furthermore, especially in case of unknown viruses, attention saturation might
exacerbate the spreading of low quality information, which is
likely to spread in the early phases of the outbreak when the
characteristics of the disease are uncertain. Future works are
needed to characterize the actual effects of attention saturation

7
on human perceptions during a global health emergency.
Our findings suggest that public health authorities should
consider to reinforce specific communication channels, such
as social media platforms, in order to compensate the (natural) phenomenon of attention saturation. Indeed, these channels have the potential to create a more durable engagement
with people, through a continuous loop of direct interactions.
Currently, we see public health authorities issuing regularly
declarations on social media. However, the CDC didn’t even
have a Twitter account in 2009 during H1N1 pandemic (the
account was created in May 2010). While this is just an example, it underlines how we are relatively new to communicating
such global health emergencies through social medias. Therefore, there is great need to further reinforce and engage people
through these channels. Alongside, public health authorities
should consider to strengthen additional communication channels. An example can be represented by participatory surveillance platforms all over the world such as Influenzanet, Flu
Near You and FluTracking [84–86], which have the potential of
delivering in-depth targeted information to individuals during
public health emergencies, to promote the exchange of information between people and public health authorities, with the
potential to enhance the level of engagement in the community
[87].

METHODS AND MATERIAL

In this section we provide general information about the data
sets collected and the methods used.

A.

News Articles and Videos

We collect news articles using News API, a service that
allows to download articles published online in a variety of
countries and languages [88]. For each of the country considered, we download all relevant articles published online
by selected sources in the period 2020/02/07 - 2020/05/15.
We select “relevant” articles considering those citing one of
the following keywords: ’coronavirus’, ’covid19’, ’covid-19’,
’ncov-19’, ’sars-cov-2’. Note that for each article we have
access to title, description and a preview of the whole text.
In total, our dataset consists in 227, 768 news: 71, 461 published by Italian, 63, 799 by UK, 82, 630 by US, and 9, 878 by
Canadian media.
Additionally, we collect all videos published on YouTube
by major news organizations, in the four countries under investigation, via their official YouTube channels using the official
API [89]. In doing so, we download title and description of
all videos and select as relevant those that mention one of the
following keywords: ‘coronavirus’, ‘virus’, ‘covid’, ‘covid19’,
‘sars’, ‘sars-cov-2’, ‘sarscov2’.
The reach of each channel (measured by number of
subscribers) varies quite drastically from more than 9 million
for CNN (USA) to about 12 thousand for Ansa (Italy). In
total, the YouTube dataset consist of 13, 448 videos: 3, 325
by Italian, 3, 525 by British, 6, 288 by American, ans 310 by

Canadian channels.
It is important to underline that, while there is a good overlap
between the sources of news articles and videos, some do not
match. This is due to the fact that not all news organizations
run a YouTube channel and others do not produce traditional
articles. In the Supplementary Information, we provide a complete list of news outlets and Youtube channels considered.

Reddit data set

Reddit is a social content aggregation website where users
can post, comment and vote content. It is structured in subcommunities (i.e. subreddits), centered around a variety of
topics.
Reddit has already proven to be suitable for a variety of
research purposes, ranging from the study of user engagement
and interactions between highly related communities [90, 91]
to post-election political analyses [92]. Also, it has been used
to study the impact of linguistic differences in news titles [93]
and to explore recent web-related issues such as hate speech
[94] or cyberbullying [95] as well as health related issues like
mental illness [96], also providing insights about the opioid
epidemics [77, 97].
We used the Reddit API to collect all submissions and comments published in Reddit under the subreddit /r/Coronavirus
from 15/02/2020 to 15/05/2020. After data cleanup by removing entries deleted by authors and moderators, we keep
only submissions with score > 1 to avoid spam. We remove
comments with less than 10 characters and with more than 3
duplicates, to avoid using automatic messages from moderation. Final data contains 107, 898 submissions and 3, 829, 309
comments from 417, 541 distinct users.
For the submissions, we then selected entries with links to
English news outlets. The content of the urls was extracted
using the available implementation4 of the method described
in [98], resulting in 66, 575 valid documents.
Reddit does not provide any explicit information about users’
location, therefore we use self reporting via regular expression
to assign a location to users. Reddit users often declare geographical information about themselves in submissions or comment texts. We used the same approach as described in [97],
that found the use of regular expressions as reliable, resulting
in high correlation with census data in the US, although we
acknowledge a potential higher bias at country level due to
heterogeneities in Reddit population coverage and users demographics. We selected all texts containing expressions such as
‘I am from’ or ‘I live in’ and extracted candidate expressions
from the text that follows the expression, to identify which
ones represented country locations. By removing inconsistent
self reporting we were able to assign a country to 789, 909
distinct users, from which 41, 465 have written at least one
comment in the subreddit r/Coronavirus (13, 811 from USA,
6, 870 from Canada, 3, 932 from UK and 445 from Italy).

Wikipedia data set

Wikipedia has become a popular digital data source to study
health information seeking behaviour [57, 99], and to monitor
and forecast the spreading of infectious diseases [100, 101].
Here, we use the Wikimedia API [102] to collect the number
of visits per day of Wikipedia articles and the total monthly accesses to a specific project from each country. We consider the
language as indicative of a specific country, suggesting the relevant projects for our analysis to be in English and Italian, i.e.
en.wikipedia and it.wikipedia respectively. We choose the articles directly related to COVID-19 and the ones in the ’see also’
section of each page at the time of the analysis, 2020/02/07
- 2020/05/15, including country-specific articles (see Supplementary Information for full list of web pages considered).
Except for the Italian, where the language is highly indicative of the location, the number of the access to English pages
are almost evenly distributed among English-speaking countries. To normalize the signal related to each country we weight
the number of daily accesses to a single article from a specific
project p, Sp (d), with the total number of monthly accesses
from a country c to the related Wikipedia project Tpc (d) such
that the daily page views from a given Wikipedia project and
country is

Linear regression approach to model collective attention

Above we showed how media coverage, COVID-19 incidence, and public attention are correlated even across four
different countries. To move a step forward in this analysis, we considered a linear regression model that predicts for
each country the public response given the news exposure.
To include “memory effects” in the public response to media
coverage, we consider also a modified version of this simple
model, in which we weight cumulative news articles volume
time series with an exponential decaying term [22]. Formally,
we define the new variable:

Topic Modeling

Topic modeling has emerged as one of the most effective
methods for classifying, clustering, and retrieving textual data,
and has been the object of extensive investigation in the literature. Many topic analysis frameworks are extensions of
well known algorithms, considered as state-of-the-art for topic
modeling. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [103] is the reference for probabilistic topic modeling. Nonnegative matrix
factorization (NMF) [67] is the counterpart of LDA for the
matrix factorization community.
Although there are many approaches to temporal and hierarchical topic modeling [104–106], we choose to apply NMF
to the dataset, and then build time-varying intensities for each
topic using the articles publication date. Starting from a dataset
D containing the news articles shared in Reddit, we extract
words and phrases with the methodology described in [107],
discarding terms with frequency below 10, to form a vocabulary V with around 60k terms. Each document is then represented as a vector of term counts, in a bag-of-words approach.
We apply TF-IDF normalization [108] and extract a total of
K = 64 topics through NMF:

Where τ is a free parameter that sets the memory time scale and
is tuned with cross-validation (more details in the Supplementary Information). These two models are compared to a linear
regression that considers only COVID-19 incidence to predict

(2)

Where yt can be either the volume of Reddit comments of
geolocalized users or country specific Wikipedia visits, and
ut is the error term. In Table II we report the results of the
three regressions in terms of Akaike Information Criterion
(AIC) [54]. We observe that the model considering both news
volume and memory effects is generally the better choice,
while the model considering COVID-19 incidence only is the
worst.

where the denominator is the total number of views of the
Wikipedia specific project. The total volume of views at day d

where kk2F is the Frobenius norm and X ∈ R|D|×|V| is the matrix resulting form TF-IDF normalization, subject to the constraint that the values in W ∈ R|D|×K and H ∈ RK×|V| must
be nonnegative. The nonnegative factorization is achieved using the projected gradient method with sparseness constraints,
as described in [109, 110]. The matrix H is then used as a

9
transformation basis for other datasets, e.g. with a new matrix
e we fix H and calculate a new W
e according to Eq. 3.
X
For each topic k we build a time series sk for each dataset
(t)
D, where sk is the strength of topic k at time t. For the news
P
(t)
outlets dataset, sk = i∈D(t) wik , where D(t) is the set of
all documents shared at time t in news outlets. For Reddit, we
weight each shared document by its number of comments, and
P
(t)
sk = i∈D(t) wik · ci , where D(t) is the set of all documents
shared at time t in Reddit, and ci is the number of comments
associated to document i. Finally, we define the relevance of a
topic as the integral in time of the strength. Therefore, given
t0 and tf as the start/end of our analysis interval, and given
Rt
(t)
R = t0f dtsk , the coordinates of Figure 5 are the t1/2 such
R t1/2
(t)
that t0 dtsk = R/2.
