Abstract
The current COVID-19 pandemic has proven that proper control and prevention of infectious disease require creating and enforcing the appropriate public policies. One critical policy
imposed by the policymakers is encouraging the population to practice social distancing (i.e.
controlling the contact rate among the population). Here we pose a mean-field game model
of individuals each choosing a dynamic strategy of making contacts, given the trade-off of
gaining utility but also risking infection from additional contacts. We compute and compare
the mean-field equilibrium (MFE) strategy, which assumes each individual acting selfishly to
maximize its own utility, to the socially optimal strategy, which maximizes the total utility
of the population. We prove that the optimal decision of the infected is always to make more
contacts than the level at which it would be socially optimal, which reinforces the important
role of public policy to reduce contacts of the infected (e.g. quarantining, sick paid leave).
Additionally, we include cost to incentivize people to change strategies, when computing the
socially optimal strategies. We find that with this cost, policies reducing contacts of the infected should be further enforced after the peak of the epidemic has passed. Lastly, we compute
the price of anarchy (PoA) of this system, to understand the conditions under which large discrepancies between the MFE and socially optimal strategies arise, which is when intervening
public policy would be most effective.

Introduction

The current COVID-19 pandemic has been evidence that posing a public policy to fight such a crisis
is an extremely difficult and interdisciplinary task. A major component of such policies is urging
people to practice social distancing. By reducing interpersonal contacts, the spread of infection can
be slowed down. However, it is uncertain how to incentivize people to practice social distancing,
when there are clearly numerous benefits to making contacts, such as working for income, general
desire for freedom and social relationships.
Given this trade-off between the additional utility from making more contacts, and the additional
chance of infection from those contacts, we will compute and compare 1) the selfish strategies,
in which individuals make contacts to optimize only their own utilities and 2) socially optimal
strategies, in which individuals make contacts which optimize the utility of the total population.
The approach of focusing on the economic causes and epidemiological consequences is referred
to as economic epidemiology [1]. Recent work has focused on treating economic factors behind
contact and mixing decisions as part of the disease transmission mechanism [2–6]. More specifically, some previous work in this field has explicitly included contact behaviors as control variables
into the classical SIR model and have shown that different dynamics can emerge with adaptive
behavior [7–9]. Disease dynamics has also been studied with game theory, focusing mostly on
steady-state problems or those related to vaccination [10–12]. Optimal control theory has also
been used to study policy interventions on infectious disease dynamics [13, 14]. Our work here
builds on these previous models to pose a mean-field game problem of social distancing, explicitly modeling the feedback between the individuals and the population structure. The individual,
which is susceptible (S), infected (I), or recovered (R), each chooses a dynamic contact strategy to

1

maximize its accumulated utility over the time period.
Mean-field games is a recently developed field of mathematics, studying dynamic game-theoretic
problems of infinite number of players [15, 16]. Our model is a relatively simple formulation of
the mean-field games, in which we have a deterministic game with 3 discrete states (S,I,R) in
continuous time. Depending on the number of contacts each individual makes, the dynamics of
the infectious population follow the SIR model, and the anticipation of this population structure
influences the computation of an individual’s optimal strategy. We take mean-field assumptions
such that 1) the number of individuals in the population is large (N → ∞), 2) the individuals
are homogeneous within each compartment and the population is well-mixed, and 3) individuals
engage in symmetric interactions.

Model
SIR dynamics

The focus of this work is on understanding the effect of social distancing behavior and the corresponding utility trade-offs on the epidemiological dynamics, so we will keep the epidemiology
as simple as possible as a baseline model. We will devote a section to including an exposed class
(SEIR), but leave further expansion on the epidemiology as future work.
We consider an SIR model without births or deaths. The recovered (R) is an absorbing state,
where individuals gain permanent immunity from the disease. For now, we do not consider exposed period or asymptomatic or presymptomatic transmissions.
Without birth or death, the population is fixed, and we let xz be the fraction of the population in
compartment z ∈ {S, I, R}. Then the dynamics of the SIR system is


 ẋS = −C(·)βxS xI
ẋI = C(·)βxS xI − µxI


ẋR = µxI
(1)
β is the likelihood that infection happens given a contact between S and I, and µ is the constant
rate of recovery from infection. C(·) is the rate that an S individual and an I individual make
contact, which is dependent on whether individuals choose to socially distance or not. Let us write
the number of contacts made by a z ∈ {S, I, R} individual at time t as cz (t).
It is evident that C(·) should increase as cS (t) and cI (t) increase, but there are two intuitive
ways of writing an expression for C(·), analogous to frequency-dependent or density-dependent
disease transmission.
i) Frequency-dependent
Looking only at the transmission term (suppressing notation for dependence on t for brevity),
ẋS = −β

cS xS cI xI
cS xS + cI xI + cR xR

(2)

where a contact by S has probability cS xS +ccIIxxII+cR xR of being with I. Therefore, the transmission
term depends on the relative frequency between the contact strategies.
ii) Density-dependent
Similarly the transmission term is
ẋS = −β 0 cS xS cI xI

(3)

Here, the transmission term depends on not only the relative frequency, but also the absolute
density of the contact strategies. If the whole population is doubling or halving contacts, the
transmission should increase or decrease accordingly, and this density-dependent formulation is
consistent with such intuitions. For the rest of this paper, we will take the density-dependent
formulation. (Note that β 0 term here is technically different from the β term above, but for
simplicity, any β referred to for the rest of this paper is β 0 of the density-dependent formulation.)

2.2

Utility of contacts

cz (t) is the contact strategy which is explicitly chosen by an individual. Large cz (t) means going
out to work and socializing, while smaller cz (t) means refraining from those activities (i.e. social
distancing). uz (cz ) denotes the utility received by a z individual from making cz contacts, which
is a combination of economic gains and personal well-being. The realistic conditions that we impose are the following: Starting from zero contacts, increasing the number of contacts results in
increased utility, which is the baseline universal need for social interactions, as well as monetary
gain from economic activities. We assume that the marginal increase in utility decreases with more
contacts, until eventually, more contacts become detrimental.
Therefore, the appropriate functional form of uz (cz ) must be a concave function with an interior maximum. One appropriate function form with interpretations of the parameters is uz (cz ) =
(bz cz − c2z )γ − az where cz ∈ [0, bz ] [8]. bz is a parameter of how the disease impacts the marginal
economic productivity of the individual. Large bz means that the individual has the choice to make
more contacts, as well as receive higher marginal utility from making contacts. az is a parameter of
the baseline cost of being infected, such as an individual’s general propensity to be healthy. These
two parameters decompose the effect of the disease into economic cost and health cost. Some
assumptions on these parameters are that bS = bR > bI and aS = aR < aI , since the infected
become impaired in economic productivity, as well as suffer the health cost compared to the S
and R. γ changes the concave shape of the function, and γ ∈ (0, 1] ensures that uz (cz ) is concave
everywhere in the domain.
From this utility function, we see that each individual has some optimal level of social contacts.
The utility of a z individual is maximized at b2z , which is each individual’s optimal contact strategy
in the absence of adaptive behavior in response to the risk of infectious disease.

Figure 1: uz (cz ) is shown where z ∈ {S, R} are healthy (green) and z ∈ {I} is infected (red) and
the parameters are bS = bR = 10, bI = 6, aS = aR = 0, aI = 1, and γ = 0.25. A healthy individual
gains utility from making more contacts, but eventually does not want to make more, when cS = 5.
The infected suffers the baseline cost, but also gains some utility from making contacts, although
at a lower rate compared to the healthy.

2.3

Value function

Over time period, t ∈ [0, T ], the total utility of an individual is the sum of utility gained at each
time point. For example, a recovered individual with continuous contact decision c(t) receives total
RT
utility 0 uR (c(t))dt. Typically, a discounting term, δ which discounts the future utility compared
to the present utility, is included, but we set δ = 1 for simplicity. The general results here do not
change with δ < 1.
Let us define VR (t) to be the total future utility expected by the R individual at time t until
3

T . From this formulation, it follows that terminal condition is VR (T ) = 0, and

Similarly for S and I individuals, we define VS (t) and VI (t), which depend on the rate at which
the individuals move between the SIR states. (Fig. 2)

Figure 2: Between time t and t + dt, S, I, and R individuals move between the states at these rates.
The S individual becomes infected at a rate dependent on contact rates. The I individual recovers
at a constant rate of µdt. The recovered individual remains in the state.
From these transition rates, we can write the Bellman equations, which give the value functions
for individuals in S, I, and R states, respectively, as:

Mean Field Equilibrium solution

The SIR dynamics and the Bellman equations are coupled by the contact strategies, cS , cI , cR ,
and the population, xS , xI , xR . The solution to this problem is the mean-field equilibrium (MFE),
eq

which is the fixed point (ceq

the optimal solutions in equations 38 given xS , xI , and xR and 2) xS , xI , and xR are solutions to
the system of ODEs in equation 35 given the optimal strategies.

2.5

Socially Optimal solution

Additionally, we can characterize the socially optimal solution. Similar to the second-best equilibrium, discussed by Lipsey and Lancaster [17] [18], if the infected individuals do not pursue the
most utility-maximizing decisions, there is another equilibrium, in which the population can attain
higher utility on average. If a central planner chooses the contact strategies of the population
to maximize the utility of the entire population, the resulting socially optimal solution solves the
dynamic optimization problem,

The I individuals, similar to the R individuals, do not change from the optimal contact rate.
From the above formulation, we see that VI (t) is bounded by VR (t), and VR (t) − VI (t) increases as
µ decreases, since it implies that I individuals spend longer time as an infected before recovering.

uS is concave, so ceq
S can be uniquely found. Also, we have VS (t) > VI (t) for all t < T . This is
because starting from the terminal condition VS (T ) = VI (T ) = 0, if at any time t we are sufficiently
close to VS = VI , V̇S (t) = −umax

Note that ceq
S is smaller for bigger values of bI βxI (VS (t) − VI (t)), which means that the susceptible individuals should decrease contact if 1) infected population gets large, 2) the disease spreads
easily, 3) cost of being infected is large, or 4) if the disease minimally affects the ability of the
infected.

Numerical solution
We use discrete time steps ∆t to find the numerical solutions to the equations. With some initial
c0 = (c0S , c0I , c0R ), we compute x0 = (x0S , x0I , x0R ) using the ODE forward equations. Then, c1 can
be computed via backward induction with the given x0 . We continue this until we find ck and xk
such that ck = ck−1 and xk = xk−1 , which is the MFE solution.

Figure 3: The top figure shows xz for z ∈ {S, I, R}, the SIR dynamics for MFE solution (solid
lines) and the classical case without adaptive behaviors (dashed lines). Bottom figure shows ceq
z (t)
for z ∈ {S, I, R}.
Figure 3 shows the MFE numerical solution with disease parameters β = 0.03 and µ = 0.1, and
utility parameters bS = bR = 10, bI = 6, aS = aR = 0, aI = 4, and γ = 0.25. As we showed

6

in Proposition 1 and 2, the recovered and infected individuals have no incentive to lower their
contact rates, and so they continue with optimal level of contact rates. The susceptible individuals
lower their contact rate to balance their immediate utilities and their expected cost of possibly
getting infected. In result, the spread of infection is mitigated by the behavioral changes by the
susceptible population, compared to the classical case in which no adaptive behavior is considered.
The infection curve has lower peak due to the behavioral changes, but also a longer tail, because
there are more remaining susceptible individuals to get the disease after the peak.

(b) Cumulative curves (0.02 ≤ µ ≤ 0.1)

(c) Cumulative curves (2 ≤ bI ≤ 10)

(d) Cumulative curves (2 ≤ aI ≤ 10)

Figure 4: The cumulative epidemic size is shown for the MFE solution (red) and the classical
SIR (black) for the range of given parameter. For each (a)-(d), five cumulative curves are shown
corresponding to five values of the given parameter in the range, where the more transparent lines
are smaller parameter values.
Figure 4 shows the cumulative epidemic curve of the MFE solution and the classical SIR for different parameter values of β, µ, bI , and aI . For any set of parameter values, the MFE solution, because
of the adaptive behaviors, results in smaller final size as well as more gradual spread of the epidemic.
If the disease is more infectious (large β), the MFE solution shows faster spread as well as larger
final size, although mitigated compared to what the classical SIR model would predict (Figure 4a).
If the disease has longer recovery time (small µ), the classical SIR model predicts faster spread.
However, the MFE solution predicts a different result. For example, when µ = 0.02, the classical
case predicts that because the average infectious period is long, the number of infected population
rises faster. However, the behavioral decision of individuals are considered in the MFE solution,
and so a more gradual epidemic is predicted, since it is optimal to suppress contacts to avoid
getting infected in the first place (Fig. 4b).

7

bI and aI are new parameters introduced to consider the effect of behavioral change. bI denotes the economic utility, depending on social activity, and aI denotes the health utility of the
individual. If the disease does not affect the productivity of the infected individual (high bI ), the
disease will spread as if its transmission rate β is higher (Fig. 4c). In the case of COVID-19, the
symptoms of many have been mild to moderate, which might have contributed to the perceived
higher transmission rate.
The epidemic spread as predicted by the classical SIR model would not change with changes in aI ,
but the MFE solution shows smaller epidemic and flatter growth rate for high aI , as individuals
choose to make less contacts to avoid the high cost of becoming infected (Fig. 4d).

Socially optimal solution

The MFE solution, discussed above, considers the case in which individuals maximize their own
utility. For the socially optimal solution, we pose a centralized control problem, in which we find

In order to solve the optimal control problem, we use Pontryagin’s maximum principle, which gives
the necessary conditions for the optimal controls, given the evolving dynamics of the system.
Theorem 3.1 (Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle). Let x = [xS , xI , xR ]T and c = [cS , cI , cR ]T .
For the given deterministic dynamics, ẋ = f (x, c), the Hamiltonian is defined as
H(x, c, λ, t) := L(x, c) + λT f (x, c)
where λ(t) is the costate trajectory. If x(t), copt (t) is the optimal trajectory in 0 ≤ t ≤ T from
x(0), then λ(t) satisfies
−λ̇ = Hx (xopt , copt , λ, t) = Lx (xopt , copt ) + λT fx (xopt , copt )
and copt is the solution to the optimization problem,
copt = argmax H(xopt , c, λ)

Proposition 4. The socially optimal contact rate of the infected, copt
must always be less than

Proof. We can apply the Pontryagin’s maximum principle, which gives the necessary condition

λS (t), λI (t), λR (t), such that λS (T ) = 0, λI (T ) = 0, λR (T ) = 0, and for t < T , they satisfy:

Note the similarities between our expressions for λS , λI , λR and VS , VI , VR from the MFE, with
the additional term in (23) as the only difference. Intuitively, this additional term represents the
infected individual caring about the consequences of its contact strategy on the population, which
is not considered by the selfish I individual in its MFE objective function. It can be interpreted
as the I individual’s internalized negative externalities (i.e. thinking about our actions and their
8

impact on others). First, we see that the cR term in the objective function can be separated, and
eq
so we can find the maximizer, copt
R = 0.5bR = cR , which gives λR (t) = VR (t) for all t. Therefore,

Clearly, βxS xI > 0 for all t, assuming nontrivial initial conditions, xS (0) > 0 and xI (0) > 0. Also,
λS − λI > 0 for t < T . Starting from the given terminal conditions λS (T ) = λI (T ) = 0, if at any
point we get sufficiently close to λS = λI , we see that λ̇S < λ˙I , so λS will be strictly larger than
λI in 0 ≤ t < T . Therefore, βxS xI (λS − λI ) > 0 for all 0 ≤ t < T .
With the utility function uz (cz ) = (bz cz − c2z )γ − az , we will prove that copt

at time t, it is also the solution at time t + dt. This means that λS − λI must be increasing in

contradiction, c∗I < 0.5bI for all 0 ≤ t < T .
This proposition implies that the selfish behavior of the infected is never optimal for the population, and so the appropriate policy in all cases is to decrease the contacts of the infected below
the level that they want to selfishly make.

For the same set of parameters as in Figure 3, we can compute the socially optimal solution. The
optimal solution as shown in Figure 5b is to completely suppress the contacts of the I, so that no

additional infection can take place, while the susceptible population resumes normal activities. In
fact, this is most often the socially optimal strategy. An exception is if a large part of the population
was already infected initially (Figure 5c,d). Here, 70 percent of the population is initially infected,
and so the optimal contact strategy is to completely isolate the susceptible until the number of
infected decreases to some level, at which, we go back to complete quarantining of the I and the
resuming of normal activities by the S. This type of policy is the complete shutdown implemented
to various degrees in the United States, in which it is better to completely insulate the susceptibles
until the number of infected population decrease back to a manageable level.

3.3

Cost of central planning

A key piece missing in our characterization of the socially optimal solution is the various costs
to controlling the contact rate of the population. The assumption in Section 3.2 that the central
planner can freely choose contact rates is far from realistic. For example, in the optimal solutions of
Figure 5b, complete suppression of contact rates of the infected must be done through quarantining
or providing proper incentives to keep infected people from making social contacts, which all cost
resources. Additionally, people do not generally like their choices to be decided by an authority,
so this cost also includes the ”loss in freedom,” which the central planner of wants to minimize.
Therefore, we add to the problem in 3.2, a cost for deviating away from the population’s MFE.

We add a new parameter, k ≥ 0, which balances the competing objectives of maximizing total
utility and minimizing the deviations from selfish strategies, similar to a regularization parameter
in machine learning. When k = 0, the solution to the objective function is the socially optimal
solution, and when k is large, the solution is the MFE solution. In the intermediate values of k,
we can find the solution which balances the trade-off.
As we see in Figure 6, for different values of k, we compute the socially optimal contact rates of
the population. Another interpretation is that given limited resources to control contact rates, we
find how it should be distributed during t ∈ [0, T ]. We see a common result among the range of
values for k, which is that when susceptibles have low contact rates, it is less important to keep
the contact rates of the infected as low. Instead, it is more optimal use of resources to make sure
the contact rates of the infected after the peak of the epidemic is lowered because this is when the
susceptibles start ramping up to normal activities, thus posing higher risk of a second epidemic.
Another reason is that because the number of infected is smaller at this time and the imposed cost
is fixed per capita, the same amount of resources is more efficiently used by controlling the smaller
population of infected rather than the larger infected population during the peak.

Application to SEIR Model

Here we show the numerical solutions to the MFE problem when exposed class (E) is added to
the model. First, we consider the case in which the exposed individuals are not yet infectious, but
incubating the disease. Second, we consider the case in which the exposed individuals are presymptomatic, meaning that they are infectious before they show symptoms, although at a lower rate
compared to the infectious individuals.
The incubation period is a random variable which has exponential distribution with parameter ν (The average incubation period is ν −1 ). Another variable which is introduced is βE , the
presymptomatic transmission rate of individuals in the exposed class. If there is no presymptomatic transmission, βE = 0. The SEIR model is


Because the susceptible and the exposed classes do not have visible symptoms, an individual cannot
differentiate between being in the S or E class. Therefore, we define the asymptomatic class, which
includes both the susceptible class and the exposed class. The value function of this class will be
taken as the weighted average between the S and E classes,
VA =

With the parameters from Figure 3, we include an exposed class and vary the incubation parameter ν, where ν −1 is the average incubation period (Figure 7a) or the presymptomatic transmission
rate βE (Figure 7b.
As seen in Figure 7a, if there is an epidemic of an infectious disease with longer incubation period,
it becomes optimal for susceptible individuals to not engage in social distancing. This is because
larger incubation period suggests higher uncertainty of whether one was already exposed or not.
The infection curve also reaches a higher final size because of more contact behavior, although at
a slower rate because of the incubation period.
Additionally, if the infectious disease causes presymptomatic transmission, the resulting infection curve and optimal contact decisions of the susceptibles can be seen in Figure 7b. If βE , the
presymptomatic transmission rate, is large, it quickly promotes more behavior because individuals
of the exposed class unknowingly make social contacts, and quickly infect many susceptibles.
Here, we presented preliminary results of this model when an exposed class is included. Further studies are needed such as computing the socially optimal solution with and without cost, as
we did for the SIR model.

3.5

Price of Anarchy

We compute the price of anarchy (PoA), which is a measure of how much the system degrades due
to the selfish strategies of individuals in each S, I, R compartment. In the context of mean-field
games, it is the ratio of the total utility of the population adopting MFE strategies to the total
utility of the population adopting socially optimal strategies [19]. The PoA is given by
PoA =

Vopt (0)
xS (0)VS (0) + xI (0)VI (0) + xR (0)VR (0)

(40)

where Vopt is the maximum of the objective function in (20). The PoA, computed for ranges of
β, µ, bI , and aI , is shown in Fig. 8. While one parameter is changed, the others were kept fixed
with the parameter values from Fig. 3.
As β is made larger, PoA increases because each selfish contact behavior of the infected individual becomes magnified by the high transmission rate per contact (Fig. 8a). We see a similarly
increasing trend as µ gets smaller, because it increases the time spent infected (Fig. 8b). However,
an increase in β results in decreasing marginal gain in PoA while a decrease in µ results in increasing marginal gain in PoA. Even for unreasonably large β, the overall utility suffers by around 11%,
while small µ can cause a decline of 45%. The PoA is affected more by changes in µ, the recovery
rate of the disease.
Fig. 8c shows that an intermediate value of bI results in the largest PoA. This non-monotonic
relationship is because of the trade-offs of large bI . On one hand, large bI means that the disease
does not affect the day-to-day productivity of the infected as severely, and so the infected are not
as penalized. On the other hand, this also means that the infected are able to be more active and
make more contacts, which infects more susceptibles. These two opposing effects are balanced near
bI = 5, where the PoA is at its maximum. When aI is large (Fig. 8d), the baseline cost of getting
infected is larger, which results in less utility at each time point.

Discussion
Possible additions

The public policy response to COVID-19 is an extremely complex problem with many factors
which this paper has not covered. This model and analysis are, in many ways, the simplest
baseline case from which we can make more realistic to fit a particular disease. First, we can pose
the problem with different compartmental models. For example, if we take the SIS model, we
12

would see different optimal strategies since the infected also face the burden of social distancing.
In the case of COVID-19, it will be most useful to include a compartment with asymptomatic
transmission, which behaves like S from the central planner’s perspective. The socially optimal
strategies depended on being able to distinguish between the S and the I, when it is not always the
case. The lack of available testing of COVID-19, for example, provides the uncertainty within the
population as well as from the central planner’s perspective. Second, we can add heterogeneity to
the population by including additional state variables such as age, socioeconomic status, or level
of prosociality. By explicitly adding the different subpopulations, we can understand the game
theoretic dilemma at play between the old vs. the young, the financially stable vs. the unstable, or
the prosocial vs. antisocial. Then, more specific policies may be proposed that target the contact
strategies of a particular group.

4.2

Conclusions from this model

While our analysis does not include many important factors, we can still make some general
conclusions.
Selfish strategies still ”flatten the curve.”
By including adaptive behavior of individuals, our model predicts epidemic curves with flatter
growth rate, compared to the classical counterparts. In our simple model, the curve is flattened
naturally because of susceptibles who weigh the trade-off between current utility of making contacts
and the future cost of getting infected. The recovered and the infected do not have any trade-offs
to decrease contacts. Even if only the susceptibles are practicing social distancing, it still decreases
the number of contacts of the system, and so the infected population reaches a smaller peak (Fig. 3,
4). It should be emphasized that the curve is flattened because individuals anticipate future growth
in infections and decrease their contacts to avoid being exposed to the infected individuals. If the
possible outbreak is flat-out denied by the media, then individuals will not adapt their behaviors,
causing an unmitigated large peak in the infected population. Therefore, it is the responsibility of
the policymakers to clearly communicate the existence and extent of the spreading disease.
Selfish strategy of the infected is never socially optimal.
eq
We prove that the socially optimal strategy of the infected, copt
I , is always less than cI . Therefore,
policies in response to the epidemic should decrease the contact rates of the infected. We see
examples of policies with this aim such as quarantining the infected or granting paid sick leave
to individuals who tested positive. Both policies respectively decrease the contact rates of the
infected directly or indirectly by decreasing bI , reducing the potential gain in utility of making
more contacts. Because reducing the contacts of the infected is so important, policymakers might
consider even more aggressive policies.

It is important to control the infected contact rates, following the peak of the epidemic.
If cost is imposed to the central planner in changing the contact rates of the individuals, we find the
new socially optimal contact rates, depending on k, which is the per capita unit cost of changing
contact rates. For k = 0 and k  1 respectively, we find the cost-imposed socially optimal solution
to be the previously computed copt and ceq . For k values in between (Fig. 8), we commonly see
that when it is too costly to decrease the infected contact rate for the whole time period, it is most
beneficial to at least focus on decreasing after the epidemic has subsided. An assumption here is
that cost of central planning is constant in time, when it may not be in real world situations. When
outbreak is at its peak, more public attention is on the disease, and it may be easier to implement
social distancing or secure funding for quarantining. However, when the disease has subsided, it
might be harder to convince the public to behave differently.
This result reinforces the need for formal social distancing policy which goes beyond the peak
of the epidemic. When the disease is prevalent, social distancing can be naturally favored due to
individual optimization, but to sustain it for longer requires centralized public policy to prevent
second peaks. This general result is in agreement with other studies of COVID-19 policies which
mention the likely possibility of second peaks [20–22]. Additional work, using more realistic central

13

planning cost depending on time and population structure, will help us better understand how such
long-term social distancing policies should be implemented.
Disease with exposed period is unfavorable for promoting social distancing.
As the preliminary results show in Section 3.4, if an epidemic of an infectious disease with an
incubation period breaks out in a population, it will be harder to maintain social distancing
behaviors in the population. In the case of COVID-19, which is believed to have an incubation
period of up to two weeks before symptoms, each asymptomatic individual will be more uncertain
concerning its infection status, and thus make it harder to prolong social distancing. Additionally,
it is believed that those exposed to COVID-19 can transmit the disease before showing symptoms,
which will further make it hard to maintain social distancing, as seen in Figure 7b.
Policies are most needed for diseases with low µ, high aI , high β and intermediate bI .
By computing the price of anarchy, we can measure the effect of different parameters on how much
the system is degraded by the selfish behaviors. Diseases with low µ, high aI , high β, intermediate
bI , in this order, seem to most affect the population such that their selfish behaviors will degrade
the system more compared to central intervention.
An interesting future work will be to put different diseases on the spectrum of these 4 variables,
depending on its epidemiological characteristics as well as its economic and health effects on the
infected. Then, we can roughly categorize diseases which need to be centrally intervened in the
case of an outbreak.
