Public policy must confront emergencies that evolve in real time and in uncertain directions
[1-6], yet little is known about the nature of policy response. Here we take the coronavirus
pandemic as a global and extraordinarily consequential case [7-12], and study the global
policy response by analyzing a novel dataset recording policy documents published by
government agencies, think tanks, and intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) across 114
countries (37,725 policy documents from January 2nd through May 26th 2020). Our analyses
reveal four primary findings. (1) Global policy attention to COVID-19 follows a remarkably
similar trajectory as the total confirmed cases of COVID-19, yet with evolving policy focus
from public health to broader social issues. (2) The COVID-19 policy frontier
disproportionately draws on the latest, peer-reviewed, and high-impact scientific insights.
Moreover, policy documents that cite science appear especially impactful within the policy
domain. (3) The global policy frontier is primarily interconnected through IGOs, such as the
World Health Organization, which produce policy documents that are central to the COVID19 policy network and draw especially strongly on scientific literature. Removing IGOs’
contributions fundamentally alters the global policy landscape, with the policy citation
network among government agencies increasingly fragmented into many isolated clusters.
(4) Countries exhibit highly heterogeneous policy attention to COVID-19. Most strikingly,
a country’s early policy attention to COVID-19 shows a surprising degree of predictability
for the country’s subsequent deaths. Overall, these results uncover fundamental patterns of

1

policy interactions and, given the consequential nature of emergent threats and the paucity
of quantitative approaches to understand them, open up novel dimensions for assessing and
effectively coordinating global and local responses to COVID-19 and beyond.

The global policy response to the COVID-19 pandemic
Human society is often challenged by emergencies, from natural disasters [1-3] and pandemics [7,
8, 13, 14] to human conflicts [15, 16] and other emergent crises [3, 17, 18]. Despite the
consequential nature of public response [6-12], governments often struggle to manage these
emergent problems, potentially due to various reasons ranging from the inherent difficulties in
altering rules and allocating attention and resources [19, 20] to uncertainties about the evolving
nature of the problems [19-21].The COVID-19 pandemic provides a high-stakes case for
examining the nature of policy response [5-12, 20]. Indeed, the coronavirus pandemic is not only
a public health crisis but also creates enormous challenges to social, economic, and political
systems around the world [19, 20, 22]. At the same time, evolving knowledge about the nature of
the disease [23, 24], as well as evolving knowledge about containment policies and social
implications [5, 7-11, 19, 20, 22], presents a dynamic and uncertain policy environment.
To quantify the global policy response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we analyze a novel dataset of
policy documents (37,725 documents published from January 2nd to May 26th, 2020). The dataset
categorizes the source, topics, publication date of each policy document, and further includes each
document’s cited references. The institutions include government agencies, think tanks, and
intergovernmental organizations (IGOs). The coverage is worldwide, with policy documents from
114 countries, and includes all major economies and large population centers, with a notable
exception of mainland China, overall covering ~66.3% of the world population, ~79.3% of total
Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and ~95.6% of confirmed deaths worldwide due to COVID-19
(as of May 30th, see Fig. S1 and SI S1.1 for further description). Within this corpus, we identify
COVID-19 related policy documents through keyword filtering (7,730 documents in total, see SI
S1.1), allowing us to compare COVID-19 policy documents with all other policy documents
published in 2020. For each policy document, we further analyze all the references cited therein,
allowing us to link policy documents to scientific papers and other policy documents they

2

reference. These linkages can inform how different institutions interact in policy making and also
illuminate the nature of the scientific knowledge upon which these policies draw.
Overall, the total number of policy documents recorded in our database grows roughly linearly
with time, averaging approximately 280 new policy documents per day (Fig. 1A). By contrast, the
number of COVID-19 related policy documents features highly non-linear growth, approximated
by an exponential pattern (Fig. 1B and inset), showing rapid shifts in global policy attention over
the past few months. To understand how policy attention tracks the coronavirus outbreak, we
measure the share of policy attention to COVID-19 by calculating the proportion of COVID-19
related policy documents among all policy documents published on a given day. We then compare
this share with how the pandemic unfolded globally, as traced by the Johns Hopkins COVID-19
tracking map [23]. We find that the share of COVID-19 policy attention shows a remarkably
similar trajectory as the total confirmed cases of COVID-19 over time (Fig. 1C, red vs blue). We
observe the same pattern when using total confirmed deaths (Fig. S2). Together, these results show
that the share of policy attention to COVID-19 closely corresponds to the global unfolding of the
pandemic (see SI S3.1 for more detail).
To inform how the COVID-19 policy attention may reflect policy-making institutions’ priorities,
we further examine the content of the COVID-19 related policy documents, breaking them down
by field (Fig. 1D) and topic (Fig. 1E). For both analyses, we observed clear shifts in policy
attention related to the pandemic, with policy priorities shifting from issues in public health to
economy and society. Indeed, we first classify COVID-19 related policy documents by field,
grouping them into three major field categories (“science & health”, “economy & labour”, and
“society & others”, see SI S2.1 for more detail). Plotting the share of COVID-19 policy documents
across these field categories (Fig. 1D), we find that in the early stage of the outbreak (January and
February 2020), about 90% of COVID-19 policies belong to the health and science category,
showing a clear, initial focus on public health issues. The policy priorities show a visible shift,
however, since early March 2020, with a notable rise in policy attention to issues around the
economy and society, suggesting a growing policy balance between health and socio-economic
implications of the pandemic (see Fig. S3B for results at the individual field level).

3

We further break down these policy documents at the narrower topic level, plotting dynamics
related to COVID-19 for the top 10 topics (Fig. 1E). We find again an initial focus on healthrelated topics (in blue), followed by a clear increase over time in the share of topics related to
economy and society (in red). Indeed, Fig. 1F-G respectively show the word cloud of all topics
pre- and post-WHO’s pandemic declaration, which illustrates a stark difference in policy priorities
across the two periods, shifting sharply from public health to socioeconomic issues (see Fig. S3A
for topic changes by month). Furthermore, the shifts documented in Figs. 1D-G are observed in
COVID-19 policy documents only, as we repeated all our analyses for other policy documents
published in the same period, finding that their shares by field or topic are relatively stable over
time (Fig. S4).
The role of science in the COVID-19 policy response
Overall, Fig. 1 demonstrates a rapidly evolving global policy frontier that closely corresponds to
the evolution of the pandemic. Yet at the same time the scientific research related to COVID-19
also evolves rapidly, as exemplified by the strong response from the global research enterprise [5,
20]. Indeed, as of May 30th 2020, over 40,000 papers on coronavirus research have been published
in 2020, with preprint servers playing an outsize role in disseminating the latest science [22, 25].
The parallel advancement of the policy and scientific frontier in response to the pandemic raises a
crucial question: is our policy understanding of COVID-19 closely linked with scientific
understanding, or largely separated from the ivory tower? To answer this question, here we trace
all scientific papers cited by policy documents in our corpus and match them to large-scale
publication and citation databases (SI S1.2), offering a unique opportunity to quantify the role of
science in the global policy response to COVID-19.
We find that COVID-19 policy documents rapidly evolve with the scientific frontier. First, Fig.
2A shows that the probability for these policy documents to cite at least one scientific paper
fluctuates until WHO’s pandemic declaration, and features a steady increase afterward. Fig. 2B
plots the age distribution of scientific evidence referenced by COVID-19 policy documents,
showing that COVID-19 policies are disproportionately centered on the latest scientific frontier.
Indeed, out of all scientific references drawn upon by COVID-19 policy documents, 19.9% of the
scientific papers were published in 2020. This rate of utilizing the most recent scientific knowledge

4

is over ten times larger than seen for other policy documents. Not surprisingly, we find that the
latest scientific evidence cited by COVID-19 policies is primarily related to research on
coronavirus (88.4%). However, as policy attention shifts gradually from health to economy over
the course of the pandemic (Fig. 1D-E), we also observe a similar shift in the fields of science that
COVID-19 policies cite (Fig. 2C), showing a clear shift from drawing primarily upon the
biomedical literature to citing economics, society, and other fields of study (Figs. S3C).
Together, these results suggest that despite the extremely recent development in COVID-19 related
scientific research, new scientific work substantially finds its way into policy documents,
prompting us to next examine the quality of scientific evidence that informs policy. To proceed,
we separate COVID-19 related papers into two groups based on whether or not they are referenced
by policy documents. We then measure each paper’s scientific impact, approximated by the
number of citations the paper receives from other scientific papers. We find a dramatic impact
difference between the two groups (Fig. 2D): papers referenced in policy documents garner on
average 40 times higher citations than those not referenced in policy (average citations: 67.72 vs
1.67). This result shows that the coronavirus research used by policymakers tends to align with
what scientists themselves consider important.
Figure 2E further breaks down the policy coverage of COVID-19 related research based on
publication venues. We find that different venues differ widely in publication volume, with
preprint servers such as medRxiv, bioRxiv, and SSRN publishing an order of magnitude more
COVID-19 related papers than peer-reviewed journals. Yet, despite the large amount of papers
posted on preprint servers, their impact in policy is rather limited, as these preprint servers show
consistently fewer policy citations than average. By contrast, COVID-19 policies
disproportionately reference peer-reviewed insights, drawing especially heavily on respected
medical journals, both general (e.g., Lancet) and specialized (e.g., Clinical Infectious Diseases).
Amid growing concerns over the quality and abundancy of coronavirus research posted on preprint
servers [26], these results show that peer-reviewed journals appear to remain an important
institution in supplying scientific evidence for policy making.

5

Overall, the COVID-19 policy frontier appears grounded in extremely recent, peer-reviewed
scientific insights, and science directly drawn by this policy frontier is viewed as especially
impactful within the scientific community itself. Our next set of analyses present the same pattern
but on the other side of the policy-science interface, showing that policy documents that are
grounded in the scientific frontier tend to gather substantially more use within the global policy
network. Figure 2F separates COVID-19 policy documents by whether they cite any scientific
reference or not, and compares the average number of citations from other policy documents. We
find that COVID-19 policy documents that cite at least one scientific paper are associated with a
significantly higher number of citations from other policies, more than doubling its policy use than
those without scientific references. To test if the difference observed in Fig. 2F can be explained
by other covariates, we further use a regression model (see Table S1 and SI S3.3 for more detail)
to control for policy sources, the total number of scientific references, the date of policy documents,
and self-citations, finding our conclusions remain the same (P < 0.001). Together, the results in
Fig. 2 show that, despite the rapidly evolving nature of the pandemic, the policy and scientific
frontier of COVID-19 are closely interlinked, with advances directly along the policy-science
interface being notably more impactful within their own domains.
The role of institutions in the COVID-19 policy response
Figure 3 considers the varied role of policy-making institutions in the global policy frontier of
COVID-19. Analyzing policy documents from three types of institutions (government agencies,
think tanks, and IGOs), we find that overall IGOs produce the fewest number of documents (Fig.
3A), yet the policy documents they produce tend to be most closely connected to the scientific
frontier (Fig. 3B) and occupy a central position within the global policy network (Fig. 3C-E). We
visualize the policy citation network among COVID-19 policy documents in Fig. 3E. Each node
is a COVID-19 policy document with at least one citation linkage to other COVID-19 policy
documents, and two nodes are connected if one policy cites the other. We color the nodes based
on the institution that published the policy (IGOs in blue, think tanks in orange, and governments
in green). A node’s size is proportional to the number of citations received within this policy
network. We also add a node border (in black) for those that draw on scientific papers.

6

The networks convey three primary insights (Fig. 3C-E). First, although IGOs produced the fewest
number of policy documents among the three types of institutions (Fig. 3A), blue nodes are the
most visible within the network, indicating IGOs are disproportionately more likely to produce
hubs within the policy network (Fig. 3F). Second, hubs in this policy network mostly have black
borders, indicating that those that attracted more policy use are also directly grounded in science,
consistent with Fig. 2F. Third, while the connectivity among policy documents is relatively sparse
(2,994 linkages between 2,098 nodes, <kin> = <kout> = 1.43), a high fraction of policy documents
coalesce into the same giant weakly connected component (GWCC, 70.3%), illustrating the
connectedness within the global policy frontier.
To quantify the relative locations of policy documents within the network, we use the k-core
algorithm to calculate the coreness of each node (Fig. 3F inset, SI S3.2). A popular concept to
measure the core-periphery structure of complex networks, k-core is a maximal subgraph of the
original network, all of which are connected to at least k other nodes in the group [27]. Figure 3F
inset compares the distribution of coreness for policy documents produced by the three institutions,
showing policy documents produced by IGOs systematically occupy central positions within the
network, characterized by a high k-core score. More importantly, these IGO documents appear
critical for the global connectivity of this policy network. In Fig. 3G we randomly remove a fixed
number of nodes from certain types and measure the remaining GWCC size [28, 29], finding IGO
documents carry disproportionate importance in connecting the network. Indeed, as Fig. 3E shows,
removing IGOs’ policy documents drastically alters the structure of the policy network. While
IGOs only account for 31.0% of the nodes (Fig. 3C), removing them shrinks the GWCC from 70.3%
to 18.0 % (Fig. 3DG). Contrasting IGOs with other institutions, we find that the effects of removing
policy documents by think tanks or government agencies are not nearly as significant (Fig. 3DEG). Lastly, the fraction of the GWCC decreases to merely 5.77% if we further remove all think
tank policy documents, keeping only those by government agencies (Fig. 3E), highlighting that
policies by individual countries rarely connect directly across geopolitical boundaries.
The effectiveness of local COVID-19 policy responses
Taken together, Fig. 3 shows that the overall connectedness in the COVID-19 policy frontier is
mainly mediated by IGOs, the absence of which alters the global policy landscape. And among

7

IGOs, the WHO plays a dominant role across all 55 organizations recorded in our data (Fig. 3H).
While these results highlight the critical role of IGOs and especially the WHO in policy responses
to COVID-19 [30, 31], they also suggest that the apparent connectivity in the global COVID-19
policy network hides a high degree of isolation at the individual governmental level. Indeed, if we
only consider policy responses by government agencies, individual countries are fragmented into
small isolated clusters, as their COVID-19 policies primarily interact within their geopolitical
boundaries. This suggests that individual countries may differ in their policy response to COVID19 [6, 32], prompting us to examine whether country-level variations in COVID-19 policy
attention may predict country-specific realities of the pandemic.
Therefore, in our final analyses, we consider the COVID-19 policy response at the individual
country level, and explore its correlation with the country’s effectiveness in containing the
pandemic (Fig. 4). For each country in our database, we mark the calendar date when three
COVID-19 deaths were first recorded within the same day [33]. We then measure the country’s
total deaths from COVID-19 over the following 30 days, which approximates the country’s
effectiveness in containing the disease. We further calculate the share of policy attention to
COVID-19 in that country during the prior 30 days, i.e., in the 30 days before three daily deaths
were first recorded in that country. Plotting the results in Fig. 4A, we find a strong negative
correlation (n = 59, P < 0.00001), showing that countries with a greater share of policy documents
addressing COVID-19 experienced substantially fewer subsequent deaths.
Several additional analyses help further assess this result. Specifically, countries with larger
populations may naturally experience greater deaths. Countries with greater per-capita income
may also be more susceptible (e.g., through higher influxes of international travel). Finally,
countries that experienced later onset of the outbreak may have more time to prepare and learn
from others. Table S2 considers various regression models to control for these additional features.
We find robust evidence that greater population predicts greater death and that later onset of the
disease is associated with less ensuing death, which is consistent with global learning about how
to handle the pandemic. At the same time, the explanatory power of a country’s early policy
attention remains robust. Figure 4B shows the ongoing predictive role of a country’s prior policy
attention, net of other controls (P = 0.043). Figure 4C shows the collective power of prior policy

8

attention and the other controls in predicting subsequent deaths, demonstrating the substantial
predictive capacity of this simple model.
We further test the robustness of these findings across several additional dimensions. We restrict
the analysis to countries with higher volumes of policy documents recorded in our database (Tables
S3-S4), examine different daily death thresholds to mark the onset of the disease for each country
(Fig. S7) and consider alternative functional forms (Tables S2-S4). We also adopt alternative data
sources for the COVID-19 tracking data, as provided by the European Centre for Disease
Prevention and Control (Fig. S5D), alter the measures of a country’s effectiveness in containing
the pandemic by calculating total confirmed cases instead of deaths (Fig. S5A), examine per-capita
death rates for each country (Fig. S5B), and restrict the analysis to countries with a minimum
number of COVID-19 policy documents (Fig. S6). The findings are broadly robust to these many
alternatives. Finally, we use an alternative policy attention measure – the stringency index
provided by the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) [6] – which is
developed independently of the Overton policy document database we studied. This alternative
source shows a similar relationship (Table S5), where greater policy stringency predicts fewer
subsequent deaths, and further suggests the robustness of our result.
Overall the results suggest a country’s early policy attention to COVID-19 predicts its containment
of the outbreak. The patterns presented in Fig. 4 are correlations and do not identify causal
mechanisms. Indeed, there are a large number of social, cultural, economic, and political factors
that may influence a country’s response to COVID-19. Yet, despite these many potential
influences and complex factors, a country’s early policy attention provides a simple yet powerful
proxy that closely predicts a country’s effectiveness in containing the pandemic, offering a new
dimension in measuring heterogeneous policy responses and predicting differences in outcomes.
Concluding remarks
While the data used in this paper represents among the largest collection of policy documents
worldwide, there are limitations of the data that should be considered when interpreting the results
(SI S1.4, S3.4-S3.10). First, policy documents from mainland China, where the COVID-19
originated, are notably missing from the data. Second, many policy documents are written in the

9

native language of a country, requiring an additional machine translation step to integrate the
corpus, which was performed at the data source. It is important to keep this language effect in
mind, which may generate differential data quality for non-English speaking countries. It is worth
noting that potential sampling biases in our data are likely to be conservative. Indeed, we repeated
our analyses in Fig. 4 for English-speaking countries only (SI S3.7), finding that the relationship
further strengthens (Fig. S5C). Lastly, the data focus on policy responses at the country level, while
across regions within each country there can be important local differences in response [12, 34,
35], which are not captured by our data.
The data and methodologies presented in our paper are not limited to analyzing COVID-19 policy,
highlighting several fruitful future avenues to quantitatively investigate policies, including their
rich connections to other policies as well as to the scientific literature. Future work may extend
our analyses to other large-scale emergencies or historical events. Equally fruitful is the potential
to quantitatively analyze patterns of policy interactions under normal circumstances, which may
uncover new signals for relevant social economic indicators. Lastly, the linkage between policy
documents and scientific papers opens up new possibilities for understanding how policy and
science interact, which would not only broaden our definition of scientific impact [36, 37], but
also deepen our understanding of the role of science in human society. Taken together, these results
unveil core patterns in the global policy landscape and its dynamics in the COVID-19 pandemic,
opening new windows in our quantitative understanding and predictions of policy responses and
the enormously important outcomes they govern.

S1 Data Description
S1.1 Overton data overview
To understand the global policy response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we leverage a novel dataset
provided by Overton (www.overton.io). Overton data captures among the world’s largest
collection of policy documents [1]. Policy documents are broadly defined as documents written
primarily for or by policymakers, and include documents from government agencies, think tanks
as well as intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) [1]. The data is updated weekly, allowing us to
trace how policy responses evolve in nearly real time. In 2020, the Overton database has captured
over 43,000 policy documents from 114 countries, collecting documents from more than 750
different sources worldwide.
In this paper, we use the full set of policy documents published from January 1st 2020 to May 26th
2020. We use an API to obtain policy documents from each policy source separately. For each
document, we have information on its title, original URL, publication date, document type, policy
source, and subject classification codes.
To identify COVID-19 related policy documents, we leverage Overton’s technical capabilities
which combine translation of policy document into English, with keyword-based search for a list
of COVID-19 related keywords across multiple languages [2]. Note that the list of keywords also
relies on pre-translation to English by Overton (see S1.4 below). While the data cover a large
number of countries, there are two notable exceptions in our analyses. First is the Netherlands.
One empirical limitation is that our access to the API only allows for at most 2,000 results per
query, and there is one country that has exceeded this limit. Indeed, the Government of the
Netherlands (Rijksoverheid) has published over 4,000 documents in 2020, making it impossible
to collect the full set of its policy documents. We therefore exclude Netherlands from our analysis
to avoid potential bias. Second is mainland China. Although COVID-19 originated from Wuhan,
China, policy documents from mainland China are missing in the Overton database for 2020.
Personal correspondence with the Overton team has not pinpointed the reason for this missing data,
but it may have to do with web crawling issues on Chinese government websites [3].

1

We focus on policy documents published by (1) government agencies and think tanks in country
members of the United Nations, and (2) intergovernmental organizations (defined by “IGO” and
“EU” source labels in the Overton data). For the temporal coverage, we froze our data on May
26th, 2020. We noticed that there is an unusual number of documents published on January 1st
2020 (1,036 documents, about 4 times of a normal day), possibly due to default classification to
this date. We further excluded these documents from our analyses to avoid including policy
documents that have inaccurate publication dates. Lastly, since our main focus is on policy
documents, we follow Overton’s suggestion [3] and further filter on the document type by using
only “publications” (95% of the total documents), removing other types such as “working papers”,
“transcripts”, “blog posts”, and “clinical guides”.
In total, we analyzed 7,730 COVID-19 documents out of 37,725 documents published across 114
countries (including 402 think tanks), 55 IGOs (including 4 in EU).
S1.2 Dimensions publication data
We further link the scientific references cited within the policy documents to a database of
scientific publications. For this database, we use Dimensions [4], a recent data product by Digital
Science. Each scientific reference from Overton has a unique DOI (Digital Object Identifier), one
of the most commonly used identifiers for scientific publications. We retrieve papers from
Dimensions API using the DOI information. We find that the vast majority of the references can
be matched to Dimensions records (79,669 out of 84,964 papers, or 93.8% of the scientific
references). For each paper we obtain information on its title, author list, affiliation(s), publishing
venue, publication date, fields of study, references and citations received. Among the papers we
analyzed, 79 of the 79,669 are matched to more than one record in Dimensions; hence to avoid
duplications we keep the single item with most complete records, as determined by the number of
references and citations.
We also constructed another set of COVID-19 related scientific publications by searching for
papers published in 2020 with the following query suggested by Dimensions [5]:

2

"2019-nCoV" OR "COVID-19" OR “SARS-CoV-2” OR "HCoV-2019" OR "hcov" OR "NCOVID19" OR "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2" OR "severe acute respiratory
syndrome corona virus 2" OR (("coronavirus" OR "corona virus") AND (Wuhan OR China OR
novel)),
yielding in total 40,733 papers published in 2020 out of all articles indexed by Dimensions.
S1.3 COVID-19 case and death tracking data
We use country-level daily statistics for COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths from two
independent sources. Our primary data source is the COVID-19 Data Repository provided by the
Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University [6], which has
been extensively used in COVID-19 related studies. To ensure the robustness of our results, we
also repeated our analyses using an alternative dataset provided by the European Centre for Disease
Prevention and Control (ECDC) [7], which includes not only information on COVID-19 confirmed
cases and deaths, but also country-level covariates such as GDP per capita and population (see
also S2.3). In our robustness checks (S3.4), we repeated our analyses using the COVID-19
confirmed deaths reported by ECDC, confirming that our results are not sensitive to the specific
COVID-19 tracking data source.
S1.4 Data limitations
Although our datasets represent among the largest collection of records in their respective domains,
there are potential limitations of the data readers should keep in mind.
The Overton database assembles documents from a large number of sources, hence there might be
potential sampling biases across different document types, countries and languages. For example,
some countries may have more policy documents recorded in the data simply because their policy
sources are more easily accessible, and documents better organized. Given the novelty of this
database, we are not aware of other peer datasets that may help us assess the extent of potential
sampling biases. Therefore, in our analyses, key results are based on comparisons between
COVID-19 documents and all other documents recorded for that country or organization, i.e. the

3

share of policy attention to COVID-19, which normalizes the total number of policy documents
published by an entity.
Furthermore, COVID-19 related policy documents are identified through keyword searches, which
may introduce both false positives and false negatives. Indeed, there have been several other
notable coronavirus outbreaks in the past, such as SARS in 2003, indicating that our keyword
search will also yield policy documents about other coronaviruses than COVID-19 (false positives).
Yet, since our analysis only focuses on policy documents published in 2020, and all other
coronavirus outbreaks took place before 2020, it suggests that the policy attention on coronavirus
captured by our 2020 sample primarily concerns COVID-19. Second, false negatives (i.e.,
COVID-19 policy documents that are not captured by the keywords listed above) may also emerge
from the keyword-based search approaches. Inspecting the official approach used by Overton for
producing their own COVID-19 analysis [8] reveals that the keyword list contains several COVID19 related words not only in English but also some Non-Latin languages (translations based on
Wikidata [9]). Although this list is still not exhaustive, such efforts may help to reduce potential
language biases.
Taken together, there are several potential sampling biases by countries and languages that readers
should keep in mind. However, in the context of regression relationships (e.g., as in Fig. 4 of the
main text), it is worth noting that noise in explanatory variable (e.g., the COVID-19 policy share)
will attenuate the results toward zero, making it harder to find a significant statistical relationship.
Indeed, as measurement errors are likely to introduce noise to our data, they suggest conservative
biases to the regression relationships we observed. Related, in several different robustness checks,
we find that if we focus on the portion of the data that has a higher reliability, the relationships we
observe tend to strengthen further. For example, S3.7 presents robustness checks by separating
English and non-English speaking countries, showing that if we only focus on English speaking
countries (less bias by language), the correlations we observe become stronger. Similar trends are
found in S3.8, where we limit the minimum number of COVID-19 policy documents published by
each country, which again increases the overall correlation.

S2 Methods
S2.1 Field and topic classifications
We leverage field and topic classifications from Overton and Dimensions to determine the primary
focus of each policy document and scientific paper.
Overton uses machine learning approaches to assign fields and topics to policy documents. The
Overton

policy

field

classification

is

primarily

based

on

the

International

Press

Telecommunications Council (IPTC) Subject Codes taxonomy, the global standards body of the
news media. In our analysis, we use 18 top-level fields in Overton and further group them into
three major field categories:
Science & Health: "health", "science and technology".
Economy & Labour: "economy, business and finance", "labour", "prices".
Society & Others: "arts, culture and entertainment", "conflicts, war and peace", "crime, law and
justice", "disaster, accident and emergency incident", "education", "environment", "human
interest", "lifestyle and leisure", "politics", "religion and belief", "society", "sport", "weather".
The Overton policy topic also implements a more fine-grained classification system. For example,
in Fig. 1e, we used this classification scheme and show the top 10 topics by volume, after excluding
one generic topic (“coronavirus disease 2019”).
Dimensions implements the Fields of Research (FOR) classification for scientific papers. The FOR
is a component of the Australian and New Zealand Standard Research Classification (ANZSRC)
system, which follows a three-level hierarchy (divisions, groups and fields) and covers a broad set
of research fields from the sciences and engineering, social sciences, and arts and humanities. In
our analysis, we use 22 top-level divisions as the research fields of scientific papers. Analogously,
as we do for policy documents, we further group 22 top-level divisions into the same three major
field categories:

5

Science & Health: "Agricultural and Veterinary Sciences", "Biological Sciences", "Chemical
Sciences", "Earth Sciences", "Engineering", "Environmental Sciences", "Information and
Computing Sciences", "Mathematical Sciences", "Medical and Health Sciences", "Physical
Sciences", "Psychology and Cognitive Sciences", "Technology”.
Economy & Labour: "Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services", "Economics".
Society & Others: "Built Environment and Design", "Education", "History and Archaeology",
"Language, Communication and Culture", "Law and Legal Studies", "Philosophy and Religious
Studies", "Studies in Creative Arts and Writing", "Studies in Human Society".
S2.2 Policy citation network
We construct a citation network using all COVID-19 related policy documents, where each
directed link A→B corresponds to a citation from document A to document B. Self-citations (selfloops) are removed and only nodes with non-zero degree (i.e. documents that either cite or are
cited by at least one other COVID-19 policy document) are visualized in the network (Fig. 3 of
the main text).
To compare the importance of documents from various institutions, we simulate a random node
removal procedure and study the relative size of the giant weakly connected component when a
small fraction f of the nodes is removed [10, 11]. For each institution type (IGO/think
tank/government), we perform 50 independent simulations.
The relative importance of individual nodes is measured by k-core decomposition [12, 13], where
k-core is defined as the maximal subgraph with all nodes having degree no smaller than k. A node
has coreness of k if it belongs to k-core but not (k+1)-core. Nodes with higher/lower coreness are
located in the core/periphery of the network. We treat the network as undirected (defining degree
as the sum of in-degree and out-degree) when calculating the coreness index.
S2.3 Country-level policy response
We quantify the COVID-19 policy attention at the individual country level and explore its
correlation with the country’s effectiveness in containing the pandemic. For each country in our
analysis, we mark the calendar date on which three deaths from COVID-19 in one day were first
6

recorded [14]. We then calculate the share of COVID-19 policy documents among all policy
documents in a country during the prior 30 days (i.e., in the 30 days before three daily deaths were
first recorded in that country), which approximates the country’s COVID-19 policy attention. We
further measure the country’s total deaths from COVID-19 over the following 30 days (i.e., in the
30 days after three daily deaths were first recorded in that country), which approximates the
country’s effectiveness in containing the pandemic. Both calculations are only possible if a country
(1) has three daily deaths between January 31 and April 26, 2020; and (2) has at least one policy
document published in the prior 30 days. After this filtering, there are 59 countries left, which we
use as the full sample for Fig. 4 of the main text and for the various regression analyses (S2.4).
This subset accounts for approximately 92.3% of confirmed deaths worldwide as of May 30th.
In addition to the share of COVID-19 policy documents, we consider an orthogonal COVID-19
policy attention measure, the stringency index, provided by the Oxford COVID-19 Government
Response Tracker (OxCGRT) [15, 16]. Independent of the Overton policy document database that
we rely on, OxCGRT collects information on 17 indicators of government responses to the
COVID-19 pandemic such as travel restrictions and school closures. All these indicators are
aggregated into an overall government response index (the stringency index), which records how
the response of governments has varied over all indicators. The value of the stringency index is
from 0 to 100 (from low to high level of government action). As of May 31, 2020, OxCGRT
provides the daily stringency index for more than 160 countries. Consistent with our analysis in
Fig. 4 of the main text, for each country we calculate an average stringency index during the prior
30 days (i.e., in the 30 days before three daily deaths were first recorded in that country), which
serves as a separate proxy for a country’s COVID-19 policy attention. The average stringency
index is available for all the 59 countries that we analyze. We find that, although the stringency
index measures policies that are specifically designed toward containing the pandemic, it exhibits
a comparable level of predictive power as our measure (S3.10), which as an orthogonal source of
policy data further confirms the robustness of our findings.

S2.4 Regression methods
We employ an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model to estimate the relations between
the country-level COVID-19 policy attention and the country’s effectiveness in containing the
pandemic. The OLS regression takes the following form:
!! = #" + ## %!,# + #% %!,% + #& %!,& + #' %!,' + #( %!,( + &! ,

(Eq. 1)

where ' indexes a country and &! is the error term. Other variables are defined as follows:
Dependent variable: The dependent variable !! = log#" +,-.ℎ! is the total COVID-19 confirmed
deaths in the logarithmic scale in country ' in the 30 days after three daily deaths were first
recorded in that country (i.e., the following 30 days), which approximates the country’s
effectiveness in containing the pandemic.
Independent variable of interest: The variable %!,# is the share of COVID-19 policy documents
among all policy documents published by country ' in the 30 days before three daily deaths were
first recorded (i.e., the prior 30 days) in that country. In our analysis, we use three different
variations for the independent variable %!,# :
1) %!,# = #2345+! /#788! is the ratio between the number of COVID-19 policy documents
(#2345+! ) and the number of all policy documents (#788! ) published by country ' in the
prior 30 days. Note that, to include country ' in the regression model, the country must
have published at least one policy documents (#788! >= 0) in the prior 30 days and cover
the entire following 30 days (see S2.3 for details).
2) %!,# = log#" (#2345+! /#788! ) is the share of COVID-19 policy documents, now
measured on the logarithmic scale. Note that the logarithmic value is undefined when
#2345+! = 0 . The regression thus drops countries where the logarithmic value is
undefined and only includes countries that published at least one COVID-19 policy
document (i.e., #2345+! >= 1) in the prior 30 days. Alternatively, we consider this
logarithmic regression model but with a dummy variable for country cases where
#2345+! = 0. In this case, we continue to include all countries by resetting the logarithmic
COVID share value to 0 and using the dummy variable to account for these otherwise
dropped cases (see S3.4 for details).

8

3) %!,# = log#" [(#2345+! + 1)/(#788! + 1)] is the COVID share in the logarithmic scale.
As in 1), we add one to both the number of COVID-19 policy documents and the number
of all policy documents before taking the log. This provides a simple alternative to avoid
dropping cases where #2345+! = 0 and is visualized in Fig. 4 of the main text.
Dummy variable: The dummy variable %!,% = +!)*+,- indicates whether country ' has published
COVID-19 policy documents in the prior 30 days. The value +!)*+,- = 1 if the number of COVID19 policy documents published by country ' is 0 (i.e., #2345+! = 0) in the prior 30 days, and
+!)*+,- = 0 if otherwise (i.e., #2345+! >= 1 ). When including the COVID share %!,# =
log#" (#2345+! /#788! ) together with the dummy variable %!,% = +!)*+,- in the regression
model, the dummy variable %!,% accounts for the effects of publishing no COVID-19 policy
documents in the prior 30 days on the total deaths in the following 30 days.
Other control variables: In the regression model, we additionally control for three variables that
may also have effects on a country’s measured response. (1) %!,& = log#" (@+ABC! ) is the GDP
per capita of country ' in the logarithmic scale. (2) %!,' = log#" (ADB! ) is the total population of
country ' in the logarithmic scale. (3) %!,( = +-!! is the calendar day of 2020 on which three
confirmed deaths from COVID-19 in one day were first recorded in country '.

S3 Robustness checks
S3.1 Temporal correlation between COVID-19 policy attention and the evolution of the
pandemic
We compare the share of COVID-19 policy attention and total confirmed deaths from COVID-19
over time, finding a high degree of similarity between the two trajectories (Fig. S2A). To test if
there are systematic delays between the share of COVID-19 policy attention and the pandemic
progress (both cases and deaths), we further calculate the correlation between the two time-series.
To account for the approximate exponential growth of both curves, we take the first-order
difference of logarithm transformation, defined as
E. = log#" F.0# − log#" F. .
9

Correlations between the transformed series suggest that the relationship between the time series
is closest when the time offset, Δt, between the share of COVID-19 policy documents and COVID19 deaths is close to 0 (see Fig. S2B for deaths and Fig. S2C for cases), suggesting a high degree
of synchronicity between the share of COVID-19 policy attention and how the pandemic evolves.
S3.2 Evolution of fields and topics of policy documents and cited papers
In Fig. 1D of the main text, we group COVID-19 related policy documents into three major field
categories (see also S2.1) and observe clear shifts in policy attention related to the pandemic, with
policy priorities shifting from issues in public health to economy and society. At the narrower topic
level, in Fig. 1e and 1f we find a clear decrease in the share of health-related topics and an increase
of topics related to economy and society since early March 2020.
Here, we test the robustness of these observations by looking into data by month and for individual
fields. We find similar shifts in topics of COVID-19 policy documents around March 2020 (Fig.
S3A), with January and February primarily focusing on public health and medicine while April
and May showing more expansive subject orientations and increased focus on social and economic
issues. Further, we calculate the share of COVID-19 policy documents by each field and plot the
results for the top 10 fields ranked by total COVID-19 policy documents (Fig. S3B), finding
similar shifts in COVID-19 policy attention from health to economy and society. Similarly, we
further consider the share of scientific papers cited by COVID-19 policy documents for individual
Fields of Research (FOR). We find a clear shift of COVID-19 policy documents from drawing
primarily upon biomedical literature to citing economics, society, and other FOR (see Fig. S3C for
the top 10 FOR), showing the robustness of our results reported in Fig. 2C of the main text.
Furthermore, we repeat our analyses on the evolution of fields for other (i.e., non-COVID-19)
policy documents published in the same period. We find that the shares of policy documents by
three major field categories (Fig. S4A) and individual fields (Fig. S4B) stay relatively stable over
time, suggesting that the shifts are observed in COVID-19 policy documents only.

10

S3.3 Robustness checks on the use of science and policy document impact
Figure 2F of the main text documents a positive relationship between the use of scientific
references and the number of citations from other COVID-19 policy documents, with policies that
reference science receiving 0.436 additional policy citations on average (more than doubling the
baseline rate). Here we further test the robustness of this result in a linear regression model to
control for the publication date of the document as well as fixed effects for the country and type
of institution, finding that all else being equal, COVID-19 policy documents that cite scientific
papers are associated with 0.322 more policy citations than those that do not (P < 0.001). We also
separate citations they receive into citations from the same institution or different policy
institutions, finding additional citations for both types (0.184 more policy citations from the same
institution and 0.137 more policy citations from the other institutions).

S3.4 Robustness checks on the relations between the share of policy attention and a country’s
effectiveness in response
We explore the relationship between a country’s COVID-19 policy response and its effectiveness
in containing the pandemic by employing the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model given
in Eq. (1), as described in S2.4. The dependent variable log#" (+,-.ℎ) is the logarithmic count of
the country’s total deaths from COVID-19 in the 30 days after 3 daily deaths were first recorded
in that country. The independent variable of interest is the share of COVID-19 policy attention
11

given by three alternative functional forms, namely, the linear share of COVID-19 policy
documents, #2345+/#788; the logarithmic share of COVID policy documents, log#" (

#)*+,#233

);

and the logarithmic COVID share after adding 1 for both numbers of COVID and all policy
documents: log#" (

#)*+,-0#
#2330#

) (see S2.4 for more detail). Here, together with each of these

functional forms for the independent variable of interest, we gradually include other control
variables in the regression.
Table S2. Regressions considering the effects of COVID-19 policy attention on total deaths.

Notes: The dummy variable !"#$%& = 1 if ##$%&! = 0, and !"#$%& = 0 if otherwise. Countries where##$%&! = 0
are dropped in column (4), and these countries are included in column (5) after resetting the value of
log'( (##$%&!/#/00) to 0. Standard errors in parentheses. Significant level: *p<0.1; **p<0.05; ***p<0.01.

In columns (1-3) of Table S2, we use the COVID share #2345+/#788 as a proxy for the share
of COVID-19 policy attention. We find that this COVID-19 policy attention share by itself exhibits
a significant, negative correlation with total deaths (see column (1)). Further, in column (2) we
include the dummy variable +)*+,- that indicates whether a country has yet published COVID19 policy documents and find the negative correlation further improves. In column (3) we include
three other control variables, namely, GDP per capita, population, and the calendar day of 3 daily
deaths were first recorded for each country. We find that the COVID share still has a significant
predictive power for the total deaths after controlling for all other variables.

12

In columns (4-5), we use the COVID share in the logarithmic scale log#" (
the share of COVID policy attention. When including log#" (

#)*+,#233

#)*+,#233

#233

) as a proxy for

) solely in column (4), the

regression drops countries with #2345+ = 0 (i.e., where log#" (
columns (5-6), we include all countries after resetting log#" H

#)*+,-

#233

) is undefined). In

I = 0 for countries where

#2345+ = 0 and use the dummy variable +)*+,- to account for publishing no COVID-19 policy
documents. We find that the negative correlation between the COVID share and total deaths
remain strong and significant.

In columns (7-9), we repeat the regression by using log#" (

#)*+,-0#
#2330#

) as a proxy for the share of

COVID policy attention. We find that the negative correlations remain robust, with a 10 percent
increase in the adjusted COVID-19 policy share variable predicting 3.19 percent fewer deaths.
GDP per capita has no significant effect on total deaths, whereas population size has a positive
effect. Moreover, the calendar day of the first 3 daily deaths has significantly negative effects,
suggesting that a later onset of COVID-19 outbreak is associated with fewer deaths in the
following 30 days. These variables together can explain up to 55.4% of the variation in total deaths.
S3.5 Thresholds on the minimum number of policy documents
We further check the robustness of the negative correlation between the COVID-19 policy
attention in the prior 30 days and the total deaths in the following 30 days (i.e., the 30 days after 3
daily deaths were first recorded), by restricting the analysis to a minimum threshold number of
policy documents that a country published in the prior 30 days (i.e., the 30 days before 3 daily
deaths were first recorded),
Table S3 summarizes the results of regressions where we only include countries that published at
least 10 policy documents in the prior 30 days. We find that the negative correlations remain
largely significant. In particular, we notice from column (9) that the regression coefficient of the
COVID share increases to -0.375 (from -0.319 in Table S2), suggesting that that COVID share
exhibits a slightly stronger predictive power for total deaths in countries that published more policy
documents.

13

Table S3. Regressions considering the effects of COVID-19 policy attention on total deaths for
countries that published at least 10 policy documents in the prior 30 days.

Notes: The dummy variable !"#$%& = 1 if ##$%&! = 0, and !"#$%& = 0 if otherwise. Countries where##$%&! = 0
are dropped in column (4), and these countries are included in column (5) after resetting the value of
log'( (##$%&!/#/00) to 0. Standard errors in parentheses. Significant level: *p<0.1; **p<0.05; ***p<0.01.

In Table S4, we further limit our regression analysis to countries that published at least 25 policy
documents in the prior 30 days. We notice that the regression coefficient of COVID share in
column (9) further increases to -0.467, showing that the share of COVID-19 policy attention in the
prior 30 days in countries that published more policy documents has again a steeper relationship
with the total deaths in the following 30 days. With the smaller number of country observations
that result from these policy document count restrictions, the standard errors tend naturally to
increase in these regressions, yet most specifications remain statistically significant. Overall, these
analyses tend to further support the robustness of our findings.

countries that published at least 25 policy documents in the prior 30 days.

Notes: The dummy variable !"#$%& = 1 if ##$%&! = 0, and !"#$%& = 0 if otherwise. Countries where##$%&! = 0
are dropped in column (4), and these countries are included in column (5) after resetting the value of
log'( (##$%&!/#/00) to 0. Standard errors in parentheses. Significant level: *p<0.1; **p<0.05; ***p<0.01.

S3.6 Alternative measures for effectiveness in response and other data sources
In Fig. 4A of the main text, we presented the negative correlation between the share of COVID19 policy attention in the prior 30 days and the total confirmed deaths in the following 30 days,
where we use the COVID-19 death tracking data provided by Johns Hopkins University (JHU).
Here, we consider alternative measures and show that our results are robust when using total
confirmed cases (Fig. S5A; columns (1-2) of Table S5) and confirmed deaths per million
population of a country (Fig. S5B; columns (3-4) of Table S5) in the following 30 days.
We further leverage a new dataset for daily COVID-19 case and death statistics, provided by the
European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Country-level death statistics
collected by JHU and ECDC are highly correlated with each other. For example, the Pearson
correlation coefficient between the total deaths (in the logarithmic scale) in the following 30 days
recorded by the two data sources is 0.996. Here, we show that our results remain robust when using
ECDC death statistics (Fig. S5D; columns (5-6) of Table S5).

Significant level: *p<0.1; **p<0.05; ***p<0.01.

S3.7 Results for English-speaking countries
To address possible concerns on the potential bias by language in Overton policy documents, we
further performed robustness checks by separating English and non-English speaking countries in
our analysis. Based on whether English is an official language [17], we consider a combination of
three sets of countries as English-speaking countries in our analysis: (1) Countries where English
is a de facto (i.e., practices that exist in reality) official language; (2) Countries where English is a
de jure (i.e., practices that are legally recognized) and de facto official language; (3) Countries
where English is a de facto official, but not primary language.
Out of all 59 countries in our analysis for Fig. 4A of the main text, 14 countries are English
speaking countries. If we only focus on English speaking countries, the Pearson correlation
between the share of COVID-19 policy attention in the prior 30 days and the total deaths in the
following 30 days increases from -0.551 (Fig. 4A of the main text) to -0.659 (Fig. S5C; columns
(7-8) of Table S5), showing that the correlation becomes stronger and remains significant (P =
0.01) without other controls, and despite the small sample size, suggesting the robustness of the
results.

16

S3.8 Thresholds on the minimal number of COVID-19 policy documents
We further focus on the portion of the data that has a higher reliability in our analysis by limiting
countries that have published a minimum threshold number of COVID-19 policy documents in the
prior 30 days. We find that the negative correlation between the share of COVID-19 policy
attention and total deaths that we observe tends to strengthen. Specifically, when increasing the
minimum number of COVID-19 policy documents from 1 to 10, the Pearson correlation
coefficient increases from -0.63 to -0.78 (Fig. S6), and the correlation remains largely significant
when controlling for other variables (Table S6).
Table S6. Regressions considering the effects of COVID policy attention on total deaths for
countries that published a minimum number of COVID policy documents in the prior 30 days.

Notes: Standard errors in parentheses. Significant level: *p<0.1; **p<0.05; ***p<0.01.

S3.9 Robustness checks on the onset of outbreaks
As a reference point approximating the onset of the outbreak, the paper takes the day where 3 daily
deaths were first recorded. Here we present robustness checks on this reference point (Fig. S7;
Table S7). Specifically, when taking the day where the first death was recorded in each country as
the reference point [15, 16], a total of 82 countries are included in the analysis, and we find a
significantly negative correlation (-0.550) between COVID share and total deaths (Fig. S7A;
columns (1-2) of Table S7). Taking the reference point as the day when 5 daily deaths were first
recorded (Fig. S7B; columns (3-4) of Table S7) and the day where 10 daily deaths were first
recorded (Fig. S7C; columns (5-6) of Table S7), the negative correlation between COVID share
and total deaths remains strong and significant, again confirming the robustness of our results.

17

Table S7. Regressions considering the effects of COVID policy attention on total deaths in the
prior 30 days under different reference points.

Notes: The dummy variable !"#$%& = 1 if ##$%&! = 0, and !"#$%& = 0 if otherwise. !23 is the calendar day of the
reference point in 2020. Standard errors in parentheses. Significant level: *p<0.1; **p<0.05; ***p<0.01.

Besides the number of daily deaths, we use an alternative method by taking the day where a
cumulative number of 100 deaths was first recorded as the reference point. After checking the
relations between the share of COVID-19 policy documents in the 30 days before total 100 deaths
was first recorded in a country and the total deaths after total 100 deaths was first recorded in that
country, we find that the negative correlation further improves and remains significant (Fig. S7D;
columns (7-8) of Table S7). Overall, these results support the robustness of our results.
S3.10 Comparison with the Stringency Index
Finally, we leverage an independent measure on COVID-19 policy, the stringency index provided
by the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) [15, 16], to further test the
robustness of our finding on the relationship between COVID-19 policy attention and the
effectiveness in containing the pandemic. For each country we calculate an average stringency
index during the prior 30 days and employ it to predict the total deaths in the following 30 days.
Table S8 summaries the results of regressions that include both the share of COVID-19 policy
documents and the average stringency index together with other control variables. In order to
compare the values of regression coefficients, here we take the z-score for all variables.

18

Table S8. Regressions considering the effects of both the share of COVID-19 policy documents
and the average stringency index on total deaths.

Notes: The dummy variable !"#$%& = 1 if ##$%&! = 0, and !"#$%& = 0 if otherwise. Countries where ##$%&! = 0
are dropped in columns (1) and (4), and these countries are included in other columns after resetting the value of
log'( (##$%&!/#/00) to 0. Standard errors in parentheses. Significant level: *p<0.1; **p<0.05; ***p<0.01.

In columns (1-3) of Table S8, we include alternative functional forms for the share of COVID-19
policy documents and the average stringency index, finding that the COVID share and the
stringency index have independent and comparable predictive power for total deaths. In columns
(4-5), we include both the policy document share and the stringency index and find that they
augment each other’s predictive power and have similar coefficient magnitudes. In columns (610), we include the dummy variable whose value +)*+,- = 1 if a country did not publish any
COVID-19 policy documents in the prior 30 days and +)*+,- = 0 if otherwise. We find that the
predictive powers of COVID share and stringency index are again similar to each other and
augmentative.
In columns (11-15), we further include controls for GDP per capita, population, and the calendar
day where 3 daily deaths were first recorded in each country. After controlling for all variables,
we find that the effects of the share of COVID-19 policy documents remain negative and
significant in columns (11-12). Moreover, the COVID share exhibits a slightly stronger power than
the stringency index in predicting total deaths in columns (14-15). These observations are
encouraging, as the stringency index measures policies that are specifically designed toward
containing the pandemic, which exhibits a comparable level of predictive power as our measure.
Overall these results further confirm the robustness of our results, showing that at the country level,
greater COVID-19 policy attention predicts fewer subsequent deaths.
