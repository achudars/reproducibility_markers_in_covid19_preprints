Abstract
The outbreak of COVID-19 in March 2020 led to a shutdown of economic activities in Europe. This included the sports sector, since public gatherings were
prohibited. The German Bundesliga was among the first sport leagues realising a restart without spectators. Several recent studies suggest that the home
advantage of teams was eroded for the remaining matches. Our paper analyses
the reaction by bookmakers to the disappearance of such home advantage. We
show that bookmakers had problems to adjust the betting odds in accordance
to the disappeared home advantage, opening opportunities for profitable betting
strategies.

Introduction

Playing in front of the home crowd is beneficial to team success in all of sports. Home
fans use supportive chants to motivate their team and scream and shout at the opponent. Referees also appear to be influenced by the audience as their decisions have
repeatedly shown to favour the home team (Dohmen and Sauermann, 2016). These
impacts can help to explain why chances to win a matchup are typically higher during
home than away games. Such home advantage is also a well-known fact to bookmakers,
who price in all information available and hence offer, on average, lower odds for bets
on the home than on the away team.
With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in spring 2020, all professional and
amateur sports had to be cancelled because public gatherings were prohibited. About
two months later, the German Bundesliga was among the first to resume playing, still in
the same stadiums as before, but with fans absent. With games being played in empty
stadiums, the home advantage eroded immediately (Fischer and Haucap, 2020; Reade
et al., 2020). While it took some rounds for this change to become pronounceable, it
upheld until the season finished at the end of June 2020. With the German Bundesliga
being a heavyweight in the betting market, the questions emerges whether bookmakers
adapt their odds concerning the now non-existent home advantage.
This paper analyses betting market (in-)efficiencies in the German Bundesliga for
matches behind closed doors after the COVID-19 break in spring 2020. Our analysis
focuses on the 83 matches1 at the end of the season 2019/2020 in the highest German
football division and compares it to previous seasons. Our analyses show that bookmakers did not change their pricing during the period of matches after the start of
no-attendance games. This opened highly profitable strategies to bettors with return
on investment of around fifteen percent.
The paper is organised as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of the literature on
the home advantage in sports as well as the home bias in sports betting. It is proceeded
by descriptive statistics of our data in Section 3. Section 4 analyses the efficiency of
betting markets before and after the COVID-19 break and strategies generating positive
returns for bettors. Finally, Section 5 concludes with a discussion of our results.

In addition to rounds 26-34, two postponed matches were played behind closed doors.

The home advantage and the home bias

Our analysis considers the bookmakers’ evaluation of the home advantage in football.
We hence first present the state of research on the home advantage in football, to be
followed by the incorporation of the home advantage into betting odds.

2.1

The advantage of playing at home

It is well documented in the literature that teams enjoy an advantage when playing
at home. In football, teams have higher chances to win when playing at home than
playing the exact team in an away game.2 While the magnitude of such home advantage
is more pronounced in football than in other sports (Jamieson, 2010) and decreases to
some extend over time (Palacios-Huerta, 2004), the exact mechanism of why teams
have better winning records at home is still not well understood.
Research agrees that it is not a singly source which generates the home advantage,
but is rather assembled by a combination of different factors, which appear impossible
to be disentangled empirically (Pollard and Gómez, 2014). Since the away team has to
travel, their journey as well as their unfamiliarity with the venue/stadium could reduce
winning chances (Schwartz and Barsky, 1977; Courneya and Carron, 1992). Concerning
tactical formation, home teams tend towards a more offensive style of play compared to
away teams, which could again benefit their chances of winning (Schwartz and Barsky,
1977; Carmichael and Thomas, 2005). Also, referees have shown to favour home teams,
known as the home bias. Such (unintentional) favouritism displays in longer extra-times
when the home team is trailing compared to when the home team is winning (Sutter
and Kocher, 2004; Garicano et al., 2005).3
The recent COVID-19 pandemic opened the opportunity to determine if the home
advantage in football still exists when no spectators are present. The results are unanimous and find the home advantage to disappear once games were played behind closed
doors. Reade et al. (2020) analyse various European football competitions including the
German Bundesliga, while Dilger and Vischer (2020) and Fischer and Haucap (2020)
focus on Germany only. The studies also agree that the referee bias towards the home

teams dissapeared, potentially due to less social pressure of home fans on the referee
(see also Endrich and Gesche, 2020).

2.2

(Miss-)Pricing of the home advantage by bookmakers

Following the concept of efficient markets, asset prices (equivalent to betting odds)
should contain all available information (Fama, 1970). Since bookmakers face uncertainty of events and have to adjust to new information (Deutscher et al., 2018), they
keep a risk premium, referred to as margin. Such margins decreased in recent years due
to increasing competition between bookmakers (Štrumbelj and Šikonja, 2010). Efficient
betting markets imply that market participants (bettors) cannot use simple strategies
to beat the market and make profits, given the margin kept by the bookmaker. Those
simple strategies include systematic betting on, e.g., home teams, favourites, popular
or recently promoted teams.4
As the location of the game has shown to benefit the home team, the betting odds for
home teams are on average lower than for away teams. The again so-called home bias
refers to increased payouts (equivalent to higher odds) for the home team compared to
the fair odds. Such biased odds can arise from the bookmakers inability to predict game
outcomes, their knowledge that fans are somewhat unable to assess teams’ strength (Na
et al., 2019) or their goal to have a so-called balanced book, which is given if wagers
on both outcomes (home and away win) level out such that the bookmakers secure a
profit independent of the game outcome (Hodges et al., 2013). Since bettors rather bet
on underdogs than favourites, bookmakers offer favourable odds on home wins (Franke,
2020). If such bias towards home wins is large enough to exceed the margin kept by
the bookmaker, a profitable strategy would suggest to systematically bet on the home
team. Supporting empirical evidence comes from e.g. Forrest and Simmons (2008) and
Vlastakis et al. (2009).
The COVID-19 pandemic offers an unique natural experiment: The direct effect on
the disappearance of the home advantage in the German Bundesliga is strengthened by
imperfect information of the bookmaker due to a small number of comparable games
behind closed doors prior to the pandemic.5 This leads to the question if and how fast

bookmakers responded by adjusting the betting odds. From the bettors’ perspective
this opens the question if mispricing by bookmakers created profitable strategies.

Data

Due to spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 the German Bundesliga prohibited the attendance of spectators after round 25 on March 9th 2020. By then
223 matches were played6 and 82 had been rescheduled between the 16th of May
and the 27th of June 2020. The Bundesliga was the first of the top European football leagues to restart matches, but without spectators. Match data retrieved from
www.football-data.co.uk cover results and pre-game betting odds for all games of
the German Bundesliga from season 2014/15 until 2019/20. We focus on data covering the current season while using the five preceding seasons as reference to cover
potential within season dynamics. We split the 2019/20 season into two periods, considering matches with and without fans. Previous seasons are separated after round 25
corresponding to the COVID-19 break in season 2019/20 for comparison.

3.1

Descriptive match statistics

Table 1 provides an overview on match results. Prior to the most recent season, home
teams won nearly half of their matches, with an almost equal split between away wins
(29.42%) and draws (25.60%). At the end of a season the number of home wins increases
by more than three percentage points while games resulting in a draw and away wins
are less likely than before. The 2019/20 German Bundesliga season stands out due to
the large number of away wins which is nearly 20% higher compared to previous seasons
even in rounds with spectators. The proportion of home wins and draws is smaller by 2
and about 3.5 percentage points, respectively. While the proportion of draws increases
slightly after the COVID-19 break and equals the amount at the end of the season in
previous years, we find a strong increase in the number of away wins, which are more
than 25% higher than in previous rounds and 65% higher than at the end of previous
seasons. At the same time the number of home wins decreases and is about 25% lower

than before the COVID-19 break and about 35% lower than in previous seasons (see
Table 1). These findings confirm previous results which revealed an eroded home effect
for the German Bundesliga after the COVID-19 break (see e.g. Dilger and Vischer,
2020).

Similar results occur regarding the average number of goals scored by the home
and away team. In previous years, the number of total goals increased at the end of
the season from 2.82 goals on average to 3.06 goals. However, in 2019/20 considerably
more goals were already scored in games with spectators, which mainly origins from
the increased number of away goals. While away teams scored even more goals after
the COVID-19 break, the number of home goals decreased by nearly 20%. For the first
time, the number of away goals surpasses the number of home goals (see Table 2).

Implied winning probabilities and bookmaker’s margins

To determine the precision of bookmakers’ forecasts, we first turn our attention to the
betting odds. As betting odds contain a margin, they have to be adjusted as follows to
obtain the implied winning probability π̂i given by the bookmaker (see e.g. Deutscher
et al., 2013):
π̂i =

1/Oi
, i = h, d, a
1/Oh + 1/Od + 1/Oa
6

where Oi represents the average odds over all bookmakers for home wins (i = h),
away wins (i = a), and draws (i = d).7 The difference in the implied probabilities
ImpProbDiff = π̂h − π̂a indicates whether the bookmaker denotes the home team to be
the favourite (ImpProbDiff > 0), whereas ImpProbDiff < 0 coincides with a favoured
away team. If the (absolute) difference in the implied winning probability between two
teams in a specific match is large, one team can clearly declared to be the favourite. In
contrast, a small difference indicates that the bookmaker assigns nearly equal abilities
to both teams.
Bookmakers use their margin to account for possible mispricing and to remain
P

profitable. Margins for each match are calculated as
Om,i
− 1 for matches
i∈{h,d,a}

m = 1, . . . , M . Table 3 compares margins for season 2019/20 to previous seasons,
indicating that margins are lower in the most recent season. This confirms previous
results and is in line with decreased margins over time caused by higher market competition as argued by Forrest et al. (2005) and Štrumbelj and Šikonja (2010).

Table 3: Bookmaker’s margins before and after the COVID-19 break as well as for
previous seasons.
Furthermore, margins typically increase as the assessment of teams becomes more
difficult, e.g. if the bookmaker expect two teams to have nearly equal abilities. Table 4
displays results of a regression model where we explain the margin for a specific match
by the absolute difference between the implied winning probability for a home and away
win as well as the season. We find significantly lower margins if this difference increases,
i.e. if one team can clearly declared to be the favourite.
However, according to Table 3, there is only a slight increase in the margins at
the end of previous seasons while margins slightly decrease after the COVID-19 break.
While increased margins at the end of previous seasons can be referred to the difficulty

The data set covers odds of between 30 and 56 bookmakers for each match. The pairwise correlation
between betting odds offered by different bookmakers is at least 0.969 for home wins and 0.945 for
away wins.

in the prediction of match outcomes when there are matches with two teams without any
possibilities to face promotion to the international competition or are under threat of
possible relegation, findings on season 2019/20 are somewhat surprising. For matches
behind closed doors, previous experience of bookmakers is fairly low. Therefore the
assessment of teams is expected to be difficult. It could be expected that bookmakers
account for this by increasing margins.

Analysing market inefficiencies

Bookmakers had close to no experience on games behind closed doors, since only a small
number of such games had been played in the past. Nevertheless, as indicated by our
findings from the previous section, they did not account for this increased uncertainty
by increasing their margins. Our descriptive analysis also reveals a disappeared home
advantage, equal to more away wins after the COVID-19 break at the end of season
2019/20 in the German Bundesliga. This opens the question whether bookmakers
incorporated increased winning probabilities for away teams in their odds. Otherwise,
bettors would have been able to gain positive returns when betting consistently on the
away team. In accordance to the home bias as described above, this phenomenon can be
denoted as an away bias. In the following, we provide regression analyses to statistically

8

test for increased chances to win a bet when betting on away teams (especially in games
played behind closed doors).

4.1

Model

Our analysis covers bets on home and away teams since margins for draws only vary
slightly in football (Pope and Peel, 1989). Due to the differences in the winning probability when playing at home or away we include the binary variable Away indicating
whether we bet on the away team (Away=1 ) or the home team (Away=0 ). In addition,
the variable COVID-19 equals one if the match has been played behind closed doors.
To control for possible dynamic changes during the course of the season the variable
Betting after round 25 equals one if we bet after this round. We further include an
interaction term between Away and COVID-19. This term allows for differences in the
away bias between matches with and without spectators. In the second model, we additionally test for adjustments by the bookmaker during the period of matches without
spectators, thus including the Round after round 25 taking value 1 for round 26 up to
value 9 for round 34 as well as an interaction term with the COVID-19 variable.
Efficient markets would imply that neither betting on away teams nor the COVID19 variable affects the chance to win a bet significantly. To test if the market considered
here is efficient, we run a logistic regression model to detect whether any variable beyond
the implied probability has explanatory power on the dependent binary variable which
indicates if a bet was Won. The linear predictor with logit(Pr(W oni = 1)) = ηi is
linked by the logit function and given as:
ηi = β0 + β1 Implied Probability i + β2 Away i + β3 Betting after round 25 i
+ β4 COVID-19 i + β5 Away i · COVID-19 i + β6 Round after round 25 i
+ β7 Round after round 25 i · COVID-19 i .
We use maximum likelihood to fit the models to the data using the function glm() in
R (R Core Team, 2019). This approach follows the concept of various further studies
as Forrest and Simmons (2008), Franck et al. (2011), and Feddersen et al. (2017).

4.2

Results

Table 5 displays the estimated coefficients and standard errors of our two regression
models. The Implied Probability calculated based on bookmakers’ odds has strong explanatory power on the actual outcome of the game, which is intuitively plausible. The
negative and significant effect of Away reveals a home bias for matches with spectators
in the German Bundesliga which is in line with the existing literature. However, there
is no significant change in the chances to win a bet in the last quarter of the season as
indicated by the insignificant effect of the dummy variable for Betting after round 25.
Model 1 allows for a comparison between a bet on a match without spectators and a
match at the end of a previous season with equal implied probability by the bookmaker.
Here we find a considerable decrease in the odds to win a bet on the home team while
the odds to win a bet on the away team are considerably increased.
Model 2 additionally tests for an adjustment of betting odds by the bookmaker
during the period of matches behind closed doors. We do not find significant changes in
the chances to win a bet for subsequent rounds, thus concluding that the misassessment
is not limited to the first rounds after the restart of the German Bundesliga but kept
up for the remainder of the season.

We use the results in model 1 to compare implied probabilities given by the bookmaker to winning probabilities as expected under our model (see Figure 1). The left
panel represents bets on home teams while bets on the away team are illustrated in
10

the right panel. Bets at the end of a previous season (with spectators) are depicted
in red while bets on a game behind closed doors are represented in blue colour. An
efficient market would correspond to the dashed diagonal line. We find expected winning probabilities to deviate only slightly from the efficient market line for matches
with spectators at the end of previous seasons. As indicated by our model, the figure
confirms significantly higher expected probabilities to win a bet when betting on away
teams after the COVID-19 break, while these chance are significantly lower for bets on
home teams (see Figure 1). This underlines that bookmakers were unable to incorporate the disappearing home advantage for matches without the attendance of spectators
into their odds, potentially opening the possibility for positive returns to bettors who
systematically bet on away wins.

Returns

Since the bookmakers take a margin, significant impact of variables aside from the
implied probabilities does not necessarily turn into profitable strategies. Still, our model
indicates significantly higher chances to win a bet when betting on away games after
the COVID-19 break. We use this result to calculate return on investments (ROIs) for
simple strategies, i.e. betting consistently on home or away teams. For previous seasons
we find on average higher returns when betting on the home team (see Table 6). This
confirms the significant negative effect of the Away variable in our regression model.
However, until round 25 the average return is still negative due to the bookmakers’
margin. The increased number of home wins at the end of previous seasons (see Table
1) leads to positive returns of about 6.24% when betting on the home team at this time
(Table 6).
Even if our regression model indicates a home bias over all matches between 2014
and round 25 of season 2019/20, the descriptive analysis shows a considerably higher
proportion of away wins also at the beginning of season 2019/20 (see Table 1). Bookmakers were not able to include this shift into their odds leading to positive returns
of about 5.53% when betting on away teams. As the home advantage disappears after
the COVID-19 pandamic leading to even more away wins, positive and considerable returns of nearly 15% can be generated with this strategy in matches behind closed doors.
Meanwhile, betting on home teams generates an average return of -33.84% (Table 6).

The results open the question whether these considerable returns are mainly driven
by a few bets with high odds, i.e. wins of away teams which can be clearly denoted
to be the underdog, or several wins of teams with low odds. As stated above, we
denote the difference in percentage points between the implied probabilities given by
the bookmaker for a home and away win by ImpProbDiff. While positive values of this
12

variable indicate higher implied probabilities for the home team, ImpProbDiff takes
negative values if the bookmaker denote the away team to be the favourite. Table 7
covers different ranges for this variable together with the number of matches, home
wins, draws, and away wins in this group.

Table 7: Match outcomes depending on difference in implied winning probabilities given
by the bookmaker.
In about 60% of the matches behind closed doors in the German Bundesliga, the
home team was denoted to be the favourite according to the bookmaker, i.e. implied
winning probabilities for the home team were higher than for the away team (see Table
7).8 Considering matches with a large difference of more than 45 percentage points,
we find that only 11 of 16 such heavy home favourites could win their game while nine
out of ten away teams with considerably larger implied winning probabilities won their
game. Focusing on 39 relatively close matches, i.e. those where the difference in the
implied probability did not exceed 0.3, we find 19 away in contrast to only 9 home wins.
Even if the bookmaker denoted the home team to be a slight favourite, we find 11 away
wins compared to only seven home wins in these matches (see Table 7). Accordingly,
bookmakers undervalue the strength of away teams for matches behind closed doors,
especially for balanced competitions.
8

On average, the home team had implied winning probabilities exceeding the value of the away
team by 7.73 percentage points.

Discussion

We analyse the home advantage and its evaluation by the bookmakers in Bundesliga
games that were played behind closed doors. While the number of home wins increased
at the end of previous seasons, it disappeared during the COVID-19 seasons, equal to
considerably more away wins at the end of season 2019/20. Furthermore, the number
of home goals decreased as the number of away goals increased, confirming the disappearance of the home advantage. Our analysis shows the bookmakers’ struggle to price
such change. Their odds imply that the home advantage remained intact and opened
opportunities for betters to generate substantial profits of around 15% when betting
on away teams in games that were played behind closed doors. A more fine-grained
analysis shows that especially in close competitions away teams won considerably more
games than expected by the bookmakers, confirming their struggle to implement the
impact of games without spectators on the home advantage. Returns of presented magnitude are very rare in betting markets and can have significant impact on bookmakers
business as well as other stakeholders. Since many Bundesliga teams are sponsored
by bookmakers, they also rely on efficient betting odds and profitable business for the
bookmaker. Given the high turnover in football betting, the overall impact of inefficient
markets is considerably.
While we clearly indicate that bookmakers were not able to incorporate the disappearance of the home advantage for matches behind closed doors in the German
Bundesliga into their betting odds it remains unclear why there the home advantage
somewhat disappeared in the 2019/20 season prior to COVID-19. Furthermore, the
magnitude of the home advantage and, therefore, also the decrease may not be the same
for all teams, but depend on the team’s popularity or the stadium capacity. Thus, it
would be interesting to extend the analysis to further top European football leagues
as the Englisch Premier League, the Spanish La Liga or the Italian Serie A after their
restart with matches behind closed doors some weeks after the German Bundesliga.
