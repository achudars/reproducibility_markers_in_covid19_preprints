Abstract
In this paper, we analysed real-time measurements of atmospheric CO2 with total electricity
production and nation-wide restrictions phases due to the novel coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic, and
its effects on atmospheric CO2 concentrations. A decline of 3.7% in the global energy demand at about
150 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) in the first quarter (Q1), of 2020 was recorded, as compared
to the same first quarter (Q1), of 2019, due to the cutback on global economic activities. Our results
showed that: 1) electricity production for the same period in the years 2018, 2019, and 2020, shrunk at
an offset of about 9.20%, which resulted in the modest reduction of about (-1.79%), in the atmospheric
CO2, to that of 2017-2018 CO2 level; 2) a non-seasonal abrupt; but brief, atmospheric CO2 decrease by
about 0.85% in mid-February 2020, could be due to the Phase 1 movement restrictions in China. The
results showed that, the reduction in electricity production is significant to the short-term variability of
atmospheric CO2. It also highlights the significant contributions from China to the atmospheric CO2,
which suggests that, without the national restriction of activities, CO2 concentration are set to exceed
2019 by 1.79%, but it quickly decreased due to the lockdown, and sustained the reduction for two
consecutive months. The results underscore the atmospheric CO2 reductions on the monthly time scale
that can be achieved, if electricity production from combustible sources were slashed, which could be
useful for cost-benefit analyses of the reduction in electricity production from combustible sources, and
the impact of these reduction to the atmospheric CO2.

Introduction

1.1

COVID-19 Restrictions and its Environmental Impact
The coronavirus derived its name from the crown of sugary-proteins that envelope the corona

atom (Ather, et al., 2020; Chang, et al., 2020; Han, et al., 2020). The symptoms of this disease is similar
to influenza or the common cold with the accompanying cough, fever and breathing difficulties. The
disease was not globally-spread until December 2019 when it was detected in the city of Wuhan, China.
After the Wuhan outbreak, the disease spread exponentially across all nations of the world claiming
hundreds of thousands of lives, especially among the elderly and immunocompromised individuals
(Ather, et al., 2020; WHO, 2020). In Malaysia, the COVID-19 index case was detected on 25 January
2020. Within a few weeks, the number of detected cases rose sharply (Abdullah et al., 2020),
particularly in March and extended to the end of April 2020.
The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a public health predicament of unprecedented magnitude,
and aside from research work on developing treatment and vaccine, some studies have gone to address
the effects of the “lockdown” due to the pandemic on the environment, (i.e., Abdullah et al., 2020, IEA,
2020, Le Quéré, et al., 2020, Myllyvirta, 2020). The large scale on which the phenomenon has occurred
offers a rare glimpse on the effect of policies, and strategies, on the global atmosphere that would
otherwise be difficult to study. One such global policy is nationwide restrictions on industrial;
educational, and tourism activities, that resulted in lower energy demand, and reduced greenhouse gas
emissions, such as the CO2 (CarbonBrief, 2020; Le Quéré et al., 2020). This abrupt decline in emissions,
could lead to decreased in the atmospheric CO2 concentrations of which this work intends to explore.
In the face of the pandemic, most governments around the world enforced directives, and
legislate orders restricting mobility, gatherings, or meetings. Workers all over the world were ordered to
work from home due to the confinement imposed aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. The
restrictions in movement across nations, states and cities, negatively impacted manufacturing,
agriculture, shipping, and tourism sectors. The confinement of people to their homes, and with all the
industries and factories shuttered, it was observed that drastic reduction from vehicular, and industrial
emissions had a positive impact on the air quality, e.g., (Abdullah et al. 2020), and could extend to an
appreciable reduction in the atmospheric CO2 concentrations.
A report released on the CarbonBrief website, (www.carbonbrief.org) on 19 May 2020, showed
a global reduction of the daily CO2 emissions at 17%, below that of the 2006 across 69 countries,
(CarbonBrief, 2020; Le Quéré, et al., 2020; Peters, et al., 2020). In the recently published work by
2

Abdullah et al. (2020), on the air quality status during the Malaysia’s Movement Control Order (MCO),
the particulate matter's concentrations showed up to 58.4% reduction in concentration, in several of the
areas marked as COVID-19 pandemic “red zones”. A similar pattern was observed in the emission of CO2,
i.e., (CarbonBrief, 2020; Le Quéré et al., 2020). Although, the effect of reduced CO2 emissions from the
atmospheric CO2 has yet to be reported.
In this paper, we studied whether global movement restrictions, and complete shutdown of
most economic sectors, and subsequent decrease in electricity production, and CO2 emissions, reduced
the atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Atmospheric CO2 concentration was collected from a station
situated in a remote location, and the data was then compared with the different stages of the
restriction of activities imposed by high-emitting CO2 nations of the world, like the China, Europe, the
United States of America, and India, and was evaluated against the electricity production data, to
determine if the latter affected atmospheric CO2 concentrations, or not.

2.

Data and Methods
Real-time atmospheric CO2 concentration data was measured from a weather station on a

tropical coast where other parameters such as the mass and energy fluxes, micro-climate variables, sea
surface and water temperature data are continuously collected, and computed. The station is located at
the Centre for Marine and Costal Studies (CEMACS), Universiti Sains Malaysia, (USM), at the northwestern end of the Pulau Pinang Island, in Peninsula Malaysia. This station can be considered, as a
station that measures background CO2, because of its minimally influenced by the CO2 from
anthropogenic sources. The research station is situated on latitudes 5ᵒ 28' 06" N, and longitudes 100ᵒ
12' 01" E. The station was named the ‘‘Muka Head Station’’, where the instruments were mounted on a
stainless-steel podium that was built in 2015, and expanded on a pre-existing jetty. Further details on
the station can be found in the published literature, e.g., (Yusup et al., 2018a,b,c, 2019), and the station
website at, http://atmosfera.usm.my. The station is in the distinctive intertidal zone of a coastal ocean,
on the tropical continental shelf along the Straits of Malacca, in the southern South China Sea, and can
be classified as a narrow and shallow continental shelf (Cai et al., 2006).
Atmospheric CO2 concentration in parts per million (ppm) was measured using an infrared gas
analyser, (model LI-7550, LI-COR, USA), at a frequency of 20 Hz. The high-frequency data was qualitychecked, and processed, using the EddyPro© software, (version 6.2.0, LI-COR, USA), and the Tovi©
software, (version 2.8.1, LI-COR Biosciences, USA). Further analyses were performed, and plots were
produced using the open source R statistical software, (version 3.6.3), and the RStudio, (version
1.2.5033).
The different phases of the world-wide restriction of activities, is defined in Table 1, which
corresponds to the decreased in the industrial activities, and electricity production, which have been
3

associated with the CO2 emissions. Here, only the electricity produced by coal, natural gas, and other
combustibles are considered. This classification was adapted and simplified, from the report of Le Quéré
et al. (2020), where restricted activities were said to have the potential of reducing the CO2 emissions,
and thus, were categorized.
The global energy demands for the first quarter in 2020, (Q1 2020), was analysed using the
available data from the Global Energy Review, (GER), for the year 2020, e.g., (IEA, 2020). The results
showed energy demand reduction in some selected countries, after the implementation of the stricted
lockdown. Total electricity production for the months of November 2019 to May 2020, was obtained
alongside the energy demands data from the GER.
Phase 1 is for the China lockdown, which has the largest drop in the electricity production at 12% in February 2020, as compared to the February 2019, e.g., (IEA, 2020), in addition to China's
contributions of 28% in the global total CO2 emissions, (IEA, 2019). China was the first country to
implement the national lockdown, at the end of January 2020, which led to the nationwide restrictions
of activities. By early March 2020, other regions around the world, also charted positive, and negative
changes; e.g., the United States, with +0.002% electricity production at 14% of global CO2 emissions;
Europe, (Germany, United Kingdom, Italy, France, and Poland, with -13% electricity production at 6%
global CO2 emissions), India with +16% electricity production at 7% of global CO2 emissions, and other
countries, where their respective governments enforced national restriction on all activities, which
further decreased electricity production, and CO2 emissions. This duration is categorized as Phase 2. In
the local front, the Malaysian government enforced the Movement Control Order (MCO), on 18 March
2020, that obligated most industries, and factories, except essential services like the healthcare, and
food industries, to shut down, and workers were ordered to work from home.

3. Results and Discussion
3.1 Reduction in global energy demand and electricity production during COVID-19 pandemic.
Energy is the input of all economic activities, and the expenditure of energy releases the CO2 to
the atmosphere. The COVID-19 pandemic, is anticipated to lower the global energy demands, and
consumption, and thus decreases the CO2 emissions. A decline of 3.7%, at about 150 million tonnes of
oil equivalent, (Mtoe), in the first quarter (Q1), of 2020 global energy demand, was reported as
compared to the Q1 of 2019, due to the cutback of global economic activities in various sectors, i.e.,
(IEA, 2020). The percentage of declined by sources, and the contributed factors, is summarized in Table
2.

China and Europe experiencing the most significant
declines, due to low consumer demands.

Energy demand has declined significantly because of full strict, and partial lockdowns, imposed
by governments around the world. The International Energy Agency, (IEA), estimated sinks in energy
demands of -15% in countries where comprehensive, and strict lockdowns, have been enforced, (IEA,
2020). Currently, up-to-date monthly energy demands data is unavailable to be directly compared with
the atmospheric CO2 concentrations, as a result, the total electricity production, (TEP), is used as proxy
to the energy demands.
The global, or total demands of energy in the form of electricity produced, from coal, natural
gas, and other combustibles sources, for the months of November to May for the three years periods,
i.e., 2017-2018, 2018-2019, and 2019-2020 is presented in Fig. 1. Phase 1 covers the period for the
national restrictions of activities in China, while the Phase 2 covers periods of lockdown for the other
parts of the world, i.e., the United States, Europe, and India. The data shows the seasonal decline in the
TEP during the months of January until May, in each of the periods considered (i.e., from the peak
production of about 580 TWh, at the end of December, to 470 and 490 TWh, in the 2017-2018, and
2018-2019, respectively). The 2019-2020 TEP adhere to the same trend, although for the same period, it
5

is consistently lower by 100 +/- 50 TWh, from 485 TWh to 420 TWh. At the time of writing this paper, no
data was available for the months of February to May 2020.

Fig. 1.

Total electricity production, (TEP), for the months of November to May for three years periods;
Phase 1 is the duration for the national restrictions of activities in China, while Phase 2 is for
parts of the United States, Europe, and India.

From the limited data, it shows that Phase 1 and Phase 2 did not affect the trend of TEP, but
offsets it, to a lower average, at approximately 9.20% from the TEP, if restrictions or lockdowns were
not enforced. Referring to Table 1, the offset is also triggered by the lockdown of China (Phase 1), while
Phase 2 did not further slash TEP. The 9.20% decline is consistent with the overall decrease in energy
demand reported by the International Energy Agency (IEA, 2020). The MCO is unlikely to significantly
decrease the TEP since Malaysia is a small country with low TEP of about 12000 to 13000 GWh monthly
(IEA, 2020). Other reports stated that the significant decrease of over 5% in the Q1 of 2020 global
energy demand has brought about a substantial decline in the CO2 emissions as compared to the Q1 of
2019, which stem from disruptions of transport systems and industrial sectors of the economy, as well
as reduction in products and services demands, (IEA, 2020, Le Quéré et al., 2020, Myllyvirta, 2020). In Le
Quéré et al. (2020), an even more rapid decrease was projected across the remaining nine months of
2020 with the predicted reduction value of about 30.6 Gt of carbon. However, as shown in Fig. 1, our
results show that the cutback in TEP might unfold as an offset reduction, and not a compounded drop in
the TEP.

3.2 Atmospheric CO2 concentrations trends during COVID-19
The monthly-averaged of atmospheric CO2 concentrations in 2019-2020, was lower than that of
2017-2018, and 2018-2019. The differences in the CO2, using the 2019-2020 as base period, is presented
in Table 2. The CO2 recorded an average of 408.69 ppm for the month of January 2020, (i.e., Phase 1),
with a maximum difference of -2.36 ppm, e.g., (-1.67%), for the 2018-2020, and 11.85 ppm, e.g.,
(+0.68%), for the 2019-2020. In March, (i.e., Phase 2), the world witnessed strict lockdowns in most
places around the world, particularly, the United States of America, Europe, and India. There was
reductions in the CO2 ppm recorded, with -7.83, -24.52, and -3.32; for the mean, minimum, and
maximum values, respectively, for the 2018-2020, which is a decline of -1.91%, from the 2018. Yet, the
CO2 ppm recorded for the 2019-2020 period was, -1.91, -17.88, and 6.54, for the respective mean,
minimum, and maximum values, which is a decrease of 0.47% from 2019. The resuming of activities in
March 2020, due to the reduction of movement restrictions in China, suggests that it may have an
influence on the increasing atmospheric CO2 in April. However, this trend is consistent with previous
periods, which indicated that, the increase is a yearly periodic feature, and not due to increased
activities after the easement.
TEP trends, reflect the changes in monthly-averaged atmospheric CO2, e.g., (Fig. 1, and Table 2),
but the largest negative differences, only occurred during the period 2018-2020 at, -1.67%, and -1.91%,
(i.e., an average of 1.79%), in January, and March, respectively. This was not mirrored by the differences
in the 2019-2020, where it was lower in December, and March, but increased by approximately 0.10%,
during the same months of the lockdown. This growth suggests that the 2019-2020 restrictions, had
only a modest impact on the atmospheric CO2. One reason could be due to a cut in CO2 emissions during
the year 2019, due to the widespread adoption of renewable energy technologies in Europe, (IEA, 2020).
The year 2019, was also the first year when the CO2 emissions did not records increase at the rate of 2%
per annum, (Le Quéré et al., 2020). Furthermore, atmospheric CO2 has an average residence time of ten
years, in the atmosphere, and so an abrupt decrease in anthropogenic emissions might not substantially
decrease overall CO2 concentrations, (Ballantyne et al., 2012). Therefore, decrease in the CO2 level for
the 2019-2020, (i.e., 413.55 ppm), is an indication that the lockdown only resulted in modest reduction
of the atmospheric CO2, slightly lower when compared to the 2017-2018 CO2 level, (i.e., 414.32 ppm),
and a little lower than the 2018-2019, (i.e., 413.88 ppm) CO2 level.

To see if there are short-term changes in concentration due to the lockdown, the daily-averaged
of the CO2, for Phase 1, Phase 2, and the MCO was analysed, (i.e., Fig. 2). The CO2 concentration
recorded, was slightly above 408.92 ppm in the month of March, then rose to 424.15 ppm, and 428.59
in the months of April, and May 2020, respectively. Before and during Phase 1, there were consistent
downward trends during the middle of January for the 2017-2018, 2018-2019, and 2019-2020, that
aligns with yearly recurring trends. The concentration then increased after February, which are also due
to the periodicity of yearly CO2 trends. The effect of the offset in TEP, for the 2019-2020, is not apparent
here, e.g., (Fig. 1). Although the lockdown in Malaysia, was comprehensively severe, and strict, with
dropped in TEP to about 50%, from February 2020, to April 2020. The Malaysian MCO showed little
effect on the CO2 concentration as expected. Hence, the CO2 trends reported here are large-scale
trends, and not sensitive to local, or even regional fluctuations.
Aside from electricity production, meteorological parameters may explain some of the seasonal
patterns of the CO2 concentration. The negative association between atmospheric CO2, and the
atmospheric temperature in the first quarter of the year, is due to the effects of radiation perturbation
caused by induction of aerosol, e.g., (Lee, et al., 2020; Xie et al., 2020; Zhang, et al., 2020). The CO2
trends here, supported the results from these authors with the reduction of CO2 concentration recorded
for the period of dryness occasioned by excessive solar radiation, and the absence, or low precipitation
along the western coastline of Peninsula Malaysia. Intense precipitation, has been characterizing the
local atmosphere since the middle of March, occasioned by the Spring Transitional Monsoon, (STM),
that correlates with drops in atmospheric temperatures, which subsequently raised the atmospheric
CO2. Previous reports by Yusup et al. (2019), gave the same positive correlation during the same period.

8

A feature not evident in the monthly-averaged data, is the abrupt but brief CO2 concentration
decrease, in the mid-February 2020, e.g., (Fig. 2). This 0.85% dip, is not apparent in the previous periods
of the years 2017-2018, and 2019-2020, and do not correlate with any atmospheric temperature. The
dip could be due to the Phase 1, (i.e., China's massive lockdown), in which reduction of TEP in 2020 was
12% lower than the year 2019. The following low CO2 concentration, in the mid-February, and March
2020, could be due to the Phase 2. Although, not reported here, the lockdown have also impacted other
anthropogenic emissions primarily sourced from the combustion of fossil fuels, such as the tourism and
shipping subsectors of the economy, which further slashed the CO2 emissions on top of the reduction in
the TEP. After two months, the CO2 concentration approached, and surpassed the season-averaged
concentration in April 2020. Hence, contributions from the 12% decline in the TEP in China has a shortterm influence, on the reduction of atmospheric CO2.

Fig. 2.

Atmospheric CO2 concentration for the months of November to May for three years; Phase 1 is
the duration of national restrictions of activities in China; while Phase 2, is for other parts of
the United States, Europe, and India; the Movement Control Order (MCO), is the national
restrictions rule in Malaysia.

The difference in CO2 concentration for the years 2018-2019, and 2019-2020, emphasized that
the reduction caused by the national restrictions of activities, is for both the years 2018-2020, and 20192020, (i.e., Fig. 3), where it occurred in two instances, e.g., December-January, and March. The large
decline in December 2019, for the years 2019-2020, is swiftly compensated in the January 2020, but the
peak was suppressed by the Phase 1 restrictions in China. After the Phase 1 ended, the CO2 differences
began to rise steadily, while the restrictions in the Phase 2 did not seems to have affected the latter.
9

Again, the Malaysia’s MCO did not affect the CO2 differences. This is largely due to the overall TEP in
China, that declined by 12%, while for the Phase 2 countries, it increased by 1%. These results
emphasizes the significant contributions of China to the atmospheric CO2 concentration. The results also
suggest that, without the national restrictions of activities, the CO2 concentrations are set to exceed the
year 2019 values by 1.79%, but due to the lockdown, it quickly decreased, and sustained the lower
values for two consecutive months before climbing again in the mid-April 2020.

4. Conclusions
Our analysis reports on effects of the nationwide restrictions of activities, decreased in the
electricity generations from the combustible sources, on monthly-, and daily-averaged atmospheric CO2
concentrations. The results shows that the electricity production for the same period in the years 2018,
2019, and 2020, shrunk at an offset of about 9.20%. This resulted in the modest reduction, e.g., (-1.79%)
of the atmospheric CO2, and in the December-January, and March, from 414.32 ppm in 2017-2018
periods. It only slightly decreased from the 2018-2019 CO2 concentrations level, e.g., (413.88 ppm),
likely due to the breakthroughs in the renewable energy technologies, and the increased in adoption of
the renewable energy sources. A novel feature observed here, is the non-seasonal, and abrupt, but brief
atmospheric CO2 decrease of about 0.85%, in the mid-February 2020, due to the Phase 1 restrictions in
China. Hence, the reduction in electricity production is significant on a short-term variability of the
atmospheric CO2 concentrations. It also highlights the significant contributions from China to the
10

atmospheric CO2, which suggests that, without the national restrictions of activities, CO2 concentrations
was projected to exceeded that of the year 2019 by 1.79%, but thanks to the severe lockdown, it quickly
decreased to the lower level, and sustained the low values for two months successively. The results
underscore the atmospheric CO2 reductions on the monthly time-scale that can be achieved, if the
electricity productions from combustible sources were slashed, which could be useful for cost-benefit
analyses of the reduction in the electricity production from these combustible sources, and the impact
of these reductions on the atmospheric CO2 concentrations.
