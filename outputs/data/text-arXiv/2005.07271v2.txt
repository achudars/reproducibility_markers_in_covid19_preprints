Abstract
As the COVID–19 outbreak is developing the two most frequently reported statistics
seem to be the raw confirmed case and case fatalities counts. Focusing on Italy, one of
the hardest hit countries, we look at how these two values could be put in perspective to
reflect the dynamics of the virus spread. In particular, we find that merely considering
the confirmed case counts would be very misleading. The number of daily tests grows,
while the daily fraction of confirmed cases to total tests has a change point. It (depending
on region) generally increases with strong fluctuations till (around, depending on region)
15th –22nd March and then decreases linearly after. Combined with the increasing trend
of daily performed tests, the raw confirmed case counts are not representative of the
situation and are confounded with the sampling effort. This we observe when regressing
on time the logged fraction of positive tests and for comparison the logged raw confirmed
count. Hence, calibrating model parameters for this virus’s dynamics should not be done
based only on confirmed case counts (without rescaling by the number of tests), but take
also fatalities and hospitalization count under consideration as variables not prone to be
distorted by testing efforts. Furthermore, reporting statistics on the national level does
not say much about the dynamics of the disease, which are taking place at the regional
level. These findings are based on the official data of total death counts up to 15th April
2020 released by ISTAT and up to 10th May 2020 for the number of cases. In this work
we do not fit models but we rather investigate whether this task is possible at all.
This work also informs about a new tool to collect and harmonize official statistics
coming from different sources in the form of a package for the R statistical environment
and presents the “COVID-19 Data Hub”.

Highlights
• confirmed cases are related to the total tests and time
• confirmed case counts without number of tests would likely misinform epidemiological models
• national level statistics do not say much about the dynamics of the disease
• a new R package and a COVID–19 web hub with harmonized data is made available

Introduction

In December 2019 the first cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology were reported in Wuhan city, People’s Republic of China. Analyses of patients’ samples collected from their respiratory tract revealed
that a novel coronavirus, later named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS–
CoV–2) is the pathogen responsible for infection (Huang et al., 2020). The disease, officially called
COVID–19 by World Health Organization (WHO) is characterized by higher transmissibility and
infectivity but lower mortality than Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) caused by other coronaviruses (Wang et al., 2020).
Apart of the source of infection, the spread of the virus depends on the transmission route and
general susceptibility of the population. SARS–CoV–2 is believed to be transmitted mostly by close
contact (and further carry–over to the mucous surfaces of the body) and inhalation of aerosol produced
by an infected person. The presence of the virus was also reported in samples from the gastrointestinal
tract (Xiao et al., 2020) but the potential role of the oral–fecal route of infection is unknown. The
evidence of asymptomatic carriers who may unintentionally transmit the virus together with relatively
long incubation period up to 24 days (Bai et al., 2020) increase the risk of viral spread worldwide and
make prevention measures difficult. On the other hand, separation of identified cases, prior immunity
to SARS–CoV–2 or cross–reactivity of human antibodies naturally risen against other viruses would
act as a barrier for virus transmission. The latter is probable as RNA sequences of SARS–CoV–2 are
in 79% identical to the sequences of SARS–CoV responsible for the previous pandemic in Far East
countries in 2002 and 50% identical to MERS–CoV (Lu et al., 2020). All above mentioned issues
would act as confounding factors for any modelling of pandemic progression.
Except of the city of Wuhan where the first reports of COVID–19 were announced in December
2019, there was another outbreak of disease, which took place in January–February 2020 on the Diamond Princess cruise ship with more than 3700 people onboard. As such a great number of people
were locked in a confined space using common facilities, air–condition systems, restaurants etc. and
once the chronology of infections, symptoms and undertaken health measures are known (Nakazawa
et al., 2020; Rocklöv et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020), one can consider this as a unique, naturally–
occurring epidemiological study useful for prediction of mortality, disease spread and other parameters
of the COVID–19 pandemic. Since the virus has spread across the world and new pandemic epicenters
like Italy, Spain, Iran, South Korea and USA have emerged, a multitude of new data has appeared.
Different countries have applied different strategies of testing people for the coronavirus (mass testing vs. testing of selected patients), different testing methods (serological vs. PCR–based assays)
and count of case fatalities (solely SARS–CoV–2 positive tested cases vs. cases with comorbidities).
Therefore, any direct comparison of pandemic dynamics is difficult but still, comparison to a “golden
standard”, which the Diamond Princess case could be considered as, may be useful.
Since the outbreak of the disease a multitude of papers modelling the dynamics of the infection
have appeared, especially on the arXiv preprint server. They are usually concerned with connecting
the pandemic with various epidemiological models (e.g. Kumar and Hembram (2020); Morais (2020);
Singer (2020); Zullo (2020) following a brief survey of arXiv at the start of April 2020). However,
such models of course require data concerning the infected individuals. Furthermore, the media are
bombarding today with two basic numbers (for each country)—the number of confirmed cases and
the number of case fatalities. Given that supposedly the vast majority of people are asymptomatic
and testing is not done as random sampling of the population but due to particular protocols these
values by themselves might be misleading. We can only second Wood (2020) in “Despite millions of
tests having been performed, there are still no results from statistically well founded sampling based
testing programmes to establish basic epidemic quantities such as infection fatality rate and infection
rates. In the absence of such direct data, epidemic management has to proceed on the basis of data
produced largely as a side effect of the clinical response to the disease.” As a motivating example we
present Figure 1 from which we can see that in Italy the case fatality to confirmed ratio is constant
while the confirmed cases to number of tests has been decreasing since around March 22nd . Indeed,
the time period since March 22nd is longer than the median time of 19.5 days of infection till death
(Zhou et al., 2020), so one should already start observing some drop in the case fatality to confirmed
ratio.
Through the case of Italy, this paper tries to investigates the following issues:

Figure 1: Cumulative confirmed cases and case fatalities for all the regions of Italy. Right: Cumulative case fatalities divided by
confirmed cases, left: cumulative confirmed cases divided by the cumulative number of tests.

• With each country having their own reporting standard and testing strategy are these raw
numbers comparable across countries?
• Do these data actually mean what they are being said to be and are they appropriate for model
fitting at all?
Clearly, the curves presented in Figure 1 suggest that a more in–depth look at the raw numbers
is required and that there is a need to put the data in a correct perspective before trying to fit any
epidemiological model to them, especially because the viral dynamics are starting to be inferred from
reported case fatalities (Britton, 2020a; Pugliese and Sottile, 2020; Vattay, 2020).
In this work we approach these issues by looking in detail at the available infection data for individual Italian regions (Section 2) and present the R (R Core Team, 2020) package COVID19 (Section
3) that unifies COVID–19 datasets across different sources in order to simplify the data acquisition
process and the subsequent analysis. Section 4 contains a discussion on what other data would be
useful (if of course possible to collect for the already overworked public services), in understanding
the dynamics of the pandemic. Most regional analyses are contained in the Appendices.

Italian regional data analysis

Italy is a country which is being very extremely hard–hit with the COVID–19 pandemic. It is currently
(as of 13th May 2020) as a whole in lockdown and the medical services are extremely strained. However,
due to this situation it has also very detailed epidemiological data that has been made publicly
available. Its constantly increasing infected and case fatality count has lead us looking in greater
detail into this data, especially as it is used for curve–fitting of epidemiological models (e.g. Kumar
and Hembram (2020); Morais (2020); Singer (2020); Zullo (2020) following brief survey of arXiv) and
presented in public media.
The first hurdle that one comes across is what do the presented counts actually represent. This
seems to be region dependent1 . Furthermore, any deceased whose test result is found positive is classified as a COVID–19 case fatality, regardless of any past or underlying diseases, and this methodology
has been consistently applied in Italy since the beginning (Picariello and Aliani, 2020). It is important
to point out that different countries seem to have different testing strategies and classification systems
of deaths—hence raw counts between countries might not be comparable. Given the huge amount of

tests performed in Italy (2735628 as of 13th May 2020 (COVD19 package), Guidotti and Ardia, 2020)
an important question is: “what fraction of them were serological tests?” as there is no official data
on this. A serological test may not distinguish between a person actively infected with the virus and a
person that was exposed to the virus in the past. Alternatively, serological test may not detect person
actively infected with still low viral titer of anti-virus antibodies. On the other hand, if the protocol
is to test only people exhibiting symptoms and medical personnel, then given that it is hypothesised
that the vast majority of cases are asymptomatic, such a raw count might not be representative of the
scale of the epidemic.
Given the above uncertainties we set out to see how the Italian regional data could be presented
in a standardized manner. Furthermore, we see how the data of each region compares to the Diamond
Princess’ data. We focus on the two values that are being presented everywhere—the confirmed case
count and the case fatalities count. However these should be scaled. We scale the confirmed case
count by the total number of tests performed. Scaling the case fatalities is more problematic. A
common way is to present them as the case fatality ratio but these may be misleading when estimated
during an epidemic (Böttcher et al., 2020). Furthermore, assuming that the vast majority of cases are
asymptomatic—hence not tested and not inside the case count, we are uncertain to what the fatalities
would actually be compared to.
Given, the lack of hard data another objective approach would be to compare the daily count of
case fatalities to the total deceased count for the day. To the best of our knowledge such statistics
are not centrally reported in Italy in real–time. Daily deceased counts (from nearly all of the Italian
municipalities—see Discussion) are available though for the period 1st January–15th April 20202 .
Hence, for this time period we are able to plot the weakly “nearly”-desired ratios (see Section 4). We
aggregate per week to remove daily fluctuations, which obscure the picture. Furthermore, the same
data source provides deceased counts for the years 2015–2019 (for the same time period). This allows
us to also visualize the excess mortality (with respect to the per week average from the past five
years). Beyond this time interval, it is impossible to provide such curves. However, having daily case
fatalities counts and past mortality (this is taken as a constant value equalling the average number of
deceased for 15th April) we are able to plot the (per week) ratio of case fatalities to previous average
mortality. This provides some indication of the magnitude of excess mortality3 . However, it is worth
noticing that when looking at the current excess mortality it could be appropriate to compare with
past mortality peaks (e.g. for UK death toll, the 2014/2015 and 1999/2000 peaks4 , Figs. 1, 5 and 6 of
Thomas, 2020), taking into consideration the causes of death. Here for Italy and its regions, in Figs.
4, 6 and Fig. 28 in Appendix B we compare the current deceased peak with the seasonal start of the
January one.
We should remark that perhaps more focus should be on the cumulative positive test fraction
instead of the daily positive test fraction. This is because the daily fraction is extremely noisy and
furthermore it sometimes happens that this fraction, in the official data source for Italy, exceeds 1.
For similar reasons we plot the weekly scaled deaths and cumulative scaled deaths. The daily counts
are extremely noisy as well.
We plot the scaled daily and cumulative positive test count and scaled case fatalities next to the
cumulative positive tested fraction of passengers on the Diamond Princess. Here we present the graphs
from two special regions in Italy—Lombardy and Veneto. The remaining regions are presented in the
Appendix A. Lombardia is the center of the epidemic, where the cases and deaths counts are the
highest. Veneto seems to be a region where the pandemic’s dynamics are special—it was a region that
very early on undertook population–wide testing and drastic lockdown measures5 .
On all of the graphs the curve labels have the following meaning.
1. (DP) Confirmed Scaled: cumulative number of cases on the Diamond Princess divided by 3711,
the number of passengers and crew onboard
2. (IT) Confirmed/Tests: cumulative confirmed case to cumulative number of tests ratio for Italy

We obtain data for the period 24th February–10th May 2020 and we plot the curves from the
moment of the first death. From both Figure 2 and 3 (and those present in the Appendix A) we
can notice a number of facts. Firstly the daily fraction of infected cases fluctuates very wildly and
sometimes can be greater than 1. This can only be due to some changes in protocols or reporting.

Figure 4: Weekly raw death toll comparison in different age groups between 2020 and 2015–2019 for Lombardy and Veneto.

Similarly, such an explanation seems plausible for the fluctuations in the fractions. In fact, Picariello
and Aliani (2020) report a change in the way positive cases and deaths are calculated on 10th March.
The cumulative case fraction on the other hand does not exhibit such fluctuations. For most regions it
is flat and then decreasing. In a number of regions (e.g. Abruzzo, Basilicata, Campania, Friuli Venezia
Giulia, Lazio, Molise, Puglia, Sardegna, Sicily, Toscana, Umbria, Veneto) on the log–scale graphs the
cumulative case to tests ratio curve seems the peak around or below the Diamond Princess’ cumulative
case curve and then start dropping. The scaled death curves exceed this curve.
When looking at the graphs of the number of tests per day two things can be seen. Firstly, the
number of positive cases closely follows the number of tests (this is clearly visible on the log–scale
graphs and supported by the regression study). We look at this issue in detail and present for each
region and Italy the confirmed cases with respect to the total tests carried out. We also regress the
log(daily confirmed cases) − log(daily total tests) on time (in days) and
log(cumulative confirmed cases) − log(cumulative total tests) on time (in days). The slope of such a
regression can be presented in terms of the half–lives, if it is negative. Such a presentation in terms of
effect sizes is important, otherwise it is difficult to assess if the raw slope is big or small. The linear
model approach means that the proportion of infected behaves exponentially
(daily(cumulative) confirmed cases)) / (daily(cumulative) total tests)) =: p(t) = beat ,
then to get the half–life (for a negative, t2 > t1 ) one takes
2=

p(t2 )
= ea(t2 −t1 )
p(t1 )

obtaining (t2 − t1 ) = log(2)/(−a). For a > 0 one will obtain the doubling time in the same way as
(t2 − t1 ) = log(2)/a. It is important to point out that this is a rather rule–of–thumb approach—our
aim is not to model the dynamics of infections, but rather to visualize and understand what the data

8

in front of us is. These regressions were not performed from the first day, as initially there seems
to be a lot of noise in the tests, the starting time considered is visible in each graph—where the
fitted line with prediction confidence band is fitted. We performed a regression for both the daily and
cumulative counts. For some regions (Molise, Valle d’Aosta) no regression is performed as the daily
counts seem to noisy. Secondly, one can very clearly identify days when something must have changed
due to the testing methodology in the Emilia Romagna region—there are huge dips in the numbers
of tests performed. Hence, for this region the dates 28th –30th March were removed for the regression
estimation. In the Basilicata and Calabria regions spikes to 0 can also be observed—these are also
removed, as on the log scale would result in infinite values which cannot be handled by the regression
procedure in lm(). However such dips require careful investigation.
The directly plotted death toll in Figs. 4, 5 and 28 shows that in the regions Emilia–Romagna,
Lombardia, P.A. Bolzano combined with P.A. Trento and Valle d’Aosta there is a larger current (spring
2020) mortality peak than the past December/January (2015–2020 are plotted separately) maximum
one. In the regions Liguria, Marche and Piemonte such a larger current peak is present for men only.
In the other regions for all age groups and both men and women the current “COVID–19 peak” seems
to be approximately of the same height, or lower, than past December/January (2015–2019) maximum
ones. Looking at Italy for men and both sexes combined it is higher, but women seem to have the
same peak height. However, it must be stressed that this is only considering the peak’s height, not
the total amount of deceased during the current peak and the December/January ones.

COVID-19 R package

We used the, available on CRAN, COVID19 R package for the purpose of obtaining the data6 . The
package unifies COVID–19 datasets across different sources in order to simplify the data acquisition
process and the subsequent analysis. COVID–19 data are pulled in real time and merged with demographic indicators from several trusted sources including but not limited to: Johns Hopkins University
Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE)7 ; World Bank Open Data8 ; World Factbook
by CIA9 ; Ministero della Salute, Dipartimento della Protezione Civile10 ; Istituto Nazionale di Statistica11 ; Swiss Federal Statistical Office12 ; Open Government Data Zurich 13 . Besides worldwide data,
the dataset includes fine–grained data for the Diamond Princess, Switzerland and Italy. At the time
of writing, these include the number of confirmed cases, deaths and tests, total population, population
ages 0–14, 15–64 and 65+ (% of total population), median age of population, population density per
km2 , population mortality rate. Depending on the data provider, the data are available at the country
level, state level, or city level. For non R users, the combined datasets are available in csv format14 .

Discussion or Should we use these data to calibrate
epidemiological models?

In this work we analyzed in depth the two statistics that are commonly reported for the currently
ongoing COVID–19 pandemic—the number of confirmed cases and the number of case fatalities for
the different regions of Italy. We found significant variability between regions but also some common
insights. In particular, the number of confirmed cases is clearly related to the number of tests and
their ratio seems to be decaying for some time now in all regions. This is confirmed when looking

at the log–scale plot. The difference between the logarithm of the cumulative number of tests and
the logarithm of the cumulative number of confirmed seems to be (visually) dropping linearly (apart
from the below, extremely noisy ones) regions and Italy as a whole. Furthermore, for a number of
regions (Molise, Valle d’Aosta), on the log scale, the tests, total, positive and difference behave very
chaotically, suggesting rather various test handling situations, than any pattern. Such oscillations can
be visible in all regions at the initial stages, but they settle down (apart from the previously mentioned
three regions). However, in regions with seemingly well–behaved curves individual huge dips can be
observed (Emilia-Romagna, Marche). Therefore, reports claiming the growth of the epidemic based
only on the increasing number of confirmed individuals will not be catching its dynamics.
Furthermore, studying daily positively tested counts could be misleading. On a number of days
we found (for some regions) that this count was greater than the number of tests performed. This can
certainly be understood, as the result of reporting procedures, in a crisis situation. However, this also
implies that any statistical analysis or modelling of such data has to be done very carefully. We find
that the cumulative positively tested fraction behaves much more stably, even though in the official
cumulative counts decreases can be observed.
More importantly, using the raw confirmed case counts one could risk combining the sampling
effort with the actual disease spread. In our regressions, for the logarithm of the ratio confirmed cases
to total tests on time the fitted slopes are all negative (indicating that the virus is receding and this
was observed also by Corica and Vito (2020)).
Furthermore, these slopes are steeper than the slopes of the logarithm of the raw confirmed case
counts on time. With the exceptions of Lazio, P. A. Bolzano the 95% confidence intervals for these
two slopes do not overlap, or overlap very slightly. The ratios of the two slopes lie between 1.176
(P. A. Bolzano) and 3.717 (Piemonte). We report these ratios alongside the slope estimates in the
captions of Figs. 7—27. This means that the number of confirmed cases will be confounded by the
number of performed tests and cannot be analyzed without them as a point of reference.
Hence, the raw confirmed case counts are not representative of the virus’ infection dynamics. The
logarithm of the fraction of confirmed cases to total tests is modelled well by a linear function with
an increasing number of daily tests being performed and has a steeper slope than the logarithm of the
confirmed case counts. Drawing conclusions from raw confirmed case data would seem to be mixing–in
the study of the sampling effort (it is important to stress that we do not make any statements here
concerning the interpretation of the confirmed cases to tests fraction). Therefore, calibrating model
parameters for this virus’s dynamics should not be done based solely on confirmed case counts, but
maybe rather also on case fatalities or hospitalization data (given that classification protocols are taken
into account) as, e.g., Britton (2020a); Pugliese and Sottile (2020); Vattay (2020) do. In fact, already
Flaxman et al. (2020), critised (as, Pugliese and Sottile, 2020, later also did following them) looking
at case counts and postulated a focus on the “observed deaths” while Vattay (2020) writes that “the
cumulative number of deaths can be regarded as a master variable”. Britton (2020b) developed an
estimation methods based on the cumulative reported number of case fatalities.
On the other hand, we also looked at the ratio of case fatalities to the number of deceased per day.
This has the analytical advantage, of referring to something certain and well measured, detailed records
are collected (sooner or later) on the exact number of deceased in a given time period. Here, there is
hardly any chance of missing asymptomatic (of being dead) people. If the assumption, mentioned in
the Introduction, that a significant proportion of the tests are serological is true, then the ratio of case
fatalities to all deceased should be telling us something about the cumulative proportion of infected
individuals. Our graphs (especially on the log–scale) do not contradict this, while the cumulative
proportion of confirmed cases changes very slowly, the ratio of case fatalities to total deceased per
day seems to look like an epidemic growth curve. Since Italy has very high quality data on the case
fatalities, this data could be further studied to assess the dynamics of the pandemic (e.g. Morais (2020)
uses the raw death counts for assessing the dynamics of the pandemic, albeit at the country level).
This seems to be supported by that if one compares the curves to a potential “gold standard”—the
cumulative fraction of confirmed cases on the Diamond Princess, then the case fatalities ratio seems
to shadow this curve (on the initial part when the epidemic was taking place on the cruise ship and
for some regions like Emilia–Romagna or Lombardia) but exceeds it. One could hope that once all
curves would flatten at the same level, then the epidemic will reach the plateau. Unfortunately, at the
level of some (e.g. Emilia–Romagna or Lombardia) of the regions, the scaled case fatalities grew and

10

exceeded both the Diamond Princess and cumulative fraction of confirmed cases.
We also compared the regional results to the same curves for the whole of Italy, Figure 5. On the one
hand the same patterns are visible—the number of confirmed cases are related to the testing effort,
the case fatalities exceeding the Diamond Princess’ cumulative confirmed cases and the confirmed
cases fraction seems to be stabilizing around the Diamond Princess’ and then dropping. However,
these graphs completely miss the regional variation. This is particularly visible when looking at
the total death tolls directly Figs. 6 and 28. Combined Italy shows a visible increase in the death
toll during the March–April period compared to previous years and the seasonal December/January
peak. However, this peak is driven by particular regions Emilia–Romagna, Lombardia and Piemonte
(Liguria, Marche, P.A. Bolzano combined with P.A. Trento and Valle d’Aosta also show a big increase–
but in raw numbers are much lesser than the other three). All the other regions’ peak is on the same
level or lower than the December/January one and for some the death toll is on similar levels to the
March–April one from previous years. Furthermore, looking at epidemiological country level data
would be especially misleading for Italy as Lombardy acted differently from Veneto in terms of their
testing strategies.
We believe that our presented view on the Italian regional data gives some insights how the
pandemic data reporting can be improved (if of course given the difficult situation it would be possible
in practise). For the confirmed cases count a break–down should be provided, how many of these were
medical personnel, how many had symptoms, how many were seriously hospitalized, how many were
tested for other reasons (e.g. after contact). Similarly for the number of tests carried out and their
type (serological or not). The case fatalities counts, should also be put in perspective—with a report
of how many people died in total on the given day and how many deceased were tested negatively.
This would allow for estimating excess mortality (crudely—compared to previous years’ average or
more exactly if number of deaths for the given time period are available) and for correct scaling to
compare to other ratios. In fact in the time period 1st January–15th April we are able to visualize
the excess mortality directly—the number of deceased (in each week) in 2020 to the average from the
past five years. The dataset is based on the 7904 Italian municipalities.
To the best of our knowledge the presented here counts are at the moment the best available data
that can be used for scaling and putting the deceased counts in Italy in perspective. The death counts
seem to be collected in a consistent manner, both the number of case fatalities and the (used here)
population death counts. This means that such counts could be used as a proxy for monitoring the
dynamics of the virus.
It is also a question whether the Diamond Princess can be considered as a gold–standard. Certainly
at the beginning it seems to behave like the other presented here curves. However, the data very quickly
ends, when the passengers were disembarked. We do not know if it reached the plateau or would have
still grown. The confirmed case ratio seems to usually stay below/around this curve, slightly go above
and then drop. Scaled case fatality curves exceed the curve.
Finally, the counting methodology should be made readily available for easy comparison between
different countries. While of course each country is free to follow their own protocol, without putting
numbers into context one can analyze data in an over–pessimistic or over–optimistic way. The effect of
different counting methods is pointed out by Picariello and Aliani (2020); ?); ?, when fitting parameters
to the confirmed case counts (in Lombardy, Bergamo and Brescia), one has a change of coefficients
following 10th March and 17th March, the latter can be possibly due to containment measures, but
the former the authors are convinced is due to a change in the counting methodology. We have also
abstained here from fitting any models to the data (the regression performed does not have as an
aim modelling but formally testing what the respective curve could be telling us). It is known that
due to different protocols between regions and changes in the protocols with time, the data is not
homogeneous. In order to fit any model one would have to obtain documentation what were the
measurement strategies for each region in the time periods. In fact, when Alberti and Faranda (2020)
modelled the cumulative number of infections in Italy through time (obtained using the COVID19
package), they performed fits to date separately in different time intervals which corresponded to
various government introduced confinement measures.

Figure 22: Comparison of curves for Sardegna region. Left: y–axis on normal scale, right: on logarithmic scale. Regression line shown for log(daily confirmed) − log(daily tested) ∼ time with 95% prediction band. Slope of regression with
95% confidence interval: af = −0.092(−0.105, −0.078), this corresponds to a half–life (in days) of 7.573(6.599, 8.884). The
slope of the regression log(daily confirmed) ∼ time is araw = −0.058(−0.072, −0.044) corresponding to a half–life (in days) of
11.902(9.603, 15.649). The slope of the regression log(daily tests) ∼ time is 0.031(0.023, 0.026) corresponding to a doubling time
(in days) of 22.193(26.372, 30.382). Ratio of slopes for af /araw = 1.572, with corresponding half–lives’ ratio: 0.636. The slope of
the regression log(cumulative confirmed) − log(cumulative tested) ∼ time is −0.030(−0.031, −0.028) corresponding to a half–life
