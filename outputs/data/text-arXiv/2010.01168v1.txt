Overview
The novel Coronavirus COVID-19 spreading rapidly
throughout the world was recognized by the World Health
Organization (WHO) as a pandemic on March 11, 20201. This
white paper looks at the initial impacts COVID-19 has had on
transportation systems in the metropolitan area of New York,
which has become the U.S. epicenter of the coronavirus.
As of March 29, confirmed coronavirus cases in the United
States surpassed 140,000, and of those, 2,467 people have
died2 . New York has the highest number of confirmed cases
(59,513 confirmed cases as of March 293) in the United States,
followed by its neighboring state New Jersey with 16,636
confirmed cases4.

With social distancing policies in place, the COVID-19
outbreak has dramatically changed travel behavior. The
C2SMART research team at NYU has been investigating
temporal changes in travel trends and reviewed the initial
impact of COVID-19 on the metropolitan area of New York’s
transportation system before and after the issuance of stay-athome orders. Tolled vehicle trips, transit ridership, travel time,
weigh-in-motion data, crash rate, and parking citations were
analyzed. Note that all data is preliminary.
Timeline
New York State's first case of the coronavirus was reported on
March 1st. Since then, several regional and national policies
have taken shape in the area impacting the population’s
transportation. Table 1 shows the timeline of government
responses in the metropolitan area of New York.

The Stay-at-home Effect on Volumes & Ridership
MTA Facilities
The Stay-at-home orders caused an immediate direct impact on
usage of Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA)
services, the largest public transit authority in the US, which
typically carries over 11 million transit riders on an average
weekday. Its bridges and tunnels serve more than 800,000
vehicles each weekday and carry more traffic than any other
bridge and tunnel authority in the nation5. As the stay-at-home
order took effect, ridership data show steep declines in both
transit ridership and vehicular traffic. The decline rates reached
up to 94% in peak transit ridership as of March 23rd, and up to
72% in vehicle traffic through MTA bridges and tunnels as of
March 29th, compared to the same date/week in 2019 (Table 2).

The number of positive cases in New York City (NYC), along
with the daily changes in subway turnstile entries and tolled
traffic on MTA bridges and tunnels, are illustrated in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Daily changes in the number of positive cases in NYC,
subway turnstile entries and traffic on MTA bridges and tunnels
The above figure shows the accelerated declines through the
first month of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly after
March 16th, when new guidelines urging people to avoid social
gatherings of more than 50 people were issued and schools, bars
and restaurants were closed. Most of the subway stations saw a
dramatic decrease in ridership as the week of March 8th. For
example, Time Square station had a ridership decline of 39.6%,
81.4%, and 92.2% as of the week of March 8th, 15th and 22nd,
respectively. The impact of closing non-essential businesses,
March 22nd, is also noticeable in the use of both modes.
Travel Time Trends
The reduction of trips has resulted in a dramatic reduction in
average travel times as well. Travel times across the 495
connecting the NJ highway network to the Lincoln Tunnel,
across Manhattan and across 34th Street to the Queens-Midtown
Tunnel into Long Island, were analyzed in Figure 3.

Overall, the stay-at-home policies have had a significant impact
on average travel times on the 495 corridor. In the eastbound
direction, travel times averaged 30.2 minutes for the week of
March 23rd (the first week of the stay-at-home policies)
compared to 48.7 minutes during the 3rd week of February, a
38.0% drop. The decreases during peak hours were even more
extreme: travel times were down by an average of 54.3% during
AM peak and 61.2% during PM peak on average, compared
with February. Figure 4 shows how instead of typical spikes of
morning and evening congestion, a flatter travel time pattern is
observed, indicating that volumes remain below system
capacity throughout the day. Variability in travel time has
dropped as well: travel times for Mondays/Tuesdays in
February showed a standard deviation of 14.7/19.0 minutes
respectively, compared to 6.5, 2.8, and 1.7 minutes on March
16th (50+people gathering banned), 20th (NJ shutdown of all
non-essential business), and 23rd (after “NYS on PAUSE”).

Mode Shift to Cycling
A temporary mode shift to cycling was observed in the first ten
days in March prior to the issuance of the stay-at-home order.
Based on NYCDOT data, cycling traffic had a 55% uptick
compare to the same period last year over the Brooklyn,
Manhattan, Williamsburg and Queensboro bridges8. Ridership
soon went down due to the stay-at-home order, however
Citibike reported that its stations directly adjacent to hospitals
exhibited a significant ridership increase9. As a result, Citibike
launched its Critical Workforce Membership Program.
Crash Reductions due to Reduced Volumes
According to NYPD’s Motor Vehicle Collisions crash reports,
while the overall crash rate in NYC was already decreasing in
the first three months of 2020 compared to 2019, the decrease
after March 16th (with stay-at-home policies in place) was even
more significant (Figure 5). Police data shows that motor
vehicle collisions were down by an average of 50% in March
(8,629 events), compared to the same period in 2019 (17,308
events). Between March 25th and 30th, the number of reported
crashes was down by 70-77%, likely due to the reduction in
vehicle trips. A 51% reduction in pedestrian injury/fatality and
31% in cyclist injury/fatality in crashes was also observed.

government orders
Weigh-in-Motion (WIM) Data from the BQE
C2SMART is tracking truck volumes and weights from weighin-motion (WIM) systems installed on its Urban Roadway
Testbed on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE) 7 to
observe effects on trucks moving through New York City.
Some initial data has been collected on traffic volume, travel
speed, and gross vehicle weight (GVW). Note that this data is
preliminary to illustrate trends and is still being validated.

Volume: After 3/13, total traffic dropped by 30%
(Queensbound [QB]), and 29% (Staten Island-bound
[SIB]) for the rest of March. However, truck traffic appears
to have dropped less than all traffic (15% QB; 19% SIB).
Speeds: The reduction of trips increased average vehicle
speeds by 11% (QB) and 24% (SIB). WIM data shows that
the typical speed range on this section of the BQE
increased by approximately 5mph for both QB and SIB.
Gross vehicle weight (GVW): WIM data does not show a
large change to GVWs; however, the number of heavy
trucks (>80 kips) as well as the maximum GVW appear to
have gone down: 20% reduction for QB and 14% reduction
for SIB. This shows that while there are fewer trips, the
loads of these trips are also likely lower.

Parking Citations
The number of parking citations issued in NYC for commercial
vehicles10 were down by 26.1% but remained nearly the same
(1.1% increase) for passenger vehicles during the third week of
March (3/16 to 3/22) compared to the 3rd week of March in
2019 (Figure 6). Although parking meters remained in effect
during the outbreak, right after the issuance of “NYS on
PAUSE” on March 22nd, citations were down 74.0% and 64.3%
percent for commercial and passenger vehicles, respectively, on
March 23-24, compared to the same Monday/Tuesday in the
fourth week of March in 2019. Fewer vehicular trips may be
contributing to the decrease of citations as more curbside
parking spaces became available, but lifting of alternate side
parking regulations or other changes in enforcement during the
COVID-19 crisis may also be impacting the totals.

Summary of Findings
One month into the COVID-19 pandemic, the metropolitan area
of New York has seen a radical change in travel patterns.
Transit ridership and motor vehicle trips are significantly down,
and as a result less congestion and fewer reported traffic crashes
are observed. Some trip reductions seem to reach the floor at
the end of March. While trip reductions have led to faster and
safer trips for essential trips, the foregoing declines in transit
ridership and vehicular traffic using tolled roadways will also
result in massive shortfalls in revenue for transportation
agencies. C2SMART researchers are continuing to collect data
and monitor these trends as this crisis goes on.
Note: all data is preliminary and subject to change.
