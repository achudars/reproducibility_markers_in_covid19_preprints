To evaluate the effectiveness of the containment on the epidemic spreading of the new Coronavirus
disease 2019, we carry on an analysis of the time evolution of the infection in a selected number
of different Countries, by considering well-known macroscopic growth laws, the Gompertz law, and
the logistic law. We also propose here a generalization of Gompertz law. Our data analysis permits
an evaluation of the maximum number of infected individuals. The daily data must be compared
with the obtained fits, to verify if the spreading is under control. From our analysis it appears that
the spreading reached saturation in China, due to the strong containment policy of the national
government. In Singapore a large growth rate, recently observed, suggests the start of a new strong
spreading. For South Korea and Italy, instead, the next data on new infections will be crucial to
understand if the saturation will be reached for lower or higher numbers of infected individuals.

INTRODUCTION

The epidemic spreading of the new Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [1] is producing the strongest containment attempt in recent history. In many Countries
world-wide millions of people are forced to live in isolation and in difficult conditions. In this work we focus on
the Countries that first experienced the pandemic, that
are China (where the infection appears now under control), and then South-Korea, Singapore, Italy (that show
different degrees of containment effectiveness).
Since the mechanisms of COVID-19 spreading are not
completely understood, the number of infected people is
large, and the effects of containment are evaluated essentially on an empirical basis. Therefore, a more quantitative analysis of the epidemic spreading can be interesting.
In the literature there is a large number of mathematical
models (see for example [2–5]).
However, in our opinion, this stage of the disease does
not permit a detailed comparative analyses, since the
available data consist of the number of infected patients
in different geographic areas, as shown in Fig. 1 for China
and in Fig. 2 for South Korea and Italy [6], with different
social, political and economical structures.
In other words, one has “coarse-grained” information
and detailed “microscopic” studies that are, at the moment, of limited use since they have a larger number of
free parameters with respect to macroscopic approaches,
difficult to determine in a reliable way.
Moreover, there is an impressive number of experimental verifications, in many different scientific sectors,
that coarse-grain properties of systems, with simple laws
with respect to the fundamental microscopic algorithms,
emerge at different levels of magnification providing important tools for explaining and predicting new phenomena.
Therefore, an analysis based on macroscopic laws can
be useful to understand the behavior of growth rate of
the infection and to verify if its containment is indeed

working.
A general classification of macroscopic growth laws is
reported in Refs. [7, 8]. In the present study we focus on well-known laws: the Gompertz law (GL) [9], a
new proposed generalized GL (GGL) and the logistic law
(LL) [10], which will be compared with the exponential
spreading, which means that the containment efforts have
no effect.
The GL [9], initially applied to human mortality tables
(i.e. aging) and tumor growth [17, 18], also describes kinetics of enzymatic reactions, oxygenation of hemoglobin,
intensity of photosynthesis as a function of CO2 concentration, drug dose-response curve, dynamics of growth,
(e.g., bacteria, normal eukaryotic organisms). The GGL
is the generalization of the GL.
The LL [10] has been applied in population dynamics, in economics, in material science and in many other
sectors.
The previous laws differ in the description of the virus
containment effects, which in the LL is stronger (power

logarithmic decrease of the specific growth rate (see appendix A).
For a discussion of the COVID-19 data, one has to
know that each of the considered macroscopic laws is
g
characterized by two important parameters, αg , N∞
, for
l
the GL, αl , N∞ for the LL, and by three parameters, αgg ,
gg
N∞
and β for the GGL (the mathematical details are
reported in appendix A). The meaning of the parameters
is crucial to understand the evolution of the epidemic
spreading.
The parameters αg , αgl , αl describe the specific rate
of the initial exponential growth, after which there is a
slowdown of the disease, due to contrast mechanisms. In

particular, N∞
, N∞
, N∞
, called carrying capacities, fix
the maximum number of infected people in the models.
The contrast effect, mathematically represented by the
second term in Eqs. (A1), (A2) and (A3), depends on
many possible mechanisms of pathological and political
origin (medical cure, biological conditions, isolation, information, et cetera).
It should be clear that the present analysis does not
give any specific indication in this respect, however the
g

fitted value of N∞
, N∞
and N∞
tell us how far is the
disease evolution from the saturation point where the
restraint effort is such that the spreading is practically
over.
Indeed, a fit of the available data by GL, GGL and LL
determines the values of the corresponding parameters,
giving information on the possible behavior of the spreading, although the total number of infected people remains
unknown, due to the large number of (a) untested, (b)
paucisymptomatic and (b) fully asymptomatic population.
We apply the analysis to China, South Korea, Italy
and Singapore since one needs the number on infected
people in a large enough time interval for a reliable fitting
procedure. Furthermore, those Countries are at sharply
different stages of the spreading, with China essentially

DATA ANALYSIS

The cumulative number of infected people, in the different Countries, is used to describe the evolution of the
infection spreading. However, the reliability of the data
could depend on the status of the spreading also: in
China, where the counting of the infected people has been
going on for a long time, the data are stable, and one does
not expect any systematic error due to external limiting
factors.
On the other hand, in Italy, not dynamical factors
could reduce the effective number of infected people. If,
for example, the number of available kits (swabs) to detected the disease has a maximum number per day, one
cannot detected, in a single day, a larger number of infected individuals [11].
Moreover the asymptomatic population is unknown
and any estimate is strongly model dependent [12–14].
It should be clear that the variable N (t) does not describe the total infected population but its time dependence includes, in an effective way, the dynamics among
symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals [13, 14] and
therefore it is a useful variable to understand the phase
of the spreading.
With the previous warnings, in the next sections the
global data about the cumulative number of infected people is discussed, for the different Countries, and compared
with the macroscopic and exponential growth laws.

HOW TO USE THE FITS

To avoid possible misunderstandings, it is useful to
comment on how to use of the previous fits in the future estimate.
With the caveats discussed in the previous section, the
parameters N∞ s give information on the maximum number of infected individuals. For each nation, one has to
follow the day by day data, refitting the parameters until they stabilize. The key point is to check whether the
data are in agreement either with the exponential, GL,
GGL and LL, or else are in between. A typical example is given in table III where is reported for Italy the
predictions obtained by using the available data until a
specific day (March the 8th, for table III). The day after,
one has to repeat the numerical analysis, which implies a
redefinition of the parameters, i.e. of the specific growth
rate, until they stabilize.
This is highly relevant, because the GL, GGL, describing a less effective containment effort, predict a much
larger maximum number of infected. Hence, in this case,
the contrast effort has to be improved and, probably, diversified. On the other hand, one gets a very good signal
that the disease is slowing down to a smaller saturation

CHINA

The available data cover the long period from January
the 22nd to March the 27th and, therefore, the numerical
fit is more reliable. The results are depicted in Fig. 3. In
the final period, when Chinese Government decided a different counting rule, the available data are well fitted by
the logistic curve with αl = 0.278 ± 0.003 (per day) and
l
= 80276 ± 481. Gompertz law predicts a larger satuN∞

ration value N∞
= 83728 ± 721, with αg = 0.115 ± 0.002
(per day). Notice that the error is small due to the large
number of available data. The number of infected Chinese is today about 81897, which means that the effort to
contrast the disease has been successful and almost completed. Previous analysis have been done by considering
the growth of mortality [11].

SINGAPORE

For Singapore, until March the 10th, the number of
infected people is much smaller and the previous considered external limiting factor does not, presumably, apply.
The resulting fit is depicted in Fig. 4 and, as shown by
data, there is a recent strong increase in the growth rate:
a clear signal that there is some new uncontrolled outbreak of the infection with a related exponential trend.

αgg = 0.172±0.005, N∞

The Gl and LL differ in the saturation values, although
they are compatible within the 68% of confidence level
(see the band in Fig. 3). Therefore one has to carefully
follow if the next data are in agreement with the Gompertz evolution or with the logistic one. The exponential
behavior is strongly disfavored by the data.
The mortality growth follows the same trend, as shown
in Fig. 6.

ITALY

The Italian data cover the time range going from
February the 22nd to March the 27th. The results are
depicted in Fig. 7, where the band represent the 68%
of confidence level. Previous analysis has been done in
ref. [16], looking at the mortality table and at the number
of patients in the Italian hospitals. The data in Fig. 7
are well fitted by the GL and the LL is plotted to verify
the signal of a stronger reduction in a possible saturation
phase, as observed in Chinese data.
The initially large specific rate forces the GL to reprogl
duce the data with an artificially large value of N∞
, due
to the logarithmic behavior, but with a large error. The
deviation of GL and LL from the exponential growth is
more readable in Table III and the exponential growth
predicts much larger value of cumulative infected individuals in the next days.
The mortality follows a similar trend until about
March the 22nd, see Fig. 8, with some delay with respect
to the N (t) behavior.
Finally, the values of the fitted parameters are summarized in tables I and II for a comparison between different
nations.

Table III: Number of confirmed sick in Italy predicted by exponential, Gompertz and logistic fits, compared with data
(column N). Fits are made by using the available data until
March the 8th for exponential grow, until March the 25 for
the gompertz and logistic ones.

As for countries with a longer (known) exposure to
COVID-19, our analysis clearly shows that the spreading: a) has reached saturation in China, b) but in Singapore, after a period of important slow down, a new
increase is clearly visible. As for countries with a shorter
(known) exposure, keeping in mind the limitations recalled in Sec. II, our analysis, depicted in Figs. 5 and 7,
shows that South Korea and Italy are in different situations (see also [19, 20]). In Italy, the observed data in
the near future will be crucial to understand if the evolution will either follow an exponential growth, or the
GL, or the GGL or else the LL. This will allow to understand if the saturation will be reached for lower or higher
numbers of infected individuals. The proposed approach
for monitoring the evolution of the epidemic spreading of
COVID-19 has to be consider as a complementary tool
to more fundamental genomics methods [21].

Of course, this analysis needs to be updated on a daily
basis. The daily data must be compared with the fits,
to verify if the spreading is under control or not (out of
control being the exponential growth). This will help to
understand quantitatively the status of the COVID-19
spreading.
