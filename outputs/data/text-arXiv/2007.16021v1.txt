Abstract: The handling processes at the airport will be significantly changed as a consequence of the
corona epidemic. We expect pandemic requirements will be establish as permanent as the inherent
requirements for safety and security in aviation. During the aircraft boarding, passengers are near each
other, which requires both an effective rule to guarantee physical distances and an efficient procedure
to obtain appropriate boarding times. We design an optimal group boarding method using a stochastic
cellular automata model for passenger movements, which is extended by a virus transmission approach.
Furthermore, a new mathematical model is developed to determine an appropriate seat layout for
groups. The proposed seating layout is based on the idea that group members are allowed to have close
contact and that groups should have a distance among each other. The sum of individual transmission
rates is taken as the objective function to derive scenarios with a low level transmission risk. After
the determination of an appropriate seat layout, the cellular automata is used to derive and evaluate a
corresponding boarding sequence aiming at both short boarding times and low risk of virus transmission.
We find that the consideration of groups in a pandemic scenario will significantly contribute to a faster
boarding (reduction of time by about 60%) and less transmission risk (reduced by 85%), which reaches
the level of boarding times in pre-pandemic scenarios.

1. Introduction
Air transportation offers international mobility in a globally well-connected network. In view of the
current pandemic situation caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV2, air transportation is part of the
transmission chains and is sustainably affected [1]. Along the passenger journey, the cabin operations
demand to share a constricted environment with other passengers during boarding, flight, and deboarding.
Thus, these operations hold the potential for virus transmissions between passengers and require an
appropriate seat allocation and strategies to reduce the transmission risk significantly. The constraints
from pandemic situations lead to changes in passenger handling. Currently, airlines aim to protect
passengers and crews from Covid-19 and see face covering as mandatory for passengers onboard. A
physical distance between passengers during aircraft boarding and deboarding is also part of airlines risk
mitigation strategies. With our contribution we provide a customer-oriented solution for both airlines
and passengers, which enables a situative approach to establish appropriate seat layout and aircraft entry
sequences considering minimum interactions between groups of passengers.

1.1. Review of research on virus transmission in aircraft
The SARS outbreak in 2002 emphasizes the important role of air transportation in pandemic situations
[2]. The climate control system of aircraft seems to reduce the spreading of airborne pathogens by
frequently recirculating the cabin air through high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters [3,4]. These
filters are designed to filter at least 99.95% of aerosols and are capable of removing viruses and bacteria
attached to droplets. But the transmission of infectious diseases is likely to be more frequent than reported
for several reasons, such as a much shorter flight times than incubation periods. When considering the
passenger path to and in the aircraft cabin, upstream and downstream processes can also lead to infections
(e.g. baggage handling, security checks). To minimize physical interactions, current handling approaches
aim at a contactless passenger journey through the airport terminal. In a post-pandemic scenario this
contactless journey could include biometric scans or the use of personal mobile devices for services or
inflight entertainment. Studies on reported in-flight transmissions emphasize that proximity to the index
case increases the risk of transmission [2,5]. The simulation of transmissions during flight, based on actual
passenger behaviors in single-aisle aircraft, indicate a low probability of direct transmission to passengers
not seated in close proximity to an infectious passenger [6]. An investigation of a long-haul flight indicates
a low risk of pandemic influenza transmission close to infected passengers with symptoms [7]. The
calculation of the spatial and temporal distributions of droplets in an aircraft cabin showed a reduced
influenza transmission risk, if respirator masks are used by the passengers [8]. The documentation of a
symptomatic SARS-CoV2 index case flying a 15 hour trip in economy class shows that all 25 passengers
being seated within a range of 2 m from the index case were tested negative for SARS-CoV2 [9]. Two
other case studies reports 11 transmissions [10] and one potential infection during a flight [11]. A brief
introduction about the understanding of SARS-CoV2 in the context of passenger boarding is given at [12].
1.2. Review of aircraft boarding approaches
Comprehensive overviews are provided for aircraft ground operations, passenger boarding, and
corresponding economic impact [13–20]. A common goal of simulation-based approaches for passenger
boarding is to minimize boarding time. Thus, the efficiency of different boarding strategies was focus of
the research activities [21–28]. These models are based on cellular automaton or analytical approaches, but
also other models were developed: mixed integer linear programs [29,30], statistical mechanics [31], power
law rule [32,33], cellular discrete-event system specification [34], stochastic approach covering individual
passenger behavior and aircraft/airline operational constraints [15,26].
The quantity and quality of hand luggage determine the duration of boarding significantly. Thus,
research was conducted with a particular focus on the physique of passengers (maximum speed), the
quantity of hand luggage, and individually preferred distance [35], seats assigned to passengers with
regards to hand luggage [28,36–38]. Furthermore, the fact that passengers travel in groups has an impact
on the boarding efficiency [15,39]. Other research aims at the evaluation of pre-boarding areas [40,41],
consideration of passenger expectations [42], use of apron busses [43], and real-time seat allocation [44,45].
The impact of different aircraft cabin layouts on passenger boarding were focused on the following studies:
aircraft interior design (seat pitch and passengers per row) [46], aircraft seating layouts and alternative
designs single and twin-aisle configuration [47,48], impact of aircraft cabin modifications [49], novel aircraft
configurations and seating concepts [50,51], and dynamic change of the cabin infrastructure [52]. Only
few experimental tests have been conducted to provide data for the calibration of input parameters and
validation of simulation results: using a mock Boeing 757 fuselage [53], time to store hand luggage items
in the overhead compartments [54], small-scale laboratory tests [55], evaluation of passenger perceptions
during boarding/deboarding [56], operational data and passenger data from field trial measurements

[57,58], field trials for real-time seat allocation in connected aircraft cabin [44], and using a B737-800
mock-up (1/3 size) to explore the factors effecting the time of luggage storage [59].
There are two new research contributions available, which set a focus on behaviors during pandemic
situations and their impact on the aircraft boarding procedures. The first research addresses the quantity
and quality of passenger interactions [60] and the second research additionally develops and implements
a transmission model to provide a more detailed evaluation [12]. With a focus on airport operations,
the impact of physical distances on the performance of security control lanes was analyzed to provide a
reliable basis for appropriate layout adaptations [61].
1.3. Focus and structure of the document
We provide in this contribution an approach for aircraft boarding considering pandemic scenarios.
These scenarios are mainly driven by the requirement of physical distance between passengers to ensure
a minimal virus transmission risk during the boarding, flight, and deboarding. We consider passenger
groups as an important factor to derive an appropriate seat layout and boarding sequence. The main idea
behind the group approach is that members of one group are allowed to be close to each other, as they are
already in close contact with each other before boarding, while different groups should be separated as far
apart as necessary. Deboarding is not explicitly considered in our contribution. The paper is structured
as follows. After the introduction (Sec. 1), we present a stochastic cellular automata approach, which
is used for modeling the passenger movements in the aircraft cabin (Sec. 2). A transmission model is
implemented to evaluate the virus transmission risk during passenger movements and applied to evaluate
standard boarding procedures. In Sec. 3, we introduce a problem description and optimization strategies
considering passenger groups. The results of the optimization model are presented in Sec. 4, where we use
a genetic algorithm for solving the complex problem. The achieved seat layouts are used as input for the
passenger movement model to derive an appropriate boarding sequence with a minimized transmission
risk during boarding. Finally, our contribution ends with conclusion and outlook (Sec. 5).
2. Passenger boarding model using operational, individual, pandemic constraints
The initial model for movements of pedestrians was developed to provide a stochastic approach
covering short (e.g. avoid collisions, group behavior [62]) and long-range interactions (e.g. tactical
wayfinding) of human beings [63]. This cellular automata model is based on an individual transition
matrix, which contains the transition probabilities to move to adjacent positions around the current
position of the passenger [64].
2.1. Operational constraints and rules of movement
To reflect operational conditions of aircraft and airlines (e.g. seat load factor, conformance to the
boarding procedure) as well as the non-deterministic nature of the underlying passenger processes (e.g.
hand luggage storage) the stochastic model was developed [26,47] and calibrated [57,58]. The model will
be used for the passenger movements during the aircraft boarding. The passenger boarding is modeled
with a cellular automata approach based on a regular grid (Fig. 1). This regular grid consists of equal cells
with a size of 0.4 x 0.4 m, whereas a cell can either be empty or contain exactly one passenger.
The boarding progress consists of a simple set of rules for the passenger movement: a) enter the
aircraft at the assigned door (based on the current boarding scenario), b) move forward from cell to cell
along the aisle until reaching the assigned seat row, and c) store the luggage (aisle is blocked for other
passengers) and take the seat. The storage time for the hand luggage depends on the individual number
of hand luggage items. The seating process depends on the constellation of already used seats in the
corresponding row. A scenario is defined by the seat layout, the number of passengers to board, the arrival

frequency of the passengers at the aircraft, the number of available doors, the boarding strategy and the
conformance of passengers in following the current strategy. Further details regarding the model and the
simulation environment are available at [15].
In the simulation environment, the boarding process is implemented as follows. Depending on the
seat load, a specific number of randomly chosen seats are used for boarding. For each seat, an agent
(passenger) is created. The agent contains individual parameters, such as the number of hand luggage
items, maximum walking speed in the aisle (set for all agents to 0.8 m/s [44,58]), seat location, time to
store the hand luggage and arrival time at the aircraft door (both stochastically distributed). The agents are
sequenced with regard to the active boarding strategy. From this sequence, a given percentage of agents
are taken out of the sequence (non-conformant behavior) and inserted into a position, which contradicts
the current strategy (e.g. inserted into a different boarding block).
A waiting queue at the aircraft door is implemented and each agent enters this queue at the arrival
time. In each simulation step, the first agent of the queue enters the aircraft by moving to the entry cell of
the aisle grid (aircraft door), if this cell is free. Then, all agents located in the aisle move forward to the next
cell, if possible (free cell and not arrived at the seat row), using a shuffled sequential update procedure
(emulate parallel update behavior [63,64]). If the agent arrives at the assigned seat row, the corresponding
cell at the aisle is blocked until the hand luggage is stored. Depending on the seat row condition (e.g.
blocked aisle or middle seat or both), additional time is added to perform the seating process (seat shuffle).
When the seating process is finished the aisle cell is set free. Each boarding scenario is simulated 125,000
times, to achieve statistically relevant results defined by the average boarding time (starts when the first
passenger arrives the aircraft and finished when the last passenger is seated) and the standard deviation of
boarding times.
Boarding strategies are derived from three major approaches: boarding per rows (aggregated to
blocks), boarding per seat (window, middle, aisle), and sequences of specific seats. Fig. 2 (left) depicts how
the boarding strategies and operational constraints are implemented in the boarding model. The seats
are color-coded to emphasize the order of aircraft seats in the boarding sequence. Six different boarding
strategies are generally considered: random, back-to-front (based on 2 blocks), optimized block (based on
6 blocks), outside-in (window seats first, aisle seats last), reverse pyramid (back-to-front plus outside-in
with 6 blocks), and individual seating.
Thus, boarding strategies range from random boarding without a specific order to individual boarding,
which is a specific solution of the optimized block (alternating seats) and the outside-in strategy (each block
contains only one seat). Fig. 2 (right) illustrates how the operational constraints of 1st class seats, passenger
conformance, seat load factor, and the existence of passenger groups are covered by the boarding model.
2.2. Transmission model
The fundamental cellular automata developed for the stochastic passenger movements is extended
by an approach to evaluate the risk of a virus transmission during the boarding process. We are not
considering face masks in our approach. The transmission risk can be defined by two major input factors:
distance to the index case and reduction of contact time. A straight forward approach is to count both the

individual interactions (passengers located in adjacent cells) and the duration of these contacts in aisle and
during the seating process. However, counting the individual contacts will only provide a first indication
about potential ways of infections.
We derived a more comprehensive approach, which is based on the transmission model [65] defining
the spread of SARS-CoV2 as a function of different public distancing measures [66]. The probability of a
person n to become infected in a time step t is described in Equation (1).

The parameters are a (scaling factor), b (slope of leading and falling edge), and c (offset) to determine
the shape of the curve. The parameters have been initially set to a x = 0.6, bx = 2.5, c x = 0.25, ay = 0.65,
by = 2.7, and cy = 0. This generates a slightly smaller footprint in y-direction (lateral to moving direction)
than in x-direction (longitudinal to moving direction). Additionally, the spread in x-direction is higher in
front of the index case than behind it (see Fig. 3). Consequently, the moving direction is changed by 90
degrees with a heading to the aircraft window, when the passenger arrives his seat row.

Finally, the individual probability for virus transmission Pn is corresponds to Θ, the specific intensity
1
(dose) per time step (Eq. 3). We set Θ to 20
, which means a passenger reaches a probability of Pn = 1 after
standing 20 s in closest distance in front of an infected passenger (SRxy = 1). The parameter α ∈ {1, 2} is 1
and changed to 2 when the passenger stores the luggage or enters the seat row. This doubled shedding
rate reflects the higher physical activities within a short distance to surrounding passengers.

2.3. Implementation and Analysis of Standard Boarding Approaches
We introduce a baseline setup to depict the results for the evaluation of transmission risks, considering
a seat load factor of 85%, a conformance rate of 85%, and an inter-arrival time of 3.7 s (exponential
distributed) [15]. Tab. 1 shows the comprehensive evaluation of transmissions around one infected
passenger, which is randomly seated in the aircraft cabin. Two different scenarios are evaluated against
the reference implementation (R) of the boarding strategies: (A) applying a minimum physical distance
between two passengers of 1.6 m, and (B) additionally to the physical distance, the amount of hand
luggage items is reduced by 50%. Furthermore, the use of two aircraft doors in the front and at the rear
is evaluated (A2 and B2) using the transmission risk and boarding time as indicators. In particular, the
back-to-front strategy (2 blocks: front block with rows 1-15 , rear block with rows 16-29) exhibits lower
values for the transmission probability than the optimized block strategy (using 6 blocks of aggregated
seat rows) (see [15]). When passengers board (block-wise) from the back to the front, the chance to pass an
infected person is reduced to a minimum, which is confirmed by the reduced transmission probability
exhibited in Tab. 1. This effect is also a root cause of the low transmission risks of the outside-in, reverse
pyramid, and individual boarding strategy.

The use of two aircraft doors for boarding will provide an appropriate solution for a reduced
transmission risk inside and outside the cabin, if near apron stands could be used and passengers could
walk from the terminal to the aircraft. This kind of walk boarding also prevents passengers from standing in
the badly ventilated jetway during the boarding. Deboarding is difficult to control by specific procedures
given that passengers demonstrated little discipline and high eagerness to leave the aircraft. More attention
should be paid to this process and consideration should also be given to procedural or technical solutions
to provide passengers better guidance and control.
3. Optimized Boarding of Passenger Groups
In contrast to the prior analysed standard boarding procedures, we will provide a new model and
a new optimization strategy which incorporates passenger groups and considers the requirements of
physical distances in the aircraft cabin. In the following, we generally describe the mathematical problem
and formulate the optimization model.
3.1. Problem Description and Formulation
We develop a new mathematical model to determine an optimal strategy for assigning seats in
cabin under the objective to minimize the virus transmission risk. The idea to create an appropriate seat
allocation for a pandemic situation includes three assumptions. The first one is that an airline could
assign just a percentage of the available seats (e.g. 50%) to reduce the virus transmissions in cabin and
this strategy will be the primary solution to face with the pandemic situation. The next assumption is
about minimizing passenger contacts or maximizing the distances between passengers in the cabin and
guaranteeing at the same time that the confined space inside the aircraft is used efficiently.
Looking at Fig. 4, passengers have maximized distances from each other respecting the limitation
that only 50% of the seats can be occupied. Each airline company could determine the seat load factor for
each flight individually also considering risk assessments or economic reasons. Indeed, many airlines are
currently operating the generally accepted strategy of the empty middle seat.
Although complex boarding strategies, such as outside-in, reverse pyramid and individual lead
to better boarding times, there will be an issue. The boarding process is driven by the willingness of
passengers to follow the proposed strategy. We will assume a group of four members (e.g. a family) to be
seated. If one of these boarding strategies are applied, they will have just two options. The first one is
seating near each other, therefore they have to split during the boarding (see Fig. 2). The next option is
remaining as one group in the boarding sequence and as a result they have to seat in different rows. Both

options are inconvenient for group members (families). Here we propose to look at the group members as
a community, since they were already in close contact before boarding. The strategy that is used in Fig. 4
depicts a general solution, but it could be improved considering groups. Without loss of generality, we
could suppose that the transmission rate for the members of each group is zero, which will result in a
better use of space and create a new pattern.
The introduced concept of a shedding rate of infected passengers will be used here as well. If an
infected passenger was assigned to different columns, the several shedding rates must be counted based
on the location of the adjacent locations. Taking Fig. 5 as an example, when a passenger seated in row
i = 21 and column C (aisle), we compute the shedding rate for the passenger from other groups that seat
in the same row (i = 21 at column A (window), B (middle), and D (aisle)) and previous row i − 1 = 20
(column B (middle), C (aisle), and D (aisle)).

The summation of shedding rates of all passengers, as objective function, is minimized in equation (4).
Constraints (5) guarantee that each seat would be assigned to not more than one passenger. The number
of group members are indicated by constraints (6). Constraints (7)-(11) correspond to the shedding rates
of passengers that are seated in the first row (i=1) in cabin. For instance, if a passenger was seated in a
seat in column C (j=3), then the shedding rate for that passenger can be calculated based on the other
passengers of different groups that were seated in columns A (j=1), B (j=2), and D (j=4) on constraints (9).
Also, the shedding rates of passengers that are seated in other rows in cabin are computed by constraints
(12)-(16). Here, we must consider the shedding rates not only for passenger in the same row, but also for
the previous row. For instance, if a seat in the second row which located in column C (j=3), was assigned
to a passenger, then the shedding rates of the other passengers from different groups that were seated in
column A (j=1), B (j=2), and D (j=4) of that row and columns B (j=2), C (j=3), and D (j=4) of the first row are
calculated based on constraints (14) as well. On the left hand side of the constraints (7)-(16), the first term
takes a value of zero if the seat (i, j) is assigned to group k and −6 otherwise. As a result, when there is not
a passenger in a seat (i,j), the shedding rate takes zero. Finally, the requirements for decision variables are
denoted by constraints (17).
4. Application of the Model and Evaluation of the Results
We solved the mathematical model for a small size problem (i, j, k = 6). When we increased the size
of problem to the medium size (e.g. i, j, k = 10), the time run increased significantly and the optimization
software (GAMS with CPLEX solver) could not find an optimal solution in a reasonable time (10 hours).
Therefore, we suggested to design a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for the real sized problem. The problems run
on a computer with the specifications the AMD Ryzen 7, 3700U, 2.30GHz CPU, 16 GB RAM, and Matlab
2013 software is used for running the GA. The developed model is applied to derive an optimal seat
allocation using a genetic algorithm. We choose five use cases for the optimization and implemented the
optimal seat allocation in the passenger boarding simulation to provide an appropriate boarding strategy.
4.1. Solution Procedure and Result
The GA has many applications in the optimization problems. In light of the NP-hard class of the
seat layout and boarding problem, several methods were conducted to present the optimal/near optimal
solutions [24,30]. Therefore, we designed an GA to solve the problem. The proposed chromosome structure
is represented as follows:

xi,j,k = 1, otherwise zero.

if

The value of each array of the matrix such as yi,j is the group’s number of related decision variable
xi,j,k , which is k if the seat (row i, column j) is assigned to a passenger group k, otherwise it takes zero. The
population of chromosomes for the first generation are created based on the structure above. Also, we
evaluate each chromosome with it’s fitness function value which is determined by the value of the original
objective function. After that, we implement several operators as follows to create the next generations
from the current generation: selection, crossover, mutation, migration, and elitism operator.
The selection operator (roulette wheel) ensures that each chromosome with a lower fitness function
value is more likely to be selected. New offsprings are created by a recombination of parental genes.
Therefore, the group’s numbers are divided into two separate sets. The first offspring receives their genes
(the value of arrays in Matrix C) of the first set from the first parent and the second part from the second
parent and vice versa for the second offspring (see Fig. 6 (left)). Here, we explain with colors to clarify the
implication of operation. For example, the first offspring receives their genes which are colored with light
green, light blue, purple, and red from the first parent and receives the genes which are colored with dark
green, navy, pink, orange, and yellow from the second parent. If there is overlap between a gene’s location
of the first and second parent, then we use a random strategy to select another array in matrix and value
it (e.g. for the first offspring, instead of y5,5 = 31, we randomly set y5,3 = 31 because the array (5,5) was
colored with light green before or y5,5 = 6).

Figure 6. Crossover operator (left) and mutation operators (right).

Therefore, we always create feasible solutions. The mutation operator is used to maintain the diversity
of solutions. Therefore, we designed several operators to change a number of genes in a chromosome to
create a new chromosome for the next generation (see Fig. 6 (right)). In the first mutation operator, we
change the seat location of a passenger (y2,3 = 6), as a gene in chromosome, to an unoccupied seat (y1,6 = 0).
In the second operator, we change the locations of two occupied seats (y4,1 = 31 and y3,6 = 24 ). Therefore,
after implementation of the operator, we have: y4,1 = 24 and y3,6 = 31. Finally, the arrays of two random
rows (the third and fourth rows) are changed in the last mutation operator. A low percentage of each

generation is randomly transferred to the next generation (migration operator). The elitism operator selects
the best chromosomes in terms of fitness function value, and transfer them form the current generation to
the next generation. The following parameters were used for executing the code: initial population = 1000,
number of generations = 1000, crossover rate = 0.55, mutation rate = 0.35, elitism = 0.075, and migration
rate = 0.025.
We consider 8 groups with one member (i.e. G1 to G8 which coded with green color), 9 groups of
two members (i.e. G9 to G17 which coded with blue color), 5 groups of three members (i.e. G18 to G22
which coded with purple color), 3 groups of four members (i.e. G23 to G25 which coded with ping color),
3 groups of five members (i.e. G26 to G28 which coded with red color), 2 groups of six members (i.e. G29
to G30 which coded with orange color), and finally a group of seven members (i.e. G31 which coded
with yellow color). Fig. 7 depicts an optimized solution for the seating layout based on the designed GA
generated for the 31 groups (87 passengers).

Figure 8. Progress of GA fitness function.

To understand the impact of our group approach, we introduce five scenarios and their related
solutions based on the assumptions below and compare them by the values of the objective function and
the number of passengers considered.
• Scenario 1: Aircraft seats are assigned randomly to passengers with a maximum distance and a seat
load of 50% (87 passengers).
• Scenario 2: Similar with scenario 1, while the group members are seated close to each other in the
same area.

Preprint - submitted to journal - Michael Schultz and Majid Soolaki

• Scenario 3: Optimized solution from mathematical modelling and GA application (indicated in
Fig. 7).
• Scenario 4: Optimized solution considering increased seat load of 66% (115 passengers).
• Scenario 5: Optimized solution considering for maximum number of passengers (174).
The corresponding solutions for the scenarios are illustrated in Fig. 9. In the scenarios 1 to 3, the
number of passengers is fixed to 87 passengers. The values of the objective function (O.F.) of these three
scenarios exhibit that our approach (scenario 3) for an optimized seat layout results in a significantly
reduction of the transmission risk: a reduction of 94% compared to scenario 1 (seats are assigned randomly
to passengers with a maximum distance), and a reduction of 90% compared to scenario 2 (seats are
assigned randomly, group members in the same zone). In addition, the optimization method uses the
available space in the best way, so airlines could benefit from our approach. For example, although we
were increasing the number of passengers by 33% and created the scenario 4, the objective function of that
scenario is still lower than the second case. Finally, the consideration of a seat load of 100% indicates an
upper boundary (scenario 5) for the objective function.

If the seat load increases over 50% (87 passengers) the values of the objective function (transmission
risk) progressively increases as shown in Fig.10. Assuming an average seat load of 85% (147 passengers)
airlines could significantly reduce the transmission risk by two third by implementing our group approach

4.2. Boarding times and evaluation
The implementation of the mixed-integer linear programming model and the genetic algorithm result
in an optimized layout for the passengers to be seated in the aircraft cabin. This layout will be used
as input for the passenger boarding model, which was extended by a transmission module to evaluate
transmission risk during aircraft boarding, to derive an optimum sequence to board the passengers. In our
contribution, we will not provide an optimization of the deboarding process.
Analyses in the context of appropriate boarding sequence accompanied by the introduction of
infrastructural changes showed that an optimized sequence comprises a mix of boarding per seat (from
window to aisle) and per seat row (from the rear to the front) [52]. First and foremost, per-seat boarding
(window seats first) is the most important rule to ensure seating without additional interaction in the
seat rows. Starting with an outer seat in the last row, the number of group members and the necessary
physical distance between passengers (1.6 m) defines the subsequently following seat row, which could
be used in parallel (e.g. 6 passengers with seat row 29 will block the aisle until seat row 27 (waiting), the
physical distance requires to block row 26 and 25, the next group must have seats in front of row 25). This
process of seat and row selection is repeated until the front of the aircraft is reached and is repeated until
all passengers are seated. We further assume that the passengers in each group will organize themselves
appropriately to minimize local interactions. In Fig. 11, the result of this sequencing algorithm is exemplary
illustrated.

If the sequencing algorithm is applied to the optimized seat layout from scenario 3, the passenger
groups are boarded in five segments. Inside each group, the distance between passengers is not restricted

Preprint - submitted to journal - Michael Schultz and Majid Soolaki

but between groups it is constrained by 1.6 m (last member of the first group and the first member of
the following group). The first segment starts with group no. 31 and the last segment with group no. 14
(see Fig. 12). As an example, the passengers inside group no. 31 (yellow) are organized by the following
sequence of seats, which results in a minimum of individual seat and row interactions: 29A, 29B, 28A, 28B,
27A, 27B, and 27C. Considering distances between groups, the best candidate will be group no. 27 (red)
with the seats 23F, 23E, 22F, 22E, and 22D. This sequence allows both groups to start the seating process in
parallel, without waiting time due to a too small distance between the seat rows.

Figure 12. Optimized individual boarding sequence considering a physical distance of 1.6 m between
passengers (scenario 3).

In the first three scenarios 87 passengers are boarded with different strategies (see Fig. 9): individual
passengers in a regular pattern (scenario 1), groups in a regular pattern (scenario 2), and groups in an
optimized seat layout (scenario 3). Scenario 1 is used as reference case to evaluate the performance
(boarding time) and the transmission risk of Scenario 2 and 3 (Tab. 2a). Therefore, the passenger sequence
is established for both random and individual boarding strategy (optimized, Fig. 11). The boarding time
for the random strategy is set to 100%. As shown in Tab. 2a, the implementation of the individual strategy
will reduce the boarding time to 45.2% at a minimum of transmission risk. The consideration of groups
(scenario 2 and 3) using the random strategy already reduces the boarding time by about a third at a
comparable level of transmission risk. If the optimized seat allocation is used together with the individual
(group) boarding the boarding time could be further reduced to 41.1% at a low transmission risk of 0.09
new infected passengers at average (85% reduction). Tab. 2b emphasizes the portability of the results
achieved by the evaluation of scenarios 4 and 5. A corresponding baseline was calculated for each scenario
(random boarding of individual passengers). The boarding of groups reduces the boarding time and
the transmission risk, and the optimization of the boarding sequence additionally leads to a significant
reduction of the transmission risk of about 65%.

Finally, our results show that optimized group boarding of 174 passenger (scenario 5) possesses a
transmission risk of 0.66, which is close to the random strategy in scenario 1 (0.58). Furthermore, this
particular scenario 5 performs about 20% faster than the random strategy in scenario 1 (87 passengers) and
reaches pre-pandemic boarding times.
5. Discussion and outlook
Along the passenger journey, the processes in the aircraft cabin require sharing a confined environment
with other passengers during boarding and flight. These processes have the risk of virus transmission
between passengers and require appropriate seat configuration and risk mitigation strategies. A physical
distance between passengers during boarding and staggered seat configurations are part of the risk
mitigation strategy. However, the side effect from an operational point of view is a doubled boarding time
compared to the situation before the coronavirus pandemic situation.
In our contribution, we consider passenger groups as an important factor for the operational efficiency.
The main idea behind our approach is that members of one group are allowed to be close to each other, as
they already are before boarding, while different groups should be as far apart as necessary. We provide
a customer-oriented solution for both airlines and passengers, which enables a situative approach to
establish appropriate seat allocation and aircraft entry sequences considering a minimum transmission
risk between groups of passengers. Thus, we developed a new mathematical model, which provides
an optimized seat allocation, while minimizing the sum of shedding rates that an infected passenger
can cause. The developed model was used to evaluate the transmission risk of a seat allocation scheme
and to solve this optimization problem with a genetic algorithm for three different scenarios of grouped
passengers (87, 115, 174). The optimization of a standard scenario with a seat load of 50% (87 passengers)
shows that with the consideration of groups the value for the objective function was reduced from 154 to 9,
which means a significant reduction of the transmission risk induced by the new seat allocation.
Five seat and group configurations were used as input for the boarding simulation (stochastic cellular
automata), which evaluates the transmission risk during the passenger movements in the cabin (walk
the aisle, store luggage, take the seat). Therefore, the sequence of groups were optimized to keep the
boarding time as low as possible. Our simulation results exhibit that the optimized seat allocation for
groups (scenario 3) performs best for the boarding time (41.1% in relation to random boarding with no
groups) at a low level of transmission risk (0.09, while random boarding without groups leads to a risk of
0.58). We could also demonstrate that the effective consideration of passenger groups is a major impact
factor for fast and safe passenger boarding (e.g., board more passengers at the same level of transmission
risk). In the context of aircraft ground operations (turnaround), shorten boarding times could compensate
the extended ground times caused by additional disinfection procedures in the aircraft cabin.
