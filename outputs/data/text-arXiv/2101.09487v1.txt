ABSTRACT
The inferior electrical contact to two-dimensional (2D) materials is a critical challenge for their
application in post-silicon very large-scale integrated circuits. Electrical contacts were generally
related to their resistive effect, quantified as contact resistance. With a systematic investigation,
this work demonstrates a capacitive metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) field-effect at the
electrical contacts to 2D materials: the field-effect depletes or accumulates charge carriers,
redistributes the voltage potential, and give rise to abnormal current saturation and nonlinearity.
On the one hand, the current saturation hinders the devices' driving ability, which can be eliminated
with carefully engineered contact configurations. On the other hand, by introducing the
nonlinearity to monolithic analog artificial neural network circuits, the circuits' perception ability
can be significantly enhanced, as evidenced using a COVID-19 critical illness prediction model.
This work provides a comprehension of the field-effect at the electrical contacts to 2D materials,
which is fundamental to the design, simulation, and fabrication of electronics based on 2D material.

INTRODUCTION
With their abundance and the rich variety of electronic properties, the family of atomically
thin two-dimensional (2D) materials is a promising choice in the next generation very-large-scaleintegration (VLSI) technology.1-7 Electronics devices based on atomically thin 2D materials such
as transition metal sulfides, black phosphorus, graphene, etc., have been intensively studied during
the past decade. 2D material-based electronics show great potential for building both traditional
von Neumann computing architecture and state-of-art non-von Neumann in-memory-computing
architecture.8-17 However, the inferior electrical contacts greatly hinder the performance of 2D
material-based electronic devices.18-22 Multiple elaborate methods have been demonstrated to
improve the electrical contact to 2D materials, such as low work function metallization,23 interface
engineering,24, 25 doping,26-29 phase change transition,30 and the recent van der Waals contacts.31-33
Still, the electrical contact to 2D materials is yet unable to meet the current VLSI technology
standard. 3 Herein continuous improvement of the electrical to 2D materials is required, and full
fundamental comprehension of the electrical contacts to 2D materials is urgently needed.
In previous studies, researchers have generally focused on the resistive effect of electrical
contacts, quantified as the contact resistance.16, 34 In this work, we investigate the electrical contacts
to 2D materials from a different physical perspective and demonstrate that for the atomically thin
2D materials, the electrical contacts contribute not only the resistive effect but also a significant
capacitive metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) field-effect. The capacitive MIS field-effect can
deplete or accumulate the charge carriers, redistribute the voltage potential, and give rise to unusual
current saturation and nonlinearity. Based on a thorough understanding, one can purposively decide
whether to eliminate such field-effect or use it. On the one hand, engineering on the electrical
contact configuration can eliminate the field-effect and significantly improve the driving current
of the 2D material based transistors. On the other hand, the nonlinearity introduced by the electrical
2

contact to 2D materials can efficiently improve the perceptron ability of the non-von Neumann inmemory-computing circuit, as demonstrated by a COVID-19 critical illness prediction model.
I.

Principle of the Capacitive MIS Field-Effect at Electrical Contact
For concision, we first expound on the general principle of the capacitive MIS field-effect.

Fig. 1(a) shows a simplified 2D material channel (monolayer MoS2, for example) with two
contacting metallic electrodes. As shown in the inset, the sidewall of the metallic electrode, the
insulating dielectric (or vacuum), and the semiconducting channel form a fringe metal-insulatorsemiconductor (MIS) structure. At the ends of the channel, the distance between the metallic
sidewall and the channel is small (Ångstroms to nanometers). The capacitive coupling between the
metallic sidewall and the channel can be very effective. Therefore the voltage drop between the
metallic sidewall and the channel (which is VM-S = IDS·RC, IDS is the current, and RC is the contact
resistance) can create a significant MIS field-effect. As shown in Figs. 1(a), we simulated the
simplified device (monolayer MoS2, n-type, donor density 6×1012 cm-2, intrinsic mobility 400
cm2V-1s-1, channel length 500 nm, contact resistance 2RC 1.3kΩ ) with technology computer-aided
design (TCAD). Fig. 1(b) and Figs. 1(b) show the simulated electron density distribution in the
channel. For VDS = 0 V, the electron density is inconsistent with the donor doping density. With
applied VDS = 1 V, carriers deplete/accumulate at the Source/Drain end of the channel. For
increased VDS up to 5 V, the depletion/accumulation is further strengthened. The
depletion/accumulation is due to the field-effect coupled through the MIS structure, where the
voltage drop ±VM-S are applied between the Source/Drain electrode sidewall and the channel,
respectively. The fully depleted region is non-conducting, correspondingly, a considerable part of
voltage potential drops on the depletion region, as shown in Fig. 1(c). Considering this capacitive
MIS field-effect, we plot the equivalent circuit in Fig. 1(d). Besides the Source/ Drain contact
3

resistors (RC) and the channel resistor (RCh), the circuit consists of two extra parasitic MIS fieldeffect transistors. The gates of the transistors correspond to the sidewalls of the electrodes. The IDSVDS curves of the equivalent circuit with various contact/channel resistance (2RC = RCh) are shown
in Fig. 1(e), which are in good accordance with the TCAD simulated IDS-VDS curves of the
constructed device with various doping density, as shown in Fig. 1(f). The current increases linearly
with small VDS and saturates with large VDS. The current saturation results from a negative feedback
mechanism: with increased VDS, the field-effect at the Source end can fully deplete the carriers
through the atomically thin 2D material, dramatically decreases the conductivity, prevents the IDS
from increasing, and in turn causes apparent current saturation.
We further carry comparative simulations by replacing the Source/Drain with the virtual
zero-thickness electrodes, as shown in Figs. 1(c). In this case, the fringe capacitive MIS field-effect
coupling is absent. Consequently, we do not see the carrier depletion/accumulation at the ends of
the channel, as shown in Fig. 1(g) and Figs. 1(d). The voltage drop redistributes equably, and the
I-V curves maintain good linearity, as shown in Fig. 1(h) and 1(i). The comparative simulations
confirm the field-effect originated from the MIS structure. The zero-thickness virtual electrodes
neglect the apparent field-effect at the electrical contact to 2D materials, which should be used with
extra caution in TCAD simulations.
The above analysis has proposed a field-effect at the electrical contacts to 2D materials,
which can significantly deplete/accumulate carriers, change the voltage potential distribution, and
give rise to apparent current saturation. For clarification, the above simulations have used the
simplified device geometry with only one channel and two electrodes. However, the principle is
universal and applies to practical 2D material devices with more complex geometries, as will be
shown below. A similar analysis also applies to Schottky contacts,35 where the field-effect widens
4

the Schottky barrier width at the contact area, blocks field/thermal-field emission current, and
causes a similar current saturation, as we specify detailedly in supplementary material II.
II. Capacitive MIS field-effect at the electrical contacts to monolayer MoS2
So far, we have theoretically proposed the significant capacitive MIS field-effect of the
electrical contacts to ultra-thin 2D material channels. The question is, in practical cases, does this
field-effect have a real impact on 2D material electronic devices? To address this question, we
experimentally fabricated the back gate monolayer MoS2 FETs. Here we use Ti as the contacting
metal. The transfer curves and output I-V curves are shown in Fig. 2(a) and 2(b), respectively. We
note that the I-V curves are linear at small VDS and the current saturates at large VDS, which is in
accordance with the simulation results in Fig. 1(e) and 1(f). Similar current saturation is observed
not only with Ti/MoS2 contacts,19, 36 but also with Ni/MoS2 contacts (see Figs. 3),37 Au/MoS2
contacts,11 Ti/WSe2 contacts,38 Ag/WSe2 contacts,38 van der Waals VSe2/WSe2 contacts,21 etc. In
all the above cases, we find VG-VT>>VDS (VG is the gate voltage and VT is the threshold voltage),
therefore the current saturation should not result from the common pinch-off of the channel.
Previous studies have attributed such abnormal current saturation to several possible mechanisms
such as carrier velocity saturation,37, 39 self-heating effect,36 or Schottky barriers,19 etc., while the
field-effect at the electrical contact has not been recognized.
To address the origin of the abnormal current saturation, we designed and fabricated
asymmetric FETs with an arc channel, as shown in Fig. 2(c). The inner radius r1 and the outer
radius r2 are 0.33 μm and 1.0 μm, respectively. Therefore the contact resistance is asymmetric, with
RC1 prominently larger than RC2 (RC1: RC2 ≈ r2 / r1 = 3, considering the relatively small transfer
length)20. The transfer curve of the device is shown in Fig. 2(d). Two sets of I-V curves were
obtained comparatively: in Fig. 2(e), the outer electrode was used as the Source, the inner electrode
5

as Drain, and the IV curves are linear; while in Fig. 2(f), the inner electrode was used as the Source,
the outer electrode as Drain, the current starts to saturate with VDS ~ 2 V. This is direct evidence
that the current saturation is closely related to the electrical contacts, rather than the channel. When
the inner electrode is the Source, the voltage drop at IDS·RC1 is relatively large, the field-effect
depletes the electrons effectively and causes current saturation. When the outer electrode is the
Source, the voltage drop at IDS·RC2 is relatively small, which is not large enough to fully depletes
the electrons or causes current saturation. Should the current saturation be attributed to the carrier
velocity saturation or self-heating effect, the current saturation behavior in Fig. 2(e) and Fig. 2(f )
would be identical. Should the current saturation be attributed to the switching of the Schottky
barrier,19 the current saturation should happen when the inner/outer electrode is used as the
Drain/Source respectively, which is contrary to the above observations. The mere Schottky barrier
(without considering field-effect) dominated I-V curves should present increased differential
conductance at large VDS, due to the lowered Schottky barrier height and enhanced field/thermalfield emission with increased VDS,40-42 as shown in Figs. 2(a).
Based on the above analysis, it is shown that the capacitive MIS field-effect of the electrical
contacts can dominate the electrical characteristics of practical monolayer MoS2 devices, giving
rise to current saturation at large VDS. Note that the contacting angle between the metal and the
channel might be slanted, as shown in supplementary material IV. The field-effect coupling with
the slanted angle can be more robust and give rise to more apparent carrier depletion/accumulation,
voltage potential redistribution, and current saturation, as shown in supplementary material V. We
also note that the current saturation is closely related to the degeneration of the device, as shown
in supplementary material VI, probably because the surface of Ti is oxidized into TiOx with a high
dielectric constant (~18) and further strengthen the capacitive MIS field-effect.43

III. Capacitive MIS field-effect at the electrical contacts to graphene
The concept of capacitive MIS field-effect for electrical contacts is general and should
apply to a wide range of ultra-thin channel devices. Here we show how the capacitive MIS fieldeffect of the electrical contacts affects the characteristics of graphene FETs. Unlike semiconducting
2D materials with sizeable bandgaps, graphene is semi-metallic with zero bandgap. Considering
the capacitive MIS field-effect, for the n-type graphene channel, electrons deplete at the Source
end and accumulate at the Drain end at a small voltage drop (Fig. 3(a) left). The Source end may
further reverse at a large voltage drop, and holes accumulate due to the bandgap absence (Fig. 3(a)
right). We fabricated the arc channel graphene FETs with r1 of 0.5 μm and r2 of 1.5 μm (Figs. 7(a)),
and the Dirac point extracted from the transfer curve is 8 V (Figs. 7(b). We compared the I-V curves
with the outer/inner electrode as the Source or Drain alternated. The current is larger with the
outer/inner electrode as the Source/Drain electrode (Fig. 3(b), left), and the derived differential
conductance continually increases with VDS (Fig. 3(c), left, VG –VDirac = 52 V, where VDirac is the
Dirac point voltage). In contrast, the current with the inner/outer electrode as the Source/Drain
electrode is smaller (Fig. 3(b), right, compared in Figs. 7(c)), and the derived differential
conductance first decreases and then increases with VDS (Fig. 3(c), right). Furthermore, the
inversion point of VDS is monotonically dependent on the gating, as shown in Figs.7(e) and 7(g).
The above observation is in good agreement with the principle of the capacitive MIS field-effect
for the electrical contacts: the inner electrode with larger contact resistance dominates the outer
electrode, when the inner electrode is used as the Drain, the electrons accumulate and the
conductance continually increases; while when the inner electrode is used as the Source, the
electrons firstly deplete and then the holes accumulate with increased VDS, consequently, the
conductance firstly decreases and then increases. The identical analysis applies to the p-type
7

channel graphene, and similar results are observed, as is shown in Fig. 3(d), (e), (f), and Figs. 7(d),
(f), (h). Therefore, the capacitive MIS field-effect of the electrical contacts applies to a wide range
of 2D materials, including both semiconducting 2D materials and semi-metal 2D materials.
IV. Engineering the Electrical Contact Configuration
The comprehension of field-effect at the electrical contact to 2D materials leads to an
interesting question of whether to eliminate it or use it, depending on different application scenarios.
For 2D material-based transistors, the field-effect at electrical contact saturate the ON current and
hinders the devices' driving ability. The field-effect is critically dependent on the configuration. An
elaborately designed electrical contact configuration should be able to eliminate the capacitive MIS
field-effect effectively. As shown in Fig. 4(a) and Figs. 8, extended electrodes are realized by the
butyl lithium induced 2H/1 T' phase change transition, so that the sidewall of the metallic electrode
is kept far away from the semiconducting channel. Such configuration eliminates the capacitive
MIS field-effect, and subsequently, the current is not saturated, as is shown in Fig. 4(b) and 4(c).
Therefore, the efforts to improve the electrical contact to 2D materials should concentrate on not
only the interface between the metallic electrode and 2D materials (to lower the contact resistance),
but also the contact configuration (to eliminate the field-effect).
Using TCAD simulations, we further studied electrical monolayer MoS 2 short-channel
transistors (10 nm gate length, 20 nm Source/Drain distance) with various contact configurations.
The contact resistance is uniformly set to 800 Ω·μm. Fig. 4(d) shows two comparative transistors,
the first transistor (upper) is with the common contact configuration, the second transistor (lower)
is with the optimized contact configuration, including the extended electrodes and the low dielectric
spacer, to suppress the coupling through the capacitive MIS field-effect. The transfer curves of the
two transistors are compared in Fig. 4(e). The red lines are from the transistor with the common
8

contacts, and the black lines are from that with the extended electrode contacts. Compared to the
common contact configuration, the extended electrode increases the ON current from 96 μA·μm -1
to 271 μA·μm -1, the ON/OFF ratio from 1.8×104 to 5×105, suppresses the subthreshold swing (SS)
from 95 mV/dec to 77 mV/dec, and the drain-induced-barrier-lowering (DIBL) from 89 mV·V-1 to
7 mV·V-1. Therefore, the optimized contact configuration eliminates the capacitive MIS fieldeffect effectively and improves the device performance significantly. We further propose other
engineered contact configurations, such as the contacts with the oblique contacting angle or the
contacts using graphene as the extended electrode,44 as is shown detailedly in Figs. 9. The device
performance with various contact configurations are summarized in Fig. 4(f) and Table 1. All of
the three optimized electrical contact configurations dramatically improved the performance of
monolayer MoS2 short-channel transistors.
V. Enhancing Perception Ability of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Circuits
Artificial neural network (ANN) implanted in in-memory-computing circuits has great
advantages in parallel computing acceleration and energy efficiency.45-48 For ANN, neurons with
nonlinear activation functions are essential. In the mathematical theories of ANN, the universal
approximation theorem has demonstrated that given appreciate squashing activation function (for
example, S-shape functions), a three-layer ANN perceptron consisting of an input layer, one hidden
layer with an arbitrary number of neurons, and an output layer (Fig. 5(a)) can approximate any
Lebesgue integrable function.49-51 The S-shape tanh and sigmoid activation functions, which
feature the saturating nonlinearity, are among the most commonly used activation functions in
ANN. Analog/digital conversions with additional activation processors can achieve such
nonlinearities, but they consume extra chiplet/die area and energy, and increase the complexity of
the design and fabrication process.52, 53
9

In the above discussion, this work had demonstrated that the field-effect of the electrical
contact to 2D materials can introduce saturating nonlinearity in IV curves. One can easily obtain a
tanh-like or sigmoid-like IV curve with the MoS2 or other 2D material based devices, as shown in
Figs. 10. A three-layer in-memory-computing ANN perceptron circuit diagram is shown in Fig.
5(b). Such hybrid circuits can be achieved with the compact 3D integration shown in Figs. 11,
where MoS2 channels are nonlinear neurons, and random access memories are synapses. We
simulated the ANN perceptron to approximate a COVID-19 early-stage prediction dataset model,
as shown in Fig. 5(c). The inputs are ten clinical indexes, and the output is the predicted probability
that the patient develops to critical illness within 5 days. Such prediction is essential for the triage
treatment of COVID-19 patients, as detailedly described in an earlier paper by Zhong et al.54 Here
we use 3000 derivate patients' clinical indexes (input) and Zhong's prediction (output) for the
training of the perception. As is shown in Fig. 5(d), with the nonlinearity introduced, the ANN
reaches a lower loss than the linear regression in 45000 epochs. The regressed critical illness
probability of 100 patients shows significantly improved accuracy than the linear regression model,
with the average error decreased from 4.71 % to 2.87 %, as shown in Fig. 5(e) and 5(f). Therefore,
the electrical contact introduced nonlinearity can significantly improve the accuracy of the inmemory-computing integrated ANN perceptron.
VI. CONCLUSION
This work proposes and demonstrates a field-effect at the electrical contacts to 2D materials,
which has long been neglected in previous studies. The field-effect can deplete and accumulate the
carriers, change the carrier densities and types, and introduce current saturation and nonlinearity.
Based on such comprehension, on the one hand, we call for attention to the optimization of the
electrical contact configuration for 2D material transistors, which increases the current driving
10

ability of devices. On the other hand, we demonstrate that the nonlinearity introduced by the fieldeffect at the electrical contact can enhance the perception ability of the hybrid ANN circuits. This
work provides a full comprehension of the electrical contacts to 2D materials, which is fundamental
to the simulation, design, and fabrication of 2D material-based electronic devices.

METHODS
Simulations: The simulations are performed using the TCAD tool Sentaurus developed by

Synopsys, Mountain View, CA, the US.
Experiments: For the Ti-MoS2 and the Ti-graphene contacted devices, monolayer MoS2
and graphene flakes were exfoliated onto a heavily doped silicon wafer (<0.005 Ω·cm) with 300
nm of thermally grown SiO2. Electrodes were patterned using e-beam lithography, 10 nm Ti/ 50
nm Au was deposited to form the contacts using e-beam evaporation. The contact resistance of the
Ti-MoS2 contacts fabricated in our lab is sample/gate voltage-dependent, ranging from 20 kΩ·μm
to 400 kΩ·μm.22 Butyl lithium was used for the 2H to 1T' phase transition of MoS2. For the NiMoS2 contacted devices, monolayer MoS2 was synthesized using the chemical vapor deposition
and transferred onto a heavily doped silicon wafer with 60 nm of thermally grown SiO2. Electrodes
were patterned using e-beam lithography and 40 nm Ni was deposited using e-beam evaporation.
After lift-off, the devices were immediately transferred into a vacuum probe station with the
Keithley 4200 semiconductor characterization system. The devices were kept in a low vacuum
environment (1×104 Pa) for degeneration study in Figs. 6.

II. Capacitive MIS field-effect to Schottky electrical contacts
The manuscript has dicussed the principle of the capacitive MIS field-effect at Ohmic electrical
contacts. A similar analysis applies to the Schottky contacts, too. In this case, we carry the same
simulation and change the Ohmic contacts to the Schottky contacts with the barrier height of 300
meV. Figs. 2(a) shows the I-V curves without the capacitive MIS field-effect. The I-V curves are
nonlinear with increased differential conductance. This nonlinearity is due to the increased
tunneling current, which includes the direct field emission and the thermal-field emission. The
large VDS decrease the barrier width and increases the tunneling probability significantly. For the
Schottky contacts with the capacitive MIS field-effect, as shown in Figs. 2(b), the I-V curves are
nonlinear with current saturation. The capacitive MIS field-effect at the Source raises the
conduction band energy, increases the barrier width, and therefore reduces the tunneling probability.
The band graphs of the two cases are shown in Figs. 2(c) (without the capacitive MIS field-effect)
and Figs. 2(d) (with the capacitive MIS field-effect), and zoomed in Figs. 2(e). The barrier width
for the direct tunneling increase from 0.2 Å to 2.7 Å due to the capacitive MIS field-effect. The
carrier densities are shown in Figs. 2(f).
