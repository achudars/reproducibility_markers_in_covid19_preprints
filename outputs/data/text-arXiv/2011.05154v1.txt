Abstract—Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoronaVirus
2 (SARS-CoV2) caused the ongoing pandemic. This pandemic
devastated the world by killing more than a million people, as of
October 2020. It is imperative to understand the transmission
dynamics of SARS-CoV2 so that novel and interdisciplinary
prevention, diagnostic, and therapeutic techniques could be
developed. In this work, we model and analyze the transmission
of SARS-CoV2 through the human respiratory tract from a
molecular communication perspective. We consider that virus
diffusion occurs in the mucus layer so that the shape of the
tract does not have a significant effect on the transmission.
Hence, this model reduces the inherent complexity of the human
respiratory system. We further provide the impulse response
of SARS-CoV2-ACE2 receptor binding event to determine the
proportion of the virus population reaching different regions
of the respiratory tract. Our findings confirm the results in
the experimental literature on higher mucus flow rate causing
virus migration to the lower respiratory tract. These results are
especially important to understand the effect of SARS-CoV2
on the different human populations at different ages who have
different mucus flow rates and ACE2 receptor concentrations in
the different regions of the respiratory tract.

significant number of deaths and adversely affected the whole
humankind. Furthermore, an effective vaccine has not yet
been developed. Molecular communication abstraction and
characterization of the propagation of infectious diseases can
provide new insight about these diseases exemplified by the
viral infectious COVID-19 disease.
Recent research focused on the channel characterization of
the virus infection and the transport of virus particles through
aerosol transmission channel [4], [5]. In [4], the authors
model Dengue virus transmission inside the body from its
entrance to the host to the transmission to affected organs.
The channel considered, which is from skin to the receiver
organs, is characterized in terms of noise sources and path
loss. Aerosol transmission, in which droplets carry virus, is
the another means of virus transport mechanism. In [5], the
authors determine the aerosol channel impulse response and
find the response of their system for the sources such as
breathing, coughing and sneezing. On the other hand, a study
considering the SARS-CoV2 transmission process through
the human respiratory tract from molecular communication
perspective is is yet to be studied in the literature.
SARS-CoV2 enters the host human through the nose, mouth
and eyes. We consider the case that droplets carrying viruses
enter the host human from the nose. Viruses travel via mucus
flow in the respiratory tract and reach host cells as illustrated
in Fig. 1. SARS-CoV2 virus binds a special receptor on
the host cell called angiotensin-converting enzyme or ACE2.
Binding is followed by a time delay, τ , which is due to the
mechanisms needed for virus replication. In this study, we
consider this system and accordingly develop a model for
the human respiratory tract by separating the respiratory tract

2

into seven segments. Our aim is to determine the impulse
response of the SARS-CoV2-ACE2 binding process to investigate the probability distribution of binding locations. The
binding location distribution, which depends on several system
parameters including ACE2 density and mucus flow rate offers
vital information on the course of disease.
Our contributions can be summarized as follows:
• Proposing a novel model of human respiratory tract that
reduces complexities of the original system: We model
human respiratory tract by partitioning the tract into seven
segments from nasal cavity to alveoli.
• Determining impulse response of SARS-CoV2 infection
process for the first time in literature
• Calculating ACE2 receptor densities in the different regions of the respiratory tract: Based on the available
data on surface parameters, we calculate ACE2 receptor
density crudely.
• Investigating the effects of mucus layer thickness, mucus
flow rate and ACE2 density on the virus population
reaching the different regions of the respiratory tract: Our
results shows that mucus flow rate and ACE2 densities
affect the respiratory regions where the viruses reach
drastically.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II,
we provide a brief background about SARS-CoV2. In Section
III, the developed system model is outlined. In Section III,
the diffusion model for viruses diffusing through the mucus
layer is derived. Next, in Section V, the impulse response of
the system for different receptor and virus concentration is
determined. In Section VI, Markov Chain model of the events
following the binding process are stated. In Section VII, the
simulation results are presented. Finally, conclusions are stated
in Section VIII.

include fever, dry cough, difficulty of breathing (dyspnea),
fatigue, joint pain (arthralgia), muscle pain (myalgia), and
loss of sense of smell (anosmia) [10]–[12]. The presence of
high variety of pathological events are attributed to different
pathophysiological mechanisms involved in SARS-CoV2 and
proves that it is more than a respiratory syndrome.
B. Transmission Route

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - CoronaVirus 2
(SARS-CoV2), also named novel-coronavirus (2019-n-Cov),
has been identified as the causative infectious agent of coronavirus disease-19 (Covid-19), responsible for the current pandemic. Covid-19 has turned from a local pneumonia outbreak,
which originated in Wuhan, China in December 2019, into a
global pandemic in a matter of months, which has as of now,
October 2020, caused more than a million deaths worldwide
and spread to more than 200 countries [6]. Belonging to the
family of coronaviruses, SARS-CoV2 is the third and the
newest coronavirus in the family to cause an epidemic, just as
SARS-CoV in 2003 and MERS-CoV in 2012, and the only one
to cause a pandemic. SARS-CoV2 is reported to be a zoonotic
viral disease. Bats, snakes, and pangolins have been cited as
potential reservoirs based on genome sequencing studies [7]–
[9].

Current epidemiological data suggests that SARS-CoV2 is
an airborne viral disease, meaning that it is transmitted through
respiratory droplets and droplet nuclei, which are mostly
spread during human-to-human contact [13]–[15]. Respiratory
droplets (> 5−10µm in diameter) and droplet nuclei (aerosols)
(< 5µm in diameter ), are generated and expelled/disseminated
from an infected person during speaking, shouting, coughing,
or sneezing [16]. Indirect surface transmission, i.e., fomite
transmission, and orofecal transmission have also been reported [17]–[19]. Some studies have detected stable SARSCoV2 viral RNA on solid surfaces such as plastic, aluminum,
and stainless steel, yet the significance of fomite transmission
is still debated with contradicting views [17], [18].
The main pathway of SARS-CoV2 inside the human host is
reported to be the respiratory tract. Mucosal openings such as
the nose, eyes, or mouth have been identified as the principal
sites, where the initial viral entry takes place [20]. Although
there are numerous possibilities for viral entry, one pathway
a virus particle could take on the macroscopic level is as
follows. A virus laden particle enters through the nasal cavity,
with the help of the downstream flow of mucosal secretions
and gravity, it travels down through the pharynx, larynx, and
trachea, enters a bronchi, passes down to bronchioles and
finally reaches alveoli. On a microscopic level, once the virus
laden droplets reach mucosal membranes, they diffuse through
the mucosa (consisting of mucus, periciliary layer, and midlayer) and attach to certain membrane receptors on host cell
surfaces, the most prominent one being ACE2, which has been
identified as the primary functional receptor for SARS-CoV2,
just as for SARS-CoV [21]–[24].
The current knowledge on SARS-CoV2 infection indicates
that the elderly are more susceptible and vulnerable to the
infection, while children seem to be the least affected group.
Numerous studies report lower rates of SARS-COV2 infection
with milder symptoms in children compared to adults [25]–
[27]. Some studies attribute these results to their findings that
ACE2 expression in children is lower than that of adults.
[28]–[30]. Other possible reasons held responsible for lower
rates of morbidity and mortality from SARS-COV2 in children
include: the differences in immune responses between children
and adults, differences in ACE2 receptor distribution patterns,
and lower rates of testing in children due to abundance of
asymptomatic cases [31].

belongs to Betacoronavirus genus of the coronavirinae family. SARS-CoV2 viral genome contains four major structural
proteins: the S (spike) protein, the M (membrane) protein,
the N (nucleocapsid) protein, and the E (envelope) protein
[32]. The S protein has a trimeric structure, consisting of
an S1 receptor binding subunit and an S2 fusion subunit.
During viral infection, S1 and S2 subunits are cleaved by a
metalloprotease, TMPRSS-2 (transmembrane protease serine
2), which facilitates viral entry. The S1 subunit functions as
the part, which directly binds to the host cell receptor, i.e.,
ACE2 receptor, creating a Receptor Binding Domain (RBD).
The S2 subunit takes role in membrane fusion [33].
Following viral binding, there are two possible pathways
of viral entry for enveloped viruses into host cells: either
cytoplasmic fusion in which their envelope fuses with plasma
membrane and they release their genome into cytosol, or
endosomal membrane fusion (endocytosis) in which they
are engulfed by an endosome, and their membrane is fused
with the endosomal membrane [34], [35]. There are multiple
mechanisms of endocytic entry suggested by various studies,
involving clathrin dependent, caveolae dependent endocytosis
[36], [37], and clathrin independent, caveolae independent
endocytosis [38], [39].
III. S YSTEM M ODEL
In Section II, we presented physio-morphological structure
and behavior of the virus, regarding its entry mechanisms into
human body and target cells. Here, we will present our system
model.
We assumed that the virus carrying aerosol particles enter
the human host through the nose, and diffuse through the
mucus layer in the nasal cavity, where ACE2 receptors are
found most abundantly [40]. The diffusion of the virus takes
place in the mucus layer, which renders the shape of the
respiratory tract insignificant. Given the fact that the mucus
layer is continuous within the respiratory tract [41], we assume
a cylindrical tube with radius r(y) and length l. The change
in the radius throughout the tract has limited effect, unless it
also modulates the properties of mucus, especially the mucus
thickness.
For a large portion of the respiratory tract, mucus layer
covers the periciliary layer and a thin surfactant layer separates
the two [42]. In our work, we assume that the surfactant
layer reduces the surface tension between these two layers
to a negligible value, and consequently ignored. Furthermore,
we assume that the diffusion coefficient, D, of the virus in
periciliary and mucus layers to be the same. In a healthy
respiratory system, the mucus inflow to the alveoli is countered
by the mucus outflow due to the pericilliary layer. We ignored
the mucus outflow mechanism as it may turn the mucus flow
into a very complex turbulent fluid model. In other words, we
treat it as if it is one single layer.
The existing works studying ACE2 distribution and mucus
flow do not comment on differentiations within a region,
i.e., ACE2 are homogeneously distributed. Hence, our model
assumes cylindrical symmetry.
The virus moves under the influence of the mucus flow
from nasal cavity to the alveoli. We partition the respiratory

system into seven parts, namely Nasal Cavity, Larynx, Pharynx, Trachea, Bronchi, Bronchiole and Alveoli. Our model
is presented in Fig. 2. Due to the complicated structure of
the tracheobronchial tree, we assign transition regions to the
closest region. Furthermore, since after each branching, the
individual branches become narrower but more numerous,
we used the surface area, Si , of each of the seven regions,
i ∈ {1, 2, ..., 7}, to calculate its corresponding radii values, ri

larger than the next region, i.e., bronchiole region. Due to the
cylindrical symmetry assumption, we can make a longitudinal

cut through any point on the model and unwrap the respiratory
tract.
Upon entering the mucus and periciliary layer, viruses use
their viral S-spike proteins to bind to ACE2 receptors on
host cell surfaces [43]. We will use the binding rate, λ, to
describe the binding process. Due to the spherical shape of
the coronavirus, we safely ignore the effect of the orientation
of the virus at the time when it makes contact with the ACE2
receptor.
As viruses bind to ACE2 receptors on the host cell’s membrane surface, ACE2 receptors are downregulated. Therefore,
the number of surface receptors decreases [44], [45], making
it less likely for other viruses to bind.
We consider two scenarios depending on the ACE2 receptor
concentration and the virus population:
•
•

Large virus and large receptor concentration
Only large virus concentration

T RACT
As stated in Section III we assume a constant mucus flow
rate, v from the nasal cavity to pharynx, larynx, trachea,
bronchi, bronchiole and finally to the alveoli. Furthermore,
the viruses also diffuse with a diffusion coefficient, D, in
the mucus layer. The virus concentration is derived using
Brownian Motion with drift. We assign y axis for the distance
from the entrance of nasal cavity, x axis for the distance from
a longitudinal cutting point and z axis as the depth in the
mucus layer. Due to the assumption of cylindrical symmetry,
the reference point for x coordinate is arbitrary. If a droplet
containing N viruses is incident to the mucus level at the
location (x0 , y0 , z0 ), the virus concentration at time t is

The√ standard deviation for Brownian motion is given as

Similarly, for vt  3 2Dt, drift is dwarfed by diffusion
and can be ignored. Fig. 4 shows the dominating trends for
Brownian Motion with drift. For v = 50µms−1 [46] and
D = 1.5 × 10−11 m2 s−1 [47], the diffusion of the virus in
the respiratory tract is shown in Fig. 5. Clearly, the effects of
the diffusion is only visible for large t.

The ACE2-Virus binding can be modelled by obtaining
the virus population distribution over the respiratory tract. To
achieve this, we start with modelling the kinematics of a single
virus incident on the mucus layer. Later, we use our findings
as stepping stones to reach impulse response for different
scenarios as described in Section III.
A. Kinematics of Single Virus Case
We begin our analysis by considering a single virus is
moving under the influence of mucus flow. The mucus layer
has a thickness of h(y) and a velocity of v, while the
respiratory tract radius is r(y), where y lies in the direction of
the respiratory tract from nose to lungs. Then, at any segment

the rate of the viruses that reach the end of the respiratory

forward nor backward, we assume that they will eventually
bind to an ACE2 in alveoli.
B. Modelling of ACE2-Virus Binding
So far, we only assumed the existence of a single virus to
reach (21). As stated in Section III, there are several scenarios
depending on

n(y) = 2πr(y)f (y)dy, total number of ACE2 receptors
in the same strip,
• Eb , the expected number of virus bindings in the same
strip.
Eb is loosely calculated by replacing C1 with C and
carrying out (3) to (15). Hence, (3) becomes

Since A(y) is quite low, i.e., on the order of 10−10 , for
some cases, both of these assumptions hold. Fig. 6 illustrates
under which conditions these assumptions hold.
As Fig. 6 shows, when both N (y) and n(y) are large, the
assumptions may not hold. Since A(y) depends on r(y) and
h(y), the boundaries may change.
Note that changes in n(y) causes a change in the system.
As the system parameters change with the input, the system
is no longer linear time-invariant. As a result, obtaining the
impulse response when (27) does not hold is of no practical
use.
1) Large n(y): For large n(y), the virus–ACE2 bindings do
not change the receptor number in the same segment. Hence,
regardless of how many bindings happen in a given segment,
the binding probability of any virus in the same segment
is constant. As a result, (17), multiplied by N (y) gives the
expected number of binding on the segment. Furthermore, (21)
multiplied by the incident virus count, N0 , gives us the virus
population reaching to any location y of the respiratory tract,
i.e.,


.
We proceed to obtain impulse response, I(y, t), by adding
the unbounded or free virus distribution, V̄ (y). The free virus
population is situated at the location y = vt of the respiratory
tract, due to the fact that virus movement on the respiratory
tract is solely under the influence of mucus flow. The total
number of free viruses is equal to the difference between
the initial number of viruses and the total number of bound
viruses.

(24)
V̄ (y, t) = (N0 − V (vt))δ(y − vt),

(25)

where A(y) does not depend on ACE2–virus bindings.
Since each ACE2–virus binding destroys both a virus and
a receptor, both the virus and the receptor concentrations are
affected. Hence, our model must incorporate variations in the
concentrations. Each binding causes the number of viruses,
N (y) and number of receptorsn(y) to change as
N (y) ←− N (y) − 1

(26)

n(y) ←− n(y) − 1

(27)

Using (25), (26) and (27) we reach two assumptions:
1) Large N (y): If N (y) is large and Eb  N (y), the total
virus concentration remains constant within the same
segment.
2) Large n(y): If n(y) is large and Eb  n(y), the total
ACE2 concentration remains constant within the same
segment.

(30)

where δ(.) is the Dirac Delta function. Thus, the impulse
response becomes
I(y, t) = V (y, t) + V̄ (y, t).

(31)

2) Large N (y) only: In case Eb  N (y), viruses outnumber the ACE2 receptors. This causes all ACE2 receptors
to bind to a virus. Bound virus distribution in the respiratory
tract is the same as the ACE2 receptor concentration. Note
that, since bound ACE2 receptors downregulate, large N (y)
only case cannot be modelled as a linear time invariant system.
n(y) = 2πr(y)f (y)dy,

V (y, t) = n(y) [u(vt − y) − u(y)] ,

binding viruses. Therefore, no assumption can be made for
this case, and neither (31) nor (34) holds. As a result, there is
no closed form expression for this case.

rRE - Exocytosis rate

P (t) = [pB (t), pEN D (t), pC (t), pR (t), pD (t), pEXC (t)]
represents corresponding state occupancy probabilities. The
relation between the states can be expressed as [49]
dP (t)
= P (t)Q,
dt
which has a solution of (38) is in the form of
P (t) = eQt .

VI. E NTRY AND L IFE C YCLE IN THE H OST C ELL
In the host cell, the virus replicate and new virions are
released out of the cell via exocytosis. We can model this
process with a stationary Markov Chain with six states,
namely, binding (B), endocytosis (EN D), release of viral
RNA (C), replication (R), degradation (D), exocytosis (EXC)
as illustrated in Fig. 7. The bound virus, can enter the cell
via endocytosis, which is mediated by ACE2 receptors. In the
state-B, the virus is found bounded to the ACE2 receptor.
COVID-19 is an RNA virus, i.e., virus can replicate in the
cytoplasm. Thus, in the state-C viral RNA is released to the
cytoplasm. In the host cell, the virus can be degraded by
lysosomes [48], which is represented by the state-D.
The transition matrix of the Markov Chain representing the
life cycle of the virus in the host cell, Q, is given by

VII. P ERFORMANCE E VALUATION
A. Physiological Parameters
Morphometric measurements of the respiratory tract such
as length, diameter, surface area, and mucosal thickness
were obtained from estimation studies, journals, databases,
and anatomy literature. Given the non-uniform shape and
the continuously narrowing nature of the respiratory tract,
as in the tracheobronchial tree, we use median values for
branching or narrowing structures. Divided into 23 generations
of dichotomous sections, the tracheobronchial tree designates
a generation for each divided branch starting from trachea,

B. Simulation Results
In this section, we first present the impulse response simulation and then continue with simulating the effect of mucus
flow rate, v, ACE2 receptor density, f (y) and mucus thickness,
h(y), on the virus-ACE2 binding.
1) Impulse Response of Unobstructed Viral Progression:
In Section. V, we find an analytic expression for the impulse
response of unobstructed viral progression through the respiratory tract. Here, we confirm our analytic expression with a
Monte Carlo simulation in Fig. 8.

generation 0, and ending at alveoli, (generation 23). The first
16 generations, from generation 0 to generation 16, are defined
as the conducting zone, i.e., no gas exchange takes place in
this region. From generation 17 to generation 23 is called
the transitional and respiratory zone, where gas is exchanged
within functional units [50]. The generation 0 directly gives
the dimensions for the trachea. Generations 1 to 4 are assumed
to be bronchi, 5 to 16, bronchiole and 17 to 23 alveoli
respectively. For our parameter data, we mainly use Weibel’s
“Dimensions of Human Airway Model A” and Gehr’s “Annexe
A. Anatomy and Morphology of the Respiratory Tract” [51].
Although there are studies investigating ACE2 receptor
gene and protein expressions across different tissues and in
specific cell types using single cell RNA sequencing gene
expression profiling datasets, mass spectrometry and immune
assay techniques, [24], [52]–[54], to the best of our knowledge,
data on the number of ACE2 receptors on different tissues is
not explicitly stated in studies. Most studies provide relative
expressions of the receptor in different tissues, shown as
proportions, percentages, or plots with no numeric values.
Some studies address circulating ACE2 levels, which we
cannot directly utilize as we need tissue-specific values. There
exist some studies which report ACE2 expression data in
animals, which are not compatible with our work either [55].
The primary challenge of this work is to obtain the ACE2
receptor densities in different tissues of respiratory tract. The
lack of studies giving these values is mostly due to the
difficulty of measuring ACE2 receptor concentration in a
diverse population of all ages. To address this challenge, we
exhaustively search among various literature to calculate our
estimated values. The specific works that we use are referenced
in Table III.
Therefore, we first gather data on the percentage of ACE2
expressing cells for the seven region model described in Section III. Then, we search for the total number of cells in each
region. For tissues in which there is no sufficient quantitative
data on the percentage of ACE2 expressing cells, the relative
proportions of ACE2 expressions of two or more tissues, one
of which we have previously calculated are used. Then, we
calculate the number of ACE2 expressing cells in each tissue
accordingly. Note that these preliminary calculations are the
estimates based on the currently available data in the literature.
Due to the lack of data, the effect of age in SARSCoV2 susceptibility cannot be directly analyzed. However, we
investigate the effects of thicker mucus as seen more in elderly
and effects of higher ACE2 concentration in nasal cavity as
observed in smokers.

The physiological parameters that we use in the simulations
are presented in Table III.
For the Monte Carlo simulation, we divide the respiratory
tract to ∆y = 5µm patches. The initial number of viruses are
N0 = 50000. Each virus is independent of each other, i.e., a
new number is generated using the Marsenne Twister for each
virus in each segment. We see that our analytical solution is in
full agreement with the Monte Carlo simulation of the system
for large N0 .
2) Mucus Flow Rate: As it can be seen in Fig. 9, mucus
flow rate has a significant impact on the reach of the virus
population. If the patient suffers from another condition causing nasal drip or any other faster mucus flow, the virus spends
less time in the upper respiratory system. Therefore, ACE2–

rate in the nasal cavity.

virus bindings in the upper respiratory tract is limited, causing
the bulk of the virus population to migrate to the lower parts
of the respiratory tract, especially bronchioles and alveoli. The
virus population in the alveoli is 20-folds more if the mucus
drop rate is v = 100µms−1 compared to v = 25µms−1 . This
causes the virus to take hold in the alveoli before an immune
response can be launched.
3) Nasal ACE2 Receptor Density: Fig. 10 shows us the
impact of the ACE2 receptor concentration in the nasal cavity.
Assuming distribution of the ACE2 receptors in the other
parts of the respiratory tract is the same for different age
groups, the difference in the ACE2 levels in nasal cavity
has a significant effect on the virus population reaching the
lower respiratory tract. The impact of ten-fold increase in

ACE2 receptor concentration is six-fold increase in virus
concentration in the lower respiratory system.
4) Mucus Thickness: Our model suggests an impact of the
mucus thickness. Since we assume that the virus can move
freely in the mucus layer via diffusion, thicker mucus implies
that there is less chance for the ACE2–virus binding. Fig. 11
shows the effect of the mucus thickness. The virus population
in the alveoli is 4.45 times more in the four times thicker
mucus compared to the base mucus level.
VIII. C ONCLUSION
In this study, we analyze SARS-CoV-2-ACE2 receptor
binding event to determine bound virus population at the
different regions of respiratory system. To this end, we develop

10

a molecular communication model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through the human respiratory tract, which reduces the
inherent complexity of the respiratory system. We perform
an analysis of the developed model using mucus flow rate
and ACE2 receptor densities, which are calculated based
on the realistic data of respiratory tract surface parameters.
Based on the analysis, we reach that higher mucus flow
rate results in virus migration to the lower respiratory tract,
which is compatible with the experimental results found in the
literature. Our model will be useful to describe the travel of the
virus through the respiratory tract and to simulate the effect
of interventions (e.g. antivirals) to decrease the viral load.
