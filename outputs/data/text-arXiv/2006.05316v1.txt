Social Media and COVID-19: Can Social Distancing be Quantified without Measuring
Human Movements?
Mackenzie Anderson, Amir Karami, Parisa Bozorgi
Abstract
The COVID-19 outbreak has posed significant threats to international health and the economy. In
the absence of treatment for this virus, public health officials asked the public to practice social
distancing to reduce the number of physical contacts. However, quantifying social distancing is a
challenging task and current methods are based on human movements. We propose a time and
cost-effective approach to measure how people practice social distancing. This study proposes a
new method based on utilizing the frequency of hashtags supporting and encouraging social
distancing for measuring social distancing. We have identified 18 related hashtags and tracked
their trends between Jan and May 2020. Our evaluation results show that there is a strong
correlation (P<0.05) between our findings and the Google social distancing report.
Introduction
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced the outbreak of COVID-19 to be a public
Health Emergency in January 2020 (WHO, n.d.). As of May 30, 2020, the number of positive
cases was more than 6 million globally, with over 369,000 deaths1. The outbreak has posed
significant threats to international health and the economy. In the absence of treatment for this
virus, public health officials asked the public to practice social distancing to reduce the amount of
physical contact. In addition, social distancing helps to flatten the curve of positive COVID-19
cases. However, people have a desire for social interactions (Cohen, 2004).
While all US states instituted social distancing measures, measuring social distancing is a
challenging task. In addition, developing traditional methods (e.g., survey) is costly and timeconsuming. Some companies and institutes such as Google have proposed methods to quantify
social distancing based on measuring distances and movements.
Social media has become a mainstream channel of communication where users share and exchange
information(Sha et al., 2020). In 2019, 72% of U.S. adults use at least one social media site2. In
the last decade, social media platforms have grown in popularity, and now Facebook, Twitter, and
Instagram are readily available on mobile devices, continuously connecting users to a stream of
information. In public health surveillance, social media can provide communication in real time
and at relatively low cost, monitor public response to health issues, track disease outbreak and
infectious disease. Public health experts have investigated social media for different health issues
such as diet, diabetes, and obesity (Karami et al., 2018).
Social distancing was measured by calculating movements shared on social media during the
COVID-19 epidemic (Xu et al., 2020). While the current methods are based on measuring human
movements, this study proposes a new method based on utilizing the frequency of tweets
supporting and encouraging social distancing for measuring social distancing.

Methodology
This research proposed a simple method without measuring human movements. The method is
based on the idea of measuring the frequency of tweets supporting and encouraging social
distancing. The hashtags were identified based on qualitatively searching hashtags in Twitter,
Google, and websites (e.g., https://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/all-the-hashtags-youneed-to-know-about-social-distancing/). We selected the hashtags that had a higher chance to be
supportive and encouraging tweets. This process provided a list of 18 hashtags such as #StayHome
utilized to support or encourage social distancing (Table 1). For example, an American actor,
Morgan Freeman, posted a tweet containing #StayHome. We have collected the frequency of the
hashtags in US from Jan, 2020 to May 26, 2020. We used Brandwatch, a third-party social media
data provider, to obtain the data. The data will be available on the web site of the first author.

Evaluation
To evaluate our method, we utilized a correlation analysis using Pearson method to find the
correlation between our approach and the COVID-19 Community Mobility Report released by
Google. We selected the Google measure because millions of people use Google’s applications
such as Google’s map. The Google Community Mobility Report3 provides insights into what has
changed in response to policies aimed at combating COVID-19. This report shows movement
trends over time by geography, across different categories of places such as retail and recreation,
groceries and pharmacies, parks, transit stations, workplaces, and residential. We used the
correlation function in R to investigate the correlation between the number of hashtags and the
recorded movement by Google in different places.
Results
Our findings show that the number of hashtags had an increasing trend in March and then a
decreasing trend in April and May. Figure 3 shows the total frequency of hashtags with the highest
and lowest frequency for #StayHome and #Quaranthriving, respectively.

Our evaluation analysis shows a meaningful correlation (P <0.05) between the total frequency of
the 18 hashtags and the Google movement trends (Figure 4). This evaluation shows that there is a
positive correlation (R >0) between the frequency of hashtags and residential movements and a
negative correlation (R <0) between the frequency of tweets and non-residential movements. Our
findings show that US people used more supportive and encouraging hashtags for social distancing
when they were at residential places and practiced social distancing and utilized less supportive
and encouraging hashtags for social distancing when they were not at residential places. So, the
frequency of hashtags can be used for quantifying social distancing during the COVID-19
pandemic.

Discussion and Conclusion
This study proposed a cost and time effective approach to measure social distancing during the
COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings show a strong correlation between the frequency of hashtags
supporting and encouraging social distancing and the Google social distancing report. This
research offers a new dimension for social distancing analysis during a pandemic and assessing
social distancing policies.
While this paper provided a new insight on measuring social distancing, it has some limitations.
First, we didn’t collect non-English tweets posted in US. Second, the evaluation process was
limited to a national level analysis. Third, we selected one source for comparison. Future work
could utilize non-English tweets, extend the evaluation process to state and county levels, and use
other social distancing calculations.
