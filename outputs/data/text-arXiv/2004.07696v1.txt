Rapidly evaluating lockdown strategies using
spectral analysis: the cycles behind new daily
COVID-19 cases and what happens after lockdown.

Abstract
Spectral analysis characterises oscillatory time series behaviours such as
cycles, but accurate estimation requires reasonable numbers of observations[1].
Current COVID-19 time series[2] for many countries are short: pre- and
post-lockdown series are shorter still. Accurate estimation of potentially interesting cycles within such series seems beyond reach. We solve the problem of obtaining accurate estimates from short time series by using recent
Bayesian spectral fusion methods.[3] Here we show that transformed new
daily COVID-19 cases for many countries generally contain three cycles operating at wavelengths of around 2.7, 4.1 and 6.7 days (weekly). We show
that the shorter cycles are suppressed after lockdown. The pre- and post
lockdown differences suggest that the weekly effect is at least partly due to
non-epidemic factors, whereas the two shorter cycles seem intrinsic to the
epidemic. Unconstrained, new cases grow exponentially, but the internal
cyclic structure causes periodic falls in cases. This suggests that lockdown
success might only be indicated by four or more daily falls in cases. Spectral
learning for epidemic time series contributes to the understanding of the epidemic process, helping evaluate interventions and assists with forecasting.
Spectral fusion is a general technique that is able to fuse spectra recorded at
different sampling rates, which can be applied to a wide range of time series
from many disciplines.

During the UK Government COVID-19 briefing on 6th April 2020, the UK
Deputy’s Chief Scientific adviser, Professor Angela McLean, said[4] “We need a
good long time series of data on all stages of infection in order to be able to tell

what the impact of measures that came in on March 23 will be”. The measures that
Professor McLean referred to were the widespread UK social distancing and lockdown interventions made in the face of the COVID-19 threat. At the time of writing, few countries have experienced in excess of 70 days of COVID-19 cases and
most only have around 50 days. Professor McLean is correct in that many scientific inferences require longer time series than those currently available. However,
we show that there are considerable and useful similarities in the underlying cyclic
(spectral) behaviours of the numbers of new daily COVID-19 cases for a range of
different countries (see Extended Data figures). We use recent Bayesian spectral
fusion methods[3] (regspec) to pool spectral information across countries, which
provides significantly more accurate estimates of cyclic behaviour than provided
by a typical spectral analysis of a single country alone. The Bayesian principles
underlying our fusion method handle mean that uncertainty is treated coherently,
producing rational uncertainy assessment for our cycle (spectral) estimates. Our
methods produce cycle estimates using the equivalent of over nine hundred daily
observations, compared to the fifty or so that a typical standard spectral analysis might use. Using data[2] from all of the countries we considered, our results
show that transformed new daily COVID-19 cases have three underlying cycles:
one operating at a wavelength of 2.7 days, a second at 4.1 days and a third at 6.7
days, which we take to be a weekly effect. We conducted separate analyses for the
UK and groups of countries with similar spectra and note some variation in those
cycles.
For some purposes it is not reasonable to compare or pool the number of new
daily cases from one country to another[14]. For example, different countries might
use different definitions of the number of daily cases and they record cases through
different national structures and this is even the case for countries with political,
geographical or cultural similarities. However, as long as the method of recording
cases is broadly unchanged over the period in question for a particular country, the
spectral properties across countries are comparable. The transformed cases’ spectrum quantifies the internal oscillatory structure within the series and is largely
unaffected by the overall level of cases, the different start times of epidemics in
different countries (phase) and country-specific internal delays due to reporting
requirements (also phase). In addition, the demonstration of the presence three
consistent cycles across all countries, with some variation, provides supporting evidence for the suitability of the transformed new daily cases as a target of analysis,
and comparisons between and across countries,
Another topic of great current interest is to ascertain whether and how a lockdown will influence the number of new daily COVID-19 cases. We consider
this question for the group consisting of the UK, Italy, France, Germany, Spain,
Switzerland, Belgium and the Netherlands. The number of days (with cases) be2

fore lockdown is, on average, 22 for this group of countries, and, after lockdown,
is 26 (except the UK, which started its lockdown later). The averages just quoted
include allowance for a seven day incubation period. Our analysis compares the
spectral properties before and after lockdown. A spectrum based on about 25 days
worth of data would provide a very poor and highly uncertain estimate. However,
our spectral fusion methods[3] permit effective sample sizes for the group of 192
days worth of data prior to the lockdown, and 196 after, resulting in highly accurate spectral estimates for these periods. We learn that, after lockdown, the weekly
cycle remains strong, but the cycles operating around 2.7 and 4.1 days become
suppressed. This indicates that the weekly cycle is due, at least in part, to administrative recording effects, which are not effected by the lockdown, whereas the 2.7
and 4.1 day cycles might be related to virus dynamics, which is certainly affected
by lockdown.
The discovery of how the high-frequency cycles are disrupted by full lockdown
suggests that they could be monitored during partial lockdowns. For example, if
schools are reopened and the 2.7 and 4.1 day cycles do not reappear, then this might
indicate the effectiveness of that strategy. Given the similarity of the cycles across
countries, this indicates that cases could be monitored and pooled across regions,
over a short number of days to be fused into longer effective samples using the
methods described here.
A more difficult problem is that of forecasting transformed new daily COVID19 cases. Such information would be of great interest, e.g., to those planning
health provision over a short timescale. Knowledge of the three cycles is helpful and we have had moderate success in forecasting daily cases. However, with
individual country series, with smaller number of days, it is unrealistic to expect
too much and, in particular, the transformed cycles experience both a degree of
time-modulation and possible frequency changes. More useful perhaps, are not
daily forecasts, but the knowledge that the number of cases will increase and decrease over a period of three/four days. This means that if one observes a decrease
in the number of daily COVID-19 cases after lockdown, that does not necessarily mean the peak has been reached, but is simply a manifestation of the 3/4 day
cycles. Hence, one might believe a lockdown strategy has been successful after a
sustained decrease of at least four days.
Spectral analysis[1, 5] of epidemics is not new, but most work has been carried out on epidemics observed over long time periods (seasons and years) using
lengthy time series[6, 7, 8]. Recent work[9] on COVID-19 has applied popular
autoregressive integrated moving average process[10, 1]models to a single prevalence time series with a sample size of n = 22. However, conclusions derived from
such analyses on a single series with such small sample sizes[11] are questionable.
For example, an autoregressive process of order one with parameter 0.9, normally
3

considered to be a strong signal, is only distinguishable from white noise[12] approximately 20% of the time with sample size of n = 22; basic simulation studies show the large number of possible different models that can fit such short series apparently well. This indicates that it is virtually impossible to tie down the
correct model with such a small sample size. Phenomenological sub-epidemic
models[13, 14] show much more promise and have been applied with some success to short-term forecasting of COVID-19 cases in Guangdong and Zhejiang,
China. These improve performance by using bootstrap methods on short case time
series, but are still ultimately based on a parametric model of single series. Our
work is very different as it provides exceptionally accurate spectral estimates for a
novel live epidemic that is still in its early days on short series, but reliably so by
using recent Bayesian spectral fusion techniques.[3]. The nonparametric nature of
our analysis also permits us to split case time series at a boundary (e.g. lockdown
or other intervention) and analyse the two halves separately, still with very short
series in each. This is perhaps harder to do with classical parametric models and
to maintain consistency between the two halves. On the other hand, our method
relies on good quality case series from different regions, which is again not always
the case for all epidemics.

Transformed series, the UK spectrum and fusing the world
and Europe
We transformed the number of new daily COVID-19 cases by applying a signed
log transform to the first differences of the new case time series (see Methods).
The transformed number of new daily cases for 16 countries are shown in Figure 1
each showing a distorted noisy, but characteristic sinusoidal trace. The estimated
log-spectrum for the UK transformed new daily cases is shown in Figure 2 and for
all other countries we analysed in the Extended Data figures. Spectral estimates are
commonly displayed on a logarithmic scale[16]. Spectral peaks can be observed at
wavelengths of 6.7, 3.2 and 2.3 days, respectively. Although the peaks are visible,
the credible intervals indicate that there is a fairly large degree of uncertainty, because this time series contains 52 observations. A frequentist analysis, e.g. using
the spectrum function in R[16], produces a similar result, but with even wider
confidence bands. Similar spectral analyses for each country indicate three similar spectral peaks, although not always as well-defined nor in precisely the same
location.
Figure 3 shows an estimate that is the result of coherently fusing spectra from
18 countries, giving an an effective sample size of 916 days. Here, the clear spectral peaks have narrow credible intervals, due to the large effective number of days

afforded by using 18 countries together. The spectral peaks are located at wavelengths of 6.7, 4.1 and 2.7 days. The peak around 6.7 days is observed in the
spectral plots for individual countries and we interpret it to be a weekly effect.
Such a weekly effect could be produced by reporting artefacts (e.g. paperwork
being delayed until Monday, or carried out differently at the weekend) or due to
the behaviour differences of people at weekends. All countries analysed have a
5+2 working week/weekend pattern, although not necessarily the same days of the
week (the actual days for a weekend are a phase effect, which does not effect the
spectrum).

Clustering spectra and groups of countries with similar spectra
We next clustered our 18 countries based on their spectrum, by calculating a dissimilarity between the spectra for each pair of countries, and then performing both
a hierarchical cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling on the dissimilarity
matrix. The scaling solution indicated that only two dimensions were required
to encapsulate 72% of variation in the data. Figure 4 shows the resultant twodimensional solution. Attaching a meaning to the scaling axes in Figure 4 is not
easy. We hypothesise that Axis 1 might indicate how badly a country has been perceived to have been affected by the virus with Australia, New Zealand and Sweden
less so and those on the left of the plot considerably more so. However, Germany
is the obvious anomaly to this interpretation as, currently, it has perhaps been perceived to have handled the crisis well so far.

Spectral changes after lockdown
Many countries experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic have instituted a lockdown
procedure to dramatically reduce virus transmission. At the time of writing, these
countries have observed new daily COVID-19 cases for between 43 and 54 days.
We assume that, on average, it takes about seven days for the virus to incubate,
for a person to seek attention and then be tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2
coronavirus. For each country, the number of days prior to and after the lockdown

(including incubation time) are the UK (38, 14), Italy (26,28), France (23, 26),
Germany (24, 25), Spain (22, 27), Switzerland (22, 25), Belgium (18, 25) and the
Netherlands (19, 26). For some of these countries the lockdown was applied over a
period of two of three days and we took the median of these as the lockdown start
date.
The number of days before and after the lockdown are, in each case, too small
to carry out anything other than the most simplistic time series to maintain statistical reliability. In particular, a spectral estimate in this situation would be subject
to a high degree of uncertainty. However, Figure 6 shows our coherently fused
spectral estimates[3] across these countries before and after the lockdown period,
making use of 192 effective days prior to lockdown and 196 days afterwards. The
weekly peak is clearly visible in both estimates. The second and third peaks (labelled a. and b. in Table 1) are visible pre-lockdown, but have all but disappeared
post-lockdown. The spectrum is flat in the location where peak a. was previously,
and spectral power declines considerably, relatively, where peak b. was located
previously.
10

This result is particularly interesting as it suggests that peaks a. and b. have
been disrupted by the lockdown. The weekly effect seems relatively unchanged
by the lockdown, indicating that perhaps it was strongly driven by non-epidemic
effects, such as recording/paperwork or bureaucracy caused by weekends.
The post-lockdown spectrum is higher overall than the pre-lockdown spectrum,
this is due to the larger variation associated with the larger number of cases identified during the progress of the epidemic. Our transformation suppresses this variation, but does not remove it entirely.

Forecasting daily cases
We have had varied success in forecasting daily cases using a sum of two timemodulated cosine waves model, described in Methods, and more research is required. We used the Nelder-Mead[17] optimisation routine built into R[16], with
starting frequencies of 0.31 and 0.44 taken from our UK spectral estimate plots,
and built the model on the transformed cases up to April 11th. After optimisation,
the fitted model resulted in modified frequencies of ω̂1 = 0.34, ω̂2 = 0.45, close
to the starting frequencies (the other estimated parameters were α̂1 = 1.28, α̂2 =
0.27, φ̂1 = −0.102, φ̂2 = −0.074, µ̂1 = 1.3, µˆ2 = −0.731, p̂1 = 0.21, p̂2 =
0.75). Figure 7 shows transformed new daily UK cases, the model fit and forecasts.
The model fit does not look too bad, many spectral peaks are being identified, but
perhaps the amplitudes of them could be better matched.
The untransformed forecasts for April 12th, 13th, 14th and 15th were 5250,
5200, 6373 and 6164, all with approximate 95% confidence interval of ±150. The
actual number of cases for April 12th turned out to be 5288. In this case, the
forecast was good. However, the two-step ahead forecast of 5200 was wrong —
the true value turned out to be 4342 on April 13th. We also used several stochastic
forecasting methods based on autoregressive integrated moving average modelling
and exponential smoothing, but nothing that we tried was particularly successful.
The series is difficult as its amplitude/variance is not constant and we suspect that
frequencies are changing over time (as, e.g., the lockdown plot Figure 6 indicated).
However, rather than point forecasts, the general sinusoidal nature of the transformed cases suggests a further, perhaps more reasonable strategy. At this stage,
the UK Government and media are looking expectantly at the daily case numbers
to try and detect a sustained downward trend in cases. Excitement has been generated by a drop in cases two days in a row. This happened on April 5th with 5903
cases, followed by a drop to 3802 and then 3634 on April 6th and 7th and then, unfortunately, increasing to 5491 on the 8th. However, the general sinusoidal patten,
with a wavelengths of about 2.7 and four days shows that we should only perhaps

start believing that a downward turn is a downward trend after a sustained decrease
of four days or more. However, caution needs to be applied here as there is no
guarantee that the dynamics will remain unchanged.

Discussion
We analysed numbers of deaths using similar methods described here and found
similar cycles. Although we have not carried out a detailed analysis, if the number
of deaths process can be approximated by a linear system[1, 10] with the numbers
of cases as input, then similar cycles are to be expected.
A time series with a fixed sampling rate and length has a minimum and maximum (Nyquist) frequency that can be observed.[1, 10] Although our spectral fusion
methods[3] provide more accurate estimates of the spectrum in the normal range
(equivalent to having a larger sample size), they can not provide information on
frequencies outside of the normal range. To estimate lower frequencies, we would
need a genuinely longer series and, for higher frequencies, we would require cases
more frequently than once a day, which are arguably not really necessary for any
practical purpose.
Our analyses assume approximate stationarity and linearity for the transformed
series, which is unlikely to be exactly true in practice. For example, in the UK
transformed case series in Figure 7, there are hints of the series oscillation speeding up over the last ten days. Practically speaking, changes in the testing regime,
recording practices, the lockdowns or other interventions will change the dynamics
of either the pandemic itself or recording of it. Ideally, it would be of interest to
use methods for non-stationary time series[18, 19], but the current series available
to us are far too short for such analyses.

Methods
All computations were executed in R[16] and packages that are mentioned specifically below.

COVID-19 New Daily Cases Transformation.
Let Yt , for t = 1, . . . , nc represent the number of new daily cases for nc days for
country c. The spectral dynamics of the number of daily cases for different countries are all countries masked by the well-known and characteristic exponential
increases (and decrease, for those countries that locked down and have now passed
their peak). Hence, we transform our number of daily cases series to reveal the
13

spectral dynamics. After exploration[10] the following transform was used for all
series Lt = sgn(Dt ) log(|Dt |), where the sign function sgn(x) is +1, if x is positive or −1, if x is negative, and Dt = Yt − Yt−1 for t = 2, . . . , nc . The transform
is easily inverted, which is essential for forecasting the number of daily cases.

Bayesian Spectral Estimation and Fusion: Regspec
We use the regspec[3, 20] Bayesian spectral estimation method with a neutral white
noise prior with prior variance of 1 and all default arguments, except for a smoothing parameter of 0.7, although the results are not sensitive to the latter. Regspec
straightforwardly enables the production of spectral estimates using multiple data
sets, with each having different lengths and produces coherent credible intervals to
properly ascertain the uncertainty inherent in the estimation process. Regspec can
also fuse spectra for multiple series recorded at different sampling rates, but we
do not need to use this aspect of its functionality here as all our case time series
are reported daily. However, if a country decided to release case numbers on some
other sampling plan (e.g. every two days, or weekly) then Regspec would be able to
fuse the spectral estimates as described here. Such a feature might be of use when
dealing with reporting structures that are not equipped to provide daily reporting
of cases or where weekly cases are thought to be more accurate. For example,
this might apply to regions with fragile health or reporting systems or populations
that are spread across widely dispersed geographical regions with poor communications.

Clustering of Spectra.
Although the number of cases transformed time series show similar spectral behaviour, it is possible to observe closer similarities within certain subgroups of
countries. We used unsupervised clustering and scaling techniques[21, 22] to depict the relationship between different countries and suggest a clustering for them.
First, for each country we produced a spectral estimate using regspec as mentioned
above, and then formed a dissimilarity for each pair of countries by computing
the Euclidean distance between their spectral values (using the dist function in
R[16]). Classical multidimensional scaling was then used to produce an estimated
configuration using the cmdscale function in R[16]. For clustering we use hierarchical cluster analysis on the dissimilarity matrix we computed. It is well-known
that dendrograms are sensitive to the input dissimilarity matrix, so we used the
clusterwise cluster stability assessment by resampling method to produce a stable
clustering[15].

Forecasting
Given the form of the transformed new daily cases we propose a model, mt , that
(1)
(2)
is the sum of two time-modulated cosine waves, mt = mt + mt , each with
formula
(i)
mt = αi cos {2πωi (t − φi )} tp + µi ,
(1)
where i = 1, 2 indexes the two waves and t = 1, . . . , nc . Initial values for forecast
model fitting we used αi = 0.8, φi = 0, µi = 0.1, pi = 0.5, for i = 1, 2. For
model evaluation we put more weight on getting later observations correct and use
a residual weight vector wt = (t/n)2 where t = 1, . . . , n and n is the number
of cases. For short term forecasting, we fit m(t) to the transformed daily cases
by weighted least-squares using standard R[16] optimisation functions and then
extrapolate m(t), using recent weighted residuals to estimate the forecasting error.
