Abstract—In March 2020, the Austrian government introduced
a widespread lock-down in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Based on subjective impressions and anecdotal evidence, Austrian
public and private life came to a sudden halt. Here we assess the
effect of the lock-down quantitatively for all regions in Austria
and present an analysis of daily changes of human mobility
throughout Austria using near-real-time anonymized mobile
phone data. We describe an efficient data aggregation pipeline
and analyze the mobility by quantifying mobile-phone traffic at
specific point of interests (POIs), analyzing individual trajectories
and investigating the cluster structure of the origin-destination
graph. We found a reduction of commuters at Viennese metro
stations of over 80% and the number of devices with a radius
of gyration of less than 500 m almost doubled. The results
of studying crowd-movement behavior highlight considerable
changes in the structure of mobility networks, revealed by a
higher modularity and an increase from 12 to 20 detected
communities. We demonstrate the relevance of mobility data
for epidemiological studies by showing a significant correlation
of the outflow from the town of Ischgl (an early COVID-19
hotspot) and the reported COVID-19 cases with an 8-day time
lag. This research indicates that mobile phone usage data permits
the moment-by-moment quantification of mobility behavior for a
whole country. We emphasize the need to improve the availability
of such data in anonymized form to empower rapid response to
combat COVID-19 and future pandemics.

I. I NTRODUCTION
It is generally agreed upon that ensuring a minimum spatial
distance between people [1] and limited exchange between
segregated communities [2], [3] are key factors in preventing
the spread of COVID-19. After a surge in COVID-19 infections at the beginning of March 2020, the Austrian government
introduced a widespread lock-down, asking its citizens to
reduce their mobility and social contacts [4]. The call of
the government seemed to be successful based on anecdotal
evidence, such as reports of empty public spaces [5] or low
This work was funded by the Austrian Research Promotion Agency
(FFG) under project 857136, the Austrian Science Fund FWF under project
P29252, the WWTF under project COV 20-017 and COV20-035 and the

traffic levels on highways [6]. However, to estimate the effect
on epidemic spreading and to plan further policy measures, a
countrywide quantification of the effect of the measures was
necessary.
Mobility information obtained from sources such as the
Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) network
can be useful to monitor the reduction in mobility on a large
scale [7]. We applied this proposition to Austria and monitored
daily changes of mobility in near-real-time using anonymized
mobile phone data, compared behavior before, during and after
lock-down measures and published parts of our results online 1
due to the immanent relevance for the public. Here we present
and extend the results and elaborate on the technological
background of our efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The analysis of mobility was performed for multiple spatial
resolutions from points of interest to Austria as a whole,
see Section III-A for details. Statistical measures such as
the amount of travels, geometric measures such as radius of
gyration (ROG) and activity space and graph-based approaches
like local and global clustering coefficients were employed. We
observed a reduction of the usage of public transportation in
the city of Vienna as well as an overall reduction of mobility and notable variation in the human mobility interaction
network across Austria, indicated by the above-mentioned
measures for the whole country. In Section IV-E we show
analysis results connecting the spread of the disease with
travels from the town of Ischgl, an early hot-spot in Austria.
We make the following contributions:
• Design and implementation of an efficient processing
pipeline that prepares mobile phone data on a daily basis
for anonymized and aggregated mobility analyses.
• Demonstration of the influence of the lock-down in
Austria on the values of the following metrics: POI based
counting, ROG, activity-space, graph-based community
analysis. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that
all these metrics are calculated from the same dataset.
• Confirmation of the usefulness of mobile phone data
for modelling disease spread by identifying a significant
1 https://csh.ac.at/covid19

correlation with a time-shift of 8 days for the outflow
of people from the highly infectious quarantined region
Ischgl in Austria to other municipalities.
II. R ELATED STUDIES
Extensive literature using mobility data during the COVID19 pandemic has been published [8]–[18]. International mobility reports of mobile-phone based data are analyzed by the
European commission to report on the effect of the COVID-19
lock-down including the comparison of the effect in different
countries and estimation of cross-border effects [15]–[17].
Furthermore, [18] published analyses of mobility behavior
subsequent to the lock-down using Global Positioning System
(GPS)-data evaluating the spread of the virus from the highly
infectious region in Ischgl to different countries. They used
data from the private company Umlaut, which collected GPS
measurements using tracking toolkits in apps. This data offers
a higher positioning accuracy, however, the number of users
and, hence, the number of data records and the coverage of
the population are limited when compared with GSM-based
data.
Many studies, mostly employing data from China, analyze
mobility with the objective to predict infection numbers. Jia
et al. [9] and Goa et al. [10] predict the number of infections
in China with the outflow of people from Wuhan. Kraemer et
al. [19], Jeffrey et al. [11] and Yabe et al. [12] report that the
correlation between mobility and the infection rates dropped
after implementation of the lock-down measures in China, the
United Kingdom and Japan, respectively.
The two companies behind Android and iOS, Google2 and
Apple3 , both published aggregate mobility reports as well.
These are available for many countries. Vollmer et al. [13] and
Xu et al. [14] use mobility data to calibrate epidemiological
models. We extend the literature by investigating Austrian
mobility behavior and combining a wide variety of measures.
III. M ATERIALS AND METHODS
A. Spatial resolution
The analyses were performed at a multitude of spatial
resolutions, on one hand to match the resolution of complementary data sources and on the other hand to address the
resolution requirements of various research questions. We use
the following levels, which are increasing in the level of detail:
Austria as a whole, federal states, political areas4 , post codes,
municipalities and specific points of interest.
B. Datasets
1) Mobile phone usage data: Anonymized data was provided by a large Austrian internet service provider (ISP). The
information on all exchanges made between a mobile phone
network and its users are recorded as events. Any direct (user
plane) as well as indirect (control plane) interaction with the

3 https://www.apple.com/covid19/mobility
4 https://www.statistik.at/web de/klassifikationen/regionale gliederungen/
politische bezirke/index.html

network continuously generates events in the dataset, which
are aggregated daily. The dataset is based on classical Call
Data Record (CDR) and includes X Data Record (XDR)
of the data domain, thereby providing anonymized metadata
about voice and data usage. The events stem from various
network interfaces covering all most widely used signalling
technologies (2G, 3G, 4G, calls, text messages & Voice over
LTE (VoLTE)).
The dataset contains approximately 1 Billion events from
4.5 Million devices. For 80% of these, the subsequent event is
received in 1.7 minutes, on average 4 minutes. This means
that for some old, i.e. 2G devices, which are only rarely
used, almost no data is transmitted whilst not actively in
operation. Therefore, fewer events are generated and these
devices are thus much harder to analyze when considering
them for mobility use cases. Our analyses are based on filtering
the data of approximately 1.2 Million devices registered with
the partner ISP as mobile handsets excluding sensor devices
from the Internet of Things as well as roamers5 or events
obtained from virtual network operators6 .
The GSM network registers events for each device i with a
very accurate time information and a location with latitude
(ylat ) and longitude (xlong ). As the network continuously
generates events, a near-real-time monitoring of aggregate
population behavior is possible [14]. Our analyses were updated on a daily basis.
Localization: Each cell-id of the network topology is localized with a (xlong , ylat ) tuple. The localization information is
provided by the ISP. The accuracy of cell-id based localization
is by far worse than GPS. However, GSM data is more readily
available and covers larger sample sizes.
Privacy: Obeying data privacy regulations is important
when analyzing mobile phone usage data. We analyze only
k-anonymized aggregated data where tracking of individuals
for extended periods of time is impossible. Due to data
privacy restrictions, any identifiers (primary keys identifying
a subscriber) are anonymized. This is handled by encrypting
them with a rotating key, which is changed every 24 hours by
the ISP. This means that analyzing identifiers over more than
24 hours is impossible. Additionally, we use only cell-id based
localization to enhance the privacy of the subscribers due to
its limited accuracy. Thereby the local regulations have been
met and the recommendations of the GSMA, the alliance of
mobile phone providers [20] have been followed.
2) Infection dataset: On behalf of the Austrian Ministry
of Health, the company Gesundheit sterreich GmbH provides
access to the electronic epidemiological reporting system
(EMS)7 . The data contains cumulative daily COVID-19 infection numbers from March 5th onwards.

C. Scalable data aggregation pipeline
Our data processing pipeline is depicted in Figure 1. Firstly,
to improve the performance of our analyses and to ease
the mental burden for the person conducting the evaluation,
we computed a daily aggregation of the raw data, removing
domain-specific knowledge, prior to beginning the specific
analyses. The GSM network and attached monitoring tools
are a very complex system which requires a lot of business
knowledge (telecommunication specific knowledge required
to process the raw data, such as special types of events or
structures of the topology). We abstracted this knowledge away
and allow for effective and efficient analyses on top of our
aggregations.
For each device, timestamp and cell-id were recorded and
anonymized with a rotating key. Then, we enriched each cellid with its location information which is provided by the
ISP (described in III-B1). As a next step, stays within a
raster cell, which are defined by the regional levels listed in
Section III-A, were detected by spatio-temporal clustering the
signalling events. Thereafter, each stay was enriched with the
daily night location, see Section III-D2 for details. Finally,
the origin destination (OD) matrix was created as described
in Section III-D4. After the daily cleanup, aggregation and
compression, analyses were built on this solid and reusable
foundation.
We needed to process an immense quantity of data as
the raw events amount to more than one billion per day.
Therefore, we rely on a cluster of computers to achieve good
performance. Using Apache Spark [21], a map-reduce style
big-data framework, the burden of a distributed system is eased
for the developers of the analyses as failures of compute nodes
are handled automatically.
As Spark lacks support for geospatial primitives, GeoSpark
was utilized for distributed spatial joins [22]. Additional
geospatial functionality is made available by using GeoMesa
[23], which in its core is based on the java-topology-suite
for providing the geospatial functionality. This is similar to
GeoSpark, but still provides complimentary functionality such
as calculation of spatial distances. For the enrichment of spatial
metadata such as political areas, we utilize a custom broadcast
spatial join [24], which is faster than its distributed equivalent.
Furthermore, columnar file formats with compression and
run-length encoding are utilized, as these allow for significant
compression of the data when sorted by the join keys.
D. Quantification of mobility
We quantify the movement of the population by several
measures ranging from simple counting to estimation of the
mobility via ROG and activity space, to the evaluation of ODflow matrix, which are described in the following subsections.
1) Counting devices: The mobile phone network consists of
multiple topological layers. Some base stations cover a larger
area. Indoor or underground cells as for example found in
metro stations are well suited to monitor the number of daily
commuters due to their small coverage area. For several POI,
i.e. base station in the Viennese underground metro network

or for an airport and region of quarantine (Ischgl) we count
the number of unique subscribers per day.
2) Night location: Based on the proposed algorithm of [25]
we utilize the most used cell towers to derive a home location.
We only use night time activity from 8 pm until 12 pm to
obtain a spatial reference for each device i. The resulting
spatial reference is mapped to a post-code for further analysis.
3) radius of gyration (ROG): The ROG is defined as the
time-weighted root mean square distance between the center
of gravity and each individual localization, see Equation 4.
The center of gravity is calculated as the coordinate-wise
time-weighted average, as defined in Equation 2. We use
the Haversine distance to obtain the distance in Meters, cf.
Equation 3.
4) OD flow matrix construction: The mobility interaction
network can be captured by extracting the origindestination
(OD) matrix, which specifies the amount of travel between
regions throughout the study area. It is calculated for multiple
scales including macroscopic scales, e.g., at the inter-urban
level, or at microscopic scales, e.g., at the intra-urban level.
In recent years, OD matrices have often been constructed from
mobile phone data [26]–[32].
A trajectory can be modeled by sorting the localized events
per user by time. To derive the OD matrix, the continuous
stream of point localizations in the network is first rasterized
to the desired resolution. We are analyzing various resolutions
as defined in Section III-A, e.g. municipalities and post-codes
as well as mathematically well defined grids like Uber’s H3
[33]. For each discrete location l a stay duration is computed,
which is referred to as weight w.
We cluster these discretized point localizations by space and
time in order to compute time-weighted stays for each user
and raster cell. The most important points can be aggregated
as a OD matrix, where most important refers to the points
with a stay duration of at least sk seconds. Each stay has an
associated entry and exit time. We set a threshold of sk = 600
seconds for our analyses. Finally, we aggregate the matrix over
all the devices i daily by counting the subscribers moving from
one grid unit to the other.
5) Activity space: The activity space of a certain discrete
location is the environment or area in which its population
moves. In other words, it indicates the regionalized dispersion of the places that people visit. Among different forms
of activity space representation, here we use the ellipsoidal
representation fitted to all the visited points [34]. Compared
to the ROG (Sec. III-D3), an ellipse provides a more accurate
representation of the locations by computing the major and
minor axes as well as an angle. We use the OD matrix to
compute the following parameters for the activity space ellipse
of each political area [34]:
• Length of major and minor axes
• Area
• Azimuth: The angle between the north direction and the
major axis
• Shape index: An indication of how much the shape of
ellipse is close to a circle (which is 1.00 for a circle)

Moreover, the amount of intra- and inter-region travels as
well as the sum of distance of travels and average distance
of travels can be extracted from the OD matrix. For geometric
investigation of the mobility behavior at the federal state level,
the above parameters were averaged over the political areas of
each state.
6) Graph-based movement analysis: The use of graphbased analyses in crowd-movement studies has been investigated, especially in the use of mobility data extracted from
cellular networks [35]. The OD matrix can be interpreted as
a graph where pairs of nodes m and n represent origins and
destinations which are connected by links with non-negative
weights Am,n if one or more trips are made between the nodes.
By modeling the crowd-movement in the structure of a graph,
it is possible to characterize the architecture and dynamics of
the population mobility and demonstrate relationships between
people and places [36]. In graph theory, the topological criteria
such as centrality, connectedness, path length, diameter, and
degree play a key role in the description of a graph where
links are usually represented as binary states (i.e. adjacency
matrix). For the analysis of mobility, the difference in strength
of the interaction links between pairs of nodes is important.
[37].
We first utilize the Local Clustering Index and Global Clustering Index to more deeply understand the movement-based
interdependencies and interactions between locations and then
perform community detection to compare the structure of the
network during multiple time periods.

Local clustering coefficient: This metric measures the degree to which the nodes in a graph tend to cluster together
and is defined for any node m as the fraction of total
relative weight of connected neighbors of that node over the
total mobility strength of possible links between the node’s
neighbors. This measure is calculated by [38]:
X Am,n + Am,h
1
LCm =
am,n am,h an,h (5)
sm (km − 1)
2
n,h

where A represents the weight of each edge between a pair of
nodes, sm is sum of weights of edges connected to node m, km
is the degree of node m and a is the binary state of presence
of a link (0 is assigned for each OD pair that does not have
an observed flow and 1 is assigned otherwise). Generally, well
interconnected nodes show a high local clustering coefficient
while the nodes with neighboring vertices that are not directly
connected present a small clustering coefficient.
Global clustering coefficient: This metric is based on transitivity, which is calculated based on the weighted density
of triplets of nodes in a graph. A triplet can be defined as
three nodes that are connected by either two (open triplet) or
three (closed triplet) links. The global clustering coefficient is
defined as the number of closed triplets over the total number
of triplets [39]:
P
w
(6)
GC = Pτ ∆

τ
where
w is defined as the arithmetic P
mean of the weights,
P
τ w is the total weight of triplets and
τ ∆ w is total weight

In our analyses we consider multiple phases indicated
by Roman numerals, based on the dataset of non-medical
interventions published by Desvars et. al. [4]:
I. pre-lock-down – before 11th of March
II. transitioning – 12th until 14th of March
III. lock-down – 15th of March until 1st of May
IV. easing – 2nd of May onwards
A. Counting-based evaluation
1) Public transport usage: Figure 2 shows the reduction of
passengers on the Viennese metro, which translates into the
effectiveness of the far-reaching restrictions undertaken by the
government of Austria. After a first press conference on the
10th of March (first black line), the measures were announced
and activity was reduced until full implementation of the
lock-down measures on the 15th of March. The frequency of
metro usage was about 1/5 of a regular Monday in this state
induced by full implementation of the lock-down measures.
We still can observe the weekly trend that there is less usage of

where M defines the total number of edges, Am,n represents
the edge weight between nodes m and n, km and kn indicate
the degree of the vertices, cm and cn are the communities
of m and n, and φ(cm , cn ) equals 1 when m = n and
0 otherwise. If a particular division gives no more withincommunity edges than a randomly divided network we will
get Q = 0. Values other than 0 indicate deviations from
randomness, and in practice values greater than about 0.3
appear to indicate significant community structure. Given that
high values of modularity represent good partitions, the best
partitioning or at least a very good partitioning of a graph
could be attained through optimization methods. Newman [41]
introduces a well-known community detection algorithm. In
this algorithm, starting with a state in which each node is the
sole member of one individual community, a greedy algorithm
is employed for repeatedly joining communities together in
pairs and choosing, at each step, the join that results in
the greatest increase in Q. This process continues until the
corresponding maximal modularity is achieved.

Community detection: The mobility interaction network
described above is neither regular like lattices nor irregular
like a random graph with fairly homogeneous distribution
of edges among the nodes. The movement network consists
of a heterogeneous distribution of edges both globally and
locally. A community in such a network might refer to a
group of nodes presenting a large number of internal links as
well as a small number of links toward the nodes pertaining
to other communities. The notion of modularity is the most
broadly used measurement of the quality of a network division
into communities. For a weighted graph, the modularity is

the metro during weekends. From Easter onwardsmetro usage
starts to recover almost to previous levels.With the official
end of the lock-down, mobility has recovered to 52.5% when
comparing calendar week 22 with week 10 – i.e. with the
levels of before the crisis. Even later until August a full
recovery to previous levels is not reached.
2) POI analyses: For two selected locations (airport, quarantined region), see Figure 3, the dramatic reduction in devices
present is depicted. Both can be seen as a proxy for long
distance/international travel activities8 . This also justifies that
both locations have not recovered until the end of the analysis
period.

B. ROG
Before the crisis, the median ROG for the whole population
was 2 kilometers per day. After the announcement of the
restrictions on the 15th of March, it reduced to 800 meters.
The distribution of the ROG is heavily skewed. When creating
discrete bins of the ROG the effect of very large ROG can be
mitigated. We create three bins, [0, 500m[ for devices moving
little to no movement, [500, 5000m[ for intermediate and
[5000m, max.] for large movements. Bin sizes were chosen
based on qualitative experience with test devices. Figure 4A
depicts how the lock-down measures increased the number
of devices moving very little. Even after the official easing
of the measures the population has not yet recovered to
previous levels of movement until the end of our study period.
Conversely, for medium distance movements in the range of
500–5000 m and large radii above 5000 m, Figures 4BC show
the effect of the lock-down measures by depicting a dramatic
reduction of movement.
We additionally computed a daily night location as defined
in Section III-D2 for each user. This location was assigned
the matching post code allowing to produce a map of Austria,
Figure 5, visualizing the spatial differences in the relative

reduction of mobility, as measured by the ROG. The reduction
is consistent throughout Austria, except for some small towns
where the number of observations might be too small. Moreover, we have broken down the analysis into hourly groups
(Figure 6). Each line represents an hour. Before the lock-down,
we observe a fairly consistent weekly trend. During the week
there is a large spread between daily and nightly mobility,
whereas on weekends this gap is reduced strongly due to
less movement during the daytime and an increase in ROG at
night. With the introduction of the lock-down measures ROG
decreases for all times, but retains its weekly pattern, except
for the characteristic nightly increase of activity on weekends,
which is not recovering, even after reduction of the lock-down
restrictions. Apart from weekend nights mobility at all times
of day is slowly increasing towards pre-lock-down level.
C. Activity space
The result of activity space analysis supports the above
findings. Figure 7 illustrates a reduction in the statistical and
geometrical parameters for an example political area from
1st of March and especially the announcement of restrictions
(on 15th of March) until Easter (12th of April). However,
after Easter and especially after easing the restrictions (on
2nd of May), the parameters are getting close to their normal
values. Specifically, as seen in Figure 7, the length of the
major axis severely reduces during the restriction time, while
the minor axis is unchanged (this is illustrated in the graph
of the shape index, too). Moreover, as the graph of angle

Fig. 7: Absolute values of the activity space parameters for a sample political area. The results indicate a drastic reduction in
mobility.

shows, the direction of the ellipse follows a periodic pattern
during the restricted mobility time. It means that destination
points have become more specific, compared to randomly
distributed destinations, which results in random values of
angle before the restriction (note that when destination points
are randomly distributed, the angle parameter varies from day
to day, however, if the same destinations are visited every day,
this parameter is almost similar for different days). This pattern
has been followed by almost all political areas. Figure 8 (upper
panels) plot both the relative change in the sum of intra- and
inter-region travel as well as area of the activity space for
federal states. The corresponding parameters are shown on
the maps in Figure 8 (lower panels). These figures illustrate
a reduction in the relative change in the parameters for all
states. On the other hand, these figures show that the western
states (i.e. Tyrol, Vorarlberg, and Salzburg), where the first
positive COVID-19 cases were reported, started the reductions
earlier than other states, even before official announcement of
the restrictions, and have the highest reduction rates during
the restriction periods. Moreover, they are still showing some
levels of reduction although the restrictions have been eased
on the 2nd of May.
D. Graph-based analysis of movement
At first, the global clustering coefficient was calculated for
each daily constructed movement graph. On the 15th of March
(announcement of restrictions) a sharp decrease of this index
can be observed in Figure 9. The increase of this metric with
a gentle slope after Easter (on 12th of April) is visible in this
figure. This evidence suggests a lower connectivity between
the nodes caused by the announcement of restrictions.

The daily local clustering index was calculated for each
political area and then averaged over each federal state. As
is shown in Figure 10, each of the states shows a distinctive
pattern. For example, the state of Vienna seems to have a
steady trend over the all time slots. On the contrary, states
such as Tyrol and Salzburg, where the first positive COVID19 cases were reported, have the highest reduction rates
of local clustering index during the lock-down period. The
reduction of this metric means the interconnection of nodes
with neighboring ones are cut down.
At the next step, in order to analyze the structure of
crowd movement network at the level of federal states, the
aforementioned Newman community detection algorithm [41]
was utilized. Figure 11 plots the change of daily modularity
value in different time periods. The modularity value began to
increase from announcement of restrictions (on 15th of March)
and just after Easter and especially after easing the main
restrictions (on 2nd of May) the trend changed (the positive
slope has changed to negative). The higher value of modularity
in the lock-down period indicates the high concentration of
edges in specific groups of nodes and low interaction among
these groups because of the implementation of restrictions.
The weighted undirected mobility interaction graphs which
were constructed based on the overall OD matrix in each of
defined time periods functioned as an input to the community
detection algorithm to yield the best obtained structure of
communities in each time slot. The results show the community structure of the mobility interaction network in the
form of coherent geographical regions. Figure 12 compares
the community structure of Austria in two time slots: before
initial measures (pre-measures) and after announcement of

restrictions. The count of communities before the lock-down
is 13 communities, which increases during the period of
restrictions to 20 communities. As shown in Figure 12, the
subdivision of communities into smaller ones has generally
occurred in the western political area of Austria, where the
first positive COVID-19 cases were reported and had the most
movement reduction rates during the periods of lock-down. A
shrinking size of communities indicates that local interactions

The first large cluster of infections in Austria originated
in Ischgl, a skiing and party area in the Tyrolean alps. In
fact, a large share of the infections in Austria, especially at
the beginning of the pandemic, could be traced back to this
super-spreading event at the beginning of March [42]. We can
confirm this result by analyzing the OD matrix constructed in
Section III-D4.
We found that mobile phones leaving the infectious area
of Ischgl are spread all over Austria. As a next step we

By comparing the medians of cumulative infection rates of
COVID-19 reported by the government (Figure 13A) we reveal
that for towns in the treatment group there is an earlier and
stronger onset in COVID-19 infections.
For both groups we compared the relative number of new
infections on a municipality level and perform a MannWhitney-U significance test. Figure 13B shows the resulting
p-values starting from March 1st . We found a significant effect
(p < 0.01) from March 14th onwards, 8 days after the first
reported cases in Ischgl (March 6th ).

V. C ONCLUSION
In this paper, we described the changes in human mobility
in Austria during the lock-down with regards to the SARSCoV-2 pandemic using near-real-time, anonymized mobile
phone data. We discussed mobility changes for very confined
regions such as metro stations, airports or single villages,
as well as regional and national changes. The results of
statistical, geometric and graph-based methods showed that
the announcement of restrictions led to a dramatic reduction
in human mobility in the whole country.
For all the movement metrics we consistently observed
a reduction. This reduction is followed by an increase in
modularity, as communities decompose into clusters. A similar
observation can be made in the other direction as the mobility
subsequently recovers. However, for the POI based indicators
we cannot observe such a recovery.
Our analyses could be improved if data with a better
accuracy were available, such as based on triangulation. Other
limitations apply as well: we only analyze data from a single
big ISP, its regional market share might vary. Furthermore,
we localize the data only with the coarse cell-id. As a result,
in rural areas the accuracy is in the range of a couple of
kilometers, whereas for a city usually approximately 500 m.
In certain rural areas there might be no cell tower coverage
at all. Moreover, people from time to time leave their phone
at home, which would not generate movement in our dataset
even though people are moving.
The time lagged correlation of arrivals from Ischgl with
infection rates adds to the evidence that origin-destination
matrices are of great value for epidemiological forecasting

[43]. Due to the correlation we found, we can conclude that
between an infection in Ischgl and the detection of the disease
in a new area, a duration of maximum 8 days passes.
We have presented a broad range of measures, some for
specific points, others suitable for larger regions. In total, these
offer a global picture of a society with regards to mobility
and how the measures have been followed, and can help
decision makers by providing input for required simulations
and epidemiological models.
A potential future study could analyze co-movement patterns, identify human contacts and subsequently, determine the
effect of (non) social distancing [44] or evaluate the effect of
parametrizing the contact behavior from OD matrices in agent
based simulations as employed in e.g. Austria [45] to predict
COVID-cases. Furthermore, standardizing on a (sub-)set of the
presented measures would allow comparison between network
providers in the same country or between multiple countries. This would improve over the analyses of the European
commission [15]–[17] where inconsistencies between different
countries are mentioned. Additionally, limitations of this study
such as the daily re-anonymization of the data could be lifted
to perform long-term evaluation of the impact of a pandemic
on mobility.
