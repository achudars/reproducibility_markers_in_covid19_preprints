The investigation focuses on an on-off protocol for controlling the COVID-19 widespread. The
protocol establishes a working period of 4 days for all the citizens, followed by 8 days of lock-down.
We further propose splitting people into smaller groups that undergo the on-off protocol, but shifted
in time. This procedure is expected to regularize the overall economic activity. Our results show
that either the on-of protocol and the splitting into groups reduces the amount of infected people.
However, the latter seems to be better for economic reasons. Our simulations further show that the
start-up time is a key issue for the success of the implementation.

INTRODUCTION
A.

In this investigation we explore a cyclic scheme of
isolation (quarantine) and economic activity in order to
cope with a pandemic like the Covid-19 one. The proposed scheme consists in a sequence of isolation-activity
cycles in which a portion of the population (one third)
is fully free to join its usual activities while the other
two thirds are subject of the isolation. After four days
the third that has been working goes into quarantine
(8 days isolation), one of the remaining thirds remains
in quarantine and the third one change to a state of
full activity. As will be shown this scheme (inspired
in Ref. [1]) allows to properly control the pandemic
evolution while keeping the economic cycle active.
The evolution of the disease is performed using a SEIR
(Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered) compartmental model .
In Section II A we briefly describe the SEIR model.
In Section II B we show the way in which the above
metioned cyclic alternate scheme is implemented in the
4-8 case.

THE MODEL

The SEIR model of a single group

In order to describe the time evolution of a given population when a (small) fraction of it is infected, we resort
to the SEIR compartmental model. These kind of models
consider that the individuals among the the population
can be in one of the following possible states:
S: Susceptible individuals, which are not immune to
the considered infection, and consequently, can get
infected by contact with an infected individual.
E: Exposed, is an individual who having been in contact with I, is already a patient but is unable to
infect other Susceptible individuals.
I: Is the infected state, the individual is able to infect
other susceptible individuals.
R: Removed state, the individuals in this state do not
participate in the process of epidemic evolution any
more. It both comprises the individuals who became immune to the illness but also those who die.
In this way this quantities satisfy the following relation
S(t) + E(t) + I(t) + R(t) = N

The SEIR model appears as a more accurate model
for the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic with respect to
the SIS, SIR, etc.. This is because those individuals who
catched the infection undergo an “incubation” period,

2
through which they are not able to infect others.
The equations that describe the evolution of the infection read as follows.

(2)

with s(t) = S(t)/N , e(t) = E(t)/N , etc. These are the
magnitudes per unit individual. For the purpose of simplicity, we will consider β, σ y γ as fixed parameters.
The parameter β (infection rate) represents the effective
mean field rate of infection, actuating on the product of
the relative susceptible population and the relative infected population. It depends on intrinsic ingredients
like the infectivity of the virus under consideration and
extrinsic ones like the contact frequency. Besides, the parameters σ and γ depend exclusively on the illness under
consideration.
One of the relevant magnitudes is the so called basic
reproduction number R0 [4]

R0 =

β
γ

(3)

This quantity represents the number of individuals
that are infected by a single individual in state I, when
interacting with a totally Susceptible population. It is
immediate to see that if R0 is larger than 1 the infection
will blossom. On the contrary, if this quantity is smaller
than 1 the infection dies out.
It should be kept in mind that once the process starts
developing the R0 should be replaced by the Re (i.e.
effective reproduction number).

B.

The SEIR model for three groups and cyclical
lock-down

The SEIR model detailed in Section II A assumes that
the disease spreads over an homogeneous population.
However, this may not be the case if some kind of
grouping tendency exists among the individuals. The
reproduction number may be different within the group,
or, between groups. The latter will depend on the
isolation degree among the groups. Two completely
isolated groups attain independent evolutions. But a
small infection leakage povides the mean for the disease
propagation from group to group. Fig. 1 represents
qualitatively this situation.
A multi-group SEIR model can mathematically represented as follows. Each group is labeled through indexes

FIG. 1. Connectivity scheme for many groups. The disease
spreading model corresponds to the SEIR one.

i = 1...N . The former (scalar) states S,E,I,R become
(column) arrays of states
(s1 , ..., sN ) , (e1 , ..., eN ) , (i1 , ..., iN ) , (r1 , ..., rN )

(4)

respectively. Notice that the total amount of individuals
in each state corresponds to the sum of the elements of
each array.
Since the propagation can actually occur within each
group, or, among them, we define two sets of reproduction numbers. The first set corresponds to the reproduction number within group Rii = βii /γi . The second set
corresponds to the reproduction number between any two
groups Rij = βij /γi . The mixing among groups occurs
as follows

SIMULATIONS

We implemented the Runge Kutta 4th-order method
in order to integrate the differential equations. The

3
chosen time step was 0.1 (days).

1.0

As mentioned in Section II, the parameters σ and γ
represent the incubation rate and the recuperation rate,
respectively. Therefore, σ −1 and γ −1 correspond to the
mean incubation time and the mean recovering time,
respectively. According to preliminary estimations for
COVID-19, we consider the following parameter values
for the SEIR model: σ −1 = 3 days and γ −1 = 4 days
[2, 3, 5, 6].

The cyclical work-lockdown strategy corresponds to
W -days of work and L-days of lock-down (W, L). Two
transmission parameters (β) may be accomplished on
each period, due to the different number of contacts.
These are βW for the working days and βL for the
lock-down days, with the associated reproduction numbers RW and RL , respectively (see Eq. 3). We assume
RL = 0.6 and RW = 1.5 (or greater) as in Ref. [1].

IV.

RESULTS

In this section we discuss the results obtained. We
divided our investigation into two different scenarios.
We first examined the case in which there is no intervention during the pandemic (Section IV A), while the
intervention case is left to Section IV B.

A.

The uncontrolled pandemic spreading

As a first step we examined how the pandemic
spreads without any kind of intervention. In other
words, withouth any cyclical strategy. According to
Ref. [2], we assumed that the reproduction number is 3.
Fig. 2 shows the evolution of the susceptible, exposed,
infected and recovered individual along time. As can
be seen, the number of susceptible individuals decreases
monotonically during time. On the contrary, an opposite
behavior can be observed for the recovered individuals.

The cyclical work-lockdown implementation

We first implemented a cyclic work-lockdown strategy
in the same way as in Ref. [1]. This one corresponds to a
cyclical schedule of lock-down and work days. As already
mentioned in Section II, the transmission parameter β
is the only parameter to be modified through lockdown
policies. Recall that this parameter depends on the
number of individual contacts. Therefore, policies like
lock-down can reduce its value, and thus, the value of
R0 (see Eq. 3).

FIG. 2. Pandemic evolution. We used σ −1 = 3 days, γ −1 =
4 days and β =0.75 (R0 =3) [2]. The initial condition was
s(0) = 1, s(0) = 0, i(0) = 1 × 10−3 y r(0) = 0.

In this case, they increase monotonically along time.
Besides, Fig. 2 shows that the exposed and infected
individuals adopt a similar profile. As can be seen, the
peak of infected individuals is reached at the fifth week.
The height and width of the infected peak depends on
the value of R0 . Thus, the greater the value of R0 , the
higher the peak. And, in turn, narrower.

B.

Evolution of the pandemic with cyclical strategy

We now discussed the effects of applying the lockdownwork cycle during the pandemic. We will use the term
homogeneous group to define a set of individuals that is
in a single state. That is, a homogeneous group is one
that is in a state of “lockdown” or “work”, but not both.
Two possible scenarios will be analyzed below:
• An unique homogeneous group: there is only one
homogeneous group.
• Three homogeneous groups (multi-group): the
crowd is divided into three groups of individuals
of the same size. People in each group interact
with those in the same group (Rii ). Also, people
from one group can interact with people from another group (Rij ). It should be noted that, in this
case, one group may be in a state of “lockdown”,
while the other two groups in a state of “work” or
“normal activity”.

Fig. 3 shows the number of infected individuals when
we apply the lockdown-activity strategy for two different

schedules (4-8 days and 4-10 days). Notice that this
is applied after the number of infected surpasses 10%
of the total population. We compare this evolution
with respect the case in which a permanent lockdown is
applied (see Fig. 3). As can be seen, in both cases, the
best strategy in terms of the number of infected people,
is a continuous (or strict) lock-down. In this case there
is a monotonically decrease in the number of infected
over time.

In the next section we will focus on the study of the
cycle (4-8).

of infected. It should be noted that similar results are
obtained in the case of the susceptible, exposed and
recovered (not shown). Thus, we conclude that applying
a cycle (4-8) is similar to the schedule (4-10). However,
as we will see below, the first case allows us a continuous
cycle of “activity” if three groups of individuals are
considered.

Analysis of the (4-8) estrategy for a single group

Unlike the previous case, we now analyze the effects
of applying the lockdown-activity cycle during different
stages of the pandemic. Fig. 4 shows the evolution of
each stage (susceptible, exposed, infected and recovered)
as a function of time. We also plotted the case in which
the system is allowed to evolve freely, equivalent to
a “continuous activity” (red line). Starting from this
curve, we applied the lockdown-activity cycle at different
times of the evolution (see black lines).

normalized number of infected

(a)

As can be seen in Fig. 4, the number of susceptible
people decreases monotonically along time due to the
progressive spreading of the virus. Also, we can note that
once the lockdown-activity cycle has been implemented,
the number of susceptible people reaches, seemengly in
four weeks, an asymptotic regime. The same occurs with
the recovered individuals (see Fig. 4(d)), but in this case
they increases monotonically with time.

FIG. 3.
Normalized number of infected individuals along
time. The initial condition was s(0) = 0.9, s(0) = 0, s(0) =
0.1 and s(0) = 0. The reproduction number for the “always lockdown” was Rl = 0.6. On the other hand, in the
“lockdown-work cycle” we used Rw = 1.5 and Rl = 0.6.

We can further see in Fig. 3 that when applying the
cyclical strategy (blue line) there is an increase in the
number of cases due to the inclusion of the “activity”
stage (equivalent to the release of the lock-down). In
this sense, we can see that during this stage (see orange
bars) the number of infected grows, unlike what happens
in the “lock-down” stage (green bars).
Finally, we can observe a similar behavior when
applying cycles (4-8) and (4-10) in terms of the number

Notice that the behavior of the number of susceptibles
and recovered individuals is not affected by the start-up
time. That is, the number of susceptibles decreases
monotonically regardless of whether the population is
in the lock-down or activity stage (the same occurs in
the case of those recovered). However, we can observe a
completely different behavior in the case of the exposed
and the infected individuals. In this case, we can see that
their behavior is affected according to the time of the
evolution. Notice that the number of exposed individuals
grows during the “activity” stage. This can be explained
if we take into account that during the “activity” stage,
the frequency of contacts between susceptibles and
infected increases (through Rw ). Therefore, increases
the probability of transmitting the virus to a susceptible.
If this happens, the susceptible becomes to an exposed
one. The opposite occurs in the lock-down stage, where
there is a lower probability to transfer the virus.
Interesting, Fig. 4 also shows that the behavior of
the number of infected individuals during the “activity”
stage depends on the time of the intervention. That
is, we can observe that, before week 11, the number of
infected increases during the “activity” stage. Instead,

this behavior is reversed (decreases) from, approximately, this point. So, the return to the activity stage
does not affect the system in terms of an increase in the
number of infected. Furthermore, it should be noted
that this occurs before reaching the peak of the epidemic.

Up to now, we have analyzed how the epidemic evolves
when considering a single homogeneous group, which
can adopt a “lock-down” or “activity” behavior. In the
next Section we consider three groups of individuals. As
previously mentioned, this case allows optimizing the
strategy (4-8).

The reproduction number within each group is
Rii = βii /γii . We assume two possible situations:
normal working activity with Rii = Rw > 1, or, the
lock-down situation with Rii = Rl < 1. We further
assume two possible reproduction values between the
groups: a complete isolation (Rij = 0, i 6= j) or some
leakage among them (Rij  1, i 6= j).

We now focus on the population that appears splitted
into three groups i = 1, 2, 3. Recall that each group
cycles through a normal working period and a lock-down
period. The lock-down period fits into the mean time of
the infection (say, L = 8), while the working period lasts
for approximately a working week (W = 4). These 4 × 8
periods for each group are set shifted in time, according
to the schedule in Fig. 5.

the lock-down days are L = 8. (a) The three groups are

V.

The cyclical strategy decreases the amount of infected
people as the process evolves, regardless of the infection
leak among groups. However, if the groups remain
completely isolated, the strategy exhibits a better performance. Besides, late implementation of the strategy
provides poor results.

Fig. 7 shows similar results as in Fig. 6, but for a
weaker reproduction number. Notice that both scenarios
decrease the total number of infected people. Thus, the
4 × 8 strategy can be applied to a variety of infectious
diseases (that is, different R).

CONCLUSIONS

We studied the time evolution of an infection describable by a SEIR compartmental model. Specifically, we
implemented a cyclical asymmetric scheme by which the
total population is divided in 3 parts, each performing a
4 days normal activities period and an 8 days isolation
period. This sequence is performed by each group
comprising a third of the population in such a way
that, at any given time, one third of the population is
performing their usual “normal” duties. In this way the
solution of the SEIR equations indicate that the disease
can be controlled while keeping a sensible degree of
economical activity.
