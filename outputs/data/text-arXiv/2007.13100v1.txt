A second wave pandemic constitutes an imminent threat to society, with a potentially immense
toll in terms of human lives and a devastating economic impact. We employ the epidemic renormalisation group approach to pandemics, together with the first wave data for COVID-19, to efficiently
simulate the dynamics of disease transmission and spreading across different European countries.
The framework allows us to model, not only inter and extra European border control effects, but
also the impact of social distancing for each country. We perform statistical analyses averaging on
different level of human interaction across Europe and with the rest of the world. Our results are
neatly summarised as an animation reporting the time evolution of the first and second waves of
the European COVID-19 pandemic. Our temporal playbook of the second wave pandemic can be
used by governments, financial markets, the industries and individual citizens, to efficiently time,
prepare and implement local and global measures.

Pandemics are increasingly becoming a constant menace to the human race, with COVID-19 being the latest
example. A second wave is creeping back in Europe and
is poised to rage across the continent by fall 2020.
In this letter we provide a statistical analysis of the
temporal evolution of the second wave of infected cases,
with the impact for various European countries. To
model the spreading, we employ the epidemic Renormalisation Group (eRG) framework, recently developed in
[1, 2]. It can be mapped [2, 3] into a time-dependent
compartmental model of the SIR type [4]. The Renormalisation Group approach [5, 6] has a long history in
physics with impact from particle to condensed matter
physics and beyond. Its application to epidemic dynamics is complementary to other approaches [7–17].
The eRG approach consists in a set of first order differential equations apt to describe the time-evolution of
the infected cases in a specific isolated region. It has
been extended in [2] to include interactions among multiple regions of the world, without the need for powerful
numerical simulations. The set of equations [2] reads

with Ii (t) being the total number of infected cases per
million inhabitants for region i and ln indicating its natural logarithm. These equations embody, within a small
number of parameters, the pandemic spreading dynamics across coupled regions of the world via the temporal
evolution of αi , which resembles the energy dependence
of the interaction coupling appearing in fundamental interactions of particle physics.
The first term of the right-hand side in (1) characterises the epidemic evolution within a given region of
the world. The infection rate γi , measured in inverse
weeks, is responsible for how quick the epidemic evolves
in the i-th region. Besides depending on the intrinsic
virulent character of the epidemic, the size of γi can be
controlled via social-distancing measures, with a flatter
epidemic curve associated to smaller γi . It is well understood [4] that epidemic diffusion curves generally lead
to plateaus in the total number of infected cases at late
times. This is encoded in the parameter ai , equal to the
natural logarithm (ln) of the total number of infected
cases (per million) at the end of the epidemic wave.
The second term of the right-hand side in (1), first
introduced in [2], is a source-term that takes into account human interaction across different regions of the
world. Here, nmi is the population of region-i in millions
and kij represents the number of reciprocal travellers per
week from region i to region j and vice-versa in units of
million people. For a single country, i.e. France, we illustrate diagrammatically the connections given by the kij
couplings in Fig. 1. We also consider an extra-source of
infection modelled as a new region that we call Region-X
(i = 0). We can interpret this region in various ways: for
instance, this may represent an inflow of infections coming from outside of the regions of the world included in

2
the simulation or, alternatively, Region-X may represent
the effect of local hotspots of infections. Of course, it
could also be a combination of the two effects.

couples to some or all European countries we consider.
Another interpretation is that the coupling k0i to RegionX represents an internal source of infection inside the i-th
region. To provide a sensible value for the initial source,
we considered the current number of total infected (5.2
millions) normalised to the world population in millions.
Specifically, we randomly generate 100 copies of the
matrix kij to be used to repeat the simulation. The initial
time of the second wave simulations is the calendar week
25, where we set the initial values for αi = 0 (while α0 =
constant). We repeat the 100 simulations with the same
set of kij for five cases, where we modify the coupling to
Region-X as follows:
a) We use the randomly generated k0i = ki0 , in the
range 10−2 − 10−3 ;

FIG. 1. Illustration of the connections kij between, i.e.,
France and the other countries considered in this study. Each
line represents the exchange of infected cases. The line pointing outside the map represents the connection with Region-X,
whose role is explained in the main text.

METHODOLOGY

To simulate the European second wave, we use as input
parameters the values of γi and ai stemming from the
first wave. Predicting these parameters for the second
wave is hard, as shown for instance in Ref. [18] via a
stochastic SEIR model where very large fluctuations are
found. This is one of the reasons why we choose for our
simulations the parameters coming from the first wave.
Additionally this choice has the advantage of endowing
us with reasonable benchmark values. These parameters
depend on social distancing measures enacted by each
country during the first wave. The methodology of the
fit for γi and ai is described in [1, 2]. The values are
reported in the first three columns of Table I at 90%
confidence level. For the simulations we used the central
values.
We now move to the interaction across the different
European countries encoded in the matrix kij . We generate the entries of the matrix randomly with each value
in the interval 10−3 − 10−2 and a flat probability. This
translates in a range of 1k to 10k travellers per week
across countries. In our earlier work [2] this interval was
shown to be able to account for the peak delay in between
countries.
As mentioned earlier, we also consider the extra-source
of infection Region-X (i = 0) with a fixed number of
infected cases. This region couples to the different European countries with randomly generated k0i = ki0 in
the same range as above. To Region-X we can assign
different interpretations. One could be that of an extraEuropean source (say the rest of the world) that still

b) We divide the k0i by a factor of ten, implying a
90% reduction of the interaction with Region-X;
c) We divide the k0i by a factor of hundred, i.e. a 99%
reduction;
d) All the k0i are set to zero except one, which we
chose to be that of Spain;
e) All the k0i are set to zero except the ones for Croatia, Greece, Slovakia, Spain and Switzerland.
We consider the latter case e) as the most realistic, as
the five chosen countries already show signs of a second
wave as of calendar week 30. For each of these five cases,
we average over the 100 simulated matrices kij to extract
the location of the peak of the newly infected cases for
the second wave per each country. The results are summarised in last five columns of Table I with the errors
representing one standard deviation. The time is given
in 2020 calendar weeks.

RESULTS

We first discuss the results for the simulations in case
e), which are more realistic vis à vis the current situation
in Europe, as of week 30. As a test, in Fig. 2 we show
the outcome for Croatia, where we also include the first
wave from the fit, compared to the actual data points
(from worldometers.info). The blue curve is the result
of one of the 100 case e) simulations, while the orange
curve contains the same simulation shifted back by three
weeks. The shift could be achieved by increasing the
coupling ki0 for Croatia by about one order of magnitude (i.e. of the order of 0.1), to reflect the presence of
hotspots inside the country. This is already observable
from the data starting at week 25. The figure clearly
shows that the infection rate γ for the second wave is
very close to that of the first wave and that the simulation provides a reasonable understanding of the second

wave dynamics. For Croatia we also observe, however,
that the total number of infected cases for the second
wave is higher than for the first wave. It would be interesting to learn, from future data, whether this worrisome
trend is followed by other European countries. The figure
demonstrates that the result of our simple simulation can
be tuned to reproduce the beginning of the second wave
already observed in some countries. This fine tuning is,

however, beyond the scope of this work.
As an example of our results for other countries, we
show in Fig. 3 the epidemic dynamics of the first and second wave for three representatives: Italy, France and the
UK. The top panel shows the number of infected cases
(solid lines) not normalised per million as well as the
number of recovered cases (dashed curves). The central
panel shows the number of new infected cases while the
lower panel displays an estimate for the effective reproduction rate R. We also show the results for some of the
Nordic countries, i.e. Denmark, Norway and Finland, in
Fig. 4. The number of recovered cases R(t) is calculated
by solving the following SIR-inspired equation [2]:


dR
=  eα(t) − R(t) ,
(3)
dt
where we fix the recovery rate  = 0.1 in the numerical
solutions. The effective reproduction rate R is estimated
by computing the ratio of the new infected cases over the
new recoveries within the susceptible population, from
the theoretical model. The susceptible population is here
defined as the total number of people infected at late time
for the first and second waves independently. A more accurate result could be obtained using the generalised eRG
approach of Ref. [3], at the expense of introducing more
parameters. The plots are obtained using the simulations
for case e). The height of the second wave peaks are the
same as for the first wave because we used the same γ’s
and a’s stemming from the first wave fit. One could allow for variations of these values, however the qualitative
temporal picture of our results would remain similar.

FIG. 3. Result of case e) for France, Italy and the UK. We show the time evolution of the total number of infected (solid) and
recovered (dashed) cases in the top panel, the new infected in the central panel and the derived reproduction rate R0 in the
bottom panel. The number of cases refer to the total population of the countries. The shown solutions have a peak position
close to the average value from the 100 simulations.

To study the dependence of the peak timing on kij ,
γi and ai , we can use the results from cases a), b) and
c) from Table I, as visualised in Fig. 5. Here we show
the average peak time in calendar weeks versus γ for all
the countries in this study. Comparing the results in each
set of simulations, we discover a clear correlation between
the timing of the peak and the infection rate γi of each
country. The higher is the infection rate the sooner the
peak is reached. Furthermore, comparing the results for
the three cases, we show that reducing the coupling with
Region-X systematically delays the peaks, in accordance
with results reported in [2]. Quantitatively a reduction
of a factor ten in the coupling to Region-X delays the
peaks by about three weeks. We recall that, following the
possible interpretations of Region-X, a reduction of the
couplings to this region can be seen as the effect of travel
bans and/or better control of local hotspots. Overall the
peak timing ranges from end of July 2020 to beginning
2021. We did not find any correlation between the peak
timing and the value of ai across the countries we studied.
The results of cases d) and e), where only a few coun-

tries act as hotspots, as summarised in Table I, show a
common feature: the peak timing of the hotspot countries is essentially the same we found in the unrestricted
case a), as stemming from the k0i values, while the peak
timing for the other countries is substantially delayed.
The fewer hotspots, 1 as in case d), the more delayed
the peak. The results for case e), are shown in Fig. 6,
with the hotspot countries highlighted in red. It should
be clear that the a’s and the γ’s chosen for the simulation can, and will, be different from the first wave values
we used. Nevertheless, we expect the dynamics to be
still well represented by the framework and that these
values give a reasonable indication for the second wave
European pandemic.

this hypothesis is straightforward in our approach, but
such parameter tuning is not the point of this work. We
then performed statistical analyses averaging on different
level of cross Europe interactions and with the rest of the
world. The role of the rest of the world and possibly local
hotspots has been attributed to a Region-X, which acts
as a source of infection coupled to all or only few European countries. By calibrating on the current European
situation that shows early signs of the second wave, we
provided a temporal playbook of the second wave pandemic. Our results can be employed by governments,
financial markets and the industry world to implement
local and global measures.

the second wave peak, once started, is rather solid and

and social distancing measures.
In the added material, we also include an animation
representing the time evolution of the first and second
wave of the European COVID-19 pandemic resulting
from one of our simulations close to the average result
over 100 simulations for the most realistic case. The
simplicity of the eRG approach is such that the simulations take only a few seconds on an average personal
laptop, thus providing a practical and accurate tool for
the understanding of a second (and third, and so on)
wave pandemic. The temporal playbook we provide is a
useful tool for governments, financial markets, the industries and individual citizens to prepare in advance and
possibly counter the threat of recurring pandemic waves.
