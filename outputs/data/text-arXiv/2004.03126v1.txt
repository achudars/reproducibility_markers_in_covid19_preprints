Summary
Background Restrictive mass quarantine or lockdown has been implemented as the most
important controlling measure to fight against COVID-19. Many countries have enforced
2 - 4 weeks’ lockdown and are extending the period depending on their current disease
scenario. Most probably the 14-day period of estimated communicability of COVID-19
prompted such decision. But the idea that, if the susceptible population drops below certain threshold, the infection would naturally die out in small communities after a fixed time
(following the outbreak), unless the disease is reintroduced from outside, was proposed by
Bartlett in 1957. This threshold was termed as Critical Community Size (CCS).
Methods We propose an SEIR model that explains COVID-19 disease dynamics. Using
our model, we have calculated country-specific expected time to extinction (TTE) and CCS
that would essentially determine the ideal number of lockdown days required and size of
quarantined population.
Findings With the given country-wise rates of death, recovery and other parameters, we
1

have identified that, if at a place the total number of susceptible population drops below
CCS, infection will cease to exist after a period of TTE days, unless it is introduced from
outside. But the disease will almost die out much sooner. We have calculated the countryspecific estimate of the ideal number of lockdown days.
Interpretation Thus, smaller lockdown phase is sufficient to contain COVID-19. On a
cautionary note, our model indicates another rise in infection almost a year later but on a
lesser magnitude.
Funding No funding to disclose.

Introduction
Research in context Several countries have resorted to restrictive mass quarantine or
lockdown as it has been proved to be the most effective strategy to fight against the prevailing SARS-CoV2 or COVID-19 pandemic. To prevent stage III spreading of the virus
or human-to-human transmission, various countries have imposed variable number of lockdown days that ranges from 2 − 4 weeks. Depending on the real-time situation, various
nations are updating on their lockdown period. However, it was not possible to determine
or predict accurately the ideal number of lockdown days in advance as we are all fighting
against a novel virus. Still, based on the nature of pandemics and epidemics in the past
and the successful mode of encounter with them, the human race has learnt how to fight
out the disease, in absence of any specific treatment. Mostly on the basis of the average
incubation period of SARS-CoV2 virus, countries have devised the phase of lockdown. In
the present day, the COVID-19 pandemic figures from developed countries have surpassed
the figures from China, from where this infection had originated. In such a dire situation,
it is very difficult to propose quintessential lockdown period specific to any country. The
whole world is struggling to obtain unbiased data to predict on the pandemic. But even
then many questions arise in our minds as “Will the implemented number of lockdown
days eradicate the virus?” or “Will it come soon again after the lockdown is over?” or like
“How soon will the next wave of infection occur, if it comes back again?” Answer to these
questions lies in the idea of critical community size (CCS) from Soper1 and Bartlett’s2, 3
works in 1920s and 1950s.
Added value of this study Our study provides a rationale behind the determination

2

of the lockdown period in different countries going through the catastrophic effect of the
pandemic. Moreover, we provide country-wise expected time to extinction (TTE) of the
disease and the number of people who could safely stay together or quarantine themselves
together in clusters. The most interesting observation from our study is that the lockdown
of 2 weeks or more (country-specific) will eradicate the disease almost completely. We term
this period as Temporary Eradication of Spread Time (TEST) for disease, which is much
less than the TTE of the disease. But there will be more waves of infection after different
period of time in different countries. Soothing part from our deduction is that the virus
will not be able to create any havoc on its return.
Implications of all the available evidence In this scenario of utter dilemma, with
the available world-wide data, we have provided country-wise estimates of the ideal lockdown phases using our proposed mathematical model. To the best of our knowledge, any
guideline for country-wise mathematical prediction of lockdown days is not available till
date. So, as the famous British statistician George E. P. Box pointed out, “All models are
wrong but some are useful”, we only hope that our deductions will provide some helpful
suggestion to the world, where we are all struck in the pandemic.
In the face of COVID-19 pandemic, many countries have implemented restrictive mass
quarantines or lockdown as the primary controlling measure to confine the number of secondary transmission of the disease within countries. In absence of any specific medicine to
treat the disease, patients are given supportive care to help them breathe. But given the
mode of transmission of the epidemic, health care systems of even developed countries are
crumbling down within a week or two. So along with many other countries densely populated India has resorted to complete lockdown for 3 weeks to prevent stage III transmission
of the disease. Available data confirms that the pandemic has affected a million people
in around 200 countries till date and already claimed more than 0.05 million lives across
the world within approximately two months. After World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the outbreak as a pandemic, many countries initiated partial to complete lockdown
as done in some provinces of China after the outbreak started and by the end of March,
one-third of the global population is under some form of lockdown.
Many countries implemented variable number of lockdown days, but no country has
come up with any magic figure for the ideal period of lockdown. No clear-cut guideline
or rationale behind the number of lockdown days has been announced by any country or
WHO till date to the best our knowledge. The period of 2 - 4 weeks is determined mostly
on the trial and error basis. The prediction on the number of trial lockdown days could be
3

possibly and partially based on the fact that, an affected individual could be contagious in
the first 14 days of contracting the disease and the number of known positive cases at the
time of taking decision.
Idea of quarantining a small group of people after an epidemic outbreak to arrest the
disease dates back to 1950s when English statistician M.S. Bartlett introduced critical
community size. Bartlett2, 3 proposed the idea that if the susceptible population is below
a certain some threshold, the infection is as likely as not to die out after a period of time
(after the epidemic outbreak) in small communities, unless the disease is reintroduced from
outside. Bartlett termed this threshold as Critical Community Size (CCS). In the present
context, CCS could guide government / health policy makers with an objective strategy of
lockdown period as opposed to subjective trial and error phases of lockdown.
After an epidemic outbreak in a community, the infection persists long enough to engulf
the entire susceptible population. Local extinction of the disease could be possible if the
susceptible population gets depleted. In large communities, the tendency of eventual damp
down of the recurrent epidemics is balanced by random variability. But in small communities the infection would die out when the number of susceptible falls below a certain
threshold, which is the CCS. Only a limited number of works4, 5 including our work (under
review) are available on CCS, may be because it involves complicated calculations even for
simplest mathematical model viz. SI (S: Susceptible, I: Infected) model. However, since the
actual extent of an epidemic can be assessed only retrospectively, it is essential to calculate
the CCS for COVID-19 based on a realistic model that depends on the parameters which
could be determined for a specific locality.
We propose an SEIR (S: Susceptible, E: Exposed, I: Infected, R: Recovered) model
to explain the disease dynamics of COVID-19. We have derived with evidence the rationale behind the importance and extent of the lockdown period and also the number of people who could safely stay together in this lockdown phase. In absence of
much prior knowledge on the disease, we have to rely on the mathematical predictions
to combat the virus. In this article, we provide a cautionary note from the mathematical deductions, that this pandemic will last more than an year and may start afresh
again. Our work resonates the leaked news in the American daily The New York Times
(https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-plan.html) that official authority as well as experts anticipates that the pandemic “will last 18 months or
longer” and could include “multiple waves” of infection.
But there is always a ray of hope. This nature of epidemic is also seen previously after
SARS or MERS outbreak. Our deduction reveals that there is nothing to panic as the
lockdown, if properly followed, could almost wipe out the disease and the next wave of
4

infection will not really recur as an alarming pandemic. Although we have to bear the
burden of economic sluggishness or downfall, the COVID-19 epidemic could be controlled
and hopefully won’t create a public health emergency in the near future.

Methods
We propose an SEIR model to explain the dynamics of COVID-19 infection. The entire
population is divided into four compartments. These compartments are mutually exclusive
in the sense that no person can belong to more than one compartment at any time point.
The four compartments are: susceptible individuals (S), individuals with and without
symptoms of the disease but not yet tested positive for COVID-19 (E), infected individuals
who are clinically tested positive (I), and individuals who are known to have recovered
from the disease (R). Note that an individual belonging to class E may transmit the disease
during the incubation period, which is approximately 1-14 days. Under this situation, we
consider the model as:
dS
dt
dE
dt
dI
dt
dR
dt

= Λ − β (I(t) + φE(t))
= β (I(t) + φE(t))

S(t)
− µS(t)
N

S(t)
− (γ + µ)E(t)
N

(1)
(2)

= γE(t) − (δ + µ + d)I(t)

(3)

= δI(t) − µR(t)

(4)

Here β represents the contact rate for COVID-19 transmission from infected to susceptible individuals, φ is the proportion of the exposed who could transmit the disease, an
individual in E moves to I at the rate γ, δ is the recovery rate, d is death rate due to the
disease and µ is the natural birth/death rate in the population. Here, Λ = µN (t) where
N (t) is the population size at time t.
The most important quantity in this type of model is the basic reproduction number,
which is:
R0 =

β(φ(δ + µ + d) + γ)
(γ + µ)(δ + µ + d)

Our method of evaluation of CCS depends on the parameters of the model and it
involves a series of mathematical derivation and processes (See Supplementary Material).
First we develop a fully stochastic model corresponding to the deterministic model (1)(4). Assuming quasi-stationarity and non-extinction of infection, we derive expected TTE
i.e E(τQ ) of the disease. E(τQ ) involves some probability terms that we evaluate using
diffusion approximation of the scaled state variables (S, E, I, R). τQ is a function of the
CCS. We derive quasi-period T̂0 (say) in terms of angular frequency that is obtained using
linearised system at equilibrium points. Then using the relation E(τQ ) log 2 = Tˆ0 ,4 we
could finally evaluate the CCS for the system. Note that this CCS is a function of the
parameters involved in the model that vary from country to country, even from one region
to another. Thus CCS is not any unique value for all regions or countries.
Note that the calculation of CCS involves a series of complicated processes and mathematics that demand few approximations at some stages. So we also did simulations with
realistic parameter values for different countries. The simulation study matches with the
theoretical findings.

Results
For COVID-19 transmission, we have calculated the CCS and TTE of the disease based
on our proposed SEIR model. Note that the value of the CCS is approximate as we have
made some mathematical approximation while applying diffusion approximation to find the
quasi-stationary distribution. The value of CCS for a community or a country, depends on
the model parameters specific to that community. We deduce these parameters from the
available information on COVID-19 till date.
Actual fatality rate due to any epidemic could only be calculated after the epidemic
gets over. But in the middle of the pandemic, it is difficult to assess. So we determine the
country-specific death rate (d) based on the number of deaths up to April 01, 2020 and
the total number of infected individuals till 7 days prior to this date. Here we assume that
COVID-19 patients do not die within the first seven 7 days after detection.
Different countries have implemented varying criteria of discharging COVID-19 patients from hospitals (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/
COVID-19-Discharge-criteria.pdf) making the actual recovery rate very tricky to calculate amid the pandemic. It is yet unknown whether all the discharged patients have
fully recovered from the disease or they got sick again shortly after (https://www.cdc.
gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/faq.html). So we have assumed the recovery rate (δ)

6

based on the number of recovered patients up to April 01, 2020 and the total number of
infected individuals till 14 days prior to this date. The country-specific death and recovery
rates are obtained from https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/.
On exposure to COVID-19 infected patient when a person gets infected, the virus itself
makes enough copies of itself in the host (that is the person who was exposed to the infected
patient) within some time, which the host begins to shed through coughs or sneezes or other
transmission methods. Assuming that within the time taken by the virus to replicate itself,
the host will not shed the virus out of its body and hence the host will not be contagious
within this period. This time is usually little more than one day of the exposure. So, we
have assumed that after day 1 of the exposure to the virus, the host becomes contagious,
i.e an exposed person has 93% chance of transmitting the infection as that of an infected
1
= 0.93.
person. Since the incubation period of COVID-19 is 14 days, we take φ = 1 − 14
Another very tricky and country dependent parameter is the rate of detection of positive
cases from among the exposed pool of people, i.e. percentage of exposed people that are
actually tested to be COVID-19 positive. In absence of manpower and testing kits in such
a dire situation, we will not be able to know the actual proportion of the exposed who could
later on become COVID-19 patient. We have assumed it to be 30% (across the world) that
is, γ = 0.3. The rate of natural birth or death is taken as µ = 0.015 that stabilises the
population under normal scenario. In absence of actual contact rate (β), we have assumed
β over a feasible range of values.
We represent the country-wise CCS and expected TTE of the disease in Figure 1. For
example, the CCS for Belgium (represented by the brown line in Figure 1A) lies between
34 and 52 while the expected TTE of the disease (represented by the brown line in Figure
1C) varies between 500 and 693 days for different contact rates in the range 0.31 to 0.37.
Therefore, for a particular contact rate β = 0.37 say, the CCS of Belgium is 34 means
that, if the susceptible population of any community in Belgium is below 34, the infection
will die out unless it is re-introduced from outside after the corresponding expected TTE,
which is 599 days.
But we observe that the number of infections falls below 0.5 after around 16 days when
the community size of quarantined people drops to the CCS value 34 (as shown in Figure
2). Thus in this case the disease gets nearly eradicated after 16 days, but it may come
back again like any other epidemic disease before actually becoming extinct. However,
after TEST it will not likely to create a pandemic as in the current situation. We observe
that the number of infections drops below 0.5 after around 15 − 30 days in most of the
countries. For example, in India we observe that TEST is 24 days. (Figure 3). So even if
the expected TTE of the disease is more than an year, it will almost cease to exist after a

Figure 2: TTE of Belgium is 599 days corresponding to CCS of 34 but the disease almost becomes extinct

be unable to create a pandemic as in the current situation.

Discussion
The earlier the lockdown starts, the better it is for any community. With the delay in the
number of days to initiate lockdown, time for the disease to slow down will increase in the
absence of any specific treatment to COVID-19. Before any country enters stage III of the
epidemic, in absence of vaccination or any specific treatment, complete quarantine will be
able to contain the disease from spreading further. Our work suggests that if people are

quarantined in small groups presented by country-specific CCS, the disease will become
extinct after the corresponding expected TTE. But it becomes almost extinct after around
TEST. So lockdown should to be taken very seriously to fight against the pandemic. This
paper provides evidence of the fact that even after the lockdown phase, multiple waves of
the disease will re-occur but it will not create pandemic situation.
In the present situation where contact tracing of the infected has attracted worldwide attention to trace down the exposed individuals, we suggest to quarantine them in

groups as small as country-specific CCS, so that after 15 − 30 days (as specified for each
country) the disease would become almost extinct unless any infection is re-introduced
from outside. There could be some mathematical limitations due to some approximations
in the calculation of CCS and expected TTE of the disease. But the approximations are
inevitable and do not affect much the actual CCS or TTE as reflected from our numerical
evaluation.
11

Another undeniable consequence of the current pandemic is the great negative impact
on the economy. This is further magnified due to almost paralysed transactions in many
sectors due to lockdown. Moreover, there is a fear among the general population that if
any infection pops up, it might create another round of spread of the disease. This fear,
which is not completely unrealistic, may extend the lockdown further. However, after the
scheduled lockdown period, if any individual gets infected and a few others get exposed to
that person, we need to check whether the total number of such individuals is less than
the CCS. If so, this group needs to be quarantined and the rest of the population would
be free from immediate danger. However, if the exposed group is larger than the CCS,
we recommend to split them in subgroups, each of size at most CCS and quarantine them
separately. However, careful and detail surveillance is required to trace all such exposed and
infected individuals. Moreover, this localised lockdown or quarantine would help flowing
the daily life and might prevent, at least to some extent, the economy from being further
weak.
CCS has another implication in allocation and arrangement of hospital beds in the
quarantine/hospital facilities. If the CCS is 30 (say), a block of 30 or less number of beds
should arranged so that total movement within this block, including patients and healthcare
people should not exceed that number. Otherwise if one big room accommodates a large
number of patients, secondary infection may start spreading. Our model is capable of
estimating the average number of testing kits and hospitalisations required in advance to
some extent, depending on the available data.
However, lockdown in its truest sense may not be feasible in a vast and diverse country
like India. So targeted or focused lockdown of selected high risk population might be a
cost effective option compared to a generalised lockdown. This would mean saturating
screening for cases and identifying the critical number of contacts.
So the take away message in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic is that till the end
of expected TTE (country-specific) of the disease we have to be careful. With further onset
of COVID-19 symptoms in the future, we should follow quarantine rules strictly. Like any
other epidemic, COVID-19 has the tendency to recur but it will not create any alarming
pandemic in the future provided we keep a vigilant eye on our hygiene and have vaccination
and treatment in the future.
