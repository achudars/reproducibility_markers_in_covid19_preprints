Abstract
We introduce the concept of epidemic-fitted wavelets which comprise, in particular, as special cases the number I(t) of infectious individuals at time t in classical
SIR models and their derivatives. We present a novel method for modelling epidemic dynamics by a model selection method using wavelet theory and, for its
applications, machine learning based curve fitting techniques. Our universal models are functions that are finite linear combinations of epidemic-fitted wavelets.
We apply our method by modelling and forecasting, based on the John Hopkins
University dataset, the spread of the current Covid-19 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic
in France, Germany, Italy and the Czech Republic, as well as in the US federal
states New York and Florida.

Keywords: epidemic-fitted wavelet, epidemic dynamics, model selection, curve fitting,
Covid-19 spread predicting.

Introduction

The present work proposes a novel method for modelling epidemic dynamics by combining wavelet theory and data-driven model section techniques in machine learning.
In understanding epidemic diffusion and growth rate of an infectious disease at
population level, the actual number of reported cases of infections always plays a (if
not even the) crucial role - and, way beyond that, at least in the case of diseases afflicting
human societies, directly influences government and health care system decisions and
measures regarding, e.g., protection, containment and hospital capacities.

However, due to both the manifold practical as well as conceptual issues involved,
a rigorous and accurate detection of this number turns out to be a rather difficult and
complex problem.
To illustrate at least some of the theoretical difficulties involved here by a prominent
and important case which calls the entire world now to action, let us note that most
current mathematical modelling and forecasting techniques for the spread of the Covid19 disease are based on classical SIR (Susceptible - Infectious - Recovered/Removed)
and SEIR (Susceptible - Exposed - Infectious - Recovered/Removed) compartmental
epidemiological models [24, 6, 49].
Yet, with regard to predicting the number of infectious cases I(t) at time t, they
suffer from severe and model-inherent principal limitations:
All these models, as well as all their derivatives, are not suitable to build a model for
the function I(t) which is compatible with any given population. This is because these
models are based on the assumption that the population is homogeneously composed
and distributed (i.e., the chance that an arbitrary infected person will infect an arbitrary
susceptible person is taken to be constant throughout the epidemic, and, moreover, it
is assumed that at any given time every infected person has one and the same constant
chance to recover).
In real life, however, there are actually many and rather diverse waves of outbreaks,
stemming from different times or locations. One faces here not only drastically varying
growth rates, but also hot spots versus no-cluster locations, infection rates depending on
age or other parameters, etc. which altogether entails that the homogeneity assumption
approach taken in SIR models and their variations is over-simplified and cannot give
realistic forecasts.
To overcome the draw-backs caused by homogeneity assumptions, the new approach
presented in this work is based on the following idea: we shall decompose the growth
curve of infection numbers into several basic ’waves’, where each basic wave is considered
as a representation of the epidemic, and localised both in time and position.
This point of view naturally calls for the use of wavelet theory. Wavelets as such are
special families of functions which came up in the 1980s by combining older concepts
from mathematics, computer science, electrical engineering and physics, having since
then found fruitful applications in many other disciplines. In particular, some precursor,
wave-based approaches to modelling epidemic growth appeared already a long time
before wavelets emerged in both deterministic and stochastic models, compare, among
others, [46, 3, 4, 28], and only very recently, Krantz et al. (compare [27]) Moreover, the
latter work has also proposed building epidemic growth models by combining wavelet
with discrete graph theory (see also below).
In this article, we propose an approach to epidemic dynamics by modelling the
number of daily reported cases using specially designed wavelets, called epidemic-fitted
(EF) wavelets.
For instance, the number I(t) of infectious individuals at time t in the classical SIR
and SEIR models is an EF wavelet, see Subsection 3.4. Another example of an EF
wavelet is the log-normal one, which we will use in our Covid-19 spread forecasting
2

applications, see subsections 4.1, 3.4 for more details.
In our approach, the number of daily reported cases is the value of a function that is
a positive linear combination of N EF wavelets at the given day. We fix the number N
of summands of EF wavelets entering in our modelling function (and in our applications
N is usually taken to be 3 or 5). The wavelet series coefficients themselves are then
obtained by machine learning based curve fitting methods with square loss function,
see subsections 2.2 and 4.1.
We then proceed with specific applications to Covid-19 scenarios. Here we present,
now using in addition data-driven machine learning based curve fitting, some of our
model’s predictions to selected countries and US federal states, which are based on
the currently existing respective data for these locations provided by the most recent
numbers supplied by the Johns Hopkins University Covid-19 database.
Before mentioning and commenting upon other related works, let us adopt from now
on, and throughout all following parts of the present work, the following convention: as
we shall consider only reported cases in our paper, we will omit the adjective ’reported’
from ’reported cases of infected’.
In [5], the authors present three basic ’macroscopic’ models to fit data emerging
from local and national governments: exponential growth, self-exciting branching process and compartmental models. The compartmental models are the classical SIR and
SEIR models, the self-exciting branching process has been used before with regard to
treating Ebola disease outbreaks and other dynamics of social interaction. In the exponential growth model, the number I(t) of infectious individuals at time t is expressed
as I(t) = I0 eαt , where α is the rate constant. The exponential growth model is related
to our approach, in which the exponential function is modelling the reported infections.
However, since this is a one-parameter model, it works only well for fitting the data at
the beginning of an outbreak.
In [34] the authors use a log-normal density function with three parameters to fit
the daily reported cases. But since they tried to fit the data with only one function,
the curve of reported cases may not be well fitted, since there are usually several waves
of the epidemic for a period while one function presents only one wave. As explained
above, our wavelet approach does overcome this difficulty.
In [48], the authors use the function f (x) = k.γ.β.αβ .x−1−β . exp(−γ(α/x)β ) to fit
all data. This method, too, can fit the data only for one wave.
In [12] the authors fit the data of daily reported cases with a two-wave model, using
the sum of two Gaussian functions.
In [9], the authors introduce an epidemic model composed of overlapping subepidemic waves, where each single one is a generalized logistic growth model given
by solution of differential equations. A short term forecast of the Covid-19 epidemic in
China from February 5th to February 24th was given in [41] using three phenomenological models (generalized logistic growth model, the Richards growth model, sub-epidemic
wave model in [9]) and ensemble methods (see also [10] for the ensemble approach in
forecasting epidemic trajectories).
3

In [25], a multi-wave model combining several SIR models, namely, a Multiple-Wave
Forced-SIR model, was introduced to fit the data of daily cases.
Recently, Krantz et al. [27] have proposed an approach to construct epidemic growth
models using fractional wavelets. These are built from the number of reported cases to
construct wavelets that model the dynamics of the number of completed cases ([27]). In
their paper, the number of completed cases is the sum of the number of reported cases
and the number of unreported cases. Furthermore, the proposed approach there is to
update their models assuming the availability of the reporting error which improves
over time and tends to zero eventually. This assumption appears to us, however, as a
too idealistic one.
Those two last approaches are the ones which are most closely related to our own.
However, while those use single waves coming from solutions differential equations,
we use general wavelet functions such as Gaussian functions, log-normal functions,
Gompertz density functions, and Beta prime density functions, which all satisfy our
general condition of being epidemic-fitted in the sense of Definition 2.
We also refer to [15, 16, 20, 53, 18, 52, 40, 2, 29, 14, 42, 35, 22, 1, 26, 19, 51, 54,
31, 32, 33, 11, 43, 44] for other approaches on modelling and forecasting the spread of
Covid-19 epidemic using deep learning, machine learning, time series analysis, network
model, stochastic model and deterministic compartmental framework.
The remaining parts of the present paper are organized as follows:
In section 2 we first recall the notion of a wavelet (Definition 1) and the fundamental
theorem of wavelet theory (Theorem 1) whiche we are going to put to use in the sequel.
We proceed by introducing the notion of an epidemic-fitted (EF) wavelet (Definition 2)
and propose our method for modelling epidemic dynamics (Proposition 1), justified by
the fundamental theorem 1. In Section 3 we consider several important examples of EF
wavelets and impose constraints on an EF wavelet to be suitable as a basic EF wavelet
in epidemic dynamics. In Section 4 we present applications of our method to modelling
and forecasting the current spread of Covid-19 in France, Germany, Italy, the Czech
Republic and several US federal states, all based on the most recent JHU data.

Epidemic Modelling via Wavelet Theory and Machine Learning
Wavelets

In this subsection, we recall and collect some basic concepts and facts from Wavelet
Theory (cf. [13, 38, 39]), which will be needed in our approach for modelling epidemic
dynamics.

Definition 1 [13, p.24] A wavelet or (mother wavelet) is a function ψ ∈ L1 (R) such
that the following admissibility condition holds:
Cψ =

Z ∞

|ψ̂(ξ)|2

−∞

dξ
< ∞,
|ξ|

where ψ̂ is the Fourier transform of ψ, i.e, ψ̂(ξ) =

R
R

(1)

ψ(x)e−iξx dx.

Notice that condition (1) is only satisfied if ψ̂(0) = 0 or
we have the following sufficient condition for (1).

R

Lemma 1 [13, p.24] Let ψ ∈ L1 (R) and R ψ(x)dx = 0. If
for some α > 0, then |ψ̂(ξ)| ≤ C|ξ|min(α,1) and Cψ < ∞.

R

R

ψ(x)dx = 0. Conversely,

R

|ψ(x)|(1 + |x|)α dx < ∞

A basic example of a wavelet is the function
ψ(t) =

sin(2πt) − sin(πt)
.
πt

From a mother wavelet one can generate other wavelets (called children wavelets), using
affine transformations (i.e., dilations and translations):
!

t−b
ψa,b (t) = q ψ
,
a
|a|

(a, b) ∈ R × R.

These wavelets provide us with the following decomposition of L2 (R):
Theorem 1 [13, Proposition 2.4.1 and p. 25-26] Let ψ be a mother wavelet. Then any
f ∈ L2 (R) decomposes as
dadb
,
a2
R2
strongly in L2 (R), where <, > denotes the standard product in L2 (R), i.e.,
f = Cψ−1

Z
1/A1 ≤|a|≤A2 ,|b|≤B

< f, ψa,b > ψa,b

dadb
kL2 = 0.

(3)

Any function f ∈ L2 (R) can then be written as a superposition of ψak ,b` , i.e.,
f (x) =

X

αk,` ψak ,b` (x).

k,l

We refer to [13] for more details on the analysis of discrete wavelet decomposition, and,
especially, for precise formulas for the coefficients αk,` .
Notice that from a machine learning point of view, finding the αk,` , ak , b` can be
thought of as a curve fitting problem, and this is how we will combine wavelet theory
and machine learning techniques in our approach to modelling epidemic dynamics.

2.2

Epidemic-fitted wavelets and modelling

As we already explained in the introduction, the time development of an epidemic
features local as well as global wave-type phenomena.
This leads us to the concept of epidemic-fitted wavelets. Informally speaking, such
a wavelet is given by a positive real function W : R → R>0 , whose value W (t) at a
given time t describes the number of new infected cases in a homogeneous population
with respect to an epidemic that occurs in one wave only and thus will satisfy some
sort of homogeneous compartmental model (without network structure).
Since we are interested in the daily infected cases, we can assume that W (t) is
strictly positive but tends to 0 when t tends to ±∞. Setting w(t) = ln W (t) so that
W (t) = ew(t) , the (multiplicative) growth rate of W is its log-derivative:
Ẇ (t)
= ẇ(t).
W
We wish W (t) to ’start’ at t = a, (reach its) ’peak’ at t = χ, and ’stop’ at t = b
(a < χ < b). This is to say that w(a) = w(b) = 0, ẇ(χ) = 0, ẇ(t) > 0 for t < χ and
ẇ(t) < 0 for t > χ.
Definition 2 Given an interval (a, b) ⊂ R, a ≥ 0, an epidemic-fitted wavelet is a
positive real function ψ ∈ L1 ((a, b), R+ ) such that ψ has start-peak-stop behavior, i.e, ψ
satisfies limx→a+ ψ(x) = limx→b− ψ(x) = 0, and ψ admits its maximum at some point
in (a, b).
We can interpret ψ as a wavelet ψ̃ in the of Definition 1 by simply setting ψ̃(x) :=
ψ(x) for x ∈ (a, b), ψ̃(x)
:= −ψ(|x|) for x R< −a, and ψ(x) = 0 otherwise. Indeed, this
R
definition implies that R ψ̃(x)dx = 0 and R |ψ̃(x)|(1 + |x|)dx < ∞, hence Cψ̃ < ∞ by
Lemma 1 and ψ̃ is a wavelet.
First examples of EF wavelets which come to mind are polynomial functions of
degree 3 (restricted to some finite interval). Other examples of functions with startpeak-stop behavior are Gaussian functions, log-normal functions, Gompertz density
functions
ψb,c (x) = bc exp(c + bx − cebx ),
(4)
and, in SIR models, the solution function giving the number of I(t), the number of
infectious individuals. (cf. [8]), etc.
In our applications to real data (see Section 4), we will employ log-normal functions
as epidemic-fitted (EF) wavelets.
For treating an epidemic, we will concentrate on the curve of daily (reported) infected cases, denoted by RC(t), and try to understand the epidemic growth based on
this information.
Theorem 1 implies that our following ansatz is ’asymptotically’ correct, as the number N grows to infinity. In particular, numerical simulations involving bigger and bigger
numbers N will lead to better and better accuracy.
6

Proposition 1 (Ansatz) A positive function (or curve) whose value is the number of
infected cases at time t is representable as a finite linear combination of epidemic-fitted
wavelets:
RC(t) =

N
X

αi Wi (t, θi ),

(5)

i=1

where each such wavelet Wi can be obtained from a basic (mother) EF wavelet ψ by
adding some parameters θi = (θi1 , . . . , θik ).
Using this ansatz, we shall model epidemic dynamics by finding the wavelet series
coefficients αi and θi in the decomposition (5), when given the number of infected cases
over a sufficient long time frame.
This amounts to solving a curve fitting problem in machine learning.

Epidemic-fitted (EF) wavelets

In this section, we introduce some epidemic models with different basic (mother)
epidemic-fitted (EF) wavelets. In section 4 we show by fitting the Covid-19 data that
log-normal EF wavelet models are highly compatible with the data and lead to very
good forecast projections.

3.1

Gaussian EF wavelets

The standard Gaussian function is a fundamental example of a function which has
start-peak-stop behavior and exponential growth:
ψ : R+ → (0, 1]
x 7→ exp(−x2 /2).
After dilating and translating, we obtain a general Gaussian function
!

(x − b)2
.
ψb,c (x) = exp −
2c2
We remark that in general limx→−∞ ψb,c (x) = 0, but for certain b, c > 0 we have
ψb,c (0)  1. In this case, we can simply set ψ̃(x) = max(ψb,c (x) − ψb,c (0), 0) as the
corresponding Gaussian EF wavelet.
In [12] the authors fitted the data of daily reported cases with a two-wave model
using the sum of two Gaussian functions. However, since these are symmetric with
respect to the the vertical line x = b, this model may be not compatible with the curve
of daily cases. We will explain this point in further detail in the next section.

7

3.2

Log-normal EF wavelets

We define here the log-normal function, which is a Gaussian function in which the
variable x is interchanged by log x:
ψb,c : R+ → (0, 1]
x 7→ exp(−

(log x − b)2
).
2c2

We then define the corresponding log-normal wavelet by extending
ψb,c (x) = − exp(−

(log(−x) − b)2
),
2c2

for x < 0.

Thus we can rewrite
( 12 log(x2 ) − b)2
.
ψb,c (x) = sgn(x) exp −
2c2
!

By dilating and translating, we obtain a general log-normal EF wavelet
( 1 log(x − d)2 − b)2
ψb,c,d (x) = exp − 2
.
2c2
!

Figure 1 depicts the graph of the log-normal function with scaling coefficient
ψ(x) = a exp(−

(log x − b)2
), x > 0.
2c2

Figure 1: Log-normal graph

3.3

Further examples of EF wavelets

Based on probability distributions, we can also choose many other functions to build a
basic EF wavelet.
8

For example, one can start here from Gompertz density functions
ψb,c (x) = bc exp(c + bx − cebx ),

(6)

or Beta prime density functions
ψb,c (x) = xb−1 (1 + x)−b−c /B(b, c),

(7)

where B is the Beta function.
For appropiately chosen parameters b, c, they all satisfy the epidemic-fitted condition
in Definition 2
Another important class of EF wavelets is given by the function reporting the number of infectious individuals I(t) in compartmental SIR models and their variations
(such as SEIR and SIRD models, etc.)
The SIR (compartmental) model was introduced by W. O. Kermack and A. G.
McKendrick [24], in which they considered a fixed population with only three compartments, and the numbers S(t) (for ’susceptible’), I(t) (for ’infectious’), and R(t) (for
’recovered’ (or ’removed’)).

N
dR

(8)
(9)
(10)

In Figure 2 these curves show the number of infectious individuals I(t).
In general, I(t) is an implicit function defined by a system of differential equations,
which can lead to difficulties when trying to fit the data. However, we can here use the
implicit solutions for simple SIR models which were deduced recently in [8].

3.4

Choosing suitable EF wavelets

We explain here how to choose good EF wavelets for building an epidemic model.
The first criterion to meet is the start-peak-stop behavior as discussed in Section 2.
Our second criterion is based on the following analysis of the number I(t) of infectious individuals in SIR model:
βIS
dS
= −
dt
N
dI
βIS
=
− γI
dt
N
dR
= γI.

(11)
(12)
(13)

Figure 2: Infectious individuals I(t) for different initial conditions
A closer look at SIR models reveals that the number S(t) of susceptible individuals
is decreasing in time. Therefore the number I(t) of infectious also grows less and the
rate of infectious, i.e., dI/dt, before the peak is always less than the one after the peak.
This is an important criterion when choosing EF wavelets.
Log-normal EF wavelets actually turn out to be very good candidates in this regard:
Indeed, the first good point here is the start-peak-stop behavior, where the start for
a log-normal wavelet is at x = 0 (or near 0), the peak is achieved at x = eb and the
stop depends on the constant c. The second good one is that at the same value of ψ,
the rate of the curve before the peak is less than the one after the peak.
This can be easily seen as follows. The derivative of ψb,c is
0
ψb,c
(x) = ψb,c (x)

−(log x − b)
.
c2 x

(14)

Now suppose that ψ(x1 ) = ψ(x2 ) with x1 < eb < x2 , then | log x1 − b| = | log x2 − b|.
Therefore we have
x2 0
0
0
(x1 )| = |ψb,c
(x2 )| < |ψb,c
(x2 )|
|ψb,c
x1
as required.
These are the main reasons why we first chose log normal functions as basic EF
wavelets for our numerical simulations (see Section 4).
We also remark that in [34] the authors used the log-normal density function, i.e.,
a
fa,b,c (x) = √2πcx
ψb,c (x), to fit the number of daily reported cases. However, since they
used only one single function, and since there are in general many waves of the epidemic,
the data may not be well-fitted enough to produce realistic projections.

Data-driven Numerical Forecasts

In this section, using log-normal EF wavelets we provide numerical results on the fitting
and forecasting of daily new cases of Covid-19 epidemic for some European countries
and US federal states.

4.1

The log-normal wavelet model

Our EF wavelet model for the curve of daily new cases is a finite representation by
log-normal EF wavelest introduced in Section 4.1:
W (t) =

N
X

ai ψbi ,ci (t),

i=1

where ai , bi , ci are parameters, N is the number of log-normal EF wavelets, and t is the
time variable.
We intend to find the parameters ai , bi , ci such that W (t) is close to the daily infected
number RC(t) by a suitable loss function L(·, ·). In other words, we want to find
parameters which minimize L(W, RC).
For our numerical simulations presented in the next section of this work, we shall use
the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm (cf. [30, 37]) for the least squares loss function.
The main advantage of this approach is that the loss function helps us to force the
peaks of EF wavelets close to the peaks of real data.
The number of log-normal wavelets N depends on the data of each population level,
since it presents the numbers sub-epidemic. In our numerical simulations, we first
try with N = 3, 5. It would be interesting to estimate N before fitting the model.
Otherwise, we will need to choose N sufficiently large, and redundant wavelets will
have very small coefficients and, correspondingly, very little effect.

4.2

Data and smoothing

We will be using n the data supplied by the Johns Hopkins University Center [23],
noting, however, that almost all data from countries or US federal states are subject to
(high) noise. One of the main reason for this is the reporting delay (cf. [7, 17]).
As explained in [17], “there will be two main sources of delay in monitoring trends.
First of all, there will be a testing delay between the actual date when an individual
becomes infected and the date when that individual is ultimately tested. Second, unless
test samples are very rapidly processed, there will be a further reporting delay between the
date of testing and the date the test results are communicated by the reporting entity”.
In order to reduce noise, we do smooth out the real data using a (two-sided) moving
average method (cf. [36, Chapter 3], [21], [45]). A moving average is a time series
constructed by taking averages of several sequential values of another time series which
is a type of mathematical convolution. In statistics, two-sided moving averages are used
11

to smooth a time series in order to estimate or highlight the underlying trend. If we
represent the original time series by x1 , ..., xn , then a (simple) two-sided moving average
of the time series will be given by
i+d
X
1
xk .
x̄i =
2d + 1 k=i−d

If the data are showing a periodic fluctuation, moving averages of equal length period
will eliminate the periodic variations (cf. [36, 21]). Observing various population levels
indicates that there is periodic fluctuation of 7 days on the data, and hence we will take
the average of 7 days
i+3

RC(i) =
RC(k).

Projections and validations for the Czech Republic, France,
Germany, and Italy
Projections from 25/10/2020

In Figures 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, the green curve shows the approximate number
of daily confirmed new cases and also a possible scenario with a 60-day projection
for the Czech Republic (or, in short: Czechia), France, Germany, and Italy. Other
curves present log-normal EF wavelets where each one can be seen as a sub-epidemic,
localised both in time and location. These EF wavelets then give us the nowcasting for
the epidemic situation for each population level, i.e., forecasts present sub-epidemics,
recent sub-epidemics and the combination of sub-epidemics.
For validation, we use the metric relative percentage difference:
|yi − ŷi |
,
(15)
erri =
yi
where yi is the real data at day i smoothed by 7-days moving average, ŷi is the prediction
of our model.
We fit our model with the data of daily cases until 19/10 and keep last 6 days (2025/10) for the validation set, then get the average error of 4.17% for Czechia, 7.48% for
Germany and 3.25% for Italy.

However, we get an average error of 32.61% for France (see Figure 6) on the validation set from 20-25/10. We remark here that in some 3 consecutive days the total
cases of France is constant in data Johns Hopkins University [23], and the total cases
are updated by summing up for the day after these 3 days. For example 09-11/10 have
same 732434 total cases, 16-18/10 have same 876342 total cases. This makes the daily
reported cases are zero in some 2 consecutive days. Using moving average of 7 days we
overcome this situation and then use the smoothing data for the projections shown in
Figures 5, 6, 7.

Conclusion and Outlook

(1) The numerical results in the last section of our paper suggest that our models
are actually able to predict many days ahead the number of daily infected Covid-19
individuals in many different countries. In particular, our approach also gives reasonable results for the epidemic situation on population levels by precising sub-epidemics
corresponding to EF wavelets.
(2) For solving the curve-fitting problem in our model selection, we only have to use
relatively few parameters. The model can be seen as a neural network containing only
one hidden layer with a log-normal function activation, entailing that we do not have
to deal with over-fitting problems and that the estimation error of our model is low [47,
p.65].
(3) Our method of modelling of the number of daily reported cases of infectious
individuals does also apply to other epidemics characteristics, e.g., to the number of
active cases - and thus is also important for health care system decisions.
(4) In future work, we will present refinements of our approach as well as refinements
of the curve fitting techniques employed here.
(5) In further future work, we will extend our approach based on epidemic-fitted
wavelet approach to situations where EF wavelets are multivariate functions of time
variables, measurement levels, or other variables such as death rate, recovery rate, etc.
