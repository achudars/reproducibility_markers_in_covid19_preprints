Abstract
We analyze the data about casualties in Italy in the period 01/01/2015 to 30/09/2020 released by the Italian
National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT). The data exhibit a clear sinusoidal behavior, whose fit allows for a
robust subtraction of the baseline trend of casualties in Italy, with a surplus of mortality in correspondence to
the flu epidemics in winter and to the hottest periods in summer. While these peaks are symmetric in shape, the
peak in coincidence with the COVID-19 pandemics is asymmetric and more pronounced. We fit the former with a
Gaussian function and the latter with a Gompertz function, in order to quantify number of casualties, the duration
and the position of all causes of excess deaths. The overall quality of the fit to the data turns out to be very good.
We discuss the trend of casualties in Italy by different classes of ages and for the different genders. We finally
compare the data-subtracted casualties as reported by ISTAT with those reported by the Italian Department for
Civil Protection (DPC) relative to the deaths directly attributed to COVID-19, and we discuss the differences.

Introduction

Last year has seen an enhanced attention of the media concerning the death rates in various countries in the World,
a fact due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemics at the beginning of 2020 and the ensuing alarm it generated
worldwide. An analysis of the historical data archives[1] publicly made available by the Italian Istituto Nazionale
di Statistica (ISTAT)[2] shows a periodic variation of the death rate depending upon seasons, well represented by a
stable and regular sinusoid. Superimposed to the sinusoid trend there may be additional death excesses, most likely
due to seasonal diseases like influenza in winter or to very intense heat waves in the summer [3, 4].
The approach adopted here for such an estimate is an interpolation of the data with a fit function exhibiting an
ad hoc modeling of the main features of the curve. We present results of this method applied to the data provided
by ISTAT in the period 2015–2020. A comparison is then carried out with another data sample[5], provided by
the Dipartimento della Protezione Civile (DPC) [6], which provides counts for deaths attributed to the COVID-19
disease.

The data sample

This study is based on publicly available data provided by ISTAT [1] as time series of recorded deaths by the National
Registry Office. The data, collected from all the 7903 districts located in the 20 Italian regions, covers the period
from January 1st 2015 to September 30th 2020. The data have been collected in histograms where each bin contains
the number of deaths for a single day.

Figure 1: The distribution of deaths collected by ISTAT [1] from 7903 districts in Italy between the years from
January 1st 2015 to September 30th 2020. These data include both sexes and all ages. An annual modulation of the
counts is evident with maxima corresponding to winter seasons and minima to summer.
The data are collected by gender, age and location for each individual death. Figure 1 shows the number of
deaths in all the categories in the considered period. What is already striking by a simple visual inspection of the
distribution is a periodic seasonal variation that behaves approximately like a sinusoidal wave of constant amplitude
on top of an equally constant offset value1 . This feature remains partly confirmed also by disentangling the data
using age as a selection criteria. Fig. 2 shows the distribution of deaths for people in three different age classes: in
blue those below 50 years, in green those in range 50 to 79; in red those above 80 and in magenta the sum of all these
three classes. It is evident from these distributions that people with an age below 50 die, to a good approximation,
with a constant average probability in any given day of the year while those above that age tend to have a varying,
periodic probability of death with a maximum in winter and a minimum in summer. The older the age, the larger the
excess of death in particular periods of the year, appearing in the form of Gaussian-like excesses over the sinusoidal
wave. Disentangling the data by gender, see Fig. 3, there seems to be a slight prevalence of female deaths with
respect to males, except for the COVID-19 peak, where the situation happens to be reversed. These are just raw
values, though, not corrected to take into account the ratio between males and females in the Italian population.
Later on we will quantify and appropriately weight these data.

Methodology of the analysis of the data

We perform a global fit over the data, where in a single step we estimate the sinusoidal baseline of the distribution,
the seasonal excesses and the 2020 peak in correspondence of the COVID-19 pandemic. This method differs from
other methods often reported in literature, where the background is subtracted by computing the average number
of counts in the same period of the past 5 years, as in [8], or by fitting the sinusoid with the data during periods of
time where the excesses are not visible, like in spring or autumn [7, 9].
We used a χ2 fit to interpolate the data with an appropriate function meant to model the data in order to determine
the value of the unknown parameters of the model along with their uncertainties. The actual minimization is carried
out by the MINUIT [10] package.
The overall fit function has been defined as the sum of individual components in the following form:
1 In

the following we will discuss how we established that there is no significant slope of the average value of this wave.

(1)

i=1

where s(t), gi (t) end Ġ(t) are defined and described below.
The s(t) function is meant to model the wave-like variation of deaths with seasons, the gi (t) function describes
the excess peaks visible above the wave and Ġ(t) represents the rightmost excess peak (spring 2020), which, unlike
the others, is asymmetrical. The index i runs from 1 up to k, the number of excess peaks featured by the data
distribution except the last one on the far right.
The general wave-like behavior of the data is modeled by a sinusoidal function of the form:


2πt
+ϕ
(2)
s(t) = c(t) + a sin
T
where t is the day number starting from t0 = 1/1/2015. The parameter c(t) represents the slowly-varying offset
from zero deaths, a the amplitude of the oscillation, T is the period of variation (the time delay between consecutive
maxima) and finally ϕ the phase. We tried to model c(t) allowing for a linear dependence on t, as c(t) = c0 + c1 t,
but the fit determines a slope c1 compatible to zero within uncertainty. We therefore decided to maintain the c term
independent of time in the final fit.
Each individual excess above this s(t) wave can be modeled by a Gaussian distribution of the canonical form:
Ni −(t−µi )2 /2σi2
e
(3)
2πσi
The choice of a Gaussian function here is only justified by being the simplest symmetrical function to describe
these excesses representing, at the same time the distribution of a random variable. Modeling the excess peaks in the
described way has the advantage that the individual gi fit parameters correspond to a Gaussian with the background
contribution already taken into account in the overall fit model. The Ni parameter of each Gaussian, corresponds to
the number of excess deaths with respect to the wave-like background, whose values are also determined optimally
by the fit itself. An advantage of this approach is that in the case of adjacent, overlapping Gaussians (as can be seen
in Fig. 4 in the case of the g6 end g7 peaks but also the g11 and the big peak on the far right of the distribution),
each individual area is computed correctly by taking into account the nearby contributing ones.
While the excess peaks look highly symmetrical around their maximum and can thus be reasonably well modeled
with Gaussians, as described before, the peak of the spring 2020, associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, is clearly
asymmetric. We have tried several possible parametrizations for that distribution, such as bifurcated Gaussians
with a common peak, generalized logistics, or else, to reflect the asymmetry, but in the end we resolved to adopt
the derivative of a Gompertz function[11] simply because it is customarily adopted by epidemiologists to describe
epidemic evolution’s over time and we therefore considered it more suitable to our purpose.
A Gompertz function is parametrized in the following way:
gi (t) = √

G(t) = NG e−b e

Equation 4 represents a cumulative distribution. Since our data represent instead daily counts, we used its

Results

In Figure 4 and Tables 1 to 3 we report the results of a fit to the whole data sample, comprising both genders for all
ages in the six years from 2015 to 2020. The column labeled ‘µi ’, in Table 1, indicates the day when the maximum
of an excess has been reached while those labeled ‘µi ± 2σi ’ indicate, respectively, the day of onset and demise from
the average background, a time interval in which occur 95% of the death cases (expressed with calendar dates). The
column labeled ‘Duration’ is the time difference between onset and demise (namely 4σ, expressed as number days).

bottom shows the pulls (a quantity defined later on in the text) of the fit: their mean value, being compatible with
zero, is a testimony of the appropriate choice of the particular model adopted. Numerical values for the integral of
each individual Gaussian are provided in Table 1.

confirming the significant underestimate of the uncertainties. This deviation from unity, of about 75%, gives an

Table 3: Results of the fit to the whole data set (no filters applied) for the Gompertz derivative function. The
meaning of the columns labeled From, Peak and To is explained in the text.
The width of the Gompertz is computed from the first day in which the integral of the function exceeds 2.5% of
the total to the day in which the integral reaches 97.5% of the total. These two days are reported in Table 3 under
the columns labeled From and To.

Figure 5: Distribution of the pulls (depicted as a time series in the bottom plot of Fig. 4) fitted with a Gaussian
function. The peak of the Gaussian is at µ = −0.01 ± 0.04 (therefore compatible with zero) while the width id given
by σ = 1.75 ± 0.04.
The value of the period T = 364.0 ± 0.4 days of the sinusoidal wave is compatible with a full year cycle within
about three standard deviations. The offset value c = 1678 ± 1.5 can be assumed to represent the average number of
deaths per day (the overall vertical offset of the sinusoid with respect to the zero value). Finally, from the results of
Table 2, it turns out that the peak of the sinusoid (the maximum number of deaths) falls on January 31st of every
year.
These results highlight an interesting feature of the COVID-19 deaths excess. As already noted, almost every
winter there is an excess of deaths with respect to the baseline, with the notable exception of the years 2015–2016
(a period with a particularly balm winter[18], with a relatively small value of 4 455 excess of casualties). The peak
in the spring of 2020, instead, shows characteristics markedly different from the winter excesses of previous year in
terms of amplitude, width and day of the year when the maximum is reached. In the following we will mention the
possible implications of these differences.

Age and gender mortality

We have also disentangled the data by age and gender and fit the distributions in these different categories to obtain
accurate numerical values.

Figure 6: Casualties of people with age in the range 50 ≤ age ≤ 59 with a superimposed fit based on function 6
(blue points) while gray points are the category 0 < age ≤ 49. Numerical results are listed in Table 4 and 5. The
plots at the bottom show the pulls of the two samples.
We start with a cumulative plot for all people aged between 50 (included) and 60 years (excluded) who died
between 2015 and 2020, shown in Fig. 6. This plot shows that the average value of daily deaths for people in this
age range is about 70 casualties/day. In order to get a fit comparable with the one in Fig. 4, we are forced to adopt
a somewhat more stringent fit strategy. The wave parameter corresponding to the phase has been fixed to the value

Table 5: Results of the fit to the whole data set (no filters applied) for the Gompertz derivative function. These
values correspond to the fit depicted in Fig. 6.
The picture shows two categories of age at the same time: those in the range 0 − 49 (in gray) do not show any sign
of seasonal variation around the mean value of ∼ 32/day (they were fit with a simple constant term). A sinusoidal
variation begins to be noticeable only in the range 50 − 59 (blue dots), along with the presence of the corresponding
death excesses indicating a continuous increase in magnitude with age starting around 50. The results are affected
by larger uncertainties with respect to the full sample of Fig. 4, reflecting the smaller size of population in this range.
The excess peaks and the sinusoid amplitude become more evident in a sample of even higher ages, namely
60 ≤ age < 80. The average number of deaths in this category is much larger, due to an enhanced health fragility
for people of progressively higher age, as seen in Fig. 7.

Figure 7: Casualties of people with 60 ≤ age < 80 (with a superimposed fit based on eq.1). Numerical results are
listed in Table 6 and 7
The fit is again pretty similar, in shape but not in amplitude of course, to the full sample shown in Fig. 4. The
pulls feature a mean value compatible with zero also in this case. The fit strategy is the same as the one described
before for Fig. 6. Values obtained in this case are listed in Tables 6 and 7. The average death rate in this category is
∼ 72/day. Increasing the age threshold further up, by collecting deaths of people aged ≥ 80, we get a sample with
very pronounced peaks, see Fig. 8. The average death rate in this last category reaches the high value of ∼ 1070/day.

Another information can be extracted from the data is the relative amount of deaths between genders. Fig 9
show the distribution of males and females (summed over all ages) superimposed with the relative fits. In this case,
since the two samples have a rather large statistical amount, both fits have been performed with all parameters free
to vary. These numbers need to be corrected by the relative number of males and females in the Italian population.
The fraction of males in 2020 was 48.7% while females were 51.3% [12]: we compute a mortality factor (for each
gender) by normalizing the yields to 29 050 096 and 30 591 392 (the respective number of males and females of the
total Italian population by January 1st 2020). The resulting values (multiplied by 100000) are listed in Table 10 under
the columns Mortality. While the absolute number of female deaths is higher than the males one every year, the
opposite seems true for the 2020 peak. After re-weighting this small discrepancy between genders remains basically

Comparison between different data sets

The data set provided by ISTAT [1] and used for the present analysis is not the only one publicly available: another
is provided by the Dipartimento della Protezione Civile (DPC) [5], which provides a somewhat different kind of
information regarding the number of deaths in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the data
record, which begins February 24th 2020, contains the number of daily deaths directly attributed to the current
pandemic.
A plot of the data from these two disparate sources is shown in Fig. 10. The magenta points (and the accompanying
fit result of a Gompertz function in red) correspond to the ISTAT data sample: these data are a subset of those
displayed in Fig. 4, specifically those between the dates of February 24th and September 30th 2020, with the entries
in each bin replaced with the difference between the actual counts and the contribution due to the underlying wave.
This subtraction of the background of the data allows for a direct comparison between the ISTAT and DPC data,
the latter doesn’t requires a subtraction procedure being unaffected by a background.
The DPC sample is shown as blue dots (with the corresponding Gompertz fit superimposed in green). A clear
peak is visible around spring 2020 together with a second one during fall 2020, corresponding, respectively, to the
first and the second wave of the 2020 pandemic. It is worthwhile to note that the DPC data reports the day when
the death was finally registered, unlike the case of the ISTAT data, which records the actual day of death, thus
introducing a potential delay of a few days between the two samples, visible as a translation of the green line with
respect to the red one.

11

The DPC data show a spike corresponding to August 15th , due to the fact that a certain number of deaths were
not correctly reported in the preceding weeks and were recovered assigning that day as the actual death date. In
order to compare the yield returned by the fit to the value provided by the ISTAT data we had to exclude the
contributions from the second pandemic peak: we decided to introduce a cutoff value while computing the sum of
entries of the DPC sample in correspondence to August 16th , a day when the minimum number of casualties was
reached between the two pandemic waves, therefore including also the spike. The cutoff date is shown in Fig. 10 as
a vertical green arrow.
The sum in that period (the blue dots) results to be 35 468.

Figure 10: Comparison between ISTAT and DPC data samples
On the other hand, the yield obtained for the ISTAT sample is the one reported in Table 3, namely 54 387 ± 557,
resulting from the integral of the Gompertz peak (the yields of two peaks at around July and August are therefore
not included). The difference in the number of deaths from these two samples amounts to 18919±557. This strikingly
large difference could be due to several different reasons, such as an excessive pressure on the Italian health system in
the early stages of the pandemic which prevented a certain number of patients with diseases other than COVID-19
to be safely treated in hospitals and emergency rooms. We have no elements in the data that can allow us to discern
the different contributions to this discrepancy.

Additional considerations

The rich data sample provided by ISTAT allows for various additional visualizations. In Fig. 11 we display data for
ages in groups of 4 years to visualize the increase of death probability with age: it becomes more evident what was
already shown in Fig. 2, namely the fact the young people tend to die with a rather flat probability along each year,
while people of a progressively higher age tend to suffer more from illnesses in specific seasonal periods. Each bin in
this plot constitutes the number of deaths in six contiguous days. In Fig.12 we present a scatter plot of death rates
as a function of the day of the year (for the six years from 2015 to 2020) versus the age category. This graphical
representation clearly illustrates the higher probability of death for the age category 70–95 with respect to the others.

Each value in the ISTAT data sample comes with a geographical tagging marker, allowing for a categorization of
the number of deaths in different parts of Italy.
Fig. 13 shows the fits for each of the four zones in Italy, namely North, Center, South and Islands 2 . The fits in
2 The subdivision is arbitrary and we have defined North as the sum of values for the following regions: Piemonte, Valle d’Aosta,
Liguria, Lombardia, Trentino-Alto Adige, Veneto, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Emilia-Romagna. Center comprises Toscana, Umbria, Marche,

corresponding to highest values of deaths incidence.

these plots correspond to minimization procedures with all parameters free.
Table 12 reports the value of the Gaussian and Gompertz integral for these different regions. In order to compare
these values between different zones, in Table 13 we report the same values but normalized to the relative amount
of registered inhabitants [17].
A visual inspection of Fig. 13 shows the magnitude of the peak in the winter/spring of 2020 for the North of Italy
which is not matched by a comparably populated peak for the Center, South and Islands. Table 13 confirms this
impression numerically: while values of each column, for a given row (normalized by population), are comparable
between zones, the value of the Gompertz peak in the North remains much bigger (actually by a factor from 10 to
over 20).

Conclusions

The data provided by ISTAT allow for a detailed quantitative estimate of the number of deaths excesses with respect
to an average baseline. This baseline is represented by a wave-like variation of the number of deaths which turns
out to be almost perfectly in phase with the yearly seasonal cycle. In this paper we present a study of these excesses
evaluated by a statistical interpolation of the data based on a χ2 minimization method using a function which is the
sum of a sinusoidal wave (to represent the repeated, seasonal variation of deaths) a number of Gaussian distributions
to represent the excesses above the sinusoid and, finally, a Gompertz derivative to model the asymmetric peak of
spring 2020. In this study we discussed the methodology adopted for the interpolations and analyze different samples
by disentangling genders, ages and locations. A comparison has also been carried out between the number of deaths
provided by ISTAT from the National Death Registry in the period corresponding to the first wave of the pandemic
and the numbers provided by DPC in the same period for the deaths directly attributed to COVID-19. We found a
rather large discrepancy, amounting to ∼ 19000 deaths over a total of ∼ 54000.
