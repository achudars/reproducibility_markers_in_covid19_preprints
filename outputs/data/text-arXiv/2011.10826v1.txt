Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the social and economic actions of every
individual. As a consequence, it is expected this impact to transpose into the nature and methods
of insuring risky ventures, and thus drastically change the business models of the insurance
industry both on short and long run. Despite the abundance of predictions and potential
implications, the literature lacks investigations which targets the short-run economic impact
of the COVID-19 pandemic on the insurance industry. This paper contributes towards this
literature, by performing a first of a kind analysis based on data of the activities in one developing
country and insurance market – North Macedonia. By utilizing a seasonal autoregressive model
and data on the gross claims paid (GCP) and gross written premiums (GWP) in 11 insurance
classes, we evaluate the overall and class-specific impact of the pandemic on the insurance
activities in the country. We find that, during the first half of 2020, the activity in GCP
and GWP shrank by more than 10% to what was expected. The total loss in the industry
amounted to approximately 8.2 million EUR which was, however, much less than the volume of
reserves that the Insurance Supervision Agency made available as funds for the companies to deal
with the potential crisis. In addition, the pandemic induced changes in the insurance activity
structure - the share of motor vehicles class in the total industry activity fell at the expense
of the property classes. Altogether, our results suggest that the insurance industry in North
Macedonia was well prepared to tackle the consequences of the pandemic crisis. Nevertheless,
the presence of automatic stabilizers had a major influence on weakening the overall impact of
the pandemic.

Introduction

The COVID-19 outbreak led to an unprecedented abrupt economic shock to many developing
countries, among which was the Republic of North Macedonia.
In order to reduce the impact of the disease spread, the government of North Macedonia implemented social distancing restrictions such as closure of schools, airports, borders, restaurants and
shopping malls. In the most severe cases there were even lockdowns – the citizens of certain municipalities were prohibited from leaving their homes. This subsequently led to a major economic
downturn: stock markets plummeted, inter- national trade slowed down, businesses went bankrupt
and people were left unemployed.
The resulting pandemic and the government actions taken in response, notably altered the social
and economic activities undertaken by the population (Stojkoski et al., 2020). There is no doubt
this will lead to a drastic change in the way economies manage and distribute their risks. As such, it
is expected to have a significant impact on the insurance industry, whose goal is to assure people’s
activities by developing and supplying products and services for absorption and transferring of
risks. The impact of the crisis should translate in the structure of insurers’ claims, assets and
business flows.
Even though, many of the pandemic’s consequences will take time to materialize, and the ultimate
effects will depend on the severity of the economic crisis, with preliminary studies suggesting that
the insurance industry has remained strong, with insurers generally maintaining their solvency
position. As elaborated in a report by Insurance-Europe (2020):
“Insurers across Europe have maintained business continuity, including their ability to continue to
serve customers effectively. Since the outset of the pandemic, many insurers have taken a very
broad range of actions to help their clients. On a case-by-case basis, they have offered, where
possible, temporary fee deferrals, fee waivers or even partial refunds of premium payments. Moreover, insurers have launched a broad range of voluntary goodwill actions to support citizens and
businesses...”
The general global losses in the industry are expected to amount to an estimated 84 billion EUR.
Nevertheless, the magnitude of the impact will not be the same in every economy. This is a
result of the large heterogeneity in the impact of the pandemic in the economies, as well as the
differences in the measures introduced by the governments. In addition, it is also because of to the
national features of insurance, that is, the extent to which insurers cover certain losses is dependent
on national regulatory and supervisory regimes, besides being dependent on individual company
circumstances.

Our contribution

Definitely, the impact of the pandemic should be studied from a country-specific perspective. To
the best of our knowledge, such analyses are yet in their infancy, with so far being made only
several contributions, among which (Richter and Wilson, 2020). In this aspect, here we aim to
introduce a coherent statistical procedure of evaluating the short-run impact of the COVID-19
crisis on the activity in the insurance industry, and specifically in the Republic of North Macedonia.
North Macedonia is a small Southeastern European developing economy. Such economies are
characterized with developing insurance industries and unstable and yet upward trending dynamics
of the gross written premiums (GWP) and gross claims paid (GCP) due to the previous lower
development, increased liberalization and competition of the market and the constant restructuring
of the activities within the insurance classes. GWP are the total revenue from a contract expected
to be received by an insurer before deductions for reinsurance or ceding commissions, whereas GCP
are all demands made by the insured, for payment of the benefits provided by the insurance contract
or for coverage of an incurred loss. Hence, by construction, these two observables are enough to
quantify the activity on both the demand and supply side of the insurance industry, i.e., the former
represents the demand side, and the latter, implicitly describes the supply side of the industry.
Our paper answers whether, indeed, GWP and GCP decreased (or increased) more than what was
expected and to what extent. The paper also clarifies the magnitude of the effect – what were the
total losses in the industry? It also addresses the class-specific impact. Precisely, it answers how
the gross insurance premiums and gross claims payments in certain classes decreased more than
others, and how they affected the overall structure of the insurance industry activities.
To answer these questions, one would have to compare the expected number and volume of claims
and premiums to the one realized in the first and second quarter of 2020. While the realized
claims and premiums are easily obtainable from the reports of the national Insurance Supervision
Agency (ISA), calculating the expected amount might represent an exhausting task. In particular,
the expected amount of GWP and GCP is premised on statistical predictions that are made via
distinct mathematical models. The choice of model ultimately determines the computational cost
and the predictive power – models that are more computationally expensive also have greater
predictive power and vice versa.
To obtain reliable and inexpensive predictions for the expected value one usually has to make
a trade-off and chooses the model which has the best cost-benefit characteristics. As an example, here we consider the Seasonal Auto-regressive Integrated Moving Average model (SARIMA).
The advantage of modeling through SARIMA is that it specifies that the output variable depends
linearly on its own previous values and on a stochastic term, thus using the best fit recurrence
relation to predict future values (Makridakis and Hibon, 1997). In addition, it is able to capture the possible seasonal pattern which has been observed in the dynamics of GCP and GWP
(Ulyah, Mardianto et al., 2019).
By utilizing quarterly data, spanning from the second quarter of 2012 up until the last quarter of
2

2019, we fit a separate SARIMA model for the realized gross insurance premiums and claims for
11 insurance classes. We use the results to construct out of sample forecast for the first and second
quarter of 2020 and take the difference of our predictions with the realized values as our measure
for the impact of COVID-19.
By performing an analysis of our predictions with respect to the realized values, we report that the
activity in GCP and GWP decreased by more than 10 percentages during the first half of 2020,
compared to what was expected. These values are much larger when compared with the activity in
the same quarter in the previous year, when the changes were between 0 and 4.5 percentages. In
nominal terms, our predictions suggest the nominal effect of the crisis is around 8.2 million EUR.
In comparison, the total non-life and life GWP activity in the first half of 2020 amounted to 172
million EUR. Therefore, on the first sight it might appear that the pandemic had an enormous
impact on the activity in the insurance industry. Nevertheless, in contrast to the actions taken by
the ISA in order to reduce the impact of the crisis, which were in a value of around 30 million EUR,
it seems that the impact was much smaller than what was initially estimated1 .
Besides the overall impact, the COVID-19 pandemic induced a drastic change in the structure of
GCP. In particular, we provide evidence that during the first two quarters of 2020 the share of the
Property, other and Property, fire and nat. forces classes increased, while at the same time the share
of Motor vehicles (Casco) and MTPL classes decreased. We argue that the changes in the structure
were a consequence of an automatic stabilizer effect in the risky social and economic undertakings
of the population due to the introduced social distancing measures, even though the MTPL is
mandatory and administratively organized. These conclusions, which can not be inferred from a
simple descriptive analysis based solely on comparison with past data, may be more consistent with
the “perceived” economic situation in some countries than otherwise suggested.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we conduct a thorough review of the
literature describing the factors which determine the insurance claims and premiums and discuss
their relation with the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic. Next, in Section 3 we describe in
detail the SARIMA model and the data used to perform the analysis. Section 4 is constituted
of three parts. In the first part we provide a descriptive analysis for the dynamics of the gross
insurance claims and premiums in the Republic of North Macedonia during the pandemic. We
continue by presenting our ARIMA results and quantifying the impact of the COVID-19 crisis. In
the last part of this section, we present the implications created by our results. Finally, in Section 5
we summarize our findings and offer directions for future research.

Literature Review

The primary contribution of this paper is empirical. It provides new information on the dynamics
of the two main insurance activities in North Macedonia following the COVID-19 outbreak. It
also enables identifying the differential impact on insurance classes. As such, it joins the growing
literature on financial markets impact of an epidemic, focusing mainly on the risky undertakings
and the insurance reactions of firms to an epidemic, see for example (Acharya and Steffen, 2020;
McAleer, 2020; Richter and Wilson, 2020). The general consensus of this literature is that epidemics
can obstruct social and economic welfare by changing expectations about how the economy will
function and by deterring investment and tourism. In many situations, the immediate costs of
an epidemic are apparent, while the long-term costs are unclear. In any case, it is apparent that
epidemics are extremely costly. As noted in Bloom, Canning et al. (2004), preventing epidemics
requires overcoming a range of obstacles, as does responding to an epidemic once it begins.
Our contribution also joins the growing literature on how the COVID-19 outbreak specifically contributed to the changes in the activity of the insurance industry Mansour et al. (2020); Babuna et al.
(2020); Acs and Karpman (2020); Richter and Wilson (2020). Various approaches have been implemented to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on the insurance industry. For instance, Mansour et al.
(2020) used the patient perspective to propose improvements in the coverage of the health insurance class. Babuna et al. (2020) conducted interviews with representatives from the insurance
industry in Ghana and found out that there is a trend of decreasing profits but increasing claims.
Richter and Wilson (2020) developed a scenario analysis in which they evaluate and summarize the
lessons learned from the pandemic crisis by baselining actual developments against a reasonable,
pre-COVID-19 scenario. Their results support the hypothesis that financial market developments
dominate claims losses due to the demographics of pandemics and other factors. Nevertheless, this
literature is still in its infancy and, we believe that, our paper can be a stepping stone towards a
more data-driven understanding of the COVID-19 impact on the industry.
From a methodological perspective the paper contributes to the time-series properties of the insurance activities dynamics, Clinebell, Kahl and Stevens (1994); Thomann (2013); Arena (2008);
Ulyah, Mardianto et al. (2019); Kumar et al. (2020); Cummins and Griepentrog (1985); Mohammadi and Rich
(2013); Andrews et al. (2013). This literature suggests that GWP and GCP are usually very complex and exhibits seasonal patterns Pesantez-Narvaez, Guillen and Alcañiz (2019); Choi and Varian
(2009). Moreover, usually such research on GWP and GCP relies on large scale class specific
data, which cannot be integrated together Hong and Martin (2017); Yang, Qian and Zou (2018);
Guelman (2012); Diao and Wang (2019). This paper presents a way to use a reliable existing data
source that is published on a quarterly basis, the ISA activity reports, to study short-run insurance
dynamics. This would allow to easily expand the analysis done here in the future. We also hope
that this work will stimulate similar work in other countries with similar data sources.

Materials and methods
Data

To empirically evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the insurance industry in the
Republic of North Macedonia, we use quarterly data for the gross insurance premiums and claims
per insurance class. We focus on the period from the second quarter of 2012, up until the last
quarter of 2019. This is the optimal period which allows us to utilize the largest amount of data:
including longer periods will result in a smaller longitudinal dataset. During this period, there are a
total of 11 insurance classes for which there is no missing data and are included in our analysis. Ten
of them belong to the non-life insurance type: Accidents; Health; Motor vehicles (casco); Cargo,
Property; fire and nat. forces; Property, other; MTPL (total); General liability; Financial losses
and Tourists assistance; whereas one of them belongs to the life insurance type - the Life assurance.
The life assurance class incorporates insurances with respect to life, death insurance, mixed life
insurance, rent insurance and unit-linked life insurance. From the analysis we exclude the classes
for which there are gaps in the reported data and for which the activity is negligible (i.e. most
of the time there were either no claims paid or written premiums). Overall, these are a total of
11 classes of insurance. In total the excluded classes account for less than 1% in the activity of
GCP and GWP in 2020, and therefore we believe that their exclusion will not significantly impact
the interpretation of our findings. The data for the gross insurance premiums and claims were
collected from ISA’s preliminary reports. Altogether we end up with 33 observations for each class:
31 of which span the estimation period, while the remaining two quarters represent the basis for
quantifying the current impact of the crisis. All data was collected on 28th September 2020 from
https://aso.mk/en/preliminary-data/. The cleared and processed data used in our analysis is
available at github.com/pero-jolak/insurance-activity-mkd.
Table 1 gives the summary statistics for each of the insurance classes. During the studied period
the MTPL class was the one with most gross claims paid followed by the Motor vehicles (casco)
class and the Accident class, whereas the Financial losses class has the lowest number of gross
claims paid. Average gross written premiums is also highest for the MTPL (total) class, followed
by the Property, other class. Cargo and Financial losses are the classes with the smallest average
gross written premiums.
Figure 1 displays the dynamics of the values for the gross claims paid for each class. Every class,
except Health and financial losses exhibits a seasonal pattern, thus suggesting the appropriateness of
using a seasonal model. The Health and financial losses classes, on the other hand have an upward
trend pattern with seasonal adjustments. Hence, under a suitable stationary transformation a
seasonal econometric model can be also implemented to them. Similarly, Figure 2 displays the
dynamics of the values for the gross written premiums for each class. The same dynamical pattern
for each class as in the gross claims values appear again, hence a seasonal model can be also
implemented for this insurance activity. In the figures, the black lines display the dynamics before

2020, whereas the red lines emphasize the volumes in 2020. For each class and type of activity, we
observe that there is a significant drop in the first quarter of 2020, followed by either a stationary
or a slight upward trend. Altogether, this indicates that the COVID-19 pandemic had a negative
impact on the activity in the insurance industry in North Macedonia.

3.2

Econometric model

The simplest, yet effective model for studying seasonal changes is the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model (SARIMA). Under this model, a stationary transformation of the
data under study, let’s name it xi,t , where i is a nomenclature for the insurance classes and t is the
period of observation, is dependent on its past values, there is a seasonal (periodic) effect and it is
determined by the amount of previous shocks in the class2 .
Formally, the mathematical specification of an econometric model described solely by an autoregressive and moving average terms is
xi,t = µ + φ1 xi,t−1 + θ1 ǫi,t−1 + ... + φp yi,t−p + θq ǫi,t−q + ǫi,t ,

(3.1)

where the φî are the parameters of the marginal effect of the t − î-th period on the current value
of the dependent variable, and θî are the respective marginal effects of the previous errors (shocks)
ǫi,t−î . The AR term (p) of these models indicates that the evolving variable of interest is modeled
as a function of its own prior values. In other words, we have a linear regression setting where
the model predicts the next data point by looking at previous data points. The MA (for “moving
average”) term (q) of the model represents the regression error as a linear combination of the lagged
2
In the case of GCPs and GWPs, the suitable stationary transformation is given by the logarithm of the reported
value

error terms. Finally, I or “integrated” refers to the order of differencing that renders the initial
time-series data stationary.
In order to capture the multiplicative effect of seasonal cycles in the data we introduce the SARIMA
model. This model is often represented as SARIMA (p, d, q) × (P, D, Q)s where the lowercase
letters refer to the specification of simple ARIMA model, while the uppercase letters refer to the
specification of the seasonal component. Finally, the subscript s indicates the periodicity of the
seasons (in our case 4, for quarterly data). Generically, the data process is written as:
φp (L)φ̃P (Ls )xi,t = A(t) + θq (L)θ̃Q (Ls )ǫt ,

(3.2)

where φp (L) and φ̃p (Ls ) are respectively, the non-seasonal and seasonal autoregressive lag polynomials, and A(t) is the intercept. Moreover, the Θq (L) and Θ̃Q (Ls ) are respectively, the non-seasonal

and seasonal moving average lag polynomial.
To present the model construction of SARIMA, let us assume that we have selected a SARIMA
(2, 1, 0) × (1, 1, 0)4 model. After a careful manipulation of the non-seasonal and seasonal lag polynomials we arrive at the following model representation:

xi,t = µ + φ1 xi,t−1 + φ2 xi,t−2 + φ̃1 xi,t−4 − φ1 φ̃1 xi,t−5 − φ2 φ̃1 xi,t−6 + ǫt .

(3.3)

Note that the stationary transformation of the variable xi,t represents taking first difference (d = 1)
and then taking the fourth difference (D = 4). The final model effectively represents an ARIMA
model with autoregressive multiplicative effects by taking combinations of the underlying seasonal

8

and non-seasonal parameters.

3.3

Model selection and diagnostics

The optimal fit of a particular SARIMA model can be done easily by performing a numerical
optimization. The choice of the seasonal, autoregressive and moving average parameters, however,
is a far more important task. This is because, in general, it is them which determine the performance
of the model.
A standard way for choosing models is by using an information criterion estimator. A such estimator
evaluates the relationship between the goodness of fit of the model and its complexity in terms of
the number of explanatory variables. Here, we opt to use the Akaike information criterion (AIC),
AIC is founded in information theory, and its inference is done by comparing a given a set of
candidate models for the data. Always, the preferred model is the one with the minimum AIC
value. The inference is done by rewarding goodness of fit, but also including a penalty that is an
increasing function of the number of estimated parameters. The penalty discourages overfitting,
which is desired because increasing the number of parameters in the model almost always improves
the goodness of the fit.
The implementation of AIC allows us to choose a total of 22 distinct SARIMA models, each being
able to adequately predict the future GCP and GWP values of a particular insurance class.
In order to produce consistent predictions, besides providing an adequate fit, the model should also
satisfy two assumptions: i) homoscedasticity and ii) absence of autocorrelation between the residuals. To investigate whether our models satisfy these assumptions we conduct two statistical tests.
For the first test, we estimate the ARCH LM statistic of each model. The ARCH LM test is the
standard approach for detecting whether the model satisfies autoregressive conditional homoscedasticity (Engle, 1982). With the second test, we infer the Ljung-Box statistic (Ljung and Box, 1978).
This statistic shows whether there is any autocorrelation between the residuals of every model. Under the null hypothesis, both tests assume that the assumptions are satisfied, and thus the models
can be used for predictive purposes.

Results
Descriptive analysis

We begin the analysis by performing a simple comparative analysis for the dynamics of GCP and
GWP in the two quarters of 2020. For this purpose, we conduct two distinct evaluations. In
particular, first we investigate the differences between the realized values in the first and second
quarter of 2020 with the with the ones observed in the previous quarter (last quarter of 2019 and
first quarter of 2020, respectively). The quantity which we formally estimate is the single period

9

growth rate of the value of GCP and GWP. Formally, this is given as
ri,t−1 = 100 ×

yi,t − yi,t−1
,
yi,t−1

(4.1)

where yi (t) is the value of either GCP or GWP of class i in time t, measured in thousands of MKD
(61.5 MKD = 1 EUR). This comparison allows us to examine the trend patterns in the time-series
and whether they drastically changed during the pandemic.
Second, we examine the seasonal patterns during 2020 by comparing the realized values in the two
quarters of 2020 with the corresponding quarters of 2019, i.e.,
ri,t−4 = 100 ×

yi,t − yi,t−4
.
yi (t − 4)

(4.2)

Table 2 gives the results for the first quarter of 2020. They reveal that the, for the descriptive
dynamics of GCP, in the first quarter there was a gain of 0.11 percentages compared to the same
value in the same quarter of the previous year (column base p.y.). Out of the classes, the largest
increase was in the Financial losses which exhibited a growth of more than 50000 percentages,
followed by the Property, fire and nat. forces class (92.74%), whereas the GCP in the Cargo class
decreased the most during this period (−94.69%). Interestingly, when compared to the previous
quarter (column p.q.), only the Financial losses category exhibited, growth whereas every other
class had a significant decline in the GCP. The total decline in the activity was −76.35 percentages.
We believe that this is majorly a consequence of the seasonal patterns present in the GCP dynamics.
Identical conclusions hold for the changes in GWP during the first quarter of 2020. Concretely,
the total change in GWP compared to the same values in the first quarter of 2019 is 4.42%.
The Property, other class showed the largest growth during this period (32.51%), followed by the
Financial losses class (23.73%), and the Tourists assistance class was the one with the smallest
growth (−14.76%). Every class showed decline in GWP when compared to the previous quarter.
Table 2 complements the previous table by displaying the changes in the activity in the insurance
industry in the second quarter of 2020. During this quarter there are more drastic changes. In
total, the GCP declined by −6.89% compared to its value in the same quarter in 2019. As in the
results for the first quarter, the Financial losses were the class with the largest increase, and the
Cargo class had the largest decrease. Differently, from the first quarter of 2019, though, in this
case every class exhibited growth in GCP when compared to the previous quarter, and the overall
growth in the value of the GCPs was 90.36%. When examining the descriptive dynamics of GWP
we observe the nearly same behavior – the overall decline in GWPs compared to the same quarter
in the previous year was −2.51 percentages and there was an increase of almost 100 percentages
compared the first quarter of 2020.
While these results offer a simple depiction for the activity in the insurance industry during the
initial COVID-19 pandemic crisis, they fail to highlight the differences between the expected and

realized activity in the insurance industry due to three reasons. In particular, the health crisis
began at the end of the first quarter, thus the total of the crisis in this period can be only partially
evaluate by simply studying the relative changes. Second, even though there is an evident seasonal
pattern in the dynamics of most classes, a large amount of them also display a general trend of
growth in both GCP and GWP, i.e., the observed changes by the descriptive analysis may be simply
a result of this trend. Finally, there is no doubt that the COVID-19 pandemic is reshaping and
redefining the social activities within an economy. In this aspect, it is obvious that an analysis that
does not capture the expected dynamics and is instead strictly rooted in naive predictions will fail
to be useful as a coherent tool for developing economic policies.
In spite of all of its shortcomings and due to their simple interpretation, the findings from the
analysis in this part can be still used as a baseline, though with a dose of caution, for identifying
the implications created by the SARIMA analysis performed in the following part.

4.2

Measuring the COVID-19 pandemic impact

As described in Section 3, we use the SARIMA model to measure the COVID-19 crisis impact on
the activity in the insurance industry. This is done by fitting a separate model to each class and
type of activity, based on the data from the 2nd quarter of 2012 up until the last quarter of 2019.
Appendix A provides tables with detailed information regarding the choice and performance of the
models in fitting our studied data. Each model satisfies the homoscedasticity and no autocorrelation
assumptions.
We utilize the models to predict the activity in the 1st and 2nd quarter of 2020 and use the
expected value of the prediction yip (t) as our assessment for the expected behavior of the activity in
the insurance industry. Subsequently, we use this expected value to estimate the relative percentage
error, defined as
rip (t) = 100 ×

yip (t) − yi (t)
.
yi (t)

(4.3)

This is our measure for the COVID-19 pandemic impact.
Table 4 displays the results for each class divided per quarter and per type of activity. The total
relative error in the GCP activity was 5.29% in the first quarter of 2020 and 11.69%. The positive
sign implies that, in fact, during the first half of 2020 the GCPs decreased more than expected.
The decrease was of similar magnitude in both quarters. Nevertheless, one has to keep in mind
that the COVID-19 pandemic began at the end of the first quarter, and hence, only a part of the
differences should be attributed to it.
In order to investigate the drivers of the differences between the expected and observed GCP
activity we inspect the class specific behavior. In this case, in the first quarter we observe large
disparities in the behavior: there were 4 classes which experienced activity greater than expected

GCP and 7 classes whose GCP activity decreased. Remark that a negative sign in the GCP relative
error implies that the expected GCP were smaller than the realized ones. The class whose expected
activity decreased mostly than expected was Cargo, whereas the Financial losses was the one with
the largest increase in the activity. In the second quarter the same classes show increase in the
activity that is bigger than what was expected, and the Financial losses class was again the one
with the largest increase. In this quarter, it is also the Cargo class which experienced the largest
discrepancies in the GCP activity.
Regarding the GWP activity, the total relative error in the first quarter is 8.12% and in the second
quarter it is 11.32%. In the case of GWP, the positive value of the relative error indicates that
there was less activity than what was expected. The magnitude of the relative error is significant,
therefore suggesting that the COVID-19 pandemic had a large impact on the reduction in the
overall activity of GWP in the economy of North Macedonia.
When we look at the intra-class errors, we find that even much larger discrepancies. Specifically, in
the first quarter it was the Financial losses class whose activity decreased significantly, whereas in
the second quarter it is the Tourists assistance class which decreased mostly. On the other hand,
it was the Property, other class and the Financial losses class whose GWP was much more than
expected in the first, and second quarter respectively.
In Appendix B we show the confidence intervals of our predictions. They appear tight, and thus
we can infer that our results are robust.
To summarize, these findings allow us to conclude that, overall, the COVID-19 pandemic might
have had a serious impact on the activities in the insurance industry in North Macedonia. In
absolute terms, there were 0.8 million EUR less paid in GCP during the first quarter of 2020 and
3.4 million EUR less in the second quarter of 2020. In the same fashion, there were a total of 3.3

13

million EUR less spent in purchases of GWP in the first quarter of 2020, and 9.2 million EUR
less in the second quarter of 2020. Altogether, this implies that the loss in the insurance industry
can be quantified as a total of 8.2 million EUR. In comparison, ISA produced a set of measures in
which it included a release 30 million EUR in liquid assets whose main purpose is to strengthen
the support towards the companies in the segment of managing the negative consequences of the
COVID-19 crisis. On the one hand, might suggest that the potential impact of the crisis was less
than it was actually estimated by ISA. On the other hand, it implies that the insurance industry
in North Macedonia was well prepared for the emergence of a such crisis.

4.3

Implications

While the COVID-19 crisis had a major impact on the overall activity in the insurance industry,
it also induced a significant impact in the class-specific behavior. An exact interpretation of our
results requires a detailed investigation of the structure of GCP and GWP in 2020. As a means to
provide a such analysis, we compare the expected share of each insurance class in the total expected
activity of GCP and GWP with respect to the realized one.
The results are presented in Figure 3 Evidently, there were several major changes in the structure
of the GCP. During the first half of 2020, it was the MTPL and Motor vehicles classes whose share
decreased the most. In particular, we discover that in the first quarter of 2020 the share of the
these two classes in the total GCP was around 2 percentage points less. At the same time, it was
the Life assurance class whose share increased most, by 9 percentage points more than expected in
the first quarter, by 3 percentage points. In the second quarter, we observe an even larger decrease
in the MTPL (total) class in the first quarter (6 percentage points), and a large increase in the
Property, other class (4 percentage points).
In general, it is predicated that the insurance activity in a developing economy, such as the one of
North Macedonia, follows an easily predictable pattern (Arena, 2008). Hence, it seems that during
the 2020 pandemic crisis there was a drastic change in the structure of the GCP. But why was this
the case?
The pandemic forced drastic changes in the social and economic activities of the whole population.
In particular, there were the government imposed social distancing measures such as movement and
travel restrictions, people were instructed to work from home and closure of public places. Moreover,
most people were cautious and further decreased the social activities by self-imposing additional
distancing measures. In this aspect, it is obvious that vehicle insurance is usually purchased for
travels, and this activity was significantly reduced especially during the second quarter of 2020. At
the same time, the social distancing measures increased the risky ventures underdone in the home
of the insured person. Hence, there has been an increase in GCP share of the Property classes.
Similar changes appear in the structure of GWP. That is, we observe extreme increase in the
amount of premiums paid in the Property, other class in the second quarter of 2020, whereas the

14

Figure 3: Expected and realized share of the classes in the total insurance activity .

Health and MTPL classes display a decrease.
As a result, we can conjecture that the magnitude of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was
reduced simply because of automatic stabilizer effects that offset the fluctuations in the insurance
activity through their normal operation without additional timely authorization by the government
or policymakers.

Conclusion

We investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis on the activity in the insurance
industry in North Macedonia. By including quarterly data on gross claims paid and gross written
premiums for 11 classes of insurance, we introduced predictions for the expected behavior of the
activity in GCP and GWP in the absence of the pandemic. We measured the impact of the crisis

15

as the difference between our predictions and the realized values in the first and second quarter of
2020.
Similarly to previous works dealing with the dynamics of the insurance activity within an economy,
we described the dynamics of the activities of each class as a seasonal autoregressive model. This
resulted in a total of 22 SARIMA models, each predicting the gross claims paid of the gross
premiums purchased of a particular class.
Our analysis showed that, the GCP activity decreased by 5.29 percentages in the first quarter and
by 11.69 percentages in the second quarter, compared to what was expected. At the same time, the
GWP activity fell by 8.12% in the first quarter and by 11.32% in the second quarter. In comparison
to the behavior with the same quarter in the previous year, we observed notable differences. This
led us to believe that the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the insurance activity
in North Macedonia. Importantly, we estimated that in nominal value the loss in the 11 studied
insurance classes amounted to approximately 8.2 million EUR. This is less than one third of the
reserves which ISA made available to the insurance companies in order to increase their liquidity
during the crisis. Thus, we argued that the insurance industry was ready to intervene in case of an
even larger crisis.
Next, we investigated the structural changes in the activity of the insurance industry during the
crisis. We found that the pandemic induced drastic changes in the structure of GCPs and GWPs.
In particular, the share of the Property classes in the total activity increased, at the expense of the
shares of the vehicle insurance classes. We argued that this was a result of the automatic stabilizers
inducing changes due to the introduced social distancing measures.
In this aspect, it remains an unresolved question why the automatic stabilizers had a such big
effect on the impact of the crisis. We believe that the answer to this question lies in the insurance
protection gap in the country (Richter and Wilson, 2020). Formally, as defined in Schanz (2018),
the insurance protection gap is the difference between the amount of insurance that is economically
beneficial and the amount of coverage actually purchased. It is believed that in developing and
emerging countries, such as North Macedonia, this gap is largest because combined insurance
premiums still fall significantly short of these countries’ and regions’ share in global GDP. A larger
protection gap makes the structure of the industry more susceptible to shocks in case of extreme
events.
In North Macedonia, the exact magnitude of the protection gap is still unknown. A more detailed
analysis is certainly needed to uncover the effect of the protection gap on the activity in the
insurance industry in North Macedonia, especially in the times of the COVID-19 pandemic and its
aftermath. This, however, requires a highly accurate and disaggregated data for the affordability of
the insurance policies, their quality and the cultural and social character of the insurer behavior. In
regard to this, building an explanatory model for the underlying protection gap would bring novel
insights about the relations between the insurance classes in the GCP and GWP and, importantly,
about the policies required for fast and stable recovery of the insurance industry from the ongoing
16

crisis. This is a subject of our current work and it aims to offer new recommendations for promoting
growth and development of the insurance market.
