Abstract
The pandemic prevalence of COVID-19 has become a very serious global health issue. Scientists
all over the world have been heavily invested in the discovery of a drug to combat SARS-CoV-2.
It has been found that RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase (RdRp) plays a crucial role in SARSCoV-2 replication, and thus could be a potential drug target. Here, comprehensive computational
approaches including drug repurposing and molecular docking were employed to predict an
effective drug candidate targeting RdRp of SARS-CoV-2. This study revealed that Rifabutin,
Rifapentine, Fidaxomicin, 7-methyl-guanosine-5'-triphosphate-5'-guanosine and Ivermectin have
a potential inhibitory interaction with RdRp of SARS-CoV-2, and could be effective drugs for
COVID-19. In addition, virtual screening of the compounds from ZINC database also allowed
the prediction of two compounds (ZINC09128258 and ZINC 09883305) with pharmacophore
features that interact effectively with RdRp of SARS-CoV-2; indicating their potentiality as
effective inhibitors of the enzyme. Furthermore, ADME analysis along with analysis of toxicity
was also investigated to check the pharmacokinetics and drug-likeness properties of the two
compounds. Comparative structural analysis of protein-inhibitor complexes revealed that
positions of the amino acid Y32, K47, Y122, Y129, H133, N138, D140, T141, S709 and N781
are crucial for drug surface hotspot in the RdRp of SARS-CoV-2.

1. Introduction
The pandemic Corona Virus Disease 19 (COVID-19) has become a critical, rapidly emerging
public health issue for the world. It is caused by the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the disease characterized by fever, cough, and severe
shortness of breathing, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea [1]. As of 10 April 2020, SARS-CoV-2
infection has been reported in 184 countries with 1,536, 979 confirmed cases and 93,425 total
deaths [2,3]. Epidemiological data have determined person to person transmission as the route of
the rapid outbreak of COVID-19, which has become a major obstruction in combating the virus
[4,5].Clinical studies reported that older patients have a higher case of fatality rate (CFR) than
the young, and males have a higher CFR than female [6]. Apart from acute respiratory distress,
COVID-19 patients have been diagnosed with higher rate of renal impairment, indicating the
development of kidney dysfunction[7]. Unfortunately, there are no proven drugs, vaccines or
therapies available to fight against COVID -19.
SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus similar to SARS and
MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) coronavirus [8]. Along with structural proteins (like
spike glycoprotein and accessory proteins), the viral genome also encodes non-structural
proteins, including 3-chymotrypsin-like protease, papain-like protease, helicase and RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)[9]. RdRp is an essential enzyme involved in the replication
of RNA viruses including SARS-CoV-2. Several anti-viral drugs have been developed targeting
this enzyme for treating infections like Hepatitis C, Zika and other coronaviruses[10]. Although
not yet extensively explored, some of these drugs also target the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp or its
catalyzed polymerization process[11–14]. A recent study suggested that two known anti-viral
drugs Remdesivir and Favipiravir which are used for the treatment of variety of RNA virus
diseases, by targeting RNA polymerase and RdRp respectively, could successfully inhibit SARSCoV-2 replication in vitro[13–17].Unfortunately, the mechanism of action and the efficacy of
these compounds remain unclear.
Computation biology and molecular docking approach have a wide variety of applications in
drug discovery, giving novel insights to the screening of potential drugs for the treatment of
COVID-19. These approaches also aid the understanding of the protein-ligand interactions as

well as in figuring out drug surface hotspot, which are important for the discovery of an effective
drug[18,19]. In addition, drug repurposing approach is used for the identification of existing
drugs for one disease, for thetreatment of another disease. As the long-term solution, vaccine,
will take years to be marketable, effective repurposing of existing drug remains the only
alternative way to fight against an emerging disease like COVID-19[20–23]. Thus, in the
presented study, drugs with proven anti-viral activity wereanalyzed using molecular docking and
pharmacophore modeling technique to target RdRp of SARS-CoV-2. Our findings can open a
new avenue to fight against COVID-19.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1 Retrieval of the structure of SARS-CoV-2 RNA Polymerase and Drug Candidates List
The RdRp structure of SARS-CoV-2 was retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with PDB
ID: 6M71[24]. Furthermore, 44 drug candidates having inhibitory activity against RNA
polymerase were selected by comprehensive literature study, and their PDB structures were
retrieved from the Drug Bank Database (Supplementary Table 1) [25]. RdRp inhibitor drugs
were prioritized; but drugs that are DNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors having the
antiviral activity were also included.
2.2 Screening of RNA polymerase inhibitors against the RdRp of SARS-CoV-2
The AutoDock Vina software of molecular docking approaches was employed for the screening
of the drugs against RdRp of SARS-CoV-2[26]. At first, the crystal structure of RdRp was
retrieved from the PDB, processed by removing water and complex molecules using
PyMOL[27]. After preparing the PDB structures of the inhibitors, they were exposed to the
RdRp polymerase of SARS-CoV-2 for analyzing the lowest binding energy and interactive
amino acids. The grid box parameters were set to size 80Å x 95Å x 95Å(x, y and z) and centre
121.253Å x 121.376Å x 120.149Å (x, y and z). The 2D ligand-protein interaction diagrams were
generated by LigPlot+ to find out the involved amino acids with their interactive position in the
docked molecule[28]. Discovery Studio and PyMOL were used to visualize and analyze the
ligand molecules’ interactions with the viral proteins[29]. Additionally, the Protein-Ligand
Interaction Profiler (PLIP) was also used to analyze the total number of non-covalent interactions

(hydrogen bonds, water bridges, salt bridges, halogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, πstacking, π-cation interactions and metal complexes) in protein-ligand complexes[30].
2.3 Structural Insights of Drug Surface Hotspot in the RdRp of SARS-CoV-2
LigPlot+, Discovery Studio and PyMOL were used to figure out the drug surface hotspot from
the docked structures of RdRp with the top-most polymerase inhibitors. Remdesivir and
Favipiravir were used as positive control, as they were reported to be effective for COVID-19 by
several recent studies[13,14].
2.4 Pharmacophore Modelling and Virtual Screening of ZINC Database
PharmaGIST was used for the modeling of the pharmacophore features that are essential for the
interaction of RNA polymerase inhibitors with RdRd of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, the topmost inhibitors along with Remdisivir were used for the pharmacophore modeling [31,32].
ZINCPharmer was used to import the generated pharmacophore from PharmaGISTfor the virtual
screening of the novel compounds from the ZINC database [33,34]. These novel compounds
were further used for the screening of new inhibitors of RdRp of SARS-CoV-2. The validity of
the screened compounds was checked by Molecular docking approaches.
2.5 Drug Likeness Properties Analysis of the Screened Compounds from ZINC Database
SwissADME server was used to assess the Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion
(ADME) properties of the compounds screened from ZINC database [35]. This server is well
known for successfully evaluating the pharmacokinetics, drug-likeness and medicinal chemistry
friendliness of potentialdrug candidates. In this study, the physicochemical parameters (Formula
Molecular weight, Molar Refractivity, TPSA), lipophilicity (Log Po/w (iLOGP), Log Po/w
(XLOGP3), Log Po/w (WLOGP), Log Po/w (MLOGP), Log Po/w, (SILICOS-IT), Consensus
Log Po/w), pharmacokinetic parameters (CYP1A2 inhibitor, CYP2C19 inhibitor, CYP2C9
inhibitor, CYP2D6 inhibitor, CYP3A4 inhibitor, Log Kp; skin permeation) and water solubility
(Log S: SILICOS-IT, Solubility) were checked for the screened compounds, also considering all
default parameters[36,37]. Additionally, OSIRIS Property Explorer and admetSAR were used to
investigate the undesired effects of these compounds like mutagenicity, tumerogenecity and

toxicity[38–41]. No ADME or toxicity analysis was required for the top selected drugs since the
drugs were previously tested for FDA approval.

3. RESULTS
3.1 Screening of RdRp inhibitors against the RdRp of SARS-CoV-2
Molecular docking of all the RNA polymerase inhibitors against RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 (PDB
ID: 6M71) revealed Rifabutin, Rifapentine, Fidaxomicin, 7-methyl-guanosine-5'-triphosphate-5'guanosineand Ivermectin chronologically as the top-most effective RdRp inhibitorsof SARSCoV-2 with highest binding affinity and lowest free energy (Table 1 and Fig. 1). Remarkably, all
these top listed inhibitors showed lower binding energy compared to the positive control
Remdesivir and Favipiravir. The whole molecular docking results were included in the
Supplementary Table 2.
3.2 Structural Insights of Drug Surface Hotspot in the RdRp of SARS-CoV-2
The molecular docking pattern and involved amino acid residues with their respective position
were further analyzed to reveal the common interactive sites of RdRp in the SARS-CoV-2. Thus,
the binding pattern of five most effective compounds along with Remdesivir and Favipiravir,
were analyzed to observe the common drug surface hotspot. It was found that the amino acid
Y32, K47, Y129, H133, N138, C139, T141 and S709 in RdRp were involved in the interaction
with Rifabutin. The amino acid position of Y32, K47, Y129, H133 and S709 along with D140
and N781 were also found crucial for the RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 to interact with Rifapentine,
Fidaxomicin, 7-methyl-guanosine-5'-triphosphate-5'-guanosine and Ivermectin (Table 1 and Fig.
2& 3). Most surprisingly, these amino acid residues were also found to be involved in the
interaction of Remdesivir (K47, Y129, A130, H133, F134, D135, N138, C139, T141, S709,
T710, D711, Q773 and N781) and Favipiravir (Y129, H133, S709, K780 and N781).

3.3 Pharmacophore Modeling and Screening of ZINC Database
The top listed RdRp inhibitors along with Remdesivir were further used for the pharmacophore
modeling and screening of ZINC database. The pharmacophore modeling (predicted by the

PharmaGIST) revealed6 spatial features (Aromatic-1, Hydrophobic-1 and Acceptors-4) (Figure
3). This pharmacophore model was imported in the ZINCPharmer for the screening of the ZINC
Database, which revealed four different hits (ZINC09128258, ZINC09883305, ZINC09883308
and ZINC11286235). In addition,molecular docking analysis revealed two compounds
(ZINC09128258 and ZINC09883305) that could also act as the inhibitors of RdRp of SARSCoV-2 as they showed similar binding pattern as the top drugs and controls (Table 2 and Fig. 5
& 6). However, these two compounds showed lower binding affinity than the top selected RdRp
inhibitors. Additionally, higher number of non-covalent interactions was found for
ZINC09883305 (9 non-covalent interactions).
3.4 Drug Likeness Properties Analysis of the Screened Compounds from ZINC 15
Database
The physico-chemistry, pharmacokinetics, medicinal chemistry friendliness and toxicity of these
two screened compounds (ZINC09128258 and ZINC09883305) from ZINC database were
analyzed by SwissADME, ADMETsar and OSIRIS Property Explorer. The physiochemical
parameters, lipophilicity and water solubility of these compounds are described in Table 3.
Water solubility was also studied in this study and found that all the compounds were moderately
soluble. Other important properties such as Molecular weight (MW), molecular refractivity (MR)
and topological polar surface area (TPSA), which are very useful for the estimation of ADME
properties were also included in this study. Remarkably, none of the screened compounds
showed any undesired effects such as mutagenicity, tumorigenicity, irritating and reproductive
effects. However, these compounds showed CYP450 enzymes inhibition effects except
CYP1A2. Lastly, BOILED-Egg model was employed to calculate the Blood-brain barrier (BBB)
permeation that revealed no BBB permeate in the studied compounds[42].

4. Discussion
At present, COVID-19 isa global challenge for the scientific communities as its pandemic
attitude is dangerously affecting millions of people and taking thousands of lives everyday. But
to date, no satisfactory breakthrough has been made in the treatment of Covid-19[43–46].
Several attempts have been made to treat this disease but these drug candidates remain
questionable owing to low efficacy[47]. Computational approaches along with drug repurposing

methods could be an effective approach to this COVID-19 challenge. In this study, several
polymerase inhibitors targeting RdRp of SARS-CoV-19were studied, as RdRp had already
shown to be an effective anti-viral drug target for various viral pathogens such as Hepatitis C
Virus, HIV, Zika virus etc[48,49]. Here, drug repurposing along with molecular docking was
employed for the screening and analysis of the drug candidates against RdRp of SARS-CoV-2.
Moreover, the common drug surface hotspot was studied along with modeling of pharmacophore
which is very important for drug discovery.

Additionally, novel compounds from ZINC

database were screened out which could be developed as a new drug to treat COVID-19.
RdRp plays indispensable roles in the life cycle of RNA viruses. RNA viruses initiate RNA
synthesis by virus polymerase utilizing primer-independent and primer-dependent mechanism.
Moreover, RdRp based RNA synthesis doesn’t occur in the mammalian cells offering an
opportunity to design drugs specifically acting against RNA viruses. Additionally, the protein
structure of RdRp in RNA viruses is found to be remarkably conserved. Various antiviral drugs
have been developed targeting this enzyme for the treatment of infections caused by RNA
viruses and they are working effectively[10,50].Therefore, this present study aimed to identify
potential drugs targeting this enzyme for the treatment of COVID-19.
Molecular docking analysis revealed that Rifabutin, Rifapentine, Fidaxomicin, 7-methylguanosine-5'-triphosphate-5'-guanosine and Ivermectin could be potential RdRp inhibitors of
SARS-CoV-2. Notably, Ivermectin has already been reported as showing inhibitor property in
SARS-CoV-19 replications in vitro[51]. Rifabutin and Rifabutin have also been reported for
their anti-viral activity against HIV and vaccinia virus respectively[52,53]. Moreover, the vast
number of non-covalent interactions between these screened compounds with RdPd suggests that
the protein-inhibitor complexes are very stable. In addition to these drugs, Remdesivir along with
Favipiravir which has already been suggested for the treatment of COVID-19, was also found to
be effective as the inhibitor of RdRp of SARS- CoV-2[14]. Although their binding affinity was
lower than the aforementioned top five drugs, the binding pattern was almost similar to these
drugs.The drug surface hotspot study revealed that the molecular binding sites of all the five
compounds were of a similar pattern that could be the hotspot of drug binding to the RdRp of
SARS-CoV-2. This study suggested that amino acids Y32, K47, Y122, Y129, H133, N138,

D140, T141, S709 and N781 in RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 could make effective interactions with
drugs, though this needs to be validated in wet lab. Additionally, pharmacophore was designed
using the top RdRp inhibitor drugs along with Remdesivir, which was used further for the
screening of ZINC database. Molecular docking analysis revealed that two compounds among
the four hits had interacted effectively with the RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 which is indicativeof their
potential as inhibitors of the enzyme. Although their binding affinity was lower than one control
(Remdesivir), the vast number of interactions would give the complex its stability with this
binding energy. Moreover, ADME and toxicity analysis of these compounds suggested that they
could be used for the development of new drugs to treat COVID-19. However, the study of
cytochromes P450 (CYP) isoforms inhibition concluded that there was a possibility that the
suggested compounds could interact with CYP isoforms.

5. Conclusion
COVID-19 has created a disastrous global crisis affecting thousands of people every day, having
already claimed thousands of lives, and severely hampered the global economy. The present
study aimed to combat this global crisis by suggesting potential drug candidates for the treatment
of COVID-19. Rifabutin, Rifapentine, Fidaxomicin, 7-methyl-guanosine-5'-triphosphate-5'guanosine, Ivermectin and other screened novel compounds made the common drug surface
hotspot in the RdRp of SARS-CoV-2, highly suggesting that they could be effective in the
treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
