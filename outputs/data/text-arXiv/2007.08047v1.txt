Abstract
We propose a Bayesian Heterogeneity Learning approach for Susceptible-InfectedRemoval-Susceptible (SIRS) model that allows underlying clustering patterns for transmission rate, recovery rate, and loss of immunity rate for the latest coronavirus (COVID19) among different regions. Our proposed method provides simultaneously inference
on parameter estimation and clustering information which contains both number of
clusters and cluster configurations. Specifically, our key idea is to formulates the SIRS
model into a hierarchical form and assign the Mixture of Finite mixtures priors for
heterogeneity learning. The properties of the proposed models are examined and a
Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithm is used to sample from the posterior
distribution. Extensive simulation studies are carried out to examine empirical performance of the proposed methods. We further apply the proposed methodology to
analyze the state level COVID-19 data in U.S.

Introduction

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has created a profound public health emergency
around world. It has become an epidemic with more than 5,000,000 confirmed infections
worldwide as on May 21 2020. The spreading speed of COVID-19 which is caused by a new
coronavirus is faster than severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Recently, the risk of COVID-19 has been a significant public-health
concern and people pay more attention on precise and timely estimates and predictions of
COVID-19. The Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model and its variation approaches,
such as Susceptible-Infected-Removal-Susceptible (SIRS) (Kermack and McKendrick, 1932,
1933) and Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removal (SEIR) model (Hethcote, 2000), have been
widely discussed to study the dynamical evolution of an infectious disease in a certain region. There are rich literatures producing early results on COVID-19 based on SIR model
and its variations (Wu et al., 2020; Read et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2020). From statistician’s
perspectives, building a time-varying model under SIR and its variations is also fully discussed for COVID-19 (Chen et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020; Jo et al., 2020). In most existing
literature, people focus more on dynamic regimes of the SIR models for COVID-19. They
lack discussions on heterogeneity pattern of COVID-19 among different regions.
The aim of this paper is to propose a new hierarchical SIRS model for detecting heterogeneity pattern of COVID-19 among different regions under a Bayesian framework. Bayesian
nonparametric methods such as Dirichlet process (DP) offer choices to do simultaneously inference on parameters’ estimation and parameters’ heterogeneity information which contains
the number of clusters and clustering configurations. Compared with existing approaches
such as finite mixtures models, Bayesian nonparametric approach does not need to pre-specify
the number of clusters, which provides probabilistic framework for simultaneous inference
of the number of clusters and the clustering labels. Miller and Harrison (2013) points out
that the estimation of the number of clusters under Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) model
is inconsistent which will produce extremely small clusters. One remedy for over-clustering
2

problem under DPM is mixture of finite mixtures model (MFM) (Miller and Harrison, 2018).
The clustering properties of MFM are fully discussed in Miller and Harrison (2018); Geng
et al. (2019) and it has been widely applied in different areas such as regional economics (Hu
et al., 2020), environmental science (Geng et al., 2019), and social science (Geng et al., 2019).
Thus, the key idea of this paper is to assign MFM priors on different parameters of the SIRS
model to capture the heterogeneity of parameters among different regions. The contribution
of this paper are two-fold. First, we formulate a Bayesian heterogeneity learning model for
SIRS under MFM. To our best knowledge, this is the first time when MFM is applied into
epidemiology models such as SIRS. Our proposed Bayesian approach successfully captures
the heterogeneity of three different parameters under the SIRS model among different regions while also considering uncertainty in estimation of the number of clusters. Several
interesting findings based on our proposed method are discovered for COVID-19 data in US.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the motivating data we analyze.
We discuss our proposed Bayesian hierarchical model for heterogeneity learning under SIRS
model framework in Section 3. The performance of our proposed method is illustrated via
simulation studies in Section 4. Section 5 is devoted to the analysis of state level COVID-19
data in U.S. A brief discussion is presented in Section 6.

Motivating Data

Our motivating data comes from the COVID tracking project https://covidtracking.
com. State Level COVID-19 Data are recorded for the 50 states plus Washington, DC. For
simplicity, we refer to them as “51 states” in the rest of this paper. Up to June 10th, 2020,
United States totally confirmed 2,043,031 cases. 114,533 people died because of COVID-19,
and 607,279 people are recovered from COVID-19. The fatality rate of COVID-19 is 5.6%.
Figure 1 shows state level confirmed numbers, death numbers, incident rate, and mortality
rate. We can see that New York state has the highest confirmed number, death numbers,

Method
SIRS Model

Compartment epidemic models are widely used to study infectious disease which spreads
through human populations across a large region. SIR model (Kermack and McKendrick,
1927) has been universally discussed for analyzing the dynamical evolution of an infectious
disease in a large population. SIR model is extended to SIRS model for imperfect immunity
situation (Kermack and McKendrick, 1932, 1933). For a given time t, a fixed population
can be split into three compartments: S(t), I(t), and R(t), which denotes the number
of susceptibles, the number of infectious, and the number of “recovereds” (which includes
deaths), respectively. The dynamical process of SIRS model can be written as following

4

nonlinear ordinary differential equations of three given compartments
dS
= −βSI/N + φR,
dt
dI
= βSI/N − γI,
dt
dR
= γI − φR,
dt

(1)

where β denotes the average rate of contact per unit time multiplied by the probability of
disease transmission per contact between a susceptible and an infectious subject, γ denotes
the rate of recovery per unit time, which is the rate at which infectious individuals are
removed from being infectious due to recovery (or death), and φ denotes the rate of loss
of immunity of recovered individuals per unit time, which is the rate at which recovered
individuals become susceptible again (Anderson et al., 1992; Zhuang and Cressie, 2014). By
adding the equations in (1), we notice that
dS dI dR
+
+
= 0.
dt
dt
dt
Thus, the model postulates a fixed total population without entry and exits of demographic
type. For example, there are no births or deaths caused by other than the disease we study
in a certain time. The SIRS model assume the sum of all three compartments together is
constant within a short period of time such that

S(t) + I(t) + R(t) = N,

5

(2)

where N is a fixed total population. In cases with discrete time t = 1, . . . , T (in units of
days), we have
S(t + 1) = S(t) − βS(t)I(t)/N + φR(t),
I(t + 1) = I(t) + βS(t)I(t)/N − γI(t),

(3)

R(t + 1) = R(t) + γI(t) − φR(t),
with the same constraints as (2).
Based on the models in (3) and (2) and assmuptions in (Dukic et al., 2012), the data
model of SIRS assumes conditional independent Poisson distributions evolving at discrete
time points. For a given time t = 1, . . . , T , the data models are

ZR (t)|PR (t) ∼ Possion(N × PR (t)),

(4)

ZI (t)|PI (t) ∼ Possion(N × PI (t)),

(5)

and

where ZR (t) and ZI (t) are the observed number of “recovereds” (includes deaths) and infectious individuals at time t, respectively; N is known total number of population and
ZS (t) = N − ZI (t) − ZR (t); PR (t) and PI (t) are underlying true rates of recovered and infectious individuals. Thus, our observed data are {(ZR (t), ZI (t))} : t = 1, 2 . . . , T . Based on
the relationship between the number of “recovereds”, infectious, and suspects, we have

PR (t) + PI (t) + PS (t) = 1,

where PS (t) underlying rate of susceptible individuals.

6

(6)

Similar to (Zhuang and Cressie, 2014), we have following hidden processes:
PR (t + 1) = PR (t) + γPI (t) − φPR (t),
PI (t + 1) = PI (t) + βPS (t)PI (t) − γPI (t),

(7)

PS (t + 1) = PS (t) − βPS (t)PI (t) + φPR (t).
In order to model the hidden uncertainties in SIRS model, we define following transformation of PR (t), PI (t) and PS (t) based on (6)


WS (t) ≡ log

PI (t)

(8)

The time-varying process of WR (t) and WI (t) is defined as
WS (t + 1) = µS (t) + S (t + 1),
(9)
WI (t + 1) = µI (t) + I (t + 1),
where S (t) ∼ N (0, σS2 ) and I (t) ∼ N (0, σI2 ) for t = 1, 2, . . . , T . Based on (6) and (7), we
have
µS (t) =WS (t)

1 + exp(WS (t)) + exp(WI (t))


1
+ log
1 + γ exp(WI (t)) − φ


(11)

Based on the transformation in (8), we have our data in (4) and (5) as

(12)

For the simplicity, we refer the model from (9) to (12) as {(ZR (t), ZI (t), N ), t = 1, 2 . . . , T } ∼
SIRS(β, γ, φ, σS2 , σI2 ). Based on the transmission rate and recover rate, the basic reproduction
number, R0 , can be calculated by

Heterogeneity Learning

In section 2, our motivating data is at state level in US and we are interested in whether
there are heterogeneity patterns on the parameters of interest among different states. As
an assumption, we believe that different states might have different parameters, however,
some states will share similar pattern in transmission rate, recovery rate, or loss of immunity
rate. Next, we introduce nonparametric Bayesian methods for heterogeneity learning of SIRS
parameters over n different regions. In this section, we focus on the the transmission rate β
for different regions. Recovery rate and loss of immunity rate can be parameterized in the
same way.
Let z1 , . . . , zn ∈ {1, . . . , k} denote clustering labels of n regions and β1 , . . . , βn denote the

8

corresponding parameters in SIRS model for n regions. Our goal is to cluster β1 , . . . , βn into
k clusters with distinct values β1∗ , . . . , βk∗ , which is usually unknown in practice. A popular
solution for unknown k is to introduce the Dirichlet process mixture prior models (Antoniak,
1974) as following:

βi ∼ G,

G ∼ DP (αG0 ),

(14)

where G0 is a base measure and α is a concentration parameter. If a set of values of β1 , . . . , βn
are drawn from G, a conditional prior can be obtained by integration (Blackwell et al., 1973):
n

p(βn+1

α
1 X
G0 (βn+1 ).
| β1 , . . . , βn ) =
δβj (βn+1 ) +
n + α j=1
n+α

(15)

Here, δβj (β` ) = I(β` = βj ) is a point mass at βj . We can obtain the following equivalent
models by introducing cluster membership zj ’s and letting the unknown number of clusters
k go to infinity (Neal, 2000).
zi | π ∼ Discrete(π1 , . . . , πk ),
βc∗ ∼ G0

(16)

π ∼ Dirichlet(α/k, . . . , α/k)
where π = (π1 , . . . , πk ). In addition, the distribution of zi can be marginally given by a
stick-breaking representation (Sethuraman, 1994) of Dirichlet process (DP) as

zi ∼

π h δh ,

h=1

π h = νh

Y
(1 − ν` ),
`≤h

νh ∼ Beta(1, α),
where δh is the Dirac function with mass at h.
9

(17)

However, Miller and Harrison (2018) proved that the DP mixture model produces extraneous clusters in the posterior leading to inconsistent estimation of the number of clusters
even when the sample size grows to infinity. A modification of DP mixture model called
Mixture of finite mixtures (MFM) model is proposed to circumvent this issue (Miller and
Harrison, 2018):

k ∼ p(·),

(π1 , . . . , πk ) | k ∼ Dirichlet(η, . . . , η),

zi | k, π ∼

k
X

πh δh ,

i = 1, . . . , n, (18)

h=1

where p(·) is a proper probability mass function (p.m.f.) on {1, 2, . . . , }.
Like the stick-breaking representation in (17) of Dirichlet process, the MFM also has
a similar construction. If we choose k − 1 ∼ Poisson(λ) and η = 1 in (18), the mixture
weights π1 , · · · , πk is constructed as follows:
iid

1. Generate η1 , η2 , · · · ∼ Exp(λ),
2. k = min{j :

i=1

ηi ≥ 1},

3. πi = ηi , for i = 1, · · · , k − 1,
4. πk = 1 −

Pk−1

πi .

For ease of exposition, we refer the stick-breaking representation of MFM above as MFM(λ)
with default choice of p(·) being Poisson(λ) and η = 1.

3.3

Hierarchical Model

In order to allow for simultaneously heterogeneity learning of three parameters in SIRS
model, the MFM prior is introduced for parameters β, γ and φ in the SIRS model. Our
observed data are {(ZR (t, si ), ZI (t, si ), Ni ) : t = 1, 2, . . . , T, i = 1, 2, . . . , n}, where t denotes
each discrete time point and i denotes each state. The hierarchical SIRS model with MFM

10

is given as

2
{(ZR (t, si ), ZI (t, si ), Ni ), t = 1, 2 . . . , T } ∼ SIRS(βzβ , γziγ , φzφ , σS,i

i

ziβ ∼ MFM(λβ ), i = 1, 2, . . . , n,
ziγ ∼ MFM(λγ ), i = 1, 2, . . . , n,

φzφ ∼ Gφ ,

, σI,i
∼ IG(0.01, 0.01), i = 1, 2, . . . , n,

where z β , z γ , and z φ denote the cluster assignments of parameter β,γ, and φ, respectively.
Gβ , Gγ , and Gφ is the base distribution for parameter β,γ, and φ, respectively. The choices
of Gβ , Gγ , and Gφ will be discussed in Section 3.4.

3.4

Prior and Posterior

For the hierarchical SIRS model with MFM introduced in Section 3.3, the set of parameters is
2
2
, λβ , λγ , λφ : i = 1, 2 . . . , n}. To complete the model, we
, σI,i
denoted as Θ = {βzβ , γziγ , φzφ , σS,i
i

i

now specify the joint prior distribution for the parameters. Based on the natural constraints
generated by (3), we have following distribution for bases distribution Gβ , Gγ and Gφ ,
respectively:
βzβ ∼ Uniform(0, 1),
i

γziγ ∼ Uniform(0, 1),
φzφ ∼ Uniform(0, 1).
i

11

(20)

For the hyperparameters for three MFM processes, we assign gamma prior Gamma(1, 1)
on λβ , λγ , λφ . With the joint prior distributions π(Θ), the posterior distribution of these
parameters based on the data D = {(ZR (t, si ), ZI (t, si ), Ni ) : t = 1, 2, . . . , T, i = 1, 2, . . . , n}
is given as

π(Θ|(ZR (t, si ), ZI (t, si ), Ni ) : t = 1, 2, . . . , T, i = 1, 2, . . . , n) ∝ L(D|Θ) × π(Θ),

(21)

where L(D|Θ) is the full data likelihood given from the model (9) to (12). The analytical form
of the posterior distribution of π(Θ|(ZR (t, si ), ZI (t, si ), Ni ) : t = 1, 2, . . . , T, i = 1, 2, . . . , n)
is unavailable. Therefore, we carry out the posterior inference using the MCMC sampling
algorithm to sample from the posterior distribution and then obtain the posterior estimates
of the unknown parameters. Computation is facilitated by the nimble package (de Valpine
et al., 2017) in R which generates C++ code for faster computation.

3.5

Group Inference via MCMC Samples

After obtaining posterior samples, an important task is do inference on posterior samples.
Using posterior mean or posterior median for grouping label z is not suitable. Instead,
inference on the clustering configurations is obtained employing the modal clustering method
of (Dahl, 2006). The inference is based on the membership matrices of posterior samples,
B (1) , . . . , B (M ) , where B (t) for the t-th post-burn-in MCMC iteration is defined as:
(t)

(t)

B (t) = [B (t) (i, j)]i,j∈{1:n} = 1(zi = zj )n×n , t = 1, . . . , M,

(22)

Here 1(·) denotes the indicator function, which means B (t) (i, j) = 1 indicates observations i
and j are in the same cluster in the t-th posterior sample post burn-in. After obtaining the
membership matrices of the posterior samples, a Euclidean mean for membership matrices

12

is calculated by:
M
1 X (t)
B=
B .
M t=1

Based on B and B (1) , . . . , B (M ) , we find the iteration with the least squares distance to B as

CL = argmint∈(1:M )

n X
n
X

{B(i, j)(t) − B(i, j)}2 .

(23)

i=1 j=1

The estimated parameters, together with the cluster assignments z, are then extracted from
the CL -th post burn-in iteration.

Simulation

In this section, we investigate the performance of the hierarchical SIRS model with MFM
from a variety of measures.

4.1

Simulation Settings and Evaluation Metrics

In order to mimic the real dataset we analyze, we choose n = 51 and the population for
each location is assigned as the real data population for 51 states. The time length T equals
30 for all the simulation replicates. The total number of replicates in our simulation study
is 100. For each parameter, we have two different groups and we set the true values of the
parameters β1 = 0.06, β2 = 0.6, φ1 = 0.06, φ2 = 0.6,, and γ1 = 0.06, γ2 = 0.6. We randomly
assign the labels to 51 locations and fix them over 100 replicates. The grouping labels for
three parameters is given in Figure 2.
For each replicates, we have 15, 000 iterations MCMC samples and have first 5, 000 iterations burn-in in order to obtain samples from every 5th iteration of the last 10, 000 iterations.
The performance of the posterior estimates of parameters were evaluated by the mean
bias (MB) and the mean standard deviation (MSD) in the following ways, take β as an

(Vavrek, 2011). A higher value of the RI represents higher accuracy of clustering The average
RI (MRI) was calculated as the mean of RIs over the 100 replicates.

From the results shown in Table 1, we see that the MABs and MSDs of the parameters
are both within a reasonable range. In general, performance of posterior estimates achieve
a good target.
And we see that our proposed methods successfully recover the number of groups and
grouping labels within a reasonable range for all three parameters from Table 2. Average
rand index for all parameters around 0.85 indicate our proposed method truly recovers the
group labels for all three parameters. The mean of the estimated number of groups is close
to true number of groups over 100 replicates.

Real Data Analysis
30-Day Analysis from April 1st

We analyze 30-Day data from April 1st, 2020. The reason why we analyze this time period data is that U.S. Government announced the suspension of entry as immigrants and
nonimmigrants of certain additional persons who pose a risk of transmitting corona-virus
https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/ on March 11th, 2020. From the
15

April 1st, we can assume that there are very limited imported cases from outside U.S.. We
analyze 30-day data based on the model in (19) and use the priors discussed in Section 3.4.
We run 50, 000 MCMC iterations and burnin the first 20, 000 iterations in order to obtain
samples from every 10th iteration of the last 30, 000 iterations. The group labels are obtained
by Dalh’s method in Section 3.5.
For β, one group is identified. β = 0.079 with 95% Highest Probability Density (HPD)
interval (Chen and Shao, 1999) (0.058, 0.098). For γ, three groups are identified with γ1 =
0.0054 with HPD interval (0.0021, 0.0207), γ2 = 0.0419 with HPD interval (0.0022, 0.0609)
and γ3 = 0.0164 with HPD interval(0.0035, 0.0241). Thirty three states including Alabama,
Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho,
Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,
South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin,
belong to group one. Eleven states including Arkansas, Hawaii, Iowa, Maine, Minnesota,
New Hampshire, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Wyoming , belong to
group 2. And seven states including Alaska, Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, Montana, New
Mexico, New York, belong to group 3. The grouping labels for γs are shown in Figure 3.
For φ, one group is identified. φ = 0.0015 with HPD interval (1.181 × 10−7 , 0.0047).
With the estimated values of β and γ, the basic reproduction number, R0 , is calculated
among different states. The values of R0 among different states are shown in Figure 4.

30-Day Analysis from May 1st

The second time period we analyze is from May 1st, 2020. Other settings are same with
previous analysis.
For β, one group is identified. β = 0.0042 with 95% Highest Probability Density (HPD)
interval (Chen and Shao, 1999) (3.056 × 10−8 , 0.1083). Compared with previous 30-day data,
in this time period, the transmission rate decrese a lot. For γ, two groups are identified

with γ1 = 0.0381 with HPD interval (0.0048, 0.3713) and γ2 = 0.0007 with HPD interval
(0.0003, 0.0013). Two states, Oregon and Vermont, are identified in group 1. Other states
are identified in group 2. For φ, one groups is identified. φ = 0.0006 with HPD interval
(2.747 × 10−7 , 0.0026).
With the estimated values of β and γ, the basic reproduction number, R0 , is calculated
among different states. There are two different groups for the basic reproduction number.
One group include Oregon and Vermont with R0 = 0.1102. The other group includes other
49 states with R0 = 5.4619. Comparing to the 30 days period from April 1st, we can see a
decrease for R0 in general.

Discussion

In this paper, we develop a nonparametric Bayesian heterogeneity learning method for SIRS
model based on Mixture of Finite Mixtures model. This statistical framework was motivated
by the heterogeneity of COVID-19 pattern among different regions. Our simulation results
indicate that the proposed method can recover the heterogeneity pattern of parameters
among different regions. Illustrated by the analysis of COVID-19 data in U.S., our proposed
methods reveal the heterogeneity pattern among different states.
In addition, three topics beyond the scope of this paper are worth further investigation.
First, we can add spatially dependent structure (Hu et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2020) on the
heterogeneity of different states. Second, our model assumes parameters are constant over
a certain time period. Building heterogeneity learning model with time varying coefficients
is an interesting future work. Finally, proposing a measurement error correction for SIRS
devotes another interesting future work.
