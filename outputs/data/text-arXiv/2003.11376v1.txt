ABSTRACT: We report a statistical analysis of some highly infected countries by the novel
coronavirus (COVID-19). The cumulative infected data were fitted with various growth
models (e.g. Logistic equation, Weibull equation and Hill equation) and obtained the power
index of top ten highly infected countries. The newly infected data were fitted with Gaussian
distribution with the peak at ~40 days for the countries whose infection curves are seem to be
saturated. The similarity in growth kinetics of infected people of different countries provides
first-hand guidelines to take proper precautions to minimize human damage.

China and Republic of Korea (see Fig.
3(a,b)), whereas it is still not controlled in
most countries, despite their attempts in
various modes. There are attempts to
understand the behaviour of the epidemic in
different mathematical formalism, they lack
many details in some factors or are
restricted to a particular locality [14-24].

1. Introduction
The outbreak of coronavirus (COVID19) from Wuhan, China, that causes severe
respiratory tract infections in humans has
become a global health concern [1,2].
Although the major mode of transmission
via respiratory droplets, contaminated hands,
surfaces have been found out [3-8], the
other modes can‚Äôt be neglected [9]. The
factors like low air temperature and low
humidity highly influence the transmission
of COVID-19 [10,11]. The population
density, qualitative medical care, etc. also
affect the control of COVID-19 [12,13]. The
outcome of all the factors and modes of
transmission lead to the infection in human
with suffering in pain and to the death in
one hand. On the other hand, although there
is no direct vaccine available to cure it,
alternative medicines are used to treat the
patients to recover [1,2].

Based on the WHO data (till date), we
investigate the behaviour of COVID-19
spread for various countries to take
precautions. This can provide first-hand
guidelines for strategically controlling the
epidemic.
2. Methods
2.1 Data
We have taken the data from World
Health Organization website (WHO) for all
the COVID-19 infected countries [1],
although individual affected countries have
their individual database. However, we

epidemic is under mostly control only in

from

‚ÄúWHO‚Äù

for

Further, the infection curves are fitted
with the Hill equation, i.e. ùëå =
, where
‚ÄòY‚Äô is the cumulative data of infection, ‚ÄòT‚Äô is
the time, m is the power index, ‚ÄòA‚Äô and ‚ÄòK‚Äô
are the constants. It is observed that the data
is saturated for the two countries i.e. China
and Republic of Korea (Fig. 3 (a, b)). This
may be due to various factors developed in
the later stage like good medical facilities
with medications and awareness. It is
revealed that for China and Korea the
saturation is observed with less newly
affected persons. But for other countries the
infection trend is increasing. Also it is
revealed that the nature of increase trend is
similar
in
nature.
Although
little
discrepancies are observed among various
countries, it can be attributed to the local
natural factors like temperature, humidity
and human factors like GDP, population
density etc. )

2.2 Statistical analysis
The cumulative infected data were
analyzed based on various growth models
(e.g. Logistic equation, Weibull equation
and Hill equation) to obtain the power index.
The newly infected data were fitted with
Gaussian distribution function.

top ten highly infected countries.
3. Results
The COVID-19 is spreading rapidly all
over the world and WHO declared it as
‚Äúpublic health emergency of international
concern (PHEIC)‚Äù. Globally there are
292142 confirmed cases and death is 12784
till the date March 21, 2020 [1]. The
cumulative data of top ten highly infected
countries data are shown in Fig. 1. The
flatness of the top data of any country
represents the saturation of new infection
(e.g. China). The other behavior represents
the increase in the number of infected
people with time. Initially the infection rate
may be low but increases as time progress
and reach to a saturation value. For the
comparison of infection rate, normalized
curves are plotted for these countries (see
Fig. 2).

Fig. 2. Normalized cumulative data of top
ten highly infected countries.
We have also fitted the cumulative
infection curve with Logistic and Weibull
equations to compare the results with Hill
equation and calculated the power index (m)
which gives the information about the
infection rate. We observed that the values
are very close to each other for all the
models (see Fig. 4). The power index value
ranges between 3.75 - 32.23 for the top ten
highly infected countries. As the cumulative
infection curve of China and Republic of
2

Korea are almost saturated, one can
compare the exponent value of these two
countries. The exponent is low (3.75) for
China whereas for the Republic of Korea it
is 12.01. The small exponent indicates the
low infection rate i.e. the infection rate of
China is relatively small as compared to
Republic of Korea. For other countries the
cumulative data is not reached to the
saturation value, so the interpretation of the
power index may be unrealistic. For
example, in the case of the USA the
exponent is quite high because there is a
sharp increase of infection at this stage but it
may slow down due to prevention and
medical facility as time progresses.

of the countries.

model for top ten highly infected countries.
For better understanding, we have also
analyzed the daily infection and that is fitted
with a Gaussian distribution. While the data
from China and Korea are well fit (see Fig.
6 (a,b)), the data from Iran and Switzerland
show the change in trend (may be achieving
its peak) (Fig. 6 (c,d)). But the data from the
countries like Italy and USA shows the
increasing in trend (Fig. 6 (e, f)). The
average mean are ~35 and ~40 days for
China and Republic of Korea respectively.
Although many factors (temperature,
humidity, GDP, medical facilities, etc.) in
other countries are different than that of
China and Republic of Korea, they are
trying best to control it. Irrespective of that
the rate of infection is increasing till now.
The rest of the countries data are shown in
the Supporting Information.

Due to different transmission mode of
COVID-19 spreading, many people are
getting infected on daily basis although
there are different precautions are available.
The daily infected people of top ten
countries are shown in Fig. 5. The mean of
newly infected people is quite high for most

infected people is well fitted with Gaussian

the statistical analysis will provides firsthand guidelines to take proper precautions

The global infected data of COVID-19
shows a power law behavior with exponent
1.7 (see Fig. 7). Although the spreading of
coronavirus is different in the respective
countries, they show a scale invariance

Conclusion
The present work discussed the
statistical analysis of COVID-19 infection
data. The cumulative infection of top ten
highly infected countries data are fitted with
different equations and the power index are
estimated. There is a similarity in the
growth kinetics of infected people although
the rate of infections is different due to
various reasons. The infection curve of
China and Republic of Korea has almost
reached to its saturation value because of
various reasons, for example medical
