ABSTRACT
Spatial information on cropland distribution, often called cropland
or crop maps, are critical inputs for a wide range of agriculture
and food security analyses and decisions. However, high-resolution
cropland maps are not readily available for most countries, especially in regions dominated by smallholder farming (e.g., subSaharan Africa). These maps are especially critical in times of crisis
when decision makers need to rapidly design and enact agriculturerelated policies and mitigation strategies, including providing humanitarian assistance, dispersing targeted aid, or boosting productivity for farmers. A major challenge for developing crop maps
is that many regions do not have readily accessible ground truth
data on croplands necessary for training and validating predictive
models, and field campaigns are not feasible for collecting labels for
rapid response. We present a method for rapid mapping of croplands
in regions where little to no ground data is available. We present results for this method in Togo, where we delivered a high-resolution
(10 m) cropland map in under 10 days to facilitate rapid response to
the COVID-19 pandemic by the Togolese government. This demonstrated a successful transition of machine learning applications
research to operational rapid response in a real humanitarian crisis.
All maps, data, and code are publicly available to enable future
research and operational systems in data-sparse regions.

INTRODUCTION

Satellite Earth observation (EO) data can provide critical, relevant,
and timely information in support of agricultural monitoring and
food security [2, 15]. EO can enable crop yield assessment and forecasting [3, 7, 8, 13, 21], inform agricultural commodities markets,
enable early warning and mitigation of impending crop shortages,
and inform decisions about subsidies in times of crisis such as extreme drought [6] or outbreaks of disease or pests. However, the
lack of up-to-date, high-resolution cropland and crop type maps
is a critical barrier to agricultural and food security assessments
and operational rapid response to humanitarian crises. These data
are especially lacking in regions dominated by smallholder agriculture that are most vulnerable to food insecurity (e.g., sub-saharan
Africa).
Machine learning techniques have commonly been used to identify cropland in EO data. The majority of studies use tree-based
classifiers (primarily random forests or decision trees) or neural network/deep learning methods (primarily recurrent or convolutional
neural networks). However, prior methods have typically been
applied to small and/or spatially homogeneous areas [14, 16, 27],
require large training datasets (hundreds of thousands of labels)
[20, 22, 23, 32], or use EO inputs with insufficient spatial resolution
for reliably detecting smallholder farms which often have field sizes
<1 ha [4, 17, 24, 30, 31, 33]. In many regions, particularly developing countries and regions dominated by smallholder farming, the
lack of readily accessible ground truth data is a major barrier for
training and validating machine learning techniques for cropland
classification [5].
In this paper, we demonstrate a novel method for rapidly generating cropland maps for areas with little to no available labeled
data over a large heterogeneous area. This is achieved by leveraging global and local datasets. The global dataset contains tens of
thousands of crowdsourced labels from diverse geographies [26]
to learn general features for identifying cropland globally. These
global examples supplement a much smaller dataset of curated,

2 METHODS
2.1 Labeled Data
2.1.1 Crowdsourced Labels. We leveraged a large (35,866 labels)
crowd-sourced dataset with labels of “crop” or “non-crop” from
diverse, globally-distributed locations [26] to help the model learn
features that are useful for detecting a wide range of cropland
globally. Details about sample selection, labeling procedures, and
quality assessment/control measures can be found in Bayas et al. [1].
Each location was labelled by multiple labelers; to turn these labels
into binary labels, we took the mean of the labels for each location,
with a threshold of 0.5 to define a point as “crop” or “non-crop.”

local examples (manually labeled using photointerpretation of highresolution satellite imagery) to learn features specific to cropland
in the target mapping region. Combined, these datasets provide
sufficient examples to train a Long Short Term Memory network
(LSTM) [11] to predict the presence of cropland in each pixel given
a monthly time-series of Sentinel-2 multispectral observations.
The COVID-19 global pandemic has severely impacted the global
food system, and the threat of food shortages and rising food prices
has required countries at risk of food insecurity to rapidly design
and enact aid programs in response. In the West African country
of Togo, the government announced a program to boost national
food production in response to the COVID-19 crisis by distributing
aid to farmers, but found that high-resolution spatial information
about the distribution of farms across Togo (which primarily consist
of smallholder farms under 1 ha) was a critical piece of missing
information for designing this program. Using our method, we
were able to generate an accurate high-resolution (10 m) map of
cropland in Togo for 2019 in under 10 days to respond to the Togolese government’s immediate need for information about the
distribution of farms across the country. We showed that our model
outperforms existing publicly-available cropland maps for Togo
[4, 33] while also being higher resolution and more recent. We
have delivered this product to the Togolese government where it
is being used to help inform decision-making in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic, thus demonstrating a successful transition
of machine learning research to operational rapid response for a
real humanitarian crisis. We have made our map as well as all data
and code used in this study publicly available to facilitate future
research and operational systems in data-sparse regions.

2.1.2 Active Labeling. To generate training labels, experts in photointerpretation of agricultural land cover (authors Becker-Reshef,
Barker, Hosseini, Kerner, Munshell, and Paliyam) drew polygons
over pixels with labels of “crop” or “non-crop.” We used a combination of basemaps for photointerpretation: a SkySat 72cm composite
of January-March 2019 [29], PlanetScope composites of April-July
and July-October 2019 [29], and Google Earth Pro basemaps (comprised primarily of high-resolution Maxar images). We used QGIS
and Google Earth Pro to draw polygons over basemaps. The locations of labels were chosen to be distributed across different agroecological zones and non-crop land cover types observed across
Togo. The central pixel within each polygon was used for training.
We obtained 394 crop and 194 non-crop labels for the initial training dataset to supplement the 43 examples within Togo in the See
[26] dataset (631 examples total). After training the model with the
hand-labeled and See [26] dataset, we collected additional labeled
examples (294 crop and 394 non-crop) by analyzing the predicted
map and identifying areas of model confusion (e.g., transient vegetation on shorelines that the model might confuse with crops). This
allowed us to maximize the utility of each training example, as it
focused on places where the model was weakest rather than adding
redundancy to the dataset. This resulted in a final training dataset
of 1,319 hand-labeled examples, visualized spatially in Figure 1a.

2.2

EO Data

We used Copernicus Sentinel-2 surface reflectance (Level 2A) observations that corresponded to label locations as input to the model.
We exported 160 m × 160 m patches for each labeled pixel using
Google Earth Engine (GEE) [9], then extracted the closest pixel
within the patch to the label location. To construct a cloud-free
timeseries representation of each pixel, we used the algorithm from
Schmitt et al. [25], which finds the least cloudy pixel within a defined time period. We used 12 30-day time periods to construct a
monthly timeseries spanning 360 days for each labeled pixel. We
used all spectral bands except for B1 (coastal aerosol) and B10 (cirrus SWIR), and added the normalized difference vegetation index
(NDVI), computed as NDVI = B08−B04
B08+B04 . All bands (which range
from 10 to 60m resolution) were upsampled to 10 m during GEE
export. We used observations acquired between March of Year N
and March of Year N+1 where N is the year the labels were created
for. Thus for See [26], we used observations acquired March 2017March 2018 and for our hand-labeled dataset we used observations
acquired March 2019-March 2020.

Model

We trained a one layer multi-headed LSTM model (Figure 2) to
predict whether a pixel contained cropland (1) or not (0). The input
was expressed as a timeseries X = {x 1 , x 2 , ...x 12 }, where each
timestep x i ∈ R1×14 consisted of the least-cloudy composite over a
30-day period of 11 optical bands (all bands except B01 and B10)
plus NDVI. The LSTM hidden layer had 64 units. A classifier and
a sigmoid activation were used on the final hidden output to map
the hidden layer output (logits) to a value that can be interpreted
as the posterior probability of crop presence in the pixel.
We performed a grid search that optimized AUC ROC on the
validation set to choose values for two hyperparameters: number of
linear layers in the classifier (1 or 2) and whether or not a dropout
of 0.2 should be applied between each timestep in the LSTM.
To allow the model to focus on examples within Togo while also
learning from the global See [26] dataset, we employed a multiheaded LSTM model, where one classifier was used for all examples
within Togo (local instances) and another was used for all other
examples (global instances). All instances were shuffled during
training: a batch could therefore contain a combination of global
and local data instances. To combine the results from both classifiers,
we used the following loss function to train the model:
W
L=
L
+ Llocal
(1)
α global
Where Lglobal and Llocal are the binary cross-entropy losses for the
global and local data instances respectively, and α is a weighting
parameter. W is a batch-specific value, used to weight the ratio of
global and local instances in a batch:
Number of global instances in batch
(2)
Number of local instances in batch
In our experiments, we used α = 10. We used the Adam optimizer
with default parameters to tune weights during training [12]. To
determine when to stop training, we used early stopping with a
patience of 10 using a validation set consisting of 20% of the combined See [26] and hand-labeled Togo datasets. We implemented
the model and experiments using PyTorch [18] in python. All code

RESULTS

We selected points for a test dataset by randomly sampling 350
points within the Togo country boundaries, constrained by a minimum distance of 50 m between samples (Figure 1b). Four experts
(authors Barker, Kerner, Munshell, and Nakalembe) labeled each
example. Labels were determined by majority vote in order to mitigate label noise in the absence of groundtruth validation, and ties
were discarded. The consensus test dataset contained 106 crop and
200 non-crop examples (306 total test examples).
We compared two experimental setups to evaluate the contribution of the See [26] dataset:
• A single-headed LSTM trained on only the hand-labeled
Togo data
• A multi-headed LSTM trained on both the hand-labeled Togo
and See [26] data
In both cases, we used a model with hyperparameters determined
by the grid search described in 2.3. For the single headed model,
this consisted of a single classification layer in the classifier without
dropout in the LSTM. For the multi-headed model, this consisted of
two classification layers in the classifier with dropout in the LSTM.
We compared our results to two publicly-available cropland
maps of Togo. One map is Global Food Security-support Analysis
Data (GFSAD) cropland extent map of Africa [33]. This map has 30
m resolution and was produced using two pixel-based supervised
classifiers, a Random Forest and a Support Vector Machine (SVM),
and one object-based classifier, a Recursive Hierarchical Image
Segmentation classifier. The GFSAD map does not provide cropland

probabilities, but a discrete class assigned to each pixel of 0 (water),
1 (non-cropland), or 2 (cropland). The most recent GFSAD product is
from 2015. Prior to our map, the GFSAD map is to our knowledge the
highest resolution cropland map publicly available for Togo. Figure
3 (right) shows the GFSAD land cover map for Togo. The second
map we compared our results to is the Copernicus Land Cover
cropland map [4]. The Copernicus map specifies the fraction of each
pixel covered by crops (using values 0-100) at 100 m resolution and
was produced using a combination of random forests and expert
rules with satellite data inputs from the PROBA-V sensor. The
most recent Copernicus map is for 2018. To enable quantitative

comparison with our results, we treated crop fraction as analogous
to crop probability and computed all performance metrics using our
test dataset (Table 1); however, we emphasize that this may not be
how the map was intended to be used and qualitative comparisons
may be more faithful to the intended use of the Buchhorn et al. [4]
map. Figure 3 (center) shows the Copernicus crop fraction map for
Togo. A direct comparison between our method and Xiong et al. [33]
and Buchhorn et al. [4] would require running all three methods
on the same data (i.e., 10m Sentinel-2 observations paired with our
labeled examples). Since neither the code for these methods nor
sufficient information for reproducing them faithfully are available,

Rapid Response Crop Maps in Data Sparse Regions

we additionally performed two baseline comparisons to Random
Forest and SVM classifiers which are the basis for the Xiong et al.
[33] and Buchhorn et al. [4] methods. For the Random Forest, we
used 100 estimators with no maximum depth (nodes were expanded
until all leaves were pure, or until the leaves contained fewer than
2 samples). For the SVM, we used a radial basis function kernel. We
implemented both methods using Scikit-learn in python [19].
To assess performance, we computed the area under the receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC score), accuracy (0.5
threshold on posterior probabilities), precision (user’s accuracy),
recall (producer’s accuracy), and F1-score (harmonic mean between
precision and recall). We did not compute AUC for GFSAD, which
only provides the discrete predicted class. The results are reported
in Table 1. Figure 3 (left) shows our predicted cropland map.
To qualitatively compare our method compared with Xiong et al.
[33] and Buchhorn et al. [4], we show each map compared to the
SkySat 72cm basemap (true color) for several example locations
in Figure 4. Each region in Figure 4 contains primarily cropland,
though the level of vegetation in non-crop areas varies in each
image since Togo’s climate ranges from dry savanna in the north
to tropical in the south. While all maps detect most fields in the
second row, the Xiong et al. [33] and Buchhorn et al. [4] maps failed
to detect most of the fields in the first and third rows.
Our resulting map of cropland probabilities at 10 m resolution
as well as all hand-labeled training and testing labels are publicly
available at: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3836629.

of EO data used to produce the map and the growth in cropland
area that has likely occurred since the map was produced in 2015.
Similarly, the lower performance of the Xiong et al. [33] could also,
in part, be due to lower spatial resolution of input data (30 m) and
changes in cropland area that might have occurred between 2018
(when the most recent Xiong et al. [33] map was produced) and
2019.

DISCUSSION

The multi-headed model trained on the combined hand-labeled
and See [26] dataset had the highest score for most performance
metrics. While AUC score is a measure of model performance across
a range of possible thresholds on posterior probability, the decision
boundary when using the sigmoid function as the output activation
layer is 0.5. While in practice a different threshold could be chosen,
it is not clear how to construct a large and diverse enough validation
set that could be used to reliably select an alternate threshold over
very large, heterogeneous regions (e.g., the country of Togo). Thus,
the improved accuracy and precision of the multi-headed model
(using a threshold of 0.5) - in addition to its improved AUC score
- made it preferable. Additionally, since the multi-headed model
included training data from prior years (2017) and global instances
of cropland [26], we expect that this model would generalize better
to potential domain shift in future years than the single-headed
model trained with only one year of local data. Figure 4 shows
that the multi-headed LSTM and single-headed LSTM have similar
patterns of detection, but overall the multi-headed LSTM has less
extreme probabilities (values closer to 0.5 than 0 or 1). This suggests
that the global examples used to train the multi-headed LSTM act
like a regularizer for the classifier by moderating the confidence of
predictions and preventing overfitting.
We found that the Buchhorn et al. [4] map had the lowest performance for the test dataset, with an F1 score significantly lower than
other methods, though we note that these results could underestimate the performance because the map reports the fraction of each
pixel covered by crops, not probability, in each pixel. This lower
performance may, in part, be due to the coarse spatial resolution

Sensitivity to number of local examples

To assess the sensitivity of the model to the frequency and number
of local (Togo) examples in the training dataset and provide a guide
for future labeling campaigns, we measured the performance of the
multi-headed model on the test set as a function of the number of
hand-labeled examples used in training (Figure 5). Although the
performance of the model increased as the size of the hand-labeled
dataset increased, the model performs well even with very little
labeled data. This suggests this technique may be applied to other
data-sparse regions with a comparable or fewer number of labels
as we created for this study.

4.2

Consensus in photointerpreted labels

As described in Section 3, we created a test dataset by randomly
sampling 350 points within Togo and having four experts label
each point as “crop” or “non-crop” using photointerpretation of
high-resolution satellite imagery. For each point, we chose the
label assigned by the majority of labelers (ties were discarded).
Figure 6 shows the number of examples for which each pair of
labelers chose the same label. Agreement between pairs of labelers
ranged from 229-278 (65%-79%) of the total points and all labelers agreed unanimously on 181 (52%) of the points. This level of
consensus was surprisingly low, and while our photointerpretationbased dataset is a high-quality surrogate for ground-truth labels, it
underscores the difficulty for even experts to determine land cover
types from high-resolution satellite imagery, particularly in developing countries. This should be considered in the design of future
photointerpretation-based labeling efforts, especially crowdsourced
efforts in which labelers may not be experts. We plan to conduct
a future study to assess agreement between labels determined by

in remote sensing data—which often exhibit high intraclass
variance and low inter-class variance—would also require
complex architectures. However, we found that a relatively
simple, shallow architecture achieved good results for this
task, and has the benefit of being faster in training/inference,
requiring fewer examples, and being less susceptible to overfitting than more complex architectures.
• The GFSAD [33] and Copernicus [4] cropland maps were
easy to find and download and were well-documented, which
enabled us to quickly benchmark our map against existing
maps. To give others this same benefit with our cropland
map, we have made our cropland map, code, and training
labels publicly available.

photointerpreted labels for different regions and land cover types.

Lessons learned for rapid response

The urgent need for a cropland map of Togo that captured smallholder farms (usually <1 ha) required us to leverage our research
methods to rapidly deliver a result for operational use in less than
10 days. During this process, we gathered several “lessons learned”
that we share to help prepare other researchers to leverage their
methods for rapid humanitarian response in the future, as well as
encourage community practices that facilitate rapid response.
• Good software engineering practices (such as developing
modular and well-documented code) is often prioritized in
operational rather than research settings. However, developing research methods motivated by their use for rapid
humanitarian response in the future requires integration
of operational practices into research workflows. We found
that developing research methods using operational software engineering practices enabled us to quickly execute
experiments and apply the method to large geographic areas
when the need for rapid response arose.
• Use of cloud services (in this case AWS) allowed us to easily
scale our model (particularly during country-wide inference)
and enable faster computation in a short period of time.
Additionally, the use of EC2 instances enabled processes to
be run, monitored, and modified by a distributed team rather
than a single user.
• File transfer/download remains a bottleneck for rapid response workflows. Transferring data from storage (e.g., via
Google Earth Engine, the Sentinel-2 AWS S3 bucket, or USGS
Earth Explorer) to compute (e.g., AWS) constituted a significant part of the time to deliver our cropland map. There is a
community need for better tools to enable searching, querying, and subsetting of geospatial data on cloud platforms.
• Given the complexity of deep learning architectures such as
Inception-v3 [28] or ResNet [10] designed for image classification, it might seem that classification of land cover or crops

CONCLUSION

Cropland maps are critical inputs for decision-makers to rapidly
design and enact policies during humanitarian crises, e.g., to deliver
aid or boost productivity for farmers, yet unavailability of highresolution, up-to-date cropland maps in most countries globally
precludes their use for rapid response. The development of cropland
maps, in turn, is limited by the availability of ground data that can
be used for training and validating machine learning classifiers.
We present a method for cropland classification in regions with
little to no available ground data that uses a multi-headed LSTM
network to learn global and local features for identifying cropland based on multispectral time-series Sentinel-2 observations.
We used this method to create a cropland map of Togo at 10 m
resolution in fewer than 10 days to assist the Togolese government
in decision-making about aid distribution to farmers during the
COVID-19 crisis. This demonstrated the successful transition of
machine learning research to operational use in rapid response for
a real humanitarian crisis, and we provided lessons learned from
this experience to facilitate this transition for other researchers in
the future. Additionally, our approach gives an example of how to
leverage existing readily-available labeled datasets and reduce the
number of data points to be collected in field campaigns, which can
be costly as well as infeasible due to regional insecurity or travel
restrictions (e.g., during the COVID-19 pandemic). In future work,
we plan to investigate leveraging our multi-headed LSTM approach
for crop type classification, subsetting the Geo-Wiki dataset based
on geographical or agroecological zones, and including Sentinel1 synethic aperture radar data in the model input to mitigate the
effects of clouds during the growing season. Additionally, we will apply our method for cropland mapping in other data-sparse African
countries.
