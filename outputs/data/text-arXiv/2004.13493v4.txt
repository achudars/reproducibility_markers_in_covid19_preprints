Abstract
The steep climbing of victims caused by the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) throughout
the planet is sparking an unprecedented effort to identify effective therapeutic regimens to tackle the
pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is known to gain entry into various cell types through the binding
of one of its surface proteins (spike) to the host Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2). Thus, the
spike-ACE2 interaction represents a major target for vaccines and antiviral drugs. A novel method has
been recently described by some of the authors to pharmacologically downregulate the expression of
target proteins at the post-translational level. This technology builds on computational advancements
in the simulation of folding mechanisms to rationally block protein expression by targeting folding
intermediates, hence hampering the folding process. Here, we report the all-atom simulations of the
entire sequence of events underlying the folding pathway of ACE2. Our data revealed the existence
of a folding intermediate showing two druggable pockets hidden in the native conformation. Both
pockets were targeted by a virtual screening repurposing campaign aimed at quickly identifying drugs
capable to decrease the expression of ACE2. We identified four compounds (the atypical antipsychotic
Ziprasidone, the antihistamine Buclizine, the antiviral Beclabuvir and the antimalaric Artefenomel) as
capable of lowering ACE2 expression in Vero cells in a dose-dependent fashion. All these molecules
were found to inhibit the entry into cells of a pseudotyped retrovirus exposing the SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein. Importantly, the antiviral activity has been tested against live SARS-CoV-2 (MEX-BC2/2020
strain). Our results indicate that one of the selected drugs (Artefenomel) could completely prevent
cytopathic effects induced by the presence of virus, thus showing a promising antiviral activity against
SARS-CoV-2. Ongoing studies are further evaluating the possibility of repurposing these drugs for the
treatment of COVID-19.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the viral pneumonia outbreak named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), a pandemic started at the end of 2019 in
the Hubei province of China and later spread to the rest of the planet1 . The disease shows unprecedented
transmission, morbidity and mortality rates2,3 . In the absence of a vaccine, effective therapeutics to control the disease are in urgent need. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the family of Coronaviridae, positive-sense,
single-stranded RNA viruses of humans and animals causing pathologies ranging from a common cold
to severe respiratory diseases, such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the Middle
1

East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)4 . Similarly to other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has four main
structural proteins, known as the nucleocapsid, membrane, envelope and spike5 . The latter promotes
the binding of the virus to the extracellular domain of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)6-8 .
Subsequently, another protein of the host, the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), cleaves the
spike protein, exposing a fusion peptide that promotes virus entry into the cell9 . ACE2 belongs to the
protein family of angiotensin-converting enzymes10 . The protein is reported to be expressed in cells of
the kidney, intestine, arteries, heart, and lung, although discrepancies about its expression profiles in different organs recently emerged11,12 . The main function of ACE2 is connected to its ability to lower blood
pressure by catalyzing the conversion of angiotensin II into the vasodilator angiotensin13 . The protein
is a promising drug target for treating cardiovascular diseases14,15 . Consistent with the mode of entry of
SARS-CoV-2 into human cells, hampering the interaction of spike with ACE2 should effectively counteract virus replication. This objective could be achieved by different strategies, including antibodies
against spike, compounds interfering with the spike-ACE2 interaction, or molecules capable of lowering
the exposure of ACE2 at the cell surface16 . The latter strategy could overcome possible evolutionary
variations of the virus conferring resistance to treatments directed against viral proteins. However, the
function of ACE2 on vascular regulation has been shown to play protective roles against virus-induced
lung injury, and the complete silencing of the protein would likely result in severe secondary effects6,17 .
For this reason, any pharmacological approach aimed at targeting ACE2 should be able to down-regulate
its expression rather than abrogating it. A novel method has been recently described for selectively reducing the level of target proteins, called Pharmacological Protein Inactivation by Folding Intermediate
Targeting (PPI-FIT)18 . The technology is based on the concept of targeting folding intermediates of
proteins rather than native conformations and is made possible by computational algorithms allowing
the all-atom reconstruction of folding pathways18,19 . The rationale underlying the PPI-FIT method is
that stabilizing a folding intermediate of a protein with small ligands should promote its degradation by
the cellular quality control machinery, which could recognize such artificially stabilized intermediates as
improperly folded species. Here, we report the full atomistic reconstruction of the folding pathway of
ACE2, which predicts the existence of a folding intermediate presenting two unique druggable pockets
hidden into the native state. These pockets were employed as novel target sites for virtual screening
campaigns aimed at repurposing compounds capable of modulating the expression of ACE2. The ability
of virtual hits compounds of reducing the expression of ACE2 was tested in Vero cells. The entry of
a pseudotyped retrovirus exposing the coronavirus spike protein was challenged by the presence of the
ACE2-suppressing compounds. Most importantly, the antiviral activity of these compounds against live
virus has been tested.

Results
All-Atom Reconstruction of the ACE2 Folding Pathway
To obtain the all-atom reconstruction of the folding pathway of apo-ACE2, we employed the so-called
Bias Functional approach (see Methods)20 . This enhanced path sampling scheme requires to provide
the protein native conformation, which was retrieved from PDB 1R42 (Figure 1).
This structure includes the atomic coordinates of the catalytic domain of the enzyme (residues 19-615).
The zinc ion in the active site, as well as the glycans, were both removed, due to uncertainties about their
binding kinetics. The Charmm36m forcefield21 was employed throughout the simulations. The native
structure of ACE2 was employed to generate 32 denatured conformations by a combination of unfolding
ratchet-and-pawl Molecular Dynamics (rMD) and high temperature MD simulations (see Methods).
For each conformation, 40 trajectories were generated by folding rMD, for a total of 1280 trajectories.
All the non-productive trajectories were discarded while folding trajectories of the remaining sets (N
= 18) were ranked based on the value of their Bias Functional (Equation 5 in Methods). For each set,
we selected the least biased trajectory (LBT), corresponding to the folding pathway with the highest
probability to occur in the absence of biasing forces20 . To gain information about the folding mechanism,
we considered a specific collective variable R defined as a normalized linear combination of the fraction
of native contacts (Q) and Root Mean Squared Deviation (RMSD) of atomic positions from the native
structure. According to our definition, R = 0 corresponds to the fully denatured state of the protein,

representation from two different perspectives. Folding regions are color-coded as follows: N-terminal region (residues 1982), blue; central core (residues 149-284 and 430-587), cyan; globular domain coordinating the zinc ion (residues 295-425),
magenta; C-terminal tail (residues 589-615), red.

while R = 1 to the native configuration. The 18 resulting least biased trajectories were employed to
generate the transition path energy function G(R) defined in Methods. This quantity provides a lower
bound to reaction limiting free-energy barriers that are overcome along the folding process. Therefore,
it can be used to infer the existence of folding intermediates. Since the bias functional approach cannot
be used to explore the dynamics within the reactant state, we restricted our analysis to the transition
region R > 0.55, where significant tertiary-structure content begins to appear. This reactive section of
the pathway contains two non-native metastable states, referred to as "early" and "late" intermediates
(Figure 2).

of the collective variables Q and RMSD. The filled curve represents the standard deviation of the profile, computed using
jackknife resampling. The graph shows the presence of two intermediate states (early and late) in addition to the native
state.

The analysis of protein conformations along the trajectories led to the description of the complete folding
mechanism for ACE2 (Figure 3). The first event along the ACE2 folding pathway is the formation of
three distinct regions (foldons) encompassing: (i) the two N-terminal α-helices (residues 19-82); (ii) the
globular domain (residues 295-425) containing the zinc coordinating amino acids; (iii) the central core
(residues 149-284 and 430-587), followed by the docking of the C-terminal tail (residues 589-615). These
regions then sequentially fold onto each other, giving rise to the native state.

Figure 3: Simplified representation of ACE2 folding pathway. The folding pathway of ACE2 begins with the

independent formation of the 3 main foldons (1): the N-terminal region (residues 19-82), depicted in blue; the central core
(residues 149-284 and 430-587), represented in cyan; the globular domain coordinating the zinc ion (residues 295-425).
Subsequently, the globular domain docks onto the central core (2), followed by the docking of the N-terminal region and
the formation of the C-terminal helix (residues 589-598) (3), which then dock on the central core (4), giving rise to the
native structure.

Indentification of ACE2 Folding Intermediates
A k-mean clustering was performed to obtain representative protein structures from the two non-native
free energy wells (i.e. early and late intermediates) appearing along the folding pathways (Supp. Figure
1). Four cluster centers per well were selected as representative conformations (Figure 4). The early
intermediate is characterized by the lack of docking of the three foldons, which may also appear as not
completely structured in some conformations. Conversely, the late ACE2 folding intermediate differs
from the native conformation mainly for the topology of the two N-terminal α-helices, which are not
docked to the rest of the structure in all the conformations.
Such a high degree of structural organization and low conformational variability represent ideal features
of a folding intermediate, allowing the reliable identification of druggable sites. Thus, the late folding
intermediate of ACE2 was further scouted for the presence of pockets suitable for virtual screening
campaigns.

(T) corresponding to the cluster represented by each protein conformation is shown below each structure. Domains are
colored as follows: N-terminal region (residues 19-82), blue; central core (residues 149-284 and 430-587), cyan; globular
domain coordinating the zinc ion (residues 295-425), magenta; C-terminal tail (residues 589-615), red.

Identification of Druggable Pockets on the ACE2 Late Intermediate.
To account for minor variations among the structures belonging to the same cluster, we selected an
additional protein conformation for each cluster of the late intermediate (Supp. Figure 2). This process
yielded a final number of 8 protein conformations, which were then used for the subsequent pocket
detection step. These structures were subjected to 50 ns of MD simulations at T = 310 K with position
restrain on Cα, to explore the conformational variability of the residues side-chains. Then, for each MD
simulation, 200 structures, equispaced in time, were extracted and analyzed with the SiteMap22 and
DogSiteScorer23 software. Pockets were then ranked based on a series of druggability descriptors (Supp.
Table 1). This analysis identified two predicted druggable pockets, exclusively present in the ACE2 late
intermediate state but not in the native conformation (Figure 5).

surface of the ACE2 folding intermediate (blue), while the surface of the druggable pocket is shown in magenta. The
superimposed structure of the native state is depicted as a green cartoon. In the native state, the structure composed by
residues 475-492 covers the binding pocket. In panel II, the intermediate structure is represented as a light blue cartoon,
while the volume of the druggable site is colored in magenta. In panel III, the residues forming the identified site are
depicted in magenta: 127, 130, 144, 152, 159, 160, 161, 163, 167, 168, 171, 172, 173, 174, 176, 230, 237, 241, 261, 262,
264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269, 270, 271, 272, 275, 448, 451, 452, 454, 455, 456, 459, 464, 497, 498, 499, 500, 502, 503. B.
Druggable Pocket 2. Panel I represents the surface of the intermediate state in blue, while the surface of the druggable
pocket is shown in magenta. The superimposed structure of the native state is depicted as a green cartoon. In the native
state, the structure composed by residues 598-603 covers the binding pocket. In panel II, the intermediate structure is
represented as a light blue cartoon, while the volume of the druggable site is colored in magenta. In panel III, residues
forming the identified site are depicted in magenta: 236, 239, 240, 242, 243, 247, 248, 281, 282, 283, 284, 285, 286, 436,
440, 443, 591, 592, 593, 594, 596, 597, 600.

In particular, pocket 1 results from a local structural variation into the core region (residues 468-498),
while pocket 2 results from the missing docking of the C-terminal tail onto the core region. To determine
the reliability of each druggable site, we measured the number of folding pathways presenting the relevant
structural variation underlying each pocket (Figure 6).

Figure 6: Analysis of folding mechanism yielding to pockets formation. A. The RMSD of the region composed

by residues 468-498, which hides pocket 1 in the native structure, is plotted as a function of the RMSD of its docking region
on the central core (residues 144-171, 221-283, 442-467, 499-519). In 1/18 trajectories these two regions are distant enough
to allow the formation of pocket 1 (RMSD res: 468-498 > 15 Å, RMSD docking region < 4 Å), while in the remaining
trajectories they fold cooperatively (15/18) or non-cooperatively (2/18), in both cases not leading to the formation of
pocket 1. B. The RMSD of the C-terminal tail (residues 589-615) is plotted as a function of the RMSD of its docking on
the central core (residues 221-265, 432-465, 513-533). Pocket 2 appears in all the trajectories (9/18) in which the docking
region is structured before the attachment of the C-terminal tail (RMSD CTT > 20 Å, RMSD docking region < 4 Å).

6

The least biased trajectories were projected on two graphs plotting the RMSD of each relevant region
(residues 468-498 or C-terminal tail) against the RMSD of the corresponding docking site. These
analyses revealed that the pocket 1 is present in a single trajectory, while the pocket 2 is predicted to
appear in 9 different trajectories.

In Silico Identification of Potential Binders of ACE2 Intermediate
The identification of potential ACE2 folding intermediate ligands was pursued by employing a drug
repositioning strategy. We built a unique collection of 9187 compounds by combining libraries of drugs
approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and molecules at different stages of currently
ongoing clinical trials (see Material and Methods). The chemical collection was screened against the
two identified pockets by following a consensus virtual screening workflow (Figure 7). Two different
docking software, Glide22 and LeadIT24 , were employed in parallel to predict the binding affinity of each
compound to the ACE2 folding intermediate pockets. Only compounds showing promising predicted
affinity (i.e. Glideds ≤ -6 kcal/mol; LeadIT HYDEaff ≤ 50 µM) in both docking protocols were submitted
to a third docking round based on AutoDock25 . This process identified two consensus sets (ADLBE ≤ -6
kcal/mol, ADNiC ≥ 25), including 145 compounds for pocket 1 and 238 for pocket 2. The top scoring
compounds from Glide (Glideds ≤ -9 kcal/mol) and LeadIT (HYDEaff ≤ 5 µM) were also added to these
sets. Finally, a visual inspection of binding mode and chemical similarity annotation for each ligand
allowed the selection of 14 virtual hits for pocket 1 and additional 21 for pocket 2 (Supp. Table 2).

pocket 1 of the ACE2 folding intermediate. Purple arrows indicate H-bonds; green lines indicates the π-stacking. Residues
are labeled with different colors, corresponding to negatively charged (red), polar (cyan) and hydrophobic (green).

Collectively, these results predicted 35 potential ligands for the ACE2 folding intermediate (Supp. Table 2). Out of these 35 predicted ligand, 8 (ALK-4290, Iferanserin, Lifibrol, LY-2624803, PF-00217830,
Phenindamine, Serdemetan and Vapitadine) were not commercially available. Instead, we tested 8 additional analogues of mefloquine (Hydroxychloroquine, Piperaquine, Chloroquine, Primaquine, Amodiaquine, Halofantrine, Tafenoquine and Amodiaquine), drug belongs to a class of antimalaria agents
recently described for their potential effect against SARS-CoV-2 26,27 . While the precise mechanism
by which chloroquine and its more active derivative hydroxychloroquine inhibit virus replication is not
known, reports suggest that the compounds may act by reducing the glycosylation of ACE228 .

Cell-Based Validation of In Silico-Predicted ACE2 Suppressing Drugs
As a preliminary step, we sought to test the endogenous expression of ACE2 in different untrasfected
cells, including HEK293, HepG2, Huh-7 and Vero, by western blotting. Results show that ACE2
expression is higher in Vero cells (Supp. Figure 3). These cells were then employed in subsequent
experiments. In order to test the effect of the different molecules on ACE2 expression, Vero cells were
exposed for 48 h to each compound at three to five different concentrations (0.3-300 µM, depending on
their solubility) and the expression of the protein was evaluated by western blotting. Similarly, cells
exposed to the same compounds and concentrations were analyzed by MTT to estimate the intrinsic
cytotoxicity of each molecule. Among the in silico predicted 35 different compounds, we validated 9
molecules for their ability to lower at least 25% of the expression of ACE2 (Supp. Table 3) by western
blotting, as compared to vehicle controls, in at least one experiment. All the molecules were also tested
for their intrinsic toxicity, as assayed by MTT (Supp. Table 3).

Cloroquine and Analogues do not Alter the Levels of ACE2
Chloroquine, a clinically approved drug effective against malaria, has recently attracted widespread
interest as potential therapy for COVID-19. The drug has been reported to interfere with terminal glycosylation of ACE2, which may negatively regulate the virus-receptor binding and inhibit the infection.
In our screening, we tested Chloroquine diphosphate as well as several related compounds, including
Hydroxychloroquine Sulfate, Tafenoquine succinate, Mefloquine, Primaquine diphosphate, Piperaquine
phosphate, Halofantrine hydrochloride and Amodiaquine. Results showed a general increase in the
ACE2 signal upon treatment with Chloroquine or related compounds (with the exception of Piperaquine), often accompanied by a decrease in ACE2 molecular weight, possibly confirming alterations
in the glycosylation of the protein (Supp. Fig. 4). However, based on the absence of ACE2-lowering
effects, these molecules were not considered as promising candidates for further analyses.

Dose-Response Validation of ACE2-Reducing Drugs
The nine different candidate compounds, capable of reducing ACE2 expression, were further analyzed by
dose-response experiments using western blotting and MTT assays (Figure 8). Eight to ten concentration points were chosen, depending on solubility and intrinsic toxicity (0.01-300 µM). Five compounds
(Bifonazole, Rimonabant, Ebastine, Piperaquine, Brompheniramine) failed to show a dose-dependent
effect and/or showed an intrinsic toxicity in the same of range of concentrations at which the ACE2
lowering effects were observed. Conversely, we found 4 drugs capable of dose-dependently lower the expression of ACE2 in absence of significant cytotoxicity. Ziprasidone (an atypical antipsychotic), showed
a dose-dependent lowering effect on ACE2 levels, with an estimated inhibitory concentration at 50%
(IC50 ) of 10.6 µM, while the compound showed no significant toxicity even at the highest concentration
tested (300 µM). Buclizine (an antihistamine piperazine derivative), significantly reduced ACE2 levels
starting from 30 µM, and induced evident cytotoxicity (>30%) only at 100 µM. Beclabuvir (an antiviral
drug for the treatment of hepatitis C virus, currently in clinical trials) was able to dose-dependently
reduce ACE2 levels starting from 0.3 µM, and showed a significant toxicity only at 30 µM. Artefenomel
(a novel antimalarial trioxolane currently in clinical trials) lowered ACE2 expression in a statistically
significant fashion starting from 0.3 µM without inducing any cytotoxicity at the tested concentrations
(up to 300 µM). Based on their lowering effects on ACE2, as well as on the evaluation of their intrinsic
toxicity, we elected these compounds as positive hits for further analyses.

Evaluation of Inhibitory Effects on a Pseudotyped Retrovirus Exposing the SARSCoV-2 Spike Protein
The SARS-CoV-2 virus gains entry into various cells through the binding of its surface protein spike to
the host ACE2 receptor. Thus, compounds capable of lowering the expression of ACE2 should also be
able to prevent virus entry into cells. In order to directly test this possibility, we employed a pseudotyped
retroviral vector exposing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, as well as a GFP reporter.

Figure 8: Cell-based validation of candidate hits. Untransfected Vero cells were exposed to different concentrations
of each compound (indicated) or vehicle (DMSO or Milli-Q or Methanol, volume equivalent) for 48 h, lysed and analyzed by
western blotting. Signals were detected by using specific anti-ACE2 primary antibody, relevant HRP-coupled secondary
antibodies, and revealed using a ChemiDoc Touch Imaging System. Western blot images are representative examples
of different experiments (n ≥ 3). The graphs show the densitometric quantification of the levels of ACE2 (A). Each
signal was normalized on the corresponding total protein lane (detected by UV, and allowed by the enhanced tryptophan
fluorescence technology of stain-free gels) and expressed as the percentage of the level in vehicle (Vhc)-treated controls.
B. The intrinsic toxicity of each molecule was assessed by MTT assay. The graphs show cell viability values expressed
as percentage of vehicle (DMSO or MilliQ-water, volume equivalent)-treated cells. Concentration points were chosen
depending on solubility and intrinsic toxicity. None of the compounds show toxicity at the indicated concentration.
Statistically significant differences are indicated by the asterisk (* p < 0.05).

Vero cells incubated with each of the four candidate compounds at different concentrations were transduced with retroviral vectors pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, or with control vectors
without it. The effect of each compound on retroviral vector transduction was estimated by quantifying
the relative percentage of cells presenting the GFP fluorescence. We found that all the four compounds
inhibited retroviral transduction in a dose-dependent fashion, at concentrations similar to those at which
the molecules lowered ACE2 expression (Figure 9). Importantly, none of the compounds induced significant cytotoxicity in this assay, with the exception of Beclabuvir, which showed cytotoxicity but only at
the highest concentrations tested (30 and 100 µM, not shown). Collectively, these results indicate that
the ability of the selected compounds to lower the expression of ACE2 translates in a reduced cellular
entry for a pseudotyped retroviral vector exposing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.

Figure 9: Effect of ACE2-lowering drugs on the transduction efficiency of a pseudotyped retroviral vector.
Vero cells exposed to each compound at the indicated concentration were transduced with a SARS-CoV-2-Spike protein
pseudotyped retroviral vector functionalized with a GFP reporter gene. Identical retroviral vectors missing the spike
protein were used as controls. The number of transduced cells were quantified by detecting the GFP fluorescence using a
plate reader and analyzed with the ImageJ software (NIH). The number of fluorescent cells was normalized to the amount
of cells within each well, estimated by using the MTT assay, and expressed as the percentage of the vehicle control. For
each condition, mean ± SD were calculated from at least 3 independent replicates. Statistical analyses were performed
using the one-way ANOVA Dunnett’s post-hoc test. Each compound was tested at relevant concentrations excluding those
at which the molecule showed detectable intrinsic fluorescence. Significant changes are indicated by an asterisk (* p <
0.05).

Antiviral activity against live SARS-CoV-2
Sibylla Biotech SRL requested RetroVirox Inc., San Diego, California, to perform full-dose antiviral
testing on the four candidate compounds. Assays against live SARS-CoV-2 were performed against the
MEX-BC2/2020 strain. A cytopathic effect (CPE) based antiviral assay was performed by infecting
Vero E6 cells in the presence or absence of test-items. Infection of cells leads to significant cytopathic
effect and cell death after 4 days of infection. In this assay, reduction of CPE in the presence of inhibitors
was used as a marker to determine the antiviral activity of the tested items (Figure 10).

Figure 10: IC50 values for Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 CPE by test-items. Values indicate the percentage

inhibition of the CPE induced by live SARS-CoV-2 (MEX-BC2/2020), as compared to samples incubated with no testitem (vehicle alone). Results show the average of duplicate data points from two separate plates for Ziprasidone, Buclizine
and Beclabuvir, and the average of triplicate data points from two separate plates for Artefenomel. Data was modeled to
a sigmoidal function using GraphPad Prism software fitting a normalized dose-response curve with a variable slope.

Viability assays to determine test-item-induced loss of cell viability was monitored in parallel using
the same readout, but treating uninfected cells with the test-items. Antiviral and cytotoxic effects
(expressed as IC50 and CC50 ) are summarized in Table 1. Of the four test-items evaluated, Artefenomel
completely prevented the virus-induced CPE in the concentration range 33 µM to 100 µM, resulting
in viability levels similar to those observed in uninfected cells. The antiviral activity of Artefenomel
shows a dose-response curve with an IC50 of 2.9 µM. The cell viability assay further assessed that the
antiviral activity displayed by Artefenomel was not due to cytotoxicicity. None of the concentrations
evaluated of the test-item displayed any cytotoxicity. Buclizine also completely prevented the virusinduced CPE at a concentration of 11 µM, where the cell viability resulted in 75% of vehicle. The
dynamic range of the antiviral activity displayed by Buclizine was narrow, with an IC50 value between
10

5 and 6 µM. Significant inhibition of CPE was only observed between 1 µM and 11 µM, and then
disappeared at higher concentrations (data not shown), likely due to the intrinsic cytotoxicity induced
at such concentrations, as shown in the absence of SARS-CoV-2. A modest antiviral activity was also
observed with Beclabuvir at 1 µM and 10 µM. At a concentration of 30 µM the compound induced
cytotoxicity and lost antiviral activity. In the tested condition, Ziprasidone showed no antiviral activity
in this assay.

Table 1: Summary of antiviral and cytotoxic results. IC50 (antiviral), and CC50 (cytotoxicity) values are shown

for the test-items and GS-441254. Signal-to-background ratios (S/B), and average coefficients of variation (C.V.) are
shown. The average CV was determined for all data points in the case of Artefenomel and for duplicate data-points for
which 50% or greater A540 values were observed, as compared to cells infected in the presence of vehicle alone (CPE
assay), or uninfected cells (viability assay) in the case of Ziprasidone, Buclizine and Beclabuvir. When viral inhibition, or
cell viability (CC50) did not reach 50% at the highest concentration tested, the IC50 or CC50 values are shown as greater
than the highest concentration tested. IC50 values were generated with Graphpad Prism in the case of Artefenomel. IC50
values for Buclizine could not be calculated with Graphpad Prism software due to the loss of antiviral activity observed
at the highest concentrations. The IC50 value shown was manually extrapolated after eliminating the data-points for 33
µM and 100 µM concentrations.

Discussion
Multiple pieces of evidence indicate that downregulating the expression of ACE2 of the SARS-CoV2
infection should effectively inhibit virus replication. However, selectively decreasing the expression of
a host target protein could be a difficult task. RNA silencing or CRISPR-based strategies represent
valid options, but their use could be limited by delivery issues29,30 . These problems could be overcome
by emerging pharmacological technologies like the proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs), which
build on the principle of designing bi-functional compounds capable of interacting with the target
protein with one side and engaging the E3 ubiquitin ligase with the other, leading to the degradation of
the polypeptide by the proteasome31 . Similarly, the PPI-FIT method capitalizes on the cellular quality
control machinery to promote the degradation of the target polypeptide, although it does not require the
development of bi-functional molecules. PPI-FIT-derived compounds aim at stimulating the removal
of the target protein by directly blocking its folding pathway18 . In this manuscript, we described
the application of the PPI-FIT paradigm to ACE2. Our analyses predict the existence of a folding
intermediate showing two unique druggable pockets not present in the native ACE2 conformation. In
order to respond to the urgent need for an effective therapy against SARS-CoV-2, we targeted both
pockets by an in silico virtual screening approach aimed at repurposing drugs currently in clinical
trials or already approved by the FDA. Nine molecules were found to decrease ACE2 expression in
Vero cells. Five of those were discarded as showing toxicity in the same concentration range at which
11

ACE2 expression is lowered. The remaining four compounds were effective in reducing ACE2 levels
at concentrations showing limited cellular toxicity, if any. The four compounds were able to interfere
with the cellular entry of a pseudotyped retrovirus exposing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with doseresponse profiles closely resembling those observed for their ability in lowering ACE2 expression. The
reduction of ACE2 at the cellular level, results in reduced transduction of a pseudotyped virus. Among
the four positive molecules, Ziprasidone and Artefenomel showed the highest activity in the absence of
any toxicity. Most importantly, the antiviral activity of the four compounds against live SARS-CoV-2
has been tested. Artefenomel has shown inhibition of the cytopathic effect induced by the presence
of the live virus with dose-response profile showing an IC50 of 2.9 µM, with no cytotoxic effect at
all concentrations tested. These results strongly support the rationale behind the application of the
PPI-FIT methodology to tackle SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Methods
Software & Resources
The simulations were performed on the high-performance-computing facilities of the Italian Institute
for Nuclear Physics (INFN) and on the computer cluster of Sibylla Biotech. A modified version of
Gromacs 201932 was employed to run the calculations. Data analysis was carried out using Python and
its libraries: NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib and MDAnalysis.

Structure & Topology
The structure of ACE2 was retrieved from PDB 1R42. The file contains the catalytic domain (residues
19-615) solved by X-ray crystallography at 2.2 Å of resolution. Protein topology was generated using
Charmm36m after removal of the catalytic zinc ion and sugar moieties. Cysteines were treated in the
reduced state. Water molecules were modeled using the Charmm-modified TIP3P.

Generation and Selection of Unfolded Initial Conditions
The ACE2 structure was positioned in a cubic box with minimum wall distance equal to 60 Å. The
system was filled with water molecules, neutralized with 28 Na+ ions and brought to a final 150 mM NaCl
concentration. This setup was followed by an energy minimization using the steepest descent algorithm.
An NVT equilibration at 800 K was carried out using the V-rescale thermostat. Then, so-called ratchet
and pawl (rMD) molecular dynamics simulations33,34 were employed to obtain the denatured states. In
this method, an external biasing force is added, acting along a single collective variable, denoted as
z(X):
z(X) =

N
X

2
Cij (X) − Cij (XR )

(1)

|i−j|>35

where Cij (X) is an entry of the instantaneous contact map and Cij (XR ) is an entry of the reference
contact map, both defined as:
Cij (X) =

1 − (|xi − xj |/r0 )6
1 − (|xi − xj |/r0 )10

(2)

where xi and xj are the coordinates of the ith and jth atoms of the protein; while r0 is the reference
contact-distance that is set to 7.5 Å. In applications of rMD to protein denaturation, all the entries
of the reference contact map were set to 0. In applications of rMD to protein folding simulations,
the reference contact map Cij (XR ) is calculated from Eq. (2) using the protein’s native conformation,
obtained by performing energy minimization starting from the PDB structure. In any rMD simulation,
the system evolves according to plain MD as long as the value of z(x) spontaneously decreases during
time. Instead, system fluctuations leading to an increase in z(X) result in the activation of the biasing
force defined as:
(
−kR ∇i z(X)[z(X) − zm (t)] if z(X) > zm (t)
Fi (X, zm ) =
(3)
0
if z(X) ≤ zm (t)
where zm (t) is the minimum value assumed by z(X) up to time t, and the index i indicates the atom
on which the force is acting. To obtain the denatured protein conformations, 32 rMD trajectories of 1
ns each with a force constant kR = 8 · 10−4 kJ/mol. These simulations were followed by 4 ns of plain
MD at 800 K in the NVT ensemble. For each plain MD unfolding trajectory, the protein conformation
minimizing the following function was selected:
Pn−m Pn
−1
2
i=0
j=i+m (j − i) max(1 − r0 kxi − xj k, 0)
S(X) =
(4)
Pn−m Pn

i=0
j=i+m (j − i)

13

where n is the total number of atoms, m is the number of ignored subsequent atoms and r0 is a
parameter, set to 40 Å. This metrics is a norm of the contact maps, where atoms with distant indexes
weight more in the calculation. Conformations with low value of S(X) are characterized by high degree
of denaturation, vice-versa, conformations with high value of S(X) are less denatured.

Generation of the Folding Trajectories
Selected initial conditions (N = 32) were positioned in a cubic box with minimum wall-distance of
10 Å. Each system was filled with water molecules, neutralized with 28 Na+ ions and brought to a
final 150 mM NaCl concentration. Energy minimization was subsequently performed using the steepest
descent algorithm. Then, each system was subjected to 500 ps of NVT equilibration at 350 K (using
the V-rescale thermostat35 ), followed by 500 ps of NPT equilibration at 350 K and 1 Bar (using the
V-rescale thermostat and the Parrinello-Rahman barostat). During equilibration, position restraints
with force constant 1000 kJ·mol−1 nm−2 where introduced on heavy atoms. For each initial condition,
40 rMD trajectories were generated, each one consisting in 5 · 106 steps with integration time-step of
2 fs. In this set of rMD simulations, reference contact map entering Eq. 1 was calculated using the
native structure of ACE2. Cutoff for Coulomb interactions was set to 12 Å, cutoff for Van der Waals
interactions was set to 12 Å with force-switch having 10 Å radius. Long range electrostatics was treated
with particle mesh Ewald. Trajectories reaching a configuration with an RMSD lower than 4 Å were
considered productive folding events. For each set of folding trajectories (starting from the same initial
condition) the pathway with the highest probability to occur in absence of external bias was identified
by selecting the one minimizing the Bias Functional [20], defined as:
T =

N
X
i=1

m i γi

dτ |FrM
(X, τ )|2

Where mi and γi are the mass and the friction coefficient of the ith atom, FirM D is the force acting on
it, while t is the trajectory folding time.

Reconstruction of the Transition Path Energy Profile
The collective variables Q and RMSD were linearly combined and normalized to obtain a one-dimensional
reaction coordinate, R:
R=

From the frequency histogram of the least biased trajectories we estimated the probability P (R) to
observe a given value of the collective variable. We refer to the quantity G(R) = −ln[P (R)] as to the
“transition path energy”. In a biased dynamics, G(R) yields a lower-bound to the rate limiting freeenergy barriers, thus provides a useful tool to identify metastable states. The standard deviation σ was
estimated through a jackknifing procedure, in particular, the free energy profile was computed for 18
times by leaving a different trajectory out in each calculation. For each bin, the standard deviation σ
was calculated as:
v

where n is the total number of leas biased trajectories, θ̂i is the mean value of the jackknife replicate
(where the ith trajectory was removed) and θ̂(·) is the mean of the jackknife replicates.

Clustering Analysis
Protein conformations were sampled from the two identified energy wells, in particular, the earlyintermediate was defined with 0.59 < R < 0.68, while the late-intermediate was defined with 0.797 <
14

R < 0.865 (Supp. Figure 1). The two sets of structures were then subjected to k-mean clustering (k
= 4), using the Frobenius norm of the contact maps as a distance metrics. Then, for each cluster, a
single representative conformation was selected by choosing the structure minimizing its distance from
the relative cluster center.

Identification of the Binding Pockets
The 4 cluster centers of the late intermediate and 4 additional conformations (each one extracted as a
cluster variant) were positioned in a cubic box with minimum wall-distance of 10 Å, that was filled with
water molecules. The system was neutralized with 28 Na+ ions and brought to a final 150 mM NaCl
concentration. Energy minimization was subsequently performed, using the steepest descent algorithm.
Then, each system was equilibrated for 500 ps in the NVT ensemble at 310 K (using the V-rescale
thermostat), followed by 500 ps of NPT equilibration at 310 K and 1 Bar (using the V-rescale thermostat
and the Parrinello-Rahman barostat). During equilibration, position restraints with force constant 1000
kJ·mol−1 nm−2 where introduced on heavy atoms. Subsequently, 50 ns of MD were performed for each
structure by retaining the positional restraints on the Cα of the protein backbone. For each trajectory,
200 frames, equally spaced in time, were extracted. Each frame was analyzed by means of SiteMap36 and
DogSiteScorer23 software in order to identify druggable pockets. We considered as druggable a pocket
falling within the following thresholds: volume ≥ 300 Å3 ; depth ≥ 10 Å; balance ≥ 1.0; exposure ≤ 0.5;
enclosure ≥ 0.70; SiteScore ≥ 0.8; DScore ≥ 0.90; DrugScore ≥ 0.5; SimpleScore ≥ 0.5 (Supp. Table
1). Two pockets emerged as interesting, pocket 1, defined by residues: 127, 130, 144, 152, 159, 160,
161, 163, 167, 168, 171, 172, 173, 174, 176, 230, 237, 241, 261, 262, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269, 270,
271, 272, 275, 448, 451, 452, 454, 455, 456, 459, 464, 497, 498, 499, 500, 502, 503; pocket 2, defined by
residues: 236, 239, 240, 242, 243, 247, 248, 281, 282, 283, 284, 285, 286, 436, 440, 443, 591, 592, 593,
594, 596, 597, 600. The corresponding protein conformations were submitted to the virtual screening
workflow (Figure 7A).

Preparation of the Virtual Library
The FDA-approved drug library included compounds from the following chemical collections: Selleck
(accession date 21/03/2020, 2684 compounds), Prestwick (accession date 21/03/2020, 1520 compounds)
and eDrug-3D (accession date 21/03/2020, 1930 compounds). Compounds from the DrugBank collection (DrugBank Release Version 5.1.5; 1784 molecules), which includes approved, experimental and
investigational drugs, were added. The four chemical libraries were merged using an in-house developed
KNIME workflow to obtain a unique library of non-redundant entries (total of 9187 compounds). The
final collection was prepared with the LigPrep tool37 . Ionization/tautomeric states were generated at
pH range 7-8 using Epik38 . Furthermore, at most 32 stereoisomers per ligand and three lowest energy
conformations per ligand ring were produced. Where not defined, all the chiral form of each stereocenter
was produced. In total, 12771 docking clients were generated.

Virtual Screening Workflow
For the Glide docking22 , the N- and C- terminal residues of the ACE2 intermediate were capped with
acetyl (ACE) and N-methylamine (NMA) groups, respectively, using the Schrödinger Protein Preparation Wizard. The capped protein structure was used to generate the receptor grid, with no scaling of
Van der Waals radii for non-polar receptor atoms. The docking space was centered on the centroid of
the residues defining the pockets (x: 75.4, y: 58.2, z: 67.6 for pocket 1; x: 50.8, y: 57.0, z: 69.1 for
pocket 2). The docking space was defined as a 35 Å3 cubic box, while the diameter midpoint of docked
ligands was required to remain within a smaller, nested 15 Å3 cubic box. Docking experiments were
performed in the Glide standard precision mode using a 0.8 factor to scale the Van der Waals radii of the
ligand atoms with partial atomic charge less than 0.15. For the BioSolveIT docking, LeadIT (version
3.2.0) was used for protein preparation and docking parameters definition. The binding site was defined
on the basis of the residues composing the identified druggable pocket. The residue protonation states,
as well as the tautomeric forms, were automatically assessed in LeadIT using the ProToss method, that
generates the most probable hydrogen positions on the basis of an optimal hydrogen bonding network
15

using an empirical scoring function. The virtual screening workflow was developed by using the KNIME
analytic platform and the BioSolveIT KNIME nodes. Specifically, the workflow was organized as follows:
(i) the Compute LeadIT Docking node was selected to perform the docking simulations of the ∼11·103
docking clients by using the FlexX algorithm39 . Ten poses for each ligand were produced; (ii) the Assess
Affinity with HYDE in SeeSAR node generated refined binding free energy and HYDE40 predicted activity (HYDEaff ) for each ligand pose using the HYDE rescoring function; and (iii) for each ligand, the
pose with the lowest HYDEaff was extracted. For AutoDock docking, ligands and receptor structures
were converted to the AD4 format using AutoDockTools and the Gasteiger-Marsili empirical atomic
partial charges were assigned. The dimensions of the grid were 60 X 60 X 60 points, with grid points
separated by a 0.375 Å. The grid was centered on the centroids of pockets 1 and 2. The Lamarckian
genetic algorithm was used, and for each compound, the docking simulation was composed of 100 runs.
Clustering of docked conformations was performed on the basis of their RMSD (tolerance = 2.0 Å) and
the results were ranked based on the estimated free energy of binding. The obtained poses were filtered
based on the Glide docking score (Glideds ), the HYDEaff and AutoDock ligand binding energy (ADLBE )
as well as on the number of clusters (ADNiC ). The consensus virtual screening workflow was applied for
both pocket 1 and pocket 2 (Figure 7A). The best scored structures for the three software were visually
inspected and selected based on their binding mode and predicted interactions. In addition, the top
scoring compounds for Glide docking and SeeSAR rescoring41 were also evaluated. In particular, the
Glide set was generated following these criteria: Glideds ≤ -9 kcal/mol, giving rise to 97 molecules for
pocket 1 and 30 for pocket 2. The SeeSAR set was instead defined by applying the following filters: (i)
HYDEaff ≤ 5 µM; (ii) Ligand efficiency (LE) and lipophilic ligand efficiency (LLE) category from 1 to
4 (where 1 corresponds to favorable LE/LLE, 5 corresponds to unfavorable LE/LLE); (iii) Good ligand
conformer quality, judged on the basis of torsional quality of the rescored pose rotamers and intramolecular clashes; (iv) no protein-ligand intermolecular clashes, giving rise to 89 molecules for pocket 1 and
205 molecules for pocket 2.

Cell Cultures
HEK293, HepG2, Huh-7 and Vero cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Minimal Essential Medium (Euroclone #ECB7501L) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (∆56-FBS, Gibco #10270),
Penicillin/Streptomycin (Corning #20-002-Cl), non-essential amino acids (Euroclone #ECB3054D) and
L-Glutamine (Gibco #25030-024). Cells were passaged in 100 mm2 Petri and split every 3-4 days. Cells
employed in this study have not been passaged more than 20 times from the original stock.

Compound and Treatments
A total 35 different compounds were tested in Vero cells for their ability to lower the expression of ACE2
(see Supp. Table 3). Each molecule, received as powder, was resuspended at 50-30 or 15 mM in DMSO
(Euroclone #APA36720250) or in Milli-Q water or Methanol. Stock solutions were prepared at 0.3, 3
and 30 mM (1000X). To treat cells, a 1 µL aliquot of each stock solution was added to a well from a
24-well plate containing 1 mL of antibiotic-free cell medium (corresponding to final concentrations of
0.3, 3 and 30 µM). Vehicle controls were obtained by adding equivalent volumes of DMSO or Milli-Q
water.

Cell Viability Assay (MTT)
Cells were seeded on 24-well plates at approximately ∼60% confluence. Compounds at different concentrations, or vehicle control (DMSO/MilliQ water, volume equivalent), were added after 24 h. Medium
was replaced the second day, and then removed after a total of 48 h treatment. Cells were incubated with
5 mg/mL of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) (Sigma #M5655-1G)
in PBS for 15 min at 37 ◦ C. After carefully removing MTT, cells were resuspended in 100 µL DMSO,
and cell viability values obtained by a plate spectrophotometer, measuring absorbance at 560 nm.

Western Blotting & Antibodies
Cells were plated on 24-well plates at approximately ∼60% confluence. Compounds at different concentrations or vehicle control (DMSO, volume equivalent) were added after 24 h, medium was replaced the
second day, and then removed after a total of 48 h treatment. Samples were lysed in lysis buffer (Tris
10mM, pH 7.4, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5% TX-100, 150mM NaCl plus complete EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor
Cocktail Tablets). Quantification of the protein was performed by BCA kit (Thermo Fisher #23225).
A 40-µg aliquot of total proteins were diluted 2:1 in 4X Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mM
Dithiothreitol, boiled 8 min at 95 ◦ C and loaded on SDS-PAGE, using 12% acrylamide pre-cast gels and
then transferred to hydrophilic polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes. Membranes were blocked
for 20 min in 5% (w/v) non-fat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.01% Tween-20 (TBS-T).
Blots were probed with anti-ACE2 antibody (1:200) (AC18Z, Santa Cruz) in 3% (w/v) BSA in TBS-T
overnight at 4 ◦ C, washed 3 times with TBS-T 10 min each, then probed with a 1:3000 dilution of
horseradish conjugated goat anti-mouse for 1 h at RT. After 2 washes with TBS-T and one with Milli-Q
water, signals were revealed using the ECL Select Western Blotting Detection Reagent (RPN2235, GE
Healthcare) and visualized with a ChemiDoc XRS Touch Imaging System (Bio-Rad).

Statistical Analyses
Statistical analyses, performed with the Prism software version 8.0 (GraphPad), included all the data
points obtained, with the exception of experiments in which negative and/or positive controls did not
give the expected outcome. No test for outliers was employed. Results were expressed as the mean ±
standard errors. All the data were analyzed with the one-way ANOVA test, including an assessment of
the normality of data, and corrected by the Dunnet post-hoc test. Probability (p) values < 0.05 were
considered as significant (*). Inhibitory concentration at 50% (IC50 ) or lethal dose at 50% (LD50) values
were obtained by fitting dose-response curves to a sigmoidal function using a 4PL non-linear regression
model.

Preparation of Viral Vectors
Retroviral particles exposing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were produced as follow. HEK293-T cells
were seeded into 10 cm plates with selection medium (DMEM with G418 0,5 mg/mL). Once cells reached
∼80% confluence, medium was replaced with DMEM containing 2,5% FBS. Cells were then transfected
with three different plasmids (MLV transfer vector, pc NCG; packaging vector, pc Gag-Pol, and envencoding vector, pc SARS-CoV-2 spike ∆C; see schematic below). The control retroviral particles was
obtained by transfecting the cells with the packaging and the transfer vectors only.

Supernantants were collected and centrifuged at 2000 xg for 5 min, then filtered using a 0.45 µm filter
and ultracentrifuged at 20.000 xg for 2 h Pellets were resuspended in 1X PBS and stored at -80 ◦ C.

Transduction Assay
On day 1, untransfected Vero cells or HEK293 cells stably expressing the human ACE2 were seeded
on 96-well plates in DMEM medium (10% FBS, Pen/Strep, L-glutamine, non-essential amino acids).
After 24 and 48 h, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing each compound to be tested
at the desired concentration. On day 4, a 3 µl aliquot of retroviral vectors exposing the SARS-CoV-2
17

spike protein, or control vectors, was added to each well. For Vero cells, this step was repeated a second
time on day 5 in order to increase the number of transduced cells. Three days after transduction, cells
showing the GFP fluorescence were detected with an EnSightTM Multimode Microplate Reader.

Testing antiviral activity against live virus SARS-CoV-2 (MEX-BC2/2020)
Here we report the experimental procedure for antiviral and cytotoxic assays performed by Retrovirox
Inc, San Diego, California.
Sars-CoV-2 antiviral activity
Vero E6 cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), hereby called DMEM10.
Cells were seeded and incubated for 24 hours before being pre-incubated with test-items. Twentyfour hours post cell seeding, test samples were submitted to serial dilutions with DMEM with 2% FBS
(DMEM2) in a different plate, cell culture was removed from cells, and serial dilutions of test-items were
added to the cells and incubated for 4 h at 37◦ C in a humidified incubator. After the pre-incubation of
test-items with target cells, cells were challenged with the viral inoculum resuspended in DMEM2. The
amount of viral inoculum was previously titrated to result in a linear response inhibited by antivirals
with activity against SARS-CoV-2. Cell culture media with the virus inoculum was not removed, and
the test-items and virus were maintained in the media for the duration of the assay (96 h). After
this period the extent of cell viability was monitored with the neutral red (NR) uptake assay. The
virus-induced CPE was monitored under the microscope after 3 days of infection and at day 4 cells were
stained with neutral red to monitor cell viability. Viable cells incorporate neutral red in their lysosomes.
The uptake relies on the ability of live cells to maintain the pH inside the lysosomes lower than in the
cytoplasm. This process requires ATP. Inside the lysosome the dye becomes charged and is retained.
After a 3 h incubation with neutral red (0.033%), the extra dye was washed and the neutral red taken by
lysosomes was then extracted for 15 minutes with a solution containing 50% ethanol and 1% acetic acid to
monitor absorbance at 540 nm. Ziprasidone, Buclizine and Beclabuvir were evaluated in quadruplicates
(duplicates in two separate plates), while Artefenomel was evaluated in double triplicated (triplicates in
two separate plates) using serial 3-fold dilutions. Controls included uninfected cells (“mock-infected”),
and infected cells to which only vehicle was added. Some cells were treated with GS-441524. GS-441524
is the main metabolite of remdesivir, a broad spectrum antiviral that blocks the RNA polymerase of
SARS-CoV-2. The average absorbance at 540 nm (A540) observed in infected cells (in the presence of
vehicle alone) was calculated, and then subtracted from all samples to determine the inhibition of the
virus induced CPE. Data points were then normalized to the average A540 signal observed in uninfected
cells (“mock”) after subtraction of the absorbance signal observed in infected cells. In the neutral red
CPE-based assay, uninfected cells remained viable and uptake the dye at higher levels than non-viable
cells. In the absence of antiviral agents the virus-induced CPE kills infected cells and leads to lower
A540 (this value equals 0% inhibition). By contrast, incubation with the antiviral agent (GS-441524)
prevents the virus induced CPE and leads absorbance levels similar to those observed in uninfected
cells. Full recovery of cell viability in infected cells represent 100% inhibition of virus replication.
Cytotoxicity assays
Uninfected cells were incubated with eight concentrations of test-items or control inhibitors dilutions.
The incubation temperature and duration of the incubation period mirrored the conditions of the prevention of virus-induced CPE assay, and cell viability was evaluated with the neutral red uptake method
but this time utilizing uninfected cells, otherwise the procedure was the same as the one used for the
antiviral assays. The extent of viability was monitored by measuring absorbance at 540 nm. When analyzing the data, background levels obtained from wells with no cells were subtracted from all data-points.
Absorbance readout values were given as a percentage of the average signal observed in uninfected cells
treated with vehicle alone. The average signal obtained in wells with no cells was subtracted from all
samples. Readout values were given as a percentage of the average signal observed in uninfected cells
treated with vehicle alone (DMEM2). The signal- to-background (S/B) obtained was 29-fold. DMSO
was used as a cytotoxic compound control in the viability assays. DMSO blocked cell viability by more
than 99% when tested at 10%.

Supplementary Figures

Supp. Figure 1: Representation of the selected regions defined by the energy wells. The selected regions
defining the two energy wells are depicted in orange. In particular, the early-intermediate region is defined with R between
0.59 and 0.68, while the late-intermediate region is defined with R between 0.797 and 0.865.

Supp. Figure 2: Selected structure variants for each cluster. Representative conformations of the additional
structures selected for each cluster.

24

Supp. Figure 3: ACE2 expression in different cell lines. The expression of ACE2 in the indicated cell lines was
detected by western blotting using an anti-ACE2 antibody (AC18Z).

25

Supp. Figure 4: Lack of ACE2 lowering effects for Chloroquine and analogues. Untransfected Vero cells

exposed to different concentrations of each compound or vehicle for 48 h, were lysed and analyzed by western blotting.
Signals were detected by using relevant primary and secondary antibodies. Images above the graphs are representative
examples of different experiments (n ≥ 3). The graphs show the densitometric quantification of the levels of ACE2 (A).
Each signal was normalized on the corresponding total protein lane (detected by UV) and expressed as the percentage
of the level in vehicle (Vhc)-treated controls. The intrinsic toxicity of each molecule was assessed by MTT assay (B).
Statistically significant differences are indicated by the asterisk (* p < 0.05).

Supplementary Tables

Supp. Table 1: Druggability descriptors of the identified pockets. The table shows the values of the druggability
descriptors computed using SiteMap and DogSiteScorer for the two pockets. The threshold describes the value required
by a descriptor for the definition of a good druggable site.

27

Supp. Table 2: Predicted ligands for pockets 1 and 2 of the ACE2 folding intermediate. The table shows

the different hits emerging from the virtual screening as well as the mefloquine analogues analyzed subsequently. Column
Set indicates whether the molecule was identified by consensus (C), Glide (G) or SeeSAR (S) schemes; while (Q) indicates
the quinoline derivatives. Affinity predictors calculated with the different software are also reported: HYDEaff (LeadIT),
Glideds (Glide), ADLBE and ADNiC (AutoDock).

28

Supp. Table 3: ACE2 expression levels and cytotoxicity for the 35 compounds tested. Individual values

for ACE2 expression are listed above. Each signal was normalized on the corresponding total protein lane (detected by
UV, and allowed by the enhanced tryptophan fluorescence technology of stain-free gels) and expressed as the percentage
of the level in vehicle (Vhc)-treated controls. The colorimetric MTT assay was employed to monitor the intrinsic toxicity
of each compound. Values represent the average of 3-6 independent experiments (depending on observed variability),
and expressed as percentage of Vhc-treated controls. Employed concentrations were chosen based on the solubility of the
compounds.
