Abstract
There remains an urgent need to identify existing drugs that might be suitable for treating
patients suffering from COVID-19 infection. Drugs rarely act at a single molecular target, with
off target effects often being responsible for undesirable side effects and sometimes, beneficial
synergy between targets for a specific illness. Off target activities have also led to blockbuster
drugs in some cases, e.g. Viagra for erectile dysfunction and Minoxidil for male pattern hair loss.
Drugs already in use or in clinical trials plus approved natural products constitute a rich resource
for discovery of therapeutic agents that can be repurposed for existing and new conditions, based
on the rationale that they have already been assessed for safety in man. A key question then is
how to rapidly and efficiently screen such compounds for activity against new pandemic
pathogens such as COVID-19. Here we show how a fast and robust computational process can
be used to screen large libraries of drugs and natural compounds to identify those that may
inhibit the main protease of SARS-Cov-2 (3CL pro, Mpro). We show how the resulting shortlist
of candidates with strongest binding affinities is highly enriched in compounds that have been
independently identified as potential antivirals against COVID-19. The top candidates also
include a substantial number of drugs and natural products not previously identified as having
potential COVID-19 activity, thereby providing additional targets for experimental validation.
This in silico screening pipeline may also be useful for repurposing of existing drugs and
discovery of new drug candidates against other medically important pathogens and for use in
future pandemics.

Introduction
The devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS coronavirus-2 (SARSCoV-2) has stimulated unprecedented international activity to discover effective vaccines and
drugs for this and other pathogenic coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS CoV.1-17
Computational methods offer considerable promise for determining the affinities of small druglike molecules for SARS-Cov-2 protein targets. Recent papers in Science have reported the
application of computational de novo drug design based on the structures of the SARS-Cov-2
protease. 18, 19 Clearly, design of potent new drugs for coronaviruses is very important for future
pandemic preparedness, given that the last three serious epidemics have been caused by
coronaviruses. However, to make an impact on the current COVID-19 pandemic, it is only
feasible to use drugs that are already registered (off label use), have been through at least phase 1
clinical trials to establish initial human safety, or are approved natural products. Any COVID-19
drug candidates identified in this way can then be used very quickly, as their safety and
pharmacokinetics should be already well understood. Drugs that reduce viral replication
primarily by targeting viral proteases and polymerases are classified as direct-acting antivirals
and are the focus of the current work. Other studies have explored host-targeted drugs that
inhibit cellular functions required for viral replication and thereby inhibit SARS-Cov-2 infection,
albeit with more potential for host side effects.20
The SARS-Cov-2 genome encodes > 20 proteins, many of which are potential antiviral
drug targets (Figure 1). Two proteases (PL pro and 3CL pro) are essential for virus replication.
These enzymes cleave the PP1A and PP1AB polyproteins into functional components. 3chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro, aka main protease, Mpro) catalytically self-cleaves a peptide
bond between a glutamine at position P1 and a small amino acid (serine, alanine, or glycine) at

position P1'. This protease corresponds to non-structural protein 5 (nsp5), the main protease in
coronaviruses. 3CL protease is crucial to the processing of the coronavirus replicase polyprotein
(P0C6U8), cleaving it at 11 conserved sites. 3CL protease employs a cys-his catalytic dyad in its
active site where the cysteine sulfur is the nucleophile and the histidine imidazole ring is a
general base. Very recent research has shown that strong Mpro inhibitors can substantially reduce
SARS-Cov-2 virus titres, reduce weight loss and improve survival in mice,21 making Mpro a
promising drug target for structure-based drug discovery.

essential for assembly of the viral replication transcription complex needed for RNA synthesis.

Computational methods can rapidly and efficiently identify candidate drugs for
repurposing in pandemic situations where speed is of utmost importance. Here we used
molecular docking followed by high throughput molecular dynamics simulations to prioritize

from an initial large number of licensed or clinical trial drugs and natural products, a short list of
the most promising candidates. Molecular dynamics calculations were used to predict the
optimal binding poses and binding energies for 84 of the top hits from docking-based virtual
screening to the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Finally, the top candidates were ranked based on binding
affinity and novelty, for COVID-19 repurposing.

Results and discussion
The binding energies of the 84 top ranked ligands from the docking calculations are listed in
Supplementary Table 1. The ten drugs with the tightest binding to Mpro are summarized in Table
1, together with their GMXPBSA binding energies. The calculated binding energy of several of
the antiviral drugs, namely, simeprevir, sofosbuvir, lopinavir, and ritonavir are very similar,
within the uncertainties in calculated energies. Several of the top hits were antivirals identified in
other in silico docking studies or wet-lab SARS-CoV-2 activity studies. This provides a degree
of validation that our computational methods are appropriate and are yielding similar results to
other published studies for some well-studied antiviral drugs. The web site DrugVirus.info
provides a concise picture of the broad-spectrum antiviral activity of a range of drugs; a
summary for four of the antiviral hits from our in silico screens is provided in Figure 2.

Simeprevir was reported to be an inhibitor of the 3CLPro protease by Abhithaj et al.23
They used a pharmacophore search followed by grid-based ligand docking (GLIDE,
Schrodinger) and binding energy estimates from the MMGBSA method of -81.7 kcal/mol.
However, they did not use MD to simulate the interaction of Simeprevir in the 3CLPro binding
site. Similarly, Sofosbuvir was reported to be a strong inhibitor of the protease by Lo et al.24
Using a Vero E6 cellular infection model, they also reported that Simeprevir was the only drug
among their prioritized candidates that suppressed SARS-CoV-2 replication at below 10 μM.
Dose-response studies showed that Simeprevir had an EC50 of 4 μM, and CC50 of 20 μM, similar
to Remdesivir in their experiments.

The potential protease inhibition properties of Lopinavir and Ritonavir were reported by
Bolcato et al., who used supervised MD to calculate the trajectories of the ligands in the protease
binding site.25 Costanzo and colleagues likewise reported high protease binding for these two
antiviral drugs.26 They also reported updates on experimental drugs successfully employed in the
treatment of the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Patient recovery has been reported
after treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir (used to treat HIV infection) in combination with the antiflu drug oseltamivir. Muralidharan et al. also used AutoDock (another docking program similar
to Vina produced by the Scripps group) followed by MD simulations using the Generalised
Amber Force Field (GAFF) in Amber16 to screen for repurposed drugs27 They reported
AutoDock binding energies for lopinavir, oseltamivir and ritonavir of −4.1 kcal/mol,
−4.65 kcal/mol, −5.11 kcal/mol, respectively but did not provide the binding energies from the
MD calculations. The best-known antiviral drug, which has been the subject of several clinical
trials for COVID-19, is Remdesivir.28 The potential inhibition of the protease by this drug has
been reported by several computational screening studies. For example, Al-Khafaji and

colleagues reported a combined computational docking and MD study of a range of antiviral
drugs to the viral protease.29 They calculated a binding energy for remdesivir of −65.19 kcal/mol
from a GROMACS simulation and a MMGBSA binding energy calculation. Beck et al. reported a
Kd for binding of remdesivir to 3CLPro of 113 nM using a deep learning model. Liu et al
reported an in vitro assay that exploited the pronounced cytopathic effects of SAR-Cov-2 on
Vero cells and the ability of a range of antiviral drugs to protect cells against the virus.30 In their
assay, Remdesivir exhibited an IC50 of 2.5µM and CC50 of 175µM, while Sofosbuvir, Lopinavir
and Ritonavir were inactive. Similarly, Ma et al. reported a fluorescence resonance energy
transfer (FRET)- based enzymatic assay for the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and applied it to screening a
library of protease inhibitors.31 In their assay, Simeprivir exhibited an IC50 of 14±3 µM.
The most interesting potential protease inhibitors from our study are the ergot alkaloids
ergotamine, mergocriptine, the thrombopoietin receptor agonist eltrombopag (ranked 13 with
ΔGMMPBSA=–28.2 kcal/mol, see Supplementary Table 1), bemcentinib, PC786, and montelukast.
These drugs were predicted to have better binding energies than the antiviral drugs discussed
above and have a higher degree of novelty.
Ergot drugs
Gurung et al. reported potential binding of ergotamine to the SAR-Cov-2 main protease in a
preprint.32 The employed AutoDock Vina but without subsequent MD simulation of the
complex. They reported the binding energy as −9.4 kcal/mol for dihydroergotamine and -9.3
kcal/mol for ergotamine. Mevada et al. also reported the in-silico estimates of the binding of
ergotamine to the protease using AutoDock Vina for the virtual screening.33 They found the
drug bound with an energy of -10.2 kcal/mol, calculated using Vina (no subsequent MD
simulation). Gul et al. used a similar docking approach, this time with MD simulation, and

identified ergotamine and its derivatives dihydroergotamine and bromocriptine to have high
binding affinity to SARS-Cov-2 3CLpro. Ergotamine is an alpha-1 selective adrenergic agonist
and vasoconstrictor that had a high docking binding energy against SARS-Cov-2 Mpro of -8.6
kcal/mol. Dihydroergotamine, the 9,10-alpha-dihydro derivative of ergotamine, showed similar
high affinity of -8.6 kcal/mol and bromocryptine -9.2 kcal/mol. Ergotamine has also been
predicted to bind tightly to the SARS-Cov-2 spike (S) protein.34 Figure 3 shows a LigPlot
representation of the interactions of key functional groups in ergotamine and mergocriptine with
protease active site residues. These are also listed in Supplementary Table 2 for reference.

Figure 3. LigPlot (left) and hydrophobic protein surface representation (right) of the main
interactions between Mpro and ergotamine (top) and mergocriptine (bottom).

Montelukast
Montelukast is a cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist used treat asthma and allergic rhinitis.
It reduces pulmonary responses to antigen, tissue eosinophilia and IL-5 expression in
inflammatory cells and decreases elevated levels of IL-1β and IL8 in viral upper respiratory tract
infections.35 Several computational have suggested putative binding to the terminal site of Mpro.
Montelukast has been shown to inhibit at least one other protease, eosinophil protease.36
Mansoor and colleagues proposed that it could bind to Mpro on the basis of a simple
molecular docking study.37 Wu et al also reported putative binding of montelukast to Mpro in a
computational study using the same Internal Coordinate Mechanics modelling methods.38 No
accurate binding affinities were reported in either study. Figure 4 shows a LigPlot representation
of the interactions of key functional groups in montelukast with protease active site residues.
These are also listed in Supplementary Table 2 for reference.

Figure 4. LigPlot (left) and hydrophobic protein surface representation (right) of the main
interactions between Mpro and montelukast.

Bemcentinib
Bemcentinib selectively inhibits AXL kinase activity, which blocks viral entry and enhances the
antiviral type I interferon response. It’s in vitro activity against SARS-Cov-2 has been assessed by
several groups. In a Vero cell assay, Liu et al reported 10-40% protection at 50µM.30 However, in
an alternative assay using human Huh7.5 cells,39 Bemcentinib exhibited an IC50 of 100nM and
CC50 of 4.7µM. They also developed an assay in Vero cells and reported the IC50 was 470nM and
CC50 was 1.6µM, considerably higher activity than that reported by Liu et al. As a result it is an
investigational treatment for COVID-19 (www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu). Figure 5 shows a LigPlot
representation of the interactions of key functional groups in bemcentinib with protease active site
residues. These are also listed in Supplementary Table 2 for reference.

Figure 5. LigPlot (left) and hydrophobic protein surface representation (right) of the main
interactions between Mpro and bemcentinib.

PC786
PC786 targets the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) L protein and is designed to be a topical
inhalation treatment. There is very little published work on the SAR-Cov-2 efficacy or predicting
binding affinity to Mpro. Panda and coworkers reported a binding energy ΔGbind of PC786 of
−179.79, tighter binding than calculated for lopinavir (−131.49 kJ/mol), using a combined docking
and MD approach.40 Like our study, they employed Autodock Vina to dock a molecular library
into the active site of Mpro, followed by MD simulation using GROMACS. Figure 6 shows a
LigPlot representation of the interactions of key functional groups in PC786 with protease active
site residues. These are also listed in Supplementary Table 2 for reference.

Figure 6. LigPlot (left) and hydrophobic protein surface representation (right) of the main
interactions between Mpro and PC786.

Other novel putative Mpro inhibitors from the short list of 84 drugs
The predicted binding energies of the 84 drugs in the short list are summarized in Supplementary
Table 1. We have also reviewed the literature for other in silico studies that have also identified
some of these hit compounds as potential Mpro inhibitors and have listed experimental in vitro
and in vivo results and clinical trials in progress for drugs on the list. Two thirds of the drugs on
the list have been reported to be potential inhibitors of SARS-Cov-2 target proteins, largely Mpro
but also RdRp, spike, helicase, human ACE2, 2’-O-methyltransferase nsp16/nsp10 complex,
nsp1, PLpro, nsp3, and nsp12. Satisfyingly, those with the best predicted binding affinity from our
study have also been of greatest interest clinically, with more in vitro assay results and clinical
trials for drugs with the highest binding affinities. This suggests that our screening and MD
simulation methods are sufficiently robust and accurate to identify drugs for repurposing against
SARS-Cov-2 and, more broadly, other coronaviruses. The 33% of drugs in the hit list that have

no reported studies are therefore also of interest as novel drugs for COVID-19. We discuss some
of the more interesting and novel hit compounds with higher binding affinities.
Eltrombopag
Eltrombopag is a TPO agonist that acts at the transmembrane domain of its cognate receptor CMpl via a histidine residue that occurs only in humans and apes. It scored highly in the docking
studies, suggesting it could inhibit the 3CL protease and exhibit antiviral activity. Several other
in silico screening studies also identified eltrombopag as a potential SARS-Cov-2 drug. Feng et
al.’s studies suggested that eltrombopag bound not only to 3CL active site but also to the viral Sprotein and to human ACE2.41 This potential synergistic polypharmacy could be particularly
beneficial.
Very little has been reported on the direct antiviral activity of eltrombopag. Recently,
Vogel et al. reported direct inhibition of cytomegalovirus (CMV) by therapeutic doses of
eltrombopag used to treat thrombocytopenia. 42 They showed that eltrombopag inhibits the late
stages of the HCMV replication cycle and reduces virus titres by 1.8 × 104-fold at 10µM and by
15-fold at 500 nM. They suggested the mode of action was iron chelation and showed that
eltrombopag was synergistic with ganciclovir in preventing viral replication.
Eltrombopag has also been proposed as a potential drug against SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein on the basis of predicted strong binding to a pocket in the fusion cores of S2 domain.41
Eltrombopag was also identified as a high binding affinity to human angiotensin converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2), the primary binding site for the spike protein. Their virtual screen also used
Autodock Vina, but no subsequent MD simulation was used for the top hit compounds from the
screen. SPR was used to assess the binding of the drug to Mpro. Figure 7 shows a LigPlot

representation of the interactions of key functional groups in eltrombopag with protease active
site residues. These are also listed in Supplementary Table 2 for reference.

Figure 7. LigPlot (left) and hydrophobic Mpro protein surface representation (right) of the main
interactions between Mpro and eltrombopag and Mpro.

Eltrombopag is of particular interest as a Mpro inhibitor lead because it is novel and is also
a member of a large class of small molecular TPO receptor agonists that may also exhibit activity
against the viral protease, and potentially the spike protein and human ACE2.43. However, given
the clotting disorders that SAR-Cov-2 generates, the TPOR agonist activities would need to be
minimized to prevent platelet enhancement, while retaining or enhancing the antiviral activities.
Apart from the drugs discussed above, several other drugs in the list in Supplementary Table
1 are of interest. There are several other ergot derivatives with good predicted binding affinities
to Mpro. Metergotamine and dihydroergocristine were predicted to have DGbind of –29 and –24

kcal/mol respectively. Other drugs with binding energies stronger than –25 kcal/mol include
galicaftor (clinical trial for cystic fibrosis), rolitetracycline (broad spectrum antibiotic), disogluside
(natural product from Dioscorea nipponica Makino that reduces liver chronic inflammation and
fibrosis), zafirlukast (leukotriene receptor antagonist for asthma), diosmin (a natural flavone for
treating venous disease), AZD-5991 (clinical trial

for relapsed or refractory haematologic

malignancies), and ruzasvir (clinical trials for treatment of hepatitis C).
Li et al. has reported predicted Mpro binding for galicaftor.44 The protease binding of
rolitetracycline has been reported by Durdagi et al. and Gul et al.45, 46 Zhu and corkers measured
the SARs-Cov-2 and Mpro inhibition of zafirlukast.47 The IC50 for Mpro was 24 µM and the EC50
for the virus >20µM. The potential of the natural product diosmin as an antiviral agent targeting
Mpro has also been reported in several recent computational studies.48-51 Chakraborti et al. reported
the potential of ruzasvir as a drug against SARS-Cov-2, although no data were provided.52 These
drugs and natural products merit assessment in SAR-Cov-2 assays and Mpro inhibition
experiments.

Conclusions
Our virtual screening approach that applies Autodock Vina and MD simulation in tandem to
calculate binding energies for repurposed drugs has identified 84 promising compounds for
treating SARS-Cov2 infections. The screening was applied against the viral main protease Mpro
(3CLpro). The top hits from out study consisted of a mixture of antiviral agents , natural products
and drugs that were developed for other applications and that have other models of action. The
prognostic value of our computational approach has been demonstrated by the fact that it identified
a diverse range of drugs that have been reported in other computational studies or that exhibit

useful SARS-Cov-2 antiviral effects in vitro. The antiviral drugs simeprevir, sofosbuvir, lopinavir,
ritonavir and remdesivir exhibit strong antiviral properties and several in in clinical trial or use
against SARS-Cov-2. These drugs have been identified as binding to Mpro also by numerous virtual
screening studies and by in vitro assays. The more interesting and least studied lead drugs amongst
our candidate list, bemcentinib, PC786, montelukast, ergotamine and mergocriptine, were
predicted to have binding affinities equal to or greater than the antiviral drugs, and have also been
shown to have in vitro antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. A few computational studies mostly
using less rigorous methods than those we employed here, have also suggested that these drugs
may bind to Mpro.
This high validation success rate strongly suggests that this type of virtual screening
approach is capable of identifying compounds with potentially useful activity against SARS-CoV2 and, by analogy, other coronaviruses. In particular, the 28 drugs for which no SARS-CoV-2
activity has been yet reported may be of particular interest for in vitro screening. The results of the
current drug repurposing study provides information that could be useful to identify additional
candidate drugs for testing for use in the current pandemic, as well as a rational computational
paradigm for identifying therapeutic agents for future viral pandemics.

required files for Autodock Vina by assigning hydrogen polarities, calculating Gasteiger charges
to protein structures and converting protein structures from the .pdb file format to .pdbqt format.54.
The surface area of the 3CLPro binding pocket is 335 Å2, volume – 364.101 Å3.55
Screening databases
Drugs database were downloaded from the DrugBank database (Wishart et al., 2018) and
CHEMBL database (FDA approved) (Gaulton et al., 2017). A total of 8773 and 13,308 drugs were
retrieved from Drugbank and CHEMBL database, respectively. The drugs were downloaded in sdf
format and converted to .pdbqt format using Raccoon (Forli et al., 2016).

Docking Methodology
Small molecule ligand structures were docked against protein structure using the AutoDock Vina
(version 1.1.3) package.54 AutoDock Vina employs gradient-based conformational search
approach and an energy-based empirical scoring function. AutoDock Vina is also flexible, easily
scripted, extensively validated in many published studies with a variety of proteins and ligands
and takes advantage of large multi-CPU or -GPU machines to run many calculations in parallel.
The code has also been employed very successfully to dock millions of small molecule drug
candidates into a series of protein targets to discover new potent drug leads. The package includes
useful scripts for generating modified .pdb files required for grid calculations and for setting up
the grid calculations around each protein automatically. The software requires the removal of
hydrogens, addition of polar hydrogens, setting of the correct atom types, and calculation of atom
charges compatible with the AutoGrid code. The algorithm generates a grid around each protein
and calculates the interaction energy of a probe noble gas atom at each grid position outside and
within internal cavities of the protein. The grid resolution was set to 1 Å, the maximum number of
binding modes to output was fixed at 10, and the exhaustiveness level (controlling the number of
independent runs performed) was set at 8. The docking employed a genetic algorithm to optimize
the binding conformations of the ligands during docking to the protease site. Drugs were docked
individually to the active site of Mpro (3CLPro, refcode 6Y2F) with the grid coordinates (grid
centre) and grid boxes of appropriate sizes generated by the bash script vina_screen.sh
(Supplementary Information). The top scored compounds were identified with a python script
script1.py (Supplementary Information) and subjected to molecular dynamic simulation. The
docked structures were analysed using UCSF Chimera

53

and LigPlot+ software56 to illustrate

hydrogen-bond and hydrophobic interactions. A total of fifty top compounds selected from each

of the Drugbank and CHEMBL compounds. Sixteen compounds were common to both database
top hits. Molecular dynamics studies were conducted on the unique set of eighty-four compounds
from both sets.
Molecular Dynamics Simulation
The top screened compound complexes with protease were minimized with CHARMm force field.
The topology files of the ligands were prepared from Swissparam (http://www.swissparam.ch/) 57
and minimized in Gromacs2020 (http://www.gromacs.org/).58. Docked complexes of ligands and
COVID-19 Mpro protein were used as starting geometries for MD simulations. Simulations were
carried out using the GPU accelerated version of the program with the CHARMm force field I
periodic boundary conditions in ORACLE server. Docked complexes were immersed in a
truncated octahedron box of TIP3P water molecules. The solvated box was further neutralized with
Na+ or Cl− counter ions using the tleap program. Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) was employed to
calculate the long-range electrostatic interactions. The cut-off distance for the long-range van der
Waals (VDW) energy term was 12.0 Å. The whole system was minimized without any restraint.
The above steps applied 2500 cycles of steepest descent minimization followed by 5000 cycles of
conjugate gradient minimization. After system optimization, the MD simulations was initiated by
gradually heating each system in the NVT ensemble from 0 to 300 K for 50 ps using a Langevin
thermostat with a coupling coefficient of 1.0/ps and with a force constant of 2.0 kcal/mol·Å2 on
the complex. Finally, a production run of 20 ns of MD simulation was performed under a constant
temperature of 300 K in the NPT ensemble with periodic boundary conditions for each system.
During the MD procedure, the SHAKE algorithm was applied for the constraint of all covalent
bonds involving hydrogen atoms. The time step was set to 2 fs. The structural stability of the
complex was monitored by the RMSD and RMSF values of the backbone atoms of the entire

protein. Calculations were also performed for up to 100 ns on few compounds to ensure that 20ns
is sufficiently long for convergence. Duplicate production runs starting with different random
seeds were also run to allow estimates of binding energy uncertainties to be determined.
The binding free energies of the protein‐protein complexes were evaluated in two ways.
The traditional method is to calculate the energies of solvated SARS-Cov-2 protease and small
molecule ligands and that of the bound complex and derive the binding energy by subtraction.
ΔG (binding, aq) = ΔG (complex, aq) – (ΔG (protein, aq) + ΔG (ligand, aq)

(1)

We also calculated binding energies using the molecular mechanics Poisson Boltzmann surface
area (MM/PBSA) tool in GROMACS that is derived from the nonbonded interaction energies of
the complex. The method is also widely used method for binding free energy calculations.
MMPBSA calculations were conducted by GMXPBSA 2.159 a suite based on Bash/Perl
scripts for streamlining MM/PBSA calculations on structural ensembles derived from GROMACS
trajectories and to automatically calculate binding free energies for protein–protein or ligand–
protein. GMXPBSA 2.1 calculates diverse MM/PBSA energy contributions from molecular
mechanics (MM) and electrostatic contribution to solvation (PB) and non-polar contribution to
solvation (SA). This tool combines the capability of MD simulations (GROMACS) and the
Poisson–Boltzmann equation (APBS) for calculating solvation energy (Baker et., 2001). The
g_mmpbsa tool in GROMACS was used after molecular dynamics simulations, the output files
obtained were used to post-process binding free energies by the single-trajectory MMPBSA
method. In the current study we considered 100 frames at equal distance from 20ns trajectory files.
Specifically, for a non-covalent binding interaction in the aqueous phase the binding free
energy, ΔG (bind,aq), is: –

ΔG (bind,aqu) = ΔG (bind,vac) + ΔG (bind,solv)

(2)

where ΔG (bind,vac) is the binding free energy in vacuum, and ΔG(bind,solv) is the solvation free
energy change upon binding: –
ΔG (bind,solv) = ΔG (R:L, solv) - ΔG (R,solv) - ΔG (L,solv)

(3)

where ΔG (R:L,solv), ΔG (R,solv) and ΔG (L,solv) are solvation free energies of complex,
receptor and ligand, respectively.
While this manuscript was in preparation, Guterres and Im showed how substantial improvement
in protein-ligand docking results could be achieved using high-throughput MD simulations.60 As
with our study, they also employed AutoDock Vina for docking, followed by MD simulation using
CHARMM. The MD parameters they advocated were very similar to those used in our study.
Proteins were solvated in a box of TIP3P water molecules extending 10 Å beyond the proteins and
the particle-mesh Ewald method was used for electrostatic interactions. Nonbonded interactions
over 10 and 12 Å were truncated. Their systems were minimized for 5000 steps using the steepest
descent method followed by 1 ns equilibration with an NVT setting. For each protein-ligand
complex, they ran 3 × 100 ns production runs from the same initial structure using different initial
velocity random seeds and an integration step size of 2 fs. Over 56 protein targets (of 7 different
protein classes) and 560 ligands this show 22% improvement in the area under receiver operating
characteristics curve, from an initial value of 0.68 using AutoDock Vina alone to a final value of
0.83 when the Vina results were refined by MD.
