ABSTRACT
Covid-19 has been causing severe loss to the human race. Considering the mode
of spread and severity, it is essential to make it a habit to follow various safety
precautions such as using sanitizers and masks and maintaining social distancing to
prevent the spread of Covid-19. Individuals are widely educated about the safety
measures against the disease through various modes such as announcements through
online or physical awareness campaigns, advertisements in the media and so on.
The younger generations today spend considerably more time on mobile phones and
games. However, there are very few applications or games aimed to help in practicing
safety measures against a pandemic, which is much lesser in the case of Covid-19.
Hence, we propose a 2D survival-based game, SurviveCovid-19, aimed to educate people about safety precautions to be taken for Covid-19 outside their homes
by incorporating social distancing and usage of masks and sanitizers in the game.
SurviveCovid-19 has been designed as an Android-based mobile game, along with
a desktop (browser) version, and has been evaluated through a remote quantitative user survey, with 30 volunteers using the questionnaire based on the MEEGA+
model. The survey results are promising, with all the survey questions having a
mean value greater than 3.5. The game’s quality factor was 69.3, indicating that the
game could be classified as excellent quality, according to the MEEGA+ model.

1. Introduction
Several pandemics have proved to be a risk to people across the globe during many
instances. The important lessons learned from pandemics witnessed by the world, such
as Cholera (Colwell, 1996; Mutreja et al., 2011), H1N1 (Xu et al., 2010), Smallpox
(Cunha, 2004; Li et al., 2007), Ebola (Richardson et al., 2016) and so on (Hays, 2005)
is the role of awareness campaigns and practice of safety measures. It has been observed that public awareness campaigns reduce the severity of the outcomes of disease,
including hospitalization and death (Mytton, Rutter, & Donaldson, 2012). Several governments across the world and researchers have highlighted the need to improve public
health education campaigns aimed towards improving health literacy among the people (Eastwood, Durrheim, Butler, & Jones, 2010). Health professionals across various
nations have been advised to practice several control activities, including basic san-

itation facilities, identify and isolate suspected cases and educate the general public
through awareness campaigns (Sepulveda, Valdespino, & Garcia-Garcia, 2006). Along
with the medical care required, all individuals worldwide must be aware of and follow
safety precautions to control the pandemic (Lacitignola & Saccomandi, 2021).
A severe outbreak of pneumonia caused by SARS-Cov-2, Covid-19 (Ciotti et al.,
2019) has spread rapidly, affecting more than 2.76 million people, spread across several
countries of the world, as reported by WHO as of 28 March, 20211 . It spreads on a
large scale, in a short span of time, ranging from 110.7 million cases2 as of 23 February
2021 to 126.3 million cases as of 28 March 2021, affecting more than 15.6 million
people in a span of one month (from 23 February 2021 to 28 March 2021). Symptoms
of Covid-19 include fever, cough, dyspnoea, lymphocytopenia, fatigue (Zhou et al.,
2020), (Yuki, Fujiogi, & Koutsogiannaki, 2020), that weakens the immune system
and increases complications in a few cases, leading to heart failures, kidney failures,
respiratory failures, nervous system and mental health (Zhou et al., 2020)(Zheng, Ma,
Zhang, & Xie, 2020) (H.-Y. Wang et al., 2020)(Bouaziz et al., 2020) (Hao et al., 2020).
The number of deaths caused due to Covid-19 have increased from 2.45M to 2.76M
during 23 February 2021 to 28 March 2021 3 . Several measures to control the Covid19 pandemic are being taken by WHO and various nations across the world (Sohrabi
et al., 2020) (GÜNER, Hasanoğlu, & Aktaş, 2020; Nussbaumer-Streit et al., 2020;
Rozhnova et al., 2021). These measures include expediting the diagnosis and contact
tracing process, increasing health care facilities and scaling up health care equipment,
encouraging the process of discovering drugs to treat Covid-19 and bringing awareness
among the public4 . Vaccines are being developed to prevent the contraction of Covid19, and ways to administer and educate about these vaccines to a wider population
are being explored (Burgess et al., 2021; Forni & Mantovani, 2021).
Public Awareness programs about Covid-19 are being carried out in various ways
across the globe. The public is being educated and repeatedly reminded of safety
measures to be followed through telephonic and television advertisements, physical and
online campaigns, flyer displays at public places, and many online websites, schools
and so on (Rozhnova et al., 2021). Several websites dedicated to Covid-19 are being
developed, to provide information about precautions to be taken and the status of
Covid-19 (Venigalla, Chimalakonda, & Vagavolu, 2020). In many countries across the
world, lockdown instructions are eased, and their citizens are allowed to come outdoors.
It is essential to follow safety precautions when people are in public places. Today, the
younger generation spends a lot of time with their mobile phones and desktops on
various apps and games (Chan, Kow, & Cheng, 2017). Also, it has been observed that
games can affect players’ behaviour and attitude and contribute to better learning
(Orji, Vassileva, & Mandryk, 2013)(Chen, Zhang, Qi, & Yang, 2020)(Y.-H. Wang,
2020).
Despite the large-scale public health awareness programs being carried out, we are
not aware of any mobile games aimed to educate people about the safety measures to
be taken against Covid-19 and help people to make a habit of following them. Thus, we
propose SurviveCovid-19 5 , a survival theme-based 2D mobile and desktop (browser)
game, to educate users about various safety measures to be followed against Covid-19

2. Related Work
Bringing out awareness among public with respect to various diseases plays a primary
role in keeping people healthy. With the increase in use of mobile and web applications,
several health care mobile apps and websites are being developed.
2.1. Mobile Apps for Health Literacy
Mobile apps to support prevention of various diseases such as obesity, cardiovascular
diseases, chronic diseases such as skin cancer and so on have been developed (Brinker
et al., 2018)(Sindi et al., 2015)(Kong & Tan, 2012)(Matsumura & Yamakoshi, 2013).
Brinker et al., have presented a facial-aging mobile app, SunFace, aimed to prevent
skin cancer (Brinker et al., 2018). SunFace encourages users to click a selfie and view
changes induced due to 5 and 25 years of skin aging with and without sun protection. It also provides information about most commonly caused skin cancers due to
UV rays and displays odds ratio of skin cancer based on various behaviors (Brinker
et al., 2018). A study conducted to evaluate SunFace app with around 350 Brazilian
secondary school students has shown increased considerations for UV protective behaviours (Brinker et al., 2018)(Brinker et al., 2017). CAIDE Dementia Risk Score App
has been developed by Sindi et al. to predict risk of dementia based on the profile of
individuals (Sindi et al., 2015). It also provides guidance to individuals to reduce the
risk of dementia. The “medical history, health status and current health behaviour” of
individuals is taken as input, through a questionnaire and risk score is calculated based
on this information. It also provides a platform for medical practitioners to monitor
risk of dementia of an individual and provide necessary guidance (Sindi et al., 2015).
Kong et al. have developed DietCam, a mobile phone based application that aims
to reduce obesity (Kong & Tan, 2012). It assesses the food intake of users based on
three images, clicked from three different perspectives, or a short video of the food
being consumed. The type of food in the image or video is classified by comparing
result of feature matching with different types of food stored in food and nutrition
database. The volume of the food is identified through geometry calibration and 3D
3

reconstruction. An estimation of number of calories being consumed based on the
type of food and volume generated, is presented to the users, which helps them in
assessing the calorie intake, and consequently manage their diet (Kong & Tan, 2012).
Studies also reveal that more than 70% of users, using weight loss reduction mobile
applications show successful weight reduction (Chin et al., 2016). These studies thus
imply the positive outcomes of using mobile applications in health care. iPhysioMeter
has been proposed as a smartphone program (on iPhone 4 , 4S and 5) to measure heart
rate (HR) and normalized pulse volume(NPV) (Matsumura & Yamakoshi, 2013). The
HR and NPV values are calculated by the program when users tap on the iPhone
home screen and cover the flash LED and CMOS camera with their left index finger.
The results of measurements are sent to the users’ email (Matsumura & Yamakoshi,
2013).
2.2. Games for Healthcare
Several mobile games have also been developed to promote self health monitoring for various diseases (Birn, Holzmann, & Stech, 2014)(Park, Koo, Cho, & Bae,
2015)(Baghaei, Nandigam, Casey, Direito, & Maddison, 2016)(Bin Hussein et al.,
2019). MobileQuiz has been developed as a mobile game, to promote both physical and cognitive skill among older adults and is to be played outdoors (Birn et al.,
2014). It assigns tasks to users in view of the physical distance and direction to be
covered by the user, which when accomplished, users are rewarded with points and are
provided with a questionnaire related to the location or surrounding regions (Birn et
al., 2014). Park et al. have proposed SnackBeaker, a mobile game, aimed to promote
healthy food choices among the players (Park et al., 2015). It presents a quiz that can
be answered based on elimination of one among two choices, in terms of nutritional
values provided by the two alternatives, thus educating users about the nutritional
value of different snacks and consequently helping them choose snacks with high nutritional values (Park et al., 2015). A mario style based mobile game, Diabetic mario,
was introduced to help in understanding ways to manage diabetes (Baghaei et al.,
2016). The player is assigned with the task of managing blood sugar level of Diabetic
Mario by selectively choosing the food items provided in the game console and eventually save the princess (Baghaei et al., 2016). Considering the importance of Automated
External Defibrillators(AED) in cases of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests, a crowdsource
based mobile game has been designed to make users vary of AED locations and also
to motivate them to report condition of AEDs (Bin Hussein et al., 2019).
2.3. Web-based Applications for Awareness during Pandemic
Considering the importance of public awareness towards a pandemic and the importance of research in view of planning and response to curb the pandemic, few online
websites and telephonic lines have also been developed. ISIS has been developed as
a web framework to help in planning and response against pandemics by analyzing
multiple simulations of possible interventions, including “administering a vaccine to a
part of population, using antivirals as treatment, closing schools and work places and
instituting social distancing” (Beckman et al., 2014). WHO also lists out various safety
measures on the WHO website to enable public awareness during pandemics. Few web
based applications and websites are also being developed to help in tracking Covid-19
reported cases and in bringing public awareness towards Covid-19. Dong et al have de4

veloped web-based dashboard that displays visualizations of Covid-19 reported cases
from time to time (Dong, Du, & Gardner, 2020). It “reports cases of the Covid-19
pandemic at level of cities in USA, Australia and Canada, province level in China
and country level in other cases” (Dong et al., 2020). Few governments across the
world have also promoted use of various mobile based applications6789 that are aimed
to bring awareness among people about risks, best practices and relevant advisories
regarding Covid-19.
Considering the positive impact of mobile and desktop games and apps (Orji et
al., 2013) in the area of health care and the proven usefulness in bringing awareness
about various diseases and inculcating healthy habits through mobile games and apps,
designing games to help in public awareness in the context of Covid-19 pandemic
could be useful. However, inspite of the availability of mobile and web applications
towards containment of Covid-19, we are not aware of any mobile or desktop games
that promote inculcating the habit of following safety measures with respect to Covid19. Hence, we present SurviveCovid-19, a survival based 2D game, aimed to educate
users and help in practicing various safety measures to be followed against Covid-19
pandemic.
3. Design
Multiple studies in the literature propose various ways to improve effectiveness and
simplify development of serious games for educational purposes, which included sets
of guidelines based on the target audience for the games (Manuel, José, Manuel, Iván,
& Baltasar, 2019; Valenza, da Silva Hounsell, & Gasparini, 2019; Westera, 2019). The
guidelines presented in (Westera, 2019) were observed to be more closely related to
the goals of SurviveCovid-19, such as motivation and reduced cognitive load.
SurviveCovid-19 has thus been designed keeping in mind the desirable factors for
effectiveness of serious games for better learning outcomes, such as better motivation
and reduced cognitive load, as suggested in (Westera, 2019). This is an educational
game that helps people in understanding the importance of masks and sanitizers and
following the safety measures to keep themselves and people in their surroundings safe
from Covid-19. This game is inspired by a simple pixel-based top-down style design
where people navigate the city with safety and health measures.
The game begins by showing a landing screen. As the game starts, the player sees a
short video depicting a simple story-line of a person who needs to get essential items
from the city during lock down for his family while following proper health measures
and avoid spreading the virus. The scenes displayed in the game are designed to be
appealing to the users, and also resemble real-life scenarios, thus meeting the styling
criteria and reducing cognitive load, as mentioned in (Westera, 2019). The video is
then followed by a screen showing the specific instructions to complete the game. The
goal of the player is to collect the allotted number of groceries and medicines while
navigating the city. While doing so, the player also has to make use of face masks
and sanitizers to avoid getting infected or infecting other people. To make the game
challenging and fun for the players, both of these utilities have been given a timer.
The player has to make use of them strategically to win. The game finishes when the

player collects all the required items and reaches home, as shown on the map.
The game also keeps in check the number of people getting affected because of the
user’s action in terms of people being infected directly and indirectly. This prompts the
player to tread the path with caution and by taking proper health measures throughout
the game. The game rewards the player with safety shield when masks or sanitizers
are used with-in the game, thus motivating the players to make use of these elements.

4. Development
We have developed SurviveCovid, as an motivational and educational game to learn
the importance of, and to follow proper health measures against Covid-19 using the
Unity 3D game engine10 . We followed a step by step approach to develop the game
as shown in Figure 2. We then used the Android SDK module provided by Unity to
export the game for android based mobile devices.
We have used 2d tiles from the standard assets pack provided by Unity to define
most of the game objects. The rest have been created using Photoshop software. The
tiles are first imported into Unity and then using the tile-map feature of Unity, we
design the game. In this way, the map of the city in which the player has to navigate is
created. A mask and a sanitizer object are created and have been placed at strategic
positions on the map. These utilities are meant to help the player to complete the
level.
All the events in the game are controlled using scripts written in C# programming
language. A mechanism to simulate the spread of disease through touch has been
implemented using C# scripts. This spread can be prevented by taking appropriate
measures like using the mask and the sanitizer.
Many obstacles, such as infected people and monsters which spread the virus on
touch, are placed on the map. The people are positioned such that they mimic real

crowds and queues of people.
A single script keeps track of the groceries and medicine that have been collected
by the player. A Quota is assigned to the player automatically to collect groceries and
medicine. Only on completing the assigned quota, the player may cross the finish line.
All the media, such as videos and photos in the game, are made using Windows
Video Maker and Photoshop softwares.

5. User Scenario
Consider Moksha, an individual staying indoors due to lockdown instructions in her
locality, interested to play games and to gain awareness against Covid-19. She considers
playing SurviveCovid-19, to pass her time and also to be habituated to follow safety
measures when in outdoors. She downloads SurviveCovid-19 on her Android mobile
and starts the game. She is displayed with a start screen, with options - Start, About
and Exit as shown in Figure 3. She selects to start the game by clicking on [A] of Figure
3. She is then displayed with a short video that describes the lockdown situation of a
person, who is required to go outdoors to get daily essentials and medicine. Moksha
can also choose to skip the video and directly navigate to the game by clicking on
Press here to Continue ([B] of Figure 4), A snapshot of the video is shown in [A] of
Figure 4. Information about various game elements is also displayed as a part of the

video, as shown in [C] of Figure 4. Moksha is then presented with Instructions screen
containing instructions to be followed as shown in [A] of Figure 5, a map depicting
layout of the city, shown in [B] Figure 5, options to continue and exit, as shown in [C]
and [D] of Figure 5 respectively. She clicks on Continue ([C] of Figure 5) and starts
the game.
Moksha is then displayed with the number of Groceries and Medicines to be collected
as shown in [G] of Figure 6 The number of groceries and medicines collected versus
the goal to be collected are displayed in [G] of Figure 6. [A] of Figure 6 depicts lifeline
of the player, while the score is displayed to the top right, as shown in [H] of Figure
6. The player can move around in the city using the controls depicted in [E] and [F]
of Figure 6. In cases where the player is infected with virus and gets in contact with
other individuals in the game, the player infects those individuals as shown in [C] of
Figure 6. When these infected individuals move around the city, they also infect other
healthy individuals. The total number of individuals infected by the player directly
and indirectly is represented in [D] of Figure 6. She starts moving around the city to
collect required essentials. Considering the safety precautions, not to be affected by the
virus, she collects the mask and sanitizer wherever available. The lifeline of existence
of sanitizer is displayed below the player’s lifeline, as depicted in [A] of Figure 7. [B] of
Figure 7 indicates virus not being able to harm player in the presence of sanitizer. The
lifeline of mask is depicted in [C] of Figure 7 and [D] indicates the mask protecting
player from the virus. Score of the player increases on collecting elements displayed
in [E] of Figure 8. Player contracts the virus in absence of mask or sanitizer, thus
resulting in declining lifeline of the player. Moksha then visits a doctor as shown in
[A] of Figure 8, to get cured and revive player’s lifeline. Once all the groceries and
medicine are collected, player reaches home, as shown in [B] of Figure 8.

6. Evaluation
SurviveCovid-19 has been developed to educate about, and motivate public to follow
safety measures to be taken to control Covid-19 pandemic, as an Android and Web
based mobile game. Though we could not find games developed to support public
health awareness towards pandemics, several health care-related and learning-oriented
games have been evaluated based on similar factors such as learning outcomes, usability, motivation, user experience, usefulness and so on, based on different evaluation
models such as TAM, MEEGA+ and so on.
Among the existing evaluation models, we see that MEEGA+ has been commonly

9

used to evaluate educational games (Santos, Carvalho, Costa, Viana, & Rivero, 2019;
?), as it considers desired factors such as fun, challenge, learnability, operability and
so on, thus including both player experience and usability. As these factors are also
relevant for the evaluation of SurviveCovid-19, we adapt MEEGA+ for evaluating
the game. However, as SurviveCovid-19 aims to influence players to follow safety
precautions against Covid-19, we also evaluate its influence on players towards making
a habit to follow the safety measures. Also, we design SurviveCovid-19 based on the
suggestions in (Westera, 2019), to make it more effective for learning. Thus, we evaluate
SurviveCovid-19 based on the factors - intrinsic motivation and reduced cognitive load.
Hence, we design the questionnaire based on an amalgamation of the factors discussed
above. The factors considered for evaluation are as follows:
• Influence/Impact (I)
• In-game Safety Precautions (SP)
• Motivation
◦ Competence (C)
◦ Autonomy (A)
◦ Style Elements (SE)
◦ Rewards (RW)
• Reduced Cognitive Load (RCL)
• Player Experience
◦ Focused Attention (FA)
◦ Satisfaction (S)
◦ Relevance (R)
◦ Fun (F)
◦ Challenge (Ch)
• Usability
◦ Learnability (L)
◦ Operability (O)
◦ Aesthetics (As)
◦ Accessibility (Acc)
The current version of SurviveCovid-19 is a single-player game, targeted at a wider
audience, outside the classroom. Hence, some factors of MEEGA+ such as Social Interaction, Perceived Learning and User Error Protection have been omitted for evaluation
of the game. We design a questionnaire, as presented in Table 1 based on the factors
mentioned above.
Emails were sent out to 70 individuals with varied professional background, which
included doctors, architects, engineers, chartered accountants, and students pursuing
medicine, engineering and architecture. The email consisted of information about the
game, link to browser and android versions of the game, and link to the user survey.
These individuals were requested to either download the SurviveCovid-19 application
and install the same on their Android mobile phones or navigate to the browser version
of the game. A 5-point Likert Scale based questionnaire as shown in Table 1, has been
sent to all the participants as a user survey in the email. Apart from the questions
based on the factors considered, as presented in Table 1, other questions that could
support the analysis such as demographic questions were also included in the user
survey (as presented in Table 6). The participants were asked to play the game and
provide their feedback by answering the questionnaire presented in the user survey.
Of these 70 individuals, 30 individuals responded to the user survey after playing the
game.

7. Results
We observed that there were 13 female and 17 male participants among the 30 volunteers who responded to the user survey (these details are presented in Table 6). These
participants had varied professional backgrounds, which also included 2 doctors, 2
public health and medical students, 2 architects, 2 architecture students and 16 engineering students, apart from software engineers and chartered accountants. Majority
of the volunteers belonged to the age group of 21-24 years and 25 participants have
agreed to have played games at least sometimes. All the participants have played the
SurviveCovid-19 game on an average of 5 times, before answering the user survey
questionnaire.
Table 1 indicates the results of user survey in terms of mean and standard deviation
of each question in the questionnaire. It can be observed that the mean for all the
questions is greater than or equal to 3.5, indicating the positive experience of users.
Figure 9, depicts the mean and standard deviation values for each of the three quality
factors. The mean values for each of the quality factors were considered to calculate
the quality score based on MEEGA+ model. Applying the Cronbach Alpha value for
means of player experience (FA, F, Ch, S, R) and usability (L, O, As, Acc) factors,
and then normalizing the resultant value by multiplying it by 10 resulted in quality
score of 69.3. The MEEGA+ evaluation theory states that games with quality score
greater than 65 are of excellent quality, while that between 42.5 to 65 are considered to
be of better quality. The quality score of SurviveCovid-19 is 69.3, indicating that the
game could be included in excellent quality category. This result indicates that such

12

games are challenging for learners, without monotonous activities and clear rules to
play the game. The mean of motivation factors (C, A, SE, RW), and other factors (I,
SP, RCL) is 3.76, indicating that majority of the participants find SurviveCovid-19 to
be motivating and helps the players in inculcating safety precautions against Covid-19
as a habit.
Participants also suggested that :
• Control sensitivity for navigation buttons could be improved.
• Way to home and to hospitals could be indicated in the game.
• The game button reaction is quite fast , rest all is fine

8. Discussion and Limitations
SurviveCovid-19 is based on survival theme, where the storyline deals with a person
who needs to go outdoors to purchase daily essentials and medicine during Covid19 situation. The game has been designed in a way which enforces the players to
follow safety measures to stay safe from Covid-19 when outdoors. Thus, the developed
prototype version of SurviveCovid-19 aims to educate players about precautions to be
taken and also inculcate the habit of following these precautions against Covid-19.
Though this game has been developed to address the younger generations of society,
it can be played by a wide range audience, irrespective of any social or educational
backgrounds. The only requirement of the game is that the players are expected to be
equipped with using a mobile phone or a desktop/laptop.
13

The current version of SurviveCovid-19 has only one level. However, further levels
can easily be added to the game and difficulty level could also be increased with
every level being added. The game could also include roles for the player, such as
scientist, doctor and health-care workers, and also include the aspect of vaccines.
Also, the existing SurviveCovid-19 application can be played only on Android based
mobile devices and on browser (from desktop). The future versions of the game could
be made compatible to mobile devices operating on other operating systems such as
Apple and Windows.

9. Conclusion and Future Work
In this paper, we presented the prototype version of SurviveCovid-19, a survival based
2D mobile and desktop (browser) game, aimed to bring awareness about safety measures to be followed against Covid-19. Public Awareness Campaigns are considered
as one of the most important measures to be taken across the world in cases of a
pandemic or a disease outbreak (Mytton et al., 2012), (Eastwood et al., 2010). The
current outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic requires all individuals across the world to follow precautions to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Large scale public health awareness
campaigns are being carried out by almost all the governments and various organizations across the world, including WHO to control Covid-19. Considering the large
amount of time spent by younger generations on mobile and desktop apps and games
in the present day, and the effect of games on players’ attitude (Chan et al., 2017),
(Orji et al., 2013), it could be useful to introduce games that contribute towards public health awareness and help the public in inculcating safety precautions as a habit.
SurviveCovid-19 aims to educate people about the safety measures to be followed
during Covid-19 and motivates them to follow the precautions in real time. We have
evaluated SurviceCovid-19 through a questionnaire adapted from factors in MEEGA+
model, and other factors such as motivation and impact of the game. The evaluation
was done through a remote quantitative user survey with 30 volunteers, and obtained
positive feedback with game quality score equal to 69.3, indicating excellent quality
category of the game. Majority of the volunteers found the game to be motivating and
interesting (more than 70% responded with agree or strongly agree for the respective
questions).
The game currently supports Android mobile devices. It can further be extended to
support mobile devices running on other operating systems. We plan to improve the
game by increasing number of levels in the game and difficulty of the levels. Also, future
versions of the game can include online and multiplayer features unlike the current
offline and single player version of the game. We also plan to modify the game controls
by improving the sensitivity of the control keys, as suggested by the participants in
the survey.
