Abstract
This work introduces a new concept of functional areas called Mobility Functional Areas (MFAs), i.e., the
geographic zones highly interconnected according to the analysis of mobile positioning data. The MFAs do
not coincide necessarily with administrative borders as they are built observing natural human mobility and,
therefore, they can be used to inform, in a bottom-up approach, local transportation, health and economic
policies. After presenting the methodology behind the MFAs, this study focuses on the link between the
COVID-19 pandemic and the MFAs in Austria. It emerges that the MFAs registered an average number of
infections statistically larger than the areas in the rest of the country, suggesting the usefulness of the MFAs
in the context of targeted re-escalation policy responses to this health crisis.

Introduction

In April 2020, the European Commission (EC) asked European Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) to share fully
anonymised and aggregated mobility data in order to support the fight against COVID-19 (European Commission,
2020a,b) with data driven evidence.
The value of mobile positioning personal data to describe human mobility has been already explored in literature
(Csáji et al., 2013) and its potential in epidemiology demonstrated (Wesolowski et al., 2012; Jia et al., 2020; WU
et al., 2020; Kraemer et al., 2020). The new initiative between the Commission and the European MNOs relies on the
effectiveness of using fully anonymised and aggregated mobile positioning data in compliance with ‘Guidelines on the use
of location data and contact tracing tools in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak’ by the European Data Protection
Board (EDPB, 04/2020).
This work makes use of mobile data to introduce a new concept of ‘functional areas’ called Mobility Functional Areas
or MFAs. The concept of functional areas has a long tradition in settlement geography, urban planning and policy making
(Ball, 1980; Van der Laan, 1998; Casado-Dı́az, 2000; OECD, 2002; Andersen, 2002; Eurostat, 2016; Gabrielli et al., 2018;
Dijkstra et al., 2019). The idea behind functional areas is the identification of a network of aggregated inbound and
outbound movements across spatial structures for a given time scale (for example, daily, intra-weekly, seasonally, etc)
according to the scopes of their use.
Thanks to the above mentioned unprecedented collaboration between the European Commission and European
Mobile Network Operators during the COVID-19 ongoing pandemic, it has been possible to define the MFAs for 15
European countries (14 member states of the European Union: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia,
Spain, Finland, France, Greece, Croatia, Italy, Sweden, Slovenia, plus Norway).
Despite the fact that mobility data alone cannot predict future needs (Bwambale et al., 2020), they can show already
compelling citizens needs, like transportation or health care facility allocation needs. Moreover, thanks to the capability
of collecting mobile data at very high time frequency and space granularity and backward in time, the time evolution of
the MFA can indeed show changes or ongoing trends or help to design policies or measure the effectiveness of policies.
This work is organised as follows. Section 2 is a brief summary of the different approach to the definition of
functional areas and explains the importance of this concept in the field of policy making. Section 3 describes the
essential characteristics of the mobile data used in the analysis. Section 4 explains in details the method of construction
of the MFAs starting from mobility data. As the MFAs are constructed on a daily basis, Section 5 also defines the
notion of persistent MFAs, i.e. the subset of areas which are consistently connected through time. In this respect, the
pre- and post-lockdown MFAs generated by COVID-19 mobility restriction measures are also discussed. To show the
effectiveness of the MFAs concept to policy making, Section 7 analyses the impact of the MFAs on the spread of the
coronavirus during the first wave of the pandemic. Throughout the analyses, the case study of Austria is considered.
Section 8 discusses limits and potential of this approach.

Functional areas and policy making

As mentioned, the concept of functional areas has a long tradition in settlement geography, urban planning and policy
making. These areas have and can be defined in several ways. A few variants of the same concept are the following:
• ‘commuting regions’ : the identification of relatively closed regions of daily moves of residing population based on
commuting data from censuses (Casado-Dı́az, 2000; Van der Laan, 1998).
• ‘functional regions’ : a tool used to target areas of specific national and European policies (OECD, 2002). There
are several natural areas of application of functional regions including employment and transportation policies,
environmentally sustainable spatial forms, reforms of administrative regions, strategic level of urban and regional
planning and a wide range of geographical analyses (migration, regionalisation, settlement system hierarchisation)
(Andersen, 2002; Ball, 1980; Casado-Dı́az, 2000; Van der Laan, 1998).
• ‘functional urban areas’ : cities with their commuting zone (Eurostat, 2016; Dijkstra et al., 2019). They are
generally identified by a densely inhabited city, together with a less densely populated commuting zone whose
labour market is highly integrated with that of the city.
• ‘overlapping functional regions’ by Killer and Axhausen (2010).
The most common data sources for the above-mentioned studies are by far the population censuses and ad hoc pilot
surveys. In these approaches travel behaviour is captured collecting costly household travel survey data, which are
usually very small in terms of sample size, rarely updated and sometimes prone to reporting errors (Bwambale et al.,
2020).
Mobile data have been used in the past in some pilot-studies like in Estonia (Novak et al., 2013) or in some regions of
Italy in Gabrielli et al. (2018). An attempt to mix survey, census and mobile data has been proposed as a proof-of-concept
by Bwambale et al. (2020) for the case of Bangladesh.
The approach used to build the MFAs presented in the next section is special in several ways. Indeed, the approach
has been designed to be robust to the diversified data sources available for the 15 countries and also in that it tries
to take into account persistent patterns of mobility rather than focusing on a single period as we know that mobility
patterns may change due to seasonalities or because there is a strong intra-weekly periodicity. This was possible thanks
to the long time series made available through the unprecedented agreement.
As for the other functional areas that make use of mobility data, the MFAs are particularly interesting as the
underlying data can be collected at high frequency compared to any survey data, and also covering the whole territory
of a country rather than focusing on special cities or routes. Remark also that, since mobile phone services unique
subscribers1 represent about 65% of the population across Europe (GSMA, 2020), mobile data can reliably be used to
capture the aggregate mobility patterns.
In a policy making framework especially related, but not limited, to the COVID-19 pandemic, the insights resulting
from the identification of these new mobility areas may help governments and authorities at various levels:
a) to control virus spread by limiting non-essential movements outwards an MFA with a high virus infection rate
compared to its neighbour MFAs especially in the initial phase of a virus outbreak;
b) to apply targeted and local physical distancing policies in different MFAs, according to their specific epidemiological
situation, thus minimizing virus spread and at the same time limiting the economic and social impact of such
measures by avoiding not adequate national and universal physical distancing policies;
In the absence of any other information, most of the governments are forced to use administrative areas, such as
regions, provinces and municipalities to impose physical distancing measures and mobility restrictions. Nevertheless,
administrative boundaries are static and do not reflect actual mobility. On the other hand, both the potential spreading
of the virus and the territorial economy strongly depend on local mobility (Iacus et al., 2020).
Although not all of these aspects can be taken into account in this work, the hypothesis is that the implementation
of different physical distancing strategies (such as school closures or other human mobility limitations) based on MFA
instead of administrative borders might lead to a better balance between the expected positive effect on public health
and the negative socio-economic fallout for the country. To this aim, Section 7 will present a the case study of Austria
focusing on the impact of MFAs on the spread of the coronavirus.

Mobile positioning data

The agreement between the European Commission and the MNOs defines the basic characteristics of fully anonymised
and aggregate data to be shared with the Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC2 ). This section briefly describes the
original mobile positioning data from the MNOs; the following section introduces the mobility indicator derived by JRC
and used in this research.
Data from MNOs are provided to JRC in the form of Origin-Destination-Matrices (ODMs) (Mamei et al., 2019; Fekih
et al., 2020). Each cell [i − j] of the ODM shows the overall number of ‘movements’ (also referred to as ‘trips’ or ‘visits’)
that have been recorded from the origin geographical reference area i to the destination geographical reference area j
over the reference period. In general, an ODM is structured as a table showing:
1 All

mobile services subscribers, including IoT, are about 86% of the population, 76% of which real smartphone users.
Joint Research Centre is the European Commission’s science and knowledge service. The JRC employs scientists to carry
out research in order to provide independent scientific advice and support to EU policy.
2 The

2

• reference period (date and, if available, time);
• area of origin;
• area of destination;
• count of movements.
Despite the fact that the ODMs provided by different MNOs have similar structure, they are often very heterogeneous.
Their differences can be due to the methodology applied to count the movements, to the spatial granularity or to the
time coverage. Nevertheless, each ODM is consistent over time and relative changes are possible to be estimated.

Mobility functional areas

The construction of the MFAs starts from the ODM at the highest spatial granularity available. Table 1 shows the
characteristics of the different sets of data used for to calculate the MFAs. Although the applied methodology is very
similar for all the 15 considered countries, without any loss of generality, only the case of Austria is used to provide
practical examples. Notice that for some countries, there are more than one MNO providing data, but the final results
are similar. In this study we focus on the first wave of the pandemic and thus the data considered end in June 2020.

The construction of the MFAs starts from origin-destination matrix. Let ODMd,i,j an element of the ODM matrix

the corresponding
where n is the total number of rows and columns of the ODM (which is a n×n matrix) and let ODMd,i,j
element of the ODM normalised by row.
Now we transform the ODMd∗ matrix into a 0/1 proximity matrix Pd as follows
(

ODMd,i,j

otherwise,

where the threshold has been set3 to 15% according to several studies (Novak et al., 2013; Eurostat, 2016; Dijkstra et al.,
2019). As the ODM matrix is not symmetric, so is the proximity matrix, which is transformed into an adjacency matrix
A through the following expression:

1 
Ad = · Pd + PdT
2
so that each element of Ad can take only three values:
• Ad,i,j = 0 if there are no movements from i to j and viceversa (i.e. the two cells are not connected);
• Ad,i,j = 0.5 if there are movements only in one direction, either i to j or j to i.
• Ad,i,j = 1 if there are movements in both directions, from i to j and from j to i;
From the adjacency matrix we construct a directed4 graph where the vertex represent the cells i = 1, . . . , n and the
edges are weighted according to the matrix A. The MFAs are calculated using a community detection technique called
walktrap algorithm (Pons and Latapy, 2006), which finds communities through a series of short random walks5 . The
idea is that these random walks tend to stay within the same community. The goal of the walktrap algorithm is indeed
3 We tested different thresholds above and below 15% and also a uniform distribution threshold, but the 15% seems to be the
most effective in isolating stable MFAs for all the countries analysed.
4 An undirected graph could be used as well, but we use a directed graph in view of the community detection algorithm used
later on.
5 This approach is different from the intramax algorithm used in (Killer and Axhausen, 2010; Novak et al., 2013)

to identify the partition of a graph that maximises its modularity6 , which is exactly the same concept of clusters of fully
interconnected cells where most of the movements are internal.
All the communities with only one member, i.e. those without inbound and outbound movements over 15%, are collapsed
into a single big fictitious area representing the territory that either cannot be identified as a pure MFA, or it is just
a collection of atomic (mobility-wise) cells. As this algorithm is data-driven, the number of MFAs is not prescribed in
advance but is the outcome of the algorithm itself. For example, for Austria we have more than 200 MFAs per day, some
of them are very small, others are quite large. In all events, their shapes depend only on the mobility itself.

4.1

Mobility patterns and mobility functional areas

It is well known and expected that mobility changes between weekdays, weekends and holidays, but there might be also
an internal variability within the working week as well as across weeks (e.g., not all Mondays are exactly the same in
terms of mobility); this is why we need to measure how much MFAs are stable and consistent in time.
In order to evaluate the persistence of MFAs’ structure in time, we make use of the following similarity index (Gravilov
et al., 2000) between two sets of groups of labelled G = {G1 , . . . , GK } and G0 = {G01 , . . . , G0K 0 }, where K and K 0 are
not necessarily equal. The similarity index is defined as

k 
1 X
0
Sim(G, G ) =
max sim(Gi , Gj )
K i=1 j=1,...,K 0
0

where
sim(Gi , G0j ) = 2

|Gi ∩ G0j |
,
|Gi | + |G0j |

i = 1, . . . , K,

(1)

j = 1, . . . , K 0 .

with |B| the number of elements in set B.
The similarity index is such that Sim(G, G0 ) ∈ [0, 1] but it is not symmetric, therefore in order to have a symmetric
measure we consider

1
Sim(G, G0 ) =
Sim(G, G0 ) + Sim(G0 , G0 ) .
2
Figure 1 is a heatmap representation of the matrix of similarity index among all MFAs for the period 1 February 2020
- 29 June 2020. Darkest-bluish zones are most different, whereas lighter-reddish are the most similar. It is interesting
to observe the difference between pre- and post- lockdown (14 March 2020), then a slow recovery to normality. It is
also worth noticing that holidays and weekends have clearly different mobility patterns than weekdays and that these
MFAs are different from the administrative borders (Austrian districts), especially during weekdays. To put in evidence
the intra weekly patterns in Figure 2 we calculate the similarity among each day of the week. We start from the first
Monday of the data and we calculate the similarity of it with all the subsequent Mondays. Similarly for the Tuesdays,
etc. We also calculate similarity of the daily MFAs with the administrative borders. What clearly emerges from Figure 2
is that each day of the week has an almost stable pattern7 before and after the lockdown. Further, we can notice that
the similarity of the MFAs with the administrative borders is quite low, meaning that indeed MFAs do not coincide with
the latter. The effect of lockdowns is also seen in this curve.

5

Detecting the persistent MFAs

As seen in the previous section, the MFAs have daily patterns, they change between before and after the lockdown is
in force and tend to go back to their original shapes after the ease of containment measures. Moreover, MFAs shows
time-variability also for the same weekday; thus, in order to fully exploit their potential, a stable version of the MFAs
needs to be identified. Since the number of MFAs changes day by day and the same cell may move from an MFA to
another (changing the MFA label associated to it), we apply a CO-association method. The CO-association method
(CO) avoids the label correspondence problem. It does so by mapping the ensemble members onto a new representation
where the similarity matrix is calculated between a pair of objects in terms of how many times a particular pair is
clustered together in all ensemble members (Fred and Jain, 2005). In other words, CO calculates the percentage of
agreement between ensemble members in which a given pair of objects is placed in the same mobility functional area.
As the first lockdown in Austria was enforced on 16 March 2020, we focus on the weekdays from 1 February 2020 to 15
March 2020.
Let d be the data of one of these D weekdays and MFAd the set of mobility functional areas obtained on day d. We then
evaluate the co-association matrix
CO(xi , xj ) =

D
1 X
δ (M F Ad (xi ), M F Ad (xj ))
D
d=1

where Xi and xj are the cells (e.g., municipalities) and M F Ad is the set of MFAs for day d = 1, . . . , D and δ(·, ·) is
defined as follows:
(
1, if u and v belong to the same mobility functional area,
δ(u, v) =
0, otherwise.
6 The modularity of a graph is an index designed to measure the strength of division of a network into modules (also called
groups, clusters or communities).
7 In the sense that the MFAs are similar among them.

Figure 2: Intra weekly similarity (Mondays versus first Mondays, etc) of daily MFAs and with respect to the Austrian districts (daily
MFAs with respect to administrative borders).

Then, as our scope is to obtain a persistent version of the MFAs, we further threshold the CO matrix so that all entries
below 50% are set to 0 and those higher or equal 50% are set to 1 (it means that only cells falling in the same MFA at
least 50% of the times are associated with that MFA) leading to a new matrix CO.
Then again a directed graph is built with this matrix using the entries of the CO matrix to weight the edges and applying
the walktrap algorithm to obtain the final persistent MFA. The same procedure is replicated for the post lockdown dates,
ending up with a different set of persistent MFAs that we denote by Post-MFA. With these two persistent sets of MFAs

5

at hand, we further test if they are meaningful to the analysis. It turns out that these persistent MFA are in fact
reasonably well defined.
We then apply the symmetric similarity index Sim(·, ·) for all the daily MFAs against the persistent MFAs, the Post-MFA
and the districts (NUTS3). Figure 3.

Figure 3: Pre and post lockdown MFA for Austria compared with NUTS3 districts (blue). Whereas before the lockdown the MFAs extend
across provinces, after the lockdown their area generally reduces and they mostly lay within districts’ borders (with some exceptions) or
they completely disappear as all mobility remains within individual cells. Areas where connectivity is below 15% (no apparent stable
direction is observed in the mobility flows) are transparent. The color scale is only meant to distinguish the MFAs. Colors of the left and
right maps are different as the number of MFAs is different.

In Figure 4 we calculate the similarity index between the pre-lockdown MFAs, the lockdown MFAs and, again,
the districts. It quite evident the abrupt change in the shape of the MFAs on March 16h which corresponds to the
stay-at-home nation wide order imposed by the Austrian authorities.

Figure 4: Similarity by day of the week of the MFAs with respect to persistent and post lockdown MFAs and Austrian districts. Daily
MFAs are very similar to the persistent MFAs before lockdown which was enforced on 16 March 2020, whereas they are more similar to
post-lockdown MFA after. A return to normality is slowly appearing. Once again, the MFAs are quite different from administrative borders.

Mobility functional areas and transport system

As said the MFAs are generated by natural human mobility which is in fact also driven by the available the local
transport system and viceversa. At the same time, the MFAs can inform about possible new directions in which the
transport system can be enhanced. Another interesting fact of the MFAs is the, especially around big cities, they are
not necessarily made of contiguous zones. For example, in Figure 5 we can see some typical stylized facts of MFAs:
• MFAs in some cases follow already existing infrastructures, like highways;
• MFAs are not contiguous;

6

• MFAs are not all of the same size and this is clearly related to the relative importance of the geographical zones
involved.

Figure 5: The persistent MFAs around Vienna pre (top) and during the lockdown (bottom) Each color represents a MFA but colors are
different in the two maps as the MFAs are different. The largest MFA in the pre-lockdown period (top panel) around Vienna, marked
with a bold gray border, is made of non contiguous zones and follows the main highways passing through the capital. This MFAs is highly
shrunk during lock-down (bottom panel). On the other hand, other MFAs merge during lockdown and all of them are contiguous. This
seems to indicate that movements are likely to be more local during the lockdown.

The largest MFA in Figure 5 is clearly made of not all contiguous areas and follows the the most important highway
that passes through the capital. It is also clear that these zone, which are highly interconnected by definition of MFA,
represent important highlights to eventually improve the transport system among these zones. The bottom panel of
Figure 5 shows how the MFAs shapes have shrunk during the lockdown. It is important to notice that, in the presence
of higher resolution data, it would be also possible to measure the socio-economic implication of the lockdown measures
in the sense that at very local level it would be reasonable to see which part of the residential population has moved
anyway despite the virus for different reasons among which, e.g., the impossibility to perform teleworking.

MFAs and COVID-19 cases during the first wave

In this section we analyse the impact of the MFAs on the spread of the coronavirus. We want to test the hypothesis that
the MFAs are correlated to the evolution of the number of cases until strict measures to mobility are enforced. For this
reason, we will focus the attention on the period 15 March 2020 - 30 April 2020 and we monitor the number of cases
for the zones that are within or not one of the pre-lockdown MFAs. Notice that the national lockdown was enforced in
Austria on the 16th of March and it is now known in the literature that it takes about 14 days (Iacus et al., 2020) to see
the decrease in the number of cases due to a lockdown, so we should expect a peak around the 30th of March and then
a decrease of cases as indeed Figure 8 shows.

In Austria we have 222 MFAs (plus the residual territory) built on 4789 zones identified by the MNO while the
number of political districts8 (GKZ) for which epidemiological data are available is 94. Of the 4789 zones, 3409 belong
to a proper MFA and 1380 are in the residual territory of Austria. Not all the MFAs are big enough to be relevant either
because their population is small or because their territorial extent is very limited. Using high resolution Facebook
population data9 , we reconstruct the population of each of 4789 the zones. Figure 6 shows the shapes of the MFAs
compared to those of the political districts for which health data are available and also the estimated population for each
zone of the MFAs.

Figure 6: MFAs compared to GKZs borders (left) and the estimated population on the MFAs (right). The MFAs also cross the administrative borders on which the health data are available.

As said, the COVID-19 health data for Austria are available only at political district level from the open data
repository10 of the Federal Ministry of social Affairs, Health, Care and Consumer Protection11 . As it is know that the
number of infection cases is proportional to the population size, we redistribute the number of COVID-19 cases on the
4789 zones proportionally to the population size of the zones within each district. Figure 7 shows the number of cases in
the last 7 days for four euqally spaced dates from 15 March to 30 April 2020. These maps seem to confirm qualitatively
the role of the MFAs in the spread of the virus.
We now test our hypothesis in two ways. First of all we consider a simple linear model for the log number of cases
in the last 7 days and the indicator function mfaInd which takes value equal to 1 if the zone belongs to a MFA and zero
otherwise. We also control for the population size of the zone. The model is as follows
yi,t = α + β · mfaIndi + γ · populationi ,

(2)

for t = 15 March 2020, . . ., 30 April 2020, yi,t is the logarithm of the number of COVID-19 cases in the last 7 days for
the zone i, i = 1, . . . , 4789.
Figure 8 shows the sign of the coefficient of the mfaInd as well as the corresponding adjusted R2 goodness of fit
index for the model. We use the number of total cases in the past 7 days in order to take into account lagged effects of
mobility on the evolution of the pandemic.
It turns out that the MFA indicator function has always a positive coefficient β with p-value less that 0.001, i.e.,
always statistically significant. Moreover, the overall fit of the model is acceptable being in the range 0.4-0.5 most of
the times during the peak of the epidemic. The fact that towards the end of the period the MFA indicator variable has
a coefficient decreasing to zero is due to the fact that the mobility pattern changed due to national and local lockdown
measures and thus the MFA are quite different.
Model (2) is capturing an average effect of MFA impact on the number of COVID-19 cases. To disentangle the
impact of each MFA on the pandemic, we use a random effect linear model, also known as mixed effect model (Bates and
DebRoy, 2004) or hierarchical model (Gelman and Hill, 2006). In the form we use it is just a regression with clustered
errors that depend on a grouping variable. In our case, the dependent variable is again yi,t but we replace in (2) the
indicator function mfaInd with the MFA categorical variable to obtain equation (3). The MFA variable has 223 different
values, so it implies 222 new dummy variables in the model, most of them correlated, and for which there are not much
observations per groups as some MFA are made of two two or few more zones. To solve this problem we apply the
random effect model as implemented in (Bates et al., 2015). In practice, we cluster the observations in groups identified
by the political districts (GKZ). Exploiting the correlation between the GKZs and the MFAs it is possible to estimate all
the variances of the MFA dummy variables and hence test the significance of each coefficient. The random effect model
can be written in this form, where | GKZ means conditionally to in the sense of Bates et al. (2015):
yi,t = α + β · mfai + γ · populationi | GKZ,

MFA

A dynamical view which involves all significant MFAs during the whole period of the analysis is presented in Figure 10
which shows the heatmap of the corresponding MFAs coefficients which are statistically significant at 0.01 level in all
the dates analyzed. It is again clear that the only special MFA is the number 181 that becomes significant and negative
starting from 17 April 2020 when all the other MFAs are no longer significant. But around 15 April, the number of cases
is also decreasing very quickly towards zero, meaning that there is essentially no signal in the data, i.e., there are no
longer cases to analyze.
This MFA number 181 is made of zones in the Wien Stad and Sankt Pölten Land, a small district on the west border
to the city of Vienna. The conclusion here seems to be that when the number of cases goes down due to countermeasures
(lock downs, curfews, etc) the impact of pre-lockdown MFAs is clearly vanishing, while until the lockdown, the MFAs
are largely driving the pandemic. The negative impact related to the MFA number 181 is mainly due to the lack of
cases for all the other MFAs and a few left cases in that MFAs, which naturally leads to a negative sign of the regression
coefficient. The other MFA which shows a negative coefficient in a single date, is the MFA number 219 that corresponds
to the small village of Weiz. As this is one date only, we do not think that this is a statistical evidence so we do not
comment any further.

Figure 10: The impact of the MFA on the log number of cases. Blue dots mean that the corresponding MFAs is impacting (increasing)
the number of cases; red dots means the contrary. transparent dots means that the corresponding regression coefficient is not significant.

Table 2 shows that in terms of population size and therefore number of COVID-19 cases, the MFAs which are not
statistically significant are in general smaller. This type of results in quite natural as it means that the areas to be
contained or monitored are correctly identified in our approach. This implies also that the MFA with higher population
can be isolated if i) they have too many cases, in which case there is high probability of exporting cases; or if ii) there
are no infections, in which case it is possible to avoid the import of new cases (Iacus et al., 2020).

To summarize, this analysis clearly shows the impact of MFAs on COVID-19 spread (along with other causes) and
can inform policies in future waves. Indeed, a potential implication of this analysis is that, if new cases arises in a zone
belonging to a specific MFA, that MFA should be isolated (or tested extensively) to efficiently contain further spread of
the virus, rather than focusing on the whole or single district (when MFAs crosses districts) or instead of blocking the

whole country, in the spirit of the zero-covid strategy12 .

Conclusions

The present work, in line with the literature on functional regions, puts in evidence on how administrative borders are
often different from the commuting patterns. Indeed, human mobility naturally shapes these patterns. In this study,
fully anonymised and aggregated data provided by several European MNOs are used to identify a data-driven concept of
functional areas, named ‘Mobility Functional Areas’ (MFAs). Though slightly changing every day, MFAs are essentially
persistent in time and present clear intra-weekly patterns. We have shown that at very local scale, MFAs can shed light on
how possible optimal transport planning. In terms of policy effectiveness, it has been shown that the mobility-restriction
measures (lockdown) implemented to limit the COVID-19 outbreak, have not only reduced the volume of mobility but
have also had a clear impact on the shape of the MFAs, showing a clear “shrinking” effect as expected. Finally, we also
provided statistical evidence that in the initial phase of pandemic, the MFAs played an important role in the spread of
the virus.
Nevertheless, despite the evident potential benefits of the adoption of MFAs, it must be noted that while administrative areas (hard boundaries) are well recognised by citizens and make it easy for the administrations to implement
physical distancing and mobility restrictions, further coordination efforts would be needed to apply such limitations
based on MFAs which may easily cross these administrative borders.
While this study described only examples from Austria, the full study comprises the analysis of Sections 4 to 6, for
15 European countries as shown in Table1 and the definition of the MFAs and the corresponding shapefiles are available
through the KCMD Dynamic Data Hub13 for further analysis by scholars.
