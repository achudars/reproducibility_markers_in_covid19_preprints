SUMMARY
COVID-19 is a devastating respiratory and inflammatory illness caused by a new coronavirus that is
rapidly spreading throughout the human population. Over the past 6 months, severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for COVID-19, has already infected over
11.6 million (25% located in United States) and killed more than 540K people around the world. As we
face one of the most challenging times in our recent history, there is an urgent need to identify drug
candidates that can attack SARS-CoV-2 on multiple fronts. We have therefore initiated a computational
dynamics drug pipeline using molecular modeling, structure simulation, docking and machine learning
models to predict the inhibitory activity of several million compounds against two essential SARS-CoV-2
viral proteins and their host protein interactors; S/Ace2, Tmprss2, Cathepsins L and K, and Mpro to
prevent binding, membrane fusion and replication of the virus, respectively. All together we generated
an ensemble of structural conformations that increase high quality docking outcomes to screen over >6
million compounds including all FDA-approved drugs, drugs under clinical trial (>3000) and an
additional >30 million selected chemotypes from fragment libraries. Our results yielded an initial set of
350 high value compounds from both new and FDA-approved compounds that can now be tested
experimentally in appropriate biological model systems. We anticipate that our results will initiate
screening campaigns and accelerate the discovery of COVID-19 treatments.
INTRODUCTION
COVID-19 is a disease cause by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It
was identified in Wuhan city, in the Hubei province of China in December 2019 (Chen et al., 2020;
Huang et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). The virus is spread between people via small droplets produce by
talking, sneezing and coughing. The disease was declared a global pandemic by the World health
organization (WHO) on March 11th, 2020. While a large proportion of the cases results in mild
symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigues, loss of smell and taste, as well as shortness of breath, some
cases progress into more acute respiratory symptoms such as pneumonia, multiple-organ failure, septic
shock and blood clots. These more severe symptoms can lead to death and are likely to be precipitated
by a cytokine storm after infection and multiplication of the virus in humans. Indeed, recent data
indicate that the levels of IL-6 correlate with respiratory and organ failures (Gubernatorova et al., 2020).
So far, the estimated death rate of SARS-CoV-2 is above 1.3%, which is more than 10 times higher
than the death rate of seasonal influenza (Abdollahi et al., 2020). Older patients and patients who have
serious underlying medical conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and asthma are at higher risk for
severe disease outcomes (Tian et al., 2020). A clear understanding of the genetics and molecular
mechanisms controlling severe illness remains to be determined.
SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA betacoronavirus, closely related to SARS-CoV1, which caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, and Middle East respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which caused MERS in 2012. Positive-strand RNA viruses are a
large fraction of known viruses including common pathogens such as rhinoviruses that cause common
colds, as well as dengue virus, hepatitis C virus (HCV), West Nile virus. The first genome sequence of
SARS-CoV-2 was released in early January on the open access virological website
(http://virological.org/) (Zhou et al., 2020). Its genome is ~29.8 kb and possesses 14 open reading
frames (ORFs), encoding 27 proteins (Wu et al., 2020a). The genome contains four structural proteins:
spike (S) glycoprotein, envelope (E) protein, membrane (M) protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein. The
E and M proteins form the viral envelope, while the N protein binds to the virus’s RNA genome. The
spike glycoprotein is a key surface protein that interacts with cell surface receptor, angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (Ace2) mediating entrance of the virus into host cells (Zhu et al., 2018). In addition
to its dependence on the binding of S to Ace2, cell entry also requires priming of S by the host serine
protease, transmembrane serine protease 2 (Tmprss2). Tmprss2 proteolytically processes S,
promoting membrane fusion, cell invasion and viral uptake (Heurich et al., 2014; Hoffmann et al., 2020).
Blocking viral entry by targeting S/Ace2 interaction or Tmprss2-mediated priming may constitute an

effective treatment strategy for COVID-19. The non-structural proteins, which include the main viral
protease (nsp5 or Mpro) and RNA polymerase (nsp12), regulate virus replication and assembly. They
are expressed as two long polypeptides, pp1a and pp1ab, which are proteolytically processed by Mpro.
The key role of Mpro in viral replication makes it a good therapeutic target as well. A third group of
proteins are described as accessory proteins. This group is the least understood, but its members are
thought to counteract host innate immunity (Kim et al., 2020, Cell 181, 914–921) (Fig. 1A).
There is currently no treatment or vaccine available to prevent or treat COVID-19 (Baden and Rubin,
2020; Lurie et al., 2020) (https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19update-daily-roundup-june-1-2020). While the FDA has granted emergency use authorization (EUA) for
the 65-year-old antimalarial drug, hydroxychloroquine, COVID-19 treatment based on early results from
clinical trial in China and France (Gao et al., 2020; Gautret et al., 2020a; Gautret et al., 2020b; Million et
al., 2020), more recent results reported that hydroxychloroquine does not decrease viral replication,
pneumonia or hospital mortality, and may in fact increase cardiac arrest in patients infected with
COVID-19 (Mehra et al., 2020; Rosenberg et al., 2020). The accuracy of the statistical analyses in
these studies raised serious concerns in the scientific community. More accurate data are needed to
reach a conclusion about the effect of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients. In another recent
study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, the antiviral remdesivir, an unapproved drug
that was originally developed to fight Ebola, seemed to improve patients with severe breathing
problems (Beigel et al., 2020) and has also recently been granted EUA by the FDA. Repurposing drugs
that are designed to treat other diseases is one of the quickest ways to find therapeutics to control the
current pandemic. Such drugs have already been tested for toxicity issues and can be granted EUA by
the FDA to help doctors to treat COVID-19 patients.
Another efficient way to attack the virus is to use drug cocktails to target multiple enzymes/pathways
used by the virus. Combination therapy has the advantage of being less likely to select for treatmentresistant viral mutants. Such a strategy has been successfully used to treat hepatitis C virus (HCV) and
human-immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. In the case of HCV, the treatment, Enpclusa, combines
sofosbuvir, which inhibits the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NS5B), and velpatasvir, a
defective substrate that inhibits NS5A. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) against HIV combines drugs from
different drug classes to target disparate aspects of the HIV replication cycle. These drug classes
include nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors,
protease inhibitors, fusion inhibitors, CCR5 antagonists, post-attachment inhibitors, and integrase
inhibitors. One example from HIV-AIDS literature is the randomized comparison of 4 groups of patients
comparing monotherapy to combination therapies: zidovudine (ZDV) monotherapy; ZDV zidovudine
and didanosine; ZDV plus zalcitabine; or didanosine monotherapy. This randomized trial showed
positive results when ZDT was combined with didanosine or zalcitabine, and for didanosine compared
to ZDT monotherapy in raising CD4 counts greater than 50% (Hammer et al., 1996). Combination
therapy has become standard of care initial treatment in other infectious diseases such as
Mycobacterium tuberculosis and failure to cure with monotherapy and requires multidrug therapy (MDT)
(Collaborative Group for the Meta-Analysis of Individual Patient Data in et al., 2018). Similar MDT is
also found effective in hepatitis C virus infection using glecaprevir and pibrentasivr combination
therapies which lead to sustained virological response rates as far out as 12 weeks' post-treatment
(Wang et al., 2019).
We propose an effective combination therapy for COVID-19 could target the SARS-CoV-2 replication
cycle at multiple levels to synergistically inhibit viral spread and dissemination. Using a computational
pipeline that aimed to expeditiously identify lead compounds against COVID-19, we combined
compound library preparation, molecular modeling, and structure simulations to generate an ensemble
of conformations and increase high quality docking outcomes against two essential SARS-CoV-2 viral
proteins and their host protein interactions; S/Ace2, Tmprss2, Cathepsin L and K, and Mpro that are

known to control both viral binding, entry and virus replication (Fig. 1A). Our in silico approach (Fig.
1B), which will most likely lead into experimental virus screening, structural characterization of binding
interactions by X-ray crystallography, and compound safety profiling. Virtual screening (VS) is a rational
driven controller for identification of new hits from compound libraries (Willett, 2006) using either ligandbased (LBvs) or structure-based (SBvs) virtual screening (Dror et al., 2004). LBvs tactics use structural
and biological data of known active compounds to select favorable candidates with biological activity
from experiments (Jahn et al., 2009; Maldonado et al., 2006). SBvs approaches, on the other hand,
examine quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR), clustering, pharmacophore and 3D shape
matching (Villoutreix et al., 2007). The utility of VS is evident in the growth of our knowledge base of
new compounds and existing drugs as well as the expansion of our structural databases. SBvs is
generally the preferred approach when access to the target 3D-information derived from NMR, X-ray
crystallography or homology models (Jahn et al., 2009; Maldonado et al., 2006) is possible. Molecular
docking (docking) is the most common SBvs approach used today (Bottegoni et al., 2009; Corbeil et al.,
2012; Fernandez-Recio et al., 2005; Friesner et al., 2006; McGann, 2012; Morris et al., 2009) and
searches for the ideal position and orientation (called "pose") of the small molecule within a target's
binding site, which gives a score for the pose. When including knowledge of experimentally known
compounds ("actives") from a 3D target, LBvs and SBvs can be combined to increase likelihood of
obtaining new actives from searches (Kruger and Evers, 2010).
Hit identification in VS also requires careful selection of the methods used based on the goal of the
project (e.g. compound databases and libraries can be either proprietary, commercial or public)
(Bender, 2010). ZINC is one such large public database often used in VS (Irwin and Shoichet, 2005),
which contains millions of compounds. By contrast, other libraries have structure-activity relationships
(SAR) databases (Scior et al., 2007) that integrate information about compound interactions with their
known targets. DrugBank, Chem-Space are other attractive sources of compounds for drug
repurposing (or repositioning) (Ashburn and Thor, 2004; Duenas-Gonzalez et al., 2008; O'Connor and
Roth, 2005) (Wishart et al., 2008), and maintain drug diversity that is useful for scaffold development
(Gozalbes et al., 2008; Schreiber, 2000).
Advances in computing power have increased utility of in silico screening capabilities and balanced the
need for accuracy with virtual high-throughput screening approximations and assumptions (Anthony,
2009; Lee et al., 2008; McGaughey et al., 2007; Plewczynski et al., 2009), while recent techniques
have improved accuracy without sacrificing CPU time (Caulfield and Devkota, 2012; Caulfield et al.,
2011; Jiang et al., 2014; MacKerell et al., 1998; Phillips et al., 2005) (Fig. 1B). Further innovations in
docking methods have improved the exactness of empirical docking equations (Corbeil et al., 2012;
Fernandez-Recio et al., 2005; Friesner et al., 2006; Kalid et al., 2012; Kruger and Evers, 2010;
McGann, 2012). Accuracy is improved by incorporating molecular flexibility with simulations (Caulfield,
2012; Caulfield et al., 2019; Caulfield and Medina-Franco, 2011; Caulfield et al., 2011; Caulfield et al.,
2014; Kayode et al., 2016), thus capturing conformational information on structural changes that
directly impact compound docking results.
Here, we present in silico screening of both the approved FDA compound library and >30 million
compounds representing new chemical entities (NCEs) (Clecildo Barreto Bezerra et al., 2018; Ekins et
al., 2014; Janes et al., 2018; Pillaiyar et al., 2020). Other libraries consisting of approved drugs, natural
products, and a subset of the ZINC data base were also included based on relationship with SARSCoV-2 virus (Corsello et al., 2017; Lagarde et al., 2018; Riva et al., 2020)(Irwin and Shoichet, 2005).
Our findings include >350 compounds, including both NCEs (310) and FDA repurposing compounds
(40). Our approach combines VS and careful library selection with advanced docking techniques to
efficiently search the behemoth chemical landscape of possible organic compounds (Bohacek et al.,
1996) and identify high value hits toward key SARS-CoV-2 targets.

RESULTS
To target the COVID19 problem on multiple fronts (e.g. Ace2:S protein, Tmprss2, Mpro, and Cathepsin L
and K), as well as improve our screening accuracy using our selected repurposing libraries and new
chemical entity libraries (ZINC database), we implemented a novel method that integrates protein
flexibility/shape, adaptive biasing algorithms, machine learning from drug data, and final Z-score matrix
weighting to our drug modeling. We matched all FDA compounds with our realistic (X-ray derived)
protein structures over a dynamic range of protein conformations with accelerated dynamics using our
algorithms, such as Maxwell's demon molecular dynamics (MdMD); this approach combines docking
with simulations for exploration of both ligand and protein flexibility (Caulfield, 2012; Caulfield et al.,
2019; Caulfield and Devkota, 2012; Caulfield and Medina-Franco, 2011; Caulfield et al., 2014; Kayode
et al., 2016; von Roemeling et al., 2018). We then refined the drug-target interface our specific leaderlike hit compounds using the quantum mechanics (QM)-based scoring within our MdMD matrix
(Caulfield, 2012) to make our go/no-go assessment, which is particularly useful with NCEs and de novo
compound design (DCDs). The protocol for library, structural modeling, dynamics, refinement, and hit
identification as part of a pipeline is given (Fig. 1B).
I. Modeling and Simulations for Improved Docking Outcome
To improve our docking outcome, we constructed x-ray structure-based models of Ace2 bound to Sprotein, Mpro, and Tmprss2 in our molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) and virtual screening (Fig.
1B,S1). As S-protein interfaces with Ace2 at a distinct region from the active site (Fig. S1A-D),
inhibition of the binding site by ligands may disrupt the Ace2/S-protein interaction. Canonical inhibitors
of Ace2 bind at the active site where angiotensin interacts, whereas drugs directed at the structural
region for S-protein binding are not overlapping with the binding site. The modulation of Ace2/S-protein
interaction by canonical Ace2 inhibitors is likely allosteric and suboptimal. Therefore, directly targeting
the interface of the interaction should increase efficacy of the approach and block COVID viral binding,
precluding entry (Fig. S1). Additional investigation into the glycosylation sites of the S-protein
demonstrated that the Ace2 binding site is mostly unaffected by these additions (Fig. S2).
A. S-protein:Ace2 interaction (protein-protein inhibitor, PPI) requires dynamics to reveal binding
site
To get the optimal interface for drug screening, we used our grid searching algorithms, as well as site
mapping and protein-protein docking, to examine the protein-protein interactions surface using MDS
(Fig. 2-3,S1) (Bhachoo and Beuming, 2017; Caulfield and Devkota, 2012; Caulfield et al., 2011;
Caulfield and Harvey, 2007; Fernandez-Recio et al., 2005; Kozakov et al., 2006). The protein-protein
inhibitor (PPI) interaction complex did not identify any immediate binding site on the surface of the PPI
interfaces. Nevertheless, a small pore around one single beta-sheet in the center of the PPI interaction
area could be exploited as a weak point that may perturb the interface equilibrium. Using UniProt,
which contains information about a number of confirmed mutations, we determined the relative
potencies of PPI binding residues, identifying those that would likely affect the integrity of the complex
(Fig. 2). Residues K353 and Y41, which interact with D155 at the center of the PPI, are likely stabilizing
its surface, potentially forming a useful “hot spot” for targeted druggability (Fig. 2-3,S2).
To check whether this is true and to understand how Ace2:S-protein cooperation functions, we
performed two MD simulations, one with and one without the mutation of Y41A. This mutation causes
strict inability to form the S-protein:Ace2 complex. Analysis of the trajectory of the wild-type protein,
which possessed an intact complex, revealed the three most stable conformations of the “hot spot”
region with expanded pores inside the triangle of residues K353, D155, Y41. Since it is impossible to
determine which of these three conformations is the most stable, we ran three high-throughput
screenings based on the donor-acceptor atoms and hydrophobic areas of the region. We then
performed three MD simulations with top pose ligands. As demonstrated in Figure 3K, ligands failed

binding within 10 ns, while docked ligands became leaders, as determined by energetic stability, during
MD and interaction energy values (electrostatic – red, Van der Waals - blue) (Fig. 3J/L).
B. Identification of predicted inhibitors to interrupt S-protein:Ace2 PPI via docking
To identify inhibitors of the S-protein:Ace2 interaction via docking, we used the best scoring compounds
obtained after combination of molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations, which feeds into
the pipeline for constraint-based screening. The high-throughput screening (HTS) of a PPI library did
not produce any results, since the PPI binding sites were weakly identified shallow regions (Fig. 2,4AD,S1). Compounds that made good insertion into the sites situated between Ace2 and S-protein were
able to perturb the association of S-protein with Ace2 via steric hindrance of S-protein association (Fig.
3). From the MDS, we detected compounds that decreased energy of stability between the Ace2:Sprotein complex, which is desired in an inhibitor of protein-protein interaction. As a whole, this approach
identified a deep and narrow binding site to disturb the S-protein interaction with Ace2 (Fig. 3,4A-D).
C. Tmprss2 and Mpro modeling requires dynamics to reveal optimal inhibitor binding
To optimize the binding site of our inhibitors, we constructed a full-length (zymogen) model of Tmprss2
(epitheliasinogen), as well as a mature version of the protease (epitheliasin), as described in our
method section (Fig. 4E-G). The mature protease model was used for MDS studies to generate a
reference dynamical profile that can be used to assist in silico screening of Tmprss2 inhibitors. A
control experiment was also completed with the uncleaved (non-catalytic) form of Tmprss2 to
demonstrate the pocket's instability and poor ligand binding capacity (Fig. S3) (Ko et al., 2015; Lucas et
al., 2014; Wilson et al., 2005). A full-length model of monomeric Mpro was also constructed, as well as a
homodimer (Fig. 4H-K,S1). The structure derived from PDB code 6Y2F with its ligand was used for a
consensus virtual screen (Zhang et al., 2020). In addition, we used the dimer to generate a reference
dynamical profile to assist with in silico screening and study its interdomain behavior.
D. Tmprss2 inhibitors identified
We acquired the dimer protein sequence from the UniProt database. BLAST search showed the
highest identification values against factor XI, prothrombin, kallikrein proteases (~41-42%). However,
we focused on ligands that could be active against active form of Tmprss2 protein. Thus, we found the
ligand:
(2s)-1-[(2r)-2-(Benzylsulfonylamino)-5-Guanidino-Pentanoyl]-N-[(4Carbamimidoylphenyl)methyl]pyrrolidine-2-Carboxamide, contained within the ChemblDB repository
(CHEMBL1229259) and active against Tmprss2, prothrombin, and Factor XI. Likewise, another docked
model was recovered with macrocyclic ligand (CHEMBL3699198), called: Ethyl14-[[(E)-3-[5-chloro-2(tetrazol-1-yl)phenyl]prop-2-enoyl]amino]-5-(methoxycarbonylamino)-17-oxo-8,16
diazatricyclo[13.3.1.02,7]nonadeca-1(18),2(7),3,5,15(19)-pentaene-9-carboxylate. We launched several
molecular dynamics simulations (up to 75 ns of duration) to understand the interaction with the target
protein-binding site. Figure S3 shows the initial and stable/final states of our various models (Fig. 4EG). The MD analysis provided useful results for selecting the appropriate model. After 15 ns MD, the
putative binding site collapsed (Fig. S3,4E-G). Although the active form of thrombin was used for
Tmprss2 modeling, as a negative control we also examined the region with prothrombin-based binding
site for completeness of the docking study (Fig. S3). The overlay of the average homology model
structure from MD and structure 3F68 (PDB code) was used as a template to compare protein-ligand
interaction map and assign docking constraints (Baum et al., 2009). Two optimal inhibitors for Tmprss2
were selected for demonstration purpose in Figure 5. We also modeled Cathepsins L and K for
preliminary work, since these can be implicated in late-endosomal entry of the virus (Fig. S4).
E. Mpro inhibitors identified
For the viral main proteinase, Mpro, a key enzyme for coronavirus replication (SARS-CoV-2), and a
potential target for anti-SARS drug development, several peptidomimetics synthetized in early 2012
against SARS-CoV-1 proteases were identified as selective. There is a high degree of sequence

identity between the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. This means that SARS-focused ligands
could form similar interaction map with Mpro protein and offers good launching points for 3DQSAR/Machine Learning-drive based drug design for future iterations. To perform the virtual screening,
protein structure was taken from the PDB code 7BQY complex and significant attention was paid to the
interaction between the crystallized ligand from the complex and protein-binding site (Jin et al., 2020)
(Fig. 6). As the binding site is quite large (Fig. 6A) we used a set of additional crystal structures (PDB
code 6Y2F and fragment-like compounds from https://www.diamond.ac.uk/) to narrow the source of
possible conformations. The binding of the compounds inserted into this region demonstrated a very
canonic and recurring interacting motif, represented with α-Keto amide group flanked with aliphatic or
saturated rings. We then performed molecular dynamics of 75 ns for the ligand-free dimer structure of
the Mpro to evaluate and “catch” the most flexible elements of the binding site. Our simulation revealed
that the extended binding pocket was not very stable, unlike its individual sub-pocket, which contains
active cysteine (C145) residue (Fig. 6B,6C). We began our molecular docking after assigning several
combinations of constraints that should define specific interactions with the protein-binding site. We
performed several high-throughput screening procedures using the same set of features in different
combinations of constraints by partial matching algorithm (Fig. 6D-E). We then ranged docking scores
and compared obtained conformations inside the binding site with the co-crystalized ligands from
7BQY, 6Y2F structures to select the most potent compounds.
II. Analysis of Identified Compounds
By disrupting the SARS-CoV-2 viral process in three different critical routes: Binding, Entry, and
Replication with our virtual screening approaches against dynamic structures, we were able to identify
350 compounds (Dataset S1) and compile data reflecting physiochemical and chemoinformatic
properties. An exemplar top hit from each target is summarized for docking score in Table 1. To
classify the compounds and their chemical space, we completed various regression, K-means analyses
and fingerprint measurements, and provide further details about their structures and properties,
including commonly evaluated traits: MW, HBA, HBD, docking score, Rule of Three (Jorgensen), Rule
of Five (Lipinksi), logPo/w, and logS (Dataset S2). We focused on new compound searches. The MW for
these initial screening compounds ranges from large fragment (~250 Da) to mature drug sized
molecules (~500 Da) with only 10 of the 310 top scoring compounds being over 500 Da in size and the
smallest fragment-based compound measured 178 Da. Overall the docking scores were very good with
median around -7 kcal/mol using the Glide XP calculations. We also generated a list of most commonly
related drugs and discuss some of our best hits to known and clinical trial drugs (Dataset S3). The
general process for pruning the >30 million total chemical fragments and compounds from
commercially available compounds for the initial round of virtual screening is described (Fig. 1B), which
reduces the primary large set to 3 million per conformation of target.

As an example, when examining some prototype compounds from our selected dataset of >300 NCEs
screened from >10 million total compounds, we find the predicted interactions between drug and
protein (Table S2) have some common binding modalities. When looking at the dynamical data for the
drugs binding to the protein-protein site on Ace2, we find the RMSD, RMSF, and H-bond occupancy
evidence strong binding capability, as calculated from three separate simulations of Ace2 with different
ligands, referred to as 300, 392, and 488 (Fig. 4,S1). These observations can be applied to generate
constraints for additional virtual screening to improve the performance at higher throughput. Based on

these results, ligand 392 reduced the overall RMSD and per residue RMSF, while maintaining strong
hydrogen bonds, as demonstrated by its greater occupancy during the simulation (Table S1). This
information, particularly H-bond occupancy and modulation of interface residue RMSFs, can be used in
conjunction with docking and other data to profile the compounds more thoroughly (Fig. 4). In some
cases, where constraints were utilized, the docking score underrepresents the compound and testing is
needed to get important single-point data to clarify actives from non-actives, as well as determine the
real IC50s for the selected active compounds. We will enrich our dataset with the top compounds for
future rounds of parallel chemical screening and eventual de novo chemical design for novel chemical
entities. Current results of our approach are presented on all three targets (Ace2, Tmprss2, MPro).
III. Screening FDA-approved drugs for repurposing to minimize delay towards clinical benefit
For each of our targets, we screened for hits from a library of FDA-approved compounds alongside the
more extensive library of NCEs. Our final result across all three targets identified a total of 350 specific
compounds, with 167 against Ace2, 40 against Tmprss2, and 103 against Mpro. Among these are FDAapproved drugs that could be repurposed: 21 against Ace2, 11 against Tmprss2, and 8 against Mpro
(Supplemental Dataset TableS1_topNCE-FDA-hits.xlsx).
A. Ace2 Repurposing Drugs (FDA set)

effects and prevent overgrowth of harmful bacteria. Metaproterenol is a bronchodilator (beta-2 receptor
agonist) that is commonly used to treat a variety of respiratory disorders including asthma, COPD,
bronchitis and wheezing associated with viral pneumonias in clinical practice. The novelty of this drug is
that is aerosolized and can be given as a breathing treatment and similar reach the lungs, which have a
tremendous surface area and enter the blood rapidly. By inhalation this drug acts rapidly and potentially
with or in combination with other aerosolized drugs or oral or IV combination drugs. Its inhalational

Metaraminol bitartrate, a stereoisomer of meta-hydroxynorephedrine, is a potent sympathomimetic
amine. This drug is used in patients with hypotension or low blood pressure. COVID-19 hospitalized
patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting often need vasopressor agents to raise blood pressure
in a condition called shock (dangerously low blood pressure) from COVID-19 disease or sepsis.
Therefore, metaraminol has dual purpose of antiviral function at Ace2 docking site /entry as well as
helping with systemic blood pressure in those acutely ill COVID-19 patients. This drug has immediate
repurposing use in this patient population.

B. Mpro Repurposing Drugs (FDA set)

outside FDA purview since supplements and generally have a wide safety margin that will be tested on
the multidrug platform. Epicatechine S5105 is a naturally occurring flavonoid found in chocolate with

DISCUSSION
Clinical Unmet Need for COVID-19 Acute Therapeutics
There is a critical unmet patient need for therapeutics to treat the acute phase of COVID-19 disease
now and for the future. Efforts to create and trial a vaccine are underway, but 11.6 million patients are
confirmed infected globally (>540K deaths) with 25% infected within the United States and we are just
at the midpoint of 2020. Therefore, there is an urgent need to rapidly speed drug discovery from the
bench to the bedside. In order to accelerate drug discovery, translation and human application, a
design funnel using high-powered artificial intelligence is needed to screen millions of compounds
against macromolecular mechanistic targets against the virus. At the back end of this funnel 40 drug
candidates emerged, many of which may represent repurposing candidates for use in humans due to
known safety and tolerability profiles. However, the approach with the highest probability of overall
clinical therapeutic success may be not a single drug therapy for this viral RNA disease but rather a

multi-pronged drug approach gleaned from decades of HIV-AIDS epidemic research. A multidrug
approach for HIV has improved survival, markedly reduced viral loads, and vastly improved
management of the disease by preventing AIDS end-stage fatal complications. We therefore suggest
that a multifaceted drug approach for SARS-Cov-2 may prove superior by attacking 3 viral entry and
replication cycle sites simultaneously: Ace2 receptor docking site and entry, Tmprss2 endosomal
packaging, and MPro viral replication. Multiple drug targets for each of the 3 sites also allow
permutations and optimization for combinatorial success.
Comparison of FDA compounds identified from other recent screening
A recent study that screened commercially available >10,000 clinical-staged and FDA-approved small
molecules against SARS-CoV-2 in a cell-based assay (Riva et al., 2020) identified interesting
compounds for alternative targets that complement our results. These FDA approved compounds
included MDL-28170, a selective Cathepsin B inhibitor; VBY-825, a non-specific Cathepsin B, L, S, V
inhibitor; Apilimod, an inhibitor of production of the interleukins IL-12 and IL-23; Z-LVG-CHN2, a tripeptide derivative inhibitor for cysteine proteinases; ONO 5334, a selective Cathepsin K inhibitor; and
SL-11128, a polyamine analogs designed against E. cuniculi, a antimicrobial agents used as an
adjuvant treatment for opportunistic AIDS-associated infections. Overall these compounds are
Cathepsin-centric or antibiotic in nature, with little to no effect on our intended targets (Tmprss2, Ace2,
MPro). Additional top hits identified by Riva et al. include: AMG-2674, an AMGEN compound inhibitor of
TRPV-1 (Vanilloid Receptor); SB-616234-A that possesses high affinity for human 5-HT1B receptors;
SDZ 62-434 that strongly inhibited various inflammatory responses induced by lipopolysaccharide
(LPS) or function-activating antibody to CD29; Hafangchin A (also called "Tetrandrine"), a bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid, which acts as a calcium channel blocker; Elopiprazole an antipsychotic
drug of the phenylpiperazine class (antagonist at dopamine D2 and D3 receptors and an agonist at
serotonin1A receptors) that was never marketed; YH-1238, which inhibits dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) enzyme prolonging the action of the incretin hormones, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and
glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP); KW-8232, an anti-osteoporotic agent that can
reduce the biosynthesis of PGE2; Astemizole, an antihistamine; N-tert-butyl Isoquine (also called
"GSK369796"), an antimalarial drug candidate; and Remdesivir, a broad-spectrum antiviral medication
developed by the biopharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences. Again, none of these compounds were
geared toward targeting Tmprss2 or Mpro, and are also not specific to Ace2. While the lack of overlap
may be surprising, results generated by Riva and colleagues are not in opposition to our findings and
both approaches can complement each other. Most importantly, these approved FDA compounds can
be combined with our set of identified NCE (310 compounds) that have been demonstrated to have low
toxicity issues based on our chemoinformatics filtering (Fig. 1B). All NCE compounds identified were
chemical moieties that do not overlap any FDA drugs. Altogether, the data presented here
complements previously generated data and should help prioritize and rapidly identify safe treatments
for COVID-19. Future work will rely on advanced 3D-QSAR, fragment-based drug design principles for
de novo drug optimization.
Selective AI-SARS-Cov-2 Targeting and Drug Repurposing Data - Ace2, Tmprss2, Mpro
Among millions of potential COVID-19 drugs screened the majority of the final 40 drug candidates have
known medical use and/or FDA approval for a primary indication (e.g., hypertension, cardiac indication,
hyperlipidemia) with well-established patient safety and tolerability profiles from large phase III human
trials and post- market (Phase IV) analyses. These large human data provide both a clinically
significant and scientifically innovative window of opportunity to test 40 compounds on the multidrug
platform, and, in conjunction, observe longitudinal human survival outcomes of COVID-19 patients on
these drugs for comparative effectiveness within established and ongoing patient registries. An
emerging example of this important parallel is Ace2 pathway drugs (Ace inhibitors [AceI] and
angiotensin receptor blocking drugs [ARB]), which are increasingly observed in humans with COVID-19
to be associated with improved survival advantage (Jarcho et al., 2020; Mancia et al., 2020; Mehta et

al., 2020; Patel and Verma, 2020; Vaduganathan et al., 2020). However, there is a scientific knowledge
gap within human registries data regarding a scientifically robust and testable translational platform to
test mechanistic effects of these different molecular compounds. Therefore, creation of a “pandemic
platform” using newer technology of compound AI drug throughput screening combined with animal
multi-drug screening models creates an early Phase I/II safety, tolerability and early efficacy platform
which is rapidly needed to expedite bedside human use for COVID-19 pandemic, and as a platform that
can be used in future pandemics.
NCE set of compounds
A flurry of activity to identify compounds for SARS CoV-2 targets has been underway by academic labs
globally. Here in our approach we introduce our novel Maxwell's demon molecular dynamics method for
screening flexibility required to get rare and essential conformational transitions and pathways to find
the most likely druggable state. We also used our quantum docking technique (QM-driven adaptive
molecular dynamics scanning docking) (Caulfield, 2012) to identify compounds effective for targeting
Ace2, Tmprss2 and Mpro. The compounds identified by our large-scale in silico platform can next be
experimentally validated as binders for intended targets and for efficacy in models of the disease,
evaluated for EC50/safety-toxicity data, and carried into hit-to-lead and lead optimization in a drug
development pipeline. Structural studies such as X-ray crystallography will also be important to
generate structural SAR data for these efforts.
In sum, our leading edge in silico methods incorporating structural dynamics have produced a set of
350 candidate compounds suitable for screening in biological disease models. Among these, 40 FDAapproved compounds are eligible for rapid clinical trial testing. Additionally, our results bring forward
310 NCEs predicted to possess potency and specificity for viral or human accessory target proteins to
lower the viral load. Moreover, this resource offers the community a set of chemical tools to probe the
behavior of these enzymes essential for SARS-CoV-2 progression, namely, binding, entry and
replication. As SARS-CoV-2 is already endemic, the rapid identification of effective antivirals remains a
paramount focus until we have an efficient vaccine to provide long-lasting protection.

STAR*METHODS
I. General Modeling Methods
In general, COOT was used for building in missing residues and regularizing geometry (Emsley and
Cowtan, 2004; Emsley et al., 2010). More details for the preparation of each model are given in the
respective subsections. Since these structures were all used in downstream computational studies, a
uniform structural preparation was implemented. The full-length structures are comprised of all residues
and side chains. We added missing atoms in rotamers and de-clashed atoms, added missing residues
for chain continuity, and removed extraneous molecules/atoms (e.g. artifacts of crystallography or
alternative conformations of residues were removed (keeping the highest occupancy)), and the Bfactors were set to isotropic. The PDBePISA server was used to data mine the interface between Ace2
and S-protein (Krissinel and Henrick, 2007). Surface interactions data is provided (Supplemental).
Calculations on molecular dynamics trajectories including RMSD, RMSF, and H-bonds were performed
using VMD and internal tools thereof (RMSD trajectory tool and Tk Console). Prior to calculations, the
backbone (CONCα) atoms of each frame of the trajectories were aligned to the first frame as a
reference, to remove the effect of random rotation/translation. After alignment, the per residue average
of RMSF or RMSD per frame in Å across the entire MDS trajectory is given. For the Ace2-ligand
simulations, the number of hydrogen bonds between the protein and ligand were recorded for each
frame, and the occupancy of each specific H-bond is defined as the percentage of frames the bond is
present. RMSD, RMSF, and H-bond data were plotted in 2D format in Excel. The RMSF was also
appended to the beta column of the PDB and heat-mapped to the structure using a custom Tcl/Tk script
and PyMOL. All molecular graphics were generated in PyMOL (Mooers, 2016).
II. General Dynamics Conditions
Molecular Dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations were performed on the protein to allow local regional
changes for full-length structure for all acids of each structure.
The X-ray refinement for Monte Carlo was built using YASARA SSP/PSSM Method (Altschul et
al., 1997; Hooft et al., 1996a; Hooft et al., 1996b; King and Sternberg, 1996; Krieger et al., 2009; Qiu
and Elber, 2006). The structure was relaxed to the YASARA/Amber force field using knowledge-based
potentials within YASARA. The side chains and rotamers were adjusted with knowledge-based
potentials, simulated annealing with explicit solvent, and small equilibration simulations using
YASARA’s refinement protocol (Laskowski RA, 1993). The entire full-length structure was modeled,
filling in any gaps or unresolved portions from the X-ray.
Refinement of the finalized models was completed using either Schrodinger’s LC-MOD Monte
Carlo-based module or NAMD2 protocols. These refinements started with YASARA generated initial
refinement of Tmprss2 (Altschul et al., 1997; Hooft et al., 1996a; Hooft et al., 1996b; Krieger et al.,
2009). The superposition and subsequent refinement of each protein regions yields a complete model.
The final structures were subjected to energy optimization with PR conjugate gradient with an Rdependent dielectric.
Atom consistency was checked for all amino acids of the full-length wild-type structure, verifying
correctness of chain name, dihedrals, angles, torsions, non-bonds, electrostatics, atom typing, and
parameters. Model was exported to the following formats: Maestro (MAE), YASARA (PDB). Model
manipulation was done with Maestro (Macromodel, version 9.8, Schrodinger, LLC, New York, NY,
2010), or Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) (Humphrey et al., 1996).
MDS and MC searching were completed on each model for conformational sampling, using
methods previously described in the literature (Caulfield and Devkota, 2012; Caulfield and MedinaFranco, 2011; Caulfield, 2011; Caulfield et al., 2011). Briefly, each protein system was minimized with
relaxed restraints using either Steepest Descent or Conjugate Gradient PR, then allowed to undergo
the MC search criteria, as shown in the literature (Caulfield and Devkota, 2012; Caulfield and MedinaFranco, 2011; Caulfield, 2011; Caulfield et al., 2011). The primary purpose of MC, in this scenario, is
examining any conformational variability that may occur with each protein.

III. Structural modeling Ace2/S-protein
For Ace2/S-protein, PDB code 6VW1 was used to construct the model (Shang et al., 2020). While the
structure was mostly complete, chain F (S-protein) was missing more residues, though it had residue
Ala522. Chain E (S-protein) was only missing residue 522. Residue Ala522 was built into chain E using
COOT and where the extraneous molecules (solvent/cryoprotectant) and chains were deleted to leave
only the heterodimer Ace2/S-protein, which was processed to be used for computational studies, not to
generate a de novo model or complete structure with missing atoms and sections.
All information about the protein was found on the corresponding Uniprot page. After identifying the hot
spot residues using SiteMap or protein-protein interfaces, we used MD to find out how the Y41A
mutation can affect of PPI inhibition. We performed MD for wild type and mutated protein. Residual
mutation was also performed using PyMol's built-in tools. Gromacs 2018 and amber99 force field were
used to conduct MD and further analysis of the results (Baugh et al., 2011; Dilip et al., 2016; Janson et
al., 2017; Makarewicz and Kazmierkiewicz, 2013, 2016; Mooers, 2016). Visual inspection of every 10
frames allowed us to determine some tendency of structural deformation in a certain place on the
protein surface. According to the literature data and our finding, we focused on the predicted binding
site. Then, each trajectory was analyzed via the built-in clustering tool based on the RMSD distribution.
Three the most stable conformations of the binding site were chosen for the docking studies. All
received docking poses from each docking study were evaluated based on the docking scores,
interaction diagrams and solvent exposure. To make some prediction regarding the binding method, we
carried out another molecular dynamics simulation for the upper poses of each docking. After such a
confirmation of our assumptions, we selected the most powerful and accurate compounds from the
results of docking.
IV. Structural modeling Tmprss2
A homology model was constructed on the basis of prothrombin crystal structure in complex with the
ligand analog (PDB code 3F68) (Baum et al., 2009). We modeled the 492 amino acid Tmprss2 protein
two different ways: YASARA based and SwissModel server based (Krieger et al., 2002; Waterhouse et
al., 2018; Zoete et al., 2011). First, the YASARA based model begins with the FASTA sequence:
MALNSGSPPAIGPYYENHGYQPENPYPAQPTVVPTVYEVHPAQYYPSPVPQYAPRVLTQASNPVVCT

GVYGNVMVFTDWIYRQMRADG. Topological domains have the following characteristics: residues 1 –
84 forms the cytoplasmic sequence; residues 85 – 105 form the transmembrane domain region (helical
21 aa); and residues 106 – 492 form the Signal-anchor for type II membrane protein (extracellular),
where the protein as two main chains: non-catalytic chain (Met1-Arg225) and catalytic chain (Ile256Gly492), where each domain modeled as a separate unit built together in composite. Disulfide bonds
exist between several residues (113 ↔ 126), (120 ↔ 139), (133 ↔ 148), (172 ↔ 231), (185 ↔ 241),
(244 ↔ 365), (281 ↔ 297), (410 ↔ 426), (437 ↔ 465), which can be informative for building the
structure. Glycosylation sites are also possible at residues N213 and N249. Cleavage site (active)
exists between Arg255 and Ile256 (see refinement section).
The second method, homological modeling was performed using the SwissModel server after
performing a BLAST search on available protein structures in the RCSB database. Molecular dynamics
simulations of 100 ns of both, suggested and re-modeled protein structures, was performed with
GROMACS 2018 (Makarewicz and Kazmierkiewicz, 2013, 2016). Based on the structural analysis and
the generated Connolly surfaces, we identified critical changes in the binding site of the proposed
model and began creating a mesh for the binding site of the new homology model. Since our model

was based on the structure of thrombin, we used its co-crystallized ligand as a template for assigning
constraints and ensured we built the catalytically active state.
V. Structural modeling Mpro
For Mpro (PDB 6Y2F) co-crystallization with tert-butyl (1-((S)-1-(((S)-4-(benzylamino)-3,4-dioxo-1-((S)-2oxopyrrolidin-3-yl)butan-2-yl)amino)-3-cyclopropyl-1-oxopropan-2-yl)-2-oxo-1,2-dihydropyridin-3yl)carbamate (also referred to as alpha-ketoamide 13b) was used; the structure was also mostly
complete. Residues E47 and D48 were built in using COOT, where the other preparations previously
described were also performed. To build the missing residues, the coordinates and structure factors
were downloaded, generated 2mFo-DFc and FEM maps, and real space refine zone/regularize zone
were used to fit to electron density and optimize local geometry. The ligand (alpha-ketoamide 13b) was
left for usage as a cognate ligand for virtual screening.
The protein structure was initially studied using MD to find out if the binding site is cruel enough
or can break down without a ligand molecule during the simulation. Simulation of the dimeric complex
for 100 ns was sufficient to compare conformational changes from different MD states. A set of
positional and hydrogen bonds were assigned based on the available peptidomimetic structure. Thus,
two screenings were conducted with an emphasis on positional constraints or interactions of hydrogen
bonds.
VI. Structure-refinement of Ace2 (S-protein:Ace2), Tmprss2, and Mpro Models
Using MDS and MC refinement with Schrodinger and/or YASARA SSP/PSSM methods
(Altschul et al., 1997; Hooft et al., 1996a; Hooft et al., 1996b; King and Sternberg, 1996; Krieger et al.,
2009; Qiu and Elber, 2006), each structure was relaxed to the YASARA/Amber force field using
knowledge-based potentials within YASARA. The side chains and rotamers were adjusted with
knowledge-based potentials, simulated annealing with explicit solvent, and small equilibration
simulations using YASARA’s refinement protocol (Laskowski RA, 1993). The entire full-length structure
was modeled, filling in any gaps or unresolved portions from the X-ray structure.
Refinement of the finalized models was completed using either Schrodinger’s Monte Carlobased module or in-house protocols. These refinements started with generated initial refinement for
each independent structure (Altschul et al., 1997; Hooft et al., 1996a; Hooft et al., 1996b; Krieger et al.,
2009). The superposition and subsequent refinement of the overlapping regions yields a complete
model for all four proteins. The final structures were subjected to energy optimization with PR conjugate
gradient with an R-dependent dielectric.
Atom consistency was checked for all amino acids (and atoms) of the full-length wild-type
model, verifying correctness of chain name, dihedrals, angles, torsions, non-bonds, electrostatics, atom
typing, and parameters. A multimeric-complex model is predicted, including cofactors and ions. All of
the models were exported in the following formats Maestro (MAE), YASARA (PDB). Model
manipulation was done with Maestro (Macromodel, version 9.8, Schrodinger, LLC, New York, NY,
2010), or Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) (Humphrey et al., 1996). Analyses were emphasized on
the protein-protein interaction regions containing.
Monte Carlo dynamics searching (MC-search) was completed on each model for additional
conformational sampling, using methods previously described in the literature (Caulfield and Devkota,
2012; Caulfield, 2011; Caulfield et al., 2011). Briefly, each protein system was minimized with relaxed
restraints using either Steepest Descent or Conjugate Gradient PR, then allowed to undergo the MC
search criteria, as shown in the literature (Caulfield and Devkota, 2012; Caulfield, 2011; Caulfield et al.,
2011). The primary purpose of MC, in this scenario, is examining any conformational variability that
may occur with different orientations in the region near to protein-protein interfaces.
VII. MD Simulation Protocol
The total atomic force field was used to minimize the energy of the system, namely, the descent
algorithm for 20,000 steps with an iteration interval of 2 fs. The equilibrium of the solvent was carried

out using positional restrictions imposed on the atoms of protein structures, while the solvent molecules
remained mobile for all 100 ps. Each system was placed in a box in which the layer of the TIP3P water
molecule was 10 Å. The final systems were neutralized by the addition of Na + and Cl– ions to a
concentration of 150 mM. All simulations were performed under periodic boundary conditions using the
V-Rescale Thermostat algorithm to maintain temperature (310 K) and the Parrinello-Rahman Barostat
algorithm for constant pressure (1 bar) (Bussi et al., 2007; Parrinello and Rahman, 1981). Long-range
unrelated interactions were calculated using the Particle-Mesh-Ewald (PME) method (Abraham and
Gready, 2011). All molecules were relaxed with a molecular dynamics simulation of 100 ns. Ligand
topologies were created using the antechamber module from the AmberTools18 package (Case et al.,
2005).
VIII. DOCKING METHODS
A. Site Mapping on Proteins
We used SiteMapper (Bhachoo and Beuming, 2017) to identify possible binding sites for
docking affinity with the proteins Ace2 (allosteric site), Tmprss2, and Mpro. We also used our novel MDS
biasing technique algorithm, Maxwell’s demon MD, for searching within these sites for potential flexible
zones that would have beneficial peptide interactions, which served as a reductive filter limiting the total
number of possible sites screened on the proteins to those with adequately deep binding grooves
(Caulfield, 2011; Kayode et al., 2016) or interesting insertion sites (Ace2).
B. Glide Docking
Prior to the docking with the Ace2 (allosteric site), Tmprss2, and Mpro, we had completed
rigorous molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) and Monte Carlo (MC) conformational searching for
each model for additional conformational sampling, using methods previously described in the literature
(Caulfield and Devkota, 2012; Caulfield, 2011; Caulfield et al., 2011). The primary purpose of MC, in
this scenario, is examining any conformational variability that may occur with different orientations in
the region near to protein-protein interfaces.
Over three million compounds were docked to each site using the Glide XP docking program
(Bhachoo and Beuming, 2017). All compounds were accounted for using OPLS3 within Maestro
program (Maestro-9.4, 2014). Using our published docking protocols on each identified site, we
reductively scanned from 100s to the top 10 poses from each docking and then did cross-comparisons
of docking scores to retain only the top binding pose of each compound from each site in a winnertakes-all strategy.
C. Other Docking (positional constraints)
Each compound has been converted into a set of energy minimized three-dimensional shapes with the
Ligprep module. Without protein preparation, it was used for the correct distribution of protonation and
post-minimization in the OPLS3 force field. In the case of assigning restrictions based on ligands (Mpro,
Tmprss2), we tried to cover the most important and strong interactions. In the case of Ace2, a set of
constraints was generated in sufficient quantities to generate combinations of possible interactions.
Positional constrains (1.8 A radius) and h-bond constraints were generated in the Schrodinger Glide
module, namely in the mesh generation tool. Aromatic and hydrophobic features were represented with
short SMARTS. A partial matching protocol for applying constraints has also been used to improve
process accuracy. A high throughput screening protocol with regulated ligand flexibility was applied.
D. Docking Parameters
Each compound has been converted into a set of energy minimized three-dimensional shapes
with the Ligprep module. Without protein preparation, it was used for the correct distribution of
protonation and post-minimization in the OPLS3 force field. In the case of assigning restrictions based
on ligands (Mpro, Tmprss2), we tried to cover the most important and strong interactions. In the case of
Ace2, a set of constraints was generated in sufficient quantities to generate combinations of possible

interactions. Positional constrains (1.8 A radius) and h-bond constraints were generated in the
Schrodinger Glide module, namely in the mesh generation tool. Aromatic and hydrophobic features
were represented with short SMARTS. A partial matching protocol for applying constraints has also
been used to improve process accuracy. A high throughput screening protocol with regulated ligand
flexibility was applied.
Conformations of compound orientations were generated using our standard protocols
(Bhachoo and Beuming, 2017; Kalid et al., 2012; Unger et al., 2015). The starting conformation of
relaxed protein structures was first obtained by the method of Polak-Ribière conjugate gradient (PRCG)
energy minimization with the Optimized Potentials for Liquid Simulations (OPLS) 2005 force field
(Jorgensen, 2004; Jorgensen and Tiradorives, 1988) for 5000 steps, or until the energy difference
between subsequent structures was less than 0.001 kJ/mol-Å units. Our docking methodology has
been described previously (Caulfield and Devkota, 2012; Friesner et al., 2006; Loving et al., 2009;
Vivoli et al., 2012).
Briefly, compounds were docked within the Schrödinger software suite (Mohamadi et al., 1990)
using a virtual screening workflow (VSW) (Bhachoo and Beuming, 2017; Friesner et al., 2006;
Jacobson et al., 2002; Kalid et al., 2012; Kozakov et al., 2006). Alternative docking methods were also
employed, including in-house software techniques for top leads for SAR elucidation. The top seeded
poses were ranked and unfavorable scoring poses were discarded. Top favorable scores from initial
dockings yielded hundreds of poses with the top five poses retained. Molecular interactions of the
ligand-protein interfaces were used to help determine the optimal binding set, which included
descriptors were used to obtain atomic energy terms like hydrogen bond interaction, electrostatic
interaction, hydrophobic enclosure and π-π stacking interaction that result during the docking run.
Molecular modeling for importing and refining the proteins was completed (Maestro-9.4, 2014).
Examinations of structure stability were examined for all proteins investigated, S-protein:Ace2,
Tmprss2, and Mpro, respectively (Caulfield and Devkota, 2012; Caulfield and Medina-Franco, 2011;
Caulfield, 2011; Reumers et al., 2005; Schymkowitz et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2013). Object stability
was used to determine if any changes in structure that were deleterious to function from immediate
inspection, which the FoldX algorithm can provide, prior to docking studies. Thus, we examined the
local residues around the docking site and determined an electrostatic calculation may be useful to
explain the change in function. The molecular model for the full structure and its truncated form are
given (Fig. S1) using our state of the art methods, which have been established (Abdul-Hay et al.,
2013; Ando et al., 2017; Caulfield and Devkota, 2012; Caulfield and Medina-Franco, 2011; Caulfield,
2011; Caulfield et al., 2011; Caulfield et al., 2014; Caulfield et al., 2015; Fiesel et al., 2015a; Fiesel et
al., 2015b; Puschmann et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2013).
Local residues within the 12Å cutoff near docking sites were analyzed (Fig. S1-S2). Any
interactions requiring inducible fit, or Threonine/Serine hydroxyl rotation or other docking parameter (πstacking/halogen-directionality) were also included. Mapping electrostatics was accomplished using the
Poisson-Boltzmann calculation for solvation on all amino acids for each docked structure (Caulfield and
Devkota, 2012; Caulfield and Medina-Franco, 2011; Caulfield, 2011; Reumers et al., 2005;
Schymkowitz et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2013)
E. Libraries used
Compounds were derived from either a set of all FDA approved and clinical tested compounds,
bioactive set of compounds, or a large multi-million compound set from ZINC database. In the all cases
the libraries were prepared using LigPrep described above. The ZINC database was pruned using
parameters for better drug-like profile and removal of reactive functional groups and poor
chemoinformatics properties delivering a large set suitable for screening on all targets across dynamic
time points from MDS.

binding site of ACE2 (salmon) and ligand 300 (blue) with residues and polar contact distances labeled.

(G) Ligand Interaction Diagram rendered with Maestro for ACE2 with ligand 300 at the
allosteric site impacting S-protein binding from SAR-CoV2. This 2D "flat" representation shows
the interactions at this particular compounds interface on Ace2 that would interfere with S
protein binding. In particular, extending from deeply inserted to superficial, the interactions are
described in the subsequent sentences. D382 and D350 are hydrogen bond acceptors (side
chains) from the opposite NH+ on the piperazine-like ring deeply inserted into the binding
pocket. R393 is a hydrogen bond donor (side chain) to the alcohol group connecting the
piperazine-like ring to the fused ring. E37 is a hydrogen bond acceptor (side chain) to one of
the NH on the fused ring. The fluorocyclohexane group is entirely solvent-exposed at the
mouth of the binding pocket.

Figure S2 Glycosylation sites of Ace2 protein (D616G highlighted red).
Although glycosylation sites at residues N165, N234, N343 from S-protein (PDB
code 6VSB), are nearby the ACE2:S-protein binding interface, they do not overlap
and interfere with the protein-protein interface, offering an adjacent site is readily
available for PPI docking (S-prot glycosylation analysis: DOI:
10.1126/science.abb9983; 10.1101/2020.04.29.069054}. The majority of
glycosylation sites are not on the RBD (Fig. S2), the glycosylation site that is
actually present on the RBD, N343, is not in 3D proximity to the binding interface.
Recently, a variant of the S-protein, D614G, was identified to possess enhanced
transmissibility and resistance to contemporary interventions and this site is not
present on the RBD. Neither the glycosylation sites, nor the enhanced
transmissibility variant D614G, are within the 3D proximity to the drug binding site
for our targeted protein-protein interface disrupting therapeutics for Ace2.

Figure S3. Gradually crumbling binding site. (A) Initital and (B) Final states - of the
protein model, while catalytically active state has better preserved binding site.
Prothrombin binding site (PDB 3F68) with its inhibitor (C) and the final state of
Prothrombin (D) are shown. Again, Prothrombin binding site (3F68) with its inhibitor
(E) and proposed structural model – a prothrombin-based homology model of
TRPMSS2 (F), which looks more accurate then previous (B) model structure. This
version maintains structural stability and is good candidate for drug docking with
ligands. Purple spheres are constraints used to impose good relative positioning.

Figure S4. Proteases cathepsin L and K can be also used in blocking ENTRY of
COVID-19 during late-endosome progression. Top panel. Structures for cathepsin K
(PDB code: 4N8W, green) and cathepsin L (PDB code: 2YJB, cyan), shown with an
inhibitor (blue). The active site residues are colored maroon. These represent additional
host protease targets at another stage of the viral entry cycle. Bottom panel. Same as top
but rotated 180°. Cathepsins K and L represent additional host protease targets at another
stage of the viral entry cycle. Future efforts and alternative methods on our part may involve
discovering effective compounds to exploit this point of intervention in synergy with our
other therapeutics. In anticipation of this, we have already constructed models of both of
these cathepsins, which exhibit remarkable structural homology with each other. For
cathepsin K, 4N8W.pdb {PMID: 25422423} was used as a base from which to construct the
model, and 2YJB.pdb {PMID: 21898833} was used for cathepsin L.
