Abstract
By fitting a compartment ODE model for Covid-19 propagation to cumulative
case and death data for US states and European countries, we find that the case
mortality rate seems to have decreased by at least 80% in most of the US and at least
90% in most of Europe. These are much larger and faster changes than reported in
empirical studies, such as the 18% decrease in mortality found for the New York City
hospital system from March to August 2020 [1]. Our reported decreases surprisingly
do not have strong correlations to other model parameters (such as contact rate) or
other standard state/national metrics such as population density, GDP, and median
age. Almost all the decreases occurred between mid-April and mid-June, which
unexpectedly corresponds to the time when many state and national lockdowns
were released resulting in surges of new cases. Several plausible causes for this drop
are examined, such as improvements in treatment, face mask wearing, a new virus
strain, and potentially changing demographics of infected patients, but none are
overwhelmingly convincing given the currently available evidence.

Introduction
A novel strain of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, causing Covid-19 disease, was identified in
December 2019 by Chinese Health authorities in the city of Wuhan (Hubei), China [2, 3].
This disease has spread worldwide and many governments instituted measures to contain
its outbreak, including city and state lockdowns and prohibiting travel from affected areas
[4]. However, such restrictions are difficult to sustain in the long term, with millions of
people being affected by poverty and unemployment [4]. As a result, many nations have
eased population restrictions as of May 2020 to lessen the economic impact of the disease
[4, 5, 6]. A global pandemic is ongoing, with over 40 million worldwide cases and 1.1
million deaths as of October 18, 2020 as declared by the World Health Organization
1

(WHO) [7]. Currently, several European nations are considering reimposing lockdowns
and mobility restrictions to contain the surging virus cases [8].
Surprisingly, despite the large increases in Covid-19 cases in the United States and
Europe since many countries and States eased lockdowns [8, 9], the number of deaths due
to this virus has not mirrored the dramatically increased case counts. Though this trend
has been noted by political and health commentators [10, 11, 12], there are few mentions
of any change of death rates in the epidemiological and modeling literature. Clinical
observations of a continually decreasing death rate have been made in a New York City
hospital system, with a rate that had dropped by 18.2 percent from March to August [1].
Corroborating this, time-series generated for a model-based study of Covid-19 in New
York City imply that the infection-fatality risk dropped by approximately 13 from early
April to late May 2020 for people 65 years of age or older, whereas it barely changed
for people less than 45 (fluctuations in the rate for the 45–64 years old group make the
net effect difficult to ascertain) [13]. Similarly, a review of English hospital surveillance
data found that the survival of hospitalized Covid-19 patients in intensive care and high
intensive units increased by approximately 11% per week from late March up to the
third week of June 2020 [14]. This study notes that these improvements in survival were
consistent across subgroups defined by age, ethnicity, and major co-morbidites, among
others [14]. While these observations are consistent with our own, possible underlying
causes were not described in these reports.
By fitting a compartmental ODE disease model to state and national case and death
data we have been able to measure changes in the case mortality rate across entire jurisdictions for all US states plus Washington DC and Puerto Rico, and all European
countries (except Russia) plus Turkey. Our finding is that in most of these jurisdictions
the death rate for diagnosed individuals decreased dramatically (≈ 80% in the US and
90% in Europe), and almost all jurisdictions had a decrease of at least 30%. These decreases happened largely in late April, May, and early June as many jurisdictions were
easing lockdowns which resulted in surging cases. Having checked several quantitative
regional factors that could influence these fatality rates, including basic age demographics, population density, geographical location, and certain economic indicators, we have
surprisingly not found strong correlations to the magnitude of the drop in death rate, or
the initial or final death rates individually. Several plausible causes for this dramatic drop
are examined, such as improvements in treatment, face mask wearing, a new virus strain,
and potentially changing demographics of infected patients, but none alone convincingly
explain the magnitude of change we have measured given the currently available evidence.

Calculating the Changes in Death Rate
To calculate the change in death rate we used a slightly modified version of the compartment model first presented in [15]. This is a SIR-based ODE model that includes
extra compartments and transfer rates to deal with: detected versus undetected infecteds,
isolation on diagnosis, effects of social distancing policies, and possible loss of immunity
for recovered populations (both detected and undetected). As well, it uses a power-law
incidence rate to adjust for the effect of heterogeneous population densities. While this
model could have many uses, our original purpose was to try to measure what proportion of infecteds were eventually being detected (our finding: about half in almost all
jurisdictions).

Figure 1: Schematic of the compartments – S susceptible, IU undetected infected, ID
detected infected, D detected deceased, Q sequestered, RU undetected recovered, and
RD detected recovered. Transfer between compartments are indicated by arrows, where
the detection rate δ and detected death rate γ are highlighted. Note that RU and RD are
also transferred back to S at a particular rate due to loss of immunity. This is a small
effect over the time scales we have considered here, therefore arrows were omitted for the
sake of clarity.
As one can see in figure 1, there is also a compartment for deaths of detected infected
individuals. This was not necessary for the model per se; deaths are not part of the
basic SIR model, which is static, and we did not include a compartment for deaths of
undetected infecteds either. However, deaths due to COVID-19 are a readily available
statistic, and possibly more trustworthy than caseloads. So on the assumption that the
proportion of serious-enough-to-be-diagnosed cases which are fatal is relatively stable
aspect of disease over the longer term, we added to detected deaths to the model to
aid in its use for fitting to empirical data. Note: we were aware that case mortality
rate in early days of any outbreak is often large, because of unfamiliarity of disease, and
seriousness of first few diagnosed cases; but this tends to drop quickly, and the numbers
of cases as a proportion of those eventually infected is small, so this transient effect did
not affect our fits.
Coding of the ODE solutions and fitting routines were done in Matlab [15], with
empirical data (cumulative cases and deaths, for the US by county, and globally by nation)
obtained from Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering [16].
Since the model is non-linear, fitting requires an iterative search through the solution
space, so there is no guarantee of obtaining optimal solutions within any set running
time, but we found that with various adjustments to the fit parameters we were able to
get good fits for all US states within a couple of hours (the criterion we use for goodness
of fit was that the coefficient of determination R2 >= 0.95). We were also able to fit
all European countries Covid-19 case and death data (except Russia) using the same
optimized code with similar results.
In the late summer of 2020 we started submitting predictions obtained from our model
to the COVID-19 ForecastHub on GitHub [cite TBA]. When checking the results of 1month-ahead death predictions, they seemed to be quite high, given that contemporary
measures of deaths for various jurisdictions [10] were not showing spiking activity (though
the recent new spikes in cases at the time suggested that deaths should be on the rise
too). The problem was that the empirical (and therefore model) deaths were small in
number compared with confirmed cases, so discrepancies between the model deaths and
data were not readily apparent to visual inspection or the error criterion used by the fit
routine, as can be seen from figure 2.
However, a closer look at the death curves alone revealed that while the error level was

within the desired tolerance, the residuals were not (more-or-less) randomly distributed
across time, but showed a distinct bias, undershooting during the first half of the fit period
and overshooting at later times, so the fit curve missed the contour actually described by
the death data – see figures 3 for residuals and 4 (c) and (d) for closeups of the fits. This
caused the slope of the model deaths at the end of the fit period to be greater than that
implied by the empirical data, so that model projections of deaths into the fairly near
future would overestimate the number significantly. Since this had not been a problem
earlier, the implication was that the cumulative deaths were no longer shadowing the
cumulative case count.
The solution was to make a simple modification of the model (and code) to incorporate
a second death rate, with a changeover at a specific date. We then have two death rates,
γ1 and γ2 , plus a time parameter tγ specifying changeover day (from beginning of fit
period). In the implementation of the ODE’s, the rate changes linearly from γ1 to γ2
across 4 weeks centered on tγ . As well, in the fitter the death data is weighted to give it
more emphasis in relation to the confirmed case data. All other aspects of the model and
implementation were kept as is; i.e. all other rates (except for the already time-varying
sequestration rate q) stay constant, and no change was made to the methodology with
respect to solving the ODE’s or non-linear minimization used by the fitter [15]. The
result is that the model confirmed case curves are practically identical to before, while
the model death curve now falls quite precisely over the empirical data points – see figure
4.
Checking single death rate fits done at the beginning of September against empirical
data going up to September 25, we find that deaths in both the US and Europe would
be overestimated by approximately 50% in both cases (a 98,000 overcount for the US,

and a 118,000 overcount for Europe), while the two-rate version only misses by 9 and 2%
respectively.

Results
To obtain our results model fits were done on 52 US jurisdictions (all states, plus Washington DC and Puerto Rico), and on 49 European zone countries (i.e. all Europe proper
except for Russia, plus Turkey). The fit period was Jan 22 to Sept 2 for Europe and Jan
22 to Sept 11 for the US. Each fit provided the two death rates and a changeover time
(in days from the start of the fit period, Jan 22 2020); percent change from γ1 to rate γ2
1
was calculated as well (100 × γ2γ−γ
). See tables 4 and 5 in the Appendix for a full listing
1
of rates, changeover day, and percent change for each US state and European country
studied. Since the death rates apply only to detected infecteds, these can be seen as
roughly equivalent to a very smoothed version of the case mortality rate, with weighting
by current caseload – see figure 6. Note that the empirical measures see a very high rate
with a very large drop in the early days of the outbreak when only a handful of seriously
ill people have been diagnosed, while any subsequent changes in the underlying rate are
difficult to ascertain from the still fairly large day-to-day fluctuations.
We start with the rates themselves (see table 1). The initial death rate for detected
infecteds is approximately 1% in Europe and 1.5% in the US, which is consistent with,
if on low side of, values being hypothesized/calculated in March/April of this year [17].

These go to approximately 1.5 per 1000 and 3 per 1000 respectively, a 5- or 6-fold drop.
The changeover time in the fit period corresponds to the dates May 18 in Europe and
May 15 in the US. As the standard deviation of the changeover time implies, most of the
drops occurred within the period between mid-April and mid-June. Figure 7 shows how
all the rates and changeover times are distributed. It is somewhat surprising that the
second death rate γ2 is much more narrowly distributed than the first death rate γ1 , and
we have no explanation for this phenomenon.
Change in death rate. While it is to be expected that the case mortality rate of
a disease will drift downward over time as medical treatments improve [18, 19, 20], both
the relatively tight timing and magnitude of the change in death rates are noteworthy;
we see a decrease of approximately 90% across Europe and 80% across the US within a
2-month period. Table 2 shows various statistics related to this drop (the value of the
skewness measure most likely reflects the fact that -100% is a sharp cutoff on the low end
of the range of possible changes). Figure 8 gives maps of the US and Europe color-coded
by the drop in rates and the changeover day; in the former particularly we see that the
countries of western Europe for the most part saw large decreases, while eastern Europe
is more variable. We also observe that US outliers with large positive changes in death
rate are in the east. While there are clusters for the day of death rate change in Europe
and the US, no clear pattern is apparent.
Outliers. Not all jurisdictions saw decreases in death rates according to the measurement derived from out model. In the US three states, New Hampshire, New Jersey, and
Rhode Island had increases, of 119, 235, and 55% respectively. We note that New Jersey
and Rhode Island had relatively late dates for the effective release from lockdown in comparison with other states, as measured by the model (June 16 and July 11 respectively).

changeover time (in days since January 22, 2020).
Mathematically, since these states did not open up at the same time as the others, their
cases did not start rising dramatically again in the early summer, so the denominator
defining the case mortality rate stayed relatively low.
In Europe the outliers break down into two different groups. In the first case we have
the Faroe Islands, Gibraltar, and Latvia, which had effectively no deaths in the period
before the measured changeover (Faroe Islands and Gibraltar apparently had no deaths
whatsoever during the entire fit period); in this case the astronomical positive changes
in rate are merely an artifact of the extremely low initial rates given by the fitter. It
should be noted that Latvia’s neighbor Estonia had no recorded deaths in the period
after changeover, and so achieved a 100% drop; this suggests that the death statistics in
the Baltic states may themselves be an issue.
The second group of European outliers – Belarus (331% increase), Kosovo (78%), and
Serbia (30%), like the US outliers, are more perplexing. The latter two were of course
famously involved in a violent conflict in the 1990’s; all three are not members of the EU.
Aside from that we can note that these countries had relatively late outbreaks (with first
deaths recorded on March 22, March 29, and April 28 respectively), resulting in a later
surge of cases and deaths.
Correlations. One may ask if there is a relation between the measured changes in
death rates and various other metrics. However, with one rather trivial exception (to be
discussed below) we found no strong correlations of the drop to either model-related quantities or a number of readily available state/national statistics; though admittedly, our
search through national databases was not exhaustive. All correlations discussed below
were calculated using Matlab’s corrcoef function, which gives the Pearson correlation
coefficient.
The first place to look is within the model parameters themselves, and quantities
derived from either the raw data or projections based on the fits. Across multiple fits
we would expect some rates to move in tandem or opposition to others, and indeed, for
both Europe and the US we see that the SIR-based contact rate has a strong negative

correlation (< −0.9) with both the recovery rate for undetected infecteds and the detection rate, as well as a slightly weaker positive correlation (> 0.67) with the severity
of the first social distancing intervention. In fact, one model parameter does correlate
strongly with the drop in the death rate: the second death rate itself (0.72 for Europe,
0.97 US), which is hardly surprising. However, no other rates or data derived quantities
had an absolute correlation > 0.5 for either the US or Europe, and only a scattering had
the absolute correlation > 0.33; these latter all had different signs for the European and
US fits, indicating that the relation was not particularly robust despite the magnitude.
Only three model related quantities other than the second death rate had absolute correlations ≥ 0.1 with same sign for the US and Europe: loss of immunity rate (negative),
initial condition (proportion of population infected on day 1 of fit period, negative), and
proportion of unknown recovereds on last day of fit period (positive). In all these cases
the absolute correlation was < 0.22, so rather weak.
Since the correlations to standard state/national statistics may be of more general
interest, these are given in table 3. As with the model parameters, most correlations
here are quite weak and have different signs between Europe and the US; only longitude
has non-trivial (though not strong) correlations of the same sign, which is apparent from
figure 8(a) showing consistently larger drops in percent death rate change in Western
Europe than Eastern Europe. As mentioned above, we did not check many other possible quantities (eg. educational attainment, per capita health care expenditures, etc.)
since each requires finding and converting new data extraneous to our main project; in
particular, certain epidemiological data, such as COVID-19 testing rate (which is itself
time-varying), might yield interesting results with more intensive comparison techniques.
Note that correlations between the individual death rates and changeover day with the
other model parameters and state/national statistics were also calculated, and as well
did not show any strong or surprising correlations (data not shown).
Counterfactual Scenario. Our implementation allowed us to run counterfactual
simulations to test various suppositions by rerunning the ODE solver on the model with
changed parameter values. By suppressing the second death rate, we are able to estimate
what the deaths outcome would be if no change in rate had occurred. Figure 9 shows
plots of deaths data, model fits, and counterfactual projections for Europe and the US.
As one would expect, if the rate had not changed the number of deaths by September 25
would have been much greater, more than triple in the US (from ≈ 204,000 to 706,000)

cumulative confirmed cases was minimal, we have not shown these plots.

Discussion and Conclusions
There are several factors expected to affect fatality rates over the course of a pandemic.
Improvements in medical treatments are to be expected as knowledge about the disease
increases. For example, aggregated data suggests that transfusing (high anti-RBD IgG
titer) convalescent plasma early in the hospital course of Covid-19 patients significantly
reduces mortality by approximately 6% in comparison with control patients [18]. Additional independent studies have shown that administering tocilizumab (a recombinant
monoclonal antibody that can mitigate cytokine release syndrome) to patients admitted
to intensive care with Covid-19 have a 23% [19] and a 12% [20] reduction in mortality,
compared with patients receiving standard care. Importantly, a clinical outcomes study
reported that patients who presented in hospital with sufficient vitamin D levels (≥ 30
ng/ml) had reduced mortality rates by 10% in comparison with Covid-19 patients with
insufficient (< 30 ng/ml) vitamin D [27], which suggests that lowly toxic supplementation
and increased sun exposure can affect a population’s outcome. The studies above also
suggest that improvements in Covid-19 treatments since the start of the pandemic can
reduce a population’s overall mortality by at least 20%, which is a smaller factor than we
have measured.
It has also been suggested that mask wearing can reduce the mortality rate of Covid19 via two different means. First, a face mask worn by an infected person forms a
barrier for transmission of respiratory droplets to susceptible populations, thus reducing
transmissibility of the disease [28, 29]. It may be reasonable to expect that populations
with widespread mask usage and clear government guidelines may have a reduction in
contact rate β associated with policy implementation if the policy had been implemented
after occurrence of exponential growth in cases [30]. We have not observed the need
for such a reduction to fit cumulative cases in any country or state well. In any case,
while reduced case counts (if we had seen them) would result in fewer deaths overall,
this says nothing about deaths per case. But it is also possible that wearing a face mask
protects the wearer by reducing the SARS-CoV-2 inoculum that they are exposed to by
infected people [31]. Exposure to a low viral load may result in a less severe, possibly

asymptomatic, infection with a lower chance of fatality [32]. So it is still possible that
the changed Covid-19 death rates were have observed result from face mask wearing; the
YouGov online survey reporting tool demonstrates that self-reported face mask wearing
in public spaces in some European countries (Italy, Spain, France, and Germany) rapidly
increased to 80% of the population or more between late March and May 2020 [33]. A
similar trend is observed in the United States, where self-reported face mask wearing in
public places rose to 69% at the end of May 2020 [33]. However, self-reported face mask
wearing in the Nordic nations of Finland, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden did not exceed
20% of the population over the same time frame, and these nations also experienced very
large drops in death rate. This evidence strongly suggests that if wearing face masks is
a factor that affects the death rate change, it is not the only one.
It is also possible for a virus to acquire mutations that alter its infectivity and lethality
over time. Genomic analyses have demonstrated that the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2
has undergone an amino acid change from aspartic acid (referred to as D614) to glycine
(referred to as G614) in the carboxy-terminal region of the S1 domain [34, 35, 36]. The
very rapid spread of the G614 mutant throughout Europe and parts of the Americas,
monitored by Covid-19 genetic surveillance studies over time, suggests that it could be
more transmissible [34, 35, 36, 37]. One regional study conducted within a Houston
hospital system showed that the virus strains originally introduced into the city in March
2020 were diverse, with both D614 and G614 types represented, however sequences taken
during the much larger second wave that occurred in June 2020 were nearly all of the G614
type [38]. They found that patients with the G614 strains had higher nasopharyngial
viral loads upon diagnosis; however, the authors did not find evidence connecting virus
genotype with altered virulence [38]. Interestingly, a data correlation study found that
the G614 mutation corresponds to higher case fatality rates in several countries [39].
Given the available evidence, it seems likely that the highly prevalent G614 mutation is
not less deadly than previous strains, which leaves the distinct possibility that there is a
newer, less deadly mutation circulating.
Increasing testing can also significantly impact the case fatality rate of a disease,
since detecting increasing numbers of cases will increase the denominator of the case fatality rate, and possibly lead to earlier detection of a disease leading to earlier treatment
thereby also reducing mortality [40, 41]. While we are not aware of any studies examining correlations between the number of Covid-19 tests in time and case fatality rates,
several studies examining regional differences in fatality and testing have occurred. One
study comparing USA, Italy, UK, France, Spain, Sweden, and Germany found that case
fatality rates, normalized by the ratio of tests to total number of positive cases, tended to
cluster suggesting a correlation between mortality and testing rate [40]. A multivariable
statistical study of Covid-19 mortality in 196 countries found that a 10 times decrease in
per-capita testing was correlated with a 26% increase in per-capita mortality, though this
correlation was not found to be statistically significant [41]. Another statistical comparison of testing rates and mortality across French region borders found that performing
an additional 1000 tests would save one life [42]. Data available from the Johns Hopkins
University Coronavirus Resource Center [43] shows that US tests increased by approximately 12 times (from 0.1 to 1.2 million) from April through November 2020, suggesting
that increased testing may have played some role in the large death rate decrease we have
observed in nearly all US states and European countries.
It is also possible that the age demographics of people more recently afflicted with
Covid-19 have affected the mortality rate – particularly if more young people than elderly
12

have become infected – who tend to be much less likely to have severe disease [44]. Indeed,
an analysis of Covid-19 cases that occurred worldwide between February and July, 2020
revealed that the number of infected people 15-24 years old increased from 5% to 15%.
Cases of Covid-19 in the USA in people 18-22 years old increased by 55% from August 2Sept 5, 2020, and was highest among people between 20 and 29 years old, with more than
20% of the total cases, in contrast with March 2020 where Covid-19 incidence was highest
in people with ages over and including 60 years [45]. In conjunction with this trend, some
clinical reports indicate that Covid-19 has become less deadly across all age groups. It
was reported that the mortality rate, adjusted for changes in demographics, had dropped
by 18% in a New York city hospital system from March to August 2020 [1]. Similarly,
English hospital surveillance data found that the survival of Covid-19 patients in both
intensive care and high intensive units increased by approximately 11% per week from
late March through June 2020 across age, ethnicity, and major co-morbidity subgroups
[14]. Given these observations, it appears that changes in age demographics of Covid-19
incidence do not fully explain our observed change in mortality over time.
Lastly, we look at the possibility that the drop could be a statistical artifact caused
by changes in the way death data is recorded and collected. It should be noted, that we
(along with [10]) first noticed the change of death rate not as a drop in daily deaths versus
total population, but as persistence of the previous trend when surges in the number of
cases versus total population occurred after releases of lockdowns, where concomitant
surges in deaths were to be expected.
Data revision is common for many publicly maintained statistics, not only in medical
areas but also economics and demographics, since later figures often improve or correct
earlier ones, which may be based partly on estimates or incomplete surveys. With respect
to diseases or mortality, large upward revisions often gain public attention, since the
implication is of prior negligence or coverup. During the current Covid-19 pandemic a
couple of instances do leap out: China’s April revision upward by 1290 deaths (which
increased their then case mortality by 50%) [46], or Argentina’s massive correction at the
beginning of October [47].
There are legitimate reasons for changes in procedure that result in lower death counts
and subsequent downward revisions. Many jurisdictions initially logged all deaths of
Covid-19 infected individuals as deaths by Covid, presumably because in the early days
of the pandemic the exact range of co-morbidities had not been determined; when later
information is available to limit that range, non-Covid deaths of Covid-infected individuals can be placed in the appropriate category. This is the case for the UK revision in
August. Previously, the UK had been counting all deaths of Covid-infected people within
60 days as death by Covid-19, which was reduced to 28 days; applied retroactively, this
had the effect of reducing the UK Covid-19 death count by 5,377 (≈ 13% at the time) [48].
Similarly, Washington State, which had been counting all deaths of anyone who tested
positive at any point as Covid-19 deaths, officially adapted a more stringent protocol in
mid-June, only listing a death as Covid-related if it was a specific factor mentioned in the
death certificate [49]. Case and death reductions may also occur for other reasons. In Belgium a downward revision, ostensibly to correct for double-counting in nursing homes,
made news because it seemed to be timed to avoid the milestone of 10,000 Covid-19
deaths [50].
Downward revisions of past death statistics, if integrated properly into time-series
data, should not have an adverse affect on any attempt to determine changes in casemortality over time, whether by our model or other techniques. Our primary data source,
13

the JHU CSSE Covid team [16], seems to have made every effort to revise past data
to reflect current knowledge and practice. To begin with, they cross-reference many
sources of their own, including the World Health Organization, the European Centre for
Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the US Center for Disease Control, many other
national health organizations (such as the National Health Commission of the People’s
Republic of China, Australia Government Department of Health, Italian Ministry of
Health, etc.), practically all US state Departments of Health, many municipalities and
US counties, news organizations such as the Los Angeles Times and BNO News, and
even a few other Covid-19 tracking projects (presumably for confirmation) such as “the
COVID Tracking Project” maintained by The Atlantic (https://covidtracking.com/data)
and WorldoMeters Covid page (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/).
Importantly, when possible the JHU CSSE Covid team back-distribute revisions of
past data (i.e. incorporate them on appropriate days in their currently available time
series). According to their records, there have been 22 data modifications for European
nations and 19 for US jurisdictions (which are tallied by county). As well, several largescale back distributions have been done (twice for both New York City and Massachusetts;
and once for the United Kingdom, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, and Harris
County, Texas). In general, such back distribution (whether an up or down revision)
should make death data before mid-May more trustworthy rather than less.
An issue arises if jurisdictions adopt new protocols without revising past statistics,
or do the revisions without back-distributing into the past data sets. In the JHU CSSE
time series we used 36 US states and 21 European countries had decreases in cumulative
deaths on 121 separate occasions, mostly by 1 or 2 cases. Since any decrease in cumulative
deaths is a physical impossibility, the ones we see here presumably indicate data revisions
which could not be back-distributed. For example, the time-series for Washington State
has occasional negative day-to-day changes in death counts starting from mid June (when
they changed their protocol) and lasting through July (when they seem to have finished
whatever revisions they needed to make). The total number of deaths involved in these
post hoc revisions is 2,463 for the European nations and 666 for the US states; while
not trivial, these values could hardly account for the drops we have seen in the death
rates detailed above. To determine how many downward non-back-distributed revisions
occurred which did not result in negative day-to-day changes in cumulative deaths, or
which countries, states, or counties quietly adopted different protocols or definitions without attempting to revise past totals, would require greater access to jurisdictional health
agency revision and policy data than we have.
In conclusion, we have found that the case mortality rate of Covid-19 has dramatically
decreased between mid-April and mid-June 2020 in many European countries and US
states. While there are many plausible factors, such as improved medical technique,
mask wearing, increased testing, viral mutation, demographics, or changes in recording
of cases, that may have caused this, at this point we cannot conclusively say which, if any,
are the cause, or if it is a combination of these or other subtle factors. This surprising
finding warrants further attention.
