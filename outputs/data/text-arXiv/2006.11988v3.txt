Abstract
Across the world’s coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) hot spots, the need to streamline
patient diagnosis and management has become more pressing than ever. As one of the main
imaging tools, chest X-rays (CXRs) are common, fast, non-invasive, relatively cheap, and
potentially bedside to monitor the progression of the disease. This paper describes the first
public COVID-19 image data collection as well as a preliminary exploration of possible use
cases for the data. This dataset currently contains hundreds of frontal view X-rays and is
the largest public resource for COVID-19 image and prognostic data, making it a necessary
resource to develop and evaluate tools to aid in the treatment of COVID-19. It was manually
aggregated from publication figures as well as various web based repositories into a machine
learning (ML) friendly format with accompanying dataloader code. We collected frontal
and lateral view imagery and metadata such as the time since first symptoms, intensive
care unit (ICU) status, survival status, intubation status, or hospital location. We present
multiple possible use cases for the data such as predicting the need for the ICU, predicting
patient survival, and understanding a patient’s trajectory during treatment. Data can be
accessed here: https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset

1. Introduction
In the times of the rapidly emerging coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), hot spots and
growing concerns about a second wave are making it crucial to streamline patient diagnosis
and management. Many experts in the medical community believe that artificial intelligence
(AI) systems could lessen the burden on hospitals dealing with outbreaks by processing
imaging data [Kim, 2020; Rubin et al., 2020]. Hospitals have deployed AI-driven computed
tomography (CT) scan interpreters in China [Simonite, 2020] and Italy [Lyman, 2020], as well
as AI initiatives to improve triaging of COVID-19 patients (i.e., discharge, general admission,
or ICU care) and allocation of hospital resources [Strickland, 2020; Hao, 2020].

Cohen, Morrison, Dao, Roth, Duong, Ghassemi

Carefully curated and annotated data is the first step to developing any diagnostic or
management tool. While there exist large public datasets of more typical chest X-rays
(CXR) [Wang et al., 2017; Bustos et al., 2019; Irvin et al., 2019; Johnson et al., 2019;
Demner-Fushman et al., 2016], there was no public collection of COVID-19 CXR or CT
scans designed to be used for computational analysis. We first made data public in mid
February 2020 and the dataset has rapidly grown [Cohen et al., 2020c]. More recently, in
June, the BIMCV COVID-19+ dataset [De La Iglesia Vayá et al., 2020] was released. While
it has more samples than the dataset we present, we complement their work with a focus on
prospective metadata from multiple medical centers and countries.
Many physicians remain reluctant to share their patients’ anonymized imaging data
in open datasets, even after obtaining consent, due to ethical concerns over privacy and
confidentiality and a hospital culture that, in our experience, does not reward sharing [Keen
et al., 2013; Lee and Yoon, 2017; Kostkova et al., 2016; Floca, 2014]. In order to access data in
one hospital, researchers must submit a protocol to the hospital’s institutional review board
(IRB) for approval and build their own data management system. While this is important
for patient safety, such routines must be repeated for every hospital, resulting in a lengthy
bureaucratic process that hurts reproducibility and external validation.
The ultimate goal of this project is to aggregate all publicly available radiographs,
including papers and other datasets that can be combined. For research articles, images are
extracted by hand, while for websites, such as Radiopaedia and Eurorad, data collection is
partially automated using scrapers that extract a subset of the metadata while we hand review
case notes to determine clinical events. This work provides three primary contributions:
• We create the first public COVID-19 CXR image data collection, currently totalling 679
frontal chest X-ray images from 412 people from 26 countries and growing. The dataset
contains clinical attributes about survival, ICU stay, intubation events, blood tests,
location, and freeform clinical notes for each image/case. In contrast to other works,
we focus on prospective metadata for the development of prognostic and management
tools from CXR. Images collected have already been made public and are presented in
an ML-ready dataset with toolchains that are easily used in many testable settings.
• We also present and discuss clinical use-cases and propose ML tasks that may address
these clinical use cases such as predicting pneumonia severity, survival outcome, and
need for the intensive care unit (ICU). Benchmark results using transfer learning with
neural networks are included.
• We also discuss how to use the location information in this dataset for a Leave-OneCountry/Continent-Out (LOCO) evaluation to simulate domain shift and provide a
more robust evaluation.
Currently, all images and data are released under the following GitHub URL1 . We hope
that this dataset and tasks will allow for quick uptake of COVID-related prediction problems
in the machine learning community.

2. Background and Related Work
2.1 Learning in Medical Imaging
In recent years, ML applications on CXR data have seen rising interest, such as lung
segmentation [Gordienko et al., 2018; Islam and Zhang, 2018], tuberculosis and cancer analysis
[Gordienko et al., 2018; Stirenko et al., 2018; Lakhani and Sundaram, 2017], abnormality
detection [Islam et al., 2017], explanation [Singla et al., 2020], and multi-modality predictions
Rubin et al. [2018]; Hashir et al. [2020]. With the availability of large-scale public CXR
datasets created with ML in mind (e.g. CheXpert [Irvin et al., 2019], Chest-xray8 [Wang et al.,
2017], PadChest [Bustos et al., 2019] or MIMIC-CXR [Johnson et al., 2019]), neural networks
have even reported being able to achieve performance near radiologist levels [Rajpurkar
et al., 2018, 2017; Irvin et al., 2019; Putha et al., 2018a; Majkowska et al., 2019; Putha et al.,
2018b]. However, the adoption has its own challenges [Couzin-Frankel, 2019].
2.2 Use of Imaging for COVID-19
In this section we will give a high level overview of the recommendations for the clinical use
of imaging in COVID-19 patient management. It should be noted that this list is only meant
to help guide algorithm development and is not medically comprehensive.
Ever since the dawn of the outbreak, imaging has stood out as a promising avenue of
research and care [Zu et al., 2020; Poggiali et al., 2020]. Particularly in the beginning of the
outbreak, computed tomography (CT) scans captured the attention of both the medical [Ng
et al., 2020; Kanne et al., 2020] and the ML [McCall, 2020] communities.
From March to May 2020, the Fleischner Society [Rubin et al., 2020], American College
of Radiology (ACR) [ACR, 2020], Canadian Association of Radiologists (CAR) [Dennie et al.,
2020a], Canadian Society of Thoracic Radiology (CSTR) Dennie et al. [2020b], and British
Society of Thoracic Imaging (BSTI) [Nair et al., 2020] released the following recommendations:
1. Imaging tests (CXR and chest CT scans) should not be used alone to diagnose COVID19 nor used systematically on all patients with suspected COVID-19;
2. Findings on CT scans and CXR are non-specific and these imaging techniques should
not be used to inform decisions on whether to test a patient for COVID-19 (in other
words, normal chest imaging results do not exclude the possibility of COVID-19 infection
and abnormal chest imaging findings are not specific for diagnosis);
3. CXR and chest CT scans can be used for patients at risk of disease progression and
with worsening respiratory status as well as in resource-constrained environments for
triage of patients with suspected COVID-19.
However, CXRs remain the first choice in terms of the initial imaging test when caring
for patients with suspected COVID-19. CXRs are the preferred initial imaging modality
when pneumonia is suspected [ACR, 2018] and the radiation dose of CXR (0.02 mSv for a
PA film) is lower than the radiation dose of chest CT scans (7 mSv), putting the patients
less at risk of radiation-related diseases such as cancer [FDA, 2017].
In addition, CXR are cheaper than CT scans, making them more viable financially for
healthcare systems and patients. [Beek, 2015; Ball et al., 2017]. Finally, portable CXR units
3

can be wheeled into ICU as well as emergency rooms (ER) and are easily cleaned afterwards,
reducing impact on patient flow and risks of infection [Dennie et al., 2020a; ACR, 2020].
A recent hypothesis that is increasingly confirmed by research suggesting that COVID-19
is not a pulmonary but rather a vascular disease [Varga et al., 2020] [Ackermann et al., 2020].
This could explain the variety of symptoms which do not necessarily include pneumonia but
can still lead to ICU hospitalization [Wadman et al., 2020].
2.3 COVID-19 Prediction from CXR
While many works have attempted to predict COVID-19 through medical imaging, the results
have been on small or private data. Many of these methods use the dataset presented here.
For example, while promising results were achieved by Raj [2020] (90% AUC), these were
reported over a large private dataset and are not reproducible. Additionally, much research is
presented without appropriate evaluations, potentially leading to overfitting and performance
overestimation [Maguolo and Nanni, 2020; Tartaglione et al., 2020; DeGrave et al., 2020].
Many prediction models are not viable for use in clinical practice, as they are inadequately
reported, particularly with regard to their performance, and at strong risk of bias Wynants
et al. [2020]. A study by Murphy et al. [2020] found that an AI system achieved an AUC of
0.81 and was comparable with that of six independent readers.
Most ML work using this dataset has focused on COVID-19 Prediction similar to our
task definition in §5.1. Many have used a transfer learning approach, similar to what we use
for baselines in this work, where a model that is pretrained on existing CXR datasets is used
to construct features from the images in this dataset which are lower dimensional and are
less prone to overfitting [Apostolopoulos and Mpesiana, 2020] [Minaee et al., 2020]. Another
similar approach taken is utilizing a multi-task network which predicts both standard CXR
tasks as well as a COVID-19 task to assign a likelihood to samples and perform anomaly
detection [Zhang et al., 2020]. Another work has utilized the pathology hierarchy we provide
to improve predictions by using the Clus-HMC method [Pereira et al., 2020].
Many groups have also used this dataset to make severity and survival outcome predictions
similar to our task definition in §5.2 and 5.3. Such work like Signoroni et al. [2020] focused
on predicting a Brixia Score which has been clinically studied against severity and outcomes
[Borghesi and Maroldi, 2020b]. It is laborious to create these annotations so an approach by
Amer et al. [2020] predicts a lung segmentation, generates a prediction saliency, and then
calculates the ratio of coverage which acts as a proxy for the Brixia and geographic extent
scores we discuss later.

3. Cohort Details
The current statistics as of September 18th 2020 are shown in Table 1, which presents the
distribution of frontal CXR by diagnosis, types of pneumonia and responsible microorganisms
when applicable. For each image, attributes shown in Table 2 are collected. Statistics are
presented by sub-region in Table 3 and by projection/view in Table 4. Figures 1 and 2 present
demographics for patients and frontal CXR images. In terms of unique patients the M/F ratio
is 230/139. In total, 761 images were collected, of which 679 are frontal and 82 are lateral
view. Of the frontal views 518 are standard frontal PA/AP (Posteroanterior/Anteroposterior)
views and 161 are AP Supine (Anteroposterior laying down). The images originate from
various hospitals across 26 different countries.

3.1 Data Collection
As mentioned earlier, data was largely compiled from public databases on websites such as
Radiopaedia.org, the Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology2 , Figure1.com3 ,
and the Hannover Medical School [Winther et al., 2020b], both manually and using scrapers.
A full list of publications is included in Appendix §C.1.

COVID-19 Image Data Collection: Prospective Predictions are the Future

Images were extracted from online publications, websites, or directly from the PDF using
the tool pdfimages4 . Throughout data collection, we aimed to maintain the quality of the
images. Many articles were found using the list of literature provided by Peng et al. [2020].
A limitation of this approach is that we have no control over the processing between the PAC
system and the PDF or website. However, we believe that information about the radiological
finding was maintained otherwise the image in publication would not be useful. We also
believe the images from PDFs and other image sources provide useful information when
compared to raw data and expect studies to show this.
A challenge in extracting metadata is the alignment with images. To belong in the same
row as an image, a clinical measurement must have been taken on the same day. It can
be difficult to automatically determine when the measurement was taken if the metadata
appears outside of image captions. For details on scraper design, see §Appendix C. All scripts
are made publicly available.

4. Experimental Setup
Using this dataset as a benchmark is very challenging because, by the nature of its construction,
it is very biased and unbalanced (recall geographically unbalanced labels in Table 3). This
can lead to many negative outcomes if treated as a typical benchmark dataset [Maguolo and
Nanni, 2020; Cohen et al., 2020b; Seyyed-Kalantari et al., 2020; Kelly et al., 2019]. Unless
otherwise specified only AP and PA views are used to avoid confounding image artifacts of
the AP Supine view.
4.1 Leave-One-Country/Continent-Out (LOCO) Evaluation:
In order to deal with issues of bias, we perform a “leave one country/continent out” (LOCO)
evaluation. This approach is motivated from training bias common in small, unbalanced
datasets. For our evaluation the test set will be composed of data from a single continent.
Ideally, we would separate by countries, but this is not possible given the current distribution
of data. We also note that not every sample is labelled, so models may be trained and
evaluated on data from the same continent, but we ensured that samples in training and
evaluation did not originate from the same research group/image source.
This approach should give us a distributional shift that will allow us to correctly evaluate
the model. For each task, a subset of the samples will have enough representation to be
included. Continents which do not have at least one representative for each class are filtered
out and not used.
4.2 Models and Features
In place of images, features are extracted using a pre-trained DenseNet model [Huang et al.,
2017] from the TorchXRayVison library [Cohen et al., 2020d] which is trained on 7 large
CXR datasets as described in Cohen et al. [2020b]. These datasets were manually aligned
with each other on 18 common radiological finding tasks in order to train a model using all
datasets at once (atelectasis, consolidation, infiltration, pneumothorax, edema, emphysema,
fibrosis, fibrosis, effusion, pneumonia, pleural thickening, cardiomegaly, nodule, mass, hernia,
4. https://poppler.freedesktop.org/

Cohen, Morrison, Dao, Roth, Duong, Ghassemi

lung lesion, fracture, lung opacity, and enlarged cardiomediastinum). For example “pleural
effusion" from one dataset is considered the same as “effusion" from another dataset in order
to consider these labels equal. In total, 88,079 non-COVID-19 images were used to train the
model on these tasks. We will use the term pre-sigmoid which refers to the output of the last
layer of the network multiplied by a weight vector corresponding to each task which would
normally then be passed through a sigmoid function. Features will be used in the following
constructions (as in Cohen et al. [2020a]):
• Intermediate features - the result of the convolutional layers and global averaging
(1024 dim vector);
• 18 outputs - each image was represented by the 18 outputs (pre-sigmoid) here:
Atelectasis, Consolidation, Infiltration, Pneumothorax, Edema, Emphysema, Fibrosis,
Effusion, Pneumonia, Pleural Thickening, Cardiomegaly, Nodule, Mass, Hernia, Lung
Lesion, Fracture, Lung Opacity, Enlarged Cardiomediastinum;
• 4 outputs - a hand picked subset of the above mentioned outputs (pre-sigmoid)
were used containing radiological findings more frequent in pneumonia: Lung Opacity,
Pneumonia, Infiltration, and Consolidation;
• Lung Opacity output - the single output (pre-sigmoid) for lung opacity was used
because it was very related to this task. This feature was different from the opacity
score that we would like to predict;
• Image pixels - the image itself as a vector of pixels (224×224=50176).
• Baseline prevalence - to compare against a model which predicted based on the
prevalence of the labels only.
Model training is done using linear or logistic regression with default parameters from
Sci-kit learn [Pedregosa et al., 2011]. An L2 penalty was used with an LBFGS solver. In the
case of “image pixels” an MLP is used with 100 hidden units and ReLU activations Glorot
et al. [2011]. It is trained with full batch gradient descent using an Adam optimizer Kingma
and Ba [2014] (with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.999,  = 1e−8 , a learning rate of 0.001, and 10% of the
data used for early stopping.

5. Task Ideas with Baseline Evaluations
We present multiple clinical use cases and potential tools which could be built using this
dataset and present a baseline task which is evaluated. We describe the scenarios in detail to
both convey what our group has learned while interacting with clinicians as well as solidify
what the value is of such a model to avoid misguided efforts solving a problem that doesn’t
exist. For the results presented in Tables 6 and 5 a full listing over all data splits is presented
in Appendix §C.2.

5.1 Complement to COVID-19 Pneumonia Diagnosis and Management
Motivation: While reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) assay remains the gold standard for diagnosis, CXR plays a major role as the top initial imaging
test for patients with suspected COVID-19 pneumonia [Dennie et al., 2020b]. Because of
their relative lack of sensitivity (69%, although this was computed with a small sample size)
[Wong et al., 2019] and the fact that they are often normal early in the disease [Dennie
et al., 2020b; Wong et al., 2019], a negative CXR should not be used to rule out COVID-19
infection [Dennie et al., 2020b]. Instead, features of COVID-19 pneumonia in CXR, although
nonspecific, raise the pretest probability of infection. For example, distinguishing between
9

Cohen, Morrison, Dao, Roth, Duong, Ghassemi

viral and bacterial pneumonia could influence management in addition to other clinical clues
[Heneghan et al., 2020]. According to the CSTR and CAR, a CXR is “most useful when an
alternative diagnosis is found that completely explains the patient’s presenting symptoms
such as, but not limited, to pneumothorax, pulmonary edema, large pleural effusions, lung
mass or lung collapse [Dennie et al., 2020b].”
Task Specification: The hierarchy of labels (Table 1) allows us to perform multiple
different classification tasks. A first task is to classify COVID-19 from other causal agents
of pneumonia such as bacteria or other viruses. A second task is to distinguish viral from
bacterial pneumonia.
Results: When classifying between COVID/non-COVID most recent works using this
dataset have taken other datasets and treated them as non-COVID-19 [Wang and Wong, 2020;
Apostolopoulos and Mpesiana, 2020] while results with balanced datasets from Tartaglione
et al. [2020] report much lower performance. Our LOCO evaluation aims to avoid these
issues and in Table 5 we find that the best performance is only slightly higher than random
guessing which would yield a 0.5 AUROC. We specifically note that the “4 outputs” which
are commonly associated with Pneumonia are not predictive, possibly implying something
about the disease that should be explored more. We find that predicting between bacterial
and viral yields reasonably good performance using intermediate features or the 18 specific
outputs. This is not surprising as previous work has reported high accuracy when predicting
bacterial and viral from pediatric CXR [Kermany et al., 2018].
5.2 Severity Prediction, Including Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Stay
Motivation: The ICU is reserved for patients who require life support such as mechanical
ventilation. In this invasive intervention reserved for patients unable to breathe on their
own, an endotracheal tube is inserted into the windpipe (intubation) and the lungs are
mechanically inflated and deflated [Tobin and Manthous, 2017]. Predicting the need for
mechanical ventilation in advance could help plan management or prepare the patient.
Another challenge is knowing when to remove mechanical ventilation (extubation), which
falls in a specific window of time [Thille et al., 2013].
Assessing the severity of a patient’s condition using a well adopted scoring system is a
key aspect of patient management [Wong et al., 2019; Cohen et al., 2020a; Borghesi and
Maroldi, 2020b; Signoroni et al., 2020]. A model which predicts the severity of COVID-19
pneumonia, and pneumonia in general, based on CXR could be used as an assistive tool
when managing patient care for escalation or de-escalation of care, especially in the ICU.
Non-ML work by Allenbach et al. [2020] combines information from CT scans and CXR
with other clinical information to create a score-based predictive model for transfer to the
ICU.
This task is further motivated by papers published after a preprint of this work which employed siamese networks to represent severity [Li et al., 2020] as well as predicted deterioration
risk scores and time estimates [Shamout et al., 2020].
It is important to note with this task that predicting these events could be confounded
by the presence of an endotracheal tube in the CXR of a mechanically ventilated patient;
when available, this is annotated in our dataset.

Due to the reduced mobility of ICU patients, CXR are often obtained with the patient
lying down in a view referred to as “AP supine” [Khan et al., 2009], which includes but is
not limited to patients who are intubated or soon to be. Because this position drastically
modifies the appearance of the CXR, a naive approach could confound such changes with
the need to be intubated.
Task Specification: The first thing that is required for this task is a well defined scoring
system that defines patient severity. The mRALE (modified Radiographic Assessment of
Lung Edema) score [Wong et al., 2019; Cohen et al., 2020a] was developed specifically with
in context of assessing COVID-19 severity from CXR and was used to score 94 images in this
dataset in Cohen et al. [2020a] by two chest radiologists and a radiology resident. Also, the
Brixia score [Borghesi and Maroldi, 2020b; Signoroni et al., 2020] was used by another group
to score 192 of these images by "two expert radiologists, a board-certified staff member and
a trainee with 22 and 2 years of experience respectively" [Signoroni et al., 2020].
Our task and evaluation will use the severity scores created by Cohen et al. [2020a]. This
work provides two scores: Geographic Extent (0-8), how much opacity covers the lungs, and
Opacity (0-6), how opaque the lungs are.
Also, an ICU stay and the patient being intubated are both predicted given patients
between 0 and 8 days from symptoms/presentation. Images marked as intubation present
are excluded from the evaluation as this would be a visible confounder in the image. For
ICU stay prediction images marked as already in the ICU are excluded.
Results: Table 6 shows performance similar to that reported by Cohen et al. [2020a]. The
evaluation used in that work is not LOCO.
Table 5 shows ICU stay is predicted reasonably well at 0.81 AUROC using all 18 outputs.
The improvement over the “4 outputs” which are associated with Pneumonia may imply that
ICU stay is predictive by features not related to pneumonia. Intubation is predicted poorly.

5.3 Survival outcome
Motivation: Not too dissimilar to severity prediction, determining at what point survival
can be predicted could be useful for patient management. Given a series of patient chest
X-rays over time, it could be possible to determine the probability of survival.
Non-ML models are able to predict in-hospital mortality for patients with COVID-19
using an original severity score for CXR (Brixia score) combined with two predictive factors,
which are patient age and immunosuppressive conditions [Borghesi et al., 2020a]. ML models
are able to predict survival based on clinical features (lactate dehydrogenase, lymphocyte
count, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein) with high accuracy [Yan et al., 2020].
Task Specification: In order to make predictions which are relevant to the clinical context,
it is important to control for the time period when the patient is observed. Our evaluation is
on data between 0 and 8 days since symptoms or admission in order to simulate predicting
at the beginning of management. Predictions will be made on non-intubated patients to
avoid this confounder of severity.
Results: In Table 5, almost random performance of 0.55 AUROC is obtained using lung
opacity and the 4 hand picked features of Pneumonia. In general, no method works well.
5.4 Trajectory Prediction
Motivation: The ability to gauge severity of COVID-19 lung infections could be used
to complement other severity tools for escalation or de-escalation of care, especially in the
ICU. Following diagnosis, patients’ CXR could be scored periodically to objectively and
quantitatively track pulmonary disease progression and treatment response. Eventually,
physicians could track patients’ response to various drugs and treatments using CXR and
uploading the images to the dataset, allowing researchers to create predictive tools to measure
recuperation. Such a model could also be used as an objective tool to compare response to
different management algorithms and inspire better management strategies.
If the representation is expressive enough, patients can be plotted as shown in Figure 3a.
A conceptual figure and our current realization are shown using a pre-trained CXR model
showing the available trajectories and patient outcomes. This approach could serve as a way
to iterate quickly with a medical team (to simply explore the learned representation instead
of building complete tools) to make sense of the complexities of these models and patients.
Task Specification: Using this dataset, we could visualize a model’s representation of
CXRs and plot the trajectory of patients according to a color scheme representing their
state/image (good or bad). The representation is based off of the 18 pre-sigmoid outputs of
the DenseNet discussed. A good state is defined as non-intubated, not in the ICU, or the
last state before discharge. A bad state is defined as intubated, in the ICU, or any state
which is the last in the series and the patient is determined to have died. A kernel density
estimation is taken of the 2d embeddings of all bad states to illustrate severity. Here PA,
AP, and AP Supine images are used to maximize the data visualized as we did not observe
any shift in the representation.
Results: Figure 3b shows proximity of image embeddings which represent patients in a
good or bad state, demonstrating the potential insight already contained in these pre-trained

models. The three patients display trajectories as we would imagine. Patient 1785 spirals
in an area which appears bad. Patient 2056 progresses into bad states but manages to pull
themselves out. Patient 332 [Sivakorn et al., 2020] seems to recover quickly to a region which
is only populated by good states.

6. Future Task Ideas
There are many potential tasks that we were not able to explore in this work, primarily the
use of saliency maps and the utility of out-of-distribution models.
Evaluating saliency maps can be challenging, but it is a useful evaluation for methods
which aim to explain model predictions [Taghanaki et al., 2019; Singla et al., 2020]. Our
dataset contains lung bounding boxes, which were contributed by Andrew Gough at General
Blockchain Inc. for 167 images annotated for the left and right lung. Also, 209 generated
lung segmentations were added to the dataset by Selvan et al. [2020]; the team trained a
model on an external dataset and applied it to our dataset. As there are no “ground truth”
segmentations, these can be used to examine if saliency maps are located reasonably within
lung regions to detect overfitting. This can be seen by checking if the predictive regions
of the image lie outside of the region of interest [Ross et al., 2017; Badgeley et al., 2019;
Viviano et al., 2019].
General anomaly detection could be a useful model when trying to identify what is
new about an illness such as COVID-19. Out-of-distribution (OoD) tools [Shafaei et al.,
2018] or unpaired distribution matching models [Zhu et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2017] could
capture the shift in distributions and present them as changes to images Cohen et al. [2018].
Identifying what about the COVID-19 distribution is different from other viral or bacterial
pneumonias could aid in studying both the disease as well as the models representations for

overfitting [Singla et al., 2020]. Transfer learning methods actively under development in
the ML community such as few/zero-shot [Wang et al., 2019; Tian et al., 2020b; Larochelle
et al., 2008; Ren et al., 2019], meta-learning [Andrychowicz et al., 2016; Snell et al., 2017],
deep metric learning [Roth et al., 2020], and domain adaptation [Motiian et al., 2017] will
likely be useful in this setting.

7. Conclusion
This paper presents a dataset of COVID-19 images together with clinical metadata which
can be used for a variety of tasks. This dataset puts existing ML algorithms to the test.
Given the number of existing large CXR datasets, novel tasks related to COVID-19 present
a relevant challenge to overcome. We note that a major limitation of this work is the
selection bias when gathering publicly available images which are likely made public for
educational reasons because they are clear examples or interesting cases. Therefore, they
do not represent the real world distribution of cases. Furthermore, another selection bias
is that the information given on public platforms such as Figure 1 or Radiopaedia might
not be complete for all patients and/or omit normal values (e.g., presence or absence of
transfer to the ICU, lymphocyte count). Lastly, we do not yet have variables such as ethnic
background, pre-existing conditions, and immunosuppression status. Any clinical claims
made from models must therefore be backed by rigorous evaluation and take into account
these limitations. Nevertheless, we believe that this dataset and the discussion of clinical
context will contribute towards the machine learning community developing solutions with
potential use in healthcare.

Broader Impact
This project aims to make a dataset of patients with a novel life-threatening disease accessible
to researchers so that tools can be created to aid in the care of future patients. The manner
in which we collect existing public data ensures that patients are not put at risk.
Data impact: Image data linked with clinically relevant attributes in a public dataset
that is designed for ML will enable parallel development of diagnosis and management tools
and rapid local validation of models. Furthermore, this data can be used for a variety of
different tasks.
Tool impact: Tools developed using this data and with the ideas presented can give
physicians an edge and allow them to act with more confidence while they wait for the
analysis of a radiologist by having a digital second opinion confirm their assessment of a
patient’s condition. In addition, these tools can provide quantitative scores which can enable
large scale analysis of CXR without the need for costly/time consuming manual annotations.

Appendix C. Scraper details
Each scraper identifies relevant radiographs using the “search" feature of the site being scraped, and
saves the images together with a csv file of the corresponding metadata. Internally, the scraper uses
Selenium to visit each page of the search results, saving metadata and images from any new cases.
Images are downloaded at the highest resolution available. Data from each case is converted to a
single, interoperable JSON format. Finally, the needed metadata is exported as a csv file.
Currently, the scrapers only retrieve metadata from structured fields that can be easily detected
on webpages, such as “Age", “Sex", “Imaging Notes", and “Clinical Notes." Other clinically important
information (such as whether the patient went to the ICU or was intubated) is extracted by human
annotators.
Care has been taken to use these websites’ resources conservatively and avoid creating a burden
on their servers. Crawling is done in a lazy manner, so that no pages are requested until they can
be used. Also, within each scraping session, each web page is kept open in an individual browser
instance as long as it is needed to reduce re-requested resources .
