Abstract
For decades mathematical models have been used to predict the behavior of physical and biological systems, as
well as to define strategies aiming at the minimization of the effects regarding different types of diseases. In the
present days, the development of mathematical models to simulate the dynamic behavior of the novel coronavirus
disease (COVID-19) is considered an important theme due to the quantity of infected people worldwide. In this work,
the aim is to determine an optimal control strategy for vaccine administration in COVID-19 pandemic treatment
considering real data from China. For this purpose, an inverse problem is formulated and solved in order to determine
the parameters of the compartmental SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Removed) model. To solve such inverse problem,
the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm is employed. After this step, two optimal control problems (mono- and
multi-objective) to determine the optimal strategy for vaccine administration in COVID-19 pandemic treatment are
proposed. The first consists of minimizing the quantity of infected individuals during the treatment. The second
considers minimizing together the quantity of infected individuals and the prescribed vaccine concentration during the
treatment, i.e., a multi-objective optimal control problem. The solution for both optimal control problems is obtained
using DE and Multi-Objective Differential Evolution (MODE) algorithms, respectively. The results regarding the
proposed multi-objective optimal control problem provides a set of evidences from which an optimal strategy for
vaccine administration can be chosen, according to a given criterion.

1. Introduction
In the last decades, countless mathematical models used to evaluate the spread and control of infectious diseases
have been proposed. These models are very important in different fields, such as policy making, emergency planning
and risk assessment, definition of control-programs, and promotion of the improvement of various health-economic
aspects (Al-Sheikh, 2013). In general, such models aim to describe a state of infection (susceptible and infected) and
a process of infection (the transition between these states) by using compartmental relations, i.e., the population is
divided into compartments by taking assumptions about the nature and time rate of transfer from one compartment
to another (Trawicki, 2017; Blackwood and Childs, 2018). One can cite several studies using models for measles
vaccination (Bauch et al., 2009; Widyaningsih et al., 2018), HIV/AIDS (Mukandavire et al., 2009), tuberculosis
(Bowong and Kurths, 2010), dengue (Weiss, 2013), pertussis epidemiology (Pesco et al., 2014), among others.
Recently, for the past five to six months, the world has been experiencing the dissemination of a new virus,
referred to as COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019). COVID-19 is an infectious disease emerged from China in
November 2019, that has rapidly spread around in many other countries worldwide (Gorbalenya et al., 2020; World

Health Organization, 2020 (accessed April 8, 2020). The common symptoms are severe respiratory illness, fever,
cough, and myalgia or fatigue, especially at the onset of illness (Huang et al., 2020). The transmission may happen
person-to-person, through direct contact or droplets (Chan et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Riou and Althaus, 2020).
Since the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan City in November of 2019, various computational model-based predictions have been proposed and studied. Lin et al. (2020) proposed a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR)
model for the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan. These authors considered some essential elements including individual behavioral response, governmental actions, zoonotic transmission and emigration of a large proportion of the
population in a short time period. Benvenuto et al. (2020) proposed the Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model to predict the spread, prevalence and incidence of COVID-2019. Roda et al. (2020) used a
Susceptible-Infectious-Removed (SIR) model to predict the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan after the lockdown and
quarantine. In such study, the authors demonstrate that non-identifiability in model calibrations using the confirmedcase data is the main reason for wide variations in the results. Prem et al. (2020) proposed a SEIR model to simulate
the spread of COVID-19 in Wuhan city. In this model, all demographic changes in the population (births, deaths
and ageing) were ignored. The simulations showed that control measures aimed at reducing social mixing in the
population can be effective in reducing the magnitude and delaying the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak.
In order to evaluate the global stability and equilibrium point of these models, Li and Muldowney (1995) studied
a SEIR model with nonlinear incidence rates in epidemiology, in terms of global stability of endemic equilibrium. AlSheikh (2013) evaluated a SEIR epidemic model with limited resources for treating infected people. For this purpose,
the existence and stability of disease-free and endemic equilibrium were investigated. Li and Cui (2013) studied a
SEIR model with vaccination strategy that incorporates distinct incidence rates for exposed and infected populations.
These authors proved the global asymptotical stable results of the disease-free equilibrium. Singh et al. (2017) developed a simple and effective mathematical model for transmission of infectious diseases by taking into consideration
the human immunity. This model was evaluated in terms of local stability of both disease free equilibrium and disease
endemic equilibrium. Widyaningsih et al. (2018) proposed a SEIR model with immigration and determined the system equilibrium conditions. Kim et al. (2019) developed a Coxian-distributed SEIR model considering an empirical
incubation period, and a stability analysis was also performed.
In order to reduce the dissemination of COVID-19 worldwide, various procedures have been adopted. As mentioned by Zhai et al. (2020) and Wei et al. (2020), quarantine and isolation (social-distancing) can effectively reduce
the spread of COVID-19. In addition, wearing masks, washing hands and disinfecting surfaces contribute to reducing
the risk of infection. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, there are no specific therapies to COVID19 treatment. However, treatments including antiviral agents, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, corticosteroids,
antibodies, convalescent plasma transfusion and radiotherapy are being studied (Wang et al., 2020).
As alternative to these treatments, the use of drug administration (vaccine) arises as an interesting alternative to
face this pandemic. It must be emphasized that there is currently no vaccine to COVID-19, but there is a huge effort
to develop a vaccine in a record time, which justifies the present study (Lurie et al., 2020). Mathematically, the
determination of optimal protocol for vaccine administration characterizes an Optimal Control Problem (OCP). This
particular optimization problem consists in the determination of control variable profiles that minimize (or maximize)
a given performance index (Bryson and Ho, 1975; Biegler et al., 2002). In order to solve this problem, several
numerical methods have been proposed (Bryson and Ho, 1975; Feehery and Barton, 1996; Lobato, 2004; Lobato et al.,
2016). These methods are classified according to three broad categories: direct optimization methods, Pontryagin’s
Maximum Principle (PMP) based methods and HJB-based (Hamilton-Jacob-Bellman) methods. The direct approach
is the most traditional strategy considered to solve an OCP, due to its simplicity. In this approach, the original
problem is transformed into a finite dimensional optimization problem through the parametrization of control or
parametrization of control and state variables (Feehery and Barton, 1996).
From an epidemiological point of view, Neilan and Lenhart (2010) proposed an optimal control problem to determine a vaccination strategy over a specific period of time so as to minimize a cost function. In this work, the
propagation of a disease is controlled by a limited number of vaccines, while minimizing a percentage of the overall
number of dead people by infection, and a cost associated with vaccination. Biswas et al. (2014) studied different
mathematical formulations for an optimal control problem considering a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed
model. For this purpose, these authors evaluated the solution of such problems when mixed state control constraints
are used to impose upper bounds on the available vaccines at each instant of time. In addition, the possibility of imposing upper bounds on the number of susceptible individuals with and without limitations on the number of vaccines
2

available were analyzed. The optimal control theory was applied to obtain optimal vaccination schedules and control
strategies for the epidemic model of human infectious diseases.
In this work, the objective is to determine an optimal control strategy for vaccine administration in COVID-19 pandemic treatment considering real data from China. In order to determine the parameters that characterize the proposed
mathematical model (based on the compartmental SIR model), an inverse problem is formulated and solved considering the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm (Storn and Price, 1997; Price et al., 2005). After this step, two optimal
control problems (mono- and multi-objective) used to determine the optimal strategy for vaccine administration in
COVID-19 pandemic treatment are proposed. The mono-objective optimal control problem considers minimizing the
quantity of infected individuals during the treatment. On the other hand, the multi-objective optimal control problem
considers minimizing together the quantity of infected individuals and the prescribed vaccine concentration during
the treatment. To solve each problem, DE and Multi-Objective Differential Evolution (MODE) algorithms (Lobato
and Steffen, 2011) are employed, respectively.
This work is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the description of the mathematical model considered to
represent the evolution of COVID-19 pandemic. In Section 3, the general aspects regarding the formulation and
solution of an OCP is presented. A brief review on DE and its extension to deal with multi-criteria optimization is
presented in Section 4. In Section 5, the proposed methodology is presented and discussed. The results obtained using
such methodology are presented in Section 6. Finally, the conclusions are outlined in Section 7.
2. Mathematical Modeling in Epidemiology
In the specialized literature, various compartmental models used to represent the evolution of an epidemic can be
found (Forgoston and Schwartz, 2013; Pesco et al., 2014; Shaman et al., 2014; Cooper et al., 2016; Azam et al., 2020).
The study of these models is very important to understand the epidemic spreading mechanisms and, consequently, to
investigate the transmission dynamics in population (Forgoston and Schwartz, 2013). As mentioned by Keeling and
Rohani (2007), these compartmental models can be divided into two groups: i) population-based models and ii) agentbased or individual-based models. In turn, the first one can be subdivided into deterministic or stochastic (considering
continuous time, ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, delay differential equations or integrodifferential equations) or discrete time (represented by difference equations). The second class can be subdivided into
usually stochastic and usually discrete time.
In the context of population-based models, the deterministic modeling can be represented, in general, by the
interaction among susceptible (denoted by S — an individual which is not yet infected by the disease pathogen),
exposed (denoted by E — an individual in the incubation period after being infected by the disease pathogen, and
with no visible clinical signs), infected/infectious (denoted by I — an individual that can infect others) and, recovered
individuals (denoted by R — an individual who survived after being infected but is no longer infectious and has
developed a natural immunity to the disease pathogen). Considering a population of size N, and based on the disease
nature and on the spreading pattern, the compartmental models can be represented as (Keeling and Rohani, 2007;
Hethcote, 2000):
• Susceptible-Infected (SI): population described by groups of Susceptible and Infected;
• Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR): population described by groups of Susceptible, Infected and Recovered;
• Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS): population also described by groups of Susceptible and Infected. In
this particular case, recovering from some pathologies do not guarantee lasting immunity. Thus, individuals
may become susceptible again;
• Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR): population described by groups of Susceptible Exposed, Infected and Recovered.
It is important to mention that in all these models, terms associated with birth, mortality and vaccination rate
can be added. In addition, according to Keeling and Rohani (2007) and Hethcote (2000), these models can include:
i) time-dependent parameters to represent the effects of seasonality; ii) additional compartments to model vaccinated
and asymptomatic individuals, and different stages of disease progression; iii) multiple groups to model heterogeneity,
3

age, spatial structure or host species; iv) human demographics parameters, for diseases where the time frame of the
disease dynamics is comparable to that of human demographics. Human demographics can be modeled by adopting
constant immigration rate, constant per capita birth and death rates, density-dependent death rate or disease-induced
death rate. Thus, the final model is dependent on assumptions taken during the formulation of the problem.
In this work, the SIR model is adopted, in order to describe the dynamic behavior of COVID-19 epidemic in China.
The choice of this model is due to the study conducted by Roda et al. (2020). These authors demonstrated that the
SIR model performs more adequately than the SEIR model in representing the information related to confirmed case
data. For this reason, the SIR model will be adopted here. The schematic representation of this model is presented in
Fig. 1.

Figure 1: Compartments in the SIR model (Keeling and Rohani, 2007).

Mathematically, this model has the following characteristics:
• An individual is susceptible to an infection and the disease can be transmitted from any infected individual to
any susceptible individual. Each susceptible individual is given by the following relation:
dS
SI
= −β
− µS , S (0) = S 0
(1)
dt
N
where t is the time, β and µ represents the probability of transmission by contact and per capita removal rate,
respectively. In turn, S 0 is the initial condition for the susceptible population.
• Any infected individual may transmit the disease to a susceptible one according to the following relation:
dI
SI
=β
− (γ + µ)I, I(0) = I0
dt
N
where γ denotes the per capita recovery rate. I0 is the initial condition for the infected population.

(2)

• Once an individual has been moved from Infected to Recovered, it is assumed that it is not possible to be
infected again. This condition is described by:
dR
= γI − µR, R(0) = R0
dt
where R0 is the initial condition for the recovered population.

(3)

It is important to emphasize that the population size (N) along time t is defined as N(t) = S (t) + I(t) + R(t). In
practice, the model parameters must be determined to represent a particular epidemic. For this purpose, it is necessary
to formulate and to solve an inverse problem. In the section that describes the methodologies adopted in this work,
more details on the formulation and solution of this problem is presented.
3. Formulation of the Optimal Control Problem
Mathematically, an OCP can be formulated as follows (Bryson and Ho, 1975; Feehery and Barton, 1996; Lobato,
2004). Initially, let
tf
  
 Z
J = Ψ z tf , tf +
L (z, u, t) dt

where z is the vector of state variables, and u is the vector of control variables. Ψ and the integration of L over a
period of time [t0 t f ] are the first and second terms of the performance index, respectively. The minimization problem
is given by
arg min J
u(t), t f

Subject to f (ż, z, u, t) = 0
g(z, u, t) ≤ 0

(5)

p(u, t) ≤ 0
q(z, u, t)|t = t f = 0
with consistent initial conditions given by
ϕ(ż(t0 ), z(t0 ), u(t0 ), t0 ) = 0

(6)

where J(.), L(.), Ψ(.) → IR; f (.), ϕ(.) → IRmz ; z ∈ IRmz ; u ∈ IRmu ; g ∈ IRmg ; p ∈ IRm p and; q ∈ IRmq .
According to the optimal control theory (Bryson and Ho, 1975; Feehery and Barton, 1996), the solution of the
OCP, whose problem is defined by Eqs. (5) and (6), is satisfied by the co-state equations and the stationary condition
given, respectively, by

where H is the Hamiltonian function defined by

This system of equations is known as the Euler-Lagrange equations (optimality conditions), which are characterized as Boundary Value Problems (BVPs). Thus, to solve this model, an appropriated methodology must be used, as
for example, the Shooting Method or the Collocation Method (Bryson and Ho, 1975). As mentioned by Bryson and
Ho (1975) and Feehery and Barton (1996), the main difficulties associated with OCPs are the following: the existence
of end-point conditions (or region constraints) implies multipliers and associated complementary conditions that significantly increase the complexity of solving the BVP using an indirect method; the existence of constraints involving
the state variables and the application of slack variables method may introduce differential algebraic equations of
higher index; the Lagrange multipliers may be very sensitive to the initial conditions.
4. Differential Evolution and Multi-objective Optimization Differential Evolution - A Brief Description
4.1. Differential Evolution
Differential Evolution is a powerful optimization technique to solve mono-objective optimization problems, proposed by Storn and Price (1997). This evolutionary strategy differs from other population-based algorithms in the
schemes considered to generate a new candidate to solution of the optimization problem (Storn and Price, 1997;
Price et al., 2005; Lobato and Steffen, 2011). The population evolution proposed by DE follows three fundamental
steps: mutation, crossover and selection. The optimization process starts by creating a vector containing NP individuals, called initial population, which are randomly distributed over the entire search space. During Gmax generations,
each of the individuals that constitute the current population are subject to the procedures performed by the genetic
operators of the algorithm.
In the first step, the mutation operator creates a trial vector by
adding the

viduals to a third member of the population, by v(G+1)

κ3 , where j = 1, . . . , NP. The parameter F
j
represents the scale factor, which controls the contribution added by the vector difference, such that F ∈ [0, 2]. In turn,
Storn and Price (1997) proposed various mutation schemes for the generation of trial vectors (candidate solutions) by
combining the vectors that are randomly chosen from the current population, such as:
5

• rand/1: x = xκ1 + F xκ2 − xκ3



• rand/2: x = xκ1 + F xκ2 − xκ3 + xκ4 − xκ5

• best/1: x = xbest + F xκ2 − xκ3



• best/2: x = xbest + F xκ2 − xκ3 + xκ4 − xκ5


• rand/best/1: x = xκ1 + F xbest − xκ1 + xκ1 − xκ2


• rand/best/2: x = xκ1 + F xbest − xκ1 + F xκ1 − xκ2 + xκ3 − xκ4
The second step of the algorithm is the crossover procedure. This genetic operator creates new candidates by
combining the attributes of the individuals of the original population with those resulting in the mutation step. The
vector u(G+1)
= v(G+1)
if randb (k) ≤ CR or k = rnbr ( j). Otherwise, u(G+1)
= x(G)
jk
jk
jk
jk , such as k = 1, . . . , d, where
d denotes the dimension of the problem and randb (k) ∈ [0, 1] is a random real number with uniform distribution.
The choice of the attributes of a given individual is defined by the crossover probability, represented by CR, such that
CR ∈ [0, 1] is a constant parameter defined by the user. In turn, rnbr ( j) ∈ [1, d] is a randomly chosen index.
After the generation of the trial vector by the steps of mutation and crossover, the evolution of the best individuals
is defined according to a greedy strategy, during the selection step. Price et al. (2005) have defined some simple rules
for choosing the key parameters of DE for general applications. Typically, one might choose NP in the range from 5
to 10 times the dimension (d) of the problem. In the case of F, it is suggested taking a value ranging between 0.4 and
1.0. Initially, F = 0.5 may be a good choice. In the case of premature convergence, F and NP may be increased.
4.2. Multi-objective Optimization Differential Evolution
The multi-objective optimization problem (MOP) is an extension of the mono-objective optimization problem.
Due to the conflict between the objectives, there is no single point capable of optimizing all functions simultaneously.
Instead, the best solutions that can be obtained are called optimal Pareto solutions, which form the Pareto curve (Deb,
2001). The notion of optimality in a MOP is different from the one regarding optimization problems with a single
objective. The most common idea about multi-objective optimization found in the literature was originally proposed
by Edgeworth (1881), and further generalized by Pareto (1896). One solution is said to be dominant over another, if
it is not worse in any of the objectives, and if it is strictly better in at least one of the objectives. As an optimal Pareto
solution dominates any other feasible point in the search space, all of these solutions are considered better than any
other. Therefore, multi-objective optimization consists of finding a set of points that represents the best balance in
relation to minimizing all objectives simultaneously, that is, a collection of solutions that relates the objectives, which
are in conflict with each other, in most cases.
Let F (x) = (F1 (x) , . . . , Fm (x))T be the objective vector such that Fk : P → IR, for k = 1, . . . , m, where
x ∈ P is called decision vector and its entries are called decision variables and m is the number of objective functions.
Mathematically, a MOP is defined as (Deb, 2001; Lobato, 2008):
min F (x)
Subject to Gi (x) ≤ 0
H j (x) = 0
xinf ≤ x ≤ xsup
where G is the vector of inequality constraints and H is the vector of equality constraints.
Due to the favorable outcome of DE in solving mono-objective optimization problems, for different fields of
science and engineering, Lobato and Steffen (2011) proposed the Multi-Objective Differential Evolution (MODE)
algorithm to solve multi-objective optimization problems. Basically, this evolutionary strategy differs from other
algorithms by the incorporation of two operators to the original DE algorithm, the mechanisms of rank ordering (Deb,
2001; Zitzler and Thiele, 1999), and exploration of the neighborhood for potential solution candidates (Hu et al.,
2005). A brief description of the algorithm is presented next.
At first, an initial population of size NP is randomly generated, and all objectives are evaluated. All dominated
solutions are removed from the population by using the operator Fast Non-Dominated Sorting (Deb, 2001). This
6

procedure is repeated until each candidate vector becomes a member of a front. Three parents generated by using DE
algorithm are selected at random in the population. Then, an offspring is generated from these parents (this process
continues until NP children are generated). Starting from population P1 of size 2NP, neighbors are generated to each
one of the individuals of the population. These neighbors are classified according to the dominance criterion, and only
the non-dominated neighbors (P2 ) are put together with P1 , in order to form P3 . The population P3 is then classified
according to the dominance criterion. If the number of individuals of the population P3 is larger than a predefined
number, the population is truncated according to the Crowding Distance (Deb, 2001) criterion. This metric describes
the density of candidate solutions surrounding an arbitrary vector. A complete description of MODE is presented by
Lobato and Steffen (2011).
5. Methodology
5.1. Inverse Problem
As mentioned earlier, the first objective of this work is to determine the parameters of the SIR model adopted to
predict the evolution of COVID-19 epidemic considering experimental data from China. In this case, it is necessary
to formulate and to solve an inverse problem. It arises from the requirement of determining parameters of theoretical
models in such a way that it can be employed to simulate the behavior of the system for different operating conditions.
Basically, the estimation procedure consists of obtaining the model parameters by the minimization of the difference
between calculated and experimental values.
In this work, it is assumed that, since the outbreak persists for a relatively short period of time, the rate of births
and deaths by natural cases or other reasons of the population is insignificant. Thus, we take µ = 0, since there
are probably few births/deaths in the corresponding period. We are interested in the determination of the following
parameters of the SIR model: β, γ and I0 . It is important to mention that I0 is used to define the initial condition of all
dependent variables of the model. Let

subject to Eqs. (1) – (3), where Ii and Iisim are the experimental and simulated infected population, respectively,
and M represents the total number of experimental data available. In this case, the SIR model must be simulated
considering the parameters calculated by DE, in order to obtain the number of infected people estimated by the model
and, consequently, the value of the objective function (F ). As the number of measured data, M, is usually much larger
than the number of parameters to be estimated, the inverse problem is formulated as a finite dimensional optimization
problem in which we aim at minimizing F (Moura Neto and Silva Neto, 2013).
5.2. Optimal Control Problem
In order to formulate both OCPs, the parameters estimated considering the proposed inverse problem are used.
As proposed by Neilan and Lenhart (2010) and Biswas et al. (2014), a new variable W, which denotes the number
of vaccines used, is introduced in order to determine the optimal control strategy for vaccine administration. For this
purpose, the total amount of vaccines available during the whole period of time is proportional to uS . Physically, u
represents the portion of susceptible individuals being vaccinated per unit of time (Biswas et al., 2014). It is important
to mention that u acts as the control variable of such system. If u is equal to zero there is no vaccination, and u equals
to one indicates that all susceptible population is vaccinated. A schematic diagram of the disease transmission among
the individuals for the SIR model with vaccination is shown in Fig. 2.
Mathematically, the SIR model considering the presence of control is written as:

where W0 is the initial condition for the total amount of vaccines. It is important to emphasize that the population size
(N) after the inclusion of this new variable W along the time t is defined as N(t) = S (t) + I(t) + R(t) + W(t).
The first formulation aims to determine the optimal vaccine administration (u) to minimize the infected population,
represented by Ω1 . Thus, let

The OCP is defined as

u

subject to Eqs. (12) – (15) and umin ≤ u ≤ umax , where t0 and t f represents the initial and the final time, respectively,
and umin and umax are the lower and upper bounds for the control variable, respectively.
The second formulation considers two objectives, i.e., the determination of the optimal vaccine administration,
in order to minimize the number of infected individuals and, at the same time, to minimize the number of vaccines
needed. The total number of vaccines can be determined by
Z tf
Ω2 ≡
u dt
(18)
t0

whereas the number of infected people is given by Eq. (16). Thus, the multi-objective optimization problem is
formulated as
arg min (Ω1 , Ω2 )

(19)

u

subject to Eqs. (12) – (15) and umin ≤ u ≤ umax . In both problems, the control variable u must be discretized. In this
context, the approach proposed consists
h
ion transforming the original OCP into a nonlinear optimization problem. For
this purpose, let the time interval 0, t f be discretized using Nelem time nodes, with each node denoted by ti , where
i = 0, . . . , Nelem − 1, such that t0 ≤ ti ≤ t f . For each of the Nelem − 1 subintervals of time, given by [ti , ti+1 ], the
control variable is considered constant by parts, that is, u (t) = ui for ti ≤ t < ti+1 , where umin ≤ ui ≤ umax .
In order to obtain an optimal control strategy for vaccine administration, that can be used in medical practice,
we consider the bang-bang control which consists of a binary feedback control that turns either “on” (in our case,
when u = umax = 1) or “off” (when u = umin = 0) at different time points, determined by the system feedback. In
this case, as the control strategy u is constant by parts, the proposed optimal control problem has Nelem − 2 unknown
parameters, since the control variable at the start and end times are known. The resulting nonlinear optimization
problems are solved by using the DE, in the case of the mono-objective problem, given by Eq. (17), and MODE, for
the multi-objective problem defined by Eq. (19).

6. Results and Discussion
6.1. Inverse Problem
In order to apply the proposed methodology to solve the inverse problem described previously, the following steps
are established:
• Objective function: minimize the functional F , given by Eq. (11);
• Design space: 0.1 ≤ β ≤ 0.6, 0.04 ≤ γ ≤ 0.6 and 10−8 ≤ I0 ≤ 0.5 (all defined after preliminary executions);
• DE parameters: population size (25), number of generations (100), perturbation rate (0.8), crossover rate (0.8)
and strategy rand/1 (as presented in Section 4.1). The evolutionary process is halted when a prescribed number
of generations is reached (in this case, 100). Twenty independent runs of the algorithm were made, with different
seeds for the generation of the initial population;
• To evaluate the SIR model during the optimization process, the Runge-Kutta-Fehelberg method was used;
• Initial conditions: S (0) = 1 − I0 , I(0) = I0 , and R(0) = 0. In this case, I0 is chosen as the first reported data in
relation to the number of infected individuals in the time series;
• The data used in the formulation of the inverse problem refer to the population of China, from January 22 to
April 2, 2020, taken from Johns Hopkins Resource Center (2020 (accessed April 03, 2020).
Table 1 presents the results (best and standard deviation) obtained using DE. It is possible to observe that DE
was able to obtain good estimates for the unknown parameters and, consequently, for the objective function, as can
be verified, by visual inspection of Fig. 3. These results were obtained, as mentioned earlier, from 20 runs. Thus,
the values of the standard deviation demonstrate that the algorithm converges, practically, to the same optimum in all
executions (best). Physically, the probability of transmission by contact in the Chinese population is superior to 35 %
(β equal to 0.3566). In addition, γ equal to 0.0858 implies a moderate per capita recovery rate. One must consider
that, since many cases may not be reported, for different reasons, as for example an asymptomatic infected person,
the value of I0 may vary, as well as the behavior of the model over time.

It is important to emphasize that when choosing I0 as a design variable, the initial condition for the susceptible
population (S 0 ) is automatically defined, that is, S 0 = 1 − I0 , since there is not, at the beginning of an epidemic,
a considerable number of recovered individuals and, thus, R0 = 0 is a reasonable choice. In this case, the available
data refer to the number of infected individuals and these represent only the portion of individuals in the population
that have actually been diagnosed. This is due, among other facts, to the lack of tests to diagnose the disease of all
individuals who present symptoms. Thus, as the number of susceptible individuals at the beginning of the epidemic
is dependent on the value of I0 , in this work it is considered that the total size of the population, typically defined
as N = S + I + R, is actually a portion of the total population, since the number of infected individuals available is
also a fraction of those who have actually been diagnosed. In this case, the results presented below represent only
the fraction of the infected population that was diagnosed and, consequently, the fraction of individuals susceptible
to contracting the disease. Qualitatively, the results presented are proportional to the number of individuals in the
population who were diagnosed with the disease.
In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the solutions obtained, in terms of the objective function, the best solution
(β = 0.3566, γ = 0.0858, and I0 = 0.0038) was analyzed considering a perturbation rate given by δ. For this purpose,
9

the range [(1 − δ) θk , (1 + δ) θk ] was adopted, for k ⊂ {1, 2, 3}, where θ = (β, γ, I0 ). Thus, in each analysis, one
design variable is perturbed and the value of F in relation to this noise is computed.
Figure 4 presents the sensitivity analysis for each estimated parameter, in terms of the objective function, considering δ equal to 0.25 and 100 equally spaced points in the interval of interest. In these figures, it is possible to observe
that the variation of each parameter, as expected, in a worst value for the F . In addition, that the design variable more
sensible to δ parameter is the β parameter, since a wider range of values for the F were obtained.

6.2. Mono-objective Optimal Control Problem
We consider two distinct analysis in this section, in order to evaluate the proposed methodology considered to
solve the mono-objective optimization problem: i) solution of the proposed mono-objective optimal control problem
and; ii) evaluation on the influence of the maximum amount of vaccine, by defining an inequality constraint. For this
purpose, the following steps are established:
• Objective function: minimize the functional Ω1 , given by Eq. (17);
• The previously calculated parameters (β, γ and I0 ) are employed in the simulation of the SIR model;

10

• Design space: 0 ≤ ti ≤ t f , for i = 1, . . . , tNelem −1 , and Nelem = 10. It is important to mention that this value was
chosen after preliminary runs, i.e., increasing this value do not produce better results in terms of the objective
function;
• DE parameters: population size (25), number of generations (100), perturbation rate (0.8), crossover rate (0.8)
and strategy rand/1 (as presented in Section 4.1). The evolutionary process is halted when a prescribed number
of generations is reached (in this case, 100). 20 independent runs of the algorithm were made, with different
seeds for the generation of the initial population;
• To evaluate the SIR model during the optimization process, the Runge-Kutta-Fehelberg method was used;
• Initial conditions: S (0) = 1 − I0 , I(0) = I0 , and R(0) = 0. As in the previous case, I0 is chosen as the first
reported data in relation to the number of infected individuals in the time series;
Table 2 presents the best solution obtained by using DE and considering ten control elements, in terms of the
number of individuals. The objective function obtained (about 8945.4278 individuals) is less than the case in which
no control is considered (about 1594607.2234 individuals), i.e., the number of infected individuals is lower when
a control strategy is considered (see Figs. 5(a) and 5(c)). If the number of infected individuals is reduced, due to
control action, the number of susceptible individuals rapidly decreases until its minimum value (1.4382 × 10−3 ) and,
consequently, the number of recovered individuals rapidly increase until its maximum value (767.5187 individuals),
as observed in Figs. 5(b) and 5(d), respectively. In terms of the action regarding the control variable, the effectiveness
is readily verified in the beginning of the vaccine administration. Further the administration is conducted in specific
intervals of time, which preserves the health of the population, as observed in Fig. 5(e). The evolution of the number of
vaccinated individuals is presented in Fig. 5(f). In this case, due to control action, the vaccinated population increase
rapidly until the value is saturated (141835.1405). In summary, all obtained profiles are coherent from the physical
point of view. Finally, it is important to mention that the standard deviation for each result is, approximately, equal to
10−3 , which demonstrates the robustness of DE to solve the proposed mono-objective optimal control problem.

In this model, the evaluation of the number of vaccinated individuals is associated with an inequality constraint.
This relation bounds the quantity of individuals that can be vaccinated due to the limitation related to the production
of vaccines. For this purpose, two control elements are incorporated to the model: if W(t1 ) ≤ Wlim , then u = 1.
Otherwise, u = 0 (t1 is the instant of time that W(t1 ) = Wlim , and Wlim is the upper bound for the number of vaccinated
individuals). Table 3 presents the results obtained considering different quantities for the parameter Wlim . As expected,
the insertion of this constraint implies in limiting the maximum number of vaccinated individuals and, consequently,
a lower number of individuals are vaccinated. The increase of the parameter Wlim implies in the reduction of the
objective function value, in number of infected and recovered individuals and, consequently, an increase in the number
of susceptible individuals. These analysis can be observed in Fig. 6.

6.3. Multi-objective Optimal Control Problem
As presented previously, a multi-objective optimal control problem was proposed in order to minimize the number
of infected individuals (Ω1 ) and to minimize the quantity of vaccine administered (Ω2 ). To evaluate the proposed
methodology considered to solve this multi-objective optimization problem, the following steps are established:
• Objective functions: minimize both Ω1 and Ω2 together, which are defined by Eq. (19);
• The previously calculated parameters (β, γ and I0 ) are employed in the simulation of the SIR model;
• Design space: 0 ≤ ti ≤ t f , for i = 1, . . . , tNelem −1 , and Nelem = 10.

(0.8), number of pseudo-curves (10), reduction rate (0.9), and strategy rand/1 (as presented in Section 4.1). The
stopping criterion adopted is the same as in the previous cases.
• To evaluate the SIR model during the optimization process, the Runge-Kutta-Fehelberg method was used;
• Initial conditions: S (0) = 1 − I0 , I(0) = I0 , R(0) = 0, and W(0) = 0.
Figure 7(a) presents the Pareto curve and three points (A, B and C) belonging to this curve, as shown in Table 4. It
must be stressed that the Pareto curve presents the non-dominated solutions, as described in Section 4.2. The point A
represents the best solution in terms of the minimization of the number of infected individuals, with Ω1 = 8963.7775,
13

that is, the number of infected individuals at t f assume its lowest value, which is equal to I(t f ) = 769.0921, but
considering a larger amount of vaccine administered (Ω2 = 6.9358). On the other hand, the point B represents the
best solution in terms of the quantity of vaccine administered, with Ω2 = 1.2940, i.e, the minimization of such value
when t = t f . However, for this point, the number of infected individuals is high (Ω1 = 56644.0350). The point C is a
compromise solution, which is a good solution in terms of both objectives simultaneously, with intermediary values
for both objectives, Ω1 = 13298.2440 and Ω2 =2.3034.

In Figures 7(b) – 7(f) are presented the susceptible-infectious-removed populations profiles, control variable strategy and number of vaccinated individuals’ profiles considering the points presented in Table 4. In Figure 7(e) it is
possible to observe the activation of the control variable when vaccine is introduced. Besides, in both results obtained,
the action of such treatment is readily verified in the population during a larger interval of time in the beginning of
the vaccine administration. In Figures 7(b), 7(c), 7(d) and 7(f) the susceptible, infectious, recovered and number of
vaccines profiles are presented, respectively, for each point described in Table 4. In these figures we can visualize the
importance of the control strategy used. For example, the points A and C are good choices in terms of the minimization of infected individuals, although the point A has a highest value in terms of the objective Ω2 . On the other hand,
point B is satisfactory in terms of minimizing the amount of vaccines administered, but, from a clinical point of view,
it is not a good choice, as the number of infected individuals is not minimized.
7. Conclusions
In this contribution it is proposed and solved an inverse problem to simulate the dynamic behavior of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) considering real data from China. The parameters of the compartmental SIR (Susceptible,
Infectious and Recovered) model were determined by using Differential Evolution (DE). Considering the parameters
obtained with the solution of the proposed inverse problem, two optimal control problems were proposed. The first
consists on minimizing the quantity of infected individuals. In this case, an inequality that represents the quantity of
vaccines available was analyzed. The second optimal control problem considers minimizing together the quantity of
infected individuals and the prescribed vaccine during the treatment. This problem was solved using Multi-Objective
Differential Evolution (MODE). In general, the solution of the proposed multi-objective optimal control problem
provides information from which an optimal strategy for vaccine administration can be defined.
The use of mathematical models associated with optimization tools may contribute to decision making in situations
of this type. It is important to emphasize that the quality of the results is dependent on the quality of the experimental
data considered. In this context, one may cite the following limitations regarding the SIR model: i) poor quality of
reported official data and; ii) the simplifications of the model, as for example terms as birth rate, differential vaccination
rate, weather changes and its effect on the epidemiology. Finally, it is worth mentioning that the problem formulated
in this work is not normally considered in the specialized literature (only the minimization of the infected individuals
is normally proposed). In this context, the formulation of the multi-objective optimization problem and its solution by
using MODE represents the main contribution of this work.
