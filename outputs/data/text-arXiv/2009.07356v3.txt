Abstract
We present an interpretable high-resolution spatio-temporal model to estimate COVID-19 deaths
together with confirmed cases one-week ahead of the current time, at the county-level and weekly
aggregated, in the United States. A notable feature of our spatio-temporal model is that it considers the
(a) temporal auto- and pairwise correlation of the two local time series (confirmed cases and death of the
COVID-19), (b) dynamics between locations (propagation between counties), and (c) covariates such as
local within-community mobility and social demographic factors. The within-community mobility and
demographic factors, such as total population and the proportion of the elderly, are included as important
predictors since they are hypothesized to be important in determining the dynamics of COVID-19. To
reduce the model’s high-dimensionality, we impose sparsity structures as constraints and emphasize the
impact of the top ten metropolitan areas in the nation, which we refer (and treat within our models)
as hubs in spreading the disease. Our retrospective out-of-sample county-level predictions were able to
forecast the subsequently observed COVID-19 activity accurately. The proposed multi-variate predictive
models were designed to be highly interpretable, with clear identification and quantification of the most
important factors that determine the dynamics of COVID-19. Ongoing work involves incorporating more
covariates, such as education and income, to improve prediction accuracy and model interpretability.

Introduction

The global spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has affected
nearly everyone’s lives on the planet. Even the largest economies’ resources have been strained due to the
large infectivity and transmissibility of COVID-19. As the number of cases of COVID-19 continues increasing,
understanding finer-grained spatio-temporal dynamics of this disease and some of the leading factors affecting
disease transmissions is critical to helping officials make policy decisions and curb the further spread of the
disease.
Most of the previous research aimed at studying the spread of COVID-19 has focused on two key
measurements: the number of confirmed cases and the number of deaths. Cases going up or down over
time shed light on the rate of spread of COVID-19 at a given point in time — but it is only valid if enough
people get tested. The limited testing ability resulted in a severe underestimation of COVID-19 cases in the
pandemic’s early stages [35]. For example, when there was not enough testing capacity, as was the case in New
York City in March 2020, the number of cases reported was an undercount of actual cases, estimated to be
much larger (up by a factor of 10) [23, 40]. Some studies have circumvented underestimation by considering
the case positivity rate, which measures the percentage of total COVID-19 tests conducted that are positive.
However, most of the widely-used COVID-19 data sets, such as the COVID Tracking Project [47], only collect
the total number of people with a completed polymerize chain reaction (PCR) test that returns positive as
reported by the state or territory, which has a much lower spatial resolution (state-level) in comparison with
the cases and deaths data (county-level). Such coarse-grained testing numbers would introduce extra noise to
our model and would most likely be incapable of improving the confirmed case prediction accuracy at the
county level. Deaths are also an important metric that most people care about regarding the virus’s ultimate
1

epidemiological impact. In contrast to the number of confirmed cases, the number of deaths is a good and
accurate indicator for evaluating how serious a burden this pandemic is causing, not only on health care
systems but also on the general public’s mental health and well-being. Some epidemiological studies, such as
[33], also recommend tracking deaths, even though deaths lag behind new cases, typically by two weeks to a
month.
A large amount of fine-grained data offers a unique opportunity to study the disease’s spread dynamics
from a micro-level view. For the United States, several teams have been working on collecting comprehensive
COVID-19 tracking data, including daily counts of cases and deaths at the county level. Such data gives
us a general picture of how the virus is spreading across metropolitan and micropolitan counties and how
such dynamics are evolving. Besides considering the cases and the deaths, we also aim to study other critical
local factors in transmitting the COVID-19. Recent studies [38] on the spread of COVID-19 show that
besides the distance to the epicenter, other factors, such as subway and airport, are positively connected
with the virus transmission. Moreover, both urban areas and population density are positively associated
with the spread of COVID-19 after the outbreak. The proportion of the elderly population has also been
identified as a key factor in the death rate. Therefore, we consider the within-community mobility and two
critical demographic factors by taking advantage of the COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports [21] and
the American Community Survey (ACS) [8]. These two data sets are publicly available and include detailed
county-level statistics that provide insights into what has changed in response to policies aimed at combating
the COVID-19 and what factors may affect the disease’s transmission. As illustrated in Fig. 1, in our model,
we assume the numbers of cases and deaths in each county depend on the neighboring counties and major
metropolitan areas in the U.S., which we refer to as hubs in spreading the disease. Local community mobility
and demographic factors, including population and elderly population, are considered local covariates in the
model, which also play a crucial role in the final number of deaths.
In this paper, we use a data-driven method incorporating a large-scale data set from multiple sources to
predict the deaths and the confirmed cases of COVID-19 at the county level in the United States. Since death
is a more accurate indicator for assessing the spread of the virus, we emphasize predicting county-level deaths’
trajectories instead of the confirmed cases. Our method’s most notable contribution is considering the spatial
structure among hubs and neighboring counties in modeling the cross-correlation between cases and deaths.

Figure 1: An example of spatio-temporal covariates in our model for Coconino County, Arizona. Based
on the counties in the U.S. as fundamental units, we assume the number of confirmed cases and deaths of
COVID-19 reported in a given county are jointly related to the numbers reported in its adjacent counties
(they are Kane, San Juan, Navajo, Gila, Yavapai, Mohave for Coconino in this example) and ten selected
nationwide hubs (including San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, Atlanta, Miami, Washington, D.C.,
Boston, and New York). The numbers of cases and deaths also depend on some local covariates, such as
community mobility level and some counties’ demographic factors.
2

We also present the effect of a wide variety of geographic community mobility and social demographic factors
on the spread of COVID-19. Our approach drastically differs from previous studies [14, 6, 1], in which the
number of cases and deaths, and other covariates, including the community mobility and social demographic
factors, are interlinked through a vector autoregressive process. Our model shows that these hubs play a
pivotal role in spreading the disease. We also find that both cases and deaths are significantly related to the
local level’s total population and that deaths are also positively associated with the proportion of the elderly
population. Additionally, we found that confirmed cases are not significantly related to the proportion of the
elderly population, which may prove that the disease was mostly circulating among young people in its later
stage. In particular, while we identify a spike in cases since the beginning of the summer, we do not observe
a clear spike in deaths. This may be explained by the fact that a more significant proportion of young people,
who are generally at lower risk of death, were infected in the more recent pandemic stages.
The remainder of the article is organized as follows. We first review related works in the rest of this
section, followed by describing the data sets we have used in Section 2. Section 3 presents our proposed
vector autoregressive model with spatial structure incorporated. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
model and discuss its interpretation in Section 4. Lastly, the article concludes with discussions and future
research directions in Section 5.
Related work Compartmental models have been widely used in infectious disease epidemiological studies.
In the SIR model [22], one of the simplest compartmental models, the population is assigned to three
components: S (susceptible), I (infectious), and R (recovered). These variables (S, I, and R) represent
the number of people in each compartment. The transition between different compartments is modeled
using a set of coupled differential equations. Based on the SIR model, many variants have been proposed
in the last decades, including the SIRD model [18, 9] that considers deceased individuals, and the SEIR
model [25, 57, 26] that considers exposed period during which individuals have been infected but are not yet
infectious themselves, to name a few. The total population is usually assumed to be fixed in the compartmental
models; therefore, it works well when modeling nationwide data. However, in our high-resolution modeling,
each county’s population is of high variability due to dynamics across the county. Therefore, we use a
spatio-temporal model instead to capture the influence of major big cities and neighboring counties without
fixing each county’s population.
Besides compartmental models, much work has been done on predicting the total number of COVID-19
cases, and deaths without considering the spatial correlation across regions [39, 55, 43, 27]. For example,
recent work [7] introduces a regional model based on a self-exciting point process to forecast the total
number of infections for multiple countries. Another work [20] provides a state-wise analysis and infections
prediction for India’s states by considering three growth models, namely, the logistic, the exponential, and the
susceptible-infectious-susceptible models. Machine-learning-based approaches have also been considered in
modeling COVID-19 outbreak [3]. Some work [54] attempts to use a neural network to model accumulative
case counts for multiple countries. Recurrent neural network-based methods [24, 58] have been applied to
model the temporal dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak. Our approach differs from these studies in two
ways: (1) our model provides finer-grained predictions for the cases and deaths; (2) we model the multivariate
time series by considering the spatial correlation across regions as well as the correlation with the demographic
factors, which is more interpretable than the machine-learning-based methods.
Understanding the COVID-19 outbreak’s spatial spread is critical to predicting local outbreaks and
developing public health policies during the early stages of COVID-19. However, studies evaluating the
spatial spread of the COVID-19 pandemic are scarce or limited [45]. Previous studies have described the
spatial spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Beijing and mainland China [42, 17, 30, 29, 15]
using limited or localized data. One study also considered the various connections between a few cities to
calculate the spatial association [42]. There is also prior work using the multivariate Hawkes process to model
the conditional intensity of new COVID-19 cases and deaths in the U.S. at the county level [12], without
considering the influence of the big cities and other important demographic factors. The work of [4] develops
two types of county-level predictive models based on the exponential and the linear model, respectively. It
focuses on modeling the dynamics of cumulative death counts. In [31], the graph neural networks are adopted
to capture the spatio-temporal dynamics between various features; However, the lack of interpretability
hinders from further understanding the mechanism of the COVID-19 outbreak.
There is also a wide array of previous research based on autoregressive models that relate to our work. In

[2, 5, 16, 34, 49, 52], the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) is used to predict future data
for different countries. [41] uses an autoregressive-based time series model to predict the total number of the
world’s confirmed cases. [50, 11] adopt the autoregressive artificial neural networks to predict the number of
accumulative cases in Egypt. A more recent similar article [32] studies the state-wise cases in Pakistan using
the vector autoregressive model. However, two significant differences are (1) the spatial resolution of their
predictions is much lower than our results; (2) these models do not consider the spatial correlation between
places in the vicinity and cities served as major transportation hubs.
There are also various efforts studying impacts from other aspects, such as temperature, humidity [51, 46],
age, gender [15], and travel restrictions [13, 36]. Here, in our case, N = I × T = 157, 200. Most of these
studies are constrained on a relatively small scale because of limited data at the pandemic’s early stage.

Data

We have used three comprehensive datasets in this study, including confirmed cases and deaths of COVID19, community mobility data, and demographic census data. These datasets play an important role in
understanding the spatio-temporal correlation of COVID-19 transmission.
Confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19 We used the dataset from The New York Times [56], based
on state and local health agencies’ reports. The data is the product of dozens of journalists working across
several time zones to monitor news conferences, analyze data releases, and seek public officials’ clarification
on how they categorize cases. The data includes two parts: (i) confirmed cases are counts of individuals
whose coronavirus infections were confirmed by a laboratory test and reported by a federal, state, territorial,
or local government agency. Only tests that detect viral RNA in a sample are considered confirmatory. These

are often called molecular or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests; (ii) confirmed
deaths are individuals who have died and meet the definition for a confirmed COVID-19 case. Some states
reconcile these records with death certificates to remove deaths from their count, where COVID-19 is not
listed as the cause of death. These data have removed non-COVID-19 deaths among confirmed cases according
to the information released by health departments, i.e., in homicide, suicide, car crashes, or drug overdose.
All cases and deaths are counted on the date they are first announced. In practice, we have observed periodic
weekly oscillations in daily reported cases and deaths, which could have been caused by testing bias (higher
testing rates on certain days of the week). To reduce such bias, we aggregate the number of cases and deaths
of each county by week.
Community mobility As global communities respond to COVID-19, we have heard from public health
officials that the same type of aggregated, anonymized insights we use in products such as Google Maps could
be helpful as they make critical decisions to combat COVID-19. The COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports
[21] aim to provide insights into what has changed in response to policies aimed at combating COVID-19.
The reports record people’s movement by county daily, across various categories such as retail and recreation,
groceries and pharmacies, parks, transit stations, workplaces, and residential. The data shows how visitors to
(or time spent in) categorized places change compared to the baseline days (in percentage). The negative
percentage represents the level of mobility is lower than the baseline, and the positive percentage represents
the opposite. A baseline day represents a normal value for that day of the week. The baseline day is the
median value from the five weeks from January 3rd to February 6th, 2020. To match the temporal resolution
with the COVID-19 data and detrend the weekly pattern, we aggregate each county’s mobility data by week.
Examples of three categories have been shown in Fig. 2.
Demographic census Data from the American Community Survey (ACS) [8], provided by the U.S. Census
Bureau, is a comprehensive source for demographic information about the population, age, and economic
status in each zip code region in the U.S. Unlike the census data, which takes place every ten years, the
ACS is conducted every year. The latest ACS data are available in the year 2018. Some demographic
factors help us understand how population distribution affects the spread of disease (by correlating the local
socio-economic profile with its confirmed cases and deaths). These factors contain essential information about
the development and economic growth of different areas. To match the spatial resolution with the COVID-19
data, we aggregate the zip code regions’ demographic data in the same county. We selected two leading
factors that affect the spread and the infection of the disease, i.e., total population and the proportion of the
elderly with an age of 65 or older [44].

Problem setup and notations

Consider confirmed cases and deaths of the COVID-19 in N counties and T weeks (recall that we aggregated
these numbers by week to reduce bias). Let I = {i = 1, . . . , N } be the set of counties and T = {t = 1, . . . , T }
be the set of weeks starting from March 15th, 2020 until January 17th, 2021. We assume there is a set
of counties I 0 = {i = 1, . . . , N 0 } ⊂ I playing a significant role in spreading the disease due to their high
population density and well-developed transportation network connecting to other major cities in the U.S..
We refer to these counties as hubs, and the selected hubs are marked in Fig. 1. Denote the number of
confirmed cases and deaths in county i ∈ I and week t ∈ T as ci,t ∈ Z+ and di,t ∈ Z+ , respectively. In our
setting, T = 27, N = 3144, and N 0 = 10.
We also consider K mobility categories and L demographic factors as covariates of the model, where K = 6
and L = 2. Let K = {k = 1, . . . , K} be the set of community mobility categories and L = {l = 1, . . . , L}
be the set of demographic factors. Denote the mobility score in category k ∈ K for county i ∈ I in week
t ∈ T as mi,k,t ∈ R, and denote the data of demographic factor l ∈ L for county i ∈ I as zi,l ∈ R+ .
Let ct := [c1,t , . . . , cN,t ]| and dt := [d1,t , . . . , dN,t ]| denote the confirmed cases and deaths in week t ∈ T ,
respectively. Let mk,t := [m1,k,t , . . . , mN,k,t ]| denote the score of community mobility category k ∈ K for all
counties i ∈ I in week t ∈ T . Let z l := [z1,l , . . . , zN,l ]| denote the data of demographic factor l ∈ L for all
counties i ∈ I.

3.2

Spatio-temporal vector autoregressive model

We consider a linear spatio-temporal autoregressive model where the number of confirmed cases (ct ) and
deaths (dt ) is a time series regressed on their previous values and the mobility covariate mk,t and demographic
covariate z l . Denote the time window’s length that we consider in the past (the memory depth) as p. Based
on previous studies [53], it is known that the COVID-19 virus has an incubation period of around two weeks.
Therefore, we choose p = 2 throughout this paper.
Define the augmented observation vector as (which contains both confirmed case and death counts):

In our model (1), the first-term captures the dependence on past confirmed cases and deaths; the second
term captures the influence of past local community mobility; the third term captures the influence of local
demography, which is held constant over time. Specifically, B τ and Aτ contain the autoregressive coefficients
for the number of confirmed cases and deaths, respectively; H τ describes the dependence of the current
number of deaths on the number of confirmed cases in τ weeks ago. These three matrices share the same
sparse spatial structure, where entry at (i, j) is zero if county i and county j is not adjacent, and none of them
is the hub. Formally, the set of adjacency pairs is defined by A = {(i, j) ∈ I : (i, j) is an edge of the graph G};
each node of G denotes a county, and there is an edge between two nodes whenever the corresponding counties
are geographically adjacent or one of them is a hub. The µk,τ , νk,τ , υl , and ζl are four scalar coefficients.
To be specific, µk,τ , νk,τ represent the coefficients for the local community mobility score in category k in τ
weeks ago with respect to the corresponding number of confirmed cases and deaths, respectively. Similarly,
υl , ζl represent the coefficients for local demographic factor l with respect to the corresponding number of
confirmed cases and deaths, respectively. The spatial covariance matrix between the noise at counties i and j
is denoted as the (i, j)-th entry of Ση ; it is a function of their Euclidean distance sij and is parameterized by
η. Some commonly used spatial models include: Gaussian model [37], Exponential model [19], and Matérn
model [19]. Here we adopt the exponential spatial covariance model Ση (i, j) = η exp{−ηsij }, where η is a
pre-specified parameter, which controls the rate of spatial decay. In this paper, we specify a reasonable value
of the parameter η = 103 .
We aim to fit the model (1) for confirmed cases and deaths jointly by minimizing the prediction error.
Define the set of parameters θ = {Λ, ω, γ} ∈ Θ, where Θ is the set containing all feasible values. For a
pre-specified hyper-parameter δ ∈ [0, 1], the loss function is defined as a weighted combination of quadratic
loss functions for death and confirmed case residuals:

The hyper-parameter δ controls the proportion of death prediction loss. In practical terms, we emphasize
the importance of death, and hence we choose δ = 0.9 empirically. The reason is that it is known that the
confirmed cases are quite noisy and can depend on the capacity of testings.
The parameters θ can be estimated by solving the following optimization with a regularization function:
min `(θ) + λ1 R(θ),

θ∈Θ

where λ1 ≥ 0 is a parameter that controls the importance of the regularization term, and R(θ) is the elastic

in the regularization function; αi,j,τ , βi,j,τ , hi,j,τ are the entries of matrices Aτ , B τ , H τ , respectively.

3.3

Exploit sparsity and structure to solve large-scale optimization problems

Our model’s most salient feature is that we consider the underlying spatio-temporal structure between the
number of confirmed cases and deaths. If there is no specific structure in coefficient matrices, our methods
look on the surface to be a naive linear model but require to solve a large-scale high-dimensional optimization
problem, which contains 79,077,916 parameters (variables in the optimization problem) with only 84,888 data
points. Instead of solving such complex problems directly, we tackle this challenge by exploiting the sparse
spatial structure and only consider the correlation between adjacent counties and hubs, which leads to a
significant reduction in the number of parameters (less than 80,000). Besides, the lower triangular structure
of Λτ matrix (including B τ , H τ , and Aτ ) captures the causal relationship we believe exists in the confirmed
case to the death count, but not the other way around. To be exact, we assume the number of confirmed
cases in the past will result in the change of both the confirmed cases and deaths in the future, while the
number of deaths only relates to the future’s deaths.
The regularization term we devised in Section 3.2 also plays a big part in achieving the ideal results.
This elastic net-based method linearly combines the lasso and ridge regression penalties on B τ , H τ , and Aτ
to encourage sparse spatial correlation and stabilize the solution at the same time. The hyper-parameters
λ1 and λ2 in the regularization term are chosen by 5-fold cross-validation, where the optimal choices are
λ1 ≈ 102 and λ2 ≈ 10−1 for the fitted model.
Here we solve the optimization problem by gradient descent. To fit the model, we first standardize the
data of covariates and feed all the data as a single batch in one iteration, then descend the gradients of
the parameters with respect to the loss defined in (2) until the model converges. To perform a one-week
ahead prediction, we feed all the data before that week as a single batch in one iteration and follow the same
gradient descent procedure described above. The model normally takes about 500 iterations to reach the
convergence with `(θ) ≈ 1.41 × 103 .

Results

Now we report the results of our study. We evaluate the explanatory power of proposed modeling method by
performing the in-sample estimation. We also compare our approach regarding the one-week ahead predictive
performance against four other baseline methods, which have been adopted by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) in its national ensemble forecast [10, 48]. In addition, we demonstrate the interpretable
components of our model by showing the spatio-temporal correlation between the number of COVID-19 cases
and other covariates discovered from our fitted model. For the ease of presentation, we only focus on the
mainland and do not consider Hawaii, Alaska, and other unincorporated territories of the United States in
this paper. Hereinafter, we refer to the proposed spatio-temporal vector autoregressive model as STVA.

4.1

Model evaluation

To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we compare the county-level in-sample estimation on the number
of deaths. The in-sample estimation is a process of evaluating the model’s explanatory capabilities using
observed data to see how effective the model is in reproducing the data. The process can be carried out as
follows: We first fit the model using the entire data set from March 15th, 2020 to January 17th, 2021, which
contains 3,144 counties and 49 weeks in total. The in-sample estimation can then be obtained by feeding the
same data into the fitted model and recovering the estimation for deaths according to (1). We also carry out
three ablation studies to further investigate the effectiveness of each model component. To be specific, we
consider three new models by removing the component of mobility (STVA−mobility), demographic census
(STVA−census), and spatial correlation (STVA−spatial) in (1), respectively. We note that each county can
also be regarded as an independent auto-regressive (AR) model for the model without spatial correlation.
We report the in-sample estimation of the proposed approach and the ablation models by aggregating the
county-level estimated numbers in the same state. As shown in Fig. 4, we select eight major states with the
highest total number of deaths in the U.S. The shaded area indicates the actual number of deaths reported

Figure 4: In-sample estimated deaths (red dotted lines) for the U.S. and other eight major states with the
highest number of COVID-19 deaths in the U.S.. Figures are sorted in descending order of the total number
of deaths since March 15th, 2020. The results show that our model can capture the general dynamics of the
death numbers.

in the COVID-19 data set, and the solid red line indicates the in-sample estimated deaths by our model.
We observe that the STVA (solid red lines) can capture the dynamics of true death trajectories better than
the other three ablation models (dash lines). The result suggests that these components are conducive to
improving the model’s performance. In Appendix A, we also present the in-sample estimation of the confirmed
cases for the same eight states.
In addition to the in-sample estimation, we assess the model’s predictive power by performing the oneweek ahead (out-of-sample) prediction. The prediction procedure withholds the future data from the model
estimation, then uses the fitted model to make predictions for the (hold-out) data in the next week. Here, we
compare our model against four baselines adopted by the CDC: (1) COVID-19 Mortality Projections for
the U.S. States by the University of Texas, Austin (UT) [55]; (2) COVID-19 Cases and Deaths Forecasts by
the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) [39]; (3) COVID-19 Modeling by the Northeastern University,
Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio-technical Systems (MOBS) [43]; (4) COVID-19 Projections
for the United States by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) [27, 28]. We only present
the results from October 11th, 2020, for one-week ahead death prediction. The statistics before October are
inaccurate due to the low testing rate, and the data are insufficient to fit the model. Similar to the in-sample
estimation, we report the prediction results for the entire U.S. and eight top states with the highest number
of deaths in Fig. 5. It has shown that the aggregated county-level predictions suggested by the STVA (solid
green lines) achieve competitive performance against other mainstream approaches (dash lines). It is worth
noting that these four methods only provide state-level forecasting for the number of deaths, which is less
challenging than the county-level prediction.
More quantitative results are summarized in Fig. 6. The heatmaps show the mean absolute error (MAE)
of the county-level estimation/prediction within a particular state and at certain weeks. The average MAEs
over states and weeks are presented in the vertical line chart on the right and the horizontal line chart
on the top. The states are sorted in the ascending order of their MAE from top to bottom. As shown in
Fig. 6, our model significantly outperforms the other ablation models while achieving competitive predictive
performances compared to the other widely-adopted state-level approaches. We can also observe that: our
model tends to achieve better performance for the states with larger populations, such as Florida, New York,
Texas, et cetera; for the deaths, our model has a balanced performance in each state, and the MAE is getting
better (smaller) and becoming more stable after the summer surge of the COVID-19 (from June to July).

Figure 5: One-week ahead death prediction for the U.S. and other eight major states with the highest number
of COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. The STVA’s statewise predictions are obtained by aggregating the county-level
predictions in the same states. Figures are sorted in descending order of the total number of confirmed cases
since October 11th, 2020. The results show that our model can achieve promising predictive performance
with other four baselines. Note that these four baselines only provide state-level predictions.

Model interpretation

Our study focuses on exploring the in-sample explanatory content of predetermined factors in our model. We
fit the model using the entire data set collected from three data mentioned above sources in Section 2, and
interpret the model by examining its fitted coefficients.

Spatio-temporal dependencies between cases and deaths The experimental results demonstrate a
distinctive underlying spatio-temporal pattern between confirmed cases and deaths of the COVID-19. We
first report the coefficients of five representative hubs in Λ1 in Fig. 7. The hubs’ coefficients in B 1 , H 1 , A1
reveal their spatial dependencies between each pair of past cases and current cases, past cases and current
deaths, and past deaths and current deaths, respectively. As we can see, hubs have a strong “radiating”
power on most of the United States regions and contribute a great deal to promote or curb the spread of

the COVID-19. However, the rural area with lower population density in the Central United States is not
significantly influenced by the hubs. The hubs situated in the Northern United States (e.g., Chicago, New
York) are negatively related to the spreading diseases to the other regions (in blue), which appear to have
better controls on the expansion of the virus. In contrast, the hubs in the Southern United States (e.g.,
Dallas, Houston, Miami) usually are positively related to the increases of both cases and deaths in other
regions (in red). The result also presents some other interesting findings: some hubs show two opposite
influences on the cases and deaths in the same region. For example, we see that on the one hand, Fig. 7 (m)
shows that the number of deaths in Miami is negatively related to the deaths in the New England area of the
United States. On the other hand, Fig. 7 (n) shows that the number of cases in Miami is positively related to
the cases in the same area. Some hubs contribute to the increase of cases or deaths in one region, reducing
the cases or deaths in other regions. For example, Fig. 7 (g) and (j) show that Dallas and Houston have a
positive impact on the New England area in the United States and have a negative impact on Florida and
California. Apart from analyzing the spatial structure across regions learned by the model, we also study the
temporal dependences in the past two weeks for the same hub. In Fig. 8, we present three typical pairs of
comparisons for coefficients between one-week lag and two-week lag: coefficients of Atlanta in A1 and A2 ,
coefficients of Seattle in B 1 and B 2 , and coefficients of Los Angeles in H 1 and H 2 . All three comparisons
share one thing in common: coefficients of different time lag have a similar spatial pattern, but the overall
coefficients of two-week lag are relatively smaller than corresponding ones of one-week lag. This indicates
that the last week has a stronger influence. Last but not least, we further investigate the p-values of these
spatial coefficients, as finding statistically significant relationships between the prediction and the observation
is of great importance to the model evaluation. Since A1 plays a key role in predicting future deaths by
being connected to the death observations in the past, we take the hubs’ coefficients in A1 as an example. As
shown in Fig. 9, the number of deaths in these hubs is statistically significant to the death counts in other
populated regions in the U.S. (New England, the Southeastern United States, and the Western united states).
In particular, we find the hubs in the west and the north (Los Angeles, Washington D.C., New York, Seattle,
and San Francisco) are statistically significant to a broader area than the hubs in the South (Houston, Dallas,
and Miami).
Dependence on local covariates Table 2 summarizes the fitted coefficients of local covariates in the
model. The first and second rows indicate the corresponding time lag and the category of coefficients,
respectively. The first 12 columns correspond to the community mobility, and the last two columns correspond
to the demographic factors. Positive coefficients have been put in bold to highlight the positive correlation
with cases or deaths. The coefficients can be compared across factors as the covariates are standardized first.
As we can see, most of the covariates are statistically significant, with small p-values (< .05) except for the
proportion of the elderly population age 65 and older. The positive coefficients are in bold, which indicates a
positive correlation between the covariates and the cases or deaths. In particular, we observe that, for the
cases, the coefficients of mobility in workplaces, retail, and recreation, transit stations have large positive
values (> 9 × 102 ), which indicates that the increase of mobility in these areas led to the rapid spread of the
COVID-19. However, things are the opposite for the deaths, where the coefficients of mobility in grocery and
pharmacies, parks, residential have large positive values (> 2 × 102 ). Moreover, the population’s coefficient
for the cases is significantly larger than the other covariates, and it confirms that population density is the
dominant factor in spreading the disease. Last, we have found the proportion of the elderly population is
significantly related to the deaths and has no clear connection to the cases.

Discussion

While still in the development stages, the proposed spatio-temporal model has shown immense promise in
modeling and predicting the deaths and confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the United States. Nevertheless,
there remain numerous open questions and rooms for improvements. For example, the uncertainty in the
count data commonly exists and can affect accuracy. It would be interesting to incorporate the serology data
as an additional data source to calibrate our model. To avoid negative output, we may adapt the current
problem into a Poisson regression with the log-linear model or apply a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) to the
output to disallow the negative values. It assumes the response variable xt has a Poisson distribution and
assumes the logarithm of its expected value can be modeled by the linear model defined in (1). In particular,
this adaption plays a vital role in predicting states with fewer confirmed cases and deaths, such as Hawaii
and Delaware.
