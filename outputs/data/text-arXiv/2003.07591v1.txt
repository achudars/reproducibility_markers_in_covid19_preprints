Abstract
This paper investigates the effect of the novel coronavirus and crude oil prices on the United
States (US) economic policy uncertainty (EPU). Using daily data for the period January 21 –
March 13, 2020, our Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model shows that the new
infection cases reported at global level, and the death ratio, have no significant effect on the
US EPU, whereas the oil price negative dynamics leads to increased uncertainty. However,
analyzing the situation outside China, we discover that both new case announcements and the
COVID-19 associated death ratio have a positive influence on the US EPU.

The outbreak of the new coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis monopolizes these days the
worldwide public agendas. Originating in China (Hubei region), the COVID-19 affected over
the last two months over 100,000 people and more than 100 countries. The World Health
Organization (WHO), which daily monitors the COVID-19 figures since January 21, 2020,
declared the coronavirus a pandemic. Although the spread of the virus started to decline, after
the middle of February in China, the infection cases grew exponentially outside China. The
European countries, but also the United States (US), are now severely touched. On the on
hand, the COVID-19 triggers fear and anxiety in the society, nourished both by the daily
reported new infection cases and by the increasing fatality ratio. On the other hand, the virus
starts to affect the real economy, generating a crash on financial and commodity markets.
Likewise, COVID-19 induces additional uncertainty in the economy, amplified by a delayed
reaction of authorities, and by a lack of a clear strategy to fight against the disease.
This is also the case of the US authorities, which initially refused to take actions.
President Trump declared that the situation is “very much under control” in the US, and that
the scientists will find “soon” a solution to this problem. Nevertheless, the COVID-19
numbers triggered a strong reaction of US financial markets, first on February 28, 2020, and
second, on March 13, 2020, immediately after Mr. Trump declaration according to which the
coronavirus represents a “national emergency” issue. In addition, in the context of the
coronavirus crisis, the Saudi Arabia decided to flood the market with oil and the international
prices dropped over 20% on March 9, 2020. Against this background, we may ask if the
coronavirus crisis influences the policy-induced economic uncertainty in the US. We tempt to
respond to this question by analyzing the impact of new infection case announcements, and
COVID-19 death-associated ratio, on the US economic policy uncertainty (EPU). We use
daily data over the period January 21 – March 13, 2020, resorting to the WHO situation
reports. We also test the impact of crude oil prices on the US EPU. Given that the US is an
oil-dependent country, as one of the world largest producers, it is expected that a crash of
crude oil price will amplify the economic uncertainty.
The relationship between EPU and oil prices has already been investigated. Chen et al.
(2020) show that the impact of oil price shocks on EPU is positive at all frequencies, a result
in line with Kang et al. (2017), but contrasting that reported by Antonakakis et al. (2014). At
the same time, Ma et al. (2018) notice that EPU is important to forecast oil futures prices,
whereas Aloui et al. (2016) show that EPU influences the oil price returns only in certain
periods. Nevertheless, none of these studies focuses on the recent situation generated by the
2

COVID-19 crisis. Therefore, we fill in this gap and test the impact of coronavirus numbers
and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) prices on the US EPU (we use BRENT crude for
robustness purpose). As far as we know, this is the first paper addressing the impact of the
COVID-19 crisis on the US policy-induced economic uncertainty.
Only few works try to identify the causes underlying EPU (e.g. Chen et al., 2020; Duca
and Saving, 2018). Indeed, most of existing studies address the impact of EPU on economic
activity (Nyamela et al., 2019; Sahinoz and Cosar, 2018), financial volatility (Mei et al., 2018;
Tiwari et al., 2019), bank valuation (He and Niu, 2018) or firm performance (Iqbal et al.,
2019; Wu et al., 2020). Consequently, we add to the set of analyses investigating the drivers
of EPU, with a focus on the officially reported coronavirus numbers.

2. Data

The WHO data show that China still is, for the moment, the most affected country in the
world. However, the virus rapidly spreads in other countries like Italy, Spain, Iran or South
Korea. Therefore, we posit that the impact of COVID-19 on the US EPU will be more
important if the situation outside China degenerates. Figure 1 shows that the US EPU
increases exponentially and seems to be positively correlated with the COVID-19 numbers.

Figure 2 highlights that the death ratio has continuously increased, with a similar trend
as that of the EPU index.

Our daily data are extracted from the WHO situation reports and refer to the new
reported cases of infection and death ratio.1 The EPU statistics come from Baker et al.
(2016)2, whereas the WTI crude oil prices are obtained from the US Energy Information
Administration. All series are expressed in natural log.

3. Empirical investigation

3.1. Methodology
Given that our series are either I(0) and I(1) (Table 1), we use the ARDL model
proposed by Pesaran et al. (2001) to investigate the relationship between the retained
variables.

cases reported outside China, COVID-19TDR is the total death ratio, COVID-19DROC is the death ratio outside
China.

We therefore test the following specification that integrates the short-run adjustments
into the long-run equilibrium:

1

The WHO reports released at date “t” present data reported at “t-1”, which are not final data. However, given
the exponential increase of new infection cases, there is a delay of two days in the reporting activity. Therefore,
to account for this delay, and to consider EPU’s rapid reaction to coronavirus news, in our estimation we
investigate the impact of numbers reflected in WHO reports released at date “t+1” on the EPU at date “t”.

3.2. Results
We first validate the existence of the long-run relationship applying the bound test. For
all tested models, the bound analysis indicates the existence of cointegration (Table 2).

COVID-19NCOC shows the new cases reported outside China, COVID-19TDR is the total death ratio, COVID19DROC is the death ratio outside China.

In the second step (Table 3), we present the results of the ARDL estimations for the four
models we test, considering the total new infection cases (Model 1), the new cases reported
outside China (Model 2), the total death ratio (Model 3) and the death ratio outside China
(Model 4). The first model shows that at equilibrium (long run), the total new infection cases
have no effect on the US EPU, but a decrease of crude oil price leads to a higher uncertainty,
as expected. The short-run results show no impact of COVID-19 figures and WTI prices on
the US EPU. However, the situation is different for Model 2, where the new infection cases
reported outside China increase the uncertainty. At the same time, Model 4 shows that an
increase of 1% in the logarithmic level of the death ratio recorded outside China, leads to an
increase of 0.18% of the uncertainty index in the long run. This result remains robust when
we use the BRENT crude as a proxy for the international oil prices.3

4. Conclusion

The rapid propagation of COVID-19 pandemic generates shock waves on the financial
and commodity markets, as well as in the real economy. The depth of the new economic
downturn will depend on the policy response to the coronavirus crisis. This paper investigates
how COVID-19 official numbers (new infection cases and death ratio) affect the US EPU.
The findings show that the global COVID-19 numbers have no significant impact on the
US EPU. Nevertheless, these results are largely influence by the situation reported in China,
which seems to win the fight against the virus. When we assess the situation outside China,
we clearly notice a positive influence of COVID-19 numbers on the US EPU. We therefore
underline an amplification of COVID-19 risk to financial and real economy, generated by an
increased, policy-induced economic uncertainty in the US.
