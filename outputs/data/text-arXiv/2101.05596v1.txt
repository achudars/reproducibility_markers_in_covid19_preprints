Abstract
We propose a realistic model for the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic subject to the lockdown and quarantine measures, which takes into
account the time-delay for recovery or death processes. The dynamic
equations for the entire process are derived by adopting a kinetic-type
reactions approach. More specifically, the lockdown and the quarantine
measures are modelled by some kind of inhibitor reactions where susceptible and infected individuals can be trapped into inactive states. The
dynamics for the recovered people is obtained by accounting people who
are only traced back to hospitalised infected people. To get the evolution equation we take inspiration from the Michaelis- Menten’s enzymesubstrate reaction model (the so-called MM reaction) where the enzyme is
associated to the available hospital beds, the substrate to the infected people, and the product to the recovered people, respectively. In other words,
everything happens as if the hospitals beds act as a catalyzer in the hospital recovery process. Of course, in our case the reverse MM reactions
has no sense in our case and, consequently, the kinetic constant is equal
to zero. Finally, the O.D.E.s for people tested positive to COVID-19 is
simply modelled by the following kinetic scheme S + I ⇒ 2I with I ⇒ R
or I ⇒ D, with S, I, R, and D denoting the compartments Susceptible,
Infected, Recovered, and Deceased people, respectively. The resulting
kinetic-type equations provide the O.D.E.s, for elementary reaction steps,
describing the number of the infected people, the total number of the recovered people previously hospitalised, subject to the lockdown and the
quarantine measure, and the total number of deaths. The model foresees
also the second wave of Infection by Coronavirus. The tests carried out
on real data for Belgium, France and Germany confirmed the correctness
of our model.

Introduction

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a new Coronavirus (SARSCoV-2) that has spread rapidly around the world. Most infected people have
no symptoms or suffer from mild, flu-like symptoms, but some become seriously
ill and can die. In recent weeks coronavirus has had too many opportunities
to spread again. After successfully tamping down the first surge of infection
and death, Europe is now in the middle of a second coronavirus wave as it
moves into winter [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. Even though several vaccines for
COVID-19 are actually been produced other ways of slowing its spread have to
continue to be explored. One way of controlling the disease are the lockdown
and the quarantine measures. The lockdown measures are emergency measures
or conditions imposed by governmental authorities, as during the outbreak of
an epidemic disease, that intervene in situations where the risk of transmitting
the virus is greatest. Under these measures, people are required to stay in their
homes and to limit travel movements and opportunities for individuals to come
into contact with each other such as dining out or attending large gatherings.
The lockdown measures are more effective when combined with other measures
such as the quarantine. Quarantine means separating healthy people from other
healthy people, who may have the virus after being in close contact with an
infected person, or because they have returned from an area with high infection
rates. Similar recommendations include isolation (like quarantine, but for people
who tested positive for COVID-19) and physical distancing (people without
symptoms keep a distance from each other). Several governments have then
decided that stricter lockdown and quarantine measures are needed to bring
down the number of infections. In this work we shall propose interventions
which are as targeted as possible. Unfortunately, the greater the number of
infections, the more sweeping the measures have to be. Tightening the measures
will impact on our society and the economy but this step is needed for getting
the coronavirus under control.
The aim of this work is to model the dynamics of the infectious, recovered,
and deceased people when population is subject to lockdown and quarantine
measures imposed by governments. We shall see that the combined effect of
the restrictions measures with the action of the Hospitals and Health Institutes
is able to contain and even dampen the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
The dynamics of the entire process will be obtained by taking into account
the theoretical results recently appeared in literature [7] and [8] and by adopting a kinetic-type reactions approach. In this framework, the dynamics of the
Health Institutes is obtained by taking inspiration from the Michaelis- Menten’s
enzyme-substrate reaction model (the so-called MM reaction [9], [10], and [11])
where the enzyme is associated to the available hospital beds, the substrate to
the infected people, and the product to the recovered people, respectively. In
other words, everything happens as if the hospitals beds act as a catalyzer in

2

the hospital recovery process [12]. In addition, the time-delay for recovery or
death processes are duly taken into account. More specifically, in our model, we
have the following 10 compartments:
S = Number of susceptible people. This number concerns individuals not yet
infected with the disease at time t, but they are susceptible to the disease of the
population;
I = Number of people who have been infected and are capable of spreading the
disease to those in the susceptible category;
Ih = Number of hospitalised infected people;
IQ = Number of people in quarantine. This number concerns individuals who
may have the virus after being in close contact with an infected person;
R = Total number of recovered people, meaning specifically individuals having
survived the disease and now immune. Those in this category are not able to
be infected again or to transmit the infection to others;
rh = Total recovered people previously hospitalised;
D = Total number of people dead people for COVID-19;
dh = Total number of people previously hospitalised dead for COVID-19;
L = Number of inhibitor sites mimicking lockdown measures:
Q = Number of inhibitor sites mimicking quarantine measures.
In addition, N , defined in Eq. (19), denotes the number of total cases.
The manuscript is organised as follows. In Section 2 we derive the deterministic Ordinary Differential Equations (ODSs) governing the dynamics of the
infectious, recovered, and deceased people. The lockdown and quarantine measures are modelled in Subsection 2.2. The dynamics of the hospitalised individuals (i.e., the infectious, recovered, and deceased people) can be found in
Subsection 2.4. As mentioned above, the corresponding ODEs are obtained
by considering the MM reaction model. The equations governing the dynamics
of the full process and the related basic reproduction number are reported in
Section 3 and Section 4, respectively. It is worth mentioning that our model
foresees also the second wave of Infection by Coronavirus. As shown in Section 5, in absence of the restrictive measures and by neglecting the role of the
Hospitals and the delay in the reactions steps, our model reduces to the classical Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Deceased-Model (SIRD-model) [13]. Finally, Section 6 shows the good agreement between the theoretical predictions
with real data for Belgium, France and Germany. The last Section 7 presents
the conclusions and perspectives of this manuscript.

Model for COVID-19 in Presence of the Lockdown and Quarantine Measures

As mentioned in the Introduction, the population is assigned to compartments
with labels S, I, R D etc. The dynamics of these compartments is generally
governed by deterministic ODEs, even though stochastic differential equations
should be used to describe more realistic situations [7]. In this Section, we

3

shall derive the deterministic ordinary differential equations obeyed by compartments. This task will be carried out by taking into account the theoretical
results recently appeared in literature [8], [14] and without neglecting the delay
in the reactions steps.

2.1

Modelling the Susceptible People

If a susceptible person encounters an infected person, the susceptible person will
be infected as well. So, the scheme simply reads
µ

S+I −
→ 2I

Modelling the Lockdown and Quarantine Measures

The lockdown measures are mainly based on the isolation of the susceptible
people, (eventually with the removal of infected people by hospitalisation), but
above all on the removal of susceptible people.
Subsection 2.1. Modelling the Lockdown and Quarantine Measures
with Chemical Interpretation
It is assumed the lockdown and quarantine measures are modelled by some
kind of inhibitor reaction where the susceptible people and the infected can
be trapped into inactive states SL and IQ , respectively. Indicating with L and
Q the Inhibitor sites mimicking the lockdown and the quarantine measures
respectively, we get

I −−→ IQ ======⇒ R
In the scheme (2), symbol =⇒ stands for a delayed reaction just like enzyme
degradation processes for instance. Here, Lmax = SL + L hence, if L ' LM ax ,
an almost perfect lockdown measures would totally inhibit virus propagation by
inhibiting all the susceptible people S and the infected people I. A not so perfect
lockdown measures would leave a fraction of I free to spread the virus. The
number of inhibitor sites maybe a fraction of the number of the infected people.
Fig. 1. shows the behaviour of the lockdown efficiency parameter adopted in our
model. For simplicity, we have chosen a parameter which is constant kLM ax 6=
0 inside the time-interval t1 ≤ t ≤ t2 and vanishes outside it. The inverse
−1
Lockdown efficiency parameter is kL
= kLM ax − kL , which is equal to kLM ax
outside the door and vanishes inside the the interval t1 ≤ t ≤ t2 . Finally, from
Schemes (1) and (2), we get the O.D.E.s for S, L, Q, and IQ :
Ṡ = −µSI − kL S(LM ax − SL ) + (1 − kL )(LM ax − L)

the lockdown efficiency parameter kL is a door-step function. This function is

2.3

O.D.E. for the Total Recovered People

At the first approximation, the O.D.E. for the total recovered people R (i.e. the
total individuals having survived the disease) is trivially obtained by considering
the following kinetic scheme:
χ, tR

I ====⇒ R

(5)

kQR , tQR

IQ ======⇒ R
That is, the rate of Rt is approximatively proportional to the number of the
infected people I at time t i.e.1 .
Ṙ = χI(t−tR ) + χR(t−tR )

(6)

where we have introduced the time-delay tR (the number of the recovered people
at time time t is proportional to the infected people at time t − tR ). However, it
is useful to clarify the following. In Eqs (5), R stands for the total number of the
recovered people (i.e. the number of the recovered people previously hospitalised,
plus the number of the asymptomatic people, plus the infected people who have
been recovered without being previously hospitalised). The natural question is:
how can we count R and compare this variable with the real data ?. The current
statistics, produced by the Ministries of Health of various Countries, concern
the people released from the hospitals. Apart from Luxembourg (where the
entire population has been subject to the COVID-19-test), no other Countries
1 Notice that the first reaction in the scheme Eq. (5) is the dynamic equation for the total
recovered people adopted in the SIRD-model [13].

5

are in a condition to provide statistics regarding the total people recovered by
COVID-19. Hence, it is our opinion that the equation for R, is not useful since
it is practically impossible to compare R with the experimental data. We then
proceed by adopting approximations and to establish the differential equation
whose solution can realistically be subject to experimental verification. More
specifically:
Firstly, we assume that R is given by three contributions:
R = rh + rA + rI

(7)

with rh , rA , and rI denoting the total number of the recovered people previously
hospitalised, the total number of asymptomatic people, and the total number of
people immune to SARS-CoV-2, respectively.
Secondly, we assume that the two contributions rA and rI are negligible i.e. we
set rA ≈ 0 and rI ≈ 0 2 .

2.4

O.D.E. for the Recovered People in the Hospitals

Now, let us determine the dynamics for the recovered people in the hospitals.
So, we account people who are only traced back to hospitalised infected people.
We propose the following model3 :
kr , tr

k

1
I + bh −→
Ih ====⇒ rh + bh

(8)

kd , td

Ih ====⇒ dh + bh
with bh denoting the number of available hospital beds, I the number of infected
people, Ih the number of infected people blocking an hospital bed, rh the number
of recovered people previously hospitalised, and dh the number of people deceased
in the hospital. Of course,
Ih + bh = Ch = const.

where

Ch = Total hospital0 s capacity

(9)

The dynamic equations for the processes are then:
I˙h = k1 I(Ch − Ih ) − kr Ih(t−tr ) − kd Ih(t−td )

(10)

ṙh = kr Ih(t−tr )
d˙h = kd Ih(t−t )
d

where tr and td are the average recovery time delay and the average death time
delay, respectively, and we have taken into account Eq. (9) i.e., bh = Ch − Ih .
In general tr 6= td 6= 0. Of course, the variation of r(t) over a period ∆t is:
∆rht = rht − rh(t−∆t)
2 We

(11)

consider that the SARS-CoV-12 has just appeared for the first time. So, we do
not consider the asymptomatic people who are immune to the virus without any medical
treatment.
3 Our model is inspired by Michaelis-Menten’s enzyme-substrate reaction. Of course, the
reverse MM reaction has no sense in our case and, consequently, the kinetic constant is equal
to zero.

2.5

O.D.E. for People Tested Positive to COVID-19

The number of the infected people may be modelled by the following kinetic
scheme
µ

S+I −
→ 2I

(12)

χ, tR

I ====⇒ R
α, tD

I ====⇒ D
k

1
Ih
I + b −→

kQ

I −−→ IQ
The scheme (12) stems from the following considerations
a) If a susceptible person encounters an infected person, the susceptible person
will be infected ;
b) The infected people can either survive and, therefore, be recovered after an
average time-delay tR , or die after an average time-delay tD ;
c) The schemes (2) and (8), respectively, have been taken into account.
The differential equation for the infected people is reads then
I˙ = µSI − kQ IQ − k1 I(Ch − Ih ) − χI(t−tR ) − αI(t−tD )

2.6

(13)

O.D.E. for Deaths

In this model, we assume that the rate of death is proportional to the infected people, according to the scheme (12). By also taking into account the
scheme (2), we get
α, tD
I ====⇒ D
(14)
and the corresponding O.D.E. for deaths reads
Ḋ = αI(t−tD )

Set of O.D.E.s for the Spread of SARS-CoV-2
when the Lockdown and the Quarantine Measures are Adopted

By collecting the above O.D.E.s, we get the full system of differential equations
governing the dynamics of the number of the infected people, the total number

Ṙ = χI(t−tR ) + χIQ (t−tR )
d˙h = kd Ih(t−td )
Ḋ = αI(t−tD )
From Eqs (16) we get
S + SL + I + IQ + Ih + R + rh + D + dh = const.

(17)

or, by taking into account that S + SL = ST ot. , R + rh = RT ot. , D + dh = DT ot. ,
and I + IQ + Ih = IT ot. we get
ST ot. + IT ot. + RT ot. + DT ot. = const.

(18)

The number of total cases N is defined as
N = IT ot. + rh + DT ot.

(19)

The Basic Reproduction Number

We note that, in absence of the lockdown and the quarantine measures, the
dynamics of the infectious class depends on the following ratio:
R0 =

S
µ
χ + α NT ot.

(20)

with NT ot. denoting the Total Population. R0 is the basic reproduction number.
This parameter provides the expected number of new infections from a single
infection in a population by assuming that all subjects are susceptible [2], [3].
The epidemic only starts if R0 is greater than 1, otherwise the spread of the
disease stops right from the start.

Comparison with the SIRD model

The Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Deceased-Model (SIRD-model) is one of
the simplest compartmental models, and many models may be derived from
8

this basic form. According to the SIRD model, the dynamic equations governing the above compartments read [13]
Ṡ = −µSI
I˙ = µSI − χI − αI

(21)

Ṙ = χI
Ḋ = αI
It is easily checked that Eqs (16) reduce to Eqs (21) by adopting some assumptions. In particular:
1) The system is not subject to the lockdown and quarantine measures;
2) The average times-delay may be neglected;
3) Hospitals do not enter in the dynamics.
Under these assumptions, Eqs (16) reduce to the SIRD equations:
Ṡ ' −µSI
I˙ ' µSI − χI − αI

(22)

Ṙ = χI
Ḋ = αI

Application of the Model and Appearance of
the Second Wave of SARS-CoV-2 Infection

Let us now apply our model to the case of a small Country, Belgium, and to other
two big Countries, France and Germany. Real data are provided by the various
National Health agencies (Belgium - Sciensano [15]; France - Santé Publique
France [16]; Germany -Robert Koch Institut. Country data from Worldbank.org
[17]) and compiled, among others, by European Centre for Disease Prevention
and Control (ECDC). It should be noted that this measures does not generally
provide the true new cases rate but reflect the overall trend since most of the
infected will not be tested [18]. It should also be specified that real data provided by ECDC refer to the new cases per day, which we denote by ∆Inew (t).
By definition, ∆Inew (t) corresponds to the new infected people generated from
µ
step I + S −
→ 2I solely during 1 day, and not to the compartment I. Hence,
the ECDC data have to be confronted vs the theoretical predictions provided
by the solutions for S(t) and SL (t) of our model, according to the relation
∆Inew (t) = −∆S(t) − ∆SL (t). The values of the parameters used to perform
these comparisons are shown in Table 1. Initial µ en k1 values have been estimated (fitted) from the measurements using the short period at the start of the
pandemic using simple solution valid during that period. I(60) (from March
1, 2020). Hospital capacity is evaluated from the different Countries published
capacity. However, we are aware that the interpretation may vary from one
Country to another. During the first lockdown, Countries have taken various

actions to limit Coronavirus spreading (social distancing, wearing masks, reducing high density hotspots etc.). In order to include these measures in a simple
way, we assumed that the net effect is to reduce the actual infection kinetic
rate µ by some constant factor. This is given in the table as µ after L1 . Note
that the transition occurs instantaneously in our model hence the sharp drop
in the total infected at that time. Other parameters are tuned to account for
the actual variability of ∆Inew (but not its absolute value) and official number
of deaths (D(t) + d(t)). The delay for recovery or death processes has been
estimated from the measurements of hospitalisation recovery in a Country. For
instance, Fig. 2 shows the estimation of the recovery time-delay for Belgium:
it corresponds to the time-interval between the peak of the new admission and
the peak of the recovered people from hospitals. Such a procedure has been
adopted for estimating the recovery and death time-delays also for France and
Germany.

Conclusions and Perspecives

We showed that our model is able to produce predictions not only on the first
but also on the second or even the third waves of SARS-CoV2 infections. The
theoretical predictions are in line with the official number of cases with minimal
parameter fitting. We discussed the strengths and limitations of the proposed
model regarding the long-term predictions and, above all, the duration of how
long the lockdown and the quarantine measures should be taken in force in order
to limit as much as possible the intensities of subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection
waves. This task has been carried out by taking into account the theoretical
results recently appeared in literature [7] and without neglecting the delay in
the reactions steps. Our model has been applied in two different situations: the
spreading of the Coronavirus in a small Country (Belgium) and in big Countries
(France and Germany).
It is worth noting the degree of the flexibility of our model. For example, let us
suppose that we need to set up a model able to distinguish old population (over

65 year old) from the young one (with age not exceeding 35 years), by assuming
that the older population is twice as likely to get infected by Coronavirus with
respect to the younger one. In this case, it is just sufficient to replace the scheme
µ
I +S −
→ 2I with the scheme
µy

I + SY −−→ 2I

(23)

µo

I + 2SO −→ 3I
S = SY + SO
with SY and So denoting the susceptible young people and the susceptible old
people, respectively. Another example could be the following. Let us suppose
that we need to distinguish two class of infected individuals:
1) infected people (denoted by I1 ) able to transmit the Coronavirus to susceptible according to the (standard) scheme I1 + S → 2I;
2) Infected people (denoted by I2 ) having the capacity to transmit the virus, say,
7 times higher with respect to the category 1). In this case, the corresponding
scheme reads:
µ1

I1 + S −→ 2I

(24)

µ2

I2 + 7S −→ 8I
I = I1 + I2
It is then easy to write the ordinary differential equations associated to schemes
(23) and (24).
Let us now consider another aspect of the model. In the Subsection (2.2), we
have introduced scheme (2) that models the lockdown measures. As mentioned,

such measures are imposed by national governments to all susceptible population. However, we can also take into consideration the hypothesis that these
measures are not rigorously respected by the population and this for various
reasons: neglect of the problem, depression due to prolonged isolation, lack of
confidence in the measures adopted by the Government, desire to attend parties
with friends and relatives, etc. Scheme (2) still adapts to describe these kind
of situations with the trick of replacing Fig. 1 with a curve that models the
emotional behaviour of susceptible people. The O.D.E.s read
Ṡ = −µSI − kE S(EM ax − SE ) + (1 − kE )(EM ax − E)
ṠE = kE SE −

where E stands for Emotional.
Finally, we mention that in ref. [14] we have incorporated real data into a
stochastic model. The goal is to obtain a comparative analysis against the
deterministic one, in order to use the new theoretical results to predict the
number of new cases of infected people and to propose possible changes to the
measures of isolation.
