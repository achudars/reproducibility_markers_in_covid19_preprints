Abstract
The ongoing Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a major crisis that has significantly affected the healthcare
sector and global economies, which made it the main subject of various fields in scientific and technical research.
To properly understand and control this new epidemic, mathematical modelling is presented as a very effective tool
that can illustrate the mechanisms of its propagation. In this regard, the use of compartmental models is the most
prominent approach adopted in the literature to describe the dynamics of COVID-19. Along the same line, we aim
during this study to generalize and ameliorate many existing works that consecrated to analyse the behaviour of
this epidemic. Precisely, we propose an SQEAIHR (Susceptible-Quarantined-Exposed-Asymptomatically infectiveInfected-Hospitalized-Recovered) epidemic system for Coronavirus. Our constructed model is enriched by taking into
account the media intervention and vital dynamics. By the use of the next-generation matrix method, the theoretical
basic reproductive number R0 is obtained for COVID-19. Based on some nonstandard and generalized analytical
techniques, the local and global stability of the disease-free equilibrium are proven when R0 < 1. Moreover, in the
case of R0 > 1, the uniform persistence of COVID-19 model is also shown. In order to better adapt our epidemic
model to reality, the randomness factor is taken into account by considering a proportional white noises, which leads
to a well-posed stochastic model. Under appropriate conditions, interesting asymptotic properties are proved, namely:
extinction and persistence in the mean. The theoretical results show that the dynamics of the perturbed COVID-19
model are determined by parameters that are closely related to the magnitude of the stochastic noise. Finally, we
present some numerical illustrations to confirm our theoretical results and to show the impact of media intervention
and quarantine strategies.

1. Introduction and model formulation
The control of human and animal epidemics is principally based on modeling and simulation as the main decisionmaking tools [1, 2]. Anyhow, each epidemic is distinguished by its own biological characteristics, which impose the
adaptation of the dynamical models describing their propagation mechanisms to any specific case, and this in order
to deal with real situations [3, 4, 5]. Presently, the whole world is under a tremendous threat due to the Coronavirus
disease, which is a highly contagious virus that first appeared in China at the end of 2019, and spread rapidly to
cover almost the entire globe [6]. Several researchers have discovered that this infectious disease, commonly called
COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV, is caused by a new generation of beta-coronavirus [7], which affects the lungs and leads

to the severe acute respiratory syndrome, the reason why the World Health Organization (WHO) renamed it SARSCoV-2 [8]. Because of the exponential increase in cases and victims that it caused, the Coronavirus was declared
to be an international public health emergency [9]. However, the danger did not stop at all, and the disease area
carried on expanding to cover more than a hundred countries in March 2020, until the WHO had considered it as a
pandemic in April of the same year when the statistics revealed that the number of infected populations and deaths
surpassed respectively 800, 000 and 40, 000 [10]. Despite the existence of many suggested COVID-19 vaccines for
which some national authorities have already permited the emergency use [11], none is proven to be completly safe yet.
According to the WHO, these vaccines are not rigoursly tested and still in the phase of large clinical trial (see [12, 13]).
The absence of an WHO-officially authorized or recommended treatment [13] remains a genuine challenge for all the
governments, especially with the significant and noticeable repercussions that this epidemic presents in the economic
and health realms. In the case of this new virus, the majority of transmissions is occurred by respiratory droplets that
may be inhaled from close contact with an infected person when he exhales, sneezes or coughs [14]. Moreover, these
droplets fall quickly on the floors and surfaces which makes them also a possible source of infection. Currently, the
adoption of suitable strategies to tackle Coronavirus transportation presents big defiance for all the decision-makers
around the world, and to overcome it, a good understanding of the pandemic evolution dynamics is really required.
Developing an appropriate mathematical model is a prominent method to purvey essential instructions and guidelines measures for disease mitigation. In this context, compartmental systems, like the simple SIR or the more advanced
ones such as SIRS, SEIRS, SEIRQ and others, (see [15, 2]) can be an inspiring choice to deal with the critical situation
that we are going through now. Since its discovery, a lot of models have been suggested for the study of COVID-19
dynamics [16, 17, 18]. Some works like [19], suggested a classical SIR system for predicting and analysing the novel
Coronavirus, other ones such as [20, 21] used a modified version of this system for the purpose of being more adapted to
the dynamics transmission of SARS-CoV-2. With regards to this new virus characteristics, the last mentioned model
was expanded to an SEIR one by taking into consideration a latency period during which the infected individuals
are not infectious yet. Yang and Wang [22] used exactly this extended model to describe COVID-19 dissemination
in Wuhan, China. They considered various transmission ways and incorporated the importance of the environmental
reservoir. In the same context, Kucharski et al. [16] adopted an SEIR model to study the transmission variation
of COVID-19 at the beginning of 2020. For a more rigorous vision of deaths number evolution, the authors in [23]
developed a new form of the SEIR model by adding a deceased individuals class denoted (D). They utilized a fractionalorder formulation SEIRD and arrived to the fact that this latter is more suitable than the classical one introduced in
[24], and has less root mean square deviation. Inspired by the studies presented in [25, 26] and [27], Ivorra et al. [10]
treated a fractional SEIHRD model to give successful forecasts about future variation in cases and deaths statistics,
bearing in mind the existence of undetected infectious individuals. They proposed a new strategy that considers a
proportion of the detected cases over total infected ones and exhibited the impact of this percentage, usually denoted
θ, on the spread level of COVID-19. We mention that there is many interesting works related to the estimations
of θ for the Coronavirus (see, e.g., [28, 29]). By considering the isolation strategy which played a significant role in
controlling many diseases, Pal et al [30] proposed an SEQIR system to describe the outbreak of the Coronavirus. They
determined the basic reproduction number R0 in terms of system parameters, and on the basis of its expression, they
analysed the stability dynamics of their model. In the same regard, Hu et al. [31] showed the effect of the strategy
stated above on the COVID-19 evolution by using an SEIRQ compartmental system that takes into account the input
population. They discussed different scenarios of the epidemic spread on Guangdong province by using the officially
published data. In order to be well adapted to the prevalence mechanisms of the current epidemic, Jia et al [32] suggested a new mathematical model that counts on the isolation and treatment besides home quarantine as prominent
strategies to reduce the contagion intensity, without neglecting the existence of an asymptomatic transmission. In the
case of COVID-19, it is important to point out that there seems to be a myriad of asymptomatic infected individuals
[33] with a significant case fatality ratio, but it stills noticeably lower than MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV [34]. They also
effectuated the parameters estimation building on officially published data and the well known Least-Squares approach
before passing to calculate the control reproduction number Rc for most Chinese provinces. It should be noted that
2

the aforementioned study supposed the existence of meteorological factors effects on the virus activity, justifying this
by the high level of genetic similarity between the current SARS-COV-2 and SARS-COV, and the role of temperature
elevation in the disappear of this latter in 2003 [35]. In spite of its formulation complexity, the previously mentioned
model has a realistic hypothetical framework, which made it a perfect basis for many interesting contributions [36, 37].
Along the same line, in this work, we will propose and analyze a generalized form of the model presented in [32].
Our new version will comprise two main extra hypotheses: the demographic variations and media intervention. The
first addition’s objective is to enhance this model and make it able to describe the behaviour of the current pandemic
over a long period of time by including natural birth and general mortality rates. For the second one, we consider
the role of the various awareness campaigns and daily reports announced by different mass communication outlets
like radio, television, newspaper, internet etc. In order to formulate the model mathematically under the previous
assumptions, we consider a host population denoted at time t by N (t) which is partitioned into seven classes of
susceptible, quarantined, exposed, infectious with symptoms, asymptomatically infected, hospitalized and recovered
individuals, with densities respectively denoted by S(t), Q(t), E(t), A(t), I(t), D(t) and R(t). The overall interactions
between these classes are described through the system of deterministic ordinary differential equations below:

In this system, it was assumed that exposed individuals E(t) are not infectious, and being in reality low-level virus
carriers [10] explains the adoption of this assumption. Due to the exerted efforts by local authorities, like the closure
of educational institutions, traffic control, travel restrictions, extension of vacations and postponing the return to
work, we accept in (1.1) that there is no contact chance between home quarantined individuals Q(t) and infectious
population. For the hospitalized people H(t), we suppose that they are isolated and in treatment process. Based
on the studies presented in [38, 39, 40], it is admitted in (1.1) that there is no vertical transmission from mother to
foetus, also, we presume that the total lockdown policy is applied. So, the recruitment rate Λ of uninfected population
corresponds only to natural births. In addition, and similarly to [37, 41], a media-induced incidence function is used
to depict the disease infection mechanism in our system. We take first β1 as the usual contact rate before media

transmission rate (see [42] for more details). It should be clarified that media coverage is able to reduce the intensity of
the disease propagation, but cannot completely prevent it, therefore, we assume that β1 > β2 > 0. Logically speaking,
symptomatic infected individuals should have a greater contagion rate than asymptomatic ones, and this is the clue
why we have denoted the ration between these two rates as θ ∈ (0, 1). Regarding the home confined population, we
have used parameters p and λ in reference respectively to the quarantined and release rates. The constant σ in (1.1)
is actually the passage rate from exposed individuals class to infected compartments A and I, but with a probability
p ∈ (0, 1) of becoming symptomatic and 1 − p for being asymptomatic. The parameters εA and εI stand respectively
3

for the hospitalization rates of asymptomatic and symptomatic infective, whereas γA ,γI and γD are the recovery rates
of classes A, I, D. Moreover, the constants µ, dA , dI and dH are representing, in this order, the natural death rate
of the whole population and the disease-induced death rates affecting only from classes D, A and I. Based on the
abovementioned modelling assumptions, the proposed system is illustrated by the following schematic flow diagram:

Generally speaking, the deterministic formulations analysis is very necessary and commonly used in the mathematical epidemiology, and it can be seen as a first tool for modelling new diseases spread and getting an overview
of their asymptotic behaviour. However, the real phenomena are not always deterministic and may be subject to
some uncertainties and randomness due to fluctuations in the natural environment [43, 44, 45]. Therefore, an adapted
version that considers this stochasticity is requisite in the case of COVID-19. For this purpose, and like several works
[46, 47, 41], we extend the system (1.1) to the following probabilistic version that incorporates proportional Gaussian
white noises:

Here and subsequently, σi (i = 1, · · · , 7) are denoting the positive intensities of the mutually independent Brownian
motions Bi (i = 1, · · · , 7). These latter, and all the random variables that we will meet in this paper, are presumed to
be defined on a complete probability space (Ω, F, P) with a filtration (Ft )t>0 , that satisfies the usual conditions, i.e.,
it is increasing and right continuous while F0 contains all P−null sets.
The primary purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of COVID-19 dynamics and examine its various
properties over a relatively long period. Indeed, we have taken the necessary time to observe the disease evolution in
various countries and to compare its behaviour with the theoretical epidemic models presented in the literature, which
permitted us later to propose a system that appears suitable and very adapted to the evolution of this new disease.
Since the asymptotic analysis of epidemic models provides an excellent insight into the future pandemic situation, we
decide in this study to treat it for our suggested system of COVID-19 on both deterministic and probabilistic levels.

In the deterministic framework, we highlight several methods which make it possible to obtain, and under certain
conditions, of course, the local and global stability of the disease-free equilibrium as well as the uniform persistence of
the epidemic, without resorting to Lyapunov theory [48]. For the perturbed version of our model, we check in detail
its well-posedness. Furthermore, we study the extinction case and present by using some new techniques a sufficient
condition for the persistence of Coronavirus.
The rest of this manuscript is arranged as follows: in Section 2, we demonstrate that the deterministic system
(1.1) has a unique global positive solution. Next, we show the existence and uniqueness of disease-free and endemic
equilibria of this system. Moreover, we investigate besides the local and global stability of disease-free equilibrium
(DFE) the uniform persistence of the epidemic. In Section 3, we will first prove the existence and uniqueness of
the positive solution of the stochastic system (1.2). Then, we show the extinction and persistence in the mean of
COVID-19 under some conditions. In Section 4, we perform our work with some examples of numerical simulations to
illustrate our theoretical results and the effect of control strategies (coverage media and quarantine). Finally, results
are discussed in Section 5.
2. Analysis of the deterministic Coronavirus model
This section is devoted to the study of the deterministic COVID-19 model presented by the aforementioned differential system (1.1), but before starting our analysis, we will first associate to (1.1) the following initial-value problem:

2.1. Well-posedness
In this subsection, we will show that the Coronavirus model presented by system (1.1) is well posed, in the sense
that if S0 , Q0 , E0 , A0 , I0 , H0 and R0 are positive, then the initial-value problem, or the Cauchy problem [49], (2.1)
admits one and only one solution which is global in time, positive, and bounded.
Theorem 2.1. If the initial value x0 is in the positive orthant R7+ , then there exists a unique solution
system (2.1). Moreover, this solution remains bounded and positive for all t > 0.

x(t) to the

Proof. First of all, it is obvious that F is a locally Lipschitz continuous function on the open connected domain
R7+ . Therefore, the famous Picard-Lindlöf theorem [50], called also the Cauchy-Lipschitz theorem [51], guarantees the

5

existence of a unique maximal solution to the initial-value problem (2.1). This solution is defined on an interval [0, τe ),

where τe is the explosion time [52]. Moreover, it can be easily seen from (1.1) that for all S, Q, E, A, I, H, R ∈ R7+ ,

So, by using Proposition 4.1 of [53], it follows immediately that R7+ is positively invariant for the dynamical system
(1.1), which means that any solution trajectory starting from the cone R7+ will still inside it for all the future time

t ∈ [0, τe ). On the other hand, for any initial value S0 , Q0 , E0 , A0 , I0 , H0 , R0 ∈ R7+ , the total population N (t) satisfies
the following equality for all t ∈ [0, τe ),
dN (t)

Therefore, the solution of system (2.1) is bounded on [0, τe ). In addition, this last fact together with Proposition A.1
of [55] lead to the globality in time of our solution. Thus, the initial-value problem (2.1) is well posed as required. 
Remark 2.1. In addition to its interesting mathematical interpretation, the importance of the preceding theorem lies
essentially in the fact that it makes our model logical, realistic and biologically meaningful.
2.2. Invariant, absorbing and attracting regions
In the theory of ordinary differential equations, the first step after proving the well-posedness of a dynamical system
is to get a first glimpse of its asymptotic behaviour’s nature. For example, to know if its trajectories are bounded on a
neighbourhood of infinity or not. For that, we will present in this subsection some special regions of R7+ to which the
solutions of (1.1) are belongs always, converge, or at least remain close as t → ∞. This situation is often described in
terms of invariant, absorbing and attracting subsets which will be defined in the following.
Definition 2.1 (Invariant region [56, 57]). A set ∆ ⊂ R7 is said to be an invariant region for (1.1), or more precisely
a positively invariant region with respect to (1.1), if x(0) ∈ ∆ implies x(t) ∈ ∆ for all t > 0. That is, whenever x0 is
in ∆, the solution x(t) of (1.1) which starts from x0 remains in ∆ for all future time.
Remark 2.2. It is fairly easy to see from Theorem 2.1 that R7+ is a positively invariant set for (1.1) in the sense of
the previous definition.
Definition 2.2 (Absorbing region [58]). We say that a region ∆ ⊂ R7+ is absorbing for (1.1) if there is an open set
U ⊂ R7+ containing it such that x(0) ∈ U implies the existence of some T > 0 for which x(t) ∈ ∆ whenever t > T. In
other words, any solution of (1.1) that starts from U, will necessarily enter and stay in ∆ after a certain time. In the
particular case of U = R7+ , the set ∆ is called globally absorbent for (1.1).
6

Remark 2.3. The existence of a bounded absorbing set is considered as a specific and interesting property of the
system, and generally this property is called dissipativity [58].
Definition 2.3 (Attracting region [58, 48]). A set ∆ ⊂ R7+ is called an attracting region for the system (1.1) if there
exists an open set U ⊂ R7+ containing it such that
lim dist (x(t, x0 ),∆) = 0 for all

t→∞

x0 ∈ U.

Here, x(t, x0 ) denotes the solution of (1.1) that satisfies the initial condition x(0) = x0 and dist (p,B) is the distance
from a point p ∈ R7 to a subset B ⊂ R7 , that is, the smallest distance from p to any point in B. More explicitly,
dist (p,B) := inf kx − pk.
x∈B

If U = R7+ , the region ∆ will be said to be globally attracting for (1.1).
Remark 2.4. Clearly, an absorbent set is always attracting, but the converse is generally false (see [58]).
After having defined the notions of invariant, absorbing and attracting sets, we will turn now to the main results of
this subsection. But before doing so, let us first introduce these notations which will be used from now on to simplify

which is equivalent to saying that Dη′ is positively invariant with respect to (1.1).

3. The invariance of region Dηη′ = Dη′ ∩ Dη with respect to system (1.1) follows immediately from the fact that the
intersection of two positively invariant sets is also a positively invariant set (see Proposition 2.31, [53]).

Thus, the vector field on each boundary point of the region S is pointing toward its interior, and this prevents
any solution that starts in S from leaving it (see [57]). Therefore, S is an invariant region for (1.1).

Hence, the proof is completed.

Remark 2.5. The method used to prove the last point of Theorem 2.2 is known as the Bony-Brezis theorem, and for
more details on this, we refer the reader to [59].
From now on, we will keep the notations of Theorem 2.2.
Theorem 2.3. For any positive numbers η and η ′ , the set Dηη′ is globally absorbent with respect to the system (1.1).
Proof. Let η, η ′ > 0 be two positive numbers, and let x0 ∈ R7+ . Based on (2.3) and (2.8), we observe that for all t > 0

Therefore, Dηη′ is a globally absorbent region for (1.1).



Remark 2.6. Needless to say, the last theorem implies that the system (1.1) is dissipative. Moreover Dη′ , Dη , or
generally any region containing Dηη′ , is also going to be globally absorbent for (1.1).
Now, let us mention an important consequence of the previous theorem.

Proof. The attraction property of the set D00 with respect to (1.1) comes easily from the following observation:
\
D00 =

η>0

and the fact that the region
is globally absorbent with respect to (1.1) for any positive number η (see Theorem 2.3
′
in the particular case η = η ). The last passage can be explained by saying that reducing the η value, and bringing it
close to zero leaves no choice for the solutions trajectories except converging to D00 , which is the desired conclusion. 

2.3. The Basic reproduction number R0
Epidemiologically, the basic reproduction ratio R0 is the number of secondary cases produced by one infected
individual in an entirely susceptible population during its period as an infective. In the literature, several techniques
have been proposed for the calculation of R0 [60, chapter 5], but the most known is that of the next generation
approach introduced by van den Driessche and Watmough in [61]. According to this method, which will be used
in our case, R0 is the spectral radius ρ of the next generation matrix defined by M = F V −1 , where V and F are
respectively the matrices expressing the infections transition and the emergence of new infected cases in the different
contaminated compartments of the model. By observing our system (1.1), we can easily notice that it has two
essential and particular properties. The first is the fact that it admits one, and only one, disease-free equilibrium
(DFE) E o = (S o , Qo , 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), where S o and Qo are defined by (2.6). The second is the possibility of rearranging
its equations and rewriting it in the modified form

2.4. Stability analysis of the disease-free steady state E o

In this subsection, we will deal with the issue of disease-free equilibrium stability in its local and global levels, and
we will show the effect of R0 value on each of them, but before doing so, let us first present these needed notations
and terminologies to follow this part without ambiguity.
• In is the identity matrix of order n.

• The real part of a complex number z ∈ C is written as Re(z).

• The set of eigenvalues of a square matrix A, is denoted by the symbol Σ(A).

• For a square matrix with complex entries M , the greatest real part of eigenvalues is called the spectral bound,
or the stability modulus, of M (see [62]) and we write it as α (M ) , max Re(ω).
ω∈Σ(M)

• Finally, we remind that ρ(M ) refers to the maximum modulus of a square matrix M eigenvalues, that is,
ρ(M ) , max |ω|.
ω∈Σ(M)

2.4.1. Local stability of the disease-free steady state E o

Theorem 2.4. Under the condition R0 < 1, the disease-free equilibrium of the system (1.1) is locally asymptotically
stable, but it becomes unstable if R0 > 1.
Proof. To show the local stability of E o = (S o , Qo , 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) for system (1.1), we will go through that of Eeo =

0, 0, 0, S o, Qo , 0, 0 for system (2.10) because, as we have already mentioned in the previous subsection, (2.10) is just
a slightly modified version of (1.1) obtained by an arrangement of its lines. Obviously, the Jacobian matrix of system
(2.10) at Eeo is given by the following block representation:

−W3
−W4

So, and with the help of Theorem 5.2.10 of [63], one can easily conclude that the eigenvalues of DFe(Eeo ) are exactly
the combined characteristic roots of F − V and −W4 . In other terms,


Σ DFe (Eeo ) = Σ(F − V ) ∪ Σ(−W4 ),
(2.15)

with Σ is referring to the spectrum (i.e., the set of eigenvalues). By the same argument, we can draw the following
equality for the matrix −W4 :
Σ(−W4 ) = Σ(−w1 ) ∪ Σ(−w4 ),
10

which together with (2.15) implies that


Σ DFe(Eeo ) = Σ(F − V ) ∪ Σ(−w1 ) ∪ Σ(−w4 ).

Then



α DFe (Eeo ) = α(F − V ) ∨ α(−w1 ) ∨ α(−w4 ),

where
−w1 =

and − w4 =

The matrix −w4 is upper triangular, then its eigenvalues are exactly the diagonal entries, and since they are all
negative in this case we get
α(−w4 ) < 0.
(2.17)
On the other hand, it is easy to check that the characteristic polynomial of −w1 is
P (w) = det (−w1 − wI2 ) = w2 + (q + 2µ + λ) w + µ(µ + λ + q) .

So, and by observing the positivity of a1 and a2 , we can immediately conclude that
α(−w1 ) < 0.

(2.18)

According to Lemma 1 of [61], V is a non-singular M-matrix (a real matrix with nonpositive off-diagonal entries and
positive spectral bound [64]), and since F is nonnegative (i.e., all of whose entries are nonnegative), we can deduce by
using Varga’s theorem [65, 62, 66] that
α (F − V ) < 0 ⇐⇒ ρ(F V −1 ) < 1.
Combining (2.16), (2.17) and (2.18) with (2.19) gives the following equivalence:


R0 < 1 ⇐⇒ α DFe (Eeo ) < 0,

(2.19)

(2.20)

which leads us thanks to the famous Lyapunov’s linearisation theorem [48, page 139], to the fact that R0 < 1 implies
the local asymptotic stability of the disease-free equilibrium.
Now, the only remaining point is to check the instability of the DFE when R0 > 1. This time, the task is somewhat
easy, especially when we use the second version of Varga’s theorem [60, 1] which asserts that
α (F − V ) > 0 ⇐⇒ ρ(F V −1 ) > 1.

(2.21)

The last equivalence together with (2.16) and the Lyapunov’s linearisation theorem allows us to say that the DFE is
unstable if R0 > 1. Hence, the theorem is proved.

Remark 2.7. The adopted method in the previous proof is a little different from what we usually see in the literature,
since it shows the local stability of the disease-free state without using the Routh-Hurwitz criterion (see[60, page 101])
to the characteristic polynomial χ(w) = det (DF (E o ) − wI7 ), and this enabled us to sidestep lengthy and laborious
calculations.
Remark 2.8. The fact that R0 < 1 implies the local asymptotic stability of the disease-free equilibrium, is wrong in
general, and to obtain it we should ensure in addition the stability condition of the matrix −W4 (i.e., α (−W4 ) < 0).
This condition was formulated implicitly in [61] by the assumption (A5), and it plays an important role in the completion
of the proof concerning the DFE local asymptotic stability. But despite this, we note that there is not any reason to
use it in the demonstration of instability in the case of R0 > 1.

2.4.2. Global stability of the disease-free steady state E o

In the following, we seek to proof the global asymptotic stability of E 0 on the biologically feasible region S (see
Theorem 2.2) by applying an approach adapted from [67]. But before this, let us first follow the notation of [1] and
write system (2.10) in the form:

asymptotically stable on M, which proves the lemma.

Remark 2.9. Clearly, if we take M = R7+ , the condition (a) in the last lemma becomes unnecessary because R7+ is
already positively invariant, and in this case, we recover exactly the statement of Theorem 9.2 of [1], which allows us
to say that Lemma 2.1 is a generalization of this theorem.
12

Remark 2.10. According to the previously mentioned Varga’s theorem see (2.19) , the stability of the matrix M :=


F −V i.e., α(F −V ) < 0 is equivalent to R0 := ρ(F V −1 ) < 1, so the last assumption of Theorem 9.2 in [1] R0 < 1
is redundant and can therefore be dropped.
Theorem 2.5. If R0 < 1, then the disease-free equilibrium E o is globally asymptotically stable on S.
Proof. To demonstrate this theorem, we will use Lemma 2.1, in other words, we are going to show the global stability
of E o by proving that all the conditions (a),(b),(c) and (d) are satisfied. As supposed in the statement of the theorem,
let R0 < 1. From the equations of (1.1), we observe that the disease-free system is expressed by

Obviously, (2.23) is a linear differential system with α(−W4 ) < 0 (see the proof of Theorem 2.4), so the fixed point Eeo
is a globally asymptotic stable equilibrium of (2.23) [48, Theorem 4.5]. Thus, the condition (b) is satisfied. On the

other hand, for any x ∈ S = (S, Q, E, A, I, H, R) ∈ R7+ | S 6 S o and Q 6 Qo , we have

According to Theorem 2.2, the set S is an invariant region for (1.1). Therefore, (a) is satisfied and the conclusion of

the theorem follows immediately from Lemma 2.1.
2.5. Existence of endemic equilibrium and uniform persistence
The endemic equilibria of the proposed COVID-19 model are obtained by solving the system F (x) = 0 on
the positive orthant R7+ , where F is the vector-valued function given by (2.2). In other words, a point E ⋆ =

S ⋆ , Q⋆ , E ⋆ , A⋆ , I ⋆ , H ⋆ , R⋆ is an endemic equilibrium of (1.1) if and only if all its components are strictly greater

If R0 > 1, then C < 0, and since A > 0, the equation (2.24) admits a unique strictly positive solution. Therefore (1.1)
admits in turn a unique endemic equilibrium. On the other hand, when R0 6 1, we get A > 0,B > 0 and C > 0, so
the equation (2.24) does not have any endemic equilibrium in this case, which implies the non-existence of an endemic
equilibrium for (2.24).
Hence, we can summarize the above discussions in the following theorem.
Theorem 2.6. The system (1.1) has a unique endemic equilibrium in the case of R0 > 1, but when R0 6 1 such an
equilibrium can never exist.
After having studied the existence of the endemic equilibrium, we will now explore the uniform persistence of
system (1.1).
Definition 2.4 (Uniform persistence [69]). Let ∆ ⊂ R7+ . We say that the system (1.1) is uniformly persistent in ∆ if

there is a positive constant ̺ > 0 such that for any initial value S0 , Q0 , E0 , A0 , I0 , H0 , R0 ∈ ∆, the solution of (1.1)
starting from this value satisfies
lim inf S(t) > ̺,

lim inf Q(t) > ̺,

lim inf E(t) > ̺,

lim inf A(t) > ̺,

lim inf I(t) > ̺,

lim inf H(t) > ̺,

t→∞

Theorem 2.7. If R0 > 1, then the system (1.1) is uniformly persistent in S.
Proof. As assumed in the statement of the theorem, let R0 > 1. Plainly, the disease-free equilibrium E o is on the
boundary of R7+ , and as already mentioned in Theorem 2.4, this equilibrium is unstable when R0 > 1. Combining
this fact with the dissipativity of system (1.1) (Theorem 2.3) leads directly by virtue of Theorem 4.3 in [70] to the
uniform persistence of this system, which is the desired conclusion.

This result is interpreted by saying that when the basic reproductive number R0 is strictly greater than one, then
all the individuals appearing in (1.1) and especially the infected ones, will stay above a certain positive threshold,
which means that the Coronavirus disease will persist in the population in this case.
3. Analysis of the stochastic Coronavirus model
The intent of this section is to deal with the perturbed version of the COVID-19 model expressed by the stochastic
differential system (1.2). For simplicity of notation, we write from now on the initial-value problem associated with
(1.2) in the following form:

3.1. Existence and uniqueness of the global positive solution
To explore the dynamical properties of a population system, the first concern is to know if it admits a solution,
and if this solution is unique, positive and global (in time). In what follows, we will give some conditions under which

these four points above existence, uniqueness, positivity and globality , are verified for the system (1.2).

Theorem 3.1. For any initial value X0 ∈ R7+ , there is a unique solution X(t) to the system (3.1) on t > 0, and it

will remain in R7+ with probability one, which means that, if S(0), Q(0), E(0), A(0), I(0), H(0), R(0) is in R7+ , then

S(t), Q(t), E(t), A(t), I(t), H(t), R(t) ∈ R7+ for all t > 0 almost surely (a.s. for short).

Proof. In the system (3.1), the coefficients F and G are continuously differentiables on their domains of definition,
so they satisfy the local Lipschitz condition, and for this reason, there exists for any given initial value X0 ∈ R7+ , a
unique maximal local solution X(t) on t ∈ [0, τe ) , where τe is the explosion time [71]. At this point, our goal will be
to demonstrate that this solution is global, that is τe = ∞ a.s.
To this purpose, let k0 ∈ N be very large such that X(0) ∈ [k0−1 , k0 ], and define for each integer k > k0 the stopping
time τk as follows:

k>k0

is a stopping time, then so is τ∞ .
By adopting the convention inf ∅ = ∞ for the rest of this paper, we can easily affirm that τ∞ 6 τe a.s., and this
because
- if for all k > k0

t ∈ [0, τe ) | X(t) 6∈

6= ∅,

then obviously τk 6 τe for each k > k0 , which implies that lim τk = τ∞ 6 τe .

(



, k1
t ∈ [0, τe ) | X(t) 6∈
k1

(3.3)

then τk1 = ∞, and as (τk )k>k0 is increasing, we get τk = ∞ for all k > k1 , which yields τ∞ = ∞. At the
7

same time, it follows from (3.3) that the solution X(t) is bounded and belongs to k11 , k1 for every t ∈ [0, τe ),
namely
7

1
, k1 a.s., for all t ∈ [0, τe ) .
(3.4)
X(t) ∈
k1
Therefore, τe = ∞ and so τ∞ 6 τe .

Hence, τe = ∞ a.s. will follow directly if we show that τ∞ = ∞ a.s., and that is exactly what we are going to do to
finish the proof.
Assume that τ∞ = ∞ a.s. is untrue, then there exists a positive constant T such that P (τ∞ 6 T ) > 0.
Therefore, there exists an ǫ > 0 for which
P (τk 6 T ) > ǫ for all k > k0 .

3.2. Stochastically ultimate boundedness and permanence
After having demonstrated the positivity and the globality of our system’s solution, it is now time to discuss in
more detail how it behaves in the positive cone R7+ . In the following, we are going to define the notions of stochastically
ultimate boundedness and permanence, and we will subsequently show that the solution of system (1.2) verifies these
properties.
Definition 3.1 (Stochastically ultimate boundedness [73]). We say that the system (1.2) is stochastically ultimately
bounded, or ultimately bounded in probability (see [71, page 395]), if to every ε > 0, there corresponds a δε > 0 such
that
lim sup P (kX (t, X0 )k > δε ) 6 ε for every X0 ∈ R7+ ,
t→∞

where X (t, X0 ) here denotes the solution of (3.1) which satisfies the initial condition X(0) = X0 .
Remark 3.1. Other authors, as in [74, 75], and [76] adopt a different definition for this last notion (Stochastically
ultimate boundedness), according to which the system (3.1) is stochastically bounded in probability, if for any ε ∈ (0, 1)
there is some δε > 0 for which the following inequality:
lim sup P (kX (t, X0 )k 6 δε ) > 1 − ε

(3.9)

t→∞

is satisfied for any initial value X0 ∈ R7+ .We mention that the inequality (3.9) can equivalently be rewritten as:
lim inf P (kX (t, X0 )k > δε ) 6 ε,
t→∞

and this allows us to say that if our system is stochastically ultimate bounded in the sense of Definition 3.1, then it
will also be so in the sense of (3.9).
Definition 3.2 (Stochastic persistence [77]). Let X (t, X0 ) be the solution of (1.2) that verifies X(0) = X0 , we say
that the system (1.2) is stochastically persistent, if for each ε > 0, there exists a positive constant ηε > 0 such that the
following property is satisfied:
lim inf P (kX (t, X0 )k > ηε ) > 1 − ε, for all X0 ∈ R7+ .
t→∞

17

Definition 3.3 (Stochastic permanence [47]). The system (3.1) is called stochastically permanent, if it is both stochastically ultimate bounded and persistent.
Theorem 3.2. The system (1.2) is stochastically ultimate bounded, and even stochastically permanent.
Proof. Let X0 ∈ R7+ , by summing up the seven equations in (3.1) and denoting N = S + Q + E + A + I + H + R, we
obtain for all t > 0
dN (t) = (Λ − µN (t) − dA A(t) − dI I(t) − dH H(t)) dt + σ1 S(t) dB1 (t) + σ2 Q(t) dB2 (t) + σ3 E(t) dB3 (t)

3.3. Stochastic extinction of COVD-19
In epidemiology, we are usually concerned about two things, the first, is to know when the disease will die out, and
the second, is when it well persist. In this subsection, we will try our best to find a condition for the extinction of the
disease expressed in terms of system parameters and intensities of noises, and for the persistence, it will be dealt with
in the next subsection.
Definition 3.4 (Stochastic extinction [47]). For system (1.2), the infected individuals E(t), A(t) and I(t) are said to
be stochastically extinct, or extinctive, if lim E(t) + I(t) + A(t) = 0 almost surely.
t→∞

Before stating the result to be proved, we must firstly give the following useful lemma that was stated and proved
as Lemma 3.1 in [45].
Lemma 3.1. For any initial value X0 ∈ R7+ , the solution X(t) = (S(t), Q(t), E(t), A(t), I(t), H(t), R(t)) of system
(3.1) verifies the following properties:
Xk (t)
(a) lim
= 0 a.s. ∀k ∈ {1, 2, · · · , 7} .
t→∞

(b) Moreover, if µ > 12 σ12 ∨ σ22 ∨ σ32 ∨ σ42 ∨ σ52 ∨ σ62 ∨ σ72 , then
Rt
Xk (s) dBk (s)
lim 0
= 0 a.s. ∀k ∈ {1, 2, · · · , 7} .

Proof. The proof of this lemma is similar in spirit to that of lemmas 2.1 and 2.2 of [79] and therefore it is omitted
here.


Theorem 3.3. Let us denote by X(t) = S(t), Q(t), E(t), A(t), I(t), H(t), R(t) the solution of system (1.2) that starts

from a given value X0 = S(0), Q(0), E(0), A(0), I(0), H(0), R(0) ∈ R7+ .

Remark 3.2. Unlike Theorem 4.1 of [46], the above proof uses just the second assertion of Lemma 3.1, and makes
no appeal to the first one.
Remark 3.3. Needless to say, the preceding theorem implies the stochastic extinction of infected individuals, which
implies in turn (by the positivity of the solution) that lim E(t) = 0, lim A(t) = 0 and lim I(t) = 0 a.s. (see for example
t→∞

t→∞

t→∞

[81, 82] and [83, page 5071]).
Corollary 3.1. Under the same notations and hypotheses as in Theorem 3.3, we have

t→∞

lim hQ(t)i = Qo a.s.,

t→∞

lim hR(t)i = 0 a.s.,

and

lim hH(t)i = 0 a.s.

The same reasoning remains valid for the two last assertions of our theorem hR(t)i, hH(t)i −→ 0 a.s. , and this


Remark 3.4. Obviously, if we keep the same notations and assumptions as in Theorem 3.3, the last result can be
rewritten as follows:
lim hX(t)i = Eo a.s.,
t→∞

which implies by Cesàro’s theorem [84, page 3], that if the solution X(t) has a limit (finite or infinite) as t approaches
infinity, almost everywhere (a.e.for brevity), then necessarily this limit will be equal to Eo .
22

3.4. Persistence in the mean of COVID-19
In the following, we give a condition for the persistence in the mean of the disease, but before stating the main
result, we shall first recall the concept of persistence in the mean.
Definition 3.5 (Persistence in the mean [82, 85]). For system (1.2), the infectious individuals A(t) and I(t) are said
to be strongly persistent in the mean, or just persistent in the mean, if lim inf hA(t) + I(t)i > 0 almost surely.
t→∞

Remark 3.5. In the last definition, some authors use the word "Permanent" instead of "Persistent" [86], but others
prefer to avoid this terminology so as not to confuse the notion of Persistence in the mean, with that of stochastic
permanence which is completely different (see Definition 3.3).
For brevity and simplicity in writing the next results, it will be convenient to adopt the following notations:
p

p
p
• ρ1 (α) = 3 × 3 Λ (β1 − β2 ) σ × 3 θ(1 − p) × α + 3 p × (1 − α) , ∀α ∈ (0, 1),
• ρ2 = 7µ + σ + (εA + γA + dA ) + (εI + γI + dI ) + (dH + γH ) + |λ − q| +

Lemma 3.2. For any α ∈ (0, 1), the following inequality is satisfied
ρ1 (α) 6 ρ1 (b
α).

(3.23)

In other terms, ρ1 (b
α) is the maximum value of ρ1 (α) on the open interval (0, 1).
Proof. We start our proof by observing that the function ρ1 (α) is differentiable on (0, 1), with a first derivative given
by:

As it can be seen, the derivative ρ′1 (α) and the linear function L(α) = α
b − α have the same sign, so the function ρ1 (α)
decreases for α ∈ (0, α
b) and increases for α ∈ (b
α, 1). Therefore, the highest value of ρ1 in the interval (0, 1) is ρ1 (b
α),
and this is precisely the assertion of the lemma.


Theorem 3.4. If ρ1 (b
α) > ρ2 , then for any X0 ∈R7+ , the solution X(t)= S(t), Q(t), E(t), A(t), I(t), H(t), R(t) of the
initial-value problem (3.1) verifies the following property:
lim inf hI(t) + A(t)i >

(ρ1 (b

Remark 3.6. In the last proof, we can notice that any constant α ∈ (0, 1) can play the role of α
b, but the peculiarity
of the latter lies essentially in its capacity to weaken the hypothesis of Theorem 3.4. Indeed, according to Lemma 3.2,
if ρ1 (α) > ρ2 for some α ∈ (0, 1) then necessarily ρ1 (b
α) > ρ2 .
4. Numerical simulation examples
In this section, and using the parameter values as shown in Table 1, we present some numerical simulations to
validate the various results proved in this paper. Most of the parametric values appearing in this table (Table 1) are
selected from real data available in existing literature ([32, 88, 36, 89] more precisely) and the rest of them are just
assumed for numerical calculations. The solution of our COVID-19 model, in its both stochastic and deterministic
forms, is simulated in our case with the initial state given by S(0) = 1.8 × 106 , Q(0) = 0, E(0) = 10, A(0) =
15, I(0) = 8, H(0) = 5 and R(0) = 0 (see [88]). In what follows, the unity of time is one day and the number of
individuals is expressed in one million population.

Example 4.1 (Deterministic case). In this case, and adopting the parameter values listed in Table 1, we will
illustrate the theoretical results of the first section. Figures 2 and 3 present the dynamical behaviour of the COVID19 deterministic model when β1 , β2 and p are conveniently fixed in their admissible ranges. In Figure 2, we take
β1 = 3.97 × 10−6 , β2 = 0.6×β1, p = 0.6201, and we get R0 = 0.9180 < 1. From the curves appearing in this figure,

it is clear that the disease is dying out, and in addition to that, the solution S(t), Q(t), E(t), A(t), I(t), H(t), R(t)

converges to the free-disease state E o = 1.5563 × 105 , 2.0896 × 105 , 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 which supports the Theorem 2.5.
On the other hand, and changing β1 to 5 × 10−6 , we obtain a basic reproductive number R0 greater than one
(R0 = 1.1562 > 1). From Figure 3, we observe the COVID-19 persistence in this case, which agree well with Theorem
2.7.

Example 4.2 (Stochastic case). In order to exhibit the random fluctuations effect on COVID-19 dynamics, we
present in Figures 4 and 5 a collection of numerical simulations. In the first instance, we take β1 = 2.08 × 10−9 ,
β2 = 0.6×β1, p = 0.6201, and we choose the stochastic intensities as follows: σ1 = 0.024, σ2 = 0.0235, σ3 = 0.015,
σ4 = 0.0174, σ5 = 0.019, σ6 = 0.0213, and σ7 = 0.0238. Then,

1 2
σ1 ∨ σ22 ∨ σ32 ∨ σ42 ∨ σ52 ∨ σ62 ∨ σ72 = 0.000288 < 0.000290 = µ,
2

and

σ32 ∧ σ42 ∧ σ52 = 0.000225 > 0.000202 = 6 (β1 S o − µ) .
Hence, the assumptions of Theorem 3.3 are verified, and consequently
lim sup
t→∞

σ 2 ∧ σ42 ∧ σ52
ln(E(t) + A(t) + I(t))

That is to say that the COVID-19 dies out exponentially almost surely. Moreover, by Corollary 3.1 and Remark 3.4,
the mean time of the solution converges to the deterministic free-disease equilibrium E o . These two last results are
α) > ρ2 true, we take β1 = 4.1 × 10−3 ,
confirmed by the curves depicted in Figure 4. To make the condition ρ1 (b
β2 = 0.1 × β1 and we select new values of stochastic intensities as follows: σ1 = 0.019, σ2 = 0.0185, σ3 = 0.014,
σ4 = 0.017, σ5 = 0.0158, σ6 = 0.0136, and σ7 = 0.0182. Thus, the main result of Theorem 3.4 is satisfied and this
time, the COVID-19 persists in the mean as shown in Figure 5.

Example 4.3 (The effectiveness of media intervention and quarantine strategies). We aim during this
example to examine numerically the impact of media intrusion and quarantine strategies on the COVID-19 spread.
To this end, we simulate the progression of the total infected population number with various values of β2 , λ and
q. Through Figure 6, we can perceive that the increase of the quarantine rate and duration can delay the arrival
of infection peak, reduce remarkably the impact of the disease, and even lead it to the extinction sometimes (see
for example the last two curves presented in Figure 6). On the other hand, and as it can be seen from figures 7
and 8, the media alert strategy is able also to diminish the severity of the COVID-19 spread, but it can not make it
disappear, and we explain this theoretically by the absence of the parameters β2 and b in the persistence and extinction
conditions (for example R0 does not involve these parameters). Roughly speaking, the role of the quarantine and the
information intervention about COVID-19 is critically important, particularly in its beginnings. The growth of the
positive response in susceptible individuals leads to reduce the gravity of the infection and creates a conscious public
able to overcome this new pandemic by respecting social distancing and self-isolation procedures.

5. Conclusion and discussion
The current Coronavirus disease is a major danger that threatens the whole world, and in this context, mathematical
modelling is a very powerful tool for knowing more about how such a virus is transmitted within a host population of
humans. In this regard, an SQEAIHR epidemic model that describe the COVID-19 dynamics under the application
of quarantine and coverage media strategies is proposed on both deterministic and stochastic forms in this work.
Moreover, a rigorous mathematical analysis of this model is performed to get an overview of COVID-19 dissemination
behaviour. The principal epidemiological and mathematical findings of our study are presented as follows:
• For the deterministic version of COVID-19 model, the basic reproduction number R0 is calculated by using the
next-generation matrix approach and based on its expression, we have determined many dynamical properties
of this version. More precisely, when R0 < 1, the COVID-19-free steady point E o is the unique equilibrium
of system (1.1), and it is globally asymptotically stable in this case. On the other side, when R0 > 1, the
disease-free equilibrium E o is still present but it becomes unstable, and another endemic one E ⋆ appears this
time, which makes our system (1.1) uniformly persistent according to Theorem 2.7.
• For the stochastic version of COVID-19 model, we have demonstrated the existence and uniqueness of a global
positive solution, and besides this, we have established that this latter is stochastically ultimately bounded, in
other words, the probability of this solution exploding in the infinite time is very low (see Theorem 3.2). During
our exploration of the perturbed system (1.2), we have derived the conditions for COVID-19 extinction and
persistence, and we remarked that they are mainly depending on the magnitude of the noises intensities as well
as the system parameters.
Compared to the existing literature, the novelty of our work lies in new analysis techniques and improvements which
are summarized in the following items:
• Our article sheds some new light on the next-generation matrix method and applies the Varga’s theorem [65, 62,
66] to show the local stability of the disease-free state without making recourse to the Routh-Hurwitz criterion,
which enabled us to avoid many long calculations.
• By eliminating a hypothetical redundancy and bringing into play the notion of the positively invariant set, our
work provides an improved and generalized version of Theorem 9.2 in [1], and use it to establish the global
stability of the disease-free equilibrium E o .
• For the case of the stochastic COVID-19 model (1.2), in Lemma 3.2 and Theorem 3.4, we showed that the
following inequality:
ρ1 (b
α ) > ρ2 ,
is a sufficient condition for the non-disappearance of COVID-19 infective individuals.
In order to support the theoretical results and clarify the role of quarantine and awareness strategies towards the
COVID-19 spreading behaviour, we have presented some numerical simulation examples. From the curves appearing
in these simulations, and more precisely those where we have gradually varied the value of β2 , λ and q, we noticed
that the quarantine and awareness strategies can effectively lower the infection and reduce the sizes of infected species.
Despite its remarkable efficiency, the coverage media alone is unfortunately unable to prevent the COVID-19 from
persisting. This last fact can be clearly remarked and confirmed for the deterministic case by observing that R0
does not contain any media coverage parameter. So, in short, we conclude that the first thing that must be done in
the future during confronting a new and rapidly spreading disease like COVID-19 is to adopt quarantine and media
intervention strategies, pending the emergence of an appropriate and safe treatment.
We believe that our article can be a rich basis for future studies especially after the recent discovery of a new and
stronger variant of COVID-19, named COVID-19-VUI–202012/01, in the United Kingdom [90].
