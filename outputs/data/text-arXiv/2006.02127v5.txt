ABSTRACT

KEYWORDS

Accurate forecasts for COVID-19 are necessary for better preparedness and resource management. Specifically, deciding the response
over months or several months requires accurate long-term forecasts which is particularly challenging as the model errors accumulate with time. A critical factor that can hinder accurate longterm forecasts, is the number of unreported/asymptomatic cases.
While there have been early serology tests to estimate this number, more tests need to be conducted for more reliable results. To
identify the number of unreported/asymptomatic cases, we take
an epidemiology data-driven approach. We show that we can identify lower bounds on this ratio or upper bound on actual cases
as a factor of reported cases. To do so, we propose an extension
of our prior heterogeneous infection rate model, incorporating
unreported/asymptomatic cases. We prove that the number of unreported cases can be reliably estimated only from a certain time
period of the epidemic data. In doing so, we construct an algorithm
called Fixed Infection Rate method, which identifies a reliable bound
on the learned ratio. We also propose two heuristics to learn this
ratio and show their effectiveness on simulated data. We use our
approaches to identify the upper bounds on the ratio of actual to
reported cases for New York City and several US states. Our results
demonstrate with high confidence that the actual number of cases
cannot be more than 35 times in New York, 40 times in Illinois,
38 times in Massachusetts and 29 times in New Jersey, than the
reported cases.

INTRODUCTION

During the current COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have attempted
to estimate the number of cases that are not being reported using
antibody tests [5]. This number is useful as it dictates the number of susceptible individuals, which in turn affects the long-term
dynamics of the epidemic.
We take a data-driven approach to model the existence of unreported cases in terms of probability of a case being reported. Due
to a long period of social distancing, the infection dynamics are
‘stable’,i.e, the parameters that drive the number of cases can be
assumed to be constant over the period. This is unlike the earlier
phase when the world had just started taking precautions during
which a single model with fixed parameters would not have been
able to explain the trends. Using the data from this “stable” phase
(see Figure 1) of social distancing phase and before the precautions
are reduced, we may be able to observe the effect of unreported
cases. We demonstrate that the probability of reporting can be reliably obtained only from certain parts of the time-series. This in
turn provides an estimated upper bound on the number of total
actual cases as a factor of number of reported cases. Particularly, we
prove that the probability of reporting has a negligible effect on the
trend of reported cases in the initial part of the epidemic. Therefore,

during that period, we cannot reliably learn the reporting probability. On the other hand, we also prove that learned probability is not
reliable using only the later phase of the epidemic. Thus, there is a
certain time interval over which the learned bound on reporting
probability is reliable. We leverage the fact that reporting probability has negligible effect on the initial part of the timeseries and
significant impact in the later part to construct an algorithm termed
Fixed Infection Rate method. Our method can guarantee that the
obtained upper bound is close to the true upper-bound. We also propose two heuristics that attempt to learn this upper-bound without
any guarantee. While we can also attempt to identify this bound
without relying on a ‘stable’ phase using adaptive models [12], it
will introduce more hyperparameters making our estimation less
reliable.
We are learning a lower bound on reporting probability (and
correspondingly, upper bound on the actual cases) because we can
only measure the combined effect of probability of reporting and
complete isolation (see Section 3.1). This complete isolation is different from reducing social interactions. Reduced social interactions
reduces the probability of a randomly selected infected person affecting a randomly selected susceptible person. On the other hand,
complete isolation implies that a part of the population is removed
and does not participate in the epidemic, effectively reducing the
population by a constant factor. Since this factor is not known, we
can only obtain a lower bound on reporting probability or an upper
bound on the total cases as a factor of reported cases.
We proceed with an extension of the model proposed in [12]
which has been shown to perform accurate forecasts. We have
previously used a preliminary version of this model in the DARPA
Chikungunya forecasting challenge [3], where we were one of
the winners [2]. However, our approach for identifying the right
data to reliably learn reporting probability may be applicable to
other epidemiological models as well. Our contributions are the
following:

in New York, 40 times in Illinois, 38 times in Massachusetts
and 29 times in New Jersey, than the reported cases.

2 RELATED WORK
2.1 Modeling Unreported Cases
Several works in the literature [8–10] have attempted to model
unreported cases by adding states such as asymptomatic and unreported to the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model [6]. Magal
and Webb [10] propose a methodology for SIR model, that can determine the probability of reporting. This approach assumes that
the ‘turning point’, i.e., the time at which the number of new cases
peaks, is known. Ducrot et. al. [8] propose a method for identification of unreported cases from reported cases when the model
parameters satisfy certain properties in an extension of SIR model.
Liu et. al. [9] use a similar model but do not discuss the learnability
of parameters related to asymptomatic and unreported cases.

2.2

The SI-kJα Model

In [12], we proposed the SI-kJα model for the spread of a virus like
COVID-19 across the world which captures (i) temporally varying infection rates (ii) arbitrary regions, and (iii) human mobility
patterns. Within every region (hospital/city/state/country), an individual can exist in either one of two states: susceptible and infected.
A susceptible individual gets infected when in contact with an
infected individual at a rate depending on when that individual
got infected, i.e., rate of infection is β 1 for an individual infected
between t − 1 and t − J , β 2 for an individual infected between t − J
and t − 2J , and so on, thus resulting in k sub-states of infection. J is
a hyperparameters introduced for a smoothing effect to deal with
noisy data. It also avoids overfitting the model by using a small
k to capture dependency on the last k J days. The hypothesis is
that how actively one passes on the infection is affected by when
they get infected. We assume that after being infected for a certain
time, individuals no longer spread the infection, i.e., ∃k, such that
βi = 0∀i > k.
Also, people traveling from other regions can increase the number of infections in a given region. We assume that this infection
can happen because of human mobility. Suppose F (q, p) represents
mobility from region q to region p. Our model is represented by the
following system of equations.

• We propose an extension of our prior heterogeneous infection rate model that incorporates unreported/asymptomatic
cases in the form of a parameter that measures the ratio of
reported cases to actual number of cases.
• We prove that a bound on number of unreported cases can
be reliably estimated only from certain data.
• We propose Fixed Infection Rate Learning, an algorithm
that leverages the effect of data on the model parameters to
reliably identify a lower bound on reporting probability (and
correspondingly, upper bound on actual cases as a factor of
reported cases).
• We also propose two heuristics – Non-linear Incremental
Learning and Non-linear Curve Fitting, that attempt to learn
a lower bound on reporting probability, but do not provide
reliability guarantees.
• On simulated data, we show that our proposed method and
proposed heuristics are accurately able to retrieve the ratio
of reported to actual cases.
• We use our approaches to identify the lower bounds on the
ratio of reported to actual cases for New York City and several
US states.Our results demonstrate with high confidence that
the actual number of cases are cannot be more than 35 times

this reduces to Susceptible-Infected (SI) model [13]. On the other

cases, and knowing γ̄ is enough. However, this applies only when
the infection dynamics are not changing. In the future, as the social distancing policies are relaxed, ρ is expected to change and
approach 1, while γ may remain constant assuming enough testing
availability. Therefore, we wish to learn γ but at this point, we can
only identify γ̄ which forms a lower bound for γ .

MODELING UNREPORTED CASES

While unreported cases are not observed in the data, they affect
the long term dynamics by infecting other individuals and by also
reducing the number of susceptible individuals.
The individuals who are never accounted for in the reporting
(in the past or the future) can be classified into two categories: (i)
unreported cases - those who get infected over the course of the
epidemic but do not report it; and (ii) immune/isolated cases - those
who have the antibodies without being infected during the epidemic
or those who are completely isolated and have 0 probability of
getting infected. For unreported cases, we can add another state
to our model: An individual in the i t h “infected” sub-state will
p
be reported with probability γi . Thus, the total number of new

reported cases is given by ∆R t = ki=1 γi (It −(i−1)J − It −i J ). Then

Sensitivity of ∆R with respect to γ is

the parameters will be learned by fitting the reported cases
The immune/isolated cases can be modeled as considering them notsusceptible, and hence not involved in the epidemic. This effectively
reduces the size of the population considered for epidemic modeling.
Suppose, ρ p is the probability of a randomly selected individual in
region p to be immune/isolated. Then the number of susceptible

individuals at time t is given by S t = (1−ρ p )N p −It , and (1−ρ p )N p
represents the reduced size of the population.

Model Simplifications for Social Distancing

In the period of social distancing, we assume that majority of the
spread is “community spread” and infections due to travel across
the regions (state/counties) can be ignored. For ease of notation,
we drop the superscript p. For simplicity, we assume that γi = γ , ∀i.
Further, we redefine It to be the cumulative cases that could have
been reported at time t and R t to be the cases actually reported. This
allows us to ignore explicit modeling of reporting delays. Therefore,
we have
∆R t = γ

which is close to 1, when R t ≪ N . Figure 3 demonstrates this
fact. We simulate an epidemic with β = [0.4 0.2], N = 1, 000, 000
and γ̄ = γ = 1/10. We then attempt to “forecast” assuming the
knowledge of β, and various values of γ̄ = γ = 1, 1/10 and 1/20.
Observe that in the initial phase of the epidemic (Figure 2a) all
three trends are similar until they get close to the peak. Starting at
the peak (Figure 2b) and after the peak (Figure 2c), with the same
initial values and β, significantly different forecasts are obtained
by varying γ . By setting k = 1 in Equation 7, the following can be
easily proved.

In the initial phase of the epidemic, RNt −1 ≈ 0. Therefore, Equation 5
suggests that the number of reported cases is not sensitive to γ̄ in
the initial phase of the epidemic, when RNt −1 ≈ 0. On the other hand,
Equation 6 suggests that number of new reported cases is sensitive
to β.
Suppose, γ̄ ∗ is the true value and we train by ignoring the parameter, effectively setting it to 1 to obtain β 0 . Then, we get the
same timeseries, if ∀t,

Parameter Learnability

Proof. From Equation 7, easy to see that β 0 ≤ β ∗ . Setting ϵ =

R f (1−γ̄ ∗ )
γ̄ (N −R f )

completes the proof.

□

Theorem 3.1 suggests that early part of the epidemic is not reliable for learning γ̄ . However, this does not imply that we should
always prefer a high value of t in the following where we explore
the effect of the “tail" part of the epidemic on the learnability of γ̄ .

(4)

Equation 4 implies that only using the reported cases, the impact
of γ and δ cannot be separately measured. Setting γ̄ = γ (1 − ρ) ≤ γ ,
we can identify a lower bound on γ . Note that γ and ρ are not
separately needed to be able to forecast the number of reported

Lemma 3.2. There exists τ such that γ̄ that describes the data for
R t > Rτ is not unique.

Using β ∗ ≥ β 0 in the numerator and β 0 ≥ (1 − ϵ)β ∗ in the

Proof. We prove this by showing that there is a tu such that for
t > tu , there are at least two sets of parameter (β 1 , γ̄ 1 ) and (β 2 , γ̄ 2 )
that fit the data for t > tu , i.e., the following has a feasible solution.

Finally, we present how γ̄ affects the peak of the epidemic.

This is a valid solution, if 0 < γ̄ 2 ≤ 1. Without loss of generality,
we can assume β 2 < β 1 . Then

Theorem 3.4. If the peak of new cases happens when the total
cases are Rpeak , then

γ̄ 2 > 0 =⇒ R t > γ̄ 1 N (1 − (β 2 /β 1 )),

The above lemma suggests that we should not attempt to learn
the parameters solely from the “tail” of the epidemic. However,
using the beginning part only, we cannot reliably learn γ̄ as discussed earlier. Next, we identify what data needs to be included to
guarantee accurate learning of γ̄ .

Theorem 3.3. Suppose, (β 0 , γ̄ 0 ) is a solution obtained from the
given data. Let β ∗ ≥ β 0 ≥ (1 − ϵ)β ∗ , for some 0 ≤ ϵ < 1. Then for
any Rτ , there exists a 0 < δ < 1 such that choosing data R t > Rτ
guarantees that (1 − δ )γ̄ 0 ≤ γ̄ ∗ ≤ γ̄ 0 .

Next, we utilize Theorems 3.1, 3.3, and 3.4 to learn the parameters
β and γ̄ .

Proof. Since, β 0 ≤ β ∗ , γ̄ 0 ≥ γ̄ ∗ . Suppose, for some δ > 0, we
wish to prove that that γ̄ ∗ ≥ (1 − δ )γ̄ 0 . Assume the contrary that
γ̄ ∗ < (1 − δ )γ̄ 0 . Then, using Equation 8,

LEARNING

Unlike [12] where the goal was to perform forecasts in an adaptive
fashion even during changing policies, here, our main goal is identifying γ̄ . This knowledge can then be used for performing forecasts.
For learning, we first manually identify and remove the part of the
data where the effect of social distancing is visible. For instance, in
Figure 1 the initial part shows rapid rise when no precautions were
taken. This step is necessary for our axiom that the remaining data

can be assumed to follow the same dynamics, i.e, has a true unique
(β, γ̄ ).

4.1

Heuristic Methods

We also propose treating β and γ̄ simultaneously as learnable parameters as a heuristic approach. Since, Theorems 3.1 and 3.3 do not
apply, we cannot perform Test1 to ensure reliability. However, we
can perform Test2. As in the case of Fixed Infection Rate Method,
we have two ways of learning the heuristic models.

Fixed Infection Rate Method

In this approach we utilize the fact that the effect of the unreported
cases is not seen in the initial part of the infection. Therefore, we
consider an initial part of the reported cases data up to time t f . We
use this initial part to train the model to learn β 0 by fixing γ̄ = 1.
Then, by Theorem 3.1, β ∗ ≤ β 0 ≤ (1 − ϵ)β ∗ , for some ϵ.
Then, we train a linear model by fixing the previously learned
β 0 as a constant and learn γ̄ 0 . We identify the largest value of
R t = Rmax available in the dataset. From Theorem 3.3, it follows
that setting
N ϵγ̄ 0
δ=
(11)
Rmax
ensures that there is at least one data point for the model to identify
γ̄ 0 such that (1 − δ )γ̄ 0 ≤ γ̄ ∗ .
Next we discuss, how to identify the value of ϵ. Note that ϵ as
calculated in Theorem 3.1 relies on γ̄ ∗ , which is not known. We
use the fact that a δ must exist such that γ̄ ∗ ≥ (1 − δ )γ̄ 0 . Using this
bound in Theorem 3.1, there exists a δ for which
R f (1 − (1 − δ )γ̄ 0 )
ϵ=

Non-linear Curve Fitting. Learning is performed by fitting a curve
over time as opposed to a linear model by treating the initial values
∆Rτ −J , . . . , ∆Rτ −1 as learnable parameters as well.
It is possible to derive reliability bounds on these heuristics as
well, however, they are unlikely to be useful. We wish to identify
a lower bound on reporting probability, therefore, if γ̄ 0 ≤ γ̄ ∗ , then
we have nothing to prove. Suppose, γ̄ 0 ≥ γ̄ ∗ . Then we would like
to show that γ̄ ∗ ≤ (1 − δ )γ̄ 0 , which follows the same derivation
as Equation 11. Choosing an epsilon here is difficult – Using the
scheme as in Fixed Infection Rate algorithm leads to δ > 1. A valid
choice is ϵ = 1 − β 0 (obtained using β ∗ ≤ 1), which would result in
δ = N (1 − β 0 )γ̄ 0 ./Rmax . This is often larger than 1 in practice, and
thus not useful.
Here, we have chosen k = 1 as our Test1 is derived for scalar
β. However, the above algorithms can be used (without reliability
tests) for any value of k with Test2. In Section 5.2 we have explored
the effectiveness of the above algorithms for k > 1.

Putting the value ϵ in Equation 11 results in a quadratic equation

We obtained all the reported cases fom JHU CSSE COVID19 dataset [1].
Particularly we extracted county level data for New York City and
Los Angeles. These were used because these two counties have
performed serology tests with initial estimation of number of unreported cases. We further performed experiments on all US states,
most of which did not pass our tests for reliability. Here we will
report the results on New York, Illinois, Massachusetts, and New
Jersey - four of the states with the most reported cases. Population of the counties and states were obtained from the US Census
Bureau [4].
The county data showed significant amount of noise, and so,
it was smoothed with moving average over two weeks, before
applying our learning algorithms. The state-level timeseries were
relatively less noisy, and were smoothed with moving average over
one week. All the code was written in MATLAB and is available
online1 . We set k = 1 and J = 7 for the US counties and states.
The choice for J was driven by observed weekly periodicity in the
data [11].

Here Rˆt ∀t are true observed values. Least square optimization is
performed using trust-region reflective algorithm [7]. Note that the
above approach may be prone to noisy initial values. However, we
smooth the data before learning the parameters to avoid noise.
Alternatively, the initial values ∆Rτ −J , . . . , ∆Rτ −1 can also be
treated as learnable parameters. In this case,

tained by the recurrence relation ∆R t = 1 − γ̄RNt X t β to the observed data < ∆Rτ −J , . . . ∆Rτ −1 , Rτ , Rτ +1 . . . ∆RT >. While this
approach is better for dealing with noisy data, it may be prone to
overfitting due to additional J parameters. Least square optimization is performed using trust-region reflective algorithm [7].

the three methods accurately forecast by learning on the interval
(70, 90). To assess whether these fits actually retrieve the values of
γ̄ , we present the learned parameters in Table 1. Note that only for
the interval (30, 50) all three methods are able to identify γ̄ close
to its original value, i.e., 0.1. While we were able to see accurate
forecasts for the interval (70, 90), the learned values of γ̄ are far
from the true value. This reinforces our claim that there exists a
certain window of data which is needed to accurately learn γ̄ .

To demonstrate the effectiveness and limitations of the three approaches, we used the same setting as in Section 3.2 but with added
noise to simulate an epidemic. We attempted to retrieve the parameters (β, γ̄ ) using our three learning approaches - Non-linear
Incremental Learning NL(i), Non-linear Curve Fitting NL(f), and
Fixed Infection Rate Learning (F). These methods learn the models
fitted on data for T ∈ (τ1 , τ2 ) for various intervals. Here, Fixed
Infection Rate approach is simplified to use use (1, τ1 ) to first identify β, and (τ1 , τ2 ) to identify γ̄ , without any reliability guarantee.
Note that here, k = 2 and our reliability analysis applies only to
k = 1. Regardless, we perform these experiments to observe the
effect of k > 1. Figure 3 shows the fit along with forecasts until
the end of the epidemic. Observe that for the interval (30, 50) all
methods are able to accurately forecast. ’NL(i)’ and ’NL(f)’ are able
to accurately forecast for the interval (50, 70). It also seems that

reporting an infected case. Therefore, 1/γ̄ forms the upper bound
on the estimated number of total cases as a factor of reported cases.
We report these upper bounds in Table 2. We have shown the factors
obtained using 95% confidence interval on γ̄ . Additionally, for Fixed
Infection Rate learning, we have provided an additional bound

obtained from Theorem 3.3 with δ obtained from Equation 13. The
three methods result in factors close to each other (39-44) for New
York City. However, the reliable bound obtained was 63. Figure 4
suggests that all three methods produce good fit for New York City.
Note that this factor provides an upper bound on the actual ratio of
total to reported cases. As an illustration, if we agree that the bound
obtained for NYC is 40 and ρ = 0.5, i.e., half of the population was
able to completely isolate itself reducing its probability of infection
to zero, then the the number of true cases will 0.5 × 36, i.e, 18 times
of the reported cases. On the other hand, none of the results for Los
Angeles were sensible (see Table 2). ‘OOR’ indicates that the 95%
confidence interval was out of the feasible range of the solution.
For the method ‘F’, Test1 failed. It implies that it may be too early to
reliably estimate the upper bound of this factor from Los Angeles
data.
Note that antibody tests in New York in April estimated that
24.7% of the entire population were infected2 . Based on the population of New York City and the number of reported cases at the
time, this translates to actual cases being roughly 13.8 times the
reported cases.

bound being 35.17. Note that the state-wide antibodies study in early
May estimated that 12.3% of the state population was infected3 . This
translates to actual cases being roughly 7.6 times the reported cases.
For Illinois, Massachusetts and New Jersey, this factor is roughly
33-37, 27-31, and 19-21, with worst case upper bound being 40.86,
38.28, and 29.22, respectively. If we assume that these states are
similar enough that they have the same probability γ of reporting
and the same fraction of population that is completely isolated,
then we can conclude that for all these states, the true cases cannot
be more than 29.22 times, which satisfies all the upper bounds. All
four states passed Test2 (peak test) with δ 3 = 0.2.
We have not presented results for the US at country-level due to
high heterogeneity in the infection trends of various states. Therefore, learning a single parameter for the entire country may not
be accurate, and it may be better to learn separately for different
states.

CONCLUSIONS

We have proposed Fixed Infection Rate algorithm to reliably estimate a bound on number of unreported cases. The algorithm is
built upon key theorems that identify limitations of learnability of
reporting probability. We have also proposed two heuristics that
learn this bound but do not provide guarantees. We demonstrate
through simulated experiments that all three methods are able to
identify the bound correctly on certain regions of the epidemic. We
emphasize that these algorithms learn γ̄ which combines the effect
of reporting probability and isolated population. Particularly, if a
fraction ρ of the total population completely isolates itself, thus

We also estimated the bound on the total number of actual cases
as a factor of reported cases for various states. Table 3 shows the
results for New York, Illinois, Massachusetts, and New Jersey. All
the states presented here, passed Test1 and Test2. Figure 5 shows
the model fit obtained using the learned parameters.
For New York our methods estimated that the bound on total
cases is 23-25 times of the reported cases with the reliable worst case

getting removed from the epidemic, then γ̄ = (1 − ρ)γ , where γ is
the probability of reporting a case (symptomatic or asymptomatic).
Hence, γ̄ forms the lower limit for reporting probability. In other
words we can find an upper bound on total number of infected cases.
Applying our algorithm on the data during the social distancing
phase, we conclude with high confidence that the actual number
of cases cannot be more than 35 times in New York, 40 times in
Illinois, 38 times in Massachusetts, and 29 times in New Jersey,
than the reported cases. In future work, we will explore obtaining
tighter bounds, when the precautions are relaxed and the fraction
of isolated population ρ is reduced. We will further explore how to
utilize data across changing dynamics due to changing policies to
strengthen these bounds.
