Abstract
As of July, 2020, acute respiratory syndrome caused by coronavirus
COVID-19 is spreading over the world and causing severe economic damages. While minimizing human contact is effective in managing the outbreak, it causes severe economic losses. Strategies solving this dilemma
by considering interrelation between the spread of the virus and economic
activities are in urgent needs for mitigating the health and economic damage. Here we propose an abstract agent-based model for the outbreak of
COVID-19 in which economic activities are taken into account. The computational simulation of the model recapitulated the trade-off between
health and economic damage associated with lockdown measures. Based
on the simulation results, we discuss how macroscopic dynamics of infection and economy emerge from the individuals behaviours. We believe
our model can serve as a platform for discussing solutions to the abovementioned dilemma.

Introduction

The acute respiratory syndrome caused by a coronavirus, COVID-19, first reported in Wuhan in December 2019 [1–4], has spread over the world causing
severe health and economic damages. To date (July 21th, 2020), more than 14

1

million people have been tested positive for the disease and more than 610 thousand people have died due to COVID-19 [5]. From the economic aspect, many
people have suffered from economic losses and lost their jobs [6]. It should be
noted here that there is a dilemma between mitigation of the spread of COVID19
and reduction of economic losses: namely, the strategies for decreasing contacts
between humans such as draconic lockdown and social distancing hinder normal
economic activities. Hence, it is an urgent issue to solve this dilemma and to
find strategies to mitigate outbreak minimizing economic losses.
To date, many mathematical models for the spread of infectious diseases
have been proposed using differential equations [7–10] and agent-based models
[11–13]. Recently, mathematical models for the spread of COVID-19 have been
proposed from various contexts, e.g. [14–23]. These studies solely modelled the
spread of infectious diseases, yet they did not describe economic activities mathemtaically. Other studies focused on economic impacts of COVID-19 [24–28],
some of which considered details of economic processes and predicted economic
impact under realistic assumptions [24–26]; thus, they are complex and difficult
to capture the essence. Meanwhile, the others estimated the economic impact
using a simple model based on differential equations [27,28]. While these models
describe the economic effects at a population level, how individuals behaviour
affects the macroscopic dynamics of infection and economy remains unclear. A
definitive mathematical model that captures the essential mechanism of interrelation between the spread of the virus and economic activities at an individual
level could fill this gap.
In this study, we propose a simple mathematical model that considers both
infections of COVID-19 and economic activities. Our aim is to extract the
essence of the relation between the spread of COVID-19 and the economic activities, rather than making a quantitative and accurate prediction of infection
and economy. Moreover, we are interested in how macroscopic dynamics of
infection and economy emerge from individuals behaviours, rather than macroscopic description through coarse graining. Hence, we propose a highly abstract
and simple agent-based model without employing detailed and realistic assumptions. More specifically, we propose a cellular automaton model in which mobile
agents with the internal states regarding infection and economy interact with
others and update their internal states. We demonstrate through simulations
how the health and economic state evolves depending on parameters. Based on
the results, we discuss the effect of lockdown.

2.1

Model
Overview of the proposed model

We consider a cellular automaton model in which hexagonal cells are aligned
regularly on a two-dimensional plane (Fig. 1). N agents are on the plane.
Each agent has a home cell, and can stay at home or move to its adjacent cell
every time step. Each agent has a health state Statei and money Mi , which are
updated through interaction with other agents. Agents die when they do not
recover after infection or when their money becomes zero.
Agents have their own business. We assume that agent i sells goods to
agent j when agent j visits the home cell of agent i. Prime costs of goods

Figure 1: Outline of the proposed model. When ρi,k (t) exceeds integral multiple
of ρth , job type k is added to the bottom of the target list of agent i. Agent i
visits the home of the nearest agent among agents whose job type corresponds
to the top of the target list. When it reached the home, it pays a unit amount
money to buy the goods. Then, since the demand of agent i is satisfied, ρi,k
decreases by ρth . The top item in the target list is removed, and the other items
in the target list move up. Then, agent i visits the next target. When there is
no item in the target list, agent i goes back and stay its home.
are not considered. There are several types of businesses, which range from
selling commodities to selling luxury goods. Each agent chooses one of them,
and it does not change temporarily. Each agent has demands for goods. When
the demand exceeds a certain threshold, the agent goes out to buy them; it
pays money when it reached its home of an agent who sells the needed goods
(Fig. 1). When experiencing lockdown under outbreak, agents do not tend
to demand luxury goods, while they demand commodities as usual. In the
following subsections, we describe the details of the proposed model.

2.2

Model of infection

We model the spread of COVID-19 by drawing inspiration from a spatial susceptibleexposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model [13]. Each agent has a health state
Statei , which can take a susceptible state (S), an exposed state (E), an infectious state (I), a quarantine state (Q), a recovered state (R), and a death state
(D).
The state changes according to the rule shown in Fig. 2. When an agent
with state S is in a cell occupied by an agent with state E or I, Statei changes
from S to E with probability pE every time step. Here, although the previously proposed SEIR model [13] assumed that only agents with state I have
infectability, we assumed that agents with state E in addition to state I have
infectability since asymptomatic patients of COVID-19 have infectability [29].
When τE time steps have passed after the transition from state S to E, the
state changes to state I. Agents with state I changes to state Q and D with
3

probability pD and pQ , respectively, every time step. Agents with state Q,
which represents hospitalized patients, do not have infectability and stop any
economic activity described in the next subsection. Agents with state Q also
die with probability pD every time step. Regardless of whether quarantined or
not, the state changes to R when τR time steps have passed after the transition
from state E to I.

2.3

Model of economic activity

Each agent has money Mi . The money Mi decreases and increases when agent i
buys goods and when other agents buy agent i’s goods, respectively. In addition
to buying and selling, high-income persons pay high taxes while low-income
persons receive public assistance in real societies. Thus, we describe the time
evolution of Mi as
Mi (t + 1) = Mi (t) + qin,i (t) − qout,i (t) + K(M̂ − Mi (t)),

(1)

where K and M̂ are positive constants, and qin,i (t) and qout,i (t) denote the
amount of money increased by selling and that decreased by buying, respec4

tively. The fourth term on the right-hand side represents the effect of income
redistribution: high-income persons pay high taxes and low-income persons receive public assistance. Agent i dies when Mi (t) becomes zero.
Each agent chooses one of m job types, which does not change temporarily.
Agent i’s demand for goods produced by job type k (i = 1, 2, · · ·, N and k =
1, 2, · · ·, m) is denoted by ρi,k . The time evolution of ρi,k is described as
ρi,k (t + 1) = ρi,k (t) + ǫk + max{σk (Mi − λUi ), 0},

(2)

where ǫk , σk , and λ are positive constants, and Ui represents the degree of an
outbreak, which formulation is described below. Parameter ǫk represents the
increase rate of the demand which does not depend on the money agent i owns
or the degree of the outbreak. In contrast, σk represents the increase rate of
the demand which is affected by the money agent i owns or the degree of the
outbreak. ǫk and σk are set to be large and small, respectively, when job type k
treats commodities, while vice versa when job type k treats luxury goods. The
third term on the right-hand side of Eq. (2) means that the demand increases
rapidly when agent i has much money, yet the increase stops under the outbreak.
Parameter λ represents the degree of a lockdown under the outbreak.
The degree of outbreak Ui is formulated as
Ui (t + 1) = (1 − κ)Ui (t) + κni (t),

(3)

where ni is the number of agents with state Q within the radius r from agent i,
which represents the number of patients monitored in the residential area. Here,
only the number of quarantined agents is counted, based on the assumption
that people cannot notice that people who are exposed to the virus but not
hospitalized (state E and I) are actually exposed to the virus. Eq. (3) means
that Ui (t) increases/decreases followed by the increase/decrease of ni (t). Ui (t)
is updated rapidly when κ is large. Thus, κ characterizes how fast lockdown is
performed in response to the spread of the virus.
Each agent has a target list, which represents the priority of purchasing
goods (Fig. 1). When the demand ρi,k exceeds the integral multiple of ρth , job
type k is added to the bottom of the target list of agent i. Agent i visits the
home of the nearest agent among agents whose job type corresponds to the top
of the target list. When it reached its home, it pays a unit amount of money
to buy the goods. Here we simply assumed that this deal holds even when the
selling agent is not at its home. Then, since the demand of agent i is satisfied,
ρi,k decreases by ρth . The top item in the target list is removed, and the other
items in the target list move up. Then, agent i visits the next target. When
there is no item in the target list, agent i goes back and stay its home.
The rule for the movement of each agent is described as follows (Fig. 3).
First, the target position of agent i is defined as the home of the nearest agent
among agents whose job type corresponds to the top of the target list. When
there is no item in the target list, the target position is defined as agent i’s
home. A unit vector which points the target position from the current position
of agent i is denoted by Di . When the target position is identical to the current
position, Di = 0. Agent i moves to its adjacent cells or stays at the current
position with the following probability pi (l):
pi (l) =

(1 + el · Di ),

(l = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

in the case of Di 6= 0, and
pi (l) = 0,
pi (0)

(l = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

(5)

in the case of Di = 0, where the definition of the subscript l in el is as shown
in Fig. 3. Thus, owing to the bias term el · Di in Eq. (4), agent i tends to
approach the target position.

Simulation Results

We performed simulations of the proposed model. The number of cells along
the horizontal and vertical direction was 43 and 50, respectively, and periodic
boundary condition was adopted. Except for the experiment shown in Fig. 9,
the total number of agents N was set to 1000. Initial amount of money was set
to M̃ for all agents. The homes of the agents were randomly placed without any
overlap. Each agent was initially located at its home. Each trial was performed
for 30000 time steps.
There were four job types in the simulation. The number of people for each
job type was set to be identical. Parameters ǫk and σk (k = 1, 2, 3, 4) were
determined as
ǫk

=

σk

=

0.1(k − 1)
0.5 − ǫk
.
M̃

(6)

Thus, persons whose job type number was large sold commodities while those
whose job type number was small sold luxury goods. From Eqs. (2) and (6),
the increase rate of the demand ρi,k does not depend on the job type when
Mi = M̃ .
Non-dimensional parameters were used in the simulation. Since the proposed
model is highly abstract, it is difficult to determine the parameters based on
realistic data. However, the duration of latent period τE and that of infection τR
were chosen to roughly mimic the property of COVID-19. Specifically, τE and
τR were set to be 600 and 1200; these non-dimensional values correspond to 7
and 14 days, respectively, if each time step is rescaled to 16.8 minutes, and these

values roughly agree with the property of COVID-19. The death probability pD
was set so that the death rate becomes about 10% if there was no lockdown,
i.e., λ = 0. Economic parameters such as M̃ , M̂ , ρth , and K were determined
so that death caused by economic loss becomes almost zero in the absence of
outbreak but some people die due to economic loss under lockdown during an
outbreak. The parameter values thus determined are shown in Table 1. These
values were used when unspecified hereafter.

3.1

Results when no patient exists

To capture the basic property of the proposed model, simulations were performed under the condition where no patient exists, i.e., Statei = S for all
i. By removing the factor of infection from the model, we can easily understand the basic property of economic activity. In this experiment, the parameter K was changed to investigate the effect of income redistribution by
taxes and public assistances. The results were evaluated by the number of
deaths causedP
by economic loss Deco and the variance of the amount of money
N
V [M ] ≡ N −1 i=1 (Mi − M̄ )2 , where M̄ is the average of Mi .
Supplementary videos 1–3 provided in [30] show the results when K =
0, 0.00007, and 0,00014, respectively. Figure 4 shows the time evolution of V [M ]
and Deco for several values of K. It is found that V [M ] increase as the time
passes. The increase rate is smaller as K is larger (Fig. 4(a)). The number
of deaths Deco increased as the time passes for small K, while it remains zero
for large K (Fig. 4(b)). This result is reasonable because frequent buying and
selling events cause the distribution of Mi to spread in a diffusive manner. As
K increased, the difference between the rich and the poor decreased, and thus,
the number of deaths caused by economic loss decreased.

3.2

Effects of lockdown

We performed simulations under the condition that the health state changed
from S to E with the probability of 0.005 when the time step is 5000. Parameter
K was set to be 0.00007. Cases of λ = 0, 120, and 210 were examined to
investigate the effect of lockdown.
Supplementary videos 4–6 provided in [30] show the results when λ = 0, 120,
and 210, respectively. Figs. 5 (a)–(c) show the time evolution of the number
of agents with each health state. When λ = 0, the infection spread rapidly
and more than 80 % of the agents were infected. The maximum number of the
quarantined patients (state Q) was 278, and the number of deaths caused by
infection Dinf (t) finally reached 101 (Fig. 5(a)). As λ increased, the number of
patients and the deaths caused by infection decreased considerably (Figs. 5(b)
and (c)). When λ = 210, less than 20% of the agents were infected (Fig. 5(c)).
Next, we observed the economic tendency under these cases. The results
were evaluated by the total number of deaths caused by economic loss and
the total amount of money for each job type, denoted by Deco,k (t) and Tk (t),
respectively (k = 1, 2, 3, 4). Namely, Tk (t) is given by
X
Tk (t) =
Mi (t).
(7)
i∈job type k

The time evolutions of Deco,k (t) and Tk (t) for the cases of λ = 0, 120, and 210
are shown in Figs. 5(d)–(f) and (g)–(h), respectively. For λ = 0, only a few
agents died because of economic loss (Fig. 5(d)). The total amount of money
Tk (t) was kept almost constant (Fig. 5(g)). When agents undergo lockdown,
i.e., λ > 0, the economic gap among job types is generated. Specifically, Tk (t)
became small for small k and vice versa for large k followed by the outbreak.
The economic gap is the highest around 15000 time steps, and it is mitigated
gradually until around 30000 time steps (Figs. 5(h) and (i)). The number of
deaths caused by economic loss is larger for small k (Fig. 5(e)), and it is larger
as λ is larger (Fig. 5(f)). This result suggests that people who sell luxury goods
suffer from economic loss caused by lockdown, while those who sell commodities
do not. However, the persons who are suffering from economic loss can come
back to their normal life after the outbreak is over.
In summary, lockdown is effective for mitigating an outbreak, while it induces
economic gap and increases the number of deaths caused by economic loss.

3.3

Effect of other parameters

For further understanding of the properties of the proposed model, we performed simulations by changing several parameters expected to affect resultant
behaviours. Specifically, we changed the infectious rate pE , the duration of infection τE and τR , the amount of money M̃ and M̂ , the total number of agents
N , and the quickness for the response to outbreak κ, since we expected that
these parameters would affect infection and economic dynamics. For each parameter, we also changed λ and made color maps. Other simulation conditions
were the same as the previous subsection. Results were evaluated by the ratio of
the number of deaths caused by infection Dinf to the number of agents N and
that of the number of deaths caused by economic loss Deco to the number of
agents N at 30000 time step. Ten trials were performed for each parameter, and

the average values of Dinf /N and Deco /N are shown hereafter. In the following
subsections, we will show the results when the parameters are varied.
3.3.1

pE dependence

Figure 6 shows the result when the infectious rate pE was changed. As is
expected, the number of deaths is smaller as pE is smaller. When pE is large,
Dinf /N is large for small λ while Deco /N is large for large λ. Namely, whereas
infection spreads in the absence of lockdown, economic loss becomes large if
lockdown is excessive. This trade-off becomes severer as the infectious rate is
larger.
3.3.2

τE and τR dependence

Figure 7 shows the result when the duration of infection τE and τR were changed
with holding the relation τR = 2τE . When τE and τR are large, Dinf /N is large
for small λ while Deco /N is large for large λ. Thus, the above-mentioned trade
off becomes severer as the duration of infection is longer.
3.3.3

M̃ and M̂ dependence

Figure 8 shows the result when the initial amount of money M̃ is changed. M̂
in Eq. (1) was also changed so that M̂ = M̃ . The number of death by infection
Dinf /N is not much affected by M̃ . However, Deco /N is larger as M̃ is smaller.

are shown in (a) and (b), respectively.

Figure 7: Simulation results when τE , τR , and λ are changed with satisfying
τR = 2τE . Dinf /N and Deco /N are shown in (a) and (b), respectively.
This means that people cannot tolerate lockdown if they do not have enough
money.
3.3.4

N dependence

Figure 9 shows the result when the total number of agents N is changed. For
small λ, Dinf /N is larger as N is larger, which indicates that infection tends to
spread when population density is large. Meanwhile, Deco /N tends to increase
as λ increases.
3.3.5

κ dependence

Figure 10 shows the result when the quickness for the response to outbreak κ
is changed. When κ is small, the outbreak cannot be mitigated owing to the
slow response. As a consequence, Dinf /N tends to become large. Furthermore,
since agents have to undergo lockdown for a long time, Deco /N tends to be also
large. Thus, responding quickly is important for both mitigating outbreak and
maintaining economic activities.

Discussion and conclusion

We proposed a simple and abstract mathematical model of COVID-19 outbreak
with economic activities. Simulation results showed that lockdown measures
enable mitigating outbreak, while it generates economic gap among job types.
The reason why the economic gap generates can be explained as follows. The
income of agents who sell luxury goods decreases during an outbreak because
demands for luxury goods decrease owing to lockdown. Since they have to
buy commodities as usual, they become poorer. In contrast, agents who sell
commodities can get income as usual, yet they do not buy luxury goods owing
to lockdown. As a consequence, they become richer. This suggests that in
real societies, governments should make efforts to reduce the economic gap;
otherwise, lockdown measures cannot be continued, which makes the mitigation
of an outbreak difficult.
The result shown in Fig. 8 suggests that people cannot tolerate lockdown
if their overall economic level is low. Thus, it is particularly harder for the
communities with low economic power to mitigate an outbreak while maintaining economic activities. A possible solution to this is to respond to the spread
of the virus as early as possible. As suggested from Fig. 10, if the response
is done earlier (which corresponds to large κ in our model), it is possible to
stop an outbreak without causing severe economic damages. If a government
has failed to respond quickly and the virus has spread, people should anticipate

are shown in (a) and (b), respectively.
other possibilities such as the development of antiviral drugs and weakening of
virus, which correspond to decreasing pE in our model.
Because we did not consider production activities and simply assumed that
prime costs of goods are zero, our model is not suitable for making precise
and quantitative predictions, especially on the economic impact. However, our
model captures the essence of the interrelation between the spread of virus and
economic activities, and thus, we believe that our model can become a platform
for discussing strategies for mitigating outbreak while maintaining economic
activities. Indeed, our model potentially has many possibilities in the future. For
example, it may be possible to take the effect of long-distance movement with
transportations like airplanes and trains into account. Defining the capacity
of hospitals may enable us to discuss how to avoid overwhelming hospitals. It
may be also interesting to introduce individual characters of each agent and to
discuss how selfish persons affect spread of the virus and economic activities.
Moreover, beyond the outbreak of COVID-19, our model may share a common mechanism with other systems that can survive under harsh circumstances
with limited resources, such as bacterial biofilms [31] and community of vampire
bats [32]. Extracting the common mechanism may lead to establish a general
design principle for artificial systems with high survivability.
