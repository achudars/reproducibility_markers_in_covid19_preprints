Abstract. Controlling the COVID-19 pandemic is an urgent global challenge. The
rapid geographic spread of SARS-CoV-2 directly reflects the social structure. Before
effective vaccines and treatments are widely available, we have to rely on alternative,
non-pharmaceutical interventions, including frequency testing, contact tracing, social
distancing, mask wearing, and hand-washing, as public health practises to slow down
the spread of the disease. However frequent testing is the key in the absence of any
alternative. We propose a network approach to determine the optimal low resources
setting oriented pool testing strategies that identifies infected individuals in a small
number of tests and few rounds of testing, at low prevalence of the virus. We
simulate stochastic infection curves on societies under quarantine. Allowing some social
interaction is possible to keep the COVID-19 curve flat. However, similar results can be
strategically obtained searching and isolating infected persons to preserve a healthier
social structure. Here, we analyze which are the best strategies to contain the virus
applying an algorithm that combine samples and testing them in groups [1]. A relevant
parameter to keep infection curves flat using this algorithm is the dairy frequency of
testing at zones where a high infection rate is reported. On the other hand, the
algorithm efficiency is low for random search of infected people.

1. Introduction
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has upended the world, quickly challenging settled
assumptions and certainties. It is a new virus with an extraordinary efficiency in
transmitting from person to person and a rather high level of morbidity and mortality
that raises with age and co-morbidities. The non-pharmaceutical intervention of
detection and isolation of infected people is a key policy to reduce the spread of
COVID-19. The aim is to slow transmission and the growth rate of infections to avoid
overburdening healthcare systems an approach widely known as flattening the curve. In
order to identify the infected people SARS-CoV-2 tests must be performed.
However, each diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 test costs 30-50 US dollars [2]. Therefore,
testing many people in a population regularly, as may be essential to flatten the curve,
is beyond the reach of most low and even some mid-income countries. However, there
are more efficient ways than the naive approach of testing everyone in which far fewer
tests are actually needed, especially at low prevalence. It is much more efficient to
pool (or combine) samples and test them together. Group testing initially appears in a
paper of Dorfman in 1943 [3]. Other algorithms of pooling samples have been proposed
recently [1, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Estimating the prevalence of a virus within a community prior
to widespread disease transmission may help public health officials predict when to
prepare for an increase in cases. With over sixty eight million cases in the world at time
of writing this paper [8], this sort of screening strategy is probably not necessary at this
point in the pandemic. Nevertheless, these techniques are likely to be valuable at the
beginning of a future outbreak to track the spread of a virus across the world over time.
Specially because human behaviors that perturb the human-microbial status quo may
have reached a tipping point that predicts the inevitability of an acceleration of disease
emergences [9].
On the other hand, this approach may be particularly helpful in settings where
the number of infections is low and declining, and most test results are expected to be
negative. For example, in a community where the infection seems to be under control
and reopenings of schools and businesses are planned, pooled testing of employees and
students could be an effective strategy.
Our goal in this work is to analyze the way in which different strategies of
surveillance testing in a low prevalence stage, like frequency and random vs. localized
search of infected people, change the epidemics curve. We choose the hypercube
algorithm of pool testing [1] in the same way as we may have chosen some other
pool testing algorithm because we are not particularly interested in the efficiency of
the algorithm but in the strategy of the algorithm application. A similar study to
monitor whether epidemics were contained or became uncontrolled depending on the
frequency of testing was studied with a stochastic agent-based model for SARS-CoV2
transmission [10]. To investigate the effects of surveillance testing strategies at the
population level, we used simulations to monitor whether epidemics were contained
or became uncontrolled, We will take a network approach to simulate the evolution

COVID

of the epidemic on a society in order to study not just the frequency but also the
spatial distribution of testing. In order to study the different behavior of the epidemic
when different test pooling samples are applied the social group under the epidemic is
represented as families or small communities that interact with each other in a random
way. We choose a sparse network to reflect the lockdown restriction. Similar structures
have been proposed in [11] for carrying out comparative tests of different methods for
community detection in complex networks.
The paper is laid out as follows. In section 2 we define the epidemiological network
model in which the connections between individuals are modeled as static links [12, 13],
assuming the contagion as a process faster than the network evolution. The main results
are presented in section 3. In section 3.1, the impact of the social structure given by
the network model on the spread of the disease is analyzed. This allow us to establish
a frame of reference to study, in section 3.2, the optimal strategies of the pool testing
based on the geometry of a hypercube, at low prevalence [1]. Finally, in section 4, we
state our conclusions.
2. The epidemiological model of social networks under quarantine
In our sparse network model, we assume that the small communities (families) are composed of a few members connected to each other and also to other families with a number
of external static links triggering the spreading epidemics (see figure 1). The number
of members of each small community or family is kint ± ∆kint nodes connected in average to kext nodes that belong to other small communities. The nodes of the network
represent individuals that can be either susceptible, infected or recovered, subject to
interactions with their neighbors (i.e. other individuals directly linked to him/her by either intracommunity or intercommunity connections). As a result of these interactions,
susceptible individuals can become infected and spread the disease over time before they
recover or isolate using a strategy in affected areas by the virus based on the geometry
of a hypercube. Starting with a number of outbreaks of the disease randomly located
on the network, the model dynamics is defined by iterating a sequence of possibilities,
as follows:
(1) an individual is selected at random;
(2a) if the individual is infected, he/she can transmit the virus to his/her neighbors
with an infectious contact rate of COVID-19 pandemic β or can recover with probability
1/trec , with trec the recovery time. This time is different for each infected individual,
given by a Gaussian distribution around the mean value trec (see Table 1).
(2b) if the individual has infected neighbors, he/she can become infected with an
effective contact rate β.
(3) with probability 1/tlif e , the selected individual can die, where tlif e is the average
life expectancy. For simplicity without loss of generality, if he/she dies, an individual is
born in his/her place without intercommunity connections.

We consider that the infectious contact rate β is constant over time but may change
with different pairs of neighbors according to a Gaussian distribution around its mean
value β (see table 1). Indeed, each individual experiences a different number of contacts per unit time with their neighbors, proportionally reflected in β. In other words,

5

COVID

β grows with the probability of disease transmission per unit time and also with the
interactions between neighbors [18, 19].
The system evolves towards absorbing states with a maximum of affected
individuals by the pandemic i.e., frozen configurations that are not capable of further
changes. The final state, consisting of recovered and susceptible individuals that were
not infected depends on the number of outbreaks of the disease and on the community
structure. We are interested in studying the efficiency of a search and isolation algorithm
based on the geometry of a hypercube of infected individuals on affected areas applied
to the model of social networks under quarantine. The affected areas are discovered due
to the rate of infected individuals report to health centres.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Epidemic spread on social networks under quarantine
In order to set the stage for the investigation of testing effects, let us first show results
concerning social network model under quarantine without any epidemic control. As
mentioned above, in the absence of testing, the system reaches a total number of infected
individuals that depends on the parameter values of the disease and the number of
outbreaks at the beginning. These outbreaks are randomly located on the networks.

For SIR model, all susceptible persons have the same probability of contagion and
there is no distinction between them.

100 outbreaks of the virus (solid, dashed and dotted lines, respectively). The exposed
susceptible individuals are defined as those persons having at least one infected neighbor.
For a given number of outbreaks, the mean density curve of these individuals (black lines)
reaches its maximum long before the corresponding infected people peak (red lines in
the same figure). The mean density of susceptible individuals exposed to the virus could
be clearly a measure to estimate the probability of contagion.
Also, figure 2 shows that infectiousness increases as the number of outbreaks per
inhabitant increases and the epidemic peak is earlier. This last result is expected
and also predicted by mean field models like Verhulst-Pearle sigmoid [20] or SIR [21].
Such compartmental models have proven flexible, tractable, and highly informative as
a general guide to the population-level behavior of diseases. Each compartment has
either susceptible, infected or recovered persons and the probability of disease-causing
contact with any member of a particular compartment is the same. This mean field
approximation leads to a fixed intensity of the infection peak i.e., it does not change
with the density of outbreaks under 10% as shown in figure 3(a). Moreover, these results
are easily collapsed by a simple translation on the horizontal axis. In figure 3(b), we
moved the curves of 10 and 100 outbreaks on the curve of the 1 outbreak, estimating
an initial pandemic growth as a geometric progression of common ratio
1
, per day.

Thus, the translation on the horizontal axis is

for 1, 10 and 100 outbreaks, respectively. The good collapse of the curves is apparent,
though a slight difference in the densities of individuals recovered is found at the

7

COVID

beginning of their collapse due to every curve starts without individuals recovered (this
difference is not visualized in the scale of figure 3(b)). Therefore, for the SIR model,
if the density of outbreaks is low enough and known, the pandemic is predictable over
time and it is useless for our goal of studying different searching and testing strategies.

Figure 4. Mean densities of recovered (green lines), active infected (red lines) and
susceptible exposed to the virus (black lines) individuals, without epidemic control,
obtained from 10 outbreaks of the virus on 100,000 inhabitants and social networks
under quarantine consisting of kint = 4 ± 2 cohabitants and two different mean
intercommunity connections: kext = 2 and 4 (solid and dashed lines, respectively).
The curves were averaged over 100 simulation runs.

On the other hand, our network model shows a different behavior. The height of the
epidemic peak is associated to the network social connectivity. Indeed, a few outbreaks
can become extinct without intervention, in areas with few connections and thus, the
intensity of the infection peak is low. Epidemic elimination may also be obtained for
a higher number of outbreaks when the network connectivity is reduced. This may be
clearly observed in figure 4, where the evolution of mean densities of recovered, active
infected and susceptible exposed to the virus individuals for two different social structures and a fixed number of outbreaks are shown. The enhancement of connectivity
in the network promotes the spread of the disease. Therefore, the social isolation is an
effective tool that delays the epidemic peak and also significantly reduces the total number of infected individuals, reflected in the number of recovered individuals (green lines
of figure 4). Since the social isolation has its socio-cultural and economic constraints,
in the next section, we will apply the algorithm based on the geometry of a hypercube
to search and reduce the infection in affected areas of social networks under quarantine.

3.2. Optimal strategies of pool testing to prevent the epidemic spread
The first tests start when a number nI0 of infected individuals report to health centres.
Each of these persons is considered an infection source and a scanning of their neighbors
is done until completing N/nI0 individuals around of each infection source, with N the

COVID

total number of screened persons per day. Once the sample is taken, the testing method
is applied. This method has been introduced in [1] and the idea is to pool NS subsamples
of the total sample N and test the combined subsample with a single test. If the test
is negative all subjects in the subsample are negative and it continues with another
subsample of NS persons. If the test is positive the hypercube algorithm is applied to
determine who are infected.
The algorithm consists of locating each individual of the positive subsample on a
D-dimensional hypercube lattice with L points in each direction. The hypercube has
D principal directions, containing the NS individuals of the positive subsample, so that
LD = NS . For example, for D = 3 and L = 3, the hypercube is a simple cube with
27 individuals arranged on a 3 × 3 × 3 grid (figure 5). Each slice of the hypercube is
tested and if is positive the algorithm is running again for the positive slices properly
selected to find the infected persons (see [1] for more details of the method). In short,
the algorithm is based on the idea that a slice through a D-dimensional hypercube is
itself a hypercube of dimension D − 1.

Figure 5. Illustration of sample pooling in the hypercube algorithm, for D = L = 3
and N = 27. Circles in red represent infected persons and the rest in cyan are
susceptible. Left panel: The hypercube is sliced into L slices, in each of the D principal
directions, and samples from N/L individuals are pooled into a sample for each slice.
For this example, 5 slices are positives leading to 4 suspicious persons: the infected
individuals and their neighbors pointed with the arrows. Right panel: the axis x with
the maximum number of positive slices is selected. Take one of these, itself a hypercube
of dimension D − 1, and run the hypercube algorithm again. The coordinates of the
corresponding infected individual are then uniquely identified, and those of the second
infected individual are inferred by elimination.

The effective size NS of the subgroups is chosen to minimize the total mean number
of tests per person. The testing increases as the number of infected individuals increases
in the subgroup. Therefore, the algorithm is effective if this number is low and if
tests with high sensitivity are used for the dilution of the subsamples, such as reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) tests [22, 23]. Assuming Poisson
statistics for the number of infected individuals in the subgroups and using L = 3

9

COVID

points in each direction of the hypercube, the optimal size to minimize the total number
of tests is [1]
NS ≃ 0.350/p,

(3)

with p the prevalence defined as the probability that any individual of the subgroup NS is
infected. The prevalence of the disease is unknown and we roughly estimate p ≈ nI0 /N
in the affected areas by the virus, considering that infection does not spread at the
beginning of the pandemic. Then, when the testing is finalized, infected individuals in
affected areas are found and isolated of their neighbors. Due to limited resources, a
maximum number of tests per day M is imposed. M is chosen lower than the sample
N of screened individuals per day. The testing is recursively repeated, estimating p as
the number of infected individuals isolated, divided by the samples used in the previous
testing. In our network model simulations, a fixed number of 15 % of infected persons
report to health centres in each round of testing. The first tests start when the 15 % of
infected individuals is equal or greater than one and thus, nI0 depends on the sample.
Figure 6(a) shows the density of active infected and recovered individuals for a
social network without epidemic control and with testing using the hypercube algorithm
and the simple method of one test per person on affected areas. For both methods of
epidemic control, an epidemic decrease is obtained, significantly improving for social
structures with less interaction (figure 6(b)). In this case, the hypercube algorithm
achieves control the epidemic. In fact, the density of recovered persons (dashed green
line in figure 6(b)) is very low since a few individuals were infected (dashed red line,
practically is not visualized in the scale of figure 6(b)).
Time saving is very important for a rapidly spreading infectious disease like COVID19. However, the regular testing is limited by costs and operational capacity of sampling.
In figures 6 (a)-(c), a maximum number of tests M = 200 on a maximum number of
screened individuals N = 2000 for every 100,000 inhabitants per day were considered,
but in part (c) the maximum number of tests and of screened persons are M/2 and N/2
every 12 hours, doubling the frequency of testing. This allows the search and isolation
of infected individuals in a shorter time and thus, can not infect others. Figure 6 (c)
shows that the hypercube algorithm achieves control of epidemic reducing the search
time for social networks with high connectivity.
The efficiency of the hypercube algorithm depends on the samples taken from
infected individuals report to health centres. If the search of infected individuals is
random, the efficiency of the algorithm is low. To check this, we take M persons
at random on the network and build hypercubes. Infection curves do not practically
change with a random search to both high and low connectivity networks. The search
on affected areas is essential to consistently reduce an epidemic like COVID-19. These
results are summarized in figure 7, in which the efficiency of the hypercube algorithm
(a) and the simple method of testing every person (b) as a function of the maximum
number of tests per day and of frequency of isolation of infected persons is shown,
for social networks with high connectivity. The efficiency is defined as the difference

between the total number of recovered individuals without epidemic control and with
epidemic control divided by the total number of recovered individuals without epidemic
control. The maximum number of scanned individuals is ten times the maximum number
of tests. The frequency is number of times that infected persons are isolated per day
respecting the maximum numbers of tests and scanned individuals (see figure 6 (c)). The
efficiency depends on the model of social networks, however the results shown in figure 7
are qualitatively useful. The frequency of search and isolation of infected individuals on
zones reported with virus is the relevant parameter to control the COVID-19. Indeed,
a remarkable increment of the algorithm’s efficiency is observed when the frequency
increases in comparison to an increase of the maximum number of tests per day.

4. Conclusions
The social, psychological and economic burdens throughout a pandemic lead to a
minimum threshold of interactions between persons originating a certain confined social
structure. We found that social networks with low connectivity between their individuals
reduce the contagion and can go a long way in keeping the curves of infected persons flat.
However, since most facets of economic and social life require person-to-person contact,
the testing, searching and isolating infected individuals helps to reduce the epidemics
and return sooner to normal activity. RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction) tests are accurate, but costly and are a challenge particularly for developing
countries. The search for infected individuals by grouping samples is considered in
this work. Particularly, we studied the epidemic evolution under different strategies of
application of a pool testing based on the geometry of a hypercube to isolate infected
persons applied to social networks under quarantine threatened by an epidemic with
high contagiousness and rapid spread as the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The pool
testing on social networks under quarantine is effective if the search of infected persons
is in zones where the virus was reported and the isolation of these individuals is done
as quickly as possible. The strategic search in affected zones by the virus and a high
frequency of isolation can overcome a massive testing. Indeed, we found that a massive
testing randomly applied to social networks with both high and low connectivities leads
to little impact on reduction of contagion.
