Title: ARIMA forecasting of COVID-19 incidence in Italy, Russia, and the USA

Gaetano Perone1
Abstract
The novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a severe respiratory infection that
officially occurred in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. In late February, the disease
began to spread quickly across the world, causing serious health, social, and economic
emergencies. This paper aims to forecast the short to medium-term incidence of COVID19 epidemic through the medium of an autoregressive integrated moving average
(ARIMA) model, applied to Italy, Russia, and the USA The analysis is carried out on the
number of new daily confirmed COVID-19 cases, collected by Worldometer website. The
best ARIMA models are Italy (4,2,4), Russia (1,2,1), and the USA (6,2,3). The results
show that: i) ARIMA models are reliable enough when new daily cases begin to stabilize;
ii) Italy, the USA, and Russia reached the peak of COVID-19 infections in mid-April,
mid-May, and late May, respectively; and iii) Russia and the USA will require much more
time than Italy to drop COVID-19 cases near zero. This may suggest the importance of
the application of quick and effective lockdown measures, which have been relatively
stricter in Italy. Therefore, even if the results should be interpreted with caution, ARIMA
models seem to be a good tool that can help the health authorities to monitor the diffusion
of the outbreak.

1. Introduction
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a severe acute respiratory syndrome that occurred
for the first time in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei Province in China, in December
2019. In late February, the virus was detected even in Europe, and from that moment on,
it has continuously spread across the world. As of 31 May, according to Worldometer’s
COVID-19 data, the pandemic affected 213 countries and territories, and two
conveyances, with more than 6,2 million confirmed cases and a death toll higher than
370,000 people. The main epicenters of the pandemic are mostly advanced countries, i.e.
Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Spain, the UK, and the USA. However, in the last
few weeks, other relatively poorer countries, such as India, Peru, and Turkey, are
progressively climbing the world rankings.
When an epidemic occurs, one crucial issue is determining its evolution and inflection
point. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to provide a short to medium-term forecast of
the spread of the COVID-19 disease, and its inflection point, in three of the most affected
countries worldwide, Italy, Russia, and the USA. The prediction will be estimated by

using an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, applied to the
number of new daily confirmed positive cases of COVID-19. The specific time frame for
each country will be chosen by considering, like departure point, the moment when daily
cases began to show signs of stabilization.
For the remainder, this paper is organized as follows. In section 2, I will introduce
ARIMA model and related literature. In section 3, I will present the data used to forecast
and discuss the empirical strategy. In section 4, I will discuss the results. In section 5, I
will provide some concluding considerations and possible policy implications.
2. Arima models and related literature
In the last few months, an increasing body of literature has attempted to forecast the
incidence and prevalence of the COVID-2019 pandemic by using different approaches,
such as the ARIMA (Benvenuto et al., 2020; Chakraborty and Ghosh, 2020;2 Ribeiro et
al., 20203, Singh et al., 2020), the exposed-identified-recovered (EIR) model (Xiong and
Yan, 2020), the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model (Wu et al., 2020),
the segmented Poisson model (Zhang et al., 2020), the SIDARTHE4 model (Giordano et
al., 2020), the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model (Nesteruk, 2020), the
SIR/death model (Anastassopoulou et al., 2020; Fanelli and Piazza, 2020), and
mathematical methods based on travel volume (Tuite et al., 2020).
The ARIMA model is clearly one of the most preferred because of its good properties. In
fact, it is quite easy to fit, manage, and its mathematical interpretation is easy and
immediate also for non-academics.
It was introduced for the first time, as the Box-Jenkins approach, by statisticians Box and
Jenkins in a highly influential seminal work published in 1970. It could be considered one
of the most used prediction models for epidemic time series (Rios et al., 2000; Li et al.,
2012; Zhang et al., 2014; Zheng et al., 2015), and it is frequently used with non-stationary
time series to capture the linear trend of an epidemic or disease. It allows the prediction
of a given time series by considering its own lags, i.e. the previous values of the time
series, and the lagged forecast errors.
Moreover, it is very flexible and can be easily adapted to any kind of data, considering
trend, cyclicity, seasonality, calendar variation, randomness disturbances like other
diseases, external or exogenous interventions, outliers, and other relevant real aspects of
time series (Pack, 1990; Barnett and Dobson, 2010).
Therefore, the ARIMA models allow in a simple way to investigate COVID-2019 trends,
which are currently of huge economic and social impact, by helping the health authority
to continuously monitor the epidemic and to better allocate the available resources.
In Table 1, I selected 19 studies on the prediction of the spread of various diseases by
using an ARIMA framework.

Specifically, the authors developed a hybrid ARIMA-Wavelet-based forecasting (WBF) model.
The authors also used cubist regression (CUBIST), random forest (RF), ridge regression (RIDGE), support
vector regression (SVR), and stacking-ensemble learning.

This model considered eight stages of infection: susceptible-infected-diagnosed-ailing-recognizedthreatened-healed-extinct.

3. Materials and method
The analysis is carried on the number of new daily confirmed positive cases of COVID19 in Italy, Russia, and the USA, collected by the data aggregator website named
Worldometer.5 As suggested by several authors (Box and Tiao, 1975; McCleary et al.,
1980; Box et al., 1994), a reasonable ARIMA model requires at least 40–50 observations.
Therefore, to meet this criterion, I considered a minimum of 53 and a maximum of 69
data points.
The specific investigated time window for each country was chosen by identifying the
period when daily cases began to stabilize, which can be approximately seen as the peak
of the epidemic (Figures 1, 2, and 3). Based on this, I chose the following timeframes:
Italy (February 22–April 14), USA (March 9–May 16), and Russia (March 22–May 22).
In particular, to forecast the COVID-19 outbreak spread in Italy, Russia, and the USA, I
used a nonseasonal ARIMA model. In fact, the autocorrelation function (ACF) and the
partial autocorrelation function (PACF) of the raw time series showed a lack of any
seasonal significative pattern.6
The nonseasonal ARIMA models are generally classified as “AR-I-MA (p, d, q)”, where:
i) p is the order of autoregressive terms (AR); ii) d is the order of nonseasonal differences
(I) required to make the time series stationary; and iii) q is the order of moving average
(MA). The optimal parameters for ARIMA models were chosen by considering the
following four sequential steps:7
i.

First, I applied the auto.arima() function, included in the “forecast package” of the
widely known R Project for Statistical Computing, developed by Hyndman and
Khandakar (2008). This algorithm allows to identify the best order of an ARIMA
process by considering a unit root test to identify the appropriate degree of
differencing,8 and the minimization of the corrected Akaike’s Information
Criterion (AICc)9 and the log-likelihood function (MLE) to identify the AR and
MA parameters;
Second, I evaluated the forecast accuracy by implementing the following four
accuracy measures: the mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage
error (MAPE), mean absolute scaled error (MASE), and root mean squared error

The data are available at the following URL: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/.
This hypothesis is also confirmed by the auto.arima() function, which will be introduced shortly.
7
The procedure combines Hyndman and Athanasopoulos (2018) suggestions, as reported in Sections 3.3,
3.4, and 8.7.
8
In this specific analysis, I applied the KPSS test developed by Kwiatkowski et al. (1992), which is the
default method implemented in the auto.arima() function. In fact, the application of the alternative tests, the
augmented Dickey-Fuller (1979) (ADF) test and Phillips-Perron (1988) (PP) test, does not change the
meaning of the final outcome.
9
The AICc is a bias-corrected version of the original Akaike information criterion (AIC), proposed by
Sugiura (1978) and Hurvich and Tsai (1989), which performs significantly better than the latter in both
small and moderate sample sizes, as in this case (Hurvich and Tsai, 1989).

(RMSE).10 These accuracy measures allow the validation of the models selected
through the auto.arima() algorithm.
iii. Third, I examined the autocorrelation function (ACF) and the partial
autocorrelation function (PACF) of the residuals from ARIMA models, to detect
the presence of significant spikes.
iv.
Finally, I verified the fundamental statistical assumptions, homoscedasticity, and
serial correlation.11 The first was controlled by using Engle’s Lagrange Multiplier
(1982) test for autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH), and the
former was detected by implementing the Ljung-Box’s (1978) test for serial
correlation.
The basic ARIMA forecasting estimated equation is the following [1]:
𝛥ŷ𝑡 = 𝜆1 𝛥𝑦𝑡−1 +. . +𝜆𝑝 𝛥𝑦𝑡−𝑝 + 𝜓1 ∆𝑒𝑡−1 +. . +𝜓𝑞 ∆𝑒𝑡−𝑞 + 𝑒𝑡

[1]

Where Δ means the degree of nonseasonal differences, ŷ is the time series that will be
predicted at time t, p is the lag order of AR, λ is the coefficient for each parameter p, q is
the lag order of MA, ψ is the coefficient of each parameter q, and 𝑒𝑡 means the residuals
of errors in time t.

April 14, 2020.

The mathematical formulas for each measure of forecast accuracy are provided in Table A1 in Appendix
A.

The normality assumption of the residuals is not generally necessary (Hyndman and Athanasopoulos,
2018, 3.3).

4. Results and discussion
The minimization of AICc and forecast error measurements suggests the following
parameters (Table 2): Italy (4, 2, 4), Russia (1, 2, 1), and USA (6, 2, 3).12 In the case of
Italy, ARIMA (4, 2, 4) is the absolute best according to all criteria. For Russia, MAE,
MASE, and RMSE suggest ARIMA (1, 2, 2); however, the AICc and MAPE are
definitely lower for the ARIMA (1, 2, 1). For the USA, ARIMA (6, 2, 3) performs far
better in all measures of forecast accuracy, but the AICc, which is slightly higher than the
ARIMA (2, 2, 4). I chose the former, also based on the residuals auto-correlation
structure.
Moreover, MAPE and MASE may give other useful information on the fitting accuracy.
In particular, MAPE – which is the most widely used error measure (Goodwin and
Lawton, 1999; Ren and Glasure, 2009; Moreno et al., 2013; Kim H. and Kim S., 2016) –
indicates an overall forecast accuracy (100-MAPE) of 86.96% for Italy, 88.61% for
Russia, and 90.41% for USA.13 According to Lewis (1982, p. 40), since the values of
MAPE are close to 10, the forecasting is definitely good, especially in the case of the
USA that shows a value lower than this “limit” (9.59).14 MASE, which was more recently
proposed by Hyndman and Koehler (2008), seems to be more versatile and reliable. Since
it is always lower than 1 for all three countries, it indicates that the computed forecast
performs definitely better than in-sample one-step forecasts from the naïve method.
The ACF and PACF correlogram plots of the residuals for Italy (Figure C1) and the USA
(Figure C3) show a white noise process; in fact, any of the associated spikes go beyond
the 95% confidence intervals. Meanwhile, the ACF and PACF correlogram plots for
Russia exhibit a significant spike at lag 10, which reaches the 95% confidence limits
(Figure C2). Even if it should not be a particular matter of concern, I further examine the
ARIMA model process by applying the Ljung-Box’s test for autocorrelation and Engle’s
LM test for the Arch effect.
The Ljung-Box’s test shows that the null hypothesis of serial independence of the
residuals can be accepted at each distinct lag for all three countries (Table B2). In the
same way, Engle’s LM test for the ARCH effect shows that the null hypothesis of no
autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity can always be accepted (Table B3).
Therefore, the three ARIMA models show a very good fit.
In Figures 4, 5, and 6, I present the forecast results for 30 days in each country. From
April 15 to May 14, Italy’s coronavirus infection – that is the “benchmark” of the analysis
– showed a clear sinusoidal and declining trend (Figure 4). The new daily COVID-19

12

The estimated parameters are reported in Table B1 in Appendix B.
It is necessary to stress that the MAPE has also been affected by some criticalities. In fact, it put greater
penalty on negative errors than on positive errors and may be very problematic with time points close to
zero (Hyndman and Athanasopoulos, 2018, 3.4). However, if the first is mostly out of control, the second
aspect is not worry about because all time points considered in the analysis are far from zero.
14
Specifically, according to the interpretation of Lewis, the models for Italy and Russia are good
forecasting, and that for the USA can be considered a highly accurate forecasting.

cases should drop near zero in mid-June 2020, with an estimated epidemic final size of
about 246,627 people.
The outcomes for Russia (Figure 5) and the USA (Figure 6) are also characterized by a
declining trend, indicating that they have probably already reached the peak of the
COVID-19 outbreak. The major difference between the Italian and Russia/USA cases is
that the slowdown in new COVID-19 cases seems to require more time for the latter.
Specifically, Russia will reach zero local COVID-19 cases in late August 2020, while in
the USA, the new COVID-19 cases will drop to zero between the end of September 2020
and the start of October 2020.
This may confirm the importance of the rapid implementation of strict lockdown
measures to contain the spread of the epidemic. In fact, Italy has been under one of the
world’s strictest lockdown for about 2 months, while Russia and USA have applied easier
lockdown restrictions
To control the reliability of my approach, in Tables 3 and 4, I compared the predicted and
latest actual daily cases in Italy and the USA, respectively. The results show that in Italy,
the overall predicted new daily cases are overestimated, and this deviation grows over
time. In the first 10 days of the forecast, the percentage deviation was about 7.27, and it
increased until the 30th day of forecast, when it stabilized around 22%. On May 26, i.e.
after 42 days, the overall deviation between the predicted and actual values was equal to
15,326 cases, with a change of 22.52 percentage point.
After 10 days, the MAPE was equal to 13.75% and it reached 33.32% at the end of the
forecast (after 42 days). Therefore, for Italy, ARIMA performs better at predicting the
final size rather than the daily cases.
Regarding the USA, Table 4 shows that the overall predicted cases are a little bit
underestimated. In particular, after 5 days, the percentage deviation was about -5.86%
and it decreased distinctively after 19 days, reaching 4.11%. After 19 days, the overall
deviation between predicted and actual values was equal to 17,128 cases. MAPE, which
was equal to 5.73% after 5 days, slightly increased to 5.91% on June 4. Therefore,
ARIMA models seem to perform better for the USA than Italy.
About Russia, Table 4 shows that, after 5 days, the percentage deviation was about 2.82%, and it increased to -5.82% after 11 days. MAPE was equal 3.51% after 5 days,
and 6.06% after 11 days.
These values can be considered reasonable errors, all things considered.15 In fact, if we
look at Figures 7 and 8, we see that in Italy and the USA, the predicted and actual daily
cases follow a very similar and comparable trend. About Russia, the trends seem to differ
a little after 5 days (Figure 9). This could indicate that the epidemic is still in the
stabilisation phase.
Even if the analytical approach seems to work well enough, these results are a rough guide
only and should be additionally verified and updated.
15

In fact, since ARIMA is based on historical observations, the error value in the future is equal to the
accumulated random error, one-by-one. Therefore, confidence intervals and errors typically increase as the
forecast horizon increases (Hyndman and Athanasopoulos, 2018, 3.5 and 8.8).

Conclusion
To the best of my knowledge, this is the first study to implement an ARIMA model to
predict the incidence of COVID-19 in the short/mid-term in Italy, Russia, and the USA.
ARIMA models can be viewed as an easy and immediate tool to program health
monitoring systems and to better allocate the available resources. In particular, it can help
public health decision makers to plan the number of beds needed for moderate and critical
care, and to better allocate and manage medical staff, healthcare devices, and healthcare
facilities.
Results suggest that Italy, the USA, and Russia reached the peak of COVID-19 infections
in mid-April, mid-May, and late May, respectively. In particular, the USA and Russia
will require a considerable length of time to drop near zero daily cases, if compared to
Italy. This could be because Italy imposed stricter nationwide lockdown measures such
as severe traffic and travel restrictions, bans on gatherings, and closure of commercial
activities – to mitigate the spread of the outbreak. Moreover, the comparison between the
predicted and more recent actual values showed that forecasts are reliable enough, even
in the mid-term, especially for Italy and the USA.
Therefore, ARIMA may be considered a good model for short to medium-term
forecasting, but the results should be interpreted with thriftiness. Finally, further useful
and more precise forecasting may be provided by continuously updating these data,
adding interventions and other real aspects, and applying the model to other countries
and/or regions.
