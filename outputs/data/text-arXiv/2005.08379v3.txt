Abstract
The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly altered our lifestyles as we resort to minimize the spread
through preventive measures such as social distancing and
quarantine. An increasingly worrying aspect is the gap between the exponential disease spread and the delay in adopting preventive measures. This gap is attributed to the lack
of awareness about the disease and its preventive measures.
Nowadays, social media platforms (i.e., Twitter) are frequently used to create awareness about major events, including COVID-19. In this paper, we use Twitter to characterize
public awareness regarding COVID-19 by analyzing the information flow in the most affected countries. Towards that,
we collect more than 46K trends and 622 Million tweets from
the top twenty most affected countries to examine 1) the temporal evolution of COVID-19 related trends, 2) the volume
of tweets and recurring topics in those trends, and 3) the user
sentiment towards preventive measures. Our results show that
countries with a lower pandemic spread generated a higher
volume of trends and tweets to expedite the information flow
and contribute to public awareness. We also observed that in
those countries, the COVID-19 related trends were generated
before the sharp increase in the number of cases, indicating a
preemptive attempt to notify users about the potential threat.
Finally, we noticed that in countries with a lower spread, users
had a positive sentiment towards COVID-19 preventive measures. Our measurements and analysis show that effective social media usage can influence public behavior, which can be
leveraged to better combat future pandemics.

Introduction and Related Work

The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has spread across
the world with over four million reported cases to date. Currently, no vaccine is available for the SARS-CoV-2 strain,
and therefore the optimal way to curtail its spread is to avoid
physical contact with COVID-19 carriers. To minimize the
physical contact, people are advised to practice social distancing, stay at home, and in the worst case, undergo a lockdown (Broniec et al. 2020; Inoue and Todo 2020). Unfortunately, despite these guidelines, COVID-19 has spread faster
than the adoption of preventive measures. The gap between
the spread and the adoption of preventive measures is due
to 1) limited awareness about the disease and its spread, 2)

the nature of the disease and its latent symptoms (Robson
2020), and 3) delayed response in taking corrective measures by governments and the general public. Particularly,
the aspect of public awareness largely depends on the information spread through the mainstream media and the social
media (Wells et al. 2020; Le, Shafiq, and Srinivasan 2017;
Brena et al. 2019). Between these two axes of communication, social media platforms (i.e., Twitter and Facebook) are
highly useful in propagating timely information regarding a
major event (Bin Tareaf et al. 2018). Therefore, it is intuitive
to assume that social media platforms contain information
footprints that can be leveraged to characterize the response
of various communities to the COVID-19 pandemic. To that
end, this study uses Twitter data to analyze various attributes
of information exchange in order to model preparations of
various countries for the COVID-19 pandemic.
For this study, we draw inspiration from prior related
works that have demonstrated the usefulness of Twitter in
characterizing the user behavior in major events. For instance, (An et al. 2018) showed that during the Ebola pandemic, Twitter users actively discussed the risk potential and
the spread rate. Similarly (Fischer-Preßler, Schwemmer, and
Fischbach 2019) and (Keymanesh et al. 2019) showed that
Twitter is useful in monitoring the social efficacy and collective understanding of masses during critical global events.
We follow a similar methodology and use Twitter to study
the response of various countries to the COVID-19 pandemic. We collect trends and tweets from the top 20 most
affected countries by COVID-19 (as of April 19, 2020) and
contextualize the information to study their preparatory response. More precisely, using our dataset, we explore the
following key questions.
1. Are there variations in the response of different countries
to the COVID-19 pandemic that are reflected in rends and
tweets from that country?
2. Are there indications to support that awareness through
Twitter was useful in influencing the pandemic spread?
In pursuit of these questions, we develop a data collection system to collect more than 5,000 Twitter trends and
over 622 Million tweets from the top 20 most affected countries by COVID-19 (as of April 19, 2020). For each country, we monitor the temporal patterns of COVID-19 trends
and the volume of tweets in those trends to study the coun-

try’s response to the pandemic. We perform topic modeling and sentiment analysis on tweets to analyze the user response towards preventive measures such as social distancing, quarantine, and lockdown. Our dataset reveals meaningful insights, including a correlation between frequent trending on COVID-19 and effective pandemic management. To
illustrate this observation, we provide a comparative case
study of six countries (USA, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Austria,
and Belgium), which indicates that countries with a lower
pandemic spread usually generated more tweets and trends
about COVID-19 and its preventive measures. We believe
that the key takeaways of our work highlight the importance
of social media in influencing public interactions that can be
useful in combating future pandemics.
Contributions and Roadmap. We take a systematic approach towards analyzing the temporal evolution of Twitter
trends in 20 most affected countries by COVID-19. Our data
collection, methodology, and results are summarized below
as the key contributions.
1 We developed a data collection system using which we
collect more than 48K trends and over 622 Million tweets
from December 15, 2019, to April 5, 2020, for the top 20
countries affected by COVID-19. 2 For each country, we
identify the COVID-19 related trends among all trends and
the volume of tweets in those trends. We pair that information with key indicators in the country’s COVID-19 timeline to study their preparatory status. 3 We present a case
study of six countries (United States, Italy, Spain, Sweden,
Austria, and Belgium) to a) show the variation in response
of each country to the pandemic, and b) showcase observations that suggest that frequent and timely information propagation about preventive measures correlated with a lower
pandemic spread. Notably, our results show that on average,
Sweden, Austria, and Belgium generated more trends and
tweets about COVID-19 and its preventive measures than
the United States, Italy, and Spain. 4 Additionally, we apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract the most
prevalent topics in the COVID-19 tweets and the user sentiment towards those topics. We observed that countries with
a lower pandemic spread frequently used terms related to the

preventive measures such as “social distancing.”

Data Collection and Methodology

This section describes our data collection and methodology.
We started data collection on April 19, 2020, by selecting the
top 20 most affected countries on that date. For each country, we collected all their Twitter trends from December 15,
2019, to April 5, 2020, . Figure 1 shows our data collection
system, and below, we briefly discuss some key challenges
that we encountered during the process.
Collecting Historical Trends. A trend on Twitter generally indicates a commonly discussed topic by users in a
location (Tulasi et al. 2019). Logically, on a specific date,
if all trends of a location are collected, we can estimate
the commonly discussed topics in that region. As such, the
first challenge in our study was to obtain all the historical
trends of the selected countries. Twitter API does not provide historical trends for countries, and therefore, we relied on third-party services for trend collection. We used
an online service called Trendogate that maintains historical Twitter trends for all countries (TrendoGateCommunity
2020). We developed a crawler that periodically scraped
trends of each country and stored them in our “Data Storage
and Scheduler” platform. For validation, we cross-examined
those trends with an Internet archive service called “Wayback Machine” (ArchiveCommunity 2020). The “Wayback
Machine” creates snapshots of a vast majority of the Internet webpages every day. Currently, the archive contains
historical data of more than 330 billion web pages. After
cross-examining and validating data, our ‘Data Storage and
Scheduler” platform created a list of Trends for eighty-five
workers that we deployed for tweet collection (Figure 1).
Collecting Tweets from Trends. We developed twitter
crawlers and deployed them on eighty-five workers for concurrent data collection. We could not use the Twitter API
since the API only provides the recent tweets from a trend.
To overcome this limitation, we developed web crawlers

Figure 2: Distribution of trends shown as a violin plot for each country in our dataset. On average, India had the most trends,
followed by Italy, Germany, and Turkey. In contrast, Portugal, Israel, and Sweden had the least number of trends. Violinplot
shows the smooth distribution of data as a result. The result of the smoothing function can exceed the maximum and minimum
value. As such, this should not be confused with the negative number of trends for the countries shown in the figure.

that utilized Twitter’s scroll loader functionality to collect
tweets. Each web crawler generated a search query for
a trend in a country and iterated over the scroll loader
to scrape tweets. For this purpose, we sought help from
prior works that have utilized Twitter’s scroll loader functionality for data collection (Pratikakis 2018; Mottl 2019;
Valkanas, Saravanou, and Gunopulos 2014). We also noticed that Twitter applies rate-limiting on IP addresses that
generate iterative search queries. Keeping in view the desirable data volume, we provisioned 85 workers and replicated
our crawler on these workers. Each worker was represented
by a unique IP Address over the Internet. Upon receiving
a rate-limiting error, each worker applied a linear backoff
time. Figure 1 provides the data collection system workflow.

Methodology and Preliminary Results

Table 1 and Figure 2 show preliminary results obtained after data collection. At the time of the writing of this paper,
we were able to collect trends and tweets from December
15, 2019, to April 5, 2020. Therefore, the results reported in
this study are confined within this timeline. Figure 2, reports
the distribution of daily trends obtained from each country
as violin plots. For each plot, the white dot in the middle is
the median value of the total number of trends, the grey bar
is the interquartile range, and the outer shape is the kernel
density estimation showing the data distribution (details of
kernel density function in subsection 5.1). Figure 2 shows
that 1) the number of daily trends from each country varied
from as low as one trend in Israel to 47 trends in Italy, and
2) the average number of daily trends was 21. Therefore,

we expected variations in the duration of data collection for
each country, and our “Data Storage and Scheduler” platform applied load-balancing to maximize the system utility.
Trend Collection. In Table 1, we report the preliminary results in which we collect statistics about the first case and
the first death from (COVID-19 2020). For each country,
we record the total number of 1) all trends, 2) all tweets,
3) trends related to COVID-19, 4) tweets related to COVID19, 5) the number of trends and tweets before the first reported case, and 6) the number of trends and tweets before
the first reported the death. All countries are sorted in the
descending order as of April 19, 2020 (when we began our
study), where the United States had the highest number of
COVID-19 cases followed by Spain and Italy, respectively.
To obtain the COVID-19 related trends and tweets, we curated a list of COVID-19 terms from the Yale Medicine
Glossary (Katella 2020) and Texas Medical Center (Pierce
and Center 2020). For each country, we matched the trend
string and the tweet text with the set of COVID-19 terms to
prepare Table 1. For countries other than the United States,
Canada, and the United Kingdom, we also translated the
COVID-19 terms in their native language to maximize precision and obtain complete information about tweets and
trends. Overall, we collected 48,279 trends from 20 countries with 2,558 (5.30%) trends related to COVID-19. The
highest number of total trends (3,746) were generated in India, and only 85 among them were related to COVID-19.
The lowest number of trends (827) were generated from
Portugal, and 78 among them were related to COVID-19.
Switzerland created the highest number of COVID-19 trends
(272). In contrast, France generated the minimum amount of
COVID-19 trends (34). Turkey generated the highest number of COVID-19 trends before the first case and the first
death (139 and 154, respectively).
Tweet Collection. From all these trends, we collected
more than 622 Million tweets with 42 Million tweets related to COVID-19. Ireland generated the highest number
of tweets (≈44.3 Million) with ≈2.4 Million tweets related to COVID-19. Portugal generated the lowest number
of tweets (≈8 Million) with ≈82K tweets related to COVID19. Switzerland generated the highest number of COVID-19
tweets (≈ 7.3 Million among ≈35 Million 20.70% tweets),
while Brazil generated the lowest number of COVID-19
tweets (≈218K among ≈26 Million tweets). Ireland generated the highest number of tweets before the first reported
case (≈1 Million), and the highest number of tweets before
the first death (≈ 1.1 Million). It is noteworthy in our data
that no country, among the top three most affected, generated the maximum number of trends or tweets.
Limitations. During data collection, we could not collect
trends from China due to a state-backed ban on Twitter. Another limitation of our work is that Trendogate reported limited visibility into Iran. As a result, we could collect trends
from Iran. We exclude these countries from our study, and
since they were among the top 20 countries, we omitted
them and added Ireland and India that were on 21st and 22nd
positions at the time of this study. Despite these limitations,
our dataset covers a wide range of countries that can sufficiently provide results required for our analysis.

Experiments and Results

We conduct three experiments to analyze the response of
each country to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the first experiment, we analyze the temporal behavior of COVID-19
related trends and tweets to study the patterns in the information spread. We present a case study of six countries to highlight the variation in response, characterized by the number
of trends and the tweet volume in those trends. In the second
and third experiments, we perform topic modeling and sentiment analysis to study the commonly discussed COVID-19
topics and the user sentiment in those discussions.

3.1

Temporal Analysis

For temporal analysis, we specify a timeline for each country where we observe the total number of trends and tweets
generated every day. Our timeline starts from December 21,
2019, to April 5, 2020. We exclude trends and tweets before December 21 since we did not observe any significant
COVID-19 related data to report. We made the following
key observations in the temporal analysis.
1 Overall, as the number of cases, increased in a country, the number of tweets and trends increased accordingly.
However, the relationship was not always linear. In most
cases, the number of tweets decreased while the number
of cases kept growing. 2 A few countries (i.e., Sweden
and Austria) preemptively responded to the pandemic by actively discussing COVID-19 before the increase in the number of cases. 3 In some countries (i.e., Austria), we observed a constant recurrence in tweets and trends, indicating
consistency of interest on the subject. To take a deeper look
at these observations, we present a case study below.
Case Study. For the case study, we selected the top three
countries from Table 1, namely the United States, Spain, and
Italy, and three other countries at random, namely Sweden,
Austria, and Belgium. In the United States, the first COVID19 case was reported on January 21, 2020, and by April 5,
2020, the number of cases exceeded 300K. Similarly, for
Spain and Italy, the first case was reported on January 31,
and the total number of cases increased to 132K and 18K

(b) Total number of COVID-19 related tweets among all trends. Overall, the results are consistent with Figure 3(b), showing that Sweden,
Austria, and Belgium generated more COVID-19 tweets compared to the other three countries.

red color while Sweden, Austria, and Belgium are annotated in blue color. Overall, the number of trends and the volume of
tweets in the United States, Spain, and Italy are considerably low compared to the other three countries.
by April 5, respectively. For Sweden, Austria, and Belgium,
the first case was reported on February 4, February 24, and
February 4, while the total cases increased to 6K, 12K, and
100K by April 5, respectively. For simplicity of analysis, we
divide these countries into two sets where the set S1 consists
of the United States, Spain, and Italy, and the set S2 consists
of Sweden, Austria, and Belgium. Note that 1) all the first
cases in S1 were reported earlier than the first cases reported
in S2 , and 2) by April 05, the total number of cases in S1
were much higher than the total number of cases in S2 .
We analyzed the temporal behavior of Twitter trends in
S1 and S2 . For both sets, we apply algorithm 1 to obtain the
1) the timeline of tweets in COVID-19 related trends, and
2) the total number of tweets about COVID-19. We separate tweets into two categories because the text in a tweet
may or may not be associated with a COVID-19 trend. To
understand this phenomenon, assume that an ongoing trend
in a country is #COVID–19. A user in that country tweets,

“Today, we have reported ten new cases of #COVID–19.”
This tweet will appear in the #COVID–19 trend and the
trend will appear in our list of terms related to COVID-19.
In contrast, if an ongoing trend in a country is #FootballMatch and a user tweets “#FootballMatch has been canceled
due to coronavirus,” then the tweet will not appear in the
COVID-19 related trends. However, the tweet will match
in our list of terms related to COVID-19. The first example shows that COVID-19 is an actively discussed topic in
a country since it appears among trends. If we sample all
tweets related to COVID-19 related trends, we can estimate
the significance of the topic in the country. However, this
method may not capture complete information about tweets
related to COVID-19, as demonstrated in the second example. Therefore, apart from acquiring a holistic view through
COVID-19 trends, we also construct a complete picture by
collecting all COVID-19 tweets from all trends, irrespective
of the trend nature. The second method allows us to pre-

cisely determine the number of times the COVID-19 was
discussed by people in a country. We use algorithm 1 to
extract this information. We report our results in Figure 3
where Figure 3(a) shows the total number of tweets related
to COVID-19 trends and Figure 3(b) shows the total number
of COVID-19 tweets among all trends. The total number of
tweets in both figures also include the number of retweets.
Key Takeaways. Our results show that countries in S2 generated COVID-19 related tweets and trends before countries
in S1 , indicating a preemptive attempt to cause pandemic
awareness. In the entire evaluation timeline, all countries in
S2 generated more COVID-19 tweets than countries in S1 .
We also observed spikes in Figure 3, showcasing a surge in
the number of tweets and trends. In all noticeable spikes, S2
clearly dominated S1 , indicating a higher user engagement
towards COVID-19. Among all countries, Switzerland generated the highest number of COVID-19 tweets (≈7.3 Million) and the highest number of COVID-19 trends (272). The
inner plot in Figure 3(a) shows that number of daily trends in
S2 were considerably higher than S1 . Notably, in Belgium,
15 COVID-19 trends were generated on March 19, 2020.
These results show that countries in S2 effectively utilized
Twitter to propagate information among users and prepare
them for the pandemic.

Topic Modeling

In our second experiment, we take a closer look at the textual
information in the tweet corpus to make useful inferences
about prevalent topics in those tweets. To motivate a common case, we limit our analysis to S1 and S1 , and retrieve
their tweet corpus from algorithm 1.
To study prevalent topics among COVID-19 tweets, we
combined those tweets in a single text corpus for each country. We then tokenized the text corpus, removed the stop
words, and calculated the frequency count over the resulting

Table 2: Top 10 most common words in the text corpus of
each country. Note that the three most common words in
Sweden are Social, Distancing, and Coronavirus.

text. Finally, we assigned weights to all the topics and sorted
them in descending order. In Figure 4, we show word clouds
for each country, providing an intuitive overview of the most
commonly used terms in COVID-19 tweets. Figure 4 shows
that generally, “coronavirus” was the most common term
across all countries. Noticeably, in Sweden and Austria, “social,” “distancing”, “quarantine,” “lockdown,” “stay,” and
“home” were the more dominant compared to other countries. Since it is possible that the two terms “social” and
“distancing” may appear in different contexts across tweets,
therefore we performed the same experiment while incorporating bigrams model. The bigram model approximates
the probability of a word by conditioning over a preceding
word. As such, if “social” and “distancing” are collocated,
then they would naturally appear in the model. We report

the results of the bigram model in Figure 6. Our results confirmed that “social distancing” and “stay home” were indeed
dominant terms in Sweden and Austria.
Additionally, in Table 2, we report the ten most common
terms that appeared in our topic modeling. Table 2 shows
that the trending topics significantly varied in each country.
The common term among all countries was “Coronavirus,”
followed by “Covid19.” Moreover, in all countries except
Sweden, “Coronavirus” was the most common term. In Sweden, the top two terms were “Social” and “Distancing,” indicating that the Twitter users in Sweden significantly emphasized on the preventive measures. Combined, the number of
COVID-19 topics in S2 were greater than S1 . Although, considering the total number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in
S1 , we expected the outcome to be the opposite.

Sentiment Analysis

In our third experiment, we analyze the user sentiments
towards the COVID-19 related preventive measures. Towards that, first, we isolated tweets containing terms “social
distancing,” “quarantine,” and “lockdown.” We distributed
those tweets in three separate classes. Additionally, we also
incorporated terms that closely resembled a specified class.
For instance, “curfew” closely relates to the class “lockdown,” while “self isolation” relates to the class “quarantine.” We manually annotated such similar terms and incorporated them into the corresponding classes.

For sentiment analysis, we used the “TextBlob” library in
Python that provides various useful language processing operations, including speech tagging, text tokenization, sentiment analysis, and sentiment classification. The “TextBlob”
library assigns a score in the range of -1 to 1 to each tweet in
the class. We eliminated tweets with a neutral score of “0”
to focus purely on tweets with a positive or negative sentiment. Additionally, we applied the kernel density function
to aggregate tweets with the same sentiment score and observed the distribution shape of each class. We report our results in Figure 5. Our results show that for social distancing
and quarantine; generally, the sentiment across all countries
was within the same margin. For social distancing, almost
all countries had a close to neutral sentiment, as indicated
by a spike around 0.1 Figure 5(a). However, we also observed a small spike towards the positive sentiment in Belgium and Sweden. Similarly, for the quarantine class, we
noticed a spike of around 0.3 for all countries, indicating a
more positive response. For the lockdown class, we observed
a relatively higher sentiment variation. In Italy, the sentiment was distributed towards the negative side, with a spike
around -0.1 Figure 5(c). However, in Austria and Belgium,
the sentiment was allocated towards the positive side with
peaks around 0.9. In summary, our data show that the general response to social distancing and quarantine was similar
across all countries. However, for lockdown, we observed a
variation in response with Italy’s inclination towards a nega-

tive sentiment. In summary, the general sentiment on social
distancing and quarantine, across all countries, converged to
a similar score in the density distribution. This observation
reflects a sense of uniformity in expression for all countries.
However, for lockdown, the variation in score indicates a
divergence in expression towards it. This could be a result
of societal pressures operating in those countries which we
could not capture in our dataset. Perhaps a more precise coupling of sentiment with the increasing number of cases will
provide reasoning for the sentiment divergence. In the future, we plan to explore this direction and get more meaningful results to support the observation.

Discussion and Conclusion

As discussed in §1, social media platforms can be useful in
characterizing public opinion in a geographical locality. Additionally, these platforms can also be used to monitor the
effects of information propagation by pairing the information flow with a desirable outcome. In this paper, we contextualize this methodology to study the relationship between
information dissemination the COVID-19 pandemic spread.
Our model puts “lower spread” as the desirable outcome
and “high volumes of trends and tweets” as the indicators of
effective information dissemination. To that end, we developed a large-scale data collection system to collect historical
tweets from the top 20 most affected countries by COVID19. We perform measurements and modelling on our data to
study various data attributes including the temporal evolution of trends, the most recurring COVID-19 related topics,
and the user sentiment towards preventive measures.
Our results show that countries with a lower pandemic
spread mostly generated a higher volume of COVID-19 related trends and tweets (Table 1, Figure 3). A closer look at
the nature of tweets further revealed that the countries with
a lower pandemic spread emphasized more on the COVID19 preventive measures (Figure 4, Figure 6). Moreover, we
also noticed a variation in sentiment towards the lockdown
policy that was implemented to control the spread.
In addition to making standalone contributions through a
novel dataset and useful observations, our study also provides meaningful answers to the questions raised in §1. First,
we indeed noticed variations in the response of different
countries to the COVID-19 pandemic as shown by the 1)
volume of trends and tweets and their timeline, 2) recurring
topics discussed in those tweets, and 3) sentiments towards
preventive measures. Second, we also observed indications
to support that awareness through Twitter contributed in influencing the pandemic spread. For that purpose, we outlined a case study to showcase that users in the highly affected countries displayed lower Twitter engagement compared to the lesser affected countries. Please note that this
is not a conclusive statement to suggest that Twitter usage
was the dominant factor in influencing the pandemic spread.
However, our data and analysis indicate that Twitter can be
useful for this purpose, and therefore noteworthy.
Future Work. At the time of conducting this study, we did
not find a study that precisely analyzed the relationship between Twitter and the spread of COVID-19. However, our

methodology is inspired from some notable studies that examined the usefulness of Twitter in characterizing the user
behavior at scale. We have mentioned them in §1. Concurrent to work, we have seen a study that analyzed the emergence of Sinophobic behavior due to COVID-19 (Schild et
al. 2020). However, our work investigates an entirely different relationship between Twitter and COVID-19.
Finally, we believe that our dataset has useful information
beyond what is presented in this paper. Keeping it in view,
as well as the urgency to extend research on this topic, we
will soon open-source our dataset to foster future work.

Kernel Density Estimation

Kernel Density Estimator (KDE) is a renowned probability density function that is used to solve the data smoothing problem for a finite dataset. Typically, this is done by
graphing the density of the dataset in its domain. The formal
definition of KDE is given by the following function.


n
Xi − x
1 X
K
pbn (x) =
nh i=1
h
In the function above, K(x) is the smooth and symmetric
kernel function (Gaussian in our case), and h (where h >
0) is the smoothing bandwidth. KDE calculates summation,
after each data-point is smoothed into small density bumps.

Bigram Model Results

In Figure 6, we have generated the Bigram Model for countries discussed in our case studies. A Bigram Model looks
one word into the past and predicts the next word. Building
onto this, the Figure 6 shows that which two words, together,
are most likely to appear for each country in S1 and S2 .
Referring to Figure 6, we observe word clouds for S1 and
S2 after bigram analysis. The most common term in Sweden
and Austria was ”social distancing”, and similarly, ”corona
virus” was dominant in Belgium. In the USA, ”billion dollar” was dominant along with ”homeschooling year”, in
Spain’s word cloud, the most common term was ”self quarantined”, and in Italy, the common term was ”world news”.
