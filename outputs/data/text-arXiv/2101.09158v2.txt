Abstract
In this paper, we present a new mathematical model for pandemics that have asymptomatic
patients, called SUTRA. The acronym stands for Susceptible, Undetected, Tested (positive),
and Removed Approach. There are several novel features of our proposed model. First, whereas
previous papers have divided the patient population into Asymptomatic and Infected, we have
explicitly accounted for the fact that, due to contact tracing and other such protocols, some
fraction of asymptomatic patients could also be detected; in addition, there would also be large
numbers of undetected asymptomatic patients. Second, we have explicitly taken into account
the spatial spread of a pandemic over time, through a parameter called “reach.” Third, we
present numerically stable methods for estimating the parameters in our model.
We have applied our model to predict the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic in several
countries. Where data on the number of recovered patients is available, we predict the number of
active cases as a function of time. Where recovery data is not available, we predict the number
of daily new cases. We present our predictions for three countries with quite distinct types
of disease progression, namely: (i) India which has had a smooth rise followed by an equally
smooth fall-off in the number of active cases, (ii) Italy, which has witnessed multiple peaks in
the number of active cases, and has also witnessed multiple “phases” of the pandemic, and (iii)
the USA which has erratic recovery data. In all cases, the predictions closely match the actually
observed outcomes.

Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has by now led to more than ninety
million cases and nearly two million deaths worldwide [31]. By way of comparison, the infuenza
epidemic of 1957 led to 20,000 deaths in the UK and 80,000 deaths in the USA, while the 1968
influenza pandemic led to 30,000 deaths in the UK and 100,000 deaths in the USA. In contrast,
the COVID-19 pandemic has already led to nearly 400,000 deaths in the USA and 85,000 deaths in
the UK [12], and the end is nowhere in sight. Even allowing for the increase in population during
the past half-century, it is evident that the current pandemic is the most deadly since the “Spanish
flu” of 1918–19. Among large economies, the USA, UK, Italy, and Spain, have all registered more
than 1,100 deaths per million population [31]. In these countries, the pandemic appeared to have
abated, only to return with a “second wave” and sometimes even a “third wave” [22], each wave

being more severe than its predecessor, both in terms of the number of daily new cases and deaths.
In comparison, India has escaped relatively unscathed, with just around one hundred deaths per
million population to date [31], and thus far no second wave of infections. However, because of its
large population, in absolute numbers India has registered the second largest number of cases after
the USA, and the third highest number of deaths after the USA and Brazil [31].
In order to cope with a health crisis of this magnitude, governments everywhere would require
accurate projections of the progress of the pandemic, both in space and over time. Over the past
century or so, various epidemiological models have been developed, as reviewed in the next section.
All of these models are based on the premise that the disease spreads when an infected person
comes into contact with a susceptible person. However, a distinctive feature of the COVID-19
disease is the presence of a huge number of asymptomatic persons, who are infected and thus
capable of infecting others, but are not explicitly identified by the health authorities owing to their
not showing any symptoms. The contributions of the present paper are: (i) the formulation of
a mathematical model for the spatial and temporal evolution of a pandemic with asymptomatic
patients, (ii) a numerically robust method for estimating the parameters in the model, and (iii)
validation of the proposed methodology by applying it to several countries around the world with
highly disparate trajectories for the number of cases.

Literature Review
There is a vast literature on the modelling of epidemics. A comprehensive review [11] published in
the year 2000 already had 200+ references. Book length treatments are available in [2, 8, 14, 6, 20].
According to [21], there are no fewer than thirty six epidemiological models. Historically the first
epidemiological model is the SIR model introduced in [15], given by
Ṡ = −βIS, I˙ = βIS − γI, Ṙ = γI,

(1)

where S, I, R denote respectively the fraction of the populatioon that is Susceptible, Infected, and
Removed.1 Note that Ṡ + I˙ + Ṙ = 0. Consequently S(t) + I(t) = R(t) = 1 for all t. Therefore we
can ignore anyone of the three equations and focus only on the other two. Most authors ignore R
and study
Ṡ = −βIS, I˙ = βIS − γI,
(2)
where β, γ > 0 are parameters of the disease under study. Specifically, β is called the “contact
parameter” and represents the likelihood that contact between a susceptible individual and an
infected individual leads to a fresh infection, while γ denotes the rate at which infected persons
recover. In principle, there should be a time delay in the above equations (2), in the form
˙ = βI(t − ∆)S(t − ∆) − γI(t),
Ṡ(t) = −βI(t − ∆)S(t − ∆), I(t)
where ∆ denotes the incubation period of the virus in an infected person. However, it is shown in
[2, 14] that, other than complicating the solution of the equations, the time delay does not change
the qualitative behavior of the solutions. Therefore practically all researchers do not introduce such
a delay, and neither do we.
The ratio R0 := β/γ is called the basic reproduction ratio. Its significance lies in the fact
that if R0 S(0) < 1, then I˙ < 0 for all times, and the pandemic does not develop. If R0 S(0) > 1,
then I(t) increases initially and reaches its maximum value when I˙ = 0, or S = γ/β = 1/R0 . Since
1

Some authors use the letter R to denote “Recovered,” which presupposes that no one dies. It is more realistic to
use the phrase “Removed” that includes both those who recover and those who die.

2

S + I + R = 1 at all times, it follows that when I reaches its maximum, the value of I + R equals
1 − 1/R0 = (R0 − 1)/R0 , a number often referred to as the herd immunity level.
While the above SIR model is a good starting point, a more realistic model consists of an
intermediate group called E (for Exposed) in-between S and I. The equations for the SEIR model,
which are studied in [18, 16] are as follows:
Ṡ = −βIS, Ė = βIS − γE, I˙ = γE − δI, Ṙ = δI.

(3)

The above equations mean that when a person from group S comes into contact with a person
from group I, then the former becomes “exposed” at a rate of β. Note that the transition is out
of group S but to group E, and not to group I. The persons in group E become infected at a rate
γ, and move to group I. Finally, people in group I move to group R at a rate of δ. Note that the
transition of people is strictly sequential in the order S → E → I → R. Note that there is no term
of the form ES in the above equations. Therefore, contact between a susceptible person and an
exposed person does not have any consequences. This is precisely the difference between previous
diseases to which the SEIR model has been applied, and COVID-19.
Apparently the first paper to identify asymptomatic patients as a separate category is [23].
The model proposed there, which might be called the SAIR model, is as follows: The population is
divided into four groups, denoted as Susceptible (S), Asymptomatic (A), Infected (I), and Removed
(R).
Ṡ = −βA AS − βI IS,
Ȧ = βA AS + βI IS − γA A − δA,
I˙ = δA − γI I,

(4)

Ṙ = γA A + γI I.
In contrast with the SEIR model of (3), in the SAIR model, interactions between susceptible
persons (S) on one side, and either asymptomatic (A) or infected (I) persons on the other side,
can lead to fresh infections, at rates of βA and βI respectively. The newly infected persons initially
enter the asymptomatic group A. The asymptomatic persons in the A group move to the I group
and become symptomatic at a rate of δ, while others recover by moving to the group R at a rate
of γA . directly to the R group rate at another rate. Finally, symptomatic persons in the I group
get removed at a rate f γI .
Now we study the stability of the various models, namely SIR, SEIR, and SAIR. The first two
are well-studied in the literature [18, 16]. However, the stability analysis of the SAIR model is
initiated in [23] and completed in [3]. The approach proposed in [3] is based on an extension of
the well-known Krasovskii-LaSalle invariance theory for studying nonlinear differential equations,
and results in very simple proofs. Moreover, the approach in [3] is applicable to quite general
problems, and not just epidemiological models. To state the theorem concisely, we introduce the
set of equilibria for each class of models. As shown in [11], the set
ESIR := {S ∈ [0, 1], I = 0}
is the set of equilibria for the SIR model of (2), while
ESEIR := {S ∈ [0, 1], E = 0, I = 0}
is the set of equilibria for the SEIR model of (3). Similarly, the set
ESAIR := {S ∈ [0, 1], A = 0, I = 0}
3

is the set of equilibria for the SAIR model of (4). It is shown in [3, Theorem 6] that, as t → ∞, the
trajectories of each system approach the corresponding set of equilibria. However, the introduction
of births and deaths, knows as “vital dynamics,” results in each system having only two equilibria.
Vital dynamics are not discussed in this paper, but a thorough discussion can be found in [3].

Parameter Estimation in the Simplified SAIR Model
While the literature in epidemiology is quite rich in the formulation and the stability analysis of
various models, there is rather less discussion on estimating the parameters of the model, that is,
inferring the values of the various parameters in the model on the basis of observations. That is the
topic of the present section. We begin by formulating a simplified version of the SAIR model that
is appicable to the COVID-19 pandemic. Then we present a method for estimating the parameters
of this model. We conclude the section by showing that one of the parameters is very difficult to
estimate accurately. This observation provides the motivation for the SUTRA model, which is the
main contribution of the paper and is presented in the next section.
The SAIR model in (4) can be simplified by assuming that
βA = βI = β, γA = γI = γ.

(5)

Ṡ = −βAS − βIS, Ȧ = βAS + βIS − γA − δA, I˙ = δA − γI.

(6)

This leads to
Thus there are only three parameters in this model, which might be called the simplified SAIR
model, as opposed to five in the full SAIR model of (4). The justification for these simplifying
assumptions is given next.
1. The assumption that βA = βI = β means that the likelihood of fresh infection is the same,
whether the contact is between A and S, or between I and S. After the onset of the COVID19 pandemic, several papers in the literature have studied “viral shedding” by both asymptomatic and infected patients, and conclude that there is no discernible difference between
the two; see for example [30, 19, 17].
2. The assumption that γA = γI = γ means that persons in both groups A and I move to
the “Removed” group R at the same rate γ. It is observed that almost all asymptomatic
COVID-19 patients recover within a span of about ten to twelve days. Thus one can take
γA to be in the interval [1/12, 1/10]. In the case of symptomatic patients, there is a small
fraction that die, while the rest recover with about the same time constant as asymptomatic
patients. However, since R includes both those who recover as well as those who die, the time
constant for removal from the I group is the same as for the A group.
With these justifications, we now study the simplified SAIR model (6). Let us define M := A+I,
so that A = M − I. Note that M is the total number of infected persons, though it cannot be
measured directly. Then (6) can be rewritten as
Ṡ = −βSM, Ṁ = βSM − γM, I˙ = δM − (γ + δ)I.

(7)

Note that the first two equations do not contain I. In fact these two equations represent just the
standard SIR model of (1) with M playing the role of I. The objective is to estimate these three
parameters β, γ, δ based only on data that can be measured. This consists of the daily totals of
4

symptomatically infected patients I, and the subset of those who recover; this can be denoted as
RI and satisfies ṘI = γI. It is also reasonable to assume that, when the pandemic starts, the initial
conditions are
S(0) = 1 − A(0), I(0) = 0.
(8)
In other words, the pandemic is seeded by a small number of asymptomatic patients, and that
there are no symptomatic patients at the outset. Moreover, A(0)  1.
Note that, when t is very small, we have that S(t) ≈ 1. Therefore we can rewrite the second
equation in (7) as
Ṁ ≈ (β − γ)M, or M (t) ≈ M (0) exp[(β − γ)t].
(9)
Observe that, unless β > γ, the so-called basic reproduction ratio β/γ is less than one, and the
pandemic does not take off [11]. Hence it can be assumed that β > γ. Next, one can substitute
from (9) into the third equation in (8), as follows:
I˙ = δM (0) exp[(β − γ)t] − (γ + δ)I, I(0) = 0.

(10)

δ
[exp[(β − γ)t] − exp(−(γ + δ)t)].
β+δ

(11)

The solution of (10) is
I(t) =
In turn (11) can be rewritten as
I(t) = C exp[(β − γ)t]{1 − exp[(β + δ)t]},

(12)

where C = δ/(β + δ). Next, we can compute the logarithm of I(t) and note that
ln I(t) = ln C + (β − γ)t + ln{1 − exp[(β + δ)t]}.

(13)

Of course these equations are only approximate.
Based on these approximations, it is possible to estimate all three constants. First, note that
both I and RI can be measured, and satisfy ṘI = γI. Therefore, for any fixed time width T , we
can write
Z
t+T

R(t + T ) − R(t) = γ

I(s)ds.

(14)

t

The parameter T is up to us to choose. In principle we could choose T = 1 and compute the daily
recovery totals. However, this would not be very reliable, due to the vagaries in reporting recovery
data. Since there is usually weekly cyclicity in the reports, a good choice is T = 7 (days). One can
generate the vector [R(t + T ) − R(t)] for various values of t, and also I(t) for various t, and simply
find the best fit for the slope; this gives γ. Next, it can be seen from (11) that I(·) is the sum of
a growing exponential and a decaying exponential. Therefore ln I(t) looks linear once the initial
part of the curve is ignored. By plotting ln I(t) as a function of t, it is possible to infer the value
of β − γ, and since we already know γ, we can in turn in turn infer β. Finally, once β is known, it
is possible to compute the residual term ln{1 − exp[(β + δ)t]}, from which δ can be inferred.
Figure 1 shows the plot of ln I(t) versus t for an exact solution of (7) (i.e, no approximations),
with β = 0.2, γ = 0.08, δ = 0.001. The computation of γ using (14) is not shown, as it is very
robust, and the correct value of γ = 0.08 is recovered (corresponding to a mean recovery period
of 12.5 days). From the figure it can be seen that the graph does indeed follow a straight-line
pattern, leading to the estimate β̂ = 0.201, which is very good. However, the estimated value of

δ is 0.01, which is off by a factor of ten. This error is both inevitable and undesirable. First, the
error is inevitable because (13) gives an estimate of β + δ, and not δ alone, and β  δ; there is
no way to overcome this. The error is also undesirable because it follows from (6) that when the
infected population is at its maximum, we have that I˙ = 0 which implies that A = (γ/δ)I. Thus,
when the infection peaks (which can be inferred from available measurements), the ratio between
asymptomatic and symptomatic patients is γ/δ, and errors in estimating δ lead to poor estimates
of the number of asymptomatic patients.

The SUTRA Model
While the SAIR model formulated in [23] is the first one to make a clear distinction between
asymptomatic and symptomatic patients, it does make one unrealistic assumption, namely: that all
persons in group I are symptomatic. The logic in [23] is that persons with symptoms would present
themselves to the health authorities, while asymptomatic persons would not. Over time, some
asymptomatic patients would develop symptoms, at which time they too would present themselves
to the health authorities. However, this is not how matters have evolved during the COVID-19
pandemic. Instead of the A and I groups, it more realistic to have groups U for Undetected but
infected, and T for Tested Positive. In most countries, once a person tests positive (i.e., infected)
for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, contact tracing begins, whereby family members, and anyone else who
might have come into contact the person who tested positive are themselves tested. Some of these
tested persons would be found to be positive, while others would test negative. Those who test
negative need not concern us, as they belong to the Susceptible group S. However, among those
test positive, which we call T , it is possible to make a further subgrouping into TA (tested positive
and asymptomatic) and TS (tested positive and symptomatic). In contrast, those in group U are
infected but asymptomatic, and thus are not detected. The point is that, due to contact tracing,
some fraction (however small) of asymptomatic patients are also identified. To compare with the
SAIR model, we can define A = U + TA , while I = TS . Moreover, it is believed that the group
A greatly outnumbers I = TS . In [7], it is proposed that 75% of patients are asymptomatic, i.e.,
that A/I ≈ 3. However, experience in India indicates that this is a vast underestimate. Even
within the group T who test positive, about 80% to 85% turn out to be asymptomatic, so that
6

TA /TS ≈ 5. Thus A/I = (U + TA )/TS would be much higher. Indeed, estimating this ratio is one
of the contributions of the present paper.
Let us now construct a model for the evolution of the pandemic. At present, in most countries,
persons in the group T (whether symptomatic or not) are quarantined, and it can be assumed that
they do not come into contact with the Susceptible population S. Therefore persons in group S get
infected only through contact with group U of undetected infected patients, with a likelihood of β.
Finally, it is assumed that all infected persons are initially asymptomatic, and thus enter group U .
In turn some part of U , call it x, moves to T , while the others move towards recovery. This leads
to
Ṡ = −βSU, U̇ = βSU − x − γU,
where x is the as yet unspecified transfer rate, and γ is the rate of recovery. In turn the people in
the T group get removed at the same rate γ as those in the U group. It is easier to accept that
both groups have same removal rates under the new interpretation than with SAIR model since
most of T consists of TA which is same as U (the only difference being that asymptomatics in TA
get detected). Thus we can write
Ṫ = x − γT, ṘU = γU, ṘT = γT.
Thus the model formulation is complete once we specify x, the transfer rate from group U to group
T . One possibility is to assume that everyone from U migrates to T at a fixed rate δ, so that
x = δU . This would lead to
U̇ = βSU − δU − γU, Ṫ = δU − γT.
This is the same as the simplified SAIR model of (6), with A and I replaced by U and T respectively.
Thus the above model would suffer from the same difficulties in parameter estimation as that in
(6). Thus an alternate approach is needed.
In the above described process, it can be assumed that many of the people who tested positive
contracted the infection after the person originally found positive, and triggered the contact tracing.
Also, most of the symptomatic cases show symptoms within a week of getting infected. Hence,
the chances of a person in U getting detected are far higher for those who were infected in past
one week than those who were infected earlier. The fraction of infected cases in the past few days
can be taken to be proportional to βSU , the fraction of persons who got infected most recently, as
the number of cases do not change significantly over a window of few days. Therefore we choose
x = βSU , with  being another parameter of the model. With this assumption, the full SUTRA
model becomes
Ṡ = βSU,
(15)
U̇ = βSU − βSU − γU, Ṫ = βSU − γT,

(16)

ṘU = γU, ṘT = γT.

(17)

The acronym SUTRA stands for Susceptible, Undetected, Tested (positive), and Removed (recovered or dead) Approach. Susceptible, The word Sutra also means an aphorism. Sutras are a genre
of ancient and medieval Hindu texts, and depict a code strung together by a genre. It is possible
to introduce another parameter D denoting deaths, and write it as Ḋ = ηT . However, it is quite
easy to estimate η as the ratio between the incremental death totals and the increase in cumulative
positive test cases, as in (14). Hence that relationship is not shown as a part of the SUTRA model.

Analyzing Model Equations
Defining M = U + T , R = RU + RT , we get from equations (16) and (17) that


for some constant d. Since e−γt is a decaying exponential, it follows that, except for an initial
transient period, the relationship M = (1/)I holds. This in turn implies that U = M − T =
((1/) − 1)T . Note that 1/γ is the expected recovery period for a patient. Hence, for COVID-19,
γ ≈ 0.1 and there is not much uncertainty about this parameter. Therefore the transient period
will not last more than ten or at most fifteen days. These simplifications allow us to rewrite
equation (18) as:
Ṫ + ṘT = βSU = β(1 − )ST
= β(1 − )(1 − (M + R))T
1
= β(1 − )(1 − (T + RT ) − c)T

β(1 − )
= β(1 − )(1 − c)T −
(T + RT )T


(22)

Eq. (22) is the fundamental equation governing the pandemic. It establishes a relationship
between Ṫ + ṘT , T , and (T + RT )T , which are all observable quantities. This equation allows us to
estimate the parameters in the model, and to establish the correctness of the model with respect
to COVID-19 by observing that the proposed relationship indeed holds.

Parameter Estimation in the SUTRA Model
The progression of a pandemic is typically reported as three daily time series giving the total
number of detected infections, total number of recoveries, and the total number of deaths. These
quantities equal P · (T + RT ), P · RT and P · D respsectively, where P is the population within
the reach of the pandemic. An added complication is that, when modeling the growth of pandemic
during its initial stages, the value of P keeps increasing as the pandemic spreads over a geographical
region. We model it by writing P = ρP0 where P0 is the total population of the region under study,
and ρ is a monotonically increasing parameter between 0 and 1, which we call “reach.”

for β̃ = β(1 − )(1 − c) and ˜ = ρ(1 − c) over a time-interval when ρ remains constant.
We now describe methods for estimating the parameter values. The first observation is that the
parameter values change over time, either naturally (ρ keeps increasing for example) or through
administrative intervention (lockdowns reduce value of β, higher testing increases , and so on).
It is reasonable to expect that the changes will either be sudden (lockdowns), or will be gradual
(increase in reach). Hence we assume the parameters to be piecewise-constant. The entire timeline
of the pandemic is divided into phases such that within each phase the parameters are constant.
Further, at the beginning of each phase, the parameter values drift slowly for a brief period of time
before settling down to their new values.

Detecting Phase Boundaries
Equation (23) is impacted by all parameters of the pandemic except the death rate η, which can
be estimated separately from the rest. So we define a phase change as a time instant where the
equation breaks down due to significant errors. We start a new phase from that point. Note that
this breakdown may continue for some time thereafter, since the parameters may take some time
to stabilize. We call this the drift period of the new phase.

Estimating η and γ
Parameters γ and η can be computed by using equations ṘT = γT and Ḋ = ηT , where D = ρP0 D.
In order to eliminate errors in reported data, we integrate the equations over seven days and use
multiple time instants to calculate values of γ and η respectively that minimize the error. The
equations are analogous to (14).

Estimating β̃ and ˜
Equation (23) has β̃ and ˜ as unknowns, so we can estimate their values by using a similar approach
as above. However, estimating two parameters simultaneously becomes difficult with relatively few
data points (which happens when the duration of the phase is short), or the data has significant
errors. In such situations we use a different method for estimation that is more tolerant to errors
as described below.
To reduce errors, we integrate equation (23) over seven days and take several time instants, say
m, in a phase. From the input time series, we can extract the corresponding m values of T , Ṫ + R˙T ,
and T (T + RT )/P0 . Let these be represented by m-dimensional vectors u, v, and w respectively.
Then there are two possible methods for estimating β̃ and ˜, as described next.
Standard Method
The standard way is to find values for β̃ and ˜ that maximize the R2 -value given by
R2 = 1 −

|u − β̃1 v − 1˜ w|2
|u|2
9

,

where | · | denotes the Euclidean norm of a vector. When there are significant errors in the data or
the duration of a phase is small, this method can give a non-physical solution whereby either β̃ or
˜ are negative! In such situations we use an alternate method.
Alternate Method
Let
Rβ2
R2

=1−
=1−

|u − β̃1 v − 1˜ w|2
|u − 1˜ w|2
|u − β̃1 v − 1˜ w|2
|u − β̃1 v|2

Find values of β̃ > 0 and ˜ > 0 that maximize the product Rβ2 · R2 . This choice ensures that both β̃
and ˜ play almost equally significant roles in minimizing the error. Further, the desired maximum
of Rβ2 R2 is guaranteed to exist since
Rβ2 R2

=

(2vT u − 1˜ vT w − β̃1 vT v)(2wT u − β̃1 wT v − 1˜ wT w)
β̃˜
|u − 1˜ w|2 |u − β̃1 v|2

(24)

The denominator of equation (24) is always positive (under the requirement that β̃, ˜ > 0), and
the numerator is a product of two terms involving the unknowns 1/β̃ and 1/˜
. Therefore the value
 ≥ 0, along with
of Rβ2 R2 is positive inside the polygon defined by 1/β̃ ≥ 0 and 1/˜

and is zero on the boundaries. This guarantees that there exists at least one maximum inside the
polygon.

Estimating ρ and c
Suppose all the parameters are known for the previous phase. Using these, we can compute the
time evolution of M = ρP0 M , R = ρP0 R, T , and RT up to the end of the phase. As shown above,
we can also compute the values of η, γ, β̃, and ˜ for the current phase. Using the last two values,
the evolution of T and RT for the current phase can be computed.
Define a function f : [−1, 1] × [0, 1] 7→ [−1, 1] × [0, 1] as per the algorithm below. The first
component is the range of possible values of the parameter c and second of the parameter ρ.
Input: (a, b). Let
c = a, ρ = b,  =

˜
β̃
,β =
.
b(1 − a)
(1 − )(1 − a)

Using these, compute the evolution of M and R for the current phase. Fit the values
of M + R and T + RT for different time instants on a line and let 1/e and a0 be the
˜
0 0
slope and intercept respectively. Let b0 = e(1−a
0 ) and output (a , b ).
10

In the above, (a, b) is the current guess for (c, ρ), and (a0 , b0 ) the value of (c, ρ) obtained from
the simulation done using the currently guessed value. Hence the correct value of (c, ρ) will be a
fixed point of the map
f : (a, b) 7→ (a0 , b0 ).
In all our simulations we have found that:
1. There is a unique fixed point of f , and
2. Staring from a random (a, b) and iterating f fifteen times almost always converges to the
fixed point value.
For example, in simulations for India, all starting points converge. For Italy, except for phases 2–4,
all points converge, and for phases 2–4, more than 90% of points converge. And for US, all points
converge for phases 3, 6, 7, 10, and for the rest more than 90% of points converge.
Using the above algorithm, we can estimate values of all parameters for the current phase.
The only exception is the first phase when there is no previous phase, and as a result, there is no
starting point to compute evolution of M and R as required by the function f . The first phase
would typically be at the start of pandemic and so the value of c can be taken to be zero. This
leaves only the parameter  to be estimated. The above analysis provides no method of estimating
this parameter. Thus at least one external measurement is required to estimate  in the first
phase. This is possible if sero-survey data is available at some point of time during the evolution
of the pandemic (not necessarily during the first phase), as it can be shown that increasing initial
 decreases R for all time thereafter, except when the pandemic is nearing its end.

Parameter values during drift period
The above calculations give us values of all parameters post the drift period of every phase. For
the drift period, we take each parameter value to be a weighted average of its values for the post
drift periods of previous and current phases. Two of the six parameters of the model (β and ρ) are
determined by the behavior of the population at large, while the remaining four can be controlled
by administrative decisions. We have chosen to use the geometric mean for the first two parameters,
and the arithmetical mean for remaining four parameters.
Specifically, suppose d is the number of days in drift period, and γ0 and γ1 are the computed
values of parameter γ in the previous and the current phases. Then its value for the ith day in the
drift period of current phase is taken to be
γ0 +

Herd Immunity
In classical epidemiology, the phrase “herd immunity” refers to the level of susceptible population
in the population at which the number of infections reaches its maximum. Interestingly, the phrase
“herd immunity” [27] predates the introduction of the SIR model for a pandemic [15]. However, a
11

mathematical formula for the onset of herd immunity was derived only much later [25, 9]. In the
traditional SIR model (1), the herd immunity level can be determined by setting I˙ = 0, which gives
β
1
.
=
γ
R0
Thus, when herd immunity level is reached, the total number of infected and removed is given by
R0 − 1
I +R=1−S =
.
R0
In more elaborate models such as the SAIR model of (4), it is not easy to obtain an explicit formula
for the onset of herd immunity. However, in the case of the SUTRA model, it follows that the triplet
(S, M, R) satisfies the SIR equations (1) with I replaced by M and β with β(1 − ). Therefore,
once the parameters of the SUTRA model are estimated, it follows that the maximum values of M
and T respectively are given by
R0 − 1
R0 − 1
Mmax =
, Imax =
,
R0
R0
where R0 = β(1 − )/γ.
The conclusion therefore is that, so long as the model parameters are constant, the number of
infections shows a unimodal behavior: It rises to a maximum and then decreases to zero. Further
details can be found in [10, 11]. However, when the model parameters themselves change, this
observation is no longer valid. Indeed, several countries have witnessed multiple peaks of the
number of infections. Now we analyze how all the peaks of the infections can be determined.
Every peak value of infections is characterized by
βIS = γS =⇒ S =

0 = Ṫ

Since T 6= 0, we get the condition:

(25)

This gives a condition for T peaking in a given phase: T + RT < ˜P0 (1 − γ/β̃) at the beginning
of phase and T + RT > ˜P0 (1 − γ/β̃) at the end of the phase. In order to predict whether there
would be another peak beyond the end of the current phase, we need to estimate the maximum
possible value of ˜ and minimum possible value of γ/β̃. In our simulations, we have found γ/β̃ ≥ 0.3
and similar value has been observed in the literature as well (see for example, [13]). Therefore, if
T + RT > 0.7˜
P0 , then it can be predicted that there would be no peaks of T higher than the
current peak in future, or that herd immunity has been reached. However, this number is dependent
on the value of  which is a function of testing strategy adopted. Our simulations show (see tables
below) that value of  tends to stablize after some time. So letting S denote the stable value of ,
which also implies that c ≈ 0 and so ˜ ≤ S , we can conclude that if
T + RT  0.7S P0 ,
then there will be no future peaks assuming that testing strategy does not change dramatically to
increase  well beyond S .

Model Validation
Our model predicts an unexpected relationship between the observed values T and RT (see equation (23). It essentially states that the values of T and RT follow the trajectory of an SIR model
with contact parameter β̃ and population ˜P0 . If this relationship is observed in actual data, then
it would provide strong evidence that COVID-19 dynamics are well-approximated by the SUTRA
model.
It is straightforward to see that Equation (23) holds if and only if, for some value b > 0, the

lie on a straight line passing through the origin after an initial interval denoting the drift period
of a phase, and in addition, the slope of the line is 1/˜
. We use this criterion also to detect when
a new phase has started, namely: when the points start drifting away from the straight line as t
increases.
In our analysis of twenty-five countries and twenty-eight states of India, we have found the
points to be very close to a line: only rarely is the R2 -value of the fit less than 0.9. We demonstrate
this phenomenon by using data from Italy – it is observed to have low noise and so the fit is better
(R2 -values are always more than 0.99). The plots for all seven phases of Italy are given in Figures
2 through 8.

Assessment of Strategies Adopted by Various Countries
The contents of the previous section provide strong evidence that SUTRA is the right model for
COVID-19. This is further validated by comparing trajectories for T computed through the model
with the actual numbers for several countries in this section. Moreover, armed with the values of
various parameters for different phases, particularly , β, and ρ, we can analyze the response of
a country to the pandemic and its impact. In this section, we analyze the strategies followed by
countries and how successful they were.
There are two broad strategies for limiting the damage of the pandemic in the population:

Minimize Reach: Minimize the spread (through containment zones, isolation, extensive testing
etc) so that few people get infected, and wait for the arrival of a vaccine. This corresponds
to minimization of the parameter ρ.
Maximize Reach: Aim for herd immunity by letting the reach increase in a controlled manner,
so that the medical infrastructure does not get overwhelmed. This is the strategy advocated
by the UK for example [29].
It goes without saying that succesfully implementing either is very difficult for any country. Both
strategies have been followed by various countries, with some countries switching from one strategy
to the other midway through the pandemic. We discuss the pros and cons of these strategies along
with give examples of countries that implemented them and their success.
As observed during discussion on estimation of parameters, at least one sero-survey data point
is needed to calibrate the model for a country. Such data points are available for many countries;
see for example [4, 5]. In case where multiple data points are available for a country, we have used
the earliest one. Serological surveys detect the presence of antibodies, levels of which may diminish
with time [28]. However all those who were infected with COVID-19 (either asymptotically or more
severely) retain some form of immunity, for example through memory B cells and both CD4+ and
CD8+ T-cell mediation, even after antibodies have reduced [24]. Thus we believe that sero-survey
data taken early during 630 the pandemic leads to more reliable estimates of 1/.
with the associated 95% confidence intervals ,are presented in a tabuar form, with the initial
estimate of 1/ (obtained through calibration) marked in red color.

Minimizing Reach
If the pandemic can be limited to a small section of population, the human and economic costs
are minimized. However, there is always a risk of major outbreak and so the system needs to be
alert and agile all the time. Significant discipline from people is also required to keep the risk of
infection low. Due to these reasons, this strategy has better chances of success in countries with
sparse or homogeneous and disciplined population. Indeed, amongst the countries analyzed, the
successful ones satisfy this criteria. Of these, South Korea is most successful with reach limited to
0.5% of population even in January 2021! Australia (1.2%), Norway (8.2%), and Canada (8.9%)
are some other countries that have been able to significantly limit the reach.

Maximizing Reach
Herd immunity is a laudable objective if it can be achieved, but the passage to it is fraught with
danger. Excessive control may limit the reach of the pandemic, thus eliminating the possibility
of achieving herd immunity. Therefore, calibrated control (through lockdowns, distancing etc.) is
very important. Since
γ
γ
T + RT = ˜P0 (1 − ) ≈ ρP0 (1 − ),
β
β̃
in order to avoid a rapid increase in total infections, one should initially reduce β (through lockdowns
and personal protection measures), and then allow ρ to increase to close to its maximum value of 1.
At this point, if the effective reproduction ratio, defined as the product SR0 , is substantially smaller
than one, then β can be permitted to increase slowly, through a relaxation of various lockdown
measures.
From publicly available data [31], it appears that India is perhaps the only major economy
that has managed to get the strategy right. Other large countries have witnessed multiple peaks
in their infection numbers. These multiple peaks can be explained by a phase-wise analysis of the
parameters of the SUTRA model for each of these countries. However, relating the variations of
these model parameters to policy decisions taken is outside the scope of the present paper.
In the case of India however, it is easy to establish why the decisions taken have led to the
avoidance of multiple peaks. Indeed, in our earlier paper [1], we have established that the imposition
of the first lockdown in March 2020 decreased the peak infection level by a factor of fourteen, and
pushed the peak out in time by four months. In other words, “India flattened the curve.” More
details are given next.
The parameter β reduced significantly due to lockdown and stayed low at ≈ 0.1 up to August
by which time ρ had increased to ≈ 0.9. Over the next five months, β slowly increased to its
present value of ≈ 0.18, while ρ has increased slightly to ≈ 0.96. (Indeed ρ cannot increase beyond
one.) There was only one peak in September, ignoring very minor peak in November. For India,
as on 27th January, 0.7S P0 ≈ 12.9 million, and T + RT ≈ 10.7 million indicating there is still
room for another peak. However, it appears very unlikely since γ/β̃ seems to have stabilized to
≈ 0.5, significantly higher than 0.3, suggesting that threshold for last peak is lower (≈ 0.5S P0 ≈ 9.2
million). The immune population is now close to 60%. So one can conclude that the herd immunity
stage has been reached.
Some other countries that are close to the herd immunity stage are UK (ρ > 95%, immune
population > 60%, 0.7S P0 ≈ 4 millon, T + RT ≈ 3.7 million), and Japan (ρ > 95%, immune
population > 55%, 0.7S P0 ≈ 0.40 million, T + RT ≈ 0.37 million). For UK, the recovery data is
not reported; therefore, we fix γ = 0.1 in the model for UK , correponding to a mean recovery period
of ten days, and compare the trajectories of the model-computed Ṫ + ṘT with actual numbers. For

Japan, the fraction of detected cases is a very small fraction of the total (≈ 1/222). The reason for

There are several countries where the reach ρ is between 30% to 70%, indicating the possibility
of future peaks. We present two examples: Italy and US.
For US, the recovery data is not reported regularly; therefore, as in the case of UK, we fix
γ = 0.1 and compare trajectories of the model-computed Ṫ + ṘT with actual numbers.
