ABSTRACT
In this paper, we collect and study Twitter communications to understand the socio-economic impact of COVID-19 in the United
States during the early days of the pandemic. Our analysis reveals
that COVID-19 gripped the nation during this time as is evidenced
by the significant number of trending hashtags. With infections
soaring rapidly, users took to Twitter asking people to self isolate
and quarantine themselves. Users also demanded closure of schools,
bars, and restaurants as well as lockdown of cities and states. The
communications reveal the ensuing panic buying and the unavailability of some essential goods, in particular toilet paper. We also
observe users express their frustration in their communications
as the virus spread continued. We methodically collect a total of
530,206 tweets by identifying and tracking trending COVID-related
hashtags. We then group the hashtags into six main categories,
namely 1) General COVID, 2) Quarantine, 3) Panic Buying, 4) School
Closures, 5) Lockdowns, and 6) Frustration and Hope, and study
the temporal evolution of tweets in these hashtags. We conduct a
linguistic analysis of words common to all the hashtag groups and
specific to each hashtag group. Our preliminary study presents a
succinct and aggregated picture of people’s response to the pandemic and lays the groundwork for future fine-grained linguistic
and behavioral analysis.

INTRODUCTION

COVID-19 (also known as the novel coronavirus) is the world’s
first global pandemic and has affected humans in all countries of
the world. While humanity has seen numerous epidemics including
a number of deadly ones over the last two decades (e.g., SARS,
MERS, Ebola), the grief and disruption that COVID-19 will inflict is
incomparable (and perhaps unimaginable). At the time of writing
this paper, COVID-19 is still rapidly spreading around the world
and projections for the next few months are grim and extremely
disconcerting.

With no cure in sight and with the chances of COVID-19 reemerging for a second (or multiple) time(s) even after the world manages
to contain this first outbreak, it is critical that we understand and
analyze the socio-economic disruptions of the first outbreak, so
that we are better prepared to handle it in the future. Additionally, with ever-increasing mobility of humans and goods, it is only
prudent to assume that such epidemics are likely to occur in the
future. The learnings from COVID-19 will also enable humankind
to prevent such epidemics from transforming into global pandemics
and minimize the socio-economic disruption.
In this preliminary work, our goal is to analyze the socio-economic
disruption caused by COVID-19 in the United States of America,
understand the chain of events that occurred during the spread
of the infection, and draw meaningful conclusions so that similar
mistakes can be avoided in the future. Though Twitter data has
previously been shown to be biased [7], Twitter has emerged as the
primary media for people to express their opinion especially during this time and our study offers a perspective into the impact as
self-disclosed by people in a form that is easily understandable and
can be acted upon. We summarize our main contributions below.
• We collect 530,206 tweets from Twitter between March 14th
to March 24th , a time period when the virus significantly
spread in the US and quantitatively demonstrate the socioeconomic disruption and distress experienced by the people.
Calls for closures started off with schools (e.g., #closenycschools), then moved on to bars and restaurants (e.g., #barsshut),
and finally to entire cities and states (e.g., #lockdownusa).
While these calls were initially mainly confined to the Seattle, Bay Area, and NY regions (e.g., #seattleshutdown, #shutdownnyc), they later expanded to include other parts of the
country (e.g., #shutdownflorida, #vegasshutdown). Alongside, panic buying and hoarding escalated with essential
items particularly toilet paper becoming unavailable in stores
(e.g., #panicbuying, #toiletpapercrisis).
• We observe increased calls for social distancing, quarantining, and working from home to limit the spread of the disease
(e.g., #socialdistancingnow, #workfromhome). To slow the
exponential increase in the number of infections, people
also rallied for flattening the curve and staying at home for
extended periods (e.g., #flattenthecurve). The challenges of
working from home also surface in communications (e.g.,
#stayhomechallenge). With the passage of time, we see an increased fluctuation in emotions with some people expressing
their anger at individuals flouting social distancing calls (e.g.,
#covidiots), while others rallying people to fight the disease
(e.g., #fightback) and to save workers (e.g., #saveworkers).
• We group the hashtags into six main categories, namely 1)
General COVID, 2) Quarantine, 3) School Closures, 4) Panic

Conference’17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA

Buying, 5) Lockdowns, and 6) Frustration and Hope, to quantitatively and qualitatively understand the chain of events.
We observe that general COVID and quarantine related messages remain trending throughout the duration of our study.
We observe calls for closing schools and universities peaking
in the middle of March and then reducing when the closures
go into effect. We observe a similar trend with panic buying.
Lockdowns also have a significant number of tweets with
calls initially being focused on closure of bars, followed by
cities and then states. Tweets in the frustration and hope
hashtag group have an overall increasing trend as the struggle with the virus mounts.
• We then present a linguistic analysis of the tweets in the
different hashtag groups and present the words that are representative of each group. We observe that words such as
family, life, health and death are common across hashtag
groups. We observe mentions to mental health, a possible
consequence of social isolation. We also observe solidarity
for essential workers and gratitude towards them (#saveworkers).
Our preliminary study unearths and summarizes the critical public responses surrounding COVID-19, paving the way for more
insightful fine-grained linguistic and graph analysis in the future.

DATA AND METHODS

In this section, we discuss our methodology for data collection from
Twitter to investigate the socio-economic distress and disruption
in the United States caused by COVID-19 during its early days.

2.1

Data Collection

We collect data using the Twitter search API. The results presented
in this paper are based on the data collected from March 14 to March
24, 2020. We track the trending COVID related hashtags every day
and collect the tweets in those specific hashtags. We repeat this
process to collect a total of 530,206 tweets during this time period.

Hashtag Categories

We group the hashtags into six main categories, namely 1) General COVID, 2) Quarantine, 3) School Closures, 4) Panic Buying,
5) Lockdowns, and 6) Frustration and Hope to quantitatively and
qualitatively understand the chain of events. We collect data on per
day basis for the different hashtags as and when they become trending. Tables 1 and 2 show the number of tweets in each category
and the grouping of the hashtags by category. We observe that the
total number of tweets as grouped by hashtags is 664,476, which is

Swaroop Gowdra Shanthakumar, Anand Seetharam, Arti Ramesh

higher than the total number of tweets. This is because tweets can
contain multiple hashtags and thus the same tweet can be grouped
into multiple categories. We present some example tweets in Table
3 to illustrate the types of communications occurring on Twitter
during this period.
1. General COVID: In this category, we group hashtags related
to COVID related messages as it is the most discussed topic in
conversations. This grouping is done by accumulating hashtags
related to COVID-19.
2. Quarantine: Calls for social distancing and quarantines flooded
Twitter during this outbreak. Communications centered around
quarantines, working from home and flattening the curve to slow
the spread of the virus.
3. School Closures: In this category, we collect data related to
school closures. Before states decided to close schools, users on
Twitter demanded the government to shut down public schools and
universities. We collect data from a number of hashtags centered
around this call for action.
4. Panic Buying: The spread of the virus also resulted in panic
buying and hoarding. People rushed to shopping marts and there
was a huge panic buying of sanitizers and toilet paper. This panic
buying resulted in severe shortage of toilet papers around the middle of March, an issue that remained unresolved till the first week
of April.
5. Lockdowns: With COVID-19 spreading unabated, lock downs
of public stores, bars, restaurants, and cities began in many states.
This resulted in a surge in tweets related to lock downs.
6. Frustration and Hope: Emotions ran high during these times
with people expressing anger and resentment towards those not
abiding by social distancing and quarantine rules. Alongside, people
also rallied to support workers working hard to keep essential
services running. With the beginning of April approaching, many
people started to worry about their next month’s rent.

2.3

Gaps in Data Collection

Due to the data collection limits imposed by Twitter, we are able to
only collect and analyze a portion of the tweets. Though we started
collecting data as quickly as we conceived of this project, we were
unable to collect data during the first week of March. Though we
ran our script to collect data as far back as March 8, because of
the way Twitter provides data, we obtained limited number of
tweets from March 8 to March 13. Additionally, due to the rapidly
evolving situation, it is likely that we have inadvertently missed
some important hashtags, despite our best efforts. As is the case
with most studies based on Twitter data, we also acknowledge the
presence of bias in data collection [7]. Having said that, the goal of
this study is to provide a panoramic summarized view of the impact
of the pandemic on people’s lives and aggregate public opinion as
expressed by them. Due to the nature of this study, we are confident
that the results presented here help in appreciating the sequence of
events that transpired and better prepare ourselves from a possible
second outbreak of COVID-19 or another pandemic.

individual hashtags and investigate how the number of tweets in
particular hashtag groups evolve over time. We also explore the
term frequency for each hashtag group to understand the main
points of discussion. Our analysis summarizes the critical public
responses surrounding COVID-19 and paves the way for more
insightful and fine-grained linguistic analysis in the future.

3.1

Temporal Evolution of Hashtag Groups

Figure 1a shows the top 20 hashtags observed in our data. As expected, we see that hashtags corresponding directly to COVID or
coronavirus are the most popular hashtags as most communications
are centered around them. We observe that hashtags around social

isolation, staying at home, and quarantining are also popular. Figure 1b shows the most popular hashtags by date. Similar to Figure
1a, we observe that hashtags related directly to COVID and social
distancing trend most on Twitter. The figures and the number of
tweets highlight how the pandemic gripped the United States with
its rate of spread.
We investigate the evolution of the number of tweets in various
hashtag groups over time. To calculate the number of tweets in each
hashtag group, we count the number of mentions of hashtags in
that group across all the tweets. If the tweet contains more than one
hashtag, it is counted as part of all the hashtags mentioned in it. As
the number of tweets for hashtag groups vary significantly, we plot

high in frequency. We also remove the names of places and governors such as New York, Massachusetts and Andrew Cuomo. After
filtering out these words, we then rank the words based on their
occurrence in multiple groups and their combined frequency across
all the groups. We observe words such as family, health, death, life,
work, help, thank, need, time, love, crisis. In Table 4, we present some
notable example tweets containing the common words. While one
may think that health refers to the virus-related health issues, we
notice that many people also refer to mental health in their tweets
as a possible consequence to social distancing and anxiety caused
by the virus. We also observe the usage of words such as death and
crisis to indicate the seriousness of the situation. Supporting workers and showing gratitude toward them is another common tweet
pattern that is worth mentioning. We plan to use these observations
to guide our future exploration and fine-grained analysis.

Figure 1, we observe from Figure 2a that the total number of tweets
in the General COVID and Quarantine categories are relatively
high throughout the time period of the study.
Interestingly, from Figure 2b, we observe that panic buying and
calls for school closures peak around the middle of March and then
decrease as school closures and rationing of many essential goods
such as toilet paper, cereal, and milk take effect. From Figure 2c,
we see that calls for lock downs related to schools, bars, and cities
peak in the middle of March. With the virus spreading unabated,
we observe intense calls for lock downs of cities and entire states
around the beginning of the fourth week of March, resulting in an
increased number of tweets in this category. With passage of time,
we observe people increasingly expressing their frustration and
distress in communications, while some hashtags attempt to inject
a more positive outlook.

3.2

Linguistic Word-Usage Analysis

In this section, we present results from a linguistic word usage
analysis across the different hashtag groups. First, we identify and
present the most commonly used words across all the hashtags. To
construct the first group of common words across all hashtags, we
remove the words that are same or similar to the hashtags mentioned in Table 2 as those words are redundant and tend to also be

Second, we present the most semantically meaningful and uniquely
identifying words in each hashtag group. To do this, we remove
the common words calculated in the above step from each group.
From the obtained list of words after the filtering, we then select
the top 10 words. Due to lack of space, we only present results
for four hashtag groups. Figure 3 gives us the uniquely identifying
and semantically meaningful words in each hashtag group. In the
General COVID group, we find words such as impact, response,
resource, doctor. Similarly, for School Closures, we find words such
as teacher, schedule, educator, book, class. The Panic Buying top
words mostly resonates the shortages experienced by people during
this time such as roll and tissue (referring to toilet paper), hoard,
bidet (as an alternative to toilet paper), wipe, and water. Top words
in the Lockdowns group include immigration, shelter, safety, court,
and petition, signifying the different issues surrounding lockdown.

RELATED WORK

In this section, we outline existing research related to modeling
and analyzing twitter and web data to understand social, political,
psychological and economic impacts of a variety of different events.
Due to the recent nature of the outbreak, as far as we are aware
there are no published research results related to COVID-19. Due to
the space limitations, we only discuss social-media analysis work
that are closely related to our work. Twitter has been used to study
political events and related stance [4, 5], human trafficking [10],
and public health [1–3, 6, 8]. Several work perform fine-grained
linguistic analysis on social media data [9, 11, 12].

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUDING REMARKS

In this paper, we studied Twitter communications in the United
States during the early days of the COVID-19 outbreak. As the
disease continued to spread, we observed that calls for closures of
schools, bars, cities and entire states as well as social distancing
and quarantining quickly gained fervor. Alongside, we observed
an increase in panic buying and lack of availability of essential
items, in particular toilet paper. We also conducted a linguistic
word-usage analysis and distinguished between words that are
common to multiple hashtag groups and words that uniquely and
semantically identify each hashtag group. In addition to words that
represent the group, our analysis unearths many words related to
emotion in the tweets. Also, our qualitative analysis reveals that
the words are used in multiple different contexts, which is worth
delving further into.
The research presented in this paper is preliminary and its primary aim is to quantitatively outline the socio-economic distress
already caused by COVID-19 so that we as a society can learn from
this experience and be better prepared if COVID-19 (or maybe another pandemic) were to (re)emerge in the future. At the time of
writing this paper, the infection spread has still not reached its
peak in the United States. Therefore, we plan to keep collecting
data to understand and investigate the socio-economic and political
impact of COVID-19. We plan to expand on our current research by
performing topic modeling and expanding our linguistic analysis to
unearth the main topics being discussed in the tweets. We also plan
to conduct sentiment analysis to understand the extent of positive
and negative sentiments in the tweets.
