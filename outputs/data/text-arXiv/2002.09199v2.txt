Abstract
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, many data analysis have been done. Some of them are based on the
classical epidemiological approach that assumes an exponential growth, but a few studies report that a
power-law scaling may provide a better fitting to the currently available data. Hereby, we examine the
epidemic data in China mainland (01/20/2020–02/24/2020) in a log-log scale, and indeed find that the
growth closely follows a power-law kinetics over a significantly wide time period. The exponents are
2.48(20), 2.21(6) and 4.26(12) for the number of confirmed infections, deaths and cured cases, respectively,
indicating an underlying small-world network structure in the epidemic. While no obvious deviations
from the power-law growth can be seen yet for the number of deaths and cured cases, negative deviations
have clearly appeared in the infection number, particularly that for the region outside Hubei province.
This suggests the beginning of the slowing-down of the spreading due to the huge containment effort.
Meanwhile, we find that despite the dramatic difference in magnitudes, the growth kinetics of the infection
number exhibits much similarity for Hubei and the region outside Hubei. On this basis, in the log-log plot,
we rescale the infection number for the region outside Hubei such that it overlaps as much as possible with
the total infection number in China, from which an approximate extrapolation yields the maximum of the
epidemic around March 3, 2020, with the number of infections about 83, 000. Further, by analyzing the
kinetics of the mortality in the log-log scale, we obtain a rough estimate that near March 3, the death rate
of COVID-19 would be about 4.7% ∼ 5.0% for Hubei and 0.8% ∼ 1.0% for the region outside Hubei. We
emphasize that our predictions may be quantitatively unreliable, since the data analysis is purely empirical
and various assumptions are used.

Since December 2019, the novel coronavirus COVID-19 originated in Wuhan have already spread
throughout the world, and the total number of confirmed infections has exceeded over 74,000 in China due
to the high infectivity of coronavirus COVID-19. In the past week (02/12/2020–02/24/2020), the death
rate has increased from 2.2% to 2.9% for Hubei province and from 0.5% to 0.7% for the other provinces
in China (the region outside Hubei). Many analyses have been done for the currently available epidemic
data [1–12], and significant efforts have been spent on forecasting the trends of spreading [4–11]. In the
analysis of the empirical data, several studies make use of the classical epidemiological approach that
assumes an exponential growth of the disease [1, 2]. However, Brandenburg suggested that the growth
of the disease could be described by a quadratic function [2], and Ziff et al. pointed out that a powerlaw kinetics with fractal exponent α ≈ 2.25 [3] provides a better fit to the current data for the number of
deaths. For different regions of China, Maier et al. found that the number of confirmed infections can
be effectively fitted by the pow-law with exponents 2.1 ± 0.3 [13]. These indicate the emergence of an
underlying fractal or small-world network of connections between susceptible and infected individuals,
which can be a consequence due to the interplay between the virus spreading and the inhibition like the
huge containment endeavor in China. An alarming signal in the study by Ziff et al. [3] is that no deviations

Figure 1: The growth of the confirmed infections, cured cases and deaths in China from January 20, 2020 to February 24, 2020. Note
that the criterion for the confirmed infections was changed on February 12, 2020, and the number had a jump at that day. The line
for the cured cases (deaths) is the fitting result without the early 5 (7) data points and the last 5 data points, and that for the infections
is obtained by fitting the data points from day 3 to day 18. Data Source: National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of
China[14] and Health Commission of Hubei Province[15].

In this work, we reexamine the epidemic data in China mainland starting from January 20, 2020 till
today (02/24/2020), and consider the cumulative number of confirmed infections Ninfec , of cured cases
Ncured and of deaths Ndeath . A log-log plot is shown in Fig. 1, where the beginning of the time period is set
as t = 1 for January 20, 2020. The figure demonstrates that all the three sets of numbers exhibit power-law
growing kinetics over a significantly wide time period, and the fractal exponent is αinfec ≈ 2.5 for Ninfec ,
αdeath ≈ 2.2 for Ndeath and αcured ≈ 4.3 for Ncured . Apart from the exponent αdeath ≈ 2.2, it is confirmed
that no obvious deviation can be seen for the power-law growth of Ndeath till 02/22/2020. Nevertheless,
negative deviations have clearly appeared in the number of confirmed infections since 02/12/2020 (Fig. 1).
This drop-off tendency is more pronounced in the growth kinetics of Ninfec for the region outside Hubei, see
the blue-triangle data points in Fig. 2. This suggests that due to the huge containment endeavor in China
for the past few weeks, the virus spreading has begun to slow down. Starting from 02/01/2020, the growth
of the number of cured cases has speeded up rapidly, with the fractal dimension αcured ≈ 4.3 significantly
larger than the other two exponents αinfec ≈ 2.5 and αdeath ≈ 2.2 (Fig. 1).
For a better understanding of this power-law kinetics and the fractal exponents α, one can take into the
social contact network, which confines the social contact and thus the spreading of the disease [16, 17].
Note that the contact network in the classical epidemiological model is fully connected. For a twodimensional planar network, the infected population can only grow in the periphery of them and the number
of infection Ninfec should grow in a quadratic form t2 , as pointed out in Ref. [18]. The fractional exponent
αinfec ≈ 2.5 > 2 reveals that dense (long-range) connections exist in the underlying network for the spreading of COVID-19, revealing the so-called small-world property [19, 20]. From the fact that αcured ≈ 4.3 is
significantly larger than αinfec , it is also suggested that the network in terms of medical treatments is much
more densely connected than that for Ninfec , consistent with the fact that more than 30, 000 doctors and
nurses have been sent to Hubei province from the other provinces in China.
At the day of 02/24/2020, about 83% of 77, 658 cumulative confirmed cases are from Hubei province.
Thus, we separately plot the number for Hubei and for the region outside Hubei in Fig. 2. It is observed that

Figure 2: The accumulative number of confirmed infections (a), cured cases (b) and deaths (c) in China, in Hubei province, and in
the region outside Hubei province from January 20, 2020 to February 24, 2020. Since the numbers of deaths for China and for Hubei
province almost coincide with each other, we only draw the number for China in sub-figure (c) for easy visual reference. Data Source:
National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China[14] and Health Commission of Hubei Province[15].

the growth kinetics of Ninfec and Ncured exhibit much similarity for Hubei and for the other region, although
their magnitudes of the infection numbers and the dates for the starting of the virus spreading can be rather
different. This might suggest a similar spreading mechanism for different areas of China. One special case
is the growth of the deaths outside Hubei province (Fig.2 (c)), which could because that the number of
deaths outside Hubei is too small for statistics. In spite of this, we also find that from 02/12/2020, it started
to follow a similar scaling as that for Huber province.
With the above observations, we attempt to have a preliminary estimate for the ultimate extent of the
epidemic on the basis of the current data. We understand that our estimate can be quantitatively unreliable,
since it relies on various factors like the adopted analysis method, the incompleteness of the available
information, and the assumption of no new outbreak of COVID-19 etc.
In the log-log plot shown in Fig. 2(a), we try to move the growth kinetics of Ninfec for the region outside
Hubei, along both the horizontal and the vertical axis, such that it overlaps as much as possible with that for
China. Note that due to the change of the criteria for infections at the day of 02/12/2020, the number Ninfec
has a jump, and one can choose to achieve the best overlap for the time period before or after 02/12/2020.
The results are demonstrated in Fig. 3(a), and a zoom-in plot for the data after 02/03/2020 is shown in
Fig. 3(b). It seems that the rescaled curve for the period before 02/12/2020 (green diamonds) does not lead
to a reasonable extrapolation of the total infection number in China.
We then focus on the rescaled data points in black squares, and apply a polynomial-function fitting
for it by gradually excluding the data points for the early stage of t. We adopt a simple function as y =
a(x − x0 )2 + y0 , where (x0 , y0 ) specifies the coordinates of the maximum point and a is a free parameter. The
least-squares fitting yields an estimate (x0 = 1.63(1), y0 = 4.92(1), giving t0 = 10 x0 ≈ 43 ± 2 (days) and
Ninfec,0 = 10y0 ≈ 83200 ± 2000. In other words, with the assumption of no new break of COVID-19 and
of the reliability of such an extrapolation, the epidemic would reach its maximum near March 3, 2020 with
an uncertainty of 2 days, and the maximum number of infections in China would be about 83 000 ± 2, 000.
While these fitting results can be quantitatively inaccurate, Fig. 3(b) seems to suggest that with the current
trend, the total number of infections is unlikely to exceed 100, 000.
We can further fit the data of the total number of cured cases and deaths as shown in Fig.4. The crossing
point of this fitting curve with the estimation of the maximum infections 83, 200 can be thus treated as the
end day of the epidemic. As shown in Fig.4, with the linear function y = kx + b and the quadratic function
y = a(x − x0 )2 + y0 , the end day is estimated to range from 03/07/2020 to 03/19/2020.
In Fig.5, we further plot the kinetics of the death rate in the log-log scale, and fit the data after
02/12/2020 by both the linear function y = kx + b and the quadratic function y = a(x − x0 )2 + y0 . The
extrapolated death rate is then calculated at the day of 03/03/2020, which is about 4.7% ∼ 5.0% for Hubei
province, 0.8% ∼ 1.0% for the region outside Hubei and 4% ∼ 4.5% for the whole country of China. For

Figure 3: The rescaling of the accumulative number of infections for the region outside Hubei. (a) In the log-log plot, we move
the data for the region outside Hubei, along both the horizontal and the vertical axis, to overlap with those for China as much as
possible. Due to the jump of the accumulative number of infections on February 12, 2020, the data overlapping is done for the time
period before February 12, 2020 (green diamond), as well as after February 12, 2020 (black square). We fit the rescaled data for the
region outside Hubei after 02/12/2020 to ansatz f (x) = a(x − x0 )2 + y0 by gradually excluding the early-stage data points, and obtain
a = −2.30(4), x0 = 1.63(1) and y0 = 4.92(1). The point (x0 = 1.63 ± 0.01, y0 = 4.92 ± 0.01), denoted by the crossing point of the red
dashed lines, suggests that the maximum number of infections about 83 000 ± 20 00 would arrive about 43 ± 2 days after January 20,
i.e., March 3, 2020. The fitting curve after the extreme point (indicated by dot line) has no physical implication. (b) A zoom-in plot
for the data after 02/03/2020.

the latest end day estimated in Fig.4, i.e., 03/19/2020, the corresponding extrapolated death rates are about
6.5% ∼ 7.5%, 0.7% ∼ 1.5%, and 5.5% ∼ 6.5% for for Hubei province, the region outside Hubei and the
whole country of China, respectively.
In summary, we find the growths, for the number of infections, of cured cases and of deaths, all approximately follow power-law kinetics over a significantly wide time period, indicating the small-world property
of the underlying networks. Starting from 02/12/2020, the clear negative deviations from the power-law
growth have occurred in the number of infections, reflecting that the spreading of COVID-19 has begun to
slow down due to the huge containment endeavor in China. The fractal dimension for the number of cured
cases is significantly bigger than those for the number of infections and deaths, suggesting a densely connected small-world network because of enormous medical inputs in China. By a data-collapsing method
in the log-log plot, it seems that the epidemic might reach its maximum around March 3, 2020, with the
number of infections about 83, 200 ± 2, 000. The mortality rates are analyzed in the log-log plot, and their
extrapolated values are calculated for the days of 03/03/2020 and 03/19/2020. However, we emphasize
that our estimates may be quantitatively unreliable, since the data analysis is purely empirical and various
assumptions are used.

Figure 4: The growth of the total number of cured cases and deaths in China. The two fitting functions (in log-log plot) used here
are f (x) = kx + b and f (x) = a(x − x0 )2 + y0 with k = 3.63(8), b = −1.15(12), a = −4.33(150), x0 = 1.90(16) and y0 = 4.99(28).
The crossing points of the red dashed lines indicate the days that the total number of cured cases and deaths reaches the maximum
83, 200, which is predicted by Fig.3. This gives an estimation for the end day of the epidemic 03/07/2020– 03/19/2020.
