Abstract
It is of vital importance to understand and track the dynamics of rapidly unfolding epidemics. The
health and economic consequences of the current COVID-19 pandemic provide a poignant case. Here
we point out that since they are based on differential equations, the most widely used models of epidemic spread are plagued by an approximation that is not justified in the case of the current COVID-19
pandemic. Taking the example of data from New York City, we show that currently used models significantly underestimate the initial basic reproduction number (R0 ). The correct description, based
on integral equations, can be implemented in most of the reported models and it much more accurately accounts for the dynamics of the epidemic after sharp changes in R0 due to restrictive public
congregation measures. It also provides a novel way to determine the incubation period, and most
importantly, as we demonstrate for several countries, this method allows an accurate monitoring of
R0 and thus a fine-tuning of any restrictive measures. Integral equation based models do not only
provide the conceptually correct description, they also have more predictive power than differential
equation based models, therefore we do not see any reason for using the latter.

Introduction
A commonly used approach to describe the dynamics of epidemics is based on SEIR-type (SusceptibleExposed-Infectious-Recovered) differential equations [1–5]. Recently these methods have been applied
to the COVID-19 pandemic to determine the basic reproduction number [6–11], the incubation period [12–14] and to describe the dynamics of the pandemic [15–22]. In this framework there is no natural
and transparent way to account for the delay between the introduction of public health measures and the
corresponding change in the newly reported cases. This delay occurs due to the incubation period of the
disease. Even after refinements to try to account for some aspects of this delay [15–17, 23], these models
are still plagued by uncontrolled approximations. We suggest that models based on differential equations
1

should be replaced with ones based on an integral equation, which explains the time delay without any
additional step or input. The approach we present is not completely new, it was already implicit in the
original Kermack-McKendric theory proposed in 1927 [24]. Even though several variants of that model
with various degrees of precision circulate in the current literature [25–28], their superiority over the
differential equation based method has not been widely recognised.
We emphasise that in the form presented below, the integral equation based approach is neither technically nor conceptually more complicated than the one based on differential equations. More importantly,
it gives a much more realistic representation of the epidemic dynamics. We demonstrate this by comparing how the two types of approach describe the New York City data [29], taken from the currently
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Firstly, we show that even in the initial simple exponential phase of the
epidemic, the correct, integral equation based model can give a significantly larger estimate for R0 , the
basic reproduction number. Secondly, we show that the oscillations in the graph of the number of newly
infected people after restrictive public interaction measures are introduced, is well described by the integral equation model. This is a generic feature of COVID-19 data, seen in several countries, and there
is no simple way the differential equation based models could explain it. Thirdly, using data of several countries, we illustrate how the change of R0 in time can be monitored using the integral equation
formalism.
Our comparison here is based on a simple SEIR-type differential equation model and its integral
equation counterpart containing the same variables, but a different time evolution. It can be seen from
our general discussion that the differences we find are generic features of the two types of models and
carry over to more sophisticated versions thereof. We urge everyone to test how different their results are
between the two approaches in the case of the particular models they use.

Integral equation description for discrete and continuous time evolution
The mathematical modelling of how infectious diseases spread is almost exclusively based on compartmental models. In this framework the population is divided into different categories and a dynamical
model is set up to describe how the number of individuals in each category evolves with time. A simple
model of this type is the so called SEIR model, in which the compartments are susceptible (not yet infected), exposed and infected (but not yet capable of infecting others), infectious, and recovered/removed
(not capable of infecting others any more). In its simplest form the model is characterised by three parameters, α, β, γ that determine the transition rates among different compartments through the following
set of differential equations:
I
dS
= −β S,
dt
N

dE
I
= β S − αE,
dt
N

dI
= αE − γI,

where S(t), E(t), I(t) and R(t) are the number of susceptible, exposed, infectious and recovered individuals, all functions of the time, and N = S + E + I + R is the total population.
In the initial phase of a rapidly developing epidemic, the situation we are concerned with here, S/N ≈
1, which we will assume. With this approximation the two functions describing the dynamics are E(t)
and I(t). At this point it is instructive to introduce te and ti , the average days an individual spends in the

Figure 1: The number of new infections per day, shown up to the eleventh (top) and the twelfth day
(bottom) of the epidemic. The blue area represents those that are infected, but not yet infectious, i.e.
people who were exposed between today and te = 4 days ago. The red area represents those that are
infectious, i.e. people who were exposed more than te days ago, but not more than te + ti = 7 days ago.
In the SEIR model the number of people who cease to be infectious from day 11 to day 12 is equal to
the daily average of the red area in the top panel. In reality, however, only people in the leftmost red
histogram, here a much smaller number, cease to be infectious. Similarly, in the SEIR model the number
of people who become infectious is the daily average of the blue area, when in reality it is only people
in the leftmost bar of the blue area who become infectious from day 11 to day 12. Clearly the only case
when the SEIR model correctly represents the situation is when the number of newly infected people per
day is constant in time.

categories E and I respectively. It is convenient to write the equations in terms of these parameters and
the basic reproduction number, R0 , using the simple relations α = 1/te , β = R0 /ti and γ = 1/ti .
With these new parameters the simplified form of the differential equations valid for the initial stage
when S/N ≈ 1 is

The SEIR equations are based on the assumption that the transition rates between compartments are
proportional to the number of people in those compartments. Furthermore, all people in a compartment
are treated equally, irrespective of how much time they already spent there. These assumptions are only
correct when R0 is close to 1 and changes slowly. In the following we derive the integral equation
description of epidemics.
Let us denote the number of newly infected individuals on day t by ρ(t). The function ρ(t) contains
the entire history of infections. This can be depicted in a histogram with time flowing from left to right
along the horizontal axis (Fig. 1). Based on this information we would like to determine ρ(t + 1), the
number of individuals becoming infected on the following day. As in the SEIR model above let us here
also assume that anyone exposed to the infection will become infected, but will not be infectious for te
days. Such a person will become infectious te days after exposure and will remain in this category for an
additional ti days, after which he is isolated and ceases to be capable of infecting others. In the simplest
3

version of the model te and ti can represent averages, but later on we will indicate how to generalise the
model by using continuous distributions. In Fig. 1 the blue area represents those in category E, with
te = 4, and the red area those in I, with ti = 3. Now, exactly as in the SEIR model above, the number of
newly infected on the following day, day 12 in the figure, will be
ρ(t + 1) = β

where the sum is the total number of infectious individuals at time t, i.e. the red area in the top panel of
Fig. 1. At this point we can depict the situation at time t + 1 simply by shifting both the blue and the red
region, showing the people in category E and I, one day forward to the right (bottom panel of Fig. 1).
From this point on the same procedure can be further iterated day by day: on each day we calculate the
number of newly infected for the following day and shift the windows delineating the exposed and the
infectious by one day forward.
At this point the objection could be raised that we have been comparing the continuous SEIR model
with a discretised model. However, the framework presented in the histograms can be easily generalised
from days to arbitrarily fine time steps. In the limit of infinitely fine time steps dt, we can choose the
height of the histogram bars ρ(t) such that ρ(t)dt be the number of people becoming infected in the time
interval [t, t + dt]. In this case the sum in the right hand side of Eq. (3) becomes an integral and the
equation can be rewritten as
Z t−te

We emphasise that only this continuous version of the model describes the real situation properly.

Determination of R0, the example of New York City
We illustrate the shortcomings of the SEIR model in two examples. First let us consider the case of
constant R0 > 1 which leads to the exponentially growing solution with exponent λ, i.e. all relevant
quantities (E(t), I(t) of SEIR and ρ(t) of the integral equation) are proportional to exp(λt). A simple
substitution gives:
eλ∆t − 1 (integral)
R0
,
e−λte
λ∆t
(5)
(discretised)
where R0
is the solution of the discretised equation (3) with time step ∆t. Figure 2 shows these
three R0 (SEIR, integral equation, discretised integral equation) obtained using realistic parameters that
describe the initial phase of the pandemic in New York City. There is a striking difference between the
SEIR and integral equation predictions. While the SEIR result is largely insensitive to the split of the
total incubation period into te and ti , this is not the case for the solution of the integral equation. The true
value of R0 can be 3-4 times larger than the one predicted by the SEIR model. For ti ≈ 2 days which, as
we will later see, provides a reasonable description of the daily reported cases, R0 can be as high as 20.
R0 is, of course region dependent. Less populated areas can have much smaller R0 values.

Figure 2: R0 as a function of ti , the infectious part of the incubation period. The total incubation period is
taken to be te +ti =6.4 days [13] and the exponential growth parameter is 1/λ = 1.78 days which describe
the growing phase of the New York City data [29] well. The orange colour curve with the maximum
shows the prediction (5) based on the SEIR model of eq. (2). The blue and red lines correspond to the
analytic solution (5) of the integral equation (4) and its discretised version (3) with an hourly time step,
respectively. Their agreement indicate that such a discretisation is sufficient. A daily discretisation would
give 34% higher R0 values.

One might think that this difference is only due to the relatively large incubation period (as compared
to the characteristic growth time of the pandemic) and the SEIR model gives reliable estimates for small
(integral)
incubation periods. Surprisingly this is not the case. A trivial expansion of R0
in λte and λti yields
(integral)

R0
≈ 1 + λ(te + ti /2) + λ (te /2 + te ti /2 + ti /12) + O(λ ) which is clearly different from the
SEIR result.

The effect of decreasing R0, delay and oscillation
The parameter R0 in both the SEIR- and the integral equations is in general time dependent. The most
important goal of the first restrictive measures was to decrease the value of R0 as fast as possible and bring
it below the critical value of 1. In the following we study how the different models react to a sudden drop
of R0 and compare them qualitatively to the daily reported new cases in New York City [29]. To simplify
our discussion we will assume that all cases are reported exactly after the incubation period, i.e. te + ti
days after first exposure. In the case of the SEIR model the rate of people leaving the incubation period
is dR/dt = γI while in the case of the integral equation it is ρ(t − te − ti ). These two functions will be
referred to as ”new reported cases” in the following. If we assume that the majority of cases are reported
when symptoms emerge, it follows that any change in the parameters will only show up te + ti days
later in the data. Any reasonable model should be able to naturally account for this delay. Quantities in
differential equations react immediately to any change of the parameters, thus no differential equation
based model (such as SEIR or its simple extensions) is expected to explain such a delay. The integral
equation (4), on the other hand, naturally provides a delay.

Figure 3: Left: time evolution of new reported cases after a lockdown on day 73 in the case of the SEIR
and integral equation models. For the initial phase of the pandemic 1/λ = 1.78 days, te = 4.4 days
and ti =2 days was used. This corresponds to R0SEIR = 7.37 and R0integral = 19.7. The value of R0 was
instantaneously decreased to 0.95 in both cases on day 73. The difference between the two models is
quite dramatic. The SEIR solution reacts immediately and turns smoothly to a decreasing exponential
function. The solution of the integral equation is qualitatively different. There is a delay of te + ti after
which the effect of the lockdown becomes visible, then an oscillation follows. The characteristic scales of
this oscillation are indicated in the figure. Right: time evolution of the new reported cases after a gradual
lockdown from day 71 to day 74 confronted with the data of New York City. The initial parameters are
the same as for the left panel. R0 is now decreased to 0.95 linearly in time during this four day period in
both models (for a detailed analysis how R0 changed and dropped to a smaller value in New York City
see later). The main features of the curves are similar to the left panel but the amplitude of the oscillation
is reduced, making it similar to the real data. Note that we did not fit our model to the data. This plot is
an illustration that the main features (delay and oscillation) of the data are well captured by the integral
equation and neither of these is reproduced by SEIR.

The simplest possibility is to assume that R0 decreases instantaneously after a successful lockdown.
The left panel of Figure 3 shows how the number of reported new cases evolves after a lockdown happens
on March 13 (day 73 of 2020) which reduces R0 to 0.95. A more realistic situation is shown in the right
panel of Figure 3. Here the value of R0 was gradually decreased from March 11 to March 14. In both
cases the expected delay, which is clearly visible in the data, is only explained by the integral equation.
The reported data of many countries show an interesting oscillation after the effect of a lockdown starts
to show up. This feature is also naturally described by the integral equation.
One remark is in order. The incubation period of 6.4 days is accidentally very close to the weakly
cycle of 7 days. Thus, the oscillation might in principle be just a weekend effect. Looking at the weekend
during the strongly exponential growth with enough statistics (March 14, Saturday to March 16, Monday)
one observes less cases during Saturday and Sunday and an accordingly higher number of cases on
Monday than the average exponential growth would predict. Correcting the data for this effect later would
weaken but not eliminate the observed oscillation, it seems to be a real effect. This is also supported by the
fact that different countries have minima and maxima of their oscillation on different days (e.g. in Italy
the minima are on Mondays and Tuesdays, in the Netherlands they are on Tuesdays and Wednesdays).
It is in principle possible to determine the incubation time te and ti from this oscillatory pattern.
6

Taking the distance of subsequent minima we determined te + ti . Using data of New York City, Italy,
Spain, Germany, and the Netherlands [29, 30] the period of the oscillations seems quite robust and is
around te + ti = 7.4 days on average with a spread of 0.2 days.
Once te and ti are known, one can solve eqn (4) for β(t) or equivalently R0 (t) by taking ρ(t) and the
(numerical) integral from the actual data:
ti ρ(t)
.
R0 (t) = R t−te
ρ(τ )dτ
t−te −ti

(6)

In this way one can continuously monitor the effect of restrictive or easing measures. We used this
procedure to analyse data from seven countries as well as New York City. In each country the raw data
for the daily number of new infections shows large daily fluctuations, most likely due to some anomalies
in reporting new cases. In order to remove these fluctuations we performed the following smearing
procedure. If the original data is given by ρ̄(t) then we replace this by w ρ̄(t−1)+(1−2w)ρ̄(t)+w ρ̄(t+1)
and repeat this procedure three times. We checked that the function R0 (t) depends only mildly on the
choice of w. The results, for which we used w = 0.25 are shown in Figure 4.
For all regions we can observe a large drop in R0 . However, while in China R0 went significantly
below 1, effectively stopping the epidemic, in European countries and New York City it is just below or
around 1 even today. It seems inevitable that in these regions any significant easing of the restrictions
will induce a second wave of the epidemic. An accurate monitoring of R0 is extremely important in this
situation. As demonstrated above, the integral equation formulation is the right approach here.

Conclusions and Outlook
In the previous sections we compared the SEIR model and the integral equation when both te and ti
are fixed. In reality the incubation period is described by a probability function P (τ ) which gives the
probability that a person is infectious a time τ after exposure. The integral equation (4) can easily be
generalised to include P :
Z ∞
Z ∞
ρ(t) = β
ρ(t − τ )P (τ )dτ,
R0 = β
P (τ )dτ.

In general, the transmission rate β also changes in time since new restrictive measures can be implemented. This can also be incorporated into the equation, however, in that case R0 might not have a transparent interpretation. This equation has been around in the literature for a long time (see e.g. [25–27])
but unfortunately it has not yet been widely adopted. Any evolution computed using this equation is
expected to have qualitatively similar features (delay and oscillation) as in the simple approximation presented above. The SEIR model is not a good approximation of this integral equation even if the P (τ )
probability is built into its parameters.
For later stages of a pandemic when S/N < 1 the integral equation can be generalised to include S as
well. Furthermore, one can divide the population into sub-compartments e.g. by age groups or location.
Each sub-compartment with a population of Ni can be described by its own ρi (t) infection history and
Pi (τ ) probability function and the cross infection rates between compartments j and i by βi←j . The

Figure 4: Determination of the basic reproduction number R0 as a function of time for China, Germany,
Italy, Austria, New York City, Spain, France and the United Kingdom. We used the integral equation (4)
to compute R0 from the available data [29–31]. The red bands show the results. We varied ti between 1
and 2 days and te +ti between 6.5 and 7.5 days. The uncertainty associated with this variation is shown by
the widths of the bands. As an illustration the cyan areas show the approximate time periods when well
defined restrictive measures were introduced within a short time interval (lockdown of Hubei province in
China (January 23), lockdown of Lombardy (March 8) and the whole of Italy (March 10), closing schools
in Germany (March 14), nationwide curfew (March 16) and compulsory wearing of masks (April 1) in
Austria, state of emergency (March 7) and closing of Broadway theatres (March 12) in New York City,
closing schools in Spain (March 11-12), closing schools (March 16) and restriction of movement (March
23) in France, and issuing statutory instrument 350 in the UK (March 26)). For completeness the original
data are also shown (right vertical axes). Clearly as health authorities are getting better and better data
the accuracy on R0 determination will improve.

As an example, we ran some simulations of the full course of the epidemic until S saturated close
to zero. We found that depending on the parameters the integral equation and the SEIR equations can
predict a significantly different maximal number of cases at the peak of the epidemic. Any further extension which can be included in the SEIR equations (e.g. birth and death rate, day/night differences,
inhomogeneities, meta-population systems, etc.) can also be naturally included in the integral equation
formalism.
We demonstrated that the approximation leading to differential equation based models of epidemic
spread is not sufficient in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, differential equations
provide a good description only if R0 is close to 1 and if it changes only slowly compared to the incubation
period of the disease. Note that even if R0 is larger than 1, the initial exponential phase of the epidemic
can be well described by differential equations, but they can significantly underestimate the value of
R0 , the larger the R0 , the more so. If, however, as a result of restrictive measures, R0 suddenly drops,
differential equations fail to describe the ensuing oscillatory behaviour of the number of new cases and as
a result, they are not suitable for a precise monitoring of R0 . In contrast, integral equations are naturally
suited to this task, even if sharp changes occur in R0 . We also presented a simple way to implement
the integral equation formalism in numerical simulations, which do not become more complicated than
the numerical solution of the SEIR equations. In summary, the integral equation approach has more
predictive power than the most widely used differential equation based models and also eliminates a
serious uncontrolled approximation of the latter. In the light of the present results we urge practitioners
of the field to rethink and possibly consider implementing the integral equation based technique.
