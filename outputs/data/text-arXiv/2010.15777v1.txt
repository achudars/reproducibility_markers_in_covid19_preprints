Abstract
The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a new genre of severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become the global health concern across the
world. Several studies have found that air pollution significantly determining the overall
causalities caused by COVID-19. This study explored the association between the five key air
pollutants (Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), Particulate Matter (PM2.5, PM10),
and Carbon Monoxide (CO)) and COVID-19 incidences in India. The COVID-19 confirmed
cases, air pollution concentration and meteorological variables (temperature, wind speed,
surface pressure) for district and city scale were obtained for 2019 and 2020. The locationbased air pollution observations were converted to a raster surface using interpolation. The
deaths and positive cases are reported so far were found highest in Mumbai (436 and 11394),
followed by Ahmedabad (321 and 4991), Pune (129 and 2129), Kolkata (99 and 783), Indore
(83 and 1699), Jaipur (53 and 1111), Ujjain (42 and 201), Surat (37 and 799), Vadodara (31
and 400), Chennai (23 and 2647), Bhopal (22 and 652), Thane (21 and 1889), respectively.
Unlike the other studies, this study has not found any substantial association between air
pollution and COVID-19 incidences at the district level. Considering the number of confirmed
cases, the coefficient of determination (R2) values estimated as 0.003 for PM2.5, 0.002 for PM10
and SO2, 0.001 for CO, and 0.0002 for NO2, respectively. This suggests an absolute no
significant association between air pollution and COVID-19 incidences (both confirmed cases
and death) in India. The same association was observed for the number of deaths as well. For
COVID-19 confirmed cases, none of the five pollutants have exhibited any statistically
significant association. Additionally, except the wind speed, the climate variables have no
produced any statistically significant association with the COVID-19 incidences. In India,
several other factors such as mortality, demographic composition especially the proportion of
old age and child in the population pyramid, pre-existing health status including the record of
2

previous respiratory diseases, social interaction and personal habits, neighbourhood condition
and to some extent the meteorological and weather conditions, could be associated with the
COVID-19 mortality.

1. Introduction
COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease-2019), a new genre of severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first detected in Wuhan, China, has become the
global health concern due to its unpredictable nature and incurability. As of May 13, 2020, a
total of 4 139 794 confirmed cases, and 285 328 confirmed deaths were reported in 215
countries, areas, or territories (WHO, 2020). The United States of America, Spain, Italy, the
United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Iran, China, etc. are in the list of most affected countries
by COVID-19. The human-to-human spread transmissibility and lack of adequate diagnostic
cure systems have amplified the overall mortality caused by COVID-19 across the globe. On
March 11, 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) declared the disease as a global
pandemic and introduced a set of preventive precautions and regulation measures to tackle
the spread of COVID-19 effectively and its surmount impact on the overall economy (WHO,
2020).
Several studies have analyzed the causal association between air pollution and the
incidence of COVID-19 across the globe (Ogen, 2020; Muhammad et al., 2020; Tob√≠as et al.,
2020). Ogen et al. (2020) analyzed the spatial association between the number of COVID-19
death and cases of 66 administrative regions in Italy, Spain, France, and Germany with air
pollution levels. Ogen et al. found that out of the 4443 fatality cases, 3487 (78%) were clustered
3

in the five regions (in north Italy and central Spain), which had the highest NO2 concentrations.
Wu et al. (2020) evaluated the exposure to air pollution and COVID-19 mortality in the United
States. They found that an increase of only 1 ùúág/m3 in PM2.5 is associated with an 8% increase
in the COVID-19 death rate. Zhu et al. (2020) found that a 10Œºg/m3 increase (lag0‚Äì14) in PM2.5,
PM10, NO2, and O3 can increase 2.24%, 1.76%, 6.94%, and 4.76% increase in the daily counts
of confirmed cases. However, the association between SO2 and COVID-19 cases was found
negative as a 10-Œºg m3 increase (lag0‚Äì14) in SO2 was associated with a 7.79% in COVID-19
confirmed cases (Zhu et al., 2020).
Among the key pollutants considered in different studies, NO2 has found to be the most
important determinant. Variety of factors attributing to the emission of NO2 including
anthropogenic activity - fossil fuel combustion, transportation, industrial combustion, and
natural processes - lightning and soil geochemical reaction. The acute level of NO2 is being
associated with many respiratory diseases, including hypertension (Coogan et al., 2017), heart
and cardiovascular diseases (Li et al., 2011; Wong et al., 1999), poor lung function in adults or
lung injury (Abrex et al., 2017; Bowatte et al., 2017), decreasing lung function especially in
children (Pandey et al., 2005). The other pollutants, such as SO2, CO, PM2.5, PM10, and CO,
also have a substantial impact on diseases that mainly associated with respiratory dysfunction.
Apart from the concern of environmental pollutants on respiratory illness, which is linked with
the rising COVID-19 cases, there is a meteorological indicator on the COVID-19 transmission
pertains interest in the several countries of the world. Among the meteorological parameters,
daily temperature and relative humidity are linked with the no of counts of COVID cases. Qi
et al., 2020 found a 1-degree increase of daily temperature reduced 57% daily number of
confirmed cases, while 1 % increase of relative humidity reduced 22 % daily confirmed cases
at a specific temperature. Researchers have found climatic parameters are responsible for the
illness as well as acute pneumonia.

As of May 13, 2020, a total of 74,281 confirmed cases and 2415 deaths were reported
so far in India. The overall casualties caused by COVID-19 could be linked with the air
pollution status of the country. However, the association between the key air pollutants (NO2,
SO2, PM2.5, PM10, CO) and the total number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in India have not
been evaluated yet. Therefore, an effort has been made in this study to examine how these key
pollutants have impacted the overall COVID-19 fatality in the country. The outcome could be
a reference for future epidemiological research.

2.Materials and methods
In this study, the monitored air pollution data for 2019 was collected from 237 stations
across India. The geocoded location of these ground stations was also retrieved from the
Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)1, 2020. A total of five air pollutants, i.e., Nitrogen Di
Oxide (NO2), Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), Particulate Matter (PM2.5 and PM10), and Carbon
Monoxide (C) was considered in the analysis. The district-level COVID-19 incidences,
including confirmed cases, deaths, active cases, recovered, etc. were collected from
covid19india.org2. The yearly average of the key climatic parameters (Minimum Temperature,
Maximum Temperature, Dew point temperature, and wind speed) was retrieved from European
Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)3 for the year 2019 using Goggle Earth
Engine. The updated district administrative information was used for retrieving the latest
COVID-19 statistics at the district level. The district with no data value was removed from the
analysis. The location-specific air quality values were converted to a raster surface using the
Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) interpolation method in ArcGIS.

Followed by, the average values of each pollutant was calculated using the ArcGIS
spatial zonal statistics tool. The association between the response (COVID-19 confirmed cases
and deaths) and control (air pollution and climatic) variables were evaluated using the linear
regression model. All the statistical tests were performed in R statistical software. The
significance of the estimates was measured using the probability of the significance test.

3. Results and discussion
The spatial distribution of district-wise COVID-19 cases and death from January 2020
to May 10, 2020, is presented in Fig. 1. The deaths and positive cases are reported so far were
found highest in Mumbai (436 and 11394), followed by Ahmedabad (321 and 4991), Pune (129
and 2129), Kolkata (99 and 783), Indore (83 and 1699), Jaipur (53 and 1111), Ujjain (42 and
201), Surat (37 and 799), Vadodara (31 and 400), Chennai (23 and 2647), Bhopal (22 and 652),
Thane (21 and 1889), respectively. The following could be the reasons for higher COVID-19
incidences in these districts - (1) all the major cities in India including Mumbai, Kolkata,
Chennai, Ahmedabad, Pune, Indore, etc. are located in these districts and high social interaction
in these cities enhanced the vulnerability and overall causalities caused by COVID-19. (2) The
mentioned districts had the highest number of international travel records before the nationwide
lockdown has started in India and could be linked with the overall COVID-19 mortalities as

6

the disease known to be transmitted only when a non-infected person comes to contact with
COVID-19 infected person. The distribution of different air pollutants is presented in Fig. 2.
Except for SO2, the other four pollutants were highly concentrated over the northern and
northcentral regions. For SO2, the highest concentration was observed in east-central and
western coast regions (Fig. 2).
Fig. 3 shows the association between the key air pollutants and COVID-19 confirmed
cases and deaths. Unlike the other studies, this study has not found any strong association
between air pollution and COVID-19 incidences at the district level. Considering the number
of confirmed cases, the coefficient of determination (R2) values estimated as 0.003 for PM2.5,
0.002 for PM10 and SO2, 0.001 for CO, and 0.0002 for NO2, respectively. This suggests an
absolute no significant association between air pollution and COVID-19 incidences (both
confirmed cases and death) in India. The same association was observed for the number of
deaths as well. However, while considering the city as a case of analysis, we found a weak
association between the number of deaths and air pollution for SO2 (R2 = 0.22), NO2 (R2 = 0.1)
(Fig. 4). For COVID-19 confirmed cases, none of the five pollutants have exhibited any
statistically significant association (Fig. 4).
Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 shows district level correlation analysis of COVID-19 cases is not
effectively showing any significant relationship with the climatic parameters, except the wind
speed. Despite the insignificant relationship among the COVID-19 incidents with
environmental pollutants, this study has found climatic parameters exhibit moderate to a strong
relationship with the number of confirmed cases and events of the deaths in the city-level
analysis. The figure shows that minimum temperature (oC) and the wind speed increased the
rate of confirmed cases, and the coefficient of determinants (R2) value is estimated 0.3 and 0.4,
respectively. Similarly, the same association is observed with the number of deaths. While, the
maximum temperature decreased the confirmed cases (R2 = 0.162) as well as the number of
7

death (R2 = 0.057), which shows moderate to an insignificant relationship with the number of
deaths. Thus, it is not evident that increasing temperature can reduce the COVID-19
transmission in India, while other studies in the world show high temperature has a significant
negative relationship with the COVID-19 death counts. It can be described as COVID-19
deaths occurred due to the acute pneumonic condition, which is linked with the weather change
and the severity of the coldness (Yuan et al. 2006). Our finding for the relationship between
wind speed, minimum temperature, and COVID cases have consisted of the result of Bashir et
al., 2020. Unlike these findings, other indicators are not showing any promising outcomes. This
dissimilarity might be the reason for the New York, and Indian cities are located in the different
climatic regions, while the variation of temperature is not so prominent in the Indian context.
In our study, we have not found any statistically significant association between air
pollution and COVID-19 incidences for both district and city scale. Among the five key
pollutants, the SO2 and NO2 exhibited a weak association with the COVID-19 cases and death
at the city level. Several other studies have taken similar approaches to examine the causal
linkages between air pollution and COVID-19 incidences. Wu et al. (2020) performed a
nationwide cross-sectional assessment to examine the linkages between air pollution exposure
and COVID-19 mortality across the USA and found that an increase of only 1 ùúág/m3 in PM2.5
has increased 8% COVID-19 death rate which was statistically significant at 95% confidence
level. In our study, no such association is being observed. This could be due to the following
reasons‚Äì (1) We have taken the air pollution measurements for Jan 2019 to Jan 2020 (data is
not available for the later period) and tried to draw inferences with the COVID-19 cases in
2020. This discontinuity in data selection might have caused biases and uncertainty in
measurements and thereby exhibited much lower estimates than expected. (2) In India, the
nationwide lockdown started on 24th March 2020, before the COVID-19 outbreak experienced
in the country. This might be a reason for the poor association observed between the active
8

COVID-19 cases and air pollution. (3) As we have adopted the interpolation-based data
aggregation method, which itself creates uncertainty if the adequate sample is not available for
the distance-based interpolation, it could be related to these weak estimates observed in this
study. However, though the result of this study had reported underestimated estimates, the
possibility that a high level of air pollution can increases the vulnerability COVID-19 is
evident. Contini and Costabile (2020) reported that not only the air pollution, several other
factors such as mortality, demographic composition especially the proportion of old age and
child in the population pyramid, pre-existing health status including the record of previous
respiratory diseases, social interaction and personal habits, neighbourhood condition and to
some extent the meteorological and weather conditions involved in spreading and the outbreak
of COVID-19 across the world (Sannigrahi et al., 2020a, 2020b, Chakraborti et al., 2020).

4. Conclusion
This study examined the association between air pollution and overall causalities
caused by COVID-19 in India. The monitored air pollution data for 2019 was collected from
237 ground stations across India. A total of five air pollutants, i.e., Nitrogen Di Oxide (NO2),
Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), Particulate Matter (PM2.5 and PM10), and Carbon Monoxide (C) was
considered in the analysis. The entire analysis was performed at the district and city scale for
examining the impact of air pollution on COVID-19 deaths and case factors. The deaths and
positive cases are reported so far were found highest in Mumbai (436 and 11394), followed by
Ahmedabad (321 and 4991), Pune (129 and 2129), Kolkata (99 and 783), Indore (83 and 1699),
Jaipur (53 and 1111), Ujjain (42 and 201), Surat (37 and 799), Vadodara (31 and 400), Chennai
(23 and 2647), Bhopal (22 and 652), Thane (21 and 1889), respectively. In this study, we have
not found any substantial association between air pollution and COVID-19 incidences at the

9

district level. Considering the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases, the coefficient of
determination (R2) values estimated as 0.003 for PM2.5, 0.002 for PM10 and SO2, 0.001 for CO,
and 0.0002 for NO2, respectively. This suggests an absolute no significant association between
air pollution and COVID-19 incidences (both confirmed cases and death) in India. However,
at the city level, we found a weak association between the number of deaths and air pollution
for SO2 (R2 = 0.22), NO2 (R2 = 0.1). Except for the wind speed, the climate variables have not
produced any significant relationship with COVID-19 cases. According to Contini and
Costabile (2020) several other factors such as mortality, demographic composition especially
the proportion of old age and child in the population pyramid, pre-existing health status
including the record of previous respiratory diseases, social interaction and personal habits,
neighbourhood condition and to some extent the meteorological and weather conditions
involved in spreading and the outbreak of COVID-19 across the world.
