Abstract. A widely used tool for analysing the Covid-19 pandemic is the standard SIR
model. It seems often to be used as a black box, not taking into account that this model was
derived as a special case of the seminal Kermack-McKendrick theory from 1927. This is our
starting point. We explain the setup of the Kermack-McKendrick theory (passing to a discrete
approach) and use medical information for specializing to a model which we call adapted KMcK-model. This includes effects of vaccination, mass testing and mutants. We demonstrate
the use of the model by applying it to the development in Germany. As a striking application we
demonstrate that a comparatively mild intervention reducing the time until quarantine by one
day leads to a drastic improvement. A similar effect can be obtained by certain mass testings as
we will demonstrate. We discuss possibilities to apply the model both for predictions and as an
analysis tool. We compare the adapted K-McK-model to the standard SIR model and observe
condiderable differences if the contact rates are not constant. Finally we compare the model
reproduction rate with the empirical reproduction rate determined by the Robert Koch-Institut.

1. Introduction
As early as 1927, Kermack and McKendrick published a paper “A
contribution to the mathematical theory of epidemics” in the Proceedings of the Royal Society London Ser. A. The paper became a
classic in infectious disease epidemiology and has been cited innumerable times. But how often is it actually read? Judging from an
incessant misconception of its contents, one is inclined to conclude:
hardly ever! [2, p. 105]
The authors of the cited paper continue with the observation that even experienced experts often believe that the paper is just about the SIR or SEIR equations.
Taking this criticism seriously, the present paper proposes a Kermack-McKendrick
type model adapted to Covid-19, which differs from the widely used S(E)IR models
and which we believe has a higher plausibility and applicability.

We do this with a slight modification of the original idea. We work with a discrete time parameter. After all, people are not participating in the spread of the
disease during all parts of a day, e.g.. when they are asleep. And also the data are
communicated on a daily basis. In addition discrete models are easy to program.
So we adapt the Kermack-McKendrick approach and replace functions depending
on a continuous time t by a functions depending on integers k.
We will describe the model in the next section and then explain the role of its
parameters (sections 1 and 2). Then we describe how one applies the model starting
from the empirical data and demonstrate the result for Germany (sections 3 and
4). We give a striking application showing what happens if people are sent earlier
to quarantine or hospital (section 5), before we discuss how vaccination, the rise of
new mutants and mass testing can be implemented in the model by a refinement
and extension of the recursion presented in the first section (section 6). Finally we
add some remarks on the relationship between the reproduction numbers as they
appear in our model to the ones given by the Robert-Koch-Institut for Germany
(section 9). At the end we discuss some aspects of our model and formulate a few
clear messages.
2. The model
We recall the often neglected fundamental idea fundamental idea of Kermack and
McKendrick following [8, 1, 2, 4]. As mentioned before we use the discrete setting
of the Kermack-McKendrick approach, which the original paper started with before
the continuous version was introduced as a limiting case. A central input of a
Kermack/McKendrick model is a function γ(j) which measures the medical strength
of infectivity of a person at day j counted from the moment on of infectivity. On this
basis the Kermack-McKendrick approach allows to derive equations which express
how many people are susceptible to the virus if one knows the mean contact rate of
the interaction of the population. To emphasize that γ is the central input we call
such a model a discrete γ-K-McK model.
If you want to construct a γ-K-McK-model the first thing to do is to look for
virological studies which determine γ(j) as closely as possible. This will depend on
the type of an epidemic. The closer the input function γ(j) is to the medical facts,
the more reliable is the model. As mentioned above, this function is all one needs
to model the number of susceptibles. But one is interested in other data like for
instance how many people are newly infected at day k. This is not determined by
γ alone. For this we look what happens when a person is infected in an epidemic.
After infection there are a few days where people are exposed, meaning that they
are already infected but not yet infectious. Then the period begins where a person
is infectious (we call them propagators) and after that in general may be considered
as immune. The period of both lengths is not sharp, varies from person to person

A DISCRETE KERMACK-MCKENDRICK MODEL

a bit. Our assumption in this paper is that this variation is small, meaning that
the functions which describe these lengths are nearly a jump function. With other
words we assume that after infection there are e days, where people are exposed,
meaning that they are already infected but not yet infectious. After that there are
pd days where a person is infectious and after that in general may be considered
as immune. There are indications that this is the case for Covid-19. If there is
an epidemic where this is not the case and one knows the functions which describe
the rate of the lengths for being exposed or propagating one can easily adapt our
model, but we don’t do this in this paper. We will discuss a special case of such a
function for the propagating people when we compare our model to the standard
SIR model. Amongst those who are infectious there are those who are positively
tested after pc < pd days on average, and then are confined to home isolation or
hospital. (We will explain the notation pd and pc later, for an example see fig. 1.)
Functions γ with only a finite number of days where they are non-zero are called
functions with finite support.
The γ-K-McK-models are flexible enough to allow for adding important additional
features of an epidemic like, e.g., unreported cases, vaccination, effects of testing and
of the rise of new mutants etc. Here we take up the first point only and discuss the
other points later.
The assumption of a finite support of γ fits with the following picture: At each
day the population can, in the model, be divided into disjoint subsets, called compartments, as follows:
– The compartment S of susceptible people to the disease with cardinality S(k)
at the day k. Here susceptible means not immunised, i.e. either recovered
or vaccinated.
– The compartment E of exposed people whose cardinality at the day k we
denote by E(k). By this we mean people who are infected but are not yet
infectious. The function γ determines the number e of days people stay in
compartment E as
e := min {j |γ(j) 6= 0} − 1 .
– The compartment P of propagators. These are people who are infectious
(they propagate the virus) but not yet in quarantine or isolation. We will
divide this into the following subcompartments:
The compartement Pc of “counted” propagators with cardinality Pc (k), these
are the infectious who will later be diagnosed, recorded and counted in the
statistics. As mentioned above the number of days people stay in this compartment is denoted by pc .
And the compartement Pd of “dark sector” propagators who are never reported as infected, the dark sector with cardinality Pd (k). The number of

4

M. KRECK, E. SCHOLZ

days people stay in this compartment is again derived from γ as the cardinality of its support:
pd := ] {j |γ(j) 6= 0}
– The compartment Q of persons who are diagnosed and set under quarantine
or isolated until recovery or death. The cardinality of this compartment is
Q(k) and the mean residence time is denoted by q. The members of Q are
essentially no longer infecting others, although they are still infectious in the
medical sense. The number Qnew (k) of daily new registered persons in Q is
a central datum for the epidemic.
– The compartment R of removed from the epidemic (recovered or dead) with
cardinality R(k).
For modelling an epidemic realistically in the γ-K-McK framework which also
includes the dark sector and accounts for changing contact rates one needs other
input parameters which have to be estimated from empirical data:
– We assume that for the infected persons leaving compartment E at any
day k there is a a certain fraction α(k) of people from E who move to
compartment Pc at the day k, whereas the fraction 1 − α(k) of people moves
to the compartment Pd of people in the dark sector.
– It could be that people in the dark sector are less infectious by a factor ξ ≤ 1,
so this has to be taken into consideration. A lot of them have no symptoms
which might indicate that they have lower viral load.
– Besides the medical function γ(j) for a certain epidemic one needs to know
a daily proportionality factor g called for simplicity the contact rate κ(k).
Now we explain the dynamics of the model which demonstrates the central role
of the function γ and the daily contact rate κ(k). The idea is that all people in
compartments Pc and Pd infect people from compartment S proportionally to the
strength of the infection given by γ and the contact rate κ(k). Here we note that
both functions γ and κ are dependent on the choice of a unit, but if we replace γ by
c γ we have to compensate this by replacing κ by κc . Another convention influencing
κ is to introduce s(k) := S(k)
, where N denotes the size of the population, which in
N
this paper we consider as constant.
To explain the dynamics in detail we denote the number of people who newly
entered compartment E at day k by Enew (k). In the situation when no vaccination
is available (we shall discuss the variants with vaccination in Section 7) it can be
expressed in terms of the function S as:
(1)

Enew (k) = S(k − 1) − S(k) .

Similarly we denote the number of people who newly entered compartment Pc at
day k by Pc,new (k) and similarly those who newly entered compartment Pd at day

A DISCRETE KERMACK-MCKENDRICK MODEL

k by Pd,new (k). We first explain the dynamics of those who are in compartment
Pc at the day k − 1. They are the disjoint union of people who newly entered this
compartment during the pc days before. So for each 1 ≤ j ≤ pc there are Pc,new (k−j)
people in Pc , who infect people who are in S at the day k − 1 with strength γ(j)
and proportional to the contact rate κ(k − 1).
From κ and γ one can read off the probability that a person who entered compartment Pc at day k −j infects a susceptible at day k −1, namely as κ(k−1)γ(j)
. This
N
implies that the overall probability involving all people who entered compartment Pc
at day k −j to infect a susceptible at day k −1 is 1−(1− κ(k−1)γ(j)
)Pc,new (k−j) [4, p. 4].
N
Often the linear approximation is used instead, which is κ(k−1)γ(j)
Pc,new (k − j). In
N
our situation the difference is negligible and so we use the linearisation instead. So
the contribution to the newly infected at day k − 1 by those people who entered
compartment Pc at day k − j is (for 1 ≤ j ≤ pc ).
s(k − 1)κ(k − 1)γ(j)Pc,new (k − j).
Similarly for the compartment Pd (for 1 ≤ j ≤ pd ) the contribution is
ξs(k − 1)κ(k − 1)γ(j)Pd,new (k − j).
Summing up we obtain the following equation expressing the dynamics of the epidemic:

If we were working in a continuous model, the sum would be an integral from 0
to pc .
Our aim is to derive from these inputs a single recursion equation for the number
of susceptible people at day k. For this we also express Pc,new and Pd,new in terms of
S. Namely after e days the newly exposed people at day k move to compartments
Pc and Pd with ratio α respectively 1 − α leading to the equations

two expressions on the right hand side of equation (2.

Using this and equations (1) - (6) we have finished the derivation of our model
equation.

of an epidemic is given by equation (2), the single recursive equation for the number
of susceptible people is

(12)
Qnew (k) = α(k − pc ) S(k − e − pc − 1) − S(k − e − pc ) .
Proof. We have given the proof of the recursion equation 7 before the proposition.
Since people stay in compartment E for e days before they move on to the compartment P we obtain:
E(k) = Enew (k) + Enew (k − 1) + · · · + Enew (k − e + 1)

= − S(k) − S(k − 1) + S(k − 1) − S(k − 2) + · · · + S(k − e + 1) − S(k − e)

We apply the same summation to the recognized propagating people,
Pc (k) = Pc,new (k) + Pc,new (k − 1) + · · · + Pc,new (k − pc + 1) ,
then one obtains (9), and the proof of (10) is the same. The proof of (11) is also
the same, once we have formula (12). For this we note that people newly entering

A DISCRETE KERMACK-MCKENDRICK MODEL

compartment Q at day k are the new people entering the compartment Pc at day
k − pc the compartment Pc :
Qnew (k) = Pc,new (k − pc )
and so by formula (3) we have
Qnew (k) = α(k − pc ) S(k − e − pc − 1) − S(k − e − pc )




We will give a more general version of our model involving the effects of vaccination,
testing a certain percentage of the population each day and of arising of new mutants
in section 7 (formula 23).
An important key figure of an epidemic is the daily reproduction number ρ(k).
This is defined as the average number of secondary infected people by one typical
primary infected (averaged over all infectious at the day k). Since there are no data
available from which one can directly read off the reproduction number the best
thing one can do is to derive it from a reliable model.
The reproduction numbers in the adapted K-McK-model are:
pc −1

(13)

ρ(k) =

X

s(k − 1 + j)κ(k − 1 + j)α(k − 1 + j) γ(j + 1)

j=0
pd −1

+

X

s(k − 1 + j)κ(k − 1 + j)(1 − α(k − 1 + j)) γ(j + 1)

j=0

For approximately constant values of α(k), s(k), κ(k) in the interval [k, k + pd ) this
boils down to a weighted average of the number of secondary infected by a person
entering Pc at day k and the analogous number for those entering Pd at the same
day.
Remark: The model is characterized by a delay structure which appears typically in
Covid-19. For example a change in the contact rates κ at a day k will be observable
in the numbers of daily new recorded infected Qnew only e + pc later (a sharp eye will
notice the time delay in fig. 3).
Similar models without dark sector and with a simple box-like function γ were
constructed and used in [11, 5, 15, 9].
3. The role of the parameters
If one wants to model an epidemic one has to find the appropriate parameters.
If for the sake of argument we abstract from the dark sector for a moment, there
are two types of parameters in the model: parameters that are of a medical nature
like the duration of the exposed people period e and the infectivity function γ(k),

8

M. KRECK, E. SCHOLZ

and those that can be influenced by the politicians, like the duration pc between
the onset of infectivity and the beginning of quarantine or isolation, or the daily
contact rate κ(k). Coming back to the dark sector, one has to know in addition
the ratio α between the later recorded people and the rest, and the duration pd of
the infectious phase of the dark people. Amongst these parameters we assume that
e and the strength function γ are essentially unchanged during the course of the
epidemic, as well as pc , pd and even α if we abstract from changes in the ratio due to
rising unspecific testing. The parameter which definitely changes over time is κ(k).
Observation: If we start with data for S(k) and keep all parameters fixed except
κ(k), then κ(k) is determined by equation (7) as the quotient of the left hand side
by the factor of κ(k) on the right side. With these κ(k) the data are identically
reproduced by the model. In turn if we start with arbitrary values of κ(k) this gives
us values S(k) if we assume constant values for α. So if we allow to read κ(k) off
from equation (7) we obtain a bijection between values S(k) and values κ(k). In
other words, if one allows daily changing values of κ(k) derived from the empirical
data the model is a tautology.
This holds for any input function γ whatsoever, also for continuous time t, in
particular for
(14)

γSIR (t) = λe−µt

which is the input for the SIR model [2]. This changes if one assumes constant
contact rates, or contact rates which are constant for some period and then are
changed by a certain factor to a new constancy level. Then the models cease to be
tautological. In the section 6 we will demonstrate this difference by comparing our
model with the SIR model.
Thus the choice of γ(k) is essential for obtaining a realistic model for Covid-19. In
principle it is given by medical data, more precisely by studies in which virologists
have measured the viral load of infected in the course of time, e.g. [16]. Simplifying
a bit, this leads to the following picture. The length of e is approximately 2 days,
so γ(j) = 0 for 1 ≤ j ≤ 2. Within another 2 days it reaches a maximum close to
the moment where symptoms show up, before it starts to decrease, slowly at the
beginning and then faster until, after about further 8 days, it reaches a value where
people are practically no longer infectious. This indicates that pd is 10. Curves
which show this increase and decrease for different infected persons are shown in
[16]; they allow to characterize a typical course of the strength of infectivity γ(k)
for Covid-19. A rough picture of the curve is given in [16] and from this we derive
the following table:

Right: Graph of γSIR with values for λ = 0.41, µ = 0.12 close to beginning
of Covid-19 in Germany according to [3, fig. 1]. For both cases cut-off after
20 days.

We remark that this is the point where one can see why in [2] the authors speak
about an“incessant misconception” if people apply the SIR-model indiscriminately
(and the situation is not so different for the SEIR model). The function γ(t) = λe−µt
– at least for Covid 19 – has nothing to do with the medical data observed by the
virologists. This may have considerable consequences for conditional predictions,
see section 8.
A model using the biological input function γ above will be called a K-McK-model
adapted to Covid-19, or for short an adapted K-McK-model. To specify such a model
one has to estimate three further parameters pc , α(k) and ξ.
The next parameter one has to chose is pc . It is difficult to estimate and depends
on the country and the action mode of the health institutions. For Germany it is
estimated between 5 and 8; where for the year 2020 officials of the health system
estimate it in the upper range. So we work with pc = 7. There are data that
indicate that the ratio of recorded infected α was about 0.25 for Germany at the
beginning of the epidemic, but changed to approximately 0.5 during the course of
the year, probably due to the increasing test rates [7]. Since the influence of the
dark sector was negligible in the first months we haven chosen α = 0.5 for the
whole period. Finally, it is difficult to estimate the relative strength of infectivity
ξ of the unrecorded infected from empirical data, so we take ξ = 1, i.e., we assume
that people in the dark sector (including the asymptomatic ones) are basically as
infectious as those in Pc .
4. From data to model curves
Now we have determined all parameters except the contact rate κ. In this paper
we are mainly interested in reproducing the curves, so we start from the data given
by the Humdata project of the Johns Hopkins University for 200 world countries and

10

regions.1 More precisely, we estimate the values for S(k) from the listed confirmed
cases and the ratio α. In this step the estimated time translation e + pc between the
times of infection and recording has to be taken into account. Moreover, there are
weekly fluctuations of the values of newly recorded cases (the first differences of the
data lists of confirmed cases) due to weekends where data taking and transmission is
usually slowed down considerably. Since we are interested in the central development
of the epidemic we replace the daily values of the newly recorded by 7-days averages
and also the values of the susceptible people S7 (k).
In the next step we compute the daily contact rates κ(k) according to the observation above. This allows one to give the tautological model picture of the values of
S7 (k) according to the observation above; but of course this is not what we want. We
therefore investigate the values of κ(k) and look for periods where they are more or
less stationary and can be approximated by a constant. Such time intervals may be
interpreted as periods where the behaviour of the population is roughly the same and
no crucial change of the virus occurs. The transition times between such stationary
phases seem to characterize periods in which the contact behaviour of the population changes. This is often the result of political measures (non-pharmaceutical
interventions) reducing the contacts or allowing more contacts, which in many cases
may lead to new levels where the contact rates can again be approximated by a
constant. Besides this, eyeballing will indicate further levels of near-constancy that
then need to be justified. For example, this explanation might be that the changed
contact rate is the result of a climate change from summer to winter where people
meet more in closed rooms, or the other way round. It could also be that the infectivity of the virus changes (e.g. by the rise of a more aggressive mutant). In our view
the most important criterion for the applicability of a Kermack/McKendrick type
model to a real life epidemic boils down to the question whether or not replacing
the contact rates during periods where they stay nearly constant by their averages,
or a value close to it inside the respective σ-interval, leads to a good approximation
of the data curves.
In the case of Germany one observes seven rather obvious periods between March
2020 and mid January 2021 in which the κ can be approximated by a constant, ignoring fluctuations (see fig. 2). Some of these constancy intervals can be interpreted
as results of interventions, others not: There was a series of three interventions in
March 2020 resulting in the first constancy interval from March 24, 2020, (= t1 )
to April 26 (= t2 ), a rather short interval. Around April 26 the interventions were
reduced and the result is a long period until July 3 (= t3 ). Already in this phase
people were presumably getting more careless, the vacation period started and the
contacts increased, which lead to the third period, lasting until September 27 (t4 ).

A DISCRETE KERMACK-MCKENDRICK MODEL

11

In this phase the mean reproduction rate rose noticeably above 1. With the beginning of the cooler temperature, life moving more to closed rooms, the reproduction
number rose to about 1.5 in the fourth interval until October 31 (t5 ). This provoked
new containment measures, at first at Oct. 16 and Nov. 2 which are reflected by the
fourth interval lasting until Nov. 26, in which the daily new infections went down.
They started to rise again, probably because of early Christmas shopping at Nov.
26 (t6 =). A partial lockdown (schools, restaurants, cultural activities) at December
16 (our t7 ) brought the reproduction rate below 1 and resulted in, on average, falling
numbers of new infections. This period lasts until the end of the data considered
here in mid January (Jan. 15).
The model values of the contact rates κj in the intervals [tj , tj+1 − ∆j+1 ] (1 ≤
j ≤ 7), with varying durations ∆j of the transition periods, are chosen close to the
mean values, with small deviations inside the σ-interval allowed if this improves the
fit considerably. The model κj and the (effective) model reproduction numbers ρj

parameters cannot be influenced by politicians, but the contact rates can. Moreover
there is another one that is highly dependent on social rules, namely the time pc
between the beginning of infectivity and quarantine. One could make attempts to
reduce this and check what happens if all other parameters are unchanged, including
the contact rate. If we assume that the contact rate is unchanged and we change the
value of pc this will change the model curve. This is clear without any model. But it
is one of the strengths of our model that the input parameters have a direct relation
to data; in particular pc shows up as a central parameter. For this reason a change
of pc results in a quantitative effect for the model curves. This effect is drastic.
The following graphic shows what, according to our model, would have happened
in Germany if from June 2020 on one would have reduced the time until quarantine
by even one day, from 7 to 6.
Whereas the actual number of new infections reported per day (7-day average) rose
to more than 25000 in December, the model predicts that the maximum would have
been a bit less than 5000 if the time until quarantine had been reduced in this way.
6. Comparison with the standard SIR model: An example
As memtioned in the beginning of section 2 we want to return to the paper
of Kermack and McKendrick and discuss a case, where there is not a sharp border
between being infectious (propagating) and recovery. This situation can be modelled
by a function b(j), the ratio of infectious persons at day j in relation to the first day.

Figure 4. Comparison of 7-day averages of recorded daily newly sent
to quarantine Qnew in Germany (JHU data, solid red) with model
values (black dashed) assuming a reduction of pc from 7 to 6; dark
sector with α = 0.5.
In addition one has the function ϕ(j) which measures the mean medical strength of
infectivity of a person still infectious at day j counted from the moment of infectivity
on (“rate of infectivity” in the terminology of Kermack-McKendrick). The product
of these functions γ(j) = ϕ(j)b(j) is in this context the function which measures the
strength of the infection. There is a similar version for continuous time t (cf. [1, eq.
(1)]). Kermack-McKendrick called ψ(t) = −b0 (t)/b(t) the “rate of recovery”.
In the widely used SIR model both, the rate of infectivity and the rate of recovery,
are assumed to be constant, ϕ(t) = α, and ψ(t) = β. This results in a pure
exponential decay for the function γ(t) = αe−βt . For Kermack-McKendrick this was
a very special case introduced close to the end of the paper only [8, p. 713]. It leads
to the well known standard SIR differential equations. For Covid 19, however, none
of the two the assumptions for the standard SIR is satisfied.
Alone this should make people hesitate to apply the standard SIR model to Covid19. But there are cases where a “bad” model is useful, perhaps even more useful than
a “better” model. We discuss now why we doubt this by comparing the model curves
using the standard SIR model with those of our model for Covid-19. To do this we
chose model parameters for both models so that at the beginning the two models are
approximatively equal. The standard SIR model is based on γ2 (t) = λe−µt (resulting
in the well known differential equations for SIR). We choose the start conditions of
the our γ-K-McK-model for Covid-19 such that they agree (approximately) with the
SIR-model during the first days (exact only at the origin). By construction of the
SIR-model the function I(t) of actually infected at time t is nearly an exponential
function as long as the function S is nearly constant and the contact rates are
unchanged.
But in reality jumps of the contact rates take place, for example as the result of
interventions. Models which are close to reality should behave equally if the contact
rate (which for the SIR-model corresponds to λ, and for the adapted model to κ) is

M. KRECK, E. SCHOLZ

changing by a certain percentage. Figure 5 shows that there is a drastic difference
between the functions I and Q which describe the number of infected respectively
counted as infected in the two models.

I(0) = 1000, λ1 = 0.15, µ1 = 0.1, κ1 = 0.256. Reduction of reproduction
rate by 40 % in both cases between days 49 and 51. Constant coefficients
for t ≤ 29 and t ≥ 31, beyond t = 31 change to λ2 = 0.6 · λ1 = 0.09, µ1 =
µ2 = 0.1; κ2 = 0.6 · κ1 = 0.15361.

These considerations show that the choice of the model may result in important
differences for modelling the development of the epidemic. This is already indicated
by the simpler γ-K-McK model using box function considered in [5, figs. 5, 6] and
[9, fig. 3]. Needless to add that we consider our γ-K-McK model more realistic for
Covid-19 than either the standard SIR approach or the box-shaped γ-K-McK model.
In adddition the figure shows clearly that the delay structure of the γ-K-McK
model leads to a smooth transition between the phases before and after the change
point, while for the SIR model the change is nearly a cusp.
7. Vaccination, new mutants, and mass testing
In this section we extend our model step by step to include the effects of vaccination, in addition new mutants and in further addition mass testing. Please note that
all our functions S(k), E(k) etc. have a new definition in this section and should
not be mixed up with the previous formulas.
Once the past and the expected future rates of daily vaccination are known or
estimated, it is simple to extend the model to take vaccination into account. If
Vnew (k) is the number of vaccinated persons on day k and V (k) the total number of
immunized by vaccination on day k,
Vnew (k) = V (k) − V (k − 1) ,
equ. (1) turns into
(15)

Enew (k) = S(k − 1) − S(k) − Vnew (k) .

A DISCRETE KERMACK-MCKENDRICK MODEL

15

The recursion equation (7) has to be amended accordingly by the additional summand Vnew (k) on the right hand side (see the Theorem below in the special case
ζ = 1 and β = 0) and the terms Pc and Pd have to be adapted:
pc


−S(k − j − e) − Vnew (k − j − e)
Making provision for the appearance of a new mutant of the virus with stronger
or weaker infectivity is slightly more involved. If we assume that the function of infectivity changes only up to a time dependent scalar factor ζ(k), with k the epidemic
time scale, γ(j) (as above j denotes here the day after the onset of infectivity) has
to be replaced by
ζ(k) γ(j) .
In this way the coefficient of the right hand side of eq. 7 is enriched by the factor
ζ(k) (see eq. 23).
Now we consider (in addition to vaccination and new mutants) reliable unspecific daily mass testing of a specified subset Mt (with cardinality Nt ) of the total
population M (with cardinality N ). Such testing may be realistic if based on new
generation sequencing proposed in [10, 14]. We denote the complement of Mt by
Mn-t and assume that the decomposition M = Mt ∪ Mn-t is kept fix over the whole
period of testing. To simplify the considerations we assume that testing takes place
all the times every day and is error free (sensitivity 100% and specificity 100%). If
in applications the testing starts later, or takes place on selected days a week only,
one has to modify the algorithm appropriately. We call β := Nt /N the test ratio.
Assuming that the tests are reliable implies that there is no dark sector within Mt .
Moreover we assume that the test is sensitive from day l of the period of infection
on. A positively tested person is assumed to be sent to quarantine on the following
day.
We further assume perfect contact mixing between M t and Mn-t . If we denote
the number of newly infected at day k amongst people in the tested group Mt by
Et,new (k) and in the non-tested group by En-t,new (k), we have:
(18)

Et,new (k) = β Enew (k) ,

En-t,new (k) = (1 − β) Enew (k) ,

where Enew (k) is given by formula (15).
Now we count the number Pt (k) of persons from Mt (k) who are effectively propagating the virus under the test regime on day k. Since it takes at most l days until

16

M. KRECK, E. SCHOLZ

a newly infectious person is either positively or negatively tested we obtain:
(19)

Pt (k) =

l
X

Et,new (k − e − j + 1)

j=1

This formula has to be amended for weekly tests cycles in which tests are not take
daily but only on specified week days.
We define Qt (k) as the number of persons from Mt (k) who are in quarantine
or isolation on day k. Observing that the quarantine starts the day after positive
testing we find for the number of persons newly sent to quarantine on day k:
(20)

Qt,new (k) = Et,new (k − e − l)

The corresponding number for the people who are not tested is
(21)

Qn-t,new (k) = α(k − pc )(1 − β) Enew (k − e − pc) ,

where again Enew (k) is given by formula (15).
Next we define
l
X

Pt (k − 1) = β
(22)
γ(j) Enew (k − e − j)
,

j=1

where Enew (k) is given by formula (15).
This number counts only the propagating people who are tested (those in Mt );
the corresponding number for those who are are not tested (those from Mn-t ) has
to be added. It is essentially given by 16 and 17, but the expressions have to be
multiplied by the factor (1 − β), i.e. the percentage of non-tested.
This allows to formulate our final result including the effects of vaccination, new
mutants and mass testing as described above
Theorem. If we take vaccination, the rise of new mutants and unspecific mass
testing like above into account, the central recursion of our model becomes
(23) S(k − 1) − S(k) = Vnew (k − 1) +


s(k − 1) κ(k − 1) ζ(k − 1) Pt (k − 1) + (1 − β)[Pc (k − 1) + Pd (k − 1)] ,
where Pt is given by formula (22), Pc by (16), and Pd by (17).
The number of daily new detected infected by testing is given by equation (20),
the ones in the non-tested ensemble by equation (21). So the total number of new
detected infected is
(24)

Qnew (k) = β Enew (k − e − l) + α(k − pc )(1 − β) Enew (k − e − pc) ,

where Enew (k) is given by formula (15).

A DISCRETE KERMACK-MCKENDRICK MODEL

17

Equation (7) is, of course, the special case of equation 23 with ζ(k) = 1, β = 0,
and Vnew (k) = 0 (for all k).
In this case the method for determining the empirical values for the κ(k) described
in the Observation above finds the values of the product κ(k)ζ(k) rather than κ(k)
itself. The latter can be isolated by correcting for the factor ζ(k), which is to be
determined from the data.
In the following we apply this theorem and study the effect of mutants, of vaccination and a scenario of mass testing for Germany.
In the German case, we know that the share of infections carrying the mutant
B.1.1.7, determined by genetic sequencing, rose approximately in a linear progression from roughly 6% in calendar week (CW) 4, the last week of January 2021, to
approximately 70% in CW 10 and 88% in CW 12 [13]. As we understand, the sequencing data evaluate the probes of infections which occurred about a week earlier;
we therefore time translate the sequencing data 7 days backward (fig 6, blue dots).
We may safely assume that about 2 or 3 weeks after CW 10, i.e. in early April,
B.1.1.7 will be dominating the infections observed in Germany.

Figure 6. Left: Scaling function ζ(k) (blue line) with c = 1.3 (left),
c = 1.5 (middle) and c = 1.7 (right)) for the infectivity of the mixture of
“old” virus and new mutants, mainly B.1.1.7 in Germany. The ratio of
B.1.1.7 as given in [13], backward time translated by 7 days and weighted
by c, is shown by series of blue dots.

We look for a datum where the transition begins, a duration of the transition and
an upscaling factor c which describes the new value of γ after the transition and a
“natural” function which describes the transition in such a way that, after a time
where it is nearly constant and equal to 1, it changes quickly into a nearly linear
function and then becomes nearly constant equal to c. There is a well known C ∞
function, the so called transition function,
f (x)
g(x) :=
,
f (x) + f (1 − x)
where
n e− x1 for x > 0
f (x) =
0
for x ≤ 0 .

18

M. KRECK, E. SCHOLZ

The characteristic of this function is that it is 0 for x ≤ 0 and 1 for x ≥ 1. It stays
close to 0 for a while for x near 0 and close to 1 for a while for x near 1 and in
between it changes quickly into an almost linear function. So it fits well with the
observation of the progression of the mutant. This function describes a transition
which during a time interval of length 1 raises the level from 0 to 1. Adding 1 and
adjusting the time duration from 1 to d and the up-scaling factor from 1 to c leads
to the function

ζc,d (x) = 1 + (c − 1)g
.
d
with the desired properties of rescaling γ by the factor c within d days. The date of
the beginning of the transition and the duration d as well as the up-scaling factor
c are roughly known from sequencing data. B.1.1.7 was first identified in Germany
in late December 2020 and the sequencing data of [13] show that the transition
ends in early April 2021. According to the virological estimates the final scaling
factor is constrained by 1.3 ≤ c ≤ 1.7. For constraining it more narrowly we
investigate the effects of the choice of c on the rise of κ(k) in early March (see
fig. 7). For c = 1 or c = 1.3 the resulting rise of κ(k) (fig. 7, top) is too high to be
plausible, as no relaxing was announced by the German authorities and the majority
of the population accepted the restriction measures issued in December 2020 quite
patiently. In early March a partial opening of shops was permitted and a slightly
disorganized discourse started on possible relaxation of restrictions, which might be
acceptable if combined with an increase of unspecific testing. This is sufficient for
explaining a moderate rise of κ at the beginning of March by 5 - 10 %, as we find it
for c ≈ 1.5 (fig. 7, bottom left). The hypothesis c ≈ 1.7 appears again implausible
as it would indicate that the early March discourse was without any effect on the
contact rate (fig. 7, bottom right).
Summing up, we obtain a consistent and plausible choice for the beginning of
the transition at December 28, 2020, a duration d ≈ 100 and an up-scaling factor
c = 1.5.
If we now factor in the available data on vaccinations in Germany,2 we can analyse
the impact of vaccination on the course of the epidemic in Germany. Figure 8 shows

In fig. 9 one can inspect the change of the effective reproduction numbers for Germany in early 2021 (data available until end of March) and an outlook on the future
months April and May under the assumption of no essential changes in the contact

induced by the infections.

09, 2021). Black: model ρ(k); dashed basic scenario, dotted the boundaries

We would like to demonstrate the strong effect of the vaccination by showing the
catastrophic rise of daily new infections without vaccination, assuming no essential
change of contact behaviour of the German population (in comparison with March
2021). During April the number of daily new infections would rise above 100.000,
see fig. 10, dotted pink curve. But because of the ongoing vaccinations our model
lets us expect the local maximum of the third wave for daily new infections at
the turn from April to May 2021 with values (7-day averages) about 25 000 (black
dashed; dotted the boundaries of the 1 sigma interval for the empirical κ(k) in the
last constancy interval). Note that the data available on April 09, 2021, are subject
to an artificial drop of Qnew (k) induced by the Easter days (April 2–5); this leads
to additional uncertainties in the data evaluation and conditional predictions. In
any case the figures 9 and 10 demonstrate the important role of the vaccinations
for turning the tide of the epidemic in Germany during the months April and May
2021.
Finally we apply our theorem for studying the effectiveness of mass testing techniques, e.g., by new generation sequencing proposed in [10, 14]. The question is how
fast testing on a daily basis of a certain subset M t can be expected to suppress an
epidemic of the Covid-19 type. We model here an ideal mass test (sensitivity and
specificity both 100%) of a fixed subset M t containing 60% of the total population
on a daily basis, starting on October 15, 2020. Moreover we even assume (counterfactually) that the contact regime of early October is not being changed by further
restrictive measures later in the year, while the effects of vaccinations and the rise
of the new mutant B.1.1.7 since late December 2020 have been included.

In other words, we use the right hand side (rhs) of eq. 7 for t < Oct 15 with
the contact coefficients of the German model and the rhs of eq. (23) with constant
contact coefficient κ4 (see sec. 4). Using the characteristic function ftest (t) = χ[t, J]
of the interval J = [ta , ∞) the recursion is then

Figure 11 shows the suppression of Qnew (k) which are to be expected in terms of
our model calculation.
It demonstrates a high in-principle effectiveness of such an approach, although in
an idealised scenario. Under a test regime similar to the one above the rise of the
new mutant would only lead to a slight increase of registered new infections starting
in early March 2021. But it would be held below roughly 1000 by the increase of
vaccinations in April and May (with actual data on vaccination for Germany). We
have checked that for a moderately reduced reliability of the test with a ratio of 0.9
recognized infectious persons (sensitivity 90%) and daily testing the picture would
not change significantly (the number of false positive tested for genetic screening
tests is expected to be extremely low; specificity 1 with extremely high precision).
We would like to remark that the effect of mass testing has a similar effect as
the shortening of the time between the offset of symptoms and sending people to

particular effective way to shorten this period for a certain part of the population.
8. Comparison of reproduction numbers
The Robert Koch-Institut (RKI), Berlin, publishes the daily data for an epidemic
in Germany and determines the daily reproduction numbers from these data. The
RKI calculation uses a method described in [6] for a stochastic estimation of the
numbers of newly infected, called E(t), from the raw data of newly reported cases,.
The calculation of the reproduction numbers works with these E(t) and assumes
constant generation time and serial intervals of equal lengths τg = τs = 4 [12].
Two versions of reproduction numbers are being used, a day-sharp and therefore
E(t)
, and a weekly averaged one,
“sensitive” one ρrki, 1 (t) = E(t−4)

which we refer to in the following simply as ρRKI (t).
The paper remarks that the RKI reproduction numbers (“R-values”) ρRKI (u) indexed by the date u of calculation refer to a period of infection which, after taking the
incubation period ι between 4 and 6 days into account, lies between u − 16, . . . , u − 8
(with central day u − 12 in the interval). The reproduction numbers calculated in
the adapted K-McK approach are very close to the RKI reproduction numbers. The
main differences lie in the usage of different raw data bases (RKI versus JHU) and
the adjustment of the raw data (stochastic redistribution E(t) versus sliding 7-day

averages Q̂new,7 ). After a reasonable time shift the agreement between the reproduction numbers of the adapted γ-K-McK approach and the ρRKI (k) are close. The
stochastic smoothing of the RKI data seem to lead to smaller amplitudes of the
fluctuations which otherwise are in striking coincidence (fig. 12).

9. Discussion
We formulate four points with regard to the adapted K-McK-model, which at
present seem the most important ones to us.
(1) A model has to be useful for analysing an epidemic on the basis of the available
data. The most important data for this purpose are the daily newly infected; but one
is interested in other numbers also, like the number of actually counted as infected
or those in hospital, or how many people are actually infectious or how many people
are already immune (keyword: herd immunity). In particular one is interested in
the daily reproduction number (see formula (13). All these numbers are given by
our model. Knowing these numbers is an important information for the politicians
as well as for citizens. For politicians such numbers are the basis to think about
regulations and for citizens this information is a helpful guide for how to behave.
The present model is a useful tool for determining key figures of an epidemic
like the reproduction number and the number of people in quarantine or hospital.
(2) A reliable model can do more. The optimum would be that it allows to predict
the future. But in the strict sense this is impossible, since important parameters
like the contact rate changes depending on the behaviour of the population. If
one knows the development of the epidemic in the past (in terms of a model) and
assumes that the contact rate is not changing drastically, it is possible to extrapolate

24

M. KRECK, E. SCHOLZ

the development for some time. We indicate how this may be done by looking at
the situation in Germany at the beginning of April 2020. In a series of preliminary
steps a lockdown was imposed on March 22. Only a few days later it pushed the
reproduction number below 1, and about a week later down to about ρ = 0.7 (see
fig. 2). It fluctuated about that number for roughly a month. This was observable
in the data about a fortnight later, so that around April 10 the number was stable
already for about a week. If at that moment one would assume that the behaviour of
the population is not changing very much, one could use the model for predicting the
future during the next weeks quite successfully until the contact rate was changing
substantially. Figure 3 shows how well this worked until the end of April when
the restrictions were partially relaxed and the reproduction number rose. In other
words:
The adapted K-McK-model is a reliable tool for extrapolating the development
in times where the reproduction number is stable and there are reasons to
assume that this stays so for a while.
At the beginning of the epidemic there was no experience what the effect of interventions would be. But over the time there was a chance of using the model for
observing the effects and, if possible, to draw realistic conclusions. A quantitative
estimate of the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions in terms of the
change of contact rates (or reproduction numbers) determined in the model framework is a delicate point. But keeping this in mind, a realistic model like the adapted
K-McK-model may be used heuristically for deriving useful information about how
certain interventions will influence the development by comparison with other ones
in the past which took place under similar conditions. Like any realistic model
the present one may be used as a tool for learning how certain interventions under
specified conditions (like climate) influence the development. This was also tried in
[3] for the three interventions in Germany in March 2020, claiming a direct relation
between each of these and a new level of the reproduction number. In the light of
the data evaluation represented in figure (2) we are not able to confirm this result.
In the decline of the contact rates, respectively reproduction numbers, in Germany
during March 2020 no clear intermediate steps can be discerned which could be read
as the signature of the first two interventions. To assume the existence of constancy
intervals between two non-pharmaceutical interventions per se seems doubtful to us.
In this phase we only see a cumulative effect of all three interventions.
On the other hand, if the data evaluation shows a relative stability of the contact
rate κ(k), a conditional prediction for the coming development is possible, sometimes even for several weeks. “Conditional” means here under the assumption of
no essential change of the behaviour of the people, relative stability of climatic conditions and no mutation of the virus. In section 4 time intervals in which such
conditional predictions could be made have been discussed. For example one could

recognize a stable trend of increasing numbers of daily new infected for Germany
already in late July and early August 2020 and could have foreseen the approach of
the second wave long before autumn (see fig. 3, bottom, and table in Section 4).
(3) As conditional predictions with the present model turn out to be convincing
and reliable we also consider future scenarios for the overall development of the epidemic for up to a few months as informative. For an example scenario which can be
checked against the real course of the epidemic see end of section 7. Such scenarios
may be helpful for exploring alternatives of actions (e.g. non-pharmaceutical interventions) and for identifying necessary steps to avoid the breakdown of the health
system.
The study of future scenarios with the γ-K-McK model may be useful for
persons or institutions looking for orientation with regard to alternatives for
actions and/or external changes of condition (rise of new mutants, climate
change).
(4) As we have seen there is a parameter which can, in principle, be influenced
by socio-political decisions comparatively easily, the time between infection and the
day people go to quarantine. We therefore emphasize again:
The model shows that reducing the time until entering quarantine by one day
leads to a drastic improvement.
Whether one can reduce it depends on various factors, in particular the infrastructure and effectiveness of the health system. Discussions with experts about the
German health system have convinced us that there are good chances for lowering
the time until quarantine by at least one day. Of course this needs a great effort:
One has to enable the health system to carry it out and one has to convince the population to follow the corresponding rules. But the latter should have good chances
since this is a restriction which hits only a small number of the population: those
who show first symptoms or are identified as Covid-positive in an unspecified test.
(5) A comparison between different models is difficult. If models are based on
clear principles the first thing one could do is to compare the principles and discuss
their strength and weakness. If one wants to compare the standard SIR model with
our adapted model this is simplified by the fact that they are both based on the same
principle, the Kermack-McKendrick idea of a central input parameter, a function
γ which measures the medical strength of the infection. So this comparison boils
down to comparing the two input functions. And there it is obvious that both input
functions differ very much (see figure 1), and since the γ for the adapted model
is based on virological studies it has to be considered more realistic. But it could
be that the models are so robust that this difference doesn’t play a big role. This
is actually the case as long as one keeps the contact rate as well as the number
of susceptible people approximately constant. Then for both models the number
of people counted as infected are approximately exponential functions and so after

26

adjusting the parameters the models are essentially equivalent. But this changes
if the contact rate jumps in a short time to a new constancy level. Then both
models differ drastically as we demonstrate in figure 5. And then the model with
the more realistic input function γ is clearly the first choice. The same happens
if one looks at the long term behaviour where the number of susceptible people
changes considerably.
Saying this, one should not forget that no model is a mirror of reality. It can
even happen that a model based on less realistic principles may work better, but
so far we don’t see a sign of this in the comparison of the adapted model with the
standard SIR model. So we conclude:
Our comparison of the adapted model with the standard SIR model indicates
that the former one is based on more realistic assumptions. Since the differences in the long run or when the contact rates jump are large, the adapted
model should be the first choice.
