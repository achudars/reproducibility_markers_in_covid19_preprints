Abstract: In this paper, we propose a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) structure based
on Kretschmann configuration incorporating layers of Silicon and BaTiO3 on top of Ag for
real-time detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using thiol
tethered DNA as ligand. Extensive numerical analysis based on transfer matrix theory as well as
finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) technique has been performed to characterize the sensor
response considering sensitvity, full width at half maxima and minimum reflection. About 7.6
times enhanced sensitivity has been obtained using the proposed architecture for SARS-CoV-2
detection, compared to the basic Kretschmann configuration. Notably, the structure provides
consistent enhancement over other competitive SPR structures for both angular and wavelength
interrogations with a figure-of-merit of 692.28. Additionally, we repeated simulations for various
ligate-ligand pairs to assess the range of applicability and robust performance improvement has
been observed. As a result, the proposed sensor design provides a suitable configuration for
highly sensitive, rapid, non-invasive biosensing which can be useful if adopted in experimental
sensing protocols.

Introduction

Real-time detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with
high sensitivity in a non-invasive manner is a critical research arena during this pandemic of
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [1]. Since its emergence in December, 2019 in Wuhan,
China, the devastating rapid transmission and havoc caused by this virus has resulted in the World
Health Organization (WHO) classifying this outbreak as a pandemic on March 12, 2020 [2]. As
per the report on Aug 6, 2020, no. of confirmed cases has soared upto 18,614,177, with a death
toll of 702,642 [3]. With no proven medication or vaccines in sight still for COVID-19, significant
research endeavors have focused on early diagnosis and management to control the damage [4].
The laboratory standard detection scheme is reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain
reaction (RT-qPCR), which attempts to identify the presence of nucleic acid-based genetic
sequence of this virus [4]. However, RT-qPCR takes at least 3 h and requires sophisticated
testing facilities [5] in addition to suffering from false positives. To cope with the rapid spread
of COVID-19, highly sensitive diagnostic methods without requiring extensive lab setup is of
utmost importance. Another promising diagnostic method is Computed Tomography (CT) scan

where multiple chest X-rays are captured across different angles to obtain three-dimensional (3D)
images. But the challenge using such technique lies in being able to differentiate symptoms from
other lung disorders, failure in doing so results in rather low specificity of around 25% [6] in
practice. Apart from these, other methods include biochemical tests targeting the viral protein
or the antibodies and contact tracing [1]. Recently, Seo et al. proposed a field-effect transistor
based sensor topology for SARS-CoV-2 detection from human nasopharyngeal swabs [5]. While
such sensing mechanisms are being explored, there is still an urgent demand for ultra-sensitive,
real-time, point-of-care diagnostic methods to further aid the practitioners in fighting against
COVID-19. To that end, one potential domain is the usage of optical biosensors [7–9]. They
are preferable due to high selectivity and sensitivity, rapid response time, cost-effectiveness and
multiplexing capabilities.
In terms of optical biosensors, plasmonics is an attractive field with real-time and label-free
detection features. Commercially available surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and localized
surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) sensors have been used for disease [10] as well as viral
strains detection such as SARS, MERS and influenza [1]. Taking into account the promise of
plasmonic sensors for detection purposes, Qiu et al. [11] have developed a biosensor combining
plasmonic photothermal (PPT) effect and LSPR for COVID-19 diagnosis. They utilize DNA
receptors which selectively bond with RNA sequences from the SARS-CoV2 through nucleic
acid hybridization. One of the key challenges of accurate detection using such plasmonic sensors
is ensuring ultra-sensitive performance with excellent limit of detection. Along those lines,
SPR sensing is the most mature and established technology providing very good resolution of
detection. However, it is pivotal to numerically analyze the suitability of deploying such SPR
sensors for detecting SARS-CoV2 and a proper sensor configuration is required to achieve desired
level of performance. This motivates our study in this paper where we propose an SPR sensor
configuration aiming towards SARS-CoV2 detection with high sensitivity and figure-of-merit. To
enhance the overall sensor performance, we integrate layers of Si and BaTiO3 on top of the metal
layer (Ag). Thiol-tethered DNA has been used as receptor for sensing. The proposed sensing
pipeline assumes collection of samples from human nasopharyngeal swabs and passing them
through the sensing channel in a liquid solution while the sensor is illuminated from different
angles. When the binding occurs between immobilized receptor on sensor surface and target
biomolecules from the flowing sample, a shift in SPR angle is observed the extent of which
determines the sensitivity. Our transfer matrix based analysis corroborated with finite-difference
time-domain (FDTD) simulation shows that the proposed sensor architecture is able to obtain
very high sensitivity with low minimum reflection (Rmin) and improved figure-of-merit (FOM)
compared to other reported results. Furthermore, we verified the robustness of the sensor design
through analyzing its performance for other ligand-ligate combinations.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows- section 2 contains the design considerations
and modeling schemes for different layers, then the optimization of the sensor configuration is
described in section 3, we analyze the results in detail and perform comparative analysis with
regards to other proposed sensors in section 4 and the paper is concluded in section 5.

Design considerations and theoretical modeling of proposed structure

The schematic view of our proposed high sensitivity SPR biosensor configuration is shown in
Fig. 1. This novel hetero structure, as shown in the figure, is composed of 5 different layers. We
use BK7 glass as a coupling prism followed by a Ag layer. Ag has been proven to demonstrate
better sensitivity as a substrate layer due to higher SPR ratio [12]. However, one of the major
drawbacks of using Ag is its lesser chemical stability due to oxidation while interacting with
bio molecules [12, 13]. In our proposed design, we overcome this problem by employing 3
layers comprising of Si, BaTiO3 and Thiol tethered DNA respectively, on top of Ag. Such
configuration also aids in sensitivity enhancement. In recent research, Si has shown good promise

Fig. 1. Schematic illustration of the proposed structure

in improving sensitivity [14]. Si’s ability to enhance the electric field intensity of excitation light
plays major role behind this sensitivity increment [15, 16]. BaTiO3 also has desirable effects on
sensitivity due to its high dielectric constant. Together with low dielectric loss, it has potential to
contribute significantly to enhance sensitivity of our proposed structure [17]. Thiol tethered DNA
is used as a ligand layer for sensing medium as it has shown excellent properties as a receptor of
SARS-Cov-2 [11, 18]. Having decided on the composition of various layers of our sensor design,
the next step is to model them properly to simulate their response. We model each layer as a
homogeneous continuous medium upto the next layer interface wherein the layer is represented
by its refractive index. Hence, the next subsection focuses on modeling the refractive indices of
the layers under consideration.
2.1.

Modeling of layers

The refractive indices of different layers of our structure are each calculated separately. The first
layer is a coupling prism of BK7 glass. The refractive index of BK7 glass can be calculated from
the following relation [19]:
n1 = (

1
0.231792344λ2
1.01046945λ2
1.03961212λ2

λ − 0.00600069867 λ − 0.0200179144 λ − 103.560653

(1)

where λ is the wavelength of incident light in micrometer. This equation is only applicable for
wavelength between 0.37 to 2.5 um [20]. The refractive index of Ag layer can be defined using
the well-known drude model for metal [21],
nm = (1 −

λ 2 λc
)2,
2
λ p (λc + iλ)

(2)

where λ p = 1.4541 × 10−7 m and λc = 1.7614 × 10−5 m are plasma and collision wavelength for
Ag, respectively. The next layer of our proposed structure is silicon, the refractive index of which
is defined as [16]:
−λ
−λ
nSi = A1 + A2 e t0 + A3 e t1 ,
(3)
where λ is the wavelength of the incident light in um, A1 = 3.44904, A2 = 2271.88813, A3 =
3.39538, t0 = 0.058304 and t1 = 0.30384. The experimentally obtained refractive index data
for BaTiO3 at our operating wavelength is 2.4043 [22]. Finally, thickness dependent refractive

index data of Thiol tethered DNA is obtained from experimental results [23]. With the proper
models of various layers, we now need to characterize the optical response of the sensor for
which suitable optical excitation through appropriate irradiation is required first. This begets our
next discussion on input lighting scheme.
2.2.

Illumination strategy

The choice of operating wavelength needs to be well balanced between sensitivity and optical
non-linearity. Sensitivity and optical non linearity both are proportionally varied with frequency
(inversely proportional to wavelength) [12]. Optical Kerr effect becomes prominent if the
frequency of operation is increased such that the beam intensity is on the order of 1 GW cm−2
and exerts significant variations in refractive index [24]. We select operating wavelength as 633
nm such that sensitivity is enhanced with minimum possible Kerr effect [12, 24]. We employ
p-polarised light in Attenuated Total Internal Reflection (ATR) configuration in our analysis. In
this case, the incident angle must be greater than the critical angle θ c of glass-silver interface
n Ag
where, θ c = n Air
. If we assume energy loss other than material absorption to be zero, then
according to principle of energy conservation, the total of absorption(A), transmission (T) and
reflection(R) must be equal to 1 (i.e., A+T+R = 1). Again, since transmission is zero under ATR,
absorption reduces to A = 1-R. When surface plasmons (SPs) are excited, reflection becomes
minimum. As a result, this leads to the maximum transfer of light energy to the evanescent wave.
With the structural and illumination setup discussed above, next it is important to formulate a
theoretical framework to numerically evaluate the sensor performance, this leads to our following
section on numerical modeling.
2.3.

Theoretical framework

We have performed numerical analysis to determine the change of reflectivity using transfer
matrix method [25] and Fresnel equation [26] for basic Kretschmann configuration having
multiple layers. Our proposed model consists of five layers with BK7 prism, silver, Silicon,
Barium titanate and thiol tethered DNA being placed in parallel one after another. The thickness
of each layer varies in perpendicular direction denoted as z-axis. The boundary condition at the
interface of first two layers and the last two layers are considered as Z = Z1 = 0 and Z = Zn−1
respectively. The dielectric constant( p ) of p’th layer equals to the square of its refractive index
(n p ). These methods adopt no approximation allowing them to give accurate results rapidly.
The transfer matrix expresses a relationship among the tangential components of electric and
magnetic fields of the first layer and the last layer, and the relation is given as [27] 

where, E1 and B1 are tangential components of electric and magnetic fields respectively in the

coefficients are dependent. For TM polarized light it can be expressed as,

From the above equations, we can derive that the total reflection coefficient(r p ) as,

,
(M11 + M12 γ N )γ1 + (M21 + M22 γ N )

(6)

where, M11, M12, M21, M22 are the components of the transfer matrix. The reflectivity (Rp ) for a
TM polarized light is calculated as |r p | 2 .
We also utilize FDTD method to analyze our structure in order to further strengthen the
validity of our investigation. In FDTD, we consider meshing so that it can reach convergence
with sufficient precision without making the simulation unnecessarily lengthy. It simulates
each layer with corresponding complex refractive index at the respective wavelength. We apply
perfectly matched layer (PML) boundary condition along the direction of light incidence and
bloch boundary condition in the direction perpendicular to it. With the structural setup and
numerical framework as discussed above at hand, next we need to define some standard evaluation
criteria to quantify the performance of our design which leads to our next section.
2.4.

Performance parameters

To evaluate the performance of SPR biosensor, several criteria can be utilized such as Sensitivity
(S), Minimum reflectance (Rmin) and full width at half maximum (FWHM). These parameters
can be obtained from the curve of incident angle versus reflection. To analyze the sensing
performance and compare with other novel structures, we defined Figure of Merit (FOM) as
follows,
S
.
(7)
FOM =
FW H M × Rmin
Minimum reflectance is defined as the reflectance at the surface plasmon resonance angle. To
increase the detection accuracy, the value of the Rmin should be as low as possible. Resolution
and signal to noise ratio (SNR) are dependent on FWHM. FWHM is characterized as the spectral
width of SPR curve at half maxima. The most crucial parameter is the sensitivity of the sensor
which is the characteristic parameter of a sensor that transforms a device into a sensor. It can be
observed by monitoring the shift of the resonance angle of SPR curve due to the change in the
refractive index of the sensing medium. Quantitively, it can be calculated from the following
equation,
δθ S PR
S=
,
(8)
δnres
where θ S PR is the SPR angle and nr es is the refractive index of the corresponding target molecule.
While sensitivity determies the characteristic response of a sensor, the true performance of it
cannot be evaluated on sensitivity solely. Therefore, for a more comprehensive analysis, we
consider FOM taking into account the overall effect of S, FWHM and Rmin as mentioned before.
3.

Optimization of the structure

As mentioned earlier, there are 5 different layers in our proposed architecture, each layer has
significant impact on the overall sensor performance. Therefore, to harness the maximum
response out of our sensor configuration, proper optimization of design parameters needs to
be performed in a synergistic manner. Here, we follow layerwise optimization procedure as
outlined in [28]. First, we investigate sequentially the effects of each layer thickness on different
performance parameters of the sensor. For this process, we determine the reflectivity as a function
of incident angle using Eqn. 6. The minimum value of the reflectivity is termed as Rmin. We

also calculate sensitivity as a function of incident angle utilizing Eqn. 8. Our goal is to make
Rmin as low as possible while keeping the sensitivity as high as possible. For this purpose, each
layer thickness is optimized one at a time keeping the thickness of all other layers fixed. Initially,
we set the thickness of Si, BaTiO3 , Thiol layers at some arbitrary values and optimize Ag layer
thickness to get minimum Rmin and maximum sensitivity. Then the same process is repeated
for other layers as well based on sensitivity and Rmin. After that, we optimize the Ag thickness
again with optimized thickness of Si, BaTiO3 and Thiol thickness. This optimization process is
continued in an iterative manner until we get the most optimized structure possible. In Fig. 2(a),
we show dependence of Rmin and sensitivity of the sensor against the thickness variation of Ag.
Rmin gradually decreases with increasing thickness up to a certain thickness and then it starts
increasing. Similar trend holds true for sensitivity as well but in opposite direction. We see that
optimum thicknesses for minimum Rmin and maximum sensitivity are very close. Based on the
obtained results, we select 50 nm as Ag thickness for our structure. Notably, our numerically
optimized metal thickness matches well with theoretically obtained optimized value for metal
layer as described in [29]. Figures 2(b), (c) and (d) show the effect of Si, BaTiO3 and thiol layer
thickness variations on Rmin and sensitivity, respectively. For Si, the variation pattern follows
more or less same fashion as Ag. After 8 nm there is a drastic increase in Rmin. So, we choose
8 nm for Si thickness which gives maximum sensitivity with minimal Rmin. For BaTiO3 , we
select 11 nm as thickness for the same reason. Thiol optimization curve is quite different. Rmin
was very low and fairly constant until 3 nm of thiol thickness, after which it starts increasing
exponentially. However, the sensitivity peaks just before 4 nm. As a result, we opt for 4 nm
as thiol thickness to attain the best compromise between low Rmin and high sensitivity in our
proposed structure.

Results and discussions

As mentioned in previous sections, the structure presented in this work consists of 5 layers.
The fifth and final layer is the sensing layer the refractive index(ns ) of which will vary based
on the sample attachment. These variations lead to the change in the resonance angle of SPR
curve. From such variations, we obtain the sensitivity of the sensor according to Eqn. 8. Though
sensitivity is the characteristic parameter for SPR bio-sensor’s performance, other parameters
such as Rmin, FWHM etc. have significant effect on the overall detection accuracy. Here, we
will analyze our design based on different performance parameters and compare with other novel
structures. We will also study the robustness of our sensor with different ligand-ligate pairs.
4.1.

Performance analysis

The performance of a sensor is determined by sensing accuracy as well resolution. For SPR
biosensor, resolution depends on FWHM of the reflectivity curve. The narrower the curve and
hence lower FWHM, the better the resolution is. On the other hand, sensing accuracy depends
on Rmin and sensitivity of the device. In Fig. 3a we show the SPR curve for two different
refractive index of the sensing layer. We see that for a slight increase of refractive index, there is
a noticeable variation in the resonance angle. This gives a sensitivity as high as 130.3 deg/RIU
which is 7.6 times higher than the conventional Kretschmann configuration. In Fig. 3b and
Fig. 3c, we plot the coupled power and coupled fields versus incident angle, respectively. We see
that both the coupled electric and magnetic field are maximum at the resonance angle. Same
thing happens to the couple power as well which confirms the SPR occurrence at that particular
incident angle. This clearly indicates the creation of evanescent wave at this specific angle and
consequently we get a sharp dip in resonance curve. When light is incident at the resonance
angle, maximum power transfer occurs from the source to the evanescent wave. Electric and
magnetic field profiles are shown in Fig. 3d along the direction of penetration of evanescent
wave inside the sensing layer. Both the E and H-fields follow almost the same pattern. Field
intensity peaks sharply at the vicinity of metal-dielectric interface and penetrates through the
dielectric layers. As it passes through the dielectric layers, it dies out exponentially. Essentially,
field strength is very strong within a very small distance where the analyte bonds with the ligand.
This indicates a very narrow range of detectable distance. In our case, analyte bonding starts
after 23 nm from the interface. We see that fields are very strong in this region which provides
the enhanced sensitivity.
We analyze all the structures from the basic Kretschmann configuration to our proposed design
through subsequent intermediate structures. Gradual development of performance is noticed
as we move from basic to proposed design. We vary refractive index from 1.33 to 1.34 for the
sensing layer and observe the corresponding change in the resonance angle. As we see in the
Fig. 4, sensitivity is significantly increased for the proposed structure. For the basic structure, we
get the sensitivity to be only 18.4 degree/RIU. As we need a suitable receptor for Covid-19 sample,
we put Thiol tethered DNA on top of Ag layer which increases sensitivity a little bit to 26.7
degree/RIU. Inclusion of Si layer in between Ag and Thio tethered DNA increases the sensitivity
almost 3 times to 75.2 degree/RIU. Finally for our proposed structure, we find sensitivity almost
doubled to 130.3 degree/RIU. It is about 7.6 times compared to the basic configuration. This
analysis is summarized in Table 1. In Fig. 5, we plot field strength against depth from the Ag-Si
interface along the direction of evanescent wave penetration (z-axis in our case). We see that
the peak E-field undergoes a slight right shift with added layers. The rightmost red curve is our
proposed structure. As we have seen earlier, our proposed structure contains some extra layers
which shift the molecular binding region towards right further. With the peak E-field shifted
to the right, molecules now bond in the significant electric field region. This happens for all
intermediate structures.
We also investigate our structure using an FDTD solver to verify our findings. As shown in

Though our main goal is to maximize the performance in angular interrogation method, our
structure shows promising results in wavelength interrogation process also. To investigate the
proposed structure in wavelength interrogation method, we fixed the incident angle at 81 degree.
Then we measure the reflected light at different wavelength and observe the reflectance dip. We
vary the refractive index of the sensing layer from 1.33 to 1.34 and observe the corresponding
shift in resonance wavelength. We notice a significant red shift in the SPR curve as shown in
Fig. 7. We use the following equation to determine the sensitivity,
Sλ =

dλ
,

(9)

where dλ is the shift of resonance wavelength due to the change of refractive index of the sensing
layer, dns . We get sensitivity as high as 300 nm/RIU.

We now investigate the sensing performance of our structure for SARS-COV-2 detection.
We use Thiol tethered DNA as a ligand layer as it has been proved to be a good receptor of
SARS-COV-2. We collect data related to SARS-COV-2 from literature [30]. In the proposed
sensing scheme, samples collected from human nasopharyngeal swabs are passed through the
sensing channel in a liquid solution. When hybridization happens between SARS-CoV-2 RNA
(RdRp-COVID sequence) from sample with thiol tethered DNA of receptor molecules, it causes
a significant SPR angle shift (as high as 12 degree) as demonstrated in Fig. 8. Moreover, the
reflectance dip is accompanied with very low Rmin (0.01587) and FWHM (11.86), which shows
the prowess of our design as a potential plasmonic sensor for highly sensitive SARS-COV-2
detection.

Comparison with other reported structures

Finally, we compare the performance parameters of our design with existing structures in literature.
The performance metrics taken into account for comparison purposes are sensitivity, Rmin and
FWHM. While sensitivity is the most important performance parameter under consideration,
other two are also crucial for sensing accuracy. Hence, we define FOM according to Eqn. 7 as a
benchmark for comparison. We show the findings in Table 2. From the table, we see that the
proposed design shows higher sensitivity than majority of structures. While some designs have
obtained better sensitivity compared to ours, they simultaneously suffer from higher Rmin and
FWHM, and hence lower FOM. In terms of FOM, clearly our proposed structure outperforms
other competitive counterparts.
4.3.

Robustness analysis

For a sensor architecture to be successful in practice, ideally it should be able to provide consistent
performance over a wide range of sensing molecule configurations. That is why, we also studied

Conclusion

We have analyzed an SPR based novel biosensor for label-free and real-time detection of
SARS-COV-2. Extensive numerical simulations have been carried out for structural optimization
and performance analysis. Transfer matrix method as well as FDTD technique have been
employed to perform the simulations. Our results have shown promising indications for the
usage of the proposed sensor configuration as a potential detector of SARS-COV-2. We have
considered not only sensitivity but also other standard evaluation metrics such as FWHM,
Rmin to demonstrate the performance of our design. Furthermore, we have defined a FOM to
encapsulate all the performance parameters in a single evaluation quantity and compared with
other existing structures. This investigation has demonstrated competitive effectiveness of our
proposed structure over other designs. Moreover, the robustness of our sensor has been verified
with two other different ligand-ligate pairs. The study is limited in the sense that the results are
primarily numerical and experimental validation of such enhancements are required which is out
of scope here and focus of future work. However, for experimental investigations, a well-designed
and numerically evaluated sensor architecture is crucial, therein lies the significance of the
presented study.
