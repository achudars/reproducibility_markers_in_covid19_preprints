Abstract— The COVID-19 pandemic serves as a grim reminder
of the unexpected nature of these outbreaks and gives rise to a
unique set of research challenges in a variety of fields. As people
all over the world adjust to this new ‘normal’, with most
workplaces, from companies to educational institutions shifting
online, enormous surges in the transmission of images and
videos have been observed, creating record-breaking stresses on
the internet backbone. At the same time, maintaining the
privacy and security of the users’ data is of immense
importance, this is where fast and efficient image encryption
algorithms play a vital role. This paper discusses the calamitous
effects of the pandemic on the world population and how their
changes in multimedia consumption have led to an urgent need
for the development and deployment of secure and fast image
encryption, especially selective image encryption techniques. It
carefully surveys the most recent advances in this field, discusses
their real-world effects and finally explores some future
research avenues, to provide swift relief and recover from the
disastrous effects of the pandemic.

I. INTRODUCTION
At the time of writing this article, coronavirus has become
one of the most severe maladies of recent times, claiming the
lives of over 1 million people worldwide [1]. And these
desperate times call for desperate measures, as people from all
over the world come together to fight the pandemic,
researchers from diverse fields like are faced with novel
challenges born out of this scenario.
This respiratory disease, referred to as SARS-CoV-2 [2]
or the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), originated in
the Wuhan province of China, and was first identified in
December 2019, it was declared a Public Health Emergency
of International Concern on 30th January, 2020 and deemed
to be a pandemic on 11th March, 2020 by WHO (World
Health Organization), a detailed timeline of its responses can
also be found in [3].
A systematic analysis of the evolution of COVID-19,
analyzing data over a period of 100 days, was presented in [4].
Examining numerous detailed case-studies like those focusing
on the worst-hit states in India [5], Heilongjiang province in
China [6] and the world in general [7], various government
policies were formulated. As a result of rising public health
concerns, most governments established lockdowns to
varying degrees of strictness, preventing people from leaving
their homes or gathering in groups. This resulted in people
feeling listless and bored, go through mental distress and

much more. [8] and [9] discussed in detail some behavioral
changes brought on by the spread of COVID-19, and its
impact on health and well-being of individuals. A study [10]
on 917 Chinese adults, assessed the state boredom and
psychological distress among the people and assessed the
multimedia consumption of these individuals.
Many quantitative studies like [11] and [12] were done to
analyze the effects of the pandemic on factors including
internet and screen usage, and [12] reports an almost twothirds increase in usage of screen-time due to COVID19. In
[13], the authors analyze the massive changes in markets like
tourism, retail and higher education and the effects of the same
on health, cash flow, marketing and social media and internet
usage. [14] discussed a case-study of how the lockdown
affected a medium-sized university’s campus network,
observing massive spikes in internet and multimedia usage
due to virtual classrooms, live classes, remote online
collaboration etc.
Such stresses on the internet backbone have already
catalyzed improvements in the deployment of internet
connectivity and governments can play an active role by
implementing a variety of policy changes suggested in [15],
like allocating the unassigned spectrum in a fair and nondiscriminatory way, temporarily freezing of payment for
internet and mobile data, supporting telecommunication
infrastructure providers and monitoring network capacity
regularly. However, such policy changes are subject to the
societal and political contours of the specific region and in
some cases somewhat difficult to implement due to legal
constraints.
The impact of the surge in internet usage during the
pandemic has been studied in great detail in [16], which also
discusses some viewpoints for further research and practice.
The article mentions some major research issues of which
increasing digitalization and increasing work from home
(WFH) practices are majorly responsible for the increase in
multimedia consumption. For example, increased
digitalization has given almost everyone access to basic
internet usage and mobile phones and an increase in WFH
implies an increase in online presentations and meetings, in
which the communication is mostly through the exchange of
multimedia.
Given the massive usage of social media and mobile
multimedia [17] over the past decade, and especially with
multimedia-focused social media services like Instagram [18]

and Snapchat taking over older and more run-of-the-mill
social networking sites like Facebook in growth [19], the
importance of swift communication of multimedia has to be
appreciated. COVID-19 has brought to the forefront, an
existing research challenge and development of faster image
encryption schemes that can be easily deployed in a variety of
scenarios, from workstations to edge devices like handhelds is
urgently needed. The algorithm should also give the
deployment endpoint flexible control over the level of
encryption based on scenario or content.
The rest of the article is structured as follows. Sec. II
discusses some of the preliminaries of selective image
encryption like what it means, block and stream ciphers,
different algorithms and domains etc. Sec. III discusses the
recent advances in selective image encryption, and finally Sec.
IV gives the conclusion and discusses future research avenues.
II. PRELIMINARIES
A. What is Selective ROI Image Encryption
It is common knowledge that different regions of an image
do not encompass equal concentrations of important
information. Image encryption researchers have strived to
efficiently extract the Regions of Interest (ROI) in an image
so that smarter or adaptive encryption can be done, paying
more attention to ROI regions. This does not compromise on
the security of the system but time can be saved as fewer
iterations can be done on non-ROI parts of the input image.
For example, Fig. 1 shows the different stages of
encryption of a 512x512 grayscale image of Lena (viridis
colormap used for better visualization), as it passes through a
number of steps for selective image encryption. First, the
image has been divided into smaller blocks of 64x64, and the
importance of each block is calculated by measuring the
number of Edges. Then based on this importance, confusion
is carried to varying degrees in these blocks, to produce the
intermediary image, on which finally diffusion is carried out.

(CBC), Cipher Feedback (CFB) etc. each having different
advantages and disadvantages.
A stream cipher is also an example of symmetric
encryption, it maps k-bit keys and variable-length plaintexts
to ciphertexts of the same length. Certain modes of block
cipher actually produce synchronous stream ciphers like the
CTR mode and the boundary between block and stream
ciphers is often not rigid and has to be analyzed in careful
detail paying attention to security, key integrity, runtime
parallelization and more. A more detailed discussion on these
ciphers can be found in [20].
C. Encryption Algorithms and Domains
For symmetric key encryption, some standard algorithms
have been extensively explored like Data Encryption Standard
(DES), Triple DES (3DES), Advanced Encryption Standard
(AES), Blowfish etc. While some popular stream cipher
algorithms include RC4, SEAL, SNOW etc. The security of
the encryption scheme also depends on the implementation as
well.
Image encryption can be done in spatial domain (the image
as is, with values in R, G, B channels and transparency),
frequency domain (corresponding to the rate of change of
pixel intensities) and also in hybrid domain, as shown in Fig.
2.
III. RELATED WORK

B. Block and Stream Ciphers

In the past few years, selective encryption has gained a lot
of traction primarily due to its adaptability, flexibility for
utilization in a variety of scenarios and good encryption effect
in terms of security. Often when speed is key, it is not
desirable to encrypt the entire image heavily. Selective
encryption has been explored for close to two decades, but
many challenges still remain like having an efficient key
structure, giving the user control over the encryption level etc.
In this section, the advances in the field of selective image
encryption are carefully analyzed and compared in terms of
speed, practicality, ease of deployment and suitability for use
in various scenarios.

To decrypt an encrypted image E, the secret key may use
either of the two sets of algorithms, block ciphers or stream
ciphers. Block cipher is an example of symmetric key
encryption, it is a deterministic and invertible function of k-bit
keys and n-bit plaintext blocks to n-bit ciphertext blocks,
choosing a suitable mode of operation like Electronic Code
Book (ECB), Counter Mode (CTR), Cipher Block Chaining

One of the earliest contributions to selective encryption
was done by Xiang et al. [21] in 2007, wherein they proposed
a scheme with spatiotemporal chaotic system from coupled
map lattice and implemented it first for grayscale images and
then extended it for encrypting RGB images as well. They also
considered a selection strength parameter for the security time
tradeoff as well, which was quite novel at that time. They

ROI however is not the only way to carry out selective
encryption, it can also be done by encrypting selected
coefficients in the frequency domain, or hybrid domain, as has
been discussed in Sec C and shown in Fig. 2, or even
encrypting certain parts of the bit plane in all pixels, like only
the n Most Significant bits (MSB) or the n Least Significant
Bits (LSB).

reported their scheme to be very fast due to the leveraging of
selective encryption and reported their scheme as being more
efficient and universal compared to other block ciphers that
are codec specific and related to image compression.
Another technique of selectively encrypting only the 4-bit
MSB of each pixel was presented by Munir [22], where a
logistic map was used to generate a chaotic keystream and a
CBC-like mode was chosen for the algorithm. In [23], a
selective bit-plane encryption technique based on crosscoupled chaotic tent map is proposed for both grayscale
images and color images. Blowfish algorithm is used for
selective image cryptography in [24], the authors report a
better encryption performance compared to using DES and
AES.
When discussing selective ROI based encryption, the
process of choosing the ROIs can be manual or automatic
(based on morphological features in the image). In [25],
Panduranga et al. have shown both manual and automated
applications of selective encryption on medical and satellite
images, and in [26] partial image encryption is carried out
using two-stage hill cipher technique. In [27], block-wise
shuffling and 1D logistic map or tent map were utilized for
partial encryption and security in terms of Net Pixel Change
Rate (NPCR) and Unified Averaged Changed Intensity
(UACI) seems to have massively improved. [28] also
proposed a simple encryption scheme, involving manual
selection, based on Logistic and Lorenz map for medical
image encryption.
In [29], Bhatnagar and Wu proposed a simple and effective
selective encryption technique based on pixels of interest and
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). In this method, the
pixels are scrambled with the sawtooth space-filling curve
(SFC), followed by diffusion on the significant pixels using a
secret key obtained from a non-linear chaotic map and SVD.
Choudhary et al. [30] proposed a hybrid approach involving
splitting the image into blocks and confusion with Arnold cat
map and repeated for varying block sizes. A selective
encryption scheme was proposed by [31] which involved
dividing an image into blocks as well and the TD-ERCS
chaotic map.
Jawad et al. [32] in 2015 discussed a survey of the
challenges in selective encryption of color images based on
three categories, ROI selection, encryption techniques and key
management, those works of literature have mostly not been
repeated in this review to avoid duplication. Comprehensive
surveys discussing the most recent advances in image
encryption in general can also be found in [33] and [34].
In [35], a modification of T-DES encryption algorithm,
combined with inverted LSB steganography was discussed for
selective image encryption that was twice as fast as 3DES. In
[36], a novel ROI selection based on saliency detection in
compression domain was proposed, followed by encryption
using parametric switching chaotic system and discrete
wavelet transform based content transform (DWTCT). In
[37], a selective encryption based on 2D DWT, Henon’s
chaotic map and 4D Qi hyperchaos is proposed. The 2D DWT
is used to decompose the position of the pixels, which is
shuffled with Henon’s chaotic map, and then diffused by
XORing with keystreams generated from the Qi attractor.

A study of the practical issues of Discrete Cosine
Transform (DCT) based Selective Encryption for bitmap
images was discussed in [38], where the effects of various
parameters like protecting only a few coefficients in frequency
domain vs protecting all the coefficients, the effect of
rounding errors etc. They also proposed a method to guess DC
coefficients from parts of AC coefficients, thus they note the
importance of protecting the AC coefficients along with DC
coefficients. Here ROIs were not used, but can be
implemented as a pre-computation step for more effective
encryption of those regions as well. Shakir proposed a
selective AES coding of Haar wavelet transform with logistic
chaos-based confusion in [39].
In [40], a Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) based
selective image encryption scheme was implemented, that’s
compatible with the JPEG-2000 standard. It encrypted just
6.25% of the DWT coefficients and could resist medical
inference from the images, even after an attack. A lightweight
edge ROI-based selective medical image encryption scheme
was proposed by Khashan et al. in [41]. Selective image
encryption based on fractional wavelet domain was proposed
by Taneja et al. in [42], encrypting only around 3.125% of the
entire image data but providing acceptable levels of security.
In [43], a selective encryption scheme using square wave
SFC [44] and Orthogonal Polynomials Transform had been
proposed, which was incredibly fast and suitable for mobile
usage. ROI-based techniques have also been demonstrated to
be effective with SVD and chaos for copyright protection in
[45]. In [46], selectively pixels are encrypted in spatial domain
with Henon's chaotic map with key-value transformation. The
paper also does a great comparison against some other ROI
encryption schemes.
In recent times, [47] proposed selective medical image
encryption with DNA cryptography for medical images and a
combination of Chen’s hyperchaotic system and Taylor
Chirikov map. Similarly, DNA cryptography with wavelet
transform was also used in [48] for selective encryption. [49]
discussed the selective encryption of the DC and some AC
coefficients using the number maze technique. The use of
DNA cryptography for image encryption has also been
demonstrated in [50-52]. Compressive sensing plays a vital
role in fast image encryption, since the resulting images are
smaller or equal in size as original image, it reduces network
load and has been demonstrated in [53-56].
This section surveyed some of the most recent and notable
works of literature in the field of selective image encryption
which made use of various techniques like chaotic equations,
space-filling curve for image iteration, DNA, numeric maze
technique in various domains like spatial, frequency and
hybrid domains and also used various key management
techniques. The next section discusses some ongoing work in
this field.
IV. OUR ONGOING RESEARCH
Having presented a survey of the recent advances, this
section speaks in brief about some of the real-world issues that
need to be solved, and showcases some of the ongoing
research outputs of the author’s experiments, to highlight the
potential of selective image encryption and demonstrate how
it will have a significant impact in easing the communication

of secure multimedia, especially due to the surges caused by
the COVID-19 Work from Home (WFH) scenario, across
various industries.
The most essential research areas where this can be
implemented right now will be in encrypting medical imagery,
school or work multimedia and also other general images. The
robustness and suitability of this field to tackle those
problems, and some key ideas are discussed in the
forthcoming sections.
A. Encryption of Medical Images
The requirement in medical images encryption is not
usually complete obfuscation, but making sure the attacker
cannot obtain an image that can be used to get personally
identifiable information (PII) or any diagnosable information
about a patient. Here selective encryption will play an
essential role in making sure the hospitals’ internal and
external communication is not overloaded due to long heavy
encryption times of patient data as long all PII is removed.

the ROIs are automatically chosen by the system. Viridis
colormap has been used on a grayscale image for improved
contrast visualization and the screen size was adapted to
512x512 while creating the original input image to showcase
the encryption effect on both the slides and the human face.
C. Encryption of other general multimedia
Selective image encryption has the potential to be flexible
enough for all multimedia and all deployment systems in
general if implemented with consideration of the speed vs
security parameter, and factors like efficient key structure,
parallelization, etc. should also be carefully looked into. Some
more ideas to make this generalizable are discussed in Sec V.
Organizations and even departments within the same
organization, along with the users can have granular control
over their data and security settings with this technology.

Fig. 3. ROI Block Cipher Image Encryption on chest radiograph.

Visual inspection of the steps of encryption of a chest
radiograph in Fig. 3 shows ROI based image encryption is
robust enough to protect against attacks on medical images,
with even low security high speed settings. The images are in
grayscale but viridis colormap has been used for better
contrast and visualization of the encryption effect.
B. Encryption of Educational and Office-work Multimedia
COVID-19 has forced most schools, colleges and higher
degree institutes to shift online as the primary mode of
pedagogy. It has also been shown that the use of multimedia
helps achieve greater effectiveness in education [57].
Similarly, most workplaces, especially those with software
roles have moved online, leading to a large amount of audio
and multimedia information being transmitted over time.
Educational multimedia and office work multimedia will
have different requirements of security and there will also be
differences in terms of their software and hardware
infrastructure. Thus, a company needing to transmit extremely
sensitive multimedia, and having access to high-performance
workstations might desire a higher level of security, which
would certainly be different from the security level needed by
people using their phones for learning or recreational
activities.
These scenarios demand flexible algorithms that can be
tuned to the needs of the organization or the deployment API,
at a granular level, to tweak the security speed tradeoff
parameter thus making sure their systems are as secure as
needed and have maximum uptime.
In Fig. 4, the robustness of selective encryption is
demonstrated on a screengrab from Google Meet, in which has
the person’s face and the slides are selectively encrypted, and

V. FUTURE RESEARCH AVENUES
Having disseminated the current literature and shown the
potential of selective image encryption this section discusses
some of the potential avenues for future advancements in the
field of selective image encryption and combining it with the
advantages provided by advances in associated fields as well.
Due to COVID-19 and the rise of mobile multimedia in
general, the goal right now is to have image encryption
systems that do not clog networks hence it is of utmost
importance to have the encrypted images of approximately the
same size or lesser than the original images, compressive
sensing has become a popular and efficient technique in that
regard and has been utilized for image encryption in [58-60]
in recent years.
One also needs to take care of the security aspects of the
chaotic maps that are used in the encryption schemes. Small
key spaces and poor initialization of chaotic maps can make
the keystreams unchaotic. Numerous such analyses have been
published in recent times like [61] which commented on the
improper key space analysis done by [62] and experimentally
identified the non-chaotic ranges. Similarly [63] proposed a
novel metaheuristic approach based on Pareto evolution II to
tune the hyperparameters of the chaotic maps and observed
better security performance compared to traditional metrics.
Generalized image processing with domain adaptation is
difficult [64] but with the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT),
and federated learning [65-67], it is now possible to detect the
image or video context on a device without any privacy risk,
which can be utilized to adapt to the level of security needed,
reducing response times. The image encryption system can
also be sensitive to the software and hardware constraints and
network loads in future to effectively balance security and
speed. This would lead to having better and more efficient
image encryption algorithms that also generalize well to
various scenarios.

In ROI image encryption, it is of immense importance to
make sure that ROIs that are being chosen are the most
critical ones, the size of blocks in the partitioned image
usually has an impact on security as well. These are some
avenues selective image encryption researchers can pursue in
the near future.

VI. CONCLUSION
This article discusses the enormous stresses placed on the
internet backbone due to the WFH scenario and the
coronavirus outbreak, causing massive surges in internet
usage, which if left unchecked, can cause outages worldwide.
Since multimedia consumption is at the crux of the problem,
this survey goes over the most recent advances in the field of
selective encryption, which is key to efficiently optimizing the
speed and security tradeoffs and maintaining the required
levels of privacy for user data. Selective encryption has been
worked on for almost the past two decades, but still significant
areas of improvement remain in areas like guaranteeing the
security and integrity of the keystreams, giving the
deployment endpoint or the user control over the level of
encryption, or dynamically adapting to the software and
hardware constraints etc. There is a need for standardized tests
to compare algorithms across various architectures as well.
Some more avenues of future research combining the
advantages of federated learning and reduced response times
from domain adaptation with selective encryption have
already been explored in the previous section. The author
hopes this survey provides a deeper insight into the image
encryption landscape, especially in selective image encryption
today, and encourages and enables researchers to solve some
of the most pressing problems in this field.
