Abstract— The paper deals with a modeling of the ongoing
epidemic caused by Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on
the closed territory of the Republic of Croatia. Using the official
public information on the number of confirmed infected, recovered and deceased individuals, the modified SEIR compartmental
model is developed to describe the underlying dynamics of the
epidemic. Fitted modified SEIR model provides the prediction of
the disease progression in the near future, considering strict control interventions by means of social distancing and quarantine
for infected and at-risk individuals introduced at the beginning
of COVID-19 spread on February, 25th by Croatian Ministry of
Health. Assuming the accuracy of provided data and satisfactory
representativeness of the model used, the basic reproduction
number is derived. Obtained results portray potential positive
developments and justify the stringent precautionary measures
introduced by the Ministry of Health.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Coronavirus 2019-2020 epidemic of coronavirus disase
2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), began in Wuhan, China,
in late December 2019 [1]. Although Europe had time to
prepare for the case of an epidemic outbreak, the lack of
relevant medical data and the novelty of COVID-19 disease
have made it the new epicenter of the current pandemic with
more reported cases and deaths than the rest of the world
combined, excluding China, at the time of writing this paper.
The paper aims to model the disease dynamics by determining epidemic parameters in order to estimate the number
of infected individuals over time on the closed territory of
Croatia and to predict the pace of COVID-19 disease spreading
by using the basic reproduction number R0 . Since control
measures in Croatia, such as tracing close contacts, quarantining infected cases, promoting social distancing and selfprotection using protective equipment, i.e. medical masks and
gloves in a public area, started with the first confirmed case
on February, 25th, R0 explicitly indicates the effectiveness
of the current control measures and facilitate the adoption
and implementation of potential additional measures. Thus,
the ultimate goal of this paper is to accurately determine R0
as the expected number of secondary infections caused by a
single infectious symptomatic or asymptomatic individual in
a fully susceptible population [2].

Even though Coronavirus-based diseases are well documented and modeled with a satisfactory level of accuracy
in computational epidemiology literature [3], there are a few
novel properties of COVID-19 disease that need to be considered. Firstly, a long incubation period will cause time delay
between real dynamics and the actual status. Furthermore,
both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals are capable
of being infectious carriers of SARS-CoV-2. Finally, the
disease transmission is achieved via respiratory droplets and is
extremely difficult to prevent due the well resilient pathogen
hardly affected by external atmospheric conditions [4].
In order to determine epidemic parameters, stochastic models are well adopted and preferred in the current research
[5], but during the initial stage of the epidemic, the data are
sparse and the epidemic dynamics are better described using
deterministic modeling. Generalizations of the SusceptibleExposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model are used for China
[6], [7] and heavily affected parts of Europe [8], [9]. However,
due to the change of diagnostics and the lack of implementation of control measures in the initial stage of the
outbreak, early published models were forced to add many
free parameters and fit the data in multiple phases. Such
complicated models are prone to over-fitting.
This paper introduces the modified version of SEIR model
with a single additional parameter to fit and implicitly included
additional compartment for quarantined and self-isolated individuals. The paper is organized as follows: Section II outlines
the mathematical modeling of COVID-19 and methods for
predicting the spread of the mentioned disease; Section III is
dedicated to the computational results and discussion; lastly,
conclusion is presented in Section IV. Scraping of official
data, the modified SEIR model fitting details and optimization
method are given in Appendix A, while additional details on
epidemic parameters are given in Appendix B.

SEIR model, based on the early work of Kermack and
McKendrick [10]–[12], is compartmental, population-based
epidemiological model used for an appropriate mathematical
representation of underlying dynamics of an infectious disease.

is a perfect candidate to simulate a propagation of a disease
without much of a prior knowledge on a disease. The entire
population, which is assumed to be constant in time (no vital
dynamics by means of birth and death rate are taken into an
account) is divided into 4 compartments. The rate of change
over time for each compartment is expressed in terms of a
set of 4 coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Note
that the nature of differential equations dealing with time
dependant quantities is to assume continuous variables, which
is not the case for both the number of people and observed
time steps. In order to obtain the discrete time equivalent,
the changes of individuals in each compartment are modeled
via a set of difference equations over an arbitrary discretetime step t (typically a day). It is worth emphasizing that the
discretization of variables is usually carried out as a prequel
to stochastic modeling [13]. Nevertheless, continuous compartmental models provide more detailed epidemic dynamics
[6], thus the modified SEIR model is defined in terms of the
following set of ODEs:

where,

S is the susceptibles compartment;
E is the exposed compartment;
I is the infected compartment and
R is the recovered (or deceased) compartment.

A simplified visual representation of the modified SEIR model
of COVID-19 disease based on the set of equations (1)-(4) is
shown in Fig. 1. It is assumed that only a small portion of
the total population N is susceptible to the infection due to

timely and effective measures implemented from the first day
of the epidemic.
Free parameters are in order: the transition rate, β, which
stands for the average number of contacts per unit time
multiplied by the probability of transmission per each contact,
the direct transition rate between exposed and susceptible
compartment, δ; the reciprocal value of the incubation period,
α, and the rate of recovery or mortality, γ. The mentioned
expansion with respect to standard SEIR model lies in the expression δ·E ·S, which allows exposed individuals, considered
to be in the incubation phase, to transmit the infection onto
susceptible individuals [14].
B. R0 - The Key Epidemic Parameter
R0 (read R naught) is the expected number of secondary
infections in a sufficiently large population without prior
immunity to a disease. The assumption is well aligned with the
current COVID-19 disease outbreak, since there is no maternal
immunity nor there is a functional vaccine yet. R0 number
depends on both biological characteristics of the pathogen and
the host, and on social circumstances, as follows:
R0 =

β
γ+α

(5)

The importance of R0 lies in the fact that it represents somewhat of a threshold value from which one could determine
the further progress of the disease. Namely, if R0 > 1, the
pathogen is expected to invade a population - the epidemic
expansion is likely to occur. On the other hand, if R0 < 1, the
ongoing disease will vanish over time. The goal of preventive
measures is to keep R0 below the mentioned threshold. In
other words, R0 directly depends on the total infectious period,
τ=

1
γ+α

(6)

which is considered to be constant biological property and on
the probability of disease transmission per contact per unit
time, β. The transition rate, β, can be implicitly lowered by

III. R ESULTS AND D ISCUSSION
An early stage of the epidemic spread of an infectious
disease, shown in Fig. 2, is often characterized by exponential
growth, with the rapidity of growth dependent on the force
of infection, formally defined as the per capita rate at which
susceptible individuals contract infection and mathematically
formulated with the following expression:
(7)

After an early stage, exponential growth is physically unfeasible because of the finite size of the population. Exponential
function overestimates the total number of infected individuals, shown in Fig. 3a, where actual growth soon starts to
asymptotically approach the value of the maximum infections
and is more accurately represented via the logistic function.
However, since the current status of the growth is unknown,
the logistic function fitted to the portion of the data provides
grossly underestimated predictions, depicted in Fig. 3b.
Instead of observing confirmed cases over time, a more
appropriate capture of the current trend of the disease spread is
achieved by observing the change itself. Fig. 4 charts the number of new cases averaged over previous 7 days. Obviously,
COVID-19 disease spread in Croatia is in a downward trend. If
the influence of time is instead taken implicitly and the growth
rate is plotted against the current number of infections in
logarithmic scale, the resulting comparison between the actual

lowering the susceptible population through social distancing
and by lowering the transition rate, e.g. enhanced hygiene,
wearing protective clothing.
In this paper, R0 is determined via expression given in (5),
with parameters obtained through fitting the actual data, time
series of confirmed active infections and recovered individuals
from February, 25th to April, 11th , to the modified SEIR model.
The data are obtained from the official publicly available
sources [15].

growth of COVID-19 disease and the exponential growth will
be easier to compare, see Fig. 5. Once the trend begins to
steeply decline, the epidemic is considered to be terminated,
i.e. the reproductive number drops below 1.
The modified SEIR model, introduced in the section II-A,
is fitted to the number of confirmed active, recovered and
death cases over time. Using the estimated parameters of the
fitted model, described in detail in Appendix B, reproduction
number is calculated for different phases of the epidemic.
The data are fitted using the iterative Limited-memory BroydenFletcherGoldfarbShanno (L-BFGS) algorithm. Within this
framework, for each optimization iteration, the set of ODEs
(1)-(4) is solved by the 4th order Runge-Kutta method. The
optimization procedure and the solution of the set of ODEs
are presented in more detail in section A. Fig. 6 depicts fitted
modified SEIR model using different sizes of the train data
set. Fig. 6a shows the model fitted using 80% of the data
set, while the rest of the data are used in order to assess
goodness of fit using the out-of-sample data, Fig. 6b shows
the SEIR model fitted using 88% of the data set, while Fig.

6c deals with the complete data set. Fitting the data provides
optimal values for epidemiological parameters α, β, γ and δ.
R0 is then calculated for different phases of the epidemic and
the resulting values are 1.43, 1.33 and 1.25 for 80% of the
data, 88% of the data and the complete data set, respectively.
These results imply the effectiveness of the control measures
implemented to combat the epidemic as R0 decreases with
each increase of the data set. In case there is no change in
control measures, one could infer that the positive downward
trend will continue up until late April when the number of
confirmed active infected cases will reach its maximum. The
maximum point is also the inflection point indicating the
moment at which R0 < 1 and after which, with the retention
of the control measures, the number of total confirmed cases
stops increasing.

demic in Croatia. Transmission parameters of the model are
optimized using the available data on the number of confirmed,
recovered and deceased individuals, respectively. The model
assumes a sufficient percentage of a population q · N being
voluntarily self-isolated, shown in Fig. 1. The percentages of
self-isolated people, together with initial number of exposed,

infected and recovered individuals are taken as initial values
in order to solve the set of ODEs.
The parameters are used to calculate R0 for different stages
of the spread of COVID-19 in Croatia. The values of R0
improve as the data approach closer to April 11th . At this point
one considers the government control measures, implemented
to slow down the disease spread, to be effective and should be
continued until R0 number decreases and remains sufficiently
long period of time below the threshold value of 1.
Based on fitted SEIR model, the climax of the infection is
expected to occur in late April. The inflection point should
follow soon after that date, which ultimately means that the
epidemic is in a strong decline period.

O UTLINE OF M ATHEMATICAL M ODELING
The number of confirmed, recovered and deceased individuals is collected from available data for the period of February,
25th to April, 11th . The modified SEIR model consists of 4
free parameters β, γ, α and δ to be optimally determined by
minimizing the loss function J(β, γ, α, δ). The loss function is
formulated as the weighted summation of l2 norm between the
actual number of actively inffected, recovered and deceased
people and their respective approximations. The loss function
is written using the following expression:
ˆ
J(β, γ, α, δ) = ||I(t) − I(t)||
2 +||R(t) − R̂(t)||2

(A.1)

The approximations are obtained by solving the set of deterˆ
ministic ODEs and are marked with I(t)
for approximated
number of active infections over time and R̂(t) for approximated total sum of recovered and deceased individuals over
time.
The minimization is performed using L-BFGS method
where for each set of parameter values, the 4th order RungeKutta method is employed to solve the set of ODEs with
known initial values. For each of the differential equations
given in (1)-(4), initial values are determined using available
data on the number of susceptible individuals S0 , the number
of exposed individuals E0 , the number of infected individuals
I0 and the number of recovered and deceased individuals R0 at
the first day of the epidemic. Both, the minimization and the
initial value problem for the set of ODEs are solved using
SciPy, open-source scientific software built on the NumPy
extension of Python programming language.
