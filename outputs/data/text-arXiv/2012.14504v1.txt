Abstract:
The present Health Crisis tests the response of modern science and medicine to
finding treatment for a new COVID-19 disease. The presentation on the world stage
of antivirals such as remdesivir, obeys to the continuous investigation of biologically
active molecules with multiple theoretical, computational and experimental tools.
Diseases such as COVID:19 remind us that research into active ingredients for
therapeutic purposes should cover all available sources, such as plants. In the
present work, in silico tools, specifically docking study, were used to evaluate the
binding and inhibition capacity of an antiviral such as remdesivir on the NSP-12
protein of SARS-CoV, a polymerase that is key in the replication of the SARS-COV
virus. The results are then compared with a docking analysis of two natural products
(Alpha-Bisabolol and betalain) with SARS-CoV protein, in order to find more
candidates for COVID-19 virus replication inhibitors. in addition to increasing studies
that help explain the specific mechanisms of the SARs-CoV-2 virus, remembering
that we will have to live with the virus for an indefinite time from now on. Finally,
natural products such as betalains may have inhibitory effects of a small order but in
conjunction with other synergistic active ingredients they may increase their
inhibition effect on NSP-12 protein of SARS-CoV.

1. Introduction
The Coronaviruses (CoVs) represent a heterogeneous family of positive sense RNA
viruses and they are able to cause respiratory and enteric diseases in human and
animal hosts. About all the types of coronavirus that exist, the most relevant are the
highly pathogenic human CoVs, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV)
and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) all of them are able to provoke
serious respiratory diseases (1-4). The zoonotic SARS-CoV-2 emerged in 2019
where the first cases reported for the first time were in Wuhan (China) and spread
throughout the world until to be declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020 (4-7).
Viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) continue transiting in the reservoirs of
bats and other species of mammals belonging to wildlife (4). Outbreaks of highly
pathogenic human CoVs still being an emerging threat to global health security and
are likely to continue to occur in the future.
Emerging viruses of the CoV family require special attention to develop antiviral
strategies aimed at conserved elements of the viral life cycle, such as the viral
mechanism responsible for replication and transcription of the viral positive-chain
RNA genome (2, 4). The CoV RNA synthesis mechanisms, is of multiple subunit, it
is a set of non-structural proteins (nsp) produced as breakdown products of the viral
polyproteins ORF1a and ORF1ab5. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase nsp12
has minimal activity by itself, only with the addition of the cofactors nsp7 and nsp8
is that they can stimulate the activity of the polymerase nsp12 (6). It is necessary
extra viral nsp subunits for carrying out replication and transcription activities;
however, the nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 complex nowadays represents the minimum
required formulation for nucleotide polymerization (6).
After the emergence of SARS-CoV, there was an intense effort for structurally,
characterize the CoV replication complexes. This EFFORT GAVE AS A result in the
determination of the high-resolution structure for many of the SARS-CoV nsps
THROUGH X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance. Besides this,
complexes of nsp7-nsp8 and nsp10-nsp14 were also determined (2, 6).
Then in 2019 the scientist Kirchdoerfer, Robert N., et. al. Determinated the structure
of the SARS-CoV nsp12 complex linked to the cofactors nsp7 and nsp8 by using
cryoelectronics microscopy (cryo-TEM). The complex of nsp12, nsp7 and nsp8 has
160 kDa and make up most of the viral RNA synthesis complex of coronaviruses (6).

It is necessary to emphasize that the SARS-CoV protein belongs to the SARS 2002
epidemiological outbreak and the Covid-19 disease has a SARS-CoV-2 protein, both
proteins have huge similarities and they are highly conserved in both viruses.
2

Starting with the contribution of the structure of the SARS-CoV nsp12 complex linked
to the cofactors nsp7 and nsp8 (protein best identified by the PDB protein database).
It begins the possibility to search for the nsp12 inhibitory structures with molecular
analysis tools (docking) in order to inhibit the biological machanism of synthesis of
SARS-CoV and one of the most promising molecules to do that is the Remdesivir,
which is one of the first prescription inhibitors in patients with Covid-19 in the United
States of America (1, 2, 6, 8).
Remdesivir, is a nucleotide analog that mimics the structure of adenosine. Gilead
Sciences, Inc. originally developed it. So as to treat Ebola (4, 7, 9, 10). Even though
it has not passed the phase 3 of the clinical trial of Ebola treatment, it showed a
promising moderate improvement over the death rate from deadly Ebola and the
active setting of remdesivir found already hydrolyzed and decorated with
triphosphates, by using the remdesivir nucleus as the nucleoside. We call this
hydrolyzed and phosphorylated remdesivir "RemTP”. Like other nucleotide analogs,
remdesivir could potentially be used as a wide spectrum antiviral drug, due to the
structural similarities of RNA polymerase of various viruses (7, 9). Because of this,
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved remdesivir on October 22, 2020
for its treatment in severely covid-19 patients; due to the significant reduction in the
duration of invasive medical intervention in positive patients for covid-19 (1, 2, 4, 7).
The new and rapid development of COVID-19 around the world is going to address
the urgent need for more information about remdesivir as an inhibitor, including the
search for conserved interaction points (amino acids) in the SARS-COV-2 protein
(4). Therefore, we did a physics-based molecular modeling study on bonding
mechanism between remdesivir and SARS-CoV-2 by using molecular docking
techniques to identify candidates for inhibitors of the SARS-COV complex, which
has similarity to the SARS-CoV-2 protein (covid-19) (1, 2, 6). Within the study, was
modeled the interaction of the hydrolyzed and phosphorylated remdesivir nucleoside
RemTP against the SARS-CoV protein as well as, 2 extra molecules called natural
products, in the search for more inhibitors of the SARS-CoV protein.
The two products selected for SARS-CoV docking analysis are Alpha-Bisabolol
(major component of Matricaria chamomilla and its essential oil) (11) and betalain
(member of a family of secondary nitrogenous metabolites of plants who has red and
yellow pigments) (12).

Molecular docking study

ChemBioOffice constructed ligands and the energy minimization performed with
Molecular Mechanic by ChemBioDraw ultra software. Gaussian 03W, GaussView
3.0 and Chimera 1.14, using a Hartree-Fock calculation for the molecule in neutral
basal state (without electrical charge), achieved an approach to the real molecular
spatial array. Once the calculation was completed, we saved the final molecular
structure and information in mol2 format for later manipulation in UCSF Chimera
1.14 (13, 14). The 3D structure of SARS-CoV in PDB format was obtained from
Protein Data Bank (PDB) with identification (ID) 6NUR, as well as the identification
in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) is: ID 31138817. Finally,
after obtaining of ligands and target proteins, the docking procedure was performed
and optimized by the SIB web site service (11, 15, 16), the docking full procedure
was reported by Ortiz, Mario I., et. al. in 2016.

3. Results and Discussion.
Zhang, L., and Zhou, R. (2020) described the first interactions of RemTP with a
modified version of 6NUR-SARS-CoV (updated to reflect changes in the amino acid
sequence for the Covid-19 protein) (1, 2). They were identified, the main positions
where the active form of Remdesivir binds: the adenosine Tri Phosphate (ATP) part
interacts with positive charges in the residues: LYS-551, ARG-553, ARG-555, LYS621, LYS- 798, ARG-836 and original remdesivir section interacts with SER-549,
ARG-555, LYS-545, ALA-547 and VAL-557 (1, 2). There are two sections of
interaction, that of ATP and that of the nucleoside analog of the original remdesivir.
The interaction of remdesivir blocks the main function of the polymerase complex
nsp12-nsp8 and nsp7 (1). In addition to the aforementioned residues, interactions of
RemTP with ASP-618 has been reported, this indicates that there may be more
interactions that require further study (1, 2), but in this work, we will contrast the
interactions reported by Zhang, L., and Zhou, R., versus to the results of interactions
of two natural products: Betaline and Alpha-Bisabolol.

3.1 Docking SARS-CoV with RemTP.

Key amino acid positions were identified and reported by Zhang, L., and Zhou, R.
within the 3D model of SARS-CoV (1). Later, the interactions near the key positions
were recognized (only the positions were taken into account, since that the amino
acids between the SARS-CoV polymerase and the SARS-CoV-2 modification differ
in amino acids), as well as the Gibbs free energy (ΔG) of all positions considered
feasible.

4

The complete docking calculation generated 250 possible interactions, of which 65
positions selected due to their proximity to the reported positions; of the 65 positions,
the eight most favored energetically are reported (table 1).

Having the main interactions of RemTP with its corresponding ΔG we can make a

have interaction with the sites reported in RemTP literature, of these 4 positions were

3.4 Discussion.
Analyzing the interactions between the three molecules, we observe that the largest
number of interactions with the SARS-CoV protein is with RemTP, something
already expected knowing that it is the active form of remdesivir, it is importan to
emphasize that with 65 interactions and 8 favored energy positions the RemTP
presents high binding affinity for SARS-CoV, this reinforces the inhibition studies of
Zhang, L., and Zhou, R. as well as the extra information reported in the literature (2,
7). It is also so important to emphasiz that the molecules proposed as inhibitors must
be structurally similar with nucleosides in order to guarantee a greater number of
interactions and a high binding affinity with SARS-CoV, this is in order to keep
looking to inhibit their RNA polymerase action. The presence of the amine functional
group is important to increase interactions with positive partial charges of the SARSCoV protein.
7

Based on the fact that the affinity for SARS-CoV is increased by the presence of the
amine functional group, in the results we see the greatest interactions, within the two
natural products it is betalain which has two amines in its structure. Betalain has 49
binding interactions and 4 energetically favored positions, being the lowest Gibbs
free energy. This indicates that betalain could have an inhibitory effect on the SARSCoV protein, although this is of low intensity when compared to the active form of
remdesivir.
In the case of Alpha-Bisabolol, of the 250 positions generated by the docking study,
only 2 turned out to have an interaction close to the active positions reported in the
literature for SARS-CoV. It turns out, that Afa-Bisabolol is an example of low binding
affinity with SARS-CoV and therefore, its inhibition capacity is null. However, a more
in-depth analysis of natural products is required to identify structures with higher
binding affinity.

4. Conclusions.
Docking studies are a non-presential study to identify biologically active
molecules towards a specific protein, through the elimination of molecules
with zero affinity and emphasizing those molecules to synthesize and test them
experimentally. In the case of natural products, there are new molecules describe
constantly in the scientific literature and whose interaction and biological
effectiveness must be tested against proteins that represent problems of impact for
society. In this case, the study demonstrates the feasibility of using the docking study
to identify possible inhibitors of the SARS-CoV protein (key to the replication
machinery of the virus that generates Covid-19).
Because of the natural products are chemical compounds of a varied chemical
nature, they present a great possibility of having biological effects on SARS-CoV in
addition to being compounds that were generated in living beings, they present a
great capacity for degradation without becoming persistent pollutants in the
environment. In the present work, we identify that the red pigment betalain mainly
present in several fruits and vegetables is a candidate for inhibition of the SARSCoV protein. It does not mean, that betalain is a complete treatment, but it could
indicate the chemical structures with the greatest capacity of inhibition to find
molecules more related to SARS-CoV and break the replication chain of the covid19 virus.
