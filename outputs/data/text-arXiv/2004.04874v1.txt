Abstract
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly spread worldwide and has caused over
1,400,000 infections and 80,000 deaths. There are currently no drugs or vaccines with proven efficacy
for its prevention and little knowledge was known about the pathogenicity mechanism of SARS-CoV-2
infection. Previous studies showed both virus and host-derived MicroRNAs (miRNAs) played crucial
roles in the pathology of virus infection. In this study, we use computational approaches to scan the
SARS-CoV-2 genome for putative miRNAs and predict the virus miRNA targets on virus and human
genome as well as the host miRNAs targets on virus genome. Furthermore, we explore miRNAs
involved dysregulation caused by the virus infection. Our results implicated that the immune response
and cytoskeleton organization are two of the most notable biological processes regulated by the
infection-modulated miRNAs. Impressively, we found hsa-miR-4661-3p was predicted to target the S
gene of SARS-CoV-2, and a virus-encoded miRNA MR147-3p could enhance the expression of
TMPRSS2 with the function of strengthening SARS-CoV-2 infection in the gut. The study may provide
important clues for the mechisms of pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction
The current pandemic of COVID-19, caused by a novel virus strain, SARS-CoV-2, has led to over
1,400,000 confirmed cases and 80,000 fatalities in over 100 countries since its emergence in late 2019.
SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA betacoronavirus of the family
Coronaviridae. Humans coronaviruses cause respiratory tract infections that can be mild, such as some
cases of the common cold, e.g. HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HKU1. However, over the past two
decades, highly pathogenic human coronaviruses have emerged, including SARS-CoV in 2002 and
2003, which infected 8,000 people worldwide and with a fatality rate of ~10% and MERS-CoV in 2012
with 2,500 confirmed cases and a death rate of 37%1. Infection with these highly pathogenic
coronaviruses can result in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), which may lead
to widespread inflammation in the lungs, shortness of breath, and death. Compared to MERS and
SARS, SARS-CoV-2 appears to spread more efficiently although with relatively lower mortality of
2%~3%1,2. Furthermore, mounting evidence has suggested that the subclinical cases, which show
limited to no symptoms but could spread virus as well, may represent a large amount of the infections3,4.
The existence of the large pool of covert cases is a new threat to the control of the SARS-CoV-2
outbreak.
The SARS-CoV-2 entries cells by engaging the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as receptor
with the surface unit (S1) of the spike (S) protein, and then uses the host serine protease TMPRSS2 for
S priming, allowing fusion of viral and cellular membranes and viral entry into the cell5. Pneumonia is
the common symptom of SARS-CoV-2 infection6; however, there was also evidence of damages to the
liver7 and spleen8 as well as gastrointestinal symptoms9. The SARS-CoV-2 infection causes increased
secretion of cytokines, and the main death cause of SARS-CoV-2 is ARDS, for which one of the main
mechanisms are the cytokine storm, the deadly uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response resulting
from the release of large amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by immune cells in
SARS-CoV-2 infection6. Nevertheless, the mechanism of virus invasion, release and the causes of these
exuberant inflammatory responses in SARS-CoV-2 infection remain largely unknown.
miRNA is a small non-coding RNA molecule with an average of 22 nucleotides in length. miRNA was
widely found in plants, animals and some viruses and involved in a variety of biological processes. In
most cases, miRNAs interact with the 3′ untranslated region (3′ UTR) of target mRNAs to induce
mRNA degradation and translational repression. However, except for the role as a repressor, increasing
evidence has shown that miRNAs could activate gene expression by interacting with other regions,
including the 5′ UTR and gene promoters10,11. As crucial regulators of gene expression,
miRNA-targeted therapeutics has been proposed or for treatment of cancers, virus infection and other
diseases. For example, antimiR targeted at has-miR-122 is in trials for treating hepatitis12.
It has shown that viral genomes, including DNA and RNA virus, were capable of encoding
miRNAs13,14. The virus-derived miRNAs can be expressed in host cells and participate in the lifecycle
and cellular consequences of infection. In 2004, Tuschl and colleagues identified the first viral
miRNAs encoded by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a common human herpesvirus types in the herpes
family. To date, over 300 viral encoded miRNAs have been described. A couple of EBV-encoded
miRNAs were identified since 2004 and were proposed to be involved in the host immune response15.
More than 20 human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) miRNAs are identified and suggested to target several
3

cellular genes to evade the immune system, control cell cycle and vesicle trafficking16,17. The HIV
encodes miRNAs, i.e. MiR-H3 and HIV1-miR-H1 were reported to enhance viral production and
impairs cellular responses to infection, respectively18,19.
Viral miRNAs have been found to target a large number of host genes involved in regulating cell
proliferation, apoptosis, and host immunity13. The miR-HA-3p encoded by H5N1 accentuates the
production of antiviral cytokines by targeting and repressing poly(rC)-binding protein 2 (PCBP2)
expression, a known negative regulator of RIG/MAVS signaling, resulting in a high level of cytokine
production and high mortality20. Also, viral miRNAs target the virus genes, which also help the virus to
remain hidden from the host immune response. For example, miR-BART2 encoded by EBV was found
to lie antisense to the EBV DNA polymerase gene BALF5 and was proposed to inhibit DNA
polymerase expression by inducing cleavage within the 3'-UTR of BALF521. Furthermore, given the
importance of miRNA in regulating gene networks or pathways, viruses have evolved mechanisms to
degrade, boost, or hijack cellular miRNAs to benefit the viral life cycle. Both Herpesvirus saimiri
(HVS) and Murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) bind miR-27 with antisense, leading miR-27
degradation in a sequence-specific and binding-dependent manner, to promote T-cell activation and
enhance viral replication, respectively22,23. The non-translated region of North American eastern equine
encephalitis virus genome base pairs with the miR-142-3p, resulted in a miR-142-3p mediated innate
immune suppression24. Moreover, recent studies indicate the virus-encoded miRNAs, host-encoded
miRNAs, and miRNA targets together form a novel regulatory system between the virus and the host,
which contributes to the outcome of infection25. Hence, it is crucial to comprehensively understand the
role of the novel regulatory system during SARS-COV-2 infection, then apply this information towards
developing both new medicine and repurposing existing ones.

Materials and Methods
Computational identification of SARS-CoV-2-encoded miRNA
The complete genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 (accession number: MN908947) was obtained from
the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The VMir software package (v2.2)26, an ab
initio prediction program designed specifically to identify pre-miRNAs in viral genomes, was used to
identify and visualize potential pre-miRNAs within the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The program examines
all possible pre-miRNAs in the input sequence and consequently identifies a large number of potential
candidates. The program slides a window of defined size across the entire sequence of interest,
advancing each window by a given step size. The parameters of window and step sizes were set at 500
and 1 nt, respectively, as set in other literature. The Minimum Free Energy of the predicted hairpin
structures were predicted with RNAFold algorithm from the Vienna package27. Hairpins with MEF >
-20 kCal/mol were removed from the flowing analysis. Then HuntMi software was used to further
distinguish miRNA hairpins from pseudo hairpins with a virus-based model28. Maturebayes web
server29 was used to identify the mature miRNA within the pre-miRNAs based on sequence and
secondary structure information of their miRNA precursors.

Prediction of miRNA targets and functional annotation
Human 3′- and 5′-UTR, and the Enhancer sequence for five tissues were downloaded from the UTRdb
database30 and EnhancerAtlas(35) database, respectively. Human miRNA sequence was downloaded
from the TargetScan database. The targets of virus-encoded miRNA and human miRNAs were
4

predicted with TargetFinder31 and miRanda32. The miRNA targets on human genes were extracted from
the TargetScanHuman 7.2 database33, with context++ score < -0.4 and percentile >0.99 as previously
applied34. Then UTR and enhancer associated genes were extracted from annotations in UTRdb
database30 and EnhancerAtlas database35. Genes were functionally annotated using Gene Ontology (GO)
terms using R packages and the function enrichment tests were conducted with GOstats36.

Virus variation processing
The genomic variations were downloaded from China National Center for Bioinformation, data were
collected until Mar 19, 2020. The mutations were obtained based on sequence alignment against the
reference genome MN908947.3 as we used for miRNA scanning.

Data process for other coronaviruses
The genome sequence of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV-2, and HCoV-NL63 were obtained from NCBI with
the accession of NC_004718.3, NC_005831.2, and NC_019843.3, respectively. The pipeline for
miRNA prediction from the virus genome, miRNA target prediction, and functional annotation was the
same as that applied to the SARS-CoV-2 as we described before.

Results and Discussion
Identification of SARS-CoV-2-encoded miRNAs
A total of 808 potential pre-miRNA in the SARS-CoV-2 genome were detected with VMir Analyzer26,
an ab initio prediction program designed specifically to identify pre-miRNAs in viral genomes (Figure
1A). Candidate pre-miRNA sequences were further identified using HuntMi28 with the virus model and
the sequences with minimum free energy (MFE) > -20 kCal/mol were removed. A total of 45 virus
pre-miRNA candidates were finally obtained, with 30 were found in the direct orientation and 15 in the
reverse orientation. The pre-miRNAs were evenly distributed across the SARS-CoV-2 genome (Figure
1B). The average length of the pre-miRNA sequence was 78 nt with an average MFE of -28.1 kCal/mol.
Finally, the sequence and position of mature miRNA within the pre-miRNA candidate were identified
with MatureBayes, resulting in 90 mature miRNAs.

Virus miRNAs suppress host gene expression
The classical mechanism of miRNAs to regulate their target gene is by binding to the 3′ UTR of mRNA
to exert negative regulatory effects on gene expression. Human 3′ UTR targets of the mature viral
miRNAs were predicted and 40 miRNA were predicted to be binding to the 3′ UTR of 73 genes. Gene
ontology analysis revealed that the top functions of the target genes were enriched in the function of
Notch binding, single-stranded DNA endodeoxyribonuclease activity, deoxyribonuclease activity,
cellular response to peptide hormone stimulus and regulation of fatty acid metabolic process (Figure
2A). One of the common related biological processes involved by the notch signaling pathway, DNA
endodeoxyribonuclease, and deoxyribonuclease is apoptosis, which is considered as a powerful
mechanism to curtail viral spread37. However, consequently, viruses have evolved sophisticated
molecular strategies to subvert host cell apoptotic defenses. A couple of studies have investigated the
mechanism by which viruses modulating apoptosis signaling16,38. The targeted gene annotated to the
related GO items included CHAC1 and RAD9A among others, which were targeted by the
virus-encoded miRNA, namely MD2-5p and MR147-3p, respectively (Figure 2B). CHAC1 (cation
transport regulator-like protein 1) is a proapoptotic enzyme and a regulator of Notch signaling. RAD9A
5

is a cell cycle checkpoint protein required for cell cycle arrest and DNA damage repair in response to
DNA damage. RAD9A interacts with BCL-2/BCL-xL, the most important genes that regulate cell death,
and promote apoptosis39. The suppressive role of the SARS-CoV-2-encode miRNAs on these genes
suggested the possible role of them in reducing the host cell apoptotic to subvert host defense.
On the other hand, the involvement of the targeted genes in the biological process of cellular response
to peptide hormone stimulus and regulation of fatty acid metabolic process might imply the role of
them in the pathological damage. Genes enriched in these biological processes included FOXO3,
ADIPOQ, and ADIPOR1, among others. The FOXO family represents a group of transcription factors
that are required for many stress-related transcriptional programs including antioxidant response,
gluconeogenesis, cell cycle control, apoptosis, and autophagy40. FOXO3 is required for antioxidant
responses and autophagy, and altered expression of FOXO3 was observed in Hepatitis C infection and
fatty liver41. ADIPOQ is a gene encodes adiponectin, which regulates both glucose and lipid
metabolism and exerts an insulin-sensitizing effect in the liver. The binding of adiponectin with its
specific receptors, i.e. ADIPOR1/2, induces the activation of a proper signaling cascade that becomes
altered in liver pathologies42. Zhang et. al reported that 2–11% of patients with COVID-19 had liver
comorbidities and 14–53% cases reported abnormal levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate
aminotransferase (AST) during disease progression7. However, it is unclear whether the liver damage
of COVID-2019 patients is caused directly by the viral infection or by the drug toxicity. The analysis
implied the liver dysfunction may be impaired by SARS-COV-2 virus infection through the release of
virus miRNA.

Virus miRNA activate host gene expression
Besides the repression role of miRNA on the target genes, miRNAs were also found to target at
promoter regions of genes to activate their expression43. Therefore, we also searched the targets of
SARS-CoV-2 encoded miRNA on the 5′ UTR of human genes. The 11 virus miRNAs were identified
to be bind to the 5'-UTR of 13 target genes, including the binding between MR385-3p and TGFBR3
(Transforming Growth Factor Beta Receptor 3) is a gene widely expressed on cells of both the innate
and adaptive immune system and it is reported to play a role in promoting Th1 differentiation and
regulation of regulatory T-cell activation and survival44.
Accumulating evidence has proved that miRNA can also activate gene expression by targeting
enhancers region in the nucleus11. We then downloaded the tissue-specific enhancer sequences from
the EnhancerAlta for five tissues which were reported to be affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection, i.e.
lung, gut, spleen, liver, and heart. Target prediction revealed that the lung is with the largest number of
genes targeted by miRNA on the enhancer, followed by spleen and gut (Figure 3A).
Functional annotation of these targeted genes revealed a notable enrichment in chemokine signaling
pathways and cell skeleton related functions, such as actin filament-based process, actin cytoskeleton
organization and cytoskeleton organization in the lung (Figure 3B). For example, MR147-5p targeted at
the putative enhancer region of CXCL16 and ARRB2. CXCL16 was reported to regulate cell-mediated
immunity to salmonella enterica serovar snteritidis via the promotion of gamma Interferon (IFN-γ)
production45. ARRB2 (arrestin beta-2) plays an important role in inflammation, the deficiency of it
abolishes ovalbumin-evoked T lymphocyte and eosinophil infiltration of the lungs and eliminates Th2
6

cytokine production in the lungs. Another category of genes was related to the cell cytoskeleton
organization, e.g. MYH9 (myosin-9) and ITGB5 (Integrin beta-5). Actin cytoskeleton is critical for
viral replication at many stages of the viral life cycle, and viruses can subvert the force-generating and
macromolecular scaffolding properties of the actin cytoskeleton to propel viral surfing, internalization,
and migration within the cell46,47. These observations suggested the possible role of SARS-CoV-2
encoded miRNA in causing increased inflammation in the lung and facilitating the virus invasion.
In the spleen, the target genes were mainly related to the inflammatory response, i.e. regulation of
chronic inflammatory response and positive regulation of chronic inflammatory response to antigenic
stimulus (Figure 3C). For example, MR66-3p was predicted to bind to the enhancer of TNF-α, one of
the most important cytokines in the “cytokine storm”.
In the gut, 54 genes were predicted to be enhanced by 34 miRNAs. The most notable target of the virus
miRNA is TMPRSS2, which is reported to enhance SARS-CoV-2 infection together with ACE248. The
enhancer of TMPRSS2 is targeted by MR147-3p in the gut. Several studies have implicated the
gastrointestinal infection of SARS-CoV-2. Early reports showed that 2–10% of patients with
COVID-19 had gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and vomiting9,49.
SARS-CoV-2 RNA has also been detected in the stool of patients50,51. The putative activation role of
virus-derived MR147-3p might add evidence to the gastrointestinal infection of SARS-CoV-2 and
provided possible mechanisms for the effective evasion of SARS-CoV-2 into gut cells. The most
significant enriched gene function is “transport” (Figure 3D). Transporters involved in the movement
of ions, small molecules, and macromolecules, such as another protein, across a biological membrane,
and play an important role in the maintenance of intestine equilibrium52.
In the liver, the virus miRNA mainly regulates genes involved in the function of actin filament severing
and regulation of cellular protein metabolic process (Figure 3E). MR198-3p act on the enhancer of
ADAR, an adenosine deaminases that act on RNA. ADAS is also indicated to act as a suppressor of
IFN system responses in various virus infections53. It has been reported that a substantial proportion of
COVID-19 patients showed signs of various degrees of liver damage, the mechanism and implication
of which have not yet been determined. The multiple targets of SARS-CoV-2 encoded miRNA on the
enhancer of genes which were highly expressed in the liver implicated a possible role of virus miRNA
on the liver damage of COVID-19.
The MYH9 (non-muscle myosin heavy chain 9) was enhanced by SARS-CoV-2 derived MR359-5p in
all the detected tissues except for the heart. In a study on PRRS virus (Porcine reproductive and
respiratory syndrome virus), a positive sense, single-stranded RNA virus that causes highly infectious
porcine disease, MYH9 has been proved to provide a bridge between the attachment of virus particles
to cell surface receptors and the subsequent un-coating events required for genomic release within the
host cell54. RXRA is another gene that may be activated by virus-encoded miRNA MR328-5p in the
four tissue mentioned above. A study has shown that RXRA over-expression or ligand activation
increases host susceptibility to viral infections in vitro and in vivo by attenuates host antiviral response
through suppressing type I interferon55. The putative upregulation of MYH9 and RARA by
virus-encoded miRNA might provide additional evidence for the invasion of SARS-CoV-2 to the four
human tissues, as well as a mechanism by which the viruses enter and release from the cells and escape
7

from the innate immune system.

Virus genome hijacks host miRNA to regulate immune response
Several studies have reported that the virus genome can hijack host miRNA to modulate host biological
processes. For example, the virus transcript HSUR of Herpesvirus saimiri (HVS) base pairs with the
host miRNA 27 (miR-27), leading to miRNA degradation in a sequence-specific and
binding-dependent manner, and subsequent activation of infected T cells; HCMV produces a
bicistronic mRNA that mediates degradation of cellular miR-17/miR-20a family miRNAs similarly.
A total of 28 human miRNA were predicted to target at the SARS-Cov-2 genome. Since these miRNAs
were hijacked by the virus genome, we could suppose that the genes that originally targeted by these
miRNA could be affected. There were more than human 800 genes were predicted to be regulated by
these miRNA (Figure 4A), and a notable enrichment at the immune system process was observed
(Figure 4B). Among the hijacked miRNAs, miR-146 was reported as one of the key modulators of the
immune response. Studies in mice have shown that miR-146b-/- mice displayed enlarged spleens,
increased myeloid cell populations both in spleen and bone marrow and spontaneously develop
intestinal inflammation56. Another miRNA, miR-939, though no target was predicted, was proposed to
regulate proinflammatory genes by experiment. Increasing miR-939 levels should restore homeostasis
by decreasing inflammatory protein synthesis57. Our result posed a possibility that the hijack of human
miRNA by the SARS-Cov-2 genome might contribute to the abnormal immunity activation in patients
with COVID-19.

Virus genomic region targeted by virus and host miRNA
The SARS-Cov-2 genome consists of 11 open reading frames (ORF), including ORF1ab, which
encoding 16 nonstructural proteins, followed by those encode structure proteins, i.e. S (spike protein),
E (envelope protein), M (membrane protein), and N (nucleocapsid protein), and six accessory proteins
(3a, 6, 7a, 7b, 8, and 10)58. Previous studies have shown that miRNAs derived from both virus genome
and host can target viral transcript and regulate the virus infection14. We then explore the targets of both
virus and host cell-derived miRNAs on the SARS-CoV-2 genome.
There were 27 SARS-CoV-2 encoded miRNA that can target the virus genome (Figure 5A). Forty-three
targets were predicted for the 27 miRNAs and most of them were bind to the ORFlab region (Figure
5B), the longest ORF in the SARS-Cov-2 genome. There were 2 miRNA targets at the 5′ UTR of the
virus genome, and 2 at the S gene, which encodes a spike glycoprotein to bind its receptor ACE2 on
human cells, and mediates membrane fusion and virus entry(5).
Twenty-eight human miRNAs were predicted to have 30 targets on the SASRS-CoV-2 genome (Figure
5B). Most of the human miRNAs were bind to the ORF1ab, where the enzymes for virus replication
and translation were encoded. Followed by 7 miRNA targeted at the N genes of the virus, and 2 at the 5′
UTR. It has been reported that miR-323, miR-491, and miR-654 inhibit replication of the H1N1
influenza A virus through binding to the polymerase PB1 gene20. And miR-122 binding to the HCV
genome alters the structure of the 5′ UTR in a manner that promotes viral RNA translation. A human
miRNA, hsa-miR-4661-3p, was predicted to target at the genomic region 25,296-25,320 within S genes
(21,563-25,384), which is the potential 3′ UTR of the S gene transcript (Figure 5C). This observation
8

suggested a possible repressor role of hsa-miR-4661-3p on the SARS-CoV-2 S gene expression. It
might be an example of the antiviral mechanism except for immune response adopted by the host to
defense virus.
These results implicated the possible role of both virus and host cell-derived miRNA in the life cycle
and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. Since the transcriptome landscape of the SARS-Cov-2 is largely
unknown, further researches in characterizing the genomic and transcriptomic features of it may
enlighten the role of miRNAs in regulating the virus gene expression and infection.

Mutations in virus genome affect miRNA function
Mutations accumulated since the SARS-CoV-2 emerged, studies have implicated that the mutations on
the virus genome may lead to an attenuated phenotype of SARS-CoV-2. We, therefore, explored
whether miRNA encoded by either virus or human contributed to the fitness of SARS-CoV-2 to human.
A total of 810 mutations on the SARS-CoV-2 genome were collected from China National Center for
Bioinformation, including 646 SNPs, 19 indels and 145 deletions (Figure 1B). There were 33
pre-miRNAs located within the mutant region, i.e. 30 pre-miRNAs overlapped with SNPs and 4
located in the deletion region, and the number of mutations within each pre-miRNA ranges from 1 to 5.
We then examined the effect of genomic mutations on the generation of miRNA in SARS-CoV-2. MFE
is an indicator of the hairpin stability of pre-miRNA, the stability of pre-miRNA hairpin structure will
be reduced with the increase of MFE. Compared with the wild-type pre-miRNA, the MFE of the
mutant pre-miRNAs were significantly increased (paired Wilcox test p-value = 3.585e-05, Figure 6A),
indicating an overall decreased stability of the mutant-genome encoded pre-miRNA. The most affected
pre-miRNA is MR369 with MFE increased from -21.7 kCal/mol to -14.7 kCal/mol, which was
considered to not be able to form stable hairpin structure after introducing the mutations (Figure 6B).
We then focused on the miRNAs with increased MFE scores and those located in the deletion regions.
In the lung, human genes targeted by these miRNAs at enhancers were enriched in the function of
positive regulation of MHC class I biosynthetic process, which refers to two genes, i.e. CITTA and
NLRC5. CITTA is targeted by MR288-5p, and NLRC5 by MD202-5p. The protein encoded by CIITA
is located in the nucleus and acts as a positive regulator of class II major histocompatibility complex
gene transcription, and is referred to as the "master control factor" for the expression of these
genes. NLRC5 is a member of the NLR family that acts as a transcriptional activator of MHC class I
genes. Silencing of NLRC5 resulted in increased IL-6, TNF, CXCL5, and IL-1β secretion，at the same
time decreased secretion of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-1059. The intact pre-miRNA is predicted
to generate mature miRNA that enhancer the gene expression of both CIITA and NLRC5, resulting in
an enhanced inflammation. While in the mutant genome, the generation of these miRNAs might be
disturbed, thus the enhanced effect was relieved. Additionally, in the spleen, a couple of target genes
were enriched in the cytokine-mediated signaling pathway that was missed by the mutant pre-miRNA,
including CCR6, OAS1, POMC, XAF1, TNFAIP3, CANX, NLRC5, SQSTM1, and CD27. These
results suggested that the mutation in the region overlapped with miRNA might contribute to the
attenuated phenotype of SARS-CoV-2 by changing the miRNA repertories encode by the virus.
Next, we further explore the alteration of host miRNA target on the mutation virus genome.
9

Twenty-two human miRNA can bind to the mutant genome, with 16 overlapped with those binding to
the wild type genome (Figure 6C). The genes targeted by the newly recruited miRNA were annotated
to the function of epithelial cell differentiation, actin filament fragmentation and so like, while the gene
targeted by the miRNA specific binding to the wild type genome were annotated to the immune
response-related progress (Figure 6D). The two miRNA as we described before, i.e. hsa-miR-939-5p
and hsa-miR-146b-3p, which were involved in maintaining homeostasis by decreasing inflammatory,
were predicted to be not capable of binding to the mutant wild type genome. Taken together, we
speculate that the mutant type of virus might relieve the high level of immunity response, even the
cytokine storm, which leads to the serve symptom or dead of COVID-2019, but on the other hand,
enhance the invasion of the virus by intensifying the regulation of the epithelial differential and actin
filament fragmentation, through attracting different batches of host miRNAs.

miRNA view of the difference between SARS-CoV-2 with other human coronaviruses
Comparing with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 appears to have higher transmission rates,
but lower mortality1,2. To explore whether and how miRNA implicated in this difference between them,
we predicted the miRNAs encoded by MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, as well as HCoV-NL63, a coronavirus
that causes mild symptoms in human and uses the same acceptor with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2
for cellular entry (ACE2), using the same pipeline as applied SARS-CoV-2. The largest putative
virus-encoded miRNA repository, i.e. 212 mature miRNAs, was detected from the MERS-CoV genome
(Table 1), followed by SARS-CoV with 168 miRNAs and SARS-CoV-2 with 90 miRNAs.
HCoV-NL63 encodes the least number of miRNAs (64 miRNAs). Furthermore, the number of targets
on the virus genome binding by the host miRNA follows the same trend (Table 1).
Functional analysis revealed that high enrichment of genes targeted by the virus-encoded miRNAs in
the metabolic process was observed in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but not in SARS-CoV-2 and
HCoV-NL630 (Figure S1A). Enrichment in inflammatory and leukocyte was observed in SARS-CoV-2
and MERS-CoV-2, respectively (Figure S1A). For the genes “hijacked” by virus genome, the
functional keywords were enriched in chemotaxis, cytokine, chemokine and immune for the entire four
viruses studied (Figure S1B), and HCoV-NL63. But the miRNAs targeted at the virus genome were
largely different from each other (Figure S2). These results implicated that differences in miRNA
repositories and miRNA-target interaction might be involved in the pathological difference among the
four coronaviruses.

Conclusions
In summary, this silico study revealed a systematic view of the possible role of the virus-encode
miRNAs as well as the host-derived miRNAs influenced by the SARS-COV-2 infection, which provide
insights from the perspective of miRNA into the biological process involved by the infection (Figure 7).
Impressively, the systematic analysis revealed that the immune response is the function most affected
by the virus-infection introduced miRNA change in repository and targets, which might contribute to
the immune evasion of the virus as well as the abnormal immunity activation in the host. The
SARS-CoV-2-encoded miRNA is also implicated in the cytoskeleton dynamics that facilitating the
virus envision, trafficking within the cell and release. The virus-encode miRNAs were also predicted to
be able to repress the expression of genes involved apoptosis and regulating fatty acid metabolic
process by binding at the 3′ UTR of host genes. Additionally, the host miRNAs hijacked by the virus
10

genome were mostly involved in the immune system process, such as hsa-miR-146b and hsa-miR-939.
Furthermore, the host miRNA hsa-miR-4661-3p was predicted to bind at the potential 3′ UTR of the S
gene transcript with the possible role of a repressor on the expression of S gene. Finally, the genomic
mutation-introduced alterations on the coding ability of virus miRNA and the targets of both virus and
host miRNA might contribute to the attenuated phenotype of SARS-CoV-2 during its evolution. Finally,
the comparison of miRNA repository and targets difference between SARS-CoV-2 with other human
coronaviruses implicated the role of miRNAs in the shared and distinct clinical characteristics of them.
With further experiments to validate the role of candidate miRNAs in vivo, it is promissing to provide
deep insight into the mechisms of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis from the pespective of miRNA.
