Abstract
The article covers electricity demand shift effects due to COVID-19 shutdowns
in various European countries. We utilize high-dimensional regression techniques to
exploit the structural breaks in demand profiles due to the shutdowns. We discuss
the findings with respect to coronavirus pandemic progress and regulatory measures
of the considered countries.

Introduction

The ongoing coronavirus pandemic in 2020 and especially the preventive measures to reduce
the COVID-19 disease changed drastically the patterns of our behaviour. Many countries
in Europe and in the world introduced multiple levels of restrictions: companies sent their
oﬃce employees to work from home, schools and universities closed, many factories limited
or stopped their production, curfews and similar stay-at-home orders. All these factors
impact the energy demand by decreasing the overall level and changing its behaviour.
In this paper, we analyse the change in electricity demand pattern in selected European
countries caused by the COVID-19 shutdowns.
For the analysis we consider the ﬁve most populated countries of the European Union:
Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Poland. The spread of the coronavirus as well as the
undertaken coronavirus measures are on multiple levels in these countries in spring 2020.
Also, the demand shifts are diﬀerent for each of the countries what is depicted in Figure 1.
In Europe, the pandemic started in Italy and this is also reﬂected in the electricity load
change in Figure 1. A very high rise of the number of infected people in the beginning
of the outbreak resulted in a very strict lock-down in the whole country (Flaxman et al.,
2020; Saglietto et al., 2020). Thus, we focus particularly on the electricity demand of Italy.

much lower in Poland.
In the next section, we present the data used for the analysis of the electricity demand.
Then, the utilized methodology and the model are discussed. The fourth section consists of
the results which are presented and analysed separately for Italy and for the other countries.
The last section concludes the paper.

Electricity demand data

The data utilized in purpose of this exercise was downloaded from the publicly available
ENTSO-E (2020) Transparency platform. We use the actual total load data of all mentioned
countries, and they span the data range from 1 January 2016 to 15 April 2020.1
A small part of the data is presented in Figure 2. It shows the electricity demand in
Italy over time during the ongoing pandemic. Moreover, we highlighted the dates of four
nationwide shutdowns. The shutdown of all schools and universities does not seem to have
impacted the electricity load in Italy. Only the introduction of the national quarantine
and then tightening of the lock-down by closing down all non-essential commercial and
retail businesses seem to have ﬁrst impacted the demand. Then, halting all non-necessary
production and industries seem to have deepened the decrease. However, the plotted time
interval is also the beginning of spring. At this time of the year, a decrease of Italian

electricity demand is usually observed. Therefore, in order to recognize whether the change
in the load is shutdown-, season-, or weather-driven we need a sophisticated demand model
to disentangle the reduction eﬀects.

Methodology

For exploiting the structural changes in the electricity demand due to the shutdown we
apply a high-dimensional time series change-point models to the electricity log-load of each
country. As baseline for the analysis of the structural changes we consider a model that
is very similar to the load forecasting model of Ziel and Liu (2016) that was successfully
applied in the framework of the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014 for electricity
load forecasting. We refer for technical details to the aforementioned paper. However,
here we want to describe the relevant model properties that are important to understand
and interpret the results. For the analysis we consider a baseline model that assumes no
structural changes in the data. Then, this model is augmented by change-point components.
First, we describe brieﬂy the baseline model, to proceed with the change-point part.

3.1

Baseline model

The baseline model contains mainly two types of components i) pattern-based time-varying
coeﬃcients and ii) autoregressive eﬀects. The time-varying coeﬃcients vary mainly seasonally and capture daily, weekly and annual eﬀects. For the annual eﬀects we distinguish
between calendar-based eﬀects (e.g. an eﬀect that occurs every speciﬁc calendar date, e.g.
Christmas on 25 December) and eﬀects that are driven from the meteorological cycle with a
periodicity of 365.24 days. The latter contains rather smooth changes as the meteorological
impact changes smoothly over the year. Further, the model contains interactions between
the seasonal components, especially the daily cycle may change over the year. Next to
date-based calendar eﬀects we also include other calendar eﬀects. Most notably holiday
eﬀects from public holiday that have a varying date, e.g. Easter Monday. The intercept of
the considered model changes with all the mentioned time-varying components.
The autoregressive components contain historical load data from the last hour up to

4

the last weeks. However, we only let the most recent information to vary over time with
selected time-varying components, but keep the remaining autoregressive terms constant.
The autoregressive components absorb a lot of information from the past, indirectly also the
information from typical external regressors like temperature. Here, we want to remark
that we double-checked that the additional information of temperature in our model is
negligible. In simple words: If we are at 4 pm today and want to predict the load in
1 hour for today, i.e. at 5 pm, the temperature (forecast) for 5 pm does not help a lot
to improve the load forecast as the temperature information is hidden in the most recent
demand observation at 4 pm, see e.g. Haben et al. (2019) for similar ﬁndings.

3.2

Augmenting structural breaks

Given the baseline model, we augment the time-varying intercept of the model by changepoint components that allow for diﬀerent types of structural breaks. This is:
i) a permanent change in the load level,
ii) a permanent change in the load level for the daily proﬁle (e.g. a load reduction for
only certain hours of the day),
iii) a permanent change in the load level for the weekly proﬁle (e.g. a load reduction for
only certain hours of the week).
These structural breaks are implemented using dummies for relevant time sets. We restrict the space of possible changes to all observations after 1 March 2020 which is before
the coronavirus spread widely in Europe and issued the COVID-19 crisis in Europe. We
estimate the model using lasso which is tuned by the Bayesian information criterion (BIC).
To analyse the results adequately, we estimate the model and then simulate from the
estimated model 10000 times for the time range from 1 March 2020 onwards. This allows
us to get other plausible paths of the eﬀect. We regard the mean of the mentioned 10000
trajectories as the proﬁle under the shutdown. We also simulate from the estimated model
where we set all change-point eﬀects to 0. This allows us to mimic a load situation without
the COVID-19 shutdowns. Again, the corresponding average describes the proﬁle that we
want to compare.

Demand in Italy

Figure 3 extends Figure 2 by adding the models’ and previous year’s curves2 . Let us note a
very similar trajectory of the no-shutdown model to the last year’s one. This indicates that
the model is performing correctly. The only big inconsistency between these paths appears
in the week starting on 13 April 2020. However, this is the week after the moveable Easter
and thus a plausible public holiday eﬀect.

Moreover, we observe that the current year’s electricity demand started to deviate
signiﬁcantly from the no-shutdown model shortly after the third shutdown and it only
deepened with the fourth one. The diﬀerence between the shutdown and no-shutdown
models only conﬁrms that the undertaken measures have heavily impacted the electricity
load in Italy. Nevertheless, the seasonal eﬀect is also present what is depicted by the
slow decrease of the demand level of the model assuming no change-points. Hence, the
shutdown eﬀect is smaller than the naive comparison with pre-shutdown demand suggests.
Another interesting aspect is that the structural change due to the shutdown of the nonnecessary commercial business is quite smooth and requires a couple of days to settle at the
corresponding load level. This suggests that after the mentioned shutdown some businesses

In Figure 4, we present a comparison

and the observed that includes the shutdown eﬀects. The plots can help to understand better the change in the weekly
demand pattern as they are based on the
week from 30 March to 6 April 2020, i.e.
during the time of a signiﬁcant impact of
the shutdowns.
First, let us note the overall decrease of
the load in the shutdown scenario. An interesting eﬀect is the ﬂattened morning peak

(around 8 am - 12 am). This is most probably a result of many people working from home
or not working at all and thus lesser utilization of production capacities, oﬃce building
and electriﬁed public transport etc. Interestingly, the evening peak in demand is preserved
and currently it is clearly the most electricity consuming part of every day in the week.
This is reasonable as because of the lockdown, more people are cooking at home or using
electricity-based entertainment. Furthermore, the diﬀerence in electricity demand between
Saturday and Sunday shrank heavily due to the shutdowns.
Another interesting feature is that we see shifts of the morning load peak within the
day. This is best visible on Sundays: usually at 7 am the load level would increase by
about 2.5GWh (≈ 10% of the night load) from the night level. During the shutdown the
increase starts later, at 7am we still remain at the night level load. A plausible explanation
would be a ’getting up late’-eﬀect. So the Italians tend to sleep longer during the lockdown
period.

Demand in other European countries

Figure 5 presents the electricity demand in the other considered countries: Germany,
France, Spain and Poland. The overall pattern of the rising deviation between the shutdown
and no-shutdown models is similar to the one in Italy, but respectively delayed. However,
the level of the deviation diﬀers among the states, what was already depicted in Figure 1.
Interestingly, in France we observe an impact of the shutdowns before they went live. The
reason may be that the limitations were announced accordingly earlier and the residents
and companies of France may have started changing their public activity earlier, following
the other countries’ recommendations. Furthermore, even before the national lock-down
all big events, football matches etc. were being cancelled. However, there might be interactions with the export of electricity (esp. to Italy) and temperature eﬀects. Concerning
the latter, the period from 21 March to 2 April was relatively cold in Europe, and France
has a high temperature dependency in the electricity demand due to large electric heating
capacities.
Figure 6 shows the comparison of weekly demand over hours of the day between the
shutdown and no-shutdown scenarios for Germany, France, Spain and Poland. Again, the
plots are based on the week from 30 March to 6 April 2020. Similarly as in the Italian
case, we observe an overall demand decrease for every country. Let us note that except
of the level change, the weekly demand pattern remained almost the same in Germany.
On the other hand, in France, Spain and Poland the ﬂattening of the morning peak and
preserving the evening peak are present similarly as in Italy. This can be also explained by
lesser activity in the morning connected to the professional life and remained or even higher
activity in the evening due to entertainment. The ’getting up late’-pattern is also visible
in all the considered countries. Still, it is most distinct in the Mediterranean countries:
France and Spain.

Conclusion

The shutdowns introduced due to the COVID-19 pandemic have impacted signiﬁcantly
both the level of the electricity demand in Europe and its weekly pattern. The revocation

Figure 6: Weekly electricity demand (GWh) in Germany, France, Spain and Poland in the

of the shutdowns and the end of the pandemic should in theory slowly turn back the
electricity demand to the pre-pandemic volumes. However, in practice it may appear that
the pandemic has made a permanent inﬂuence on the behavioural patterns.
