Abstract
Short wavelength ultraviolet (UV-C) light deactivates DNA of any germs, including
multiresistive bacteria and viruses like COVID-19. Two-dimensional (2D) material-based UV-C
light emitting diodes can potentially be integrated into arbitrary surfaces to allow for shadowfree surface disinfection. In this work, we perform a series of first-principles calculations to
identify the core components of ultrathin LEDs based on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). The
electrons and holes are predicted to be confined in multiple quantum wells (MQWs) by
combining hBN layers with different stacking orders. Various p- and n-doping candidates for
hBN are assessed, and the relative p- and n-type metal contacts with low Schottky barrier heights
are identified. The findings are summarized in a concrete UV-C LED structure proposal.

Introduction
Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are among the most efficient electroluminescent light sources1.
The deep ultraviolet (UV-C) light2 and their corresponding LEDs with wavelengths shorter than
260 nm are applicable to disinfection and sterilization3, 4, photocatalysis5, 6, sensors7, 8, etc9, 10.
UV-C LEDs require materials with wide band gap, such as AlN11 or diamond12. Hexagonal
boron nitride (hBN) is a particularly interesting candidate13, 14 for its reported wide band gap and
two-dimensional (2D) layered structure. More importantly, it can potentially be integrated in
arbitrary surfaces which can enable shadow-free surface disinfection15-17. The hBN-based
flexible and wearable devices are imaginable as well18-20. Previous theoretical and experimental
studies show that 2D hBN layers can be stacked in various orders15, 21-24. The stacking order is
predicted to affect the electronic properties of hBN 15, 25 and can therefore serve as a design tool
for the electronic structure of hBN-based devices. Many requirements for hBN-based LEDs have
been achieved already, covering the confirmation of UV-C light emission26, 27, the doping of
hBN with p-type28, 29 and n-type30 carriers, the fabrication of heterostructures14, 31, and the
synthesis of large high-quality single crystals32. In spite of the open debate on the direct or
indirect nature of the band gap for hBN16, 17, it shows bright luminescence16, 33 . For example, a
plane-emission device based on hBN and field-emission arrays showed a stable output power of
0.2 mW at 225 nm27.

In this work, missing elements of hBN-based UVC-LEDs are addressed. Stacking order
variations are shown to confine electrons and holes in hBN-based multi-quantum wells (MQWs).
This carrier confinement is found to have a direct band gap and thus allow for efficient light
emission. Schottky barrier heights between hBN and various metals are calculated and preferred
metal/hBN combinations are identified. The findings are summarized into a concrete UV-C LED
structure proposal.

Method
All density functional theory (DFT) calculations of this work were run with the VASP34, 35
simulation package. In most parts, the GGA-PBE36 functionals are applied due to their numerical
efficiency. Only when explicitly mentioned, the numerically more expensive HSE0637
functionals are used to verify key GGA results. The cutoff energy was set to 400 eV throughout.
The slab model with a vacuum space of over 20 Å is used to simulate each 2D system. The
Monkhorst-Pack grids are dependent on the size of the cell. For instance, a 12 × 12 × 4 (12 × 12
× 1) grid is selected in the self-consistent field iteration for bulk (few-layer) hBN. The
convergence criterion for the total energy is 0.01 meV at each self-consistent field iteration. We
set the Fermi level to be zero in all cases.

Results
1 Stacking order and thickness effects
Five different stacking orders, AA’, AB’, A’B, AB, and AA (Fig.1 a-e), are known for hBN15.
The AA’ and AB stacking have been confirmed in experiments21, 22, 24. Although the AB’

stacking is predicted to be substable, some experimental results indicate its existence23. The A’B
and AA stacking configurations are unstable and have not been found in experiments so far15, 38,
39

. Deterministic placement of 2D materials with van der Waals interaction between the layers

has enabled atomic precision in the fabrication of modern heterostructures. It is still imaginable
that deterministic placement could allow for a few-layer AA stacked hBN. Once such stacking is
produced, switching from AA to other configurations require interlayer sliding forces39, 40 similar
to the friction forces of few layer graphene. This could stabilize an AA stacking configuration
within a hBN heterojunction. With previous work showing marginal differences of the lattice
constants of hBN with different stacking orders15, 16, 38, an in-plane lattice constant of 0.25nm and
an interplane distance of 0.333nm is adopted for all hBN systems in this work16.
Consistent with previous theoretical results15, 41, all hBN configurations show indirect band gaps.
The band gap of bulk hBN stacked in AB, AA’, AB’, A’B, or AA order decreases with energies
as 4.4 (5.7), 4.2 (5.6), 3.6 (4.9), 3.2 (4.4), 3.1 (4.3) eV calculated by GGA (HSE06), respectively.
The hBN in stacking of AA’, A’B, and AB has the top of the valence band at or near the K point
and the bottom of the conduction band at the M point, while the other two stacking orders (AA
and AB’ stackings) have band edges at/near H and K points. For sub-stable AB’ configuration,
the direct conduction-to-valence-band transition is only about 0.04 eV higher than the indirect
gap (Fig. S1). Although the valence and conductance bands of the five stacking forms are mainly
contributed by pz orbitals of nitrogen and boron atoms, respectively, the atomic contributions
and orbital arrangement are slightly different. For example, the partial charge density of the
bottom of conductance band of A’B show higher contributions of pz from nitrogen atoms than
the other. The conductance band edges of AA and AB’ stacking forms show stronger pz-pz
interlayer interaction than the systems.

There are various experimental methods that produce high-quality few-layer 2D hBN systems24.
Few-layer hBN systems show increased band gap compared to bulk cases because of quantum
confinement42, 43. The thickness-dependent band gap solved with GGA and HSE06 are shown in
Figs.1 f-j. The band gap variation with thickness follows a second order function, i.e. it is
proportional to the inverse second power of the number of layers. It is worthwhile to note that
few-layer hBN systems have the same relative order of band gaps w.r.t stacking order as the bulk
scenarios. The locations in the momentum space of the top of the valence band and the bottom of
the conduction band of few-layer hBN agree with the respective bulk locations. For example, the
4-layer 2D hBN (Fig. 1 k-o) with AA’, A’B, and AB stacking orders still show indirect band
gap. The top of the valence band is near or at the K point and the conduction band minimum is at
the M point. A close-to direct band gap is predicted in the 4-layer AB’ and AA hBN: 4 layers of
AB’ hBN have the conduction band edge at the K point and the valence band edge very close to
the K point. 4 layers of AA hBN yield the valence band edge at K and conduction band edges at
K and M with energy differences less than 0.04 eV. The close-to direct band gaps of few-layer
AA and AB’ stackings are the most relevant hBN candidates for LEDs. Mengle et. al41 have also
noticed that the bilayer AA and AB’ stacking hBN show direct gap. Furthermore, they
constructed a randomly stacked 10-layer hBN and found it has a direct gap which is 49 meV
smaller than the indirect gap. To be noticed, both GGA and HSE06 functionals give similar band
curves, charge density, and relative gap orders, and thus GGA can serve as numerically efficient
estimate when specific gap values are not a critical simulation parameter.

2 Multiple quantum wells (MQWs)
Light emitting diodes typically use quantum wells to trap electrons and holes for a higher
radiative recombination probability9, 44. The stacking order dependence of the effective band gap
of hBN layers allows designing all-hBN multi-quantum well heterostructures. The AA’ stacking
direction yields a large band gap (see Fig.1) and can serve as barrier material. Embedding either
AA or A’B stacked hBN layers in AA’ layers is expected to form quantum wells for electrons
and holes. This is confirmed in Figs.2, which show two periodic superlattices of hBN composed
of several hBN layers of varying stacking orders. Fig. 2a shows a superlattice with 4 layers of
AA’ stacking, alternating with 5 layers of AB’ stacking (labeled MQW-T1). Note that the
interface between AB’ and AA’ effectively represents an AA bilayer. Another superlattice
composed of unit cells of 3 layers of AA stacking and 6 layers of AA’ stacking is displayed in
Fig. 2b (labeled MQW-T2). The MQW-T1 structure yields a direct band gap of 3.50 (4.79) eV in
GGA (HSE06) calculations. By analyzing the partial charge density, we find clear quantum
confinement of the states in the AA layers (Fig. 2e). The confined states are in the energy range
between -0.21 (-0.24) eV to 0.00 (0.00) eV and in AB’ region for energy of 3.50 (4.79) eV to
4.16 (5.50) eV solved with GGA (HSE06). The energy range of the confined states equals the
band offsets between wells and barriers in Fig. 2c. For MQW-T2, the band gap is 3.39 (4.60) eV
in GGA (HSE06) calculations, and the conduction band edges at K and M points differ by 0.01
(0.07) eV. Similar state confinement in wells has been found with the band offsets of 0.56 (0.63)
eV and 0.38 (0.43) eV for electron and hole, respectively. The band offsets of the proposed
MQWs are comparable to other UVC LEDs10. Bulk hBN has shown considerable photoemission
probability33. However, the light emission is expected to be greatly enhanced by breaking the
stacking symmetry41 and tailoring the stacking sequences carefully, especially introducing AA or

AB’ stacking wells, due to the direct (quasi-direct) band gap and carrier confinement. It is
worthwhile to mention that bulk or few-layer hBN without any AA or AB’ stacking sequences
always have indirect gap according to our tests.

3 Doping of hBN
LED structures are typically built upon a pn junction. To facilitate the doping profile in
experiments, foreign atoms are usually implemented in the respective material28, 30, 45-47. We
model the doped hBN with a superlattice of 4x4 primitive hBN unit cells and replace one B atom
with either Si, Mg, or Be. The relaxation of these doped structures results in an increase of the
unit cell by about 2 % (shown in Figs. 3 a-c). The predicted electronic density of states (DOS) in
Fig. 3 d shows that doping of a monolayer of hBN with Si atoms moves the Fermi level by about
0.2 eV into the conduction band. In contrast, the Fermi level lies 0.3 eV deep in the valence band
for Be and 0.4 eV for Mg doping. Note that Si and Be atoms have been shown in experiments to
yield n-doping and p-doping in hBN, respectively28, 30.

4 Schottky barrier of hBN-metal contacts
Schottky barrier heights are dependent on the chemical potential difference and atomic
configurations of the respective contacts. Every different doping setup has a different appropriate
contact material. The Schottky barrier resulting from four lead materials, i.e. Co, Ni, Au, and
graphite when in contact with hBN is assessed here. Following Ref. 48, hBN/metal contacts are
modeled with 4 layers of AA’ hBN set on 6 layers of the metal contacts. The cross sectional size

of the sample is 1x1 unit cells for hBN on hpc-Co (0001), fcc-Ni(111), and hpc-graphite (0001).
When hBN is interfaced with fcc-Au(111), 2x2 unit cells are used (see Figs. 4 a-d). The
relaxation of two layers of hBN and two layers of the respective contact material closest to the
interface is based on the optB88-vdW-DF functional which includes the van der Waals
interactions between hBN and the contact material. The remaining layers are assumed to be
unstrained. The resulting lattice mismatch is less than 2% in all considered interfaces. Electronic
band structures solved with GGA-PBE functionals on the relaxed structures are shown in Figs.
4e-h. The projections on B and N atoms are highlighted in green and red, respectively. The
comparison with the total band structure (black lines in Figs 4e-h) allows to identify the electron
and hole Schottky barriers (e and h) as the difference of the hBN/metal contact Fermi levels
with the respective hBN band edges

 e = EC − EF
 h = EF − EV

(1),

respectively. Here EF is the Fermi energy level of the hBN/metal contact, EC (EV) is the
conduction (valence) band edge of intrinsic hBN, which can be extracted by projected atomic
contributions of boron and nitride atoms to the total band structure of hBN/metal interfaces. The
results in Table 1 identify Au and graphite as good contact metal candidates for p-doped hBN.
Co and Ni are suitable to connect n-doped hBN. Note that the Schottky barriers for hBN/fccCo(111) show very similar heights as hBN/hcp-Co(0001) (within 0.1 eV, see Fig. S2). When
hBN is doped, the Schottky barriers get further reduced (as exemplified in Fig. (S3)).

5 Summary
Figure 5 summarizes the findings of our DFT calculations into a concrete proposal of an ultrathin
UVC-LED structure. The MQWs with clear quantum confinement are built up using hBN with
different thickness and stacking orders. Au and graphite are good candidates for p metals, while
Ni and Co can be used for n metals. The n-doping and p-doping hBN can be realized by
implanting Si and Be/Mg atoms, respectively. Our results give clear guidance to experimentalists
and is possible to be realized soon.

hBN/graphite interface with one B atom replaced with Bi. The full bands are solid lines in black,
projections on B atoms are marked in green and projections on N atoms in red. The VASP
solution of the density of states, Fermi levels and band edges result in an effective doping density
of 1.4x1022 cm-3 under fully ionization assumption.
