Despite the huge effort to contain the infection, the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has rapidly
become pandemics, mainly due to its extremely high human-to-human transmission capability, and
a surprisingly high viral charge of symptom-less people. While the seek of a vaccine is still ongoing,
promising results have been obtained with antiviral compounds. In particular, lactoferrin is found to
have beneficial effects both in preventing and soothing the infection. Here, we explore the possible
molecular mechanisms with which lactoferrin interferes with SARS-CoV-2 cell invasion, preventing
attachment and/or entry of the virus. To this aim, we search for possible interactions lactoferrin
may have with virus structural proteins and host receptors. Representing the molecular iso-electron
surface of proteins in terms of 2D-Zernike descriptors, we (i) identified putative regions on the
lactoferrin surface able to bind sialic acid receptors on the host cell membrane, sheltering the cell
from the virus attachment; (ii) showed that no significant shape complementarity is present between
lactoferrin and the ACE2 receptor, while (iii) two high complementarity regions are found on the
N- and C-terminal domains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, hinting at a possible competition
between lactoferrin and ACE2 for the binding to the spike protein.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Lactoferrin (Lf) is a versatile glycoprotein, which plays
a key role in many biological functions [1]. In this work,
we focus on the Lf as a crucial player in natural immunity,
since it has been proposed to play a strong antiviral activity against a wide range of RNA and DNA viruses [2–6].
Lf is composed of a single chain of about 700 residues
folded into two symmetrical lobes. Each lobe possesses a
metal-binding site, able to bind iron but also other ions
like Cu2+ , Zn2+ and M n3+ [7, 8].
This protein is present in saliva, tears, seminal fluid,
white blood cells, and milk of mammals [9]. From its
discovery in 1939 [10, 11] lactoferrin has been identified
as the most important iron-binding protein in milk. Besides, in recent years, lactoferrin has been found involved
in a multitude of biological processes. In fact, despite
the name, the iron cargo capacity of Lf is not the prominent activity exerted by this molecule. Instead, it performs antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer activities [8, 12], together with a broad antimicrobial action
against bacteria and fungi. The latter activity, in particular, is due to Lf’s ability to reversibly bind two atoms
of iron with high affinity in the presence of bicarbonate. The iron-free form of Lf, apo-lactoferrin (apoLf),
deprives bacteria of iron, thus inhibiting their metabolic
activities in vivo.
Besides all the aforementioned activities, Lf has been
demonstrated to prevent infection of a wide range of diverse viral species [13].
Many viruses make use of glycans, such as sialic acid
(SIA) or glycosaminoglycan, like heparan sulfate (HF) as
attachment factors. See, for example, [14] for details on
glycans. When the contact between the virus particle and
these receptors is established, they roll toward their spe-

cific viral receptor and subsequently enter the host cell,
for instance by fusing with the host cell membrane [15].
While the interaction between Lf and HF has been
observed [16], studies on its interaction with sialic acid
derivatives are still missing. On the other hand, Lf has
been reported to interact with virus structural proteins,
S, M, and E [17].
In general, depending on the specifics of the virus,
lactoferrin prevents infection of the target cell by either
(i) interfering with the attachment factor or (ii) by binding to host cell molecules that the virus uses as a receptor
or co-receptor (competition) or (iii) by direct binding to
virus particles, as described for herpesvirus [18], polioand rotavirus [19, 20], and possibly human immunodeficiency virus [21]. See, for example, [22] for a more
detailed discussion.
While we are writing this article, a novel virus, first
observed in the autumn of 2019, has rapidly become
pandemic. This virus, called SARS-CoV-2, belongs to
the coronavirus family and causes severe acute respiratory syndrome [23, 24], somewhat similar to those caused
by two other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERSCoV, which crossed species in 2002-2004 [25, 26] and
2012 [27]. In fact, SARS-CoV-2, similarly to SARSCoV and MERS-CoV, attacks the lower respiratory system, thus provoking viral pneumonia. However, this infection can also lead to effects on the gastrointestinal
system, heart, kidney, liver, and central nervous system
[24, 28, 29].
As for SARS-CoV [30–32], recent in vivo experiments
confirmed that also SARS-CoV-2 cell entry is mediated by high-affinity interactions between the receptorbinding domain (RBD) of the virus S glycoprotein
and the human-host Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
(ACE2) receptor [33]. The spike protein is located on the

2
virus envelope and promotes the host attachment and fusion between the viral and cellular membrane. [34, 35].
Structural studies determined the structures of such protein both in free form and bound to ACE2 [36]. Further
studies investigate the possible interaction of SARS-CoV2 to sialic acids [37–40] or heparan surfate receptors [39],
both considered involved in SARS-CoV-2 as well as in
other coronavirus infections [14, 16, 41–43].
While the use of Lf as an antiviral against previous
coronaviruses infections has been poorly investigated, except for [16], where evidence of an effect in the attachment process is shown, new studies are proving the antiviral effect of Lactoferrin against the novel SARS-CoV2 infection. In particular, administration of a liposomal
formulation of Lf to a significant sample of Covid-19 positive patients, has been shown to provide an immediate
beneficial effect [44].
Here, we computationally investigate the possible
molecular mechanisms behind the observed antiviral action of lactoferrin. In particular, we make use of a recently developed computational protocol based on the
2D Zernike Polynomials, able to rapidly characterize the
shape conformation of given protein regions [37]. In this
framework using a simple pairwise distance, it is possible
to evaluate the similarity between 2 protein pockets or
the shape complementarity between the binding regions
of 2 interacting proteins.
In order to assess whether lactoferrin could influence
the attachment factors, we investigated the ability of Lt
to bind to sialic acid (SIA) or heparan sulfate (HS) receptors [14], both considered involved in SARS-CoV-2
infection [37–40] as well as to other coronavirus infections [16, 41–43].
We moreover checked for a possible direct interaction
between LF and ACE2 receptor, which could inhibit the
interplay between spike and ACE2 binding necessary to
the virus infection.
Finally, we investigate the possible interaction between
Lf and the 3 proteins present on the SARS-CoV-2 membrane, i.e. the spike (S), membrane (M), and envelope
(E) proteins.

II.

RESULTS

The entry of the virus inside the host cells requires the
occurrence of a sequence of molecular interactions. Sialoside (SIA) and/or heparan sulfate (HF) chains mediate
the attachment of the virion to the cell surface. Once
in the proximity of the cellular receptor (ACE2), SARSCoV-2 spike protein binds to the receptor and initiates
the internalization process. Figure 1a shows a sketch of
the mechanism. The observed antiviral action of Lf may
consist of interference in one or more of those steps. We
thus investigate in the next three sections the possibility
of direct binding between lactoferrin and SIA, ACE2, and
SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, respectively (see Figure 1b).

A.

Interaction with SIA

Possible binding regions for sialic acid, the terminal molecule of the SIA receptors on human lactoferrin
are investigated on the basis of the procedure described
in [37], i.e. we select the portion of the molecular surface
of the MERS-CoV spike protein in interaction with sialic
acid, experimentally solved in [45] (Figure 2a), and we
search for similar patches on the Lf molecular surface.
Within the same strategy, we search for similar patches
on the surface of human lactoferrin.
In the 2D Zernike framework, the geometrical shape of
a protein surface patch is compactly summarized in a set
of ordered numerical descriptors, whose number - 121 in
our case - modulate the detail of the description. Dealing with ordered numerical descriptors, the comparison
between different protein patch can be performed with a
Euclidean distance.
Figure 2b and c show the four most geometrically similar patches identified in the Apo and Holo form of Lf.
An a posteriori check of the electrostatic potential on the
patches, allows us to select only some of the possible solutions identified based on the shape comparison analysis,
i.e. the ones having also a similar electrostatic surface
with the SIA binding site on the MERS-CoV spike.
The region on Lf surface identified as the most similar
to the MERS region interacting with sialic acid, both in
shape and in electrostatics, is the one centered on VAL
346.

B.

Interaction with ACE2

To check whether the action of lactoferrin can be ascribed to a competition with the virion spike proteins
in binding directly the ACE2 receptor (Figure 1), we
performed a blind search of the molecular surfaces of
both ACE2 and human Lf to identify possible binding
regions having a meaningful shape complementarity. Under this hypothesis, if the interaction between the Lf and
the ACE2 receptor occurs, Lf could hinder the molecular binding between the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2
and the corresponding ACE2 receptor. Figure 3 shows
the molecular surface of the ACE2 receptor colored according to its propensity to bind regions of the Lf protein.
The redder the region, the greater the shape complementarity between that region and another one found on the
surface of the putative molecular partner, i.e. holo lactoferrin. As one can see from Figure 3, a complementary
region is indeed present, however, it is located far from
the binding site of the spike (grey in the figure) and in a
part of ACE2 that looks toward the membrane. To better visualize the result, we have represented two points of
view of the binding between spike and ACE2, one rotated
180o with respect to the other. On the other hand, we
can see that the ACE2 region interacting with the SARSCoV-2 spike protein has no low shape complementarity
with Lf regions.

chains present on glycoproteins (PG) of the cell membrane are thought to facilitate the attachment of the virion to the cell
surface. This favors the establishment of an interaction between the virus spike protein and the ACE2 receptor, which starts
the internalization of the virus in the host cell. b) Human lactoferrin has been found to play an antiviral action against SARSCoV-2 infection although it is not clear whether this action consists in (1) competition for the binding with glycan chains,
and/or (2) competition for binding ACE2 receptor and/or (3) direct interaction with one of the proteins in the virion envelope,
i.e. with S, M or E proteins.

C.

Interaction with virion membrane proteins

A third possible mechanism at the basis of the observed
antiviral activity of Lf could be ascribed to a direct interaction with the membrane proteins present on the virion
envelope. In particular, SARS-CoV-2 presents three different kinds of proteins on its membrane, i.e. S, M, and
E proteins [46, 47]. While the 3D structure of the S protein has been determined - even if some loop regions in
the S1 sub-unit are not solved - unfortunately, no structures are available for the E and M proteins. Thus, the
molecular surfaces of Lf were compared with those of the
three proteins in order to check whether an interaction
with lactoferrin is possible. For this analysis, we adopted
the same computational procedure used in the previous
paragraph.

For both S, M, and E proteins, we sample their whole
molecular surface and compared all the possible patches
with those of Lf. In this way, all molecular surfaces, both
membrane proteins, and Lf ones are colored according to
the corresponding binding propensity.
E and M presented a possible region of interactions
located in the intra-membrane region (data not shown).
The most robust and relevant result of this analysis regards the compatibility between the spike and lactoferrin.
According to our findings, Lf presents two regions of high
complementarity with one portion of the C-terminal domain of the spike S1 subunit and another located in the
N-terminal part.
To test the reliability of the found signals, we performed a molecular dynamics simulation of the spike
trimer (see Methods for details) and sampled 5 configurations for each of the three chains at equilibrium (see

Molecular surfaces are colored according to the Coulombic potential.

Figure 4a).
In particular, for each chain, we performed a Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) on the frames of the dynamics and thus projected them on the plane identified by the
two principal components. Upon clustering these points
we obtain 5 subgroups. For each subgroup, we extract the
centroidal configuration. Since distant points in the PCA
plane correspond to the different 3D structure, picking
one point from each identified cluster assured that the
selected configurations have high structural differences
between them in the explored configuration space (see
Figure 4b).
Remarkably, repeating the blind search for complementarity regions on the 15 surfaces of the extracted
spike monomers, we found conservation of the signal over
the conformational noise. Figure 4c) shows the identified
regions and their conservation in the different sampled
frames.
Among the found regions, the one involving the spike
C-terminal domain is the one with higher shape complementarity. In particular, according to our method, human lactoferrin could interact with the spike protein with
the surface region centered in residue ALA 539. Alternatively, the spike protein may interact with the Lf pro-

tein using a molecular patch centered in the residue PHE
490. It must be pointed out that the complementarity
achieved by these patches is comparable with those of
experimentally solved complexes. Indeed, analyzing the
shape complementarity of over 4600 x-ray protein-protein
complexes (see Methods for details), we have the distribution shown in Figure 4d, where the lower the distance
the higher the complementarity of the binding region.
Red dotted line shows the complementarity found between the spike and Lt. As it is evident the proposed
patch is characterized by values of shape complementarity typical of experimental complexes.
Finally, to further support this result with an independent and external methodology to our approach, we
performed a completely blind molecular docking analysis between the spike protein and the Lf protein. To
this end, Zdock server was used as a state of the art of
molecular docking software [48]. As per default settings,
only the first 10 docking poses have been selected and the
predicted contacts analyzed. In particular, five out of ten
poses show bindings involving the spike region involve the
region we found with our protocol when the residues are
defined in contact if their C-alpha atoms have a distance
less than 8 Å.

DISCUSSION

In the last decade, the Zernike formalism has been
widely applied for the characterization of molecular surfaces [49–53].
Very recently, we developed a new representation,
based on the 2D Zernike polynomials, which allows an
extremely efficient, fast, and completely unsupervised
description of the local geometrical shape, allowing for
easy comparison between different regions of molecules.
Through this compact description, it is possible both to
analyze the similarity between 2 different regions - suggesting, for example, a similar ligand for binding regions
- and to study the complementarity between interacting
surfaces [37].
Here, we used our novel method to shed some light
on the molecular mechanisms ruling the observed antiviral action human lactoferrin exerts against SARS-CoV-2
infection [44].
In particular, we focused on the early stages of the
infection, i.e. the attachment and entry of the virus to the
host cell, when lactoferrin can interfere with the virushost interaction without the need to be internalized in
the cell. We thus tried to establish whether lactoferrin
could compete with the virus in binding to sialic acid, the
sticky end of sialoside chains, which has been suggested
to mediate the attachment of SARS-CoV-2 to the host
cell. Interestingly, comparing the binding region of sialic
acid in the MERS-CoV coronavirus with patches on the
lactoferrin surface, we found possible spots on both apo
and holo forms of Lf, which could compete in forming
low affinity but high avidity interactions.
We then proceeded to test the hypothesis of an inter-

action between lactoferrin and the primary SARS-CoV2 protein receptor, ACE2. A blind search for complementarity regions highlighted a hot-spot in a region that
in physiological conditions is oriented toward the membrane, while no significative complementarity is present
in the ACE2 region involved in the interaction with the
virus spike protein. At last, we analyzed the three membrane proteins on the virus envelope, i.e. the E, M, and S
ones. Similarly to ACE-2, both E and M presented possible interacting regions in portions of the surface, that are
buried in the virion membrane under normal conditions
(data not shown). On the other hand, the spike protein
showed two main hot spots, one in the N-terminal domain of the S1 subunit and another in the C-terminal
one. Those two regions are robust to molecular noise, as
the signal endures using different configurations sampled
from a molecular dynamics simulation and each of the
three chains of the trimer. Notably, the most complementary region is the one in the C-terminal region, the
one involved in the spike-ACE2 interaction. Thus our
finding suggests a possible competition between ACE2
and lactoferrin for the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike,
which may explain the observed antiviral action.

the mean r of the points inside it. This 2D function can be expanded on the basis of the Zernike
polynomials (see next section).

Patch definition and complementarity
evaluation

A molecular surface is represented by a set of points in
the three-dimensional space. We define a surface patch,
as the group of points that fall within a sphere of radius
Rs = 6Å, centered on one point of the surface. Once the
patch is selected,
• we fit a plane that passes through the points and
reorient the patch in such a way to have the z-axis
perpendicular to the plane and going through the
center of the plane.
• we define the angle θ as the largest angle between
the perpendicular axis and a secant connecting a
given point C on the z-axis to any point of the
patch. C is then set in order that θ = 45◦ . r is the
distance between C and a surface point.

Once a patch is represented in term of its Zernike descriptors, the similarity between that patch and another
one can be simply measured as the Euclidean distance
between the invariant vectors. The relative orientation
of the patches before the projection in the unitary circle must be considered. In fact, if we search for similar
regions we must compare patches that have the same orientation once projected in the 2D plane, i.e. the solventexposed part of the surface must be oriented in the same
direction for both patches, for example as the positive
z-axis. If instead, we want to assess the complementarity
between two patches, we must orient the patches contrariwise, i.e. one patch with the solvent-exposed part
toward the positive z-axis (‘up’) and the other toward
the negative z-axis (‘down’).

The starting structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike
trimeric complex was taken from the model structure proposed by the I-Tasser server [54]. All steps of the simulation were performed using Gromacs 2019.3 [58]. Topologies of the system were built using the CHARMM-27
force field [59]. The protein was placed in a dodecahedric
simulative box, with periodic boundary conditions, filled
with 131793 TIP3P water molecules [60]. We checked
that each atom of the trimer was at least at a distance of
1.1 nm from the box borders. The addition of 3 sodium
counterions rendered the systems electroneutral. The final system, consisting of 448572 atoms, was first minimized with 2064 steps of steepest descent. Relaxation
of water molecules and thermalization of the system in
NVT and NPT environments were run each for 0.1 ns
at 2 fs time-step. The temperature was kept constant at
300 K with v-rescale algorithm[61]; the final pressure was
fixed at 1 bar with the Parrinello-Rahman algorithm[62]
which guarantees a water density of 1004 kg/m3 , close to
the experimental value. LINCS algorithm[63] was used
to constraint h-bonds.
Finally, the systems were simulated with a 2 fs timestep for 140 ns in periodic boundary conditions, using a cut-off of 12 Å for the evaluation of short-range
non-bonded interactions and the Particle Mesh Ewald
method [64] for the long-range electrostatic interactions.
