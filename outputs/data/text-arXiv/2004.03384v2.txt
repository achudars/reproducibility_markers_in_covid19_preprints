ABSTRACT
One major bottleneck in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is the limited number of critical care beds. Due to the dynamic
development of infections and the time lag between when patients are infected and when a proportion of them enters an
intensive care unit (ICU), the need for future intensive care can easily be underestimated. To infer future ICU load from
reported infections, we suggest a simple statistical model that (1) accounts for time lags and (2) allows for making predictions
depending on different future growth of infections. We have evaluated our model for three regions, namely Berlin (Germany),
Lombardy (Italy), and Madrid (Spain). Before extensive containment measures made an impact, we first estimate the regionspecific model parameters. Whereas for Berlin, an ICU rate of 6%, a time lag of 6 days, and an average stay of 12 days in ICU
provide the best fit of the data, for Lombardy and Madrid the ICU rate was higher (18% and 15%) and the time lag (0 and 3
days) and the average stay (4 and 8 days) in ICU shorter. The region-specific models are then used to predict future ICU load
assuming either a continued exponential phase with varying growth rates (0—15%) or linear growth. Thus, the model can
help to predict a potential exceedance of ICU capacity. Although our predictions are based on small data sets and disregard
non-stationary dynamics, our model is simple, robust, and can be used in early phases of the disease when data are scarce.

Introduction
The number of reported COVID-19 cases worldwide is steadily increasing and has reached 14.5 million on July 19, 2020.1
On March 26, 2020, the U.S. became the country with the largest number of officially reported infections (83.800 people).
Until July 19, 2020, this number increased to 3.7 million people. Even though these numbers strongly depend on the number
of conducted tests, they demonstrate the huge spread and severity of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
It lies in the nature of exponential growth that it starts slowly and bears the risk that the future development is underestimated, as shown in multiple psychological studies [1]. In the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, this leads to the risk of underestimating
case fatality rates [2, 3] but also the risk that the health system might be overburdened due to a too high number of patients in
intensive care units (ICUs; [4]). Although it is well-known that a certain number of COVID-19 patients needs intensive care,
especially elderly people and people with pre-existing conditions [5], the exponential dynamics of infections along with the
time lag between the number of reported infections and the number of ICU patients can lead to the false impression that the
amount of ICU patients will be unproblematic [2, 6]. Due to the lag and ICU durations of one to several weeks, even when
the exponential growth of infections is stopped, it takes a while until the pressure on ICUs is reduced [7, 8, 9].

In this early phase of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, in which epidemiological data is non-stationary, heterogeneous, and
regionally specific, the prediction of future ICU load (as well as mortality) is a highly challenging task [10, 11]. In addition to
certain assumptions (e.g., ICU rate or length of ICU stay) that have to be estimated from data or pre-specified, the dynamics
of exponential growth are unforeseeable in times where containment measures ranging from closure of schools to home office
or curfew have been applied to alleviate exponential growth [11]. In most forecast models, however, the exponential growth is
assumed to continue with the same rate over the prediction horizon (mostly 14 days) and is fitted either to the daily incidence
of COVID-19 patients or ICU patients [4, 10, 12].
In this study, we suggest a simple and transparent statistical model that is able to account for (1) the time lag between
reported infection and ICU admission and (2) different future growth (linear or exponential). This allows us in particular to
predict the time point when the ICU load exceeds a given capacity. We address the following research questions: Can the
future number of ICU patients be predicted from the number of reported infections? And how does the growth rate influence
the time when ICU capacity is expected to be overburdened?
In our empirical examples, we apply the model to three public data sets, namely Berlin (Germany), Lombardy (Italy),
and Madrid (Spain). Given the total number of COVID-19 patients and the number of COVID-19 patients in ICUs, we first
estimate the parameters of the model (i.e., ICU rate, length of stay in ICU, and time lag between the positive testing and
the ICU admission). We restricted here the data to the time period before extensive containment measures made an impact.
And second, we predict for a time horizon of two months the number of COVID-19 patients who need intensive care when
assuming linear or exponential growth of the number of reported infections. By incorporating the dependency between the
total number of COVID-19 patients and COVID-19 patients in ICUs as well as holding growth rates flexible, our model
extends previous models relying on fitting linear or exponential growth to initial ICU case data [4, 12]. The predictions of our
model in combination with epidemiological estimates regarding disease dynamics can be used in turn to predict future ICU
load and to potentially predict when the ICU load will exceed a given capacity.

Method
In this section, we introduce the theoretical model for predicting the number of ICU patients based on the number of reported
infections. Denote PTt the total number of positively tested people until day t in a particular region. ∆PTt = PTt − PTt−1 is
then the number of newly positively tested people only on day t. A certain share αl of the newly positively tested people needs
intensive care l days later with lag l, l = 1, ..., L, and some maximum lag L denoting the maximal duration between a positive
test and ICU admission. Moreover, patients remain in intensive care for a longer time, which means that ICU admissions of
the previous days also have to be considered. In early stages of a disease the exact distribution of the lengths of ICU stays
might not be available and for simplification, the duration can be modelled as constant for all patients. We denote K the
average number of days patients remain in an ICU.
The number of ICU patients at time t can then be predicted in dependence of K and a vector αl with l = 1, . . . , L, which
contains the probabilities that positively tested persons have transited to ICU after l days, in the following way:

ct (K, αl ) =
IC

K

L

∑ ∑ αl ∆PTt−l−k+1

(1)

k=1 l=1

In case only the overall share of reported infected people needing intensive care without differentiating between the lags,
the so-called ICU rate α with α = ∑Ll=1 αl , is available, this can be used in combination with a specific average lag l ∗ . Eq. (1)
then becomes:
ct (K, α , l ∗ ) =
IC

K

∑ α ∆PTt−l∗ −k+1

(2)

k=1

Since Eq. (2) corresponds to the data situation in our empirical application, the subsequent considerations will be based
on this equation. They can, however, analogously be applied to Eq. (1).
To evaluate the performance of the models and to derive the parameters ICU rate α , the length of ICU stay K and the lag
length l ∗ that best explain the data, the squared correlation coefficient and the root mean squared prediction error (RMSE) for
ct (K, α , l ∗ ) to the observed value ICt . The RMSE is defined
each model can be calculated by comparing the predicted value IC
as
s
T

RMSE(K, α , l ∗ ) =

ICt (K, α , l ∗ ))2
∑ (ICt − c

(3)

t=1

2/12

with T denoting the number of days with observations available. The model with the lowest RMSE is supposed to fit best to
the observed data.
After the parameters K, a, and l ∗ are estimated (based on prior knowledge or data), they can be used to predict the
future development by assuming either linear growth with slope d for the number of infections, i.e., PTt+1 = PTt + d, or
exponential growth with rate r for the number of infections, i.e., PTt+1 = (1 + r)PTt , which also holds for the daily changes,
∆PTt+1 = (1 + r)∆PTt . The predicted number of ICU patients can then be compared with different levels of ICU capacities.
Moreover, dates when a given capacity is expected to be exceeded can be calculated.

Empirical applications
We now apply the above introduced theoretical model to data of the initial phase of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic for Berlin
(Germany), Lombardy (Italy), and Madrid (Spain). In a first step, we determine the parameters K, a, and l ∗ that best explain
the data in each region. We then use this model to predict the number of ICU patients for a fixed time horizon of two months
assuming further linear or exponential growth. Please note that the model is sensitive to the estimated parameters and the
underlying data. Since we are in a dynamic and non-stationary situation where the data and the development can change on a
daily basis, we also demonstrate the sensitivity of the development regarding future growth and different time periods within
the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
Data
Berlin (Germany)

Berlin is one of the 16 federal states of Germany and is densely populated with currently about 3.8 million inhabitants [13].
For each day between March 1 and April 21, we retrieved the number of reported COVID-19 patients and the number of
COVID-19 patients in ICUs for Berlin from the Berlin Senate Department for Health, Nursing and Equal Opportunities
(Figure 1, left).2 The total number of COVID-19 infections increased from one on March 1, 2020, to 5,341 on April 21, 2020.
The first patients in intensive care (three) were reported on March 16, 2020, and this number increased to 164 on April 21,
2020. Figure 1 (right) depicts the (absolute and relative) daily change in the number of reported infections over the previous
7 days since the first day more than 100 cases were reported (March 12, 2020, 118 cases). This averaging rules out weekend
effects when some numbers are reported with delay.
On March 23, 2020, extensive containment measures including school closure and contact restriction were established for
Berlin.3 To make the three regions comparable and to ensure a greater homogeneity of the data, we restrict our analysis to
the period before containment measures make an impact. For Berlin, we therefore include only data from March 1, 2020, to
March 30, 2020. The end date corresponds
to 7 days after the lockdown. The overall daily growth rate
p for this period (with
p
a minimum of 100 cases) is 19% ( 18 2,581/118 = 1.19), but it decreased to 11% in the last week ( 7 2,581/1,219 = 1.11).
Due to the containment measures, the average daily growth further decreased since then.
The deployment of ICU beds is a highly dynamic process. According to the health senator of Berlin, Dilek Kalayci, the
number of ICU beds in Berlin was 1,045 in March 2020 and has been planned to increase to 2,267 until the end of April
[14, 15].4 Based on this, we define the following capacity limits for Berlin: (1) current maximal capacity (1,045 ICU beds)
and (2) extended capacity by the end of April (2,267 ICU beds).
Lombardy (Italy)

Lombardy is one of the 20 administrative divisions of Italy and has about 10 million inhabitants.5 For each day between
February 24, 2020, and April 21, 2020, we retrieved the number of reported COVID-19 patients and the number of COVID19 patients in ICUs for Lombardy from the Presidenza del Consiglio dei Ministri – Dipartimento della Protezione Civile
(Figure 2, left).6 The total number of COVID-19 infections increased from 166 on February 24, 2020, to 33,978 on April
21, 2020. The number of ICU patients increased from 19 on February 24, 2020, to 1,381 on April 3, 2020. Since then, it
decreased to 851 on April 21, 2020. Figure 2 (right) depicts the daily (absolute and relative) change in the number of reported
infections over the previous 7 days. On March 8, 2020, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte put the whole Lombardy
under quarantine.7 Assuming that at least 7 days are needed before the quarantine makes an impact, we restrict our analysis
to data from February 24, 2020 to March 15, 2020. The overall daily growth rate for this period (with a minimum of 100

4 For 2017, the Office for Statistics of Berlin-Brandenburg reported 1,450 ICU beds [16]. However, since this number is already 4 years old, we prefer to
use the current estimates.

Madrid (Spain)

Madrid is one of the 17 autonomous communities in Spain and has about 6.6 million inhabitants.9 For each day between
February 25, 2020, and April 21, 2020, we retrieved the number of reported COVID-19 patients and the number of COVID19 patients in ICUs for Lombardy from Datadista (Figure 3, left).10 The total number of COVID-19 infections increased from
two on February 25, 2020, to 59,199 on April 21, 2020. The number of ICU patients increased from 53 on March 3, 2020, to

Results
First, we estimated the parameters of the model separately for Berlin, Lombardy, and Madrid (see Table 1). For Berlin, the
best fit was found for an ICU rate α of 6%, a time lag of 6 days, and an average stay of 12 days in ICU. For Lombardy and
Madrid, in contrast, a better fit was found for larger ICU rates (18% and 15%), shorter ICU stays (4 and 8 days), and a shorter
time lag (0 and 3 days). The RMSE for Berlin is considerably lower than for Lombardy and Madrid, which can be explained
by the lower number of ICU patients. The squared correlation coefficient lies between 0.96 and 0.98 for all three regions. In
Figure 4, we compare the reported ICU patients with the predicted ICU patients based on the estimated parameters.
Second, based on the models with the estimated parameters, we now predict the future development of (1) the number of
infections (see Figure 5) and (2) the number of ICU patients (see Figure 6). Here, we will make a simplified assumption that
the growth can be approximated as either linear or exponential. We show the sensitivity of the results for linear growth with
the slope d between 0 and 2,000 as well as exponential growth rates between 0% and 15%. A growth rate of 0% means that
from one day to another, no more new infections are reported, which is an unrealistic extreme case. The other extreme, 15%,
corresponds to a duplication of reported infections every 5 days. Please note that the daily growth rate in the last week before
the strong containment measures came into force was 10% for Berlin, 17% for Lombardy, and 54% for Madrid.
In Figure 6, the predicted number of ICU patients is additionally compared with the capacity limits introduced in the

data section. A linear growth in the number of infections leads in the long-run to a constant number of ICU patients, which
corresponds to α · d · K. This means, a share of α of the daily new infections d needs intensive care for K days. Regarding
exponential growth, our estimated parameters show that for Berlin only growth rates between 0% and 4% guarantee that the
number of patients at the end of May remains below the current maximal capacity, a rate of up to 5% guarantees to stay below
the extended capacity by the end of May (but exceeds the capacity in June). For Lombardy and Madrid, it can be seen that the
capacity was already exceeded before the containment measures came into force.
Figure 7 depicts the relation between different growth rates (0%–15%) and the dates of capacity exceedance for exemplary
capacities of 500, 1,000, 1,500, 2,000, and 2,500 for Berlin, Lombardy, and Madrid. It demonstrates how the approach can be
applied also for different phases of exponential growth or capacity extensions.

Discussion
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic deeply concerns policymakers and health personnel to take the right actions to slow down
the spreading of SARS-CoV-2. In several regions including Lombardy and Madrid, the need for ICUs surpassed the available
capacity and not all COVID-19 patients who needed intensive care could be treated [4]. To avoid a triage, several countries,
including Germany, Italy, and Spain, decided to apply containment measures – ranging from temporary closures of schools
and kindergartens to travel restrictions, compulsory mask wearing, and curfew. Those measures, however, disrupt economic
activity and lead to the risk of a recession. Thus, policymakers are confronted with the difficulty of making decisions that
severely affect the healthcare system, the global economy as well as the everyday life of many individuals while facing a
large amount of uncertainty within the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (e.g., the time until new treatments or vaccinations have been
developed). Since one major bottleneck for the healthcare system is the ICU capacity, risk models are needed that allow
policymakers to estimate the future ICU load to take appropriate measures.
So far, most forecast models for ICU load fit exponential growth (e.g., using ordinary least-squares in the log-space) to
either the cumulated number of positive COVID-19 patients or directly to the number of ICU patients [4, 10, 12]. For different
regions in the UK, [10] used a Monte Carlo simulation to predict regional ICU capacities. Those models, however, assume
that the initial exponential growth will hold over the forecast horizon (usually 14 days) and do not account for the alleviation
of growth rates, e.g., due to containment measures. Moreover, these models do not exploit the underlying relationship between
reported infections and ICU admissions, e.g., in terms of ICU rate. Here, we provide a simple, comprehensible, and transparent
model that allows for predicting ICU load assuming linear or different exponential growth of the number of infections.
We evaluated this model for Berlin, Lombardy, and Madrid, where we had access to the number of reported COVID-19
infections and ICU patients with COVID-19. Based on data before extensive containment measures made an impact, we first
estimated the parameters ICU rate, average stay in ICU, and time lag. For Berlin, an ICU rate of 6% was estimated which is
close to an estimate of 5% in [17] and expectations of intensive care physicians in Berlin [18]. [19] also report an ICU rate
of 5% based on data for 72,312 cases in China. For Lombardy and Madrid, in contrast, a much higher ICU rate of 18% and
15%, respectively, resulted in the best model fit. This is in relative accordance with [4] who reported an ICU rate of 16% for
Lombardy in the first two weeks of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Please note here that the ICU rate does not only depend on
age, but also on the total number of tests because more testing will lead to a higher number of mild cases and thus a lower ICU
rate [11]. Thus, the higher ICU rates found for Lombardy and Madrid might also reflect a more restrictive testing scenario
in those areas [20, 21]. In similar models, relying only on exponential growth of intensive care patients, ICU rates of 9–11%
have been assumed [12].
Regarding the average stay in ICU (until recovery or death), the best model fit resulted in 12 days for Berlin, 4 days for
Lombardy, and 8 days for Madrid. Based on data from China, other forecast models assumed an average stay of 8 to 10 days
[10, 11]. For Lombardy, however, a median length of ICU stay of 9 days has been reported for the early phase [22]. Also for
other regions in Italy and USA, longer ICU stays (about 15 days for ICU patients who remain alive and about 10–12 days for
patients who die after ICU treatment) have been found [7, 9]. In New York, COVID-19 patients typically need ICU care with
ventilation for 11 to 21 days, some patients stay in ICU for 30 days [8].
The time lag between positive testing and ICU admission was estimated to be 6 for Berlin, 0 for Lombardy, and 3 for
Madrid. The time lag is known to be highly variable because COVID-19 patients may be tested at different time points due to
different disease courses as well as regulatory and organizational issues (e.g., capacity of test units or eligibility to get a test).
Thus, the low numbers for Lombardy and Madrid can be explained by the limited testing capacity in those regions, where tests
are mainly administered for patients with severe COVID-19 symptoms [20, 21]. Please note that the time lag does not reflect
the time between the actual infection and ICU admission.
We then used the models with the estimated parameters to predict the number of ICU patients for a fixed time horizon of
two months. By assuming linear or exponential growth of different levels and different ICU capacities, we evaluated different
scenarios and show the sensitivity towards the growth rate in the exponential phase of COVID-19. The further the expected
dates of a capacity exceedance can be shifted into the future, the higher the likelihood that new treatments or a vaccination

are available or that a larger share of the population has become immune against COVID-19, which would further lower the
growth rate. Please note that our results only hold true in the early phase of the disease and need to be adapted in later phases
when the growth deviates from exponential.
To account for the dynamic situation of the deployment of ICU beds, we compare the predicted number of ICU patients
to different estimates of ICU capacity (if available). For simplicity, we assumed that all those beds are available for only
COVID-19 patients and thus did not account for different utilization rates which might lead to an earlier capacity exceedance
in practice. Additionally, we did not account for shortage in highly-qualified medical personnel. Already prior to the COVID19 associated increase in capacities, it had been a common phenomenon that ICU beds were unused for lack of qualified
personnel. Please note that we here also did not differentiate between high and low care ICUs (i.e., with and without invasive
ventilator) since we only had numbers on the total number of ICU patients with COVID-19. Future studies might also try
to account for changing treatment strategies of COVID-19 patients. Guidelines have emerged [23], but are likely subject to
change. Early reports on the outbreak emphasized the potential progression of COVID-19 pneumonia to acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS) [24], biasing towards early intubation and ventilation. However, a growing number of studies
shows that a subgroup of patients seems to be clinically stable despite very low blood oxygenation levels and may benefit
more from non-invasive oxygen supply and ventilation methods than early intubation [25]. Accumulating experience with
COVID-19 patients will therefore result in shifting treatment strategies that can either increase or ease the strain on ICU
capacities.
By testing the proposed model for three regions, we show that this approach is generally generalizable to data of other
cities, states, or whole countries as long as the overall numbers of reported COVID-19 patients and the ICU capacities are
available. When data on ICU patients with COVID-19 are additionally available, it can further be evaluated if our parameter
estimates also hold true for other regions. An informative repository in Germany is the DIVI registry, in which most hospitals
in Germany provide numbers of the current ICU load and capacity.13
Although our predictions are based on a small data set, and involve unclear dynamics and a number of assumptions, we
introduced here a simple statistical model that (1) produces reasonable estimates for ICU rate, length of ICU stay, and time lag
and (2) accounts for different exponential growth rates as well as linear growth with different slopes. Our analyses for Berlin,
Lombardy, and Madrid demonstrate that a continued exponential growth rate led or would have led to an exceedance of the
ICU capacity in the near future. The predicted capacity exceedance is also in line with other forecast models for the UK or the
USA [10, 26]. Due to the containment measures in Berlin, Lombardy, and Madrid (e.g., closure of schools, travel restrictions,
and curfew), the growth rate, however, has strongly decreased since then so that lower growth rates or linear growth seem to
be most realistic. Since our proposed model is quite generic, we hope that this study will help others to estimate the future
need of intensive care in addition to sophisticated epidemiological approaches such as compartment or transmission models
[11, 27, 28]. However, as already pointed out by others [e.g., 10], any forecast models in these early times of the current SARSCoV-2 pandemic needs to be taken with caution and assumptions need to be updated when further data become available. In
particular, future studies might model the number of administered tests as a confounding variable.
