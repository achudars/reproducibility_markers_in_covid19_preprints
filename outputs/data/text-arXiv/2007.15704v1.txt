Abstract
The employment status of billions of people has been affected by the COVID epidemic around
the Globe. New evidence is needed on how to mitigate the job market crisis, but there exists
only a handful of studies mostly focusing on developed countries. We fill in this gap in the
literature by using novel data from Ukraine, a transition country in Eastern Europe, which
enacted strict quarantine policies early on. We model four binary outcomes to identify
respondents (i) who are not working during quarantine, (ii) those who are more likely to work
from home, (iii) respondents who are afraid of losing a job, and, finally, (iv) survey participants
who have savings for 1 month or less if quarantine is further extended. Our findings suggest
that respondents employed in public administration, programming and IT, as well as highly
qualified specialists, were more likely to secure their jobs during the quarantine. Females,
better educated respondents, and those who lived in Kyiv were more likely to work remotely.
Working in the public sector also made people more confident about their future employment
perspectives. Although our findings are limited to urban households only, they provide
important early evidence on the correlates of job market outcomes, expectations, and financial
security, indicating potential deterioration of socio-economic inequalities.

1 Introduction
No country has escaped the pandemic crisis of COVID-19. According to the estimations of the
World Bank, the epidemic is pushing from 40 to 60 million people globally into extreme
poverty (Mahler et al., 2020). In light of this crisis, there is a salient demand for robust data on
the economic activities of individuals and households. These data are essential for two reasons.
First, household expectations are one of the key factors that influence the economy (Baldwin
and Mauro, 2020). Second, household-level analysis is particularly important for planning
social policies aimed to protect vulnerable groups, reduce inequalities, and ensure the wellbeing of citizens (Deaton, 2005).
At the same time, such data about households during the COVID-19 crisis are lacking.
Currently, most of the recent studies (including working papers) primarily focus on macroeconomic consequences of the COVID-19 crisis (e.g., Barro, Ursua and Weng, 2020;
Eichenbaum, Rebelo and Trabandt, 2020; Fernandes, 2020). Those rare ongoing studies about
households’ consumption and expectations have covered primarily the US (Baker et al., 2020;
Coibion, Godonichenko and Weber, 2020) and OECD countries (Ambrocio, 2020; Rothwell
and Van Drie, 2020) omitting other parts of the world. Our goal is to close this gap and shed
light on how households respond to the COVID-19 crisis in a transition country. We present
new data about Ukraine in order to address this gap and contribute to the fast-growing literature
on the COVID-19 and household economies.
In this paper, we focus our attention on the job market effects of the epidemic on urban
households in Ukraine. We model which respondents are likely to lose jobs; to work from home
due to the COVID-19; to fear losing a job; to have savings for less than one month if the
quarantine continues. Our data allow us to include a vast array of socio-demographic and
socio-economic factors describing respondents and household status. We control for gender,
age, marital status, children, education, financial status, industry, and occupation. We observe
that the crisis hit harder more vulnerable and less resourceful Ukrainians. These findings
indicate that the crisis is likely to exacerbate socio-economic inequalities: wealthier and better
educated Ukrainians in large cities are more likely to secure their jobs, whereas vulnerable
Ukrainians are likely to be pushed back even further.

2 Ukrainian context
2.1. Economic background
Ukraine is a transition country in Eastern Europe, which starting from 1991, has witnessed a
major shift from the planned economy of the authoritarian Soviet regime to the market
economy and democratic institutions. Considering the region, Ukraine has been regarded as
one of the least successful transition countries in terms of GDP and wages (Braithwaite,
Grootaert and Milanovic, 2016; Guriev, 2018). The GDP of Ukraine collapsed by half from
1990 to 1994 with a slow decline between 1994 and 2000 (Sutela, 2012). On average, transition
countries increased per capita incomes by around 50% of what they were in 1989, whereas
Ukraine did not achieve such outcomes (Guriev, 2018). Moreover, while in other transition
countries, at least some income groups managed to achieve salaries similar to the G7 countries,
in Ukraine this has not been the case. The situation has somewhat improved between 2001 and
2008 but mostly due to better terms of trade (higher prices of major exports such as metals and
lower prices of Russian gas) rather than reforms.
Ukrainian economic system has been often described as oligarchic and rent-seeking
(Gorodnichenko and Grygorenko, 2008). Such an institutional environment has long prevented

2

Ukraine from stable economic growth. Researchers often explain slow Ukrainian development
as the result of the weak rule of law, closed ties between political power and economic elites,
and corruption (Guriev, 2018; Milanovic, 1998; Restrepo et al., 2015; Sutela, 2012; World
Bank, 2019). At the same time, the population decline from 1989 till the early 2000s was more
salient in Ukraine than in neighboring countries. Ayhan, Gatskova and Lehmann (2020) point
out that Ukraine lost about nine million people from 1991 to 2016. They attribute this loss to
lower fertility rates, high mortality, and out-migration.
In terms of economic expectations and attitudes, Ukrainians tend to have gloomy views
about their economy. For instance, they tend to significantly overestimate the rates of economic
inequality in the country (Gimpelson and Treisman, 2018) and be quite skeptical of market
reforms. In 1992, in the wake of independence, 64% of Ukrainians said that they shared rather
positive attitudes towards land privatization. In 2018, 25 years after, only 20% thought the
same (Brik and Shestakovskyi, 2020). Researchers explain this phenomenon with a difficult
transition period, weak governmental institutions, poor local governance (lack of
decentralization), and underdeveloped local economic activities (lack of participatory budgets,
lack of land market reforms, the strong influence of clientelism).
Since 2014 the Ukrainian economy has been further damaged by the annexation of
Crimea and the hybrid war with Russia. Losing parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions that
specialized in mining industries were particularly harmful to the economy. This industry
accounted for 25% of total exports and 15% of the total GDP of Ukraine (Havlik 2014). The
destruction of physical capital, mass migration, and market disintegration after the war
contributed to the diminishing of Ukrainian GDP (Coupe and Obrizan, 2016). Some previous
studies of the individual-level Labor Force Survey during 2004-2013 showed evidence of “job
polarization in Ukraine, with relative increase employment of managers, professionals,
services and sales jobs, and elementary occupations, and with a significant decline in skilled
manual occupations, clerks and technicians” (Kupets, 2016 p. 25). The authors concluded that
Ukraine has a significant mismatch between education and labor markets and that almost 40%
of employed respondents were overeducated. According to the Ptoukha Institute for
Demography (2019), the percentage of people who live below the subsistence level (i.e.,
absolute poverty) was 43,2% in 2018. According to the same data, children below 17 and
retired people (especially women) were most vulnerable to poverty. Considering the household
structure, the most vulnerable to poverty was the household with three and more children and
those households with at least one unemployed.
2.2 COVID-19 in Ukraine
According to the OECD report (2020), there are about 57 thousand confirmed cases in Ukraine
by July 2020. Among them, 1,456 resulted in death, and 29,769 were recovered. These are
moderately low numbers given the size of the Ukrainian population.2 Although the government
was relatively slow with testing, coronavirus containment policies were implemented quite
rapidly, with just a few confirmed cases and not a single death. A three-week nationwide
quarantine was initially imposed on March 12th, 2020, which shut down all educational
institutions moving classes online.3 Non-citizens were banned from entering the country on
March 13th, and all national and international air and rail travel was banned on March 17th. A
mandatory hospital observation or self-isolation for 14 days was required for everyone entering

Ukraine ranks 87th in terms of total cases per 1 million people and 78 th in terms of deaths per 1 million people:

Ukraine.4 Wearing masks or respirators in public places became obligatory with considerable
fines for violation in the range from 17,000 to 34,000 UAH, which was about 700-1,500 USD.5
These bans were relaxed only in mid-June.
Some early surveys showed that urban Ukrainians varied in compliance with
quarantine. For example, a survey conducted on March 15th (Liga, 2020) showed that women
tend to wash their hands more often than men (91% vs. 78%), and they are also more likely to
use sanitizers (57% vs. 41%). Furthermore, most Ukrainians thought that their chances of
getting infected with COVID-19 were not very high (mean value of 4.5 out of 10). The same
survey showed that 80% of employed urban Ukrainians were eager to continue going to their
workplaces despite the threat of the virus. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no
systematic attempt to investigate household economic expectations and job prospects in
Ukraine during the COVID-19 pandemic. In what follows, we present our statistical analyses
of a unique dataset to address this question.
3 Data
3.1 Gradus survey
We use the survey conducted by the Ukrainian research firm Gradus, which developed a
smartphone application to recruit respondents and circulate questionnaires. Initially, all
respondents were recruited from the general population of urban Ukrainians using a variety of
methods, including probability-based sampling, face to face and phone interviews, distribution
of promo codes, online social media advertising. The panel excludes those who live in the
conflict zones in Ukraine’s east as well as the Crimean Peninsula that are currently outside its
government’s control. Gradus applies weights based on gender, age, size of the settlement, and
macro-regions to make the panel equivalent to the Ukrainian urban adult population under age
60. Hence, the trends discussed below may not generalize to citizens who are older or located
in rural areas. Respondents receive questionnaires on different subjects approximately every
week. Respondents receive questionnaires on different subjects approximately every week.
We used the survey conducted on April 8th, which asked about the Orthodox Easter
celebration, compliance with the stay-at-home policies, and employment changes due to the
COVID-19. The survey lasted less than 24 hours, and 1,176 respondents out of 2,177 listed in
the Gradus panel have responded (implying the response rate of 54%).
The main caveat of the data is the exclusion of rural territories, which clearly limits our
understanding of labor markets in the countryside and smaller cities with a population of less
than 50 thousand. Nevertheless, urban Ukraine is quite diverse geographically and in terms of
skills and industries (Kupets, 2016; Ayhan, Gatskova and Lehmann, 2020). We focus our
attention on those variables that can explain the change in the employment status in urban
Ukraine and provide our insights for the respective policies. Our study can be extended once
rural areas are added, but we suspect that economic activities in cities are more affected by
quarantine given higher population density.
3.2 Variables
We constructed four dependent variables related to the job market effects on the household
well-being:

“Not working” – equal to 1 for respondents who answered that there is no work for them
and they are fired, on paid or unpaid leave (and 0 otherwise)
“Working from home” – equal to 1 for those who work from home part or full time (and 0
otherwise)
“Fears to lose a job” – equal to 1 for respondents who are afraid to lose a job (and 0
otherwise)
“Savings for <1 month” – for respondents who have enough financial resources for one
month or less (and 0 otherwise)
The first two variables are only asked of respondents who worked before quarantine, while
the last two are asked of all respondents. However, for the dependent variable “Fears to lose
job” we only include respondents who actually had a job before the quarantine.
For each of the dependent variables we have estimated the following linear probability
model with robust standard errors clustered at the city level
𝐷𝑉𝑖 = 𝛼0 + 𝑆𝐷 ∙ 𝛼𝑆𝐷 ′ + 𝑅𝐶 ∙ 𝛼𝑅𝐻 ′ + 𝐹𝑆 ∙ 𝛼𝐹𝑆 ′ + 𝐼𝑁 ∙ 𝛼𝐼𝑁 ′ + 𝑂𝐶 ∙ 𝛼𝑂𝐶 ′ + 𝜀𝑖 ,

(1)

where 𝜀𝑖 is the individual error term for respondent i.
In these models we include a rich set of socio-demographic factors (SD), regional
characteristics (RC), measures of financial status (FS), and indicators for industry (IN) and
occupation (OC).
Specifically, socio-demographic factors (SD) control for the female gender, three age
groups of 25-34, 35-44 and 45+ years old (with a base age group of 18-24 years old), indicators
for married and never married, an indicator if there are children in the household, indicators
for 2, 3 or 4+ members in the household, dummies for post-secondary and higher education,
an indicator whether respondent knows the number of COVID cases within +/-10% of the
actual number on the data and a dummy whether a respondent believes in God.
Regional characteristics (RC) include dummies for four regions of Ukraine and Kyiv (with
the central region being the base), an indicator for living in a city with 100 thousand to 1 million
inhabitants, and another one for living in a city with more than 1 million people (with cities
smaller than 100 thousand people serving as a base). We account for financial status (FS) using
indicators for owning a place to live, owning a car, and an indicator for not working before the
quarantine (included in the last model for having enough savings for 1 month or less). There
are also two indicators for self-assessed financial status: “Middle” if a household can afford
food and clothes but not larger home appliances like a fridge, and “Wealthy” if a household
can buy more expensive stuff (with those who cannot afford a mobile phone, clothes or even
food being in a base category). A great advantage of our dataset is that we also have indicators
for the industry or the sector of economic activity (IN) and occupation (OC) with descriptive
statistics provided in Appendix Table 3.
4 Results
4.1 Descriptive Statistics
The descriptive statistics for the respondents are provided in Table 1. In the sample, 62% of
respondents were working full time, 12% were working part-time, and 26% were unemployed.
In total, 24.8% of respondents were not working because of being fired or taking paid or unpaid
leave. A considerable fraction of respondents (40.4%) worked from home part or full time.
24.6% of respondents were afraid to lose jobs, including those who did not work before the

5

quarantine. However, in our preferred sub-sample of 874 respondents who had jobs before
COVID-19, there were 259 (or 29.6%) of such respondents. The most striking observation is
that 56% of respondents did not have savings for more than 1 month if quarantine were to be
continued.

Note: Authors’ calculations based on the Gradus survey.

In our sample, there were 59.9% of females, 35.5% of respondents in the 25-34 age
group, 29.2% were in the 35-44 age group, and 19.7% were age 45+ (with the remaining group
being in the 18-24 age category). 64.6% were married, while 25.5% had never been married,
and 48.9% of households had children. 27.1% of households had 2 members, 31.3% had 3
members, while 32.9% had 4 or more members with the remaining share being single-member
households in a base category. 9.1% and 72.5% reported having post-secondary and higher
education correspondingly. The high share of people with higher education can be partially
explained by the sample composition and partially by a lower quality of education and a large
6

number of “diploma mills” in Ukraine (Obrizan 2019). Only 23.4% of respondents knew the
number of reported COVID cases on the date of interview in the world within +/-10%.
24.1% of respondents lived in Kyiv, while 11.5% to 16.4% of participants lived in other
regions. 41.8% lived in cities with a population from 100 thousand to 1 million, and 44.8%
lived in cities with more than 1 million inhabitants. 69.6% owned their place of living and
42.7% had a car. 29.9% and 36.2% reported being in the “Middle” and “Wealthy” self-rated
financial states, and 25.7% did not work before the quarantine.
4.2 Regression results
We estimated linear probability models (LPMs) for our four dependent variables related to the
job market and financial prospects of urban Ukrainian households. Despite certain limitations,
like the possibility of obtaining predicted probabilities outside of 0 to 1 range, LPM has a clear
advantage of the ease of interpretation of the marginal effect. We have re-run all the models
using logit and obtained similar results (available upon request) in terms of main significant
factors. Table 2 reports the estimated LPM models. The model fit is good overall given a binary
nature of the dependent variables. Adjusted R-squared ranges from the minimum of 3.6% for
the dependent variable “Fears to lose job” (which is probably not surprising given that fears
are often irrational) to 21.7% in the variable “Working from home”.
For each dependent variable, let us briefly discuss the key correlates, which are significant
at 5%. Model (I) reports that respondents age 25-34 were more likely to be not working by
9.6% points (significant at 5%). Similarly, households with 2 or more members were 11.9% to
17.7% more likely not to work after the beginning of the quarantine compared to singlemember households, perhaps, because of cross-insurance available in bigger households.
Respondents in certain economic sectors were more likely to remain employed even during the
quarantine: by 18.3% points (significant at 5%) in Public administration, by 23.8% points
(significant at 1%) in Research, and by 21.6% points in Programming and IT (significant at
1%). Similarly, for certain occupations, employment prospects remain bright even during the
epidemic crisis. Highly qualified specialists such as physicians, lawyers and similar are less
likely to lose a job by 15.4% while middle and department managers’ chances to stay employed
are higher by 20.2% and 15.8% points (all coefficients significant at 5%). The probability of
staying employed during the quarantine for military and police personnel is higher by 35.9%
points compared to the base category of other occupations.
Model (II) reports that working from home part or full time was less likely by 10.6-14.1%
points (significant at 5%) for multi-person households compared to single-person households,
perhaps, because of more limited working space. On the other hand, females were more likely
to work remotely by 12.7% points while better-educated respondents with post-secondary and
higher education had chances of working from home higher by 13.8% points (significant at
5%) and 11.8% points (significant at 1%) correspondingly. Living in the capital city of Kyiv
was associated with 20.4% points higher probability of remote work compared to the central
region with no statistically significant effect for all other regions. Respondents in the sectors
of Research and Education were more likely to work from home by 22.3% and 32.7% points
correspondingly (both significant at 1%). Finally, highly qualified specialists had 25.6% points
(significant at 1%) higher chances of working remotely while middle managers and department
managers had chances higher by 33.6% points (significant at 1%) and 15.5% points (significant
at 5%), respectively.
“Fears to lose job” model in column (III) is characterized by the lowest goodness-of-fit
measure, probably, because fears could be irrational and hard to model based on observable
characteristics. Multi-member households are once again very different from a single-member
household. Respondents in such households were 14.9-20.5% points more likely to be afraid

7

of losing jobs, perhaps, because of the feeling of responsibility for the other cohabitants and
the need for cross-insurance within the family. Interestingly enough, households with children
were not different in statistical sense from households without children. Employees in
government-related sectors of Public administration, Health care, and Education were less
likely to fear job loss by 26.9%, 20.3%, and 26.7% points compared to other sectors. Unlike
the previous two models, middle managers felt more insecure and reported a 26.0% higher
probability of fear of losing a job.
Finally, we identified the correlates of higher financial insecurity of families with savings
sufficient for 1 month or less in Model (IV) for the same sample as in the previous three models
for comparison. Besides, we report Model (V) for an extended sample, including all
respondents, even those who did not work before COVID-19 but excluding job-related
questions. Surprisingly enough, this is the only model with no effect of the household size,
which deserves additional investigation given that multi-member households spend less per
person compared to a single-member household (Deaton and Paxson 1998). Interestingly
enough, knowledge of the actual number of COVID cases in the world was associated with
7.1-9.9% points lower probability of having savings for 1 month or less. Respondents who
were more closely following the news about the seriousness of the epidemics could plausibly
make additional savings. Unlike previous models, significant differences exist in Model (V) at
the regional level – living in the East and South were associated with 10.8% and 6.9% points
higher probability of having limited savings compared to the central region (both significant at
5%). Another striking result is that working before the quarantine was not associated with
increased financial security in a statistical sense. A phenomenon of “the working poor” is
especially pronounced in transition countries like Ukraine, where the monthly minimum wage
is below 200 USD.6

5 Discussion and conclusions
In this paper, we report the evidence on job market outcomes and expectations of urban
Ukrainian households four weeks after the beginning of the quarantine. Using the unique
dataset which is nationally representative of the urban adult population in Ukraine, we provide
important insights into the effects of the COVID imposed job restrictions on employment and
well-being.
Our findings indicate potential concerns for the well-being of urban Ukrainians. The
crisis is likely to exacerbate socio-economic inequalities: better educated respondents and those
living in Kyiv are more likely to secure work from home. In terms of policy suggestions, the
government of Ukraine should pay more attention to the labor market in regions and provide
social support to lower-skilled social groups.
Some important socio-demographic differences also exist. Women, who typically take
care of household tasks, are also likely to combine these tasks with the role of a breadwinner
by working from home. The analyses also show the role played by the household size –
respondents from bigger households are less likely to secure their jobs during the quarantine
and to work from home and also are more likely to be afraid of the job loss.
Another set of findings may be unique to a transition country like Ukraine. For example,
better educated respondents are not protected from job loss or financial insecurity, which is
also not improved if a respondent was employed before the quarantine. These findings may
indicate low quality of education and a phenomenon of a “working poor” still characterizing
Ukraine.
While we do realize that our results do not have causal interpretation, they still identify
key correlates of the short-term job market outcomes as well as expectations regarding the new
quarantine reality.
