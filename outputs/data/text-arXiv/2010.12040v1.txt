Abstract: The global crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, in conjunction with the economic
consequences and the collapse of health systems, has raised serious concerns in Europe, which is
the most affected continent by the pandemic since it recorded 2,388,694 cases and 190,091 deaths
(39.6% of the worldwide total), of which 71.7% (136,238) are in the United Kingdom (43,414), Italy
(34,708), France (29,778), and Spain (28,338). Unlike other countries, Greece, with about 310
confirmed cases and 18 deaths per million, is one bright exception in the study and analysis of this
phenomenon. Focusing on the peculiarities of the disease spreading in Greece, both in
epidemiological and in implementation terms, this paper applies an exploratory analysis of COVID19 temporal spread in Greece and proposes a methodological approach for the modeling and
prediction of the disease based on the Regression Splines algorithm and the change rate of the total
infections. Also, it proposes a hybrid spline regression and complex network model of social
distance measures evaluating and interpreting the spread of the disease. The overall approach
contributes to decision making and support of the public health system and to the fight against the
pandemic.

1. Introduction
The SARS-CoV-2, which causes the COVID-19 disease, is responsible for the
evolving coronavirus pandemic of the period 2019-20, causing a state of emergency
of the public health system (Ahmed et al., 2020). The pandemic cannot be prevented
from transmission between persons since no vaccine currently exists and thus it
inevitably infects millions of people around the world. In particular, more than 9.9
million people have been reported to be infected by the new coronavirus worldwide,
and nearly 497,000 have died so far (Roser and Ritchie, 2020; source:
https://www.worldometers.info/, accessed: 30/6/20). Since the emergence of the
disease in China, in December 2019, more than 215 countries and regions have
reported infected cases (Roser and Ritchie, 2020). The COVID-19 has a single-strand

2 of 17
positive RNA genome of positive polarity. Like most RNA viruses, SARS-CoV-2
shows strong variability in its genetic material and a tendency to mutate. It is the
seventh coronavirus along with the SARS-CoV (SARS disease), MERS-CoV (MERS
disease), HKU1, NL63, OC43, and the 229E, which can infect humans (Lescure et al.,
2020). Exposure to SARS-CoV and MERS coronaviruses can induce immunity for
about 2 (maybe 3 in the case of MERS) years, which then resolves. Typically, SARSCoV-2 is believed to cause immunity for approximately 1 year (similarly to the
seasonal coronaviruses), although questions about the duration of immunity for the
asymptomatic patients or for patients with mild symptoms have not been answered
yet (Ahmed et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020).
The COVID-19 pandemic is considered to be zoonotic and is closely related to
(79.5%) the original SARS-CoV (Ahmed et al., 2020). Genetic analysis has revealed
that it is related to the genus Betacoronavirus, in the B series of the Sarbecovirus
subgenus, along with two components derived from the bat (Lescure et al., 2020; Xu
et al., 2020). Its genome is 96% identical to other coronavirus samples (BatCov
RaTG13), while Chinese researchers have found that it differs only to one aminoacid in genome sequences between viruses found in the anteater Pagolins and those
derived from humans (Lam et al., 2020), implying that Pagolins may have been an
intermediate host.
The virus is transmitted from person to person through respiratory droplets
produced during coughing. The day of exposure to the onset of symptoms
(incubation time) varies from 2 to 14 days, but it usually refers to 5 days (Fang et al.,
2020; Heymann and Shindo, 2020). Patients infected by the virus may be
asymptomatic or have symptoms similar to the common cold (i.e. fever), cough, and
dyspnea. A key factor of SARS-CoV-2 high transmissibility is the high levels of
multiplication of this virus in the upper respiratory region, even before the
symptoms appear (Ahmed et al., 2020; Fang et al., 2020). The virus is also transmitted
by touching a surface or an object, where the virus is located, and then eyes, nose, or
mouth are touched (Bai et al., 2020; Heymann and Shindo, 2020).
Samples taken for molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 are mainly either oral
pharyngeal or nasopharyngeal coating, or pharyngeal washing from the upper
respiratory region, or bronchial excretes from the lower respiratory region. Clinical
samples taken from the lower respiratory region are preferable in terms of their
diagnostic value than those from the upper respiratory region (Bai et al., 2020). The
sample is taken by using a special stick (plastic stick with a dacron top) in the case
of coating sampling or by a sterile bottle in all other cases. After the samples are
received by the laboratory, the viral RNA isolation procedure follows, where the
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction is applied to amplify 2 different
targets of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome. The test is completed within 3 to 4 hours
of receiving the samples from the laboratory (La Marca et al., 2020).
A negative result for SARS-CoV-2 implies that the virus is not detected in the
sample. Except from the uninfected individuals, a negative result can also occur in
asymptomatic carriers running the incubation phase. The molecular method

3 of 17
outperforms all other methods because is able to detect the virus in the very early
stages of the infection, but it cannot definitely (100%) detect the virus in the
incubation phase (Corman et al., 2020). Also, it is very important in receiving the
coatings to have enough collected material available. In general, the nasopharyngeal
coating is better than the oropharyngeal one, since the collected material is usually
more in quantity and is unaffected by the recipient or the patient. In symptomatic
patients the sensitivity and specificity of the method is over 99% (Rosado et al., 2020).
There is currently no certified vaccine (although the production process is
pending) or effective treatments for COVID-19 and therefore all efforts are restricted
to symptom management and to supportive measures, such as providing oxygen,
monitoring of vital organ function, and providing intravenous fluids, where needed
(Ahmed et al., 2020). However, more than 70 drug substances and their
combinations are already under clinical research and their results will be gradually
known (Beigel et al., 2020). The most significant developments up to date concern
the intravenous antiviral remedisivir, which is broad-spectrum and inhibits the
proliferation of viruses that have RNA genetic material, such as the coronavirus.
Also, chloroquine phosphate appeared able to reduce the duration of infection and
the days of viremia and it improved the lung function and the outcome of
pneumonia relatively to placeboes, in a sample of patients (Gao et al., 2020).
Due to the lack of vaccine and antiviral drugs so far, the most effective way to
fight the disease is still, from the side of the society, the implementation of social
distancing measures, the collective activation, and the individual and social
responsibility of each citizen, while, from the side of the scientific research, the
development of appropriate methods for further understanding and detection of the
disease, as well as the improvement of health resources management (Tsiotas and
Magafas, 2020).
It should be noted that the study of the pandemic exclusively by epidemiological
methods creates serious concerns about the quality of research and its expected
results. This is because an epidemiological model uses the microscopic description
(i.e. builds on the information provided by an infected person) to predict the
macroscopic behavior of the disease spreading across the population (Demertzis et
al., 2020). Quantitative predictions of epidemiological methods also involve
uncertainty, as the models are usually theoretical with many simplifications and
assumptions, where many parameter values can only be estimated and not
accurately measured (Schlickeiser and Schlickeiser, 2020). Another serious
drawback in epidemiological research is that the available data are usually
insufficient due to the lack of information on the range of values in some parameters,
while experiments on infectious diseases in human populations are either
impossible or immoral to implement. The lack of reliable information and the
impossibility of applying repetitive experiments necessitate the use of mathematical
modeling in the study and prediction of the COVID-19 spread.
Within this context, the interpretation, modeling, analysis, and prediction of the
temporal spread of the disease is extremely important, not only from an

4 of 17
epidemiological point of view, but mainly from a mathematical modeling
perspective. Also, it is very important to develop models analyzing the
epidemiological phenomena of the disease, in order to predict future conditions and
especially the variation of the spread curve of the disease and its time horizon of
normalization. Within this context, this paper applies an exploratory analysis of
COVID-19 temporal spread in Greece and proposes a methodological approach for
the modeling and prediction of the disease based on the Regression Splines
algorithm and the change rate of the total infections. Also, it proposes a hybrid
complex network model of social distancing measures evaluating and interpreting
the spread of the disease. The overall approach contributes to decision making and
support of the public health system and to the fight against the pandemic. The
remainder of this paper is organized as follows; Section 2 reviews the history of
COVID-19 in Greece, Section 3 reviews the current methods for modeling and
predicting the temporal spread of the disease, Section 4 presents the methodology
and data, Section 5 applies the proposed methodology on the dataset of Greek
COVID-19 infection curve, and Sections 6 and 7 are the discussion and conclusions
sections.

2. Flattening of the Curve
The infection mechanism of COVID-19 between individuals is already known
almost from the first days of the emergence of the pandemic (Ahmed et al., 2020; Bai
et al., 2020; Heymann et al., 2020). On the contrary, the social spreading of COVID19 within a population is a quite complex procedure and therefore it is very difficult
to understand its dynamics without employing mathematical modeling and
complexity methods. Although their default limitations, mathematical models are
very effective in epidemiology because the can go beyond normality or randomness
and describe more complicate structures (Tsiotas and Magafas, 2020). Usually, the
evolution of the pandemic can be shown in a 2D diagram, where the x-axis
represents time (usually days) and the y-axis represents either the additive or the
cumulative infections data. As it shown in Fig.1, the initial increase of the COVID19 infection curve appears to be exponential, since an abrupt increase is recorded on
10 Mar and afterwards.

https://www.worldometers.info/, accessed: 30/6/20)

According to Fig.1, the temporal spread of the Greek COVID-19 illustrates a
stochastic system with possibly some linear correlations of short duration.
Generally, the epidemiologic aim for the spread of a disease is shorten the height of
and to lengthen the width of the curve (i.e. the increase of cases to be smooth and
not abrupt), while an important forecasting issue is to estimate the peak of the
spreading, where the decline stage (flattening of the curve) then begins (Schuttler et
al., 2020).
The flattening of the infection curve is crucial for how effectively a national
health system will respond and therefore how many lives will eventually be saved.
Specifically, the transmission rate of the infection and the consequent increase of the
infections will determine the mortality rate of COVID-19 (Schlickeiser and
Schlickeiser, 2020). A high slope of the epidemic curve may imply a deficiency either
in intensive care unit (ICU) beds, or in medical or nursing staff, or in medical
equipment and supplies (e.g. respirators, etc.). Accordingly, the flatter the epidemic
curve over time is, the fewer people will need hospitalization at any given time
(Demertzis et al., 2020). Within this context, mathematical modeling of the disease
spread and particularly the forecasting methods of the evolution of the epidemic
curve and of its flattening are a constant demand of research for the academic
community, while remarkable findings have already been recorded offering an
important inventory for the fight against the disease.

3. Related Work
A typical example of a method estimating the duration of infection and the
expected number of infections is presented in the work of Barmparis and Tsironis
(2020). This paper studies the infection curves from eight countries with reference to
the outbreak of disease in China, aiming to estimate the evolution of the infection,
the expected number of daily infections per country, and (perhaps the most

6 of 17
important) the duration of the epidemic in each of these countries. The analysis
showed that Italy, Spain, and the Netherlands have already passed the peak-point
of the disease, while Greece, France, and Germany were close to it. Also, the work
of Ranjan (2020) estimates the spreading of COVID-19 along different geographical
areas by using the logistic, the SIR, and generalized SEIR models. The analysis
showed that both the SIR and the generalized SEIR models yield similar estimates
for the areas where epidemic curves show flattening trends. According to these
models, the final size of the epidemic in the US, Italy, Spain, and Germany could be
1.1, 0.22, 0.24, and 0.19 million infected cases respectively. Further, the purpose of
the work of Kiesha et al. (2020) is to calculate the effects of the social distance
measures in the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic and therefore to provide
useful insights and practices to other countries.
On the other hand, provided that a significant number of infections (including
human coronaviruses) follow seasonal patterns, the study of Sajadi et al. (2020)
examined ERA-5 climate data, from cities with significant COVID-19 spread, in
comparison with those extracted from areas that have not yet been affected or the
infection has not significantly spread. Finally, the work of Petropoulos and
Makridakis (2020) tries to objectively predict the evolution of COVID-19 by using a
simple but robust methodology. The authors assume that the available infection
data, the number of deaths, and recoveries are reliable and that the future spreading
of the disease will follow the same pattern of the past. This work suggests a good
example in predicting the temporal spread of the disease, having potentially large
implications in terms of planning and decision making.
Whether focusing on the peculiarities of the Greek COVID-19 spread, both
epidemiologically and in terms of policy implementation, this paper provides an
exploratory temporal study based on the analysis of COVID-19 infection data in
Greece.
4. Dataset and Methodology
To accurately approach the modeling problem, the prime goal is to find the
mathematical expression that can model the data of the disease spread in Greece and
to describe how cases increase over time. At next, the rate of change of the disease is
calculated and the variation of the available variables is approached with the
Regression Splines methodology, which provides the best possible fitting to the
available data (Norusis, 2008; De Boor et al., 2020). Finally, a novel method that was
proposed by Demertzis et al. (2020) for predicting the flattening of the curve is
implemented, which is based on a hybrid Regression Splines and Complex Network
approach.
4.1. Data

The available data were drafted from the Hellenic Ministry of Health and are
freely available on the official website https://eody.gov.gr/ of the Ministry in Greece.
The data include daily measurements during the period from 26 Feb 2020 to 26 June

7 of 17
2020 and regard the day of cases (variable: Day_ID), the total infected cases (variable:
All_Cases), the daily new cases (variable: New_Cases), the daily new deaths
(variable: New_Deaths), daily recovered cases (variable: Recovered), daily patients
entering to ICUs (variable: ICU), the daily change of active cases (variable:
Active_Cases), and the diagnostic tests performed per day (variable: Tests).
A first observation to the measurements related to the COVID-19 spread in
Greece shows that this dataset is a continuous time-series, which initially appears
inclining trend and afterwards shows signs of stability. Also, no time-variant
fluctuations are observed, since the time-series does not show periodicity
(seasonality) or cyclic structure. Although the available sample is not sufficiently
enough, these observations illustrate that the COVID-19 temporal spread in Greece
is more closely to a structure of stationary than a periodic structure. A more in-depth
analysis builds on understanding the historical behavior of the disease and on
estimating the parameters describing a good model fitting to the available timeseries data.
4.2. Regression Splines

Regression splines are parts of a segmented polynomial function that maintains
a high smoothness at the points connecting successive polynomials (De Boor et al.,
2020). They are essentially segmented polynomial approaches, which are very useful
due to their flexibility, simplicity, ease, accuracy of evaluation, and their ability to
approximate complex curves by fitting simple polynomial models (Norusis, 2008).
As previously shown, while polynomial regression can be very effective in terms
of estimation, it is complex in deciding the polynomial degree and therefore the type
of model that better fits to the available data (Walpole et al., 2020). For instance,
choosing a high degree polynomial may cause over-fitting issues, while fitting a low
degree polynomial usually leads to loss of information. Also, the polynomial degree
is directly related to the bias-variance tradeoff (Geman et al., 2020). That is, a highorder polynomial is directly related to high variance, while a low-order polynomial
describing the same model has low variance. On the other hand, high-order
polynomials have high determination and therefore low bias, while low-order
polynomials have low determination that leads to high bias. This bias-variance
tradeoff is described by the expression (Demertzis et al., 2020):
𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑑𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠 = (𝑏𝑖𝑎𝑠)2 + 𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 + 𝑛𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑒

(1)

where
(𝑏𝑖𝑎𝑠)2 = ∫{𝐸𝐷 [𝑦(𝑥; 𝐷)] − ℎ(𝑥 )}2 𝑝(𝑥)𝑑𝑥
𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 = ∫𝐸𝐷 [{𝑦(𝑥; 𝐷 )] − 𝐸𝐷 [𝑦(𝑥; 𝐷)}2 ]𝑝(𝑥)𝑑𝑥
𝑛𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑒 = ∬{ℎ(𝑥) − 𝑡}2 𝑝(𝑥, 𝑡)𝑑𝑥𝑑𝑡
In general, simple models are described by small variance but high
determination, while more complex models by small loss of information but high

8 of 17
variability (Geman et al., 2020), a fact that validates the bias-variance trade-off rule.
Within this context, the choice for the best model requires a balance between level
of determination and bias (Demertzis et al., 2020). Also in cases of variant volatility,
parts of non-linear behavior, temporary randomness, and generally irregular
structure of the time-series data, the polynomial regression model will not provide
good fittings. This is the main reason why polynomial regression is suitable for
modeling smoothed data (Norusis, 2008; Walpole et al., 2020). Overall, provided that
they yield high determination, polynomial regression models should be used in
typical cases to avoid excessive solutions leading to over-fitting.
In contrast, splines regression applies low-degree polynomial fittings, avoiding
thus the Runge effect (Stone et al., 1997) describing higher-order polynomial
approaches. The rationale of regression splines is based on the fact that every
polynomial function can be written as a linear combination of simpler functions
(Geman et al., 2020). The range of the independent variable is divided into “knots”,
which define the end of one spline part and the beginning of the next. Overall, the
splines are defined so that the resulting fitting curve to be smooth and continuous,
thus limiting the variable to be linear at the edges (Demertzis et al., 2020). For
instance, the expression:
𝐽

{ℎ𝑘 (𝑥 ) − 𝑡}𝑘=1,…,𝐽 : 𝑟(𝑥 ) = ∑ 𝛽𝑘 ℎ𝑘 (𝑥 )

(2)

𝑘=1

is defined by the terms ℎ𝑘 (𝑥 ) that may express m−degree polynomials or a summand
of linear functions defined in the domain {𝛢𝑘 = [𝜉𝑘 , 𝜉𝑘+1 ]}𝑘=1,…,𝛫 according to the
expression (Stone et al., 1997; Geman et al., 2020):
ℎ𝑘 (𝑥 ) = 𝛪𝛢𝑘 (𝑥) and ℎ

𝑘
2+𝑘

𝑘

(𝑥) = 𝛪𝛢𝑘 (𝑥 ), for 𝑘 = 1, … , , thus 𝐾 = 𝐽
2

(3)

Creating a spline requires defining knots on the spline curve so that to be as
smooth as possible. Two choices are here required; the first is to define the number
and position of knots and the second to define the degree of polynomial fitted to the
interval defined between successive nodes (Demertzis et al., 2020). The major
demand is to define individual curves so that to intersect in a “smoothly” way.
Therefore, a spline function is a group of “smoothly connected” square polynomials,
implying that, for polynomials of degree m, both the spline function and their first
derivatives m-1 should be continuous at the knots. In case that k knots are used,
fitting a polynomial of degree m requires estimating k+m–1 regression parameters.
For instance, for polynomials of degree (M–1), which are defined in K intervals
and have their first (M–2) derivatives continuous at the boundaries of the intervals
(nodes), the spline fitting is calculated as follows (Geman et al., 2020):
ℎ1 (𝑥 ) = 1, ℎ2 (𝑥 ) = 𝑥, ℎ𝑀 (𝑥 ) = 𝑥 𝑀−1 , ℎ𝑀−1+𝑘 (𝑥 ) = (𝑥 − 𝜉𝑘 )𝑀−1
+
= 2, … , 𝐾

𝑘

(4),

or equivalently:
𝐽 = (𝑀 ) + [ 𝐾 − 2 + 1] = 𝑀 + 𝐾 − 1

(5).

9 of 17
Either a few in number intervals K or low polynomial-order M–1 implies high
bias, whereas the opposite expresses σημαίνει high variance.
It has been empirically shown that five knots suffice to create several non-linear
paths (Demertzis et al., 2020). In practice, cubic splines (i.e. third-order polynomials)
are commonly used, which allow modeling the curve structures and simultaneously
provide sufficient fitting flexibility, whereas they do not require as many degrees of
freedom as higher-order splines do (Geman et al., 2020; Demertzis et al., 2020). To
estimate the regression splines, we define the Χ matrix as follows (Geman et al.,
2020):
ℎ1 (𝑥1 )
𝑋=[ ⋮
ℎ1 (𝑥𝑛 )

⋯
⋯

ℎ𝐽 (𝑥1 )
⋮ ]
ℎ𝐽 (𝑥𝑛 )

(6),

and the interpolation matrix L as follows (Geman et al., 2020):
𝐿 = 𝑋(𝑋 𝑇 𝑋)−1 𝑋 𝑇

(7).

Within this context, the least square estimators are defined by the relation
(Geman et al., 2020):
𝐽

𝑟̂ (𝑥𝑖 ) = ∑ 𝑧𝑖𝑗 𝑦𝑗 : 𝑟̂ = 𝐿𝑦

(8),

𝑗=1

which yields (Geman et al., 2020):
𝐸(𝑟̂ ) = 𝐿 ∙ 𝑟̂

(9),

𝑇

where 𝑟̂ = (𝑟(𝑥1 ) … 𝑟(𝑥𝑛 )) , 𝑣𝑎𝑟(𝑟̂ ) = 𝜎 2 𝐿𝐿𝑇 , which equals to 𝑣𝑎𝑟[𝑟̂ (𝑥𝑖 )] =
2

𝜎 2 ‖𝑧(𝑥𝑖 )‖ with 𝑧(𝑥𝑖 ) defined by the z-th row of L as follows (Geman et al., 2020):
𝐶𝑉 =

1
𝑦𝑖 − 𝑦̂𝑖 2
∑(
)
𝑛
1 − 𝑧𝑖𝑖

(10).

Although Regression Splines suggest an excellent fitting method for modeling
the temporal spread of COVID-19 in Greece (a method that can provide solutions in
several malfunctions related to randomness and generally to non-linear structures
of the time-series), the major problem of this method is its dependence on the usually
arbitrary choice of knot defining the spline parts of the overall curve (Demertzis et
al., 2020). In the literature (Traa and Smaragdis, 2014; Zhou et al. 2018; Chen et al.
2019), most of the repairing approaches rely on purely heuristic conceptualization
building either on visual differences, or seasonal behavior, or user experience, or
experts’ opinions.
The criterion used in this paper to define the spline knots is based on a recent
methodology proposed by the authors of this paper (Tsiotas and Magafas, 2020;
Demertzis et al. 2020), which builds on complex network analysis to evaluate the
effectiveness of the COVID-19 temporal spread in Greece. The analysis revealed five
distinct parts in the structure of the COVID-19 infection curve, which are defined by
the intervals Q1= [1 − 4] ⋃[9 − 19], Q2=[5-8], Q3=[20-26], Q4=[27-32], and Q5=[33 -43]

10 of 17
(Tsiotas and Magafas, 2020). In this outcome, the definition of the non-convex Q1
interval, which is impossible to detect by other either linear of non-linear time-series
approaches, illustrates the added value of the proposed methodology.
5. Forecasting
To predict the COVID-19 temporal spread in Greece within the best possible
determination ability, we apply a combined model of complex-network defined
splines, as proposed by Demertzis et al (2020). In particular, on the available set of
time-series data (𝑥1 , 𝑓(𝑥1 )), … , (𝑥𝑛 , 𝑓(𝑥𝑛 )), the proposed model calculates an optimal
approximation of the pairwise polynomial function defined on the sub-domains Q1,
Q2, Q3, Q4, and Q5 that are computed by the complex-network approach proposed
by Tsiotas and Magafas (2020). The main goal of the approach is to construct the best
possible fitting model describing the Greek COVID-19 infection curve.
5.1 Rate of Change

Prior forecasting, the change rate of the COVID-19 spread in Greece should be
calculated. By considering the increase of infected cases as a sequence, we can define
two successive terms αν and αν+1 with the relation αν+1 = αν + m, where m is the change
rate of the sequence. Within this context, the relation between the change rate m and
the total number of daily infection is expressed as follows:
𝑚=

𝛥𝑦𝑡
𝛥𝑦𝑡+1

(11),

where 𝛥𝑦𝑡 is the number of new cases in day t and 𝛥𝑦𝑡+1 in day t+1. That is, a unit
change of the quantity 𝛥𝑦1 induces an m-times change of 𝛥𝑦2 . When m>0, the
sequence is ascending, when m<0 the sequence is decreasing, and when m=1 the
sequence is constant. The change rate of the available 65-day period is shown in
Fig.2.

Figure 2. Line plot of the Change Rates of all cases in Greece (https://eody.gov.gr/)

As it can be observed, there were significant fluctuations in the change rate in
the first 19 days, while at next the rate follows a smooth trend. The average change
rate was calculated according to the equation:

〈𝑚〉 = ∑ 𝑦𝑖 = (𝑦1 + ⋯ + 𝑦𝑛 )

(12).

𝑖=1

For n = 46 (which refers to the period of 46 days being studied that starts from
19 day prior to which the change rate includes significant fluctuations) the average
change rate yields 〈𝑚〉=1.049521.

5.2 Regression Splines Forecasting

The modeling approach based on Regression Splines builds on the measure of
change rate defined in relation (11). Provided that the time-series being under
consideration has a constant change rate, the Regression Splines Algorithm (RSA)
was used to forecast a period of the next 62 days (see Table 1), until 01 July 2020,
which refers to the date of tourism opening starts in Greece.

The RSA was run under the error minimization criterion (Stone et al., 1997;
Geman et al., 2020). In particular, the model was constructed according to the
following relations:
𝑓̂(𝑥𝑘 ) = ℎ(𝑥𝑘 ) − 𝑔(𝑥𝑘 )
𝑔(𝑥𝑘 ) = (𝑓̂(𝑥𝑘−1 ) ∗ 𝑈 (𝑥𝑘 )) ∗ 〈𝑚〉
𝑈 (𝑥𝑘 ) = 〈𝑚〉 − 𝑈 (𝑥𝑘−1 )

(13),

ℎ(𝑥𝑘 ) = (𝑔(𝑥𝑘 ) ∗ 𝑚) + (𝑔(𝑥𝑘 ) ∗ 𝑈 (𝑥𝑘 )) ∗ 〈𝑚〉
where 〈𝑚〉 is the average change rate, 𝑓^(𝑥𝑘−1 ) is the number of infection in day k-1,
𝑈(𝑥𝑘 ) is the daily change rate for day k, which is defined by the residual of the
average change rate minus the daily change rate of day k-1. As it come of from this
optimization approach, the prediction error is significantly smoothened due to the
polynomial nature of the Regression Splines algorithm, which increases
exponentially for long-term predictions. Accordingly, the change rate remains
stable, which verifies the effectiveness of the methodological approach.
5.3 Flattening of the Curve

Based on the previous approaches, we develop a combined method for
flattening the COVID-19 infection curve in Greece. Provided that the problem is
initially described by a stage of exponential growth, in which the growth rate
gradually decreases and ends asymptotically to growth saturation, we apply a
Logistic regression prediction technique, with sigmoid curve development, to model
the Greek COVID-19 infection curve. The model that we construct is of the form
(Norusis, 2008):
𝑓 (𝑧 ) =

𝑒𝑧
1
=
1 + 𝑒 𝑧 1 + 𝑒 −𝑧

(14),

13 of 17
where z is the predictor (independent) variable and f(z) is the response (dependent)
variable. More broadly, variable z represents a group of independent variables,
whereas f(z) determines the probability of the outcome caused due to this group
(Walpole et al., 2012). Variable z also expresses the total contribution of all
independent variables in the model and is defined as (Norusis, 2008):
𝑧 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 𝛸1 + 𝛽2 𝛸2 + ⋯ + +𝛽𝑘 𝛸𝑘

(15),

where β0 is the intersect term of the regression line that is equal to z when all
independent variables are zero, whereas βi are the regression coefficients expressing
the contribution of each variable to the total variation of the model. A positive value
of coefficient indicates that the predictor variable increases the probability of a
successful outcome (i.e. the event occurs) whereas a negative value implies that the
variable reduces the probability of this outcome. High coefficient values express a
strong influence of the independent variable to the formation of the dependent
variable, whereas low values indicate small contribution of the independent variable
on the occurrence of the corresponding outcome (Norusis, 2008).
To calculate the upper bound of the model forecasting, a hybrid method was
used based on averaging. At first, the highest value (i.e. 3,435 infected cases) that
was predicted by the Regression Splines algorithm (for the 127th day) was
considered. The second value was calculated according to a heuristic approximation
based on the formula:
𝑈𝑝𝑏2 = 𝑓 (𝑥127 ) ∗ 〈𝑚〉 = 3,435 ∗ 1,049521 = 3,932

(16),

where 𝑓 (𝑥127 ) is the number of total infections in Greece at the 127η day (equal to
3,435 infected cases) and 〈𝑚〉 is the average of the infections’ change rate, which was
computed according to the relation:
𝑈𝑝𝑏 =

𝑈𝑝𝑏1 + 𝑈𝑝𝑏2 3,435 + 3,932
=
= 3,683

(17),

By applying this approach for estimating the maximum outcome of the logistic
regression, we obtained the results shown in Table 2.

According to Table 2, there is a considerably high level of determination of the
model (R2=0.938), which allows predicting future values of the Greek pandemic
curve in high precision. This determination level appears particularly important
because it provides an effective model for predicting the flattening of the pandemic
curve in Greece and is crucial for providing insights about the effectiveness at which
the Greek health system is expected to respond in the future provided that the

14 of 17
pandemic will be described by the same dynamics. Such information will be directly
linked to the application of extra or the relaxation of social measures.
6. Discussion
The previous analysis illustrates that the proposed approach facilitated the
construction of a reliable model since in all cases it led to accurate results that
strengthened the forecasting process. In addition, one of the major advantages of the
model regards its high reliability due to low residuals, which can be considered as a
result of the added value obtained from the complex network conceptualization of
the splines regression algorithm.
The complex-network-defined splines regression algorithm provides a solid
background delimiting the most relevant dataset in the forecasting process. It is also
notable that the proposed methodology models the spread of the Greek pandemic
in the most realistic way because, except from the infection data, it takes into account
the real context of the applied policies, which improves the level of complexity in
the proposed methodology and therefore its realism.
Finally, the added value of the regression splines technique applied in this paper
should be evaluated in conjunction with the improvements that the proposed
method provides in terms of high accuracy, low multi-collinearity, and model
specification. The proposed model offers high accuracy in prediction and stability,
as its overall behavior is less noisy, while reducing the overall risk of a particularly
poor choice cause from insufficient sampling or model configuration. This is also
supported by the variance of the expected error that is minimized, implying the
reliability and the universality of the proposed model.
However, an important restriction affecting the reliability of the proposed
methodology is the availability of the time-series data used for the model
construction. Within this context, the complex network conceptualization of the
spline regression algorithm equips the model with additional degrees of freedom to
the extent that it incorporates latent information that becomes visible or applicable
only through a higher order transformation (i.e. from time-series to a complex
network) applied to the source time-series.
Within this context, the ability to accurately predict the future of a pandemic is
an extremely important but difficult task. Due to the restricted current knowledge
of the new COVID-19 pandemic, to the high level of uncertainty, and to the complex
socio-political factors that influence the spread of the new virus, any technically
sound methodology for analyzing or predicting the phenomenon is an important
legacy and hopeful supply in the fight against the disease.
7. Conclusions
This paper studied the COVID-19 temporal spread in Greece and proposed an
innovative, realistic, and highly reliable methodology for forecasting the flattening
of the curve, based on the spline and logistic regression algorithm, along with the
complex network analysis. A considerable added value of the proposed model

15 of 17
concerns the complex-network-based conceptualization of the time-series partition
into spline segments, according to which the knot-vector of the spline algorithm was
defined by the community detection analysis applied to the graph associated to the
time-series of the COVID-19 infection curve. In general, the proposed model can
create highly realistic scenarios for the evaluation and study of the pandemic, which
are directly related to the sociability and mobility of citizens. The very high
determination achieved by the proposed model is indicative to its effectiveness and
reliability to the extent that it incorporates fitting techniques of high resolution with
latent information being visible after transforming the time-series into a complex
network. Provided that this study aimed to develop a framework for selecting the
appropriate research methods for the further comprehension and interpretation of
the disease, as well as to facilitate critical decisions regarding the allocation and
management of the available health resources, the proposed methodology
contributed to this purpose by introducing an integrated framework incorporating
several modeling techniques of time-series analysis. The particularly low error rates
that resulted by the proposed method contribute to decision-making and to the
examination of the pandemic at a wider spatio-temporal level.
The overall approach showed that, up to the day that Greece opened its borders
to foreign tourism, the COVID-19 infection curve was moving into a saturation point
describing the flattening dynamics of the curve. This seemed to allow the country
deciding to be receptive to the externality of foreign tourism, which started at the
very next day of the end of the dataset considered in this study. Within this context,
this paper introduces avenues for further research both in methodological and in
implementation terms. In methodological terms, future improvements of the
proposed methodology should focus on further optimization of the algorithm
parameters that used in the model, both of the regression splines and logistic
regression algorithms and of the associated complex network conceptualization.
Mode avenues of further research could emerge towards the direction of future
model expansion, such as the implementation of a hybrid learning system based on
the proposed architecture, which with methods of self-improvement and
redefinition of its parameters can be lead to a fully automated forecasting. In
implementation terms, further research should build on the current dataset of the
COVID-19 infection time-series curve in Greece, aiming to measure the effect of
foreign tourism in the evolution of the disease, as well as on incorporating more
national cases into a broader spatio-temporal study of pan-European or world level,
so that to verify the generalization of the method in more complex environments.
Overall, this paper provided a modeling and forecasting tool facilitating
decision making and resource management in epidemiology, which can contribute
to the ongoing fight against the pandemic of COVID-19.
