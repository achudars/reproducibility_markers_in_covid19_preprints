Abstract
A model of reactive social distancing in epidemics is proposed, in
which the infection rate changes with the number infected. The finalsize equation for the total number that the epidemic will infect can be
derived analytically, as can the peak infection proportion. This model
could assist planners during for example the COVID-19 pandemic.

Introduction

Let the proportions of a population who are susceptible, infected and removed or recovered (now immune) be s(t), i(t), r(t) respectively. Then the
SIR compartmental model can be written:
ds(t)/ dt = −βs(t)i(t),
di(t)/ dt = βs(t)i(t) − αi(t),
dr(t)/ dt = αi(t),
where t denotes time, β is the rate at which an infected individual infects
others and α the rate of recovery/death. The last equation is not needed as
s(t) + i(t) + r(t) = 1. The basic reproduction number R0 = β/α.

model when R0 = 2.5, α = 1/9 per day, starting with one infected individual in a population of 66.44 million.

The properties of this simple model are well understood; see e.g. Brauer,
Castillo-Chavez and Feng (2019). Predictions starting with one infected case
are shown in figure 1.
This model is simplistic, e.g. because it assumes exponentially-distributed
dwell times in the compartments and ignores differences in behaviour arising
from demographics. However, this model is more than a ‘toy’ model, and
can be used to make quite useful predictions of the course of of epidemics.
For example, for SIR models, a final size relation can be derived, which is a
nonlinear equation for s∞ , the proportion who remain uninfected when the
epidemic is over. Starting with a susceptible population, the formula is
− ln(s∞ ) = R0 (1 − s∞ ).
A feature of diseases such as influenza and those caused by coronaviruses
such as SARS, MERS and COVID-19, is that individuals practice social
distancing to reduce the contact rate β. If R0 could be reduced below
unity, an epidemic would fade away and could be got rid of, but except in a
small isolated community some virus would always remain, and when social
distancing was relaxed, the epidemic would begin anew. However, as the
rate of growth of the number infected is (R0 − 1)α, decreasing R0 slows the
epidemic, and reduces the percentage infected.
In this article a simple model of social distancing is introduced. Yu et
al (2017) describe such models. What is novel here is that the proportion
infected i(t) can be found in terms of s(t), and so a final-size equation can be
derived, plus the peak proportion of the population infected. Such formulae
may help planners trying to slow the epidemic to reduce peak demand on
health services while preventing the total shutdown of industry.

The model

The contact rate β is replaced by β(t) = β/(1 + γi(t)). Hence the contact
rate decreases as infection levels rise, and increases again as they fall. As
infection level i(t) tends to zero, we regain the regular SIR model, so R0 is
unchanged.
The function i(t)/(1 + γi(t)) is a Hill function. Many other functions
could be used here, but with the Hill function an analytic solution is possible.
The new model is thus:
ds(t)/ dt = −

γ = 20 under the social distancing model when R0 = 2.5.

The model is a reasonable model of behaviour, because numbers dying
daily will be widely known, which is a slightly-lagged proxy for i(t). Hence
individuals have the information on which to act. Government-mediated
social distancing may also approximate the situation of reactive distancing.
Figure 2 shows the evolution of proportions infected for the model with
γ = 0 and γ = 20.
Dividing the model equations, we have
di(s)/ ds = −

Writing x = ln(s), we have that
di(x)/ dx −

i(x) = α/β − exp(x).
β

This is an ordinary differential equation for i(x), which can be solved by
standard methods. These are: solve the homogeneous equation to get the
complementary function, find the particular integral using for example the
D-operator method, and find the unknown constant multiplying the complementary function by requiring that i = 0 when s = 1. This yields
i(t) = (

where we have transformed back from x to s.
When γ = R0 the solution method fails, and the equation becomes
di/ dx − i = 1/R0 − exp(x).
Solving this, we obtain
i(s) = (s − 1)/R0 − s ln s.

In general, the final-size equation for s∞ , the number never infected, can
now be found by setting i(t) = 0. Then

Equation (4) can be solved numerically for s∞ using for example the NewtonRaphson method of iteration, and converges quickly. For the special case,
(s − 1)/R0 = s ln s.
Also of interest is the peak proportion infected. Setting di/ ds = 0 in (1)
yields imax = Rγ0 (smax − 1/R0 ), and substituting in (2) gives the nonlinear
equation

Figure 3: Proportion remaining uninfected and peak proportion infected
under the social distancing model when R0 = 2.5.
As γ → 0 we regain smax = 1/R0 . As γ → ∞, the left-hand side of (4)
goes to zero as s∞ < 1. Then s∞ → 1/R0 , the minimum number to give
herd immunity and bring the epidemic to an end. Thus extreme reactive
social distancing gives the minimum number of infections possible, whilst
necessarily prolonging the duration of the epidemic.
For the special case, s = exp(−(1 − 1/R0 )) and imax = s − 1/R0 . These
special-case solutions can be found either from (3) or by using L’Hospital’s
rule. Figure 3 shows s∞ and imax plotted against γ.
Finally, from (5), as γ → ∞, the effective reproduction number at peak
infection R0 /(1 + γimax ) → 1.

Conclusions

An epidemic model with reactive social distancing has been described, for
which the final number of infections and the peak infection proportion can be
found analytically. Unlike a fixed reduction in contact rate, reactive social

6

distancing allows the epidemic to complete and not restart when distancing
is relaxed. In the limit that γ → ∞ the number left uninfected decreases to
1/R0 .
How could this model be used as a planning aid when the value of γ
is unknown? The model or a more sophisticated one could be formally
or informally fitted to data and the effective value of γ estimated. That
would give the likely course of the epidemic. One could then see how much
more (or less) social distancing would be required for the optimal outcome
that balances mortality and pressure on health services against economic
disruption.
