Abstract
Identifying the relative importance of the different transmission routes of the SARSCoV-2 virus is an urgent research priority. To that end, the different transmission
routes, and their role in determining the evolution of the Covid-19 pandemic are analyzed in this work. Probability of infection caused by inhaling virus-laden droplets
(initial, ejection diameters between 0.5 − 750µm) and the corresponding desiccated
nuclei that mostly encapsulate the virions post droplet evaporation, are individually
calculated. At typical, air-conditioned yet quiescent indoor space, for average viral
loading, cough droplets of initial diameter between 10 − 50µm have the highest infection probability. However, by the time they are inhaled, the diameters reduce to about
1/6th of their initial diameters. While the initially near unity infection probability
due to droplets rapidly decays within the first 25s, the small yet persistent infection
probability of desiccated nuclei decays appreciably only by O(1000s), assuming the

with molecular collision theory adapted to calculate frequency of contact between the
susceptible population and the droplet/nuclei cloud, infection rate constants are derived ab initio, leading to a SEIR model applicable for any respiratory event - vector
combination. Viral load, minimum infectious dose, sensitivity of the virus half-life to
the phase of its vector and dilution of the respiratory jet/puff by the entraining air
are shown to mechanistically determine specific physical modes of transmission and
variation in the basic reproduction number R0 , from first principle calculations.

Introduction

One of the longstanding questions of pandemics involving respiratory droplets is identifying
their dominant mode of transmission. The most well recognized pathways for contagious
respiratory diseases are i) the direct contact/inhalation of the relatively larger infectious
droplets (> 5µm) commonly known as the droplet mode of transmission, ii) airborne or
aerosol transmission which is presumed to be caused by inhalation of very small infectious
droplets (< 5µm) floating in air and iii) contact with infectious surfaces - fomites. For
the present Covid-19 pandemic, while the droplet mode of transmission is well established,
evidence/possibility for aerosol transmission [1, 2] renders identifying the dominant transmission route an intriguing scientific problem with extremely high implications for human
health and public policy. On July 9, 2020, World Health Organization issued a scientific
brief [3] stating “Urgent high-quality research is needed to elucidate the relative importance
of different transmission routes; the role of airborne transmission in the absence of aerosol
generating procedures.” In this paper, we establish a fundamental theoretical framework
where the relative strength of the individual transmission routes are analyzed from first
principles with idealizing assumptions. Many biological aspects of the disease transmission,
including but not limited to effects of immune response are beyond the scope of this paper
and will not be addressed here with exclusive focus on the physical aspects [4] of the disease
transmission. Physics is involved in at least four levels in a Covid-19 type pandemic evolution, micro-scale droplet physics, spray/droplet-cloud physics, collision/interaction between

2

the spray/cloud and the susceptible individuals, deposition and absorption of the inhaled
droplets/droplet nuclei. First three are addressed in this paper at different levels of complexity. We adopt the convention that respiratory droplets (all liquid phase droplets of all
sizes, typically 0.5-750µm) cause disease transmission by “droplet or d” route, whereas dried
or desiccated droplet nuclei which in this paper refers to the semi-solid/crystalline residue
that remains after the droplet liquid evaporates, is responsible for the “dried droplet nuclei
or n” route of transmission. Thus, the d route invariably includes droplets less than as well
as greater than 5µm, instead of resorting to the rather arbitrary threshold to distinguish
between droplets and nuclei. The reason of our choice is that, the distinct thermodynamic
phase of the transmission vector: liquid versus semi-solid is expected to be a much better
identifier to delineate the different pathways. Furthermore, the virus survivability within the
dried droplet nuclei could be well different from that of the liquid droplet. Small and medium
sized droplets do remain airborne after their ejection for substantially long periods of time
[5] due to the fact that droplet size continuously changes, except in highly humid conditions
(RH∞ > 85%), due to evaporation until desiccation. Respiratory droplets are ejected during
different expiratory events: breath, cough, sing, sneeze or talk (ing), when the droplets are
ejected with different droplet size distributions [6, 7, 8]. In violent expiratory events like
coughing or sneezing, the droplets co-move with a turbulent jet of exhaled air. The trajectories of the jet and the droplets could diverge due to aerodynamic drag and gravity effects.
Nevertheless, experiments by Bourouiba et al. [9, 10] have shown that these droplets can
travel rather large distances initially within a turbulent jet which later transitions to a puff
or a cloud due to the lack of a continuous momentum source. Depending on the ambient
conditions and droplet size, these droplets evaporate at different times. However, while water
- the volatile component of the mucosalivary liquid, evaporates, the non-volatile components
- salt, protein, mucous and virus particles present, separate out by crystallization processes.
These semi-solid droplet residues, typically about 10-20% of the initial droplet diameter are
called dried droplet nuclei, remain floating as aerosols and are believed to be responsible
for airborne mode of droplet transmission. While only very few experiments have so far
probed the structure of these dried droplet nuclei, the first of its kind work by Vejerano
and Marr [11] provided critical insights on the distribution of virus particles inside the dried
3

droplet nuclei. Marr et al. [12] offered mechanistic insights on the role of relative humidity
in respiratory droplet evaporation but the question on the role of evaporation, the resulting
chemistry inside the dried droplet nuclei on virus survivability persisted. This was explored
by Lin and Marr in [13]. It was found that virus survivability inside sessile droplets is a nonmonotonic function of ambient relative humidity, and of course dependent on the specific
virus type as well. Questions on the survivability of the SARS-CoV-2 virus inside the dried
droplet nuclei from contact free droplets, as it would happen for respiratory sprays, is not
yet settled. In this paper, first we present a model to identify the probability of infection
transmission for two different routes d and n, by accounting for the corresponding droplet
size distribution, viral load and virus half-life. Next, we briefly present the droplet/nuclei
cloud aerodynamics and respiratory droplet evaporation physics. 1% NaCl-water solution is
used as a surrogate for the mucosalivary fluid. This is followed by modeling the generalized
infection rate constant which can be used in theory for any kind of expiratory event or for
any mode of transmission. The rate constant is then incorporated into a SEIR model [14]
using the formalism of a chemical reaction mechanism. Finally, the results and discussions
are presented followed by conclusion.
In most epidemiological models, the rate constants (parameters of the SEIR differential
equations) which lead to the R0 are obtained by fitting available data on the number of
new infections [14, 15]. Indeed, this type of epidemiological models have provided immense
insights on Covid-19 and the necessity of non-pharmaceutical public health interventions [15,
16, 17]. However, it is to be recognized that the data for a Covid-19 type pandemic is almost
always under-reported due to large number of asymptomatic cases. Furthermore, the actual
rate constants and R0 could depend on several physical factors like temperature, relative
humidity, UV-index etc. Thus, with changing conditions, parameters obtained from fitting
recent past data may not be adequate, standalone, to predict nature of future outbreaks.
Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop a framework to understand and calculate R0
from ab initio calculations while being cognizant of the idealizing assumptions and limitations
involved in the process. To the authors’ knowledge this is the first time aerodynamics and
thermodynamics of the droplets/nuclei, viral load, half-life and minimum required viral dose
for infection, have been systematically accounted to obtain the rate constants and R0 of a
4

SEIR model, ab initio.

Probability of infection by different transmission routes

In this subsection, we estimate the probability of infection by different transmission modes
for any expiratory event. Consider an infected person I exhaling a droplet laden jet that
quickly transforms into a droplet cloud D in vicinity of susceptible individuals S as shown
in Fig. 1.

R or X. The red ellipse marks the control volume analyzed for computing the probability
of infection Pαβ .
The instantaneous diameter of the respiratory jet/puff/cloud is given by σD , its velocity
with respect to S is given by V~DS , while the effective diameter of the hemispherical volume of
5

air inhaled by S, for every breath, is given by σS . σDS = (σD + σS )/2. The primary objective
of this subsection is to estimate Pαβ (t) which denotes the time dependent probability of
infection of S for the given expiratory event α and type of transmission vector β. Thus, α
denotes one among breathing, coughing, singing, sneezing or talking, while β denotes one
among droplets, dried droplet nuclei or fomites. It is to be recognized that σDS , V~DS are
not only functions of time, but also dependent on α and β, though their subscripts have
been dropped for brevity. As the droplet/nuclei cloud entrains surrounding air, it grows
in size with concomitant dilution of the particles inside, thereby reducing Pαβ . Of course
Pαβ must also be determined by the viral load and droplet size distribution. Pαβ could be
obtained by solving the transport equations. Instead, here we take a Lagrangian approach
of tracking and analyzing the control volume of the air-droplet cloud D ejected by I and
droplets/droplet-nuclei within.
At the moment of the onset of the expiratory event denoted by t = 0, a log-normal
distribution could be used to describe the probability density function (pdf) of the initial
droplet size distribution fα of the ejected respiratory spray.

D is the sample space variable of the initial droplet diameter Ds,0 . µ and σ are the mean and
standard deviation of ln(D). If Ntα is the total number of droplets ejected for the expiratory
event α, the number of droplets within the interval dD is given by Ntα fα (D)dD. Therefore,
for a given fα and ρv - the viral load in number of copies per unit volume of the ejected

For the SARS-CoV-2 virus, Wölfel reported [18] the average viral load in sputum to be
ρv = 7×106 copies/ml while the maximum is given by ρv,max = 2.35×109 copies/ml. Utilizing
Eqn. 2, we can define Nαd (t) - time dependent number of virions inhaled from droplets. For
an infection to occur, some non-zero number of active virion must be found in the droplets
present in the total volume of air inhaled. Maximum time for S to cross the volume with
diameter σDS is given by tcross = (σS + σD )/VDS while number of breaths per unit time is
6

Nb ≈ 16/60s−1 [19] and volume inhaled per breath is Vb = (4/6)πσS3 . Therefore total volume
of air inhaled while crossing the respiratory cloud is Va = (4/6)πNb σS3 (σS + σD )/VDS . The

life of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in d or n. While the half-life of the SARS-Cov-2 within
aerosols, in general could be estimated from [20], the distinction of the half-life of the virus
within droplets or dried droplet nuclei is not yet available to our knowledge. While this
information is indeed most critical, in view of its absence, for the present work we will
mostly assume ψd (t) = ψn (t) = ψ(t) and tβ 1 = t 1 , unless specifically mentioned. At typical

indoor conditions: T∞ = 21.1 C, RH∞ = 50% and with UV index = 1 on a scale of 10, the

D1 (t)

Here, D1 (t) and D2 (t) are the minimum and maximum of initial droplet diameters, respectively, available in the droplet cloud after time t as shown in Fig. 2. The non-linearity of
the tsettle vs. Ds,0 (in log-log plot of Fig. 2) occurs due to phase transition of the droplet
population. Beyond τd all droplets have been converted into dried droplet nuclei. At time t
droplets with Ds,0 < D1 (t) have evaporated and those have been converted to dried droplet
nuclei, while Ds,0 > D2 (t) have escaped by gravitational settling, and have been converted
to potential fomites. Clearly, as σD increases with time, Nαd decreases due to dilution effects and also because droplet numbers are depleted by evaporation and settling. Since, the
maximum evaporation time of the airborne droplets: τd << tβ 1 , the effect of virus half-life
2

on Nαd is negligible. Details of the methodology to derive the parameters concerning the
respiratory jet and droplet dynamics from the conservation principles of mass, momentum,
energy and species could be found briefly, in subsections 2.2 and 2.3, respectively. Further
details could be found in Chaudhuri et al. [21].
It is essential to note that in many diseases, uncertainty exists over transmission routes.
For e.g. in case of Covid-19, the transmission by dried droplet nuclei, is not certain. As such,
we do not know for sure if the SARS-CoV-2 virus survives within dried droplet nuclei and
remain culturable [22], though there is evidence that some other virus do survive quite well
7

inside dried droplet nuclei [12]. Even if they do, their half-life and infection potential could
be different w.r.t. to those inside droplets. Thus, as would be shown later it is essential to
define different rate constants for the different transmission modes. Since the dried droplet
nuclei is a product of the droplets, itself, the two routes are highly coupled and are not
independent.

increase in σD with time, i.e. dilution effect as well due to virus half-life. Nαn (t) decreases
with time due to increase in σD with time, i.e. dilution effect as well due to virus half-life.
The generalized probability of infection Pαβ as a function of the infectious dose Nαβ can
now be expressed as

The form of Eqn. 6 is based on the dose response model by Haas [23], which has been
used by Nicas [24], Sze To et al. [25] and many other authors to calculate infection probability. Mathematically, it is also similar to the Wells-Riley equation [26], used by Buonanno
et al. [27] to assess the aerosol risk of SARS-CoV-2 during talking and breathing. However, in contrast to these works, here, droplet cloud aerodynamics (sub-section 2.2) coupled
with detailed droplet evaporation-nuclei production mechanism (sub-section 2.3) and droplet
settling dynamics are utilized in a semi-analytical framework to calculate the time varying
inhaled virion number and corresponding probability of infection, probably for the first time.
Eventually, as shown later, this framework will be used to calculate basic reproduction number R0 . As such the form of this equation is also validated by the results by Zwart et al.
[28], where rv is a constant for a particular virus. For this paper we will use rv = 0.5 such
that inhaling at least 10 virions by d and/or n route would result in an infection probability
Pαβ ≈ 1, unless specifically mentioned. In absence of this exact rv for the SARS-CoV-2
virus at the time of writing this paper, this is a guess. Hence, rv = 0.05 and rv = 0.005
corresponding to minimum infectious doses of 100 and 1000 virions, respectively will also be
eventually explored near the end of the paper.

2.2

Aerodynamics of droplets and nuclei

The droplets when ejected during respiratory events, follow the volume of exhaled air. Due
to continuous entrainment the exhaled air volume grows in diameter, and as a result its
9

kinetic energy decays with time. Bourouiba et al. [9] identified that for a short duration,
the exhaled droplets evolve inside a turbulent jet, which transitions to a puff at later stage.
Since the respiratory droplets or the dried nuclei experiences aerodynamic drag, it is essential
to identify the evolution of the surrounding jet or puff. Based on literature [29, 30, 31] of
transient turbulent jets and puff, the following evolution equations for the axial location,
velocity and radial spread could be used:
1/2



(8)

where subscript j and pf denote jet and puff, respectively. R0 and U0 are the radius and
axial velocity at a distance x0 . K is a characteristic constant for turbulent jet and is reported
to be 0.457 [29]. At the inception of the respiratory event (t = 0), the jet is assumed to have
a velocity Uj,0 = 10m/s and a radius Rj,0 = 14mm - the average radius of human mouth.
For analytical tractability, we assume that all droplets of all sizes are ejected at time t = 0
and would not consider time variation in ejection of the droplets. This is a safe assumption
since the expiratory event like cough, lasts less than a second and the turbulence of the
jet and the air entrained will rapidly disperse the ejected droplets into the jet/puff in any
case. The characteristic constants for puff are a ≈ 2.25 and m = (xp,0 a)/(3Rp,0 ) [30]. Since
the continuous ejection of air from mouth lasts only for the duration of the corresponding
respiratory event, the jet behavior persists only for this period. Beyond this time (≈ 1s [32]),
puff behavior is observed. Hence the velocity and the radial spread of the air surrounding

The horizontal displacement (Xp ) of the exhaled droplet and its instantaneous velocity (Up )
due to the drag can be solved with [33]:

(10)

Here, ρv and ρl are the vapor and liquid phase densities, respectively; Rs is the instantaneous
radius of the droplet and CD is the drag coefficient. We can assume CD = 24/Rep for the
gas phase Reynolds number, Rep = (2ρv |Ug − Up |Rs )/µg < 30 [33]. Rep for the respiratory
droplets are typically less than 0.1. At the time of ejection (t = 0) from respiratory cavities,
the droplets are assumed to have a velocity (Up,0 ) close to that of the surrounding air (Uj,0 ),
and hence Rep ≈ 0. Thus, for t = 0, we use Uj,0 − Up,0 = 0.01Uj,0 . tsettle (Ds,0 ) - the time
for a droplet with initial diameter Ds,0 to fall a height of 1.8m is calculated using Stokes’
settling velocity. Mathematically tsettle is obtained by Eqn. 11

By solving Eqns. 7-10 over the droplet and nuclei lifetime, the axial distance traveled by
them, XD , which is the distance of the center of the cloud, can be evaluated. As the velocity
of the individual droplets approach the surrounding gas velocity within a very short time, we
assume the absolute instantaneous velocity of the droplet/nuclei cloud is given by VD = Ug
from Eqn. 9. Since the droplets and nuclei are dispersed within the jet/puff, the diameter of
the droplet cloud ejected by I can be approximated as twice the radial spread of the exhaled
air, σD (t) = 2Rg (t).
The exhaled volume of air is initially at a temperature (Tg,0 = 33.25o C) and vapor mass
fraction (Y1,g,0 corresponding to RH0 = 71.6%) different from the ambient. The values
11

mentioned are averaged quantities measured over several subjects according to Mansour et
al. [34]. The instantaneous temperature and vapor mole fraction that the droplet would
encounter as its own ambient are the temperature (Tg (t)) and vapor mass fraction (Y1,g (t))
of this volume of air during its evolution. This can be expressed with the following scaling
relation [35]

Droplet evaporation

In this paper we use 1% NaCl-water droplets as the model respiratory droplet and adopt
a slightly revised evaporation model (with respect to that presented in [21]) for predicting
the droplet evaporation time tevap . It is to be recognized that the droplets are surrounded
by exhaled air volume as described in sub-section 2.2 and hence, it serves as the “ambient
condition” for the droplet. The evaporation mass flux for quasi-steady state condition is
given by
ṁ1 = −4πρv Dv Rs ln(1 + BM )

(13)

ṁ1 = −4πρv αg Rs ln(1 + BT )
Here, ṁ1 is droplet mass loss rate due to evaporation, Rs the instantaneous droplet radius,
ρv is density of water vapor and Dv is the binary diffusivity of water vapor in air, αg is the
thermal diffusivity of surrounding air. BM = (Y1,s −Y1,g )/(1−Y1,s ) and BT = Cp,l (Ts −Tg )/hf g
are the Spalding mass transfer and heat transfer numbers, respectively. Y is mass fraction
with numerical subscripts 1, 2 and 3 denoting water, air and salt respectively. Additionally,
subscript s, g, ∞ denote location at droplet surface, surrounding gas and at very far field
ambient, respectively. hf g and Cp,l are the specific latent heat of vaporization and specific
heat of the droplet liquid, respectively. Unlike in a pure water droplet, vapor pressure at
the surface of droplets with non-volatile dissolved substances as in respiratory droplet/salt
solution droplets could be significantly suppressed. Raoult’s Law provides the modified vapor
pressure at the droplet surface for binary solution, Pvap (Ts , χ1,s ) = χ1,s Psat (Ts ), where χ1,s is
the mole fraction of evaporating solvent (here water) at droplet surface in the liquid phase
12

[33] and χ1,s = 1 − χ3,s . The far field vapor concentration, on the other hand, is related to
the relative humidity of the ambient. Considering the effects of Raoult’s law and relative
humidity, the vapor concentrations at droplet surface and at far field can be expressed as:
Y1,s =

Pvap (Ts , χ1,s )M1
Pvap (Ts , χ1,s )M1 + (1 − Pvap (Ts , χ1,s ))M2

(14)

where M1 , M2 are molecular weights of water and air, respectively. Instantaneous Y1,g is
evaluated from Eq. 12. The latent heat required for evaporation, is provided by the droplet’s
internal energy and/or surrounding ambient. It has been verified that the thermal gradient
in the liquid phase is rather small. Therefore, neglecting the internal thermal gradients Ts
is obtained from the energy balance

where, Ts is instantaneous droplet temperature; m = (4/3)πρl Rs3 and As = 4πRs2 are the

salt (if present) and water and kg is the conductivity of air surrounding the droplet.

to continuous loss of water, the solution would become supersaturated in most occasions
leading to the onset of crystallization. The crystallization kinetics is modeled with a onestep reaction [36, 37]. The validation of the model (1% NaCl-water solution) with saliva
droplet experiments (average of three runs) from a healthy subject is shown in Fig. 3. The
experiments were performed in a contact free condition in an acoustic levitator at T∞ =
28o C and RH∞ = 41%. The reader is referred to ref. [21] for details of the experimental
configuration. Here, a difference of upto 15% could be found for the different stages of droplet
drying, between the model prediction and the saliva droplet drying curve from experiments.
It should be noted that human saliva contains mucus, varieties of salts and electrolytes along
with compositional variations, which are difficult to model very accurately.

droplets to the pandemic dynamics is rarely available. Within the framework of the well
known SIR-model, the model constants proposed by Stilianakis and Drossinos [38] included
overall droplet cloud features like number of droplets per unit volume of the cloud, but did
not include crucial physics like cloud aerodynamics, evaporation or crystallization dynamics
that lead to droplet-nuclei formation. As such these control the time evolution of the droplet
cloud and as shown later the spatio-temporal evolution of the cloud and the constituent
droplets play a major role in determining the critical rate constants of the problem. A
model connecting the macro-scale pandemic dynamics with the micro-scale droplet physics
accounting for droplet-cloud aerodynamics, evaporation and crystallization physics has been
recently presented by Chaudhuri et al. [21]. Drawing inspiration from the well known
molecular collision theory of reactions due to collisions, a chemical reaction mechanism was
obtained where three elementary reactions described the pandemic evolution. Adopting the
notations of the SEIR model, one of the reaction rate constants that determined conversion
14

of a susceptible individual S to an exposed individual E, upon contact with the droplet
cloud D ejected by the infectious person I, was denoted by k1 (or k1,o as opposed to the
new rate constant to be defined here) and was called the infection rate constant. This k1,o
was modeled using the molecular collision theory [39]. From Chaudhuri et al. [21], the
2
expected number of collisions per unit time between S and D of I is given by πσDS
VDS nI nS

resulting in the infection reaction I + S → I + E. nI and nS are the number of infected I
and susceptible S people in unit volume. The infection rate constant of this reaction is then
given by

σDS is the jet/puff diameter, which is also assumed to be the diameter of the droplet cloud.
V~DS is the relative velocity of the droplet cloud D w.r.t. S while τd is the droplet lifetime.
VS can be approximated as the preferred walking speed which according to [40, 41] equals
1.3±0.3m/s, and hence for the current study we will assume VS = 1.3m/s. tc is the average
time period between two expiratory events. tc is calculated as tc = 3600 × 24/Nexp where
Nexp is the average number of infecting expiratory events per person per day. We assumed
Nexp = 3, from the measured coughing frequency of 0-16 in normal subjects [42].
The above expression Eqn. 16 is limited by several simplifying assumptions. In this
paper, we develop a comprehensive model beyond these limitations, which is also rendered
capable of delineating the relative dominance of the different disease transmission pathways.
In particular, in the following we derive a new rate constant accounting for i) the finite viral
loads, finite viral lifetime and the corresponding probability of infection ii) the evolution of
the collision volume with time iii) transmission by droplets of any sizes and the corresponding
dried droplet nuclei and iv) inhomogeneity of infection spreading. Furthermore, in this
paper we generalize the infection rate constant equation to account for transmission by
any expiratory event. To that end, a generalized reaction mechanism that accounts for
different modes of infection transmission as well as different form of expiratory events are
presented. This is followed by a comprehensive modeling of the individual infection rate
constants, following which we arrive at an overall infection rate constant. In view of the above
discussion, the basic reaction mechanism of [21] could be generalized to a comprehensive one
where almost all possible expiratory events and modes of transmission could be included to

In [R1αβ ], α varies over different expiratory events, namely breath, cough, sing, sneeze,
talk, while β varies over different modes of transmission, namely droplet, droplet nucleus,
fomite. Thus [R1αβ ] essentially represents 15 reactions. The rate constants of these individual
reactions are defined in Table 1.

Table 1: Infection rate constants for different expiratory events and modes of transmission

Here, each of the parameters should be obtained for the respective combination of α, β.
Including [R2] and [R3], in total there are 15 + 2 = 17 reactions to be included in a complete
model. As such further granularity could be added by adding a location parameter γ. In
that case we can have k1,αβγ , where γ could represent home, school, office, transport etc.
In this paper, we will only consider two selected transmission modes: cough-droplets and
cough-dried droplet nuclei with the rate constants k1,cd and k1,cn as shown in Table 1. These
are expected to play the more dominant roles in disease transmission. However, the approach
here could be used for any other transmission routes too, with the corresponding droplet size
distribution. For Covid-19 fomites are being considered a secondary source of infection and
needs to be dealt separately.

16

Individual rate constants will allow us to delineate the different modes of transmission
on average. Furthermore, definition of individual rate constants enables quantitative investigation of the relative dominance of each mode of transmission. This constitutes one of the
major goals of the paper. The infection rate constants are generalized by inclusion of the
probability for infection Pαβ , averaging the collision volume over a characteristic time alongside including the dried droplet nuclei mode of transmission, in addition to the droplet mode
of transmission. The revised rate constant for any expiratory event α, vector of transmission
β and location γ is given by Eqn. 17

Note, that we introduced a new parameter ψ(t) to calculate Pαβ which denotes the
fraction of the infectious virion population active within the dried droplet nuclei population at time t. As t →
− ∞, ψ(t) →
− 0. Thus the integration is performed by upto about
max(tevap ) ∼ O(1000s) - the largest evaporation time of the droplet set considered. Details
on the survivability of specific SARS-CoV-2 inside dried droplet nuclei is not known. Hence,
for now we will assume ψ(t) is independent of d and n, except when we will estimate its sensitivity in specific cases. According to the reaction mechanism given by [R1αβ ], [R2], [R3], E
is formed by several parallel pathways. Therefore, the corresponding rate constants become
additive. Hence, the location (γ) dependent infection rate constant can be defined as:

k1,γ =

While the rate constant k1,γ is derived from first principles, it still results in same infection
rate constant for a given set of ambient temperature T∞ , RH∞ and population density.
17

As shown by Lloyd-Smith et al. [43] the individual infectiousness distribution around the
basic reproduction number is highly skewed. This suggests that a small fraction of infected
individuals “superspreaders” are responsible for a large number of infections. Hence, the final
challenge of this modeling effort is to include this effect. Such “superspreading” events could
be results of i) high local population density ntotal,γ , ii) highly mobile infected individuals
and iii) most importantly, high viral loading of the ejected respiratory droplets ρv . We will
see that large viral loading ρv = ρv,max leads to very high infection probability which would
lead to large k1,γ . Since the rate constant is directly proportional to ntotal,γ , its effect is
understandable. Thus, effect resulting from mobility needs to be accounted.
Understanding and modeling human mobility at both individual level as well as at a
population level has garnered recent interest. See a recent review by Barbosa et al.[44] for
a detailed exposition on this topic. Kolbl and Helbing [45] used statistical data of the UK
National Travel Surveys collected for 26 years by the Social Survey Division of the Office
of Population Census and Surveys to arrive at a generalized distribution of human daily
travel behavior. They showed that for different modes of transport i ranging from walking,
cycling, car driving etc., the travel time tt normalized by the average travel time for the
corresponding mode of travel t̄t,i and defined as τt,i = tt /t̄t,i , a common distribution for τt,i ,
irrespective of the mode of transport could be obtained. This was also argued from an energy
point of view, where Ei /Ē = τt,i ; Ē = 615 kJ per person per day - the average travel energy
budget of the human body according to [45]. In any case the pdf, gτt , after dropping the i
given its universality is

g(τt ) = N 0 exp(−α/τt − τt /β).

(21)

The following constants were provided, N = N 0 /Ē = 2.5, α = 0.2, β = 0.7 for the universal
curve [45].
Given two infected people I, it is reasonable to expect that the one with the higher
mobility has more chance to infect others since they have greater exposure to the population
and can infect people at different locations, all other conditions remaining fixed. Therefore,
we can assume that the final infection rate constant should be proportional to τt .
The corresponding infection rate constant summed over all possible types of expiratory
18

event α, transmission mode β and location γ is thus given by
k1,τt = τt

X

k1,αβγ .

(22)

α,β,γ

Clearly k1 is now a function of two random variables τt , ntotal,γ and the extreme individual
realization of each could correspond to the superspreading events.
Finally, the average, overall infection rate constant k1 is given by

k1,αβγ is independent of τt . In the rest of the

paper we will mostly focus on this ensemble averaged rate constant k1 . With the framework

up in future works.
From the reactions [R1αβ ], [R2], [R3] we can obtain the set of ordinary differential equations of the SEIR model, that would govern the evolution of [I], [E], [S], [R] and [X], where
the rates constants appear as respective coefficients. Square brackets denote number of the

Results and Discussion

From the measurements by Duguid [46], the droplet size distribution from cough could be
described using a lognormal distribution. The initial distribution fc and the number of
virions present in each droplet size for the average viral load ρv = 7 × 106 copies/ml is shown
in Fig. 4a. Total number of droplets ejected = 5000 [46]. Figure 4b shows the time evolution
of the droplet number distribution as a function of the instantaneous diameter Ds . The shift

maximum viral load ρv = 7×106 and ρv = 2.35×109 copies/ml of SARS-CoV-2, respectively
are assumed from [18]. (b) Droplet and/or dried droplet nuclei size distributions at different
time t and distance XD from the origin of the respiratory jet, for T∞ = 21.44o C, RH∞ = 50%.
The curves at the last three time instants end abruptly due to loss of droplets due to settling
beyond that particular diameter. For t > τd = 22.87s or XD > 3.52m all airborne droplets
have been desiccated to the corresponding droplet nuclei. Size distribution remains invariant
for t > τd .
of the distribution to the left i.e. towards smaller Ds is an effect of evaporation. Also, the
right branch of the number distribution gets eroded due to settling of the larger droplets.
At the conditions of interest: T∞ = 21.44o C and RH∞ = 50% the modal diameter of the
droplet nuclei is 2.3µm at t = 1050s starting from an initial modal diameter of 13.9µm
at t = 0s. Note that here, by modal diameter, the Ds corresponding to the peak of the
histogram shown in Fig. 4b is referred. Interestingly, since small droplets evaporate fast,
the left branch (small sizes) of the distribution shifts fast to further smaller sizes. A droplet
with initial diameter Ds,0 = 10µm is reduced to Ds = 1.96µm within t = 0.42s. As such,
for the entire droplet set, a modal diameter of 2.7µm which is within 22% of the final modal
diameter, is achieved within t = 1s or within a distance of XD = 1.8m from the origin of

20

the respiratory jet. XD denotes the distance of the center of the respiratory jet/puff (with a
diameter of σD ) from its origin. Within t = 10.6s, XD = 2.88m, the droplet size distribution
is very close to the final distribution. Due to this sharp reduction in droplet size due to
evaporation (for RH∞ < 85%) combined with settling of large droplets, practically, for
most of the time, the disease appears to be transmitted by droplets/nuclei of instantaneous
diameter less than 10µm, the most probable instantaneous diameter being between 2.14µm
and 2.7µm. However, it is to be noted that this diameter could be 5-6 times smaller than
the initial ejected diameter of the droplet Ds,0 . In a viewpoint article Fennelly [47] reported
that for most respiratory infections, the smaller droplets (< 5µm and collected at a finite
distance from the origin of the respiratory spray) were found to be pathogenic. Furthermore
Chia et al. [48] reported PCR positive SARS-CoV-2 particles with sizes > 4µm and also
between 1 − 4µm from air samples collected. Thus, our results appear to be consistent with
these clinical research findings.

minutes.
Next, we analyze the time varying infection probability. Interestingly in Fig. 5a, at
T∞ = 21.44o C, RH∞ = 50% for t > 1s the total probability of infection scales as Pc ∼ t−2/3 ,
for droplets and dried droplet nuclei. This is a combined effect of droplet evaporation, virus
decay and dilution due to entrainment of fresh air within the jet/puff, the diameter of which
increases initially as t1/2 and then as t1/4 , respectively. After the droplets evaporate, the
decay of the infection probability for the dried droplet nuclei slows down with respect to
their droplet predecessors. This is because, while the infection probability decay for droplets
is due to evaporation, settling and dilution, the probability decay due to nuclei is due to only
dilution and finite virus lifetime. Here, we are considering a very large, poorly ventilated
indoor space with a large number of occupants as in a shopping mall or in a conference center.
It is to be noted that the dilution effect is arrived with the assumption that all people are in
motion but their motion do not affect the cloud aerodynamics. In reality, such motion will
lead to increased turbulence and mixing, resulting in further dilution. Therefore, the decay
of the probability of infection will be faster than t−2/3 in reality. Another interesting feature

is that the Pcn does not continuously follow the Pcd after all the droplets evaporate. There
is an accumulation of the droplet nuclei due to evaporation of smaller droplets beforehand
leading to a small jump in Pcn at τd . Indeed the overall probability Pc by Eqn. 6 decreases
without any discontinuity. From Fig. 5b we find that for XD > 2m the overall probability
−3
decreases as XD
justifying the necessity of social distancing. However, Pc < 0.01 only after

about 5m.
The effect of preventing ejection of droplets beyond particular initial sizes, on Pcd is
examined in Fig. 6a, 6b as a function of time and distance. For Ds,0,cutof f = 50µm an
infection probability of 0.6 is obtained for t → 0 suggesting droplets with Ds,0 < 50µm is
slightly more responsible for infection, at all times, for the conditions under consideration,
than their Ds,0 > 50µm counterparts. This trend continues until τd when all airborne droplets
evaporate. This is qualitatively consistent with the exposure analysis and results of Chen et
al. [49] who considered dispersion and evaporation of water droplets with size distribution
from Duguid [46]. However, when Ds,0,cutof f = 10µm, the corresponding probability of
infection is very small, suggesting that for the average viral loading, at early times the

23

droplets of initial diameter 10µm < Ds,0 < 50µm are the most lethal in terms of their
probability to infect. However, while they infect their diameters are substantially smaller.
The Pcβ at T∞ = 10o C, RH∞ = 20% is shown in Fig. 7a, 7b as a function of time
and distance. In comparison to the previous case, here, the droplet survives longer due
to lower temperature while droplet-nuclei induces higher Pcn due to longer virus half-life.
Thus at lower temperature, higher infection probability could be expected. However, in
both cases, at short time and distance from the expiratory event, droplets (both small and
large) dominate transmission and only after most droplets evaporate, the dried droplet nuclei
route is significantly activated. While the transmission probability by dried droplet nuclei are
always lower than by droplets, their lifetime is theoretically infinite as opposed to the finite
lifetime τd of the droplets. Hence, despite their low instantaneous probability of infection,
cumulatively they contribute significantly, assuming that the virus remain infectious for
significant times within the dried droplet nuclei. If so, as will be shown below, the persistent
dried droplet nuclei appears to be a major transmission mode of the virus. It is to be
recognized that these results were obtained with average viral loading ρv = 7×106 copies/ml.
If we consider the ρv,max = 2.35 × 109 copies/ml, Pcβ does not decay from the maximum
fixed value of 1 until from about 100s or from 5m from the origin of the respiratory jet,
along the center of the jet. Thus it is expected that such kind of viral loading could infect
a large number of S potentially leading to a superspreading event.
Using the Pαβ (t) thus obtained, we can evaluate the corresponding rate constants for
d and n using Eqn. 18 and Eqn. 19, respectively. These rate constants for ρv = 7 × 106
copies/ml are presented in Table 2 for four Cases IA, IB, IC and II. Cases I(A-C) corresponds
to T∞ = 21.44o C, RH∞ = 50% while Case II represents T∞ = 10o C, RH∞ = 20%. Population density in both cases is assumed to be 10000 people/km2 . In all cases, homogeneous
mixing is assumed without any social distancing or lockdown. In all cases k1,cnγ > k1,cdγ .
Case IA represents no restriction and clearly high rate constant values are attained in this
case. Case IB represents a hypothetical situation where the ejection of all droplets with
Ds,0 > 10µm is restricted. This is hypothetically possible by stringent enforcement of population wide usage of ordinary face-masks without any exceptions. Furthermore, using k1,α
and k3 we can define the basic reproduction number R0,α = k1,α /(0.97k3 ). The calculated
24

k1,cβ and R0,c could be found in Table 2. A very interesting R0,c trend emerges between
Case IA and IB. We find that if ejection of droplets even beyond 10µm could be completely
prevented, the R0,c drops from 4.22 (0.33, 5.63) for Case IA to 0.048 for Case IB. For Case
1A, the numbers in the brackets denote the R0,c for lower limit tn 1 = 0.01td 1 and upper
2

2

limit tn 1 = 100td 1 , respectively. The R0,c between Case 1A and 1B represent two order of
2

2

magnitude difference and for the R0,c at Case IB, no outbreak is possible. The bifurcation
point R0,c ≈ 1 is attained for the critical droplet size Ds,0 = 27µm. This is shown in Table
2 as Case IC. The implication is that preventing ejection of droplets with initial size beyond
27µm would just prevent the outbreak. Of course, it is to be recognized that we are only
considering cough as the mode of droplet ejection alongside many idealizing assumptions.
Furthermore, these results were arrived at with the average viral load ρv = 7×106 copies/ml.
If we consider the maximum reported viral load ρv,max = 2.35 × 109 copies/ml with free mixing among I and S, the R0,c = 634.12 (16.32, 869.28), indicating a superspreading event. As
such, it could be a combination of high mobility and large viral loading of I - that could
lead to a super-spreader.
R0,c calculated at the average and maximum viral loading ρv = 7 × 106 copies/ml
and ρv,max = 2.35 × 109 copies/ml, respectively, for different droplet size cutoffs at T∞ =
21.44o C, RH∞ = 50% is shown in Fig. 8. The cutoff Ds,0 means all droplets with sizes
Ds,0 > Ds,0,cutof f are prevented from ejecting. This figure also shows the sensitivity of the
assumption tn 1 = td 1 = t 1 on the results. In Fig. 8, the lower and upper limits represent
2

2

2

the conditions tn 1 = 0.01td 1 and tn 1 = 100td 1 , respectively. If all droplets are allowed to
2

2

2

2

be ejected at average viral loading, for tn 1 = 0.01td 1 , R0,c = 0.33 while for tn 1 = 100td 1 ,
2

2

2

2

R0,c = 5.63 with the base R0,c = 4.22 for the typical indoor conditions assumed above.
Clearly, change in the lower limit of tn 1 is much more sensitive than its upper limit. This
2

is because even if the viral lifetime is much longer, dilution reduces infection probability.
However, with ρv,max = 2.35 × 109 copies/ml for tn 1 = 0.01td 1 , R0,c = 16.32 while for
2

2

tn 1 = 100td 1 , R0,c = 869.28 around the base case of R0,c = 634.12 all other conditions
2

2

remaining same. Interestingly, with a Ds,0,cutof f = 10µm the R0,c reduces by a factor of 40
w.r.t. no cutoff condition. However, Ds,0,cutof f = 5µm reduces the R0,c by another factor
of 18 w.r.t. Ds,0,cutof f = 10µm condition. for the base cases. At this condition R0,c < 1.

For both viral loading, the maximum and the averaged, blocking droplets Ds,0 ≥ 5µm can
theoretically yield a R0,c ≤ 1. All the results so far, have been obtained with rv = 0.5
which implies a minimum infectious dose of 10 virions. Figures 9(a) and (b) shows the corresponding R0,c for rv = 0.05 and rv = 0.005, respectively. These imply minimum infectious
doses of 100 and 1000 virions respectively. While the qualitative trend is similar, indeed the
R0,c for these two cases are much lower in comparison to rv = 0.5. As such it seems likely
that the minimum infectious dose of SARS-Cov-2 is O(10). While the base R0,c = 4.22 for

for Covid-19 [50], the order of magnitude larger values of R0,c obtained at maximum viral
loading should be viewed in context of superspreading events.
Using the governing Eqns. 24 the evolution of the pandemic for average viral loading and
rv = 0.5, for Case IA is presented in Fig. 10a. The growth rate of the infected population
for Case IA and Case IB is shown in Fig. 10b with the assumption that usage of face masks
for the entire I population (which would practically be required for the entire population)
is implemented after a fixed time from the onset of the outbreak. As expected, in this SEIR
model with ab initio infection rate constants, the effect of the usage of masks is almost
immediate since the assumed latency period is only 1 day. Leffler et al. [51] analyzed
Covid-19 data from 198 countries to conclude that government policies on mask wearing
significantly reduced mortality. A significant feature of the results of this paper is that, while

27

they are computed mechanistically from first principles with assumptions and limitations,
they produce physically meaningful outcomes.

Conclusions

We have analyzed the relative significance of the different transmission modes of SARSCoV-2, using first principle calculations. Starting with a well known cough droplet size
distribution, we derived the time dependent probability of infection by different routes accounting for viral load, virus stability, respiratory droplet cloud aerodynamics, evaporation
and crystallization for poorly ventilated conditions. Most number of droplets have an initial
diameter of Ds,0 = 13.9µm, but within 1s of their ejection, most number of droplets of the
same set gets reduced to a diameter of 2.7µm due to evaporation, accounting for the thermodynamic state of the exhaled air. For the average viral loading, at early times, the droplets
of initial diameter 10µm < Ds,0 < 50µm are the most lethal in terms of their probability
to infect. However, while they infect, their diameters could be 5 − 6 times smaller. Indeed
for most of the time, infection is spread by inhalation of small, airborne droplets or their
desiccated nuclei. While the instantaneous probability of infection by droplets is significantly larger than its dried nuclei in the short time and range, the much longer persistence
of the dried nuclei results in its stronger relative contribution to the infection rate constant,
under the assumption that the virus half-life is independent of the phase of its vector. The
infection rate constant is derived ab initio by calculating collision frequency between the
droplets/nuclei cloud and the susceptible population for different ambient conditions including the probability of infection. The SEIR model output obtained with the calculated rate
constants for average viral loading, for the specific conditions of interest, show that preventing ejection of droplets with initial diameter greater than 10µm can potentially prevent
further outbreaks even for a minimum infectious dose of 10 virions. The critical droplet
diameter, preventing ejection of droplets above which would result in R0,c ≈ 1 is found to be
27µm. For maximum viral loading, the critical droplet diameter is 5µm to just prevent the
outbreaks. Furthermore, strong sensitivity of R0,c on variation of virus half-life at different
phases of the droplet/aerosol, as well as the minimum infectious dose is demonstrated.
