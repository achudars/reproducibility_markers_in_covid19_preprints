ABSTRACT
The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a worldwide public
health crisis. When the SARS-CoV-2 enters the biological fluids in the human body,
different types of biomolecules (in particular proteins) may adsorb on its surface and
alter its infection ability. Although great efforts have recently been devoted to the
interaction of the specific antibodies with the SARS-CoV-2, it still remains largely
unknown how the other serum proteins affect the infection of the SARS-CoV-2. In this
work, we systematically investigate the interaction of serum proteins with the SARSCoV-2 RBD by the molecular docking and the all-atom molecular dynamics
simulations. It is found that the non-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) indeed cannot
effectively bind to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD while the human serum albumin (HSA) may
have some potential of blocking its infection (to ACE2). More importantly, we find that
the RBD can cause the significant structural change of the Apolipoprotein E (ApoE),
by which SARS-CoV-2 may hijack the metabolic pathway of the ApoE to facilitate its
cell entry. The present study enhances the understanding of the role of protein corona
in the bio-behaviors of SARS-CoV-2, which may aid the more precise and personalized
treatment for COVID-19 infection in the clinic.

1. Introduction
The outbreak of COVID-19 disease that is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 has led to
more than 102.0 million infections and over 2.2 million deaths in the whole world by
Jan

31,

2021

(https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-

2019/situation-reports/). The spike protein on the viral membrane is the key antigen of
SARS-CoV-2, where the receptor binding domains (RBDs) located on the S1 domain
of the spike protein can facilitate viral entry via interaction with angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2)[1-3].
Due to its crucial role in viral infection, SARS-CoV-2 RBD has become one of the
most likely targets for the development of drugs/inhibitors, neutralizing antibodies, and
vaccines[4-15]. For example, Panda et al.[4] found that an antiviral inhibitor showed
enhanced binding affinity to the RBD, where the postfusion conformation of the
trimeric S protein RBD with ACE2 revealed conformational changes associated with
PC786 drug binding. Moreover, the antibodies that targeting the RBD of the spike
glycoprotein are believed to be a more promising method of treating COVID-2019. Yan
et al.[5] isolated two specific human monoclonal antibodies (i.e., CA1 and CB6) from a
convalescent COVID-19 patient, and demonstrated potent SARS-CoV-2-specific
neutralization activity in vitro against SARS-CoV-2. More recently, Barnes et al.[6]
made a more comprehensive study on the neutralization antibodies, where they solved
eight new structures of distinct COVID-19 human neutralizing antibodies in complex
with the SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer or RBD and more importantly classified these
antibodies into categories based on the binding modes.
Actually, in the human body, there are many types of antibodies (i.e.,
immunoglobulins, Igs) that identify and neutralize foreign objects such as pathogenic
bacteria and viruses although these intrinsic antibodies are not specific for the SARSCoV-2. Apart from the Igs, there are many types of serum proteins in the blood. For

example, the human serum albumin (HSA) is the most abundant protein in human blood
plasma and constitutes about half of the blood serum protein[16]. Apolipoproteins
(mainly consisting of ApoA, ApoB, and ApoE) can bind lipids and transport them in
blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and lymph[17]. When the foreigner objects/particles enter into
the human body, these serums proteins could quickly adsorb on the foreign particle
surface, and form the protein corona, which have been proved to significantly affect the
bio-behaviors of the particles[18-25].
Since the size of the virus is in the nanometers, the serum protein may also adsorb
on the viral surface and in turn affect its bio-behaviors[26-28]. For example, Ezzat et al.[28]
demonstrated respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) accumulated by a rich protein corona in the biological fluids, and this protein corona
could affect the viral infectivity and immune cell activation.
In this work, with the aim of clarifying the role of protein corona in SARS-CoV-2
infection, we systematically investigate the interaction of three typical serum proteins
(i.e., IgM, HSA, and ApoE) with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD by combining the molecular
docking, the all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, and the binding energy
calculation. Our results show that the HSA proteins could adsorb onto the RBD and
hide the antigen site of the RBD while the non-specific IgM cannot. More importantly,
the binding to RBD can cause the obviously structural change of the ApoE, which may
activate the metabolic pathway of the ApoE and facilitate the SARS-CoV-2 entry into
specific cells.

serum albumin, and (d) Apolipoprotein E.

2.1 The structure of the serum proteins and SARS-CoV-2 RBD
As shown in Figure 1, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (PDB ID: 6M0J)[29] and three different
serum proteins, namely IgM (PDB ID: 1DEE)[30], HSA (PDB ID: 4K71)[31], and ApoE
(PDB ID: 2L7B)[32], were considered here. The RBD is the main functional region of
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interacting with ACE2, especially the receptor binding
motif (RBM), which contains almost all the key residues related to the binding between
SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2. The IgM is a heterodimeric protein composed of two heavy
chains and two light chains, which comprises two Fab fragments and one single Fc
fragment[33]. Since the two Fab fragments are the same and the Fc fragment usually
does not bind to the antigen, here for the sake of simplicity, we just considered one Fab
segment of IgM. The HSA is a helical protein with turns and extended loops, and
resembles a heart shape. It consists of three domains, I (residues 1–195), II (196–383),
and III (384–585)[34]. The ApoE is folded into two separate domains with N-terminal
(residues 1 to 191) containing an anti-parallel four-helix bundle and C-terminal
(residues 192 to 299) forming a separately folded domain that interacts with the fourhelix bundle[35].

2.2 Molecular docking
The complex structures between the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and the serum proteins were
first predicted by the hybrid protein-protein docking approach, HDOCK[36-38]. Since the
SARS-CoV-2 RBD and IgM-Fab were part of the spike protein and IgM protein,
respectively, the residues that may be shielded by the other part of the proteins were
excluded in the docking process. For each complex, the HDOCK algorithm can predict
100 binding conformations that were sorted according to the binding docking scores.
However, previous studies[39-41] indicated that the performance of the docking scores
on the ranking ability was just moderate and even very poor in some cases; while the
binding energy calculated by the molecular mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area
(MM/PBSA) could perform much better. Thus, after the molecular docking, we then
calculated the binding energy for the top 30 conformations (predicted by the HDOCK)
with the MM/PBSA method. Finally, we selected three typical structures for each
complex based on the binding energy and the cluster analysis as the initial
conformations for the following MD simulation.

2.3 All-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation.
The all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed based on the
above selected structures. All the MD simulations were carried by using GROMACS
2019.03 package[42] with Amber ff14sb force field[43]. Each complex was solvated with
TIP3P water[44], with the LINCS algorithm to constraint all bonds involving hydrogen
atoms[45]. The NaCl was used to neutralize system, and the concentration was set at
0.15M. The distances between the surfaces of the box and the complex atoms were set
to ≥15Å. The initial system was firstly energy-minimized twice by the steepest descent
method before and after filling the water until the convergence was reached. Then each
system was subjected to a 500 ps pre-equilibration process in the NVT and NPT
ensemble, separately, with all the heavy atoms of proteins harmonically constrained by
1000 kJ*mol-1*nm-2. The temperature was controlled at 310 K by the V-rescale

thermostat with a time constant of 0.2 ps and the pressure was kept at 1 atm by the
Parrinello-Rahman barostat with a time constant of 2.0 ps. Finally, 100 ns free NPT
simulations were performed for each system. In the simulations, the particle mesh
Ewald (PME) algorithm was used when calculating the long-range electrostatic
interactions[46], and the Lennard-Jones (LJ) interactions were cut off at a distance of 1.0
nm. The periodic boundary conditions were adopted in all three directions.

2.4 Binding energy calculation.
In the binding energy calculation, every interval of 100 ps was sampled in the last 10
ns, namely 100 frames in each system were used to calculate the binding energy via the
MM/PBSA method[47-50]. All the MM/PBSA calculations were performed by using the
modified shell script gmx_mmpbsa (https://jerkwin.github.io/gmxtool). The typical

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Interaction of Immunoglobulin M (IgM) with SARS-CoV-2 RBD
We first investigated the interaction between the non-specific IgM and SARS-CoV2 RBD, where three different binding modes were observed (Figure 2 and Figure S1).
Model-1 was the typical neutralization mode that the IgM bound to the RBD with its
antigen-binding site (i.e., the variable regions in the light chain and the heavy chain).
Model-2 was another neutralization mode, but the binding site in RBD was changed.
As shown in Figure 2d, the binding energy in the two models was about -20 kcal/mol
and -30 kcal/mol, respectively, which was much weaker than the binding energy of the
specific antibody to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (e.g., CB6~-37 kcal/mol, CR3022~-34
kcal/mol)[50].We also observed an unusual binding mode namely model-3, where the
RBD was mainly bound to the junction between the constant region and the variable
region of the heavy chain. Due to the hollow structure of the junction, the contact
surface area (CSA) between the RBD and the IgM was much larger than that in previous

two models (Figure 2f). Nevertheless, there were many polar residues at the binding
site (Figure S1e), leading to a high solvation energy, thus the binding energy was also
weak (~-22 kcal/mol) in this case.

Figure 2. Interaction of IgM with SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Final snapshots illustrating the
three typical modes in the IgM-RBD interaction (a-c) and corresponding binding
energies (d), energy decomposition of the binding energy (e), the number of hydrogen
bonds and contact surface areas (f) between the IgM and RBD in the three modes. The
contact surface area (CSA) is denoted as: CSA=(SASAIgM + SASARBD – SASAcom)/2,
where SASA stands for the solvent accessible surface area and the footnote ‘com’
indicate the complex of the IgM and RBD.

Due to the binding of IgM, the epitope in RBD (that binds to ACE2) might be
occupied. To quantitatively depict the effect of the IgM binding on the epitope in RBD,
we analyzed the buried surface area (BSA)[51] and ΔRMSF[52] of the residues in the
epitope (that play important roles in ACE2-RBD interactions). As shown in Figure 3a,
the BSA of most residues was positive, namely the solvent accessible surface area
(SASA) of the key residues in the epitope became smaller in model-1 and model-3.
Moreover, Figure 3b shows that most of ΔRMSF was negative in these two models,
meaning that the flexibility of the key residues was reduced and the activity of these
residues was weakened. The above results indicated that the epitope was indeed
occupied by the IgM in model-1 and model-3. While in model-2, both of the BSA and

the ΔRMSF changed very little, indicating that the epitope was not affected by the
binding of IgM. Although the IgM did not directly block the ACE2-RBD interaction
(similar to the antibody CR3022 reported by Wilson and coworkers)[53], it may also
have great impact on the infection of the SARS-CoV-2 (e.g., the clash with the Nterminal domain or the S2 domain may affect the conformation change of the spike
protein). Therefore, model-2 may be another useful neutralization model. However, the
IgM here was not the specific antibody for SARS-CoV-2 and the binding energy was
weak. Thus, the neutralization of the non-specific IgM to RBD was limited although
different neutralization modes were observed here.

Figure 3. The buried surface area (BSA) (a) and the root mean square fluctuation
(RMSF) difference parameter RMSF (b) of the epitope site of RBD in the three models.
BSA=SASAfree – SASAbinding, RMSF=(RMSFbinding – RMSFfree)/RMSFfree, where the
footnote ‘binding’ and ‘free’ indicate the binding state and the free state, respectively.
A positive value of BSA indicates that the residue is hidden, while a negative value
indicates that the residue becomes exposed after the binding. A positive value of
RMSF indicates an increase in the flexibility of residues, while a negative value
indicates a decrease in the flexibility.

3.2 Interaction of Human serum albumin (HSA) with SARS-CoV-2 RBD
Human serum albumin (HSA) is the most abundant protein in human blood plasma
and constitutes over half of the blood serum protein. The adsorption of HSA on the
foreign objects can also lead to the immune response[21, 54]. For example, Schöttler et
al.[21] found that the pre-adsorption of HSA on the nanoparticle surface can greatly

increase the macrophage uptake.
Here, for the purpose of determining the ‘neutralization’ ability of HSA, we also
investigated the binding of the HSA to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Figure 4 and Figure S2).
As discussed above, HSA contains three homologous helical domains (i.e., DI, DII, and
DIII) and each splits into A and B subdomains. Due to the heart-shaped structure of
HSA, there was large space for other molecules binding at the junction of the three
domains. In this case, we also observed three different modes (see Figure 4a-c), where
RBD was bound to the DI-DII junction (model-1), DI-DIII junction (model-2), and DIDII-DIII junction (model-3), respectively. More importantly, the binding energy was
much stronger than that in the case of IgM, and was even stronger than that of RBDACE2 (-34 kcal/mol) in the first two models[50]. Figure 4e shows that both of the
electrostatic energy and the VDW energy played important roles in the interactions.
Besides, as illustrated in Figure S2c-d, there were a lot of hydrophobic contacts in
model-1 and model-2, which collectively led to the strong binding energy here.

Figure 4. Interaction of HSA with SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Final snapshots illustrating the
three typical modes in the HSA-RBD interaction (a-c) and corresponding binding
energies (d), energy decomposition of the binding energy (e), and the hydrogen bonds
and contact surface areas (f) between the HSA and RBD in the three modes.

We further investigated the effect of the HSA binding on the epitope in RBD. As

shown in Figure 5a, the BSA of the key residues in the epitope was almost positive in
model-1 and model-2, indicating that the epitope was largely occupied in these two
models. Moreover, Figure 5b shows that nearly all ΔRMSF was negative in model-1,
thus the flexibility of the RBD was also weakened; while half of the ΔRMSF was
positive and the remaining was negative, thus the whole flexibility of the RBD was not
affected in model-2. Considering that the binding energy was great in the two models,
the HSA seems to have the potential of effectively neutralizing the RBD, particularly
in model-1.
However, as we know, the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE)[55, 56], in which
the binding of a virus to the antibodies enhances its entry into host cells, is a potential
risk to the vaccines or the antibody-based interventions and should be seriously
considered. In this case, we also investigated the effect of the RBD binding on the active
site of HSA (the FcRn receptor may recognize the site and metabolize the HSA[31, 57]).
The BSA of some key resides in HSA was positive in model-1 and that of most residues
was positive in model-2, indicating that the active sites may be occupied by the RBD.
Moreover, the flexibility of the sites was greatly reduced in model-1 and model-2, thus
the activity of these residues was weakened in both models. In general, there should not
be the obvious ‘ADE’ of HSA, but its potential neutralization ability and safe use still
need to be well evaluated in the experiment and particularly in the clinic trails.

3.3 Interaction of Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) with SARS-CoV-2 RBD
Apolipoprotein is another important protein in the serum, which can bind to the lipids
and interact with the lipoprotein receptors in the cell for the uptake and clearance of the
lipids. In this case, we took the ApoE (that plays an important role in the transportation
of cholesterol) as an example, and investigated its interaction with SARS-CoV-2 RBD
(Figure 6 and Figure S3).
Similar to previous cases, three typical modes were also observed in the interactions
(Figure 6a-c), where the RBD was mainly bound to the CT domain of ApoE with the
RBM region (model-1), the junction between the CT domain and NT domain without
(model-2) or with the RBM region (model-3). In particular, the lipid binding site in the
CT domain of ApoE was occupied by the RBD in model-3 (Figure 6c). From the point
view of the binding energy, the first two models were not stable since the binding energy
was about -20 kcal/mol and -26 kcal/mol, and much weaker than the ACE2-RBD
interaction. On the contrary, the binding energy in model-3 (~-34 kcal/mol) was much
larger than that in the first two models, and comparable to that of ACE2-RBD
interaction[50], which could be the result of more hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic
contacts (Figure S3c-e). Notably, although the electrostatic energy and VDW energy

were strong, the larger PB energy (probably due to a great number of polar residues at
the binding site) led to the weak total binding energy in model-2.

Figure 6. Interaction of ApoE with SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Initial snapshots illustrating the
three typical modes in the ApoE-RBD interaction (a-c) and corresponding binding
energies (d), energy decomposition of the binding energy (e), and the hydrogen bonds
and contact surface areas (f) between the ApoE and RBD in the three modes. The lipid
binding sites in CT domain are highlighted with the green dashed line.

We then investigated the effect of the ApoE binding on the epitope in RBD. As the
ApoE was bound to the RBD with the RBM region in model-1 and model-3, the epitope
would be greatly affected. As shown in Figure S4, the BSA for some key residues was
highly positive in model-1 and model-3, while that was nearly zero in model-2. More
importantly, most of ΔRMSF in model-3 was below zero, indicating that the flexibility
of the epitope in RBD was great reduced. Notably, most of ΔRMSF in model-1 was
positive, namely the activity of the epitope was enhanced due to the adsorption of ApoE.
Since the binding energy was weak in model-1, such enhancement may further promote
the substitution of ACE2 for ApoE (to SARS-CoV-2), which was very harmful. On the
contrary, the ApoE was stably bound to the RBD, and blocked the epitope of the RBD
effectively in model-3. In this sense, the model-3 may be a possible ‘neutralization’
mode of ApoE, but was the model-3 indeed useful for inhibiting the infection of SARSCoV-2?

To answer this question, we further investigated the effect of the RBD binding on the
active site of ApoE. As stated above, the ApoE was composed of two domains (i.e., NT
domain and CT domain), where the active sites (residues 136-150)[58, 59] that can interact
with the low-density-lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) on the cell (e.g., hepatocytes) were
located on the NT domain, and the lipid binding sites (residues 260-299)[60] were
located on the CT domain. In the absence of lipids, the active sites were buried by the
other residues in ApoE. When the lipids were bound to the CT domain, the secondary
structure of the NT domain was affected, which induced the exposure of the active sites.
As a result, the cell could recognize the ApoE via the LDLR and internalize the
adsorbed lipids along with the ApoE.
Similarly, Figure 7a shows that the BSA of the key residues in ApoE was great
reduced in model-3, indicating that the active site became more exposed after its
binding to RBD. Moreover, Figure 7b also shows that ΔRMSF was positive in model3, indicating that the activity of the key resides was increased. As illustrated in Figure
7c-d, the binding to RBD indeed caused the change of secondary structure of ApoE,
leading to a 15% loss of the helix in the CT domain of ApoE (Figure 7e-f). Thus, the
SASA of the active site was great increased (compared to that in the free state) and
became partially open. Generally, the above results collectively demonstrated that
SARS-CoV-2 can induce the exposure and in turn activate the binding site of ApoE (to
LDLR). In general, although the binding of ApoE could block the RBD-ACE2
interaction, the SARS-CoV-2 may enter the cell via activating the metabolic pathway
of ApoE (instead of ACE2 pathway). Interestingly, Zhong et al.[61] recently found that
the S1 subunit of SARS-2-S can bind to cholesterol and possibly to high-density
lipoprotein (HDL) components to enhance viral uptake in vitro, and the HDL scavenger
receptor B type 1 (SR-B1) facilitated ACE2-dependent entry of SARS-CoV-2.
Moreover, we also noted a latest clinic data[62], where it was found that the level of lowdensity lipoprotein (LDL, including ApoE and ApoB) may be an indicator of the post
treatment and the obvious decrease of LDL level was observed during the infection.
Thus, our simulation results seemed to give a clear support on the above phenomena at
the molecular level, which may shed light on the role of lipoproteins in the SARS-CoV-

2 infection.

4. Conclusion
In summary, we have investigated the interactions of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD with
three typical serum proteins. It is found that the non-specific IgM cannot effectively
block the SARS-CoV-2-ACE2 interaction since its binding affinity with RBD is very
weak. On the contrary, although HSA is not a specific ‘antibody’, it can bind to the
SARS-CoV-2 RBD firmly due to its large space in the region junctions. More
importantly, we found that the binding of SARS-CoV-2 RBD onto the ApoE can cause

the exposure of the active site in ApoE; thereby the SARS-CoV-2 may enter the cell via
the metabolic pathway of ApoE. In general, the present study clarifies the role of protein
corona in the bio-behaviors of SARS-CoV-2 at the molecular level, and may shed some
light on the development of the therapeutics against the COVID-19 disease in real
applications.
