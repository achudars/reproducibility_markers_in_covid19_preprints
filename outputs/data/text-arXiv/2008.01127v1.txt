Abstract. Social-distancing to combat the COVID-19 pandemic has led to widespread reductions in air pollutant emissions.
Quantifying these changes requires a business as usual counterfactual that accounts for the synoptic and seasonal variability
of air pollutants. We use a machine learning algorithm driven by information from the NASA GEOS-CF model to assess
changes in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3) at 5,756 observation sites in 46 countries from January through June 2020.
Reductions in NO2 correlate with timing and intensity of COVID-19 restrictions, ranging from 60% in severely affected
cities (e.g., Wuhan, Milan) to little change (e.g., Rio de Janeiro, Taipei). On average, NO2 concentrations were 18% lower
than business as usual from February 2020 onward. China experienced the earliest and steepest decline, but concentrations
since April have mostly recovered and remained within 5% to the business as usual estimate. NO2 reductions in Europe and
the US have been more gradual with a halting recovery starting in late March. We estimate that the global NOx (NO+NO2)
emission reduction during the first 6 months of 2020 amounted to 2.9 TgN, equivalent to 5.1% of the annual anthropogenic
total. The response of surface O3 is complicated by competing influences of non-linear atmospheric chemistry. While surface
O3 increased by up to 50% in some locations, we find the overall net impact on daily average O3 between February - June
2020 to be small. However, our analysis indicates a flattening of the O3 diurnal cycle with an increase in night time ozone
due to reduced titration and a decrease in daytime ozone, reflecting a reduction in photochemical production.
The O3 response is dependent on season, time scale, and environment, with declines in surface O3 forecasted if NOx emission
reductions continue.

1 Introduction
The stay-at-home orders imposed in many countries during the Northern Hemisphere spring of 2020 to slow the spread of
the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, hereafter COVID-19), led to a sharp decline in human
activities across the globe (Le Quéré et al., 2020). The associated decrease in industrial production, energy consumption, and
transportation resulted in a reduction in the emissions of air pollutants, notably nitrogen dioxide (NO2) (Liu et al., 2020a;
Dantas et al., 2020; Petetin et al., 2020; Tobias et al., 2020; Le et al., 2020). Nitrogen oxides (NOx=NO+NO2) have a short
atmospheric lifetime and are predominantly emitted during the combustion of fossil fuel for industry, transport and domestic
activities (Streets et al., 2013, Duncan et al., 2016). Atmospheric NO2 concentrations thus readily respond to local changes in
NOx emissions (Lamsal et al., 2011). While this may provide both air quality and climate benefits, a quantitative assessment
of the magnitude of these impacts is complicated by the natural variability of air pollution due to variations in synoptic
conditions (weather), seasonal effects, and long-term emission trends as well as the non-linear responses between emissions
and concentrations. Thus, simply comparing the concentration of pollutants during the COVID-19 period to those
immediately before or to the same period in previous years is not sufficient to indicate causality. An emerging approach to
address this problem is to develop machine-learning based ‘weather-normalization’ algorithms to establish the relationship
between local meteorology and air pollutant surface concentrations (Grange et al., 2018; Grange and Carslaw, 2019; Petetin
et al., 2020). By removing the meteorological influence, these studies have tried to better quantify emission changes as a
result of a perturbation.
Here we adapt this weather-normalization approach to not only include meteorological information but also compositional
information in the form of the concentrations and emissions of chemical constituents. Using a collection of surface
observations of NO2 and ozone (O3) from across the world from 2018 to present (Section 2.1), we develop a ‘bias-correction’
methodology for the NASA global atmospheric composition model GEOS-CF (Section 2.2) which corrects the model output
at each observational site based on the observations for 2018 and 2019 (Section 2.3). These biases reflect errors in emission
estimates, sub-gridscale local influences (representational error), or meteorology and chemistry. Since the GEOS-CF model
makes no adjustments to the anthropogenic emissions in 2020, and no 2020 observations are included in the training of the
bias corrector, the bias-corrected model (hereafter BCM) predictions for 2020 represents a business as usual scenario at each
observation site that can be compared against the actual observations. This allows the impact of COVID-19 containment
measures on air quality to be explored, taking into account meteorology and the long-range transport of pollutants. We first
apply this to the concentration of NO2 (Section 3.1), and then O3 (Section 3.2) and explore the differences between the
counterfactual prediction and the observed concentrations. In Section 3.3 we explore how the observed changes in the NO2
concentrations relate to emission of NOx. Finally, in Section 4 we discuss our conclusions and speculate what the COVID-19
restrictions might mean for the second half of 2020.

2 Methods
2.1 Observations
Our analysis builds on the recent development of unprecedented public access to air pollution model output and air quality
observations in near real-time. We compile an air quality dataset of hourly surface observations for a total of 5,756 sites
(4,778 for NO2 and 4,463 for O3) in 46 countries for the time period January 1, 2018 to July 1, 2020, as summarized in Fig. 1
and Table 1. The vast majority of the observations were obtained from the OpenAQ platform and the air quality data portal
of the European Environment Agency (EEA). Both platforms provide harmonized air quality observations in near real-time,
greatly facilitating the analysis of otherwise disparate data sources. For Japan, we obtained hourly surface observations for a
total of 225 sites in Hokkaido, Osaka, and Tokyo from the Atmospheric Environmental Regional Observation System
(AEROS) (MOE, 2020). To improve data coverage in under-sampled regions, we further included observations from the
cities of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), Quito (Ecuador), and Melbourne (Australia). All cities offer continuous, hourly observations
of NO2 and O3 over the full analysis period, thus offering an excellent snapshot of air quality at these locations. We include
all sites with at least 365 days of observations between Jan 1, 2018 and December 31, 2019, and an overall data coverage of
75% or more since the first day of availability. The final NO2 and O3 dataset comprise 8.9x107 and 8.2x107 hourly
observations, respectively.

Figure 1: Location of the 5,756 observation sites included in the analysis. Red points indicate sites with both NO2 and O3 observations
(3,485 in total), purple points show locations with O3 observations only (978 sites) and blue points show locations with NO2 observations
only (1,293 sites).

2.2 Model
Meteorological and atmospheric chemistry information at each of the air quality observation sites is obtained from the
NASA Goddard Earth Observing System Composition Forecast (GEOS-CF) model. GEOS-CF integrates the GEOS-Chem
atmospheric chemistry model (v12-01) into the GEOS Earth System Model (Long et al., 2015; Hu et al., 2018) and provides
global hourly analyses of atmospheric composition at 25x25 km2 spatial resolution, available in near real-time at
https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/weather_prediction/GEOS-CF/data_access/ (Knowland et al., 2020). Anthropogenic emissions
are prescribed using monthly Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution (HTAP) bottom-up emissions (Janssens-Maenhout et
al., 2015), scaled from 2010 to 2018 based on annual average NO2 satellite observations from the NASA Aura Ozone
Monitoring Instrument (OMI) (Boersma et al., 2011). The 2018 anthropogenic emissions are subsequently used for years
2019 and 2020. Therefore, GEOS-CF does not account for any anthropogenic emission changes since 2018, notably any
anthropogenic emission reductions related to COVID-19 restrictions. However, it does capture the variability in natural
emissions such as wildfires (based on the Quick Fire Emissions Dataset, QFED) (Darmenov and Da Silva, 2015), lightning
and biogenic emissions (Keller et al., 2014). While the meteorology and stratospheric ozone in GEOS-CF are fully
constrained by pre-computed analysis fields produced by other GEOS systems (Lucchesi, 2015; Wargan et al., 2015), no
trace-gas observations are directly assimilated into the current version of GEOS-CF. It thus provides a “business as usual”
estimate of NO2 and O3 that can be used as a baseline for input into the meteorological normalization process.

2.3 Machine learning bias correction
We use the XGBoost machine learning algorithm (https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) (Chen and Guestrin, 2016;
Frery et al., 2017) to develop a machine learning model to predict the time-varying bias at each observation site. XGBoost
uses the Gradient Boosting framework to build an ensemble of decision trees, trained iteratively on the residual errors to
stage-wise improve the model predictions (Friedman, 2001). Based on the 2018-2019 observation-model differences, the
machine learning model is trained to predict the systematic (recurring) model bias between hourly observations and the colocated model predictions. These biases can be due to errors in the model, such as emission estimates, sub-gridscale local
influences (representational error), or meteorology and chemistry. At each site, we use 50% of the observations to train the
model (randomly selected), and the other half is used for validation. Since the machine learning algorithm can be sensitive to
outliers, all observations below or above 2 standard deviations from the mean were removed from the analysis. Figures 2 and
3 summarize the machine learning model statistics for NO2 and O3, respectively.
The input variables fed into the XGBoost algorithm encompass 8 meteorological parameters (as simulated by the GEOS-CF
model: surface north- and eastward wind components, surface temperature, surface relative humidity, total cloud coverage,
total precipitation, surface pressure, and planetary boundary layer height), modelled surface concentrations of 49 chemical
species (O3, NOx, carbon monoxide, VOCs, and aerosols), and 31 modelled emissions at the given location. In addition, we
provide as input features the hour-of-day, day of week, and month of the year; these allow the machine learning model to
identify systematic observation-model mismatches related to the diurnal, weekly and seasonal cycle of the pollutants. In
addition, for sites with observations available for the full two years, we provide the calendar days since Jan 1, 2018 as an
additional input feature to also correct for inter-annual trends in air pollution, e.g., due to a steady decrease in emissions not
captured by the model. This follows a similar technique to Ivatt and Evans (2020) and Petetin et al. (2020).
Based on the machine-learning predictor trained on 2018-2019, we predict the model bias for the observation sites in 2020
and adjust the GEOS-CF model predicted concentrations accordingly.

coefficient (R) for the training data (blue) and the validation data (red). Grey line indicates mean value across all locations. NMB is
defined as mean bias normalized by average concentration at the given site, and NRMSE is the root mean square error normalized by the

3 Results
3.1 Nitrogen dioxide
Figure 4 shows the weekly mean observations of NO2 concentration, the GEOS-CF estimate and the BCM prediction for five
cities, Wuhan (China), Taipei (Taiwan), Milan (Italy), New York (USA) and Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), from January 2018
through June 2020. While the uncorrected GEOS-CF model estimates fail to represent some aspects of the observations due
to uncertainties in model processes and the observation-model scale mismatch, the BCM closely follows the observations for
years 2018 and 2019. Even with only half of the 2018 and 2019 observations fed into the machine learning algorithm, the
BCM equally captures the observations included in the training and left out for validation (see also Fig. 2).
The grey region in Fig. 4 shows the start and end of the implementation of COVID-19 containment measures. The start and
end dates for these are from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_lockdowns or based on local knowledge.
Once containment is implemented, observed concentrations start to diverge from the BCM prediction for Wuhan, Milan and
New York (Fig. 4). For Wuhan, we find a reduction in NO2 of 60% relative to the expected BCM value for February and
March 2020, and similar decreases are found over Milan (60%) and New York (45%) starting in mid-March and lasting
through April (Fig. 4; Tables A1-A3). For cities where restrictions have been mainly removed (Wuhan, Milan)

7

concentrations rise back towards the BCM value, although in neither city are the concentrations fully restored to what might
be expected based on the business as usual GEOS-CF simulation.
Looking more broadly at cities around the globe, 50 of the 61 specifically analysed cities feature NO2 reductions of between
20-50% (Fig. A1-A3 and Tables A1-A3). Most locations issued social distancing recommendations prior to the legal
lockdowns, and the NO2 declines often precede the official lockdown date by 7-14 days (e.g., Brussels, London, Boston,
Phoenix, and Washington, DC).
For Taipei and Rio de Janeiro, the observations and the BCM show little difference (Fig. 4), consistent with the less stringent
quarantine measures in these places. Other cities with only short-term NO2 reductions of less than 25% include Atlanta
(USA), Budapest (Hungary), and Melbourne (Australia), again correlating with the comparatively relaxed containment
measures in these places (Fig. A1-A3). In contrast, Tokyo (Japan) and Stockholm (Sweden), which also implemented a less
aggressive COVID-19 response, exhibit NO2 reductions comparable to those of cities with official lockdowns (>20%),
suggesting that economic and human activities were similarly subdued in those cities.
Substantial differences exist between cities in South America, with Rio de Janeiro and Santiago de Chile showing little
change thus far in 2020, whereas Quito (Ecuador) and Medellin (Colombia) experienced a greater than 50% reduction in
NO2 after the initiation of strict restrictions measures in mid-March (Fig. A3 and Table A3). Concentrations in Medellin
rebounded sharply in April and May, while concentrations in Quito remained 50% below business as usual throughout most
of May and only started to return back to normal values in June.

grey, and the BCM predictions are in dashed black. The area between observations and BCM predictions is shaded blue (red) if

values for the 9, 18, 19, 14 and 2 observational sites in Wuhan, Taipei, Milan, New York, and Rio de Janeiro, respectively. Observations
for China are only available starting in mid-September 2018.

To evaluate the large-scale impact of COVID-19 restrictions on air quality, we aggregate the individual observation-model
comparisons by country. We note that our estimates for some countries (e.g., Brazil, Colombia) are based on a single city
and likely not representative of the whole country. On a country level, we find the sharpest and earliest drop in NO2 over
China, where observed concentrations fell, on average, 55% below their expected value in early February when restrictions
were implemented (Fig. 5). Concentrations remained at this level until late February, at which point they started to increase
until restrictions were significantly relaxed in early April. Our analysis suggests that Chinese NO2 concentrations have
recovered to within 5% of the business as usual since then. For 2019 (dashed line in Fig. 5) the BCM shows a reduction in
NO2 concentrations around Chinese New Year (5th February 2019), and it is likely that some reduction around the
equivalent 2020 period (25th January 2020) would have occurred anyway. However, the 2020 reductions are significantly
larger and more prolonged than in 2019. Similar to China, India shows large reductions in NO2 concentration (60%)
correlating with the implementation of restrictions in mid-March (Fig. 5); however, NO2 concentrations have not yet
recovered by the end of June, reflecting the prolonged duration of lockdown measures. Other areas of Asia, such as Hong
Kong and Taipei, implemented smaller restrictions than China or India and they show significantly smaller decreases (less
than 20%).
For Europe and the United States, we find widespread NO2 reductions averaging 22% in March and 33% in April (Fig. 5). In
some countries, recovery is evident as lockdown restrictions are removed or lessened (e.g., Greece, Romania) but in most
countries, concentrations remain 20% or more below the business as usual scenario throughout May and June.

3.2 Ozone
We follow the same methods for developing a business as usual counterfactual for O3 as we did for NO2 in section 3.1. Any
change in O3 concentration arising from COVID-19 restrictions is set against a large seasonal increase in concentrations in
the Northern Hemisphere springtime (Fig. 6). This makes attributing changes in O3 concentration more challenging than for
NO2. Our analysis shows an O3 increase of up to 50% for some periods in cities with large NO2 reductions (e.g., Wuhan,
Milan, Quito; Fig. 3 and Fig. A4-A6), but there is much less convincing evidence for a systematic O3 response across cities
or on a regional level (Fig. 7). For example, our analysis shows little O3 difference in Beijing and Madrid during lockdown
despite NO2 declines comparable to Wuhan or Milan (Fig. A4-A6). O3 enhancements of 20% are found over Europe (e.g.,
Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg, Switzerland), with a peak in early April, approximately two weeks after lockdown started (Fig.
7).

19, 14 and 4 observational sites in Wuhan, Taipei, Milan, New York, and Rio de Janeiro, respectively. Observations for China are only
available starting in mid-September 2018.

13

Figure 7: Similar to Figure 5 but without Bosnia and Herzegovina and Iceland. Differing colors indicate differing regions (pink: Asia &
Australia; light purple: Europe; dark purple: Americas).

The analysis of O3 is complicated by its nonlinear chemical response to NOx emissions. In the presence of sunlight, O3 is
produced chemically from the oxidation of volatile organic compounds in the presence of NOx. Therefore, a decline in NOx
emissions could decrease O3 production and thus suppress O3 concentrations. On the other hand, the process of NOx titration,
14

in which freshly emitted NO rapidly reacts with O3 to form NO2, acts as a sink for O3 (Seinfeld and Pandis, 2016). Odd
oxygen (Ox=NO2+O3), is conserved when O3 reacts with NO and thus offers a tool for separating these competing processes.
Figure 8 presents the global mean diurnal cycle for O3 and Ox for the 5-month period since February 1, 2020 for both the
observations and the BCM model. Compared to the BCM model, there has been an increase in the concentration of night
time O3 (midnight-5.00 local time, Fig. 8a) by 1 part per billion by volume (ppbv = nmol mol-1) compared to the BCM,
whereas Ox shows a decrease of 1 ppbv (Fig. 8b). Thus, during the night, reduced NO emissions reduces O3 titration,
allowing O3 concentrations to increase. During the afternoon, O3 concentrations are lower by 1 ppbv (Fig. 8a), while
observed Ox concentrations are lower than the baseline model by almost 2 ppbv at 14:00 local time (Fig. 8b). We attribute
the lower Ox to reduced net Ox production due to the lower NOx concentration, but as titration is also reduced, daytime O3
concentrations are little changed. Overall changes to mean O3 concentrations are small, but there is a flattening of the diurnal
cycle.
As shown in the lower panels in Fig. 8, both factors - enhanced night time O3 and reduced daytime Ox - are more pronounced
at locations where pre-existing NO2 concentrations are high (> 15 ppbv). This suggests that the observed O3 deviations from
the BCM are indeed coupled to NOx reductions due to COVID-19 restrictions, given that those are most pronounced at
polluted sites.

15

Figure 8: Observed and BCM modelled diurnal cycle of O3 (a) and Ox (b) from February 1, 2020 through June 30, 2020 with estimated
corresponding changes in surface O3 (c) and Ox (d) relative to the BCM. Barplots (c and d) show observed changes during night time (0-5
local time) and the afternoon (12-17 local time) for locations with low (< 15 ppbv) and high (> 15 ppbv) NO2 concentrations (based on the
2019 average).

3.3 NOx emission reductions
Changes in NO2 concentrations do not necessarily reflect the same relative change in NOx emission (Lamsal et al., 2011). To
analyze the response of NO2 concentrations to a change in NOx emissions, we conducted a sensitivity simulation for the time
period December 1, 2019 to June 8, 2020 using the GEOS-CF model with anthropogenic emissions scaled based on
adjustment factors derived from NO2 tropospheric columns observed by the NASA OMI instrument (Boersma et al., 2011).
Daily scale factors were computed by normalizing coarse-resolution (2x2.5 degrees), 14-day NO2 tropospheric column
moving averages by the corresponding moving average for year 2018 (the emissions base year in GEOS-CF; section 2.2).
Forest fire signals were filtered out based on QFED emissions and no scaling was applied over water. This results in
anthropogenic emission adjustment factors of 0.3 to 1.4 (Fig. A7). These changes are of the same magnitude as obtained
from the observation-BCM comparisons at cities globally (Fig. 5), thus this experiment provides the full range of
16

experienced NO2 changes. However, it should be noted that the scale factors do not necessarily coincide in space and time
with the ones derived from observations and the BCM.
As shown in the left panel of Fig. 9, the GEOS-CF sensitivity simulation indicates that NO2 concentrations drop, on average,
by 80% of the fractional decrease in anthropogenic NOx emission, with a further diminishing effect for emission reductions
greater than 50%. This reflects both the buffering effect of atmospheric chemistry and the presence of natural background
concentrations. Based on bottom-up emissions estimates for 2015 from the Emission Database for Global Atmospheric
Research (EDGAR v5.0_AP, Crippa et al., 2018, 2020) and using a constant concentration/emissions ratio of 0.8 based on
the best fit line obtained from the model sensitivity simulation (dashed purple line in Fig. 9a), we calculate that the total
reduction in anthropogenic NOx emissions due to COVID-19 containment measures during the first six months of 2020
amounted to 2.9 TgN (Fig. 9b and Table 2). This is equivalent to 5.1% of global annual anthropogenic NOx emissions (Table
2). Our estimate encompasses 46 countries that together account for 67% of the total emissions (excluding international
shipping and aviation). We have no information for significant countries such as Russia, Indonesia, or anywhere in Africa
due to the lack of publicly available near real-time air quality information. China accounts for the largest fraction of the
reduced emissions (31%), followed by India (27%), the United States (20%), and Europe (13%).

4 Conclusions
The combined interpretation of observations and model simulations using machine learning can be used to remove the
compounding effect of meteorology and atmospheric chemistry, offering an effective tool to monitor and quantify changes in
air pollution in near real-time. The global response to the COVID-19 pandemic presents a perfect testbed for this type of
analysis, offering insights into the interconnectedness of human activity and air pollution. While national mitigation
strategies have led to substantial regional NO2 concentration decreases over the last decade in many places (e.g., Hilboll et
al., 2013; Russell et al., 2013; Castellanos and Boersma, 2012), the widespread and near-instantaneous reduction in NO2
following the implementation of COVID-19 containment measures indicates that there is still large potential to lower human
exposure to NO2 through reduction of anthropogenic NOx emissions.
The here derived NO2 reductions are in good agreement with other emerging estimates. For instance, we determine an 18%
decline over China for the 20 days after Chinese New Year relative to the preceding 20 days, consistent with the 21%
reduction reported in Liu et al. (2020a). Similarly, our estimated 22% reduction over China for January to March 2020 is in
excellent agreement with the 21-23% reported by Liu et al. (2020b). For Spain, we obtain an NO2 reduction of 46% between
March 14 to April 23, again in close agreement with the values reported in Petetin et al. (2020).
The response of O3 to NO2 declines in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak is complicated by the competing influences of
atmospheric chemistry. From February through June 2020, the diurnal observation-BCM comparisons suggest that the
reduction in photochemical production was offset by a smaller loss from titration. This resulted in a flattening of the diurnal
cycle and an insignificant net change in surface O3 over a diurnal cycle. The competing impacts of reduced NOx emissions
on O3 production and loss are dependent on the local chemical and meteorological environment. This is reflected in the
variable geographical response of O3 following the implementation of COVID-19 restrictions (Le et al., 2020; Dantas et al.,
2020). Moreover, as atmospheric reactivity increases through the Northern Hemisphere spring and summer, the relative
importance of photochemical production is expected to increase in the Northern Hemisphere.
To assess the potential seasonal-scale impact of reduced anthropogenic emissions on O3, we conducted two free-running
forecast simulations between June 8 through August 31, 2020, initialized from the GEOS-CF simulation and the sensitivity
simulation described in Section 3.3, respectively. Both simulations use the same biomass burning emissions based on a
historical QFED climatology. For the forecast sensitivity experiment, we assume a sustained reduction in global
anthropogenic emissions of NOx, carbon monoxide (CO), and VOCs. As shown in Fig. 10, this leads to a general decrease in
O3 concentrations of 10-20% over Eastern China, Europe, and the Western and Northeast US in July and August 2020
relative to the business-as-usual reference forecast simulation. However, it is also notable that in some locations the model
forecast O3 concentrations increase by an equivalent amount (e.g., Scandinavia, South Central US and Mexico, Northern
19

India), reflecting the high nonlinearity of atmospheric chemistry. This highlights the complex interactions between
emissions, chemistry, and meteorology and their impact on air pollution on different time scales. While large reductions in
NO2 concentrations are achievable and immediately follow curtailments in NOx emissions, the O3 response is more
complicated and can be in the opposite direction, at times by as much as 50% (Jhun et al., 2015, Le et al., 2020). This shows
the difficulties faced by policy makers in curbing O3 pollution.

Figure 10: Change in mean surface O3 over the United States, Europe, and Asia for a sensitivity simulation with altered anthropogenic
emissions. Top panels show daily average O3 concentrations at all observation sites within the given region (solid black, Jan-Jun), the biascorrected GEOS-CF model (“BCM”, solid black, Jan 1st - Jun 8th) continued with a business as usual GEOS-CF forecast from Jun 9th Aug 31st, and GEOS-CF forecast assuming sustained 20% anthropogenic emission reduction (blue). Bottom panels show mean changes in
surface O3 for July and August for the low emissions simulation relative to the business as usual forecast.
