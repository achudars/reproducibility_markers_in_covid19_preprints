The Covid-19 pandemic is ongoing worldwide, and the damage it has caused is unprecedented.
For prevention, South Korea has adopted a local quarantine strategy rather than a global lockdown.
This approach not only minimizes economic damage, but it also efficiently prevents the spread of
the disease. In this work, the spread of COVID-19 under local quarantine measures is modeled using
the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered model on complex networks. In this network approach,
the links connected to isolated people are disconnected and then reinstated when they are released.
This link dynamics leads to time-dependent reproduction number. Numerical simulations are performed on networks with reaction rates estimated from empirical data. The temporal pattern of
the cumulative number of confirmed cases is then reproduced. The results show that a large number of asymptomatic infected patients are detected as they are quarantined together with infected
patients. Additionally, possible consequences of the breakdowns of local quarantine measures and
social distancing are considered.

INTRODUCTION

The COVID-19 pandemic has changed various aspects
of our societies, ranging from public health and economic
conditions to human rights. Two other recent coronavirus pandemics, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
(SARS) in 2002 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome
(MERS) in 2013, have produced 8437 and 2519 cases, respectively [1, 2]. On the other hand, within just eight
months (as of September 4th, 2020) there have been
about 28 million cases of Covid-19 and 0.9 million resulting deaths [3]. This is due to an abnormally high
transmission rate, asymptomatic spreading, and the lack
of vaccines or treatments [4, 5]. Under these circumstances, non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social
distancing among individuals, masking, and reinforcing
personal hygiene are alternative approaches to prevention.
Beginning with Wuhan [6, 7], China, the majority of
countries facing the spread of COVID-19 have used the
lockdown policy that restricts travel from other countries
and prevents people from participating in non-essential
social activities [8–13]. However, such a lockdown policy is not sustainable, because it drastically reduces economic activities [8]. Indeed, the majority of countries
that adopted the lockdown policy have failed to sustain
it for more than two to three months; they are gradually
returning to their former policies.
The Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) has achieved great success using the socalled K-quarantine model, which enforces local quarantine around confirmed patients rather than implementing
a global lockdown. This approach, implemented using
the “3T steps,” efficiently prevents the spread of disease
without critical economic damage.
The first step in this procedure is testing. In South
Korea, based on the measures adopted during the 2015

MERS outbreak, diagnostic tool kits have been developed. Thus, the Covid-19 inspection capability and
speed have improved drastically. Moreover, using the
drive-through and walk-through methods, rapid and
large-scale testing with safe separation between potential
patients and medical staff has become possible. Individuals who enter the country from abroad or have been in
close contact with confirmed patients are required undergo diagnostic tests. Those with positive results are
required to be placed in quarantine for two weeks, which
is the maximum incubation period of the disease. During the quarantine period, they must monitor their health
daily and report it on a self-quarantine safety protection
mobile application managed by the KCDC. Their locations are also monitored using the application. If they
exit officially designated locations, they are immediately
apprehended and fined. Thus, a near-ideal quarantine
system is achieved.
The second step is tracing. When the diagnostic test
confirms that an individual is Covid-19 positive, an epidemiological investigation system is launched for that patient. The KCDC traces every place the patient visited
at any time over a recent time window. These places
and times are immediately reported to the public (without any personal information of the patient) using the
application within the districts of visited sites. Every
individual that the patient has been in contact with is
identified and requested to take a diagnostic test. Those
who were in close contact with the patient are preemptively quarantined, while others are encouraged to selfisolate at home. Among them, if some cases are confirmed, the infection route is identified. Thus, the locations at which the epidemic has originated are found,
closed, and disinfected. Those who were in the same
place but did not have close contact with the patient
are identified or encouraged to voluntarily report to the
KCDC, which allows them to take free diagnostic tests.
In certain cases, the location identified may involve privacy infringement, such that individuals present at the
same time as the patient may hesitate to report them-

2
selves having been there. Such individuals are identified
using resources such as the mobile phone records in the
local station and required to take a diagnostic test. Further, they are requested to self-quarantine. During the
quarantine period, individuals are also expected to check
their body temperature and report it on the application.
After two weeks, they are encouraged to undergo the diagnostic test again. If the test result is negative, they are
released and can return to their normal lives.
The final step is treatment. For efficient usage of
medical resources, the severity of patients’ prompts are
graded. Serious cases are admitted to either the residential treatment center or the hospital. Others are isolated
at low-level designated locations or at home. The distribution of medical resources and facilities has contributed
significantly to the low death rate in South Korea. In
addition, hospitals isolate respiratory patients to protect
ordinary patients who require urgent medical care and
are availing other medical services.
These K-quarantine strategies may have some side effects such as invasion of privacy and infringement of human rights. Therefore, the KCDC makes a significant
effort to conceal patients’ personal information from the
public.

NETWORKS

It is worth examining the manner in which the epidemic contagion spreads under the K-quarantine model
as compared to its spread under global lockdown without local restrictions. To achieve this, a mathematical
model is considered in this work. The conventional epidemiological model is a compartmental model in which
each person is considered to be in one of the following
possible states: susceptible (S), latent (L), infected (I),
or recovered/deceased (R). The proportions of people in
each state are regarded as continuous variables, and their
rate equations (time derivatives) are set up as a function
of these proportions with appropriate rate constants. By
solving these differential equations, the fraction of each
state as a function of time is obtained. In the past, this
approach has successfully predicted the evolution of the
fraction of infected populations. However, it may not be
useful when considering the local quarantine effect under
the K-quarantine measures stated above.
Here, the epidemic reactions are simulated on networks. A network is composed of nodes and links, which
represent people and contact between a pair of connected
people, respectively. The numbers of nodes and links
that are simulated on are taken as N = 2.1 × 104 and
L = 5 × N , respectively. This implies that a society composed of N people is being considered, and the average
number of people in contact with each person (called the
‘degree’ in graph theory) is given as hdi = 2L/N = 10.
Some of them, such as family members and colleagues
in the workplace, are in close contact, whereas others,
such as people who met at shopping malls, are in loose

contact. However, these two groups were not differentiated in the simulations described herein. This is because
distinguishing between these two types of contact is only
necessary for lockdown measures [8], where the loosely
connected links are disconnected. In the K-quarantine
model, such a lockdown is not applied. The links need
not be distinguished into two types. Instead, all links
are regarded as close contacts in this small simulation
system sizes. The K-quarantine process is realized by
locally disconnecting the links to an infected node. As
soon as the quarantine is completed and the patient is
released, these links are reinstated. In the K-quarantine
model, once a person is quarantined, they are required
to take a diagnostic test. If the result is positive, then
the people in contact with the patient are quarantined.
Thus, links connected to the neighbors of the confirmed
patient also need to be disconnected.
Networks are classified into two types based on their
connection configurations: random networks and scalefree networks. For random networks, each link is added
between two randomly selected nodes. Thus, the degrees of each node have a Poisson distribution. Because
this model was first proposed by Erdős–Rényi, it is often called the ER model [14]. For scale-free networks,
following the power law, the degrees of each node are
heterogeneous. This implies that a few nodes have large
degrees, but the remaining nodes have small ones. The
nodes with large numbers of neighbors are called hubs.
When a hub is infected, a large number of susceptible
neighbors are exposed to the contagion. This may result
in a spike in contagion. Scale-free networks were constructed using the models proposed by Goh et al. [15]
and Chung and Lu [16].
III.

MODELS

The epidemic reactions proceed as per Markovian dynamics, which are realized by the Gillespie algorithm
(GA) [17, 18]. Each node is in one of the following
states [13, 19–22]: susceptible (S), latent (L), asymptomatic infectious (Ia ), symptomatic infectious (Is ),
asymptomatic in quarantine(Ia0 ), symptomatic in quarantine (Is0 ), or recovered (R, R0 , or R∗ ) [23–26]. The
states of susceptible in quarantine (S 0 ) and latent in quarantine (L0 ) also exist. The dynamic begins with one infected person, with all the others being in a susceptible
state. When nodes in states L, Ia , and Is are absent,
the dynamic falls into an absorbing state, and the nodes
in state S or R remain. The detailed dynamics are as
follows:
A susceptible individual in contact with an infectious
individual Ia and Is enters the latent state (L) at the
rate k1 . These reactions are expressed as

When the latency period ends, the individual becomes

or without symptoms. These states are denoted as Ia or
Is , respectively. These processes occur at rates k2 pa and
k2 (1 − pa ), respectively. Here, pa represents the fraction
of asymptomatic infectious patients. These reactions are
expressed as

This trace process is repeated until no further confirmed
cases are identified. [26, 27]. During the quarantine period, identified asymptomatic infected individuals recover

When symptoms develop, the infected individual must

is positive, they are quarantined. This process occurs at
the rate k3 and is expressed as

The reproduction number (denoted as R0 ), the number of individuals who are susceptible and become infectious by contacting an infected individual, is calculated
as R0 = k1 hdi/k3 , where hdi is the mean number of neighbors on a given network. Herd immunity is the level of
immunity in a population that prevents the spread of
a disease over the entire system. The herd immunity
threshold is described as Pc = 1 − (1/R0 ) [28, 29].

To explore the effect of the self-quarantine measure
on the transmission of Covid-19, the rates k2 − k5 and
pa were estimated based on empirical data on Covid-19
provided by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and
KCDC. First, to find the rate k2 and pa , the time period
between exposure and the onset of symptoms is used.
This interval was estimated to be 6 (mean) days [9, 25,
33]. The infected individual can transmit the disease
1−3 days prior to the onset of symptoms [25, 33]. Thus,
the interval between exposure and becoming infectious
is estimated to be 4 (mean) days [10, 34–38]. We take
k2 (1 − pa ) = 0.25. The resulting data show that the
percentage of asymptomatic infections is estimated to be

Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model. These represent the proportions of susceptible individuals, recovered
individuals without noticing, newly confirmed cases, and accumulated confirmed cases, respectively. The rates are taken as
k1 = 0.11, k2 = 0.39, pa = 0.36, k3 = 0.33, k4 = 0.11, and k5 = 0.08. (a), Simulations are performed on ER random networks
without the K-quarantine measures. System size N = 2.1 × 104 , the mean degree hdi = 10, and k6 = 0 are set. (b), Similar plot
to (a), but under the K-quarantine strategy k6 = 0.09. (c), Similar plot to (b), but the rate k1 changes suddenly at t = 108 to
k1 = 0.41. This change is caused by a new type of coronavirus, GH clade [30, 31]. (d), Similar plot to (b), but the rate k6 = 0
at t = 108. This change is considered to occur because the quarantine system no longer functions owing to overloading. (e)
and (f), Similar plots to (b), but simulations are performed on scale-free networks with degree exponent λ = 2.5 [16] and on an
empirical social network [32], respectively. For (f), N = 21403 and hdi = 7.8. Owing to this smaller mean degree, the contagion
rate is lower. (g) and (h), Similar plots to (b), but on modular networks. The network is composed of Nm modules and each
module contains Nn nodes and has the mean degree of intra-module edge hdintra i = 10. Those modules are connected through
Lm inter-modular links. For (g), Nm = 10, Nn = 104 , and Lm = 200 are set. For (h), Nm = 103 , Nn = 102 , and Lm = 104 are
set.

15%–40% [39–41]. We take pa = 0.36. Thus, k2 ≈ 0.39
and k2 pa ≈ 0.14.
In South Korea, a potential symptomatic infectious
individual develop symptoms and then quarantined approximately in three days [25, 33]. Thus, k3 ≈ 0.33 was
set. Further, it takes approximately nine and 12 days for
an asymptotic carrier and a confirmed infected individual, respectively, to recover [42]. Thus, k4 ≈ 0.11 and
k5 ≈ 0.08 were set. τ was taken to be 14 days.
The infection rate k1 is estimated using the relation
R0 = k1 hdi/k3 . Using the rate k3 = 1/3 and the mean
degree hdi = 10, k1 = 0.11 is obtained when R0 = 3.3
is taken. Using these parameter values, it is observed
that the simulation result fits the empirical data from
the early stages of the Covid-19 outbreak in South Korea (March 2020) to the end of August. For the same
outbreak, the value of R0 directly measured from the
empirical data is R0 ≈ 3.58 [43].
Here, the K-quarantine model was simulated with fixed
rates (k1 − k5 ) and pa , and a controllable quarantine rate
(k6 ) on several types of networks. These included random
networks (Fig. 2(a)-(d)) scale-free networks (Fig. 2(e)),
an empirical social network (Fig. 2(f)), and random networks with modules (Fig. 2(g)-(h)) [44, 45]. It should be
noted that all the rates are fixed throughout the epidemic
spreading process unless otherwise specified. The proportions of nodes in each state are measured as a function
of time in days.

V.

TEMPORAL BAHAVIORS OF SEVERAL
QUANTITIES

In Fig. 2(a), the SEIR model [46–48] is considered
without any quarantine on random networks. Thus,
k6 = 0 was set. Initially, one node is assumed to be
infected, while the other nodes are susceptible. The
fractions ρS (t), ρR (t), ρ̇C , and ρC , are obtained, where
ρC = ρR∗ + ρIa0 + ρIs0 , and the dot represents the time
derivative. ρ̇C and ρC represent the proportions of newly
confirmed cases and the accumulated confirmed cases,
respectively. The three densities are shown in Fig. 2(a).
The contagion spreads rapidly during the early stage and
eventually reaches a steady state. As shown in Fig 2(b)
with k6 = 0.09, when the quarantine system is functioning, the fraction ρC initially increases rapidly, then slowly
increases with some fluctuations, and finally reaches a
steady state. Resurgent behavior is observed in ρ̇C . Further, it is noted that for the system with no quarantine
strategy, the absorbing state of the infectious node completely disappears on reaching the 150th day, whereas for
the K-quarantine system, it reaches the 400th day. The
proportions of the accumulated confirmed cases for (a)
and (b) are close; however, the proportion of remaining
susceptible people is extremely small for (a), but it is
more than 20% for (b). On the other hand, the fraction
of asymptomatic infected patients appears to be about
30% for (a), but it is approximately 10% for (b). This

is because asymptomatic patients can be detected when
they are in quarantine owing to the infection of their
neighbors.
Fig. 2(c) depicts the case in which the infection rate
k1 suddenly increases to k1 = 0.41 at t = 108, owing to the change of virus species from S or V to GH
clade [30, 31]. There exists another significant peak of
ρ̇C around t = 130, and the infection rate increases dramatically. Following this, the system reaches a steady
state. The density of ρC in the steady state increased
by 22.72% compared to that of case (b). However, no
such dramatic change is observed in the empirical data.
Fig. 2(d) depicts the case in which the quarantine system
is overloaded and does not act at a certain time (e.g.,
t = 108). Then, ρ̇C instantaneously exhibits resurgent
behavior and ρC rapidly increases and reaches a steady
state, as in the SIR model.
Next, the K-quarantine model is simulated on a scalefree network in Fig. 2(e) and on an empirical social network in Fig. 2(f). It is thus concluded that overall,
the contagion pattern is insensitive to network structure.
However, the peaks of the daily confirmed case (f) is
higher than those in Fig. 2(b). For (f), the mean degree is
smaller than that for Fig. 2(a)-(e). Therefore, the proportion of accumulated confirmed cases in the steady state is
considerably smaller than that in Fig. 2(b). For (g)-(h),
simulations are performed on modular networks [49, 50].
The modular networks are composed of Nm modules,
each of which contains Nn nodes. Thus, the total number of nodes in the system is Nm Nn . Nodes within each
module are connected to each other randomly with mean
degree hdintra i = 10. To make the modules connected, `m
pairs of modules are selected randomly, each of the pairs
are connected by `p links by selecting `p nodes from each
module. Thus, the total number of inter-modular edges
is Lm = `m `p . Specific those numbers are listed in the
caption of Fig. 2(g)-(h).
Fig. 3(a) and (b) depict the cases in which the system is lockdown for 60 days. The lockdown can be realized by either social distancing or restriction of transportation [8–10]. In (a), the lockdown is implemented
by deleting the fractions of links (indicated in the legend) randomly selected at the 30th day. After 60 days,
those links are recovered. When the fractions are below
50%, the lockdown effect is almost negligible. On the
other hand, when the fraction is 90%, then the epidemic
spread is highly suppressed. In the intermediate range,
a resurgent behavior appears. However, such behaviors
fluctuate depending on the density of infectious nodes at
the 30th day. Thus, in (b), we consider the case that the
starting day of lockdown measure is determined by the
fraction of accumulated confirmed cases, called lockdown
threshold. Once the lockdown comes into force, 70% of
links are deleted and they are recovered after 60 days.
Depending on the threshold value, the time of resurgent
peak is determined. In short, while the lockdown measure during the 60 days is effective during some interval,
the outbreak eventually occurs.

FIG. 3. Similar plots to Fig. 2(b). (a) But, at t = 30, some fraction of links (indicated in legend) are artificially deleted. This
change is considered to occur when a global lockdown is functioning. Depending on the fraction, diverse temporal patterns of
ρC appear. (See the details in the main text.) (b), Similar plot to (a) but the lockdown is functioning when the fraction of
accumulated confirmed cases reaches a threshold value given in legend. Then 70% links are deleted at random. (c), Similar
plot to Fig. 2(b), but a small fraction of the nodes in state S randomly selected everyday are forced to change their state to
the latent state from the specified day. This is caused by the transmission of the disease by people from abroad. (d), Similar
plot to Fig. 2(b), but a large fraction of the nodes in state S instantaneously change state to L on a single occasion [51]. This
change reflects the transmission of the disease by close contact among people participating in a large street demonstration.

In Fig. 3(c), a small number of the nodes in state S
everyday change its state to L. This change is considered to occur when individuals from abroad become new
sources of epidemic. Because in this case, no root is found
explicitly and implicitly in the trail of disease transmission, the pattern of spread may somewhat differ from
the previous patterns. In Fig. 3(d), a large fraction of
the nodes in state S instantaneously change state to L.
This change is considered to occur by the transmission
of disease among people participating in a large street
demonstration at t = 209 owing to their close contact
and shouting.
In Fig. 4, the simulation results are compared with
the empirical data of South Korea (accumulated as of
September 9th, 2020). It is observed that the increasing
behavior of the number of accumulated confirmed cases
from the model during the early stage is well-fitted to the
empirical data with the rates assumed herein. However,
there is some difference during the intermediate stage,
which may be due to the unexpected social event (a festival opening in a club) that was held shortly after reduc-

ing the level of social distancing. In the later region, the
number of confirmed cases abruptly increases owing to
the large demonstration on the main street near the city
hall in Seoul. Among over 10,000 people participating
in the demonstration, a non-negligible portion of them
did not wear masks. Therefore, the disease transmission would be high. The model proposed herein cannot
reproduce the output of such a large-scale perturbation.
Instead, some portion (80%) of the remaining susceptible
nodes were changed to nodes in the latent state, under
the assumption that those portions of people are infected
in high-risk areas. With the passage of time, the surge
decreases owing to the K-quarantine measures.
In Fig. 5, we plot three temporal reproduction numbers
R(t) estimated i) from the statistics of empirical daily
confirmed cases provided in [52] (orange), by simulations
ii) with and iii) without the quarantine measure (green
and brown), respectively. For i), R(t) is obtained as the
ratio of the number of new infectious patients It generated at time step t to the total number of P
infectious pat−1
tients during all precedent time steps, i.e., s=1 It−s ws ,

ii), R(t) is obtained by the formula k1 hd(t)i/k3 , where
k1 and k3 are fixed, and the mean number of susceptible

neighbors of each infectious node at a given time hd(t)i
is variable. Owing to the different methodologies, there
exists some time delay between the two curves R(t) of

R(t) curves are close to each other in the region t > 105,
they are not in agreement with each other in the interval
about 62 < t < 105. This deviation may be caused by
increasing the level of social distancing by the Korean
government.
VI.

CONCLUSION

In summary, a network model was introduced to illustrate the spread of Covid-19 in South Korea under the
K-quarantine model. This model is essentially a SEIR
model on networks; however, it also includes the process
of disconnecting links around infected nodes. While these
disconnections indicate the local isolation of infectious
people, they do not necessitate global lockdown over the
entire system. It may be noted that social contact is not
static but changes temporally. Thus, recognizing all individuals who were in contact with infectious individuals
is a challenging task. Further, information on the spatial and temporal trajectories of infectious individuals is
collected using diverse methods such as CCTV recordings, mobile phone data from local stations, and sending
messages on mobile phones of ordinary people living in
the given regions of the trajectories. This type of tracing
requires a significant amount of human labor combined
with advanced technology.
Appendix A: Simulation algorithm

The probability that the state Xi of a node i changes
the state A from B in unit time is called the transition
rate rXi :A→B . For example, in the K-quarantine model,
the probability that a node in the susceptible state S
moves to the latency state L is as follows:
X
rXi ;S→L = k1
Aij δ(Xj , L)
(A1)
j

where Aij is the adjacency matrix of the network, and
δ(Xj , L) is the Kronecker delta.
When the K-quarantine model is simulated through
the discrete-time approach method, the state of each
node is changed independently depending on the reactions in Fig. 1. On the other hand, the time interval
τ is constant [53]. It is possible that node i in state A
changes to B1 , · · · , BMi , and the transition rate of node
i is expressed as
ri =

Mi
X
α=1

rXi :A→Bα .

(A2)

8
Assume that the reactions follow the Poisson process.
Then, for a given time interval τ , the probabilities pi
and pXi :A→Bα that the state of the node i changes to
another state and to a specific state Bα , respectively, are
obtained as follows:
rXi :A→Bα
pi = 1 − e−ri τ , pXi :A→Bα =
pi ,

ri
Therefore, a random number u is chosen from the uniform
random distribution following (0 : 1]. If u > pi , the state
of node i is not changed; else, the state of node i may be
changed to Bβ as follows:
β−1
X
α=k

rXi :A→Bα < u ≤

β
X

rXi :A→Bα .

It is well known that the time interval τ in which at least
one reaction occurs follows an exponential distribution
with a mean of 1/r.
P (τ ) = re−rτ

Two random numbers u1 and u2 were chosen from the
uniform random distribution following (0 : 1], respectively. Then, the time interval τ = 1r ln u11 was found,
and the node j and state Bβ were obtained as follows:
j β−1
X
X

(A4)

α=1

i=1 α=1

Following the updation of the states of all nodes in parallel, this increases the time by τ .
The Gillespie algorithm [17] was also employed for the
numerical simulation of the K-quarantine model. Because this algorithm adjusts the time interval τ according
to the transition probability, it is widely used to simulate
stochastic epidemic models in real time [18, 54]. The cumulative transition rate r is the probability that at least
one reaction occurs per unit time,

i=1 i=α

Following the change of the state of node j to state Bβ ,
the time increases by τ .
