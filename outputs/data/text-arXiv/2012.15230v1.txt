Abstract
Infectious diseases and human behavior are intertwined. On one side, our movements and interactions are the engines of transmission. On the other, the unfolding of viruses might induce changes to
our daily activities. While intuitive, our understanding of such feedback loop is still limited. Before
COVID-19 the literature on the subject was mainly theoretical and largely missed validation. The
main issue was the lack of empirical data capturing behavioral change induced by diseases. Things
have dramatically changed in 2020. Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been the key
weapon against the SARS-CoV-2 virus and affected virtually any societal process. Travels bans,
events cancellation, social distancing, curfews, and lockdowns have become unfortunately very familiar. The scale of the emergency, the ease of survey as well as crowdsourcing deployment guaranteed
by the latest technology, several Data for Good programs developed by tech giants, major mobile
phone providers, and other companies have allowed unprecedented access to data describing behavioral changes induced by the pandemic.
Here, I aim to review some of the vast literature written on the subject of NPIs during the COVID-19
pandemic. In doing so, I analyze 347 articles written by more than 2518 of authors in the last 12
months. While the large majority of the sample was obtained by querying PubMed, it includes also
a hand-curated list. Considering the focus, and methodology I have classified the sample into seven
main categories: epidemic models, surveys, comments/perspectives, papers aiming to quantify the
effects of NPIs, reviews, articles using data proxies to measure NPIs, and publicly available datasets
describing NPIs. I summarize the methodology, data used, findings of the articles in each category
and provide an outlook highlighting future challenges as well as opportunities

Introduction

Our interactions, movements, and behavior affect the spreading of infectious diseases. The unfolding
of such illnesses, in turn, might drastically affect our actions. Although obvious, particularly during a
pandemic, we still don’t have a well understood and developed theory or even an accepted standardized
approach to account for this observation. Capturing the feedback loop between human behavior and
infectious diseases is one of the key challenges in epidemiology [1]. Arguably, it can be considered as the
hard problem of epidemiology.
Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, the literature tackling this issue was vast [2, 3]. One of the reviews
on the subject noted a key challenge: only 15% of the papers are based on empirical data, most models
being “purely theoretical and lack[ing] representative data and a validation process” [2]. In the small
set of papers informed, at least partially, by empirical data we find interesting approaches. Researchers
have designed games [4, 5], surveys, and used datasets (e.g., television viewing) to infer social-distancing
as well as attitudes, altruism and self-interest in the context of vaccinations [6–11]. Others have used
surveys to measure risk perception during the H1N1 2009 pandemic [12, 13], to estimate the perceived
severity of the SARS outbreak [14], or characterize behavioral changes induced by the seasonal flu [15].
Data from social media have been used to estimate the spread of awareness in the population during the
H1N1 2009 pandemic [16–18]. Another type of approach used epidemiological data (such as incidence)
to calibrate diseases and behavioral models [19, 20]. A notable example of this method is Ref. [21] where
the authors used historical records from the 1918 influenza pandemic to fit three different models, one of
which included behavioral responses, to determine the origins of the multiple epidemic waves observed.
Despite these efforts, the scarcity of direct observational data describing the feedback between human
behavior and diseases represented a major obstacle. The reader might have noted the use of the past
tense which is not, like many others in the text, a grammatical mistake. In fact, in the last year or
so, things have dramatically changed. The COVID-19 pandemic took over the world and unfortunately,
non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been one of the only weapons against the disease. NPIs
refers to a wide range of both top-down (i.e., governmental) and bottom-up (i.e., self-initiated) measures
aimed at interrupting infection chains by altering key aspects of our behavior. Travels bans, curfews,
social distancing, bans of social gathering, face masks, increased hygiene, remote working, school closures,
and lockdowns are examples. The heterogeneity of such measures across space and time as well as the
magnitude of the changes they induced offer an unprecedented opportunity to understand, measure, and
model the link between human behavior and infectious diseases. Modern technology and many Data for
Good programs created by tech giants such as Google, Apple, Facebook by major mobile phone operators
such as Vodafone, Telefonica, Orange and by smaller companies such as Cuebiq, SafeGraph, Unacast
have provided unparalleled lenses to capture the effects of both top-down and bottom-up NPIs. In this
background, I aim to summarize some key observations, data produced, approaches, and knowledge
developed in this turbulent year.

Disclaimer

The incredible work of the research community makes it extremely hard to review manually all papers
related to COVID-19. Just to give an idea of the scale, a query on PubMed for “COVID” returns more
than 71, 000 results. On Google Scholar we can find instead more than 135, 000 matches. Within this
large body of work, some lines of research are smaller than others. However, NPIs have virtually affected
all aspects of human activity. Consequently, we can expect the research on the subject to be vast and
diversified across many communities. As I write we are in the middle of the second wave in Europe.
A new, potentially more transmissible, variant has emerged in the UK. Hence, many more papers are
being started, finalized, and published. Considering my research interests and expertise the focus of
this work is directed mainly towards the epidemiological implications of NPIs. From the development
of epidemic models to surveys aimed at quantifying awareness and their adoption. Hence, I have opted
for PubMed to gather a big part of the papers in the sample. Inevitably, this introduced a bias towards
interdisciplinary, biomedical, and life science journals. Surely a search on the ISI Web of Knowledge
would provide a more exhaustive picture of the implementation and effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions during the pandemic. As described below, I have not done a systematic search on PubMed by,
for example, carefully crafting a set of target keywords via an iterative or a consultation process. Hence,
it is important to stress how this review is not systematic nor complete. However, it covers a large and
diverse body of research providing a glimpse of the breadth in the area and highlights a few key results
as well as the different approaches used.

Data collection, inclusion principles, annotation, and classification

Since the beginning of the pandemic, I have been following the research aimed at modeling the unfolding
of the virus and at characterizing its societal effects. In doing so, I have compiled a list 1 of 57 influential
papers that have shaped the research in the area and that, I believe, everyone would expect to see.
Clearly, this list is biased by the research communities I am part of, those I follow, and my perception.
Thus, I have thought to drastically extend the list using PubMed. To this end, on November 10th I
have submitted the following query: ((non-pharmaceutical intervention) OR (non pharmaceutical intervention)) AND (COVID). The query targeted papers that mention explicitly NPIs and returned 387
results. After some thinking on November 11th 2020 I have further extend the search querying PubMed
for: (behavioral changes) AND (COVID). The idea was to expand even more the corpus by including
papers that studied the impact of COVID-19 on our behaviors without mentioning explicitly NPIs. The
second search returned 210 results. In both cases the query was run without any particular other specification such as constraining the search to titles or abstracts. I have scanned titles and abstracts of
these 597 papers manually eliminating those referring to drugs trails, drugs development, clinical trials,
clinical procedures and research protocols. I have removed duplications and papers outside the scope.
Furthermore, I have kept only articles written in English. At the end of the process, and considering the
initial list, I was left with 347 papers which constitute the corpus of this review.
It is important to stress one more time how this is just a small subset of all related work. For example
searchers in PudMed for restrictions AND COVID, lockdown AND COVID, (control measures) AND
COVID and (social distancing) AND COVID return more than 2000, 2900, 3000 and 8000 results respectively. Furthermore, any systematic review should play with synonymous and similar words. This
monumental work, which would end up with well more than fifteen thousand papers is left for the future
and it would benefit from a large collaboration.
For each paper, I have manually extracted the following information: DOI, countries from author’s affiliations, countries focus of the study (if any), journal and month of publication. Furthermore, I added
annotations to describe which method was used (i.e., survey) and other relevant information (i.e., sample
size, type of data used). After a first sweep, I have done several others to classify the corpus and create
a personal, machine readable, taxonomy reported in Fig 1.
At the higher level, by considering the most representative methodology and/or aim of each paper,
we find 7 categories:
1. Epidemic models (29%): papers aimed at describing the unfolding of COVID-19 via epidemic
models;
2. Surveys (28%): papers aimed at characterizing the impact of NPIs on several areas of human
activity and/or their adoption via surveys;
3. Comments and/or perspectives (17%): papers that offer a reflection/perspective on NPIs in
particular contexts;
4. Quantifying the effects of NPIs (12%): papers aimed at characterizing the effects of NPIs on
epidemic indicators, behaviors and activities;
5. Reviews (6%): papers presenting a summary of the literature about NPIs in different contexts
and areas;
6. Measuring NPIs via proxy data (5%): papers monitoring and measuring NPIs via data proxies;
7. Datasets (2%): papers describing and sharing data collections relevant for the study of NPIs.
As in any classification scheme not all cases are clear cuts and there is some overlap. To simplify the
analysis, I have assigned each paper to one and one only main category. Clearly, this implies same level
of arbitrary in the classification.

Figure 1: Schematic representation of the classification scheme. The central node describes all articles.
The size of each node (i.e., category) is proportional to the number of articles.
By using Semantic Scholar 2 I have also extracted information about the authors and citations of each
paper. Remarkably, these papers have been written by more than 2518 authors (note that some were not
indexed) and accumulated more than 9300 citations 3 . In Table 3, I provide the breakdown of number
of authors, citations, median of citations and the top three articles (per number of citations) in each
category. Epidemic models are the most cited category in the sample both for total number and median
of citations. Surveys are the least cited considering the median of citations of the articles in the group.
It is important to stress how this literature is very recent. Some papers have been published just one or
two months ago hence they did not have enough time to accrue citations.

Epidemic models

After the first suspicious cases of pneumonia in Wuhan were linked to a new virus, a set of key questions
rapidly emerged. How infectious and fatal is it? How does it transmit? How many people are already
sick? Can it be contained? What are the chances of importation in other countries? Is this the start
of a new pandemic? When the virus was detected in Singapore, South Korea, France, UK, Italy, USA
answers to many of these questions were still unclear. However, it did not take long to understand that
widespread community transmission was probably taking place. Testing was initially targeted towards
symptomatic individuals with travel history in China and the virus was spreading undetected via what
is called cryptic transmission. Cases, deaths and hospitalizations started to double at increasing pace in
many countries. Asian states took draconian measures early. Europe reacted too late. Despite concerning
news coming for Asia, the first European countries hit by waves of deaths and hospitalizations assumed,
just days before, to be in perfect control. Emblematic is what the major of London declared the same
days when Italy started a national lockdown: “we should carry on doing what we’ve been doing” [43].
Things escalated quickly and in one week also the UK entered in a national lockdown. After the efforts
and unprecedented NPIs put in place around the world, epidemic curves started to level off and also
thanks to the good weather COVID hospitals started to empty, deaths rapidly decreased, and number of
cases showed clear downwards trends. At this stage, the key questions revolved around how to relax the
measures and reopen society. Should we keep the schools closed? Restaurants and pubs? What about
international borders? Should face masks be mandatory? Summer 2020, in the northern hemisphere, has
been extremely better than the dark months of spring. However, the infections started to ramp-up quite
quickly in September and October. While countries have developed quite different strategies to manage
winter, it became unfortunately clear that the virus was winning one more time. As I write these words,
we are in the second national lockdown in England and from tomorrow some of the restrictions will be
lifted. The questions now revolve around the Christmas break. What should people be allowed to do?
How many people should meet during the holidays? What about Christmas shopping? One more time
we are all facing a very challenging act balancing risks with hopes to go back to semi-normal life.
Although, the set of questions during the different phases of the pandemic changed many of the answers
have been provided and/or informed by epidemic models. Not all suggestions coming from the Science,
as they say here in the UK, have been followed by our leaders, but it is clear that forecasts, predictions,
scenario analyses coming from a variety of models were key to inform response strategies. In this section,
I will revise some of the literature produced in the area. All models target the same virus, but the type
of approach, data used, assumptions, how NPIs are modeled, limitations, strengths, predictive power or
predictive ambitions are extremely diverse.
Before diving into the details, few words about the subset of research I will be reviewing. First of all, the
large majority of models was tested or motivated by observations in one single country. USA, China, Italy,
France and the UK are the most commonly used countries (see Fig 2). The list does not come as surprise
considering the epicenter of the pandemic, data availability as well as the evolution of the pandemic in
USA and Europe. However, few models in the sample consider hundreds of countries [22, 44, 45, 45–47].
Second, this body of research has been published by authors with affiliations in 40 countries. USA, UK,
China, and Italy are the top of the list. Third, there is a large variety also in terms of publication venues
(see Fig 2)). In fact, the sample of epidemic models has been published in 50 venues (including 7 papers
in medRxiv). Science, Chaos Solitons Fractals, Mathematical Biosciences, medRxiv, Nature, and PNAS
are at the top of the list. Finally, these papers have been written by more than 774 authors and received
more than 4835 citations. A median of 5 citations per article.

Classification

After analyzing the whole subset of papers and considering the typology of model adopted, I have
identified 4 categories. In particular:
1. Compartmental models: consider a single population divided according to health statuses and
in some cases age structure;
2. Metapopulation models: are based on a network of subpopulations (i.e. cities, regions, countries) connected by mobility;
3. Statistical models: capture the evolution of the epidemic inferring key parameters and behaviors
from data;

4.2

Compartmental models

Compartmental models are the most common in the category. Probably this does not come as surprise
since they require the least amount of data about the population under study. Nevertheless, they are
a proven and powerful tool for describing the evolution of infectious diseases. It is important to note
how compartmental models are featured also in other categories of models discussed below. In fact, it is
extremely common to describe individuals’ progression in the different phases of a disease (i.e., natural
history of the disease) via compartments, each one representing health statuses. Susceptible, infectious,
asymptomatic infectious, hospitalized, and recovered are classic examples. Other modeling approaches
use a compartmentalization of the target population as one of the elements of the theoretical construct.
Explicit social contacts structures, travel patterns and other features are added to model to describe key
epidemiologically behaviors. In the category discussed here instead, these other details are simplified
and expressed via effective functions, contact matrices, and rescaling of parameters.
As mentioned, compartmental models split the population according to health statuses. The number and
type of compartments change as function of the disease under study, according to the hypotheses about
the mechanisms driving the spreading of the virus and the behavior of the population. All compartmental models in the sample, and there are many, are a variation of two basic archetypes: SIR or SEIR.
The sequence of letters, describing each compartments, captures the natural history of the disease. In
SIR models susceptible individuals, in contact with infectious, develop the disease and move from S to
β
I. This transition is often written as S + I −
→ 2I where β is the transmission rate. The R compartment
describes recovered individuals that are removed from the disease dynamics. The transition from I to

µ

R is spontaneous and can be written as I −
→ R where µ is the recovery rate. µ−1 is the infectious
period. In SEIR models, we have another compartment E describing individuals that were exposed to
β
the virus but not yet infected. Thus the transmission of the disease can be written as S + I −
→ E + I.

As soon as the viral load reach certain levels exposed become infected E →
− I. The sum of −1 and µ−1
is called generation time, defined as the average time from an infection to the next. In these archetypes,
the per-capita rate at which susceptible contract the infection, the force of infection, is often written as
λ = βI/N . Hence, it is proportional to the transmission rate and to the probability of meeting an infectious individual in a homogeneously mixed population. These models are characterized by another key
quantity called basic reproductive number, R0 , defined as the number of secondary infections generated
by an index case in an otherwise fully susceptible population. In case R0 is above one the disease is able
to spread and affect a finite fraction of the population. In SIR and SEIR models it is simple to show
how R0 = β/µ. In more complex models with several types of infectious compartments the expression
is generally different but it can be calculated via the so called next generation matrix approach. See
Ref. [140] for a very accessible and clear review.
The majority of models is the sample follow the SEIR archetype thus can be classified as SEIR-like
models. If you ever had to quarantine after crossing a border, you have experienced first hand the reason
why including the compartment of exposed is important: the incubation period peaks within few days
but it has been reported to possibly extend for more than one week. As we will see below, the general
structure of these models is that of a simple SEIR model but typically several other compartments are
added to account for individuals that are hospitalized, different types of manifestation of the disease
(i.e., symptomatic, asymptomatic, paucy-symptomatic), as well as behavioral classes (i.e., individuals
wearing face masks, reducing their contacts because concerned). COVID-19 is a quite complex disease
with a wide range of manifestations that affects people’s health and behaviors in different ways.
A subset of both SEIR and SIR like models include another important element: the age-structure of
the population. In fact, COVID-19 does not affect age classes homogeneously. Older individuals have a
much higher risk of hospitalization and mortality [141]. Furthermore, stratifying the population for age
classes allows to account for the fact that contacts are not homogenous across age brackets. Including
empirical contact matrices, which describe the rate of contacts within and across age classes, allows to
move towards a more precise representation of the spreading of the virus and to account, explicitly, for
different infection fatality rates (IFRs). Furthermore, the ability to include contacts patterns across age
groups allows to split contacts taking place at school, work, and in other contexts. This is particular
important for models which aim to measure the impact of school closure, remote working, and other
NPIs. After this general prelude, let’s dive into the research that adopts compartmental models to study
the spreading of COVID-19.
We start considering the body of modeling work based on SIR-like models. This subset of papers
studies the effects of isolation and quarantine policies [49], models NPIs as effective changes of the
parameters [44, 45, 48, 50, 52, 54–57, 59], investigates the impact of different policies [53, 58], and
defines the conditions for the optimal control of the spreading [51]. In the following, I will highlight some
of these approaches.
Ref. [49] presents a modification of the SIR scheme including a compartment X to account for the portion
of infectious individuals that are either quarantined or adopts other forms of NPIs, which effectively
nullifying their ability to spread the virus. Furthermore, the model also considers that a portion of
susceptible adopts NPIs and as result is removed from the epidemic dynamics. Interestingly, these two
relatively simple modifications of the classic SIR model are enough to explain the sub-exponential growth
observed in China. In fact, without any interventions a SIR model would imply an exponential growth in
the early phases of the epidemic which is not what has been empirically observed in the Chinese context.
A number of papers propose approaches to account for NPIs as effective variation or modulation of key
SIR parameters such as the transmission rate β and recovery rate µ which are either fitted from data
or set a priory in scenario analyses. Two papers focusing on India [56], Italy and China [52] extended
the force of infection including a time-varying parameter π(t) to modulate the bare transmission rate
β. The modulation is function of the NPIs put in place to curb the spreading of the virus. By fitting
the model to epidemic indicators Ref. [52] estimated a R0 for Italy above 4 and in Hunan around 3 in
the early phases of the pandemic. A similar model has been proposed to infer the impact of NPIs on
the epidemic evolution in Germany [55]. The author extended the SIR archetype considering that the
transmission rate β can change at certain points ti , β → βi with i = 1, . . . , n, from βi−1 to βi over ∆ti
days. Hence, the index i runs over the possible change points, each covering several days. For simplicity
they assume a linear variation. The parameters βi , ti , ∆ti among others are obtained via a Bayesian
9

Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) comparing each potential model with real data. Interestingly,
they observed that only the compound effects of NPIs, put in place at different moments, was enough
to bring the reproductive number below one. A similar estimation framework has been used to model
the pandemic in Brazil and China [48]. In this paper however, authors impose a precise functional form
of the variation of the transmission rate: β(t) = β0 exp−γ(t−tx ) for t > tx where β0 is the value in
absence of any interventions, γ is the modulation introduced by NPIs and tx is the time in which the
interventions are put in place. A Bayesian framework is also used in Ref. [44] which provides a picture
of key epidemic indicators such as Rt for 51 countries which can be explored via a dashboard 4 . In
this model the transmission rate is written as β = Rt µ (remember that µ is the recovery rate). The
reproductive number is considered to go from R0 to kint R0 with kint = (0, 1) as function of the time due
to NPIs implementation. The results indicate that the timing of NPIs is key for an effective suppression
of the virus. Ref. [45] adopts an extension of the SIR archetype, considering time-varying recovery and
infection rates, to model the spreading of COVID-19 in 187 countries. The results, that can be explored
via an interactive tool 5 , are obtained fitting the parameters to the real epidemic data. The comparison
between different countries highlights the heterogeneity in the response. For example Iceland was able
to drastically reduce Rt since early April thus suppressing the spread with efficacy. Sweden in contrast,
opted for a mitigation strategy, and as result the decrease of Rt was much slower. In Ref. [57] authors
extend the basic SIR model including, among other things, deaths and writing the transmission rate
as β(t) = β1 b1 (t) + β2 b2 (t) thus as a linear combination of two basic rates. The first weights more in
the early phases of the spreading. The second kicks in when the NPIs are in full swing. Similarly they
consider the recovery and mortality rates as linear combinations of so called basis functions. A key point
of the methodology is defining the shape of such functions. Interestingly the authors adopt a sparse
identification techniques applied to the real epidemic data finding a combination of exponentials and
polynomials to be the best fit. The model, applied both to national and regional data in Italy, show the
effectiveness of the first lockdown (that was implemented in the first half of March 2020) especially in
the regions more affected. In Ref. [53] authors use a mix of econometric and epidemiological methods
to quantify the effect of a NPIs policies on the evolution of the pandemic. The problem formulation is
similar to those linking economical policies to economic growth. The first are substitute by NPIs. The
second, by the epidemic growth. In the early stage of an epidemic is easy to show that, according to an
0
SIR model, log(It ) − log(It0 ) = expg(t−t ) where g is β − µ. The authors link this observable to the set
of NPIs policies implemented by the country c, in subnational unit i, in day t as:
log(Ic,i,t ) − log(Ic,i,t−1 ) = θ0,c,i + δc,i + µc,i,t +

θ0,c,i is the growth rate in absence of any policy, δc,i accounts for weekly patterns in data reporting,
µc,i,t accounts for variations in reporting methods, which might induce jumps in the data, p describes
the policy adopted, θp,c the impact of each policy in the growth rate and c,i,t is the classic error term.
In other words, the growth rate is assumed to be a linear combination of each policy implemented. By
fitting the model to data from China, South Korea, Iran, Italy, France and USA, the authors establish
that the portfolio of measures implemented in these countries was enough to reduce the transmission
and were beneficial in terms of health outcomes. The results also show the heterogeneous impact of the
measures across countries. For example the impact of school closures on daily growth rate appear to
be higher in Italy than France. Ref. [58] used online searches and mobility data to estimate the effect
of heterogenous implementation of NPIs in the USA. Interestingly, they found that some specific locations (such as churches) saw an increase in attendance locally while, as result of stay home orders, they
decrease nationally. This counterintuitive observation shows the effect of heterogeneity in NPIs. Local
closure might induce some individuals to travel further for the same activity. The effect of this type of
adaptive behavior might increase the number of cases. In fact, the changes in mobility might induce
mixing of otherwise separated groups, thus accelerating the spreading. They confirm this intuition with
a simple model that divides a population of N individuals in M gatherings. They assume that a fraction
X closes at time tc due to the implementation of NPIs. As result, a fraction of the population Y does
not complies with the measures and visit the 1 − X gatherings still open. In these settings, the dynamics
of the disease split at time tc in two. On one side, the open gatherings are still participating to the
spreading of the virus. On the other, closed gatherings can just recover the individuals infected before.
The results clearly show that the patchy adoption of NPIs induces worse health outcomes and highlights

the negative effects of inconsistent geographical implementation of NPIs.
Three articles expanded the SIR modeling framework considering age structure and contact matrices [47, 60, 61, 102]. In Ref. [47] authors study the impact of COVID-19 and the effects of different
NPIs strategies in low and middle income countries. Including age brackets and the share of contacts
within/across them allows to account explicitly for the demographic distribution and mixing patterns
of the population under consideration. This becomes very important when comparing the spreading of
COVID-19 in different socio-economic contexts. In fact, low and middle income countries are typically
younger populations, thus less at risk of serious forms of COVID-19. However, the social stratification
is such that older individuals have higher contacts with other age brackets respect to what happens in
higher income settings [47] . Hence, there is smaller fraction of the population at high risk, but that
fraction is more intensely connected with younger individuals thus more prone to be exposed to the virus.
This interplay is fully explored by the authors which also consider a range of comorbidities, healthcare
availability and quality. Furthermore, the authors consider two possible approaches in the management
of the pandemic. The first is suppression of the first wave by strict NPIs which pushes Rt below one. The
second instead is mitigation, which reduces Rt to values close to one. Suppression drastically limit the
burden in the short run, but comes with high socio-economic costs and since it limits the spreading does
not form the necessary immunity to avoid multiple peaks. Mitigation, allows for less stringent NPIs but
is linked to a much higher number of cases/deaths and pressure to the healthcare system. While younger
demographic structures might suggest that mitigation in low and middle income settings might be a more
suitable strategy respect to high income contexts, the higher levels of intergenerational mixing, limited
resources in terms of healthcare facilities, and comorbidities impose great deal of caution. It is interesting
to notice how the response of these group of countries has been put in place early respect to the local
circulation of the virus. The paper also point out the challenges and different angles governments have
to consider when developing a strategy against COVID-19. Authors in Ref. [102] consider two different
strategies to curb the spreading of COVID-19 in schools. In doing so, they consider a stratification of
the population (i.e., school) considering different cohorts (i.e., classes), day of infection (to account for
different viral loads) and study the effects of NPIs that i) isolate students with fever ii) reduce the school
week to four days. After fitting the model to the spreading of ILIs and COVID-19 in school settings, the
authors found that, in the context of COVID-19, reducing the school week is more efficient measure.
The body of modeling work based on the SEIR scheme touches similar themes to those just mentioned,
but due to the larger number of articles, there are also some new interesting angles. In particular, we
find papers focusing, among other things, on the effects of face masks [82, 85–87, 89], capturing different aspects of NPIs [64, 67, 69–71, 73–75, 77, 79–81, 83, 84, 90], studying the problem of optimal
control of the pandemic [72, 76, 78, 88], investigating approaches to lift measures put in place in the first
wave [62, 63, 65], model the possible exposure to the virus via droplets or fomites [91, 92], and consider
the impact on the health care infrastructure of COVID-19 and seasonal flu in the winter [68].
In Ref. [85] authors present a detail scenario analysis of the winter season in each US state. Interestingly, in their model not only β is considered function of time, but the force of infection is modulated
by a mixing parameter α defined in such a way that λ(t) = β(t)(I1 + I2 )α /N where I1 and I2 describe
per-symptomatic and symptomatic individuals. Furthermore, they develop a pipeline modeling the link
between the transmission rate and cases, deaths as well as a range of covariates such as mobility indicators, population density, smoking rates, masks use via a regression. In doing so, they build a linear
regression model to link the implementation of different NPIs (e.g., school closures, stay home orders) on
mobility considering data from Google mobility reports 6 , Facebook data for good 7 , SafeGraph 8 and
Descartes laboratories 9 . Using the observations for all these variables in the first wave, they study the
possible scenarios in the winter considering an adaptive strategy where NPIs are reinstated if a certain
threshold of mortality rates is reached. The results confirm the effectiveness of NPIs and show that a
95% adoption rate of mask covering could be crucial to mitigate the effects of disease resurgence. Furthermore, they estimate that universal face covering could help save more than hundred thousands of
lives. The importance of face masks has been also show in Refs. [82, 86, 87, 89]. In more details, authors
in Ref. [86] consider a model featuring susceptible, exposed, infectious, asymptomatic, critical (ICU),
and recovered individuals. Furthermore, they split the population separating susceptible and exposed
individuals under quarantine, as well as isolated infectious people. In doing so, they also assume that a
fraction of the population adopts face masks that have an efficacy modeled as a free parameter. Interest6 https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/

ingly, they apply the model to the US and New York state observing that, within the assumptions made,
an adoption rate of 70% in New York state and 80% in the USA of mask with efficacy above 70% could
lead to an elimination of the virus. Ref. [87] proposes a different methodology by modeling the adoption
of face masks splitting the population and compartments (susceptible, exposed, symptomatic infectious,
asymptomatic, hospitalized, recovered and dead) in two: those wearing face masks and those not wearing
them. Using data and observations from New York and Washington state their model suggests that high
adoption rates (80%) even of moderately effective masks (50%) could seriously impact the spreading of
COVID-19 by reducing projected deaths by 17% − 45% over a two months period. Authors in Ref. [83]
manage to account super-spreading events and thus study the effects of NPIs aimed at chopping off the
tails of transmission rates. Typically, models that consider this aspect are based on explicit contact
networks capturing the heterogeneity of social interactions. Compartmental models are typically based
on the assumption of homogenous mixing which by definition neglect the features of real contact patterns. The authors propose accounting for the heterogeneity in transmission rates by considering the
effective (population-wide) effect of having individual transmission rates following a gamma distribution.
In doing so, they are able to model the effect of NPIs targeting super-spreading events, by affecting the
θ
aforementioned distribution. Furthermore, they assume a time varying β(t) = β0 βm
where θ modulates
the implementation of NPIs. Such measures induce variations in the transmission rate distribution. The
model, fitted to data from several counties across USA, shows that targeted NPIs that cut the right tail
of transmission rates distribution are more efficient than social distancing measures at the population
level (affecting the average rather than the extreme values). This result is in line with classic results from
epidemic spreading on heterogenous networks which show that targeted measures aimed at isolating few
central individuals are much more efficient than average measures across the whole system [142, 143].
Two papers based on data and observations in South Korea model NPIs considering that susceptible
individuals might adopt protective behaviors as function of the number of infected individuals in the population [79, 80]. In particular, they adapt the model proposed in Ref. [144] where there are two classes
of susceptible: S and S F . The latter describes scared individuals (F stands for feared) of infection that
δβ

change behaviors to reduce their risks. The transmission rate for these individuals becomes S F +I −→ 2I
where δ is the protection gained. People join the compartment as function of the number of individuals
in self-isolation. This transition is not modeled as mass-action. Thus it is not driven by the fraction
of individuals in self-isolation but by their absolute number. In fact, in a context such as South Korea,
where the extinction efforts have been quite successful, the news of few cases might induce behavioral
changes. Feared individuals might move back as function of the fraction susceptible (not scared) and
recovered individuals. The authors fit the model to the epidemic curves at the country and/or regional
level to estimate the extent to which behavioral changes, as modeled, have been adopted. They show
that, as expected, regions with more cases are compatible with a lower adoption. A similar model has
been proposed in Ref. [75] in the context of Indonesia. Here, susceptible individuals are split in two:
unaware and aware of the risks of infection. People move in the aware compartment with a constant
rate which models a media effect. Aware individuals are characterized by a lower transmission rate and
might relax their behavior spontaneously. The model includes also undetected and detected infectious
compartments. People in the first might be tested and transition in the second compartment. The results
show how a combination of effective media campaigns and aggressive testing might reduce drastically the
burden of the disease. Ref. [77] proposes similar approach. In fact, the authors assume that a fraction q
of the population adopts NPIs while 1 − q does not. The split takes place at the time when the measures
are put in place. The transmission rate is modeled as linear decreasing function of time, which goes
from β0 to β < β0 within a certain time window after the start of NPIs. The authors fit the model to
the epidemic data from Mexico City finding that NPIs were critical to contain the first wave and that
the data is compatible with high level of adoption rates. Ref. [64] proposes a SIER-like model splitting
compartments in two accounting for those adopting physical distancing and those that do not. By using
a Bayesian approach the model is fitted to the evolution of the first pandemic wave in British Columbia
(Canada), few US States and New Zealand. The results for Canada suggest a widely adoption of physical
distancing in the Canadian province and indicate that NPIs have reduced by about 80% social contacts
bringing the Rt below its critical threshold. Similar results are found for New Zealand. In the USA the
results suggest a reduction in New York, Florida, and Washington but not in California. In Ref. [67]
authors study the pandemic in Wuhan with the aim to reconstruct its progression as function of the
interventions. In doing so, they propose an extension of the classic SEIR model considering individuals
traveling in and out the population under study (note that this is modeled as an effective in-out flow)
before the cordon sanitarie. The initial ascertainment rate is estimated considering the cases imported
from Wuhan to Singapore which, due to aggressive surveillance, is assumed to have detected them all.
12

Furthermore, the infectiousness of unascertained cases is considered to be 55% respect to infectious individuals. The incubation period is set to be 5.2 days and the pre-symptomatic infectious period 2.3
days implying a latent period of 2.9 days. Finally, they consider the transmission and ascertainment
rates possibly different in four time periods describing the different phases of the pandemic. The values
of these rates are estimated from data using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. The results highlight
the features of the pandemic: high covertness (87% of infectious were unascertained) and transmissibility
(R0 = 3.54).
Several papers studied the implementation of NPIs as an optimal control problem [72, 76, 78, 88]. Authors
in Ref. [76] consider as optimal strategies that reduces the disease burden as well as the socio-economic
cost of NPIs. It is interesting to notice how the structure and weight of the different components of the
cost function is arbitrary and dependent on the ultimate goals. The authors propose one that puts high
values to human lives and assumes that economic activity is proportional to the number of contacts,
similarly to the transmission rates. This assumption allows to simply link NPIs to economic costs. Using
data and observations from Ireland the authors found that disease suppression is preferable to mitigation.
Ref. [72] confirms that balancing economic costs of NPIs and avoid the overflow of health care facilities
in an optimal mitigation strategy might be a “tightrope walk close to the stability boundary of the
system”. Furthermore, authors of Ref. [88] point to the fact that the effectiveness of optimal mitigation
strategies depends on the details of key epidemiological parameters and on the exact impact of NPIs.
Hence confirming the challenges linked to the definition of optimal mitigation strategies.
A set of papers focus on the effects of relaxing NPIs after the first wave [62, 63, 65]. Authors in Ref. [62]
consider an extension of the SEIR model including confined susceptible, quarantined and deceased individuals. They model recovery and transmission rates as function of time fitted to the data from the first
wave in different countries (Argentina, Indonesia, Japan, New Zealand, Spain, and USA). They then
explore different reopening scenarios finding that lockdowns of two months would be ideal to prevent
disease resurgence and that effective social distancing as well as other NPIs adopted by a larger fraction
of the population could avoid the need for other lockdowns. Authors in Ref. [65] focus on data from
Canada, Germany and Italy and used a neural network approach to fit an extended SEIR model that
accounts for asymptomatic, symptomatic, hospitalized, and deceased individuals to real epidemic data.
Their results suggest that reopening strategies should be gradual and stage-wise to avoid quick disease
resurgence.
Two theoretical approaches consider explicitly the presence of the virus in the compartmental structure [91, 92]. In particular, authors of Ref. [91] split a population in two: those wearing masks and those
that don’t. Then they consider that asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals create the inoculum
in form of droplets. These are described by a compartment D and move with a certain rate into the
fomite compartment F capturing the virus presence in contaminated surfaces. Finally, fomites decay.
Interestingly, the transmission rates are driven by the interactions of susceptible with the D and F
compartments. This allows to model more explicitly the role of face masks which offer some protection from droplets but not from fomites. Ref. [68] focuses on the possible impact of the seasonal flu in
the management of the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, flu symptoms might be confused with those of
COVID-19. As result resources, key for the fights against the current pandemic, such as tests, might be
diverted towards the flu. The authors propose to capture this possible negative interaction by extending
the classic SEIR model to account for asymptomatic, symptomatic, as well as susceptible, exposed, and
infected quarantined. Furthermore, they consider the possibility of having individuals with the flu in
the pool of people to quarantine and subject to COVID-19 tests. They consider a transmission rate
explicitly function of contacts that due to NPIs go from c0 to a cb exponentially as function of time.
Their results show how an uptake of the flu vaccine could help the depletion of resources necessary to
contain COVID-19.
Several articles adopted SEIR-like models with age-structures to study the impact of different NPIs in
countries [23, 93, 96–98, 101], reopening scenarios [95, 103], investigate herd immunity [94, 104], and
consider particular contexts such as African countries [99, 100].
Two articles modeled the impact of the NPIs in the first wave in France and studied different reopening
scenarios [96, 97]. In particular, Ref. [97] considers an extended SEIR model with contact matrices and
age structure fitting the transmission rate β before and during the lockdown from data. They studied
different contact matrices during the lockdown (not estimating them from data). The baseline for the
lockdown considers no contacts in school, a reduction of 80% of work contacts, and 90% in other locations. The results suggest that about 3% of infected individuals was hospitalized (by May 11), and an
average 0.5% died across the board. The IFR for individual 80+ was found to be 8.3% while 0.001%
for those 20 or younger. Furthermore, the results indicated that Rt was reduced from 2.9 to 0.67 and

13

5.3% of the population is considered to be infected by mid May. Ref. [96] considers a similar model
(though with a broader range of compartments to account for asymptomatic, paucy-symptomatic, mild,
and severe infectious) for the Il̂e de France, region where the capital is located. They consider a range of
NPIs such as remote working, school closure, case isolation, banning of social events, and senior isolation
that study them as single or as portfolio of interventions. Each NPIs affects the contact matrices. The
lockdown is for example modeled considering a complete removal of contacts in school, remote working
at 70%, 90% of senior isolation, closure of all non essential activities but no case isolation. Fitting the
model via a maximum likelihood approach to hospital admission data, the authors estimate an R0 = 3.18
that was effectively reduced to 0.68 by the lockdown. Furthermore, estimates for the IFR are in between
0.7 − 1.2%. These figures are a bit higher than those mentioned above. It is important to stress how
this paper focuses on one of the most afflicted region of France while the first considered the entire country thus averaging with areas less affected. A similar approach, though with a simpler compartmental
structure and no fit with real data but a scenario analysis informed by observations from Wuhan, has
been proposed also in Ref. [23]. The results, published at the end of March, indicate the impact of
school closures and remote working on the mixing patterns, thus on the disease and the risks of lifting
the restrictions too early. Authors of Ref. [93] consider instead the case of UK and study the impact of
several NPIs such as school closure, social distancing, shielding, self-isolation and different portfolios of
them on the burden of the disease. They use a simpler age-stratified SEIR model for each of the 187
counties in the UK and model the variation of the contact matrices induced by NPIs. Interestingly, the
results show that moderate levels of interventions (i.e., school closure, self-isolation, or shielding) even in
combination would not be enough to avoid exceeding healthcare capabilities. The authors suggest that
only more strict measures, such as lockdown, implemented for shorter periods in a background of general
social distancing might be enough to avoid crushing the health system.
Authors of Ref. [95] model different reopening scenarios after the first lockdown in London UK. In doing
so, they extend the SEIR model to account for age-structure, contact matrices and other compartments
such as asymptomatic, symptomatic and isolated infectious individuals. They study different scenarios: city wide extended lockdown, universal testing in a background of less stringent social distancing,
shielding people 60+, universal testing and face coverings, universal testing isolation of cases and their
contacts and face coverings during the lockdown. The model confirms also in this context how strategies
that combine a range of NPIs are the most efficient and offer alternatives to extended lockdowns.
Two articles tackle the issue of herd immunity. Ref. [94] adopts an SEIR model with age structure and
contact matrices fitted to the UK to investigate the feasibility of dynamic mitigation strategies that reduce the reproductive number in such a way to avoid overflowing the healthcare system. In other words,
when the infections are decreasing some measures might be lifted until certain warning levels are reached.
This implies the ability to modify the contact matrices as function of the disease progression. In doing
so, hypothetically, the impact of the virus can be mitigated with less stringent measures. The authors
show how, even in simple modeling settings, such dynamic mitigation strategies require an unpractical
balancing of several poorly defined indicators. It is important to notice how mitigation and not suppression was the initial strategy proposed by the government in mid March, before a drastic u-turn towards
disease suppression induced by a tsunami of hospitalizations. Authors in Ref. [104] investigate the herd
immunity threshold. This is the fraction of the population with immunity (either acquired through infection or vaccination) needed to avoid disease resurgence. In a homogeneously mixed population this
fraction can be computed as 1 − 1/R0 . Assuming a R0 in the range of 2.5 the herd immunity would be
reached at 60%. The authors show that this threshold can be as low as 42% considering heterogeneity
in contact matrices and infection rates across age-brackets.
Finally, two articles studied NPIs in the context of African countries [99, 100]. Ref. [99] investigates
possible explanations behind the relative lack of COVID-19 cases in sub-Saharan Africa. Using data and
observations in Madagascar, which had a moderate peak in mid July, they considered three competing
explanations: i) low case detection ii) epidemiological differences due to climate, younger population,
lower population density and transportation infrastructure in rural areas iii) effective NPIs. Interestingly, the results, obtained via an age-stratified SEIR model, suggest that the epidemiological markers
of COVID-19 are consistent with those observed in other countries and that the observed pattern is
compatible with a low case detection, late case importation, and effective NPIs. Authors in Ref. [100]
study the evolution of COVID-19 and the effects of different types of NPIs in three African countries
selected from youngest to oldest average age: Niger, Nigeria, Mauritius. In doing so, they adopt an
age-stratified SEIR model modifying some of the parameters to better match the African context. In
particular, they shifted case severity and IFR to younger ages. The results show how general physical
distancing and self-isolation of symptomatic individuals, although important, might not be enough to

14

contain the virus without lockdown levels. Furthermore, shielding of high risk people is key to avoid
overflow of healthcare facilities.
Finally, one article investigates the possibility of waning immunity [105]. The compartmental structure
follows the SEIRS archetype where recovered might loose immunity and move back to the susceptible
compartment. The authors consider also the effects of NPIs by using time-varying transmission and
mortality rates. Furthermore they introduce a compartment P to account for individuals that protect
themselves from infection by adopting and complying with NPIs. They assume that susceptible move
to this compartment with a time-varying rate which is fitted and move out with another time-varying
parameter. The model is applied and fitted to the data from New York state. The results confirm the
efficacy of the NPIs put in place and warn about the possibility of endemic infections in case of wining
immunity.

4.3

Metapopulation models

Metapopulation models consider a number of sub-populations connected by means of human mobility.
In doing so, the disease dynamics inside each patch (sub-population) follow a compartmental model like
those described in the previous section, however sub-populations are now coupled by mobility flows.
Thus, these types of models allow to capture the geo-spatial spreading of a disease which is defined
by the dynamics within and across patches. In particular, metapopulation models can be represented
as networks in which nodes describe sub-populations and links the mobility flows between them. The
spreading of a virus is locally driven by the R0 which is function of the reaction dynamics within each
subpopulation. However, the global spreading is also dependent on the features of the mobility flows.
This introduces another threshold typically called invasion threshold [145]. Considering explicitly the
coupling between subpopulations allows to tackle broader set of questions respect to those amenable
in single populations. What are the effects of national and international travel bans? When and from
where the first cases have been imported? Local lockdowns are a good alternative respect to nation-wide
measures? What is the chance of international importation of cases? What are the most affected subpopulation and why? Furthermore, they allow to use importation and seeding events to estimate initially
unknown epidemic parameters such as R0 or the number of unascertained cases. These capabilities come
with some costs. Access to mobility data and increase of computational complexity of the model are the
two main aspects to consider. However, as we already saw data capturing historic as well as in near real
time human mobility are readily available at different geographical scales and the use of compartmental
models inside each subpopulation allows to scale up the models to hundreds of countries. On this point,
it is important to mention how the definition of subpopulations is highly variable according to the data
available or the goal of the research. They can describe neighborhoods of a city, cities, regions, countries
etc.
The papers that used a metapopulation approach in the sample under investigation here cover several
important angles such as the spatial heterogeneity of the pandemic due to local differences in the implementation of NPIs and/or features of population distributions [107, 115, 116], the first pandemic wave
and the efficacy of the measures put in place [108–112, 120], and reopening scenarios [106, 113, 114, 117].
Let’s dive in some details.
Ref. [116] proposes a metapopulation model in which subpopulations are the neighborhoods of the ten
largest metropolitan areas in the USA. The 98 million people in these can interact within each node
and/or visit a point of interest (POI) which might be a bar, hotel, gym etc.. The system is modeled
as a bi-partite network in which the two types of nodes are neighborhoods and POI. The authors built
the model leveraging hourly data extracted from mobile phone of users in the area (via SafeGraph).
The data is used to construct the mobility flows and coupling in the system. The resolution of the
data allows to factor in behavioral changes induced by the spreading of the virus. The model is fitted
considering real data from the area under investigation. The model includes only three free parameters:
i) transmission rates at POIs, ii) transmission rates in the neighborhoods and iii) the initial proportion
of exposed individuals. Rhe authors assume that disease dynamic follows a SEIR compartmental model.
Interestingly, the transition from S to E in each neighborhood ci is modeled as follows:


n
X
Sc (t)
λp (t)ωij (t) + Binom (Sci (t), λci (t))
(2)
N (Sci (t) → Eci (t), t) ∼ P ois  i
Nci j=1 j
where λpj (t) is the rate of infection in POI j, ωij (t) the number of individuals from neighborhood ci
visiting POI j at time t, and λci (t) the infection rate in that neighborhood at time t. Note how the authors
15

divided the infection dynamics explicitly considering events taking place in POIs and within each census
Ip (t)
area. Notably, the rate of infection in each POI is written as λpj (t) = βpj (t) Vpj (t) where the denominator
j
is the total number of visitors in j at each time and as usual β is the transmission rate. The authors
provide an expression for this rate considering it a function of the disease (which is one of the parameter
fitted), and the contacts within each POIs. The latter is modeled accounting for the physical area and the
average time people spend there. The rate of infection in each neighborhood is modeled similarly via the
force of infection. The results indicate that a small set of POIs are responsible for the large majority of
infections. Full served restaurants and hotels are on the top of the list. Furthermore, the model suggests
that reducing the time spent in POIs is more efficient that reducing the mobility across the board. The
authors find also heterogeneity in terms of infection rates in disadvantaged socio-economic groups which
are not able to reduce their mobility as others. In Ref. [115] authors built a metapopulation model
for 3142 US counties. The mobility flows up to mid March are taken from the official statistics while
those after are estimated from inter county mobility towards POIs from SafeGraph. In fact, historical
data is far from representative when top-down and bottom-up behavioral changes started to take off.
Interestingly, the infection dynamics are split between day and night time. The model, fitted from the
epidemic data of the counties more affected, shows a large heterogeneity in terms of the reduction of the
reproductive number across counties. Among several others, the different extent of NPIs implementation
is an explaining factor. Ref. [107] uses detailed cases data from China to study the link between the
shape of the epidemic curve and spatial features of cities. Interestingly, they found that the peakedness
of the epidemic is affected by population aggregation and heterogeneity in such as way that crowded
cities are affected by higher attack rates and longer epidemics. The observations can be explained by
considering the hierarchical structure of social contacts which are stratified in households, neighborhoods,
cities, prefectures etc. Densely populated areas have higher rates of connections across households hence,
given a level of NPIs aimed to cut such contacts, more dense areas will retain more connections across
subpopulations which will result in higher attack rates and longer epidemics. Authors of Ref. [108]
develop a metapopulation model at the level of prefectures in China. In doing so, they use a range of
datasets from Baidu to estimate mobility across subpopulations and contacts within them. The goal is to
quantify the effects of NPIs in the country. Interestingly, the model suggests that without interventions
the number of cases would have been 67-fold. Early detection and isolation of cases is more efficient than
overall travel restrictions and social distancing. Similar results, data and models in the context of China
have been obtained also in Refs. [109, 110]. Authors of Ref. [112] use the Global Epidemic and Mobility
model 10 to simulate the spreading of COVID-19 and quantify the impact of NPIs in Jordan. Details
of the model are reported below. Ref. [111] studies the case of France, Poland and Spain dividing the
countries in cells and adopting a cellular automata to model the transitions within and the movements
between cells. By considering time-varying transmission and mobility rate the authors confirm the
efficacy of the NPIs put in place in the countries, though they estimate a very large R0 = (8, 10.5).
Ref. [117] tackles the issue of reopening strategies after the first wave in Europe. In doing so, they
augment the mobility data reports from Google via much higher resolution mobility flows obtained
considering CDRs (call details records) from Vodafone in Spain and Italy. In particular, they develop
a linear model to rescale the data from Google considering CDRs to better capture key epidemiological
behaviors. Using such augmentation process across all countries in Europe they built a metapopulation
model at the NUTS3 resolution. The results indicate that a coordinated relaxation strategy is more
beneficial than an uncoordinated approach. Interestingly, coordinated intermittent lockdowns are found
to reduce by half the periods of stricter restrictions needed in case of isolated implementations. Ref. [113]
investigates the reopening scenario in Italy. In doing so, they built a metapopulation model at the level of
provinces. The mobility flows are taken from official statistics and are modified according to the estimate
obtained and shared in Ref. [40]. The dataset will be described in more details below. Accounting for the
NPIs put in place in Italy, they consider three values of β. The first two are constant across the country,
the last is allowed to be region dependent. Using a hierarchical framework they fit the model to the
epidemic data and then consider different reopening scenarios. The results show how an increase of 40% in
the effective rate, after the lockdown, would be enough to induce a disease resurgence and that detecting
and isolating around 5% of the daily exposed via aggressive testing would be enough to avoid a rebound
of the disease even relaxing NPIs. Ref. [106] uses a metapopulation approach considering all counties of
Ontario Canada. Mobility across subpopulation is estimated via a survey that mapped commuters in
region. They consider different transmission rates according to the health status (asymptomatic, presymptomatic, symptomatic) and allow a variability across subpopulations. The model is fitted to the data

and used to investigate different reopening approaches after the first wave. Interestingly, the results show
that local reopening are better. As cost function they use the person days of closure and number of cases.
They also observe that local measures might be better in the early stages of the epidemic if testing rates
are high and the threshold that triggers them is set to be low. Authors of Ref. [114] propose a theoretical
framework in which the transmission within, and reduction of mobility rates across, subpopulations of
a metapopulation network are obtained solving an optimal control problem where a possible goal could
be to avoid overflowing the healthcare system.
A subsets of papers use a metapopulation approach accounting also for the age-stratification and contact
matrices within each subpopulation. In this group we find papers that evaluate the risks of importation
of cases from China in the early phases of the pandemic [22], model the first wave [118, 120–122, 146]
and investigate reopening scenarios [106, 119].
Ref. [22] is an emblematic example of the types of questions a metapopulation model can answer during
the very uncertain initial phases of a pandemic. The authors used the Global Epidemic and Mobility
model [147–150] to understand the risk of importations of cases from China, estimate key epidemiological
parameters, and provide a more precise picture of the epidemic in the epicenter. The model is based
on three layers. The first describes the population distribution. The world is divided into over 3200
subpopulations constructed using a Voronoi tessellation of the Earth’s surface. Subpopulations are
centered around major transportation hubs (e.g., airports). They consist of cells with a resolution
of 15x15 arc minutes (approximately 25x25 Km). The population is estimated via high resolution
data [151]. The model accounts for other features of individual subpopulations, such as age specific
contact patterns, health infrastructure if available [152]. The second layer describes the mobility flows
across subpopulations. These are split in two: short-range (commuting patterns) and long-range (air
transportation). The final layer is the epidemic layer which is a compartmental model applied to each
subpopulation. The authors used an age-stratified SEIR model and adopted an Approximated Bayesian
Computation to estimate the posterior distribution of R0 given the observations of international case
importation from China. In other words, the authors used the cases that were popping out around the
world in the very early phase of the pandemic to define R0 compatible with such observations. After
fitting the model, the authors were also able to estimate the effects of NPIs on the pandemic. The results
indicate a R0 = 2.57 (CI 2.37-2.78) and suggest that the travel ban from/to Wuhan delayed the unfolding
of the epidemic in China of only 3 − 5 days. More significant were the estimated effects internationally,
though the model suggests an intense seeding that took place from Wuhan and other Chinese cities after
the travel ban. The results also indicate that features of the disease and the air transportation network
are such that a strong travel ban from/to China is not effective without sustained social distancing. It
is important to note how a first draft of this paper was posted on medrxiv in mid of February 2020.
At the moment the discussion outside China revolved around the possibility of containment, and on the
risk of a global pandemic. The metapopulation approach and the real data used to fed it allowed the
authors to provide a picture of the spatio-temporal diffusion and diffusion potential of the virus which
at that time was still highly debated. A similar model, without long-range mobility, has been proposed
to describe the first wave and the impact of NPIs in the metropolitan area of Santiago de Chile [118].
The model considers as subpopulation the municipalities of the capital of Chile and adopts data from
mobile phones to estimate the mobility flows as well as their changes induced by NPIs. The model
suggests that only the compound effects of subsequent measures was enough to suppress the epidemic.
Furthermore, the results confirm how even in this country individuals from municipalities characterized
by low Human Development Index (HDI) were not able to reduce their mobility as those living in high
HDI locations. As result of these socio-economic factors poor areas registered higher cases and deaths.
Authors of Ref. [121] built an age-structured metapopulation model for Sweden at the municipality level.
In doing so, they adopt the radiation model to estimate the mobility between subpopulations [153] before
and during the pandemic. They investigate different scenarios considering moderate to strong physical
distancing. The results indicate that the scenario closer to the observation is the one with moderated
physical distancing of people younger than 60, very strong distancing of those older than 60 as well
as a general awareness and compliance to home isolation if symptomatic. Hence, this confirms how
despite the lack of strict top-down NPIs respect to many other countries the Swedish population did
change behavior. Unfortunately the health outcome was still much worse than other nordic countries
which took a suppression rather than a mitigation approach. Ref. [122] proposes another age-stratified
metapopulation model for Georgia state (USA). The authors consider the state divided in small cells
(100m x 100m) which are the nodes of the metapopulation system. Mobility is modeled considering a
density function. The reduction of normal mobility due COVID-19 is estimated using the Facebook data.
While typically metapopulation models consider mobility at the aggregated level of compartment (e.g.,

17

how many exposed from node i travel to node j), authors here consider individual based travels and
infections. In doing so, they are able to study the role of super-spreaders events. The model, fitted to the
epidemic data via Bayesian inference, indicates that 2% of cases are responsible for 20% of infections and
that the reproductive number was reduced below the critical value after two weeks of the shelter in place
order. Also, infected non-elderly might be about three times more infectious than elderly thus driving
the super-spreading events. Authors in Ref. [120] introduce an age-stratified metapopulation model for
Spain. By using an Markov chain approach the authors are able to derive analytical expressions for the
reproductive number as function of different types of NPIs. Furthermore, they show how the model can
be calibrated to reproduce the observed evolution of the pandemic in the country.

4.4

Statistical models

The approaches described above model the spreading of infectious diseases mechanistically. Real epidemiological data is then used to constrain the phase space of parameters. Statistical models use assumptions
about the progression of the disease to write down mathematical expression linking, for example, the
number of cases at time t with those a time t − 1. Statistical inference approaches are then used to
determine the parameters modulating such relationships. A classic example is the statistical estimation
of R0 and/or Rt . While in compartmental models R0 is estimated looking at the difference between
observed cases/deaths and those simulated by the model, statistical approach target directly the data
estimating the parameters necessary to match the expected mathematical evolution of cases/deaths.
These approaches have been applied to the COVID-19 pandemic to gather information about the key
epidemiological parameters and quantify the effects of NPIs by looking at deviations from expected
and/or initial trends [24, 46, 123–126, 128–133]. Let’s dive into some details.
Ref. [24] uses a discrete renewal process to estimate Rt in 11 countries in Europe (Austria, Belgium,
Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK) and the effects of NPIs
of its evolution. The authors assume that the number of infections in a country m at time t can be
written as:
!
Pt−1
t−1
X
i=1 ci,m
Rt,m
cτ,m gt−τ
(3)
ct,m = 1 −
Nm
τ =0
where the first term on the r.h.s. estimates the fraction of the population still available for infection (not
already immune, or removed), Rt,m is the reproductive number regulating the growth of infections, and
g is the generation distribution describing the time between being infected and infecting. Hence, the
new number of infected individuals is function of how many have been infected in the past modulated
by the generation distribution and the average number of infections each of these is able to produce.
The authors consider six types of NPIs: school closures, self-isolation of symptomatic, banning of public
events, partial or complete lockdown, social distancing, and any other government intervention. They
then assume the effect of such interventions to be multiplicative and such that:
Rt,m = R0,m exp(−

P

k

αk δk,t,m −m δt,m )

(4)

where deltak,t,m indicates whether each intervention k is in place, αk is the effect of each intervention,
m is a country specific error term on the last intervention put in place by each country δt,m . The
parameters are fitted for all 11 countries in a single hierarchical model. The results show that the
portfolio of measures put in place was enough to suppress the epidemic. Lockdowns are found to be the
most significant NPIs in terms of variations to the Rt . Furthermore, the models suggest that across all
those countries a 3 − 4% of the population has been infected up to early May. The same model, extended
to consider more data such as hospitalizations and ICU patients, has been proposed for Slovenia [131].
The results suggest that the country has the smallest attack rate in Europe (0.3% of infected population)
and point to an IFR of 1.56%. A similar model has been also applied to the case of Brazil [124]. The
estimation of the Rt point to the fact that the measures put in place were not enough to suppress the
spreading, but were able to mitigate it. The authors consider also genomic data to shed light on the start
of the local epidemic. The results point to the fact that the majority of importations in the genomic
sample are linked to Europe and the local spreading was in place before the implementation of travels
bans. A model with the same approach has been also proposed in Ref. [133] to infer the effects of NPIs
in 41 countries in Europe as well as in other continents. Interestingly the results show how across the
board reduction of gatherings to ten or less, school closure and remote working had the largest impact
on the reproductive number. A model based on a renewal process has been also proposed in Ref. [123].

18

Authors define the reproductive number at time t for country m as:
Rt,m = R0,m exp−

P

k

αk δk,t,m

(5)

where here the δk,t,m describes the mobility index linked to type of places k (e.g., retail and recreation,
grocery and pharmacy, public transport, workplaces, home) at time t for country m estimated from the
Google mobility reports, and αk is the effects of movements and interactions in each type of place on
the disease spreading. The model is applied to 11 European countries and confirms the importance of
NPIs in the mitigation and suppression efforts. Interestingly, the model suggests that most significant
variations in mobility are linked to groceries and pharmacies. However, variations of mobility to all
categories of place are shown to be highly correlated with disease burden (measured in terms of deaths)
with a delay of one month. Authors in Refs. [46, 125, 128, 130] adopt and/or extend the approach
developed in [154, 155] to estimate Rt . This method is readily available in Python and R and
Pt is called
EpiEstim. In short, the total number of infectious at time t can be written as Λt (gs ) = s=1 It−s gs
where, as above, g is the discrete serial distribution. The expected number of infected can be written
as E(It |I0 , I1 , . . . , It−1 , gs , Rt ) = Rt Λt (gs ). Without going to the details, the approach assumes that the
number of case is extracted from a Poisson distribution providing an expression linking the probability of
observing a number of cases in a time window given the Rt . This allows to apply Bayesian inference from
data having as target Rt . Ref. [46] applies the approach to data from 190 countries and estimates the
effects of different NPIs. Interestingly they found social distancing to be the most efficient in reducing
the reproductive number followed by mandatory masks. Furthermore, they confirm that a portfolio of
measures is required to suppress the spreading. Similar results have been reported in Ref. [128] in the
context of Hong Kong. Beside estimating the effects of NPIs the authors report also the result of three
surveys which show high level of awareness and adoption of NPIs such as face mask and avoid crowded
places. Finally, EpiEstim has been used also to model the impact of NPIs in several cities in China [125].
The results highlight the effectiveness of the aggressive NPIs strategy put in place and point to a very
different confirmed case fatality ratio in Hubei and outside. In the epicenter of the pandemic it appears
to be five times higher than outside. Authors in Ref. [127] adopt a state transfer matrix model, which
similarly to compartmental models, to describe the different states of individuals that got in contact
with the virus. Hence, this model could be classified as a compartmental model. However as it does
not match directly any archetype I opted to add it to this category. The model is fitted to data from
China, Iran, Italy and South Korea with the aim to characterize the impact of NPIs in those countries
and project possible attack rates.

4.5

Agent-based models

Agent-based models push the mechanistic approach to its limit. In fact, they simulate the spreading
of disease reproducing, to different extents, key aspects of the society where the disease is spreading.
In particular, classic epidemiological agent-based models are based on a synthetic population that is
built considering empirical socio-demographic features such as households sizes and compositions. A key
aspect for the spreading of diseases are social contacts which are built accounting for socio-economic
activities such as school, work places, and other types of activities. The nature of agent-based models
requires a much wider range of data necessary to build the synthetic population and its interactions.
The computational costs associated are also much more significative. A large body of literature has
been devote to study the effects of considering real social contact networks on the spreading of infectious
diseases [142, 143]. These agent-based models do not typically account for all societal details such as
households, schools and work places. As such they are not typically used to make accurate predictions
but rather to develop a better understanding of how the features of real contact networks might affect the
unfolding of a virus. They have been used to quantify the effects of contact tracing, isolation, vaccination
campaigns among other things.
In the sample of papers under review here, we find full fledged agent-based models used to model the
COVID-19 and the effects of NPIs at the levels of countries, regions, or cities [63, 66, 134, 136, 137, 156].
We also find more theoretical approaches modeling particular aspects of NPIs such as different strategies
for isolation [135, 138, 139].
Authors in Ref. [156] propose an agent-based model for France with the aim to understand the efficiency
of different NPIs in the reopening phases after the first wave. This is a text book example of this category
of models. The first important point to mention is the complexity of the approach which is exemplified
by the number of parameters: 194 in total. The majority (140) are to describe the socio-demographic
features of the french population, 33 are to model the contact networks, 21 to describe the features of
19

the virus. 192 were obtained either from the literature or from sensible assumptions. The two remaining,
which describe the contamination risk per minute per m2 of contact and the fraction of undiagnosed
cases, have been fitted to mortality data. In the model households are assigned to a square grid. These
are built considering a stratification which include age and gender to reproduce the french population.
Furthermore, comorbidities (e.g., diabetes, obesity, different chronic diseases) are also taken into account.
The contact network is built taking into consideration several types of interactions taking place at home,
in school, work, as well as during other locations such as groceries. The construction of such synthetic
population allows to model with high resolution several NPIs such as reopening of particular activities
or isolation approaches. The results, which where published in July, paint quite a grim picture which
unfortunately has been later confirmed: measures in place after the strict lockdown is lifted are not
enough to avoid the overwhelming of the healthcare system. A similar approach has been proposed in
Ref. [136]. The authors use high resolution data describing the movements and potential interactions
of people in Boston. They build a multilayer synthetic population which model the socio-demographic
features of Bostonians, their movements and possible interactions in different locations (i.e., households,
workplaces, schools etc). The authors use the model to investigate the impact of different reopening
scenarios. The results suggest that aggressive testing and household isolation could allow to reopen
economic activities while keeping the health care facilities protected from overflow of cases. Ref. [137]
presents an agent-based model for the metropolitan areas of New York and Seattle. They model is
informed with mobile phone data collected from about 700, 000 users by Cuebiq. The authors, similar to
what done for Boston, built a weighted layered network capturing interactions in the community, schools,
work places, and households. Furthermore, they use foursquare data to identify POIs. The results show
the impact of NPIs in the two cities, provide information about the risk of infection according to the type
of locations visited and estimate the size of transmission chains. In the same line with what reported
above, the results suggest that the large majority of infections (80%) are due to a small minority of
individuals (27%). Despite the big role played by large social event, the authors found that work places,
restaurants, and grocery stores are the main drivers of the observed patterns. Authors of Ref. [134]
propose an agent-based model to study the spreading of COVID-19 in Hubei, Lombardy (Italy), and
New York City. The model nicely show how the details can be adapted to the goal and data available. The
authors built synthetic populations form by n individuals stratified for age, comorbidities and assigned to
a household. Contacts are divided in two category: inside and outside households. Contacts in different
contexts than home are modeled via contact matrices. The free parameters are fitted to data using a
Bayesian framework. The results show how the efficacy of NPIs aimed at limiting contacts across age
brackets vary according to the location under study. This suggests how a one fit all strategy might not be
optimal and measures should be tailored to the specific socio-demographic features of each populations.
Authors in Ref. [66] use a network-based model where a representative sample of different cities interacts
via a contact network. The authors model interactions within and across cities. These are modeled as
clustered networks. Links inside each community are extracted from a configuration model. Links across
communities assume an homogenous random graph. Connections between cities are built considering
real data from Baidu. Since the units of the model are individuals, the number of travelers from city i
and j are assigned randomly to nodes in i. These form a number of connections, which is the average in
the system, with random nodes in j. The population is scaled down to reduce the computational costs.
This model does not consider explicitly the stratification of individuals in households, school or work
locations. The results obtained confirm the importance of NPIs in controlling the pandemic in China.
Authors in Ref. [139] propose an agent-based framework where beside individuals, agents describe houses,
business, government, and the health care system. Each type of agent is assigned with a set of features
and enabled to take a set of actions. The framework allows for the implementation of a range of NPIs
and measure the impact in terms of disease and economic burden.

Surveys

The seismic impact of COVID-19 on our society has dramatically boosted the study of non-pharmaceutical
interventions via explicit observations: surveys. This methodology allows to gather ground truth data
by asking specific questions to a sample of the population rather than inferring answers from proxy data.
Hence, they are a powerful tool to understand and measure causal links. In the era of big-data surveys
might look old fashion and surpassed. However they are still an invaluable approach to characterize
complex processes. The sample size is typically an issue castings doubts about the external validity of
the findings. However, modern technology and having a larger part of the population stuck at home in
front of a screen due to lockdowns offered the opportunity to reach large numbers of participants quite

most represented publication venues of the category. To improve visibility I am showing only countries
featured at least in two studied and journals featuring at least two articles
easily.
Before diving into the observations and results of this large body of research, let me spend few words
to characterize the subset. First of all, it is interesting to notice how the surveys have been answered
by participants in 85 countries. While in the large majority of cases the survey targeted a specific
country, four surveys were done in two countries, two in five, one was extended to participants in 59
countries. Second, the most represented country is USA, followed by Italy and China. This top three
is not surprising. China was the epicenter of the pandemic. Italy was the first country in Europe to be
affected by the virus. USA is a powerhouse of scientific production and one of the most affected countries
in the pandemic. In Fig.3 I report a histogram considering, to improve the readability, just countries
featured in more than one single study. All continents, except Antartica, are represented. Third, 41
countries are found in the affiliations of this group of papers. USA, Italy, China and the UK are at the
top of the list. Fourth, the research has been published in 65 different journals (including 2 preprint in
the medRxiv not yet published elsewhere). The most represented journals are International Journal of
Environmental Research and Public Health, Frontiers in Psychology, Frontiers in Public Health, PLoS
ONE and the Journal of Medical Internet Research (see Fig. 3). It is interesting to stress the diversity
of the set of publication venues that ranges from Nature Human Behavior and Science to Journal of
Medical Internet Research and Seizure. This, still limited sample, highlights the breadth of research on
the subject. Finally, these papers have been written by more than 131 authors and, as of December 19th
they received 192 citations. See Fig. 3 for more details.

5.1

Classification

After inspecting all the articles and considering their focus, I have assigned each survey to one of five
categories. In particular:
1. Health and wellbeing indicators: surveys aimed at monitoring, measuring or access the impact
of NPIs on health and wellbeing;
21

2. Adoption and awareness of NPI: surveys aimed characterizing the adoption of NPIs identifying
the key factors influencing changes in behaviors;
3. Changes in medical practice: describes studies focused on accessing the impact of NPIs on
patients and health care;
4. Effects of NPI: surveys set out to understand the impact of NPIs on a range of human activities;
5. Contacts: surveys aimed at quantifying the effects of NPIs on human contacts.
It is important to mention that similar topics will be found also in other types of study described in
other sections. However, those don’t rely on primary data collection methods but on data proxies. In
other words, they use data that have been collected for other uses as proxy for behavioral markers.
In Table 5.1 I report the full list of references organized according the taxonomy I have created. Furthermore, I have grouped the research considering the sample size and the country or countries from where
the participants where recruited. Now, we are ready to dive into each subcategory.

5.2

Health and wellbeing indicators

This body of research aims to characterize the effects of NPIs on i) mental health, ii) health behaviors,
and iii) patients. These constitute three subcategories. Let’s discuss them in order.
It interesting to notice the variety of angles and aspects covered in the surveys on mental health. In
fact, they consider loneliness [163, 171, 173], domestic abuse [169], psychological mindset [26, 157–
159, 162, 164, 165, 167, 168], as well as particular groups of the population studying the toll on frontline
workers [160], students [172, 174], parents and children [161, 166, 170, 175]. Several common themes as
well as some conflicting results emerged from this research. When it comes to loneliness age, gender,
and perceived concerns about the pandemic appear to be important factors. In particular, younger
individuals, especially female, reported a larger increase in loneliness respect to adults [173]. However, a
direct comparison between participants in the 60 − 70 and 70+ age brackets show that the older group
felt more lonely [171]. Hence, loneliness appears not to be a monotone function of age. Very young
and older age classes are more affected by it. Furthermore, loneliness increases more for those reporting
greater concerns about the pandemic. However, it is important to notice that while two surveys found
an increase of loneliness during the first wave [171, 173], another reported no significant variations from
January to April [163]. One survey focused on the effect of NPIs on domestic abuse [169]. The study
considers a sample of 687 women living in Jordan contacted via Whatsup. Tragically 40% reported
same level of domestic abuse during the health emergency. Being unemployed and married were the
most important features linked to abuse. In terms of psychological mindset of participants living under
some type of NPIs country of residence, age, gender relationship status, living arrangements, income,
and education are important factors [26, 157–159, 162, 165, 167, 168]. In fact, a study conducted by
recruiting participants in 59 countries reports that socio-demographic features, having had symptoms,
mobility restrictions, and having had issues transitioning to remote work or an increase of conflict at
home explain around 20% of the variance in depression and anxiety [158]. Another survey estimates panic
in 79% of participants and found being older than 30, educated, married, and living with a joint family
to be predictors of it [159]. In contrast, a survey conducted in Serbia found that worry, fear, boredom,
anger, and annoyance decreased in time during the first wave [165]. Adherence to NPIs and exposure
to media were linked to positive effects on worry and fear. Similarly, a survey aimed at capturing the
effect of NPIs on five factor personality traits found that during the crisis neuroticism went down [162].
The authors speculate that this trend is due to the progression of the pandemic rather than to peoples’
personality.
The second subcategory describes surveys aimed at capturing the impact of NPIs on a range of health
behaviors such as sleep, physical activity, sex, and substance use. Two studies on children noted how
COVID-19 restrictions led to less physical activity and sleep disturbances but to more screen and sleeping
time [176, 184]. The findings hint to a complex picture with some positive and negative effects of home
confinement. Physical activity and changes in sleeping patterns have been reported also in the adult
population [177–180, 185]. A sample of more than 9000 participants in the UK provides some hints about
the magnitude of physical activity variation before and during the lockdown [178]. While 64% reported
to have kept similar levels of activity, 25% did less and 11% increased. Overall, the surveys on the subject
highlight high BMI, depression, health conditions, gender (being female), and high risk perception as
features connected to larger decrease of physical activity [178, 179]. Being an essential worker negatively
impacted lifestyle [185]. Social distancing and stay home orders affected also other health behaviors

such as sex and substance use. Two surveys done in Australia and USA show how NPIs have led to
drastic reduction of sex with occasional partners and an increase of porn consumption [182, 186]. Alcohol
consumption, above the drinking limits, has reported to increase during NPIs [183]. Similarly, medicinal
use of cannabis has increased among individuals with mental health conditions and 16% affirmed to have
changed to route of administration shifting away from smoking [181].
The tsunami of COVID-19 cases that flooded health care facilities had a drastic impact also on patients
affected by other conditions. Several surveys aimed at provide a better understanding of this unfortunate
phenomenon. They considered patients affected by diabetes, cancer, ALS, hypertension, mental or
substance abuse disorders [187–193]. Admittedly, the research focused on short term effects and on the
shift towards telemedicine (i.e., remote care). A study conducted in Italy on diabetic patients revealed
their good resilience and adaptation to technology [190]. However, a similar research done in Japan
hints to a negative impact of reduced physical activity on glycemic control [189]. A cohort of patients
affected by cancer in Germany showed levels of stress and anxiety similar to a control [188]. Drastic
reduction of physical activity, with potentially detrimental effects, has been reported for adults with
hypertension [192].

5.3

Adoption of NPIs

Several interesting themes emerge from the surveys aimed at understanding the factors driving the
adoption of NPIs. First of all, across several countries and in different studies gender appears to be a
key factor. In fact, female respondents are found more likely to perceive COVID-19 as a risk, agree and
comply with NPIs [194, 196, 199, 211, 217]. Similar trends are observed for individuals with high level
of education [199, 214]. Age again does not appear to be a monotonic function: very young and old
individuals share similar trends. In fact, young adults have reported a smaller decrease in mobility and
old individuals less compliance to NPIs (especially if male) [211, 217]. It is important to mention that
age was not a relevant factor in a survey conducted in Germany [199]. The research points also to a big
urban-rural divide and thus to the importance of socio-economic factors when it comes to compliance.
In fact, several barriers to NPIs have been reported in peri-urban and rural areas in India [201, 202, 213].
Individuals living in urban settings report a better knowledge about COVID-19 and better opportunities
to adopt hygienic behaviors. The country of residence also seems to play a role when it comes to the trust
level towards media during the emergency which might influence adoption. A cohort in Jordan reported
a positive influence, especially on the awareness levels [200]. However, a survey in Slovenia, done with 48
of the first confirmed case, points to low level of trust of the media and shows that perceived credibility of
information linked to lower levels of negative emotional response and higher adherence to NPIs [204]. A
survey conducted in South Korea compared the adoption of NPIs during COVID-19 with results obtained
during the spread of MERS-CoV [216]. Interestingly social distancing and practicing other transmission
reducing behaviors increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic. The subset of participants
with a higher perception of risk was found to be more likely to adopt NPIs in both. Interestingly, several
surveys confirm the expectation coming from the health belief model pointing to the fact that knowledge
about the disease and perceived risks are predictors behavioral changes [197, 203, 205, 207, 213–215].
The adoption of face masks has been found to be negatively affected by perception of shortage in New
Zealand [205], and positively influenced by national guidelines in the USA [210]. Ref. [195] analyzes
the dataset collected from half millions of users that installed the platform for digital surveillance called
How We Feel. The app collects a range of demographic, symptoms, and behavioral data such as use of
masks and social distancing practices. Though the aim of the paper is to investigate wether the data
collected can be used to estimate risk factors and exposure to the virus, it provides interesting insights
about the behavior of the sample in terms of NPIs. The majority (61%) of users reported to have left
home despite the stay at home orders. Only 19% of these attributed to work the reason to leave home.
Of this subset of people that left home the majority reported to practice social distancing and wearing
face masks. Though still a significant fraction did not. A minority of users reported that, despite testing
positive, they went to work sometime without wearing a mask. Healthcare and essential workers were
more likely to go to work after testing positive. Though, people who tested positive, reported a clear
reduction of contacts respect to those that were untested or tested positive.

5.4

Changes on medical practice

How did medical practice change to cope with NPIs and COVID-19? A very interesting subset of surveys
provides some answers from both patients and doctors. I have identified three subcategories which refer

24

to mental health, oncology and other medical specialties.
A survey among psychotherapists in Austria revels that the decrease of face-to-face appointments was
not necessarily linked to an increase of remote sessions [218]. Similarly, another in Italy reports the needs
for more health care support [219]. Even more concerning are the results of a survey that pooled participants in 29 countries [220]. These are the caregivers of individuals with intellectual and developmental
disabilities. The majority, 74%, reported that they lost access to at least one therapy. The majority nevertheless, 56%, was able to keep services though 36% reported to have lost healthcare provider.
Across several surveys, telemedicine has been found to be useful [220, 222, 226]. Though, socio-economic
disparities, linguistic disadvantage, and health issues have been reported as challenges of remote care. It
is also interesting to notice the perception of telemedicine among practitioners [221, 223]. Rapid transitions towards it, reduce revenue and modification of communication linked to it have been reported as
challenges [223]. Furthermore, the judgment of the transition appears to be function of the number of
patients supported [221].
In the second subcategory we have two surveys dealing with changes in oncology care. The first used
Whatsup to explore the topic covered in discussions between patients and doctors. The most common
themes that emerged cover delays with care, queries about immunosuppression, and variation of lifestyle
or activities [228]. The second survey was conducted in 21 oncological care institutions in 10 countries.
Remote triage before visits was implemented by 90% of centers. Adoption of PPE was used across the
board and only few clinical instrumental examination were performed. Telemedicine was adopted by
76% and separated pathways for COVID-19 positive and negative patients were put in place. Return to
work policies required a negative test in 76% of centers.
In the third and final subcategory we find surveys targeting both patients and practitioners in a variety of
specializations. From remote management of geriatric patients with heart conditions [231] and the effects
of NPIs on transplant recipients/donors [232] to the changes adopted by several hospitals in academic
centers [234], hearing and emergency care [230, 233]. Overall the observations on patients point to the
interim efficacy of telemedicine and to high level of awareness about the risk of infection. The findings
on medical practices highlight the drastic changes and adaption put in place to cope with the pandemic.
Marked reduction of in person visits, stockpile of PPE and use of respiratory isolation units have been
reported. Remarkably, in one study 46% of practitioners reported examples of non-COVID-19 diagnoses
in patients admitted for COVID-19 evaluation and vice versa highlighting the challenges induced by the
virus to the health care system [234].

5.5

Effect of NPIs

This group of surveys captures the impact of NPIs of a range of human activities such as i) leisure, ii)
education, iii) mobility, and iv) consumption.
Due to social distancing, travel limitation, and stay home orders the possibility for leisure has been dramatically reduced. A survey done in a cohort of around 4500 participants in 25 countries investigate the
impact on bird watchers [238]. A large majority, 85%, changed behavior reducing traveling and targeting
local spots. They reported also a significant change in social interactions. The increase of time spent
inside has induced variations in the locations selected when going outside [237]. Walking paths have
been changed to include urban gardens, tree lined streets and traveling by car in green areas. In others
words, the confinement has boosted the interest and value of nature. The stop of many sport events and
leagues has impacted also gambling [239]. While sport gambling has dropped, the attention has been
shifted towards other forms. The gambling habits of the majority of 2000 respondent to another survey
reported did not report a change in gambling habit [236]. However, the minority that did was affected by
gambling problems and reported an increase in alcohol consumption. The toll of NPIs on sport activities
has been quite significant for elite athletes [241, 242]. Level of stress and anxiety have been observed,
especially among women, and linked to worries about the future of the sport. A survey conducted in
South Korea links the tendencies towards keeping practicing sport with the perception of risk and worry
about getting infected [240]. Age and the type of sport were found to play a modulating role.
Educational activities have been also altered. Like in many other sectors the need for physical distancing
required drastic shifts in the delivery of classes as well as on research production. A survey conducted in
China extended to parents, students and teachers point to the fact that while online teaching was positively valued, parents and teachers were found to be more concerned about the possible side effects [243].
A survey delivered in a cohort of students in Jordan aimed to understand the impact of remote learning
and in particular on online exams [244]. A sizable fraction of students (32%) reported more stress linked
to this exam mode. Navigation of questions and technical issues were reported to be main drivers of

25

stress. Furthermore, online exams appeared to affect negatively eating habits, sleep, physical activity
and led to increase in smoking. A study conducted on principal investigators in USA and Europe, point
how NPIs, despite the reduction of activities outside home, have reduced the time spent doing research
especially for female scientists, those in experimental fields and with young children [245].
As we will see in more details later, one of the most explored aspect of non-pharmaceutical interventions
is mobility. Beside the interest in the way population adapted movements/travels, characterizing variations in mobility is key to model the spreading of the virus. As result, we will speak about NPIs and
mobility in several sections. Though the aim will be the same, what changes is the methodology used
to characterize changes in mobility. Here, we report two studies done with cohort of 2000 individuals in
Germany [246] and more than 1000 people in five European countries [247]. In both cases, smartphone
apps were used to collected information about mobility (distance travelled, steps count) as well as other
indicators (heart rate, sleep duration, bedtime, social app use). The results point to a drastic reduction
of distance travelled (more than half in the lockdown period) [246]. The reduction did not cease immediately after the end of lockdown. Age and gender groups behaved similarly, reporting a consistent
relative variation respect to pre lockdown period. Reduction of steps and increase homestay have been
reported also outside Germany [247]. Furthermore, use of phone and social media apps have increased.
Consistently with what mentioned above, sleeping patterns have been altered. More sleep and later bed
time have been reported [247].

5.6

Contacts

NPIs are designed to reduce transmission chains. Hence, several targeted directly or indirectly social
contacts. Different surveys have been designed and deployed to capture the effect of NPIs on contacts
and thus estimating the impact on the disease spreading. A survey conducted in Wuhan and Shanghai
during the outbreak revealed a reduction of factor 7 − 8 of social contacts [25]. Using this data together
with information about contact tracing the authors estimated, via an epidemic model, this reduction
was enough to contain the spreading. Another survey conducted, considering also data after the end of
the lockdown in China, shows that the relaxation of NPIs brought an 5 − 17% increase in social contacts
which are anyway 3 − 7 times lower than pre-pandemic values and still below the levels associated to
disease resurgence. A similar study conducted during the lockdown in the UK report a consistent, though
smaller, reduction contacts (a factor 4) [27]. Nevertheless the change was enough to push the R0 below
the critical threshold of one.

Comments and/or perspectives

A significative fraction of the sample can be classified as comments and/or perspectives. Here researchers
reflect on future challenges, point out opportunities, summarize findings and approaches developed in the
fight against COVID-19. In doing so, they do not necessarily present new analysis or findings. Rather,
the goal is to highlight key aspects, draw the attention to specific points, critically discuss evidence,
questions assumptions as experts in the field.
Before summarizing this body of work, let me spend few words to provide a general description of
it. While the large majority of articles provide a general outlook to a specific topic, some draw from a
specific context. In fact, we find 6 comments focused from observations in USA [252–257], 3 in Italy [258–
260], 2 in Canada [261, 262] and the UK [263, 264]. We have then articles that focus on Africa [265],
China [266], Ethiopia [267] , France [259], Poland [268], Taiwan [269], Vietnam [270],South Korea [271]
and Singapore [272]. Comments and perspectives have been written by researchers with affiliations in
36 (see Fig. 4). The most represented countries are USA, UK, and Italy. Finally, this research has
been published in 50 journals (including one preprint in medrxiv). Really a wide range of publication
avenues ranging from journals focusing on pediatric psychology to interdisciplinary journals such as
Science Advances. The most representative journals, each with two comments/perspectives, are BMC
Medicine, Journal of Addiction Medicine, Journal of Travel Medicine and Science. These papers have
been written by more than 420 authors and received more than 1049 citations. A median of 4 citations
per article.

6.2

Change to medical practice

This is the largest group of comments and/or perspectives. We find articles focused on a range of
medical specialities: mental health care [253, 256, 260, 272–274], emergency care [275, 276], substance
abuse [252, 262, 277–279], oncological care [263, 280], health care practices [254, 258, 261, 281–283],
pediatric care [282, 284], and other care [255, 259, 267, 285–287].
Ref. [256] draws on the experience developed when counseling patients suffering from anxiety disorders
in one of the worst hit region in the USA during the first wave: New York City. The observations
highlight how the changes in behaviors induced by NPIs shifted the sense of familiarity, predictability or
daily activities towards the unknown and drastically limited social support. The variation of ordinary
routine is linked to increase distress. Social support, which is one of the key pillars of well-being, has
been also challenged by the closure of activities, and social distancing. The article calls for establishing
new routines and to make efforts to keep high level of social engagements. Authors in Ref. [274] reflect
on the challenges linked to mental health care delivery in the context of social distancing. While the
needs to move a portion of the services remotely are clear, the authors call a for diversification of the
offer that includes in-person visits for patients that might lack the technology required for tele-health,

Table 4: Summary of the comments and/or perspective in the sample. The first column describes the
category of each article in this group. The second, the topics and references
digital interventions, community outreach, family support and national warm lines. Authors in Ref. [276]
tackle the practical issues of social distancing in the challenging context of emergency departments. A
wide range of standard procedures and workflows have been drastically changed to limit the changes of
transmission between patients and health workers. Authors in Ref. [277] highlight the opportunities of
digital phenotyping via smartphones to reduce the limitations induced by NPIs during the pandemic in
substance abuse care. The authors point to the use of such technology, which can be used at scale, for
early detection of possible issues thus targeting the limited resources and reducing risks. In the context
of oncologic care (in particular pancreatic cancer) Ref. [263] presents a discussion of the variations put
in place by UK clinicians. The article, recommends for prioritization of specific treatments, strategies
to postpone surgical procedures, and for approaches that limit hospital visits. Ref. [258] proposes a set
of measures in hospitals to reduce the risks of infection in patients and health workers. Authors call
for aggressive and periodic testing of practitioners, use of appropriate PPE and air filtering systems,
suspensions of surgical training and experimental treatments among other things. Authors in Ref. [282]
discuss the changes to care in pediatric settings. They acknowledge the key role of telemedicine, discuss
the opportunities, barriers, and call for future research aimed at characterize the possible short and long
term effects of this change in care. Finally, Ref. [267] describes the effects of NPIs on veteran care in
the USA. Thanks to the efforts already in place, the transition to telemedicine in this context has been
reported to be quick and efficient. Nevertheless, also in this case, the authors call for future studies
aimed at measuring the short and long term effects of such variation in care especially in mental health.

6.3

Modeling

Several comments and/or perspectives focus on different aspects of modeling COVID-19 dynamics and
NPIs. In particular, we find articles discussing epidemic modeling efforts [28, 264, 288–292], analyzing
known and unknowns of transmission dynamics [293–297], presenting opportunities to model and control
the spreading of COVID-19 enabled by novel data streams such as mobile phone data [29], and discussing
the challenges in Rt estimation [257].
Ref. [290] discusses the main challenges in developing epidemic models for COVID-19. From highlighting the differences between “peace” and “war” modeling due to lack of data and a fluid landscape of
knowledge about the virus under study in the middle of a pandemic, to the importance and challenges
of considering super-spreading events. Authors in Ref. [291] reflect on the key role played by predictive
modeling in the emergency stressing the wide range of methodologies that have been put in place as
well as the key challenges ahead to develop standard metrics to measure their performance. Authors in
Ref. [293] provide an overview of the engines responsible for the spreading of SARS-CoV-2. Contacts
in households, presence of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission as well as super-spreading
events are considered as key factors. The importance of understanding and capturing super-spreading
events to accurately model and suppress COVID-19 is also matter of discussion in Ref. [295]. Ref. [29]
discusses the opportunities and challenges offered by mobile phone data to inform, guide, and help designing NPIs policies during the different phases of a pandemic. In the early phases, mobile phone data
can be fundamental to help standard surveillance efforts aimed at fast detection of cases and possible
28

exposed contacts. During the exponential growth phase, when the shields of NPIs are lifted as response,
mobile phone data can be crucial to monitor mobility reduction at the population level thus quantifying
the effectiveness of the measures as well as to inform realistic epidemic models (as we saw in previous
sections). After the peak, this type of data can be crucial to help contact tracing, identify with the
help of epidemic models risks of hotspots of local disease resurgence. While these opportunities are real
and they come with serious challenges. In fact, the authors note how the lack of a widespread use of
this data as a go-to tool to face epidemic spreading is linked to several problems. Lack of a “digital
mindset” of key institutions, reluctance of corporations collecting the data to share it, privacy concerns,
the “academic mindset” which often does not allow to formulate solutions in relevant actionable terms,
remain challenges for to tackle in the future. Finally, as we saw in the section about statistical epidemic
model, the estimation of Rt is a classic approach to characterize the unfolding of infectious diseases. The
authors of Ref. [257] discuss several methods and, by using synthetic data, present possible practical
challenges that might bias the results. Interestingly, they suggest the adoption of EpiEstim (which we
discussed above) and recommend against other methods which either use data after the time t (so can
be used only retrospectively) or are prone to biased estimates if the underlying assumptions do not hold.

6.4

Effect of NPIs

This category captures comments and/or perspectives discussing the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions on specific groups such as children [30, 298], on education [268, 299] or other activities such
as gambling [300] and food [303], on other diseases [266], the environment [301, 302], the corporate
world [304] and porn consumption [305].
Ref. [298] discusses the issues children face while confined at home during lockdowns. The authors
suggest parenting strategies that structure the day in a set of activities with assigned roles and adopt
technology to keep them socially connected. Authors in Ref. [30] highlight the behavioral and emotional
disorders in children as result of the pandemic. Ref. [268] addresses the effectiveness of e-learning for
medical students. The observations from a cohort of students in Poland showcase the effectiveness of
the technology that allows to meet several learning outcomes but point out the limitations to reach
others linked to practical skill development which is key for doctors. Authors of Ref. [303] reflect on the
effects of NPIs, in particular those that increase the time spent at home and limit physical activities,
on food consumption. The authors introduce the concept of covibesity to highlight the possible negative
consequences of home confinement: increase of take away orders, food and alcohol consumption. They
also reflect on the marketing shifts of the food industry which has leveraged the increased time spent
online boosting online advertising in particular for children. Authors in Ref. [266] discuss how the strict
NPIs put in place in China have also reduced the burden of influenza. In fact, social distancing and
increase hygiene are key factors which might interrupt transmission chains of a range of viruses beside
COVID-19. Ref. [301] highlights one of the silverlining of NPIs put in place to curb the spreading of
COVID-19: global reduction of mobility and thus a much smaller fingerprint on the environment. The
authors point to the fact that positive change to the environment are proven to be possible and hope for
behavioral changes in this direction even after the end of the pandemic. Ref. [304] discusses the reaction
of leadership in the corporate world to systemic crises such as COVID-19. The results from interviews
and observations highlight how in crisis times leaders tend to be guided by compassion and how the scale
of the crisis might help leaders to question what really matters which might help them to better capture
the ethos of the company. Finally Ref. [305] reflects on the increase in porn consumption due to NPIs,
the possible negative effects associated with it and call for future studies investigating this phenomenon.

6.5

Lifting NPIs

Four articles provide a perspective about the relaxation of NPIs in different countries and contexts [265,
270], reflecting on the risks of a second wave [306], and on the challenges children going back to school
after a long period of isolation face [307].
Ref. [265] details the challenges faced by African countries when relaxing NPIs. In fact, the limited
resources and the specific contexts of each country in the continent might impede adequate testing,
contact tracing, and adoption of NPIs to avoid a rebound of infections. The authors warn about the
grim consequences of other COVID-19 waves and call for efforts similar to those in place to flight HIV,
TB, and malaria. Authors in Ref. [306] discuss the differences between mitigation and suppression
which we have presented above. They argue that suppression approaches based on lockdowns are to be
preferred to mitigation strategies and how they might provide the time necessary to build up the testing

29

and contact tracing infrastructure to avoid disease resurgence. The article published in July warned
about the lack of such infrastructure despite the relaxation of measures in most countries and how this
might lead to a second wave. The warning unfortunately manifested to be a well poised concern.

6.6

Success stories

While most of the countries in the world have not met the challenges posed by COVID-19 and saw
multiple significant waves of infection as well as lockdowns, few managed to suppress the virus effectively.
South Korea and Taiwan are examples. Their experience and lessons learnt have been focus in two
perspectives [269, 271]. In both cases the strategy revolved on early actions, rapid development of
testing capabilities, aggressive contact tracing, social distancing and high adoption of face masks.

Quantifying the effects on NPIs

Non-pharmaceutical interventions are not a monolith. By now it should be clear how they refer to a
wide range of measures. A first binary classification can be used to split them according to whether
they emerge bottom-up as voluntary reactions of the population or whether they are pushed top-down
by authorities. In the first class, we find spontaneous use of face covering, increased hygiene, changes of
diet, avoidance of transportation, social gatherings and more in general social distancing. In the second
we find border closures, travel constraints, school closures, curfews, lockdowns, stay at home orders, the
mandate use of face covering among others. While we were quite familiar with the first type, for example
during a particularly aggressive seasonal flu, the second, often draconian, measures came as a surprise
for many since they are real social and economical nuclear options. It is important to mention how in
reality the difference between the two is not a clear cut and, in a complex landscape as the COVID19 emergency, they might be concurrent. Furthermore, the spatio-temporal unfolding of the virus, the
sequence of events, economic and social pressure, political ideologies, and past experiences with similar
health emergencies induced high level of heterogeneities in the response, visible not only across but within
countries. As mentioned above, while Italy was shutting down in an unprecedented national lockdown,
the UK was opting for a mitigation strategy (to develop herd immunity) rather that acting to suppress
the virus. The subsequent wave of hospitalizations and deaths forced a u-turn. New Zealand, Singapore,
Taiwan, Vietnam, and South Korea are all countries that acted early and aggressively. Many of them
did not even had the luxury of being affected later respect to others.
The articles in this section aim to understand, measure and quantify the efficacy of different NPIs in
the mitigation/suppression of COVID-19. Some investigate their impact on the unfolding of COVID19. Others focus on a range of behaviors beside those directly targeted by the interventions, variations
induced on medical practice, and financial markets (see Table 7.1). It is important to mention how a
large part of the first subgroup could be also classified as epidemic models. In fact, some measure the
evolution of Rt and others use compartmental models. These papers however aim at singling out the
impact on NPIs on the spreading, thus I thought to highlight them here.
As usual, before diving in the research, let me say few words about the sample of papers. They report
analysis and observations from 149 countries. In fact, while many of them focus on a particular country,
others consider a wide range of them. USA, China and Italy are again at the top of the list (see Fig. 5).
The 405 authors of the articles in this category are affiliated with institutions from 27 countries. USA,
China, and the UK are the most represented. Furthermore, the research has been published in 32 journals
ranging from PNAS and Nature Human behavior to Lancet Oncology and JAMA. The most represented
journals are the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health and Science. As of
December 19th these paper received 2126 citations.

Classification

The sample of papers studying the impact of NPIs can be further classified in three main categories:
1. Effects on spreading: describes papers that quantify the impact of NPIs on COVID-19 spreading;
2. Effects on behaviors: describes articles aiming to characterize how NPIs have affected a range
of behaviors and activities;
3. Effects on medical practice: describes research efforts quantifying the impact of NPIs on health

Effects on spreading

These articles study the impact on the unfolding of the disease focusing on the measures adopted in a
specific country [31–33, 308–312, 314, 316–319, 321–326], proposing multi country analyses [315, 328–
332], and characterizing the effects of NPIs on other diseases [313, 320, 327].
Ref. [309] studies the impact of travel bans in Australia from China. In doing so, authors use historical
data describing the mobility flows from China to Australia, the evolution of the epidemic in China
and developed an age-structured SIER-like model to describe the unfolding of the local pandemic given
importations from the epicenter of the outbreak. The analysis of the initial phases of the spread suggests
that the travel ban has been effective in reducing the number of infected seeds coming in the country
which might have resulted in faster local growth of cases. Authors of Ref. [311] use publicly available data
to create a database capturing 1407 transmission pairs outside Hubei province. These describe the onset
of symptoms and, for about half, the social relationships, infector and infectee pairs in the first month
of the emergency. The analysis of the data suggests how the implementation of NPIs was key to shorten
the serial interval from 7.8 days, in the early phases of the spreading, to 2.2 days. As more cases were
promptly identified and isolated the opportunities for the virus to start new infection chains decreased
drastically. From a methodological stand point the authors suggest the use of time-varying estimates of
serial interval in the computation of key epidemic indicators such as the reproductive number to avoid
biased results. In Ref. [32] authors analyzed the features of 32, 583 cases in Wuhan. They considered
as set of features such as socio-demographic, occupation and severity of illness. Their analysis confirms
the strong impact of NPIs which in about two months were able to bring the reproductive from values
above 3 to values well below one. Health workers have been affected at higher rates respect to the
general population (more than 3 times), and the portion of the severe cases drastically reduced from
50% the initial phases to 10% over the intervention period. Authors in Ref. [314] study more than

main categories in this group of articles.
1000 infected individuals and their close contacts (more than 15, 000). The dataset captures almost
20, 000 exposure events in Hunan (China) from mid January to early April 2020. The primary infections
have been identified by the surveillance network, their closed contacts have been followed for at least
two weeks and some of them were tested if developed symptoms before February 7. After this data
all contacts were required to be tested even if asymptomatic. The authors studied the transmission
risks according to the type (i.e., household, social, community, family, healthcare), duration, timing
of exposure and as function of the NPIs put in place. By using a logistic regression model they find
that household contacts are the most risky type of exposures. Extended family, social and community
contacts followed. Interestingly, contacts in healthcare settings have been found to have the lowest risk,
hinting to the efficacy of protective equipment and measures put place in those settings. The results
show that the effects of NPIs varies as function of the type of contact. In fact, the lockdown increased
household contacts increasing the risk for further transmission at home. The same measure instead
drastically reduced community and social contacts. Longer exposures increase the risk of infection and
transmission risk was found to be higher around the time of first symptoms. Children were confirmed
to be less susceptible that individual with age between 26 and 64. People older than 65 was found
significantly more susceptible. The data allowed the authors to study serial intervals and the impact of
NPIs on their distribution. Consistently with other observations, the serial interval decreased from 7.3
days for individuals isolated more than 6 days after symptoms to 1.7 days for those isolated 2 days after
showing signs of the disease. Interestingly, the authors are able to describe the type of case detection
(passive or active surveillance) as the pandemic unfolded and NPIs strategies adapted. While in the early
phases (before Jan 27) about 80% of cases were detected and isolated only after showing symptoms, thus
via passive surveillance, with a median time from onset to isolation of more than 5 days, after the 4th
of February this time difference become negative (−0.1 days) thanks to active contact tracing. This
clearly shows the key role of aggressive testing and tracing strategies to reduce the chances of further
transmission. Ref. [31] uses real-time mobility data, case and travel history across China to access the
impact of NPIs in the country. The authors show how in the early phases the spatial distribution of cases
is captured by and highly correlated with mobility data. The correlation drops significantly soon as after
the implementation of NPIs (in particular travel restrictions). The results point also to clear decrease in
the serial distribution showing the impact of strict surveillance and highlighting the effectiveness of the
implemented measures to suppress the spreading of COVID-19. Ref. [33] analyze epidemic and mobility
data across China to describe the impact and effect of NPIs during the first 50 days of the pandemic.
The mobility data was constructed aggregating information from location-based services (mobile apps),
migration and Baidu datasets. The authors use a linear regression model to link the arrival of cases in
other cities with the travel bans in Wuhan. The results show a very high correlation (0.98) and that cities
with larger populations and more connected with Wuhan had earlier importations. The authors build
also a linear regression model the link between the timing and type of NPIs implemented in 296 cities
and the number of cases in the first week of local outbreak. The results suggest how cities that acted
early had a lower burden and that stopping intracity transportation, entertainment venues, and banning
public gatherings are the NPIs more associated with reductions in cases. Interestingly, the results show
also that the cordon sanitaire in Wuhan, though important for the suppression of the disease, induced
32

only a delay of about 3 days in the arrival of the disease in other cities. Ref. [312] uses detailed data from
contact tracing in China to estimate the transmission patterns in households settings. The results suggest
higher infectivity during the pre-symptomatic phase, higher susceptibility for people 60+, and highlight
the importance of case isolation and aggressive contact tracing of close contacts. Similar conclusions have
been drawn in the context Vó, a small municipality in Veneto (Italy) [317]. The city has been the first
to report a confirmed COVID-19 death in Italian soil and was one of the first hotspots of the pandemic
in the country. The authors conduced two surveys collecting demographic, clinical, and contact network
information as well as testing the presence of infection in a large fraction of the population (85.9%
and 71.5% respectively). The results show how when the lockdown was put in place (first survey) the
prevalence was about 1%. After the lockdown (second survey) the prevalence was slightly smaller than
3%. Remarkably, about 42% of cases were asymptomatic. The results informed the local policy makers
and, due to the high number of asymptomatic, testing has been conducted to all contacts of positive
individuals in the region of Veneto. This approach has been critical to suppress effectively the virus
during the first wave. Authors in Ref. [318] present an analysis of all confirmed cases in New Zealand.
The country is often considered as one of the models for COVID-19 suppression. In fact, the early and
strong implementation of NPIs has resulted in (almost) disease elimination. The authors study a range
of features for each subject: demographic, health outcomes, transmission patterns, serial intervals, and
testing coverage across the different phases of the response. The results show how the implementation of
NPIs reduced the serial intervals and isolation times. Testing increased across time and the response has
shown to limit disparities across socio-economic groups. Ref. [319] presents the analysis of NPIs in the
context of Puerto Rico. The results, which focused on the initial phases of the outbreak, suggest an high
efficacy of the measures. The authors estimate that without interventions the death toll could have been
three times higher. Authors of Ref. [322] study the differences of disease burden across US States linking
them with the heterogenous implementation and adoption of NPIs. In doing so, they included a wide
range of correlates such as population density, fraction of population above 65+, life expectancy, years
of schooling, income, vaccination rate and testing rates. Furthermore, they adopted two indexes proxies
of the tendency of each subpopulation to adopt measures which might benefit the community and the
tendency to follow rules. Though in the USA NPIs widely varied across states the authors identified
five which are the most adopted: declaration of state-emergency, limit size of social gatherings, school
closure, strict restaurant operations, and stay at home orders. In the early phases of the pandemic lower
density and higher vaccination rates were significantly associated with slower growth rates. Restricting
restaurant was the only variable predictive of doubling time. However, the authors note how states
that implemented more actions earlier have been more effective in reducing the growth. In Ref. [323]
authors use an econometric approach to correlate policies, informations about the spreading, behavioral
changes measured as variation in mobility from the Google mobility reports, with disease progression
in the USA. The findings confirm both top-down and bottom-up NPIs had an impact in the mitigation
effort. Ref. [324] presents a statistical analysis of the effect of school closures on the progression of the
disease in the USA. In doing so, they consider a range of covariates such as other NPIs, demographic and
socio-economic informations. The results show that closures of school were linked, temporally, with a
reduced disease burden measured both in terms of cases and deaths. Interestingly, they observe that the
effectiveness of school closures has been higher when they were implemented earlier. The authors note
how measuring the effect of a single NPIs when several are in place is particular hard. Finally, authors in
Ref. [325] study a population of 1746 pregnant women in New York City that shared information about
their residence (borough), age and SARS-CoV-2 test outcomes. Authors adopt a Bayesian approach to
quantify the prevalence in each borough from the sample. Furthermore they consider general mobility
data captured from Facebook to study the link between prevalence and adoption of NPIs (estimated
from the mobility data). The results suggest a city-wide prevalence of 15.6% up to early May which
however varied from 11% in Manhattan to 26% in South Queens. Interestingly, prevalence was low in
borough with higher reduction in movements out and evening into them.
Authors in Ref. [332] analyze the impact of NPIs in 149 countries. In doing so, they built a linear
regression model where the dependent variable is the logarithm of the number of cases at time t and
the independent variables describe the days since the first confirmed case, a dummy variable describing
the present or absence of interventions, the days since the start of the interventions, and the population
size. They assume a week delay from the implementation of NPIs to their effect. They also consider
a range of other covariates such as different demographic and socio-economic indicators. Furthermore,
they consider five NPIs: school closure, remote working, limits on social gatherings, closure of public
transportation, and lockdown. Interestingly, in the period between 1st of January and 30th of May, the
authors observe that at least one of those NPIs was put in place in all 149 countries. All five have been

33

put in place in 118 countries, at least four in 25 and just three in 4. Tanzania put in place two (school
closure and limits on social gatherings) and Belarus only one (school closure). These observations clearly
show the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The results suggest how the implementation of
any NPIs is linked to a decrease of 13% in incidence. Higher GDP per capita, higher percentage of
population about 65 and country security index were associated with stronger reductions. The effects of
implementing all five rather than four measures are found to be similar. A smaller reduction was found in
countries implementing only three of them. Combinations of school closures, remote working and limits
on mass gatherings with or without closure of public transport was linked to decreases in disease burden.
Early implementation of lockdowns has been found associated with large reduction of incidence. Authors
of Ref. [330] aim to estimate the impact of NPIs in 56 countries by looking at the variations of Rt . In
particular, they studied the dataset discussed in details below, which provides a taxonomy and temporal
information about the range of NPIs implemented across the globe. Interestingly, they compute the
ranking of effectiveness considering four different methods: linear regression where each NPIs together
with other covariates is used to estimate the variation of Rt , lasso regression done assuming that without
intervention Rt would be constant and that variations are linked to the implementation of NPIs, random
forest considering the variation of Rt and neural networks that approximate Rt+1 taking as input the
set of NPIs and Rt . The estimation of Rt is done using EpiEstim which we have discussed above. The
results suggest how lockdown, limits on social gathering, remote working and school closures are the most
effective NPIs. Borders restrictions are also found to have a significant impact. Other less costly measures
such as risk communication strategies that promote healthy behaviors are found to be important. It is
interesting to note how food programs and financial support are also significant as they help people
to adopt NPIs without the risk of harsh economic consequences. Ref. [331] investigates the impact of
NPIs in 142 countries. In doing so, they link, via a regression model, the variations of Rt with NPIs
considering also several country specific covariates. The results confirm the effectiveness of lockdowns
and travel bans. Furthermore they suggest that partial lockdown might be as effective as full lockdowns
if implemented earlier. Authors in Ref. [329] combine data from the Oxford COVID-19 Government
Response Tracker (which is discussed below) [347], epidemiological indicators, Google mobility reports,
and socio-economic data from the World Bank to study the impact of NPIs in 53 countries. Differently
than the other approaches mentioned above, here the authors use a compartmental SIR model with timevarying parameters and link the logarithm of the transmission rate for each country to the NPIs and other
covariates via a regression model. Their findings suggest that the impact of school closures and remote
working decreases with employment rate, portion of elderly, country extension, population density and
increase for GDP per capita as well as expenditure in health care. The authors reflect on the fact that
adoption rates of NPIs could be less pronounced in case of low risk perception, younger population, and
a stronger health care system. Authors in Ref. [315] study the time series of the cumulative number of
cases in a range of countries such as India, USA, and Singapore. They study variance, autocorrelation,
skewness and other indicators to capture signals of slow down linked to implementation of NPIs. The
results confirm how the timing of intervention is a key variable that might explain successful suppression
strategies.
Authors in Ref. [313] investigate the effects of NPIs induced by COVID-19 on the seasonal flu in China.
The drastic measures put in place to hamper the spreading of SARS-CoV-2 were extremely efficient to
stop transmission chains also of the flu. The findings suggest a reduction of 64% respect compared with
previous years. In the context of South Korea and with a wider range of diseases (i.e., chickenpox, mumps,
invasive pneumococcal disease, scarlet fever and pertussis) Ref. [320] estimates the impact of NPIs put
in place in response of COVID-19 on these diseases. They use an ARIMA (autoregressive integrated
moving average) model built considering historical data to compare estimated incidence of each disease
with observations. The results suggest a large reduction (36%) for chickenpox. For mumps they observe
a marginal reduction only in the young population (< 18 years old). Reductions of about 80% were
reported for respiratory viruses. Ref. [327] investigates the effects of NPIs on two endemic infections
in the USA: respiratory syncytial virus and seasonal influenza. By studying detailed surveillance data
and using an epidemic model, they authors note how behavioral changes induced by COVID-19 have
reduced their transmission by at least 20%. As result of the increased fraction of susceptible population
the results indicate the chances of large future outbreaks.

Effects on behaviors

Within this category we find articles exploring the impact of NPIs on online activities [333, 334, 340, 341],
health [337–339], mobility [336], spending [335], and performance of financial markets [342].

Authors in Ref. [334] study the effect of the lockdown in Twitter and Weibo users in Lombardy and
Wuhan. The first is the most affected Italian region in the first wave. The second is the epicenter of
the pandemic. In doing so, the mined content posted two weeks before and after the lockdowns. They
extracted psycholinguistic features from the posts. The results suggest that in Wuhan the attention
shifted towards religion, emotions and social groups. In posts written in Lombardy the authors noted a
decrease of stress and an increase to topics related to leisure. Ref. [341] studies data from Google Trends
in 20 European countries to investigate possible shifts in attention towards nature and environmental
topics during the pandemic. Their findings suggest that, since the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis and
the implementation of strict NPIs, interest towards nature increased significantly. The effect is not so
visible for environmental topics instead. Ref. [333] studies the link between posts and mobility from Sina
Weibo in Sichuan, China. In more details, authors investigate variations in the overall content posted and
mobility (proxy of behavioral changes) as function of the different NPIs and COVID-19 phases. Initially
the increase of cases is linked to increase of negative emotions and decrease of mobility. As the number of
cases kept increasing the authors observe a decrease in negative sentiments posted and a stabilization of
mobility. After the peak decrease of negative posts and increase of mobility is reported. Overall the results
show how the peak of negative emotion proceeded the epidemic peak as well as the variation of mobility
patterns thus hinting to a significant bottom-up reaction in the population. Ref. [340] investigates the
increase of anti-asian sentiments expressed on Twitter as result of the pandemic. Unfortunately, even
political leaders publicly referred to COVID-19 as the chinese virus. The authors mined about three
million tweets from USA and used SVM (support vector machine) to estimate the sentiment associated to
them. The collection considered a dictionary of more than 500 keywords defined in previous race-related
studies and a database of racial slurs. Unfortunately, the authors detect an increase of anti-asian posts
by 67% comparing pre and post-COVID-19 posts.
Ref. [337] studies the runs of emergency medical services for opioid overdose in Kentucky (USA) before
and after the state of emergency declaration in the state. In a background of decrease of runs for other
conditions the authors observed an increase of calls for opioid overdose by 17%, and an increase of
50% in calls for suspected overdose with deaths at the scene. Overall the results are tragic, alarming
and highlight the possible consequence of health emergencies that drastically modify societal activities.
Authors in Ref. [338] study the variations in Google searches related with mental health before and after
the stay at home order declaration in several US states. The results indicate that searches linked to
negative thoughts, anxiety, suicidal ideation among others increased before the stay at home order and
level off at the time of the announcements. Despite the research is based on a very large number of
searches, the period of analysis covers only one week. Hence, more work is needed to investigate these
trends, potentially considering second/third waves and subsequent NPIs.
Ref. [336] uses mobile phone data to study the changes in mobility patterns in Germany. Interestingly,
they investigate a time period covering the first lockdown and the relaxation of NPIs put in place. The
results suggest a long lasting variation in the mobility patterns that remained in place despite the lifting
of top-down constraints. In fact, the authors show how long range movements across the country have
been considerably reduced and as consequence the mobility network in the new normal is considerably
more local and clustered.
Authors in Ref. [335] use real-time transactions data in Sweden and Denmark to understand the effects
of COVID-19 and different NPIs strategies on consumer spending. The results suggest how during
the emergency spending dropped on average by 25% in Sweden and by 29% in Denmark. The small
differences is particularly interesting considering that Denmark adopted a suppression strategy with a
lockdown rather than a mitigation strategies with general social distancing and other restrictions without
the social nuclear option of a shutdown. The findings suggest how the reduction in spending is largely
caused by the virus. Considering the much higher disease burden in Sweden these results highlight
how suppression strategies are a better control method when considering also economic factors. Finally,
authors in Ref. [342] study the link between performance of financial markets and NPIs in 67 countries.
They consider stock returns volatility and study their association with NPIs. The results suggest higher
volatility (which might induce large-scale sale of risky assets and higher cost of capital) in countries that
implemented stricter NPIs policies. Interestingly, information campaigns and events cancellations are
found to be the major contributors of volatility.

and lung cancer in the UK. In fact, NPIs limited drastically visits, specialistic follow-up and routine
screenings. The results paint a very grim picture with a projected increase of avoidable cancer deaths.
These go from 8 − 10% for breast cancer to 15 − 17% for lung cancer. The authors call for urgent policy
interventions to mitigate these tragic losses. In the context of a cohort of patients living with HIV in
Italy, Ref. [343] highlights the negative impact of the pandemic and NPIs. Visits missed, decrease of
new diagnosis respect of historical baselines, and a drop of antiretroviral therapy dispensation paint a
grim picture even in this case. Ref. [346] aims to characterize the increase in ICU deaths linked to
limited capacity. In the context of the UK, the modeling scenarios developed by the authors suggest
that a significant impact could be obtained doubling beds and reducing length of stay by 25%. Finally,
Ref. [344] studies the effect of NPIs in a long term care institution in the Netherlands specialized in
intellectual disabilities. The authors focused on incidents reported during the emergency respect to
historical data. The lockdown has caused a reduction across all types of incidents however, those linked
with aggression spiked up quickly soon after highlighting the need for developing specific protocols which
are better suited for patients with intellectual disabilities.

Reviews

Not surprisingly, I am not the first to think about writing a review about NPIs during the COVID-19
pandemic. In fact, the sample of papers I am analyzing here contains 21 articles which can be classified
as reviews. Some of them could be also considered as perspectives and/or comments, but I opted to
include them here as they provide a broad overview of a particular topic or context. This section will be
much shorter than the others. In fact, considering the nature of these articles, providing a summary of
them is probably more appropriate for meta-analyses.
The efforts behind the compilation of these articles come from more than 131 authors with affiliations in
13 countries (see Fig. 6). The UK and USA are at the top of the list. Furthermore, in terms of publication
venues, we find 20 journals that range from interdisciplinary domains such as Nature Communications
to more specialized such as BMC Oral Health. These articles already received 192 citations.

Classification

By looking at the angle and focus, the sample of reviews can be further grouped in 4 categories (see
Table 8.1):
1. Non-pharmaceutical interventions: describes articles which focus on different aspects of NPIs
such as types, effectiveness, and their modeling;
2. Change in medical practice: captures articles summarizing approaches, results, and success
stories about the adaptation of medical practices to NPIs;
3. Adoption of NPIs: considers articles discussing the issues and challenges linked to adoption of
NPIs in different contexts;
4. Impact of digital technologies: describes reviews summarizing the opportunities and challenges
that new technologies (such as mobile phones) offer in the fight against COVID-19

8.2

Non-pharmaceutical interventions

In this category we find reviews that discuss the effectiveness of NPIs [36, 297, 348–351], their effects [352–
356] and modeling [357].
In particular, Ref. [348] reviews the modeling efforts measuring the effects of NPIs in the Indian context.
Authors in Ref. [349] summarize the evidences about NPIs efficacy and approaches adopted across the
globe. They highlight how portfolios of measures appear to be more effective than single interventions.
Similar conclusions are drawn in Ref. [36] where the authors also stress the key importance of right
timing in the implementation of NPIs. Ref. [351] reviews the evidence about the efficacy and challenges
of both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions.
Ref. [352] reviews the literature focused on the psychological impacts of NPIs with particular attention
to minorities and disadvantaged groups, which unfortunately have been more affected by both disease
and NPIs. Authors in Ref. [353] review the evidences about the impact of NPIs on education. They
highlight the importance of considering the ripple effects that school closures have on students, parents,
economy, and mental health. Ref. [354] analyzes the literature focused on the effects of NPIs on eating
disorders. In doing so, it provides a range of suggestions and approaches to tackle the issue. Authors
in Ref. [355] study the literature about the psychological impact of the pandemic on pregnant women
highlighting the particular needs of this high-risk group. In the same spirit of considering a particular
group of individuals, Ref [356] investigates the effects of NPIs and COVID-19 on professional drivers
pointing out how the emergency has introduced a wide range of new stressors that sum up to those
already in place. Finally, Ref. [357] provides a summary of the modeling approaches put forward to
model COVID-19 and capture NPIs.

8.3

Change in medical practice

In this category we find articles that summarize the evidence, approaches and suggestions on how to adapt
medical practice in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. We find articles focused on surgery [34, 358],
ophthalmology [35], disease control (routine vaccination campaigns) [359] and dentistry [360].

8.4

Adoption of NPIs

Here we find two articles that provide a summary about the factors influencing the adoption of NPIs.
Ref. [362] confirms how adoption of health behaviors is linked to a range of factors, form socio-economic
to psychological. Authors in Ref. [361] summarize the practical issues linked to NPIs adoption in several
African countries where lack of water and soap are unfortunately widespread.

8.5

Impact of digital technology

Here, we find two reviews that highlight the incredible opportunities offered by digital technologies to
capture behaviors, their changes and inform modeling as well as policies [363, 364]. Interestingly, they
also discuss the issues linked to privacy, legal, ethical concerns and biases in the data.

Measuring NPIs via proxy data

Every call we make or receive, every time we connect to internet via our mobile phones, all posts we
leave on social media platforms, all queries we submit in search engines and all the times we swipe our
credit cards are just few examples of our daily activities that leave digital traces. The data is recorded
and stored by a wide range of companies to enable services, meet legal obligations, and billing purposes.
However, such data offers unprecedented opportunities to measure and understand a variety of human
behaviors which are of epidemiological relevance [365]. Information about which cell towers we are
connected to when making a call or surfing the web can be used to infer our location and movements.
The content, topic, and other meta data linked to our posts on Twitter, Facebook or online searches
might be studied to estimate our health status, our concerns about an health emergency, judge our
level of exposition to low quality information or our mobility. Our digital payments might be used to
detect life changing moments (i.e., pregnancies), infer our mobility patterns, or gathering socio-economic
information about people similar to us, people living in our neighborhoods, city or country. In general,
this data offers high-resolution proxies for many societal activity and behaviors. Due to serious privacy
risks and concerns such data is stored in what we can call digital vaults. Luckily, over the last few years
corporations, academia, and institutions at various levels have been working to unleash the potential
hidden in these proxies while taking all the necessary steps to preserve privacy and to respect stringent
regulations. In fact, a range of so called Data for Good initiatives have been put in place with the
aim of leveraging high-resolution datasets collected by companies in non-for-profit applications. I said
luckily because these ecosystems, their success, and great potential were in places before the COVID-19
pandemic. This, together with the scale and magnitude of the emergency, has allow tech giants such
as Google, Apple, Facebook and large mobile phone operators such as Telefonica, Vodafone, Orange as
well as smaller companies such as SafeGraph, Cuebiq among others to promptly step-up and provide
invaluable data to the scientific community. It is hard to imagine these efforts put in place so quickly,
safely, and extensively just five-ten years ago. COVID-19 is probably the largest data for good effort
ever assembled.
In this category, we find articles aiming to measure, quantify, monitor and capture NPIs via data proxies.
It is interesting to stress the range of data types and sources used. From information collected via mobile
phone apps, services, GPS, and wifi connections to posts on Twitter, Reddit, views of Wikipedia pages
or credit card records.
Though the large majority of studies in the sample are based on data collected in the USA, the penetration
of mobile phones allowed researchers to mine data from nearly all countries in the world (see Fig. 7).
These research efforts have been produced by more than 88 authors, affiliated with institutions from 7
countries. Again USA, Italy and UK are on the top of the list. In terms of publication venues, this
sample has been published in 12 journals. PNAS, Nature Human behavior and PLoS One are in the
top of the list. It is not surprising to see these interdisciplinary journals in this category. In fact, the
research efforts are based on a fusion of different approaches and techniques which are not bounded by
specific scientific domains. In terms of citations, this sample collected (as of Dec 19) 159 citations.

Adoption of NPIs

Here, we find articles aimed at quantifying the adoption of NPIs via proxy data such as mobile phones
collected by location intelligence companies [366–371], Twitter [372, 373], COVID-19 ad-hoc apps [195],
Wikipedia and Reddit [374], Google [375, 376], and TV viewings [377].
Authors in Ref. [366] use data from SafeGraph and Facebook to quantify social distancing at the county
level in the USA. In particular, SafeGraph provides information about access to locations and POIs.
Home locations are obtained considering the typical position of each phone in the night. Work locations
are inferred considering where phones spend three (i.e., part-time) or six (i.e., full-time) hours outside
home. These locations are identified using data from January, hence pre-NPIs. Aggregating all the
observations at the county level the authors identified a social distancing index for each county i in day
t defined as:
Hi,t
SDi,t =
(6)
Ni,t − Wi,t
where Hi,t describes individuals that appear not to have left home in day t, Wi,t those that appear to
have gone at work, and Ni,t the total number of devices in county i. The authors measured also the
(online) social connectedness of each county considering Facebook friendship data as:
SCi,j =

F Bi,j
Ui Uj

(7)

where F Bij is the number of social connections in Facebook between county i and county or country (if
outside USA) j, Ux is the number of Facebook users in each considered location. They also study the
timeline of NPIs put in place, epidemic indicators and built a regression model to find the association

between social distancing with social connectedness, NPIs, and cases. The results show that counties
with higher online social ties with China and Italy where more likely to comply with NPIs. This point to
the fact that being exposed to informations from highly affected areas might influence risk perception and
thus behavior change. Furthermore, the results show differences between political leanings, education
levels, and stands about climate changes. The link between political affiliations and NPIs adoption is
studied also in Ref. [368]. Here, authors use mobile phone data to test wether aggregated variation in
mobility are associated with political leanings at the state level. By using a regression model the authors
find a significant negative correlation between fraction of republicans and NPIs adherence (measured in
terms of mobility reduction). This link was found to be significant adjusting for population, poverty
rates, Gini index, urbanization levels, and portion of essential workers. Similarly authors in Ref. [369]
study mobile data collected by SafeGraph to measure the association between political views and mobility
reductions. In doing so, they considered behaviors, aggregated at the level of counties, after governors
issued recommendations to physical distance. These typically preceded stay at home orders or other
top-down restrictions. By using a regression model, built considering a wide range of covariates, the
author confirm the role of political leanings in response to such recommendation thus in self-initiated
behavioral changes. The recommendations had a significant effect on overall mobility, comparable to the
stay at home orders. The effects are found to be stronger in democratic counties and even stronger in
case of republican governors. The link between mobility reduction and political affiliation is studied also
in Ref. [370]. Here, the authors used mobile phone data collected by Unacast from about 15M users in
the USA as well as consumption levels of conservative traditional media (i.e., TV). Their results confirm
a correlation between adherence to NPIs and political leanings at the level of counties. In fact, counties
that in 2016 voted for Trump show, on average, 14% less mobility reduction and those that went to
Hillary Clinton. Also in this case, political affiliation was found to be a stronger predictor of mobility
variation than other variables such as density, income, and demographic informations. The authors point
out how counties that voted for Trump have been hit harder by the virus and show higher infections
and fatality rates. Authors of Ref. [367] use mobile phone data collected by Cuebiq to investigate the
possible association between adoption of NPIs (proxied as mobility reduction) and religiosity of US states
(measured via six indexes). The results from a regression analysis suggest that states classified as more
religious showed a lower and slower reduction of mobility. Furthermore, stay at home orders appear to
have weaker effects in such states. The results highlight once again how adoption of behavioral changes
is a multifaceted problem linked to a wide range of perceptions and beliefs. Authors in Ref. [371] use
mobile phone data collected by Unacast to study the socio-economic factors influencing adherence to
NPIs, measured as variation in mobility following stay at home orders, in the USA. By using a regression
approach the authors confirm how low income counties complied less with the orders than high income
ones. These effects are visible considering confounding factors as political leanings, population density,
unemployment rates among others.
Authors in Ref. [372] tackle a key issue which might have dire consequence in adoption of protective
behaviors: the spreading of mis-information on social media. Focusing on Twitter, they collected and
mined 100 Millions of tweets and develop a Infodemic Risk Index to monitor the exposure to low quality
information of users across countries. Their results show that the spread of unreliable information

40

typically precedes the local rise of cases potentially affecting adoption to NPIs. Interestingly however,
after the initial phases reliable information seems to take over. Ref. [373] studies the communication
strategies of official accounts (i.e., public health, emergency services, officials) on Twitter during the
evolution of the emergency. In fact, the ability to reach effectively a large user base to promote safe and
verified recommendation as well as explaining measures and regulations in place is key. The results show
how the inclusion of engaging content such as videos/photos and hashtags increases sharing. Posts with
content linked to epidemic indicators, technical information, content related to measures to contain the
spreading and flatten the curve were re-shared more widely. Authors in Ref. [374] study users attention
to the COVID-19 emergency considering as proxy Wikipedia page views and discussion on Reddit. The
results show how these were initially driven by media coverage (traditional media such as news articles
and YouTube videos published by news organization). However, while media coverage remained high,
the authors found evidence of decline in public attention raising questions about risk perception and
COVID-19 fatigue on NPIs compliance. Authors of Ref. [375] study the association between NPIs
related keywords on Google Trends and disease burden in each US state. Using a regression model they
find that attention towards NPIs related keywords, measured using proxy queries in Google, is associated
(0.42) with higher deaths per capita and case-fatality (0.60). They also confirm the association between
political leanings. Ref. [376] studies the association between mobility changes measured via the Google
mobility reports and economic, social and governmental features in 130 countries. The results indicate a
reduction of mobility across the board with patterns which are specific to the evolution of the epidemic
in each location. Countries with more authoritarian governments (where Google is however less likely to
have access) were found to be more responsive to changes of mobility as cases increased. This point to
another dimension of compliance to NPIs. Finally, Ref. [377] studies local television coverage and survey
data in rural settings in the USA. The results suggest that despite local news tend to be urban-centric
they can still affect adoption of NPIs. In fact, the authors find that rural residents are more likely to
adopt social distancing if they live in a media market more affected by the disease, which is driven by
close by cities. The survey data allowed the authors to confirm, at least for a sample, that these effects
are linked to local news viewings. The authors note how though significant these effects are about half
respect to those driven by partisanship.

9.3

Mobility changes

About half of the papers that measured NPIs via proxy data focused on the changes in mobility that travel
bans, school closure, remote working, local and national lockdowns have induced in the population. While
there is rich variety of data sources used, this data is collected via mobile phones by location intelligence
and measurement platforms [37, 38, 367, 368, 378, 379], tech giants such as Facebook [39, 366] and
Google [376, 381], as well as other mobile apps [380]. Indeed the high penetration of smart phones, their
portability, the vital role they took in our daily lives, the popularity of some apps and services make
them the perfect tool to infer high-resolution data about our movements and their possible changes.
Ref. [378] study data collected via mobile phone as well as vehicles to characterize the variations of
aggregated mobility in the USA during the early phases of the pandemic (January-April). The results
indicate how the overall mobility decreased markably following the national emergency declaration.
Interestingly, the results confirm how the population reacted before the stay at home mandates by
reducing their mobility voluntarily maybe nudged by news and increase risk perception. The observed
patterns however shows high levels of spatial heterogeneity linked to income and population density.
Authors in Ref. [379] study the data collected from more than 100M users in the USA from third
party data providers. They focused on county level mobility patterns. The data can be explored via
an interactive dashboard https://data.covid.umd.edu/. The observations show how travels outside
counties decreased by 35% when the national emergency was declared. The reduction however did
not last long. By using a simultaneous equations model, they investigated the link between the inflow
in each county and the number of infections. The model is based on two expressions. One for the
number of cases in county i in a day t, yi,t . To limit fluctuations this number is computed considering
t ∈ [T, T + 7], thus a seven day window. The second is an expression for the inflow xi,t in the same
county. In this case t ∈ [t − l, l] where l is a lag period. In both expressions they include autoregressive
terms, as well as county and temporal covariates. Using this approach, they observed a particularly
strong association between the mobility and infections in states that relaxed the NPIs. Ref. [38] adopts
a range of datasets: exposure indexes (which effectively estimate the number of devices in contact in
14-days periods, as done by many contact tracing apps) computed by PlaceIQ [382], Google mobility
reports and data from SafeGraph. Their observations indicated how poorer areas decrease mobility less

41

than wealthier. Even more, they observed a reversal: wealthier areas were more mobile than poorer
before the emergency. This findings confirm observations from many others articles and, considering
that low income neighborhoods are affected by low access to health care and higher level of preexisting
conditions, point to the fact that NPIs and the pandemic are affecting society heterogeneously, targeting
disproportionally already challenged groups. Authors of Ref. [37] use mobile phone data collected by
Teralytics, a location intelligence company, describing the mobility across and within counties in the
USA. They defined a mobility ratio (MR) metric to measure the variations of mobility patterns in each
county i at time t as:
P
P
Vj,j,t + k6=j Vk,j,t + k6=j Vj,k,t
P
P
(8)
M Rj,t =
Vj,j,t0 + k6=j Vk,j,t0 + k6=j Vj,k,t0
where Vk,j,t describes the number of trips from county k to i at time t and t0 is the baseline values
before the emergency thus in absence of NPIs. Note how in both numerator and denominator the second
and third terms are not the same quantity repeated by consider in and out flow each county. They
then computed the growth rate ratio for epidemiological data. They compare the moving average of the
number of cases in each 3 and 7 days periods. They studied the association between the two metrics in
25 counties. The results show a correlation between variation of mobility (induced by NPIs) and disease
growth ration above 0.7 in 20 out of 25 counties. The changes in mobility however are not visible in the
progress of the disease before 9 − 12 days and up to three weeks, which is compatible to generation times.
Furthermore, they confirm how changes in mobility preceded official restrictions. Authors in Ref. [39] use
Facebook mobility data to study the impact of strict NPIs put in place in the first wave in Italy. They
also consider socio-economic data. Their results confirm, also in the Italian context, how in cities with
higher fiscal capacity where able to reduce more mobility. Furthermore, they observe stronger reductions
in municipalities with higher levels of inequalities. Authors in Ref. [380] use data from 41 cities in 22
countries collected via the transportation app Citymapper. They study the association between mobility
and NPIs policies. Across the board the find a strong correlation between the decline in mobility and the
COVID-19 Government Response Stringency Index [347]. The variation of mobility linked to a specific
NPIs is stronger for closing public transport (18%) probably due to the nature of the data, workplace
closure (15%), restriction of internal movement (13%), school closure (10%) and borders restrictions
(5%).

Datasets

The last category describes publicly available datasets describing different aspects of NPIs. Here, I am
considering only datasets that have been featured in publications and shared with the community. There
are many popular others that we mentioned several times above such as Google mobility reports, Apple
mobility reports, and Facebook Data for Good datasets which have been put forward by the corporate
world through their data for good initiatives.
The datasets, especially those describing the timeline of NPIs, cover large part of the countries in the
world. They have been shared thanks to the work of more than 105 authors affiliated in institutions from
17 countries (see Fig. 8). In terms of publication venues, we find six journals. The most represented,
with two publications, is Scientific Data which is a journal from the Springer Nature family dedicated
to description and sharing of datasets. Others journals we find are Nature Human behavior and PloS
One. As of December 19th these articles received 37 citations, with a median of 1.5.

10.1

Classification

The datasets in the sample can be divided in three categories (see Table 10.1):
1. Implementation of NPIs: describes datasets providing detailed information about the timelines
and typology of NPIs;
2. Mobility: captures variations to human mobility induced by NPIs;
3. Contacts: describes datasets providing information about physical contacts which can be used to
feed many of the age-structured epidemic models discussed above
Let’s dive into some details.

Implementation of NPIs

Here we find datasets describing institutional interventions. The majority of them focused on governmental responses. One considered the specific context of Universities.
Ref. [347] describes the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker. The data can be downloaded
and explored via this url: https://ourworldindata.org/policy-responses-covid. The dataset provides information about 17 indicators capturing governmental responses. The taxonomy is organized in
four main categories. The first is containment and closure which is further divided in school closures,
workplace closures, public event bans, restrictions of social gathering size, closure of public transport,
stay at home requirements, national and international travel restrictions. The second type is economic
response which is divided in income support, debt/contract relief for households, fiscal measures, giving
international support. The third category is health systems which captures public information campaign,
testing policies, contact tracing, emergency investments in health care as well as vaccines, facial coverings
and vaccination policies. The fourth describes other responses. Some of the variables are ordinal, others
are numerical. Furthermore, 11 variables provide information at a geographical level. The resolution can

life. The other levels provide finer and finer description of each measure. The data comes as a timeline
of events. Each one with a specific ID, country, state, region, date, classification in the four levels,
status (which describe whether the measure is an extension of an old measure), comments, and source
of information.
Authors in Ref. [384] present the CoronaNet dataset with the timeline of NPIs implemented in 195
countries. The dataset is available here https://www.coronanet-project.org/. The data is organized
in a taxonomy that provides information about i) type of NPIs implemented (16 in total) ii) the type
of government implementing the intervention (i.e. national or provincial) iii) geographical target of the
measure (i.e. national, provincial) iv) the human or material target of the NPI (i.e. face masks, travelers)
v) the directionality of the policy (i.e. outbound, inbound) vi) the mechanism of travel targeted by the
measure (i.e. trains, flights), vii) whether the measure is mandatory or voluntary, viii) the nature of
the enforcer (i.e. government, military) ix) the timing of the policy (i.e. date of announcement and/or
implementation). Besides the description of the dataset, Ref. [384] applies a Bayesian approach to study
the evolution of NPIs strategies across countries. They observe a clear acceleration of more costly measures in mid-March 2020, when indeed we observed a rapid escalation as mentioned above.
Authors in Ref [383] apply the taxonomy defined by the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker
to the case of Canada. The data, together with many other relevant datasets from Canada and other
countries, can be found here: https://howsmyflattening.ca/#/data.
Finally, authors in Ref. [385] describe a dataset describing the strategies adopted by 575 US universities.
The data can be explored here: https://covidtracking.com/. By looking at official COVID-19 pages
created by Universities, which describe the portfolio of measures put in place, the authors studied five
(binary) variables: 1) remote learning 2) discourage campus housing 3) travel bans 4) close campus 5)
remote working. It is interesting to note how the analysis of the data, points out very high heterogeneity
in terms of NPIs in the country.

10.3

Mobility

In this category we find datasets describing the effects of NPIs on human mobility.
Ref. [40] provide information about the mobility of more than 80, 000 users in Italy, estimated via mobile
phones by Cuebiq, a location intelligence and measurement platform. The data covers the period from
January 18 to April 17 and is available here: https://data.humdata.org/dataset/covid-19-mobility-italy.
The dataset provides 3 different indicators. The first is the daily origin-destination matrices between Italian provinces. These are normalized directed flows computed by tracing the movements across provinces
of the users. The authors count as a stop only the locations where users stay for more than one hour. In
doing so, transits are discounted. The second measure is the radius of gyration of users which provides
information about their range of mobility. This metric is computed weekly. The third metric is the
proximity network which provides information about the possible social contacts between users. These
are relevant for modeling the transmission dynamics of the virus. To build this network, authors consider
time windows of one hour and connect all users within a radium of 50m.
Ref. [386] describes a survey conducted among more than 9, 000 individuals in Australia, Brazil, China,
Ghana, India, Iran, Italy, Norway, South Africa, USA. The answers are made available here: https:
//doi.org/10.7910/dvn/eiquga. The data provides demographic information and answers to several
questions about the transportation modes before and after the start of the pandemic. Furthermore,
the authors queried participants about their perception about COVID-19 related risks in transportation
system.

10.4

Contacts

In this category we find a research project called SOcial Contact RATES (Socrates) [41]. The authors
assembled a range of contact matrices, across different countries (Belgium, China, Finland, France, Ger-

44

many, Italy, Hong Kong, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland, Peru, Russia, South Africa, UK, Vietnam,
Zambia, Zimbabwe), both in pre and post COVID-19 periods. The data and interactive tool to explore
and extract it in ready to use format is available here: http://www.socialcontactdata.org/.

Conclusions and outlook

What are the main take-home messages from the sample of the literature considered?
Many articles helped to define the features of the virus and its transmission. SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by large R0 . The majority of models estimate values in the 3 − 4 range, depending on the
region/country. Due to lack of adequate testing (especially in the early phases) and a large fraction of
asymptomatic infections the virus spread largely undetected. Several data-driven modeling efforts show
heterogeneity in disease transmission. A minority of cases is responsible for a large fraction of infections.
Furthermore, some locations such as restaurants, hotels, workplaces are risker locations for infections.
Detailed analysis of confirmed cases and their contacts show how household contacts are also responsible
for a large fraction of infections (especially during lockdowns) followed by extended family interactions.
Children are found to be less susceptible and less at risk of severe outcomes. On the contrary, individuals
older than 65 are found to be more susceptible and at higher risk of death. Crowded cities are affected
by higher attack rates and longer epidemic waves.
Many articles aimed to measure the effects of NPIs. Across the board, the modeling efforts unanimously
show the importance and effectiveness of NPIs in slowing down the spread of COVID-19. Interestingly,
the timing of their implementation is a critical variable. Countries that acted early, with respect to the
local spread, were most successful in controlling the spread and reported markedly lower death tolls. In
several contexts, only a staggered NPI strategy was enough to bring the R0 below the critical value. A
range of articles highlights how a patchy and inconsistent geographical NPI strategy is linked to worst
health outcomes. It might induce behavioral changes, such as travel further for an activity, which ultimately might accelerate the spreading. The study of the conditions necessary to reach herd immunity,
without overflowing the health care system, point out that dynamic mitigation strategies are unrealistic and unpractical. Even more, several articles, some factoring in also economic metrics, point to the
fact that suppression is preferable to mitigation in the long run. Many research efforts show the large
impact of one of the simpler and less costly NPIs: face masks. Analyses of NPIs adopted across many
countries as well as data-driven epidemic models highlight how banning public gatherings, limiting social
gatherings, school closures, remote working, and lockdowns are the most efficient top-down measures. It
is important to notice, how the heterogeneity of infection outcomes as function of age, the difference in
socio-demographic stratifications, and intergenerational contacts across different countries suggest that
one-fits-all NPIs strategy might be far from optimal. Measures should be custom-tailored to the specific
context of each population.
Despite their efficacy NPIs came with high societal costs. Several articles in the sample highlight the
impact on mental health, loneliness, domestic abuse, sex, food consumption, and substance abuse among
others. The way health care facilities operated had to drastically change. The quick shift towards
telemedicine and remote care allowed to provide help to a countless number of patients. However, several surveys highlight the challenges that this induced. From lack of enough support and socio-economic
disparities to the tragic increase of preventable deaths for several types of cancers due to reduction of
screening. Also the education sector had to adapt drastically. The results point to the effectiveness of
remote learning as well as the challenges that it entails which go from the lack of social interactions,
the key to the development of children, to the impossibility of meeting some learning outcomes linked to
practical skills. Even though strict NPIs have increased the time spent at home, a large survey conducted
among scientists in the USA and Europe points to the fact that female scientists, those in experimental
fields and with young children had to reduce the time spent doing research.
When it comes to adoption and adherence to NPIs a range of articles paint a very complex picture
pointing out several factors influencing behavioral changes. Gender, education, age, and political leanings are examples. Several surveys suggest that women are more likely to comply with NPIs and to
consider COVID-19 as a real risk. Similar patterns are observed in individuals with higher education
levels. When it comes to age, the results indicate how young and older adults are less likely to comply
with NPIs. Few articles, in the context of the USA, indicate how republican leaning counties were less
likely to reduce mobility and were associated with a higher impact of the disease. The research points
also to a big urban-rural divide and the importance of socio-economic factors. People living in urban
settings were found more informed, and in the context of the developing world, more equipped to adopt
protective behaviors. Across the board, thus also in the richest countries, adoption of NPIs is linked
45

to socio-economic indicators: individuals in high-income brackets are able to drastically reduce their
mobility with respect to low-income brackets. Heterogeneity in terms of infection rates in disadvantaged
socio-economic groups is also reported. These effects, together with the worst access to health care and
higher levels of comorbidities, induced disproportionally higher disease burden in low-income groups.
There is evidence suggesting that food programs and financial support, implemented as part of containment strategies, help NPIs adoption. Several articles point to the fact that, though many NPIs were
imposed top-down, big variations in mobility patterns were observed before official orders. This suggests
that bottom-up, spontaneous, behavioral changes took place in several contexts.
Despite the incredible effort of many scientific communities, there are still open questions and challenges for future work.
We don’t have a validated theory to describe the feedback loop between behaviors and
diseases. Before COVID-19 the research on NPIs was mainly theoretical. Lack of empirical data describing behavioral changes was the main limitation. During the COVID-19 pandemic unprecedented
high-resolution datasets, capturing different aspects of NPIs, have been collected and shared. The
large majority of models used them as input. Thus, we transitioned from theoretical approaches in the
pre-COVID-19 world to data-driven modeling post-COVID-19. In fact, with few exceptions, the vast
theoretical literature on the subject has been neglected during the pandemic. As mentioned in one of the
perspectives [290], pandemics are a war period for modelers. Information is sparse, knowledge limited,
answers a real commodity. Access to data has allowed the luxury to avoid developing (or adapting)
models of behavioral changes and focus on other aspects. As result, despite great progress, we still don’t
have a validated theory to describe NPIs. The data collected during the COVID-19 pandemic will be of
crucial importance to tackle this challenge in the future.
We don’t have standardized metrics to compare or judge epidemic models. Epidemic models
are the most represented category in the sample of papers considered here. We find a wide range of
approaches and methodologies. While they all seem to do a decent job in reproducing the epidemic
patterns, it is far from clear how to compare them or how to judge their efficacy. As noted in one of
the perspectives [291], going forward the challenge is to define standard metrics to evaluate their performance. Competition is not the goal. The aim is to compare their predictive power, quantify their
reliability and sensitivity to assumptions.
We need to strengthen Data for Good initiatives. Many companies have provided unprecedented
datasets to estimate the effects of NPIs on our behaviors. The data have been shared thanks to several
Data for Good programs. Their value and impact in the fight against COVID-19 cannot be overstated.
As we move towards the end of the pandemic, I hope these initiatives will become even more popular
rather than shrink dramatically. Extensions, definition of standard metrics, and privacy concerns are
key challenges for future work.
We need to improve availability and accessibility of public health data. Within few months, we
saw incredible progresses on this front. Many health agencies, organizations and initiatives created APIs
that allow to download official cases and death counts at different geographical resolutions. However,
much more work is needed. Some countries still does not share all the data collected. For example, detailed information about onset of symptoms, and breakdown of data per age-bracket is often not shared
or provided by regional initiatives in very unhelpful formats (i.e., pdf). In other cases, we see still long
delays before the data is shared. The new SARS-CoV-2 variant spreading in the UK is an example.
After several weeks, data is still spread across sources and sparse. One of the major challenges going
forward is to improve data access and sharing standards.
We don’t know much about the long terms of NPIs. NPIs have affected virtually any activity
and societal process. As noted in many articles, especially those written in the context of health care,
going forward key challenges are linked to study their long-term effects and to develop strategies/policies
to cope with them.
Promoting high quality information is key. The adoption of health promoting behaviors is a
complex phenomenon affected by many variables. In the current landscape access to information and
misinformation is critical. As we transition towards the largest vaccination campaign ever attempted
and as we prepare for future health emergencies, understanding how to promote high-quality information
and demote misinformation is a key challenge for future work.
