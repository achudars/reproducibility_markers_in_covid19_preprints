1. INTRODUCTION
Since January of 2020 there’s an epidemic of COVID-19, a disease caused by the novel
coronavirus Sars-CoV-2 that started in a market at Wuhan, China and spread to the whole
world, at which point it was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization
(WHO)2 and led to the closing of borders and cancellation of flights like never seen before.
In this paper we develop a SIR epidemiological model with parameters calculated according
to existing data [1] at the time of writing (24/03/2020); the data is from Italy, South Korea
and Colombia, the model is then used to project the evolution of the COVID-19 epidemic in
Colombia for different scenarios using the data of population for the country and known
initial conditions at the start of the simulation [2].
2. MATHEMATICAL MODEL
We use the SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Removed) model which separates a population into
three groups at any given time: susceptible individuals to the disease (total of people who
hasn’t been infected) noted by S, infected individuals (people with the infection active at the
moment) noted by I, and removed individuals (recovered or dead) noted by R; the nonlinear system of first-order ordinary differential equations is [3]:
𝑑𝑆/𝑑𝑡 = −𝛽𝑆𝐼
𝑑𝐼/𝑑𝑡 = 𝛽𝑆𝐼 − 𝛾𝐼

(1)

𝑑𝑅/𝑑𝑡 = 𝛾𝐼
A big assumption of this model is that people recovered from COVID-19 will not be reinfected (which hopefully seems to be the case). The initial conditions are S(0)=S0, I(0)=I0 y
R(0)=R0;  and  are positive constants found by adjustment to existing data. To solve the
system, it is only needed to solve the first two equations since S and I do not depend on R.
The equilibrium (no new infected individuals) is reached when:
𝑆𝑒 =

𝛽

3. NUMERICAL MODEL AND CALIBRATION
The system (1) is discretized by finite-difference in a Euler implicit method [4] to guarantee
stability of the numerical solution, with a unit time step (t = 1 day) we get:
𝑆𝑛 − 𝑆𝑛−1 = −𝛽𝑆𝑛 𝐼𝑛
𝐼𝑛 − 𝐼𝑛−1 = 𝛽𝑆𝑛 𝐼𝑛 − 𝛾𝐼𝑛

(3)

Where the sub-index indicates the time step (in this case, the day) of the simulated variable.
Algebraically developing the system (3) we get the values for each variable at day n:
𝐼𝑛 =

√[1 + 𝛾 − 𝛽(𝑆𝑛−1 + 𝐼𝑛−1 )]2 + 4𝛽(1 + 𝛾)𝐼𝑛−1 − [1 + 𝛾 − 𝛽(𝑆𝑛−1 + 𝐼𝑛−1 )]
2𝛽(1 + 𝛾)
𝑆𝑛−1
1 + 𝛽𝐼𝑛

𝑆𝑛 =

(4)

(5)

The numerical solution was implemented in an Excel spreadsheet. The calibration of the SIR
model parameters is done adjusting with the existing data, for day n we get solving from
the equations:
𝛽𝑛 = −
𝛾𝑛 =

(𝑑𝑆/𝑑𝑡)𝑛
𝑆𝑛 𝐼𝑛

(6)

𝛽𝑛 𝑆𝑛 𝐼𝑛 − (𝑑𝐼/𝑑𝑡)𝑛
𝐼𝑛

(7)

The derivatives are calculated with first-order finite-difference from each data set. Then we
take the average value for N days of a selected interval for the adjustment:
∑𝑁
𝑛=1 𝛽𝑛
𝛽=
𝑁

(8)

∑𝑁
𝑛=1 𝛾𝑛
𝑁

(9)

𝛾=

The value  must be normalized multiplying by the total population to be able to compare.
4. PROJECTION FOR COLOMBIA WITH PARAMETERS FROM ITALY
Italy is the hardest hit country in Europe at the time of writing this paper, the epidemic grew
initially without control so its parameters are a simulation scenario of interest, the data of
epidemic [1] and population [2] for Italy was analyzed and the model adjusted with data
between 29/02/2020 and 20/03/2020, results from equations (6) to (9) are the following:

With these SIR parameters and the population of Colombia [2] we simulate the COVID-19
evolution in the country for a year with I0=369 (by 24/03/2020) with 9 removed individuals
(6 recovered and 3 deaths). The results are shown in Figure 4.3:

It is observed that the peak of infections would be by 29/06/2020 with a total of 25 million
infected individuals at the same time. The infection would get low values by December of
2020.
5. PROJECTION FOR COLOMBIA WITH PARAMETERS FROM SOUTH KOREA
South Korea has been an example by their discipline testing COVID-19 cases and their
control of the epidemic, for uncontrolled growth data was taken between 20/02/2020 and
29/02/2020, for controlled growth data was taken between 10/03/2020 and 20/03/2020.

SIR Model for COVID-19 calibrated with existing data and projected for Colombia

There’s a substantial difference between results, the uncontrolled epidemic would reach a
peak of 44.6 million infected people by 02/05/2020 (creating an unbearable burden on the
Health System and possibly millions of deaths) while the totally controlled situation gives
us a declining number of active infections, that would be the most ideal case.
6. PROJECTION FOR COLOMBIA WITH OWN PRE-LOCKDOWN DATA
The model is calibrated with existing data from Colombia [1] before a national lockdown
that takes effect the day of the writing of this paper, although this data is very limited
compared to Italy and South Korea since the infection arrived later on the country.

Figure 6.3. Simulated infected individuals for Colombia using parameters from the
beginning of the infection in the country.
According to the simulation if the infection is left as of right now there would be a huge
peak of 47.2 million infected people by 21/05/2020, with millions of infected individuals
taking a toll on the Health System for more than a year, a disastrous outcome.

7. CONCLUSIONS
We developed a numerical model for simulating the infection of COVID-19 using the data
obtained from open sources and solving the SIR model; this numerical model is useful for
any region adjusting the corresponding parameters.
The gravest conclusion is that the COVID-19 spreads very easily infecting scores of people
in a short time with huge peaks of active infections, thus representing a very extreme threat
to Health Systems in all the world (Italy and Spain being examples of this as of the time of
this writing).
It seems that the lockdown approach to combat the spread of COVID-19 is adequate from
the data from South Korea.
