Abstract:
Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in late 2019 and 2020 comprises a serious and more likely a pandemic
threat worldwide. Given that the disease has not approved vaccines or drugs up to now, any efforts for
drug design and or clinical trails of old drugs based on their mechanism of action are worthy and
creditable in such circumstances. Experienced docking experiments using the newly released coordinate
structure for COVID-19 protease as a receptor and thoughtfully selected chemicals among antiviral and
antibiotics drugs as ligands may be leading in this context. We selected nine drugs from HIV-1 protease
inhibitors and twenty-one candidates from anti bronchitis drugs based on their chemical structures and
enrolled them in blind and active site-directed dockings in different modes and in native-like conditions of
interactions. Our findings suggest the binding capacity and the inhibitory potency of candidates are as
follows

TipranavirIndinavirAtazanavirDarunavirRitonavirAmprenavir

for

HIV-1

protease

inhibitors and CefditorenCefiximeErythromycinClarithromycin for anti bronchitis medicines. The
drugs bioavailability, their hydrophobicity and the hydrophobic properties of their binding sites and also
the rates of their metabolisms and deactivations in the human body are the next determinants for their
overall effects on viral infections, the net results that should survey by clinical trials to assess their
therapeutic usefulness for coronavirus infections.

Introduction
The outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) in 2019-2020 is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
Corona Virus (SARS-COV-2) [1-4]. It is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that caused a total of
75,465 reported cases up to February 2020 in China [5-6]. Increased risk of world wide spread comprises
serious life-threatening issues against human safety. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath are the main
symptoms of the disease that may leads eventually to pneumonia with a mortality rate of 1-3% [7-11].
Currently, there are no approved drugs for coronavirus infectious. Even though antiviral drugs such as
inhibitors against protease, integrase and or polymerase enzymes designed and are in advance studies [1213]. Among these inhibitors, anti-protease inhibitors seem to act effectively in blocking virus replication
and provide a promising treatment for SARS and MERS diseases.
Given the protease vital role in the virus life cycle and its maturation via functional protein production
from their precursor, it seems to be a good target for drug design in viral infections as COVID-19
infection

as

well.

Based

on

data

available

in

the

PUBMED

database

(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) COVID-19 protease, EC 3.4.2 is a protein with 305 residues
contrast to SARS protease with 306 amino acid residues. Sequence alignment using EMBOSS Stretcher
server (www.ebi.ac.uk) reviled that corona protease compared to SARS protease contains one amino acid
deletion at position 144 (Cys) as well as about 10 mutations along it sequence stretch as depicted in
scheme 1. These changes in COVID-19 protease sequence may lead to the different global architecture of
protein and especially in its binding or catalytic site, in such a way the localization of binding sites in
COVID-19 shifted to neighbors' residues contrast to that’s of SARS protease.
Binding site survey for these two proteases using Computed Atlas of Surface Topography of proteins
(http://sts.bioe.uic.edu/castp/) server confirmed these changes in enzyme binding site. Table 1 represents
the binding site residues for SARS and COVID-19 protease. As it is evident there is only three residues
similarity between two enzymes at positions 140-142 different amino acid constituent and geometry
expectedly need different inhibitors with different stereochemistry. Based on this fact it is necessary to
search for different inhibitors for coronavirus, the investigation that is the main topic of this study.

Method and Materials:
Coordinate structures retrieval and preparations: Coordinate structures of coronavirus protease with PDB
ID 6LU7 in accordance with SARS protease with PDB ID 1UK3 were retrieved from protein data bank
(https://www.rcsb.org/). The structures, which were obtained by the X-ray diffraction and refined at the
resolutions of 2.16 Å and 2.4 Å respectively. In this process, the constructed structure was energyminimized.3.4. The structures were placed in separate rectangular boxer with dimensions of
8.15×9.06×9.58 nm and 9.44×9.26×10.63nm dimensions respectively. The two boxes were then filled
with SPCE solvents with a water shell of 1.0-nm thickness. Steepest descent algorithm was used to
minimize the system energy to lower than 200 kJ/mol. Energy minimization was performed at neutral pH
(Asp, Glu, Arg and Lys ionized), 37°C and one atmospheric pressure [14-15].
Sequence Alignment was carried out for the two sequences of COVID-19 and SARS protease on
EMBOSS Stretcher (www.ebi.ac.uk) for comparison purposes [16-17].
Coordinate structures of enrolled drugs including HIV-1 protease inhibitors of Amprenavir, Atazanavir,
Darunavir, Indinavir, Lopinavir, Nelfinavir, Ritonavir, Saquinavir and Tipranavir as well as drugs used to
treat bronchitis as Azithromycin, Cefaclor, Cefdinir, Cefditoren, Cefpodoxime, Cefprozil, Ceftriaxone,
Cefuroxime, Cifexim, Ciprofloxacin, Clarithromycin, Co-Amoxiclav components (Amoxicillin and
Clavulanic acid), Co-Trimoxazole components (Trimethoprim and Sulfamethoxazole), Dicloxacillin,
Doxyxycline, Erythromycin, Gemifloxacin, Guaigensin, Moxifloxacin, Ofloxacin, and Tetracycline were
obtained from PubChem database (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) in SDF format and converted to
PDB format using Open Babel server (http://openbabel.org/). The structures then transferred to ArgusLab
software (http://www.arguslab.com/) [18] and checked for their bonds and energy optimization and finally
the structures were opened in a text editor in Linux environment for their consistency from right character
used point of view.
Blind Docking experiments: to survey the potential anchoring site on COVID-19 protease for drugs
binding and to verify them as binding sites based on their similarity and vicinity to enzyme active site we
performed blind docking experiments in Hex 8.0.0 (http://www.loria.fr/~ritchied/hex/) [19] installed in
Linux

operating

system.

The

default

setting

for

Shape

only,

Sahpe+Electrostatic

and

Shape+Electrostatic+DARS with macro sampling were used in separate experiments on optimized

structures of protease and drugs as ligands. The best pose and the binding energies of the 100 poses were
recorded for statistical analysis.
Active Site-Directed Docking: this kind of docking was performed using ArguLab [18] in default setting
using Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm with Max Generations: 10000 and binding site size:
17.96×19.78×26.44 angstroms. The binding energies for the best 20 pose were extracted in Kcal/Mol for
statistical analysis.
Hydrophobicity of Enzyme Active Site and Drugs: Hydrophobicity of active site as well as drugs could
be considered as a determinant factor for effective interactions between enzyme active site and ligands
(drugs) that is an indicator for the extent of enzyme inhibition by ligands. In this study, we calculate the
hydrophobic index for enzyme active site residues based on Kyte & Doolittle method and report them as
hydrophobic index per residue for reasonable comparison [20]. The Hydrophobicity indexes for drugs
were

calculated

as

LogP

on

the

Virtual

Computational

Laboratory

server

(http://www.vcclab.org/) [21].
Data Handling and Analysis: all the numerical data were exploited in Excel and SPSS software. P-value
under .05 was considered as the significance level.

Results and Discussion:
Sequence alignment for COVID-19 and SARS proteases, scheme 1, performed on EMBOSS Stretcher
(www.ebi.ac.uk) reviled a single deletion at position 144 (Cys) in COVID-19 protease contrast to SARS
ones and also there are twelve mutations along COVID-19 protease along it sequence stretch as depicted
in scheme 1 shown by single our double dots instead of vertical line.

Scheme 1: sequence alignment preformed on EMBOSS Stretcher (www.ebi.ac.uk) server. Corona sequence is highlighted in yellow
color

Accordingly, the mutations in COVID-19 expectedly exert structural changes that may affect enzyme
binding site position and functional group constituents. As shown in table 1 the mutations move the biding
site to preceding residues in COVID-19 contrast to SARS protease, far from the binding site of SARS and
hence the inhibitors for SARS should not affect on COVID-19 protease. Given the fact that active site
residues placed at flexible or hot points of the protein chain, we extracted the root mean square fluctuation
(RMSF) plot of COBID-19 and SARS protease (Figure 1) molecular dynamic simulation trajectory and
plot it as RMSD in nanometer per residues numbers. Residues with higher RMSF comprise the hot or
flexible points. As it is shown most residues of COVID-19 active site (table 1) placed predominantly in
the 140-192 region, while that’s of SARS localized in 290-303 regions. This finding reconfirms our claim
regarding the COVID-19 active site.

removed from further study.

In the next step, we carried out active site-directed docking of the selected ligands in ArgusLab software
to study the binding capacity of ligands to fit the active site. The binding energies obtained from our
docking our blind and active site-directed experiments are shown in table 2. Pearson's two-tailed test of
correlation was performed between blind and active site-directed docking reveals that there is no
significant correlation between blind and site-directed energies (p-value >.05) and this means that the
mechanisms underlie the interactions between ligand and protease is not the same and these two energies
are completely independent variables and could be sums for comparative purpose.

Figure 3 shows the total binding energies for ligands during our experiments. Based on our findings and as
it is clear Tipranavir seems to be the most potent inhibitor for COVID-19 protease. Clinical trials reveal
that Tipranavir is capable of viruses' replication in patients resistant to other protease inhibitors and
resistance against this drug needs multiple mutations to take place simultaneously in protease genes [22].
The application of the drug in combination with one of the antiretroviral drugs as Ritonavir is approved
for HIV-1 treatment by the FDA [23]. The second effective drug we introduced is Cefditoren, a
cephalosporin antibiotic with broad-spectrum, administered for different conditions as pneumonia, acute
bacterial and chronic bronchitis [24-25]. Indinavir is the third effective inhibitor we candidate for COVID19 treatment. Considering the miscellaneous drugs available for HIV-1 treatment it is not currently
recommended for HIV-1 treatment due to its side effects [26]. However, it is shown that Indinavir by
decreasing viral replication increases the life expectancy of the patient for several years in viral infections

[27]. The low water solubility of Indinavir requires plenty of water to dink to prevent its precipitation and
crystallization as in kidneys [28].
Atazanavir is the forth protease inhibitor that we recommend for COVID-19 infections. This inhibitor
structural mimic the transition state of proteolysis at the Phe-Pro cleavage site. Atazanavir is prescribed
for HIV-1 treatment in conjunction with an antiretroviral drug [29]. Given that human proteases could not
hydrolyze the Phe-Pro bonds so Atazanavir does not inhibit human proteases at all [30-31]. The fifth drug
we encourage the clinician's for clinical trials especially that this cephalosporin safely and effectively can
combat the probable bacterial infections that may accompany viral infections at facilitates pneumonia and
other complications [32-36]
Darunavir is the seventh drug we introduced as COVID-19 protease inhibitors. To increase Darunavir
efficacy, it is used in accordance with one of the other retroviral drugs as Reitonavir or cobicistat to treat
HIV-1 infectious [37-38]. The drug binds strongly to enzyme active site via multiple hydrogen with a
dissociation constant (Kd) of 4.5 ×10−12 M, which is much stronger than that’s of other protease
inhibitors [39]. It is very important to notice that the hydrogen bonds are formed between Darunavir and
enzyme backbone and so they did not affected by mutations in protease sequence because the backbone
does not affected by sequence and then the inhibitory potency of Darunavir does not disrupted by viral
mutations in new generations of viruses [39-40]. The eighth drug we recommend for the clinical trial is
Ritonavir which is a known inhibitor for HIV-1 protease. This inhibitor does not or rarely used alone for
HIV-1 infectious and instead it is most often used in conjunction with other protease inhibitors to boost
their antiviral action. Ritonavir itself inhibits liver and intestine enzymes that metabolize protease
inhibitors and by the way, allows lower doses for these drugs to exert their effects [41-44]. The ninth drug
seems useful for the clinical trial is Erythromycin the well known and safe antibiotic for respiratory tract
infections and finally, Amprenavir is the tenth drug we recommend for a clinical trial for COVID-19
infections that have no vaccine and no approved drug with a reasonable rate of incidence and increasing
percent of mortality [45-46].

Figure 3: Total binding energy of drugs in KJ/Mol for drugs. The drugs with not different binding energy are shown with same
pattern (p-value)

Table 3 represents the complementary parameters that may affect drugs binding to the enzyme active site
and their inhibitory effects on enzyme activity. The more similarity in binding site to the enzyme active
site cavity causes the more inhibitory effects of drugs on enzyme activity. Among the drugs, Amprenavir
exhibits maximum similarity while Darunavir, Dicloxacillin, and Doxycycline show the minimum
similarity in their binding site constituents with the enzyme active site. We hypothesize that the binding
site similarity for drugs should play determinant roles in their inhibitory potency. Hydrophobicity of drugs
binding sites also accelerates their binding in aqueous conditions and we think that the more hydrophobic
index for each drug guarantees prominent inhibitory behavior. Atazanavir and Amprenavir based on these
criteria should exhibit the most and the less inhibitory character. Finally, LogP calculation for drugs
reveals that Tipranavir, Atazanavir, and Ritonavir among anti-HIV-1 drugs and Dicloxacillin,
Clarithromycin and Erythromycin among bronchitis drugs manifest the highest hydrophobic properties.

Conclusion:
Our results indicate that there are structural differences between primary structures of proteases for
COVID-19 contrasts to that’s of SARS which leads to altered enzyme binding sites. We hypothesize that
these alterations cause the enzyme, not to respond to anti-SARS protease inhibitors for treatment [47-48].
During this work and via re-examining HIV-1 protease inhibitors and different anti bronchitis antibiotics
we tried to find more effective inhibitors for COVID-19 treatment. Finally, we picked up the following
order for inhibitory potency among anti-HIV-1 protease inhibitors:
Tipranavir>Indinavir>Atazanavir>Darunavir>Ritonavir>Amprenavir
Similarly, the following order for anti bronchitis was obtained
Cefditoren>Cefixime>Erythromycin>Clarithromycin
Considering this fact that all the drugs used in this study are approved by FDA for clinical application we
hope that our findings considered for clinical trials in COVID-19 patients to overcome the world wide
current outbreak of coronavirus.
