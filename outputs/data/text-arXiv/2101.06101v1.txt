Abstract
A great issue of discussion of an infectious disease is its basic reproduction number R0 , which provides an
estimation of the contagiousness of the disease. When R0 > 1, the disease spread will potentially lead to
an outbreak, such that of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemics. During the evolution of an outbreak, various
non-pharmaceutical interventions are employed, the impact of which is frequently assessed by the reduction
that they introduce to the effective reproduction number Rt ; reduction below 1 is an indication of eventual
dying out of the disease spread. Motivated by the fact that R0 essentially expresses the stability of the
disease-free equilibrium, in this work, Rt was examined in the view of timescale analysis. It was shown that
during the evolution of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy, when various interventions were in place, Rt had
a clear relation with the explosive timescale characterizing the dynamics of the outbreak. In particular, it is
shown that the existence of an explosive timescale during the progression of the epidemics implies Rt > 1,
while its absence implies Rt < 1. In addition, as this timescale converges/diverges with the immediately
slowest one, Rt approaches to/withdraws from its threshold value 1. These results suggest that timescale
analysis can be utilized for the assessment of the impact of various interventions, since it reflects the insight
provided by the effective reproduction number, without being hindered by the selection of the population
model, nor the parameter estimation process followed for model calibration.

1. Introduction
As of March 11, 2020, the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic by World
Health Organization (WHO) [1]. By January 15, 2021, the COVID-19 pandemics has been spread to more
than 219 countries and territories, reporting more than 93 million infected cases and 2 million deaths [2].
A great issue of discussion of the COVID-19 pandemics is its basic reproduction number, estimations for
which were provided in numerous early studies; see Refs within [3]. The basic reproduction number, R0 , is the
average number of secondary infections produced by an infectious individual in a population where everyone
is considered susceptible [4, 5]. Being dependent on human behavior and the biological characteristics of
the pathogen, R0 provides an estimation of the contagiousness of the infectious disease [4] and serves as a
threshold parameter; when R0 > 1 the infected increase exponentially, leading to a disease outbreak, while
when R0 < 1 the disease spread dies out [4, 5].
For the control of the COVID-19 outbreak, various interventions are employed aiming to “flatten” the
curve of the epidemics. Since R0 is constant in time, it cannot monitor the effect of the undertaken measures;
instead, the time-varying effective reproduction number Rt is utilized, that estimates the secondary infections
produced by an infectious individual during the course of an outbreak, thus, in a population where not
everyone is considered susceptible. As a result, during the evolution of the epidemics, the undertaken control
measures affect Rt , since they influence (i) the duration of contagiousness, (ii) the likelihood of infection per
contact and (iii) the contact rate of the infection [4, 6]. The impact of various interventions (case isolation,

contact tracing, travel restrictions, etc.) in Rt has been assessed in a number of studies to provide guidelines
in decision-making policies [7–12].
The use of R0 as a threshold parameter is related to the stability of the disease-free equilibrium (DFE)
of the epidemiological model under consideration [4, 5, 13], which is locally assessed by the existence of
positive eigenvalues. During the evolution of the system, the local dynamics is characterized by timescales
of dissipative/explosive nature - associated with positive/negative eigenvalues - the action of which tends to
drive the system towards to/away from equilibrium [14, 15]. Timescale analysis has been frequently employed
to address the dynamical properties of systems arising from reactive flows [16, 17], systems biology [18, 19],
pharmacokinetics [20], etc, but, to my knowledge, it hasn’t been widely applied to population dynamics.
Motivated by the fact that R0 mathematically expresses the stability of the DFE; i.e., the existence of
positive eigenvalues at day zero, here the relation of Rt to the explosive timescales (positive eigenvalues) during the course of COVID-19 outbreak in Italy was investigated. It is shown that the existence of an explosive
timescale implies Rt > 1, while its absence implies Rt < 1. In addition, as this timescale converges/diverges
with the immediately slowest one, Rt was shown to approaches to/withdraws from its threshold value 1. Finally, by performing the analysis in 4 different population dynamics models, it is demonstrated that timescale
analysis is a robust methodology to monitor the progression of the epidemics, since it directly reflects the
variations in Rt , without being hindered by the complexity of the selected model.
2. Materials and Methods
Compartmental modeling is widely used for the analysis of various infectious diseases [21–24], among which
COVID-19 pandemics [8, 11, 25, 26]. Four population dynamics compartmental models in the framework of
the SIR model [27] were analyzed here. The effective reproduction number Rt was calculated on the basis
of these models and conclusions were drawn on its relation to the timescales characterizing the dynamics of
each model.
The four compartmental models are presented in Section 2.1, followed by the parameter estimation process
considered for their calibration against the data of Italy in Section 2.2. The methodology to calculate the
effective reproduction number Rt and the timescales τi on the basis of each model is presented in Sections 2.3
and 2.4, respectively.
2.1. The population dynamics models
The SIR model formulates the transmission of an infectious disease among three population groups,
namely the susceptible, infected and recovered individuals [27]. In this framework, four population dynamics
models were considered, the SIRD, SEIRD, SEInsRD and SIDARTHE models, the governing equations of
which can be written in the ODE form:
d
y = g(y)
(1)
dt
where y is the N-dim. column state vector, which includes the fraction of each population group over the
total population and g(y) is the N-dim. column vector field, which incorporates the transition rates from
one population group to another.
The simplest compartmental model to capture COVID-19 pandemics is the SIRD model, which essentially
is the SIR model with the addition of a compartment accounting for the dead individuals. Denoting S, I,
R and D the fraction of susceptible, infected, recovered and dead individuals respectively, over the total
population N , the SIRD model is written in the form of Eq. (1) as:

where β is the transmission ratio, γ the recovery ratio, which also expresses the inverse of the infection period
of the disease, and µ the fatality ratio.
A more realistic assumption for COVID-19 infection is the existence of an incubation (latency) period,
during which an individual is infected but yet not infectious [28, 29]. Such an assumption can be incorporated

in the SIRD model with the addition of a compartment accounting for exposed individuals. Denoting E their
fraction over the total population, the resulting SEIRD model is written in the form of Eq. (1) as:

where σ is the transition ratio from exposed to infected individuals, expressing the inverse of the incubation

In addition, it has been shown that the COVID-19 infected individuals have symptoms of different severity,
varying from mild to severe [30]. Since the severely infected individuals are in need of immediate health care,
a more biologically realistic assumption for COVID-19 infection is the distinction between normally infected
and severely infected individuals. Such an assumption can be incorporated in the SEIRD model, by dividing
the infected compartment in two sub-compartments. Denoting IN and IS the fraction of normally and
severely infected individuals over the total population, the resulting SEInsRD model in the form of Eq. (1)
reads:

where the subscripts N and S indicate the normally and severely infected transmission β and fatality µ
ratios, ss denotes the fraction of severely over normally infected individuals and µT P is the physiological
death ratio.
Finally, a more detailed compartmental model was considered, accounting for susceptible (S), asymptomatic detected and undetected infected (I and D), symptomatic detected and undetected infected (A
and R), severely symptomatic (T ), healed (H) and extinct (E) individuals, namely the SIDARTHE model
[25]. Here, the SIDARTHE model was considered for validation purposes and thus, only a brief description
of the model is provided in Appendix A; details can be found in [25]. Note that the SIDARTHE model is
also written in the form of Eq. (1); see Eq. (A.13) and Eqs. (1-8) in Methods section in [25].
2.2. Model calibration
In this study only the SEIRD and SEInsRD models in Eqs. (3, 4) respectively, were calibrated, since (i)
the relation of Rt with the timescales can be reached analytically on the basis of the SIRD model in Eq. (2)
and (ii) the parameter values of the SIDARTHE model are provided in [25].
The SEIRD and SEInsRD models in Eqs. (3, 4) were calibrated to the daily reported data of infected,
recovered and dead individuals in Italy, as reported by John Hopkins database [31]. The parameter estimation
process was performed in a weekly basis accounting for the data from February 26 (week 0) to September 30
(week 30). February 26 was selected as starting day in order to minimize early data distortion, since more
than 400 infected individuals were reported at that date. Initially, given the reported fraction of infected,
recovered and dead population groups at week 0 - and the susceptible one, through conservation of the
total population - the fraction of the exposed, normally infected and severely infected population groups was
estimated. In the following, a parameter estimation process was performed in a weekly basis, given these 3
reported data sets, through a genetic algorithm provided by the open-source COPASI software [32, 33]. The
initial conditions at day 0 of each week were the predicted values at day 7 of the previous week, in order
to preserve continuity in the solution. The resulting parameter sets are depicted for SEIRD and SEInsRD
models in Fig. B.1 of Appendix B.
A schematic representation of the SEIRD and SEInsRD models is provided in the left panels of Figs. 1
and 2, respectively. The profiles of infected, recovered and dead individuals, resulted from the aforementioned
parameter estimation process, are in very good agreement with the reported data, as shown in the middle
panels of Figs. 1 and 2 for the SEIRD and SEInsRD models, respectively. Note that in the case of SEInsRD

model, the sum of the normally and severely infected individuals I = IN + IS was fitted against the reported
data set of the infected individuals. The very good agreement of the model parameters to the reported data
can be also demonstrated by the R2 values of both fittings shown in Table B.1 of Appendix B, combined
with the respective p-values, which in all cases are p  0.05. Finally, the profiles of all the population groups
are displayed in the right panels of Figs. 1 and 2, in which great agreement of the population profiles between
the two models is reported.
Finally, the SIDARTHE model parameters were directly adopted by [25], following a slightly different
approach than the one followed here for SEIRD and SEInsRD models. First, due to availability of data,
here the SEIRD and SEInsRD models were calibrated for Italy from February 26 to September 30, while
the SIDARTHE model was calibrated for Italy from February 20 to April 5. Second, here the SEIRD and
SEInsRD models were calibrated in a constant, 7-days long, time frame, while the SIDARTHE model was
calibrated in varying time frames, depending on the interventions undertaken in Italy [25]. Last but not least,
the reported data of infected, recovered and dead individuals were considered in our analysis, while in [25]
only the ones of infected and recovered (not fitted to the healed compartment of the model) individuals.
2.3. Estimation of the reproduction number
The basic reproduction number, R0 , is a constant biological parameter that provides an estimation of the
contagiousness of the infectious disease. It also serves as a threshold parameter; when R0 > 1, one infected
individual can trigger an outbreak, while when R0 < 1, the infection will not spread in the population [4, 5].
When various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) are in place, the effective reproduction number
Rt is utilized, instead of R0 , to monitor the reproduction number during the evolution of the outbreak. Rt

provides an estimation of the contagiousness of the infectious disease, during the course of an outbreak, where
not every individual is considered susceptible. Considering that all model parameters are time dependant,
we estimated Rt for COVID-19 pandemics in Italy using the Next Generation Matrix (NGM) approach
[13, 34, 35], which yields in the following expressions for the SIRD, SEIRD, SEInsRD and SIDARTHE
models:

where α, β, γ, δ, , ζ, η, θ are model parameters of the SIDARTHE model and r1 =  + λ + ζ, r2 = η + ρ,
r3 = κ + µ + θ annd r4 = ν + ξ. Note that the expression of Rt for SIDARTHE model estimated here via the
NGM approach is the same with the one derived in [25].
A brief discussion on NGM approach is provided in Appendix A, along with details on the calculation
of Rt on the basis of the four population dynamics models.
2.4. Calculation of the time scales
Given a system of ODEs in the matrix form of Eq. (1), the timescales are calculated as the inverse
modulus of the eigenvalues of the N×N Jacobian matrix J(y) = ∇y (g(y)) [14, 15]. The timescales are of
dissipative/explosive nature, i.e., the components of the system that generate them tend to drive the system
towards to/away from equilibrium, when the respective eigenvalue has negative/positive real part.
When a complex mathematical model in the form of Eq. (1) is encountered, it is usually impossible to
calculate analytic expressions for its eigenvalues and thus its timescales. This is the case of the SEIRD,
SEInsRD and SIDARTHE models, for which the timescales were calculated numerically. However, in the case
of the SIRD model, the non-zero eigenvalues can be calculated analytically as:
λ1,2 =


p
1
X ± X 2 − 4Y
2

X = −γ − βI − µ + βS

Y = βI(γ + µ)

(6)

Therefore, the related timescales are of explosive nature (either real or complex λ1,2 ) if and only if:
X > 0 ⇒ β(S − I) > γ + µ ⇒

β(S − I)
>1
γ+µ

(7)

Equation (7) provides the condition under which the explosive timescales of the SIRD model arise, a feature
that will associated in the following section with Rt .
3. Results
The impact of the undertaken NPIs in COVID-19 pandemics is assessed by the effect that they introduce
in the reproduction number [7–12]. Here, we show that the insights provided by the utilization of the effective
reproduction number Rt during the progression of the COVID-19 pandemics can be deduced by timescale
analysis. In particular, it is shown that:
i) the existence of an explosive timescale during the progression of COVID-19 epidemics implies Rt > 1,
while its absence implies Rt < 1, and
ii) the tendency of this timescale to converge/diverge with the immediately slowest one, implies that Rt
tends to approach to/withdraw from its threshold value 1.
These results are reached on the basis of the four population dynamics models discussed in Section 2.1, for
the case of Italy.

3.1. The explosive timescales in relation to the reproduction number
The first indication on the relation of the explosive timescales to the reproduction number is provided
by the analysis of the SIRD model in Eq. (2), that is the simplest model to describe the progression of
COVID-19 epidemics. In contrast to more complicated models, the timescales of the SIRD model can be
calculated analytically. According to Section 2.4, the evolution of the SIRD model is characterized by the
action of two timescales τ1,2 = 1/|λ1,2 |; the expressions of λ1,2 were derived in Eq. (6). Both τ1,2 are of
explosive/dissipative nature when the condition in Eq. (7) holds/is violated. Given the expression of Rt for
SIRD model in Eq. (5) and that S − I < S(0) = 1, Eq. (7) yields:
Re(λ1,2 ) > 0 ⇔ X > 0 ⇔

β(S − I)
βS(0)
>1⇒
> 1 ⇒ Rt > 1
γ+µ
γ+µ

(8)

Equation (8) shows that the existence of explosive timescales implies Rt > 1, while their absence implies
Rt < 1. Note that this outcome, holds true not only for COVID-19 pandemics, but also for any infectious
disease, since it was derived by analytical means on the basis of the SIRD model.
Next, the relation of the explosive timescales with Rt was examined using reported data for COVID-19
pandemics in Italy. The SEIRD model in Eq. (3) was adopted and fitted against the reported data sets of
infected, recovered and dead individuals in Italy from February 26 to September 30. In order to account for
the NPIs undertaken, the SEIRD model was calibrated in a weekly basis following the parameter estimation
process described in detail in Section 2.2. The resulting solution is in great agreement with the reported data,
as shown in Fig. 1.
The timescales and Rt , estimated on the basis of the SEIRD model in Eq. (5), are displayed in Fig. 3
from week 0 (starting in Feb. 26) to week 30 (ending in Sep. 30). As shown in the left panel of Fig. 3, the
evolution of the SEIRD model is characterized by three timescales τ1,2,3 , the fastest of which, τ1 , is always
dissipative in nature, while τ2,3 are either dissipative or explosive. In particular, during weeks 0-6 and 20-26,
τ2,3 are explosive, as indicated by the shaded background in Fig. 3. The values of Rt are depicted in the right
panel of Fig. 3, in which the red dashed horizontal line indicates the threshold value Rt = 1. As indicated by
the shaded background, the time periods when the explosive nature of timescales τ2,3 is reported coincides
with the ones that Rt > 1 (weeks 0-6 and 20-26). In contrast, when τ2,3 are of dissipative nature, Rt < 1
(weeks 7-19, 27-30). Note that the transition from the explosive to the dissipative nature of the timescales
τ2,3 , and vice-versa, is immediate, since model calibration is performed in a weekly basis.
Comparison of the explosive timescales and Rt in Fig. 3 reveals the following trend: as the gap between τ2
and τ3 decreases/increases, Rt approaches to/withdraws from its threshold value unity. This is particularly
clear during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemics in Italy (weeks 0-12). During weeks 0-6, where τ2 and
τ3 are explosive, their gap tends to decrease, so that Rt decreases, approaching close to unity values. At
week 7, τ2 and τ3 become dissipative and Rt attains values below 1. From this point on and up to week 12,
the gap of τ2 and τ3 increases, so that Rt continues to decrease, this time withdrawing from its threshold
1. This behaviour is additionally supported by the fact that during weeks 4-8, 17, 19, 21 and 30, in which Rt

Rt = 0.96.
3.2. Robustness
In order to demonstrate the robustness of the relation of the explosive timescales to the reproduction
number, a more complicated population dynamics model was considered, the SEInsRD model. The SEInsRD
model in Eq. (4) was adopted and calibrated to the same reported data sets with SEIRD model in Section 3.1,
corresponding to infected, recovered and dead individuals in Italy from February 26 to September 30. Similarly
to SEIRD model, the SEInsRD model calibration was performed in a weekly basis following the process
described in Section 2.2 and the resulting solution is in great agreement with the reported data, as shown in
Fig. 2.

model shown in Fig. 2.

The timescales and Rt , estimated on the basis of the SEInsRD model in Eq. (5), are displayed in Fig. 4
from week 0 (starting in Feb. 26) to week 30 (ending in Sep. 30). As shown in the left panel of Fig. 4, the
evolution of SEInsRD model is characterized by 5 timescales: three of which are always of dissipative nature
and the remaining ones are either explosive or dissipative; denoting τexp,f the fast explosive timescale and
τexp,s the slow one. In particular, during weeks 0-6 and 20-26, τexp,f and τexp,s are explosive, as indicated
by the shaded background in Fig. 4. The right panel of Fig. 4 displays the values of Rt in comparison to
the threshold value Rt = 1 indicated by the red dashed horizontal line. Similarly to the SEIRD model, it is
shown by the shaded background that Rt > 1 when the τexp,f and τexp,s are explosive (weeks 0-6 and 20-26),
while Rt < 1 when they lose this character and become dissipative (weeks 7-19 and 27-30). In addition, the
trend of increasing/decreasing gap of τexp,f and τexp,s is again reflected in Rt approaching to/withdrawing
from its threshold value 1. In particular, it is shown that the closer the values of Rt to 1, (weeks 4-8, 17,
19, 21 and 30), the smaller the gap between τexp,f and τexp,s ; to the point where Rt = 0.97 in week 30, in
which τexp,f ≈ τexp,s . In summary, the qualitative results on the relation of the explosive timescales to Rt
are maintained on the basis of the SEInsRD model.
3.3. Validation
In order to validate the qualitative results, reached on the basis of the SEIRD and SEInsRD models,
regarding to the relation of the explosive timescales to Rt , a more complicated SIDARTHE model was
considered [25], as briefly discussed in Section 2.1.
The profiles of the population groups accounted for in the SIDARTHE model were reproduced, adopting
the model parameters in [25]. On the basis of the SIDARTHE solution, the timescales were calculated and
Rt was estimated according to the expression in Eq. (5). The resulting values are displayed in Fig. 5 starting
from day -6 (Feb 20) and ending in day 40 (Apr 5); day 0 was chosen to be Feb 26 for comparison with
Figs. 3 and 4. As shown in the left panel of Fig. 5, the evolution of SIDARTHE model is characterized by six
timescales, four among which are always dissipative in nature, while the remaining two are either dissipative
or explosive; denoted as τexp,f and τexp,s . In particular, τexp,f and τexp,s are explosive from day -6 to day 22,

as indicated by the shaded background in Fig. 5. The values of Rt are depicted in the right panel of Fig. 5,
in which the red dashed horizontal line indicates the threshold value Rt = 1. As indicated by the shaded
background, the explosive nature of timescales τexp,f and τexp,s implies Rt > 1 (days -6-22), while losing
such a nature and becoming dissipative, implies Rt < 1 (days 23-40). In addition, it is shown that as the
gap between τexp,f and τexp,s becomes smaller, Rt approaches its threshold value unity, to the point when
Rt = 0.986 during days 23-33, in which τexp,f = τexp,s .
It should be noted here that, the evolution of timescales τexp,f and τexp,s and the reproduction number
Rt , calculated on the basis of SIDARTHE model, is different in comparison to those calculated on the basis
of SEIRD and SEInsRD models. In particular, on the basis of the SIDARTHE model, the timescales are
explosive in nature and Rt > 1 until to day 22, while on the basis of the SEIRD and SEInsRD models
until day 42. Despite this being a major difference, that originates from differences in model calibration as
discussed in Section 2.2, the relation of the explosive timescales to Rt , deduced on the basis of SEIRD and
SEInsRD models, is validated by the analysis with the SIDARTHE model.
4. Conclusions
The progression of an infectious disease spread like COVID-19 pandemics is frequently examined by population dynamics models [8, 11, 21–26]. Their evolution as dynamical systems is characterized by timescales
that are either of dissipative or explosive nature; i.e., their action tends to drive the system either towards to
or away from equilibirum [14, 15]. The basic reproduction number R0 as a threshold parameter provides such
an intuition, in the view that when R0 < 1 the system is driven towards to its DFE, so that the infection
does not spread in the population, while when R0 > 1 the system is driven away from its DFE, so that the
disease spreads exponentially [4, 5]. In the case of an outbreak, such as COVID-19 pandemics, in which early
predictions showed R0 ≈ 2 − 3 [3], various NPIs are employed during the evolution of the outbreak, aiming
to “flatten” the curve of the epidemics. The influence of the NPIs is frequently assessed by the reduction
that they introduce to the effective reproduction number Rt , [7–12]; ideally making Rt < 1, which indicates
that the disease spread will eventually die out. In this work, the relation of the effective reproduction number Rt with the timescales characterizing the evolution of the epidemic spread was examined in the case of
COVID-19 pandemics in Italy from February 26 to September 30.
In particular, it was demonstrated analytically on the basis of the SIRD model and numerically on the
basis of the SEIRD model in Section 3.1, that when two of the timescales characterizing the evolution of
the epidemic spread are of explosive nature, the effective reproduction number is above its threshold value;
i.e., Rt > 1. On the contrary, when all the timescales are of dissipative nature it is implied that Rt < 1. In
addition, the following trending behaviour was revealed: as the gap between the two explosive timescales increases/decreases, Rt approaches to/withdraws from its threshold value 1, as shown in Fig. 3. These outcomes
suggest that the insights provided by the utilization of Rt as a threshold parameter can be also obtained by
timescale analysis.

This work additionally suggests that timescale analysis is a robust methodology to assess the progression
of the epidemic spread, since it is not hindered by the complexity of the selected model, nor the calibration
process followed to fit the model against the reported data. Following the same model calibration procedure to
the SEInsRD model, resulted in timescales that are almost equal to the ones of the SEIRD model; see Figs. 3
and 4. Such a result indicates that the relation of the explosive timescales to Rt is not affected by model
selection, as discussed in Section 3.2. In addition, this relation is not affected by the parameter estimation
process either, as demonstrated through the analysis of the SIDARTHE model, the calibration of which in
[25] had significant differences with the one followed here for SEIRD and SEInsRD models; see Section 2.2.
In conclusion, timescale analysis is a rigorous mathematical methodology to assess the progression of an
epidemic spread, since it can effectively provide the insight obtained by the reproduction number. Timescale
analysis is not hindered by model selection in contrast to the reproduction number that is highly dependable
on the structure of the selected model [4]. In addition, the expression of the reproduction number becomes
more complex as the detail of the model increases, as shown in Eq. (5); compare for example Rt fo SEIRD
and SIDARTHE models. In contrast, timescale analysis can be performed in an algorithmic fashion, utilizing
the diagnostic tools of Computational Singular Perturbation [14, 36] that have been effectively employed to
address the dynamical properties of systems arising from a wide variety of fields [16–20]. More importantly,
the use of timescale analysis for the assessment of various NPIs is promising, since it can determine via its
algorithmic tools the factors that play the most significant role on the control of ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.

Appendix A. Derivation of the effective reproduction number
The Next Generation Matrix (NGM) approach is utilized for the calculation of the basic reproduction
number R0 [13, 34, 35]. Given a system of ODEs in the form of Eq. (1), let yj be the j = 1, . . . , m infected
population groups among all the yi populations groups of the i = 1, . . . , n compartments in y. In turn, let
Fi (y) be the rate of appearance of new infections in the i-th compartment and Vi (y) = Vi− (y) − Vi+ (y) the
transition rates out of (V − ) and into (V + ) the i-th compartment. By definition, it is implied that:
dyi
= Fi (y) − Vi (y) = Fi (y) + Vi+ (y) − Vi− (y)
dt

(A.1)

Let the matrices F and V be:
∂Fi (y∗ )
F=
∂yj




∂Vi (y∗ )
V=
∂yj


and


(A.2)

where y∗ is the disease-free equilibrium and i, j = 1, . . . , m. According to the NGM approach, the basic
reproduction number R0 is the spectral radius (largest eigenvalue) of the matrix F·V−1 ; i.e., R0 = ρ(F·V−1 )
[13, 34, 35]. However, since the model parameters vary in time (different parameter values in each week), the
NGM approach utilization results in the calculation of the effective reproduction number Rt . In the following,
the analytical expressions of Rt for SIRD, SEIRD, SEInsRD and SIDARTHE models in Eq. (5) are derived.
The SIRD mathematical model in Eq. (2) can be written in the form of Eq. (A.1) as:

and

model is:

Appendix B. The SEIRD and SEInsRD model parameters
The parameter estimation process described in Section 2.2, that was followed to fit the reported data
sets of infected, recovered and dead individuals of Italy from February 26 to September 30 in a weekly basis,
resulted in the model parameters shown in Fig. B.1. The left panel shows the distribution of the SEIRD
model parameters β, σ, γ and µ and the right panel shows the ones of SEInsRD model βN , βS , σ, γ, µN ,
µS and ss. The values of parameter µT P of the SEInsRD model are not shown, since they are smaller than
10−5 .
Figure B.1 indicates that the parameters expressing the transition from a population group to another
attain similar values in both models: transmission rate (β and βN , βS ), incubation period (1/σ), recovery
rate (γ) and fatality rate (µ and µN , µS ) constants.
As shown in Fig. B.1, the following trends in the parameter values are indicated:
• the transmission rate constant β attains high/low values in the periods where explosive timescale are
present/absent. The values of β tend to decrease during the transition from an explosive to a dissipative
region and vice-versa.
• the rate constant σ (inverse of incubation period) tend to increases during the explosive regions.
