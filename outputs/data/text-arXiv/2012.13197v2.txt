This paper introduces new methods to analyze the changing progression of COVID-19 cases to deaths in different waves
of the pandemic. First, an algorithmic approach partitions each country or state’s COVID-19 time series into a first wave
and subsequent period. Next, offsets between case and death time series are learned for each country via a normalized
inner product. Combining these with additional calculations, we can determine which countries have most substantially
reduced the mortality rate of COVID-19. Finally, our paper identifies similarities in the trajectories of cases and deaths
for European countries and U.S. states. Our analysis refines the popular conception that the mortality rate has greatly
decreased throughout Europe during its second wave of COVID-19; instead, we demonstrate substantial heterogeneity
throughout Europe and the U.S. The Netherlands exhibited the largest reduction of mortality, a factor of 16, followed
by Denmark, France, Belgium, and other Western European countries, greater than both Eastern European countries
and U.S. states. Some structural similarity is observed between Europe and the United States, in which Northeastern
states have been the most successful in the country. Such analysis may help European countries learn from each other’s
experiences and differing successes to develop the best policies to combat COVID-19 as a collective unit.
Europe is experiencing a substantial second wave of
COVID-19. Epidemiologists have attributed this to loosening of both government restrictions and individual
precautions.1 This reflects the ongoing struggle to balance
the spread of the virus and allowing public life to return to
normal, a year into the pandemic.2 The mortality rate of
the disease, and how it changes over time, plays a critical
role in this debate. Identifying countries that have reduced
their mortality rate in subsequent waves of the disease is
therefore of great relevance to policymakers. In the public conception, health experts and journalists alike have
noted a substantial decrease in the mortality of COVID-19
in Europe’s second wave.3 This paper aims to refine this
conception with a mathematical analysis on a country-bycountry basis. Instead, we show a considerable variance
in the reduction of mortality in different countries’ second
waves. Most wealthy countries in Europe, with the notable
exceptions of Germany and Sweden, have drastically reduced their mortality rate during their second wave. Less
wealthy European countries, as well as many U.S. states,
have seen a less notable reduction.

INTRODUCTION

Government responses to COVID-19 have varied substantially, both from country to country and as time has progressed.
Early responses included banning travel4 and establishing test
and trace programs,5 followed by lockdowns as cases rose, often implemented too late.6,7 Due to the economic consequences
and unpopularity of lockdowns, the U.S. states prioritized reopening well before the virus was entirely suppressed.8 Such
responses to the virus, highly varying with time, have created

first and subsequent waves of the outbreak in most countries,
with subsequent waves often exhibiting greater case numbers
than the first.9,10
Fortunately, subsequent waves of COVID-19 have featured
a reduced mortality rate in many countries.11 Explanations for
this include the development of new treatments for COVID-19
as time passes12–15 and under-reporting of true case numbers
in the first wave.16 We believe this is the first paper to perform
a mathematical analysis to quantify the reduction of mortality
on a country-by-country basis throughout Europe, and compare European countries with U.S. states. We demonstrate
significant heterogeneity in Europe, with wealthier Western
European countries having reduced their mortality rate more
drastically than less wealthy European countries or U.S. states.
To perform our analysis, we use new and recently introduced
techniques in time series analysis. Time series analysis has
been frequently used in epidemiology,17,18 including to study
the Zika virus,19,20 Ebola,21,22 and COVID-19.23–27 Nonlinear
dynamics researchers apply a wide range of methods, including
power-law models,23,26,28 distance analysis,10,29–33 forecasting
models,27 and network models.34,35 In this work, we apply
the algorithmic framework introduced in Ref. 10 to partition
COVID-19 case time series into a first wave and a subsequent
period (the latter could consist of a single second wave or
multiple waves). Later, we consider all the European countries
and U.S. states in conjunction, and identify similarities in
their case and death trajectories via clustering. We implement
hierarchical clustering; this technique has been used in a wide
variety of epidemiological applications.24,36–40
This paper is structured as follows: in Section II, we study
the reduction in mortality rate between the first and subsequent
waves of COVID-19 among European countries and U.S. states.
This relies on a new framework for partitioning time series
and learning appropriate offsets. In Section III, we study all
European countries and U.S. states in conjunction, clustering
case and death trajectories to elucidate similarities across the
two groups. We summarize our findings regarding COVID-19
mortality and trajectories across first and subsequent waves in

FIRST AND SUBSEQUENT WAVE ANALYSIS

In this section, we describe a mathematical framework to
analyze the changing mortality relative to first and subsequent
waves of COVID-19. We first apply our constructions on
an individual country-by-country basis and then collectively
compare all the European countries and U.S. states. Our list of
European countries comes from the United Nations,41 except
we exclude Russia and the Holy See. We consider all U.S.
states plus the District of Columbia (D.C.). This gives us 93
total countries and states.

A. Methodology: determination of offsets and mortality
ratios

Let x(t), y(t) be the new daily case and death time series,
respectively, of a single country or state, t = 0, ..., T . In this
paper, data for every country and state spans 01/21/2020 to
11/25/2020, a period of 310 days. The end date corresponds to
the last week that the European Centre for Disease Prevention
and Control (ECDC) provided daily data updates.42 That is,
T = 309 for every time series.
First, we apply the methodology developed in Ref. 10 to
divide each country into first and subsequent waves of the
disease. Specifically, we apply a smoothing filter to the case
time series x(t) followed by a two-step algorithm to output
an alternating sequence of local maxima (peaks) and minima
(troughs), beginning with a trough at t = 0, where there are
zero cases. Further details are provided in Appendix A. We
apply this only to the case counts, as the death counts are much
sparser. Just two European countries and three U.S. states in
our analysis are assigned a sequence that consists of just one
trough at t = 0, and one peak. These countries and states are
determined to still be in their first wave of COVID-19. For
every other country, we have at least one non-trivial trough.
Let T1 be the first non-trivial trough, or the second trough after
t = 0. This marks the end of the complete first wave in the
corresponding country. We refer to the period t = 0, ..., T1 as
the first wave, and t = T1 + 1, ..., T as the subsequent period.
In particular, we consider any second and third wave as one
period, to be compared with the distinguished first wave.
We aim to analyze the changing mortality rate by comparing
the first wave and the subsequent period. Indeed, we wish
to understand if countries were able to learn and adapt their
treatment of the disease after the end of the first wave. To
appropriately compare the case and death time series, we must
calculate an offset in time between cases and deaths for each
country. For this purpose, we use normalized inner products,
and can either assume that there is a single offset for the entire
time window, or two offsets - one each for the first wave and
subsequent period.
For each country, let τ be the optimal single offset between
the case and death time series. We define this as the optimal

2

value of the normalized inner product
< x(0 : T − τ), y(τ : T ) >n =
x(0)y(τ) + ... + x(T − τ)y(T )
1
1 .
2
(x(0) + ... + x(T − τ)2 ) 2 (y(τ)2 + ... + y(T )2 ) 2

(1)
(2)

We have chosen these normalized inner products to have maximal value 1 if and only if there is a proportionality relation
y(t) = kx(t + τ) for all t = 0, ..., T − τ for some constant k > 0.
Indeed, we are seeking the offset in time where deaths are most
closely proportional to cases. This is more suitable than other
metrics, such as correlation or distance correlation.30 Correlation or distance correlation would each return maximal value 1
if y = kx + b for an additional constant b, which is unsuitable.
Having determined this offset, we can define

These record the mortality rates for each country over the first
wave and subsequent period, respectively, taking into account
a single offset between case and death counts.
Alternatively, we can determine a pair of two offsets λ1 and
λ2 . The first offset λ1 is chosen to maximize the normalized
inner product
< x(0 : T1 ), y(λ1 : T1 + λ1 ) >n .

(5)

while the second offset λ2 is chosen to maximize the normalized inner product
< x(T1 + 1 : T − λ2 ), y(T1 + λ2 : T ) >n .

With these two offsets, we can define

These record the mortality rates for each country over
the first wave and subsequent period, respectively, taking
into account two respective offsets between case and death
counts. Each country or state is assigned its own value of
T1 , τ, M1 , M2 , λ1 , λ2 , N1 , N2 , while T = 309 is fixed for all of
them. We refer to τ, λ1 , λ2 as offsets and M1 /M2 and N1 /N2 as
one- and two-offset mortality ratios, respectively.
Finally, we can generate convenient scatter plots to show
the case and death counts of the first wave and the subsequent
period. Using the two offsets λ1 , λ2 , we can simply plot the
set of first wave values {(x(t), y(t + λ1 )) ∈ R2 : t = 0, ..., T1 }
and subsequent period values {(x(t), y(t + λ2 )) ∈ R2 : t =
T1 , ..., T − λ2 }. In Section II B, we plot these two periods
in red and blue, respectively, and include their centroid (that is,

COVID-19 second wave mortality in Europe and the United States
average) and convex hull.43

Offsets and mortality ratio results

Figure 1 displays new case time series and algorithmically
determined turning points (peaks and troughs) for six European
countries. The first non-trivial trough T1 splits each time series
up into its first wave and subsequent period. All these countries
display a similar structure - they experience a first wave in cases
followed by at least one more significant subsequent wave. The
United Kingdom (U.K.), France and Germany, displayed in
Figures 1a, 1b, and 1c, respectively, highlight a characteristic
case trajectory for wealthier European countries, in which
there are two predominant waves in COVID-19 cases. Less
developed European countries such as Romania and Belarus,
displayed in Figures 1e and 1f, respectively, produce a similar
new case trajectory to the wealthier European countries, yet
many with a smaller first wave, like Romania.
In Tables I and II, respectively, we record the values of τ,
M1 /M2 , λ1 , λ2 and N1 /N2 for European countries and U.S.
states, respectively. First, we notice significant variance between European countries in the one-offset mortality ratios
M1 /M2 . The Netherlands has the highest ratio of 16.2, followed by Denmark, France, Belgium, Spain, the U.K., Ireland,
Andorra, Finland and Norway, all of which are wealthy countries in Western or Northern Europe. These countries are indicated to have drastically reduced COVID-19 mortality between
their first wave and subsequent period. By contrast, the smallest mortality ratios are exhibited by Belarus, Malta, Iceland,
Latvia, Albania and Serbia, most of which are less developed.
Notable wealthy countries with comparatively low mortality
ratios include Germany (3.6) and Sweden (3.8). These countries have not reduced their mortality ratio as much relative to
their first wave.
We obtain broadly similar results in the two-offset mortality
ratios N1 /N2 . Once again, the Netherlands has the highest
ratio, followed by France, Sweden, Belgium, Finland, Ireland,
Norway, Spain, Andorra, Denmark and the U.K. Sweden has
changed its position drastically due to significant differences
in the optimized values of τ, λ1 , λ2 . Malta, Belarus, Iceland,
Latvia, Albania and Serbia have the lowest two-offset mortality
ratios. Broadly, but not universally, the two methods give
similar results, indicating the robustness of the methodology.
Such heterogeneity is also observed for the United States.
The U.S. states with the greatest one-offset mortality ratio are
Vermont (9.2), New Jersey, New York and Connecticut, all
Northeastern states, with similar results observed for the twooffset mortality ratio. No U.S. state reduced its mortality as
much as the Netherlands, Denmark, France, Belgium, Spain,
the U.K. or Ireland.
We can further elucidate the differences between first and
subsequent wave mortality by examining the case-death scatter
plots in Figure 2. As described in Section II A, we plot both
first and subsequent waves accounting for two offsets, and
include the centroid and convex hull of each set, understood
as a subset of R2 . The U.K., France, Germany and Sweden,
displayed in Figures 2a, 2b, 2c and 2d, respectively, show

3

a similar pattern. These countries experience a significantly
higher mortality rate during their first wave than subsequent
period. This finding is consistent among many of the more developed, wealthier, European countries, though the separation
of the scatter plot regions is sharper for the U.K. and France
than for Germany and Sweden, consistent with their mortality
ratios. The pattern among several less developed European
countries such as Romania and Belarus is markedly different,
as seen in Figures 2e and 2f. Romania is one of several eastern
European countries with a smaller first wave, while Belarus
exhibits no real change in the progression from cases to deaths
at all.
We extend our analysis of mortality by implementing hierarchical clustering on the ordered pairs (M1 , M2 ) and (N1 , N2 ),
understood as elements of R2 . We retain more information this
way without taking the quotients. Figures 3a and 3b demonstrate a consistent structure among European countries across
both our one offset and two offset models. Both figures contain two clusters; a smaller cluster and a larger cluster with
two sub-clusters. In each dendrogram, the smaller cluster contains the same members, Belgium, France, Hungary, Italy, the
Netherlands, Spain and the U.K. Excluding Hungary, these
countries have much in common. They are all wealthy western European countries that have among the highest M1 /M2
and N1 /N2 ratios. They experienced severe first waves in both
cases and deaths and implemented harsh lockdown procedures
in response. Even Hungary has comparatively high mortality
ratios relative to the rest of Europe.
Figures 3c and 3d display the cluster structure among U.S.
states, with striking similarities to the European countries.
Once again, there are two clusters in each figure, one larger
cluster with two subclusters and one smaller cluster. Again,
the smaller cluster highlights a collection of anomalous states,
predominantly located in the Northeastern United States. Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania feature in both smaller clusters. Like western Europe,
these states experienced early and severe first waves. There is
a consistent theme among European countries and U.S. states countries and states that were impacted most severely during
the first wave have managed the progression from cases to
deaths more successfully in subsequent waves.
To understand this phenomenon further, we divided the European countries into two similarly sized groups based on
the total number of cases in the first wave, adjusted for the
population. As with Table I, we exclude the three smallest
European countries Liechtenstein, Monaco and San Marino,
in addition to Moldova and Ukraine, which are determined
to still be in their first wave. The group that experienced a
more substantial first wave (more than 1.5 total first wave cases
per 1000 of population) consisted of 18 countries: Andorra,
Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy,
Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the U.K. The second
group, which experienced a smaller first wave (less than 1.5
cases per 1000 population), was comprised of the following 19
countries: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia,
Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Latvia,
Lithuania, Macedonia, Malta, Montenegro, Poland, Serbia,

Slovenia, and Slovakia. The average N1 /N2 ratio for the first
group was 7.39, while the same ratio for the second group was
2.94, illustrating that the first group had a more substantial
decrease in the mortality rate between the first wave and subsequent period. We confirmed the statistical significance of the
aforementioned difference in the N1 /N2 ratio via a two-sample
t-test, which had a p-value of 0.0005. We conducted a similar
analysis for the U.S. states; however, we did not reach the same
conclusions. In fact, the second group of U.S. states (which
experienced a smaller first wave of cases) had a slightly greater
decrease in the mortality rate than the first group of states (the
difference was not statistically significant). We observed the
same relationship for a wide range of threshold values (between 1.5 and 20) for determining the partition into two groups
of states.
Finally, we include a brief statistical analysis of the offsets.
More homogeneity among the countries is observed in the two
offsets λ1 and λ2 , with λ2 systematically larger than λ1 among
both European countries and U.S. states. The average offset
difference, that is, λ2 − λ1 , across the European countries is
4.89. The statistical significance of this observed difference
is supported by the paired t-test, which yielded a p-value of
0.00183. Similarly, the corresponding average offset difference
across the U.S. states is 6.48. The statistical significance of
the difference is again confirmed by the paired t-test, whose
p-value was less than 0.00001.

TRAJECTORY ANALYSIS

This section seeks to analyze and classify countries according to appropriately normalized trajectories of their case and
death counts. Let xi (t), yi (t) be the multivariate time series of
cases and deaths across a collection of countries and states. We
consider all the European countries and U.S. states in conjunction, giving us a collection of size n = 93. We normalize these
time series in three ways.
T
Let ||xi || = ∑t=0
xi (t) be the L1 norm of xi (t), understood
as a vector in RT +1 , and analogously ||yi ||. Let ci = ||xxii || .
This vector reflects the changes of the daily case time series
for a given country across the entire period of analysis. Let
di = ||yyi || be the normalized death time series. We define
i
the trajectory distance matrix Di j = ||ci − c j || + ||di − d j ||
that measure distance between normalized trajectories. Note
that all vectors ci , c j , di , d j have norm 1. So a comparison is
appropriate.
We may also normalize the death time series in a different
way, relative to total cases. Let ri = ||xyii || . This normalizes a
country’s trajectory of deaths according to the total number of
observed cases; it captures differences not in just the trajectory
of cases but separates countries more according to their overall
mortality rate. We define the trajectory rate matrix by Ri j =
||ri − r j ||.
We can now analyze the hierarchical clustering of the 93 ×

taken into account. The plots include centroids and convex hulls for the two time periods. A steeper slope of the convex hull
represents a higher mortality rate. The wealthier countries display a greater progression from cases to deaths in the first wave than
the subsequent period. For Belarus, the progression is largely the same.

93 matrices D and R. Clustering based on R reveals New
York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Massachusetts as clear
outliers. Indeed, these four U.S. states featured very high
mortality rates in the early days of the pandemic in the United
States. Clustering on D reveals far more insights. In the first
instance, a cluster of Monaco, Liechtenstein, Iceland, Andorra
and San Marino arises as clear outliers. We have removed
these countries, all the five smallest in Europe, to obtain Figure
4.
Turning now to a close analysis of Figure 4, we observe the
existence of three distinct clusters. The green cluster is almost
exclusively composed of Northeastern U.S. states (Connecticut,
Delaware, D.C., Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and
Vermont) and developed Western or Northern European countries (Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland,
Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the U.K.).
As explored in Section II, many of these experienced similar severe first waves, with most responding with lockdowns.
These countries and states managed their progression from
cases to deaths much more successfully in subsequent waves
of COVID-19.
The orange cluster consists primarily of less developed European countries (Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Greece,
Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia)
and select U.S. states such as Alaska and Kansas. These countries and states all experienced less severe first waves, and

more significant subsequent waves of the virus. Countries such
as Croatia and Greece continued to attract travelers during
the European summer,44 which may have been an additional
factor in spreading the virus. U.S. states such as Alaska and
Kansas also both experienced less severe first waves in COVID19, followed by extreme growth in both cases and deaths in
subsequent waves.
The red cluster is composed mostly of the remaining U.S.
states and select European countries. Their case and death
count have been steadily increasing over the entire period, for
the most part.

CONCLUSION

This paper introduces new methods to partition time series and estimate offsets to quantify the changing mortality of
COVID-19 over different waves of the pandemic. The methodology is applied to European countries and U.S. states, both
independently and in conjunction. Our methodology is flexible:
different smoothing techniques, metrics between data, parameters in the algorithmic framework, and clustering methods can
be used to study multivariate time series and identify changing
mortality or other outcomes beyond this application.
Our analysis has refined the popular conception concerning
the reduction of mortality during the second wave of COVID19 in Europe.3 We have shown significant variance in the mor-

tality ratios (defined in Section II A), with European countries
spanning a wide spectrum. For example, the Netherlands has
reduced its mortality drastically, Germany has done so moderately, while Belarus’ mortality has slightly increased. Wealthy
Western and Northern European countries, with the notable
exceptions of Germany and Sweden, have reduced their mortality more than all U.S. states and the rest of Europe. Similar
findings are observed with both one- and two-offset models.
All these findings are reflected in the scatter plots of Figure
2, where a great difference in time-adjusted case and death
data points is observed between the first wave and subsequent
period. We remark that this subsequent period may consist of
either a single second wave, or a second and third wave, and in
the latter case, we consider the second and third waves together
in one unit we call the subsequent period. Our motivation for
this is the hypothesis that the first wave was of an exceptionally
different nature than subsequent waves, being a time in which
a new disease took Europe by surprise, and there were fewer
effective treatments known.
This considerable reduction in mortality, as observed with
our methodology, has several explanations. In Europe, it has
been surmised that the first wave’s case counts were drastically
underestimated.16 The first wave disproportionately affected

the elderly,45 while the second wave has largely affected young
people,46 who have a much lower morbidity rate. It is also
possible that the more socialized and equitable health systems
of wealthy European countries have served their populations
better than the United States,47 resulting in higher mortality
reductions than even the Northeastern U.S. states.
These various interpretations of mortality reduction also
reveal some limitations of this article. Not only were many
early cases under-reported,16 but testing protocols have been
far from uniform over time and between countries. Indeed, several countries have changed their testing protocols on various
occasions, including within the same wave.48–50 Within Italy,
for example, different regions operated according to different
protocols, testing only symptomatic patients or more broadly.51
Even deaths may have been under-reported, with substantial
differences having been observed between excess mortality
and reported COVID-19 deaths.52 To complement our analysis,
we also applied our methodology to two different time series:
estimated true COVID-19 cases (as calculated by the IHME
model53 ) and excess mortality data. We implement this and
discuss its findings and limitations in Appendix B.
Despite the considerable variance in mortality reduction
among European countries and the U.S. states, we have also

FIG. 4: Hierarchical clustering on the matrix D, defined in Section III. This groups countries and states according to their overall
similarity in normalized COVID-19 trajectories. The five smallest European countries, which initially appeared as outliers, have
been removed. The remaining dendrogram exhibits three characteristic clusters. One consists of predominantly wealthy Western
European countries and Northeastern U.S. states. One consists predominantly of less affluent European countries. The largest
consists predominantly of the remaining U.S. states. The similarity between Western European countries and Northeastern U.S.
states is greater than that with their respective neighboring countries and states.

shown broad similarity between the two groups. Hierarchical
clustering on the one- and two- offset mortality pairs, shown
in Figure 3, highlights a broadly similar structure among Europe and the United States. Both groups, for the one- and
two- offset models, consist of one predominant cluster and a
smaller cluster. In each group, the smaller cluster consists of
countries and states that experienced a severe first wave and
were then able to substantially reduce their mortality during
the subsequent period. These were predominantly wealthy
Western European countries and Northeastern U.S. states. A
consistent observation among both groups is that countries and
states that experienced a severe first wave in cases reduced
their mortality rate more effectively in subsequent waves. We
then confirmed this in a statistical test for Europe, although it
failed for the United States.
Our offset analysis also revealed insights regarding the time
delay between cases and deaths in the first and subsequent
waves. This finding was more consistent than the mortality
reduction across both Europe and the United States. We found
that the time offset λ2 between cases and deaths of the subsequent period is systematically larger than that of the first wave,
λ1 . This is likely due to under-reporting in the first wave. Values of λ1 as small as zero indicate that during the first waves,
the spike in deaths was happening at the exact same time as the

spike in cases, suggesting that the cases were being observed
too late, or not at all. Indeed, previous analysis25 has showed
that Spain had 2.27 times as many deaths on 03/28/2020 as the
number of cases 16 days earlier. By the second wave, European
countries and U.S. states were testing more consistently, so λ2
is likely a more accurate reflection of the time delay between
cases and deaths. The same limitations as previously stated
apply, due to countries changing their testing protocols even
within the second wave, and varying between countries.50
Finally, Figure 4 analyzed all the European countries and
U.S. states in conjunction, and again highlighted numerous
similarities and differences between the groups. One cluster
consisted of most wealthy Western European countries and
Northeastern states alike, indicating their similar trajectories
of both cases and deaths. Another cluster consists primarily
of less affluent European countries such as Bulgaria, Croatia,
Greece, Latvia and Poland. The third cluster consists primarily
of the remaining U.S. states. In particular, while similarity
exists between Western European countries and Northeastern
U.S. states, there is no such close relationship between other
European countries, such as less developed Eastern European
countries, and other U.S. states outside the Northeast.
Overall, this paper introduces a new method for analyzing
second wave mortality in a collection of epidemiological time

drastic drop in mortality. However, this is by no means uniform.
Less developed countries are often underrepresented in media
reports, and their mortality is less visible in popular conception.
As further waves carry the risk of widespread loss of life, each
country must be aware of the potentially high human cost of
COVID-19 and react swiftly to new waves of the pandemic.
Through research, cooperation and learning from each other’s
successes, European countries may reduce the human and other
costs of the pandemic.54,55

Instead, we implement an inductive procedure to choose an
alternating sequence of peaks and troughs. Suppose t0 is the
last determined peak. We search in the period t > t0 for the
first of two cases: if we find a time t1 > t0 that satisfies (A2) as
well as a non-triviality condition x̂(t1 ) < x̂(t0 ), we add t1 to the
set of troughs and proceed from there. If we find a time t1 > t0
that satisfies (A1) and x̂(t0 ) ≥ x̂(t1 ), we ignore this lower peak
as redundant; if we find a time t1 > t0 that satisfies (A1) and
x̂(t1 ) > x̂(t0 ), we remove the peak t0 , replace it with t1 and
continue from t1 . A similar process applies from a trough at t0 .

Appendix A: Turning point methodology

In this section, we provide more details for the identification
of turning points of a new case time series x(t), in particular
the first non-trivial trough T1 . First, some smoothing of the
time series is necessary due to irregularities in the data set,
and discrepancies between different data sources. There are
lower counts on the weekends, and some negative counts due
to retroactive adjustments. A Savitzy-Golay filter ameliorates
these issues by combining polynomial smoothing with a moving average computation - this moving average eliminates all
but a few small negative counts; we then replace these negative counts with zero. This yields a smoothed time series
x̂(t) ∈ R≥0 . Subsequently, we perform a two-step process to select and then refine a non-empty set P of local maxima (peaks)
and T of local minima (troughs). Then T1 is the first non-trivial
element of T .
Following Ref. 10, we apply a two-step algorithm to the
smoothed time series x̂(t). The first step produces an alternating sequence of troughs and peaks, beginning with a trough at
t = 0, where there are zero cases. The second step refines this
sequence according to chosen conditions and parameters. The
most important conditions to initially identify a peak or trough,
respectively, are the following:

At this point, the time series is assigned an alternating sequence of troughs and peaks. However, some turning points
are immaterial and should be removed. Let t1 < t3 be two
peaks, necessarily separated by a trough. We select a param3)
eter δ = 0.2, and if the peak ratio, defined as x̂(t
x̂(t1 ) < δ , we
remove the peak t3 . If two consecutive troughs t2 ,t4 remain,
we remove t2 if x̂(t2 ) > x̂(t4 ), otherwise remove t4 . That is,
if the second peak has size less than δ of the first peak, we
remove it.

Finally, we use the same log-gradient function between
times t1 < t2 , defined as
log-grad(t1 ,t2 ) =

log x̂(t2 ) − log x̂(t1 )
.
t2 − t1

(A3)

x̂(t2 )
The numerator equals log( x̂(t
) ), a "logarithmic rate of change."

2)
Unlike the standard rate of change given by x̂(t
x̂(t1 ) − 1, the logarithmic change is symmetrically between (−∞, ∞). Let t1 ,t2 be
adjacent turning points (one a trough, one a peak). We choose
a parameter ε = 0.01; if

| log-grad(t1 ,t2 )| < ε,

(A4)

that is, the average logarithmic change is less than 1%, we
remove t2 from our sets of peaks and troughs. If t2 is not the
final turning point, we also remove t1 .

x̂(t0 ) = max{x̂(t) : max(0,t0 − l) ≤ t ≤ min(t0 + l, T )},
(A1)
x̂(t0 ) = min{x̂(t) : max(0,t0 − l) ≤ t ≤ min(t0 + l, T )},
(A2)
where l is a parameter to be chosen. Following Ref. 10, we
select l = 17, which accounts for the 14-day incubation period
of the virus58 and less testing on weekends. Defining peaks
and troughs according to this definition alone has some flaws,
such as the potential for two consecutive peaks.

We conclude with an alternating sequence of peaks and
troughs, beginning with a trough at t = 0. We then simply
define T1 to be the first trough after t = 0, if this exists. This
marks the end of the first wave. We include an algorithmic
presentation of our two-step procedure to determine peaks and
troughs (and isolate T1 in particular) in Algorithms 1 and 2.

Appendix B: Alternative data analysis

In this brief section, we apply our methodology to an alternative data set. We substitute new daily reported deaths with
weekly excess mortality, which is only available on a weekly
basis. This is defined as the difference between reported deaths
from all causes in a given week of 2020 and the average of
the deaths in the same week across the five preceding years.
We substitute new daily reported cases with estimated weekly
cases, as calculated by the IHME model.53 Our data spans (the
week ending) 01/26/2020 to (the week ending) 11/29/2020.
The first issue with the excess mortality data set is that the
data are frequently negative. Applying our methodology in
Section II A, where deaths are summed over the determined
first wave, we sometimes produce a negative value of M1 . As
such, we apply our methodology in two slightly different ways.
First, we make no alterations to the excess mortality time series
to obtain an offset τ (measured in weeks) and a one-offset
mortality ratio M1 /M2 . Next, we replace all negative counts in
the excess mortality time series with zero to obtain an offset
we call τ 0 (in weeks) and a modified one-offset mortality ratio
M10 /M20 . We record these results for 15 European countries in
Table III.
There are several findings captured here and limitations to
consider. First, using excess mortality data produces a negative
value of M1 , and hence a negative mortality ratio, for four
countries. Indeed, the decrease in mortality in 2020 relative to
the last five years was greater than the number of COVID-19

TABLE III: Estimated offsets and mortality ratios for select
European countries. These are calculated from weekly
estimated true COVID-19 cases and excess mortality data.
Mortality ratios M1 /M2 may be negative due to negative
counts in excess mortality, so we repeat the analysis by
nullifying all negative counts to produce M10 /M20 . Offsets are
calculated and measured in weeks.

deaths during these countries’ first waves. Substantial negative
excess mortality counts in January and February contributed to
this.
As no week should contribute a negative number of deaths,
we repeated the analysis by nullifying any negative counts
in excess mortality, to obtain ratios M10 /M20 . This also has
a drawback - during the middle of the year, there are still
several weeks with negative excess mortality counts, and so
this nullification systematically raises the number of deaths in
the observed excess mortality counts. We executed the analysis
a third time by selectively nullifying only negative excess
mortality counts in January and February, during which there
were relatively few COVID-19 deaths, and obtained similar
results as M10 /M20 .
In general, excess mortality is a problematic estimate of
COVID-19 mortality because it considers all deaths from all
causes. Responding to the pandemic, people’s regular behavior
has substantially changed in 2020. Flu infections substantially
decreased,59 as did traffic,60,61 although its effect on mortality
has been unclear. The widespread impacts of the pandemic on
mental health have been researched, with some indication that
suicides may have increased or decreased relative to previous
years, depending on the country.62,63
With all this in mind, Table III contains several insights.
First, the offsets τ and τ 0 agree for all but one country, and
overwhelmingly suggest an offset of one to two weeks, mirroring the results of Table I. In addition, most modified mortality
ratios M10 /M20 are greater than 1, highlighting a decrease in
mortality between the first wave and subsequent period. Of the
five countries with M10 /M20 < 1, three have M1 < 0, suggesting
that nullifying negative excess mortality counts has added a

11

large number of deaths to the total. Thus, these ratios may
not be reliable. The differences between the mortality ratios
in Tables I and III suggests that the underestimation of true
cases in the first wave plays a substantial role in the large reduction of mortality with respect to reported cases and deaths,
as discussed in the body of the paper.
Overall, the analysis performed in Section II is not without
its limitations. The substantial decrease in mortality according
to reported cases and deaths has several explanations, including
potential better treatments or underestimation of true COVID19 cases, or even deaths - this appendix suggests the latter plays
a more substantial role. Further research is needed, including
incorporating hospitalization data, to reveal the true changes
in mortality from COVID-19 in different ways of the disease.
Future work could also study the difference between the second
and third waves more closely - we have only distinguished the
first wave versus subsequent period. This research may assist in
an effective, coordinated European response to the pandemic.
