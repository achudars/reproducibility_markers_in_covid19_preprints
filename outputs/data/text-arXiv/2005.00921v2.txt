We propose an epidemic model SIPHERD in which three categories of infection carriers Symptomatic, Purely Asymptomatic, and Exposed are considered with different rates of transmission of
infection that are taken dependent on the lockdown and social distancing. The rate of detection
of the infected carriers is taken dependent on the tests done per day. The model is applied for
the COVID outbreak in Germany and South Korea to validate its predictive capabilities and then
applied to India and the United States for the prediction of its spread with different lockdown
situations and testing in the coming months.

INTRODUCTION

The outbreak of pandemic Coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) has led to more than 4 million total infections and 285 thousand deaths worldwide [1], and serious
efforts are needed for its containment. The Coronavirus
SARS-CoV-2 has affected not just the public health but
made a drastic impact on the economy of the world as
well due to the lockdown situations in many countries.
Pandemics have hit humanity many times in the past
as well, and mathematical models are already available
for infectious diseases. Modeling and simulation can help
to predict the extent of the contagious disease and can
give useful inputs on correction measures for its containment. In order to devise the lockdown strategy, it is
important that the prediction of the disease spread is
available to the decision-makers. COVID-19 is different
from the previously known SARS (Severe acute respiratory syndrome) infection, such as the existence of purely
asymptomatic cases [2] and the spread of the infection
from them as well as from the exposed ones in the incubation period [3]. Our proposed mathematical model,
SIPHERD incorporates the above facts for the COVID19 epidemic.
Many epidemiological models exist in the literature,
and the basic SIR model [4] is the widely used one,
which needs to be modified to incorporate the complexities involved in Coronavirus spread and control. An approximate mathematical model of the COVID-19 is initially reported in the literature [5] based on the BetweenCountries Disease Spread (Be-CoDiS), which is a spatial
epidemiological model for the study of the spread of human diseases between and within the countries.

An improved mathematical model for the spread of
COVID-19 is proposed in [6], by taking into account the
infected and undetected cases. But this study and forecast is particularly based only on China.
An extended SIR model is proposed in [7], in which the
entire people in the country are divided into eight compartments. Though it is an improved version of the SIR
model, the study and simulation results are done only for
Italy, and the model does not take into account purely
Asymptomatic cases and the role of tests done per day.
Another compartmental epidemic model SEIR [8] forecast for few countries and the impact of the quarantine
on the COVID-19 is investigated. A better adaptive and
improved version of the SIR model is illustrated in [9].
In this method, the time dependency of some parameters
used for the analysis makes it more robust than the conventional SIR method. Some other curve fitting based
methods are also available in the literature for the forecast of COVID-19 in [10], [11] and [12]. Although these
methods can track the available data correctly, they are
not developed based on the physical insights that affect
the rate of spreading of the disease and also it is extremely sensitive to the initial conditions.
In this paper, we formulate the mathematical model
SIPHERD for the COVID-19 epidemic and apply it for
forecasting the number of active cases, confirmed cases,
daily new cases, and deaths for India and USA, depending on the lockdown strategy and the number of tests
performed per day.

MODEL

We model the evolution of the COVID-19 disease by
dividing the population into different categories as listed
below. As seen in FIG. 1, the rates of transfer from
one category to another can are the model parameters

2

FIG. 1. SIPHERD Model

and a set of differential equations for the entity in each
category can be formed. We write the model equations
that are independent of the population of the country by
considering the fraction of the people in each category.
• S - fraction of the total population that is healthy
and has never caught the infection
• E - fraction of the total population that is exposed
to infection, transmit the infection and turn into
either Symptomatic or purely Asymptomatic, and
not detected

where, tR and tD are the delay associated with the recovery and death respectively with respect to active cases
H. We have taken into account this delay because the
active cases are reported after the testing and admission
to healthcare or quarantine center and the number of recovery and death of the admitted will not immediately
follow the active or H category number. All fractions
add up to unity that can also be seen from summing the
above equations.

• I - fraction of the total population infected by the
virus that shows symptoms and undetected
• P - fraction of the total population infected by the
virus that doesn’t show symptoms even after the
incubation period and undetected. These are the
purely Asymptomatic cases
• H - fraction of the total population that are found
positive in the test and either hospitalized or quarantined
• R - fraction of the total population that has recovered from the infection
• D - fraction of the total population that are extinct
due to the infection.
The SIPHERD model equations are a set of coupled
ordinary differential equations (1 to 7) for the defined entities (S,I,P,H,E,R,D), where initial conditions E(0), P(0)
and I(0) are not exactly known. The various rates listed
in TABLE I are the parameters of the problem which
are also not known, and only possible range is available.
Some of the parameters such as rates of infection (α, β,
γ) change with time in steps, depending on the conditions
such as lockdown.

The probability of getting the infection is assumed uniform among the susceptible people, although the disease
spreads localised in hot-spots.
The asymptomatic proportion of the infected persons
onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship is estimated
in [2]. Among the 634 tested positive onboard, 328 were
found asymptomatic i.e., more than 50 percent of the
confirmed cases were not showing any specific symptoms
of COVID-19. This factor is incorporated in the model
by considering the purely Asymptomatic category. The
ratio of purely Asymptomatic (P) to total Asymptomatic
(E+P) cases is reported to be 0.35 and the ratio of purely
Asymptomatic to the total infected (E+P+I) is 0.179 [2].
These reported numbers are used to fix the proportion
between ξP and ξI as 0.36 and the proportion of initial

3
conditions E(0), I(0) and P (0) as well. In other words,
out of 100 exposed cases, after the incubation period, 36
will turn to be purely asymptomatic, and 74 will have
symptoms.
Coronavirus-nCoV2 has shown particular characteristics that the asymptomatic patients do transmit the disease. The infection can be transmitted from the person
who is not showing illness during the incubation period
[3]. This can be included in the model by considering E
category people and their transmission as well. Hospitalized and quarantined cases can also transmit the disease,
and this small rate is taken as parameter δ.
The detection of the Asymptomatic and Symptomatic
cases can be taken dependent on the number of tests done
per day (TP D ). For the Symptomatic cases, the detection
is more probable as the infected person can approach for
the tests and more likely to be tested. The detection of
Symptomatic is taken in two parts, one a constant and
another part proportional to the tests done per day. This
can be written in terms of parameters as,
ν = ν0 + ν1 TP D

(9)

µ = µ0 TP D

(10)

where, µ0 , ν0 , and ν1 are positive constants. Recovery
of Asymptomatic cases is taken faster than the Symptomatic cases. The total confirmed cases are the addition of the active cases, extinct cases, and a part of the
recovered that were detected. This can be written as
Z
Tc (t) = H(t) + D(t) +

NUMERICAL IMPLEMENTATION AND
SIMULATION

The set of coupled ordinary differential equations for
the model can be readily solved numerically for a given
set of parameters and initial values. The non-trivial part
is the accurate determination of the parameters that will
mimic the situation on the ground. The mathematical
problem is to take into account the four actual data sets
of the total number of confirmed cases, active cases on
a particular day, cumulative deaths and tests done per
day, and find the set of parameters that will provide the
best possible match between the data and model. The
extraction of the parameters is also to be automated so
that the model can be run on data for various countries.
A cost function is written in terms of errors between the
actual and solver data sets. The minimizer of the cost can
be found to obtain the optimized set of parameters that
best fit with the data available till date. The model and
the optimization scheme is implemented in MATLAB.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We collected the number of total positive or confirmed
cases, present active cases and deaths from [1], [13], and
the number of tests per day from [14], which is plotted
in FIG. 2. The day on which lockdown is imposed in a
country is also taken into account as changes in the slopes
of the data are observed according to it. The rate of
transmission of infection from the Asymptomatic carrier
(α, γ) for a country is taken higher than the Symptomatic
ones (β) as the Asymptomatic carrier may not be aware
of his/her infection, and Susceptible may not be keeping
distance as no symptoms are seen. The mortality rate
(τ ) is taken different for different countries as it depends
on the immunity and how effectively the critical patients
are taken care of by the hospitals.
The home recovery rates of Asymptomatic (η) and
Symptomatic (ω), rate of transmission of infection from
hospitalized and quarantined (δ), and rate of selfreporting of the Symptomatic people (ν0 ) are taken uniform for all countries. The transfer rate ξI is the inverse
of the incubation period, whose mean is reported 5.2 days
[15]. The parameters determined by our model are listed
in TABLE II for the countries we studied.

Model Validation

We apply the SIPHERD model to South Korea and
Germany for exhibiting the predictive capability of our
model as the disease has almost reached the end stages in
these countries. We used the data for the first 23 and 40
days, respectively, for these counties i.e., till March 9th
and March 30th and compared the future evolution generated by the model to the actual data as shown in the
grey region in FIG. 3 for South Korea and in FIG.4 for
Germany. Model predicted higher deaths for South Korea as the mortality rate 2.2E-3 was higher before March

Predictions for India

For the available data till date, we run the model to
extract parameters, and then with the extracted parameters, the model is run for 180 days starting from March
2nd . If the lockdown conditions are relaxed on May 17th ,
the rate of transmission of infection is going to increase.
In the relaxed lockdown, the α and β values are assumed
to jump by 20%. The prediction for both cases, with a
4k increase in tests per day and saturation at 200k tests,
is compared in FIG. 5 and in FIG. 6, we plot the prediction band for the daily new cases considering two percent
error in the estimation of rate of transmission of infection. We compare the effect of testing on the prediction

Predictions for USA

The recovery rate of the H category is found to be
slow compared to South Korea or Germany, which may
be attributed to either incorrect reporting of the Active
cases or the testing of serious cases only and longer recovery time in hospitals compared to quarantined with mild

is till the end of the year 2020, is plotted in FIG. 8 for
10k test per day and saturated at 1 million tests per day.
The recovery rate σ is taken improved by 25 % after May
4th and mortality rate is taken improved in steps from
initial 6E-3 to 4E-3 to 2.5E-3 after April 9th and April
19th . The time evolution of the totally unknown and undetected part of the infected for USA is plotted in FIG.

CONCLUSION

SIPHERD model is developed by considering purely
Asymptomatic category of COVID-19 infected cases in
addition to the Symptomatic, and the disease spread by
the exposed. The effect of lockdown on the rates of transmission of infection and the influence of tests per day on
detection rates has been incorporated in the model. The
SIPHERD model is put for trial for the data of South
Korea and Germany, and with a limited number of days
data, the model is found to correctly predict the known
evolution. The prediction for India suggests that even
increasing the rate of infection transmission by 20% due
to relaxation of lockdown leads to around 50k increase in
the total number of cases and 3k increase in total deaths.
The prediction for the USA shows that in the absence of
vaccine the infection can last long till the end of this year

6
and number of deaths could be around 250k if lockdown
and social distancing conditions remain the same.
