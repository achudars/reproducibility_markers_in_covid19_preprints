Abstract
In this paper, we propose a continuous-time stochastic intensity model, namely, two-phase
dynamic contagion process (2P-DCP), for modelling the epidemic contagion of COVID-19 and
investigating the lockdown effect based on the dynamic contagion model introduced by Dassios
and Zhao (2011). It allows randomness to the infectivity of individuals rather than a constant
reproduction number as assumed by standard models. Key epidemiological quantities, such
as the distribution of final epidemic size and expected epidemic duration, are derived and
estimated based on real data for various regions and countries. The associated time lag of the
effect of intervention in each country or region is estimated. Our results are consistent with
the incubation time of COVID-19 found by recent medical study. We demonstrate that our
model could potentially be a valuable tool in the modeling of COVID-19. More importantly,
the proposed model of 2P-DCP could also be used as an important tool in epidemiological
modelling as this type of contagion models with very simple structures is adequate to describe
the evolution of regional epidemic and worldwide pandemic.

Introduction

In the early stages of epidemic modelling, the spread of diseases was formulated as a deterministic process. The classical deterministic model of susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) was
introduced in the seminal paper of Kermack and McKendrick (1927). It models the spread and
ultimate containment of an infection in a setting where those who recover are immune to the disease and thus the susceptible population declines over time. Many epidemic models are variations
of the SIR model, see Brauer et al. (2008); Keeling and Rohani (2008); Diekmann et al. (2013)
and Martcheva (2015). For example, during the outbreak of COVID-19 since December 2019, a
commonly adopted approach for predicting the number of infections is the susceptible-exposedinfectious-recovered (SEIR) model, which adds an exposed period to the SIR model for accounting
the reported incubation period of COVID-19 during which individuals are not yet infectious, e.g.
Berger et al. (2020); Liu et al. (2020) and Tian et al. (2020). More recently, Acemoglu et al. (2020)
develop a multi-risk SIR model, which takes into account that different subpopulations have different risks and is applied to analysing optimal lockdown.
However, the random nature of the epidemics spread in our real world suggests that a stochastic
model is needed. A continuous-time stochastic counterpart of SIR model was first proposed by
McKendrick (1925), and then a variety of stochastic models were studied in the literature, e.g.
Bartlett (1949, 1956) and Bailey (1950, 1953, 1957). For more recent developments on stochastic
epidemic models in general, see Daley and Gani (1999); Andersson and Britton (2000); Allen
(2008) and Fuchs (2013). In particular, many researchers adopted branching processes. Ball (1983)
used the birth-and-death process for constructing a sequence of general stochastic epidemics, and
Ball and Donnelly (1995) used branching processes to approximate the early stages of epidemic
dynamics, see also Britton (2010) and Ball et al. (2016).
In this paper, we propose a continuous-time stochastic epidemic model, namely, the two-phase
dynamic contagion process (2P-DCP), for modelling the epidemic contagion. It is a branching process, and can be considered as a generalisation of dynamic contagion process (Dassios and Zhao,
2011), which is an extension of the classical Hawkes process (Hawkes, 1971a,b). In fact, Hawkes
process and its various generalisations were originally used for modelling earthquakes in seismology, and recently become extremely popular for modelling financial contagion in economics, see
Bowsher (2007); Large (2007); Embrechts et al. (2011); Bacry et al. (2013a,b); Aït-Sahalia et al.
(2015); Dassios and Zhao (2017a,b) and Qu et al. (2019). Analogously, we advocate that they are
also applicable to epidemiology. As not all individuals are equally infectious in reality, the main

2

advantage of this Hawkes-based approach is that, it allows randomness to the infectivity of individuals, rather than a constant reproduction number (the average number of subsequent infections
of an infected individual) in standard models. In this paper, we adopt the 2P-DCP as a more realistic and parsimonious example of Hawkes-based models for modelling the current progression of
COVID-19 and investigating the lockdown effect. Key epidemiological quantities, such as the distribution of final epidemic size and expected epidemic duration, have been derived and estimated
based on real data. Pandemics have largely shaped the history of human being as described in the
popular book by McNeill (1976), and have made huge impacts to our society and and economy.
However, mathematical models developed in epidemiology and economics don’t talk to each other
much until the current outbreak of COVID-19, which needs urgent calls (e.g. from The Royal Society) for researchers across disciplines to work together and jointly support the scientific modelling
for epidemics, see recent intensive interplays between the two fields, e.g. Acemoglu et al. (2020);
Alvarez et al. (2020); Atkeson (2020); Eichenbaum et al. (2020) and Guerrieri et al. (2020). Our
paper also responds to the calls by introducing the Hawkes-based approach as a potentially very
valuable tool for epidemic modelling.
This paper is organised as follows: Section 2 offers the preliminaries including an introduction
and formal mathematical definitions for our stochastic epidemic model, a two-phase dynamic contagion process. Key distributional properties, such as the distribution of final epidemic size and
expected epidemic duration, are provided in Section 3. In Section 4, our model is implemented
based on real data, and the associated time lag of the effect of intervention in each country or region is estimated. Finally, Section 5 draws a conclusion for this paper, and proposes some issues
for possible further extensions and future research.

Two-Phase Dynamic Contagion Process

In this section, we introduce a two-phase dynamic contagion process (2P-DCP) for modelling the
dynamics of COVID-19 contagion. The unobservable effective time that aggregated government
interventions (e.g. lockdown of a city or country) came into effect is denoted by ` > 0, which
divides the COVID-19 epidemic dynamics into two phases. Note that, the time point ` is different
from the exact timing of intervention that can be observed. The cumulated number of infected
individuals is described by a counting process Nt with N0 = 0, and it is modelled by a two-phase
dynamic contagion process defined as below.
Definition 2.1 (Two-Phase Dynamic Contagion Process (2P-DCP)). A two-phase dynamic contagion process (2P-DCP) is a point process Nt with two phases:

• {Yi }i=1,...,N` are i.i.d. self-exciting jump sizes of the first phase, realised at times

• {Yi }i=N` +1,... are i.i.d. self-exciting jump sizes of the second phase, realised at times
{Ti }i=N` +1,... , with distribution G2 (y). Note that compared with the average mean of
the self-exciting jump size for Phase 1, the mean of self-exciting jump in Phase 2 is
smaller, which demonstrates that the COVID-19 becomes less contagious on average
after time point `.
The point process Nt and its intensity process λt are illustrated in Figure 1. Overall, we can
more compactly define our new pandemic model, a two-phase dynamic contagion process, as a
counting process Nt ≡ {Ti }i=1,... with N0 = 0 and stochastic intensity

cluster-process presentation is provided as follows.
• The cumulated number of infected cases, Nt , is a cluster point process, which consists of
two types of points: outside-imported cases and inside-infected cases.

took effect, and there will be no any increase of imported cases in a long run.
• Each imported case may infect other individuals inside and thereby causes new cases, and
each of these new cases would further infect others inside, and so on. The infection of any
new cases caused by the previous infected cases follows a Cox process with exponentially
decaying intensity Y· e−δ(t−T· ) , where Y· follows a two-phase distribution G(y; t) and T· is the
infection time of the previous infected case. After the interventions took effect, the COVID19 becomes less easy to spread on average. This is captured by our assumption of two-phase
distribution (2.4) for Y· here.
• Overall, the superposition of all these infected cases form a point process Nt , a two-phase
dynamic contagion process with stochastic intensity (2.3).

Distributional Properties

In this section, we outline key distributional properties for the two-phase dynamic contagion process. We derived the conditional joint Laplace transform of λt and probability generating function
of Nt , which are the key results to further derive the elimination probability of the epidemic and
the distribution of the final epidemic size.

Joint Distribution of (λt , Nt )
Let {Ft }t≥0 be the natural filtration of the point process Nt , i.e. Ft = σ (Ns , s ≤ t) and assume
that the intensity process {λt }t≥0 being Ft -adapted. The joint Laplace transform and probability
generating function for (λt , Nt ) is provided in Theorem 3.1 as below.
Theorem 3.1. For time s ≤ t, the conditional joint Laplace transform and probability generating
function for λt and the point process Nt is of the form

Proof. For 0 ≤ s ≤ t ≤ `, λt is the intensity process of the dynamic contagion process introduced
in Dassios and Zhao (2011). The corresponding conditional joint Laplace transform, probability
generating function for the process λt and the point process Nt is provided in Theorem 3.1 of
Dassios and Zhao (2011). For ` < s ≤ t, given Fs , the infinitesimal generator of the dynamic
contagion process (λs , Ns , s) acting on a function f (λ, n, s) within its domain Ω(A) is given by

Consider a function f (λ, n, s) of form
f (λ, n, s) = θn e−A(s)λ ,
and substitute this into Af = 0, we then have the ODE
A0 (s) = δA(s) − 1 + θĝ A(s), s ,
Ä

adding the boundary condition A(t) = v, gives the ODE in (3.2).
The moments of λt and Nt can be obtained by differentiating the joint Laplace transform and
probability generating function of λt and Nt , and the results are provided in Proposition 3.1 and
3.2 as below.

Proof. These results immediately follows Lemma 3.1, Lemma 3.2 and Theorem 3.9 in Dassios and

Probability of Elimination Time T‹
After the government interventions come into effect, the contagion rate will dramatically decline
and new cases will drop abruptly almost to nothing in the near future. It is therefore of great
interests to calculate the probability of elimination time, i.e. the time that the last ever case arrives,
after government interventions come into effect. Let T‹ to be elimination time such that
¶

(3.10)

©

T‹ := inf t > ` : ∀s ≥ t,

Ns − Nt = 0 .

The condition probability of the elimination time is provided in Proposition 3.3.
Proposition 3.3. For ` ≤ s ≤ t, the elimination probability is given by
P T‹ ≤ t|Fs = e−A(s)λs ,
Ä

(3.11)

ä

where A(s) is determined by the ODE in (3.2) with boundary condition A(t) = 1δ .
Proof. Given T‹ being the timing of the last ever event, the event {T‹ ≤ t} implies that Nu = Nt
for any u ≥ t, which also lead to
λu = e−δ(u−t) λt .
Hence, we have

Distribution of Final Epidemic Size N∞
The final epidemic size is one of the most important epidemiological quantities to study. In fact,
under the two-phase dynamic contagion model, the final epidemic size is the value of the point
process Nt when time goes to infinity. Conditional on s > `, since there are no externally-exciting
jumps in the intensity, the distribution of N∞ can be characterised by Proposition 3.4 as below.
Proposition 3.4. For ` < s, the probability generating function of N∞ conditional on Fs is given
as

While the government interventions come into effect, if we assume i.i.d. self-exciting jump

Empirical Study

We provide a calibration scheme based on the daily increments of the two-phase dynamic contagion process Nt . Let us first denote the observations of the daily confirmed COVID-19 cases as
{Ct }t=0,1,2,...,T . The mean square error (MSE) between the expected daily increments of Nt and
the actual reported daily confirmed COVID-19 cases is given as

(4.1)

We consider the calibration based on minimising the MSE (4.1), i.e., we choose parameters (α̂, β̂, δ̂, %̂, `)
such that
ˆ :=
MSE(α̂, β̂, δ̂, %̂, `)

min

(α,β,δ,%,`)

MSE(α, β, δ, %, `),

with α, β, δ, % ≥ 0 and ` ∈ N+ .
Without loss of generality, for simplicity, we assume Zk = 1 for any k, Yi ∼ Exp(α) for
i = 1, ..., N` and Yi ∼ Exp(β) for i = N` + 1, ..., and λ0 = 0 in (2.3) for model calibration.
Other assumptions for Zk , {Yi }i=1,...N` ,N` +1,... , λ0 can also be used if necessary. We provide two
empirical examples. The first one concentrates on the COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China during the period from early January to late March 2020. The second one focuses on the worldwide
COVID-19 pandemic during the period from mid February to early May 2020. The data we used
11

are publicly available. Datasets are mostly cited from the associated official government health department websites for non-European countries and from the European Centre of Disease Control
(ECDC) for European countries.

COVID-19 Pandemic in Mainland China
The daily confirmed COVID-19 cases for regions in China can be obtained from daily reports
of the National Health Commission of the PRC. We use the reported daily confirmed cases for
several regions in China from 2020-01-19 to 2020-03-31 as examples for model calibration. The
corresponding estimation results are illustrated in Table 1. We can see that the estimator %̂ are
quite different from each other. In particular, these regions that are close to Hubei, namely Henan,
Hunan, Anhui, have relatively larger intensities for externally-exciting jumps, which means that
these regions experienced more external shocks from Wuhan and these external shocks can be originally infected individuals from Wuhan. Naturally, without taking into account Wuhan, the rest of
Hubei has the largest intensity %̂ for externally-exciting jumps. The main government intervention
established by the Chinese authority is the announcement of the completely lockdown of Wuhan
and later the whole Hubei Province on 23 January 2020. One or two days later, all other regions
enforced the quarantine and raised the alert of public health emergency. Setting the date 2020-0119 as the initial time t = 0, then the government intervention took place when t = 4 and came
ˆ Since the delay period of the government interventions is the difference of
into effect when t = `.
the date when the government interventions came into effect and the date when the government introduced the restriction measures, we can therefore observe from Table 1 that the estimated delays
of the government interventions for different regions therefore are between 5 and 15 days, which
are consistent to the incubation time of COVID-19 for most people, e.g. as found in a highly cited
medical study of Lauer et al. (2020).
The branching ratio (BR), which demonstrates the average infection rate, is determined by
E[Yi ]/δ. In Table 2, we compare the estimated branching ratios before and after the government
interventions came into effect, namely Rb and Ra , respectively. It is clear that the branching ratio
for every region decreases significantly when the state changed, i.e. government interventions
came into effect. One can also access the efficiency for when regions implemented the restriction

observe that the model allows different shapes of trend before the interventions came into effect.
All these regions indicate relatively smooth exponential decay of daily new cases after the peak.
In addition, the estimated cumulative confirmed cases are very close to the actual total confirmed
COVID-19 cases, which further confirms that our new model is a good candidate for describing
the propagation process.

COVID-19 Pandemic for the World
From mid-February 2020, the COVID-19 started to spread in other countries around the world.
At beginning, only a small number of initial cases were reported for some countries in Europe,
South/East Asia and North American. However, lately, several large outbreaks were reported in
South Korea, Italy, Iran, Spain, Japan and the total number of cases outside China quickly passed
the China’s. The WHO then recognized the spread of COVID-19 as pandemic on 2020-03-11.
We could use this as a second example to confirm our observations from the last exercise. The
calibration settings were the same as the previous one. We use the reported daily confirm cases
for different regions and countries around world from mid-February to early May 2020. Note that,
due to the fact that the pandemic reached each country or territory at different time and the corresponding government interventions also imposed and came into effect at different times, there
is no sense to calibrate the model using the data within the same truncated time series. Table 3
ˆ of (α, β, δ, %, `) for various countries and territories.
presents the estimation results (α̂, β̂, δ̂, %̂, `)
We notice that regions and countries like Italy, China, New York have much larger % compared with
other areas. This phenomena is reasonable as these areas have specific outbreak area which created
external shocks to other part of the regions and countries and hence the number of confirmed cases
increased more rapidly than other regions and countries.
In Table 3, we also presents the date of day 0, i.e. Date0 , and the date of government interventions imposed, i.e. DateG . The delay period of government interventions came into effect therefore
ˆ with Date0 and DateG . The details for the delay periods of
can be obtained given the estimated `,
regions and countries are illustrated in Figure 5. We can see that the delay of the interventions for

different regions and countries is around 8 ∼ 21 days. In fact, the delay period can be considered
as a criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of restrictions imposed by the authorities to prevent
further spread of COVID-19. In general, most regions and countries with short delay periods normally took tougher restrictions or more effective measures to stop the spread of virus. New Zealand
and South Korea are two typical examples. The authority of New Zealand introduced a nationwide
lockdown by closing all borders and entry ports to all nonresidents. On contrary, the South Korea
authority introduced one of the largest and best-organised epidemic control programs to screen the
mass population for the virus with isolation, tracing, quarantine took place simultaneously without
further lockdown. Therefore, the estimated delay periods for these two countries are only 9 days for
New Zealand and 8 days for South Korea, which are much shorter than the average incubation time
of COVID-19. For most European countries, due to the containment restriction measures such as
quarantines and curfews were not strictly put into effect, the associated delay periods are relatively
longer than the incubation time of COVID-19.
The estimated branching ratios before and after the government interventions came into effect
for different countries and territories are reported in Table 4. And Figure 6 demonstrates a comparison between the BRs before the government interventions took effect and the BRs after the
interventions worked, with a blue dash line that represents Rb = Ra . We can immediately see that
for most regions and countries, the BR dropped dramatically after government interventions came
into effect, which suggests that the restriction measures imposed by the authority indeed reduce the
contagion/infection rate significantly.

A comparison between the expected daily confirmed cases for the two-phase dynamic contaˆ is reported in Table 3, and the actual daily
gion model under the calibrated parameters (α̂, β̂, δ̂, %̂, `)
confirmed COVID-19 cases for different regions and countries over the period of mid-February to
early May are presented in Figure 7. In general, we can see that the model can precisely catch the
trend of infection, this further confirms that the two-phase dynamic contagion model is effective.
Note that, we have smoothed the biggest jump of daily confirmed cases in China for better illustration and fitting purpose. This is due to a change in the confirmation standard established by the
Chinese authority on 2020-02-12.
In Figure 8, we compare the estimated daily increment with the actual confirmed COVID-19
cases for France, Germany, Switzerland, and New York. The daily records of confirmed cases for
these areas were not as smooth as those countries illustrated in Figure 7. The spikes within the
graphs could be caused by many reasons such as the delay of reports, testing capacity, hospital
capacity, diagnostic methods and etc. For instance, the daily confirmed cases for France, Germany,
Switzerland and New York suddenly declined on a regular basis, which mostly happened during
the weekends. Even so, we can see the model can still capture the trend of infectious evolution. In
Figure 9, we also compare the actual total confirmed COVID-19 cases against the cumulative estimated cases with a confidence interval within two standard deviations1 for some typical countries
and territories. The black dash line in each graph of Figure 9 represents the end of data collection
period for calibration. The red curve on the left of the black dash line shows the historical data
used for calibration and the blue curve is the corresponding estimated result. The red and blue

The standard deviations can be derived based on results in Proposition 3.1 and 3.2.

curves on the right of the black dash line demonstrate a comparison between the predicted and

period to the end of May, 2020. We can see that the estimated curves of the number of confirmed
infections under the two-phase dynamic contagion model well fitted the actual propagation process
of the COVID-19. In addition, the forecasted infection cases in the coming weeks after the end of
data collection period also well suited the up to date actual total confirmed COVID-19 cases.

Elimination Probability and Final Epidemic Size

According to Proposition 3.3, one could obtain the elimination probability of the epidemic by nuˆ provided in
merically solving the ODE (3.2). Based on the calibration parameters (α̂, β̂, δ̂, %̂, `)
Table 3 for regions and countries, we could obtain the associated elimination probabilities. Figure
10 illustrates how P T‹ ≤ t|F`ˆ varies for different countries and territories. We can see that for
Ä

ä

regions and countries with effective restriction measures, the probability for a shorter period to
observe the last ever event arrives after government interventions come into effect will be much
higher. On contrary, for some regions and countries, longer periods are needed for elimination
probabilities to be closed to 1. For instance, we can see that there is still a long way to go to end
the COVID-19 pandemic for Italy.

rated parameters (α̂, β̂, δ̂, %̂, `)
Germany, France, Italy, and New York. The red curve represents total confirmed COVID-19 cases.
The blue curve represents the total estimated cases and the left zone of the black dash line illustrates
historical data used for calibration, and the right zone demonstrates the predicted estimated cases.
The shadowed region plots the values within two standard deviations.

The elimination time of the pandemic depends on many decisive factors, such as the initial intensity of the externally-exciting jumps, the time needed for the government interventions to come
into effect, the size of the branching ratio after the government interventions came into effect,
ˆ %̂, Ra against E[T‹|F ˆ],
etc. Figure 11, 12, and 13 illustrate comparisons between the estimated `,
`
respectively. From Figure 11, we can see that for most countries and territories, the quicker the government interventions come into effect, the faster the pandemic will end. However, some places like
Hong Kong and Iceland still have relatively fast elimination time even though it takes longer for the

government interventions to come into effect. This is probably because the restriction measures for
these places were imposed so early that reporting procedures were not properly in place yet. Figure
12, and 13 clearly demonstrate that the externally-exciting jump intensity % and the branching ratio
after the government came into effect Ra are important factors that determine the extinction time
of the pandemic. In general, to reduce the extinction time of the pandemic, the first priority for
the authorities should be introducing restriction measures such as national/subnational lockdown
to reduce the intensity of the external imported cases, and while the external imported cases are
controlled and thereafter negligible, the governments should simultaneously introduce enforced restrictions to prevent further transmission. If the government intervention strategies were effectively
implemented without a lack of civic spirit, the infection rate of the virus after the these intervention
measures come into place will be reduced significantly, and therefore lead to a quicker elimination
of the COVID-19 pandemic. Note that the prediction for expected elimination time for regions and
countries is based on the assumption that the government intervention measures are still taking
into place in some form and propagation of the disease continues as in Phase 2. Relaxation of the
government intervention measures will inevitably delay the disease elimination for most regions
and countries.
Beside the conditional probability for the elimination time T‹, the epidemic size Nt given
{T̃ ≤ t} can also be predicted according to the join expectation of Nt and {T‹ ≤ t} derived
in Corollary 3.1. In Table 5, we report the 95% confidence interval for elimination time T‹ the
condition expectation of the elimination time T‹, E[T‹|F`ˆ], the expected elimination date DateE ,
and the conditional expectation of the epidemic size Nt , E[Nt |F`ˆ ∩ {T‹ ≤ t}] with t = E[T‹|F`ˆ],

for regions and countries with calibration parameters in Table 3. Note that, the regions and countries with more confirmed COVID-19 cases before government interventions came into effect will
experience longer time to reach elimination state, like France, Germany, Italy, and New York. And
the corresponding expected epidemic size for these areas are also much larger. Note that since we
have smoothed the biggest jump of daily confirmed cases, adding up with the cases which have been
smoothed, the actual conditional expectation of the epidemic size is about 83113, which is very
close to the current total confirmed cases 82, 993 on 2020-05-27. In general, not only the expected
epidemic size is very close to the actual total confirmed cases for the listed regions and countries,
but also the estimated elimination date is very close to the actual eradicate date. New Zealand is
one typical example that can be used to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in predicting
the key epidemiological quantities. New Zealand authority has officially declared that the country
has completely eradicated COVID-19 for now with total of 1154 confirmed COVID-19 cases on
2020-06-08. This elimination date and the final epidemic size are very close to what we predicted
for New Zealand under the two-phase dynamic contagion model, the predicted elimination date is
around 2020-06-04 and the predicted epidemic size is about 1250. More remarkably, the historical
data we used for model calibration for New Zealand is from 2020-03-12 to 2020-04-13, which is
already one and half months ago. This clearly shows that the two-phase dynamic contagion model

24

is pretty powerful in forecasting cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases, predicting possible elimination duration for the pandemic, and evaluating effectiveness of relevant government intervention
measures.

The conditional distribution of the final epidemic size N∞ can be obtained by numerically
inverse the probability generating function provided in Proposition 3.4. Since we assume the selfexciting jumps follows an exponential distribution after government interventions came into effect,
the final epidemic size N∞ conditional on F` follows a mixed-Poisson distribution with probability
mass function specified in (3.16). Figure 14 demonstrates the conditional probability mass function
of the difference between the finial epidemic size N∞ and the total number of confirm cases N`
when government interventions came into effect, i.e., P (N∞ − N` = k | F` ), for some regions and

Concluding Remarks

In this paper, we have introduced a two-phase dynamic contagion process for modelling the current
spread of COVID-19. This model allows randomness to the infectivity of individuals rather than a
constant reproduction number as commonly assumed by standard models. Key episdemiological
quantities, such as the distribution of final epidemic size and expected epidemic duration, are derived and estimated based on real data for various regions and countries. In addition, the associated

time lag of the effect of intervention in each country or region has been estimated, and our empirical results are consistent to the incubation time of COVID-19 for most people found by existing
medical study such as Lauer et al. (2020). The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that our model,
as a representative of Hawkes-based processes, could be a valuable tool for epidemic modelling. In
fact, the vast literature of Hawkes-based processes would also be relevant and potentially be applicable. For example, multivariate extensions of Hawkes-based processes, such as Embrechts et al.
(2011) for analysing financial high-frequency data, could be adopted for modelling the cross-region
epidemic contagion. Lévy-driven extensions, such as Qu et al. (2019) for portfolio credit risk, may
perform better in capturing the heavy tail property of epidemic distribution. In addition, easing of
the government interventions will lead to change of parameters and delay extinction times. The
model can be adjusted by introducing an additional phase with change of parameters. When countries cycle between periods of restrictions and relaxations to manage COVID-19, we can adjust
the two-phase dynamic contagion model by replacing the constant parameters to piecewise time
dependent parameters. These are all proposed as future research.
