Abstract
Social media plays a pivotal role in disseminating news across the globe and acts as a platform
for people to express their opinions on a variety of topics. COVID-19 vaccination drives across
the globe are accompanied by a wide variety of expressed opinions, often colored by emotions.
We extracted a corpus of twitter posts related to COVID-19 vaccination and created two classes
of lexical categories - Emotions and Influencing factors. Using unsupervised word embeddings,
we tracked the longitudinal change in the latent space of the lexical categories in five countries
with strong vaccine roll-out programs, i.e. India, USA, Brazil, UK and Australia. Nearly 600
thousand vaccine related tweets from the United States and India were analysed for an overall
understanding of the situation around the world for the time period of 8 months from June 2020
to January 2021. Cosine distance between lexical categories was used to create similarity
networks and modules using community detection algorithms. We demonstrate that negative
emotions like hesitancy towards vaccines have a high correlation with health related effects and
misinformation. These associations formed a major module with the highest importance in the
network formed for January 2021, when millions of vaccines were administered. The
relationship between emotions and influencing factors was found to be variable across the
countries. By extracting and visualizing these, we propose that such a framework may be helpful
in guiding the design of effective vaccine campaigns and can be used by policymakers for
modeling vaccine uptake.

Introduction
The unprecedented spread of COVID-19 has created huge turmoil in public health around the
world. The development of vaccines has evidently played a pivotal role in eradicating major
outbreaks of infectious diseases like smallpox, tuberculosis, measles and more [1]. Vaccines
played a key role in the successful eradication of many such life-threatening diseases. Major
pharmaceutical companies located across the globe are in the phase of developing vaccines, with
only a handful of them being authorized for clinical trials [2,3]. As the distribution of vaccines
and associated campaigns expand, people continue to express their opinions and personal
incidents on social media platforms.

Social media plays a decisive role in propagating information which leads to the emergence of
varying perceptions related to the pandemic [4]. During the initial phase of national lockdown in
several countries, Twitter has reported an increase of 24% of daily active usage due to the
increased usage of social media during lockdown, the highest year over year growth rate reported
by the company to date [5]. The COVID-19 pandemic has been studied in multidisciplinary
aspects and analysis of tweets remains a widely explored area in public health research [6,7,8]
primarily because of its rapidly evolving nature of content. Over the last decade, researchers
have used multiple methods such as sentiment classification [9], social network analysis [10],
and topic identification [11] to study the presence of pro-vaccine and anti-vaccine communities
on social media. It is observed that vaccine uptake is affected by multiple factors including rising
adverse events, socioeconomic inequities, and quantitative allocation [12]. In addition, the spread
of misinformation online has been a concerning issue and prior survey-based studies suggest that
it is linked with vaccine hesitancy and effects on public health [13,14]. On the other hand, certain
marginalized groups continue to face inaccessibility to vaccines [15].
In this paper, we present a temporal and demographic analysis of lexical categories mined from
twitter conversations around vaccines. We further subdivided these categories into two subtypesemotions and their influencing factors. We examined the relationships between emotions such as
hesitancy, anxiety, contentment, sorrow and faith with influencing factors such as conspiracy
theories around vaccines, social inequities and health effects. using unsupervised word
embeddings trained on the curated corpus of tweets over a span of seven months. Further, we
create correlation-based networks of these factors and perform clustering using the Infomap
algorithm. The alluvial diagrams generated by these networks demonstrate the flow of
importance of each factor from one month to another. We performed the analysis for five
countries, India, USA, Brazil, UK and Australia located on five different continents and
demonstrated the comparative results among them.

Methods
Data-sets. The dataset was curated by scraping more than 1 million tweets using the Snscrape
library, starting from June 2020 to February 2021 [16]. The general query used for extracting the
tweets represented an ‘OR’ combination of hashtags and words related to vaccines. Along with
this, we added the name of the vaccines that were approved in respective countries. Detailed
queries for each country are mentioned in Supplementary Table 1.
Text Pre-processing. Pre-processing text by removing white-spaces, punctuation, hashtags,
mentions, digits, stopwords, URLs, and HTML characters was carried out on lowercase
converted text. The verbs present in the text were lemmatized using WordNetLemmatizer from
the NLTK package [17].

Curating Categories using Unsupervised Word Embeddings. We created ten lexical
categories for a psychometric evaluation of the tweet content, in an approach similar to Empath
[18]. The categories formed can be broken down into two classes: ‘Emotions’ and ‘Influencing
Factors’. Emotions consist of the affective processes that help us in understanding how reactions,
feelings, thoughts and behavior of people evolve in a given situation. We selected six COVID-19
related emotions namely, Hesitation, Anxiety, Sorrow, Faith, Contentment, and Urgency along
with their putative influencing factors such as Misinformation, Vaccine rollout, Inequities and
Health Effects. with respect to the COVID-19 vaccines. We specified a set of seed words
corresponding to these categories as shown in Table 1.
We trained a low dimensional representation (d = 100) as word embeddings for the unigrams and
frequently occurring bigrams (co-occurring at least five times with the bigram scoring [19]
function greater than a threshold of 50) present in our corpus using the skip-gram algorithm of
the Word2Vec model [20] with a sliding window size of five. We defined lexical categories as
sets of words most similar to the assigned seed words. Each seed word, ensured to be present in
the vocabulary of the model, was mapped to a word vector. We used cosine similarity as a
measure of proximity to find the top N(=50) words in the nearby vector space. Following this
approach, 𝑘 seed words were expanded to a list of maximum 𝑘 × 𝑁 words. A category was
defined as the union set of seed words along with their closest similar words (Table 1).

Temporal Analysis of Lexical Categories. For measuring the strength of each category in a
given text, we used the word count approach, similar to Empath and other lexicon-based tools
like LIWC [21]. In order to obtain an unbiased value that is independent of length of text, we
divided the frequency by total number of words using the following formula,
𝑆𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ 𝑜𝑓 𝐶𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑔𝑜𝑟𝑦 (𝑆) =

𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑜𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑠 𝑜𝑓 𝑐𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑔𝑜𝑟𝑦 𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑑𝑠 𝑖𝑛 𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡
𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑑𝑠 𝑖𝑛 𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡

We appended the pre-processed text of all tweets on a monthly basis to calculate the strength.
The time series of Emotion categories and Influencing Factors was useful in analyzing the
evolution of perceptions and opinions expressed by the public and how they vary with crucial
factors like misinformation and mentions of health effects.

Longitudinal Correlation based Networks. The correlation between two categories represents
the degree to which the two of them are linearly related. Daily strengths were calculated for each
category followed by pairwise Pearson correlation [22]. Weighted networks of categories (nodes)
and edge-strengths (correlations coefficients) were constructed for evaluating the positive
associations among categories (ρ ≥ 0). Community detection on these networks was carried out
using the Infomap algorithm [23] and the dynamical change in these associations was visualized
as an alluvial diagram [24].

Results

Figure 1: (a) Words belonging to the lexical category of Misinformation. (b) Words belonging to
the lexical category of Hesitation. These words represent the vocabulary expanded from the seed
words of the respective categories.
We present a detailed analysis of the correlation between Emotions and Influencing Factors that
affect vaccine uptake using associated tweets from June 2020 to January 2021 by implementing a
vocabulary based approach that uses unsupervised word embeddings. Figure 1 shows the words
belonging to the lexical category of Misinformation (left) and Hesitation (right). These words
represent the expanded vocabulary created from the seed words of the respective categories
using semantic similarity computed between word vectors. Some of the words most similar to
‘conspiracy’ were found to be ‘qanon’, ‘implant microchips’, ‘flat earth’ and ‘conspiracy
theorists’. These terms evidently denote how people perceive to link vaccines to unconventional
concepts. The lexical category of Hesitation represents words such as ‘skeptical’, ‘pushback’,
‘red flag’, ‘entitle opinion’ and ‘consequence’ which demonstrate the uncertainty and doubt
regarding vaccines and their effects.

Figure 2: Strength of the ‘hesitation’ category in the tweets belonging to five countries over a
time period of eight months, June 2020 to January 2021.

Analysis of country wise hesitancy scores (Figure 2) based on the normalised word count
approach for each month provided insights about the general trend of hesitation expressed
towards COVID-19 vaccines and how it progressed over time. We observed that hesitancy in
Brazil is highly fluctuating, with its peak in September 2020 and the lowest value in July 2020.
The emotion remains prevalent in the USA throughout the months. In India the general trend is
observed to be increasing towards January 2021. After the vaccine rollout initiated in December,
India has shown increasing signs of hesitancy amongst the people. This comparative analysis
depicts the relative differences that exist in the hesitancy emotion among these countries which
arise due to differing situations pertaining to socioeconomic barriers, misinformation and other
influencing factors.

Figure 3: Alluvial diagram for correlation based networks showing the evolution of categories
from July 2020, to November 2020, to January 2021 in India.

Inferences from the alluvial diagrams (Figure 3) based on Infomap clustering on correlation
networks demonstrated that hesitation, misinformation, anxiety and vaccine_rollout formed a
major module and gained the highest PageRank in January 2021, the time when vaccines were
rolled out in India. This articulates the stern sentiment of hesitation and anxiety towards
COVID-19 vaccination with high correlation with spread of misinformation on Twitter as the
vaccines were administered. Faith and contentment formed the second most important module
illustrating their positive relationship with each other. Health effects and urgency, seen as
relatively less associated factors in July 2020, gained more centrality as the necessity of vaccines
increased with rising health effects in January 2021.

Figure 4: Alluvial diagram for correlation based networks showing the evolution of categories
from July 2020, to November 2020, to January 2021 in the USA.

On the contrary, public sentiment in the USA evolved to a major module containing faith and
contentment towards the vaccine with a positive correlation with anxiety and urgent demand
(Figure 4). Hesitation and sorrow were found to be the emotions influenced by socioeconomic
inequities, whereas health effects and misinformation were seen as less central factors in the
USA. The alluvial visualization for UK, Brazil and Australia are shown in Supplementary
Figures 1,2,3 respectively.

Figure 5: Comparing the temporal flow of strength of two categories (vaccine rollout,
misinformation and hesitation) for five countries USA, India, UK, Brazil, and Australia .
Analysis of the temporal trend of vaccine rollout with hesitation and misinformation in five
countries has been depicted in Figure 5. Updates regarding vaccinations started increasing near
the end of 2020 which led to changing trends of hesitation expressed on Twitter. A notable

inference from the line plots depicts that misinformation had a similar trend with hesitation. In
addition to this, mentions of health conditions in the USA have been significantly greater in early
months in the context of vaccines. However, our findings demonstrate that the discussions of
adverse effects and diseases in India took a steep rise in November 2020, the time when vaccine
rollout updates were released. The misinformation category has been observed to increase with
vaccine roll out for every country. This is a conclusive evidence which validates the spread of
misinformation over social media.

Discussion & Conclusion
Our analysis demonstrates how emotions of people altered on Twitter during the course of eight
months when events of vaccine production, trials, approval, distribution and administration were
discussed. Understanding how influencing factors represented by word embedding based lexical
categories namely, Misinformation, Vaccine Rollout, Inequities and Health Effects varied with
the emotions significantly assisted in studying the public perceptions towards emerging vaccine
updates.
Wide spread of misinformation getting articulated through social media creates panic among the
users [25]. Misinformation category contains terms similar to ‘scam’ and ‘conspiracy’ from our
dataset that helped in capturing references of such words in context of COVID-19 vaccines. High
reporting of adverse effects and severe symptoms in rare cases leading to death [26] becomes a
significant factor in increasing hesitation towards getting vaccinated. The seed words given in
the Health Effects category led to the formation of its vocabulary containing ‘arm_soreness’,
‘hot_flash’, ‘flulike_symptoms’, ‘complications’ and more words. The semantic similarity based
approach customized according to our dataset ensured proper creation of categories and tracking
their strength using normalized word count.
Inequalities based on socioeconomic status, religion, race, or demographics are common in
different countries which can lead to inconsistencies while distributing vaccines. Inequities
category encapsulated terms related to socio-economic disparities and helped us identify the
impact it had on other emotions. On the basis of inspection of our dataset of tweets, we found
words like “bigotry”, “underprivileged”, “financial_hardship” and “institutional_racism” were
occurring in a highly similar context towards vaccine distribution. Inequities category formed a
cluster with negative emotions like hesitation and sorrow which had an impact on vaccine
rollout.

Figure 6: Correlation heatmap for the month of January 2021 based on the tweets from India
(left) and USA (right).
Correlation matrices for the month of January 2021 for two countries, USA and India have been
compared in Figure 6. In India, misinformation has been found to be highly correlated with
sorrow, hesitation and health effects. This denotes that rise in the spread of rumors, leads to
increasing levels of reluctance, skepticism and despair in the community. Inequities as an
influencing factor was also observed to be associated with vaccine rollout due to the disruption it
creates in effective vaccine distribution which is instrumental in mitigating further virus spread.
In the USA, the emotions of faith and contentment, which were used to analyse the optimism and
positive sentiment towards the COVID-19 vaccines gained high correlation in January 2021. As
the change in discussion of inequities was greatly anti-correlated with faith and contentment.
Inaccessibility to vaccines in marginalised groups has evidently led to lower expression of
gratification and higher anxiety among affected groups.
We aimed at analysing the various influencing factors and their impact on social media users’
emotions related to the vaccine rollout and administration process. We analysed tweets from five
countries around different continents of the world to get a better understanding of the various
outlooks and perceptions held towards the vaccines which could affect the global immunization
process. The future work can be attributed in direction of local region level analysis for different
countries to understand the granular sentiments within different sections of people and the
contributing factors behind it. Since a very less population of rural people are actively involved
in social media platforms like Twitter or news outlets, surveys can be conducted based on which
such emotions can be captured to see the trend of hesitancy in the rural areas and the reasoning
associated with it.
