The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, a new and novel risk factor, leads to the stock price
crash due to the investors’ rapid and synchronous sell-off. However, within a short period, the quality
sectors start recovering from the bottom. A stock price model has been developed to capture the
price dynamics during shock and recovery phases of such crisis. The main variable and parameter
of the model are the net-fund-flow (Ψt ) due to institutional investors, and financial antifragility (φ)
of a company, respectively. We assume that during the crash, the stock price fall is independent of
the φ. We study the effects of shock length (TS ) and φ on the stock price during the crisis period
using the Ψt obtained from both the synthetic fund flow data and real fund flow data. We observed
that the possibility of recovery of stock with φ > 0, termed as quality stock, decreases with an
increase in TS beyond a specific period. A quality stock with higher φ shows V-shape recovery and
outperform others. The TS and recovery period of quality stock are almost equal in the Indian
market. Financially stressed stocks, i.e., the stocks with φ < 0, show L-shape recovery during
the pandemic. The stock data and model analysis show that the investors, in the uncertainty like
COVID-19, invest in the quality stocks to restructure their portfolio to reduce the risk. The study
may help the investors to make the right investment decision during a crisis.

INTRODUCTION

The impact of a pandemic on the environment, economy, employment, stock market and many other sectors
is severe [1–4]. A number of pandemics, which happened in 1918 − 1919, 1957 − 1958 and 1968, affected
the economy and stock markets worldwide badly [5–7].
The pandemic’s effect, the coronavirus disease (COVID19), maybe more severe on the economy and stock market, including many other sectors, due to its contagion
nature [7–9]. The COVID-19 leads to a worldwide stock
market crash in February and March 2020, created havoc
among the investors [10–12]. When economic activities
throughout the world were plummeting, surprisingly, in
the stock market, the world witnessed the opposite phenomena; the speedy recovery of some stocks and sectors
from the crash [10]. These phenomena were also observed
during market crashes in 1953 − 54, 2009 [13]. The study
of market crash dynamics and early recovery of the stocks
during the crisis is fascinating.
The stocks with strong fundamentals and positive outlook, which are termed as quality stocks, always show
strength, universality and persistence in returns [14–16].
The sustainability and resilience of a quality stock depend on its long-term growth prospect and financial ability to fulfill shareholder’s demand [17, 18]. During crises,
the unprecedented economic uncertainty forced the investors towards the quality stocks that may be better
able to withstand a downturn, and hence the significant

portion of the market capital gets reallocated to these
sectors, which in turn pushes the price up [19]. Thus
the sectors like pharma, healthcare, food, software and
technology showed the quality of withstanding the downturn and recovered quickly from the sharp fall. Whereas
sectors like petroleum, real estate, entertainment, hospitality yet to recover because of grim business outlook [10].
The quality of a company can be quantified by the fundamental determinants such as profit over the assets, return on assets, operating cash-flows to total assets, gross
margin, sale growth and some other fundamental determinants that assess the reliabilities of profits, low debt
and other measures of sustainable earnings [14–16]. Investors look for such quality stocks even at a high premium in anticipation of higher returns [14]. The survival
and growth of these quality stocks during pandemic depend on the financial antifragility of the company. Financial antifragility is the property that shows the ability of
a company to survive from a financial crisis and performs
strongly after that, and it mainly depends on the financial liquidity position to mitigate the liabilities [20, 21].
The stocks with positive antifragility recover very quickly
from uncertain shock and survive and sustain for an extended period [20–22].
The fund-flow in the market is primarily determined
by the foreign institutional investors (FII) and domestic
institutional investors (DII). The purchase/sell activity
by the FII and DII also influence the retail investors [23].
Hence, the net fund-flow by the FII and DII drives the
stock price [24–28]. Infusion of a large amount of fund to
a particular sector leads to an increase in the stock price
or vice versa, i.e., the price movement is strongly correlated with the net fund flow due to FII and DII [27–30].

2
Generally, during a crisis, the FII and DII look for stocks
with robust financial antifragility, and hence these stocks
bounce back strongly [19]. Hence modeling and analyzing stock prices in terms of net fund flow and antifragility
during shock and recovery phases of a pandemic are essential to understanding the market dynamics.
Several models describe the stock price movement using various parameters such as return and dividend [31–
33]. The efficient market hypothesis (EMH) states that
the future price does not depend on the past behavior
of data [34]. Contrary to the EMH hypothesis, some
other models show that the stock price is partially predictable [35]. However, the stock price prediction remains
a challenging task due to the stock market’s complex nature [36]. Recently, a model of V and L shape recovery of
the economy is proposed in Ref [37, 38] depending on the
fragility of the individual firms, where the fragility was
taken as a ration between negative cash balance to the
wages. So far, no one has modeled and analyzed stock
prices in terms of antifragility and fund flow.
The main aim of this paper is to develop a model, and
to simulate stock price movement during the COVID19 shock and subsequent recovery as a function of normalized net fund flow (Ψt ) due to institutional investors
and the antifragility parameter of a stock. Model simulation has been carried out for two different sets of Ψt :
(a) Ψt obtained from the real fund flow in the market,
and (b) artificially generated Ψt using the distribution of
net cash flow. Simulation with real fund flow reproduces
the price movement of the quality stocks and financially
stressed stocks during the COVID-19 shock that mimics
the actual stock price. The model simulation with artificial data shows the effect of various shock-lengths and
antifragility parameters. Further, we have analyzed the
stock price using EMD based Hilbert Huang transformation in terms of the time scales of the shock and recovery
to identify the quality stocks [39, 40].
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Sec. II
describes the formulation of the model. Sec. III discusses
the analysis of the simulated results and original stock
price. Finally, we have concluded the results in Sec. IV.

II.

MODEL FORMULATION

A model has been developed for the stock price dynamics of a stock/sector index during the shock and recovery
period. The time steps of the model are discrete with a
step of one day. The model’s basic assumptions are that
the stock price depends on (a) the net fund flow due to
FII and DII, and (b) financial antifragility of the company. The basis of the first assumptions is motivated by
the finding of the daily stock return is positively correlated with the net fund flow [27, 29, 30]. The retail investors also flock towards the sector in which FII and DII
invest more. Sometimes the price goes up or down with
lag to net fund flow because of information delay [27, 41].
Hence, the overall market moves with net fund flow due

to institutional investors.
During shock, the market falls due to negative sentiment among the investors, leading to a huge outflow of
capital from the market. As the pessimism dies down, the
investors again come to the market, and invest in those
companies which have strong fundamentals and positive
growth prospects. Hence, the fund inflow happens to
the company with positive antifragility [42, 43]. The
model with the variables normalized-net-fund-flow and
antifragility can capture price dynamics very well during
shock and recovery phase.
Let us first define the main ingredients of the model.
The variable used in the model is the net fund flow, which
can be calculated as follows. The cash purchase (inflow) or sell (outflow) by the F II is denoted as DF+II
or DF−II , respectively. Hence, the net cash purchase by
the F II is DF II = DF+II − DF−II . Similarly, the cash purchase (inflow) or sell (outflow) by the DII is denoted as
+
−
DDII
or DDII
, respectively. Hence, the net cash pur+
−
chase by the DII is DDII = DDII
− DDII
. So (the net
fund flow due to DII) the net cash purchase is defined
+
−
as DDII = DDII
− DDII
. Finally, we obtained ∆Dt due
to the purchase or sale by the institutional investors is
∆Dt = DF II + DDII . Finally, we obtained normalizednet-fund-flow,
Ψt =

∆Dt
max(abs(∆Dt ))

(1)

Ψt is the variable that is used to update the stock price.
The second ingredient of the model is the antifragility
parameter (φ), which is estimated as follows: The recovery of a company after a shock mainly depends on
current asset consumed to fulfill the current liabilities of
the company. The asset that is used, sold, consumed or
exhausted during a normal operating cycle is called the
current assets of a company. The current assets can easily
cover day-to-day financial operations and ongoing operating expenses; hence, it becomes a key component for a
company’s survival or death. The current assets of the
ith company, χi , is defined as χi = η1i + η2i + η3i + η4i ,
where η1i , η2i , η3i and η4i are the current inventories,
trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents and other
current assets, respectively. Current liabilities are the
obligations of a company that consists of short term debt
and other similar debts that will be due within a normal
operating cycle. Therefore, we define current liabilities
of the ith company as ζi = γ1i + γ2i + γ3i , where γ1i ,
γ2i and γ3i are the current debt, trade payable and other
current liabilities respectively. Hence, the liquidity balance of the company is defined as χi −ζi . We characterize
the financial antifragility (φ) of the ith company through
liquidity-to-expense ratio
φi =

χi − ζi
ξi

(2)

Where ξi is the operating expenses of a company, and
is expressed as ξi = ϑ1i + ϑ2i + ϑ3i + ϑ4i , where ϑ1i ,

3
ϑ2i , ϑ3i , and ϑ4i are the employment cost, financial cost,
maintenance and operating cost and other financial cost
respectively. The φ for a sector can be written as
PN
φi
(3)
φ= 1
N
Where N is number of company in any sector’s index.
φ acts as the control parameter of the price movement.
The value of φ > 0 for a quality stock, and φ < 0 for a
financially stressed stock. Usually, φ get updated twice
a year based on the financial statement of a company. It
is important to mention that during shock, market nose
dives due to massive sell-off by the investors, and hence
the price movement is independent of φ.
Our model updates the stock price as a function of Ψt
using the parameter φ as follows
Pt+1 = Pt {1 + λΨt )},
Pt+1 = Pt {1 + λΨt φ},

During shock
Otherwise

(4)
(5)

Where, λ is the coefficient of Ψt that represents the
proportion of the net fund by the institutional investors
that flows in a particular company/sector. The value
of λ changes during normal, shock and recovery period.
The value of λ has been taken on adhoc basis depending
on the normalized fund flow due to the mutual fund and
FPI. Typically the value of λ is in the range of 0 ≤ λ ≤ 1.
There are large numbers of companies and indices in
the stock market. To understand the price movement of
these companies and indices during the COVID-19 shock,
one needs to study the model with different shock and
recovery lengths and antifragility parameters. Hence, in
Subsec. II A, the model equations [Eqn 4 and 5] is simulated using artificially generated fund flow data to understand the COVID-like shock. The artificial data is
generated from the normal distribution of real fund flow
during different phases of the COVID crisis. Further, the
model is studied in Subsec. II B for the COVID-19 shock
by using real fund flow and antifragility of the company.
A.

COVID-like shock

Study of the effect of the COVID-like shock on the
stock prices in terms of various shock lengths (TS ) and
different φ is very important to understand the market
crash and subsequent recovery. We have generated synthetic normalized fund flow (Ψst ) data from the distribution of Ψt [Eqn. 1] during the normal, shock and recovery period. The distribution of Ψt for the normal, shock
and recovery periods are N (0, 0.17), N (−0.2, 0.49) and
N (0.06, 0.22), respectively, and accordingly Ψst is generated. As the distribution of the Ψt is derived from real
data, the Ψst mimics the real situation. In this model
simulation, the recovery time period (TR ) is taken equal
to TS , and the justification is given in detail in Subsec. III C. The value of λ = 0.2, 0.1, 0.7, 0.3 during

pre-covid normal period, shock period, recovery period
and post recovery period, respectively. The reason for
choosing different values of λ during different periods is
discussed in Sec.II B.
To understand the V-shape recovery of a quality stock,
the model simulation is carried out for the fixed φ = 0.4
with TS = 20 day (D), 40 D, 60 D, and 80 D, respectively, and for the fixed TS = 20 D with φ = 0.3, 0.4, 0.5
and 0.6. The value of φ and TS are chosen based on
the original stock price. Similarly, for the L-shape recovery of the financially stressed company, simulation is
carried for the φ = −0.08 with TS = 20 D, 40 D, 60 D,
and 80 D, respectively, and for the TS = 20 D with
φ = −0.05, − 0.15, − 0.25 and −0.35. In this case, the
value of φ and TS are chosen on the basis of the original
stock price. The detailed simulation result is given in
Sec. III.

B.

COVID-19 shock

The model simulation has been carried out for the
stock price during the COVID-19 using the Ψt and φ
for the Indian market. The Ψt has been calculated from
real net fund flow in the market due to FII and DII using
Eqn. 1. The fund flow data has been obtained from the
money control website [44]. The current financial status
of a company, φ, is estimated using Eqn. 2. The value of
φ for a sector has been calculated using Eqn. 3. The current assets, current liabilities and expenses of a company
have been derived from its financial statements, which are
obtained from Bombay Stock Exchange Ltd (BSE) [45].
The coefficient λ for a particular stock depends on the
ratio of fund flow to total fund flow in the market. In
the present case, the value of λ is taken in adhoc manner that can be guessed from the fund flow to a sector
due to the institutional investors. Fig. 1(a) shows the
normalized monthly fund flow due to mutual fund investors (MFI) in Pharma & Biotechnology (− ∗ −PH),
Fast Moving Consumers good(−∇−FMCG) and Hotel
Restaurant and tourism(− ⋄ −HRT). The above sector
data has been obtained from the Securities and Exchange
Board of India (SEBI) [46]. Fig. 1(b) shows the normalized fortnightly fund flow due to foreign portfolio investors (FPI) in Pharma & Biotechnology (− ∗ −PH),
Fast Moving Consumers good(−∇−FMCG) and Hotel
Restaurant and tourism(− ⋄ −HRT), and the data has
been obtained from National Securities Depository Ltd.,
India (NSDL) [47]. The figure shows that the fund
flow during shock decreased significantly, and during the
recovery phase, fund flow in the pharma and FMCG
sectors increased significantly. On the other hand, in
the Hotel Restaurant and tourism sector, fund flow remains almost constant after a drastic drop. Considering the above information, for the quality stock, we have
taken λ = 0.6, 0.2, 0.8, 0.6 for Nifty Pharma and λ =
0.6, 04, 0.9, 0.7 for Nifty FMCG index during the preCOVID normal period, shock period, recovery period and

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

This section aims to present the simulation results of
the effect of the TS and φ on the V- and L-shape recovery
of the stock price. The analysis of the original price and
the simulated price has also been carried out to identify
the shock and recovery time scales of the stock price.

Simulation of COVID-like shock

Fig. 2(a) shows the typical plot of V-shape recovery of
a quality stock using Ψst for different TS with φ = 0.4.
As the typical value of φ for a quality sector is around
0.4. The plot −, −−, · · · , and − · − show the stock price

and 80 D. Plot (b) shows the V-shape recovery using synthetic data for fixed TS = 20 D with φ = 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 and
0.6. D and φ represent day and financial antifragility. Vertical dashed line represents the starting point of shock. For the
simulation initial condition is taken as 0.5

spectively. The results show that the quality stock recovers very well to its pre-shock price for the TS = 20 D and
40 D. However, when the shock extended beyond 60 D,
it becomes difficult to recover because of the stock price’s
serious crash. It implies that the extended period of TS is
harmful even for the financially strong company. During
such kind of extended shock, the investor stays away from
investment in the market, which is sometimes termed by
the investors "Do not catch a falling knife" [48].
Fig. 2(b) shows the typical plot of V-shape recovery of
quality stocks for different φ with TS = 20 D. The typical
value of TS was 20 D during the COVID-19 for a quality
sector. The plot −, −−, · · · , and − · − show the stock
price movement for the φ = 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 and 0.6, respectively. The higher the value of φ, the recovery is rapid.
The results show that the quality stock recovers very well
for positive φ. Further, the quality stocks with higher φ
outperform its peer. Hence, the financially strong company recover from the shock and outperform compared to
another company observed during the COVID-19 [42, 43].
During crises, the investors invest heavily in such companies, and hence generates higher return [49].
Fig. 3(a) shows the typical plot of L-shape recovery of a
financially stressed stock for different TS with φ = −0.08.
Typical value of φ for this sector is around −0.08. The
plot −, −−, · · · , and −·− show the stock price movement

for the TS = 20 D, 40 D, 60 D, and 80 D respectively.
The simulation results show that the financially stressed
stock does not recover. As the value of TS increases,
the negative depth of stock price also increases. So, a
financially stressed company cannot survive the extended
TS , and have a big chance to die down. The investors
become very bearish on these company, and sell-off their
positions, and hence the chance of the recovery of the
stock price also becomes marginal.
Fig. 3(b) also shows the typical plot of the L-shape
behavior of a financially fragile stock for different φ with
TS = 20 D. The plot −, −−, · · · , and −·− show the stock
price movement for the φ = −0.05, − 0.15, − 0.25 and
−0.35, respectively. For the simulation of COVID-like
shock we have taken 0.5 as initial condition. The company with negative φ continues to slide down even during
the recovery phase of the overall market. The lower the
φ, the slide in stock price is rapid. So, a company with
a lower φ has a big chance to die down. As the investors
stay away from these companies, the chance of the stock
price recovery also becomes marginal as mentioned in the
previous paragraph.

COVID-19 shock

Fig. 4(a) and 4(b) show the simulation result (−−)
of the model using the normalized fund flow Ψt given
in Eqn 1, and − represents stock price of the Pharma
and FMCG index in Indian market during the COVID19 shock. The simulation results of Pharma and FMCG
indices show that the fall of the stock price due to the
COVID-19 shock starts from 1st week of March 2020, and
forms a bottom on 4th week of April 2020, as shown in
Fig. 4(a) and 4(b), respectively. The model simulation
shows a V-shape recovery in the stock price consistent
with the original stock price during the shock, as shown
in the same figure. We observed a lag in the formation of
the bottom between the model simulation data (SD) and
original data (OD). Original stock price recovers earlier
than the model. The possible reason for such lag may
be due to the fund allocation in the quality sectors by
the investors internally, which was not reflected in the
fund flow. For example, in India, during the pandemic,
the outlook in the Pharma and FMCG sectors becomes
positive, hence the fund allocation to these sectors due
to DII and retail investors increased rapidly that can be
understood only from investors’ buying sentiment. The
model for the quality index and company may behave
properly with minimum lag if index or company wise fund
flow data were available.
Fig. 5(a) and 5(b) show the simulation result for the
stock price that show L-shape recovery in Indian market
during COVID-19 shock. The simulation for Tata Motors
and BPCL show that the fall of the stock price due to
the COVID-19 shock starts from 1st week of March 2020,
and forms a bottom on 4th week of March 2020 as shown
in Fig. 5(a) and 5(b), respectively. We observed that

the stock with φ < 0 does not recover from the bottom,
i.e., the behavior of the price is L-shape, as shown in the
same figure. The main reasons for the poor allocation
of the fund, as shown in Fig. 1 in these stressed stocks,
are the non-essential nature of the product they produce,
negative outlook during COVID-19.

Time scale Analysis

The empirical mode decomposition (EMD) technique
is applied to identify the important TS and TR of stocks
and indices during the COVID-19 [50, 51]. The EMD
technique decomposes a signal into a number of intrinsic
mode functions (IMF) of different time scales by preserving the nonlinearity and nonstationarity of a time
series [52]. The detailed algorithms for identifying the
IMF using the EMD method is given in Ref. [40, 50].
The range of a time period of a particular IMF can

where P is the Cauchy principle value, and θ(t) =

[50]. We have applied EMD based Hilbert
tan−1
IM F (t)
Huang Transformation to obtain the τ of the stock data.
We have identified the τ of the Nifty Pharma and Nifty
FMCG index as quality stocks, and their model simulated
data during the COVID-19 shock. The data were taken
from [53, 54].
Fig. 6 shows the IMF of the Nifty Pharma index estimated using the EMD technique. The series is decomposed into four IMFs and a residue. Fig. 6 shows the
visualization. IMF1 represents the signal with the lowest
τ , and the τ increases with the increase in IMF numbers.
The residue represents the overall long-term trend of the
index. Each IMF represents a mono-frequency component of the stock data.
In order to identify the τ of the COVID-19 shock and
subsequent recovery of the quality stocks, we have first
identified the dominant IMF that fits the event as follows. We have calculated the correlation coefficient (ν)
between the original stock price and its IMFs and modelsimulated stock price and its IMFs. We have also calculated variance (σ 2 ) of the IMFs as shown in Table I.
The value of ν measures the relationship between the individual IMF and the stock price. Whereas, the value
of σ 2 measures the volatility of each IMF. From the Table I, the values of ν and σ 2 shows that the IMF4 is the
dominant mode for the original pharma and FMCG index and their model simulated data. All the four IMF4
modes along with their time series are shown in Fig 7 (a),
(b) (c) and (d), respectively. The average τ of the IMF4

for the pharma, FMCG index and simulated pharma and
FMCG are approximately 57 D, 56 D, 58 D and 58 D,
respectively. Vertical lines in the figure show the bottom
formation due to the COVID-19 shock. All the IMF4
shows that TS and TR are almost equal. For the pharma
and FMCG stocks TS ≈ TR ≈ 14 D. We have obtained
that the TS ≈ TR for all the quality stocks that show Vshape recovery. It is pertinent to mention that there is no
dominant mode present in the case of L-shape recovery.

CONCLUSION

In this paper, we have developed a model of the stock
price movement during the COVID-19 shock and its subsequent recovery. The simulation is carried out assuming that during shock, the price crashes due to the fund
outflow from the market, and does not depends on the
financial antifragility (φ) of a company. Whereas, the
recovery of the stock price depends on the fund inflow
towards a particular company or sector depending on φ.
The model simulates the stock price for different TS and
different φ using synthetic normalized net fund flow. The
model reproduces the stock price movement during the
pandemic very well. We have also identified the TS and
TR from the model and original data using EMD based
Hilbert Huang Transformation.
We obtained V-shape recovery of the quality stocks
with positive φ using synthetic normalized net fund flow
(Ψst ). The stock price recovers very well to its pre-shock
value for the TS = 20 D and 40 D with fixed φ = 0.4.
However, when the TS extends beyond 60 D, it becomes
difficult for the stock price to recover to its pre-shock
price. We also obtained the V-shape recovery for φ =

0.3, 0.4, 0.5 and 0.6 with fixed TS = 20 D. The stock
with a higher φ outperforms its peer with a lower φ after
crises. Such performance in the stock price of certain
quality stocks have been observed during the COVID-19
pandemic. In the case of the financially stressed stocks,
i.e., with negative φ, we obtained L-shape recovery of the
stock price, and such stocks show higher negative depth
in stock price with an increase in TS . As the value of φ
decreases, the duration of TS increases that have been
observed in several stocks during the pandemic.
We obtained V-shape recovery from the model using
the normalized net fund flow Ψt . In this simulation, we
have used the average value of φ of the Pharma and
FMCG. The simulated results are consistent with the
original stock price movement of the Pharma and FMCG
indices during the COVID-19 shock. On the other hand,
for the companies with negative φ, the model also consistent with L-shape movement of price.
Finally, we obtained that the TS and TR of a quality
stock during the COVID-19 is approximately equal. On
the other hand, the companies with φ < 0 is yet to recover. The value of TS and TR for different sectors will be
useful for making an investment decision. We observed
that for some sectors like the banking where φ > 0, it
still shows L-shape recovery. Such recovery depends on
various other factors which will be studied in future work.
