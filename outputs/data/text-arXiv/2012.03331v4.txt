Abstract. We review recent progress in the study of the large Nc limit of gauge theories from lattice
simulations. The focus is not only the planar limit but also the size of O(Nc−1 ) corrections for values of
Nc & 3. Some concrete examples of the topics we include are tests of large-Nc factorization, the topological
susceptibility, the glueball, meson and baryon spectra, the chiral dependence of masses and decay constants,
and weak matrix elements related to the ∆I = 1/2 rule in kaon decays.

1 Introduction
It is well known that SU (Nc ) gauge theories, with and
without matter content, simplify in the so called ’t Hooft
or planar limit [1], which corresponds to
Nc → ∞,

λ = g 2 Nc = fixed,

(1)

where g is the standard gauge coupling. This limit is nontrivial, as can be expected from the fact that asymptotic
freedom survives. This may be seen in the running of the
’t Hooft coupling,

which implies that a non-perturbative scale, Λ∞
QCD , will be
generated dynamically. The growth of the coupling at low
energies results in charge confinement and spontaneous
chiral symmetry breaking. The ’t Hooft limit therefore
captures the most important non-perturbative phenomena
of QCD.
In spite of the increased number of degrees of freedom, the theory simplifies to the extent that precise nonperturbative predictions can be made. In fact, it has been
a long-term aspiration that the theory could be solved in
this limit. An example of the simplification of the large Nc
limit is the remarkable Eguchi-Kawai (EK) reduction [2],
which shows that finite volume effects are absent. Under
certain conditions, the SU (∞) Yang-Mills theory can even
be reduced to a matrix model on a single site. Even though
a

the planar limit of QCD has not been solved analytically,
it is unquestionable that the large Nc limit has been of
great importance in the understanding of QCD, both from
a theoretical as well as phenomenological viewpoint.
Perturbative arguments indicate that the planar limit
of QCD is a theory of free and infinitely narrow glueballs and hadrons [1, 3, 4]. The hope is that the spectrum
of planar QCD provides a good approximation to that
at Nc = 3. The description of interactions and decays
requires however non-vanishing 1/Nc corrections. On the
other hand, some of the planar predictions are known to
fail dramatically, such as the famous ∆I = 1/2 rule in
kaon decays, indicating the relevance of at least some of
the subleading corrections. Lattice QCD can provide a
quantitative, first-principles determination of the subleading O(1/Nc ) corrections to the ’t Hooft limit by directly
simulating gauge theories at different Nc [5]. The strict
planar limit can be most efficiently explored by numerical methods using the celebrated EK reduction and its
variants. Progress in this area has been recently reviewed
in [6].
In this review, we will concentrate on the recent lattice explorations of SU (Nc ) gauge theories with varying
number of colours at zero temperature. We refer to earlier
reviews on the subject [7–9] for further results. Although
our focus will be QCD, some of the computations reviewed
might be interesting in the context of compositeness models of electroweak symmetry breaking [10, 11] and dark
matter models [12].
The structure of the review is as follows. In sec. 2, we
review the main large Nc predictions that have been tested
on the lattice. In sec. 3, we discuss the lattice approaches

to the planar limit and the important issue of scale setting
in this context. The main results in Yang-Mills at varying
Nc are described in sec. 4, while hadronic observables are
discussed in sec. 5. We end with some concluding remarks.

In addition, the number of one particle states cannot
be finite, because this would imply that the large momentum

2 Non-perturbative predictions at large Nc
In the absence of an analytical solution to the planar limit
of Yang-Mills theories, the known predictions are based on
counting powers of Nc in perturbation theory [1]. A quark
or antiquark is in the Nc or N c representation of SU (Nc )
and has one colour index, it is therefore represented by a
single directed line. A gluon is in the adjoint representation, which can be constructed out of the product of an
Nc and an N c , and can therefore be conveniently represented as a double line with opposite directions. The usual
Feynman notation for gluons is translated to the ’t Hooft
notation as depicted in Fig. 1. It is easy to see that planar vacuum diagrams involving only gluons scale as Nc2
to all orders in the loop expansion, while diagrams with
one fermion loop at the boundary and any internal planar
exchange of gluons scale as Nc . This result can be derived,
noting that a generic Feynman diagram in the double-line
notation looks like polygons attached by the double lines
to patch a surface. For planar diagrams the surface has the
topology of a sphere, while non-planar diagrams contain
handles, and fermion loops add holes. The power counting in Nc can be shown to be related to the topology of
the surface, more concretely to its Euler character, χ. A
diagram with h handles and f holes scales as
Ncχ

=

Nc2−2h−f .

(3)

The first prediction of the large Nc limit is that, if the
theory is confining, it must be a non-interacting theory
with an infinite tower of stable particles [3, 4]. To see this,
let us consider a singlet gluonic operator such as
OG (x) =

1

Tr[Fµν
].

(5)

Let us assume that there is a pole in the two point function, that is a particle in the spectrum, |pi, the scaling of
the two-point function implies
h0|OG (x)|pi ∼ Nc0 ,

X

while asymptotic freedom predicts powers of log(p2 /m2i ).
This can only happen if the sum over the spectrum contains an infinite number of states.

2.1 Mesons
A similar analysis can be done for mesons. Considering an
operator with the quantum numbers of a meson

and consequently the decay amplitude, that can be obtained from the three-point function, is suppressed by
Nc−1 , while the scattering amplitude 2 → 2 from the fourpoint function is suppressed by Nc−2 . The particle does
not decay nor scatter as Nc → ∞.

the large Nc counting gives

(9)

and therefore, if there are mesonic states in the spectrum,
they are stable and non-interacting in the ’t Hooft limit.
The operator OM creates a meson from the vacuum with
amplitude Nc0 , √
while the connected three-point function
scales as ∼ 1/ Nc , and the four-point function like ∼
Nc−1 . The tower of resonances must also be infinite for
the same argument outlined before for the gluons.
From eqs. (8) and (9), it follows
Fπ2 ∝ hAaµ (x)Aaµ (y)i ∝ Nc ,

2.2 Chiral Perturbation Theory
Spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking survives in the ’t
Hooft limit [13], and therefore the lightest states in the
spectrum are the light pseudoscalar mesons. Their mass
is O(Nc0 ), assuming the quark mass does not scale with
Nc , since to leading order in the quark mass:
Mπ2 =

Σ
(mu + md ).
Fπ2

(12)

Chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) and the chiral Lagrangian [14] describe accurately meson interactions at
low energies as an expansion in momentum and quark
mass:

Lχ = L(2)

(13)

extracted in terms of the measured spectrum, and imposing the correct large momentum behaviour of certain
correlation functions. For a review see [17].
It is well-known that the standard chiral Langrangian
needs to be extended to include the η 0 [14, 18–24], since
the singlet meson becomes degenerate with the remaining
pseudoscalar mesons in the planar limit. The η 0 mass receives a contribution from the UA (1) anomaly, that scales
as Nc−1 . The Witten-Veneziano (WV) formula [25,26] (see
also [27–31]) relates this contribution with the topological
susceptibility computed in a theory without quarks, ie. in
Yang-Mills (YM):

where Mq is the quark mass matrix, U = exp(i F2π ) and

SU (Nf ). The operators Oi are Lorentz and chirally invariant combinations of U , with four derivatives or two

couplings (LECs) [14]. The expansion parameter in ChPT

and becomes smaller and smaller as Nc → ∞. However,
the range of validity to the chiral effective theory does
not increase: the failure of the chiral expansion will be
abrupt when the energy reaches the mass of the heavy
resonances, Λχ . These masses are expected to scale as Nc0 ,
and therefore remain constant as we approach Nc → ∞.
One may typically consider Λχ ∼ Mρ .
An additional simplification of the chiral Lagrangian
comes from the fact that only a subset of the low-energy
couplings [14] are leading in Nc , ie. Li ∝ O(Nc ). These
are the ones that correspond to chiral operators (Oi ) with
a single flavour trace. This is because according to the
general rules, diagrams with more than one fermion loop
are subleading. More concretely, for Nf = 3 [14, 15]:
L1 , L2 , L3 , L5 , L8 , L9 , L10 ∝ O(Nc ),
2L1 − L2 , L4 , L6 , L7 ∝ O(1).

(16)

Phenomenological approaches have estimated the leading
Nc behaviour of these couplings by assuming that the chiral theory matches onto a theory of free resonances, the
resonant chiral theory [16]. The low-energy couplings result from the exchange of heavier resonances and can be

(18)

and we have considered massless quarks. The topological
susceptibility measures the θ dependence of the vacuum
energy, which should vanish for massless quarks. The WV
relation can be deduced from requiring that the η 0 contribution to the θ dependence exactly cancels the leading gluonic contribution, or from the anomalous chiral
Ward identity. This is one example where the diagrammatic analysis leads to the wrong conclusion: the leading
Nc scaling of the topological susceptibility is cancelled by
a naively subleading one.
The presence of the η 0 in the chiral Lagrangian makes
it necessary to correlate the large Nc and the momentum/mass expansions. The pion manifold is now U (Nf ),
and a consistent power counting [23, 24] ensures the same
scaling of the η 0 mass and the remaining pseudoscalar
mesons:

2.3 Baryons
Baryons are trickier in the ’t Hooft limit, since their mass
has a non-trivial scaling. Nevertheless their properties can
also be understood in a systematic expansion in 1/Nc
[3, 32–36]. By simple arguments, it can be seen that the
baryon mass scales with Nc . We recall that in QCD a
colour singlet can be formed by combining three quarks in
the fundamental representation: 3⊗3⊗3 → 1. In a general
SU (Nc ) theory, one would however need Nc fundamental quarks to create a baryon1 . This motivates the simple
expectation for the baryon mass: MB = m0 Nc + O(Nc0 ).
Moreover, the baryon–baryon to n-meson amplitude scales

An alternative would be including fermions in the antisymmetric representation of SU (Nc ), so that large-Nc baryons may
still be formed by three fermions [37].

2.4 Exotics
An interesting and timely question is that of exotic states,
such as tetraquarks. The standard lore [3, 4] used to be
that tetraquarks cannot exist in the ’t Hooft limit. The
argument however has been revised recently2 [39,40]. The
most recent conclusion is that the large Nc scaling does
not allow to establish whether these particles exist or not
in the spectrum, however if they do they must be infinitely
narrow, just like glueballs and mesons, for the same reasons outlined above. An analysis of the expected scaling
of the decay width of tetraquarks with different flavour
content can be found in [40].
It is interesting to analyse the old argument supporting the non-existence of exotics [3, 4]. It relies on the fact
that the two point correlation function of two tetraquark
operators (constructed from two quark bilinears) has a
factorized contribution, leading in Nc , corresponding to
the propagation of two non-interacting mesons. However,
the tetraquark pole, if it exists, should appear in the connected part of the correlator [39] which is subleading in
Nc . In other words the factorized and connected terms
might describe the dynamics of different processes, one is
not necessarily the subleading Nc correction of the other,
and both can in principle survive the ’t Hooft limit. It
might be a challenge in practice to isolate such exotic
states from a two meson state, since the overlap of any
operator with the right quantum numbers with the two
meson state dominates over that with the exotic one.

2.5 Factorization
More generally, large Nc implies the factorization of expectation values of products of singlet operators in the
pure gauge theory:

This property underlies for example the OZI rule and
the EK reduction. It should be stressed however that the
disconnected and connected parts of any such observable
could represent different physics.

Note the mismatch between the arXiv and published versions of Ref. [39]. Here we refer to the latter.

2.6 Weak interactions
Finally, we discuss hadronic weak interactions in the planar limit. One of the most famous failures of the large Nc
approximation is the ∆I = 1/2 rule, that is the large hierarchy observed in the kaon decay amplitudes to two pions
in the two possible states of isospin I = 0, 2:
A0
∼ 22.
A2

T [K 0 → (ππ)I ] = iAI eiδI ,

(22)

These amplitudes were established as benchmark lattice
calculations since the early days [41], but remain very
challenging. Only very recently [42–46], convincing evidence has been presented that the ∆I = 1/2 rule is reproduced near the physical point of 2 + 1 simulations. It
is well known that the ∆I = 1/2 rule plays a key role in
the Standard Model prediction of the direct CP violating
ratio 0 /.
Surprisingly large Nc misses completely the ∆I = 1/2
enhancement [47, 48]. This is easy to see by comparing
the large Nc scaling of the decays K + → π + π 0 and K 0 →
π 0 π 0 , which in terms of the isospin amplitudes are:

where the Nc scaling can be easily deduced by inspection
of the diagrams, see Fig. 2, contributing to each amplitude3 . This implies that, at the leading order in large Nc ,
the neutral K 0 does not decay and therefore from eq. (23)
it follows:

Nc →∞

One possible explanation of this discrepancy is the fact
that the dynamics involves multiple scales: the W mass,
the charm mass and hadronic scales, and maybe subleading 1/Nc corrections could be enhanced by large logarithms.
At energies below the W -boson mass, we can integrate
it out and represent the weak interactions in the Fermi
theory. For example the CP-conserving ∆S = 1 transitions the Hamiltonian density takes the simple form:

effective Hamiltonian should be valid down to energies
above the charm mass. The Wilson coefficients k ± do
indeed get large logarithms from the MW → µ [49, 50],
but it is not enough to explain the large hierarchy, since
k − (mc )/k + (mc ) ∼ 2.

the latter, we find the famous penguin operators such as

The standard lore for a long time was that the matrix
elements of the penguin operators were enhanced and,
since they are octets that do not contribute to A2 , this
fact could be at the origin of the ∆I = 1/2 [52]. This
hypothesis does not seem to be confirmed by the last lattice results, where the current operators of eq. (26) give
the dominant contribution to the real part of the isospin
amplitudes, as anticipated long ago in Ref. [53]. Instead
it has been argued that the enhancement originates in
a strong cancellation of the colour-connected and colourdisconnected contributions of the current operator matrix
elements [42]. Such contributions have a different Nc scaling, and therefore indicate anomalously large Nc corrections.
At sufficiently low energies and quark masses, a further
simplification is possible since the effective hamiltonians,
eqs. (25) or (27) can be matched to the corresponding

A large ratio g − /g + could explain the ∆I = 1/2 rule, an

These low-energy couplings can be determined from
matching appropriate correlation functions in ChPT and
lattice QCD [54, 55]. The simplest choices are the ratios:

with appropriately chosen flavours i, j.
Including the renormalization factors and the Wilson
coefficients, we get the physical amplitudes, A± , that can
be matched to the corresponding observables in the chiral
theory [54, 55]. At lowest order the matching condition is
lim A± = g ± .

We find that the leading correction, O(1/Nc ) together
with the leading effects of dynamical quarks, O(Nf /Nc2 ),
are fully anticorrelated in the ratios. This analysis does
not predict the sign of the different terms, i.e., the sign of
the ã − d˜ coefficients, only the (anti)-correlation between
the two amplitudes. In particular, a negative sign of ã
and b̃ results in an enhancement of the ratio A− /A+ . The
scaling of eq. (34) is valid for all quark masses, but the
different coefficients could be have a different quark mass
dependence.
The lattice can in principle measure all these coefficients and determine whether they have the natural size,
O(1), and quantify to what extent the anti-correlation is
enough to explain the ∆I = 1/2 rule.
A similar matching to chiral perturbation theory could
also be done in the Nf = 3 flavour theory, where the
leading order weak Hamiltonian has also two operators
with the same chiral structure, corresponding to the 27plet and octet operators [56]. The case of a heavy charm
is however much more demanding, not only the list of

operators to consider on the lattice is much longer, but it
involves the computation of all-to-all propagators.
There is a long list of phenomenological analyses that
have used large-Nc inspired methods to estimate the size
of these couplings, in an analogous way to the strong couplings, Li . Examples are the dual QCD approach [53, 57,
58], the resonance chiral theory [16] or the chiral quark
model [59], etc. In all cases, the relevance of subleading
corrections in Nc−1 has been demonstrated, and argued
to be related to a strong scale dependence. Incorporating
these systematically is not easy and the error resulting
from these approaches is therefore quite uncertain. For a
review see [60].

3 Lattice QCD at large Nc

Two approaches have been followed to explore the ’t Hooft
limit in the lattice formulation. The most straightforward
approach is to simulate5 at different values of Nc [5, 63–
65], and study the scaling of any physical quantity in
units of some reference scale, such as ΛQCD , which is
well defined when Nc → ∞. The cost of the simulation
increases with Nc , in particular, for dynamical simulations the cost of a single configuration scales like ∼ Nc2 ,
dominated by matrix-vector multiplications for the inversion of the Dirac operator. However, statistical fluctuations seem to decrease, as can be expected from the factorization property, eq. (21). This was also observed in
Refs. [66, 67], although a large Nc scaling of the autocorrelation time has not been done yet. Reaching very
large values of Nc = O(100) is however not possible with
this method. The Eguchi-Kawai reduction [2] allows to
study the leading behaviour in Nc much more efficiently
by exploiting the volume independence ensured by factorization, and reducing the model to a single-point lattice
model. Different variants of the EK reduction exist [68–73]
in the literature, and they have been successfully implemented to compute the ’t Hooft limit of several physical
observables [74–79]. We will show some of the most recent
results, but a more detail account of reduced models can
be found in [6].
The complementarity of both approaches is evident
when trying to evaluate the subleading 1/Nc corrections.
While these corrections cannot be captured by the reduced
models, they can be straightforwardly computed with the
direct method. The input provided by the reduced model
on the planar limit is nevertheless very helpful to constrain
the asymptotic Nc dependence.

HiRep is a publicly available lattice QCD code that allows
one to simulate generic SU (Nc ) theories with different fermion
content [61, 62].

3.1 Scale setting and Nc -dependence
The outcome of a lattice calculation is always a either
dimensionless ratio, or a dimensionful quantity in terms
of the lattice spacing, a. In QCD, the value of the lattice spacing is typically fixed by some experimental input
(e.g., a mass or decay constant). Once a is known, any observable can be converted to physical units (MeV, fm,...).
The procedure of computing a in physical units is known
as the (absolute) scale setting. Of course, a complete calculation will require simulations at multiple values of a,
and a continuum limit extrapolation for the observables
of interest.
In the context of large Nc , the scale setting is a more
subtle issue, and it necessarily involves some arbitrariness. To illustrate this, let us consider the case of a pure
SU (Nc ) gauge theory. We could perform simulations with
varying Nc , and compute the ratio of two different scales,
Λ1 /Λ2 in the continuum limit. These scales could for instance be masses of glueballs with different quantum numbers. Then, we could fit the functional form of the Nc dependence as:
Λ2
c2
= c1 + 2 + . . . ,
Λ1
Nc

in the pure gauge theory without fermions. This is a wellposed problem, and does not require any absolute knowledge of the lattice spacing (only a relative one for the continuum limit). We may however know the value for these
two scales from experiments in QCD6 , and we would like
to infer their values as a function of Nc . For this, one
necessarily needs to impose a known Nc dependence—an
all-orders ansatz—for one of the scales of the theory. The
simplest choice is to pick, e.g., Λ1 as constant for all values of Nc . This fully fixes the prescription for the large
Nc limit, and implicitly the lattice spacing at all values of
Nc via the scale Λ1 . It is clear that different choices of Λ1
will produce differences in the subleading 1/Nc corrections
for other physical quantities, but the same ratios in two
different prescriptions will have the same Nc scaling.
From a practical point of view, it is much more convenient to study the Nc dependence by using lattice simulations at a constant line of physics. In other words, to
establish the prescription for the large Nc limit at the time
of the simulation. For instance, in early work [63], simulations were compared at a constant value of the mean-field
improved bare ’t Hooft coupling defined as:
λI (a−1 ) =

2Nc2
,
βP

(36)

where P is the plaquette normalized by Nc . One may say
that simulations with constant λI at different Nc have the
same value of the lattice spacing. Thus, after fixing a from
Nc = 3, the large Nc prescription is fully fixed.

Assuming that the effects of quark loops are negligible.

A different line of constant physics was chosen in Ref.
[80]. There, the string tension —labelled as σ—was used.7
In this work, the authors used existing results for σ as
a function of Nc [81–85] to generate gauge
configurations
√
with Nc ∈ [2, 17] and fixed value of a σ. Moreover, they
used the “ad hoc value σ = 1 GeV/fm” to define their
lattice spacing for all values of Nc . To further iIlustrate
the ambiguity at large Nc , we can look at the behaviour of
the coupling in eq. (36) in the simulations in Ref. [80]. We
will easily see that λI (a−1 ) it is not constant, but rather
it is modified at order 1/Nc2 .
In the last few years, the usage of the gradient flow [86]
has become customary for the scale setting on the lattice [87]—also in the context of large Nc . The advantage is
that the energy density can be used to determine a renormalized ’t Hooft coupling in the gradient flow scheme:

√
with λGF defined at the scale 1/ 8t. The gradient flow
coupling has been related to the M S coupling in perturbation theory [88]. A standard approach in QCD is to define
the scale t0 via the energy density as a function of the flow
time:
t2 hE(t)i t=t0 = 0.3.
(38)
hE(t)i ≡

Even though t0 cannot be measured experimentally, its
value in physical units has been extracted from various
lattice calculations [87,89,90]. In Ref. [91] it was proposed
to generalize the definition of t0 to
t2 hE(t)i

t=t0

(39)

so that results at different Nc may √
be compared. Moreover,
the same authors opt for fixing t0 ∼ 0.166 fm for all
values of Nc .
In dynamical simulations with varying Nc , an additional convention8 regarding the quark mass must be imposed to compare across values of Nc . This is because
a generic observable, including t0 , depends on the quark
masses. An option that fully fixes the convention could be
matching the chirally extrapolated value of t0 for different
gauge groups. In Ref. [92] with Nf = 2 simulations,
two
p
different conditions were imposed: (i) the ratio t00 /r1 is
fixed, where t00 for Nc = 3 is the standard one in eq. (38),
and r1 is related9 to the Sommer parameter [94, 95] , and
(ii) the ratio of the vector meson mass over the pion mass
is matched. More recently, in Ref. [66] with Nf = 4 simulations, the generalized value of t0 as in eq. (39) at Mπ = 420
MeV was fixed for all values of Nc .
7

The string tension, σ, parametrizes the confining term
of the potential for two static quark-antiquark sources, i.e.,
V (r) = v + σr + c/r, with v, c constants.
8
We assume Nf degenerate flavours for simplicity.
9
The modified Sommer parameter, r1 , is defined in terms
of the force between static quarks via the implicit equation
r2 F (r) = −1.0 at r = r1 . In physical units, r1 = 0.31 fm as
measured in real-world QCD [93].

As a further check of the consistency of this scale setting, one can also study the chiral dependence of t0 when
varying the number of colours. The prediction from Chiral

1/Nc suppression of the mass dependence is consistent
with the quenched limit, in which t0 is mass independent. In Fig. 6, we show this chiral dependence along with
the corresponding chiral fits. As can be seen, the data
for Nc = 4, 5, 6 lie almost on top of some universal line,
whereas Nc = 3 has larger 1/Nc effects.

4 Yang-Mills theories at large Nc
In this section, we review various results for pure SU (Nc )
Yang-Mills theories, including the factorization theorem,
the glueball spectrum and topological observables.

4.1 Large Nc factorization
One of the simplest yet powerful results in the large Nc
limit is the factorization of observables, eq. (21). This result is derived from a perturbative analysis, but can be
tested non perturbatively in lattice simulations at different values of Nc . Recently, such study was carried out in
Refs. [97, 98].
In order to test the factorization hypothesis, the authors use various quantities, e.g., a square spatial Wilson
loop at the point (x0 , x) with size Rc and Wilson-flowed
to time t:
W (c) = hW (t, x0 , ~x, Rc )i,

W sq (c) = hW 2 (t, x0 , ~x, Rc )i,

The flow time is a fraction of
√ t0 , eq. (39), t = ct0 , and the
size is chosen as 10 Rc = 8ct0 . Note that the authors
use open boundary conditions, to avoid topology freezing,
and x0 must be taken far from the boundary. The ratio
GW (c) =

W sq (c) − W 2 (c)
,
W 2 (c)

(42)

according to the factorization property, is expected to be
of order 1/Nc2 . The results for GW (1) in this study are
shown in Fig. 7. As can be seen, the authors find very
good consistency with the factorization hypothesis both at
a finite lattice spacing (fixed t0 /a2 ), and in the continuum
limit. For other gluonic observables, the authors also find
the expected large Nc scaling and confirm the factorization
hypothesis.
The dependence of GW (c) on the size of the loop is
also studied. For this, they define a new observable ĜW (ξ),
that depends on the Wilson loop
c (ξ) = hW (t0 /2, x0 , ~x, Rξ )i
W

with varying radius, Rξ = ξ 4t0 . The authors fit the 1/Nc
scaling as:
b W (ξ) = b0 + b1 1 + b2 1 .

Nc4

(44)

As expected, b0 is always compatible with zero. In contrast, the results for the coefficient of the subleading corrections , shown in Fig. 8, seem to grow exponentially with
the size of the Wilson loop.
This shows that the coefficient of the subleading corrections can be large, but this is not necessarily a signal
of failure of the large Nc expansion. This is because the
leading and subleading contributions can be related to different physics scales. While the disconnected and leading

in Ref. [109]. These levels have been omitted in Fig. 9.
In the large Nc limit, their energy is simply given by
the non-interacting one, as glueball interactions are suppressed with Nc . Still, at large but finite Nc these levels
can be used to study interactions among glueballs. So far,
these studies have only been attempted for SU (2) using
the HAL QCD method [110–112]. It would be interesting
to perform a conclusive Lüscher analysis of two-glueball
interactions, and its Nc -dependence.
It is also worth mentioning that the large Nc limit of
Sp(2Nc ) and SU (Nc ) coincides, as shown in Ref. [113].
Thus, the Sp(2Nc ) results in Refs. [114, 115] are also relevant for the large Nc limit of QCD. A confirmation of
the expectation, supported by the data, is that the ratio
of masses for the tensor and scalar glueball seems to be
independent of the gauge group. In particular, it agrees
for Sp(∞) and SU (∞).

4.2 Glueballs at large Nc

(45)

The glueball spectrum is a very interesting nontrivial manifestation of non perturbative dynamics in the pure YangMills theory. Describing glueballs in the pure gauge theory
may help us finding their analogues in full QCD, assuming
their mix with q̄q states is not large. Moreover, the lowest
spectrum of a pure SU (Nc ) that weekly interacts with the
SM particles has been proposed as a candidate for dark
matter [102]—see also Ref. [12].

As we have seen in sec. 2 the Witten-Veneziano equation,
eq. (17), relates this observable in Yang-Mills to the mass
of the η 0 meson in the planar limit of QCD. Studying the
size of this subleading 1/Nc is important to quantify how
far from the planar limit QCD is.

Some of the states in the low-lying glueball spectrum
correspond to two-particle scattering states, as discussed

the Witten-Veneziano equation, computing directly the η 0
mass, has also been carried out in Ref. [121] for Nc = 3.

The first computation of the topological susceptibility
in the large Nc limit was attempted two decades ago, in
Ref. [117]. One of the main difficulties is the critical slowThe dependence of the glueball spectrum on the num- ing down [118], that is, the very long autocorrelation time

The simplest question one may ask regarding hadrons is
how the spectrum depends on the number of colours. As
already discussed, all mesons are expected to become stable particles at large Nc , and thus they may be treated as
asymptotic states, rather than resonances.

5 Hadronic quantities at large Nc

Fig. 11: Large Nc meson spectrum in different channels,
with J P C as provided in the x-labels. We compare the results from standard large-Nc approach from Ref. [80], to
the ones obtained using the Twisted Eguchi-Kawai reduction [127]. In the case of Ref. [127], the smaller errorbars
are statistical, whereas the larger ones include the systematics of chiral and continuum extrapolation.

Here, we review recent results of hadronic quantities in the
context of the large Nc limit of QCD. We start with the
meson and baryon spectrum. Then we discuss the chiral
dependence of the meson masses, decay constants, scattering lengths and the topological susceptibility. We then
turn to novel results on weak amplitudes related to the
∆I = 1/2 rule.

The most extensive study of the meson spectrum was
performed in Ref. [80]. It was done using the quenched
approximation at a fixed lattice spacing. Although it is
known that quenching alters some 1/Nc corrections, the
strict large Nc limit is the same for both the dynamical
and quenched theory (with fundamental fermions). More
recently, large Nc results from reduced models [127, 128]
were made public. We compare the results of the two ap-

proaches in Fig. 11. As can be seen, there is a reasonable
overall agreement, with differences of at most 2σ. It must
be noted that while Ref. [80] has better statistical accuracy, the results may be affected by significant discretization errors13 . In contrast, those of Ref. [127] are in the
continuum limit.
Another interesting observation is the one of Ref. [130].
The authors found that the ration Mρ /Fπ in the chiral
limit seemed independent on Nf in Nc = 3:

The comparison of the previous equation indicates that
both, 1/Nc2 and Nf /Nc effects are rather small in this ratio. This is consistent with the result of Ref. [131], where
the authors summarized the dependence on the gauge
group and fermionic representation of the same quantity
using all existing lattice data [80, 132–138]. They pointed
out that it is almost constant up to a trivial factor √
that
depends on the dimensionality of the fermion fields— Nc
for SU (Nc ). We should also mention that the result in
eq. (48) is in the ballpark of predictions from a resonance
chiral theory [139].

5.2 Baryons
A series of publications have studied the scaling of baryon
masses with the number of colours: first, in the quenched
approximation [140, 142, 143], and more recently with dynamical quarks (Nf = 2) [141]. These have been carried
out at a single lattice spacing. In a generic SU (Nc ) theory, the spin of the baryon can take half-integer for odd
Nc (fermionic baryons, as in QCD), or integer values for
even Nc (bosonic baryons).
It has been long known [33] that baryon masses depend on their angular momentum. This is the so-called
hyperfine splitting, which for the case of two degenerate
quarks takes the form:
MB (Nc , J) = Nc m0 (Nc ) +

J(J + 1)
B + ··· ,
Nc

(49)

with m0 , B being O(Nc0 ) constants. Note that they can
have a subleading Nc dependence, for instance, for m0 :
(0)

m0 = m0 +
13

and similarly for B. Generalizations of the eq. (49) that incorporate the strange quark also exist in the literature [36,
144]. The constants in eq. (49) can be isolated by taking
appropriate combinations, for instance:

Nf =2−6

whereas at large Nc , the following result is found [80]:
r

11

(1)

m0
+ ...,
Nc

(50)

A continuum extrapolation is available for SU (7) [129].

The general conclusions of Refs. [140, 142] is that the
qualitative expectations of large Nc are satisfied by the
data, including those of the SU (3)-flavour breaking due
to the strange quark. In Ref. [143], combined chiral and
Nc fits of the mass and hyperfine splitting were performed,
using a consistent expansion in Baryon Chiral Perturbation Theory. That study was able to constrain some of the
subleading low-energy constants (LECs).
As an example, we show in Fig. 12 the scaling of m0
and B with the number of colours for the quenched and
dynamical baryons at approximately fixed Sommer scale
r1 [95] and Mπ /Mρ . As can be seen from the plots, quenched
and Nf = 2 results for r1 m0 agree at fixed Nc , and in the
large Nc extrapolation. For r1 B, uncertainties are larger,
and some quenching effects may be appreciated. We stress
that relative discretization errors may be large, and so,
this comparison must be taken as qualitative.
It is also worth mentioning that there have been lattice studies of baryons in the context of BSM physics.
These have focused on studying a SU (4) gauge theory
with both two fundamental and two sextet fermions [145–
147]. This model represents a slight simplification of the
asymptotically-free composite-Higgs Ferretti model [148,
149].

5.3 Chiral and Nc dependence of light meson
observables

In Ref. [66], a first-principles calculation of the Nc scaling of the low-energy couplings (LECs) of the chiral Lagrangian has been presented. The LECs are extracted
from the chiral dependence of meson masses and decay
constants. The lattice setup of this work is Nf = 4, with
O(a)-improved Wilson fermions in the sea, and mixed action with twisted mass in the valence. This has the advantage of automatic O(a) improvement, avoiding the need of
non-perturbative renormalization factors.
First the authors consider each value of Nc separately.
They perform a chiral fit of the data points to extract the
LO and NLO low-energy constants appearing in the NLO

The scaling with the number of colours of these quantities
is known: F 2 , L5 and L8 are O(Nc ), while B, L4 and L6
are O(Nc0 ). The results of these fits are shown in Figs. 13a
and 13b. One can see that the scaling is well described
by leading and subleading Nc corrections for Nc = 4 − 6,
while there seems to be significant 1/Nc2 corrections for
Nc = 3 in the case of F and LF . In the case of B and LM ,
there is no sign of 1/Nc2 effects.
As explained in sec. 2.2, the chiral regime at large Nc
requires the addition of the η 0 , and a combined power
counting of the usual momentum/mass expansion with
that in 1/Nc . Using the standard power-counting [18–21,

We note that in the setup of this work, the value of the

The resulting B is therefore also bare.

An interesting observation of Ref. [66] is that by studying the first coefficients in the 1/Nc expansion, one can infer the values of some quantities at different value of Nf ,
since the leading corrections come from fermion loops and
are therefore of the form Nf /Nc (the non-planar gluonic
corrections start at 1/Nc2 ). The simplest example is the
decay constant in the chiral limit, whose leading Nf , Nc

Since Fe1 is trivially related by a factor Nf to one of the
fit parameters in eq. (57), the authors are able to quote
inferred results for Nf = 2 and 3:
F Nc =3,Nf =2 = 81(7) MeV,
F Nc =3,Nf =3 = 68(7) MeV,

(59)

which are in good agreement with phenomenological and
lattice determinations—see Ref. [154]. The same strategy
is followed for the LECs, and the chiral condensate.
We should also mention that the chiral behaviour of
Fπ in Nf = 2 simulations (and the equivalent for vector
meson) was also studied at in Ref. [141], albeit no chiral
fits were performed.
Another quantity that may be explored are meson scattering amplitudes. Although they vanish in the exact large
Nc limit, it is interesting to study the subleading Nc behaviour, and the interplay with the quark mass depen-

Nc
that is consistent with the Nc -scaling discussed in sec. 2.2.
In finite volume, scattering amplitudes may be obtained with the Lüscher formalism [155], and generalizations thereof (see Ref. [156] for a review). In the so-called
threshold (or 1/L) expansion, valid for weakly interacting systems, it is possible to relate the finite-volume energy shift of the two-particle ground state to the scattering
length by to the scattering length, see Ref. [155].
Recently, preliminary results for the isospin-2 scattering length at Nc = 3 − 6 have been presented [157]. As
Nc grows, two different effects compete. The signal for the
energy shift becomes weaker as the scattering length decreases, but the statistical error gets reduced as a result of
the increase of gluonic degrees of freedom. In Ref. [157]
aI=2
at Nc > 3 was obtained with good accuracy, and a
0
remarkable agreement with leading order ChPT [see eq.
(60)] was found.
Additional channels, such as the isospin-0 (σ) channel
may represent an interesting problem to study in the large
Nc context. It has been argued that the Nc -scaling may
shed light on the nature of the σ resonance [158–161].
Another very interesting application would be the study
of tetraquarks with different flavour content in the planar
limit [39, 40].
Finally, we should mention the results for the ρ18 and
the isospin-2 channels in SU (2) [162, 163]. Note that in
this case the symmetry breaking pattern for Nc = 2 is
different than the one in Nc > 3, and so effective field
theory expectations differ.

5.4 Topological susceptibility with dynamical quarks
The topological susceptibility is an observable that has a
very different behaviour in the pure Yang-Mills theory and
in QCD with light quarks. In the former, discussed in sec.
4.3, χY M depends only weakly in the number of colours;
whereas in the latter, it vanishes in the chiral limit for all
values of Nc . It has been predicted [18, 164, 165] that the
topological susceptibility mass-dependence is as follows:
1
2Nf
1
= 2 2+
.
χ(Mπ )
Fπ M π
χY M

(61)

In the previous equation, the pure gauge (quenched) limit
is achieved by letting Mπ → ∞, whereas at small pion
mass, one simply has χ(Mπ ) ∝ Mπ2 .
17

For the scattering length, we are using the convention
k cot δ0 = −1/a0 + O(k2 ).
18
The ρ resonance has been treated as a stable state in
Refs. [80, 130, 141]. This is rigorous for heavier pion masses,
but implies systematic errors for lighter pions.

In the last few years, impressive progress has been achieved
in the lattice determination of the K → ππ amplitudes,
and the related CP violation observable 0 / [42–46]. The

with a heavy charm [46].

Fig. 15: Topological susceptibility as a function of the pion
mass in Nf = 2 QCD. The solid line is the functional form
in eq. (61), using the continuum results of Refs. [116,166].
The dashed lines are the expectations in the two regimes
(quenched and light pions). The various coloured points
are the results of Ref. [167] with Nc = 3 − 5.

The topological susceptibility with dynamical fermions
has been studied for Nc = 3 [166, 168–170]. The most
recent result [166], includes a continuum limit extrapolation. In the present year, a “pilot study” with varying
Nc = 3 − 5 [167] was also published.
Combining the results in the Yang-Mills theory [116],
with the Nf = 2 ones [166] one can produce an interpolating curve between the two regimes based on eq. (61).
This can be compared to the results of Ref. [167] with
Nc = 3 − 5. As can be seen, qualitative (but not quantitative) agreement is observed. One possibility to explain the
disagreement are discrezation effects, which were found in
Ref. [166] to be relevant with the Wilson fermionic action.
Finite volume effects may also be significant in Ref. [167].

In an earlier work [42], an analysis of the various contributions to K → ππ suggested that the main source of
the enhancement comes from the current-current operators, eqs. (26). It emerges from a strong cancellation of the
isospin-2 amplitude, as a result of a negative relative sign
between the colour-connected and colour-disconnected contractions, which scale differently in large Nc . The scaling
in Nc of these amplitudes allows therefore to disentangle
the two contributions rigorously, and has been studied in
Refs. [67, 171].
In these studies an old strategy [54, 55] was revisited
in the context of large Nc , where a light active charm,
mass-degenerate with the up quark, was included, simplifying enormously the calculation. In this scenario, only
the two current-current operators, Q± , fully describe the
∆S = 1 transitions. A matching to Nf = 4 chiral perturbation theory, allows to extract the low-energy couplings, g ± , representing the strength of these interactions
in the chiral Lagrangian, eq. (29). The couplings can be
extracted from the measurement of the simpler K → π
amplitudes, A± in the chiral limit. The determination of
g ± gives then an indirect estimate of the K → ππ isospin
amplitudes.
The expected large Nc scaling of the amplitudes A±
has been presented in eq. (34). By means of appropriate
linear combinations, one can isolate the (anti-)correlated

The Nc scaling of these combinations was analysed in
Ref. [67] in three different scenarios: (i) quenched results

and (iii) dynamical results (Nf = 4) at a lighter pion
mass ∼ 360 MeV. This can be seen in Fig. 16 and Table 1.
The main conclusion from this study is that all coefficients
turned out to be of the natural size. Importantly, the sign
of the ã and b̃ coefficients is the same and negative. This
implies that both terms contribute to reduce the A+ amplitude and enhance, in a correlated way, the amplitude
A− . Moreover, it can be seen that the mass dependence
for the Nf = 4 results seems to affect mostly the coeffi-

where the error is only statistical. Finally, an indirect estimate of the K → ππ isospin amplitudes can be derived using the LO ChPT prediction in eq. (31), and also the NLO

this ratio in the theory with a light charm is

The main conclusion from this work is that the large
enhancement observed in the ∆I = 1/2 rule seems consistent with coefficients in the 1/Nc expansion that are of
the natural size, but with an important effect coming from
the quark loops. In addition, the result in eq. (66) suggests
that the enhancement may indeed be largely dominated
by intrinsic QCD effects, and not from the intermediate
scale set by the charm quark mass.

Nc scaling of various physical quantities at zero temperature, using the conventional approach of comparing standard lattice simulations at physical volumes and increasing values of Nc . Some of the results obtained with nonstandard approaches, such as the Eguchi-Kawai reduction
(and variations thereof), are also included in the comparison of results.
We have presented results in pure Yang-Mills, more
specifically, a non-perturbative study of factorization, the
glueball spectrum and the topological susceptibility. In the
case of theories with fermions, results on the meson and
baryon spectrum, the chiral behaviour of meson masses
and decay constants, the topological susceptibility and
some preliminary results on ππ scattering have been reviewed. We discussed in some detail a compelling new result on the 1/Nc scaling of weak amplitudes related to the
∆I = 1/2 rule in kaon decays.
In most of these cases, the expected scaling in Nc is
confirmed. Coefficients of the natural size are found, that
is O(Nc−1 ) relative corrections. In particular, this is found
to be the case for the ratio of isospin amplitudes in kaon
decays. In some cases, however, the coefficients of the subleading corrections might be significantly enhanced when
leading and subleading corrections do measure different
physics scales. This is for example the case when studying
violations to factorization.
In this respect one interesting direction for future work
is the study of meson interactions with growing Nc . This
involves not only pion scattering, but also glueball interactions and potential exotic resonances, such as tetraquarks,
that may prevail at large Nc .
Finally we should mention other works that we have
not reviewed, for instance, Ref. [174]. A number of results
at varying Nc at finite-temperature exist19 [64,82,84,175–
19

See Ref. [8] for a discussion of earlier results on finitetemperature at large Nc .

fermion content can be found in [114, 185–187].
