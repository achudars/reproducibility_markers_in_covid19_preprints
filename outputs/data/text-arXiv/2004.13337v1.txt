Abstract
In this paper, we investigate the ongoing dynamics of COVID-19 in India after its emergence
in Wuhan, China in December 2019. We discuss the effect of nationwide lockdown implemented
in India on March 25, 2020 to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Susceptible-Exposed-InfectiousRecovered (SEIR) model is used to forecast active COVID-19 cases in India considering the effect
of nationwide lockdown and possible inflation in the active cases after its removal on May 3, 2020.
Our model predicts that with the ongoing lockdown, the peak of active infected cases around 43,000
will occur in the mid of May, 2020. We also predict a 7% to 21% increase in the peak value of
active infected cases for a variety of hypothetical scenarios reflecting a relative relaxation in the
control strategies implemented by the government in the post-lockdown period. For India, it is
an important decision to come up with a non-pharmaceutical control strategy such as nationwide
lockdown for 40 days to prolong the higher phases of COVID-19 and to avoid severe load on its
public health-care system. As the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak remains a global threat, it is a
challenge for all the countries to come up with effective public health and administrative strategies
to battle against COVID-19 and sustain their economies.

INTRODUCTION

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel
coronavirus/COVID-19 outbreak was declared as a global public health emergency by
the World Health Organization (WHO) on January 30, 2020 and later as pandemic [1]. The
virus seemed to have emerged in the population in Wuhan, China from the local wholesale
seafood market in late December 2019 as per the information available in public domain [2].
The rising cases in China resulted in impinging several preventive and mitigation strategies
by Chinese government to control the outbreak. By January 23, all rail, road, and air
transports from Wuhan city were closed and quarantine was extended to other cities in the
province [3].
Subsequently, rapidly rising global cases caused national emergencies in many countries
putting their public health and administration departments at challenging situations. Figure 1 shows total cumulative confirmed cases for selected countries till date. As seen from
figure 1, USA, Spain and Italy are the most affected countries at present. Several other
countries are facing a rapidly rising number of cases. The number of cases in China and
South Korea have significantly reduced and the curve is flattened. The number of cases
in India seems to be steadily growing amid nationwide lockdown. With the fast spreading
of COVID-19, the global numbers have reached almost 3 million which is concerning national and international agencies. Researchers across the globe are working on developing
a vaccine and antiviral drugs to fight Covid-19. UK have recently started a vaccine trial
on humans [4]. Until a vaccine or anti-viral drug becomes available, suppression strategies
involving public lockdown and social distancing are necessary to control the transmission
though it has negative socio-economic impact.
Strategies implemented in various countries involved a mixed combination of mitigation
and suppression strategies to control the epidemic [5]. Strategies such as social distancing,
closure of public and commercial activities except essential services, home quarantine for
suspected cases, contact tracing and isolation of infected individuals were implemented by
the government agencies across the globe.
Active cases on a given day is a very crucial number, which can be used to mitigate
the load on available medical facilities in a country and refine effective public health and
administrative policy. Fig 2 shows active cases for selected countries, South Korea and China
have successfully been able to have control on this number of new cases but in whereas the
number of cases in other countries including India this number is still growing.
For countries like India with its wide geography, dense population, non-uniform public
health infrastructure across its states poses a bigger challenge to handle COVID-19 outbreak.
Gauging these challenges in advance, Indian government took a smart and rapid decision
going for nationwide lockdown which is considered as the globally most stringent measure to
prolong the country’s entry into phase 3; a community transmission mode [6]. This seems to
work quite well for India controlling its volume of infection compared to enormous volumes

2

of infected cases reported for countries like Italy, Spain and USA. However, India still has
some challenges standing ahead like presence of large number of asymptomatic individuals
predicted by its national medical research council, increase in number of tests to be done per
day and per state, reliable antibody diagnostic kits for rapid testing of suspected individuals
infected with COVID-19, requirements of critical health care considering disparity in its
health infrastructure and coordination among various central and state government agencies.
Indian Railways have come up with an innovative approach by converting train coaches into
health care facilities if a situation arises with large volumes of infected cases[7]. Health
ministry in India has launched a mobile application known as Aarogya Setu (Health Bridge)
to track individual health status and currently putting efforts to increase its users [8]. Indias
national medical council has recently launched a pool testing method for RT-PCR diagnosis
to narrow down local areas affected with COVID-19 cases which help in identifying infected
individuals for their immediate isolation [9].
India announced US $2.1 billion aid for the health sector in India to fight the COVID19 situation. The Department of Science and Technology, Government of India has come
up with schemes to promote research and inventions in research institutes and start-ups
working in various domains which will help in controlling the outbreak as the country is
undergoing the lockdown. Indias Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) with
its 38 labs across the country geared up to mitigate the COVID-19 situation with their five
pronged approach [10]. Total 5,79,957 tests (as of April 25, 2020) of samples were carried
out in India as per the report of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) [11]. ICMR
launched nationwide COVID-19 laboratories to test the samples including few private labs
with appropriate safety and health protocols for testing the samples [12]. Recently India
also introduced blood plasma therapy for COVID-19 which aims at using the blood plasma
of recovered individuals who have gained immunity against COVID-19 and transferring it
to infected individuals [13]. Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) has also developed
COVID-19 INDIA map showing geo-spatial data of COVID-19 cases [14]. Defence Research
and Development Organisation (DRDO), India has focussed on making critical care medical
requirements and transferred some of its technologies to private companies for medical supply
during COVID-19 situation [15].
At present, the overall volume of infected numbers in India is definitely less compared to
other countries due to timely announcement of lockdown and considerable efforts by Indian
authorities to impose stringent lockdown. Yet there are challenges lying ahead while the
country is undergoing lockdown and these challenges may get further amplified after the
lockdown is removed (fully or partially) on May 3, 2020.
In this paper, we investigate the current lockdown situation by setting up SusceptibleExposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) epidemiological model applied to ongoing COVID-19
spread in India to forecast the growth of active infected cases. Based on this modelling, we
provide a macro perspective by gauging the situation if lockdown is removed after May 3,
2020. Based on our results we also emphasize on strategies to be taken in order to curb
3

the spread of COVID-19. In the next section, we do a brief review of studies carried out
describing the growth of COVID-19 spread in India.

REVIEW OF COVID-19 PREDICTION STUDIES FOR INDIA

COVID-19 cases in India have been rising rapidly and can create a severe impact on the
country’s healthcare sector and the economy. India reported the first case of COVID-19
on January 30, 2020 in Kerala, a state located in the southern part of the country and the
total number of cases crossed 20,000 on April 21, 2020. Multiple studies involving epidemic
models and other mathematical modelling approaches have been published and reported
in the media. These studies include research publications by researchers, financial/data
consulting firms, independent organizations working in the field of epidemic control. In
this section, we briefly review these studies describing possible scenarios for the COVID-19
outbreak in India.
The Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy (CDDEP), a public health research
institute carrying out independent, multidisciplinary research in the public health sector
to assist in the decision making process for public health policies. CDDEP has given a
prediction for COVID-19 outbreak in India under the model name IndiaSIM [19]. IndiaSIM
model predicted a number of infections for different lockdown strategies in India. Their
model suggests the peak number of infections will be around 1.5 million and 1 million
for no interventions and hard lockdown respectively. It is mentioned that the peak will
occur at the end of June 2020 with hard lockdown and beginning of June 2020 with no
interventions. The IndiaSIM model assumed that the 21-day lockdown would reduce disease
transmission by 25% in moderate lockdown or 44% in hard lockdown conditions. Protiviti, a
global consulting firm has predicted numbers of COVID-19 cases crossing 75,000 by May 22,
2020 [16]. Their study made use of a combination of models such as percentage model, time
series model and SEIR model. Data Driven Innovation Labs from Singapore University of
Technology and Design has also come up with a dashboard called When COVID-19 will end
providing predictive monitoring of COVID-19 cases for multiple countries including India.
Their SEIR based data regressive model predicts that COVID-19 in India will end by June
first week [17].
COVID-19 India (https://www.covid19india.org/) is a data portal providing updated
information on COVID-19 cases in India. Creators of this portal have recently published
their work [18] on the analysis of COVID-19 cases using SIR and eSIR models talking
about timely decisions made by the Indian Government to control the COVID-19 growth.
Paper also discusses the possible scenarios once the lockdown is removed based on different
combinations of control strategies such as lockdown removal with moderate release, travel
ban, social distancing etc. to predict the growth in COVID-19 cases after May 3.
SEIR and regression model based COVID-19 outbreak predictions are given by Ranjan
Gupta et al. in the ref. [cite Ranjan Gupta et al.]. The reproduction number calculated by
them is 2.02. The effect of lockdown and social distancing is estimated using an age structured Susceptible Infected Recovered (SIR) model in Ref. [19]. Their study has obtained the
reproduction number equation to 2.108 and It is found that the most susceptible population

5

is in the age group of 0-50 year whereas the mortality rate will be highest in the age group
50-80 year. Their study also explores the different lockdown strategies predicting increase
in number of cases. Several other studies based on epidemic models are also presented to
give predictions of COVID-19 spread in India [20–22].
We explore the macroscopic perspective based on the SEIR model to understand the scenario of COVID-19 in India, in the background keeping this review of studies for predicting
COVID-19 India dynamics.

DESCRIPTION OF MATHEMATICAL MODEL TO PREDICT THE DY-

NAMICS OF COVID-19

We start with the SEIR model to investigate the spread of COVID-19 in India. Epidemiological models like SEIR provide a useful quantitative approach to understand the
macroscopic picture of the disease spreading. The underlying philosophy is to divide the
population under consideration in compartments of individuals of types susceptible S, exposed E, infected I and recovered R. An individual in the model does the transition from one
compartment to another based on underlying parameters which govern the dynamics of disease spread in the population. In our present work, we avoid to include any heterogeneities
in the context of Indian population and COVID-19 in our model and make an attempt to
understand the dynamics with the basic SEIR model described in this section.
The SEIR model contains an additional parameter, the latent period. During the process
of infection spreading, there is an incubation period during which an individual host is
having a pathogen which is reproducing itself inside the host at a faster rate but yet to reach
an active transmission mode to infect other susceptible hosts in the surroundings. Hence, a
new compartment of exposed individuals E is introduced, which contains individuals who are
infected but yet to become infectious. The SEIR model is an extensively used epidemiological
model based on the work of Kermack and McKendrick [23]. The SEIR model reflects the
dynamics of flow of individuals among four compartmental states; S, E, I and R. The model
is described below using the coupled ordinary differential equations.

where, N is the total population at the start of disease spread. In present work we neglect
general the birth rate and death rate of population. In terms of the parameters already
described above, the Reproduction Number R0 is defined below as
R0 =

β
γ

(6)

Reproduction Number R0 has a central importance in Epidemiology providing transmission
potential of infectious disease and it tells about expected number of new infections transmitted by single infected individuals entered in susceptible populations. The transmission
potential of infectious disease may change over time and thus, R0 may also change over
time. There are several ways to estimate the variation of R0 with time and in this paper
we restrict ourselves to not get into the methods of R0 estimation. Instead, we optimize the
parameters of the SEIR model described above to generate plots for active infected cases
based on the observed data of COVID-19 cases. Continuing with this approach, we also
analyze the effects of lockdown to project the growth of active infected cases during the
lockdown and after it is removed. Based on the SEIR model, we discuss the effectiveness of
control strategies.
The value of R0 for COVID-19 is estimated to be between 2 and 3 [24]. Another approach
of computing R0 involves the processing discrete time series data for active infected cases,
recovered cases and deaths. For advanced analysis, the SEIR model can be further modified
to estimate the effect of various conditions such as quarantine, meta populations and presence
of asymptomatic cases.

DATA ANALYSIS, MODEL FITTING AND RESULTS

The data of confirmed, recovered and death cases due to COVID-19 spread is obtained
from https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19 repository. This data repository for
the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Visual Dashboard is operated by the Johns Hopkins University
Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE). Also, it is supported by ESRI
Living Atlas Team and the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab (JHU APL).
The active infected cases are estimated by subtracting recovered and death cases from the
confirmed cases. Python open source programming is used for analysis and fitting the data.
The SEIR model is fitted with the data to predict the possible active cases in India.
In the case of South Korea, the cumulative curve of COVID-19 cases shows the complete
dynamics with initial exponential growth and then later flattening of the curve. Therefore,
we decided to use the COVID-19 data of South Korea to test the efficiency and feasibility
of our SEIR model and fitting procedure. For fitting our model to South Korea, certain
parameters in the SEIR model like transmission rate, β were optimized during the fitting
procedure. We have used the incubation period of 2 days (γ=0.2) and recovery time as 26
days (σ = 0.0385) for our fitting [25].

FIG. 4. Predicted active infected cases of COVID-19 for India considering varying length of data
(dashed curves). Reported active cases are shown in black solid circles. The first day is on January
30, 2020. Parameters correspond to recovery period and incubation period are γ=0.0385 and a=0.2
respectively.

For optimization of our fit, we have minimized chi-square for varying values of β and
initial susceptible population (N). This helped us to determine pairs of N and β which gave
the best fit to the data for active infected cases.The chi-square is given by the following
equation,
X Oi − Ei
(7)
χ2c =
Ei
where Oi is observation and Ei is modeled/expected value for a given instant. The fitting of
a model is highly dependent on the length of observed data taken into consideration. Fitting
the model for small length of the data especially during the onset of exponential growth,
the number of cases is low compared to expected numbers during the complete dynamics.
Hence, fitting may not be very accurate for a smaller length of the data for any forecasting.
Figure 3, shows fitted (dashed lines) model and observed (solid dots) active cases of South
Korea for varying data length. Note that, predicted values by the model for observed data
till 55 and 89 days converge to similar values and very close to the reported cases, ensuring
confidence in our optimization procedure of the parameters.
After testing our model on South Korea, we then extended it to India. As COVID-19 cases

started emerging in India a bit later in time compared to its onset in other countries, the
COVID-19 outbreak in India is in the growth phase. India has implemented hard lockdown
very early which seems to help in controlling the transmission. To give the projection of
infected active cases based on current lockdown condition and to investigate if the lockdown
is removed on May 3, 2020 how the curve will evolve, we have fitted the SEIR model with
chi-square optimization. First, we fitted the model for varying size of data. Figure 4 shows
the predicted curves from this analysis. The variation in predicted curves due to varying
size of data is evident. However, considering current data of 86 days from its onset in India,
the predicted curve(dashed green line) shows a nice fit to the reported cases. Assuming the
projected trends of 75 and 86 days are more reliable, we observe that peak active infected
cases could reach around 42000-70000 by mid May, 2020 in India.
Moreover, we evaluated the impact of the possible lockdown removal on May 3, 2020
using our model. The β value for the ongoing lockdown period is 0.19, we assumed that the
β could increase after lockdown removal. The β value will change as control measures are
removed either fully or partially [26]. It is difficult to quantify the exact value of beta after
10

lockdown period, therefore, we project possible scenarios for 25% (β=0.23), 50% (β=0.28),
75% (β=0.33), and 100% (β=0.38) increase in the current β value (0.19). Table 1 summarizes
the projected active infected cases if lockdown is continued and different scenarios for postlockdown situations. Figure 5 depicts the curves for different β values forecasting the scenario
after lockdown removal in comparison to the predicted curve for active infected cases (dashed
blue line) based on current data.

V.

DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSION

In our present work, we analyze the observed data of COVID-19 cases in India using the
SEIR model. To start with, we used data of COVID-19 from South Korea showing all the
phases of active infected cases over time to validate our model. Then, we used the chi-square
minimization process to obtain best fitted parameters for South Korea and India. This enabled us to forecast the peak of active infected cases for India. It is found that with respect
to the ongoing lockdown situation in India, the peak of active infected cases will occur in
Mid of May, 2020 with a maximum number of 43,000. Our study shows that the infected
cases will tend to cease by the mid of August, 2020 if lockdown is continued. Interestingly,
our predicted peak time is very much consistent with the predictions made by Protiviti, a
global consulting firm. In our model, we consider different values of beta (other than for
the lockdown condition; β = 0.19) to provide insight on the relative strengths of control
measures taken by the government. Lower the value of beta, indicates a relatively better
strategy to control the spread. The removal of lockdown on May 3, 2020 may lead to ∼ 21
% increase (corresponding value of transmission rate, β = 0.38) in the peak value of active
infected cases as compared to the peak value predicted for ongoing lockdown. This increase
is due to the exposed individuals or asymptomatic individuals who may actively transmit
in post-lockdown period. Therefore, it is highly important to identify such exposed and
asymptomatic individuals in post-lockdown period. Increasing the number of tests for early
identification of COVID-19 cases during the lockdown period will certainly help in understanding the real picture of infected volume. Mobile applications or web GIS applications
integrated with GPS which are capable of tracking regular geo-spatial movements and health
status of individuals can provide useful data [27]. If an individual is found infected, such
applications will help to trace the possible spread of disease in the post-lockdown period.
Indias bold and timely decision going for a nationwide lockdown of 40 days has certainly
helped the country in controlling the infection volume at the cost of adverse socio-economic
impact. Whether full or partial lockdown remains after May 3, severely affected zones
(states/districts/villages/cities) in the country will significantly contribute to the overall
growth of COVID-19 cases in India. Lockdown removal strategies have to be smartly designed which do not allow estimated infected volumes centered around these zones to grow.
Model based forecasts of peak values will certainly help decision makers, especially public
health and administrative departments of the state and central governments to assess their
11

preparedness, control the pandemic and repair the socio-economic damage caused by the
pandemic. Lockdown period is a period not only to control the pandemic but a time bought
to re-design the future national and international policies to ensure the sustainable growth
of the economy.
