A BSTRACT
Italy has been one of the first countries timewise strongly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The adoption of social distancing and heavy lockdown measures is posing a heavy burden on the
population and the economy. The timing of the measures has crucial policy-making implications.
Using publicly available data for the pandemic progression in Italy, we quantitatively assess the
effect of the intervention time on the pandemic expansion, with a methodology that combines a
generalized susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model together with statistical learning
methods. The modeling shows that the lockdown has strongly deviated the pandemic trajectory
in Italy. However, the difference between the forecasts and real data up to 20 April 2020 can be
explained only by the existence of a time lag between the actual issuance date and the full effect of
the measures. To understand the relative importance of intervention with respect to other factors, a
thorough uncertainty quantification of the model predictions is performed. Global sensitivity indices
show that the the time of intervention is 4 times more relevant than quarantine, and eight times more
important than intrinsic features of the pandemic such as protection and infection rates. The relevance
of their interactions is also quantified and studied.

Introduction

The COVID-19 epidemic initially developed in the Chinese region of Wuhan [1] before becoming a pandemic. As
of public records on 21 April 2020, 2,478,634 people have been affected internationally, and more than 26% of the
world population is involved in some form of shelter-in-place or lockdown order. In the public political debate and in
the scientific debate as well, great attention is posed on the effectiveness of intervention measures. Time-wise, Italy
has been one of the first Countries, after China and Iran, significantly hit by the pandemic and then forced to resort to
the implementation of strictly increasing quarantine measures by an exponential increase in the COVID-19 infection.
The situation in Italy up to the first half of March is well described in [2, 3]. Embracing the recommendations of the
scientific experts (see also the considerations in [2] concerning the exponential growth of the epidemic at the beginning
of March 2020), since March 08 and March 09 2020 the local (Lombardy) and national (Italy) governments have
imposed severe containment measures (lockdown, for simplicity, henceforth). The measures have, indeed, impacted
the progression of the epidemic and avoided the exponential growth. On 20 April 2020 Italy counts a total of 181,228
confirmed individuals, with 24,114 deaths and a number of currently infected individuals equal to 108,237.
[4] poses the question of how country-based mitigation measures may influence the course of the COVID-19 epidemic
world wide. We have seen alternative attitudes internationally, with some countries intervening with strict lockdown
measures within a short amount of time since the insurgence of the epidemics, and other adopting a more stage-phased
approach.

Is Time to Intervention in the COVID-19 Outbreak Really Important? A Global Sensitivity Analysis Approach

Questions that emerge are, then, whether the effect of the intervention can be quantitatively observed from the data and
whether its effect is immediate or delayed. In fact, it is natural to expect a time-lag between the moment an intervention
is decided and the time in which it is actually taking in place. A the same time, the intervention time is not be the sole
factor explaining a change in the pandemic time progression. The quarantine, the infection rate, the protection rate, the
average latent time are factors determining an epidemic evolution that are expected to play a role. We then wish to
quantify the relative importance of the intervention time with respect to these other factors.
To answer these questions, we resort to mathematical modelling coupled with global sensitivity analysis. Forecasting
the expansion of the COVID-19 epidemics is subject of intensive research investigation [5, 6]. We investigate the
behavior of the pandemic combining predictions from a generalized SEIR model recently used in [7, 8, 9] to describe
the COVID-19 pandemic in China with machine learning approaches to increase interpretability of the findings [10].
We fit the generalized SEIR model to data of the pandemic in Italy covering the period 24 February to 20 April. We then
run an uncertainty analysis with 1,000,000 Monte Carlo simulations and apply global sensitivity measures to quantify
the relative importance of the factors mentioned above. We employ a replicated finite-difference decomposition method
to study the intensity and sign of factor interactions.

Figure 1: Significance of the intervention time, Italy

Figure 1 shows the following. The graphs represents the dynamic evolution of the pandemic comparing real data
(circles) against the generalized SEIR model forecast (continuous line). The first graph report the results obtained for
the case in which the intervention is modeled as fully active in the first day. We register a poor fit (R2 = 0.3861), with
the forecast largely underestimating the number of totally infected individuals (the root mean squared error (RMSE) is
RM SE = 1.7416 × 104 ). The second graph shows reports the comparison in the case the intervention is assumed
to have effect 1 day later than the official issuance date. We register better fit, confirmed by an increase of R2 from
0.3861 to 0.5726 (the RMSE is now 1.4611 × 104 , with a decrease of 16%). Then, graphs (c) to (f) show the effect
of simulating the intervention with one additional day of delay per graph. Note that by simulating the intervention as
starting 5 days later than the actual issuance date, the fitting performance improves notably. We register R2 = 0.9912
and RM SE = 2.1365 × 103 , with a decrease of 87.73% with respect to graph (a).
Due to the fact that intervention time is not the only factor influencing the forecast, we also tried to tune the forecast by
changing other parameters such as I0 and δ and combinations, while leaving the intervention time at the issuance date.
Our search did not lead to satisfactory results, signaling the intervention time as the main source of discrepancy. To
confirm the relevance of the intervention time, we performed further analyses via global sensitivity measures.

Figure 2: Empirical density under uncertainty on 20 April in Italy; Blue lines are 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles; Red
lines are actual confirmed cases.
Uncertainty quantification Figure 2 displays the empirical density function for the SIER model forecast of the total
number of infected individuals on April 20th, 56 days after the data collection start. The empirical density is skewed,
with a mean of 1.7769 × 105 individuals, standard deviation of 9.0035 × 104 , 95 upper quantile on 3.5032 × 105 . Thus,
the model foresees an expected number of infected individuals between 0.6216 × 105 and 3.9163 × 105 , which is
consistent with actual data (red vertical line). The empirical density is computed on a sample of 1,000,000 realizations
of the forecasts of total infected individuals. Uncertainty in the model predictions is the result of uncertainty in six
factors acting as parameters of the generalized SEIR model: protection rate (α), infection rate (β), average latent time
(γ −1 ), average quarantine rate (δ), the number of initial infected people (I0 ) and the intervention time (Interv.). The
distributions are discussed in Section 4. From these distributions uncertainty is propagated in the model through Monte
Carlo simulation.
Factor Importance From the previous Monte Carlo sample, we have calculated global sensitivity measures that
determine quantitatively the relative importance of the inputs [See Supplementary Appendix A]. Figure 3 shows the
results.

Sensitivity Measure
Figure 3: Importance of the six factors according to 3 sensitivity measures.
Figure 3 shows that time to intervention (Interv.) is the key-driver in the variability of model predictions according to all
the sensitivity measures used, i.e., variance-based total indices (Ti ), first order indices (Si ) and the distribution-based
sensitivity measure (β Ku ) (see the supplementary quantitative appendix A for further details on the definition of these
indices and the motivation for their simultaneous utilization.) It is followed by quarantine rate, number of initially
infected individuals (I0 ) and infection rate (β). On a relative scale time to intervention is (depending on the sensitivity

measure) 4.70 to 6.18 times more important than the quarantine rate. In turn, the quarantine rate is 1.50 to 2.20 times
more important than the initial number of affected individuals, which, in turn, is 1.30 to 1.60 times more important than
the infection rate. Protection rate, infection rate and average latent time play an even minor role.
Direction of influence Figure 4 displays the conditional regression plots estimated from a subsample of size 500,000.

Figure 4: The conditional regression plots
Figure 4 shows the following. Each of the variables has a separately monotonic effect on the output. For instance,
the expected total number of infected individuals is linearly and monotonically decreasing in the protection rate (α).
Similarly, we expect a decrease associated with an increase in latent time and quarantine rate, but an increase associated
with infection rate (β), in the number of initially infected individuals (I0 ) and with the time of intervention (Interv.).
These qualitative results are in accordance with intuition. The only difference is that the conditional regression function
shows a (still decreasing) non-linear behaviour for the total number of infected individuals as a function of the quarantine
rate. The last graph can be used to obtain a quantitative indication: when the intervention time is delayed by 7 days, the
median total number of infected people would be expected to increase by around 300%. [This increase is calculated by
comparing the median conditional on the intervention being effective on March 09 2020 to the median conditional the
intervention being effective on March 16 2020.]
Interaction Quantification Figure 5 displays the magnitude of the interaction effects among the factors. The highest
recorded interactions (the first six bars are individual effects) are among δ, I0 and the intervention time, namely the
three most important factors. In terms of overall relevance, interaction effects account for less than 8% of the variance
of the affected individuals. The mean dimension is 1.1683 (see Appendix A for the mathematical definitions). This
means interactions have a low overall effect, although the effect is not entirely negligible. In fact, the highest interaction
(between intervention time and δ) is 17.86% of the highest individual effect. Aside this interaction, we register a
non-negligible interaction between intervention time and initial number of infected individuals (I0 ). Note that these
three factors are also the ones identified as most influential by the global sensitivity measures.

Discussion

We have made inference on publicly available data of the COVID-19 pandemics in Italy through application of a SEIR
model and the use of statistical techniques for sensitivity analysis. The investigation has evidenced a time-lag between
the moment interventions have been issued and the moment in which their effect has actually taken place changing the
pandemic path. Indeed this result seem to reflect a physical mechanism. While shelter-in-place measures are officially
established on a given date, it is unlikely that they have an immediate effect. For instance, individuals might not be able
to interrupt all contacts immediately, they do not have instantaneous access to masks or other protecting equipment.
Moreover, some activities cannot shutdown immediately due to technical reasons, and certain industrial compartments
have to remain open to keep delivering essential services to the population.
Our results have both policy-making and modeling implications. From a policy making viewpoint, global sensitivity
measures indicate that the first two most important factors are the intervention time and the quarantine rate. These two

Interactions in increasing order

6). The first six bars concern the individual factor effects, the next 15 represent the average magnitudes of the second

factors relate to social distancing measures. Not only, but combined with the results of the time to intervention analysis,
the findings indicate that the earlier intervention measures are introduced, but also the more rapidly (strongly) they can
be implemented, the more effective they are in flattening the pandemic curve.
From a modeling viewpoint, the strong impact of the intervention time suggests indeed that this variable needs to be
taken into account to increase the prediction accuracy of SEIR models.
Regarding limitations of the present analysis, further work can be done to determine the distributions of the factors
more precisely and, potentially, to include statistical correlations among the factors. Also, the analysis has been focused
on the total number of infected individuals at 56 days from the initial observations. However, the analysis can also be
made time dependent, varying the final time (e.g., using an analysis at 50 days or at 100 days). Of course, the longer the
time horizon, the larger the uncertainty in the forecast we expect. Also, we have chosen one specification of the SEIR
models and alternative specifications may be used.
The paper moves in the direction advocated by [10]. The uncertainty quantification is directly applicable to other
SIER models and/or even to other type of models used to forecast or study the COVID-19 pandemics. Also, while we
have analyzed data from Italy, the analysis can be replicated with data coming from other Countries and regions. The
approach yields coherent insights not only regarding the most important inputs but also about the role of interactions
and direction of change. This enriches the spectrum of insights gained from the model and the data with respect to
current practice, with analyses that are limited only to varying one factor at a time. The analysis helps modelers in
understanding key-factors of uncertainty increasing transparency. Collecting information on these factors might reduce
uncertainty in the forecasts improving modelling efficacy and helping result communications to the public (see the
recent critique in [14]).

Methods

We consider a representative of the SEIR family of models. These models are a cornerstone in epidemiological studies
[11, 12] and have been used in the very recent studies of [7, 8] regarding the COVID-19 pandemics. We consider
the version used to simulate the COVID-19 outbreak in China in the work of [9]. This generalization allows a new
quarantined state that includes the effect of soft measures before lockdown. In total, the following seven different states
are considered: susceptible S(t), insusceptible P (t), exposed (but not yet infectious) E(t), infectious I(t), quarantined
Q(t), recovered R(t), deceased D(t).

The model includes the following parameters: i) protection rate: α; ii) infection rate, β; iii) average latent time: γ −1 ;
iv) average quarantine rate: δ; v) time-dependent cure rate coefficients: λ0 and λ1 (the time dependent cure rate is
written as by λ (t) = λ0 (1 − exp (−λ1 t))); vi) time-dependent mortality rate coefficients: κ0 and κ1 (the mortality
rate curve is written as κ (t) = κ0 exp (−κ1 t)). For simplicity, the birth and natural death processes are not considered
so that a constant population is assumed. The above model has been implemented in M ATLAB [13] and can be openly
accessed at https://github.com/ECheynet/SEIR.
Data Collection and Model Fitting We collected data from Italy’s the Department of Civil Protection publicly
available repository https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19.
Figure 6 displays the number of total, quarantined, recovered, deceased individuals as a function of time, as per the
publicly available data from 24 February till 20 April. The vertical lines display the dates of 09 March 2020, at which
the lockdown measures were officially deployed. Fitting the generalized SEIR model discussed above on the data from
24 February to 08 March (13 days) for Italy, we obtain the pre-lockdown parameter estimates. Then, fitting the same
model on the data from 09 March to 20 April (42 days), we obtain the after-lockdown parameter estimates reported in
Table 1.

Figure 7: Model fitting before/after intervention, points are real data, lines are fitted.

Figure 7 displays the total number of infected individuals calculated by the fitted models (continuous lines) against the
real observations (circles). In terms of fitting performance, we register an average coefficient of determination (R2 )
over the quarantined, recovered and deceased cases equals to 0.9542 in the pre-intervention period, and R2 = 0.9980
in the after-intervention period.
Uncertainty quantification To further understand the results, we have let the model undergo an uncertainty quantification in order to be able to compute global sensitivity measures. We used the parameter distribution assignments
displayed in Table 2 (see also [9]) and generated a random Monte Carlo sample of size N = 1, 000, 000.
Table 2: Uncertainty quantification: the after lockdown parametric values of α, β, (γ)−1 and δ are assigned distributions
as per the data of [9]. The intervention time is assumed to be a uniformly distributed random variable in a one-week
range after the actual issuance date. Independence is assumed.

From this sample, we have quantified the uncertainty about the forecasted number of infected individuals in Italy from
24 February to 20 April (56 days). Also, we have calculated importance indices that go under the name of global
sensitivity measures to determine the quantitatively the relative importance of the inputs [See Supplementary Appendix
A]. Specifically, we have used the first and total order global sensitivity measures based on variance contribution and
a sensitivity measures based on the distance between cumulative distribution functions. The rationale of the choice
is as follows. Regarding importance, the total order as well as the distribution-based sensitivity measure possess the
properties that they are null if and only if the model output is probabilistically independent of the input of interest. Thus,
their null value reassures us that the input is, indeed, not influential. Regarding interaction quantification, the difference
between the first and the total order indices provides information about the relevance of interactions, giving insights on
whether a factor’s influence is due to its individual action or due to interactions with other factors. This insight, however,
is an overall insight and does not reveal which interactions (if any) are important. Towards this understanding we use a
sample of size 20,000, replicating a full factorial design and decomposing the output changes via a finite difference
operation (see Appendix A fpor further details). The scheme allows us to compute a total of 20,000 first order effects
for each input, 20,000 second order interaction indices for all pairs, and 20,000 interaction indices of order 3, 4, and 5
and 6, enabling interactions to be thoroughly studied.
From the original sample, we also computed conditional regression curves. These curves express the expected number
of infected individuals as a function of each of the uncertain parameters. The graphs lead information about whether the
increase in a parameter leads to an increase (decrease) of the number of infected individuals.

A.1

Sensitivity Measures: a Concise Overview

For broad overviews on sensitivity analysis, we refer the reader to [15, 17]. We concisely overview the methods used
here. Let y = g(x), where g : X → R is a multivariate input-output mapping, x = (x1 , x2 , ..., xn ) be the vector
of the model inputs, with x ∈ X and y the output of interest. Let also (X , B(X ), P) be the measure space of the
model inputs and let x0 , x1 ,..., xk ,xk+1 ,..., xN be a collection of points in X sampled from the input probability
measure. Let y 0 = g(x0 ), y 1 = g(x1 ),...,y N = g(xN ) be the corresponding values of the model the output. Then, let
∆y k = y k+1 − y k denote the variation in the model output registered with the inputs shift from xk to xk+1 . We then
have a sequence of finite changes ∆y k , k = 0, 1, 2, ..., N − 1. We can decompose each change in 2n effects, writing:

the total order indices equals the mean dimension of g in the superimposition sense.

There is a bridge between finite change sensitivity indices φk→k+1
and the total index Ti2 . In fact, let Φi denote the

random variable whose realizations are the φi

[25], we get

That is, by calculating the variance of the available first order effects and halving we obtain an estimate of the total
order indices for each input. These estimates, compared with estimates of the first order indices provides information

on how much each input is involved in interaction with the remaning ones. In particular, we note the notion of
mean effective dimension provides a quantitative indication about the relevance of interactions. This notion has been
Vi,j,...,r
introduced in [26, 22]. The intuition is as follows. The terms Si,j,...,r =
are positive and sum to unity. Thus,

they can be regarded as forming a probability mass function. Actually, they place a mass on the random variable T
whose realizations all the possible combinations of indices. Then, one defines the dimension distribution of g in the
superimposition sense as the distribution of the cardinality of |T |. The mean dimension is then [22]:
Dg =

respectively. A mean effective dimension in the superimposition sense equal to unity indicates the absence of interactions.
Pn
[22] also proves that the mean effective dimension is equal to the sum of total effects. That is, we have: Dg = i=1 Ti .
We recall that first order variance-based sensitivity measures fall in the so-called common rationale of global sensitivity
measures [27]. That is, they are sensitivity measures of the type
ξi = E[d(PY , PY |Xi )],

(9)

where d(·, ·) is a distance or divergence between distributions, PY is the marginal probability measure of Y and PY |Xi
is the conditional probability measure of Y given Xi . Depending on the choice of d(·, ·), one obtains alternative
ways of measuring importance. To illustrate, let FY and FY |Xi denote the cumulative distribution function of Y and
the conditional distribution function of Y given Xi . Selecting the Kuiper distance between cumulative distributions
functions, we get [28]
βiKu = E[sup{FY |Xi (y) − FY (y)} + sup{FY (y) − FY |Xi (y)}].
y

y

We note that a null value of Ti and βiKu indicates that Y is independent of Xi . First order variance-based sensitivity
measure (Si ) do not possess this property and their null value is not necessarily a signal of the fact that Y does not
depend on Xi . However, first order variance-based sensitivity measures remain well defined when inputs are dependent,
similarly to βiKu , while problems associated with the interpretation of Ti arise.

Estimation

The selected sensitivity measures for our calculations are the first order main effects φk→k+1
, the higher order

computed at randomized locations. The implementation of the decomposition in eqs. (1) and
(2) is implemented in the surboutine finitechanges.m, which is available at https://github.com/LuXuefei/
FiniteChanges. Then, such decomposition is performed at N randomized locations appropriately generated through
random Monte Carlo generation implemented in the code rand.m and randsample.m, available at M ATLAB.
From the randomized first order effects φk→k+1

The estimation of the sensitivity measures Si and βiKu is based on the so-called given data approach. We refer to [29]
and [27] for a detailed treatment. We just recall the key intuition here. Let Xi a subset of the reals that represents the
m

support of model input xi . Then, consider a partition of Xi into M bins, such that ∪M
m=1 Xi = Xi and Xi ∩ Xi = ∅
for r, m = 1, 2, ..., M , r 6= m. The intuition of a given-data estimation is then that of substituting the condition Xi = xi
(that is Xi is exactly at xi ) with the bin condition Xi ∈ Xim . Intuitively, this condition asks that Xi is in a suitably
defined interval around xi . With this intuition, one obtaines the estimate
ξbi =

M

pm,i d(FbY , FbY |Xi ∈Xim ),

(12)

m=1

where pm,i is equal to the probability that Xi belongs to bin Xim , and where FbY and FbY |Xi ∈Xim are the marginal
empirical distribution function of Y and the conditional empirical distribution function given that Xi ∈ Xim . Then,
one links the partition size (M) to the sample size (N ), so that as N increases the parition size tends to zero and the
limiting partition is Xi itself. [27] prove that, under mild assumptions, (the continuity of the operator d(·, ·) in both its

arguments and the Riemann-Stieltjes integrability of d(FY , FY |Xi )), ξbi converges to ξi as the sample size increases;
that is, ξbi is an asymptotically consistent estimator of ξi .
These calculations are implemented in the subroutine betaKS3.m. Finally, the conditional regression functions
ri (xi ) = E[Y |Xi = xi ] have been estimated using the subroutine cosi.m. Both subroutines are developed by Elmar
Plischke and available at https://zenodo.org/record/885332#.XpnB44gzZGM (see [30] and [31] for details).
