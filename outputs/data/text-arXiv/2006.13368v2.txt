Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has affected travel behaviors and transportation system operations, and
cities are grappling with what policies can be effective for a phased reopening shaped by social
distancing. A baseline model was previously developed and calibrated for pre-COVID conditions
as MATSim-NYC. A new COVID model is calibrated that represents travel behavior during the
COVID-19 pandemic by recalibrating the population agendas to include work-from-home and reestimating the mode choice model for MATSim-NYC to fit observed traffic and transit ridership
data. Assuming the change in behavior exhibits inertia during reopening, we analyze the increase
in car traffic due to the phased reopen plan guided by the state government of New York. Four
reopening phases and two reopening scenarios (with and without transit capacity restrictions) are
analyzed. A Phase 4 reopening with 100% transit capacity may only see as much as 73% of preCOVID ridership and an increase in the number of car trips by as much as 142% of pre-pandemic
levels. Limiting transit capacity to 50% would decrease transit ridership further from 73% to 64%
while increasing car trips to as much as 143% of pre-pandemic levels. While the increase appears
small, the impact on consumer surplus is disproportionately large due to already increased traffic
congestion. Many of the trips also get shifted to other modes like micromobility. The findings
imply that a transit capacity restriction policy during reopening needs to be accompanied by (1)
support for micromobility modes, particularly in non-Manhattan boroughs, and (2) congestion
alleviation policies that focus on reducing traffic in Manhattan, such as cordon-based pricing.

1. Introduction
When a pandemic spread to a large population, response strategies to “flatten the curve” of the
spread may require parts of society to “stay at home” and to maintain social distancing (Thunström
et al., 2020; Cohen and Kupferschmidt, 2020). In the case of COVID-19, the “stay-at-home” order
and implications of social distancing measures have shut down many public services, retail
businesses and tourism activities. These have profoundly impacted the economic activities in many
cities around the world which in turn have deeply changed people’s travel behavior. For example,
data reveal that people have become more afraid to take public transit or other shared modes and
avoid gathering in crowded areas (Pakpour and Griffiths, 2020). As a community reopens, the
changed behavior may exhibit inertia (Ghader et al., 2020; Shadmehr and de Mesquita, 2020; Liu
et al., 2017; Alós-Ferrer et al., 2016; Cherchi et al., 2014; Xie et al., 2014; Srinivasan and
Mahmassani, 2000; Chorus and Dellaert, 2009), where travelers continue to behave according to
the stay-at-home setting due to residual fears.
In addition to behavior, the spread of COVID-19 has raised new challenges for public
transportation systems (Bóta et al., 2017; Hajdu et al., 2019; El Shoghri et al., 2019; Qian et al.,
2020; Mo et al., 2020; Shoghri et al., 2020), especially for transit agencies in New York City
(NYC), as it is one of the hardest-hit cities in the world. Many of these challenges deal with how
the pandemic might spread through the transit systems, although empirical studies find little
evidence of tracing outbreaks to transit services (Sadik-Khan and Solomonow, 2020).
With the need for social distancing and the added residual fears, another challenge exists in
the case of reopening. As public transport is designed to mobilize people through shared usage and
benefits dense populations the most, the pandemic has presented an existential crisis to such
systems. Some cities are implementing strategies that limit the number of passengers on vehicles
to keep riders and workers safe. For instance, the subway system in Beijing, China, limits the
subway occupancy below 50% of its maximum capacity around February 2020 (XinhuaNet, 2020).
In New Jersey (NJ), NJ Transit trains and buses was ordered to cut capacity to 50% until July 15,
2020 to maintain social distancing (NJ TRANSIT, 2020).
Policymakers need to carefully balance between encouraging dense operations and social
distancing practices especially as sectors of the economy are reopened considering traveler
behavioral inertia. Research questions arising from this pandemic include:
• How does the pandemic impact people’s travel behavior during the pandemic?
• If there is indeed inertia in the impacted travel behavior, how would it play a role in the
public transportation operations and road traffic in a re-opened state?
• How should public transportation systems, conventionally designed to encourage
densification, operate in a reopened state that requires de-densification of the public?
With a shift away from public transit, there is a key concern that a bigger burden will be placed
upon road traffic when cities reopen. A travel demand model is needed to answer these questions
for NYC. As the “stay-at-home” order requires different proportions of industries to work from
home (WFH), such a model needs to be sensitive to employment industries of commuters during
the COVID-19 period. In addition, the model needs to be sensitive to different transit schedules
and capacities as it changes from pre-pandemic through different reopening stages of COVID-19
(Burke, 2020).
Agent-based simulation models are effective in capturing the interactions between agents and
transportation system to output the equilibrated simulation results at the agent level. Hackl and
Dubernet (2019) developed a disease propagation model in MATSim to simulate epidemic
2

outbreaks. The results show that even with simple assumptions, the agent-based model could give
a good approximation compared to the observed data. However, as far as we know, no research in
the literature have used the agent-based traffic simulation model to study the impact of the
epidemic/pandemic disease on people’s travel behaviors and mode share as well as its ability to
test different transport system operating policies for decision-makers.
A synthetic population was developed for NYC (He et al., 2020a, Chow et al., 2020) for the
8M+ population in NYC that includes NAICS (North American Industry Classification System1)
employment industries. Based on the synthetic population along with calibrated transit schedules,
a multi-agent simulation (Horni et al., 2016) model, MATSim-NYC (He et al., 2020b, Chow et al.,
2020) was developed by C2SMART researchers for NYC (Figure 1).

We propose to re-calibrate the MATSim-NYC model using ridership and WFH data during
the COVID-19 stay-at-home period to update the mode choice utility functions for the synthetic
population. The WFH data is obtained for different employment industries from a study by Dingel
and Neiman (2020). The recalibrated model (which we call the MATSim-NYC-COVID model)
can capture the effect of COVID-19 on shifts in mode preferences from users. Using this
recalibrated model, we then compare the re-opening scenarios where the population is assumed to
continue to exhibit the same mode preferences. Two reopening scenarios (with and without transit
capacity restrictions) are analyzed to forecast the impacts on transit mode share and road traffic.
The unique contributions of this study include: (1) evaluating the sensitivity of road traffic to
WFH policy for different employment industries; (2) insights to the mode choice behavioral effect
of COVID-19 on NYC residents; (3) quantifying the impacts of the mode choice inertia on transit
ridership and road traffic; and (4) evaluating the impact of a 50% capacity restriction on transit
ridership. The developed model will also be useful for comparing different reopening plans.
The remainder of the study is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the data
used, the existing MATSim-NYC model, and scenarios defined for this study. Section 3 describes
the recalibrated model under COVID-19 and its validation and analysis. Section 4 presents the
analysis of different transit capacity restriction under different reopening phases as proposed by
New York State (New York State, 2020).

2. Data and scenarios
This section provides the synthetic population data and MATSim model data used for building the
simulation model, as well as the relevant details of the MATSim-NYC model. MTA transit
ridership data (MTA, 2020) and Apple mobility trends report data (Apple, 2020) are used to
calibrate and validate the COVID model. We also introduce the existing MATSim-NYC model
and the scenarios that will be tested in this study.
2.1. Data
Synthetic Population data and MATSim model data
The American Community Survey, 2016 Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD),
and 2040 Socioeconomic and Demographic Forecasts (SED) were used to generate personal and
household attributes of the synthetic population (Chow et al., 2020). The 2010/2011 Regional
Household Travel Survey (RHTS) data was employed to prepare travel agendas and model mode
choice. To incorporate emerging modes (bike-sharing and ride-hailing), 2016 trip count data of
Citi Bike and For-Hire-Vehicles (FHV) were also adopted. The 2017 Citywide Mobility Survey
data was used to validate the city-level mode share of the synthetic population.
The input network was developed with a road network transformed from OpenStreetMap
(OSM) data and a transit network and schedule generated from General Transit Feed Specification
(GTFS) data. INRIX speed data and the 2016 New York City Bridge Traffic Volumes data were
used to calibrate the road network’s link speeds and capacities.
MTA Turnstile Data and Apple Mobility Trends Report
Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), the largest public transit authority in the US,
typically carries over 11 million transit riders on an average weekday. Its bridges and tunnels serve
more than 800,000 vehicles each weekday and carry more traffic than any other bridge and tunnel
authority in the nation. The implementation of the stay-at-home order on March 2020 has an
immediate impact on the transit ridership and traffic volume in NYC. During COVID-19, both
subway ridership and vehicular traffic on MTA facilities show steep declines. The decline rates
reached up to 92% in peak transit ridership as the week of April 6, 2020 to April 12, 2020, and up
to 69% in vehicle traffic through MTA bridges and tunnels at the same time, compared to the same
date/week in 2019.
This data was supplemented by the Apple Mobility Trends report that reflects requests for
directions in Apple Maps. According to the daily data posted on April 18, 2020, the trips by transit,
driving and walking have decreased 88%, 54%, 76%, respectively. Table 1 shows the weekly
changes of the traffic data during the COVID period according to the MTA data and Apple
mobility trends report. The average trip reduction data from March 23, 2020 to April 19, 2020 was
used to calibrate the COVID model.
2.2. MATSim-NYC
MATSim is an open-source framework for implementing large-scale agent-based traffic
simulations (Horni et al., 2016). The MATSim platform can simulate a large-scale transport on a
per-agent timestep-based level. The model is initialized with agents in the synthetic population
and each agent has an initial plan during the simulated day. Those plans consist two elements: one
is a set of activities, where each activity has a location with start/end time, e.g. “home” and “work”
are two common activities that usually exist in agent’s plan. The second element is the “Leg”
4

which provides the connections between two activities via a mode of transport (e.g. “car”, “transit”,
“walk”), the route taken, etc.

There are three components in MATSim: execution, re-planning and scoring (Balmer, 2007;
Horni et al., 2016). The objective of MATSim is to optimize the daily plans for each agent by
iteratively running the three components day by day (e.g., 100 iterations indicate 100 days of
updated daily plans). In the execution module, all agents choose one plan and execute their chosen
plan. The scoring module uses a utility function to evaluate the performance of each agent’s plan
in the execution module. The re-planning module adjusts the plan elements (e.g., departure time,
traffic mode) according to the plan score and adapts the plans to the traffic condition. Figure 2
shows the modeling framework used in MATSim.

Figure 2. Modeling Framework.
A synthetic population of NYC was created which incorporates the demographic information
and travel patterns of 8.24 million people for the base year of 2016 of the city. This results in
30,991,820 average daily trips made by the synthetic population. For this synthetic population, a
tour-based nested logit model was estimated for Manhattan and non-Manhattan population
segments.
The modes Driving Alone, Carpool, Public Transit, Taxi, Bike, and Walk were estimated from
the Regional Household Travel Survey. For-Hire Vehicles (FHV) and Citi Bike were calibrated to
have cost and travel time coefficients similar to Taxi and Bike, respectively, with the alternative
5

specific constants (ASCs) fitted to have the model outputs match the corresponding trip count data
in 2016. Those modes were further estimated using the choice of a separately estimated
smartphone ownership model as a feature for Citi Bike and as a condition for alternative
availability for FHV. The validation of the model was conducted using the 2017 Citywide Mobility
Survey provided by New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) and shown to be a
good fit.
Since MATSim’s mode utility functions are assumed to follow a flat multinomial logit (MNL)
structure as opposed to nested structures, the estimated mode choice model was converted into an
equivalent trip-based MNL structure. The parameters (alternative specific constant and cost) of the
driving nest were multiplied by the nest scale factor and adopted as the approximate parameters in
the equivalent trip-based MNL model (He et al., 2020; Chow et al., 2020). The travel time
parameter of driving mode was set to be zero according to the MATSim guidebook (Nagel et al.,
2016). Mode choice utility function parameters (Chow et al., 2020) are shown in Table 2. These
values represent the pre-COVID mode choice behavior.

For the network topology, the base topology was converted into a network in MATSim from
Open Street Map (OSM) and a transit network generated from General Transit Feed Specification
(GTFS) data. For computation efficiency, the population in the simulation is scaled to 4% of the
real population (by comparison, MATSim models in other cities like Zurich typically use a 10%
scaled population). The road network is shown in Figure 3(left), while the green layer in Figure 3
(right) shows the transit network.
INRIX data were used to calibrate unsaturated road speeds while the bridge crossing average
annual daily traffic (AADT) data were used to calibrate the road capacities (see Chow et al., 2020).
The validation of the MATSim-NYC trip assignment was conducted by comparing the outputs to
two data sets: ten stations from the 2016 Average Weekday Subway Ridership data and fifteen
traffic locations from the 2014-2018 Traffic Volume Counts data. The difference in daily ridership
among the ten stations is 8%, while the median difference in the traffic volumes among the traffic
sites is 29% (Chow et al., 2020).

2.3. Scenarios
This is not the first time that a public health crisis that has widely impact the traffic system,
especially put the transit system in turmoil. The SARS epidemic in 2003 that first spread in China
caused more than 50% of transit ridership reduction in major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and
Hong Kong. It took about a year for urban transit ridership to recover after the epidemic. In
addition, as many cities gradually reopen after the COVID-19 pandemic, there are many strategies
and lessons that we can learn during the outbreak and through recovery.
The public transit agency in Beijing, China, published their two-phase reopening plan (Pei,
2020). In phase one, businesses reopen but schools remain closed. The predicted commute traffic
returns to normal, but decreased secondary traffic (i.e. shopping, leisure activity) leads to a
maximum transit ridership that is only 50% of the normal condition. In phase two, all the
businesses and schools reopen, with all commute traffic returning to normal, but still with
decreased secondary traffic, leading to a predicted maximum ridership of 75% of the normal
setting. The data shows a 20% and 40% restoration of subway ridership one and two months after
reopening in Beijing. In Shanghai and Guangzhou, an average rate of 40% and 63% of ridership
were restored after 1 month and 2 months of reopening, compared to the pre-COVID period,
respectively (Gao et al., 2020).
A mode shift towards walking and cycling was observed after the city reopened in China.
According to a survey conducted by the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy
(ITDP, 2020) in early March 2020 in Guangzhou, China, 40% of previous transit commuters
shifted to private cars, taxis, and ride-hailing, with more to walking and biking. The bike share
systems in Beijing (China) saw an increase in usage by 150% from February 10 to March 4, 2020,
one month after reopening. Continued monitoring of the mode shift and repositioning of transit
services with new health standards can provide insight during the anticipated upcoming recovery
period in NYC.
In many cities, transit ridership has rebounded during reopening, but is still lower than before
the pandemic. Ridership on the Tokyo Metro dropped by 60% in April 2020 during the lockdown
period and reached 63% of normal levels by August after reopening (Sam Schwartz, 2020).
Ridership on the Paris metro system dropped to just 5% of pre-pandemic rates by April 2020 and
7

by late June 2020 recovered to 55% of pre-pandemic rates (Sam Schwartz, 2020). Transit ridership
remains far below pre-COVID levels, but car traffic has roared back. Even with more people
working from home after the outbreak of COVID-19, INRIX has reported that VMT across the
United States surpassed 100% of normalized VMT in July 2020 (Markezich, 2020).
To ensure social distancing, some cities have reduced vehicle capacity for public transit during
the shutdown and reopening periods. For example, the Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris
County (METRO), Texas, reduced seating by 50% by tagging seats as unavailable during the
shutdown and the reopening as of July 2020. When buses reach capacity, digital signs advise
individuals to wait for the next bus (Houston Metro, 2020). New Jersey Transit Corporation (NJ
TRANSIT) was ordered to cut capacity to 50% until July 15, 2020, when the state entered
reopening stage 2, after which full-capacity operations resumed (NJ TRANSIT, 2020). Despite the
losses in efficiency, this can be a feasible solution to reduce contact risk and encourage people to
use transit.
To study the different strategies under the reopening scenarios, the following scenarios (10
scenarios in total) are examined:
• Pre-COVID-19 scenario (Jan 2020): we use the calibrated MATSim-NYC model
updated with January 2020 transit schedules.
• During COVID-19 scenario (Mar 2020): we use the MATSim-NYC-COVID model
that was recalibrated using the mobility data during COVID stay-at-home period in NYC.
• Reopening Phase 1 – 4 without transit capacity restrictions (4 scenarios): the
recalibrated MATSim-NYC-COVID model is used with modifications to the WFH
proportions according to the NY State plan. No transit capacity restriction is applied.
• Reopening Phase 1 – 4 with transit capacity restrictions (4 scenarios): a lower transit
occupancy is enforced in these scenarios. A 50% transit capacity restriction is applied to
forecast both the impact on transit ridership as well as the road traffic.

3. Proposed MATSim-NYC-COVID model
3.1 Agenda recalibration
The COVID model requires recalibrating the mode choice model to fit the new behavioral setting.
The new model is based on COVID WFH agendas, and the mode choice models are then
recalibrated to fit the trip reduction data in Table 1.
Determining the work-from-home rate is crucial in the COVID model development. Using
NAICS codes consistent with the employment industries in the synthetic population, the workfrom-home rates for all occupations can be computed (Dingel and Neiman, 2020). Table 3 shows
the classification of teleworkable employment for different industries resulting in the proportions.
The reopening proportions are obtained from New York State and discussed further in Section 4.
A new synthetic population was developed based on randomly re-assigned individuals to
WFH based on the proportions for each industry. A 44% overall WFH rate was estimated for this
newly synthesized population, which is very close to the result (42%) from Dingel and Neiman
(2020). In addition, all school/university and secondary trips are assumed to remain closed in this
period. Figure 4 shows the total number of workers who are not work-from-home for each traffic
analysis zone (TAZ) in the Pre-COVID setting (left) and the COVID setting (right).

and COVID model (right).
The road network in COVID model is kept the same as the Pre-COVID model. The transit
schedule during COVID period is generated from the GTFS data from March 20, 2020.
3.2 Mode choice model calibration
With the newly recalibrated population that accounts for WFH, we recalibrated the mode choice
utility functions based on the ridership reduction data shown in Table 1. Four mode parameters
9

were updated and calibrated, namely the ASC values for transit, driving, walking, and biking. As
shown in Table 2, those parameters were originally 2.95, −0.06, 5.73, and 0.44, for Manhattan
population and 0.76, −0.05, 3.49, and −1.35 for the non-Manhattan population, respectively.
The calibration approach is based on the SPSA algorithm (Spall, 1988, 1998a, 199b), which
uses random perturbations from a current point to measure the gradient across multiple dimensions
cheaply. The procedure can be summarized as following: with the input data and initial parameters,
we run the simulation and compare the results with observed data and calculate the predefined loss
function as the simulation error. If the resulting simulation error is found to be acceptable, we
terminate the calibration process. Otherwise, the parameters are updated using SPSA algorithm
and then re-run the simulation until the accuracy is satisfied. A similar calibration method for
simulation models can be found in our MATSim-NYC model (Chow et al. (2020)). In this study,
the stopping criterion is set as an average absolute difference in trip reduction lower than 0.1,
including subway, car, and walking, which converged after 15 iterations.
The new ASCs under COVID are shown in Table 4. The first number refers to the updated
ASC (e.g. 1.95 for transit for Manhattan) while the second number in parenthesis refers to the
absolute change from the original parameter (e.g. -1.00 is a reduction from an original of 2.95 for
transit for Manhattan).
The ASCs of the COVID model show that the mode preference for driving increased
dramatically compared to pre-COVID setting while the preference for public transit decreased. In
the Pre-COVID model, travelers in Manhattan have a much higher preference of using transit than
other regions, but the decrease of transit preference in Manhattan is more significant than other
boroughs in the COVID model. The mode preference of car increased more in the Non-Manhattan
boroughs compared to Manhattan, likely because Manhattan has lower car ownership compared
to other boroughs.

Table 5 shows the comparison of the ridership reduction and the reference data (Table 1) along
with the percentage point difference (p.p. difference). The simulation results show that trip
reductions during the pandemic for subway, car, and walking are 91%, 76%, and 68%, respectively,
compared to observed reductions of 89%, 58%, and 76%. The differences are likely from a
combination of different factors. MATSim-NYC was built assuming bus and subway have the
same utility parameters, and there are still secondary trips being made during the stay at home
order, many of which are probably by car (to purchase home supplies and groceries, for example).

3.3 Validation of the MATSIM-NYC-COVID model
To validate the simulation, the subway station entrance data from MTA is used to compare with
the results from our baseline models. Table 6 shows a comparison of some of the most popular
stations in NYC. The nine busiest stations with reliable data during COVID-19 are selected out of
472 stations, where the ridership among this subset makes up nearly 15% of the total daily subway
ridership in NYC as a sufficient sample. The MTA subway daily ridership data in 2019 is used to
compare with the Pre-COVID model. The daily average entrance data was collected from MTA
turnstile dataset during March 23, 2020 to April 12, 2020.
Most of the stations have close predictions to the observations. The higher deviations in
ridership of 34 St - Herald Square, 42 St - Bryant Park, Atlantic Av-Barclays Ctr might be due to
passengers arriving at nearby railway stations (e.g., LIRR, Penn Station) or bus terminal (e.g., Port
Authority Bus Terminal). The deviations in Jackson Hts-Roosevelt Av in the COVID model might
be related to less passengers heading to LaGuardia Airport, and 59 ST - Columbus Circle in the
COVID model might be related to the tourist trips. The current model does not incorporate nonresident trips, tourist trips and airport-related trips due to the limitations of the data. Spatial
heterogeneity of transit preference may also affect the prediction accuracy. Some areas might have
a higher proportion of people who must take transit and result in a lower reduction in ridership.
However, we only calibrated the alternative specific constant for the transit mode, which on its
own cannot capture this spatial heterogeneity of transit preference. The average difference in
ridership among those selected stations is 5.67% in the Pre-COVID model and 7.91% in the
COVID model, whereas the mean absolute percentage difference is 18.54% in the Pre-COVID
model and 20.93% in the COVID model. These results are acceptable for citywide planning
models in practice (see Flyvbjerg et al., 2005).

3.4 Comparing the result of Pre-COVID model and COVID model
To further study the impact of COVID-19 on the traffic system, we compare the simulation outputs
between the Pre-COVID and COVID models. The result shows that COVID-19 and social
distancing practices have changed people’s travel behavior and may reshape the mode share
(Figure 5). Compared to the pre-COVID period, the mode share of transit decreased about 19%,
while the mode share of cars increased about 6% in the COVID model. The total number of trips

Figure 6 shows the spatial distribution of link speed in the Pre-COVID and COVID model
using the MATSim visulation tool, Simunto Via. Clearly, with the “stay-at-home” order, the
volume of vehicles on the roads have dropped leading to increased travel speeds. These numbers
are readily confirmed by the traffic monitoring reported in the C2SMART White Paper on
COVID-19 Impacts Issue No. 2 (Gao et al., 2020).

3.5 Sensitivity analysis of stay-at-home restrictions on employment industries
Having calibrated and validated the model, we seek to better understand the sensitivity of road
traffic and transit on different employment industries. According to the 2015 American
Community Survey, only 44% of households in NYC own cars. Nonetheless, a study by INRIX in
12

2019 found that NYC ranks as the fourth congested city in the U.S. costing about $11B a year
because of time lost in traffic (Reed, 2019). This could be even worse because of COVID-19.
It is possible for NYC to propose an employer-based restriction on employees to have a
portion of them continue working from home, or to rotate employees in shifts during the reopening
phases. Data shows that remote work has increased by 44% from 2015 to 2020, and remote work
opportunities are more common in high income areas because they are more likely tied to
information-based positions that can be performed off-site (Griffith, 2020). However, it remains
unclear which industries would have the greatest impact if they were able to adopt such policies.
We investigate the relationship between industry and traffic mode choice using our agentbased simulation model. Figure 7 shows the changes in number of trips by car (a) and transit (b)
in the Pre-COVID model and COVID model. The result shows that although many employees are
working at home, the car trips in some industries in the COVID model became higher than the PreCOVID model, likely due to the mode shift to driving. For example, the combination of home/work
locations and mode preferences for industry #6 (Retail Trade) and #15 (Arts) led to more car trips
during COVID. In addition, different industries have different levels of transit trip reduction. These
findings also provide suggestions to policymakers on which industries to target for demand
management strategies. If policymakers were to focus on specific industries to reduce car trips
during a reduced transit capacity reopening, they might want to consider high auto mode usage
industries like Retail Trade and Administrative industries (#6 and #13).

4. Analysis of reopening plan under different transit operating strategies
New York State is planning a four-phase reopening based on the regional guidelines for reopening
NYC, according to the Regional Guidelines on May 8, 2020 (New York State, 2020). The 'UnPause NY' approach is designed to open businesses in phases of priority. Businesses considered
"more essential" with inherent low risks of infection in the workplace and to customers are
prioritized, followed by businesses considered "less essential" or those that present a higher risk
of infection spread. Based on the priority industries in each phase, we generate synthetic
populations corresponding to those employees returning to work. Table 3 shows the percentage of
employees who will return to work in different industries each phase.
A study from China shows that even after a city is re-opened, many people may still think
driving car is safer than using transit (ITDP, 2020). There could also be a boom in other traffic
modes, such as walking and cycling. In the reopening scenarios, a key assumption here is that the
mode preference during the reopening phases mirrors what was observed during the pandemic
period due to behavioral inertia. In other words, the mode choice model parameters in the
reopening scenarios are assumed to be the same as in the COVID model. This assumption can be
conservative and should be treated as worst-case scenarios for transit. The current model will be
continuously enhanced when more data becomes available. For the first two reopening phases, the
transit schedule was assumed to be the same as it was during the COVID period (using the GTFS
on Mar 20, 2020). When simulating the last two reopening phases, the regular transit schedule
(GTFS on Jan 20, 2020) is applied. The simulation model for each scenario is run for 100 iterations
and the computation time for each scenario is on average of about 7.5 hours using an Intel Xeon
2.1 GHz with 64 GB RAM.
4.1. Scenario Set 1: No transit capacity restriction
In these scenarios, there is no transit capacity restriction while assuming mode preferences held
during the crisis are maintained. Figure 8(a) shows the trip ratio in the COVID model and in the
four reopen phases in Scenario Set 1 compared to the Pre-COVID model. The result shows that
only 73% transit ridership will be back by Phase 4 when the city full reopens. The number of car
trips increases 1.42 times compared with the number of pre-COVID trips. In addition, the number
of walking and biking trips increases in Phase 4 as well. Figure 9 shows the changes of mode share
in each phase. The transit mode share in Phase 4 in this scenario set decreases by 9.5 percentage
points compared to the pre-COVID period while the mode share of car increases 12.3 percentage
points. There are relatively small changes in mode share in other traffic modes because their total
number of trips are low compared to transit and car trips.

This result confirms the concern shared by many transportation professionals that the number
of the transit trips may not return to original state even without transit capacity reduction due to
behavioral inertia, resulting in a significant increase in car trips (42% increase compared to a 27%
decrease in transit trips).
4.2. Scenario Set 2: 50% Transit capacity restriction
To ensure the social distance, we assume a 50% transit capacity restriction on all transit vehicles
in the second set of scenarios, assuming mode preferences held during the crisis are maintained.
Figure 8(b) shows the trip ratio in the COVID model and the reopen phases in scenario set 2
compared to the Pre-COVID model. After the city fully reopens in phase 4, 64% transit ridership
is projected with a 143% increase in car trips in Scenario Set 2. Compared with the results in
Scenario Set 1, it suggests that the strategy to restrict transit capacity to 50% on its own would not
be the primary contributor to additional car traffic. Nonetheless, it can still lead to a further
reduction in transit ridership. It is also interesting to see that bike and Citi Bike modes both grow
substantially when transit capacity is restricted, which suggests policymakers should plan
accordingly with those modes, and perhaps with scooters as well, in meeting the shift in demand
from transit.
The changes in mode share under reopening Phase 4 in Scenario Set 2 compared the PreCOVID period and COVID period are shown in Figure 9. The mode share of transit in phase 4
may decrease 12.6 percentage points compared to the Pre-COVID period, which is about 3
percentage points lower compared to Scenario Set 1. The mode share for car may increase 12.9
percentage points compared to the Pre-COVID period and increase 0.6 percentage points
compared to Scenario Set 1. There is also an increase in mode share in other traffic modes
compared to Scenario Set 1, such as bike, taxi and FHV.
4.3. Comparing the traffic condition in full reopen phase (phase 4) and in the Pre-COVID
model
To test the impacts of behavior inertia from COVID-19 with different transit operations in the full
reopening Phase 4, we estimate the traffic volume and speed for car trips per road link from the
simulation results.
Table 7 shows the changes of travel time and distance per car trip in the Phase 4 of reopening
compared to the Pre-COVID model. “Manhattan” in the table refers to trips with destination in
Manhattan while “Citywide” indicates all trips in the simulation model. The results show that both
travel time and distance per car trip in Manhattan increased. For example, the number of car trips
is 2.57 times of the Pre-COVID period under no transit capacity restriction and 2.77 times of the
Pre-COVID period under 50% transit capacity restriction. The results also indicate a much higher
increase in travel time and distance with 50% transit capacity restriction compared to no capacity
restriction.
The citywide metrics show an increase in total number of trips, total travel distance and total
travel time, while a small decrease in average travel distance and average travel time. This might
be because many increased car trips are short-distance trips can lead to a decrease in average travel
time and distance.

Figure 10 shows the average link speed and volume in the Pre-COVID model and Phase 4 in
the two reopening scenario sets to better understand the traffic congestion in the road network. The
result indicates the impact of behavior inertia after the city reopens in Phase 4 will increase the
average link volume and decrease the average link speed, especially during the peak hour, and the
result is significant compared to the Pre-COVID mode. In addition, the average changes in
Manhattan are higher compared to the average value of all regions, but the difference between
Scenario Set 1 and Scenario Set 2 is relatively small.

4.4. Comparing the average change in consumer surplus of agents
In MATSim, each agent has a daily plan of trips and activities. The plan of agents is executed in
the simulation and each plan is then scored and assigned with a utility. In general, the score
includes the travel disutility from the chosen mode plus the disutility of any schedule delay past
the desired arrival time and reflects the consumer surplus. MATSim includes a score for duration
of an activity conducted, up to a maximum duration, but we leave that portion out since it is not
calibrated. The goal of each agent is to maximize the utility of plan by re-planning based on a coevolutionary algorithm (see Horni et al., 2016). When the parameters of the score functions are
unchanged, comparisons can be made between scenarios. We make such a comparison between
the scores, which are converted to monetary values ($) using the $29/h value of time from the
mode choice model for Manhattan trips (He et al., 2020a; Chow et al., 2020).
Table 8 shows the change in average consumer surplus of all the agents in Scenario Set 2
relative to Scenario Set 1. The table indicates that the transit capacity reduction would have an
adverse effect overall on consumer surplus. Most of that effect is on the car mode, which is likely
because of the increase in car trips under a much more congested setting (from 1.42 times to 1.43
times the pre-COVID trips). The impact on other modes in Manhattan is relatively minor in
comparison, which suggests that there is adequate supply in the other modes in Manhattan to
absorb the shift in ridership to them. The scores offer a different picture of the transit capacity
reduction; while it seems like the additional car traffic would be minor compared to Phase 4
without any transit capacity reduction, they have an impact on the already heavily congested traffic
network. Implementing such a strategy should not only look at improving micromobility capacity
but also toward congestion alleviation strategies, particularly in Manhattan where there is supply
from other modes to absorb the shift in trips.

5. Conclusion
Although NYC entered Phase 1 of reopening from COVID-19 stay-at-home orders that persisted
since mid-March 2020, many new challenges for transportation systems remain. There has not yet
been a concrete solution, especially for mass transit, to increase service while protecting riders on
crowded subway or buses. The simulation models proposed in this study are designed to evaluate
the impact of COVID-19 on mass transit ridership as well as helping policy-makers plan for postcoronavirus. Among various insights gained from the study, the following key points are made:
• There is a clear behavioral change due to COVID shifting away from shared use modes to
driving, walking, and biking, and this change differs between Manhattan residents and nonManhattan residents.
• The behavioral change results in some employment industries taking more car trips to work;
policymakers wishing to complement transit reduction policy with employer-enforced stay-athome rotations/curfews/shifts may consider targeting certain high car-trip segments like Retail
Trade and Administrative.

18

•
•
•

If policymakers wish to instead pursue outreach to encourage certain population segments to
revert their behavior back, then the key industries are Retail Trade and Arts where car traffic
in COVID has presumably increased over pre-COVID condition.
Due to the behavioral inertia, a reopening that does not restrict transit capacity would still only
operate at 73% ridership from pre-COVID while increasing car traffic to 142% level.
Transit capacity restriction, even by 50%, would reduce transit ridership from 73% to 64% of
pre-COVID ridership. Interestingly, car trips would only marginally increase further from 142%
to 143%. It seems the transit capacity restriction would shift most users to non-car modes, e.g.
bike and Citi Bike. The impacts of these shifts are disproportionate, however. The small
increase in added car trips to an already congested traffic setting exacerbates the loss in
consumer surplus for drivers. For other modes, it is not as significant of a loss, particularly in
Manhattan (suggesting adequate redundant supply to capture the shift in trips). The findings
are generally encouraging for the policy, but also suggests that policymakers should plan
accordingly to accommodate that increase in active transportation, perhaps even considering
the use of other forms of micromobility like e-scooters, and the increased cost in traffic
congestion with Manhattan-oriented alleviation strategies (cordon-based pricing may help).

The open-source, modular nature of the developed simulation model in MATSim can be
applied to evaluate many new strategies and policies for city government and traffic agencies, such
as the impact of new bike lanes and different transit operations. Besides the effects of the pandemic
and an ensuing recovery on transit use, air quality and emission impact estimation during the
COVID-19 pandemic and reopening can also be studied in the future. The current model will also
be continuously enhanced when more data becomes available.
There are also some limitations of this study. With limited data, the mode choice multiplier
for certain traffic modes were not calibrated in the “stay-at-home” model, which means they are
assumed to remain unchanged with respect to each other. The current model will be continuously
enhanced when more data becomes available. Moreover, a 4% sample population is used in the
current model instead of the entire population due to the large computation time. This can be
further improved in the future.
