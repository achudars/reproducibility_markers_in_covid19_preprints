Key Points
Question As the Covid-19 pandemic surges around the world, what are the number of cases
worldwide at its peak, the length of the pandemic before receding, the fatality rate and the timing
of public health interventions to significantly stop the spread of Covid-19?
Findings We estimated the maximum number of cumulative cases under immediate intervention
to be 1,530,276; under later intervention the number increased to a frightening 255,392,154 and
the case ending time was delayed to January 10, 2021.
Meaning If there is not immediate aggressive action to intervene, we will face serious
consequences.

Abstract
Importance When the Covid-19 pandemic enters dangerous new phase, whether and when to
take aggressive public health interventions to slow down the spread of COVID-19.
Objective To develop the artificial intelligence (AI) inspired methods for real-time forecasting
and evaluating intervention strategies to curb the spread of Covid-19 in the World.
Design, Setting, and Participants A modified auto-encoder for modeling the transmission
dynamics of the epidemics is developed and applied to the surveillance data of cumulative and
new Covid-19 cases and deaths from WHO, as of March 16, 2020.
Interventions and Exposures Pubic health interventions and documented novel coronavirus
(2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP).
Main Outcomes and Measures Data on the number of lab confirmed cumulative, new and
death cases of Covid-19 from January 20, 2020 to March 16 were obtained from WHO.
Results The average errors of 5-step forecasting were 2.5%. The total peak number of
cumulative cases and new cases, and the maximum number of cumulative cases in the world
with later intervention (comprehensive public health intervention is implemented 4 weeks later)
could reach 75,249,909, 10,086,085, and 255,392,154, respectively. The case ending time was
January 10, 2021. However, the total peak number of cumulative cases and new cases and the
maximum number of cumulative cases in the world with one week later intervention were
reduced to 951,799, 108,853 and 1,530,276, respectively. Duration time of the Covid-19 spread
would be reduced from 356 days to 232 days. The case ending time was September 8, 2020. We

observed that delaying intervention for one month caused the maximum number of cumulative
cases to increase 166.89 times, and the number of deaths increase from 53,560 to 8,938,725.
Conclusions and Rele vance

Complimentary to other approaches to model the transmission

dynamics of the virus outbreaks, the AI-based method provides forecasting tools for tracking,
estimating the trajectory of epidemics, assessing their severity, and predicting the lengths of
epidemics with various interventions. We estimated the maximum number of cumulative cases
under immediate intervention to be 1,530,276; under later intervention the number increased to a
frightening 255,392,154 and the case ending time was delayed to January 10, 2021.

Introduction
As of March 16, 2020, global confirmed cases of COVID-19 passed 170,568 and has spread to
more than 152 countries. As this coronavirus passes into a pandemic,1 a number of questions
arise among the public and government and business leaders: How many cases will there be
worldwide? How many deaths can we expect? When will we see a peak in the number of cases?
When will this pandemic end? And, how will recommended immediate actions slow the spread?
A number of the statistical and dynamic models of the Covid-19 outbreak have been applied
to analyze its transmission dynamics. 2-8 These epidemiological models are useful for estimating
the dynamics of transmission, targeting resources and evaluating the impact of intervention
strategies, but the models require values for unknown parameters and depend on many
assumptions,8-10 leading to low accuracy and unsure prediction.
Methods
Modified Auto-encoder for Modeling Time Series
To overcome these limitations, we developed a modified auto-encoder (MAE) (eFigure 1),11 an
AI based method for real time forecasting of the new and cumulative confirmed cases of Covid19 under various interventions around the world.12-13 Transfer learning was used to train the
MAE.13 Weights between 0 and 1 were assigned to an intervention variable for the different
degrees of interventions – zero being no intervention and one being complete. Complete
intervention included keeping social distance, washing hands, strict travel restriction, no large
group gatherings, mandatory quarantine, restricted public transportation, keep social distance,
school closing and closure of all non-essential business, including manufacturing. Using real data

to evaluate the consequences of specific intervention is infeasible. We considered four
intervention scenarios. The first intervention scenario started intervention on March 24, 2020
with a weight of 0.5, one week later transitioned to a complete intervention with a weight of 1.
The second intervention started with a weight of 0 for the first week, a weight of 0.5 for the
second week, and two weeks later transitioned to a complete intervention with a weight of 1.
The third intervention was delaying two weeks, limited in the thrid week and complete in the
fourth week. The fourth intervention delayed actions for three weeks, limited in the fourth weeks
and complete in the fifth week. For each scenario, we investigated how the degree and timing of
the intervention determined the peak time and case ending time, the peak number and maximum
number of cases and forecasting the peak and maximum number of new and cumulative cases in
more than 150 countries across the world.
Data Collection
The analysis is based on the surveillance data of confirmed cumulative and new Covid-19 cases
in the world up to March 16, 2020. Data on the number of cumulative, new and death cases of
Covid-19 from January 20, 2020 to March 16 were obtained from WHO
(https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports). Data
included the total numbers of cumulated, newly confirmed and attributed deaths across 152
countries.
Results
Later intervention makes it difficult to stop the spread of Covid-19
To demonstrate that the MAE is an accurate forecasting method, the MAE was applied to
confirmed accumulated cases of Covid-19 across 152 countries. The intervention indicator for

China and other countries was set to 1 and 0, respectively. eTable 1 presented the one-step to
five-step errors for forecasting the cumulative cases, starting from March 12, 2020. In all cases,
the average forecasting accuracies of the MAE were less than 2.5% (eTable 1).
Table 1 shows the forecasting results of Covid-19 in 30 countries and worldwide under later
intervention (Scenario 4). The total peak number of cumulative cases and new cases in the world
with later intervention could reach 75,249,909 and 10,086,085, respectively. If every country in
the world undertook later intervention, the total number of cases in the world could reach as
high as 255,392,154 and community transmission of Covid-19 continuing until January 10,
2021. The top 10 countries with a high average increasing number of cases were Italy, Spain,
Iran, Germany, USA, France, Switzerland, Belgium, UK and Austria. To show the dynamics of
COVID-19 development, eFigure 2 (G) and (H) plot curves of the number of cumulative cases
and new cases in seven major infected countries: Iran, Spain, Italy, Germany, USA, France and
China under scenario 4.
New strategies are needed to curb the spread of COVID-19
There is urgent need to develop new strategies to curb the spread of COVID-19.1 We investigate
whether complete interventions can control the spread of COVID-19 and how early complete
interventions will reduce the peak time and the number, and the final total number of cases
across the world. Table 2 shows the forecasted results of COVID-19 in 30 countries and
worldwide under early complete intervention (Scenario 1). We can observe dramatic reduction of
the cases of COVID-19. The forecasted total number of cases in the world was reduced by early
complete intervention to 1,530,276 from nearly 255 million based on 4 weeks delay
intervention, In other words, 99.4% of the potential cases would be eliminated by early complete
intervention. The duration time was reduced from 356 days to 232 days, and the end time would

change from January 10, 2021 to September 8, 2020. eFigure 2 (A) and (B) plot curves of the
number of cumulative cases and new cases in six major infected countries: Iran, Spain, Italy,
Germany, USA and France under scenario 1.
To investigate intervention measures between early complete and 4 week delay intervention,
eTables 2 and 3 show the results under scenarios 2 and 3, respectively. eFigure 2(C), (D), (E)
and (F) plot transmission dynamics of Covid-19 with plotted curves of the cumulative cases and
new cases in the six major infected countries under scenarios 2 and 3, respectively.
Comparisons among intervention strategies
To further illustrate the impact of interventions on the spread of COVID-19, we compared the
effects of the four intervention scenarios on the transmission dynamics of Covid-19 across the
world. Figure 1 plots the world reported and forecasted time curves of the cumulative and newly
confirmed cases of Covid-19 under the four intervention scenarios. The ratios of the world
number of final cases across the four scenarios were 1:4.26:19.16:166.9 and ratios of case
duration under the four intervention scenarios were 1:1:01.1.38:1.53. These results demonstrate
that intervention time delays have serious consequences. 4 week delay intervention may
increase the number of cases by 166.9 fold and will delay the ending time by almost four
months. Delaying intervention will substantially speed the spread of coronavirus.
e Figure 3 plots the time-case curves for the top six infected countries: Iran, Spain, Italy,
Germany, USA, France and China. The time-case curve under the 4 week delay intervention
was shifted more than one month to the right and was much steeper than that of under the early
intervention. Delaying intervention will substantially increase the number of cumulative cases of
Covid-19.

eFigure 4 shows the case-fatality rate curve as a function of the Date where the case-fatality
rate was defined as the ratio of the number of deaths over the number of cumulative cases in the
world. The average case-fatality rate was 3.5%.
Discussion
Real-time forecasting are more accurate than epidemiologic transmission model where the model
parameters may not applicable in practice. We estimated the duration, peak time and ending
time, peak number and maximum number of cumulative cases of Covid-19 under four
intervention scenarios for 152 countries in the world. This provided critical information for
government and health authorities to consider urgent public health response planning to slow the
spread of Covid-19. We demonstrated that aggressive interventions are urgently needed.
Otherwise, we will face disastrous consequences.

Materials and Methods
Data Sources
Data on the confirmed, new and death cases of Covid-19 from January 20, 2020 to March 16
were from WHO (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situationreports). Data included the total numbers of accumulated, new confirmed and death cases in
the world and across 152 countries. The data were organized in a matrix with the rows
representing the whole world and countries and columns representing the number of the new
confirmed cases each day. The confirmed cases of each country were a time series. Let 𝑡𝑖𝑗 be the
number of the confirmed cases of the 𝑗 𝑡ℎ day within the 𝑖 𝑡ℎ country. Let 𝑍 be a 𝐼 × 𝑚
dimensional matrix. The element 𝑍𝑖𝑗 is the number of the confirmed new cases of Covid-19 on
the 𝑗 𝑡ℎ day, starting with January 20, 2020 in the 𝑖 𝑡ℎ country.
Modified Auto-encoder for Modeling Time Series
Modified auto-encoders (MAE) (1,2) were used to forecast the number of the accumulative and
new confirmed cases of Covid-19. Unlike the classical auto-encoder where the number of nodes
in the layers usually decreases from the input layer to the latent layers, the numbers of the nodes
in the input, the first latent layer, the second latent layer and output layers in the MSAE were 8,
32, 4 and 1, respectively (eFigure 1). We view a segment of time series with 8 days as a sample
of data and take 128 segments of time series as the training samples. One element from the data
matrix 𝑍 is randomly selected as a start day of the segment and select its 7 successive days as the
other days to form a segment of time series. Let 𝑖 be the index of the segment and 𝑗𝑖 be the
column index of the matrix 𝑍 that was selected as the starting day. The 𝑖 𝑡ℎsegment time series

can be represented as {𝑍𝑗𝑖, , 𝑍𝑗𝑖+1 , … , 𝑍𝑗𝑖+7 } . Data were normalized to 𝑋𝑗𝑖+𝑘 =

0, 1, … ,7, where 𝑆 = ∑7𝑘=0 𝑍𝑗𝑖+𝑘. Let 𝑌𝑖 =

,𝑘 =

be the normalized number of cases to forecast.

If 𝑆 = 0, then set 𝑌𝑖 = 0. The loss function was defined as
̂ 2
𝐿 = ∑128
𝑖=1 𝑊𝑖 (𝑌𝑖 − 𝑌𝑖 ) ,
where 𝑌𝑖 was the observed number of the cases in the forecasting day of the 𝑖 𝑡ℎsegment time
series and 𝑌̂𝑖 was its forecasted number of cases by the MAE, and 𝑊𝑖 were weights. If 𝑗𝑖 was in
the interval [1, 12], then 𝑊𝑖 = 1. If 𝑗𝑖 was in the interval [13, 24], then 𝑊𝑖 = 2, etc. The back
propagation algorithm was used to estimate the weights and bias in the MSAE. Repeat training
processed 5 times. The average forecasting 𝑌̂𝑖, 𝑖 = 1, … , 152 will be taken as a final forecasted
number of the accumulated confirmed cases for each country.
Forecasting Procedures
The trained MAE was used for forecasting the future number of cumulative cases of Covid-19
for each country. Consider the 𝑖 𝑡ℎ country. Assume that the number of new confirmed cases of
Covid-19 on the 𝑗 𝑡ℎ day that needs to be forecasted is 𝑥 𝑖𝑗. Let 𝐻 be a 152 × 8 dimensional
1

matrix and ℎ 𝑖𝑙 = 𝑥𝑖𝑗−9+𝑙 ,𝑖 = 1, … , 152, and 𝑙 = 1, … ,8 . Let 𝑔𝑖 = ∑8𝑙=1 ℎ 𝑖𝑙 ,𝑖 = 1, … , 152 be
8

the average of the 𝑖 𝑡ℎ row of the matrix 𝐻. Let 𝑈 be the normalized matrix of 𝐻 where 𝑢𝑖𝑙 =
ℎ𝑖𝑙
𝑔𝑖

, 𝑖 = 1, … , 152, and 𝑙 = 1, … ,8. The output of the MAE is the forecasted number of new

confirmed cases and is denoted as 𝑣̂ 𝑖 = 𝑓(𝑢𝑖1 , … . , 𝑢𝑖8, 𝜃), 𝑖 = 1, … ,152 , where 𝜃 represented the
estimated parameters in the trained MAE. The one-step forecasting of the number of new
confirmed cases of Covid-19 for each country is given by 𝑌̂𝑖 = 𝑣̂𝑖 𝑔𝑖 , 𝑖 = 1, … , 152.

The recursive multiple-step forecasting involved using a one-step model multiple times where
the prediction for the preceding time step was used as an input for making a prediction on the
following time step. For example, for forecasting the number of new confirmed cases for the one
more next day, the predicted number of new cases in one-step forecasting would be used as an
observational input in order to predict day 2. Repeat the above process to obtain the two-step
forecasting. The summation of the final forecasted number of new confirmed cases for each
country was taken as the prediction of the total number of new confirmed cases of Covid-19
worldwide.
