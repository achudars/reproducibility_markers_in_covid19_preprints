Abstract
Due to SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) being a
novel virus, there are currently no known effective antiviral drugs capable of slowing its
progress. To accelerate the discovery of potential drug candidates, bioinformatics based in
silico drug discovery can be applied as a very robust tool. In the present study, more than 60
antiviral drugs already available on the market, were chosen after literature survey. These can
be used in clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19. In this study, these candidate drugs
were ranked based on their potential to interact with the Spike protein and RdRp (RNAdependent RNA polymerase) of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, the mechanism of their action as
well as how the virus infection can utilize Hemoglobin to decrease the oxygen level in blood
is explained. Moreover, multiple sequence alignments of the Spike protein with 75 sequences
of different viruses from the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily were performed. This gives insight
into the evolutionarily conserved domains that can be targeted using drug or antibody
treatment. This multidimensional study opens a new layer of understanding about the most
effective drug-targetable sites on the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction
In the past two decades, the world has faced several infectious disease outbreaks such
as Influenza A (H1N1), SARS, MERS, Ebola, and Zika virus, which have had a considerable
global impact on the healthcare delivery and economic systems. More recently, the outbreak
of novel coronavirus / 2019-nCov / SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus from the
coronavirus family that causes COVID-19, has spread worldwide from the Chinese city of
Wuhan (Cui, Li et al. 2019; Andersen, Rambaut et al. 2020; Shereen, Khan et al. 2020). SARSCoV-2 is a highly transmittable coronavirus strain that can cause severe biological responses
in among others the lower portion of the respiratory tract. Through the collection of
epidemiological data, healthcare authorities have been able to determine the route through
which person-to-person transmission of SARS-COV-19 has taken place, spreading at such high
rates that it has become a worldwide public health challenge (Shereen, Khan et al. 2020). Many
patients who tested positive for SARS-COV-19 who also had underlying comorbidity, have
developed pneumonia-like symptoms. Especially elderly and patients with a compromised
immune function, seem to be more susceptible to infection and subsequent mortality. In these
high-risk patients, COVID-19 presents itself with flu-like symptoms which then rapidly worsen
into severe pulmonary edema, respiratory distress blood thickening result stoke or cardiac
arrest impose a serious threat to the life of COVID-19 patients (Avula, Nalleballe et al. 2020;
Baldi, Sechi et al. 2020; Li and Ma 2020; Richardson, Hirsch et al. 2020) . Recently researchers
also reported severe neurological problems in these patients which put a huge risk to the mental
health in the society (Helms, Kremer et al. 2020; Mao, Jin et al. 2020). According to the latest
report from the WHO (World Health Organization), up to the present, 27.7 million people were
infected with COVID-19 and the death toll has reached 900 thousand worldwide. Of these, the
American and European continents cover 6.3 million and 2.5 million cases respectively;
together comprising around one third of known cases throughout the world. Despite cautious
optimism related to the recent decline in cases and subsequent relaxation of containment
procedures in various cities, there is still a fear of new waves of infections. Therefore,
discovering an effective inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed to protect human lives.
During the early stages of the global COVID-19 crisis, doctors scrambled to find an effective
treatment for those suffering as a result of the coronavirus infection. Researchers are trying to
develop and establish various treatment modalities such as plasma therapy, antibody treatment,
decoy peptides/molecules and vaccine development (Duan, Liu et al. 2020; Inal 2020; Tobaiqy,
Qashqary et al. 2020; Zeng, Chen et al. 2020). Unfortunately, the exact mechanisms of its
pathogenesis remain unclear, which has made finding an effective treatment very difficult. To
find a cure for COVID-19 we must first understand its structure and infection mechanism.
SARS-CoV-2 is a contagious virus that can be spread through inhalation or ingestion of
2

moisture droplets that contain the virus, resulting from coughing and sneezing (Zhang, Li et al.
2020). Structurally, SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA virus with a genome that consists
of ∼30000 nucleotides. This encodes four structural proteins: Nucleocapsid (N) protein,
Membrane (M) protein, Spike (S) protein, Envelop (E) protein, and ∼16 non-structural proteins
(nsp) (Schoeman and Fielding 2019; Boopathi, Poma et al. 2020; Jin, Du et al. 2020). The viral
surface proteins, Spike, envelope, and membrane are embedded in a lipid bilayer enveloping a
capsid protein shell in which there is a nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) that is bound to the
virus's single positive-strand RNA genome (Boopathi, Poma et al. 2020). The M-protein is
most abundant in the viral surface and it is believed to be the central organizer for the
coronavirus assembly. The trimeric form of Spike protein is integrated across the surface of
the virus; it mediates attachment of the virus to the host cell surface receptors and fusion
between the viral and host cell membranes to facilitate entry into the host cell (Vinson 2020;
Wrapp, Wang et al. 2020). The coronavirus Spike protein is subjected to proteolytic cleavage
by host proteases (i.e. trypsin and furin) in two sites at PCS (Polybasic furin Cleavage Site)
located at the boundary between the S1 and S2 subunits (S1/S2 site) (Fig. S1 and 9). Binding
of ACE2 with Spike S1 (AA: 13-685) proteins allows the virus to adhere to lung epithelial cells
and through a tube composed of Spike S2 proteins (AA:686-1273) it injects the genetic material
inside the host cell (Fig. S2 and S3). Once the virus reaches the budding stage, the S2 domain
(S2′ site, AA: 816-1273) is cleaved to release the fusion peptide (Shang, Ye et al. 2020). The
E-protein is a small membrane protein composed of ∼76 to 109 amino-acid and minor
components of the virus particle. It plays an important role in virus assembly, membrane
permeability of the host cell, and virus-host cell interaction. A lipid envelope encapsulates the
genetic material. In addition to these, Hemagglutinin-esterase dimers (HE) have been located
at the surface of the viral capsid (Zeng, Langereis et al. 2008). Although HE proteins may be
involved in virus entry, they are not required for replication; however, they do appear to be
important for infecting natural host cells.
With the current need to reduce the cost, time, and risks of the drug development
process, scientists are exploring the use of already approved drug candidates to test in COVID19 patients such as Hydroxychloroquine, Remdesivir, and Azithromycin (Gautret, Lagier et al.
2020; Grein, Ohmagari et al. 2020; Rosenberg, Dufort et al. 2020). The ability to reuse FDA
approved/preclinical trial drugs to target multiple virus proteins of SARS-CoV-2 provides a
ray of hope for the survival of humanity. In this work, we thoroughly investigated the potential
use of broadly available antiviral, anti-bacterial, anti-parasitic drugs, flavonoids, and vitamins,
which have shown antiviral activity. After thorough literature survey we selected these drugs
which can be used for the treatment of COVID-19, here we explore their interaction efficiencies
with Spike and RDRP proteins of the virus. Computational simulation is an essential tool to
accelerate the discovery of therapeutics which can effectively cope with the rapidly evolving
structure of SARS-CoV-2 on the molecular level (Boopathi, Poma et al. 2020). In addition,
clinical trial reports suggest that patients suffering from COVID-19 have a low oxygen
concentration in their blood not caused solely by respiratory distress (Kashani 2020; Wang, Hu
et al. 2020; Xie, Covassin et al. 2020). This phenomenon led us to the hypothesis of a possible
binding event between SARS-CoV-2’s Spike protein and the hemoglobin, specifically heme
group interaction (Cavezzi, Troiani et al. 2020; liu and Li 2020). Further, to find out the
3

therapeutically important conservative protein motifs of the Spike protein, we performed
multiple sequence alignments between the Spike protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and 75
sequences from different virus species that belong to the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily.

Materials and Methods
1) Docking of antivirals, antibiotics, antiparasitics, flavonoids and vitamins with Spike
and RdRp protein of SARS-CoV-2
3D models of SARS-CoV-2 Spike (QHD43416.pdb) and RdRp (QHD43415_11.pdb)
proteins were downloaded from Zhang Lab I-TESSAR online library in .pdb format (Yang and
Zhang 2015). 3D structures of drugs and small molecules for docking were downloaded from
PubChem in .pdb format. There was no change observed in the structure of these drug
molecules after getting activated inside the liver, which makes them a suitable candidate for
the docking study. Docking was performed with AutoDockTool (v1.5.6) software (Morris,
Huey et al. 2009). All models were converted to. pdbqt format after deletion of water molecules
and computing Gasteiger algorithm for macromolecules, whereas in ligands after choosing
torsions ≤ 9. For developing the grid box for SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein we set the following
metrics: X-dimension: 104, Y-dimension: 116, Z-dimension: 126, Spacing: 1.000, Offset X:
2.917, Offset Y: 1.450 and Offset Z: 0.194 and grid were set using Autogrid4. Docking was
performed with Autodock4, for each docking we set our macromolecules as a fixed filename
and docked with Genetic algorithm and output set to Lamarckian GA (4.2). After the docking
simulation, 10 docking models were analyzed and ranked by their energy binding ability (∆G).
H-bonds were also built in the docking models and the best model of each docking was saved
as .pdbqt format file.
Docking models were further analyzed for the discovery of a binding pocket in Discovery
Studio Visualizer (DSV) (v2019 client; Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA) software. Interactions
were built by selecting all favorable interaction types intermolecularly. Furthermore, 2D
diagrams were visualized through DSV.
2) In silico protein-protein interaction
Protein-protein docking was performed through the ClusPro (v2.0) server (Kozakov, Hall
et al. 2017). Macromolecules were submitted in .pdb format and the most favorable model was
downloaded for further analysis in DSV. We docked the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein with both
the tetramer and monomer molecules of Hemoglobin (1A3N.pdb) and the Heme group
(extracted from 1A3N.pdb), in ClusPro server and AutoDockTools (v1.5.6) software
respectively. LigPlot + v.2.2 software was used to generate a 2D plot of interface amino acids
at the Hemoglobin-Spike interaction pocket (Laskowski and Swindells 2011).

3) Finding of most interacting motifs of Spike protein with antiviral drugs and heat-map
representation of motifs
We manually investigated the binding pocket of the Spike protein and RdRp with the
docked drug ligands. We divided the whole protein sequence of Spike and RdRp proteins in
12 and 10 equally spanned motifs respectively. Based on the number of interactions with the
docked drug ligand database, we ranked each motif and further normalized the number of
interactions in each motif to compare their potential as a target for the therapeutic drugs and
their significance for the future drug development against SARS-CoV-2. In continuation, based
on the normalization of the total number of interactions for each motif, heat-maps were
produced using DSV. Similarly, we investigated the frequency and location of specific amino
acids of Spike and RdRp in each motif, which is important for the interaction with various drug
ligands.
4) Investigation of conservative motifs of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and phylogenetic
analysis
To fulfill this purpose, we used the Blast Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis
(MEGA 10.0.5) tool. In the search of unique conservative regions in SARS-CoV-2 Spike
protein throughout its evolution, we performed alignment of the amino acid sequence of the
Spike protein with BLASTP database and selected 75 subject sequences different viruses from
the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily (Fig.S5), which have the highest BLASTP score. Later, we
ran the sequence alignment of these 75 subject sequences from the database using the MEGAX software’s MUSCLE program (Kumar, Stecher et al. 2018). Further, a phylogenetic tree was
generated based on the Fast-Minimum Evolution tree clustering method and the Grishin
distance method of MEGA-X. The phylogeny was tested using the resampling bootstrap
methodology with 1000.

Results
1. Potential drugs for the treatment of COVID-19
1.1.Most potent antiviral drug targeting of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein
In our study, we focused on 47 different antiviral agents (Fig. 1A) most readily available
on the market. AutoDock based docking results suggested their interaction efficiency/binding
efficiency with Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 along with binding pocket and location of most
important amino acids which are crucial for drug interaction. We have shown the top heat
antiviral drugs based on their efficiency of interaction (Fig.2; Table S1) against the Spike
protein; starting from the highest binding efficiency : Indinavir (∆G = -9.8 kcal/Mol),
Nelfinavir (∆G = -9 kcal/Mol), Fosamprenavir (∆G = -8.2 kcal/Mol), Rintatolimod (∆G = -7.6
kcal/Mol), Loviride (∆G = -7.3 kcal/Mol), Nevirapine (∆G = -7.3 kcal/Mol), Nitazoxanide (∆G
= -7.1 kcal/Mol), Imiquimod (∆G = -6.8 kcal/Mol), Inosine (∆G = -6.5 kcal/Mol), and
Cobicistat (∆G = -6.37 kcal/Mol). Although, most of the antivirals bind with the S1-NTD
5

region and its surroundings, which suggest they might physically block the trimeric assembly
of the Spike protein and/or the viral adhesion to the host cell membrane via blocking the
interaction between S1 and cell surface receptor such as ACE2.
1.2.Most potent antibacterial/antiparasitic/flavonoids/vitamins for the targeting of
SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein
In our study, we focused on 21 different antibiotics, 3 antiparasitic (including
hydroxychloroquine), 5 flavonoids, and 3 small ligands including Vitamin C and Vitamin D
(Fig.1B); Which were proven to have some effect on other coronaviruses, and they are broadly
accessible. Analyses of the AutoDock results yielded a list of the top antibiotics based on their
efficiency of interaction (Fig.3; Table S2) with the Spike protein that is as follows :
Vancomycin (∆G = -10.2 kcal/Mol), Nelfinavir (∆G = -8.6 kcal/Mol), Azithromycin (∆G = 7.9 kcal/Mol), Sulfamethoxazole (∆G = -6.6 kcal/Mol), Meropenem (∆G = -6.4 kcal/Mol),
Tenofovir Disoproxil (∆G = -6.3 kcal/Mol), Trimethoprim (∆G = -6.1 kcal/Mol), Ciprofloxacin
(∆G = -5.58 kcal/Mol), Gentamicin (∆G = -5.4 kcal/Mol), and Levofloxacin (∆G = -5.11
kcal/Mol).
Similarly, we found the top antiparasitic drugs (Fig. 1B) that interact with the Spike of
SARS-CoV-2 (Fig.4A-4B; Table S3), which are as follows: Ivermectin B1a (∆G = -9.16
kcal/Mol), Ivermectin B1b (∆G = -8.86 kcal/Mol), and Hydroxychloroquine (∆G = -2.85
kcal/Mol). Furthermore, in our study, we focused on 5 different flavonoids (Fig. 1B) that were
proven to have some effect on other coronaviruses. AutoDock results of the candidates portrays
(Fig.4C-4D; Table S3) Tetramethoxyflavone as the peak (∆G = -4.91 kcal/Mol), with
Herbacetin (∆G = -4.74 kcal/Mol) and Gallocatechin (∆G = -2.88 kcal/Mol) following
afterward. Finally, we investigated the efficiency of vitamins as a therapeutic for the treatment
of COVID-19 (Fig. 4E-4F; Table S3). We found that Vitamin D (∆G = -5.52 kcal/Mol) and
Vitamin C (∆G = -2.95 kcal/Mol) can interact with the Spike protein.
1.3. Most potent antiviral drug targeting of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp protein
Our investigation included an examination of multiple drugs targeting viral RdRp and then
comparing that to the activity of those same drugs on the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (Table
S4). We found that the top antiviral drugs having interaction with RdRp are as follows:
Beclabuvir (∆G = -5.63 kcal/Mol), Galidesivir (∆G = -4.38 kcal/Mol), Ribavirin (∆G = -4.2
kcal/Mol), Favipiravir (∆G = -3.09 kcal/Mol), Sofosbuvir (∆G = -2.95 kcal/Mol), Tenofovir
(∆G = -2.34 kcal/Mol), and Remdesivir (∆G = -1.28 kcal/Mol). Most interestingly, the binding
potential of these drugs for the interaction with Spike seems to be very similar to interaction
with RdRp in terms of the formation of the most energetically favorable complex (Fig. 5A). As
the subject that sparked interest in the research, Favipiravir was observed to bind to the RdRp
molecule with an energy of -3.09 kcal in the amino acid region ranging from 380 to 510.
Additionally, when examined against the Spike protein monomer, Favipiravir was observed to
bind to the protein within the 620 to 650 amino acid range at a bond energy of -2.94 kcal.
Using Favipiravir as a standard, the six most prominent RdRp-targeting drugs on the market
were likewise examined for their binding properties. Of the drugs examined, most stayed
within a binding energy range of ±2.0 kcal of Favipiravir, but notably, the drug Beclabuvir
significantly exceeded this with an energy of -5.63 kcal to the amino acid range 130 to 190
6

when binding to RdRp and -6.64 kcal to the amino acid ranges 220 to 300 and 600 to 640 when
binding to the Spike monomer.
2. Most important motifs of RdRp protein as a target for therapeutic drugs
Most of the drugs targeting RdRp mainly interact between the amino acid residues 101-200
and 701-800 specially THR-51, ASN-122, PHE-133, LYS-182, CYS-760, THR-761, ALA771, GLU-780 (Fig.5B). Additionally, we also found the subtle interaction between 1-100 and
801-900 amino acid residues.
3. Most important motifs of Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 as a target for therapeutic
drugs
Most of the antiviral drugs interact with Spike S1-NTD especially between the residues 1100 and 201-300 (Fig.6A). Most antiviral drug interacting residue locations at S1 are VAL-3,
PHE-4, VAL-6, PHE-58, and PRO-82. On the other hand, most of the antiviral interaction
occurs with Spike S2 lies between the residues 801-1000, and 1201-1300. Especially the amino
acids ASN-824, VAL-826, THR-827, LEU-945, LYS-1205, TYR-1209, PRO-1213, and TRP1217 are very important. In continuation, interface residues where most of the antibiotics
interact also lie on the S1-NTD between 1-100 and 201-300 amino acids which is similar to
the antivirals (Fig.6B). Specifically, the residues VAL-3, VAL-6, LEU-7, LEU-8, ARG-21,
GLN-23, LEU-24, PRO-26, PRO-82, VAL-83, and VAL-289. We also found the interaction
pocket at S2 especially residues between 701-800, 901-1000, and 1201-1300 such as GLY744, ASP-745, LEU-966, VAL-976, LEU-977, ASN-978, and ARG-1000 are very important
in the interaction with antibiotics. In addition, residues 601-700 at the junction of S1 and S2
seem important for the action of antibiotics.
Furthermore, in the case of antiparasitic drugs, we found that the residues of S2 Spike
between 901-1000 and 1101-1200 are very important especially the locations LYS-1205 and
TYR-1209 are similar to antivirals and antibiotics (Fig.6C). However, we also found
interaction at S1-NTD between the residues 1-101 and 200 which suggests the therapeutic
importance related to S1 Spike. Additionally, a study with flavonoids revealed the interaction
at S1-NTD between the residues 1-100 especially the locations VAL-6 and ARG-21, and at S2
between the residues 701-900 such as LYS-790, LYS-811, ALA-893 and LEU-1224 (Fig.6D).
Similarly, the interaction with Vitamins C and D lies between the residues 1-100, 301-400, and
501-600 amino acids of Spike S1, most importantly VAL-47, PHE-318, and THR-630, and
between the 701-1000 residues of Spike S2 especially residues TYR-741, ILE-742, CYS-743,
and GLY-744 (Fig.6E).
4. Interaction between Hemoglobin and Heme protein with Spike of SARS-CoV-2
We docked the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein with both the molecule of hemoglobin and the
heme group in the ClusPro (v2.0) server and AutoDockTools (v1.5.6) software, respectively.
Taking into consideration the docking simulation of hemoglobin, both the monomer (Fig.7)
and the tetramer (Fig. S4) of it bind very tightly to S1-NTD with several hydrogen bonds
bridging the two molecules. Residues of the Spike protein forming hydrogen bonds with the
7

hemoglobin monomer are ARG-237, ASN-37, LEU-270, ARG-88, ASP-627, HIS-625, ASN61, THR-63, GLN-271, GLN-23, and TYR-28 (Fig.7). Similarly, we found that ARG-237,
ARG-21, VAL-53, VAL-6, PHE-4, VAL-3, ASP-111, SER12, GLN-14, ARG-158, CYS-15,
THR-22, THR-73, THR-74, GLU-132, LYS-113, and SER-112 of the Spike protein form a
hydrogen bond with the tetramer of hemoglobin (Fig. S4). Interestingly, the ARG-237
hydrogen bond persists in both simulations (monomer and tetramer), thus indicating a possible
binding area that is more favorable for the interaction in terms of binding efficiency and spatial
pairing. Moreover, the region surrounding the above-mentioned amino acid might facilitate the
binding of the heme group to the S1-NTD region of the Spike protein. Simulation of this
interaction was achieved through AutoDock software and yielded a binding energy score of 5.4 kcal/Mol. Results of interaction show several Vander Waals bonds surrounding the heme
group, whereas 6 Pi-(Anion, Sigma, -Pi Stacked and Alkyl) bonds and 1 hydrogen bond
bridging with Spike protein (Fig.8). Amino acid residues TYR-38, LYS-41, PHE-43, LYS206, GLU-224, PRO-225, LEU-226, VAL-227, ASP-228, and THR-284 of Spike protein
interact with the heme group directly. The core amino acid of this interaction is GLU-224 that
might possess the ability to bind directly to the heme iron with a Pi-Anion bond and thus
preventing the free oxygen-binding into the area.
5. Conservative motifs of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and phylogenetic analysis
correlation between the sequence of Spike protein
In the search of finding unique regions in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, we performed
an alignment of the amino acid sequence of the Spike protein with the BLASTP database
(Fig.S5). Top 5 sequences that showed high alignment scores were aligned again using MEGAX software and a detailed analysis of five important Spike protein domains were examined.
Results suggest that conservation exists in higher levels at S2-HR1 and HR2, moderate
conservation at S1-NTD, and PCS, whereas at S1-CTD there are many hypervariable regions
(Fig. 9). We also ran the sequence alignment of 75 subject sequences from the database using
MEGA-X software and developed a phylogenetic tree through BLASTP. The subject
sequences suggested by BLASTP are related to Spike proteins from MERS, Murine hepatitis
virus (MCoV), Human coronavirus (HCoV), Feline Infectious Peritonitis virus (FIP-CoV) and
SARS-CoV-1 (Fig. 10). Initial results suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein shares
similarities between SARS-CoV-1; whereas a common ancestor connects MERS and SARSCoV-2. The majority of similar sequences aligned with SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein are from
the Betacoronavirus of the subspecies of Sarbecoviruses, Merbecoviruses, and Embecoviruses;
conversely, the minority of them come from Alphacoronaviruses.
For the alignment of the 75 subjected sequences, we could identify several conserved
regions spanning throughout the protein. Several “clusters” of conserved regions spanning
from the beginning S1-CTD until its end at the 330 to 529 amino acid range. That means S1CTD can be divided into 7 clusters of conserved domains, composed of around 25 amino acids
each, according to the MEGA-X software alignment. This gives a deeper insight into the nature
of the Spike protein Binding Domain to ACE2 and other receptors. Moreover, two massive
evolutionarily conserved domains lie at the center of the S2 region within the amino acid ranges
of 908 to 1003 and 1163 to 1211; indicating that the S2 part of Spike protein seems to be more
heavily conserved compared to its S1 counterpart. In conclusion, the S1-CTD and the final
8

portion of the S2 protein are relatively conserved throughout the species and they will be
effective references for the discovery of a universal drug against all strains of SARS-CoV-2.

Discussion
1. Importance and Significance of drug docking with Spike
1.1. Antivirals
At the onset of the pandemic, doctors began to try a plethora of antiviral drugs with the
likelihood of success in an attempt to slow the progression of COVID-19 in those affected by
the infection. However, it would be both illogical and immoral to try all of these drugs on
human patients without any knowledge as to whether or not they will have any interaction with
the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In our study, we focused on 47 different antivirals already approved
and broadly available on the market that are thought to have some potential for inhibiting the
virus. Seeing as the Spike protein is evolutionarily conserved, it is a prime location to observe
for interaction and inhibition of the virus in a manner that is ubiquitous across all potential
strains. Using the AutoDock software, we performed docking simulations between these drugs
to observe the energy/efficiency of their interactions with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein.
Arranged by their binding energy (Fig. 1A), these drugs show a wide range of effectivity from
Saquinavir at the lowest (ΔG = -0.23 kcal/Mol) to Indinavir at the highest (ΔG = -9.8 kcal/Mol).
Drugs with interaction energy greater than or equal to the Japanese-made Favipiravir (ΔG = 5.2 kcal/Mol) are prime candidates to be potential treatments as it has already been observed
to have some mild effects on inhibition of COVID-19 in patients (Wang, Cao et al. 2020).
Further examination of the AutoDock results revealed that the drug molecules interacted
with the Spike protein monomer at very specific locations (Fig. 6A). Most notable are the βsheets between 1-100 residues range having over 150 different molecular interactions. This is
followed by the ɑ-helix between 801-900 residues range yielding over 100 unique interactions.
Noting the location of the 1-100 range, drugs that interact with that binding pocket will most
likely not have a large-scale effect on the protein’s functionality as it only serves as the Nterminal domain. Conversely, the 801-900 region is located at the point on the Spike monomer
that is key to the formation of the Spike trimer; binding to this region would impair SARSCoV-2’s ability to form the trimeric structure and overall inhibit the production of viable
virions (Vinson 2020; Wrapp, Wang et al. 2020).
1.2. Antibiotics
Normally, when looking at stopping a virus, antibiotics would not be considered due to
their specific targeting of bacterial processes. Overuse of antibiotic treatments on non-bacterial
agents has been a major factor that has led to the rise of drug resistance (Murray 2020).
However, all options must be considered in an emergency such as the COVID-19 pandemic
and bioinformatics tools have the luxury to examine the potential of antibiotics being used
against SARS-CoV-2 without the possibility of contributing to drug resistance. Additionally,
researchers have shown the combinational therapy of Azithromycin and Hydroxychloroquine
9

suppressed the growth of SARS-Cov-2 virus in-vitro (Gautret, Lagier et al. 2020). Therefore,
similar to our examination of antiviral drugs, we investigated the binding properties of 21
prominent antibiotics to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein using the AutoDock software. After
arranging the drugs based on their binding energy (Fig.1B), a steady increase in energy can be
observed from Rifampicin at the lowest (ΔG = -1.83 kcal/Mol) to Vancomycin at the highest
(ΔG = -10.2 kcal/Mol). As was previously stated, drugs with binding energy higher than ΔG
= -5.2 kcal/Mol exhibit inhibitory properties on the virus (as seen with Favipiravir), therefore
9 antibiotics beginning from Gentamicin (ΔG = -5.4 kcal/Mol) have potential to disrupt viral
function. Unfortunately, the majority of the molecular interactions observed occur in the Nterminal domain of the Spike protein (Fig.6B) which indicates that they might yield little to no
result in disrupting the virus.
1.3. Antiparasitic
Researchers have reported that Ivermectin and Hydroxychloroquine, which are FDAapproved anti-parasitic drugs previously shown to have broad-spectrum antiviral activity invitro (Gautret, Lagier et al. 2020; Heidary and Gharebaghi 2020). Leon Caley et al. showed
that with a single addition of Ivermectin to Vero-hSLAM cells 2 h post-infection with SARSCoV-2 able to effect ~5000-fold reduction in viral RNA at 48 h (Caly, Druce et al. 2020).
Ivermectin, therefore, warrants further investigation for possible benefits in humans. Similarly,
the 4-aminoquinoline antimalarials chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine have been promoted
and sometimes used in the treatment of COVID-19, alone or combined with Azithromycin,
based on their immunomodulatory and antiviral properties, despite an absence of
methodologically appropriate proof of their efficacy (Gautret, Lagier et al. 2020).
In our study, we examined the potential for these antiparasitic drugs to interact with the
SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein using the AutoDock software. By comparing the binding energies
that resulted from this analysis (Fig.1B) it can be observed that Hydroxychloroquine has a
relatively low energy interaction (ΔG = -2.85 kcal/Mol) while Ivermectin B1a and B1b have
high energy bonds (ΔG = -9.16 kcal/Mol and ΔG = -8.86 kcal/Mol respectively). Additionally,
these interactions are observed to occur primarily on the ɑ-helices existing in the 901-1200
amino acid region of the Spike monomer (Fig. 6C). Considering that this region is involved in
the formation of the Spike trimer, specifically the base of Spike where protein is integrated into
the virion and are conserved among coronavirus species (Shereen, Khan et al. 2020; Vinson
2020; Wrapp, Wang et al. 2020).
1.4. Flavonoids
Neglected from the wide scientific view, flavonoids played a crucial role many times
against emerging viruses. Tetramethoxyflavone from elderberry extract inhibited Human
Influenza A (H1N1) infection in vitro with an IC50 value of 252 ± 34 μg/mL (Roschek, Fink
et al. 2009). Moreover, flavonoids were utilized against the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV),
a pathogenic chicken coronavirus (Chen, Zuckerman et al. 2014). Whereas there is a non-well
effective vaccine yet; Chen and colleagues tested non-cytotoxic, crude ethanol extracts of
Sambucus nigra fruit for anti-IBV activity because it contains polyphenol derivatives that
inhibit other viruses. Electron microscopy of virions treated with S. nigra extract showed
10

compromised envelopes and the presence of membrane vesicles, which suggested a mechanism
of action. These results demonstrate that S. nigra extract can inhibit IBV at an early point in
infection, probably by rendering the virus non-infectious. They also suggest that future studies
using S. nigra extract to treat or prevent IBV or other coronaviruses are warranted (Chen, Zheng
et al. 2014). Additionally, coronaviruses of SARS and MERS have been rising targets of some
flavonoids. The antiviral activity of some flavonoids against CoVs is presumed directly caused
by inhibiting 3C-like protease (3CLpro). It has been suggested that flavonoids such as
herbacetin, rhoifolin, and pectolinarin were found to efficiently block the enzymatic activity of
SARS-CoV 3CLpro (Jitendra Subhash, Aroni et al. 2020; Jo, Kim et al. 2020).
In our study, we focused on 5 different flavonoids (Fig.1) that were proven to have some
effect with other coronaviruses. AutoDock results of the candidates suggested a top hit of
Tetramethoxyflavone (∆G = -4.91 kcal/Mol) and a second top hit being Herbacetin (∆G = 4.74 kcal/Mol). Although they did not exhibit high ∆G values, flavonoids showed unique
binding areas. From the binding areas, we could roughly identify the preferent binding regions
on the Spike protein (Fig.5). Total interactions per segment results suggest a tendency of
flavonoids to bind in both S1-NTD and S2. Even though most of the screened drugs and small
molecules bind with the S1-NTD region, flavonoids showed an increased number of
interactions in the conserved S2 region too. This suggests that they might possess the ability
not only for structurally inhibiting the assembly of the Spike trimer but also for binding into
the lumen of the trimeric protein and thus inhibiting the viral fusion with the host cell in a
variety of coronaviruses.

1.5. Vitamins
Earlier, researchers claimed that vitamin C has a beneficial effect on asthma. In the absence
of a specific treatment for SARS, the possibility that vitamin C may show non-specific effects
on severe viral respiratory tract infections should be considered (Hemilä 2003). Numerous
reports are indicating that vitamin C may affect the immune system for example the function
of phagocytes, transformation of T lymphocytes, and production of interferon (Leibovitz and
Siegel 1981; Hemilä and Douglas 1999). In particular, vitamin C increased the resistance of
chick embryo tracheal organ cultures to infection caused by an avian coronavirus (Atherton,
Kratzing et al. 1978). Studies in animals found that vitamin C modifies susceptibility to various
bacterial and viral infections, for example protecting broiler chicks against an avian
coronavirus. Five placebo-controlled trials have shown quite consistently that the duration and
severity of common cold episodes are reduced in the vitamin C groups, indicating that viral
respiratory infections in humans are affected by vitamin C levels. There is also evidence
indicating that vitamin C may affect pneumonia (Hemilä 1997). In particular, three controlled
trials with human subjects reported a significantly lower incidence of pneumonia in vitamin Csupplemented groups, suggesting that vitamin C may affect susceptibility to lower respiratory
tract infections under certain conditions.
Similarly, the role of Vitamin D has been proved very important for the prevention of lower
respiratory tract diseases caused by viral infections. There are two forms of vitamin D,
cholecalciferol (vitamin D3), and ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) (Yang, Lv et al. 2019). Vitamin
11

D has also been implicated as a causal factor for the common cold (Rondanelli, Miccono et al.
2018). Two observations point in this direction. Colds are more frequent in the winter when
vitamin D levels are generally lower, and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
who have lower levels of vitamin D have more upper respiratory tract infections (URIs). Citing
the role of vitamin D, Gindi et al found that the number of recent URIs was inversely related
to serum 25(OH)D levels; this linkage was stronger in patients with pre-existing respiratory
tract disease (Ginde, Mansbach et al. 2009). On a more positive note, the Cochrane
Collaborators' review of vitamin D for asthma is quite encouraging (Martineau, Cates et al.
2016). Recently, researchers found an association between mean levels of vitamin D in various
countries and cases respectively mortality caused by COVID-19. Their results suggested that
the mean level of vitamin D (average 56mmol/L, STDEV 10.61) in each country was strongly
associated with the number of cases/1M (mean 295.95, STDEV 298.73 p=0.004, respectively
with the mortality/1M (mean 5.96, STDEV 15.13, p < 0.00001) (Ilie, Stefanescu et al. 2020).
Vitamin D levels are severely low in the aging population, especially in Spain, Italy, and
Switzerland. This is also the most vulnerable group of the population for COVID-19. In
addition to that, in the present study, we also found that vitamin C (∆G = -2.95 kcal/Mol) and
vitamin D3 (∆G = -5.52 kcal/Mol) can directly interact with Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2
(Fig. 4E-4F). This finding lends the idea that vitamin C and vitamin D both can block the
binding of Spike with host cell receptors, the formation of its trimeric form and fusion to host
cells make them important candidates for further clinical trials to probe their potential for the
treatment of lower respiratory tract diseases.

2. Importance and Significance of drug docking with RdRp
During the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, doctors scrambled to find an
effective treatment for those suffering from the virus. Among the many drugs used in an
attempt to slow the virus, the Japanese anti-influenza drug Favipiravir (sold as Avigan) showed
promise when applied to COVID-19 patients. This is believed to be through its inhibition of
the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) employed by RNA viruses during their
replication process (Furuta, Komeno et al. 2017; Cai, Yang et al. 2020). However, as the
pandemic wore on it became clear that this drug was only effective when administered at early
stages of coronavirus infection; a phenomenon observed in tests against other viruses including
alphaviruses, arenaviruses, and flaviviruses (Furuta, Komeno et al. 2017). This suggests that
the inhibition of RdRp works primarily as a preventative measure rather than a primary form
of treatment against RNA-based viruses. Further, our findings suggest the efficacy of
Beclabuvir, in particular, to be used against SARS-CoV-2. Not only does it interact
significantly with the viral RdRp, but it’s binding energy to the Spike protein exceeds that of a
significant number of the drugs tested in this study. This suggests that it would have a stronger
inhibitory factor to the virus than that of Favipiravir and provide additional protection in the
form of disrupting the Spike protein’s function.
In our investigation, we examined 7 antiviral drugs known to primarily interact with RdRp
in their respective viral targets. Using the AutoDock software to generate docking simulations
of these drugs to the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp molecule, the drugs were arranged according to their
binding energies (Fig. 5A). Using Favipiravir as a standard at ΔG = -3.09 kcal/Mol for the
ability to exhibit a mild clinical success, 3 RdRp-targeting drugs are immediately identifiable
12

as potentially more successful: Ribavirin (ΔG = -4.20 kcal/Mol), Galidesivir (ΔG = -4.38
kcal/Mol), and Beclabuvir (ΔG = -5.63 kcal/Mol). Additional examination of where these
molecular interactions take place revealed that they are primarily concentrated in the 101-200
and 701-800 amino acid regions (Fig. 5B). Similar to the Spike protein, the 701-800 regions
in particular consist of a series of ɑ-helices that are essential in the RdRp’s functionality;
blocking them would, therefore, inhibit the use of RdRp and essentially shut down the virus’s
ability to replicate its genome.

3. Significance of Heme/hemoglobin and Spike interactions
Recently many anecdotal clinical trial reports suggest that patients affected by COVID-19
not only have impaired respiratory function but also low oxygen count causing respiratory
distress (Li and Ma 2020; Wang, Hu et al. 2020; Xie, Covassin et al. 2020). This phenomenon
led us to the hypothesis of a possible binding event between SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and
the heme group of the hemoglobin molecule. That binding might greatly reduce the oxygen
affinity to hemoglobin and increase its degradation rate as many COVID-19 survivors showed
much less hemoglobin count compared with the non-infected (Cavezzi, Troiani et al. 2020; liu
and Li 2020). It was also revealed that alternative treatments currently being considered for
COVID-19 such as Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine by increasing hemoglobin
production and increasing hemoglobin availability for oxygen binding and acetazolamide by
causing hyperventilation with associated increasing levels of oxygen and decreasing levels of
carbon dioxide in the blood may significantly ameliorate COVID-19 respiratory symptoms
(Iyamu, Perdew et al. 2009; Pastick, Okafor et al. 2020).
Considering the docking simulation of hemoglobin, Spike protein has the possible potential
to interact with the tetramer and monomer of it (Fig.7). Amino acid GLU224 might be the key
target as it plays a crucial role of binding directly to the iron particle of heme group. This is the
first time shown that the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 might interact with not only the
hemoglobin molecule but as well as with the heme group directly to its iron particle. These
results will shed light on the, yet inkown, intrinsic mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein
and the low oxygen count of patients and survivors, whereas at the same time offers a possible
target side for the development of new drugs.
4. Alignment and drug comparison:
We also identified conserved regions through the sequence alignment and found several
portions of the protein that have some conservation among similar species Spike proteins.
Starting from S1-NTD, 10 out of 75 subjected sequences match with its first portion at 1-200
amino acid range, whereas 24 out of 75 sequences match with the S1-NTD’s last portion at
201-300. A moderate amount of similarity was observed at the S1-CTD side with 33 similar
sequences at around 300-510. Moreover, the highest conservation among subjected sequences
was observed in the center of the S2 portion of the protein at around 900-1000 in a number of
42 from 75 (Fig. S5). To strengthen these results, we aligned 5 Spike proteins among several
species related to coronavirus (Porcine epidemic virus, MERS-CoV, FIP-CoV, SARS-CoV-1,
and Human-CoV) and investigate their conservation in five core domains (S1-NTD, S1-CTD,
PCS, S2-HR1, and S2-HR2). Domains of S1-NTD, HR1, and HR2 showed high conservation
13

(Fig. 9). This might suggest that drugs which tend to bind to those regions are more effective
in addressing a bigger spectrum of coronaviruses. Interestingly, most of the antiviral top hit
drugs like Indinavir (ΔG= -9.8 kcal/Mol) and Nelfinavir (ΔG= -9 kcal/Mol) are binding near
the center of S2 (Fig. 2). The similar pattern observed with antiparasitic drugs Ivermectin B1a/b
(ΔG= -9.16/-8.86 kcal/Mol) (Fig. 4A-4B) and Vitamin D (ΔG= -5.52 kcal/Mol) (Fig. 4E-4F),
whereas on the other hand, top hit antibiotic drugs did not show preferences at the S2 binding
area of the Spike protein (Fig. 4). In this perspective, the above-mentioned drugs could possess
the ability to physically inhibit the assembly of the Spike protein as well as the viral entry in a
pan-CoV targeted manner.
Shuai and colleagues (Xia, Yan et al. 2019) showed that targeting the HR1 domain of
Human-CoV Spike protein, which is in the area of S2, that showed increased binding with our
docked drugs, significantly reduced the viral entry in mouse models. Targeting this specific
domain with a small molecule could be a pan-CoV target as its conservation is high among the
CoV species. Turning the attention to conserved areas of Spike protein and not to the
hypervariable S1-CTD will lead to a drug that not only has great inhibitory potential but also
will possess a broad target activity against multiple coronavirus infection.
Moreover, taking into consideration another spotlight region of the Spike protein, the
Polybasic furin Cleavage Site (PCS), which located in the boundaries of S1 and S2, was under
our observations (Andersen, Rambaut et al. 2020).Throughout our docked library only one
molecule could bind into that area. Vancomycin which exhibited the lowest binding energy
(∆G = -10.2 kcal/Mol) from all our docked drug categories, is the only drug that binds within
the region of PCS in an approximate position of amino acid range between 654 and 692. The
functional activity is still unknown for SARS-CoV-2 PCS; pathogenicity and transmissibility
need to be elucidated as well. Emerging research referred to PCS as an enhancer of cell-cell
fusion, whereas cleavage of it results in intra-species infection; with a great example of MERSCoV (Menachery, Dinnon et al. 2020). Thus, it is very important to evaluate drugs that can
bind to that area of the Spike protein since it might result in wanting outcomes for the fight
against SARS-CoV-2.

Conclusion
In the present study, docking of common antiviral, antibiotics, antiparasitic, and other
ligands such as flavonoids and vitamins to SARS-Cov-2 core proteins (Spike and RdRp)
revealed the potential of their use for the treatment of COVID-19 during the current emergency.
Drugs Indinavir, Nelfinavir, Vancomycin, Gliclazide, Ivermectin, Vitamin C, and Vitamin D,
showed very high affinity, thus can be used as a potential therapeutic in the current pandemic.
However, in-vitro and in-vivo clinical trials are needed to further evaluate the potential of these
drugs alone or in combination for the treatment of COVID-19. In addition, the finding of most
interacting motifs of Spike and RdRp, altogether with conservative motifs of SARS-CoV-2
Spike throughout the evolution gives a new layer of understanding of the computer-aided drug
and antibody/vaccine designing for the treatment of COVID-19. Our study suggests there is a
high possibility of mutation in the S1 region of the Spike protein, in contrary S2 remains more
conservative during the evolution. Therefore, the use of a combination of conserved peptide
14

sequences of Spike protein could be a strategy to develop an effective vaccine. Additionally,
designing the new drugs selectively targeting these conservative motifs might help to find out
a potential cure for the COVID-19. However, an in-vitro/in-vivo investigation will be needed
for the further clinical use of the results of present study. Finally, designing of inhibitory
peptides blocking the receptor-binding domain of Spike protein interacting with
hemoglobin/heme that we reported in the current study, could help to control the hypoxia
condition during the infection of SARS-Cov-2, which might significantly improve the survival
of patients suffering from COVID-19.

Fig.5: A graphical representation of the comparative analysis found in Table S4. Binding
energies are organized here (A) are arranged from weakest to strongest based on the molecule
it is interacting with. These lists of drugs and their binding energies are separated along the
26

central axis based on the viral protein they are interacting with, namely RdRp on the left and
the Spike protein on the right-hand side. Additionally, quantitative analysis and graphical
representation of the locations at which the molecules are interacting with the SARS-CoV-2
RdRp (B) can be observed.

27

Fig.6: Heat map of the Spike protein represents the frequency of antiviral drug bindings against
the 12 segments of the protein. Simulations suggest a preference of antiviral drugs to bind
around the S1-NTD region and S2(A); were similar results observed in flavonoid interactions
28

(D). Docking of antibiotic drugs exhibits a preference in the S1-NTD region only (B).
Antiparasitic drugs interestingly showed a higher binding frequency in S2 of the protein (C).
From the perspective of the vitamins, they showed to bind in both S1-NTD/–CTD region and
S2 (E).
