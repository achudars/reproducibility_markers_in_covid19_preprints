Macroscopic growth laws describe in an effective way the underlying complex dynamics of the
spreading of infections, as in the case of CoviD-19, where the counting of the cumulative number
N (t) of detected infected individuals is a generally accepted variable to understand the epidemic
phase. However N (t) does not take into account the unknown number of asymptomatic cases A(t).
The considered model of CoviD-19 spreading is based on a system of coupled differential equations,
which include the dynamics of the spreading among symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals
and the strong containment effects due to the social isolation. The solution has ben compared
with N (t), determined by a single differential equation with no explicit reference to A(t), showing
the equivalence of the two methods. The model is applied to Covid-19 spreading in Italy where a
transition from an exponential behavior to a Gompertz growth for N (t) has been observed in more
recent data. The information contained in the time series N (t) turns out to be reliable to understand
the epidemic phase, although it does not describe the total infected population. The asymptomatic
population is larger than the symptomatic one in the fast growth phase of the spreading.

I.

INTRODUCTION

There is an impressive number of experimental verifications, in many different scientific sectors, that coarse-grain
properties of systems, with simple laws with respect to the fundamental microscopic algorithms, emerge at different
levels of magnification providing important tools for explaining and predicting new phenomena.
For example, the Gompertz law (GL) [1], initially applied to human mortality tables (i.e. aging), describes tumor
growth [2, 3], kinetics of enzymatic reactions, oxygenation of hemoglobin, intensity of photosynthesis as a function
of CO2 concentration, drug dose-response curve, dynamics of growth, (e.g., bacteria, normal eukaryotic organisms).
Analogously, the Logistic Law (LL) [4] has been applied in population dynamics, in economics, in material science
and in many other sectors.
The ability of macroscopic growth laws in describing the underlying complex dynamics is sometime surprising.
A clear and timely example is given by the infection spreading (Coronavirus [5, 6] in particular), where different
Governments impose strong containment efforts on the basis of the mortality rate and of the growth rate of the
cumulative total number of detected infected people N (t) at time t, which has a strong impact on the national health
systems.
However, there is a large number of infected people without any symptoms who contribute to the disease spreading
but are not explicitly taken into account in N (t), since not detected.
More precisely, a macroscopic growth law for N (t) is solution of the general differential equation
dN
= αef f (t)N (t),
dt

(1)

where αef f (t) is the specific growth rate at time t. For example, if αef f (t) =constant one obtains the exponential
behavior. Various growth patterns have been very recently applied to the time evolution of the CoviD-19 infection
[7–13]. On the other hand, by using the previous equation to describe the epidemic phase, the cumulative number
of asymptomatic infected individuals, A(t), seems completely neglected. Indeed, the second term of the equation
depends on N (t) only.
For the CoviD-19 infection, since A(t) is unknown, many Governments have correctly applied strong constraints to
slow down the spreading: social isolation, information on the localization of infected individuals and the use of a very
large number of medical swabs.
However, the question arises: is the information obtained by monitoring N (t) reliable in understanding the epidemic
phase?
By a simple model of the interaction between the symptomatic cumulative detected population N (t) and the
asymptomatic one, A(t), we discuss how the effective coarse-grain equation (1) takes into account the asymptomatic

2
population in the transient phase of the spreading. Moreover one gets useful indications on the number of asymptomatic individuals and on the effective lethality.
In Sec.1 different macroscopic growth laws are applied to the cumulative number of detected infected individuals in
China, South Korea and Italy, where the containment effort started earlier, to describe the phases of the spreading.
A simple dynamical model where the asymptomatic population and the isolation effect play an important role is
discussed in Sec.2. The results are in Sec.3 and Sec.4 is devoted to comments and conclusions.

INFECTION SPREADING PHASES: MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

The macroscopic growth laws in eq. (1), can be classified by considering the time derivative of αef f , as shown in
ref. [14, 15]. For example the GL and the LL are in the, so called, universality class U2 [14], where dαef f /dt =
a1 α + a2 α2 . Moreover, the Gompertz and the logistic equations can be written in a different way, which clarifies the
feedback effect of the increasing population , i.e.

In the GL and in the LL, kg ln(N∞
) and kl are respectively the initial exponential rates and the other terms
determine their slowdown.
The comparison of the growth laws, solutions of the previous differential equations, with the data on the cumulative
number of infected individuals is reported in fig. 1 for China, showing that the coronavirus spreading has three phases:
an initial exponential behavior, followed by a Gompertz one and a final logistic phase. For South Korea, after the
three phases, the spreading seems to restart (see fig. 2). Italy is still in the Gompertz growth phase (see fig. 3).
The previous equations neglect the large (undetected) asymptomatic population and the isolation effects, since they
concern the time evolution of N (t) only. However, a simple model in the next section shows that the GL takes into
account a more complex underlying dynamics. The analysis can be repeated for the LL.

III.

A SIMPLE MODEL: ASYMPTOMATIC POPULATION AND CONTAINMENT EFFECTS

In the model, we call T (t) the cumulative total number of infected people, which is the sum of the number of the
cumulative detected infected individuals N (t) and of the asymptomatic ones A(t): T (t) = N (t) + A(t).
In the data of N (t) the number of dead and of healed people is included, since they have been previously infected.
In the fast growing phase, their total number is much smaller than N (t) and therefore they are not included in the
dynamics (the re-infection is considered very unlikely). The previous condition defines the transient phase.
Therefore one has to take into account the rates of the following processes (n = detected infected person, a =
asymptomatic infected person): n → n + n, a → n + a, n → n + a, a → a + a with rates c1 (t), c2 (t), c3 (t), c4 (t)
respectively.
Accordingly, the corresponding mean field equations are
dN (t)
= c1 (t)N (t) + c2 (t)A(t),
dt

(4)

dA(t)
= c3 (t)N (t) + c4 (t)A(t).
dt

(5)

The functions ci (t), i = 1, 4, describe the damping effects due to the containment effort and we assume they have an
exponential decreasing behavior:
ci (t) ≃ e−λt

(6)

i.e. the rates of the dynamical processes decrease in time due to social isolation and other external constraints. This
effect should be independent on the status of the infected individual (n or a). On the other hand, in the processes

involving a symptomatic individual, he/she is (or should be) rapidly detected, together with those who belong to
his/her chain of infection transmission, independently on their symptomatic or asymptomatic condition. Therefore
the rate of the processes involving infected persons should be suppressed with respect to the transmission rate among
asymptomatic persons, which is “invisible”.
In other terms, one expects that, in the transient phase, the rate of the process among asymptomatic individuals
only, a → a + a, decreases slowly than the other ones. As a first step, one assumes that the functions c1 (t), c2 (t),
c3 (t), c4 (t) are given by
c1 (t) = c01 e−λ1 t , c2 (t) = c02 e−λ1 t ,

c3 (t) = c03 e−λ1 t , c4 (t) = c04 e−λ2 t ,

(7)

with λ2 < λ1 and c0i > 0. The coefficients c0i are the initial rates and λ1 , λ2 parameterize their reduction due to the
isolation conditions.
it is an effective way to take into account the dynamics in eqs. (4, 5, 7).
To clarify that the solution of eq.(2) takes into account, in an effective way, the dynamics in eqs. (4, 5, 7), the
system is analytically solved (see appendix) for λ1 = λ2 . For λ2 < λ1 there is no analytical solution and the numerical
one will be compared with the Italian data and the previous GL fit in the next section.
IV.

RESULTS

The Gompertz fit (from eq. (2)) of Italian data is compared with the numerical solution of the dynamical system (4, 5, 7) with λ2 < λ1 in fig. 4. The two curves are well compatible, indicating that the interaction between
symptomatic and asymptomatic populations is contained in eq. (2) in an effective way. Moreover the solution of the
system gives an estimate of the asymptomatic population, plotted in fig. 5.
The previous analysis clearly suggests that:
a) the curve N (t) takes into account the dynamics of the asymptomatic individuals;
b) in the fast growing phase there is a large asymptomatic population: to stop the infection spreading the strong
social isolation is the best method;

c) the time evolution of N (t) is an effective macroscopic growth laws solution of eq. 2 for Italy, completely consistent
with the system in eqs. (4, 5, 7).
In this respect the choice of monitoring the time evolution of N (t) to understand the epidemic phase is reliable, since
the underling dynamics is included in the time dependence of αef f in eq. (1). This is probably related to the result
that a general classification of the growth laws depends on the time derivative of αef f [14, 15].
On the other hand, the system of differential equations give more information than the single equation for N (t).
In particular, the ratio, R(t) (see appendix), between symptomatic and asymptomatic populations is plotted as a
function of time in fig. 6. Moreover, one can evaluate in a more reliable way the lethality of the infection, defined
as the ratio of the number of dead individuals and the total number of infected ones. The italian lethality is 13%
neglecting the asymptomatic population, but, in our model, its value reduces to ≃ 3% considering the total infected
population.
V.

COMMENTS AND CONCLUSIONS

The model in eqs. (4, 5, 7) is a simplified version of a more complex dynamics [16, 17] and can be improved including
other specific populations [18].
Different analyses of the CoviD-19 spreading predict a large asymptomatic population. In ref. [10] the number of
asymptomatic individuals in Italy on March 12th turns out to be more than 100.000 versus a symptomatic detected
population of about 12.000. Our analysis suggests an asymptotic population of about 27500 individuals on March
12th, 76000 on March 19th and 129000 on March 24th. In ref. [19], the outbreak in Italy has been estimated, giving
a ratio of about 1:3 between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals on February 29Th. The evaluation of the
asymptomatic population is a difficult task and the results are strongly model dependent.
Macroscopic laws in eq. (1) include the dynamics of the infection with the advantage of a reduction of the free
parameters: the simple system in eqs. (4, 5, 7) has in principle 5 parameters plus 2 initial conditions, but the
Gompertz curve has 2 parameters and 1 initial condition.
The reliability of N (t) as an index of the spreading has been checked by a devoted analysis, including the crucial
effects of the social isolation and the role of the asymptomatic individuals.

Figure 7: Confirmed daily rate.

A further confirmation of this conclusion comes from the direct comparison between the daily rate N (t + 1) − N (t)
and the corresponding mortality one, reported in figs. (7,8), which shows that the time evolution of N (t) anticipates
the other by about 8 days.
It should be clear that the previous analysis implicitly assumes that the protocol concerning the detection of infected
individuals, as for example the number of medical swabs (per day), does not change in time. Indeed, a modification
in the detecting protocol (as in the Chinese case) or the sudden, strong, variation in the number of swabs could mimic
an increase or a decrease in N (t) of not dynamical origin.
