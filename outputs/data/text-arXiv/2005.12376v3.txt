Abstract
COVID-19 pandemic has reshaped our world in a timescale much shorter than what we can understand.
Particularities of SARS-CoV-2, such as its persistence in surfaces and the lack of a curative treatment or
vaccine against COVID-19, have pushed authorities to apply restrictive policies to control its spreading.
As data drove most of the decisions made in this global contingency, their quality is a critical variable for
decision-making actors, and therefore should be carefully curated. In this work, we analyze the sources of
error in typically reported epidemiological variables and usual tests used for diagnosis, and their impact
on our understanding of COVID-19 spreading dynamics. We address the existence of different delays in
the report of new cases, induced by the incubation time of the virus and testing-diagnosis time gaps, and
other error sources related to the sensitivity/specificity of the tests used to diagnose COVID-19. Using a
statistically-based algorithm, we perform a temporal reclassification of cases to avoid delay-induced errors,
building up new epidemiologic curves centered in the day where the contagion effectively occurred. We also
statistically enhance the robustness behind the discharge/recovery clinical criteria in the absence of a direct
test, which is typically the case of non-first world countries, where the limited testing capabilities are fully
dedicated to the evaluation of new cases. Finally, we applied our methodology to assess the evolution of the
pandemic in Chile through the Effective Reproduction Number Rt , identifying different moments in which
data was misleading governmental actions. In doing so, we aim to raise public awareness of the need for
proper data reporting and processing protocols for epidemiological modelling and predictions.

1. Introduction
Since the outbreak of novel SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019, the spread of COVID-19 has changed nearly
every aspect of our daily life, challenging modern society to find a way to function under conditions never
seen before. Governmental plans on public health have played a crucial role in its control in the absence
of an effective treatment to cure COVID-19 or a vaccine to prevent it. Typically reported variables in the
COVID-19 pandemic, available in public repositories (as Worldometers.info, 02 Jun, 2020; Dong et al., 2020,
among others), are the incidence of new cases ∆T , total cases T , discharged/recovered cases R, and deaths
D. These variables serve as input for the development and evaluation of governmental plans and to fit the
vast variety of SIR-like mathematical models recently proposed (see, e.g., Contreras et al., 2020a; Yang
et al., 2020; Pang, 2020; Aguilar et al., 2020, and references therein for a brief review of them). Among the
several factors conditioning the quality/reliability of the variables mentioned above are those related to the
sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic tests, delays between sampling and diagnosing, and the delay between
contagion, development of symptoms and testing. The latter varies from country to country, depending
heavily on the local government’s testing strategy and resources. Even though SIR-like models have been
reported to be not-suitable to predict turning points or any other quantitative insight on this pandemic
(Castro et al., 2020), to the best knowledge of the authors, delays have not been pointed out as the cause, as
raw data has always been used to fit them.
Different parameters can be used to evaluate the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Among them
we may find the documentation rate (Wilder et al., 2020), secondary infection rate, serological response to
infection (WHO, 2020b), number of vacancies at ICU (Liew et al., 2020), and the Basic Reproduction Number
R0 (Allieta et al., 2020; Gevertz et al., 2020), which is one of the most widely used. This parameter (R0 )
represents the number of persons a single infected individual might infect before either recovering or dying,
when the population is entirely susceptible (Perasso, 2018). Traditional forms to estimate the R0 are rather
complex, heavily depending on the fitting of SIR models to local data (Heesterbeek, 2002; Delamater et al.,
2019; Wang et al., 2020; Ma, 2020). In a previous work (Contreras et al., 2020b), we proposed a methodology
to obtain real-time estimations of the Effective Reproduction Number Rt directly from raw data, which was
satisfactorily applied to evaluate the panorama of the COVID-19 spread in different countries and to forecast
its evolution (Medina-Ortiz et al., 2020a). Nevertheless, its heavy dependence on reported data required the
study of common error sources affecting this parameter, and the development of methodologies to control,
correct, and quantify their impact (Contreras et al., 2020b).
In this work, we analyze the sources of error in the typically reported epidemiological variables and their
impact on our understanding of COVID-19 spreading dynamics. We address the existence of different delays
in the report of new cases, induced by the incubation time of the virus and testing-diagnosis time gaps, and
provide a straightforward methodology to avoid the propagation of delay-induced errors to model-derived
2

parameters. Using our statistically-based algorithm, we perform a temporal reclassification of individuals
to the day where they were -statistically- most likely to have acquired the virus, building a new smooth
curve with corrected variables. We postulate this new temporally modified curve as the proper one for
fitting purposes in SIR-like models. We present an analogous methodology to estimate the number of
discharged/recovered individuals, based on the reported evolution of the viral infection, the performance of
the different tests for its diagnosis, and the case fatality, which can be easily adapted for a particular country.
We used our methodology to assess the evolution of the pandemic in Chile, identifying different moments in
which the use of raw data was misleading governmental actions.

2. On the performance of tests for diagnosing COVID-19
Different methods for diagnosing COVID-19 have been developed and reported in the literature, with
real-time RT-PCR being the standard applied globally (Lippi et al., 2020). Nevertheless, techniques such as
the IgG and IgM rapid tests, the Chest Computed Tomography (Chest CT), and CRISPR-Cas systems are
also being used. In this section we provide a brief analysis of them, highlighting the different characteristics
of both the techniques and their basic approach to detect viral infection.
2.1. Real-time RT-PCR
Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a mechanism for amplification
and detection of RNA in real time (see Gibson et al., 1996, for an exhaustive description of the technique).
Initially, RNA obtained from samples is retrotranscribed to DNA using a reverse transcriptase enzyme. By
applying temperature cycles, the conditions are created for new copies of the DNA to be synthesized from
the initial one. The lower the initial DNA concentration, the lower the probability of a synthesis reaction in
a given cycle. It is assumed that the minimum time from contagion until testing positive in the RT-PCR test
is 2.3 days (95 % CI, 0.8–3.0 days) before the onset of symptoms (He et al., 2020), which typically appear
5.2 days (95 % CI, 4.1–7.0 days) after contagion (Lauer et al., 2020). He et al. (2020); Ganyani et al. (2020)
showed that 44 % to 62 % of the total contagions occur in the pre-symptomatic period. It has been inferred
that the viral load reaches a peak value before 0.7 days from the onset of symptoms (95 % CI, 0.2–2.0 days),
when it starts falling monotonically together with the infectivity rate (He et al., 2020). Finally, the virus has
been detected for a median of 20 days after the onset of symptoms (Zhou et al., 2020), but infectivity may
decrease significantly eight days after symptom appearance.
A high false-negative rate (Li et al., 2020c; Xiao et al., 2020) and a sensitivity of 71 to 83 % (Fang et al.,
2020; Long et al., 2020) have been reported for the real-time RT-PCR technique, and several vulnerabilities
of it have been identified and quantified (Lippi et al., 2020). Considering sampling, handling, testing, and
reporting, the total time necessary to get RT-PCR results for an individual may range between 2 to 3 days
3

(Nguyen et al., 2020). However, the time it takes to perform the RT-PCR experiment takes about 2 to 3
hours (Li et al., 2020d).
2.2. IgG and IgM rapid tests
Part of the immune system response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection is the production of specific antibodies
against it, including IgG and IgM (Li et al., 2020b). Serological tests detect the presence of those antibodies
and, unlike the other detection methods, take only 15 minutes to produce results (Li et al., 2020d). These
tests have a sensitivity of 88.6 % and a specificity of 90.6 % (Li et al., 2020d). This technology was developed
for the SARS-CoV epidemic, which was caused by a virus belonging to the same family of coronaviruses as
SARS-CoV-2, providing satisfactory results after 2–3 days from the onset of symptoms (for IgG), and after
eight days (for IgM) (Woo et al., 2004).
2.3. Chest Computed Tomography
The principle behind the Chest Computed Tomography (Chest CT) is the analysis of cross-sectional lung
images to identify viral pneumonia features, like ground-glass opacity, consolidation, reticulation/thickened
interlobular septa or nodules (Ai et al., 2020). Chest CT has shown a sensitivity between 97 % and 98 %
(Long et al., 2020; Fang et al., 2020). However, due to the similarities between CT images accounting for
COVID-19 and CT images for other viral types of pneumonia, false-positives are likely to occur. Compared
to RT-PCR, Chest CT tends to be more reliable, practical, and quick to diagnose COVID-19 (Ai et al.,
2020). Nevertheless, requiring the presence of the potentially infected patient in a health center lacks the
flexibility that rapid tests provide, and can backfire on movement restriction measures. COVID-19 pneumonia
manifests with abnormalities on computed tomography images of the chest, even in asymptomatic patients
(Shi et al., 2020).
2.4. CRISPR-Cas systems
In CRISPR-Cas systems, a guide RNA (gRNA) is designed to recognize a specific RNA sequence, like
any particular gene or partial ARN sequence of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Endonuclease enzymes of the
Cas family and the specific gRNA will search for the sequence match. This match will deliver a signal that
confirms the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the sample (LeMieux, 2020). DETECTR and SHERLOCK
are two examples of CRISPR-Cas technologies for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, being able to obtain results
in less than 1 hour at a significantly lower cost compared to the RT-PCR technique. DETECTR showed a
95% positive predictive agreement and 100% negative predictive agreement (Broughton et al., 2020), while
SHERLOCK has not been validated using real patient samples and is not suitable for clinical use at this
time (Jin et al., 2020).

3. Methodology
Our work aims to expose and quantify, both theoretically and in a case study, the impact of different
sources of error in commonly reported data of the COVID-19 spread, such as newly reported cases ∆T , total
cases T , infected I, and recovered R fractions of the population.
First, we define random variables associated with the delay in both sampling and diagnosing new cases,
and by modeling their probability distribution functions, we derive a method to re-classify the newly reported
cases accordingly. As reclassification occurs backwardly, for re-evaluating the current scenario through our
methodology, we cast predictions on the reported new cases using an ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated
Moving Average) model. Having the corrected variables, we evaluate differences on the effective reproduction
number Rt , following the methodology presented by Contreras et al. (2020b). Assuming the outbreak is
well represented with a SIR model in a given timeframe i, Rt can be estimated as

βi
γi ,

which can be directly

estimated from the discrete version of the SIR differential equations. Decoupling the “recovered” fraction in
the SIR model as clinically recovered individuals R and deaths D, Rt would be given by equation 1:
Rt =

∆I
+ 1.
∆R + ∆D

(1)

Given the existence of a latent and incubation period for COVID-19, which will be carefully described in
the next section, SIR models might not capture all the features of the outbreak and SEIR models would
be more suitable. In such models, only infected individuals can propagate the infection and, equation-wise,
estimations of Rt remain more or less the same (Chowell et al., 2007). As data of exposed individuals is not
widely available or entirely reliable, its contribution was not included in the estimations of Rt to keep its
straightforward use.
Autoregression models for the forecast of ∆T were implemented using the statsmodels Python library
(Seabold and Perktold, 2010). All other calculations and visualizations were made using DMAKit-lib Python
library (Medina-Ortiz et al., 2020b) and MATLAB R2018a.

4. Results
4.1. Temporal misclassification of new cases
There exists an incubation period tc for the development of SARS-CoV-2-related symptoms, which
average has been reported to range between 5.1 days (Li et al., 2020a; Lauer and Grantz, 2020; He et al.,
2020) and 6.4 days (Backer et al., 2020). He et al. (2020) also reported the existence of a latency period,
which is the time required before an infected individual could spread the infection, which was extended until
2.3 days (95% CI, 0.8–3.0 days) before the onset of symptoms, which occurred tc days after contagion.
The incubation time tc is especially relevant in the case of a symptoms-based testing strategy or when
the spread has reached the non-traceability stage. To model it, we use τ1 with log-normal distribution, as
5

reported in Lauer et al. (2020) and suggested in Nishiura (2007):

τ1 ∼ log N µ, σ 2 .

(2)

According to the values reported in Lauer et al. (2020), µ = 1.63 = ln(tc ) and σ = 0.41 retrieve the expected
values of 5.1 for the median, and 11.5 for the 98’th percentile. Even though the required time for performing
the test is short (Li et al., 2020d), delays between testing and diagnosis have been reported (Nguyen et al.,
2020). We will sum up secondary delays, such as the symptom-to-testing and testing-to-diagnosis time gaps,
into a random variable τ2 , which, for the sake of simplicity, will be assumed to follow a uniform distribution
between tmin and tmax :
τ2 ∼ U ([tmin , tmax ]) .

(3)

Further knowledge on the nature of factors affecting τ2 could lead to a different distribution. We may
postulate a reclassification for obtaining the real number of new contagions occurred in a day t as the sum of
contributions of cases reported with a delay of k days:
∆Tcorr (t) =

X

wi ∆T (t + k),

k = τ1 + τ2 ,

(4)

k∈N∪{0}

where wi represents the fraction of patients that were notified at time t0 = t + k but had acquired the virus at
t. Note that the different delays are referred to the random variable Z = τ1 + τ2 . The probability distribution
function for Z is obtained by the convolution method, assuming τ1 and τ2 are independent and combining
equations 2 and 3:

Assuming that data is reported on a daily basis, we can calculate the probability associated to having a delay
of k days:
Z

k−1

For practical reasons, we can define a threshold U < 1 for truncating the probability mass distribution
(equation 6), which otherwise would assign a probability to every k ∈ N. Let n1 be the first positive integer
for which equation 7 holds,
P (Z ≤ n1 ) ≥ U,

The magnitude of the total delay between infection and diagnosis can be estimated through the expected
value of equation 5 (or equivalently, equation 6). A schematic representation of the proposed methodology is
presented in Figure 1. Assuming the lowest reported value for the average incubation time, tc = 5.2, and a
conservative timeframe for the delay between the appearance of symptoms, testing and diagnosing, (2–5
days), the expected delay E (Z) is about 7.5 days.

4.2. Case discharge/recovery criteria
As discussed previously, errors in the amount of discharged/recovered patients R are likely to be greater
only when no quantitative criteria are applied. In such cases, some countries (like Chile) have adopted
the following criteria (officially reported in the MINSAL (14 Apr, 2020) report), possibly based on the
recommendations published by the WHO (2020a).
7

Figure 1: Schematic representation of the temporal reclassification methodology proposed herein.

• If there were no previously existing pathologies, a patient should be discharged 14 days after testing
positive for COVID-19.
• If there were previously existing pathologies, the patient should be discharged 28 days after testing
positive for COVID-19.
This criterion turns out to be quite simplistic, especially considering the existence of uncertainties regarding
the diagnosis and contagion days. If we try to model the probability of recovering from COVID-19, some
assumptions are necessary. Let τr be the random variable for the time of discharge/recovery such that:
• P (τr ≤ 14) = 0
• P (τr ≤ 28) ≈ 1
Further assumptions are necessary to estimate the probability distribution function fτr , as it depends on
local diagnosis criteria, testing strategy, and the fraction of the population having preexisting pathologies. In
particular, depending on the test applied for diagnosis and its sensitivity/specificity – which were carefully
described in Section 2– the probability profile would change. The simplest form that can be assumed, and
which, for clarity reasons, is adopted herein, is a triangular distribution:

5. Case study: COVID-19 spreading dynamics in Chile
The spread of COVID-19 in Chile is far from being controlled, as shown by the exponential growth that
new cases have had in recent weeks (Worldometers.info, 02 Jun, 2020). In order to apply our methodology,
we need to cast predictions on the trends of ∆T . Figure 2 presents the current and forecast trends, using
an autoregression ARIMA model. These models were chosen over others because of the great success they
have had on representing COVID-19 dynamics in other relevant studies (Chakraborty and Ghosh, 2020;
Benvenuto et al., 2020).

Figure 2: Current and forecasted evolution of ∆T in Chile. The official data (blue curve) was obtained from Worldometers.info
(02 Jun, 2020), while the red curve was generated using an autoregression ARIMA model. As these reported data are likely to
be affected by several exogenous factors (Ribeiro et al., 2020), the best performance metric for the generated forecast is trend
consistency.

First, we performed a temporal reclassification of new cases to obtain ∆Tcorr , presented in Figure 3. It
can be seen that our methodology, besides exhibiting an horizontal semi-displacement, generates a smooth
curve, which is due to the inclusion of a probability function that spreads the influence of daily informed
cases in previous days (where they were most likely to have occurred). The last part of the red curve is
dashed because it partially contains contributions of the forecast of ∆T , and therefore might change in the
upcoming days, when the required data for completing the reclassification of cases would be available.
After obtaining statistically-based corrections of both ∆T and ∆R by following algorithms 1 and 2, and
knowing the daily deaths due to COVID-19 ∆D, we proceed to calculate the variation on the active cases.
Based on the closure of the population-balance of the different considered classes, the cumulative new cases
T will be the sum of active I, recovered/discharged R, and dead D, therefore their differences would follow:
∆T = ∆I + ∆R + ∆D ⇐⇒ ∆I = ∆T − (∆R + ∆D).

In the context of SEIR models, it is not possible to explicitly include exposed individuals E, as they are not

being recorded separately from COVID-19 positive new cases.
After obtaining ∆I using equation 10, we proceed to calculate Rt , using equation 1 with raw data, mobile
averages of raw data, and the methodology proposed herein. As shown in Figure 4, an abrupt growth in Rt
was evidenced around April 22nd, consistently with the relaxation of restrictive measures that were applied
in Santiago, the capital and most populated city in the country, and the apogee of the governmental plan for
a “safe return to work”. Even though different trends seem to stabilise again in the second week of May, a
lowering of the trend is not totally clear.
The different iconic dates highlighted in Figure 4 were obtained from the chronology presented in
Wikipedia.org (23 May, 2020) and references therein. From this plot, we can assess both successful and
unfortunate effects that the different governmental actions have had on the spreading dynamics of COVID-19
in Chile, and specifically in Santiago, by analyzing corrected Rt trends and comparing them with daily
reported cases. The various public-health actions were strongly based on locally-observed values from (raw)
daily reported cases, yet appear to have been taken too late, or too early, according to the statisticallycorrected trend. In particular, the apogee of the governmental plan for a safe return to work occurred in a
temporal window where raw-data-driven Rt values were at a minimum, but the corrected contagion rates
anticipated a steep growing trend for the following days.

Figure 4: Effect of data processing on the evaluation of the spread of COVID-19 through Rt . The noisy raw data (blue curve)
can be smoothed through mobile averages (dark red curve), but the trends are the same. A significantly different scenario is
shown by the statistically-corrected Rt trend (green curve). Highlighted dates associated with iconic governmental actions
in Chile: March 31st (second week of sectorised quarantine for the high-income districts of Santiago, capital of Chile), April
7th (compulsory use of facemask in public transport), April 24th (governmental call for a “safe return to work”), April 30th
(sectorised quarantine –low-income districts of Santiago–), May 15th (total quarantine in Santiago).

6. Conclusions
We have presented an exhaustive assessment of error sources in reported data of the COVID-19 pandemic
and provided a methodology to minimize –and correct– their effect on both reported variables and modelderived parameters by applying a statistically-driven reclassification of newly reported cases, and corrections
to discharge/recovery criteria. By using the corrected variables, SIR-like models could be fitted directly,
as every value would represent the real contagion dynamics. We present the methodology as a general
framework, aiming to provide a useful tool for researchers and decision-making actors looking to adapt it for
their particular interests.
In a case study on the spreading dynamics of COVID-19 in Chile, we observed the effects that different
iconic public health actions taken by the government had on SARS-CoV-2 spread rate Rt , readily calculated
using our previously reported approach, and discussed the reasons behind these effects interpreted under
the light of raw data and corrected daily contagion rates, calculated with the methodology presented in
this manuscript. The delay-induced error in raw data slowed-down the reaction time, so the actions were
taken too late for restrictive actions or too early for the comeback to normality. Our statistically-driven
method corrected such reporting errors, exposing the real contagion dynamics at a given time. The proposed
methodology also serves as a non-invasive smoothing process, as it only temporally re-sorts daily reported
12

cases according to their most likely report delay from the real contagion day.
We expect our methodology to serve as a valuable input for researchers and public health practitioners
trying to add statistical value to their calculations and predictions in order to vanquish the current SARSCoV-2 pandemic. Finally, we also expect this work to contribute in raising public awareness on the need for
a proper (and standardized) strategy for report and curation of data in the COVID-19 pandemic and other
highly-contagious diseases.
