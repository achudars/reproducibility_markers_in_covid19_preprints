Abstract—This paper aims to explore the structure of pattern
behind covid-19 dataset. The dataset includes medical images
with positive and negative cases. A sample of 100 sample is
chosen, 50 per each class. An histogram frequency is calculated
to get features using statistical measurements, besides a feature
extraction using Grey Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM).
Using both features are build Complex Networks respectively
to analyze the adjacency matrices and check the presence of
patterns. Initial experiments introduces the evidence of hidden
patterns in the dataset for each class, which are visible using
Complex Networks representation.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Covid-19 is a breakthrough in human history. It is destroying powerful economies and collapsing emerge countries.
During its early stage, the virus had a reproduction number of
4.22 in Germany and the Netherlands. Even if the developed
countries reduced the impact of the virus, in countries with
poverty and weak health systems, the virus is still a severe
problem. By consequence, many efforts are focused on finding
a vaccine, study the virus and find automatic tools to support
prognosis of the illness.
Oriented on this direction, many groups are working with
tomography, x-ray images to build a model using Artificial
Intelligence techniques, i.e. Deep Learning [1] [2] [3] At the
same time a limitation in the first months was access to images
related to covid-19 patients. Deep Learning algorithms are
based in Artificial Neural Networks with many layers and
where each layer or groups has an specific function but one
limitation is the need of great quantity of images. For the
previous reason, data augmentation is common to get artificial
images with rotation, some noise.
One approach which meaningful feature extraction which
represents internal patterns from one dataset is Complex Networks [4] [5] [6] [7], previous experiments showed the strength
of approaches using graph representation in comparison to
classical Machine Learning algorithms. The presented results
introduces the idea of good representation of the internal
patterns. Besides, it is possible to affirm that this Complex

Network representation can represent this patterns using a
small number of samples in comparison with Deep Learning.
In this paper, we propose a new technique based in Complex
Networks to identify the virus in x-ray images using high-level
algorithms to exploit the structure of the features from these
images.
II. DATA AND M ETHODS
After a search using keywords, i.e. covid-19 tomography
dataset. Many datasets were found but these are too big to
download and process later, besides a variety of image formats
are available, i.e. nii, dicom. One available dataset1 is chosen
because format png is ready for processing this images. The
image Fig. 1 presents 16 samples of positive and negative
cases respectively.

Fig. 1: Sample of Dataset
A dataset with 100 images is selected, positives and negative classes are balanced. By consequence is necessary to
find a transformation from images to Complex Networks. A
first proposal is using Frequency Histogram, because it can
reduce dimensionality and represent the distribution of pixels.
Previously, a transformation of color images is performed to
get grayscale images. Later, a proposal using GLCM is done
to get neighborhood features considering texture analysis.

A. Frequency Histogram

B. Grey Level Co-Occurrence Matrix features

Histogram frequency were calculated to have a lower
dimensionality representation and statistical features were
calculated, median, mean, standard deviation, kurtosis and
skew. This histogram is considering the three channels of
classical RGB image representation. Figure Fig. 2 represents
the histogram frequency from the previous sample of images.
Using this representation lets find a visual difference between
positive and negative cases.

Grey Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) algorithm [8]
is a second order statistical method use for texture feature
extraction. From this matrix, the next features are extracted:
Plevels−1
• contrast :
Pi,j (i − j)2
i,j
Plevels−1
• dissimilarity :
Pi,j ki − jk
i,j
Plevels−1
Pi,j
• homogenity :
1+(i−j)2
Plevels−1i,j 2
• ASM :
Pi,j
pi,j
(ASM )
• energy :
Plevels−1
(i−µi )(j−µj )
• correlation :
Pi,j sqrt(σ
2 σ2 )

Then, the creation of graph is using euclidean distance
between points of the same class, see Fig. 3. Left side
represents positive class and right, negative ones. A filtering
was performed using median of the distances, the bottom of
the image introduces the results.

Fig. 3: Characterization of dataset using Frequency Histogram

Considering previous results, using Frequency Histogram
and GLCM is possible to notice that Complex Networks
building is possible using euclidean distance. Besides, the representation of Complex Network through adjacency matrices
presents reticular patterns. This patterns are different, positive
cases presents a distribution of further or higher distances
between the nodes/elements than negative ones. By contrast,
negatives samples presents only a few link with high distances.

III. C ONCLUSIONS
An approach to represent covid-19 tomography images
using Complex Networks is feasible. The intensity of the
links represented through adjacency matrices presents a strong
difference between both classes. In spite of GLCM is a more
elaborated technique to extract neighborhood pattern from
the images, frequency histogram has a similar representation.
Although, both processes are different to create the Complex
Networks has a similar behaviour, this feature is presented
in visualization of adjacency matrices. Besides, a comparison
between Complex Networks approaches for High Level Classification will be presented.
IV. F UTURE W ORK
The authors are considering to include a higher number of
samples for each classes to have higher diversity of images.
Complex Networks representation can be leverage for High
Level Classification tasks, then experiment on that way will
be performed.
