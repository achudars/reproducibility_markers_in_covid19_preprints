Many countries are now experiencing the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic straining the
healthcare resources with an acute shortage of hospital beds and ventilators for the critically ill
patients. This situation is especially worse in India with the second largest load of COVID-19
cases and a relatively resource-scarce medical infrastructure. Therefore, it becomes essential to
triage the patients based on the severity of their disease and devote resources towards critically
ill patients. Yan et al. 1​ have published a very pertinent research that uses Machine learning
(ML) methods to predict the outcome of COVID-19 patients based on their clinical parameters at
the day of admission. They used the XGBoost algorithm, a type of ensemble model, to build the
mortality prediction model. The final classifier is built through the sequential addition of
multiple weak classifiers. The clinically operable decision rule was obtained from a ‘single-tree
XGBoost’ and used ​lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), lymphocyte and high-sensitivity C-reactive
protein (hs-CRP) values​. This decision tree achieved a 100% survival prediction and 81%
mortality prediction. However, these models have several technical challenges and do not
provide an out of the box solution that can be deployed for other populations as has been
reported in the "Matters Arising" section of Yan et al. Here, we show the limitations of this
model by deploying it on one of the largest datasets of COVID-19 patients containing detailed
clinical parameters collected from India.
Our dataset was collected as a part of a retrospective study that was conducted at two centers for
COVID-19 in New Delhi, namely, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Covid Hospital and PM Cares
Covid Care Hospital. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Covid hospital took the lead for this study and
coordinated with the other centre for data collection and analysis. The study period was from
13th July 2020 to 14th October 2020. Every case with a confirmed infection who was admitted at
any of the participating centres between this period, for treatment of COVID-19 infection was
diagnosed by a Rapid Antigen Test or RT-PCR testing of a nasal/throat swab sample. Patients of
all age groups were included in the study. Most of the data was retrieved from retrospectively
maintained medical records. The clinical classification for COVID-19 severity was defined
according to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare definition (MoHFW, Government of
India). All the hospitalized cases were followed up till discharge or death during COVID-19
illness. The primary criteria for discharge in mild/moderate hospitalized cases was the resolution
of symptoms and a minimum stay of 10 days in the absence of follow-up RT-PCR negativity.
Patients with severe infection were discharged only after clinical recovery and with a negative
RT-PCR on repeat swab after resolution of symptoms.
We tested how the model published by Yan et al performs on the above dataset of Indian
patients. Although we collected data from 841 patients, most of these patients did not undergo all
the clinical tests and, hence we did not have the clinical parameters used to sort patients based on
the decision rule presented in the paper. Many of these parameters were not collected and this
presented one of the biggest challenges in deploying ML-models in a resource-scarce
environment such as India, where these models can be most useful in terms of managing patient
load given poor doctor: patient ratio of 1:1456​2​. Only 120 patients (Table 1) had all the
parameters measured necessary in the Yan et al study, out of which 95 (79.17 %) were

discharged, and 25 (20.83%) were deceased. Of the 95 patients who had recovered, 23 (19.17%)
patients experienced mild symptoms, 42 (35%) moderate, and 30 (25%) severe. The overall
survival prediction accuracy was 65.26%, and the mortality prediction accuracy was 88%.
Individual survival prediction in the case of mild, moderate, and severe patients was 91.3%,
73.81%, and 33.33%, respectively (Figure 1).
Besides the fewer number of parameters measured from each patient, we uncovered a major
challenge. As reported previously by Reeve et al.​3​, there are two kits used in practice to measure
LDH levels based on conversion of lactate to pyruvate or vice versa. We used the later kit which
has a reference range of values of 240-480 Ul​−1​. While Yan et al most likely used the former kit
with a reference range of values of 135-250 Ul​−1​. Hence, we had to normalize the LDH values in
our dataset as shown previously​4​. This again reiterates the previous concerns ​3 about deploying
machine learning models that may require the knowledge of reference range values of the
biochemical tests performed and appropriate normalization between datasets.
We conclude that on Indian patients the decision rule by Yan et al is a good predictor of
mortality but underperforms in predicting survival of COVID-19 patients. Further, it particularly
underperforms in predicting severity of infection which is the key prediction necessary for
effective patient triage and resource allocation. Our results present an opposite trend from a
similar replication study by Quanjel et on a Dutch cohort​5​, who report good performance of the
decision rule to predict patient severity but not mortality. The discrepancy in replicating the
results from Yan et al could possibly be explained by the differences in access to medical
infrastructure between the population used for training the models, by demography (age, gender
ratio distribution), or by the differences in reference ranges of the selected parameters due to
population genetics. An observation further strengthened the conjecture regarding biases due to
population genetics. The minor allele frequencies of rs7305678, an allele that is significantly
associated with LDH serum levels​6​, were dramatically different in European, East Asian, and
South Asian (Indian) populations at 0.48, 0.13, 0.21 respectively according to the 1000 Genomes
Project​7,8​. We propose that other yet genetic factors may also influence quantitative traits such as
biochemical parameter values between different populations. These differences may also
manifest as differences in patient mortality rates which are quite different between countries such
as India has a mortality rate at about 1.5%, while China has a mortality rate at about 3.8% 9​​ .
Therefore, our results suggest that machine learning models being developed to predict patient
outcomes, especially those predicting large scale clinical manifestation in pandemics, need to
take into account the biases in the collected feature values such as technical variability in
biochemical parameters, population genetics, demography, and other socio-economic factors in
healthcare.
