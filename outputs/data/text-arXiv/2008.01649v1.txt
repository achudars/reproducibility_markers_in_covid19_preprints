Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has generated disruptive changes in many fields. Here we focus
on the relationship between the anxiety felt by people during the pandemic and the trust
in the future performance of financial markets. Precisely, we move from the idea that the
volume of Google searches about “coronavirus” can be considered as a proxy of the anxiety
and, jointly with the stock index prices, can be used to produce mood indicators – in terms
of pessimism and optimism – at country level. We analyse the “very high human developed
countries” according to the Human Development Index plus China and their respective main
stock market indexes. Namely, we propose both a temporal and a global measure of pessimism
and optimism and provide accordingly a classification of indexes and countries.
The results show the existence of different clusters of countries and markets in terms of pessimism and optimism. Moreover, specific regimes along the time emerge, with an increasing
optimism spreading during the mid of June 2020. Furthermore, countries with different government responses to the pandemic have experienced different levels of mood indicators, so
that countries with less strict lockdown had a higher level of optimism.

Introduction

The world is experiencing the rapid and dramatic widespread of COVID-19 [14, 22] – a pandemic
generated by a coronavirus – with millions of infected and a large number of deaths. Beyond
the sanitary aspects of such an infectious disease, one of the main concerns experienced by the
community regards the economic impact of the measures taken for contrasting the virus.
The individuals’ behaviours are at the core of the interest of many scientific studies given that,
those behaviours are the critical variables to understand the perspective of many economic activities. Several businesses require the physical interactions among the involved actors – and such
interactions have been reduced by the lockdown policies and by the natural attitude of people
avoiding possible sources of contagion – while virtual connections allow another set of economic
relevant activities, such as investing in financial markets. Interestingly, [9] provides a brief discussion on the reactions of the financial markets to rare catastrophic events of non-financial nature.
The author points the attention of the readers to the plausible parallelisms between pandemics
and natural disasters, terrorist attacks and even nuclear conflict. Less recently, [13] elaborate on
how aviation disasters can generate a decline in stock market prices. In general, empirical evidence
prove that prices collapse in concomitance to rare and unexpected disasters (see, e.g. [2, 7, 10]).
On the same line, but in a broader perspective, several authoritative studies highlight that anxiety
and negative mood might increase investors’ risk aversion, hence leading to the collapse of stock
prices (see, e.g. [1, 11, 12, 4]).
Therefore, the financial distress we are observing in the international stock markets can be
reasonably interpreted through the anxiety of people, whose worries for the pandemic disease
affect the expectation of financial markets future performance.
This paper enters this debate. Specifically, it explores how the anxiety for COVID-19 mirrors
the strategies of investing/disinvesting money in financial markets. In particular, we discuss the
relationship between anxiety for COVID-19 and the view of financial markets, with the particular
aim of investigating optimism and pessimism. The analysis is carried out by dealing with the
country-level moods. We explore the relationship mentioned above for a large set of countries,
to derive the different behaviours of the populations. [6] and [3] are remarkably relevant for
contextualizing our study. The authors discuss the economic anxiety stemmed from coronavirus.
[3] conducts a survey study of over 500 US consumers and shows that the serious concern about
coronavirus implications leads to pessimistic expectations about macroeconomic turnaround via
deterioration of the economic fundamentals. [6] complement [3]’s perspective by including also
the time dimension and the causal effect of the pandemic on the increased economic anxiety. The
methodological ground of [6] lies on the meaningfulness of Google Trends data, which are assumed

2

to give in-depth information on the development of the anxiety in the specific context of the
economic outcomes. We adopt [6]’s view and hypothesize that anxiety for COVID-19 is proxied
by the irrepressible persistence of related Google searches. In so doing, we also follow [15], where a
survey study over a large number of respondents confirms that media exposure and online searches
are good predictors of the increasing fear of coronavirus (in this, see also the review paper by [8]).
In details, we collect and compare two different datasets over the same reference period which
goes from January 6th , 2020 to the June 19th , 2020. By one side, we consider the daily Google
Trends data. Specifically, we examine for the searches volumes of the word “coronavirus” along
with its translations for different countries and respective most spoken languages. Data retrieved at
a country level allows for sounding out similarities and discrepancies in the searching for information
practised by users in need of awareness. In our approach, such a compulsive searching is intended
as a proxy for the anxiety generated by the pandemic. On the other side, we consider the daily
levels of the main stock indexes, which include companies related to the considered countries.
The source of financial data is Datastream. In order to have a reliable and consistent dataset,
countries are chosen by using the Human Development Index (HDI) embraced by the United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in the Human Development Report Office to rank
countries on the basis of their human development. Specifically, we select the areas having an
HDI index greater than 0.8 calculated with the 2018 information. The choice of 0.8 as a threshold
is appropriate because all the countries having at least that level can be considered as “very
high human developed countries”. It ensures a good enough level of connections between sociofinancial entities within the countries, namely it guarantees the incorporation of the necessary
links between citizens’ cognitions of the problems, ability to get informed about them and financial
strategies designer presence. To such a list of nations, we add China, which is ranked below the 0.8
thresholds – specifically, 0.75. We reasonably do so because China is central in the phenomenon
under investigation. Moreover, the countries without data on stock exchanges in our source –
which is Datastream – have been obviously excluded from the list.
We move our steps from [6] in two main respects: first, the quoted paper deals with topics in
Google Trends, and we deal with one crucial word. In so doing, we have a translation task to face –
as also acknowledged by [6]. Nevertheless, the use of one word allows to obtain intuitive results and
is far from being restrictive in our context. Indeed, a preliminary inspection of the Google Trends
data shows that the considered word is the most relevant trend related to the current pandemic;
second, the quoted paper derives information about economic anxiety directly by Google Trends.
Differently, we here start from the idea that the anxiety is manifested through the Google searches
of the word “coronavirus” (and its translations), but then we move to the real performance of the
financial markets, to assess the links with the trust on them.
3

Some distance measures between time series have been suitably introduced to offer a wide
perspective on the connections between the considered data. We consider concepts of distance
focusing on specific dates and offering global information on the entire reference period. All the
proposed measures range in the unitary interval [0, 1], hence letting the comparative analysis of
different countries be possible.
Several interesting results emerge. Countries and markets can be properly clustered in terms of
their mood during the pandemic period. Regularities and deviations at individual week level can
be also identified. Moreover, the analysis of the daily variations of the levels of anxiety and trust
in financial markets gives insights on countries behaviors in the overall period. A general trend
of pessimism is concentrated in early and mid March, when the lockdown have been adopted by
many countries and the international community started to reckon the severity of the problem. A
focus on some noticeable cases of hard and weak lockdown policies has been also presented. In this
respect, countries with a stricter lockdown have a more persistent and higher level of pessimism.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the employed dataset, by
providing also details on the data collection procedure. Section 3 illustrates the methodological
devices used for the study. Section 4 outlines and discusses the results of the analysis. Last section
concludes.

Data

We now present the employed data. As we will see in detail below, the considered dataset is
associated with the Google Trends and to the financial markets at country level. As a premise, we
have to say that data on financial markets are not always available; moreover, the access to the
web is not a reliable issue is some realities. Thus, we focus on a set of countries whose data are
unbiased and reliable. At this aim – and for providing a consistent analysis – we have used the
Human Development Index (HDI) adopted by United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)’s
Human Development Report Office. HDI is a composite index made of factors like life expectancy,
education, per capita income indicators and other relevant factors whose details are recollected in
[17] by Mahbub ul Haq, one of the two designers of the index. HDI is used to rank countries on
the basis of human development. We take all the countries defined as “very high human developed
countries”, namely those having an HDI index greater than 0.8. The selection is based on data
from 2018, Table 1 of [18]. China is added to the considered countries – even if the HDI of China
is 0.75 – because of its centrality in the COVID-19 propagation; the first known human infections
were in China.
The respective most used language is associated with each of these countries. Then, by means

4

of Google Translate, the word “coronavirus” is translated from English to each of those languages.
In so doing, we obtain the translations reported in Table 1.
The translated terms are employed to download the web searches indicator from Google Trends.
Namely, for each country, one looks for the searches of the respective “coronavirus” translations.
In this way, the magnitude of the searches by country is obtained employing the words translated
in the country most common language. The period investigated goes from January 6th , 2020 to
June 19th , 2020.

At the end of this process, one gets a matrix of time series regarding 63 countries. In our
analysis, we are interested in examining the time series of the searches from the first day in which
a relevant volume of researches is recorded in each country – i.e., in the first day in which Google
Trends offers a nonnull value – for the respective translated terms. See columns one, two and three
of Table 1 and Figure 1 to have an idea of the main trends in the data. The most evident point
regards the high volume of searches occurred during the same days around mid-March 2020.
We associate at least one stock market index with each country of the list mentioned above.
Per each index, the closing prices are downloaded from Thomson Reuters Datastream. The time
span is defined by the same criterion adopted in collecting the Google Trends data (see Table 2 and
Figure 2), so that one has the same time span. Andorra, Bahamas, Barbados, Belarus, Brunei,
Liechtenstein, Palau, Seychelles and Uruguay do not have a stock market index of reference in
our data source, so we exclude them. The final list of considered countries contains 54 elements.
Furthermore, we align the Google Trends data and the financial data so that, for each day in
which prices are recorded, the volume of web searches can be used in the analysis. Consequently,
because the financial markets are closed during non-trading days, Google Trends data is reduced
accordingly. As a reference for the number of observation, one can look at column “N. Obs.” in
Table 2.

Methodology

To face the problem, we design indicators able to capture the connection between anxiety for
the pandemic and expectations on the future outcomes of financial markets. The underling idea
relates to the synchronicity between increments and decrements of Google searches and of stock
index levels, so that, increasing (decreasing) volumes of searches and decreasing (increasing) prices
are associate to pessimistic (optimistic) moods.
To describe the employed methodology, some notation is needed.
We denote the number of considered countries by J – and J is 54 for us, see Section 2 – and

its translations in the respective most spoken language for each country. The indents give a clear
view of the beginning of the interest in COVID-19 for each country.

label the generic country by j = 1, . . . , J. Each country hosts K financial markets. The number
of financial markets depends on the selected country, so that one should write K = K(j). Such
a dependence will be omitted when not necessary. Often, K > 1 – i.e. the most part of the
considered countries is associated to more than one financial market. However, there are cases of
countries with K = 1. The generic financial market is k = 1, . . . , K.
As already discussed in Section 2, we have daily data on prices and Google searches of the
word “coronavirus” (and its translations) in a common reference period of T days. For country j,
we denote the available time series of the prices of the stock index k by pjk = (pjk (1), . . . , pjk (T )).
Analogously, the sample of the Google searches for country j is wj = (wj (1), . . . , wj (T )).
Notice that the range of variation of the components of pjk and wj are different. Indeed, pjk
has nonnegative components, while the components of wj are integer numbers ranging in [0, 100],
and there exists t̄ such that wj (t̄) = 100. Time t̄ represents the day with the maximum level
of searches over the period [1, T ], and depends naturally on j. Also such a dependence will be
conveniently omitted. The minimum value of the elements of wj is not necessarily null. Indeed,
null search means absence of interest for the considered word in country j – i.e., null amount of
Google searches; such an occurrence does not necessarily appear over the period [1, T ]. Assigning
value 100 to the highest daily flow of Google searches over [1, T ] and null value to null searches
allows the easy normalization – implemented directly by the Google Trends algorithm – of the
Google search data in the range [0, 100].
For better comparisons, we impose the variation range [0, 100] also to the series pjk for each j
and k through a simple normalization procedure. We denote the normalized series of the prices by
p̄jk .
First of all, we identify t̄ ∈ {1, . . . , T } such that pjk (t̄) = max{pjk (t) : t = 1, . . . , T }. Then, we
set p̄jk (t̄) = 100. Null price is associated to zero value for the normalized series, so that we set
p̄jk (t) = 0 when pjk (t) = 0. Evidently, one can have pjk (t) > 0 for each t = 1, . . . , T , so that one has
p̄jk (t) > 0 for each t.
The entire series can be derived as follows

p̄k (t) = 100 × j

where [•] is the integer part of the real number •.
The exploration and comparison of financial data and Google Trends will proceed at country level; it will be implemented by conceptualizing suitable distance measures, under different
perspectives. In so doing, we provide several insights on countries regularities and discrepancies.

3.1

Time-dependent distance measures

We first build a distance measures based on the comparison between the time-dependent normalized
accumulations of prices and Google searches. We consider t1 , t2 ∈ {1, . . . , T } with t1 ≤ t2 and define
#

where
Wj =

P̄kj =

(2)

p̄jk (t).

t=1

By construction, it results Aj ([t1 , t2 ]; k) ∈ [0, 1]. A high value of Aj ([t1 , t2 ]; k) means that [t1 , t2 ] is
a time period with a high percentage of price of market k and a low percentage of Google searches
– where percentages have to be intended in terms of the total amount on the overall period. Thus,
Aj ([t1 , t2 ]; k) close to one means that [t1 , t2 ] is an optimistic period. Differently, Aj ([t1 , t2 ]; k) is
close to zero when prices are relatively low and Google searches of the word “coronavirus” are
relatively high. In this case, [t1 , t2 ] is a time interval where country j has experienced anxiety
about COVID-19 and lack of trust in market k.
Notice that the case t1 = 1 and t2 = T is trivial and not interesting, being Aj ([1, T ]; k) = 1/2
for each j and k – i.e., in the middle (fair) situation between optimism and pessimism. Indeed,
[1, T ] is the entire period, hence being associated to full percentage of prices and Google searches.
More reasonably, the proper selection of t1 and t2 allows to explore elements of the considered
sample in relevant subperiods.
At a country level, we can average the Aj ’s in (2) with respect to the markets. In particular,
we define
Aj ([t1 , t2 ]) =

K(j)
1 X
Aj ([t1 , t2 ]; k).
K(j)

(3)

k=1

We observe that Aj ([t1 , t2 ]) ∈ [0, 1], and all the comments reported above remain valid for the
indicator presented in (3).

3.2

Global distance measures

We here compare the considered series on the basis of the signs of their daily variations. Specifically,
we assess how often an increase (a decrease) of the Google searches is associated to a decrease (an
increase) of the prices of the financial markets. The entity of the daily variation is also taken into
account.
Consistently with our framework, we refer hereafter to a generic series x = (x(1), . . . , x(T )),
whose components range in [0, 100].

8

Thus, given a threshold ζ ∈ [0, 100] and t = 1, . . . , T − 1, we define the sign variation of the
series x between t and t + 1 at the threshold ζ as follows:


1,
if x(t + 1) − x(t) > ζ;



(ζ)
δt (x) =
0,
if −ζ ≤ x(t + 1) − x(t) ≤ ζ;




−1, if x(t + 1) − x(t) < −ζ.

(4)

The parameter ζ is fixed a-priori; it represents the entity of the daily variation to be crossed
for stating that the series have an increase (or a decrease, by taking the variation with negative
(0)

sign) from time t − 1 to time t. Evidently, the case ζ = 0 leads to δt (x) = 1 when x(t + 1) > x(t),
(0)

(0)

δt (x) = −1 when x(t + 1) < x(t) and δt (x) = 0 when x(t + 1) = x(t).
The comparison between the behaviors of the Google searches and of the financial markets can
be performed at country level by means of the δ’s defined in (4).
For each j = 1, . . . , J, we compare the series wj with p̄jk , for each k = 1, . . . , K(j).
We define
(ζ)

(ζ)

∆(ζ) (t, j, k) = δt (wj ) − δt (p̄jk ).

(5)

By definition, the ∆’s in (5) can take values in {−2, −1, 0, 1, 2}. Such values have specific meanings
and deserve an interpretation.
When ∆(ζ) (t, j, k) = −2, then we observe a decrease of the Google searches related to “coronavirus” and an increase of the price of the financial market k. This case has a clear interpretation
in terms of optimism. Indeed, people show a decreasing anxiety for the pandemic disease – they
weaken the amount of searches on the Google – and, simultaneously, exhibit an increasing interest
in investing in the financial market. The value -1 is associated to constant Google searches and
increase of the price or decreasing level of Google searches and invariant price. The value 0 is
related to the cases of identical behavior between Google searches and price, so that they can be
invariant between date t and t + 1 or both of them can increase/decrease. The value +1 relies to
increasing level of Google searches and invariant price or, alternatively, a constant level of Google
searches and decreasing price. The value +2 describes the situation in which Google searches grow
and price decrease. This is the other corner case, in which anxiety and sadness for the spread of
the disease – mirroring in the growth of Google searches – is associated to decreasing amount of
investments in the financial market.
In general, the positive values of the ∆’s describe situations of pessimism, captured by anxiety
for the disease and decrease of investments in the financial markets. Conversely, the cases of
negative ∆’s are related to optimism, with decreasing interest for COVID-19 and growing attention
for the future evolutions of financial markets.
Some distance measures with high information content can be derived by (5).
9

We measure the aggregated connection between the considered trend in Google and the price
of market k in country j over the considered period by defining
"T −1

(ζ)
(ζ)
Hj (k) =
∆ (t, j, k) + 2(T − 1) .

(6)

(ζ)

By construction, Hj (k) ∈ [0, 1]. If such an indicator approaches zero, then people in country j
tend to the highest level of optimism – in the sense expressed when discussed the case of -2 as
value of the ∆’s – when analyzing the Google searches of the considered word and its connections
(ζ)

with the price of financial market k. The converse situation appears when Hj (k) is close to one,
where we are in presence of a high level of pessimism and anxiety.
By averaging the Hj ’s in (6) with respect to k we obtain an indicator describing the reality
at country level, for all the connections between the considered word and the prices of financial
markets, as follows:

(7)

(ζ)

Clearly, Hj

∈ [0, 1] and the arguments above – opportunely rephrased at country level – remain

valid.
We now provide a measure of how a specific country has experienced optimism versus pessimism
over the considered period. At this aim, we consider a ratio indicator as follows:

where

(8)


 1, if • is true;
1(•) =
 0, otherwise.
(ζ)

By construction, Rj (k) ∈ [0, 1]. For country j and when referring to market k, there is a
high percentage of optimistic days with respect to pessimistic ones as the value of such indicator
approaches zero, while we are in a substantial context of pessimism when the indicator in (8) is
(ζ)

close to one. The corner cases have a clear interpretation: when Rj (k) = 0, then all the days
in the considered period present a decreasing anxiety for COVID-19 coupled with an increasing
(ζ)

trust in market k; differently, Rj (k) = 1 is associated to an entire period of increasing need of
awareness on COVID-19 and decreasing price of market k.
Also in this case, we can focus on country j by averaging the Rj ’s over the markets:

10

The global distance measures presented above capture two different aspects of the phenomenon
(ζ)

under analysis. Hj

(ζ)

and Hj (k) provide information on the mood as an average of the ∆’s over
(ζ)

(ζ)

all the days of the considered sample. Differently, Rj (k) and Rj

focus only on the dates where

the daily variations of searches volumes and stock index levels have had discordant behaviors.
Namely, the indicators R’s offer more details on the ratio between fully optimistic days and fully
pessimistic ones, i.e. on the proportion of the days in which the Google searches have decreased
and the indexes prices have increased and those with an increase of searches and a decrease of the
prices.

Results and discussion

The normalised time series of the stock indexes prices are obtained via Eq. (1). The outcome of
such a normalisation is presented in Figure 2 and the main statistical indicators of both the original
and the normalised time series are showed in Table 2. The visual inspection of this Figure allows
the reader to confirm the general trends of the markets, with a decline inducted by incorporation
of the pandemic effects. Figure 1 and Table 1 show the increased Google searches of the translated
“coronavirus” in different countries. The searching activities started at a different time and with
a general delay with respect to the decline recorded in the financial markets.
As a preliminary comment, we notice that the Moreover, the Aj ’s in Eq. (2) and (3) compare
the normalised values of Google searches and prices, while the Hj ’s in Eq. (6) and (7) and the
Rj ’s in Eq. (8) and (9) compare their daily increments and decrements. Thus, the Aj ’s offer a
view of the snapshots of anxiety for COVID-19 and trust in financial markets; differently, the Hj ’s
and the Rj ’s propose an evolutive perspective on the daily variations of the Google search and the
stock market data.
In computing the index Aj ([t1 , t2 ]; k) in Eq. (2), we take t2 − t1 constantly equal to five days,
hence studying the weekly behaviour of the index. The outcomes per each index are summarized in
Figure 4 and Table 3. Moreover, the results of Aj ([t1 , t2 ]) across the stock indexes of each country
– namely, those in Eq. (3) – are reported in Figure 5 and Table 4. From this view, some facts
emerge:
• The paths have drastically changed between the 7th and the 8th weeks of the year, namely
between 17/02/2020 and 01/03/2020. This is the period during which the international
community started to take the situation seriously despite the controversial statements of
national governments’ heads. On 11/03/2020, WHO’s Director declared “WHO has been
assessing this outbreak around the clock and we are deeply concerned both by the alarming
levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction. We have therefore made
11

first day in which relevant volumes of Google searches in that country are recorded.

12

the assessment that COVID-19 can be characterised as a pandemic.” [19].
• Greece and South Korea have spent more than 90% of the analysed weeks in a quite positive
mood, namely reporting an Aj ([t1 , t2 ]) > 0.5.
• Cyprus and Iceland have experienced mild pessimism on a quite large number of weeks. They
present Aj ([t1 , t2 ]) < 0.5 at least 40% of the times in the studied period.
• Weeks 10 and 11 are characterized by the lowest average of Aj ([t1 , t2 ]). Their means across
the countries are respectively 0.485 and 0.483.
• The highest number of countries experiencing a Aj ([t1 , t2 ]) < 0.5 is met on week 11. During the period 16/03/2020 - 20/03/2020, 81% of the analysed countries experienced a high
volume of Google searches and a low level of normalised prices. Therefore, a high level of
anxiety/pessimism. On the other hands, the tails (weeks 1-4 and 20-24) present a higher
level of the index, with an increased presence of positivism in most of the countries during
the most recent weeks.
In Table 5 the considered countries are week-wise ranked by using Aj ([t1 , t2 ]). Montenegro holds
the first position for five weeks. Similarly, we observe that Greece, Iceland and Malta seat on the
firsts four positions most of the times. This outcome suggests that these countries experienced
waves of optimism and pessimism; interestingly, for the quoted countries, consecutive weeks may
have a large discrepancy in the ranking positions. Thus, one can say that the waves are of impulsive
and compulsive nature – perhaps, they are driven by news on the pandemic or statements of the
Governments – and this leads to sudden changing of the people’s behaviour in searching on Google
and taking positions in the market.
We also propose a focus of weekly rankings of some paradigmatic cases: Sweden, Iceland and
South Korea – the countries with an easy lockdown, see [20, 21, 16] – and Italy, UK, USA and
China – which are countries having or having had a harder lockdown. By inspecting Figure 6,
one can appreciate that the countries having experienced an easier lockdown have spent more
optimistic moods during the recent weeks.
The results show some regularities in the behavior across countries and indexes, as Figures 4
and 5 clearly testify. An initial phase of optimism was probably induced by skeptic statements
from national governments and media agencies; in fact, the emergence has been underestimated by
a large number of people at its inception, see [5]. Then, once the situation has escalated, Google
searches have drastically increased (see Figure 3) and the markets have simultaneously reacted,
plausibly also in the light of the lockdown policies implemented all over the world. The raised
pessimism is represented in Figure 4 and 5 by the blue bands in weeks 10-15. A general relief
13

came in after that. In a few cases, the anxiety boosted from the very beginning. This is clearly
the case for Iceland, Malaysia, Malta and more mildly for Singapore, see Figure 5 and Table 5.
Considering week 24th , the stock indexes and so the countries reporting the highest level of Aj
in (3) are Greece, Iceland and Malta, with values 0.527, 0.524, 0.523, respectively. On the other
hand, those having the lowest values are Montenegro, Bahrain and Singapore with 0.508, 0.507
and 0.504, respectively.
Figure 6 offers a comparison of the weekly rank of the countries – on the basis of Aj ([t1 , t2 ]) –
having experienced an easy (upper panel) and hard (lower panel) lockdown. In general, countries
with a stricter lockdown seem to show globally a more pervasive pessimistic moods than those
with a weaker lockdown. In particular, one can notice the presence of common waves of optimism
(low rank) and pessimism (high rank) over the considered period. Importantly, there is an evident
countertendency among some countries, with opposite moods in peculiar subperiods. Indeed,
Iceland, South Korea and Sweden show pessimism at the beginning of the pandemic and optimism
for the rest of the period, with a spike of pessimism around week 15-16. For China, UK, Italy and
USA the situation is more scattered, but there is optimism at the beginning for UK, Italy and
USA, a substantial pessimism of all the considered countries in the last part of the period. China
and Italy seem to follow analogous patterns in the late part of the period; a possible explanation
can be found in the strict collaboration between such countries during the lockdown, which can be
seen as the driver of a common mood.
Eqs. (6) and (8) allows getting the global distance measures considering different levels of
ζ, which is the threshold used to capture the variations of the observed series on a daily basis.
Specifically, we use ζ = 0, 1, . . . , 50.
(ζ)

The results for Hj (k) (see Eq. 6) are reported in Figure 7 and Table 6.
Financial markets show quite similar behaviours in their links with the Google Trends, mainly
(ζ)

in the maximum values of Hj (k). Indeed, the variation range in the maxima is 0.502-0.530,
with Bahrain’s stock indexes being outliers with 0.551 and 0.567. However, there are noticeable
(ζ)

differences in the minimum values of the Hj (k), with a variation range 0.400-0.498. Notice the
(ζ)

differences appearing also within the same country, like for the minima of the Hj (k) for the US
– with NYSE COMPOSITE at 0.468 and NASDAQ 100 and NASDAQ COMPOSITE at 0.403.
The averaged results at country level of Eq. (7) are shown in Figure 8 and Table 7.
Some cases are particularly interesting and can be noticed by visual inspecting the results:
(ζ)

• Latvia, Montenegro, Norway, Denmark and Canada have a vast majority of Hj

> 0.5

manifesting a high average level of simultaneous Google searches growths and stock indexes
(ζ)

declines. Across the ζs used in calculating Hj (k), such an occurrence appears at least in

14

the 90% of the cases.
(ζ)

• Malta have 92% of Hj

< 0.5, representing an average low level of decreasing Google searches

and stock indexes increments at the same time.
(ζ)

• The highest value of Hj

occurs in Bahrain, with 0.559, for ζ = 0. This finding is in
(ζ)

agreement with those discussed already for Hj (k) above.
(ζ)

• The smallest value of Hj

occurs in Italy, with 0.400, for ζ = 0.

(ζ)

The Rj (k) in Eq. (8) are reported in Figure 9 and Table 8.
(ζ)

The variation range in the maxima for the case of Rj (k) is 0.5 – 0.565, with Bahrain’s stock
indexes having the highest values. Differences in the minimum values are noticeable as well, and
the variation range goes from 0.421 to 0.5. The lowest value is associated with Italy’s index once
again. Remarkable differences appear for the markets within the same country, in the specific case
(ζ)

of Rj (k); the USA is again one of the most remarkable examples of a wide variation range at a
stock market level.
The results at country level are presented in Figure 10 and Table 9; they have been calculated
through Eq. (9). The most relevant facts are listed below:
(ζ)

• Qatar has the highest percentage of ζs such that Rj

> 0.5, namely 19.6%; therefore, it

is the country having contemporaneous increases in Google searches and decreases in stock
index prices for a large number of thresholds ζs. Belgium, Spain and France follow, with
(ζ)

17.6% of the ζs leading to Rj

in the range (0.5,1].

• Greece, Malaysia, Argentina and New Zealand have the highest percentages of ζs such that
(ζ)

Rj

< 0.5, with the first two countries having 11.8% of the observations falling within [0,0.5)

and the latest two ones having a proportion of 9.8%.
(ζ)

• The lowest value of Rj

occurs in Italy, with 0.421, for ζ = 0.

(ζ)

• The highest value of Rj

occurs in Bahrain, with 0.565, for ζ = 0.

By looking at the global distances measures, the case of ζ = 0 is the most relevant to be
commented for the information carried out. In such a case, the proposed indexes are sensible to the
smallest daily variation. Bahrain, Malta, Israel, Cyprus, United Arab Emirates, Singapore, Oman
(ζ=0)

and Japan have Hj

> 0.5. Thus, these countries have experienced on average a great level of

anxiety for COVID-19 and a small trust in the financial markets future performances. Differently,
Italy, Canada, Lithuania, Germany, United Kingdom and Spain have the lowest positions, with
(ζ=0)

Hj

< 0.5. In such countries, an optimistic mood seems to be preponderant, on average. Notice

15

that such a list of “optimistic moods” contains highly developed countries with a noticeable spread
of the pandemic. Reasonably, optimism is linked to the confidence of the citizens of the most
developed countries either in finance as well as in the health care infrastructures, in the light of
solving a so pervasive problem like a widespread pandemic.
(ζ=0)

For the case of Rj

< 0.5, the lowest positions are held by Russia, Switzerland, Lithuania,

Romania, Germany and Italy. So, these countries that have experienced a large number of days of
contemporaneous decreases in Google searches and increases in stock index prices. Bahrain, Israel,
(ζ=0)

Japan, Singapore, Oman, Malta and Iceland are the countries with Rj
for

(ζ=0)
Hj

and

(ζ=0)
Rj

> 0.5. Of course, results

are often overlapping, and some countries confirm their general mood when

the comparison between fully optimistic days and fully pessimistic ones is performed. Interestingly,
we find that in places where the pandemic has being managed quite brightly, the general feelings
have been more pessimistic than optimistic (see e.g. the case of Israel).

Conclusions

The study investigates the relationship between the Google search volumes of “coronavirus” and
the stock index prices of different markets. The analysis is carried out at country level; thus,
the word “coronavirus” has been opportunely translated, when needed. Such analysis allows for
mapping interrelationships between COVID-19 anxiety in nations and lack of trust in stock markets
future performance. These aspects are related to the uncertainty surrounding the evolution of the
pandemic and expectations about its effects. In our framework, we follow [6] and hypothesize that
anxiety is manifested via the intensity of the searches run on Google related to the virus.
The proposed indicators allow to capture changes in moods along the time – for the case of
the Aj ’s in (2) and (3) – and permit also classification of markets and countries under a more
global perspective on the overall period – see the Hj ’s in (6) and (7) and the Rj ’s in (8) and (9).
Moreover, the Aj ’s compare the values of Google searches and prices, while the Hj ’s and the Rj ’s
compare the daily increments/decrements of such quantities.
For a fair treatment of the considered dataset, we have taken only “very high human developed

countries with HDI greater than 0.8 but without a stock exchange have been removed from the
list.
The study allows having a panoramic view of the evolution of the pandemic, its effects on the
behaviour of people and its impact on financial markets. Furthermore, the country-level approach
gives insights on similarities and discrepancies of the different populations in respect of the link
between the anxiety for COVID-19 and the expectations about stock markets performance.
