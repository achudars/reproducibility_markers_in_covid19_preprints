A BSTRACT
A practical algorithm has been developed for closeness analysis of sequential data that combines
closeness testing with algorithms based on the Markov chain tester. It was applied to reported
sequential data for COVID-19 to analyze the evolution of COVID-19 during a certain time period
(week, month, etc.).

1 Introduction
The COVID-19 coronavirus has spread worldwide, and as of May 31, 2021, the number of confirmed cases was
170M, and the number of deaths was 3.54M. A fourth wave of infections due to the emergence of variants with strong
infectivity began hitting a number of countries in Spring 2021. Coping with a worldwide pandemic like the COVID-19
one requires understanding the infection situation. This requires development of techniques for analyzing the various
types of sequential data that are available. These data include the number of confirmed infections, the number of
deaths, and the number of polymerase chain reaction tests and rapid antigen tests by location and time.
As the availability of various types of data has increased in recent years, faster and more sample-efficient algorithms
have been developed for statistical testing. In particular, for data collected by sensors, closeness testing of distributions
to infer information from the underlying probability distributions is rapidly evolving[5, 3, 6]. Wolfer and Kontorovich,
for example, developed an identity tester that determines whether sequential data represented by two Markov chains
are identical[15]. Although the theory is quite rich in this area, there have been few reports of proposed algorithms
being tested on actual applications or of simulation studies. Moreover, the algorithms are suitable only for discrete
distributions, so a quantization technique is needed to transform continuous distributions into discrete ones. Canonne
and Wimmer discussed the difficulties inherent in binning and segmentation and their limitations[4].
We have developed a practical algorithm for closeness analysis of sequential data by combining distribution testing
and algorithms based on Wolfer and Kontorovich’s identity tester [15]. We tested it by using it to analyze the evolution
of COVID-19 during a certain time period (week, month, etc.).
In the following section, we briefly describe related work on distribution testing and Markov chain testing. Our
analysis methods are described in section 3, and their usage for analyzing spatio-temporal data like that for COVID-19
is described in section 4. We discuss the testing sensitivity in section 5 and conclude with a summary of the key points
in section 6.

2.1 Distribution testing
Distribution testing typically involves three types of problems: the uniform testing problem, the identity testing problem, and the closeness testing problem. Let D be a distribution over a (countable) domain Ω. The uniform testing
problem is to determine whether D = UΩ (the uniform distribution on Ω) or the distance between D and UΩ is far
from ε ∈ (0, 1) (ε-far) [1, 7, 9]. The identity testing problem is to determine whether D = D∗ (a fixed distribution
over Ω) or D is ε-far from D∗ [12, 11]. The closeness testing problem is to determine whether D and D′ (another
distribution on Ω) are equal or ε-far from each other [2, 13]. Here, we focus on closeness testing as it is useful for
analyzing the the COVID-19 situation. The resulting problem is as follows.
Given sample access to distributions D and D′ over Ω, and bounds η1 ≥ 0, η2 > 0, δ ∈ (0, 1), distinguish with
probability at least 1 − δ between d1 (D, D′ ) ≤ η1 and d2 (D, D′ ) ≥ η2 whenever D, D′ satisfy one of these
two inequalities.
Here, d1 and d2 are the distances between two distributions. Depending on the purpose of the analysis, the total
variation distance, l2 , the χ2 distance, or the Hellinger distance are generally used as d1 and d2 in distribution testing.
The total variation distance is standard, and the properties of the other two distances have been theoretically and
comparatively studied [6]. The χ2 -type statistics defined by Chan et al. [5] are used here.
2.2 Markov chain testing
Learning and testing discrete distributions has been a hot research area, especially for sample complexity problems
in identity testing and closeness testing[3]. Most of the work in this area has relied on independent and identically
distributed (iid) sample testing, which is based on an unrealistic assumption. Emergent work has started to address the
three testing problems described above, especially for data generated from a finite Markov chain (e.g., [14, 15]). Since
COVID-19 data observations are obviously not iid in time and space, we assume here that the observed proportions
π (where the distribution D is estimated by π) are generated by a Markov chain over a discrete state space [s] =
{s1 , . . . , sB }; this means that it verifies the Markovian property
P (πt = sj | πt−1 = si ) = pij , for all t,
(1)
where pij denotes the transition probability from state si to state sj . Given an observed trajectory π = (π0 , . . . , πT )
from some unknown Markov chain up to time T , we are interested in learning the transition probabilities from only
this trajectory. Two strategies can be adopted for Markov chain testing: (i) naive use of distribution testing techniques
(closeness testing, identity testing, and so on) for conditional transition probability comparison and (ii) less obvious
comparison of the stationary distributions of the two Markov chains. With the first strategy, the discrete conditional
probability distributions pi. = (pi1 , . . . , piB ) and qi. = (qi1 , . . . , qiB ) as defined in (1) are compared for each fixed
state si . With the second strategy, this technique needs existence conditions through mixing time concept.
Wolfer and Kontorovich’s identity tester [15] constructs a tester T that can determine whether a given trajectory was
generated from an unknown ergodic Markov chain M having B states. They showed that the tester can determine with
a probability of at least 1 − δ whether the sample trajectory was generated from M or ε-far from M .

3 Analysis methods using distribution testing and Markov chain testing
Focusing on COVID-19, we investigated whether the pandemic evolved in the same way in different regions and for
different segments of the population. We tested three analysis methods based on distribution testing and Markov chain
testing that can be applied to the spatio-temporal data of COVID-19 and potentially any novel coronavirus.
1. Closeness analysis
2. Periodical evolution analysis
3. Key factor analysis
In the following sections, we first formulate the problem and then describe these analysis methods.
3.1 Observation model formulation
S
Let us consider a population P and suppose that P = Pl , where {Pl }l=1,...,L is a certain segment of the population.
This segment can be linked to geographic regions, socio-demographics categories, age, and other relevant auxiliary

variables. We are interested in monitoring the dynamic distribution of a coronavirus like COVID-19. We are especially
interested in the evolution of the distribution Dl (t) of the number of infected people in population Pl at time t.
Our testing framework is applicable to only discrete distributions, so we need to quantize the state space into B bins.
Let us denote the discretized states as [s] = {s1 , . . . , sB } (in the univariate case), and discretization of the interval
[0, pmax ], where pmax is the maximum allowed proportion (in the experiments, the segmentation is uniform and pmax
is less than 1). To investigate the severity of COVID-19, the proportion πtl of infected people in segment Pl at time t
is assigned a state si if si < πtl ≤ si+1 . The observed proportion is π̂tl = nlt /Nl , where nlt is the number of infected
people in population Pl at time t, and Nl is the size of the population segment Pl . For each t and l, the application
π̂tl :−→ M[s] is to take a random variable in M[s], which is the set of discrete probability measures on [s].
3.2 Closeness analysis
We designed an algorithm for closeness analysis by combining distribution testing (closeness testing) and Markov
chain testing in order to analyze the closeness of two sequential data. In distribution testing, there is generally assumed
to be oracle access to the distributions. For closeness testing, according to Theorem 1 of Chan et al. [5] and Theorem
3.2.9 of Canonne [3], tight upper O and lower Ω bounds for sample complexity are given by

and
Ω(max(

The algorithm we designed for closeness analysis satisfies the following two conditions under the assumption of oracle
access [3, 5]. On input ε ∈ (0, 1) (a constant), C ∈ R+ (an absolute constant) and B ∈ N (the number of states), it
B 2/3 B 1/2
takes C · max( 4/3 , 2 ) samples from the distributions and,

• if the total variation distance between the distributions is greater than ε, it outputs REJECT with probability
at least 2/3.
As shown in Algorithm 1, five parameters are input: ε, C, B, N ∈ N (the number of testing iterations) and µ ∈ N
(the minimum number of samples for testing). The sequential data (x and y with d-dimension) are first quantized
into B bins (or B states). Algorithm 1 follows the naive use strategy described in section 2.2. For each state b,

Theorem 3.2.9 of Canonne [3], m0 is sampled from a Poisson distribution with mean m (line 19), and m0 samples are
sampled from the distributions (lines 21 and 22). For the acceptance probability, the χ2 -type statistic z(n) defined by
Chan et al. is calculated for each sample n (line 26) and compared with a threshold [3] (line 28). The statistic can be
viewed as a modification of the empirical triangle distance applied to cx and cy . For the reject probability, the total
variation distance d(n) is calculated for each sample n (line 27) and compared with a threshold ε.
After application of Algorithm 1, the acceptance PA and reject PR probabilities, the distance of the χ2 -type statistic
Z, and the total variation distance D for closeness testing between x and y can be calculated as the mean, median,
or minimum value over all states. The minimum value is the most conservative; the mean value was used in the
experiments. The χ2 -type statistic is an estimate of χ2 -divergence. The relation between the divergence and the total
variation distance is as follows; for distributions p and q, the following inequalities hold.
q
√
d2H (p, q) ≤ dTV (p, q) ≤ 2dH (p, q) ≤ dχ2 (p, q).
Additional details and discussion can be found elsewhere ([6] for instance). These inequalities show that the χ2 divergence dχ2 is more conservative than the Hellinger distance dH and the total variation distance dTV . This motivated
our use of the χ2 -type statistic.
3.3 Periodical evolution analysis
For a sequential data such as COVID-19 data, it is often demanded to analyze the evolution situation. Here, we
investigate a method of periodical evolution analysis with closeness analysis. As shown in Algorithm 2, input sequence
x is first segmented into L segments. Then, for each pair of segments, closeness of the pair is tested using Algorithm
1. We can analyze the periodical properties on the resulting L × L matrices for the acceptance probabilities and the
distances.

3.4 Key factor analysis
When planning measurements such as those for COVID-19, it is important to analyze the key factors, i.e., the factors
that correlate with changes in, for example, the number of infections. We investigated a method for analyzing the
key factors that uses a generalized additive model (GAM) [10] in which the response variable depends linearly on
the unknown smooth functions of some predictor variables and the focus is on making inferences about the smooth
functions. The benefit of GAM is that it takes advantage of the smoothed transforms of the predictor variables using
basis functions such as smoothing splines. The distances obtained by the closeness analysis are used as the response
variables. The data for the key factor candidates, e.g., vehicle and public transport increase rates, are used as predictor
variables. The best model is then selected in a step-wise fashion using either Akaike Information Criterion or model
residual deviance [8].

4 Experiments and results
4.1 COVID-19 sequential data
We used reported data for the number of newly infected people ntl for each of the 53 cities on the main island of Japan
as reported daily by the Tokyo metropolitan government from April 1, 2020, to May 6, 2021, along with the population
Nl of each city. Segmentation {Pl }l=1,...,L (described in section 3.1) was linked to each city in Tokyo (which is a
prefecture, not a city). The observed proportion π̂tl (= nlt /Nl ) was quantized into B-states, and B was set to 20.
4.2 Closeness analysis of COVID-19 infection situation between cities
Figure 1 shows 53 cities ×53 cities matrices of acceptance probabilities (the mean of PA (b) over all states in Algorithm
1) and distances of χ2 -type statistics (the mean of Z(b) over all states in Algorithm 1) between all pairs of 53 cities in
Tokyo for each month from April 2020 to April 2021, calculated using Algorithm 1. As of June 2021, there had been
four waves of COVID-19 infection; the peak months are roughly indicated by red stars.
For the acceptance probabilities, the matrices between the waves tend to be darker; that is, many cities are considered
to have had similar characteristics of the changes in the number of infected people for each of the months. In fact, for
such cities, the number of infected people was relatively and stably small during those months.
For the distances, the overall matrix color is the darkest for January 2021, when the third wave peaked and the number
of infected people was the largest. Many cities experienced an explosion of infections and different characteristics of
the changes in the number of infected people for the month.
Figure 2 shows the k-means clustering for the distance matrices in Figure 1. To facilitate recognition of the differences in the level of increases in infection, the number of color codes was set to three: red indicates relatively high
level, yellow indicates moderate level, and blue indicates low level. For April 2020, two cities in the heart of Tokyo,
Shinjuku-ku and Minato-ku, had the highest level. This is attributed to Shinjuku-ku and Minato-ku having a popular
entertainment district. Until October 2020, most cities had the lowest level. Starting with the third wave, roughly from
December 2020 to February 2021, the levels of the nearby cities increased to moderate and then to high. These figures
illustrate how the characteristics of the changes in the number of infected people were transformed.
4.3 Periodical COVID-19 evolution analysis
Figure 3 shows the matrices of acceptance probabilities, distances of χ2 -type statistics, reject probabilities (mean of
PR (b) over all states in Algorithm 1), and total variation distances (mean of D(b) over all states in Algorithm 1)
between all pairs of 13 months for Shinjuku and Tachikawa calculated using Algorithm 2. Tachikawa-shi is located in
the middle west of Tokyo, in a suburban area. For Shinjuku-ku (in the heart of Tokyo), as in Figure 1, almost all the
pairs are different while the May–October 2020 pair are similar. For Tachikawa-shi, the pairs from April to November
2020 and for February and March 2021 are similar. The number of infected people for these months was relatively
and stably small. This figure illustrates the characteristics of monthly COVID-19 evolution for both cities.
Figure 4 shows the matrices of acceptance probabilities, distances of χ2 -type statistic, reject probabilities, and total
variation distances between all pairs of 57 weeks from 1 April 2020 to 5 May 2021 for all of Tokyo calculated using
Algorithm 2 and all the numbers accumulated for all the cities in Tokyo. The acceptance probabilities show that the
weeks from April to June, 2020 and for August and September, 2020, tended to be similar among the cities. The
distances show that the weeks in January, April, and May 2021 were very different. This indicates that the number
of infected people for the weeks in January 2021 dynamically changed, probably because of an increase in contacts
between people due to year-end and beginning-of-year parties and meetings. In April and May 2021, variants of the

COVID-19 virus with higher infectivity began to gradually spread, so the characteristics of the changes in the number
of infected people differed from those in previous weeks.
4.4 Key factor analysis for COVID-19 evolution
For the key factor analysis, we used the distances of the χ2 -type statistic Z and the total variation distances D between
all pairs of 52 weeks from 6 May 2020 to 4 May 2021 for all of Tokyo, which are included in figure 4 in which 57
weeks were used. Table 1 lists the key factor candidates used in the experiments such as vehicle and public transport
increase rates and average temperature in Tokyo, which are considered to affect the rate of new infections. We set a
delay of zero (no delay), one week, or two weeks between the distances.
For the distances of the χ2 -type statistic, the R-squared (adjusted) values are listed in Table 2. R-squared is a statistical
measure of the success in explaining the response by the model, and R-squared (adjusted) is a version adjusted for
the number of predictors in the model for parsimony. The table shows that the fitting was fairly accurate. The best
model for a delay of two weeks was selected; it is shown in eq. (2). The s(term) indicates a smoothed transform in
which term is computed using a smoothing spline, as mentioned in section 3.4. All the terms were significant: 0.001
significance level for vehicle, s(temperature), and s(deathTokyo), 0.01 for s(week), s(patientHospital),
and s(roomHospital), and 0.05 for pedestrian and s(deathWorld).
Z ∼s(week) + vehicle + pedestrian + s(tepmerature) + s(deathTokyo)
+ s(deathWorld) + s(patientHospital) + s(roomHospital)

(2)

For the total variation distances, the fitting accuracy on the R-squared (adjusted) values was fairly good, as shown in
Table 2. The best model for a delay of two weeks was selected; it is shown in eq. (3). All the terms were significant except for s(patientHospital): 0.001 significance level for s(week), vehicle, s(temperature), s(deathTokyo),
and s(infectedWorld) and 0.01 for pedestrian and s(roomHospital).
D ∼s(week) + vehicle + pedestrian + s(temperature) + s(deathTokyo)
+ s(infectedWorld) + s(patientHospital) + s(roomHospital)

(3)

Moreover, we divided the 52 weeks from 6 May 2020 to 4 May 2021 into two periods: (i) the 30 weeks from May
to November 2020 and (ii) the 22 weeks from December 2020 to May 2021. For the first period, the R-squared
(adjusted) values for both the χ2 -type statistic and total variation distance in Table 2 were low, making it is difficult
to find correlation between the distances and the key factors. For the second period, the R-squared (adjusted) values
for both distances were high. As mentioned in section 4.2, the third wave roughly started in December 2020 in Tokyo,
and stronger correlations between the distances and the key factors are evident for the second period.
For the distances of the χ2 -type statistic, the best model for a delay of two weeks was selected; it is shown in eq. (4).
All the terms were significant: 0.001 significance level for week, vehicle, s(deathTokyo), s(deathWorld), and
s(patientHospital), 0.01 for s(transport) and infectedWorld, and 0.05 for s(temperature).
Z ∼week + vehicle + s(transport) + s(temperature) + s(deathTokyo)
+ infectedWorld + s(deathWorld) + s(patientHospital)

(5)

These results indicate that the increase rates for vehicles and public transport can be used in the COVID-19 measurements, especially for the second period. The temperature, numbers of deaths, and number of patients in hospitals in
Tokyo should be considered key factors that can be correlated with a change in COVID-19 infection rates.

5 Discussion
We first discuss the properties of Algorithm 1 as a Markov chain tester and the sensitivity of its parameters. We
do this using simulated data: (i) sequence Qx randomly generated from a transition probability matrix with 5 states
(Markov chain), (ii) sequence Qy generated using sorting sequence X, and (iii) sequence Qz consisting of (100 − α)%

sequences (the same as for Qx ) and an α% sequence (different from Qx ). All sequences had a length of 100 with state
components s1 = 1, . . . , s5 = 5 (see appendix 7). Note that although sequences Qx and Qy included the same portion
of each state, Qy had no Markovian property.
Figure 5 shows the acceptance probabilities, the distances of the χ2 -type statistic, and the threshold values of closeness
analysis between two sequences (Qx and Qy ) with and without the Markovian property and with various values of
ε and C in Algorithm 1. When ε was smaller than 0.3, the algorithm could accurately distinguish Qx and Qy for
all values of C. However, when ε was 0.4 or 0.5 and C was 1 or less, the test results were incorrect although the
inaccuracy was less than 4%. These results show that strict testing can be conducted with small values of ε and large
values of C although with these setting, m (line 19 in Algorithm 1) becomes large and the computation cost is higher.
However, the required level of strictness in closeness analysis should differ between applications, meaning that the
values can be set accordingly, especially that of ε. Moreover, both C and ε should be set in accordance with the
available computation power.
Figure 6 shows the acceptance probabilities, the distances of the χ2 -type statistic, and the threshold values of closeness
analysis between two identical sequences (Qx and Qx ) with various values of ε and C in Algorithm 1. For ε from 0.1
to 0.9 and C from 1 to 100, the algorithm correctly determined that the two sequences were the same.
Table 3 lists the acceptance probabilities, the distances of the χ2 -type statistic, the reject probabilities, and the total
variation distances of closeness analysis between (100 - α)% similar sequences (Qx and Qz ) with ε = 0.1 and
C = 100 in Algorithm 1. α was varied from 0 to 5%. The algorithm was able to distinguish the similar sequences
when α = 2% or more. In contrast, the classical hypothesis tests for two distributions (Wilcoxon rank-sum test and
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) could not reject the null hypothesis for all values of α. The proposed algorithm thus has
strong testing power for sequential data.

6 Conclusions
We have designed a practical algorithm for testing the closeness of sequential data by combining distribution testing
and Markov chain testing. We used it to analyze the closeness, the periodical evolution, and the key factors for the
number of people infected with COVID-19 for each city in Tokyo. The results showed that whether or not the epidemic
evolves in the same way in different cities or in different months or weeks with numerical indicators of the acceptance
and reject probabilities and the significance levels. Examination of the properties of the algorithm as a Markov chain
tester and the sensitivity of the parameters showed that strict testing can be conducted with small values of ε and
large values of C under the constraint of the available computation power. Comparison with the classical Wilcoxon
rank-sum test and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test demonstrated that the algorithm has a strong testing power for sequential
data.
