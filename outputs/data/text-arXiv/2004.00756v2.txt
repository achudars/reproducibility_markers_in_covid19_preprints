Abstract—As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to be a global pandemic, policy makers have enacted
and reversed non-pharmaceutical interventions with various
levels of restrictions to limit its spread. Data driven approaches
that analyze temporal characteristics of the pandemic and its
dependence on regional conditions might supply information
to support the implementation of mitigation and suppression
strategies. To facilitate research in this direction on the example
of the United States, we present a machine-readable dataset
that aggregates relevant data from governmental, journalistic,
and academic sources on the U.S. county level. In addition to
county-level time-series data from the JHU CSSE COVID-19
Dashboard [1], our dataset contains more than 300 variables
that summarize population estimates, demographics, ethnicity,
housing, education, employment and income, climate, transit
scores, and healthcare system-related metrics. Furthermore, we
present aggregated out-of-home activity information for various
points of interest for each county, including grocery stores and
hospitals, summarizing data from SafeGraph [2] and Google
mobility reports [3]. We compile information from IHME, state
and county-level government, and newspapers for dates of the
enactment and reversal of non-pharmaceutical interventions. [4]–
[119] By collecting these data, as well as providing tools to read
them, we hope to accelerate research that investigates how the
disease spreads and why spread may be different across regions.
Our dataset and associated code are available at

interest for selected counties with high incidence of COVID-19 cases, from
March 1 to March 21. The periodic dip in hospital visits corresponds to
weekends, when most hospitals have reduced hours. The decline in overall
foot traffic can be seen to start on March 12 in these counties. Data from [2].

14, 2020, the U.S. has unfortunately experienced more than
190,000 deaths due to COVID-19 and remains a significant
epicenter of the disease with more than 25,000 daily cases [1],
[122]. Social distancing measures remain in effect throughout
much of the country, and despite optimistic plans to reopen
schools, millions of students return to virtual classrooms this
Fall due to COVID-19 [123]. In many parts of the country,
confirmed COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths are
increasing exponentially [1]. Drastic interventions like social
distancing and mask mandates are necessary to slow the spread

of the disease, giving more time to
• provide treatment within our healthcare system’s capacity,
• develop effective testing capability,
• establish sophisticated tracing mechanisms, and
• discover novel treatments for the virus.
At the same time, the current mitigation strategies have had
severe effects on society and the economy. Widespread closures of schools and daycares have left working parents with
limited childcare options [124]; shuttered bars, restaurants, and
entertainment venues have forced owners to lay off employees,
predominantly in the service industry [125]; and the U.S.
and global economy may be experiencing the worst recession
since World War II [126], [127]. To combat these effects,
U.S. representatives have passed the largest economic stimulus
package in U.S. history [128], and the Federal Reserve has
cut interest rates to near zero [129]. However, no economic
stimulus can offset the effects of altered consumer behavior.
Determining when and how to roll back non-pharmaceutical
interventions in a manner which is safe and responsible is of
the utmost importance.
The initial lockdown period was necessary to avoid overwhelming our hospital systems, but the current situation calls
for a more nuanced approach. Moving forward, the U.S. must
balance reducing the risk of spread with the adverse economic
consequences of millions of furloughed and unemployed people. To inform this process, we have curated a machinereadable dataset that aggregates data from governmental,
journalistic, and academic sources on the county level, including aggregated NPI implementation dates. While most of these
sources are freely available, there is substantial work to align
them and put them in a standard format that enables analysis.
In addition to time-series data from [1], which details COVID-

19 per-county infections and deaths, our dataset contains
more than 300 variables that summarize population estimates,
demographics, ethnicity, housing, education, employment and
income, climate, transit scores, and healthcare system-related
metrics. Further, we source a significant number of journal
articles and official statements detailing implementation dates
of interventions, including mask mandates, stay-at-home orders, school closures, and restaurant and entertainment venue
closures [4]–[42], as well as reopenings [43]–[119] . Finally,
we aggregate out-of-home activity data from [2] and [3] in
each county, possibly measuring compliance with the aforementioned restrictions. Fig. 1 shows a sample of out-of-home
activity for selected counties.
We hope that this dataset proves to be a useful resource to
the community, facilitating important research on epidemiological forecasting. In particular, a machine learning approach
to identify highly relevant factors may inform a graduated
rollback of isolation measures and travel restrictions.
II. R ELATED W ORK
Because of the rapidly-evolving nature of the COVID-19
pandemic, the response from the data science community is
ongoing and in flux. Here, we review related efforts which
were influential at the outset of the pandemic. As new articles
are published every day, this is by no means an exhaustive
review.
Despite significant public interest, government agencies
have yet to publish a county-level data source for cases of
COVID-19. The World Health Organization has gathered selfreported data on the national level [144], while the United
States Center for Disease Control reports state-level infection
and fatality rates [145]. However, [1], [146] continue to

maintain the most up-to-date and reputable collections of
COVID-19 cases across the United States, hosted by the
Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns
Hopkins University and the New York Times, respectively.
These efforts focus on current, hard data gathered from local
government publications and reputable journalistic sources.
Other efforts focus on gleaning related information from
a variety of sources, including social media. [147] tracks
COVID-19 related tweets in an effort to understand the conversation and possible misinformation surrounding the pandemic.
Johns Hopkins University, University of Maryland, and George
Washington University have also started a collaboration to
track COVID-19 through social media [148].
A large body of work has focused on using machine learning
and data science tools to understand the virus. [149] uses
data from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, where an early
outbreak took place, to estimate the reproductive number R0
of the virus. [150] implements active learning methods to
detect new outbreaks of the virus, incorporating new data types
without having to retrain. [151], [152] focus on understanding
the current pandemic in its early stages, compensating for the
inherent uncertainty in novel disease. Finally, [153] applies a
data-driven approach to understand the effect of NPIs on the
reproductive ratio of COVID-19 in European countries.
III. DATASET
We describe the structure of our dataset, which includes
each component in its raw form as well as a narroweddown, machine-readable form conducive to a machine-learning
approach. Table I summarizes the sources and availability for
each type of data, and a full description of each variable can
be found in our repository.
A. County Descriptors
We populate a CSV file with over 300 variables for 3220
county-equivalent areas (as well as the fifty states, District of
Columbia, and the whole United States) with numerous types
of data, including population, education, economic, climate,

housing, health care capacity, public transit, and crime statistics. Each area is uniquely identified by its Federal Information
Processing Standard (FIPS) code, a five digit number where
they first two digits designate the state, and the last three
digits describe the county-equivalent. Our sources include the
United States Census Bureau [130], [131], [136], [137], the
United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Economic
Research Service [132], [133], the National Oceanic and
Atmosphere Administration (NOAA) [134], the Association
of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) [138], the Henry
J. Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) [120], [139], [140], the
Center for Neighborhood Technology (CNT) [142], and the
Bureau of Justice Statistics, Department of Justice (DOJ)
[143]. Perhaps most relevant to the ongoing effort to mitigate
the effects of COVID-19 in the U.S. is county-level healthcare
system capacity. The dataset includes detailed counts for each
type of medical practitioner as well as the number of Intensive
Care Unit beds in each county, shown in Fig. 2.
For the most part, these basic descriptive variables are
unaltered from their original state. Where appropriate, missing
values have been imputed with the state-wide average, detailed
in Table I.
B. Interventions
Our dataset describes mitigation efforts taken at the state
level, including stay-at-home advisories, banning large gatherings, public school closures, and restaurant and entertainment venue closures. We also include the rollback of these
mitigation efforts up to Aug 2nd. For machine readability, we
provide each date of implementation as a Gregorian ordinal,
i.e. the integer number of days starting at January 1, Year
1 CE, consistent with standard software libraries. Moreover,
these data are provided according to the same county-level
row ordering as our county descriptor data (see Sec. III-A).
Interventions made at the state level have been assigned to
each county in that state, and we include county-level interventions wherever possible. An intervention is designated NA
if the county or state has not yet enacted it. For the most parts,

Fig. 3. The daily number of infections for Los Angeles County and the District of Columbia, [1]. The 7-day average is shown in red. For simplicity, we
only show the implementation dates for two interventions and their rollbacks, stay-at-home orders and restaurant closures, since many interventions overlap.
Note that the scales differ by a factor of 20.

county-level NPI implementation was gathered through local
newspapers and government websites. The full list of these
sources can be found https://github.com/JieYingWu/COVID19 US County-level Summaries/tree/master/data. Since rollbacks were implemented in a more staggered fashion, we
started by using the dates provided by the IHME database,
which contains state-level rollback information. [43] While
IHME records the categories for stay-at-home and gatherings,
they separate businesses as essential and non-essential. We
use dates for non-essential businesses reopening for restaurants and gym/entertainment. As schools were mostly still
on summer vacation by Aug 2nd, we did not collect school
reopenings. To refine the state-level data to the county level,
we use reopening information from the New York Times
[154], which includes some counties that do not follow state
guidelines. We also rely on it to fix discrepancies such as if
the opening of the first non-essential business did not include
restaurants or gyms. Additionally, since counties are generally
driven to implement a different rollback schedule if they
have an unusual number of COVID-19 cases, we check the
county government website of those counties where there was
a drastic uptick in cases in the previous months. As different
counties have reopened at different levels, such as reopening
restaurants at 25% outdoor seating, we count any amount of
reopening as that NPI has been rolled back. As the policies
surrounding COVID-19 management is continually changing,
we appreciate any contributions to the repository to keep it
up-to-date, especially as school reopening decisions come into
effect.
C. Out-of-home Activity and Mobility
We have aggregated point-of-interest location data gathered
from user’s smartphones to show out-of-home activity, using
raw data from [2]. For privacy and IP reasons, our dataset
does not include user location data in its raw form but rather
in several time-series files summarizing county-level activity.
Fig. 1 shows the time-series for selected counties which have
a high incidence of COVID-19 cases. The decline in overall
activity on March 12 corresponds to an increased media

attention and stay-at-home advisories in those areas. At the
same time, a spike in grocery store visits points to a panicbuying spree which has since subsided.
Additionally we include data from Google mobility reports
[3], which may correlate with changes in the reproductive
ratio of COVID-19. These include aggregated and anonymized
data, detailing the percent change in number of visits to six
location types compared to baseline: grocery and pharmacy;
parks; residential; retail and recreation; transit stations; and
workplaces. Visits to residential addresses likely describes
individuals staying at home, with the obvious exception of
gatherings that occur at residential addresses, either for work
or social reasons.

D. Disease Spread
Finally, we provide time-series data for the cumulative
number of COVID-19 confirmed cases and related deaths,
from [1]. This data begins on January 22, 2020. It should
be noted that epidemiological modeling efforts may want to
consider the uncertainty surrounding U.S. testing [155], on
which these data are based. At the time of this writing, efforts
to improve the availability of COVID-19 tests are ongoing, but
the current strategies prioritize patients with severe symptoms.
Thus, modeling efforts may wish to take into account random
subsampling of the true population, where untested individuals
still spread the virus. This is especially true given that nearly
half of all COVID-19 infections may be asymptomatic [156].
Fig. 3 shows the daily number of infections in Los Angeles
County, CA, and the District of Columbia according to [1], as
well as implementation dates for select interventions: “stay at
home” and “restaurant dine-in.” In some areas, rollbacks have
coincided with a resurgence of the virus, reaching levels of
new daily infections far greater than the initial outbreak, as in
Los Angeles, whereas other areas have rolled back NPIs and
experienced only a small or negligible increase, such as the
District of Columbia (see Fig. 3).

IV. D ISCUSSION
The resurgence of COVID-19 in some areas but not others
reinforces the need for continued vigilance everywhere. In
some sense, the United States has experienced not a single outbreak but multiple outbreaks, both simultaneous and
non-simultaneous, with differing characteristics in terms of
transmission rate, mobility, and response to NPIs. Although
pharmaceutical interventions, such as a vaccine, or natural
herd immunity may eventually mitigate the likelihood of an
outbreak independent from public behavior, these eventualities
are still far on the horizon. In the meantime, the possibility of
a resurgence, which may overwhelm the healthcare systems, is
ever-present. The number of individuals who will ultimately be
infected—and the number of deaths that will result—depend
on the interventions reinforced now. At the same time, the
economic impact of these interventions, which is not evenly
distributed across counties, cannot be ignored. It depends
on the characteristic qualities of each area—very different,
for example, New York as opposed to Silicon Valley. The
former has a large population in the entertainment and service
industries, which will need financial support during quarantine,
whereas the latter is dominated by large tech firms, whose
employees can adapt to working from home. By providing
the socioeconomic attributes of each county, the spread of
COVID-19 confirmed cases, and the ongoing response in a
machine-readable format, we hope to inform the decisions
made to most effectively protect each area.
