Abstract—

Worldwide Severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is disrupting in the
economy and anxiety of people. The public anxiety has
increased the psychological burden on government and
healthcare professionals, resulting in a government worker
suicide in Japan. The terrified people are asking the
government for border measures. However, are border
measures possible for this virus? By analysing 48 almost
complete virus genome sequences, we found out that the
viruses that invaded Taiwan, the United States, and Japan
were introduced independently. We identified thirteen
parsimony-informative sites and three groups (CTC, TCC, and
TCT). Viruses found outside China did not form a
monophyletic clade, opposite to previous study. These results
suggest the difficulty of implementing effective border
measures against this virus.

INTRODUCTION

The outbreak of a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)
[1] has had a significant impact on neighbouring
countries with transportation to and from China
due to the spread of SARS-CoV-2. It is reasonable to
think that restricting human movement is effective
in managing viruses, as human movement
accelerates the spread of the virus. A total ban on
traffic could have helped control virus transmission
[2]. Movement of people across the sea by plane or
ship is considered necessary in the movement of
viruses [3]. Several governments announced
strengthened border measures to prevent viral
border invasion [4, 5]. The various restrictions
associated with the pandemic hurt not only the
economy [6], but also the mental health [7, 8]. The
fear of the virus has resulted in discrimination and
excessive demands on the government. A 37-yearold government worker who worked on antivirus
committed suicide in Japan [7]. With the
availability of viral genome sequences, research is
being conducted into many different aspects [9-13].
An analysis of previously collected viral genomes

indicated that viruses outside China formed a
monophyletic clade, suggesting the effectiveness of
border measures [14]. Recently, more complete viral
genome sequences have been published, providing
more resources to discuss virus transmission [15].
Although several phylogenetic trees of the virus
have been published, many analyzes including
fragment sequences did not provide accurate
phylogenetic information. Therefore, we scrutinized
the available viral sequences and collected only fulllength viral genomic sequences for phylogenetic
analysis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Data Mining
The genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 isolated
from human and “BatCoV RaTG13” (Accession No.
GWHABKP00000000), which is most closely related
to SATS-CoV-2 [9], were obtained from 2019 Novel
Coronavirus Resource [15] (Accessed 22 Feb, 2020).
We choose 51 longer sequences. The shortest one is
26,973 bps and the longest one is 29,903 bps. One of
the longest sequences, “Wuhan-Hu-1” (Accession No.
MN908947), was used as the reference genome. We
also obtained the genome sequence of “Bat SARSlike coronavirus” (Accession No. MG772933) from
GenBank as the outgroup according to the previous
study [9]. In total, we used 49 SARS-CoV-2
sequences (Table 1) and 2 bat coronavirus sequences
(Table 2)
Isolation of open reading frames
The open reading frames (ORF) information of the
reference genome were obtained from GenBank. We
used the translated ORF amino-acid sequences as
the queries, and searched other SARS-CoV-2
genomes for ORF by using FATE [16] with
TBLASTN engine and other default parameters.
The ORF sequences were cut out from the genome
sequences based on the results of FATE by using
BEDTools [17].

Figure 1. Parsimony-informative sites found from SARS-Cov-2 ORF sequences
There were 13 parsimony-informative sites in 29,145 bps alignment of sequences from 47 samples isolated from human. Dots indicate the
same as the reference base on the top of the alignment. A, C, G or T indicate the difference in the reference base. Blue, green, and yellow
highlight indicate group TCT, TCC, and CTC respectively. Group TCT was defined by T8782, C28144 and T29095. Group TCC was
defined by T8782, C28144 and C29095. Group CTC was defined by C8782, T28144 and C29095. All sites including gaps were removed
from the analysis. Bases of the same sites on the 2 coronavirus genomes isolated from bat were shown in bottom and 2nd line from the
bottom of the alignment, respectively.

Codon-based multiple sequence alignment and
extraction of variable/parsimony-informative sites
Isolated ORF sequences were aligned for each gene
based on codons by using DIALIGN-TX [18]. The
largest gene “orf1ab” was divided into upstream and
downstream regions and aligned respectively
because this gene has the ribosomal slippage site.
We removed three samples, “Human-UnitedStatesIllinois-Chicago”
(Accession
No.
MN988713),
'Human-Finland-Lapland'
(Accession
No.

MT020781), and “Human-China-HubeiProvinceWuhanCity” (Accession No. NMDC60013002-05)
from the analysis because their sequences include
mixed
bases.
Then,
we
extracted
variable/parsimony-informative sites based on the
multiple sequence alignment by using in-house Perl
script.

Phylogenetic analysis
Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analyses based
on the multiple sequence alignment of ORF were

performed under the seven conditions below, (1)
DNA-based no separate, (2) separating 1st/2nd and
3rd codon position, (3) separating each codon
position, (4) separating each gene, (5) separating
each gene and also 1st/2nd and 3rd codon position,
(6) separating each gene and each codon position,
and (7) protein-based separating each gene. For
each condition, the best evolutionary models were
estimated by using ModelTest-NG [19] with default
parameters, followed by estimating the phylogenies
of SATS-CoV-2 by using RAxML-NG [20] with '--all'
option and the best Bayesian information criterion
(BIC)-supported evolutionary models. Under any
conditions, the outgroup was set to 'Bat SARS-like
coronavirus' and the number of bootstraps replicates
was set to 1000. Obtained phylogenies were colored
by using MEGA X [21]. All analyses data and inhouse scripts are available [22].
III.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

60 variable sites were found from 29,145 bps
alignment of SARS-CoV-2 ORF sequences from 47
samples isolated from human (Figure S1). There
were 13 parsimony-informative sites (614, 2662,
5084, 8782, 18060, 24034, 24325, 26144, 26729,
28077, 28144, 28854 and 29095-th nucleotide of
referential SARS-CoV-2 genome (MN908947)), of
which 7 were non-synonymous (Table 3). There were
3 important parsimony-informative sites. The first
important parsimony-informative site was 8782-nd
nucleotide of referential SARS-CoV-2 genome
(MN908947). Referential nucleotide is C and
alternative nucleotide is T. The second important
parsimony-informative site was 28144-th nucleotide
of referential SARS-CoV-2 genome (MN908947).
Referential nucleotide is T and alternative
nucleotide is C. This substitution results in changes
in amino acids 84 of ORF8, a previously indicated
polypeptide involved in promoting virus transition
from bat to human [24, 25]. The third important
parsimony-informative site was 29095-th nucleotide
of referential SARS-CoV-2 genome (MN908947).
Referential nucleotide is C and alternative
nucleotide is T. Therefore, we named 3 groups, TCC,
TCT and others (CTC) (Figure 1). Viruses found
outside China did not form a single group, opposite
to previous study [14]. This result suggests that the
viral were introduced to each country several times.
Phylogenies of SARS-CoV-2 were constructed
based on the ORF sequences (Figure 2 and Figure
S2). DNA-based phylogeny under the separating
each codon position condition (Figure 2) showed the

highest final log-likelihood and 2nd-lowest AIC
score among DNA-based phylogenetic trees. On the
other hand, protein-based phylogenetic tree (Figure
S2F) might not be reliable because the tree was
constructed based on less informative sites except
for the synonymous substitution sites. According to
our phylogeny, the group CTC formed a
monophyletic clade, including all samples isolated
from Chinese in Wuhan except for "CNA0007335Human-China-HubeiProvince-WuhanCity".
Samples of the group TCC and TCT were
paraphyletic for group CTC and located near the
root of the tree. Our phylogenies suggest that the
“Bat-SARS-like coronavirus” (MG772933) and
“BatCoV RaTG13” are more closely related to
samples included in the group TCC and TCT than
samples included in the group CTC. Some of the
phylogenies constructed under other conditions
suggest the different phylogenetic position of group
TCC and TCT, however, support the monophyly and
the same phylogenetic position of group CTC
(Figure S2). These results indicate that SARS-CoV-2
widely spread in Wuhan is different from that of
other areas. In areas other than Wuhan, where
virus invasion has been observed, the damage has
not seemed to be as severe as Wuhan, however the
spread of group CTC might increase the damage in
the near future. From the perspective of virus
control, sequencing should be performed since
viruses have multiple properties that is hard to be
distinguished by qPCR.
The viral genome sequences “MT039890-HumanSourth-Korea” and “GWHABKG0000000-HumanChina-Hubei-Province-Wuhan-City” have many
sample-specific substitutions in their sequence. The
viral genome sequence “MN988713-Human-USAIllinois-Chicago” has several ambiguous bases in
parsimony-informative sites, discovered in this
study. Interestingly, the ambiguous bases can be
explained by the mixture of group TCC and CTC
(Table 4). This fact suggests that “MN988713Human-USA-Illinois-Chicago” contains at least two
different viral genomes. We could corroborate this
hypothesis after next generation sequence data
release.
To determine whether viral sequences have novel
mutations acquired during spreading the infection
or just reflect the diversity of the place of origin,
various SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences should be
collected in the place of origin.

Figure 2. Topological phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2 estimated with maximum-likelihood
A maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analysis based on the multiple sequence alignment of ORF were performed under the
condition of separating each codon position. Blue, green, and yellow branches indicate group TCT, TCC, and CTC
respectively. Substitutions on the parsimony-informative sites were mapped to the corresponding branches. SARS-CoV-2
isolated from human formed a monophyletic clade with 100% bootstrap value. Group CTC formed a monophyletic clade with
74% bootstrap value. Group TCC was paraphyletic respect to the group CTC. Group TCT was paraphyletic respect to the clade
consists of group CTC and TCT. Final log-likelihood was -55794.362675. AIC score was 112649.332493. Branch length was
meaningless.

Figure S1. Variable sites found from SARS-CoV-2 ORF sequences
After alignment, the SARS-CoV-2 sequences had 60 variable sites from 29,145 bps alignment of ORF sequences from 47 samples isolated
from human. Dots indicate the same as the reference base on the top of the alignment. A, C, G or T indicate the difference in the reference
base. Nucleotide position numbers in the reference genome are shown above the alignment. All sites including gaps were removed from the
analysis.
