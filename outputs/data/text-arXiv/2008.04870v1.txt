Abstract:
Prenatal COVID infection is one of the worst affected and least attended aspects of the COVID-19 disease. Like
other coronaviruses, CoV2 infection is anticipated to affect fetal development by maternal inflammatory response
on the fetus and placenta. Studies showed that higher prenatal choline level in mother’s body can safeguard the
developing brain of the fetus from the adverse effects of CoV2 infection. Choline is commonly used as food
supplement. By virtual screening, molecular docking and molecular dynamics techniques, we have established a
strong inhibitory possibility of choline for SARS 3CLpro protease which may provide a lead for prenatal COVID19 treatment.

1. Introduction
The whole world is now facing a pandemic situation raised from the COVID-19 disease caused by
a member of coronavirus family of viruses, namely SARS-CoV2. Coronaviruses are well known from last
few decades. These viruses have specific enveloped RNA which can be the reason for various respiratory
illnesses like common cold to fatal pneumonia of varying severity [1]. In 1930s, it was first found in
domestic poultry and it was recognized as cause of respiratory, liver, gastrointestinal, and neurologic
diseases in animals [2]. There are seven categories of coronavirus, out of which four can only cause mild
illness with symptom of common cold to the healthy human being. In very rare cases, these viruses can
cause severe lower respiratory tract infections and pneumonia for infants, immune-compromised patients
and older people. The rest three categories: SARS-CoV (identified in 2003), MERS-CoV (identified in
2012) [3] and SARS-CoV2 (identified in 2019) [4] can cause severe respiratory infections which can
sometimes become fatal to the humans. We are already witnessing the devastating and deadly outbreaks
of SARS-CoV2 which began in December 2019 from Wuhan, China [4, 5]. Within a few weeks after its
appearance, the virus spread worldwide by showing symptom of respiratory illness (both acute and severe)
caused by newly named disease COVID-19 caused by the so called novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 [6].
In addition to usual respiratory problem, SARS-CoV2 can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS) and death, too. It’s observed fact that the risk of death and\or serious symptoms due to COVID19 increases in older people and in patients with other serious medical issues including obesity, diabetes,
and heart, lung, kidney or liver disease [7]. The outcome of the above mentioned severity can progress to
respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, shock, multi organ failure, and death [8]. CoV2s are
zoonotic pathogens in nature which usually appear in animals first. Due to the similarities of 79% and
96% for complete genome sequence recognition rates of SARS-CoV and bat SARS-CoV (SARSr-COVRaTG13) it’s suggested that bats may be the hosts of CoV viruses [9]. Similarly, for CoV2 there may exist
original, intermediate and final hosts and so the disease may transfer from infected animal to human. For
SARS-CoV2, person-to-person transmission is the easier way to spread the disease which can happen
easily through infected secretions mainly via respiratory droplets, surface contaminated and possibly by
aerosol transmission. Till now the research output concludes that the virus can easily be transmited by
symptomatic, asymptomatic and presymptomatic patients. As per latest report, COVID-19 patients are
mainly treated by providing supportive treatment only [10]. Around 200 FDA approved drugs and
vaccines through clinical trials have been registered. Some investigational antiviral drugs like:
Remdesivir, Favipiravir, Hydrochloroquine, Chloroquine, etc. have been in use for patients with severe
2

symptoms [11, 12]. However, toxicities associated with these drugs have already created some major fatal
health issues [11]. Alternatively, some Immunomodulatory therapy by including convalescent plasma
also are in use but as per today, specific drugs and vaccines to fight against COVID-19 are yet to be
discovered or are still under development. As a part of this development, some particular nutrient food
supplements and herbal medicines which specifically have some antiviral, immunomodulatory activities
against different viruses like influenza, HIV, other coronaviruses can be considered with the aim of
promoting the use of dietary therapy, hard immunity and herbal medicine as an alternative of COVID-19
therapies [13,14]. A set of research works have already suggested that nutrient food supplements and herbs
possess a potential antiviral ability, hard immunity against SARS-CoV2 [14].

Previous pandemics due to different viruses have showed their effects on fetal developments which
led to significant enhancement in number of infants with mental illnesses like schizophrenia, autism
spectrum disorder and attention deficit disorder [15, 16]. As per report of "The Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC),” prenatal COVID-19 infections can also develop its impact on fetal brain
development by the effects of the maternal inflammatory response on the fetus and placenta [17]. We
have to wait for some years for the supporting data regarding this impact from COVID-19. Current
reported data from CDC based on Infant Behaviour Questionnaire Revised (IBQ-R) regulation [17, 18]
suggest that no symptoms of viral infections are found after 3 months of birth on the children of COVID19 infected mothers having high digestive choline level (7.5 M) during the first 16 weeks of pregnancy.
Some specific diets and food supplements are the source of choline for human body. Medical reports
suggested that higher choline level in expecting mothers may protect fetal brain development from
COVID-19, which definitely may support infant behavioral development though the mothers got COVID19 infection in their gestation stage when the brain is being formed [17-20]. These findings have motivated
3

us to work on a specific nutrient food supplement: Choline (C5H14NO) which is supposed to be used to
protect the fetal brain development specifically during pregnancy [17]. Our in silico studies by virtual
screening, molecular docking and molecular dynamics on choline as ligand and 3CLpro main spike
protease of CoV2 as receptor have been able to establish that prenatal COVID-19 infections can be
nullified by choline contained food supplements as they help to shield the fetal brain in mother’s womb
from the possible detrimental impact from COVID-19 (Figure 1a,b).

2. Materials and Methods:
2.1.

Potential Inhibitor Choline

Choline is present in some dietary supplements/foods and belongs to the Vitamin B family. Choline
is naturally found in many plant-based products like beans and cruciferous vegetables including dried
nuts, whole grains, and seeds [21]. It’s also found in animal-based products like poultry, dairy products,
meat, eggs, and fish. It is one of the phytoconstituents extracted from herbal plants like tinospora
cordifolia, withania somnifera [14].

Choline is endogenously produced in human liver as

phosphatidylcholine. However, the amount of endogenously produced choline is not enough to meet our
needs [22]. Choline plays a very significant role in forming of human genes, various metabolism process,
and lipid transport. It helps the cell membranes to connect and communicate within the whole
body. Choline is an important component of breast milk on which the fetal development of a child is
dependent during the early birth stages. Medical studies reveal that proper intake of choline supplements
by would be mothers can protect the infants from neurodegenerative diseases like Down syndrome,
Alzheimer’s diseases [23]. Choline is a direct precursor of Ach (acetylcholine) which is a neurotransmitter
that controls a large number of autonomic, cognitive, and motor functions [23]. As per the medical
studies, if choline are taken by the mother during pregnancy, this would make the newborn baby capable
enough to mitigate the risks of CoV2 infections [17]. COVID-19 disease can destroy a child’s respiratory
organs and also hamper brain development. It’s expected that choline can reduce the impact of the virus
on the child’s brain. The medical experts have relied on the fact that choline supplements will help the
infants survive in a healthy manner though the mother get affected by the CoV2 infection. However, not
much research justifying this hypothesis is conducted until now. Rigorous investigations are still needed
to explore the connection between choline and SARS CoV2 infections and to determine whether choline
4

can act as a potential inhibitor against the receptor protein CoV-2 main protease and to be used as potential
drug so that choline supplements might benefit patients with COVID-19 disease. For the present study we
have downloaded the structure of choline in PDB format from Drugbank (https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs)
(Figure 1b). We have also done the proper virtual screening by evaluating their drug-likeness,
pharmacokinetics and lipophilicity properties which are a set of guidelines for identification of potential
drug compounds (Table 1). Some mostly industry applicable drug-likeness rules are: “Lipinski's rule”,
“MDDR-like rule”, “Veber’s rule”, “Ghose filter”, “Egan rule”, “Muegge rule”, etc [24-26]. SWISSADME software (https://www.swissadme.ch) has helped us in applying different virtual screening
methods. For Molecular docking study, ligand choline has been saved in pdbqt format by Auto Dock
Tools 1.5.6 [27].

Potential Target Protein Structure for SARS-CoV-2

Corona virus encodes large number of structural and nonstructural polyproteins. Among them some
polyproteins become cleaved and transformed themselves into some mature nonstructural protein by
protease 3CLpro which is a key to SARS-CoV enzyme [28]. CoV 3CLpro is responsible for controlling
functions replication and transcription processes by its spike (S) glycoprotein [29]. S enters the host cell
and from the viral surface it forms homo trimers. After entering it interacts strongly with the ACE2
(angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) receptor and replicates itself through some cyclic processes [30].
Targeting 3CLpro protease may constitute a valid approach for anti COVID drug designing. 3D structure
of one of the 3CLpro like protease protein is reported by X-Ray crystallographic data (PDBID: 6LU7) [31]
(Figure 1a). We have checked the inhibiting and binding possibilities of this natural 3CLpro like protease
protein substrate in order to find the effectiveness of choline against COVID-19 in the present work. The
structure of 6LU7 was downloaded from the “Protein Data Bank” (https://www.rcsb.org/) and has been
prepared for further simulation purposes by Auto Dock and MG Tools of Auto DockVina software [32].
The inbuilt ligands were removed from 6LU7 using Discovery studio 2020 (Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA)
[33] and the output structure was subsequently cleaned and saved in PDB format.

2.3.

Methods: Molecular Docking, Molecular Dynamics, Binding Energy

Molecular docking which performs energy minimization and binding energy calculations, is one of
the most applied simulation mechanisms used to predict the potential drug-target interactions. It can
identify the best orientation/pose of ligand towards host protein. Docking algorithms with the help of some
scoring functions are used to identify the suitable ligand conformation at energy minimized state [34].
Molecular docking can predict whether the ligand/drug is docked with the receptor protein/DNA or not
and show the results in the form of rankings of docked compounds which are dependent on lower binding
energy. The algorithm of AutoDock Vina with some best fitted configuration parameters (binding modes9, exhaustiveness – 8, energy difference- 3 kcal/mol, Gridbox center with coordinate x y, and z of residue
position of the target protein) is used to do the docking-based studies on the suggested inhibitor onto the
protease of CoV-2 [32]. The target protein is saved in pdbqt format by Auto Dock Tools [32] and ready
to be used for docking. After simulation, the pose showing maximum nonbonded interactions, dipole
moment with minimum binding affinity (kcal/mol), drieding energy, inhibition constant was chosen as

6

the best ligand: protein complex structure. Another criteria of choosing best ligand: protein pose is
identifying the types and number of bonding between them. The metabolite which makes maximum
number of H-bonds, electrostatic bonds with the receptor protein mostly show better capability to form
ligand: protein complex.
MD simulation results helped us to investigate the structural dynamics of protein: ligand
interactions. LINUX based platform ‘‘GROMACS 5.1 Package’’ [35] with CHARMM36 all atom [36]
and GROMOS43A2 force fields [37] are used for determination of various thermodynamic parameters
like potential energy (Epot), temperature (T), density progression (D), radius of gyration (Rg), root mean
square deviation (RMSD) for backbone, root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) for protein C backbone,
solvent accessible surface area (SASA), hydrogen bonds, interaction energies of the proposed ligand:
protein complex. Choline was optimized by Gaussian 9.0 by Density Functional Theory (DFT) with the
basis set 6.31G (d,p) [38, 39]. TIP3P water model and steepest descent algorithm has been used for energy
minimization of the system in two steps each with varying time (1 ns – 10 ns) for 500,000 iteration steps
with a cut-off up to 1000 kJmol−1 for reducing the steric clashes. In first step, a boundary condition of
constant number of particles (N), volume (V), and temperature (T) has been applied and in second step, it
was constant NPT (particle numbers, pressure, temperature) under the pressure of 1 atmosphere and
temperature 298K. For the nonbonded interactions, short range Lennard-Jones and Coulomb interaction
have been used. After final step of each simulation, obtained trajectories and results were analyzed using
the graphical tool Origin pro.
To compute the interaction free energies of protein: ligand complex (ΔGbind), we have used
Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MMPBSA) method [40] sourced from the
GROMACS and APBS packages. The model contains both repulsive and attractive components [41]. The
snapshots at every 100 ps between 0 and 10 ns were collected to predict the binding energy. The binding
free energy of the bound ligand: receptor complex in aqueous solvent can be expressed by following
equations:

Gbind ,aqu  H  T S  EMM  Gbind ,solv  T S ………………..(1)
∆𝐸𝑀𝑀 = ∆𝐸𝑐𝑜𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑡 + ∆𝐸𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑐 + ∆𝐸𝑉𝑎𝑛 𝑑𝑒𝑟 𝑊𝑎𝑎𝑙𝑠 ……………….(2)
∆𝐸𝑐𝑜𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑡 = ∆𝐸𝑏𝑜𝑛𝑑 + ∆𝐸𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑙𝑒 + ∆𝐸𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 ………………………….(3)
∆𝐺𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑑,𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑣 = ∆𝐺𝑝𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑟 + ∆𝐺𝑛𝑜𝑛𝑝𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑟 ,…………………………………….(4)

7

where ∆𝐸𝑀𝑀 , ∆𝐺𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑑,𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑣 , -TΔS are the molecular mechanical energy changes in gas phase, solvation free
energy change and conformational energy change due to binding, respectively. ∆𝐸𝑀𝑀 is the combination
of covalent, electrostatic and Van der Waals energy changes. Covalent energy is the combination of bond,
angle and torsion. ∆𝐺𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑑,𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑣 is separated into its polar and nonpolar contribution. The entropy term is
approximated with a normal mode method using a few selected snapshots. For binding free energy
calculation, the MMPBSA method usually begins after the MD simulation of the complex using the singletrajectory approach [42].
2.4. Computational Facility
For the MD simulation and GMM/PBSA computation works we have used Dell Gen9 system (8
Core I7 processors) with 16 GB of RAM with GPU NVIDIA MX130.

3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Analysis of Drug Likeness Properties of Choline
The inhibition properties of probe molecule choline have been studied through SWISS ADME
software to determine physicochemical descriptors and to predict ADME (Adsorption, Distribution,
Metabolism and Excretion) parameters: pharmacokinetic properties, drug like nature and medicinal
chemistry friendliness [43]. From the data mentioned in Table 1 we can see that choline was satisfying
the most prescribed virtual screening properties like Ro5 as it has molecular weight less than 500 g/mol,
TPSA values less than 40 Å². H-bond donors  5, H-bond acceptor  10, synthetic accessibility count
between less than 5 so that they can be synthesized easily. It also follows Veber rule that means it satisfies
all the bioavailability conditions. Its pharmacokinetics validate its neuroprotective role for the brain
development. All medicinal chemistry parameters suggests that choline has no liver cytotoxicity effect in
terms or drug induced liver injury for humans, null mutagenicity reveals that choline can cause no
abnormal genetic mutations leading to cancer. It has no cardio toxicity also. According to ADMET
(https://vnnadmet.bhsai.org/) data the maximum recommended therapeutic dose is 5.2 mg/day.

3.2. Analysis of Molecular Docking Results
For receptor protein: 6LU7 and potential inhibitor: choline, docking result showed best 9 suitable
pose structures for the choline: 6LU7 complex with their RMSD/ub (upper bound) and RMSD/lb (lower
bound) variations. For pose 1 we obtained highest negative value of binding energy (-3.7 kcal/mol),
lowest value of complex driending energy (104.198), and lowest value of inhibition constant (ki = 1.92
8

x10-3 M) at room temperature (298 K) as the best fit structure of ligand: receptor complex (Figure 2, Table
2). We have repeated the docking simulation several times and got the variation in binding affinity for the
best pose structure in between -3.7 kcal/mol to -3.4 kcal/mol. Usually, the dreiding energy values for
individual protein and ligand are found to be different, but when they form complex the dreiding energy
of the complex is found to be smaller than that of the individual protein and ligand. The complex structure
having minimum dreiding energy corresponds to the most favourable structure [44]. In the same way for
the best pose (1) structure the lowest ki value proved the higher affinity of choline towards receptor 6LU7.
The computed ki value is far lower than the toxicity dose range of choline (Table 1) which validate the
strong candidature of choline as a proposed drug for CoV2 infection. Maximum value of dipole moment
(5.374 debye) for pose 1 also validate the possibility of better complexation between choline and 6LU7
which arises due to the existence of strong electrostatic interaction (attractive type) between 6LU7 residue
GLU166 and positively charged nitrogen (N1) of choline. Again, the weak hydrogen bonded interactions
have significant role in defining the stability of protein: ligand complex as larger the number of nonbonded
interactions the more is the possibility of binding affinity in ligand: protein complexation and so the
possibility of formation of complex structure [45]. Maximum number of weak interactions (both
conventional hydrogen bonds and carbon hydrogen bonds) were observed for pose 1 of docked structure
between 6LU7 (Residues: GLY143, LEU141, HIS163, PHE140, ASN142) and choline (atoms: O1, H15,
C4, C2, C3) (Figure 2a,b, Table 2). So molecular docking results indicate that choline can be easily
inhibited inside the favourable pocket of 6LU7 protein and can form a stable choline: 6LU7 complex by
strong electrostatic bonding and weak hydrogen bonding between them. Existence of strong interaction
between choline and 6LU7 have been established by MD simulation results in next section.

3.3. Analysis of Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation Results
As per protocol of MD simulation, we have used the TIP3P water model to fulfill the solvation
process in a cubic box of the current choline: 6LU7 complex by adding 4Na+ external ions to maintain the
neutrality of the present structure (Figure 3a). For MD simulation, used force field is one of the important
parameter to estimate the intramolecular forces within the molecule and intermolecular forces between
molecules which helps to calculate the potential energy of the system of atoms or molecules. The
decomposition of the terms in the used force fields (CHARM36 and GROMOS43A2) is additive in nature
in terms of energy as:
𝐸𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 = 𝐸𝑏𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑑 + 𝐸𝑛𝑜𝑛𝑏𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑑 …………………………….(5)
𝐸𝑏𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑑 = 𝐸𝑏𝑜𝑛𝑑 + 𝐸𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑙𝑒 + 𝐸𝑑𝑖ℎ𝑒𝑑𝑟𝑎𝑙 ………………….(6)

𝐸𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑐 = 𝐸 𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑙𝑜𝑚𝑏𝑖𝑐 + 𝐸𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑎𝑟𝑑 𝐽𝑜𝑛𝑒𝑠 …………………..(8)

To quantify the strength of interaction between protein and ligand, nonbonded electrostatic interaction
plays a vital part. For nonbonded interaction, we are interested mainly on short range electrostatic part.
The whole MD simulation is performed under the varying time scale from 10000 ps to 100 ps. First, we
have studied the stability of each structures (host and complex). We have optimized the probe systems by
energy minimization process to get the minimum potential energy for both. For energetically stable
structures, we obtained steady convergence of potential energy with negative energy minimum and
maximum force value (Figure. 3b). For 6LU7 the computed average energy was -1.27x106 56.7 (kJ mol1

) for Epot, while for choline: 6LU7 it was -8.5 x 105  38.77 (kJ mol-1 ). Further to check the stability of

the structures under NVT and NPT equilibrated ensembles, we have tried to compute T, D, P, V of the
probe systems within a varying time trajectory 100ps – 10000 ps. Simulated progression data showed that
temperature of each system (receptor, complex) reached to a stable value (298K) very quickly (within 100
ps) and maintained the stability throughout the whole simulation process for both applied force fields (cf.
Figure 4a). Same type of stability has been observed for density, pressure, volume throughout the varying
time scale (Inset of Figure 4a). After running the whole simulation process we have computed several
thermodynamics parameters of choline: 6LU7 complex in comparison to bare 6LU7 to understand the
possible conformational arrangements during complexation throughout the whole time trajectory. The
parameters are RMSD, RMSF, nonbonded interaction energy, hydrogen bonds, Rg, etc. (Table 3) [46].
RMSD is used to check the stability of host protein due to ligand binding with respect to the reference
backbone structures of protein. Figure 4b has shown the RMSD values of carbon backbone for choline:
6LU7 complex with respect to 6LU7 for the time scale trajectory up to 1 ns in 3D view (Figure 4b). For
better understanding a 2D diagram is also provided in the inset of Figure 4b for larger time trajectory 1
ns-10 ns. It is observed that RMSD for complex showed a variation between 0.14-0.26 ( 0.01) nm
compared to 6LU7 variation 0.12- 0.18 ( 0.01) nm which indicate the possibility of structure fluctuation
during choline binding. The larger fluctuation in complex structure mainly arises between 7.5 ns – 10 ns
time scale. Still the closeness between the average RMSD values of complex (0.18 nm) with host 6LU7
(0.16 nm) validated the stable docked choline: 6LU7 formation. Similarly for RMSF, residue fluctuations
of 6LU7 in complex were found to be very small with respect to the 6LU7 in terms of C carbon. Closeness
and less fluctuations in RMSF values suggest that choline: 6LU7 docked complex structure has not
12

effected the host protein structure which remained mostly unaltered during simulation (supporting
document SD1).

Table 3. Statistical data obtained by Molecular dynamic simulations for 6LU7 in its bare state without
any ligand and in the complex state with ligand choline.
The radius of gyration (Rg) of a protein ligand complex or basic backbone protein gives us the hint
of compressed nature of the probe system [47]. Variation of Rg values over the whole time trajectory
showed that the host 6LU7 and choline: 6LU7 complex showed a quite stable and compressed structures
without lacking any major expansion/contraction throughout the simulation period. Both complex and
base protein structures have reported Rg values between 2.25-2.26 nm with an average value of 2.250.01
nm (SD2). Currently mostly used anti-COVID-19 drugs are Remdesivir, Favipiravir, hydrochloroquine.
In Remdesivir the average Rg value is reported to be 2.2 0.1 nm [48]. Favipiravir and hydroxychloroquine
are also expected to show similar compactness due to their similar type of binding affinity towards 3CLpro
protease as per Ref. [49]. The value of Remdisivir exactly matches with the average Rg value obtained for
choline. This justifies the candidature of choline as a proposed CoV2 inhibitor. Similarly, SASA measures
the area of receptor exposure to the solvents during the simulation process. In present study for 6LU7,
SASA value was obtained between 19-26 nm2 with a mean value of 22 nm2 whereas for choline: 6LU7
complex, it was observed between 16-20 nm2 with a mean value of 19 nm2 (SD3). The closeness of the
observed SASA values of both bare 6LU7 and it complex justified that ligand binding does not affect the
folding of the receptor protein very much.
15

Though weaker than ionic and covalent interaction, intermolecular hydrogen bonded interaction is
a predominant contributor for complex formation. 3.5Å cut-off condition has been used to find number of
hydrogen bonds. In the present study we have observed a variation of number of hydrogen bonding
between 0 to 6 throughout the whole time trajectory with an average value of 2.6 (SD4). Obtained
numbers perfectly matches with the molecular docking results and further validate the stability of choline:
6LU7 complexation. Short-range nonbonded interaction energy used to quantify the strength of the
interaction between components of a complex. For the present case we have presented the variation of
short range Coulombic interaction energy and short range Lennard-Jones interaction energy versus time
(0- 10000 ps) for choline: 6LU7 complex and presented in 3D Figure 5a and Table 3. Energy values
showed a stable nature up to 7000 ps of time scale data. Computed data revealed the less effect of binding
affinity due to Coulombic interaction energy (-50.776 20.12 kJ mol-1 ) compared to Lennard-Jones
interaction energy (-95.26 22.10 kJ mol-1 ). Time resolved variation of energy values are also found to
match perfectly with the RMSDs of the complex for full time scale region.
To establish the stronger ligand binding affinities towards receptor we have applied the MM/PBSA
method which deals with net free binding energy (ΔG) change as a sum of comprehensive set of energies
of individual components. Molecular docking only suggest the binding energy of the complex while ΔG
indicates the nonbonding interaction energies of the binding region for the complex formation. The
average MM/PBSA free binding energy (ΔGbind) of choline in complex was obtained as -33.497 kJ/mol
which is good enough due to its well binding affinity towards SARS-CoV2 protease. The Van der Waal
energy (Evdw) component (-34.656 kJ/mol) also showed very good binding affinity of choline towards
6LU7 whereas electrostatic energy (Eelectrostatic) did not show any significant role (-7.380 kJ/mol) in the
complexation process. The variation of all energies needed for ΔG (energy in vacuum, polar and nonpolar
solvation energies) is described in Figure 5b. Figure 5c shows the average free ΔGbind in the whole time
trajectory. All the MD simulation results reported in this work and summarized above validate that
choline can make an impressively stable complex with SARS-Cov2 protein after binding to the active
sites of this 3CLpro protease.

4. Conclusion
CoV2 infection is anticipated to affect fetal development in a manner similar to other respiratory
viruses which are known to be responsible for the maternal inflammatory response on the fetus and
placenta. Earlier studies have established that if would be mother gets infected by a respiratory
coronaviruses during early pregnancy, higher prenatal choline level in her body can safeguard the
developing brain of the fetus from the adverse effects of CoV2 infection. There are many natural recourses
17

of choline (e.g., vegetables, egg, milk, whole grains, herbal plants). Our ADME analysis (physiochemical,
pharmacokinetics, drug likeness, medicinal chemistry) have found a strong inhibitory possibility of
choline for SARS-CoV2 protease 3CLpro. Molecular docking results with strong binding binding affinity,
lowest inhibition constant and existence of hydrogen bonded interaction have established the possibility
of existence of choline: 6LU7 complex structure. Various thermodynamic parameters (Epot, T, V, D, Rg,
SASA energy, interaction energies, ΔGbind) obtained by Molecular dynamics simulation have validated
the complexation between choline and CoV2 protein (6LU7). Summarizing all simulated output and
interpreting their analysis have helped us to establish choline as a strong candidate to be used as a potential
inhibitor for SARS-CoV2. We believe that our present in silico study would provide a lead for the prenatal
drug development for the treatment of COVID-19. Still to efficiently target CoV2 infections, production
of high quality concentrated choline extract and in vivo, in vitro experimental validation of the present
work and clinical studies are defensible.
