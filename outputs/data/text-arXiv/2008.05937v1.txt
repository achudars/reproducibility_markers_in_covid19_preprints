Abstract
The generalized logistic equation is used to interpret the COVID-19 epidemic data in several
countries: Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Italy, Turkey and South Korea. The model
coefficients are calculated: the growth rate and the expected number of infected people, as well
as the exponent indexes in the generalized logistic equation. It is shown that the dependence of
the number of the infected people on time is well described on average by the logistic curve
(within the framework of a simple or generalized logistic equation) with a determination
coefficient exceeding 0.8. At the same time, the dependence of the number of the infected people
per day on time has a very uneven character and can be described very roughly by the logistic
curve. To describe it, it is necessary to take into account the dependence of the model
coefficients on time or on the total number of cases. Variations, for example, of the growth rate
can reach 60%. The variability spectra of the coefficients have characteristic peaks at periods of
1

several days, which corresponds to the observed serial intervals. The use of the stochastic
logistic equation is proposed to estimate the number of probable peaks in the coronavirus
incidence.

1. Introduction
Already in this century, several global epidemics have broken out (bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, avian influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), etc.). The latest
coronavirus epidemic (CODIV-19) struck everyone with its scale and affected literally all
countries forced to take emergency measures to prevent the infection spread of (closure of state
borders, quarantine, self-isolation, temporary work break of many enterprises and institutions,
transition to distance work and training). The number of people infected in the world exceeds
4.89 million people (the data from end-May 2020), and the number of deaths is more than
320,000 people. General information about this viral infection can be found on the Internet. The
dynamics of the disease spread is illustrated in Fig. 1, built according to the World Health
Organization (WHO) website (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus2019/situation-reports) on 05/20/2020. In this figure, the growth in the number of coronavirus
cases in the world and in several countries is indicated in a semi-logarithmic scale. The dashed
lines show exponential asymptotics corresponding to doubling the number of cases in a certain
number of days. Asterisks indicate the days when countries introduced restrictive measures. As
one can see, the nature of the epidemics spread in each country follows almost the same
scenario, first there is an exponential growth (or close to exponential) of the number of infected
people, and then this growth slows down (however, the numerical values of the constants
describing these curves are different for different countries). In some countries, the number of
2

cases is no longer increasing, so the coronavirus epidemic in these countries is almost over. In
other countries, the curves in these coordinates are still almost straight lines, which means an
exponential increase in the number of cases, and the epidemic has not yet reached its peak. In
general, these curves are quite smooth, although some of them show bends associated with the
action of certain quarantine measures.

Fig. 2 presents the dynamics of the infection by days, built on the same data. In contrast
to Fig. 1, the curves in Fig. 2 are not smooth, and sporadic outbreaks of the number of cases are
noticeable in them, which is caused by many, often unpredictable reasons. These data show that
in the dynamics of the epidemic spread there are different scales from several months (the total
epidemic duration), to several weeks (the incubation period), and even up to several days (the
serial interval and local causes). Some of the scales are associated with certain virus properties,
others – with the action of the state and local authorities that introduced restrictive rules. The
3

noted features of the dynamics of the COVID-19 virus spread can be reproduced in mathematical
models.

country, according to the same data.
To explain the spread of epidemics and predict their consequences, a number of
mathematical models of different complexity levels are used. Historically, the first model is the
Verhulst logistic equation [1], representing a nonlinear first-order ordinary differential equation
(ODE) with constant coefficients. It is also used as the simplest model to describe the population
growth and advertising performance. Qualitatively, it explains the increase in the number of
disease cases over the time presented in Fig. 1: the exponential increase in the number of
infected people at the initial stage of the epidemic development and the tendency towards a
constant value by the end of the epidemic. In the context of COVID-19, this model is used in [2],
[3]. The COVID-19 data analysis given in [4], showed that an exponential increase in the
number of cases at the initial stage is found mainly in America and Australia, while in many
European countries it is a power law. In this case, one can use the generalized logistic equation
[5], [6], and it was used in [3], [7], [8], [9]. From the mathematical point of view, the dynamics
4

in the framework of the logistic equation is trivial. More complex dynamics, including chaotic,
arise in the different logistic equation or when the delay for the incubation period is accounted
for [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], and these models are also used to interpret and forecast COVID19 [15], [16], [17]. In more complex models, people are divided into different groups: (S) The
susceptible class: those individuals who are capable of contracting the disease and becoming
infected, (I) The infected class: those individuals who are capable of transmitting the disease to
others, and (R) The removed class: infected individuals who are deceased, or have recovered and
are either permanently immune or isolated, so the mathematical model called SIR model and its
generalizations, includes a higher-order ODE system. The dynamics of such systems has not yet
been sufficiently studied, and stochastic oscillations are possible in it [18], [19], [20], [21], [22],
[23], [24], [25], [26]. However, models of this level can be comparatively easily implemented,
they have shown their effectiveness and are actively used to model the distribution of COVID-19
[27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38].
There are also models that take into account, for example the super-spreading
phenomenon of some individuals or quarantine measures, including social distancing and
isolation policies, border control, and a high number in the percentage of reported cases [39 this
issue], [40 this issue], [41 this issue].
The statistical methods to forecast the epidemic development, based on Poisson statistics,
are also worth mentioning [42], [43], [44], [45].
The main difficulty in applying mathematical models is associated with the uncertainty of
the choice of coefficients in the equations. The more complex is the model, the larger is the
number of its coefficients. The experience of using models to interpret “old” epidemics may not
always help, since the intensity of the virus impact on living organisms changes, many epidemics
were local, and, accordingly, measures to prevent the epidemic spread were different. The
pattern of the curves shown in Figs. 1 and 2, shows their strong differences for different
5

countries, which is associated with different population density, differences in their customs,
traditions and administrative preventive measures. Therefore, any forecasts at the initial stage of
the epidemic development regarding its final stage are very rough and unreliable. As the
epidemic develops, more and more constants in the equations can be determined from medical
databases, but the previous constants are also corrected. Therefore, in essence, for prognostic
purposes, equations with variable coefficients are solved, which mathematical properties
(existence, convergence and stability) are not defined. As a result, different models with
permanently “corrected” coefficients can lead to close forecast results for a short time. At the
same time, for long-term forecasts, it is necessary to understand the possible temporal variability
of the model coefficients, and their influence on the character of the obtained solutions.
In this study, we will try to assess the character of the scatter of the logistic model
coefficients and its generalizations on the basis of the currently available COVID-19 data. The
data of the epidemic development were used for the following countries: Austria, Switzerland,
the Netherlands, Italy, Turkey and South Korea. Section 2 presents the classical logistic equation
and shows the calculations of the coefficient average values within this equation for the above
mentioned countries. It has been shown that this model with a high determination coefficient is
suitable to describe the number of patients with coronavirus in most countries, except for South
Korea. To take into account the data randomness on the number of cases per day, it is proposed
to switch to a stochastic logistic equation with external force. The spectral and statistical
properties of random parameters of this equation are investigated. Section 3 describes the same
procedure within the framework of the generalized logistic equation. It is shown that, on average,
this model is suitable for all the countries listed above with a high determination coefficient.
Section 4 summarizes the results.

2. Logistic equation
Here we will give briefly the main information on the logistic equation theory written in
the standard ODE form

 N 

(1)

where N(t) is the total number of people affected by the epidemic, N is the maximum number
of the infected people during the whole epidemic, and r is the growth rate of the epidemic. The
solution of this equation with constant coefficients can be easily found in the form
N (t ) 

N 0 N  exp(rt )
,
N   N 0  exp(rt )  1

(2)

where N0 is the initial number of the infected people and t is the time from the beginning of the
epidemic. At the initial stage of the epidemic, it can be represented by an exponential function

N (t )  N0 exp(rt ) ,

(3)

and, if this curve approximates the increase in the number of cases at the initial stage well, we
will be able to determine the growth rate r. At the same stage, the logistic model can be rejected
if the data do not fit in with the exponential dependence. At the same time, the most important
characteristic for prediction – the maximum possible number of the infected people N – can be
estimated only at the stage of the noticeable difference between the data and the exponential
curve, when the number of sick people is already not small.
To prepare medical institutions to function in an optimal way during an epidemic, it is
important to know the number of infected people per day, which is easily obtained when Eq. (2)
is differentiated

and this curve is nonmonotonic with the maximum given by

 dt 

(5)

which corresponds to the time (the epidemic peak)
1 N  N0
.
T  ln 
r

(6)

As it can be seen, these characteristics (Eqs. (5) and (6)) can only be estimated when the data are
no longer described by an exponential curve and both model parameters r and N are found or
known.
Let us note that the time dependences (2) and (4) are smooth functions, while from Fig. 2
it follows that dependence (4) must be non-smooth and irregular. The study of the resulting
irregularity is carried out below.
Since medical statistics operates with the cases per day, it is in fact necessary to solve the
difference logistic equation

K n  N n 1  N n  rN n 1  n  .
 N 

(7)

After removing the index n, we obtain a simple relationship between the number of cases per day
(K) and the total number of cases (N)


N 
K  rN 1 
,

(8)

which in these variables is a parabola.
As an example, we will take the data on the coronavirus incidence in several countries
where the epidemic is close to its end (at least its active phase is over). These countries are
Austria (number of points 58), Switzerland (58 points), the Netherlands (64 points), Italy (72
8

points), Turkey (49 points) and South Korea (number of points 94). We will operate with the

shows the relationship between the number of cases per day (K) and the total number of cases
(N) for each country. Parabolic approximations (the solid lines) arising from (8) are also
presented here. Non-simultaneous 95% prediction bounds for response values (the dashed lines)
are shown as well.
Evidently, the parabolic approximation of the available data is good enough for almost all
of the listed countries (R2 > 0.8), but obviously has low accuracy for South Korea (R2 ~ 0.55).
Therefore, later in this section we will not use the data on South Korea, for which the logistic
model is not suitable (this case is analyzed in the next section). Despite a good approximation of
the data for most countries of the logistic curve, the scatter of points near the parabolic curve is
still not small; it indicates that it is necessary to consider the coefficients of the parabolic curve
as the time functions, which, in essence, is done in the forecasts when these coefficients are
refined when new data appear. Let us, for example, change only the coefficient r. Within the
framework of the logistic model, this coefficient variability can be determined from the available
data by using the following formula, arising from (8):

Actually, there are two ways of analyzing this coefficient; it can be either a function of the
number of cases (N) or time (t). In the former case, the logistic equation remains to be the ODE
with constant coefficients, but it has a rather complex nonlinearity. In the latter case we come to
the ODE with variable coefficients. We study both possibilities of changing the growth rate
coefficient r. Fig. 4, top, shows the variability of the function r(N) for Austria and Switzerland.
For convenience, we switched to a dimensionless variable rnorm  r  r / r , for its variability to
be more obvious. Herewith we didn’t take into account the first few days, when nothing is clear
with the epidemic, and the last few days, when the epidemic was essentially over, since these
points correspond to the small values of the denominator in Eq. (9). Reducing the number of
points, of course, affects somewhat the average value of this coefficient (for Austria 0.225
instead of 0.195 as in Fig. 3, 0.2 instead of 0.16 for Switzerland), but more important is the
demonstration of variability of the coefficient r. Functional dependence r(N) can be rewritten in
more familiar terms of temporal variability r(t), presented in Fig. 4, bottom, where it is
demonstrated that this coefficient changes almost every day. As an example, let us give the
amplitude spectrum of the coefficient variation r, relative to the average, for Austria and
Switzerland (Fig. 5, left). Peaks corresponding to intra-weekly variability are clearly visible on
the spectrogram due to the fluctuation properties of the epidemic spread, which are different
inside condominiums with different apartment numbers or on farms far from each other. In fact,
changes in model coefficients can be considered to be random. The probability distribution of the
same coefficient for Austria and Switzerland is characterized by the probability density (Fig. 5,
right), which is well described by a normal curve. The standard deviation is not small (60-70%),
that fact speaks once again about the necessity to take into account the growth rate variability in
the epidemic dynamics.
Similar conclusions can be drawn for other countries, but we will not consider them in
detail. From the analysis given above it is clear that, on average, the epidemic development in a
number of countries is well described by the logistic equation with constant coefficients.
11

However, to give a more detailed understanding of variations in the number of cases per day, it is
reasonable to consider a stochastic logistic equation

dN
 r (t ) N 1  p(t ) N  ,
dt

(10)

or its difference analogue, in the general case with two random functions. From the point of view
of the available data, the coefficients can be also considered to be random functions of the case
number. The properties of a stochastic equation (Eq. (10)) have been investigated yet.

Fig. 4. The normalized growth rate coefficient rnorm  r  r / r as a function of the total
number of the infected people (N) – the upper panel and of time (t) – the lower panel: left – for
Austria, right – for Switzerland.

Switzerland. Distribution parameters for Austria: standard deviation 0.6, skewness 0.7, kurtosis
0.4; for Switzerland: standard deviation 0.7, skewness 1.2, kurtosis 3.2.
In fact, another way to take into account the initial data irregularity is possible, namely,
the introduction of an external random force in Eq. (1), as is often done in problems of
mechanics:


dN
N 
 rN 1 
  f (t ) ,
dt
 N 

(11)

considering all the coefficients constant. The external force is easily found from the available
data using the equation following from Eq. (11):


N 
f  K  rN 1 
.
 N 

13

(12)

Fig. 6 shows the dependence of the “external force” f calculated by formula (12) on the total
number of cases N (the upper panel) and on the time t (the lower panel) for Austria (left) and
Switzerland (right). The magnitude of variations in the external force f is rather small (less than
10% of the total number of cases), and in this sense it does not significantly affect the curve
behavior N(t), but it becomes important to analyze the variability of K(t). The probability
characteristics of the values of f are shown in Fig. 7 for Austria. The distribution density is well
approximated by the Gaussian curve with an average value of 10 and a standard deviation of
132. The differences from the Gaussian curve are characterized by the skewness of 1.1 and
kurtosis equal to 2. Similar conclusions can be made for the epidemic data in other countries.

Thus, in principle, stochastic generalizations of the logistic equation can be considered

(13)

or its difference analogue with an external random force, depending on the number of cases or on
time. It will explain the irregularities in the number of cases per day, and the appearance of
several peaks of incidence and their duration, which are not predicted by the deterministic
logistic equation.
3. Generalized logistic model
We will now consider a more general model of a logistic equation containing four
constants [5], [6]

(14)

When     1 , Eq.(14) coincides with Eq. (1). Again, our goal is not to solve the equation, but
to investigate the relationship between the number of cases per day (K) and the total number of
the infected people (N), which is expressed by the algebraic curve resulting from (14):

15



N 



(15)

Let us consider this model applicability to the description of the development of the
COVID-19 epidemic in the same countries as above: Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands,
Italy, Turkey and South Korea. Figure 8 presents the data from medical statistics and
approximations from Eq. (15).
It follows from Fig. 8 that the approximation accuracy has increased for all countries (R2
= 0.86 – 0.97), including South Korea (R2= 0.91), for which a simple logistic model was not
suitable at all. In fact, it is the consequence of the general statistics rule that an increase in the
number of parameters of the approximation curve leads to an increase in the correlation
coefficient, so there is nothing surprising here. More interesting are the magnitude of the
exponent indexes in Eqs. (14), (15) and their differences from the unity in a simple logistic
model. The power  varies from 0.6 to 1.2, and it is not very far from the unity. Nevertheless,
this leads to a qualitative difference in the behavior of the growth curve of the case number at the
initial epidemic stage. So, Eq. (14) with a small number of cases is easily solved

In contrast to the simple logistic model, where the increase in the case number occurs according
to the exponential law, in the generalized logistic model with   1 the growth occurs according
to the power law. As it is noted in the Introduction, a power law of gradual increase in the
number of cases during the COVID-19 epidemic is typical for many countries [4], so the
generalized logistic curve is in good agreement with the medical statistics data.

the pink line, the dashed line shows non-simultaneous 95% prediction bounds for response
values for the generalized model. The green line shows a parabolic curve in the framework of a
simple logistic model (Eq. (8)): a – Austria: N   18500 , r = 0.151,   1.1 ,   2.56 , R2=
0.88; b – Switzerland: N   32100 , r = 1.093,   0.8 ,   1.5 , R2= 0.86; c – the Netherlands:
N∞= 41950, r = 4.702, α = 0.6, β = 0.7, R2= 0.94; d – Italy: N∞= 499300, r = 0.994,   0.8 , β =
5.1, R2= 0.96; e – Turkey: N∞= 146500, r = 3.573, α = 0.7, β = 1.07, R2= 0.975; f – Suth Korea:
N   16200 , r = 0.143,   1.2 ,   5.4 , R2= 0.91.
17

The range of values of  is rather wide, from 0.7 to 5.4. The values of   1 , lead to an
asymmetric deformation of function K(N) towards small values, and means that the epidemic
peak is relatively fast, while the end of the epidemic is delayed.
Let us now evaluate the variability of the coefficients of the generalized logistic model
from the known data for Austria and Switzerland (to see what differences the generalized logistic
model brings) and South Korea, for which a simple logistic model does not work properly. The
growth rate variability is given by the formula

cases (N) – left, and on the time (t) – right, in the framework of the generalized logistic model
(14) for Austria, Switzerland and South Korea (top to bottom). Fig. 10 shows the spectrum of
variations and the distribution histogram. For Austria and Switzerland, the characteristics of
variability have not changed much compared to those considered above, which is to be expected,
since both models give similar results for them. But now we can evaluate the growth rate
variability for South Korea, for which a simple logistic model does not work. In general, the
characteristics of variability are close for different countries, in the sense that the spectra have
peaks at close frequencies and the histograms are qualitatively similar.

Fig. 11 shows the calculated dependences of external force on the number of patients and
on the time. Its spectral and probability characteristics are illustrated by Fig. 12. The
corresponding graphs are similar to those within a simple logistic curve. We would like to
emphasize once again that a larger number of countries are properly described by this model, in
particular South Korea, demonstrating the qualitatively identical nature of the variability of the
logistic model coefficients.

4. Discussion and conclusions
Summarizing the results, we would like to emphasize, that with all its simplicity and crudity,
the logistic model describes properly the growth in the number of COVID-19 cases with time.
This is illustrated by Fig. 13, which shows the actual data and logistic curves. It is evident that
for many countries the use of the simple logistic equation leads to a very good agreement with
the available data. The use of a generalized logistic curve improves the agreement significantly,
including the countries for which the logistic model is too crude (for example, South Korea). It is
worth noting that the prognostic number of the total number of cases N in the generalized
logistic model is slightly higher than in the simple logistic model, and the approach to the
limiting constant value is delayed in time.
Fig. 14 illustrates the capabilities of the logistic model for describing the number of sick
people per day. On average, the theoretical model describes the real data rather well, but the
scatter of points is still not small, and sometimes deviations can reach 50% and higher, although
on average they are less than 50%. These differences are especially evident near the epidemic
peak when it is desirable to have a more accurate prognosis for medical facilities. The extent to
which this scatter is better described by other models (such as SIR models) will be clear in the
near future when the results of relevant studies appear. From the mathematical point of view, the
resulting difference in the use of the logistic model to describe two characteristics: the total
number of cases (N) and the number of cases per day (K) is obvious: the curve N(t) is the integral
with respect to K(t), and, therefore, it is smoother and more determined. To describe the
dependence K(t), at least on a qualitative level, it is better to use stochastic equations of a logistic
model of the Eq. (19) type, where external random forces or random coefficients are introduced.
They will help to understand the degree of the data spread, and, what is most important, the
number of possible large outliers during the epidemic. Such work remains to be done.

The authors understand that for the real forecast of the epidemic development, it is
necessary to have multifactor models, which include dividing the population into different
groups (children, the elderly, etc.), living conditions (traffic flows between territories, the
population density etc.). Such models should include high-order ODEs and PDEs, taking into
account lagging arguments and integral terms. Such complex models are being developed now,
yet we will not consider them here. Nevertheless, the analysis within the framework of simple
low-parameter models is important because it allows us to describe the process qualitatively, to
understand the role of certain factors, and to identify certain phenomena (stochastization,
fractality, nonlinearity) that are also interesting for other branches of physics and technology. In
this sense, the results obtained above demonstrate the capabilities of a well-developed logistic
model for describing an epidemic of such a grand scale as COVID-19.
