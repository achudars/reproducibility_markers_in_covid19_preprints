Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has forced changes in production and especially in human interaction, with "social distancing" a standard prescription for slowing transmission of the disease. This paper examines the
economic effects of social distancing at the aggregate level, weighing both
the benefits and costs to prolonged distancing. Specifically we fashion a
model of economic recovery when the productive capacity of factors of production is restricted by social distancing, building a system of equations
where output growth and social distance changes are interdependent. The
model attempts to show the complex interactions between output levels
and social distancing, developing cycle paths for both variables. Ultimately, however, defying gravity via prolonged social distancing shows
that a lower growth path is inevitable as a result.

Introduction

It is a well-known maxim in physics tracing back to Newton (1987) that the force
between two objects is proportional to the masses of these bodies but inversely
1

proportional to the square of their geographical distance, suggesting that the
proximity of an object is of paramount importance to its attraction to others.
Indeed, the gravity model of trade (Isard, 1954) is based precisely on this insight,
predicting trade ﬂows between countries to be higher (after controlling for trade
costs) for countries which are more proximate. Extensions to the gravity model
have also been employed for movements of peoples across borders and regions
(Stouﬀer, 1940; Niedercorn & Bechdolt Jr, 1969; Vanderkamp, 1977), using the
size of various regions as attractants (an agglomeration eﬀect) and the distance
between speciﬁc regions as a deterrent to migration. While there have been
some paradoxical ﬁndings from both of these literatures (see (Brun, Carrère,
Guillaumont, & De Melo, 2005) or Malmberg in (Hammar, Brochmann, Tamas,
& Faist, 2021, p. 21-48)), the underlying premise of the beneﬁts of proximity
has been generally accepted.
However, what occurs when distance is actually imposed, not a naturally
occurring phenomenon of ﬁxed geography but where economic actors are deliberately separated or forced further apart? Does the lesson of the gravity
model hold, with artiﬁcial distance leading to less economic interaction and,
subsequently, less output? The new reality of the COVID-19 pandemic has introduced precisely this possibility into economic life, as individual actors – in
order to lessen the likelihood of catching the disease – are remaining “socially
distanced” from each other; with an eye on keeping individuals at least 2 meters apart from each other, this distancing has been accomplished via a number
of public policies and directives, including stay-at-home orders (both limited
and more draconian), bans on large gatherings, and business closures (Abouk
& Heydari, 2021).
In an economic sense, the eﬀects of social distancing should be seen as a
positive in the long-term, as the spread of a potentially fatal disease is halted
(Sheridan, Andersen, Hansen, & Johannesen, 2020). By halting the destruction
of the labor stock and reducing the burdens on healthcare systems, a country can return to a long-term growth path (Bodenstein, Corsetti, & Guerrieri,
2021). Seen in this light, social distancing acts as a collective good, imposing
(hopefully) short-term restrictions and upfront costs in order to avoid larger
costs in the long run. This would be ampliﬁed in certain speciﬁc conditions,
where pre-existing attributes can make social distancing especially eﬀective: for
example, in countries where population has low density, where there are strong
borders, or where there is either trust (Durante, Guiso, & Gulino, 2021) or
social discipline which can make individuals adhere to social distancing more
stringently. In these situations, social distancing can indeed be a one-time shock,
and modelled accordingly (Mandel & Veetil, 2020).
Unfortunately, the short-term consequences of social distancing may be substantial (Ashraf, 2020) and could even outweigh the longer-run costs of a protracted pandemic in situations where social distancing may not be a discrete
event, leading to “waves” of contagion and, ultimately, output declines. In
such an environment, there can be signiﬁcant eﬀects on poverty and inequality
(Palomino, Rodríguez, & Sebastian, 2020) or the labor market (Gupta et al.,
2020). The distribution of eﬀects is also not uniform and may fall heavily on
2

speciﬁc sectors, in particular, industries which rely on turnover (such as hospitality and travel, see Gunay and Kurtulmus (2021) and Koren and Peto (2020)),
which may ﬁnd restrictions to be highly cumbersome (De Vos, 2020) or even
impact the most vulnerable members of society (Mongey et al. 2020). Additionally, the uncertainty surrounding the ability of business to transact as normal
(combined with other potentially economically destructive interventions by government) may deter long-term productive investment and increase risk aversion
(Piccillo & Van Den Hurk, 2020). Under these conditions, the collective good
of social distancing becomes just another risk management decisions, sacriﬁced
when other collective actions such as economic activity become necessary.
The purpose of this paper is to explore the economic ramiﬁcations of individual social distancing within a broader macroeconomy, capturing the complexity
of the trade-oﬀs between social distancing and economic activity. This is the
ﬁrst paper, to our knowledge, to incorporate the dynamics introduced during
the COVID-19 pandemic in an attempt to understand the eﬀect that social
distancing might have on an economy. Building a model of production which
accounts for the complex interaction between output level and social distancing,
our results show that social distancing, if maintained, can result in lower output
growth.

The Literature on Distancing

Perhaps not surprisingly, given the extraordinary public health measures associated with “social distancing,” there is a sparse literature on the eﬀects of
physical distance amongst individuals on economic activity, as opposed to the
vast literature on distance between countries. Indeed, most of the work done
on social distancing over the past year has come from the public health and
epidemiological literature, exploring the eﬃcacy of distancing on stopping the
spread of COVID-19. Papers such as Delen et al. (2020), McGrail et al. (2020),
and Park et al. (2020) provide data or modeling on the eﬀectiveness of social distancing, and there appears to be near unanimity within the epidemiological and
(especially) the public health literature on the desirability of social distancing
in a pandemic.
Of the few economic analyses which have been produced, they too have
focused on the economic eﬀects of the disease and how distancing could, by
hastening an end to the pandemic, have salutary economic beneﬁts. Key in
this vein is Greenstone and Nigham (2020), who estimated that the lives saved
from distancing, monetized using the US government’s value of a statistical life,
could have a value of approximately US$60,000 per household (as a working
paper, the authors admit that there is no estimation of the corresponding costs
of social distancing). A similar working paper from the NBER focuses instead
on the cost side, coming to the conclusion that no social distancing would lead
to COVID-related costs of US$12,700 per person, while an optimal social distancing policy would reduce these costs to US$8,100 per person; however, the
“optimal policy” explored here would “curtail activity for decades or until a cure

3

is found” (Farboodi, Jarosch, & Shimer, 2020, p. 36). Even though these costs
are, like Greenstone and Nigham (2020), linked to the costs associated with fatalities, the longer-run implications of curtailed activity over decade – and their
likely astounding economic costs – are not explored. Thunström et al.(2020), on
the other hand, attempt to combine both costs and beneﬁts into a net tally and
(using a slightly lower value of a statistical life, US$10 million, than Greenstone
and Nigham (2020)) ﬁnd that the beneﬁts of lived saved exceed the projected
economic disruption of social distancing by US$5.16 trillion.
Despite these papers focusing on the aggregate eﬀects of social distancing, it
is only a very small subset of these well-known papers which have examined the
channels via which the economic cost of social distancing accrues, and which
then attempt to array them against estimated beneﬁts. Koren and Peto (2020),
focusing on industries which rely on face-to-face contact, ﬁnd that sectors which
use customer visits or have a high proportion of customer-facing workers have
fared the worst due to social distancing measures; in terms of cost, the retail
sector, forced to virtually shut during the ﬁrst wave of the pandemic in the
United States, would have required a 234% wage subsidy in order to avoid unemployment losses. Similarly, Mongey et al. (2020), using individual level data
to show the most at-risk sectors, conclude that the costs of social distancing
falls disproportionately on lower educated workers, those unable to work from
home and those requiring high physical proximity, resulting in losses greater
than those seen during the global ﬁnancial crisis. Work from Barnett-Howell
and Mubarak (2020) echo this ﬁnding on an international level, showing that
social distancing is both less eﬀective and more destructive in poorer countries,
increasing hunger, deprivation, and morbidity from other causes. Barrot et al.
(2020) also expand this analysis beyond the most directly aﬀected sectors to
show how downstream industries in France are also aﬀected, arriving at an estimate of the cost of social distancing at approximately 5.6% of GDP. And, while
attempting to show a positive view of social distancing as preventing larger and
more protracted costs to an economy due to lost working hours and lives, Bodenstein et al. (2020) note that consumption holds up well despite social distancing,
but at a cost of a lower capital stock over time. This certainly has longer-term
ramiﬁcations for society, an intertemporal shift away from investment which can
place an economy on a lower growth path.
Another strand of the social distancing literature has focused on the drivers
of compliance with social distancing as a contingency on their eﬀectiveness.
While not directly related to the idea of costs from social distancing policies,
this work does reveal possible follow-on eﬀects which can impact an economy.
For example, research from Durante et al. (2021) shows that social distancing
was utilized most on a voluntary basis in areas where there were high levels of
“civic capital” (trust in others). In such a situation, cultural closeness could have
mitigated the eﬀects of social distance, although their work does not extend to
the economic eﬀects of this voluntary distancing. In a highly interesting study,
Stockmaier et al.(2021) also explore the voluntary social distancing behavior
of animals and insects, ﬁnding that social distancing is limited where there is
social or work pressure, and the need to provide and/or fend oﬀ other predators
4

makes social distancing a luxury.
A ﬁnal note is necessary here to bring us full circle: as noted at the beginning, the public health literature has concentrated on the eﬃcacy of social
distancing in reducing the spread of disease, but there are additional studies
from this literature which hint at the broader costs from social distancing. For
example, Venkatesh and Edirappuli (2020) discuss the sometimes-sizeable effects which can come to mental health from social distancing, especially for
those already at risk. Block et al. (2020) recognize this issue and argue for a
“strategic social network-based reduction of contact”, but as of yet the nuances
of such alternatives to strict social distancing are in their infancy (meaning that
the deleterious eﬀects of actual isolation persist). There is unfortunately little
understanding and no attempts (to our knowledge) to quantify these possible
eﬀects on the workforce and, thus, on economic activity.

Formal presentation

We have seen in section 2 that the underlying eﬀects of social distancing, and
especially the channels by which these eﬀects come to be, have been analyzed
in the literature using their own form of distancing, i.e. being rather isolated
and focusing on speciﬁc aspects of distancing rather than examining the issue
holistically. Indeed, this approach has yielded some insights, as it has examined
the long term beneﬁts of preserving the labor force (Bodenstein et al., 2021;
Greenstone & Nigam, 2020) given the possible cost of distancing (Farboodi et
al., 2020; Greenstone & Nigam, 2020), with the immediate economic cost also
calculated (Koren & Pető, 2020). However, as the relations between the various
attributes of social distancing are complex and may have diﬀerential economic
impacts, this section attempts to present a more comprehensive view to better
understand this complexity in an economic setting.
In order to model these relationships, we ﬁrst present a production function;
the agent’s decision exercise on how much labor he will supply subject to constrains which are adapted to the particular environment (social distancing and
the risk of being out of the market due to the spread of the pandemic). Along
the line of section 1 these assumptions are very Newtonian, in the sense that
their structure is very broadly used and is related to the forces acting upon the
agent externally.
The production function used in the model is:
Yt = F N K̄

(3.1)

by integrating constant capital K̄ and the technological constant F into a
single coeﬃcient A for simplicity we get
Yt = AN

(3.2)

where Yt represents output1 of period t, A is scale coeﬃcient; whereas N represents unconstrained production factors. Given that a minimum production

should be maintained we may subdivide 3.2
Yt = Ymin + AN

3.1

(3.3)

Budget restriction

With ﬁxed K̄ and A, we may approximate
Ẏ
Ṅ
≈
(3.4)
Y
N
Further, in view of 3.4, we assume that the utilization proportion of the
production factor N develops in the following way;
Nt+1 = Nt + [gNt + µ(−d)Nt ]

(3.5)

where g represents the growth rate of utilization of N ( and therefore production output) and µ is a parameter deﬁned in subsection 3.2; while d represents
social distancing.
With the following restriction to production with capital ﬁxed in the analysis
period
Yt+1 = Yt + [gYt + µ(−d)Yt ]

(3.6)

leading in continuous time to
Ẏ
= (g + µ(−d))
(3.7)
Y
Equation 3.7 shows the eﬀect of social distancing as imposing a restriction
over dynamic paths of output Y . The factor g is a growth rate which may
assume modest positive values in normal times (usually scaled as no greater
that 0.1 per year), whereas in exceptional times or a crisis may assume negative
values.

3.2

Policy and structural parameters

The factor µ of equation 3.7 is set as a parameter. The greater social distancing
d the more impact over output Y will occur, as indicated by µ. The higher Y or
d, the higher the restraint of the growth of Y . The intuition is that the higher
income Y is, the more possibilities exist to restrain or cut production as shown
in section 1.
While the general direction is set by the relations of equation 3.7, the precise quantitative impact depend on the set of complex economic policies2 put
forward. This is the justiﬁcation to leave µ as a parameter with some degree of
freedom. It is constrained by policies setters and by the reaction of the system
and determined by the technological relation of the production function. For

example, if a policy of closing borders is set, the impact on output is given by the
existent technology and sector breakdown; i.e. if the tourism branch constitute
a huge proportion of the economy µ will be greater.
As a concrete example of the problems involved in setting the value of µ,
consider the (extreme) case of an economy whose production consist almost
entirely of the output of the software sector. In this case, it is even conceivable
to assume that the second term of the RHS of equation 3.7 may be positive.
Another important point of the model is that it is able to deal with the
acceleration in the technological change in some labor markets routines. When
the working force mobility is replaced by home working and teleworking, the
output recovering may be faster and higher.

3.3

Response to distancing

For the possibility to derive the response of the agents as an individual behavior3 ,
we take
U = U (Ct , 1 − NS )

(3.8)

where U represent utility and C consumption. In this context, we interpret
1 − NS not as leisure, but as tolerance to social distancing d. which is subject
to
Pt Ct = Wt Nt
(3.9)
with W standing for Wage and P for prices.
Upon introducing the deﬁnition of consumption form equation 3.9 to equation 3.8 we obtain

and by diﬀerentiating completely we obtain the ﬁrst order condition for
utility maximization for the agent

where the ﬁrst term of the RHS measures the marginal beneﬁt of the use of the
unit of labor whereas the second term refers to the cost, which we assume
U1−NS = τ d

(3.12)

By taking NS = ND which is equivalent to state that factor’s N demand is
enough at the wage rate W
P to employ NS .
So, social distancing d will decline as
3 It is important to note that this approach is not the only possibility, as cultural factors
may be taken into account also as base for the proportion in which the effectiveness of d
decays.

7

d˙ = −τ d

(3.13)

The intuition behind equation 3.13 is that, with time, wage earners will be
willing to work for a lower wage rate. This not necessarily implies a lower real
wage rate for each individual, it is conceivable that the wage rate becomes lower
due to various type of risk involved; such as ﬁnes, diﬃculties in transportation
and social critic among others. Form equation 3.13 we may see that with time,
owners of factor N will tend to accept lower retributions because of most urgent necessities. The last eﬀect operates simultaneously (is the counterpart of)
with a lesser tolerance of social distancing d. Therefore we expect that τ will
take positive values, less than one taking account of a progressive decay of the
eﬀectiveness of d.

3.4

Susceptibility

Now let us formalize the causes of growing social distancing d. This measure
is imposed to protect factor N by limiting social interaction. By doing so it
reduces also output Y by assumption 3.4. For simplicity we assume that the
growth of d can be expressed with a parameter ρ.
To explain parameter ρ we may have in mind the eﬀect of the infection by
referring to the simple Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model:
Ω̇ = aΩΓ

(3.14)

Γ̇ = aΩΓ − bΓ

(3.15)

Λ̇ = bΓ

(3.16)

where Ω is the fraction of susceptible individuals, Γ is the fraction of infectious individuals, and Λ is the fraction of recovered individuals4 ; a is the
transmission rate per infectious individual, and b is the recovery rate.
Linearizing about the disease-free equilibrium (DFE)
Γ̇ = (a − b)Γ

(3.17)

Thus, if a − b > 0, then Γ grows exponentially around the DFE.
By 3.17 we may approximate ρ by the following equation:
ρ ≈ Φ(a − b)

(3.18)

So, ρ will be deﬁned as function Φ of the rate of infection a less recovered
cases b. In this way we have no restrictions over ρ allowing changes in a wide
range to see the impact on activity and output.
The variable d will change as a function of the impact that ρ (net of recovered) has on a given level of output.
4 Where we suppose that all these proportions Ω, Γ, Λ are related to the unrestricted production factor N and by equation 3.4 to output Y .

8

Hence, social distancing d will grow in a proportion ρ respect to factor N
(which is susceptible to lose his productions capabilities) and therefore by assumption 3.4 to output Y .
In short, social distancing d will be growing in proportion ρ respect to income
Y.
This would lead to adjust equation 3.13 with an additional term

The system of equations

If we put together equations 3.7 and 3.19 we obtain the system

This system deﬁnes the dynamic interactions between output and social
distancing based on an unconstrained growth rate g, a parameter µ, the reaction
(decay of d) τ and ρ which refers to the susceptibility of d to income Y or factor
N given the relation 3.4. In particular, the assumptions are: a budget restriction
given by equation 3.6, a behavior assumption of agents via equation 3.13 and
the susceptibility of the factor to not being able to produce via equation 3.18.
The remaining factor µ is set as a policy and structural parameter which may
vary with policies, economic structure or system responses to diﬀerent scenarios;
it refers to the eﬀect that d has over the variation of Y . 

Note that if d = 0 we obtain a simple case of income growing at his technical
possibilities.
Under this framework, social distancing dynamics are lagging that of output5 , an increase in output means an increment of contacts of N .
The dynamics of the model implies that some quantity adaptation in output
is done; distancing necessarily triggers lower output6 .

Note that while the structure of the assumptions is very broadly used, we
are not able to present deterministic results (or a range given some stochastic
assumption). We present drivers of the parameters g, µ, τ, ρ but we are not
aware of models that have suﬃcient theoretical and predicting power to provide
these type of quantiﬁcation. The alternative is to simulate some paths.

Simulations and results

To avoid the problems that simple binary presentations of beneﬁt and costs may
suggest7 (i.e. health vs output) in terms of actions that they may trigger; we
work with a more complete set of parameters which we presented in section 3.
As the interrelation between the diﬀerent elements are extremely complex,
in our attempt to get a sense of these combined dynamics we use some basic
simulations (see subsection 3.5).
We run dynamic paths8 ; two ﬁgures are presented, one for the space of output
and distancing and another for the temporal evolution of both variables. We
present the parameters in annual scale and use Y for Income, d for distancing,
T for trajectories and t for time in the ﬁgures.

4.1

Extreme cases

First we present two extreme cases. In both, the short range of time does not
allow to show the impact of contagion or distancing interactions with output
making it diﬃcult to match real economic conditions. This extremely short time
convergence may explain why we are not able to see examples of this paths in
practice.
We may see a "d dominant, recession" case in ﬁgure 19 . For the recessive
case the high value of reaction of the economy to distancing (µ = 1.1) does not
allow the system to react to retain a cycle with income ﬂuctuations.

We show a sequence of cases where the ﬁrst one represent the initial state

parameters is redeﬁned, so the path is robust from a Lucas critique (Lucas Jr,
1976) perspective.
In the case of ﬁgure 3 we have high contagion with low distancing measures
(agent have not learned how to protect themselves and distancing measures are
at a low level)11 .

Figure 6: Trajectories of Y and d
Following the sequence of the ﬁgures (3; 4; 5) as phases od the dynamic
process we can see that initially the impact of the contagion ﬁnds a ﬁrst phase
where the level of activity continues to exceed the distancing (phase 1). However,
the increase in infections forces the system to enter a new phase (phase 2),
where the level of activity begins to ﬂuctuate in a lower range. As restrictions
are imposed (phase 3), activity continues at low levels, while greater distancing
restrictions are imposed.
The example of ﬁgure 6 shows the dependency on the susceptibility parameter ρ. Even when we see µ falling (say, due to that the economy is adapting to
a mode of production with remote working) and τ is also decreasing, given the
adaptation of factor N ; the cyclical behavior of ρ force the system to a cycle
with lower output Y with high ﬂuctuations in social distancing d.
The dynamics presented in ﬁgure 6 is similar to the path presented by countries like Germany with a ﬁrst peak of a little more than 5000 in March-April
(2020) following a long valley (cases in the hundreds) reaching more than 25000
in November 2020 with a valley of near 7000 cases in February 2021 and a new
high of more than 20000 in April 2021. For Argentina the ﬁrst peak was near
15000 cases in October 2020 followed by a valley with values as low as 5000 and
intermediate peaks of near 12000 reaching near 25000 in April 2021 for contagion for the 7 days average (John Hopkins University CSSE Covid 19, 2020,
(accessed April 25, 2021)). Following waves of contagion, social distancing is
widely implemented.
Similar paths (tendencies) for GDP to the one presented in ﬁgure 6 are
reported in empirical evidence. Worldwide, GDP presents a huge fall in the ﬁrst
halve of 2020, while the recovery that followed was not enough to reestablish
13

previous levels. In the G20 area GDP rebounded 8.1% in the third quarter of
2020, while remaining 2.4% lower than pre-crisis levels of the last quarter of
2019 (OECD, 2020, (accessed April 21, 2021)).

Conclusions

In the model of gravitation created by Isaac Newton, the force of gravity requires
a signiﬁcant counterforce in order to escape its bounds, as, for example, to
launch a rocket from Earth to outer space. If that counterforce were reduced
beyond the threshold needed for escape velocity, the rocket would once again
come under the inﬂuence of gravity and fall back to Earth. If the counterforce
is somehow recovered, the rocket would raise again, generating trajectories with
cyclical patterns.
The COVID-19 pandemic and the manner in which it is spread has presented
economic agents with extremely unpleasant choices regarding their behavior –
in many cases, pushed along by government mandates - leading to direct effects in the real economy. In particular, the prophylactic of social distancing
may have been a useful mechanism by which to slow the spread of the disease, and, if it actually is eﬀective in limiting contagion, would yield long-term
beneﬁts in preserving the work force and hastening an end to the pandemic.
On the other hand, the restrictions of social distancing had more immediate
and likely medium-term eﬀects, namely the opportunity cost of lower economic
activity and output and possible follow-on eﬀects in lower investment for the
future. To come back to Newton and our space-bound rocket, the pandemic has
shown us that social distancing forces, used to reduce contagion, were counterbalanced by the resistance imposed by the organization of production and the
institutions created and sustained by human interaction. It is a “social gravitational force” which resists distancing and is necessary for production, and the
force/counterforce interplay creates diﬀerent trajectories depending upon which
force is favored.
This paper models these trade-oﬀs in the context of an economy, integrating various parameter conﬁgurations into a succession of phases associated with
social distancing. Our key result is that the trade-oﬀ of lower output in the
long run for defeating the disease via social distancing cannot be avoided: lower
contagion means lower output ceteris paribus. One may defy gravity for a short
time, but there are consequences. Indeed, this economic reality, that various
courses of actions are mutually exclusive trade-oﬀs, is the motivating factor
behind the key point of our model, namely that it does not have an explicit singular solution. Instead, the model is oﬀered as an attempt to illuminate some
of the variables and parameters which may be signiﬁcant in the context of the
optimization problem. However, this also highlights one of the limitations of
the model, as well as of public policy in response to a pandemic in general. As
the model depends on a speciﬁc set of parameters, g Gdp growth, µ economic
structure and policies, τ response of the labor force to distancing and ρ the susceptibility of the system to the need of more social distancing d, our simulations

14

show the complex nature of the casual relations between the variables. Even
in a sterile, disease-free, simulation setting, we may not be able to provide the
exact relations and responses, as, they are highly path dependent: much like
the meltwater under a glacier in Greenland (Poinar et al., 2015), which may
deposit quietly in a lake or gain force, melt more ice, and form a river to the
ocean, we do not know which force will predominate and determine the reaction
of the system.
Despite this limitation, we hope to have provided a simulation tool as a ﬁrst
attempt to model these relationships explicitly and understand the extent of the
trade-oﬀs in setting policy. Indeed, the limitations of the model also provide a
warning for policymakers, as the complexity of pandemic response means that
there are no simple solutions, but rather, diﬃcult trade-oﬀs. Moreover, our
ﬁndings suggest that the interaction of forces at play during the pandemic were
non-linear, introducing additional complexity. As a policymaker, veering from
policy to policy and inﬂuenced by the ecosystem of institutions surrounding policymaking, trade-oﬀs and non-linearities may not be readily apparent but must
be considered and, importantly, communicated. Pandemic response is not a
binary “health or the economy” choice, but instead a continuum where there are
opportunity costs in the short-, medium-, and long-term. To pretend otherwise
is folly and, most likely, counterproductive for building the trust necessary to
overcome such an exogenous shock.

Appendix: A non-consistent case

Economic consistency may help us to discard some cases. We may dismiss
the case with negative income grow and a positive inﬂuence of distancing over
the growth rate (think of an economy based on logistic distribution or strong
software capabilities)14 . We present several theoretical possible trajectories in
ﬁgure 7.
14 For

example, case saddle at Y=0.5 and d=0.25, with g = −0.04, µ = −0.15, τ = 0.5, ρ = 1.
