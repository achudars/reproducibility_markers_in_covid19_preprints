The impact of COVID-19 on students has been enormous, with an increase in worries about fiscal and physical health, a rapid shift to
online learning, and increased isolation. In addition to these changes, students with disabilities/health concerns may face accessibility
problems with online learning or communication tools, and their stress may be compounded by additional risks such as financial
stress or pre-existing conditions. To our knowledge, no one has looked specifically at the impact of COVID-19 on students with
disabilities/health concerns. In this paper, we present data from a survey of 147 students with and without disabilities collected in late
March to early April of 2020 to assess the impact of COVID-19 on these students’ education and mental health. Our findings show
that students with disabilities/health concerns were more concerned about classes going online than their peers without disabilities.
In addition, students with disabilities/health concerns also reported that they have experienced more COVID-19 related adversities
compared to their peers without disabilities/health concerns. We argue that students with disabilities/health concerns in higher
education need confidence in the accessibility of the online learning tools that are becoming increasingly prevalent in higher education
not only because of COVID-19 but also more generally. In addition, educational technologies will be more accessible if they consider
the learning context, and are designed to provide a supportive, calm, and connecting learning environment.

INTRODUCTION

The impact of COVID-19 on students in general can potentially be large. Worries about fiscal and physical health, rapid
change, and increased isolation are all factors that can affect students and general. Students with disabilities/health
concerns may face greater risks than their non-disabled peers in a wide range of aspects. First, they have higher financial
risk due to the need for accessible housing and personal assistance. Moreover, they face greater health risks, depending
on their specific situation. In addition, the risk to their education is also higher due to potentially inaccessible course
content and classroom environments [21, 31]. These risks may increase further in the face of a global health pandemic.
An understanding of the impact of COVID-19 on students with disabilities/health concerns is important so that we can
identify these increased risks early and respond to them.

Zhang, et al.

In this paper, we define disability broadly to include anyone who self-identifies as disabled and also those with health
concerns who may not identify as disabled [15]. We focus on two specific issues of concern to all students: Education
and Mental health. Both are currently under stress, and understanding how and whether those stresses differentially
impact students with disabilities/health concerns is critically important. By comparing data about students’ experiences
during COVID-19 we hope to identify areas of concern.
To this end, we present descriptive data showing how students with disabilities/health concerns, in comparison to
their non-disabled peers, are faring in the COVID-19 context. We present an analysis of data from a multi-year study at
a large public university that has included approximately 200 students per year, including students with and without
disabilities/health concerns [36]. In this paper, we focus specifically on the impact from survey results from Spring 2020
(during the COVID-19 pandemic), in which we ask 147 students about their physical and mental health, their academic
and social experiences, and specific concerns about COVID-19. Our sample includes 28 students with disabilities/health
concerns in 2020. Where relevant, we also make comparisons to data collected from a subset of 91 students, of whom 13
have disabilities/health concerns who filled out a very similar survey in Spring 2019 (before COVID-19).
We contribute insights about university students’ early responses just before and during COVID-19, to characterize
patterns of concern, challenging experiences, and stress as well as initial indicators of mental health. Our central focus
is on students with disabilities/health concerns, and the impact of COVID-19 on their education and health.
Educational Impacts. The shift to online learning may impact the types of access technologies and techniques that
students use, as well as their dependence on online course materials that may not be accessible [21, 31]. Particularly, as
many universities made a late decision to teach online, instructors had less time than usual to prepare materials for
an online setting, which may have impacted the accessibility of those materials. At the same time, for some students
the ability to participate online may increase accessibility. We contribute an analysis of educational concerns and how
they differ from before to during COVID-19. We compare students with and without disabilities/health concerns, and we
analyze differences between different classes of disabilities/health concerns.
Our findings suggest that students with disabilities/health concerns have increased concerns about classes going online
over those without, particularly the impact on their degree goals such as admission to major and graduation timing.
Impact on Mental Health. When social systems are placed under stress due to sudden forces such as a global health
pandemic, the impact on marginalized populations can be especially severe. Outbreaks of widespread infectious diseases,
such as SARS and COVID-19, are associated with psychological distress and eroded mental health, stimulating calls for
mental health care to be part of the national public health emergency system [4]. Our examination of mental health
impacts starts with exposure to stressors. We look at several potential sources of stress, including the use of social
media, income loss, quarantine and isolation, loneliness, chronic discrimination, and overall exposure to adversity.
At the time our data was collected, just after classes went online and three weeks after it was discovered that
community spread of COVID-19 was present in Seattle (Table 1), we did not find evidence of changes in anxiety, stress, or
depression among students with or without disabilities/health concerns. However, students with disabilities/health concerns
reported more stress exposure, and more distress, than those without.
Implications for Accessible Online Education. Although our sample is small and the timing early in the COVID-19
crisis, this data provides an important snapshot into the consequential nature of students’ concerns about online
education, which includes the impact not only on grade, but also on admission to major and graduation.

Impact of COVID-19 on Undergraduates with Disabilities/Health Concerns

The COVID-19 epidemic’s impact on learning should be a wake-up call to accessibility researchers to study online
learning technologies and their impacts, and higher education in general, from a disability perspective. Although social
distancing may fade into memory, it is likely that online learning will not. Even before COVID-19, online education
was beginning to achieve parity with in-person education [27].
Yet this is a topic that has received little attention from computer scientists or accessibility researchers. A title word
search for “education OR course OR teaching” within the ASSETS proceedings found only 29 matches, of which most
discuss introducing curricula that would educate technologists about accessibility (e.g., [20]). While some deal with
online educational tools in general (e.g., [8] [12]), or childrens’ access to the mainstream education system [9], there is
much less work published about higher education. Although this is a limited search, it highlights the relative lack of
attention to online learning, and higher education in general, in the accessibility community (in contrast, the keyword
"blind" found 139 matches).
Our work provides motivation for the importance of improving the accessibility of online classes (and relatedly the
ease with which instructors can make such classes accessible). In addition, as Ringland et al. argue [33], accessibility
solutions must take a holistic, contextualized view of the person, including consideration of their potential stresses
and concerns. Thus, we argue that under COVID-19 (and, really, in general) an accessible education is also one that
contributes to student well-being and resilience. Our data help to justify this need by demonstrating that, at least in our
sample, students with disabilities are operating under increased stress loads both over their lifetime and specifically
since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.

RELATED WORK

Life as an undergraduate student presents an exciting and challenging opportunity to learn, innovate, and grow.
However, exposure to stress is also common among college students [18]. In addition, some stressors differentially impact
vulnerable groups, and these impacts can translate into changes in mental health and behavior (e.g., [36]), particularly
when they interact with risk [35]. Increasing participation by people with disabilities requires understanding and efforts
to lessen the particular stresses and risks they face. The COVID-19 pandemic is one obvious stressor that may directly
impact students in a multitude of ways. Some may be at greater risk of contracting the illness and interrupted access to
health services [3]. Pandemics can also impact availability of personal assistance, reduce educational accessibility [21],
and create higher risks of exposure than for the overall population [5]. Below we explore expected consequences for
learning and mental health of these stressors for people with disabilities.
2.1

The Impact of COVID-19 on Education

One significant impact of COVID-19 has been the shift to online learning. Online learning has become increasingly
common over the last decade [31], and even before the radical changes imposed by social distancing in the era of
COVID-19, issues existed with the accessibility of online courses. For example, at one university, 75% of faculty reported
having never made accommodations in their online material [31], most having never been asked by students to do so.
Student reluctance to ask for accommodation is driven in part by concerns about faculty bias [21].
Due in part to the lack of perceived need among professors, the perspective of students with disabilities indicates that
online learning is not fully accessible [21]. In addition, the move to increased asynchronous learning can leave students
with disabilities behind, as, for example, videos are often not captioned. As of 2015, only Blackboard (of all online
learning management systems) had been awarded Gold certification for its accessibility by the National Federation
for the Blind [21]. In addition, content generators (i.e. faculty) have a big impact on the accessibility of their content
3

arXiv, Online,

Zhang, et al.

[21, 22] and over half (65%) of faculty are unsure or do not know how to make accommodations [31]. This results in
many courses being designed and deployed without accessibility support [21]. When faculty additionally have to make
very rapid changes to their courses due to pressure to go online quickly, it is even less likely that they will make time to
attend to an issue they are unsure of, like accessibility.
At the same time, a shift to online learning due to a pandemic could benefit students with disabilities. For example,
going online might reduce the need for disclosure, increase flexibility if instructors are being especially accommodating
under the circumstances, or reduce barriers for students with mobility-related impairments.

2.2

The Impact of COVID-19 on Mental Health

Even before the pandemic, universities were seeing high and growing levels of mental health struggles among students
[17]. Further, natural disasters as well as past epidemics such as SARS, have been associated with psychological distress,
depression and substance abuse [13, 16, 23, 28, 41]. Adverse psychological effects of the current pandemic may also
be serious, but are not expected to be uniform [30]. For example, many individuals show resilience in disasters; this
resilience manifested in a recent study of college students who, contrary to expectations, reported less loneliness in
April than in February of this year [10]. Daily surveys by Kanter et al. of the general population from March 14th
through May 5th 2020 (during the COVID-19 epidemic) have not shown overall increases in anxiety, depression or
loneliness (https://uwcovid19.shinyapps.io/dashboard/). On the other hand, students with a history of stress exposure
may have raised allostatic load [25], lowering the physiological resilience to the additional demands brought on by the
pandemic.
It is unclear whether students with disabilities/health concerns are likely to experience mental health consequences of
COVID-19’s impact on society. What is expected is that people with disabilities/health concerns are likely to experience
more stressors associated with the pandemic. In addition to the risks of COVID-19, and educational accessibility,
emergency response plans do not always include planning for people with disabilities [5], social distancing may be
harder for people with disabilities who rely on caregivers, and people with disabilities may have to deal with inaccessible
communications [5]. These risks may put people with disabilities at greater risk of experiencing distress associated
with the pandemic. Their concerns about personal safety may be stronger than those of people without disabilities and
they may be more vulnerable to stressors during the pandemic (such as disruption of critical health care). For these
reasons they may be at greater risk of psychological distress.

2.3

Summary and Research Questions

Given the literature thus far, there is cause for concern. The COVID-19 context appears to be exacerbating risks related
to mental health, educational outcomes, and physical health, particularly for students with disabilities. Thus, this
paper addresses time-sensitive questions regarding the adversity profiles and well-being of university students during
the current pandemic, with particular focus on ways that students with disability needs may differ from nondisabled
students. Drawing from research related to cumulative disadvantage and marginality [29], we anticipate that students
with disabilities will express justifiably greater vulnerability in the COVID-19 context through elevated levels of concern
about their educational environment and likelihood of success, as well as features of their family and personal lives
affected by the pandemic. Finally, we anticipate that students with disabilities may be experiencing greater levels of
psychological distress in the form of mental health indicators.

METHODS

Our data are derived from a multi-year study, the University of Washington Experience (UWEXP) [36], which is in
its third year of collecting data about college students’ behaviors, mental health, education and well-being. This, in
turn, was inspired by a study first pioneered by Wang et al. [42]. The goals of the UWEXP study are to understand
the stressors impacting undergraduate college students through a combination of self-reported information about
demographics, health and well-being, institutional data about educational outcomes, and behavioral data collected
using FitBits and mobile phones. In 2020, we recruited from all past participants in the UWEXP study and additionally
advertised to the entire University of Washington entering first-year student class. In addition, we conducted targeted
recruitment in communities that might be marginalized including students with disabilities, and first-generation college
students. Students are paid to participate in the study, which is IRB approved.
In this paper, we primarily make use of the UWEXP survey data collected in Spring of 2020, within the COVID-19
context. Students were instructed to complete the survey after their last Winter Quarter final. At that time, the University
of Washington had been teaching online for at least two weeks, and students knew that half or more of Spring quarter
would be online. The UWEXP baseline survey data was conducted from March 18th through April 8th (end of Winter
quarter through beginning of Spring quarter). The majority (80%) of students completed it between March 18th and
March 29th. At the time, social distancing restrictions were increasing city and state-wide, with the initial stay-at-home
order for Washington issued March 23rd. The full timeline is shown in Table 1.
Students answered an hour-long questionnaire consisting of demographics and a series of well-established scales
to measure depression (CES-D [32]); perceived stress (PSS [7]); anxiety (STAI [39]); loneliness (UCLA [34]); chronic
discrimination and harassment (CEDH [26]); Perceived Social Status (SES, measured using the MacArthur Scale of
Subjective Social Status [1]) and major life events (MLE [36]). Several of these scales ask students to reflect over a
period of time: The depression scale items measure the past week; whereas perceived stress and trauma symptomology
assessed the past month. Students reported Major Life Events (adverse, traumatic or stressful events) over their lifetime.
They reported their depression-related feelings that occurred during last week. We measured trait anxiety and loneliness
does not provide a timescale, it is thus likely that answers to the loneliness scale reflect current (in-the-moment) status.
In addition, since one arm of the UWEXP study was concerned with adversity exposure and related symptoms, the
data collection protocol includes a scale designed to measure post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomology [43].
We note that in a population without known exposure to severe trauma (such as most of our participants), the items in
this scale are better conceptualized as a measure of distress rather than indicative of clinical post-traumatic stress.

When no established measures were available, we created questions to address variables of interest such as adverse
events due to COVID-19. This included questions about students’ levels of concern about current life issues–both
educational and family related; questions about COVID-19 specific adversity exposures; and a single item asking if
they have a pre-existing condition that makes them vulnerable to COVID-19. In addition, the UWEXP study includes a
student-specific measure of COVID-19 related adversities.

3.1

Data Preparation and Analysis

152 students participated in the 2020 survey, of whom 147 stayed in the study (96.7% retention rate). We removed
the data for the five students who dropped out from our data analysis. We assign disability status primarily based on
self-identification. Additionally, we added people who gave very high responses (moderate or severe) on at least eight
of the 33 items of the Cohen-Hoberman Inventory of Physical Symptoms (CHIPS) scale [2], which included energy
impairment suggestive of a chronic health condition. Our choice to include disabling health conditions is consistent with
classification systems and service provision contexts [24, 38]. This also helps address under-identification of disabling
statuses; for example, about 25% of people with energy-impairing chronic conditions do not identify as disabled [15],
but often still encounter similar barriers as people who do identify as disabled.
Analysis was guided by the research questions, largely focused on full sample portrayals of variable distributions as
well as between-group tests of difference. We run both t-tests (parametric) and Mann-Whitney U tests (non-parametric)
for significance testing; we had the same significance levels for all the pairwise comparisons, thus, we chose to report
the results of t-tests for consistency. Most results meet 𝑝 < .01 or better, and the number of repeat comparisons is small,
so we did not correct for multiple comparison.

3.2

2020 Survey Participants

The 2020 study included 147 students (Table 2). There are 119 students without disabilities; of these, 48.7% (58) are female,
49.6% (59) are male and 1.7% (2) identified themselves outside of the male or female gender, 53.8% (64) are Asian, 11.8%
(14) are underrepresented minorities (URMs: African or African-American, Alaska Native, Native American, Native
Hawaiian Pacific Islander, or Latinx), 31.9% (38) are first-generation college students, and 15.1% (18) are LGBTQIA+.
Only a few reported a pre-existing condition that made them vulnerable to COVID-19 (5 (4.2%)) and the average SES
score is 5.9.
There are 28 students with disabilities/health concerns. Note that students could indicate multiple types of disability
and that one student with a high CHIPS score also identified as disabled, which is why there are 24 disabled students
and 5 students with high CHIPS scores. Students with disabilities/health concerns had higher marginalized status or
vulnerabilities than students without in the study: 82.1% (23) are female, and 17.9% (5) male, 67.9% (19) are Asian, 39.3%
(11) are first-generation college students, 21.4% (3) are LGBTQIA+ and the average SES is 5.5.

3.3

Repeat Participants

Although the majority of our analysis only looks at the 2020 survey participants, we also look at times at data collected
in 2019. Of the 2020 students, 91 students returned from 2019 including 13 with disabilities/health concerns. These
students filled out the same survey in 2019 and 2020, at the same time of year, with the exception of COVID-19 specific
questions, which were added in 2020.

RESULTS

In this section, we first present students’ levels of concern regarding the potential negative effects of the COVID-19
context on their educational standing and success. We then summarize and contrast students’ adversity exposures,
both those directly COVID-related as well as from sources such as discrimination, loneliness, and stress profiles via
histories of major life adverse events. Finally, we compare students with disabilities/health concerns to those without
disabilities/health concerns regarding their current mental health statuses.
4.1

Educational Concerns

As noted in Table 1, the University of Washington courses went online approximately two weeks before the end of
Winter Quarter (early March), and students filled out the survey after taking their last final. Part of that assessment
was students’ concerns about the potential impact of COVID-19 on their academic well-being. Figure 1 shows the
percentages of students with and without disabilities/health concerns across eight indicators. At the time, things were
in flux, but students knew that Spring quarter would be at least partly online. As is evident, concerns ranged high on
many of these factors. More than 50% of students with disabilities/health concerns were very concerned about grades in
both Winter and Spring quarters, as well as whether they would have to move degree requirements, negative impact on
courses that could not then go online, admission to preferred major being threatened, and, to a lesser degree, negative
impact on graduation and financial aid. Students with disabilities/health concerns were substantially more concerned
(𝑀 = 13.44, 𝑆𝐷 = 6.17) than their non-disabled peers (𝑀 = 8.25, 𝑆𝐷 = 6.28), with means calculated as a sum across all
items. This difference is significant (𝑡 (145) = 3.94, 𝑝 < .001).
Given the wide range of disability identities represented in our sample, it is possible that not all students with
disabilities/health concerns share the same levels of concern. For example, students with high fatigue may well

prefer to stay home, whereas a student with hearing impairment may need to rapidly change how they access audio
material through a transcription or sign language translation service. We anticipated that students with vision or
hearing impairments might face greater barriers going online than those with mental health conditions or other
disabilities/health concerns. However, of the 27 students who answered this question, we found that there was no
significant difference (𝑡 (26) = −0.23, 𝑝 = .82) for online classes concerns between the 13 students with vision or hearing
impairments (𝑀 = 21.2, 𝑆𝐷 = 5.37) and the 14 students with other disabilities/health concerns (𝑀 = 21.7, 𝑆𝐷 = 6.94).
4.2

Adversity and Mental Health Trends

Toward assessing student vulnerabilities within the early COVID-19 context, we turn next to identifying areas of
adversity exposure relevant to psychosocial functioning as well as mental health statuses as reflected through clinical
measures.
4.2.1 Adversity Sources. We begin by investigating COVID-19 related stressors that students were experiencing outside
of their educational settings and differences for those with disabilities/health concerns.
As can be seen in Figure 2, students with disabilities/health concerns experienced more stress than those without
due to a range of financial, family and isolation issues. Experiencing tensions within the household during this period
of isolation reflected the greatest disparity between students with disabilities/health concerns and their non-disabled
peers. We also asked about whether social media use was a source of stress. This was high for all participants (over half
agreed or strongly agreed); however the difference between students with and without disabilities/health concerns was
not significant.
Table 3 reports group comparisons on four forms of adversity that could have implications for stress and functioning.
In this data, the CEDH instrument measures chronic discrimination and harassment over the past twelve months,
Major Life Events is capturing stressors over the lifetime, and COVID Related Adversities provides a sum of the

stressors attributed specifically to COVID-19 (i.e. recent stressors) shown in Figure 2. Here we see that students with
disabilities/health concerns report higher levels of chronic discrimination (e.g., experiencing demeaning remarks or
forms of unfair treatment) and higher exposure to major life adversities (e.g., a serious interpersonal conflict, early life
or recent maltreatment). Students with disabilities/health concerns also report more COVID-related concerns. Notably,
both student groups reported comparable level concerns about isolation, and comparable loneliness.
4.2.2 Current Mental Health Status. Given the greater levels of adversity exposures and variety that students with
disabilities/health concerns face, we anticipated that students with disabilities/health concerns would experience
increased mental health problems. However, both groups of students experienced comparable levels of current perceived
stress, depression, and anxiety at the time they filled out the survey, as shown in Table 4.
It is notable that, in comparison to the other mental health measures, students with disabilities/health concerns did
have significantly higher scores on the PTSD (distress) scale [43]. We delve more deeply into this result in the next
subsection.

4.2.3 Distress in students with disabilities. To further explore these results, we undertook a more nuanced examination
of student responses. Figure 3 shows the items which had the highest level of endorsement from students with
disabilities/health concerns. These items are consistent with domains of PTSD reflective of general psychological
distress (specifically, domains D and E [11]). That is, the items that were most frequently rated as highly concerning by
students with disabilities/health concerns appear to be reflecting symptoms of hyperarousal and agitation–such as
difficulty concentrating, trouble sleeping, and having negative feelings. Students were also comparatively cut off from
others in this time of isolation, and indicated that as troubling.
4.2.4 Returning Students. One possible explanation for the PTSD group difference described above is that our sampling
process in 2020 purposefully included more people with disabilities/health concerns and other vulnerabilities. To address
this, we looked at the 2019 and 2020 data just for students who had participated in both the 2019 and 2020 studies (a
total of 91 students, of whom 13 have disabilities/health concerns).
We first examined whether our 2020 results changed when we only looked at the 53 students who participated in
both 2019 and 2020. Our findings confirm the significant increase in distress, with similar effect size (M=29.31 vs M=13.0
for D/H vs non D/H) and significance (p<.01). This difference existed in 2019 as well, but the effect size (M=17.5 vs
M=8.18) and significance (p<.05) were both lower.

Fig. 4. Changes in PTSD scores of 12 returning students with disabilities/health concerns from last year to this year (12 of the 13
returning had responses for PTSD scale). Each dot represents a returning student, the y axis of each dot is the subtraction of PTSD
scores from last year to this year. For example, if a student’s PTSD scores were 16 and 5 in this year and last year, respectively, the
value on the y-axis would be 11.

Not surprisingly (since it is a lifetime measure), the 13 returning students with disabilities/health concerns reported
similar exposure to Major Life Events in both 2019 (𝑀 = 11.15, 𝑆𝐷 = 5.18) and 2020 (𝑀 = 10.54, 𝑆𝐷 = 5.29),
𝑡 (25) = 0.30, 𝑝 = .77. We also examined the change in PTSD scores from 2019 to 2020 for the 13 students with
disabilities/health concerns. As Figure 4 shows, 10 of the 12 students who answered the PTSD scale reported higher
levels of PTSD symptomology in 2020 than in 2019, the majority being 10 or more points higher in 2020, which bears
clinical relevance. The difference in scores is also significant (2019 (𝑀 = 17.5, 𝑆𝐷 = 13.57), 2020 (𝑀 = 29.31, 𝑆𝐷 = 16.13),
𝑡 (23) = 44.0, 𝑝 < .05.
In comparison, for students without disabilities/health concerns, the change in score is smaller (only 19 out of 78
have an increase 10 points or more) and the difference in scores is significant in 2019 (𝑀 = 8.18, 𝑆𝐷 = 9.6) and 2020
(𝑀 = 13.0, 𝑆𝐷 = 12.01), 𝑡 (−2.73) =, 𝑝 < .01. Note that while the significance is higher here, the means for students
without disabilities/health concerns are lower than for students with disabilities/health concerns in both 2019 and 2020.

DISCUSSION

This study provides an early snapshot of the concerns and vulnerabilities of undergraduate students with disabilities/health concerns within the early-stage context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Such students expressed considerable
concern about the educational and financial impacts of COVID-19. At this early stage of COVID-19, we did not see higher
levels of self-reported depression, anxiety, stress or loneliness. However, students with disabilities/health concerns did
report overall high levels of stress exposure and exposure to COVID-19 related adversities, and we saw evidence of
associated distress.
5.1

Students with Disability/Health Concerns report more Stress Exposure and Higher Distress

By comparing students with and without disabilities/health concerns, we gain insights about the unique vulnerabilities
of students with disabilities/health concerns in the COVID-19 context. They brought significantly deeper histories of
both discrimination as well as serious major life adversity exposures than non-disabled students to this context. In
addition, our results show that students with disabilities/health concerns are already experiencing COVID-19 related
stress. Students reported higher or equal exposure to all of the COVID-19 specific stressors we measured than their
11

peers without disabilities/health concerns. We also found early signs of distress, particularly difficulty concentrating,
insomnia, and isolation, all understandable reactions to conditions of unpredictability and lack of control [44].
The timing of the surveys (early in the COVID-19 crisis) leaves open the possibility that the effects we see are due
to different stress exposures between students with and without disabilities/health concerns and not specifically to
COVID-19. However, our comparison of the students who provided survey data in both 2019 and 2020 suggests that
exposure to discrimination and distress both increased this year and that our data reflect increased vulnerability of
students with disabilities/health concerns in the COVID-19 context.
Prior evidence has established that students entering higher education with adversity backgrounds are at elevated
risk of worsening mental health [19]. Subsequent stress exposure adds to and, in some cases, may exacerbate the effects
of earlier adversities [14]. On the other hand, measures of stress, anxiety, depression, and loneliness all show no change
(See Tables 3 and 4). This could also indicate resilience in the face of these stresses, many of which are areas where
people with disabilities may have prior experience [6].

5.2

Students with Disability/Health Concerns need Better Online Education supports

Students with disabilities/health concerns in our study report worries about courses going online, and serious consequences of the move online including receiving worse grades, not being able to meet academic requirements online, and
having admission to their chosen major impaired. In addition, our study shows that students are not only concerned
about online courses, but also exposed to a variety of stressors from discrimination to financial concerns.
This suggests that more accessible online education tools should be designed to consider a wider range of concerns,
which can potentially exacerbate the impact of barriers to access. Prior work has argued for the importance of considering
context in the design of accessible technologies [33]. Rather than simply making online course materials more accessible,
online instructors may need to support students who are coping with multiple stressors outside of class. For example,
this might include designing for asynchronous participation, or redundant assessment that is robust to occasional
absences. Further, in the context of a pandemic, best practices are to convey safety, calm, comfort and connectedness
[40]. If educators and educational technology can strive to provide a calming, connecting experience, they can support
students rather than compounding their stress.

5.3

Limitations

Our choice to combine people who identify as disabled with people who report themselves as having significant health
concerns is driven by the relatively high numbers of people with health concerns who do not identify as disabled
[15], even though they may experience accessibility barriers. Moreover, this group comprised fewer than 20% of the
students with disabilities/health concerns and in an analysis comparing subgroups of students with disabilities/health
concerns, we did not see major differences in our results. There are philosophical questions raised by this choice about
who “counts” as disabled. Our view was that, relative to our study’s goals, this level of health concern rendered these
students comparably vulnerable in the COVID-19 context. That said, we recognize that other sources may use differing
definitions.
Finally, we note that we have a relatively small and non-representative sample (for either Seattle or nationally with
respect to undergraduates). This sample reflects our efforts to reach more vulnerable students and thus our results may
be most relevant to students with such vulnerabilities.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

This article is a first look at the impact of COVID-19 on students with disabilities, and as such, it illuminates a range of
needs not yet well documented. It also helps generate questions for further inquiry.
Understanding how COVID-19 affects students with disabilities/health concerns can help us to identify patterns of
concerns, stress and indicators of mental health, and provide further steps to take or consider in order to respond to
an unexpected global health pandemic. Our findings show that students with disabilities/health concerns were more
worried about the outcomes of the unanticipated change to online learning than their peers. In addition, during our
study, students with disabilities/health concerns experienced more COVID-19 related adversities and distress.
As pandemics (as well as other major stress conditions) continue over time, additional stressors begin to arise (e.g.,
loss of income, lack of healthcare access, caring for others [30, 37]). This could in turn translate to larger impacts on
the wellbeing of students with disabilities/health concerns. In the future, we hope to compare students’ response to
COVID-19 further into the epidemic to the data described in this paper. Further, we plan to conduct interviews to
develop a more nuanced, qualitative picture of these impacts.
To conclude, we argue that just as students with disabilities belong in higher education, accessibility research
belongs in higher education. It is time for the accessibility community to expand our work studying technology use
and developing technology to support students with disabilities in higher education. We hope that these insights into
the student experience demonstrate how important it is to learn how higher education fails and succeeds to support
students with disabilities, and where technology can play a role in improving this.
