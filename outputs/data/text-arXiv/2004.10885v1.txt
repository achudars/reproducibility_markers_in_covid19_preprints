Abstract
We propose a compartmental mathematical model for the spread of the COVID-19 disease with
special focus on the transmissibility of super-spreaders individuals. We compute the basic reproduction number threshold, we study the local stability of the disease free equilibrium in terms of
the basic reproduction number, and we investigate the sensitivity of the model with respect to the
variation of each one of its parameters. Numerical simulations show the suitability of the proposed
COVID-19 model for the outbreak that occurred in Wuhan, China.
Key words: mathematical modeling of COVID-19 pandemic, Wuhan case study, basic
reproduction number, stability, sensitivity analysis, numerical simulations.

1. Introduction
Mathematical models of infectious disease transmission dynamics are now ubiquitous. Such
models play an important role in helping to quantify possible infectious disease control and mitigation strategies [1, 2, 3]. There exist a number of models for infectious diseases; as for compartmental
models, starting from the very classical SIR model to more complex proposals [4].
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease was first identified December 2019
in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei, China, and has since spread globally, resulting in the ongoing
2020 pandemic outbreak [5]. The COVID-19 pandemic is considered as the biggest global threat
worldwide because of thousands of confirmed infections, accompanied by thousands deaths over
the world. Notice, by March 26, 2020, report 503,274 confirmed cumulative cases with 22,342
deaths. At the time of this revision, the numbers have increased to 1,353,361 confirmed cumulative cases with 79,235 deaths, according to the report dated by April 8, 2020, by the Word Health
Organization.
The global problem of the outbreak has attracted the interest of researchers of different areas,
giving rise to a number of proposals to analyze and predict the evolution of the pandemic [6, 7]. Our
main contribution is related with considering the class of super-spreaders, which is now appearing
in medical journals (see, e.g., [8, 9]). This new class, as added to any compartmental model,
implies a number of analysis about disease free equilibrium points, which is also considered in this
work.
The manuscript is organized as follows. In Section 2, we propose a new model for COVID-19.
A qualitative analysis of the model is investigated in Section 3: in Section 3.1, we compute the

basic reproduction number R0 of the COVID-19 system model; in Section 3.2, we study the local
stability of the disease free equilibrium in terms of R0 . The sensitivity of the basic reproduction
number R0 with respect to the parameters of the system model is given in Section 4. The usefulness
of our model is then illustrated in Section 5 of numerical simulations, where we use real data from
Wuhan. We end with Section 6 of conclusions, discussion, and future research.
2. The Proposed COVID-19 Compartment Model
Based on a 2016 model [10], and taking into account the existence of super-spreaders in the
family of corona virus [11], we propose a new epidemiological compartment model that takes into
account the super-spreading phenomenon of some individuals. Moreover, we consider a fatality
compartment, related to death due to the virus infection. In doing so, the constant total population
size N is subdivided into eight epidemiological classes: susceptible class (S), exposed class (E),
symptomatic and infectious class (I), super-spreaders class (P ), infectious but asymptomatic class
(A), hospitalized (H), recovery class (R), and fatality class (F ). The model takes the following

β quantifies a high transmission coefficient due to super-spreaders, and l quantifies the relative
transmissibility of hospitalized patients. Here κ is the rate at which an individual leaves the exposed class by becoming infectious (symptomatic, super-spreaders or asymptomatic); ρ1 is the
proportion of progression from exposed class E to symptomatic infectious class I; ρ2 is a relative
very low rate at which exposed individuals become super-spreaders while 1 − ρ1 − ρ2 is the progression from exposed to asymptomatic class; γa is the average rate at which symptomatic and
super-spreaders individuals become hospitalized; γi is the recovery rate without being hospitalized;
γr is the recovery rate of hospitalized patients; and δi , δp , and δh are the disease induced death
rates due to infected, super-spreaders, and hospitalized individuals, respectively. At each instant

has been modeled in this way since it was not apparent their behavior. Indeed, at present, this
question is a controversial issue for epidemiologists. A flowchart of model (1) is presented in

3. Qualitative Analysis of the Model
One of the most significant thresholds when studying infectious disease models, which quantifies
disease invasion or extinction in a population, is the basic reproduction number [12]. In this section
we obtain the basic reproduction number for our model (1) and study the locally asymptotically
stability of its disease free equilibrium (see Theorem 1).
3.1. The Basic Reproduction Number
The basic reproduction number, as a measure for disease spread in a population, plays an
important role in the course and control of an ongoing outbreak. It can be understood as the
average number of cases one infected individual generates, over the course of its infectious period,
in an otherwise uninfected population. Using the next generation matrix approach outlined in
[13] to our model (1), the basic reproduction number can be computed by considering the below
generation matrices F and V , that is, the Jacobian matrices associated to the rate of appearance
of new infections and the net rate out of the corresponding compartments, respectively,

The basic reproduction number R0 is obtained as the spectral radius of F · V −1 , precisely,

(4)

For the parameters used in our simulations (see Table 1), one computes this basic reproduction
number to obtain R0 = 0.945. This means that the epidemic outbreak that has occurred in Wuhan
was well controlled by the Chinese authorities.

3.2. Local Stability in Terms of the Basic Reproduction Number
Noting that the two last equations and the fifth of system (1) are uncoupled to the remaining
equations of the system, we can easily obtain, by direct integration, the following analytical results:

A(t) = κ(1 − ρ1 − ρ2 ) 0 E(s)ds


F (t) = δi 0 I(s)ds + δp 0 P (s)ds + δh 0 H(s)ds.
Furthermore, since the total population size N is constant, one has

S(t) = N − [E(t) + I(t) + P (t) + A(t) + H(t) + R(t) + F (t)] .

(6)

Therefore, the local stability of model (1) can be studied through the remaining coupled system
of states variables, namely, the variables E, I, P , and H in (1). The Jacobian matrix associated
to these variables of (1) is the following one:

where ̟i , ̟p , and ̟h are defined in (3). The eigenvalues of the matrix JM are the roots of the
following characteristic polynomial:
Z(λ) = λ4 + a1 λ3 + a2 λ2 + a1 λ + a4 ,
where
a1 = κ + ̟ h + ̟ i + ̟ p ,

a2 = −βκρ1 − β κρ2 + κ̟h + κ̟i + ̟h ̟i + κ̟p + ̟h ̟p + ̟i ̟p ,

′

a4 = −βγa κlρ2 ̟i − βγa κlρ1 ̟p − β κρ2 ̟i ̟h − βκρ1 ̟h ̟p + κ̟h ̟i ̟p .
Next, by using the Liénard–Chipard test [14, 15], all the roots of Z(λ) are negative or have negative
real part if, and only if, the following conditions are satisfied:
1. ai > 0, i = 1, 2, 3, 4;
2. a1 a2 > a3 .
In order to check these conditions of the Liénard–Chipard test, we rewrite the coefficients a1 , a2 ,
a3 , and a4 of the characteristic polynomial in terms of the basic reproduction number given by
(4):

Moreover, we also compute, in terms of R0 , the following expression:

From these previous expressions, it is clear that if R0 < 1, then the conditions of the Liénard–
Chipard test are satisfied and, as a consequence, the disease free equilibrium is stable. In the case
when R0 > 1, we have that a4 < 0 and, by using Descartes’ rule of signs, we conclude that at least
one of the eigenvalues is positive. Therefore, the system is unstable. In conclusion, we have just
proved the following result:
Theorem 1. The disease free equilibrium of system (1), that is, (N, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), is locally
asymptotically stable if R0 < 1 and unstable if R0 > 1.
Next we investigate the sensitiveness of the COVID-19 model (1), with respect to the variation
of each one of its parameters, for the endemic threshold (4).
4. Sensitivity Analysis
As we saw in Section 3, the basic reproduction number for the COVID-19 model (1), which
we propose in Section 2, is given by (4). The sensitivity analysis for the endemic threshold (4)
tells us how important each parameter is to disease transmission. This information is crucial
not only for experimental design, but also to data assimilation and reduction of complex models
[16]. Sensitivity analysis is commonly used to determine the robustness of model predictions to
parameter values, since there are usually errors in collected data and presumed parameter values.
It is used to discover parameters that have a high impact on the threshold R0 and should be
targeted by intervention strategies. More accurately, sensitivity indices’ allows us to measure the
relative change in a variable when a parameter changes. For that purpose, we use the normalized
forward sensitivity index of a variable with respect to a given parameter, which is defined as the
ratio of the relative change in the variable to the relative change in the parameter. If such variable
is differentiable with respect to the parameter, then the sensitivity index is defined as follows.
Definition 1.1 (See [17, 18]). The normalized forward sensitivity index of R0 , which is differentiable with respect to a given parameter θ, is defined by
0
ΥR
θ =

∂R0 θ
.
∂θ R0

The values of the sensitivity indices for the parameters values of Table 1, are presented in
Table 2.
These values have been determined experimentally in such a way the mathematical model
describes well the real data, giving rise to Figures 2 and 3. Other values for the parameters can
be found, e.g., in [19].

Note that the sensitivity index may depend on several parameters of the system, but also
0
can be constant, independent of any parameter. For example, ΥR
θ = +1 means that increasing
(decreasing) θ by a given percentage increases (decreases) always R0 by that same percentage.
The estimation of a sensitive parameter should be carefully done, since a small perturbation in
such parameter leads to relevant quantitative changes. On the other hand, the estimation of a
parameter with a rather small value for the sensitivity index does not require as much attention
to estimate, because a small perturbation in that parameter leads to small changes.
From Table 2, we conclude that the most sensitive parameters to the basic reproduction number
R0 of the COVID-19 model (1) are β, ρ1 and δi . In concrete, an increase of the value of β will
increase the basic reproduction number by 96.3% and this happens, in a similar way, for the
parameter ρ1 . In contrast, an increase of the value of δi will decrease R0 by 69.9%.
5. Numerical Simulations: The Case Study of Wuhan
We perform numerical simulations to compare the results of our model with the real data
obtained from several reports published by WHO [20, 21] and worldometer [5].
The starting point of our simulations is 4 January 2020 (day 0), when the Chinese authorities
informed about the new virus [20], with already 6 confirmed cases in one day. From this period
6

up to January 19, there is less information about the number of people contracting the disease.
Only on January 20, we have the report [21], with 1460 new reported cases in that day and 26 the
dead. Thus, the infection gained much more attention from 21 January 2020, with 1739 confirmed
cases and 38 the dead, up to 4 March 2020, when the numbers in that day were as low as 11 and
7, respectively infected and dead, after a pick of 3892 confirmed cases on 27 January 2020 and a
pick of 254 dead on 4 February 2020. Here we follow the data of the daily reports published by [5].
We show that our COVID-19 model describes well the real data of daily confirmed cases during
the 2 months outbreak (66 days to be precise, from January 4 to March 9, 2020).
The total population of Wuhan is about 11 million. During the COVID-19 outbreak, there was
a restriction of movements of individuals due to quarantine in the city. As a consequence, there
was a limitation on the spread of the disease. In agreement, in our model we consider, as the total
population under study, N = 11000000/250. This denominator has been determined in the first
days of the outbreak and later has been proved to be a correct value: according to the real data
published by the WHO, it is an appropriate value for the restriction of movements of individuals.
As for the initial conditions, the following values have been fixed: S0 = N − 6, E0 = 0, I0 = 1,
P0 = 5, A0 = 0, H0 = 0, R0 = 0, and F0 = 0.

We would like to mention that there exist gaps in the reports of the WHO at the beginning
of the outbreak. For completeness, we give here the list LC of the number of confirmed cases in
Wuhan per day, corresponding to the green line of Figure 2, and the list LD of the number of dead
individuals in Wuhan per day, corresponding to the red line of Figure 3:
LC = [6, 12, 19, 25, 31, 38, 44, 60, 80, 131, 131, 259, 467, 688, 776, 1776, 1460, 1739, 1984, 2101, 2590, 2827,

Lists LC and LD have 66 numbers, where LC (0) represents the number of confirmed cases 04
January 2020 (day 0) and LC (65) the number of confirmed cases 09 March 2020 (day 65) and,
analogously, LD (0) represents the number of dead on January 4 and LD (65) the number of dead
on March 9, 2020.
6. Conclusions and Discussion
Classical models consider SIR populations. Here we have taken into consideration the superspreaders (P ), hospitalized (H), and fatality class (F ), so that its derivative (see formula (2)) gives
the number of deaths (D). Our model is an ad hoc compartmental model of the COVID-19, taking
into account its particularities, some of them still not well-known, giving a good approximation
of the reality of the Wuhan outbreak (see Figure 2) and predicting a diminishing on the daily
number of confirmed cases of the disease. This is in agreement with our computations of the basic
reproduction number in Section 4 that, surprisingly, is obtained less than 1. Moreover, it is worth
to mention that our model fits also enough well the real data of daily confirmed deaths, as shown
in Figure 3.

Our theoretical findings and numerical results adapt well to the real data and it reflects or
reflected the reality in Wuhan, China. The number of hospitalized persons is relevant to give an
estimate of the Intensive Care Units (ICU) needed. Some preliminary simulations indicate that
this would be useful for the health authorities. Our model can also be used to study the reality
of other countries, whose outbreaks are currently on the rise. We claim that some mathematical
models like the one we have proposed here will contribute to reveal some important aspects of this
pandemia.
Of course, this investigation has some limitations, being the first on the relative recent spread
of the new coronavirus and therefore the limited data accessible at the beginning of this study.
In the future, we can develop further this prototype. Even with these shortcomings, the model
can be useful due to the high relevance of the topic. Finally, we suggest new directions for further
research:
1. the transmissibility from asymptomatic individuals;
2. compare, in the near future, our results with other models;

consider sub-populations related to age, gender, etc.;
introduce preventive measures in this COVID-19 epidemic and for future viruses;
integrate into the model some imprecise data by using fuzzy differential equations;
include the viral load of the infectious into the model.

These and other questions are under current investigation and will be addressed elsewhere.
