An accurate closed-form solution is obtained to the SIR Epidemic Model through the use of Asymptotic
Approximants (Barlow et. al, 2017, Q. Jl Mech. Appl. Math, 70 (1), 21-48). The solution is created by
analytically continuing the divergent power series solution such that it matches the long-time asymptotic
behavior of the epidemic model. The utility of the analytical form is demonstrated through its application to
the COVID-19 pandemic.
There are several problems of mathematical physics
in which the only available analytic solution is a divergent and/or truncated power series expansion. Over the
past decade, a new approach has evolved to overcome
the convergence barrier in series solutions. An asymptotic approximant is a closed-form expression whose expansion in one region is exact up to a specified order
and whose asymptotic equivalence in another region is
enforced. The remarkable feature of asymptotic approximants is their ability to attain uniform accuracy not only
in these two regions, but also at all points in-between, as
demonstrated thus far for problems in thermodynamics,
astrophysics, and fluid dynamics1–7 . The current need to
model and predict viral epidemics motivates us to extend
the application of asymptotic approximants to the commonly used Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model.
This model is formulated as a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. Although no exact analytic
solution has yet been found for the SIR model, a convergent series solution may be formulated via the homotopy
analysis method8 . Here, we provide an alternative and
simple analytic approach. Interestingly, the SIR model
shares the same asymptotic features as boundary layer
flow over a moving flat plate, for which asymptotic approximants have already been applied4 . The analytic
nature of the asymptotic approximant derived in what
follows is advantageous. Model parameters may be extracted for available COVID-19 data via a least squares
(or equivalent) technique without the need for an embedded numerical scheme.
The SIR epidemic model considers the time-evolution
of a susceptible population, S(t), interacting with an infected population, I(t), where t is time. This model is
expressed as9
dS
= −rSI
dt

where r, α, S0 , I0 are non-negative constant parameters9 . Once (1) is solved, the recovered population is
extracted as:
Z t
R(t) = α
I(ζ)dζ.
(2)
0

Equation (1a) can be thought of as a standard collision
model in a 2nd -order chemical reaction, where species S
and I “collide” to deplete the population of S to create
the species I. In this interpretation, r is a rate constant,
which in practice may be reduced by population behavior such as “social distancing”. In the case where α=0
in (1b), the system (1) indicates that S + I = S0 + I0
for all time. For α 6= 0, then, the number of infected
are reduced in time in accordance with (1b), and it is
seen that the parameter α determines the rate of recovery of infected individuals. The omission of a negative
αI(t) term in (1a) is an implicit model assumption that
the recovered population is no longer susceptible to the
disease.
We now manipulate the system (1) into an equivalent
first-order equation to simplify the analysis that follows.
Equations (1a) and (1b) are divided to obtain

System (5) is equivalent to (1) to solve for S and, once
solved, the solution for I may be obtained using (4),

We expand S as t → ∞ as follows:

are neglected to achieve the following linearized equation

κ = rS∞ − α.

(9b)

In writing (9b), the definition of β in (5b) has been employed. Additionally, to obtain (9), equation (7) has been
used which eliminates all O(1) terms in the linearized system. The solution to (9) is
S1 = εeκt ,

(10)

where ε is an unknown constant that can only be determined via connection with short-time behavior. Consistent with the assumptions made, we find κ < 0 such
that S1 → 0 as t → ∞. Thus the long-time asymptotic
behavior of S is given by
S ∼ S∞ + εeκt , t → ∞.

The result (6) is obtained by applying Cauchy’s product
rule10 to expand S 2 and S ln S in (5). The expansion of
ln S is obtained by first applying Cauchy’s product rule to
the identity SS −1 = 1 and evaluating like-terms to obtain
a recursive expression for the coefficients of the expansion
of S −1 , given by (6d). The expansion of S −1 is subsequently integrated term-by-term to obtain the expansion
of ln S, whose coefficients are given by (6c). Although
the series solution given by (6) is an analytic solution
to (5), it is only valid within its radius of convergence
and is incapable of capturing the long-time behavior of
S. This motivates the construction of an approximant to
analytically continue the series beyond this convergence
barrier.
The long-time asymptotic behavior of the system (5)
is required to develop our asymptotic approximant, and
so we proceed as follows. It has been proven in prior
literature11 that S approaches a limiting value, S∞ , as
t → ∞, and this corresponds to I → 0 according to (5).
The value of S∞ satisfies equation (4) with I = 0 as11

(11)

Higher order corrections to the expansion (11) may be obtained by the method of dominant balance12 as a series of
more rapidly damped exponentials of the form enκt where
n > 1. This long-time asymptotic behavior of successive
exponentials mimics that of the Sakiadis boundary layer
problem describing flow along a moving plate in a stationary fluid4 . It is natural, then, to apply the Sakiadis
approximant4 to capture this asymptotic behavior while
retaining the t = 0 behavior given by (6a). The Sakiadis
approximant imposes the exponential form of the longtime asymptotic behavior (11) for all time; the coefficients of the exponentials are determined by matching
their short-time expansion to the known power series developed about t = 0 in the form of (6a). However, here we
find that a reciprocal expression that achieves the same
t → ∞ behavior (11) (through its binomial expansion)
converges faster than the original Sakiadis approixmant.

expansion with that of the reciprocal of the right-hand

FIG. 3. Analytical and numerical solutions to the SIR model (5) where S, I, and R are in units of people and t is in days.
All other notation and labels are the same as in figure 1. The model parameters values α=0.0164 and r=2.9236×10−5 were
obtained via a least-squares fit between the asymptotic approximant and Japan COVID-19 outbreak data13 (◦’s), using initial
conditions I0 = 2 (from the first point in the data set13 ) and S0 = 4206. Here t = 0 is January 22, 2020 (see main text for
interpretation of the COVID-19 data).

code for computing the An coefficients is available from
the authors15 . A Python code is also available from N.
Barlow and J. Van Dyke∗ .
Figure 1a provides a typical comparison of the N -term
series solution (6) denoted by SS,N (and dashed lines),
the N -term approximant (12) denoted by SA,N (solid
lines), and the numerical solution (indicated by symbols). Note that the series solution has a finite radius
of convergence as evidenced by the poor agreement and
divergence from the numerical solution at larger times,
even as additional terms are included. By contrast, the
approximant converges as additional terms are included.
For N = 15, the approximant is visibly indistinguishable
from the numerical solution (obtained by forward differencing) with a maximum relative error on the order of the
numerical time-step (here 10−2 ) over the time range indicated. Increasing the number of terms beyond N = 15
does improve accuracy up to a point, but also increases
the likelihood of deficient approximants for which the denominator can be zero for certain time values and specific
values of N . In general, the lowest number of terms that
yields the desired accuracy is chosen to avoid this behavior. The convergence of the approximant with increasing N is a necessary condition for a valid approximant.
For the problems of mathematical physics to which we
have applied asymptotic approximants1–7 , we have observed that convergence of approximants implies excellent agreement with numerical results. There is as-of-yet
∗ https://github.com/nsbsma/SIR-approximant

no proof developed that guarantees this result, but this
interesting behavior has been a property of all approximants developed thus far. In figure 1b, the converged
(N = 15) asymptotic approximant for S is used to obtain R and I (from equations (2) and (4), respectively)
and is compared with the numerical solution for these
quantities.
In figure 2, the approximant is applied to a case examined in Khan et al. 8 to model the 1966 bubonic plague
outbreak in Eyam, England. In figure 3, the approximant is applied to COVID-19 data for Japan13 . An increased number of terms in the approximant is required
to achieve the same relative errors in figures 1, 2, and 3.
For all cases examined, we observe that this trend correlates with the breadth of the initial S plateau.
Note that the reported COVID-19 outbreak data13 in
figure 3 is originally provided in terms of confirmed cases
and recovered individuals per day. The difference between these two quantities is used as an approximation
to compare with the quantity I of the SIR model. It is
acknowledged that the actual COVID-19 data is influenced by transient effects not included in the SIR model
such as the exposure lag-time; these effects are incorporated in more sophisticated models such as SEIR11 . The
approximation of I from COVID-19 data is not restrictive in the current context, as our purpose is to show
the efficacy of the closed form approximant rather than
assess the validity of the SIR model.
In figure 3, a least squares fit of the asymptotic approximant to I data is used to extract SIR parameters α and
r based on data from the initial stages of the COVID-

5
19 epidemic in Japan. To do so, (4) is used to relate
I analytically to the solution for S (here, the approximant SA,30 ); note that S∞ , used in the approximant, is
affected by these parameters explicitly according to (7).
The value of S0 is not provided in the data set13 , and
a least-squares algorithm is ineffective at determining an
optimal value. Here, we choose the value of S0 to be twice
that of the maximum value of I approximated from the
data, as it captures a typical curve shape for S seen in
applications of the SIR model11 . In regards to the sensitivity of fitting parameters to the choice for S0 , a 100%
difference in S0 leads to roughly a 50% difference in r and
a 6% difference in α. The fit is made especially simple
owing to the analytical form of the approximant that obviates the need to embed the numerical solution in such
an algorithm. The population of recovered individuals,
R, is extracted from the solution for I by direct integration in accordance with (2). Note that the predicted
curve for R in figure 3, obtained solely by fitting data
for I, is in good agreement with approximations from
COVID-19 data for the recovered population, and serves
as a check on the consistency of the data and algorithm.
It is evident from the results presented here that an
asymptotic approximant can be used to provide accurate
analytic solutions to the SIR model. Future work should
focus on whether the asymptotic approximant technique
can yield a closed form solution to more sophisticated

epidemic models.
