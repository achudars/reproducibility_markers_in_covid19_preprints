Abstract. The dramatic outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) pandemics and its ongoing progression boosted the scientific community’s
interest in epidemic modeling and forecasting. The SIR (Susceptible-InfectedRemoved) model is a simple mathematical model of epidemic outbreaks, yet
for decades it evaded the efforts of the community to derive an explicit solution. The present work demonstrates that this is a non-trivial task. Notably, it
is proven that the explicit solution of the model requires the introduction of a
new transcendental special function, related to the Wright’s Omega function.
The present manuscript reports new analytical results and numerical routines
suitable for parametric estimation of the SIR model. The manuscript introduces iterative algorithms approximating the incidence variable, which allows
for estimation of the model parameters from the numbers of observed cases.
The numerical approach is exemplified with data from the European Centre
for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) for several European countries in
the period Jan 2020 – Jun 2020.

1. Introduction
The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) disease was reported to appear for the first
time in Wuhan, China, and later it spread to Europe, which is the subject of the presented case studies, and eventually worldwide. While there are individual clinical
reports for COVID-19 re-infections, the present stage of the pandemic still allows
for the application of a relatively simple epidemic model, which is the subject of
the present report. The motivation behind the presented research was the intention
to accurately model the short-term dynamics of the outbreaks of COVID-19 pandemics, which by the time of writing, has infected more than 27 million individuals
worldwide. The efforts to contain the spread of the pandemic induce sustained
social and economic damage. Therefore, the ability to accurately forecast short to
medium-term epidemic outbreak’s dynamics is of substantial public interest.
The present manuscript gives a comprehensive analytical and numerical treatment of the SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Removed) epidemiological model. The SIR
model was introduced in 1927 by Kermack and McKendrick in 1927 to study the
plague and cholera epidemics in London and Bombay [9]. To date the SIR model
remains as a cornerstone of mathematical epidemiology. It is a deterministic model

formulated in terms of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The model has
been extensively used to study the spread of various infectious diseases (see the
monograph of Martcheva [10]).
The objective of the present paper is to demonstrate numerical routines for curvefitting allowing for estimation of the parameters of the SIR model from empirical
data. To this end, the paper exhibits an algorithm, which can be used to compute
the population variables as functions of time. In contrast to previous approaches, I
do not consider the SIR model as an initial value problem but as a problem in the
theory of special functions. This change of perspective allows for handling noisy
data, e.g. time series having fluctuations caused by delays and accumulation of case
reporting. The numerical approach is applied to the COVID-19 incidence and case
fatality data in different European countries, having different population densities
and dynamics of the epidemic outbreaks.

2. The SIR model
The SIR model is formulated in terms of 3 populations of individuals. The S
population consists of all individuals susceptible to the infection of concern. The
I population comprises the infected individuals. These persons have the disease
and can transmit it to the susceptible individuals. The R poulation cannot become
infected and the individuals cannot transmit the disease to others. The model
comprises a set of three ODEs:
Ṡ(t) = −

β
S(t)I(t)
N

˙ = β S(t)I(t) − γI(t)
I(t)
N
Ṙ(t) = γI(t)

(1)
(2)
(3)

The model assumes a constant overall population N = S + I + R. An disease
carrier infects on average β individuals per day, for an average time of 1/γ days.
The β parameter is called disease transmission rate, while γ – recovery rate. The
average number of infections arising from an infected individual is then modelled
by the number R0 = βγ , the basic reproduction number. Typical initial conditions
are S(0) = S0 , I(0) = I0 , R(0) = 0 [9].
The model can be re-parametrized using normalized variables as
ṡ = −si
i̇ = si − gi,
ṙ = gi,

(4)
g=

subject to normalization s + i + r = 1 and time rescaling τ = βt. Therefore, since
i(τ ) is integrable on [0, ∞) then i(∞) = 0.

The analytical solution will be formulated first in an implicit form. Since there
is a first integral by construction the system can be reduced to two equations:

must hold for the infection to propagate. Re is called the effective reproductive
number, while the basic reproduction number is R0 = Re N [19].
Re = N

In order to solve the model we will consider the two equations separately. Direct
integration of the equation 7 gives
i = −s + g log s + c
where the constant c can be determined from the initial conditions. In the present
treatment, the constant c will be left indeterminate to be assigned by the different
re-parametrization procedures. The s variable can be expressed explicitly in terms
of the Lambert W function [4]:
!
i−c
e g
s = −gW± −

g
where the signs denote the two different real-valued branches of the function. Note,
that both branches are of interest since the argument of the Lambert W function
is negative. Therefore, the ODE 5 can be reduced to the first-order autonomous
system

3.2. Initial value parametrization. As customarily accepted, the SIR model
can be recast as an initial value problem. The indeterminate constant c can be
eliminated using the initial condition

Therefore,

The result follows by considering the autonomous system 7 and fixing the upper

evaluated only numerically.

4. Is the incidence function ”new”?
The incidence i -function of the SIR model appears to be an interesting object
of study on its won. One may pose the question about the representation of this
function by other, possibly, elementary functions. The answer to this question is
in the negative as will be demonstrated below. In precise terms, this function is
non-Liouvillian. However, this does not mean that the function can not be well
approximated. Fortunately, this is the case as the i -function can be approximated
for a sufficiently wide domain of parameter values by Newtonian iteration.
Definition 1. An elementary function is defined as a function built from a finite
number of combinations and compositions of algebraic, exponential and logarithm
functions under algebraic operations (+,-,., /)
Allowing for the underlying field to be complex numbers – C, trigonometric
functions become elementary as well.
Definition 2 (Liouvillian function). We say that f (x) is a Liouvillian function if
it lies in some Liouvillian extension of (C(x),0 ) for some constant field C.
As a first point we establish the non-elementary character of the integral in
eq. 11. The necessary introduction to the theory of differential fields is given
in the Appendix B. From the work of Liouville it is known that if a function
F (x) = f (x)eq(x) , where f , q are elementary functions, has an elementary antiderivative of the form [18]
Z
Z
F (x)dx = f eq dx = heq
for some elementary function h(x) [2]. Therefore, differentiating we obtain
f eq = h0 eq + hq 0 eq
so that if eq 6= 0
h0 + hq 0 = f
holds. The claim can be strengthened to demand that h be algebraic for algebraic
f and q.
Theorem 1. The integrals

are not Liouvillian.
Proof. We use im parametrization. Let c = im + g − g log g. The proof proceeds by change of variables – first ξ = g log y − yg + g + im ; followed by z =
log ((g log y + im + g)/g).

since W± (−ye−y ) = −y. The last integral has the form

so that

for some unknown algebraic h(z). Since the left-hand side of the equation is transcendental in z so is the right-hand side. Therefore, the integrand has no elementary
antiderivative.

The proof establishes also the validity of two additional propositions:
Proposition 2. The integral
Z
I=

dy
y (g log(y) − gy + c)

is not Liouvillian.

Theorem 2. The incidence function i(t), defined by the differential eq. 10, is not
Liouvillian.
Proof. For the present case, let us assume that i(0) = im so that i attains the
maximum by Prop 1. Therefore,
  i−im 

i0 = −gi W −e g −1 + 1
Without loss of generality let g = 1, which amounts to scaling of the solution by
the factor of 1/g.
Suppose further that
i − im − 1 = log u − u
for some algebraic function u (log-extension case). Then

so that
−

1−u
1−u
=

u0

However, if u is algebraic so is u0 by Th. 3. Therefore, we have a contradiction,
since the left-hand-side is transcendental. Hence, i is not part of a logarithmic
elementary extension.
Suppose that u is exponential, i. e. u = ef for some algebraic function f . In
this case,

ef − 1 f 0
= 1 − ef → −f 0 = −ef + f + im + 1
−ef + f + im + 1
However,
f 0 + f + im + 1 = ef
Therefore, the right-hand-side is exponential and can not be algebraic as it is demanded by Corr 1. This is a contradiction, hence f can not be algebraic, hence u
is not part of an exponential elementary extension.
Finally, suppose that i(t) is algebraic. Since the Wright function Ω(z) is transcendental [5] it follows that W −ei−im −1 = Ω (i − im − 1 + iπ) can not be algebraic
in i. Therefore, i0 /i and hence i must be transcendental. Hence, the case of an
algebraic i(t) can not hold either.
In summary all three cases are rejected, therefore, i is not Liouvillian.

Remark 3. Prelle and Singer [15] prove in Corollary 3 that if the autonomous
system y 0 = f (y) has an elementary first integral then
Z
dy
g(y) =
f (y)
is also elementary. This presents a direct way of proving that the i-function is non
elementary by virtue of Th. 1 but leaves open the question about the non-Liouvilian
character of the i-function.
5. Series solutions
We will give two series for the i -function in view of the different re-parametrizations
of the SIR model.
5.1. Series for thr im parametrization. The natural parametrization is fixing
the peak at the origin. The Taylor development can be computed as follows:

5.2. Series for the i0 -parametrization. The Taylor series starting from an initial value i0 is

log i(t) = log (i0 ) − (i0 + g − 1) t +

(25)

The series follow directly from successive differentiation of the differential equation
19.
6. Numerical approximation
The i-function can be efficiently approximated by the Newton’s method. The
Newton iteration scheme is given as follows for the c-parametrization:

of using the Lambert function for the quadrature routine. Another equivalent

(see Prop. 5). This form has the advantage of requiring only 1 Lambert function
evaluation per iteration.
A point of attention here is the choice of the initial value for the iteration scheme.
Despite my best efforts, a rigorous analytical asymptotic valid on the entire real
line and for all parameter values could not be found. Numerical experiments gave
acceptable results using the formula

g > 0, c = 2bg or c = 2 bg/e, and additionally c ← c/ e, x > 0 for the initial

6.1. Plots. Plots of the branches of the integral I(x) (Fig. 1) were obtained by
direct numerical integration using the QUADPACK [13] routines in the Computer
Algebra System Maxima. Plots of the SIR model (Fig. 2) were obtained using a
Java routine [16] implementing the double exponential integration method [11, 12].
Both methods turn out to be suitable for the numerical integration problem.

8. Data analysis
8.1. Processing. The data were imported in the SQLite https://www.sqlite.
org database and further filtered by country transferred to MATLAB for parametric
fitting using native routines. Fitted parameters were stored in the same database.
8.2. Parametric fitting. The parametric fitting was conducted using the fminsearchbnd routine, which allows for constrained optimization. To reduce the impact
of the fluctuation in the weekly reporting of data the parametric fitting procedure
was applied first to 7 day moving average of the time series. The fitting algorithm
is exemplified with datasets from Belgium, the Netwherlands, Italy, Germany and
Bulgaria for the period Jan 2020 – Jun 2020. The fitting equation is given by
It ∼ N I (t/10.0 − T |g, im )
where It is the observed incidence or mortality, respectively, while N, T, g and im
are estimated from the data. For numerical stability reasons the time during the
fitting procedure is rescaled by a factor of 10.
9. Results
The observed case fatality represented a parameter, which could be established
with more confidence in the beginning of the pandemic due to the lack of testing
and the non-specificity of the clinical signs of COVID-19. Hence, it was the primary
target of the parametric fitting.
9.1. Analysis of case fatality data. The data fitting procedure is illustrated
with the case fatality data of Belgium and are presented in Fig. 3. The T , N and
im are estimated from the observed data. For the g parameter an initial estimate of
0.75 is used (i.e. R0 = 1.33). The intermediate parameters are initially estimated
on the 3-day moving average data. The final fit was performed on the raw data,
using the intermediate parameters as initial values. The cumulative mortality data
were estimated from eq. 17. As can be appreciated from Fig. 3 fluctuations
in reporting did not have a detrimental effect on the estimation procedure. The
results for Germany, Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands are presented in Table 1.

9.3. Tracking of multiple outbreaks. Changes of containment policies are meant
to result in changes in the epidemic outbreak dynamics. This can be followed by
the SIR model as demonstrated in the Bulgarian incidence dataset, where resuming of public sports events in the end of June correlates with the 3rd and ongoing
increase of incidence (Fig. 5). The process is difficult to automate because of the
fluctuations in the data. Nevertheless, it was possible to accurately track the past
outbreaks.
10. Discussion
The SIR model was formulated to model epidemic outbreaks [9].The model has
only two independent variables and two parameters, which allow for their estimation
from data. There is a renewed interest in this model in view of the coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemics [6, 14, 3, 17]. For decades the model evaded
the efforts of the community to derive explicit solution. A formal analytical solution
of the SIR model has been found only recently and formulated in the traditional
setting of an initial value problem [8]. Yet, another perspective can be also of merit –
the model can be treated as a manifold problem, which can be parametrized by any

point on the flow. This allows for efficient curve-fitting approach as demonstrated
by the presented results. The approach is exemplified with data from the European
Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) for several European countries
in the period Jan 2020 – Jun 2020. The presented results can be discussed along
three main directions.
10.1. Analytical. The present manuscript establishes novel analytical results about
the SIR model. From mathematical perspective, these are mostly the non-elementarity
results for most of the presented integrals. Another interesting point is the proof
of the non-Liouvillian character of the incidence i -function. An alternative proof
could be also given, in principle, based on the work of Prelle and Singer [15].
10.2. Numerical. Presented results demonstrate the robustness of the fitting procedure with regard to the fluctuations in the raw data. On the other hand, more

efforts are necessary in establishing a robust asymptotic of the incidence i -function.
This is a clear direction for future research.
On the second place, the analytical formula involving first exponentiation and
then computation of the Lambert W function has disadvantages for large arguments
due to float under or overflows [5]. Therefore, another special function can be used
in principle, notably the Wright Ω function. On the other hand, optimized routines
for its calculation are not readily available in MATLAB.
10.3. Epidemiological implications of the results. Recorded data necessarily
suffer from diverse biases. For example, the marked difference in the availability
of tests in the early stages of the pandemics in different countries. Another one
is the unsteady reporting resulting in fluctuations of the numbers. This severely
limits the usefulness of the model formulation as an initial value problem, which is
the standard mathematical assumption. This can result is drastic overestimation
of the infection peak (see for example the predictions for UK in [7]).
Presented results indicate that there is a universality in the time evolution of
COVID-19 and the same epidemic model, notably SIR, can be applied to countries
having large differences in populations sizes and densities. More interestingly, the
model seems to fit well also the mortality data, which can be interpreted in the
sense that the vulnerable population forms a distinct subpopulation from all susceptible individuals (e.g. elderly people). Presented data lend support to a simple
modification of the SIR model: notably – the SIRD model with an independent
population of dead (D) persons. This corresponds to the recent findings of other
authors [6, 3].

A key finding of the present report is that simple models can be very useful in
studying the epidemic outbreaks. This can be eventually extended to predicting
the effects of different containment measures or the lack thereof [17].
Appendix A. Special functions
A.1. The Lambert W function. The Lambert W function can be defined implicitly by the equation
W (z)eW (z) = z, z ∈ C
We observe that by Lemma 1 W (z) is transcendental. Furthermore, the Lambert
function obeys the differential equation for x 6= −1
W (x)0 =

e−W (x)
1 + W (x)

W is a multivalued function. It has many applications in pure and applied mathematics. Properties of the W function are given in [4]. Useful identities

A.2. The Wright Ω function. The Wright Ω function is related to the Lambert
W function [4]
Ω(z) = WK(z) (ez ) , z ∈ C
where K(z) = d(Im(z) − π) /2πe is the unwinding number of z. Moreover,
Ω(z) + log Ω(z) = z,

Definition 3. Denote by C (x, ci , θi ) the complex-valued ring, generated by the
finite set of rational functions {θi }ni and constants {ci }ni .
Definition 4. An element θ is called algebraic if P (x, θ) = 0 for some polynomial
P (x, t) = tm + am−1 tm−1 + . . . + a0 ,
where ai can be also rational functions of x, or else it is called transcendental.
Lemma 1 (Composition lemma). Denote by a and t the algebraic or transcendental
elementary functions, respectively. The following compositions hold
a ◦ a = a,

t ◦ a = t,

a◦t=t

Proof. The case a ◦ a when a(x) is a polynomial is trivial. Suppose that a and b
are both algebraic:
P (x, a) = 0, Q(x, b) = 0
Without loss of generality suppose that ai are polynomial. Formally, b = f¯k (x)
for any branch k with f¯ algebraic since it is a root of a polynomial, where the
bar denotes the inverse function in order to avoid confusion with exponentiation.
Therefore,
a ◦ b = bm + am−1 bm−1 + . . . + a0 = f¯m (x) + am−1 f¯m−1 (x) + . . . + a0

Suppose that t = exp(x). Then exp(a) is not algebraic, hence it is transcendental.
P (x, ex ) = exm + am−1 exm−x + . . . + a0
is exponential.
Suppose that t = log(x). Then log(a) is not algebraic, hence it is transcendental.
P (x, log(x)) = logm x + am−1 logm−1 x + . . . + a0
is not algebraic, hence it is transcendental.

In what follows is assumed that the differential field is of characteristic zero and
has an algebraically closed field of constants. An element y of a differential field is
said to be an exponential of an element A if y 0 = Ay, an exponential of an integral
of an element A if y 0 = Ay; logarithm of an element A if y 0 = A0 /A, and an integral
of an element A if y 0 = A.
The next definition is due to [1].
Definition 5. Let (k,0 ≡ d/dx) be a differential field of characteristic 0. A differential extension (K,0 ≡ d/dx) of k is called Liouvillian over k if there are θ1 , . . . , θn ∈
K, such that K = C(x, θ1 , . . . , θn ) and for all i, at least one of the following
(1) θi is algebraic over k(θ1 , . . . , θn−1 )
(2) θi0 ∈ k(θ1 , . . . , θn−1 )
(3) θi0 /θi ∈ k(θ1 , . . . , θn−1 )
holds. The constant subfield C(K) of K is defined to be the set of c in K, such that
c0 = 0.
The next theorem is due to [2].
Theorem 3. If K is an elementary field, then it is closed under differentiation.
An elementary integrability theorem due to Conrad [2].
Theorem 4 (Rational Liouville criterion). For f, g ∈ C (x) with f and g nonconstant the function f (x)eg (x) can be integrated in elementary terms if and only
if there exists a rational function h ∈ C (x) such that h0 + g 0 h = f .
The last result can be extended to algebraic functions as follows.
Corollary 1 (Algebraic Liouville criterion). For f (x), g(x) algebraic and nonconstant, the function f (x)eg(x) can be integrated in elementary terms if and only
if there exists an algebraic function h(x), for which h0 + g 0 h = f .
Proof. Suppose that f and g are arbitrary elementary algebraic functions. Denote
the primitive of f as f ÷ F . The integral can be integrated by parts

We observe that g 0 (x) is elementary by Th. 3. The L.H.S has the form f eg and
since f (x) + F (x)g 0 (x) is elementary we can identify
h ≡ F,

f1 ≡ f + F g 0 = h0 + hg 0

so that (h0 + hg 0 ) eg = (heg ) and the claim follows.
