Abstract: The SARS-CoV-2 infectious outbreak has rapidly spread across the globe and
precipitated varying policies to effectuate physical distancing to ameliorate its impact. In this
study, we propose a new hybrid machine learning model, SIRN ET, for forecasting the spread
of the COVID-19 pandemic that couples with the epidemiological models. We use categorized
spatiotemporally explicit cellphone mobility data as surrogate markers for physical distancing,
along with population weighted density and other local data points.
We demonstrate at varying geographical granularity that the spectrum of physical distancing
options currently being discussed among policy leaders have epidemiologically significant differences in consequences, ranging from viral extinction to near complete population prevalence.
The current mobility inflection points vary across geographical regions. Experimental results
from SIRN ET establish preliminary bounds on such localized mobility that asymptotically induce containment. The model can support in studying non-pharmacological interventions and
approaches that minimize societal collateral damage and control mechanisms for an extended

period of time.

Introduction

Machine learning techniques have offered solutions to many modeling problems, assuming
there is abundant data to train a system [1]. With the rapid impact of COVID-19, several research groups have begun exploring statistical and mathematical models to study the spread of
the disease. One of the early studies using AI [2] identified the global spread of the disease
through commercial airlines, if the outbreak continues. There are several inefficiencies with
the current data available for COVID-19 research, such as limited testing capabilities and high
variability within the testing rate (e.g.: 22.08/1000 in Italy, 11.16/1000 in US, to 0.27/1000 in
India [3, 4]), inconsistencies in reporting (under reporting), and publicly available data on infection rates currently are unreliable. Particularly lacking is an understanding of the underlying
factors which impact the spread, accuracy and availability of reported cases on a small scale,
and quantifiable metrics for how social distancing and quarantine efforts impact the spread. To
overcome these challenges in providing early models for forecasting the spread of COVID-19,
we combine compartmentalized models with a data-driven machine learning approach. In doing so, we address a potential pitfall of machine learning (ensuring compliance with the laws
of epidemic dynamics) and a limitation of epidemiological models (enabling the creation of
complex mappings from available data sources to critical modeling parameters).
In infectious diseases which are human-human transmissible, individual contact rates drive
the spread of infectious pathogens across a population over time. To reduce the high contact
rate of COVID-19, several efforts have been taken including social distancing and lockdowns.
To account for social distancing and lockdown efforts, we use categorized cell phone mobility
2

data from Google LLC [5] which includes tracking activity at grocery/pharmacy stores, parks,
retail/recreation, residential, train stations, and workplaces globally. The tracking activity is
provided in an aggregated format at the country level, state level, and in the US at the county
level.
This allows us to implement the epidemic model (which can easily be updated to any of the
modules), with a dynamic set of parameters which evolve temporally based on social distancing
regulations and other non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce the spread of COVID-19. This
is useful as it allows us to model the role of mobility in managing the spread of COVID-19 and
provide insight into potential scenarios if restrictions are lifted by different degrees at certain
points in time.

SARS-CoV-2

In December 2019, an atypical case of pneumonia was diagnosed in Wuhan [6–8], Hubei
province of China which was named COVID-19 and the virus was termed as SARS-CoV24 [6]. It is a beta coronavirus which is a single-stranded positive sense RNA virus associated
SARS-CoV [9, 10]. Because the disease is relatively new, the epidemiology of the virus has
changed significantly so far [11–15]. Most cases occur in adults [16]. It is transmitted from
person to person through respiratory droplets (within 6 feet) or less likely through contact with
fomites [17–19]. The average incubation period is 5.2 days, and each case spreads the infection
to an estimated 2.2 people [20]. The median duration of viral shedding has been reported by
one study as 20 days with range from 8 to 37 days [21].
First case of COVID19 in US was diagnosed in state of Washington in January 2020 and
now U.S. has the highest toll of infected cases and deaths in the world. With no end in sight
for the COVID-19 pandemic, it may continue to spread for next several months leading to
millions of infections and thousands of deaths before we reach herd immunity. Herd immunity
3

means when at least 60% of the population is immune from the infection, either through natural
exposure to the virus or vaccine administration. Unfortunately, the current infection/exposure
estimates for COVID19 are around 1% to 2%.
In the meantime, protective measures such as social distancing, hand washing, avoiding
close contact with a sick person, closure of non-essential services, stay at home orders, and covering mouth and nose when around other people are recommended to âĂIJflatten the curveâĂİ
of the epidemic. Without such measures, there can be a high burden on healthcare systems due
to the need for hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, and mechanical ventilation. These
mitigation efforts, however, do not come without economic and other human consequences.
Approximately 10 million Americans applied for unemployment benefits in the last 2 weeks of
March and world stock markets lost approximately one-third of their value [22].

Importance of Mobility in Modeling

Appropriately tuning mitigation efforts to optimize social welfare has been confounded by the
heterogeneous and wave-like pattern of peak-impact globally. The United States, similarly, can
expect a high degree of variable impact across metropolitan and micropolitan areas in terms of
adherence to policy restrictions on mobility [23], case fatality rates [24], seroprevalence [25],
and economic impact [26]. Ultimately policy leaders must, by both necessity and by national
policy prescription, translate this variability into an effective reproductive number in order to
make optimal policy. The primary challenge posed include the ability to accurately make prescriptive policy in a highly dynamic and geopolitical heterogeneous setting. The capacity to
collect, interpret, and model data to make estimates of current and future effective reproductive
numbers is now of paramount concern as the United States undertakes phasic pandemic risk
mitigation adjustments in order to optimize population morbidity with economic productivity.
The stakes cannot be higher: where adjustments are made to decrease overall restrictions on
4

mobility, assuming all other factors held constant, it will be met with increases in infection.
Several recent studies highlight this behavior [27–29]. If the increase in infection is too high,
the effective reproductive number will set off a second wave equal to or greater than the initial
wave. Similarly, delayed rescindment of restrictions on mobility results in a different type of a
second wave: economic disparity, morbidity from inadequately addressed chronic disease, and
delayed costs from things like deferred youth education.
Given the above observations, we believe mobility data offers a unique and powerful opportunity to build a valuable model that can answer these challenges. While mobility is most
obviously associated with contact rate we believe it has unrealized value via insight into important public health population characteristics which are also dynamic. In particular, mobility
data may allow us to indirectly incorporate population features such as health literacy, virtual
social substitution (the ability of a population to substitute virtual contact for real contact), and
business buy-in [23]. Each of these features may be difficult to measure directly but may be
indirectly represented in mobility data.
The mobility data metrics incorporated into this model succeed on four key population modeling criteria which directly (and indirectly) impact the ability to model effective reproductive
number: temporally and spatially explicit coverage, representativeness, and contemporaneousness [30]. These metrics are collected in a manner common to all regions which a) allows
for rapid wide-scale data interpolation and extrapolation and b) accurately reflects the unique
geopolitical profile of regions, each with variable laws, customs, socioeconomic profiles, health
care resources, and susceptibility rates. Temporally explicit coverage defines the ability of the
mobility data to reasonably describe the movement behaviors of people in the three main environmental contexts of a population (model representation in parentheses): work (workplace),
non-work non-residential (retail and recreation, grocery and pharmacy, parks, transit stations),
and residential (residential). Spatial specificity refers to the ability to collect granular geograph5

ical data. Representative refers to the ability for the data to offer a high enough sample size to
reasonably reflect the population statistic. Contemporaneousness reflects that population statistics are dynamic; the ability of the model to adjust and incorporate changes in behaviors in near
real-time permits the model to be prescriptive and responsive to data aggregated across regions.
Integration of these metrics into a usable public health resource necessitates a novel and robust
modeling strategy.

Proposed Hybrid Model: SIRN ET

In this research, we focus on learning and forecasting the trends in time series via a hybrid
model of neural networks and epidemiological models. The forecasting network, referred to as
SIRN ET (named after the foundational epidemiological model), learns from i) a sequence of
prior trends that carry long-term contextual information (global time-series) and ii) more recent
data inputs that are raw (local time-series) and can inform the forecasting of any abrupt changes.

Problem Formulation

Here, we formalize the general form of this forecasting problem. We are given a set of time
series that temporally enumerates active, recovered, and fatal cases of COVID-19. The data exhibits varying levels of geographical granularity, i.e., grouping by country, region, sub-region,
etc., and irregular onset of the first case. Each sequence Y ∈ RT ×2 comprises T timesteps, which
varies between samples, each with the count of active cases and recovered cases. Provided this
data, we desire to learn a model that is able to forecast future values of Y. To aid in improving
the fit, additional factors should be considered that may impact the infection, recovery, or mortality rates pertaining to the disease. We refer to these additional attributes as features which can
be either scalar x ∈ RF , spatial X ∈ RF1 ×F2 ×⋅⋅⋅×Fn , and/or temporal X ∈ RT ×F (X ∈ RT ×F1 ×⋅⋅⋅×Fn
if spatiotemporal)1 . With these definitions, the learning problem can be posed as follows (also
see (1)). Given historical case data Y and relevant attributes X for an area or multiple areas,
can we model (M) the latent trends of this data to forecast future cases of COVID-19?

Linear and LSTM Cells

A high-level architecture visualization is shown in Figure 1. The historical time series and local
raw data input can be fed to different types of Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or a Linear
cell. Linear cell can be a simple 3-layer network or a deep network with different activation
functions. A rectified linear unit works best in most cases. RNNs have the ability to learn
patterns from arbitrarily long spatiotemporal data, through cyclic connection of nodes in the
network [31]. An LSTM cell, a type of RNN, addresses some of the shortcomings in vanilla
RNNs, such as vanishing or exploding parameters by adding memory [32]. The LSTM is

The SIRN ET consists of a recurrent neural network to implement the temporal and population dynamics of an SEIR cell, and its framing as such allows us to introduce complex functions
with learnable parameters, enabling mapping from salient input data (such as mobility) to the
underlying properties of the epidemiological model.

4.3

SEIR Cell

One standard approach to epidemic modeling is compartmentalized models such as SEIR - with
Susceptible S, Exposed E (latent infected, but not yet infectious), Infected I, and Recovered R
(no longer infectious, also referred to as removed) states. The rate of change in these parameters
is represented by the ordinary differential equations (3)-(6) and parameterized by β (effective
contact rate/infectious rate learned from mobility data), σ (the incubation rate), and γ (recovery
rate).

R0 =

(7)

In the proposed SIRN ET model, we use two different neural networks to learn the parameters β and γ, based on population weighted density and cell-phone mobility data (latent
information of the contact rate). The mobility data at country, state, and county level is used
to predict the contact rate within those regions respectively. In the model, recovery rate can
be treated as an individual trainable parameter, or it can be treated as a constant established by
medical reporting.
In particular, the model attempts to learn β(t) by mapping β(x(t)), where x represents
relevant temporal data (we consider only time steps of one day). The SEIR cell’s hidden states
consist of the four compartmental groups normalized by population.
While our approach can be extended to many types of data, our work here is focused on
one type in particular: mobility data. Contact rate is a key parameter of the model and its
modification through quarantine measures is an effective way to control the spread of the virus.
Contact rate is a function of population density as well as how people move and interact with
each other. Traditional modeling can retrospectively estimate the change in contact rate brought
about by policy changes (step-function changes), in our approach we build upon this technique
to allow the integration of richer, daily information based on the actual activities of a population.
To this end, we begin with cell-phone based mobility information.
The mobility input vector, x, consists of mobility ratios (current mobility divided by nominal
mobility) in 6 categories provided through [5]. SIRN ET’s task is to use this feature vector to
learn the resulting contact rate as a function of population mobility. Through the use of the
9

SEIR cell, we can map the output to case counts and learn the underlying mobility to contact
rate function in an end-to-end fashion.
For the mobility model, the SEIR cell predicts contact rate according the following function:
β(t) = ReLU(W ⋅ x)

p

(8)

Our model is a linear combination of mobility contributions to an effective mobility, raised
to the power p. The parameterization of p allows the model to learn the effective power of scaling mobility rather than simply assuming one, removing the need to justify a linear or quadratic
relationship (our modeling exercises suggest the latter provides the best representation). The
rectified linear unit function ensures that our model will only produce non-negative contact
rates.
One of the primary challenges in modeling is that the underlying state is difficult to estimate.
The only data that is reliably available is the total case count, and the case count only represents
a fraction of actual cases (with an estimated 50%-80% being underreported). It also lags the true
state of the system by several days. Mobility data will drive exposure, exposure will drive the
amount of the infectious, and the infections will in turn drive the number of cases. To account
for all of these factors, we use the 5-day incubation period [33–35] and add an additional 5 days
to account for the delay between becoming infectious and receiving a positive test confirmation.
This delay in testing is not constant across time, nor is it consistent from location to location,
but the measurable impacts of mobility on contact rate are most apparent when delay is taken
into account.
We initialize the hidden state with the number of active cases at the onset of the epidemic,
I0 .

Assumptions

The model uses case count resources from WHO [36], CDC [37], European CDC [38], NYTimes [39], and Texas DSHS [40]. Specific data reported includes confirmed cases, deaths, and
recovered cases. The population weighted density data and age-group data for US is obtained
from the census website [41] and mobility data is captured from here [5] and here [42]. The
assumptions made in the model are listed in Table 1. Additionally, the effective social distancing measures for each of the regions are populated from here [43]. Testing and recovery data is
collected from multiple sources for cross-validation, such as [43–45].

Results and Analysis

Model analysis for different geographical regions:
The SIRN ET was evaluated on different geographical regions. Figure 3 shows the fit for predicting total cases in a region based on mobility data compared to the ground truth in several
countries. Figures 4 and 5 show the models forecast for different mobility levels in each country for active cases and total cases respectively. These figures demonstrate that the proposed
SIRN ET is able to fit the case count by region well using mobility information to determine
the contact rate of an SEIR cell. Based on the projected forecasts, we observe that a continuation of quarantine level mobility will result low case counts. If the mobility restrictions are
reduced to 50% nominal mobility, the model shows that this is near the edge of stable peak
cases where in some scenarios the curve stays at a low peak, while for others the peak increases
drastically compared to the quarantined mobility and occurs much later. The third scenario is
75% nominal mobility which based on the model is expected to result in a slightly delayed peak
approximately 2/3 the maximum peak during normal mobility. The exception is South Korea,
where at this stage even a return to 75% mobility is not expected to result in a second wave. A
12

zoomed in figure of the forecast of active cases in the US is shown in Figure 6 to better illustrate
the difference between mobility levels. In general, these results suggest a continuation of quarantine level mobility or at least below 50% nominal mobility for the immediate future. Figure 7
shows the model fit with ground truth for the top 28 counties in Texas. In general the model
fits well where the case counts are higher than 50 and as data becomes richer, the fit improves
significantly. Figure 8 highlights a sample of the mobility trends used in all our simulations. It
is important to note that this data reflects a sample space of mobility for the region and
might be missing information on key populations that do not use specific types of devices.
Adding finer granular information and data from multiple data providers can alleviate
this concern, as it becomes open-sourced.

Figure 8: Sample mobility data changes in Bexar County, Texas from Feb 23rd to April 11th . The
star indicates when social distancing measures were implemented in the county (March 23rd ).
Data is collected using webscraping tools developed by the team. By comparison, mobility in
Italy has decreased by ≈ 70% to non-essential locations, with the lockdown procedures. Data

Figure 9: Forecast for Bexar County, TX. All models are driven initially by recorded mobility
and then split to forecast different scenarios. While current mobility (as of 11 April 2020) is
approximately 50% of nominal, relaxing measures at this time could result in runaway growth.
17

Figure 10: Forecast for King County, WA, where a longer period of infection enables better
model fitting. King County’s heavy mobility restrictions are clearly dropping the R0 below 1.

Why Does Reduced Mobility Help?
Our model shows that the epidemic is highly sensitive to changes in mobility rates. Figure
9 and Figure 10 shows examples of two counties at different peak points of spread and how
changing mobility rate is impacting these counties (Bexar county in Texas and King County
in WA). SEIR cell dynamics show the critical points in reproduction number, in which we
project mobility levels showing three possible outcomes. First, heavy mobility restrictions can
drive the contact rate and reproduction number down so that the virus is eliminated from the
population. The number of active cases and the number of total cases are kept to minimal
levels, though the population remains susceptible to second waves. Second, at higher levels
of mobility (those approaching nominal), the virus reproduces prolifically in the population,
with exponential growth ending as herd immunity is reached. This results in both overwhelmed
medical resources due to active cases and a large number of deaths due to the total case count. A
third possibility is a reproduction number of approximately 1. In this scenario, active case count
18

remains low; however, the virus would continue to work its way through the population until
herd immunity is reached, resulting in a large number of total cases and deaths as a slow tail
gradually tapers off. In the mobility scenarios tested across countries or counties, mobility
> .7 leads to an uncontained outbreak, mobility < .5 results in a local elimination of the
virus, and those in between having slower peaks.
Remobilizing a population will require careful monitoring to ensure that the critical reproduction number is not approached. It should also be considered that while our model introduces
a new feature for relating human activity to mobility, it is certainly not the only factor to consider. Changes in behavior, including social distancing and hygiene habits, are certainly also
contributing to the reduced reproduction rate in a way that cannot be considered independently
(their effects are reflected in mobility data, but are difficult to predict in future mobilization).
It is imperative that policymakers consider the dynamic nature of infection. The current projected peak is the worst time to begin relaxing quarantine measures. Also, there is only one
peak for current mobility because of the drastic measures that have been taken thus far.
Continuous monitoring and modeling will be indispensable tools for containing the outbreak,
and models will continue to improve as more data becomes available.
Based on the projections for a region, the SIRN ET model can calculate the potential hospitalization rates by age group, for best and worst case scenarios. This is computed based on local
age demographics, forecasted active cases, and estimated hospitalization rates by age group
from experimental data. An example scenario for a county is shown in Figure 11.

group. The population by age group data for 2018 is obtained from here [41].

Error Tolerance
When using any ML or statistical models to forecast trends, it is important to consider the
confidence interval or margin of error for the predictions. SIRN ET is currently trained on a
specific region it is forecasting, with region-specific assumptions about under-reporting, delay
in reporting, the recovery rate, and the transition rate from exposed to infected. In future work
it will be necessary to account for the error range for each of these variables based on global
reported data, and use this to predict the potential fluctuation in forecasted scenarios. Another
important extension to SIRN ET is to extend learning to multiple regions, providing a more
generalized forecast that can capture distinctions between different regions.

Conclusions and Discussion
Our work takes a multidisciplinary approach to address modeling the spread of COVID-19.
SIRN ET is a hybrid between epidemic modeling, physical science, and machine learning. The
benefit of epidemic modeling, is constraining our network to produce meaningful variables
from a physical standpoint which adds an intuitive understanding of how the model is fore20

casting and provides an approach for overcoming limited or missing real-world data samples.
On the other hand, machine learning provides a tool for translating variables, such as mobility, non-pharmaceutical intervention, and population demographics, into variables that impact
an epidemic model. It also allows us to discover relationships between real-world trends and
the impact on the spread of COVID-19, as well as model scenarios such as relaxing socialdistancing policies. We believe both components are necessary to develop an insightful model
to aid in understanding the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on COVID-19.
Similar to other approaches, we base our study on several biologically observed data and
real-world datasets. We demonstrate how new tools can be created to better exploit available
quantitative measures in the fight against COVID-19. By integrating reliable metrics and wellstudied infection dynamics, we create an approach that is deeply data-driven and science-based.
Our studies confirm the effectiveness of reduced mobility for limiting the reach of the pandemic,
and our models provide a means of forecasting the effects of different mobility scenarios.
SIRN ET is in an early iteration and requires extensive sensitivity analysis to understand the
range of impact of different parameters. Additionally, exhaustive mobility data combined with
non-pharmacological intervention datasets can improve the network predictions. Since several
datasets are proprietary and limited by data user agreements, it will be important to establish
good data collection and standardization practices to address catastrophic events.
Given the substantial risk of reintroduction of the SARS-CoV-2, it is critical to reinforce balanced social distancing measures in the coming months to reduce the impact on the healthcare
system, general public, and economic prosperity. Resource limitations in a rapidly growing
pandemic demand compelling resource utilization choices. Of importance is to note that the
data-driven AI models provide a window into understanding the potential impact and should be
treated as a qualitative guidance due to the rapid changes associated with the data collection,
testing strategies, reporting, and the virus transmission.
