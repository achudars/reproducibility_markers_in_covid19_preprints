Abstract
Global coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19) caused by newly identified SARSCoV-2 coronavirus continues to claim the lives of thousands of people worldwide. The
unavailability of specific medications to treat COVID-19 has led to drug repositioning
efforts using various approaches, including computational analyses. Such analyses
mostly rely on molecular docking and require the 3D structure of the target protein to be
available. In this study, we utilized a set of machine learning algorithms and trained
them on a dataset of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitors to run
inference analyses on antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs solely based on the ligand
information. We also performed virtual screening analysis of the drug candidates
predicted by machine learning models and docked them against the active site of SARSCoV-2 RdRp, a key component of the virus replication machinery. Based on the ligand
information of RdRp inhibitors, the machine learning models were able to identify
candidates such as remdesivir and baloxavir marboxil, molecules with documented
activity against RdRp of the novel coronavirus. Among the other identified drug
candidates were beclabuvir, a non-nucleoside inhibitor of the hepatitis C virus (HCV)
RdRp enzyme, and HCV protease inhibitors paritaprevir and faldaprevir. Further
analysis of these candidates using molecular docking against the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp
revealed low binding energies against the enzyme active site. Our approach also
identified anti-inflammatory drugs lupeol, lifitegrast, antrafenine, betulinic acid, and
ursolic acid to have potential activity against SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. We propose that the
results of this study are considered for further validation as potential therapeutic options
against COVID-19.

Introduction
The global spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has
caused the COVID-19 disease pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 has a positive-sense single-strand RNA
genome [(+)ssRNA] and belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus of the Coronaviridae family within
the Nidovirales order of viruses 1. The COVID-19 disease is a potentially fatal respiratory disease
characterized by atypical pneumonia 2.

SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the receptor-binding domain on the viral spike (S) protein to bind to the
angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on host cells and enter the cells via the endosomal
pathway 3. Once inside the cells, viral genomic RNA is released, serving as a template for
translation of the viral proteins and for making copies of the viral genome. RNA dependent RNA
polymerase (RdRp), also known as non-structural protein 12 (nsp12), is a crucial component of the
viral replicase complex responsible for the production of genomic RNA for new virions 4.
Due to the central role of RdRps in the replication of RNA viruses, almost all RNA viruses have
an RdRp encoded in their genome. Despite relatively poor sequence similarity, RdRps from
different RNA viruses share structural similarity resembling a right hand with thumb, palm, and
fingers subdomains, which is also similar to reverse transcriptases. Sequence analyses of RdRps
from various viruses revealed conservation of key residues in the active sites as well as in the palm
domains 5 6 7 8. The crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp was resolved and recently reported. The
general architecture of RdRps, presence of conserved motifs A-G, conservation of key catalytic
amino acids as well as structural similarity to Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and poliovirus RdRp was
confirmed 9. RdRps are considered important therapeutic targets due to their crucial role in the viral
replication cycle and absence of a counterpart in humans, which can reduce the risk of having
undesired side effects during treatment.
A continuous global increase in the COVID-19 cases and unavailability of specific drugs against
SARS-CoV-2 urged scientists around the globe to focus on currently available drugs with safety
records. FDA urgently approved the use of Remdesivir, an RdRp inhibitor originally developed
against the Ebola virus, to treat COVID-19 patients (https://www.fda.gov/news-events/pressannouncements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-issues-emergency-use-authorization-potentialcovid-19-treatment). However, RNA viruses are known to have high rates of mutations. A recent
study identified mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp gene raising concerns about the potential
development of resistance against developed drugs 10. Thus it is important to consider the possibility
that developed treatments might become less effective with time and identify several effective drugs
against SARS-CoV-2.
Recent technological developments in the applications of machine learning to drug discovery
have shown that it is potentially possible to facilitate the conventional process and reduce the cost
for the discovery of new drugs 11 12. In this study, we implemented machine learning algorithms to
identify potential RdRp inhibitors. We trained our models on pre-clinical RdRp inhibitors with
inhibitory activity against hepatitis C virus (HCV), poliovirus, dengue virus, and influenza virus
RdRps to learn the chemical features of effective RdRp inhibitors from the ligand structures. We
then evaluated the ability of our models in identifying known pre-clinical and clinical RdRp
inhibitors. Finally, we used our models to screen approved and clinical antiviral and antiinflammatory drugs to identify potential candidates with inhibitory activity against RdRps. The
recently resolved 3D structure of novel coronavirus RdRp 9 provided us with the opportunity to
perform molecular docking analysis of the predicted drug candidates against the SARS-CoV-2
RdRp protein active site. Several molecules predicted by machine learning models also showed low
binding energies against the target RdRp when analyzed using molecular docking. Some of the
predicted molecules are currently in the clinical trials against the novel coronavirus. Our results
suggest that in addition to conventional molecular docking approaches, machine learning methods
can also be beneficial for drug repositioning purposes and help to narrow down the spectrum of
potential drug candidates especially in cases where 3D structure information of the target is not
available.

Methods
Data collection
RdRp inhibitors from PubChem 13 and ChEMBL 14 bioassays were collected in
SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) file format. Collected inhibitors targeted
HCV, poliovirus, dengue virus, and influenza virus. Entries with known experimental activity
values (IC50/EC50) were selected and assigned binary activity labels based on the activity values to
train classification models. The cutoff threshold of activity for training was set at 5µM. The final
dataset included 1356 (656 inactive, 700 active) compounds with activity labels. An equal number
of active and inactive compounds, amounting to 20% of the whole dataset, were randomly selected
and used as a validation set. The remaining 80% was used as a training set. Unusual compounds
which contained only a single atom, or no carbon atoms were removed. Additionally, a test set
containing 20 known pre-clinical RdRp inhibitors and 20 presumably unrelated molecules (mostly
kinase inhibitors) was established. This set was used to evaluate the general performance of the
trained predictive models. Finally, we collected FDA approved and clinical antiviral and antiinflammatory drugs as test sets for drug repositioning effort.

Model Training
Models utilized in this study can be grouped into 3 categories: classic models, graph-based
models, and ensemble models. Classic approaches include lasso classification, ridge classification,
support vector machines, random forest, shallow neural networks, and xgboost. For these models,
compounds in SMILES format were converted to molecular fingerprints using RdKit 15, which in
turn were used as input features. We experimented both with circular (Morgan fingerprints) 16 and
topological fingerprints. The topological fingerprints were computed by extracting all subgraphs of
a compound with a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 7 bonds. To implement the models, we
mainly relied on the scikit-learn 17 library. For graph-based models, we tried classic Graph
Convolutional Networks, Weave models, and Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNN). We
used the DeepChem library to featurize the data and to train the models. The hyperparameters used
for training are described in Appendix A1. For MPNN and Weave models, default options worked
the best. We have noticed that some of the models have low inter-correlation and are performing
well in different circumstances. As a result, using the trained classic and graph based-models, we
trained several ensemble models. That is, we combined the output of our base models and trained a
new model on top of them, aiming to achieve an overall better performance.

Molecular Docking
Docking analyses were performed using Autodock Vina (v1.1.2) 18 on the resolved crystal
structure of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp (PDB ID: 6m71) with the grid box set to the active site 9. PDB file
was converted to PDBQT file format using Aurodock Tools 19 (version 1.5.6), water molecules, and
metal ions were removed from the structure and polar hydrogens were added. 3D structures for
molecules from antiviral and anti-inflammatory sets were converted to PDBQT file format using
OpenBabel v2.4.1 20. We used the energy as a scoring function when it was possible. By default, we
used the Merck Molecular Force Field (MMFF94) 21; for a few compounds that contained boron
atoms, we used the Universal Force Field (UFF) 22. When energy minimization failed, the rootmean-square deviation (RMSD) of atomic positions was used instead.

Environment
Model training and molecular docking were performed on an NVIDIA DGX Station with 40
CPU cores and 4 V100 GPUs.

Results and Discussion
The urgent need for effective therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in numerous
studies focusing on identifying potential drug candidates. A significant amount of in silico drug
discovery reports has been published recently that propose various candidates for drug repurposing
against different protein targets of SARS-CoV-2. Most of those studies utilized conventional
molecular docking analyses for which the information on the 3D structure of the target is necessary.
Obtaining a 3D crystal structure for the target proteins is a challenging, expensive, and lengthy
process. Several artificial intelligence approaches are recently being explored as an alternative that
can help researchers find potential drug candidates in a relatively short period even in cases where
the 3D structure information is not available. Structural similarities between RdRps of several
viruses, conservation of key amino acids in the active site as well as identification of broadspectrum anti-RdRp drugs like Remdesivir indicated the potential similarity patterns in the chemical
structures of effective RdRp inhibitors. This led us to implement supervised machine learning
algorithms for the identification of potential RdRp inhibitors. We established a dataset containing
small molecules with the experimentally confirmed activity values against RNA dependent RNA
polymerases of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), Dengue virus, Poliovirus, and Influenza virus. This
dataset was used to train several classification models to be able to “learn” the chemical properties
of effective RdRp inhibitors. Several models achieved an area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve (AUROC) score of over 0.8, namely, the Graph Convolutional Network, the
Message Passing Network, the Random Forest classifier (both fingerprint types), the Ridge
classifier (with circular fingerprints), the Lasso classifier (with topological fingerprints), the 3
layered Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) (with circular fingerprints), and the XGBoost classifier (with
topological fingerprints). One of them, the Random Forest classifier on circular fingerprints even
surpassed 0.9 in terms of AUROC. In terms of accuracy, the best result of 84% was also observed
with the random forest classifier (Table 1.1).
To validate the results, we used 3 best models (based on AUROC score) to run inference on the
test set of known pre-clinical RdRp inhibitors. In addition to the AUROC and the accuracy scores,
we also report the percentage of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negative
cases. The result is described in Table 1.2.

Models like the Random Forest classifier were very good at detecting negative examples (a true
negative rate of 95%), however, the number of detected positive cases was also affected and the
model was able to detect only half of the active molecules (true positive rate of 50%). Other
models, like the Graph Convolutional Models, were able to detect more active molecules (true
positive rate of 65%), but the true negative rate dropped to 75%, and more false positives were
detected. Furthermore, the correlation between the outputs of different models was not very high
suggesting that models learned to differentiate the molecules in different ways. Therefore, we
thought that an ensemble model might improve the overall performance.

A plain Support Vector Machine with an "RBF" kernel worked the best in our experiments.
The model used the outputs of the 10 best models as input features. We first trained the individual
models on the original training set. Then, the validation set was split into 2 equal subsets; one of
them was used to train the ensemble model, while the second one was set aside as the validation set.
The ensemble model slightly outperformed all individual models on the test set (Table 1.3).

Models were evaluated based on performance on the validation set and a test set of known preclinical RdRp inhibitors. Three best performing separate models and the best ensemble model were
chosen for the inference analyses. Since only ligand information was used to train the models and
no 3D structure of the target SARS-CoV-2 RdRp was used, we wanted to compare our approach to
the conventional molecular docking approach, which is based on the 3D structure information of
protein target and ligands. We performed virtual screening of the antiviral and anti-inflammatory
datasets against the active site of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp (PDB ID: 6m71) using AutoDock Vina 18.
The results of this comparison are described in Table 1.4 and Table 1.5 for antiviral and antiinflammatory datasets, respectively.
Machine learning models utilized in this study identified several potential drug candidates from
both antiviral and anti-inflammatory datasets. As shown in Table 1.4, from the antiviral dataset
models were able to identify Remdesivir, a nucleoside analog confirmed to target SARS-CoV-2
RdRp that was recently approved by the US FDA for treatment of COVID-19 patients. Remdesivir
was included in the test set as a positive control. Interestingly, baloxavir marboxil, TMC-310911
(ASC09), and umifenovir (Arbidol) identified by our models are currently being investigated in
clinical trials for COVID-19. Clinical trial registration and identification numbers are
ChiCTR2000029544 for baloxavir marboxil, NCT04261907 for ASC09, and NCT04350684 for
umifenovir. Baloxavir marboxil acts on RdRp of Influenza virus 23, while TMC-310911 is a
protease inhibitor developed against HIV-1 24, and umifenovir is an anti-influenza drug that perturbs
virus entry into the cells by targeting hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein 25. In addition to these drug
candidates, all four of our best performing models identified beclabuvir and asunaprevir as potential
RdRp inhibitors from the antiviral dataset. Beclabuvir is a non-nucleoside inhibitor of HCV RdRp
(NS5B) 26. Similar to SARS-CoV-2, HCV is also a single-stranded enveloped positive-sense RNA
virus. The active site of both SARS-CoV-2 and HCV RdRp show a degree of structural similarity
and they both share the same conserved amino acids in the catalytic site 9. Binding energy
calculations of beclabuvir (-9.2 kcal/mol) towards SARS-CoV-2 RdRp in our experiments also
suggest the inhibitory potential of this candidate. Asunaprevir, another anti-HCV drug, is known to
target the protease of HCV. Interestingly, all of our best models identified asunaprevir as a potential
anti-RdRp candidate, but the binding energy calculation using AutoDock Vina was -7.5 kcal/mol.

Among other candidates both being predicted by at least two of our best models and having
relatively low binding energy towards SARS-CoV-2 RdRp were paritaprevir, faldaprevir,
simeprevir, vedroprevir (HCV protease inhibitors), ledipasvir, odalasvir, and velpatasvir (HCV
NS5A inhibitors). Our models were trained only on RdRp inhibitors, however, several anti-HCV
drugs targeting either protease or NS5A protein of the HCV were classified as potential RdRp
inhibitors. Interestingly, those candidate molecules also had good binding energy predictions
towards SARS-CoV-2 RdRp based on molecular docking analysis.
Effective antiviral drugs can help reduce the viral load in the patients; however, they do not
address virus-induced pneumonia directly. This pneumonia is a result of inflammation in the lungs
caused by SARS-CoV-2 27. Thus COVID-19 patients who have developed pneumonia might need
additional therapeutic intervention to suppress the inflammation in the lungs. The ability of our
models to identify RdRp inhibitors from the antiviral set motivated us to run the inference analyses
on a set of anti-inflammatory drugs. As in the analysis of the antiviral set, we focused on both RdRp
inhibitor signature and binding energy predictions against SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. Analysis of the antiinflammatory dataset revealed that all of our best models predicted betulinic acid and lupeol, both
natural products, to possess anti-RdRp activity. Lifitegrast, antrafenine, ursolic acid, dexamethasone
acetate, prednisolone phosphate were other candidates predicted by at least two of our models and
are also predicted to bind to the active site of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp with binding energy in the range
between -7.5 to -9.5 kcal/mol (Table 1.5). Interestingly, both betulinic acid and ursolic acid are
pentacyclic triterpenoids with documented antiviral activity against HIV 28.

Conclusion
In this study, we trained machine learning models on experimentally tested compounds that
target the RdRps of several viruses. Models were able to learn the chemical properties of effective
inhibitory molecules and predict small molecules with potential activity towards RdRp. Molecular
docking analysis of the predicted drug candidates against the catalytic site of the novel coronavirus
RdRp revealed low binding energies suggesting that drugs predicted using machine learning
algorithms have the potential to bind and inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp even though only ligand
information was used to train those models. We propose the identified small molecules to be
considered for experimental validations of their potential activity against SARS-CoV-2 RNAdependent RNA polymerase.
