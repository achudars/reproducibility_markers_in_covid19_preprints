Abstract
In this study, we explored how the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) affected the demand
for insurance and vaccines in Japan from mid-March to mid-April 2020. Through
independent internet surveys, respondents were asked hypothetical questions concerning
the demand for insurance and vaccines for protection against COVID-19. Using the
collected short-panel data, after controlling for individual characteristics using the fixed
effects model, the key findings, within the context of the pandemic, were as follows: (1)
Contrary to extant studies, the demand for insurance by females was smaller than that by
their male counterparts; (2) The gap in demand for insurance between genders increased
as the pandemic prevailed; (3) The demand for a vaccine by females was higher than that
for males; and (4) As COVID-19 spread throughout Japan, demand for insurance
decreased, whereas the demand for a vaccine increased.

Keywords: COVID-19; Insurance demand; Vaccine demand; Japan; Panel data.

Introduction
Since the end of 2019, society has suffered from the tremendous global impact of
the COVID-19 pandemic. Within six months, the spread of the disease changed lifestyles
and economic activities (especially in the UK, Italy, Spain, France, the US, and Asian
countries such as Japan, China, and Korea) as the number of COVID-19 victims
drastically increased.

Existing research [1-5] has found that events such as natural disasters change attitudes
and perceptions toward risk. Other studies [6-8] explored the impacts of conflicts on risk
attitude. Yamamura [9,10] found that nuclear accidents changed risk perceptions about
nuclear plants while increasing the demand for insurance [11]. Unlike natural disasters,
which are usually confined to smaller geographical areas, the impact of this pandemic on
society is predicted to differ in its extent. Extant studies have provided evidence that
females are more likely to be risk-averse [12,13]. It is valuable to investigate whether the
impact of unexpected events, such as COVID-19, affects risk attitude towards insurance
differently between genders.

Consequently, the following questions arise: First, how does COVID-19 change the
risk attitude of individuals, and second, how does the influence of COVID-19 differ

between genders? No previous research has dealt with these questions, although some
studies have analyzed the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health and perception of
individuals [14-19].
Generally, more risk-averse individuals are predicted to demand non-life insurance.
The COVID-19 pandemic creates a unique environment where the perceived value of
money might be eroded when people believe their life is in jeopardy with an increased
probability of death. Those who are more risk-averse may be less likely to demand nonlife insurance under these circumstances, while life security becomes a higher priority in
times of peril. In exploring the above inference, this study examines the impact of
COVID-19 on demand for non-life insurance and vaccines using purposefully collected
individual-level data. The panel data was constructed from three rounds of internet
surveys conducted between March 13 and April 10, and even within this limited time
frame, we could detect changes in non-life insurance and the demand for a vaccine.
Our key findings are as follows: First, the demand by females for non-life insurance
was smaller than that by their male counterparts. Second, their demand for a vaccine
against COVID-19 was higher than that of men. As COVID-19 prevailed throughout
Japan, non-life insurance demand decreased, whereas vaccine demand increased.

Materials and methods
Design of surveys
The research company INTAGE was commissioned to conduct an internet
survey for this study based on their experience and reliability. The sampling method was
designed to gather a representative sample of the Japanese population in terms of gender,
age, educational background, and residential area. Japanese citizens aged 16–79 years
from across Japan were selected for the survey. To construct the panel data, online surveys
were conducted at three separate times (“waves”) within one month, targeting the same
individuals.
The first wave of queries was conducted from March 13-16, recording 4,359
observations with a response rate of 54.7 %. The second wave was conducted from March
27-30, and the third on April 10-13. Respondents from the first wave were targeted in the
second and third waves to track and record any changes in their attitudes over time. The
second and third waves achieved response rates of 80.2% and 92.2%, respectively, from
a total of 11,867 observations.
Fig 1 illustrates the change in the total number of persons infected with COVID19 in Japan during the period from March 1 to April 20, indicating a modest increase
between the first and the second waves, with a significant increase afterward. The

Japanese Government declared a state of emergency on April 10 to cope with the surge
of infected persons. The declaration requested people to avoid leaving their homes
unnecessarily and effected the closure of public places, including schools, museums,
theaters, and bars, with the intention for this to be in effect for one month.

Measurements
Table 1 contains a description of the variables used in this paper. We
asked respondents their demand for “hypothetical non-life insurance” and
“hypothetical vaccines.” Two “hypothetical non-life insurance” options were
given: one for high probability and small associated loss (Normal Insurance
Demand) and another for low probability and large associated loss (Mega
Insurance Demand). According to basic economic theory, we expect demand to
increase with an increase in these values because respondents will be prepared
to pay more for the product.

Figs 2a, 2b, and 3 illustrate the change in non-life insurance and vaccine demand
after time has passed and compares the difference between genders. Fig 2 indicates that
Normal Insurance Demand by females is lower than that of males in waves 1-3, which is
in agreement with existing studies [12, 13]. Further, Normal Insurance Demand by
females decreased more rapidly than men as COVID-19 spread. In the first wave, there
is no statistical difference between genders; however, this changes in Waves 2 and 3. The
same trend is also observed in the case of Mega Insurance Demand.

Fig 3 demonstrates Vaccine Demand among females is larger than for men in
waves 1-3. Further, Vaccine Demand increases for both males and females as
COVID-19 spreads.

Methods
We used fixed effects model regression to control the time-invariant
individual fixed effects. The estimated function takes the following form:
Y itg =α1 Wave2t +α2 Wave3t +α3 Infected COVID-19 itg + ki + u itg,
In this formula, Y itp represents the dependent variable for individual i, wave t, and group
g. Y is Insurance demand and Vaccine demand. The second (Wave2) and third (Wave3)
wave dummies were included, with the first wave as the reference group. This approach
captures the degree of change in the dependent variables compared to the first wave. The
number of persons infected with COVID-19 was also included as a control variable.
The time-invariant individual-level fixed effects are represented by ki. As shortterm panel data was used, most of the individual-level demographic variables were
considered as time-invariant features, which were completely described by ki. The
regression parameters are denoted as α. The error term is denoted as u.

Results
Non-life insurance demand
Table 2 reflects that both Wave2 and Wave3 have mostly negative values for their
coefficients and statistical significance. In estimations of Normal Insurance Demand
using the full sample, the absolute value of the coefficients of Wave3 is 0.57, almost three
times larger than those of Wave2. This implies that non-life insurance demand decreases
at an accelerated pace. This also agrees with results where the sample is divided into male
and female sub-samples, as indicated in columns 2 and 3. The absolute values of the
coefficients based on the female sample are larger than those of the male sample. Similar
results are obtained in the estimations of the Mega Insurance Demand.

Vaccine demand
Table 3 indicates that both Wave2 and Wave3 show positive signs of their coefficient and
statistical significance. Furthermore, in the results using the full sample, the absolute
value of the coefficients of Wave3 is 0.43, almost 1.8 times larger than those of Wave2.
The absolute values of the coefficients of Wave2 and Wave3, based on female samples,
are 0.25 and 0.44, respectively, slightly larger than those based on male samples. This
also holds for results when the sample is divided into male and female sub-samples, as
presented in columns 2 and 3. Consistent with Fig 3, vaccine demand increased as
COVID-19 spread, with a higher vaccine demand amongst females than males. Jointly
analyzing Tables 2 and 3 indicates that people would reallocate their expenditure from
non-life insurance to a vaccine as people felt their lives were in danger. Further, compared
to males, females put more importance on their lives over their money.

Discussion
Individuals place more importance on their lives than their money. Individuals who
are risk-averse are more likely to avoid loss of life than loss of money as the probability
of death rises. Under the coronavirus pandemic, individuals face risk to their lives, which
is far from normal conditions. This is considered to be the reason that demand for nonlife insurance by females was smaller than demand by males, and increased as COVID19 spread. Conversely, the demand for a vaccine against COVID-19 by females was
larger than for males, and this gap increased as COVID-19 spread.
As widely acknowledged, females are more risk-averse than males. Considering that
people are in mortal danger, females, when compared to males, more readily allocate their
money to the vaccine than to non-life insurance.
