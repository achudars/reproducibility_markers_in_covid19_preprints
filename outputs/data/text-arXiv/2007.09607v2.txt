ABSTRACT
The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is spreading rapidly throughout the world, causing
many deaths and severe economic damage. It is believed that hot and humid conditions do not favor the novel coronavirus,
yet this is still under debate due to many uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 data. Here we propose surrogate data
tests to examine the preference of this virus to spread under different climate conditions. We find, by mainly studying the
relative number of COVID-19 deaths, that the disease is significantly (above the 95% confidence level) more common when the
temperature is ∼10◦ C, the relative humidity is ∼60%, the specific humidity is ∼5 g/kg, and the ultraviolet (UV) radiation is ∼80
kJ/m2 . The results are supported using global and regional data, spanning the time period from January to August 2020. The
COVID-19 data includes the daily reported new cases and daily death cases; for both, the population size is either taken into
account or ignored.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has quickly spread throughout the entire world, with a high cost in lives and severe economic damage.
As of September 2, 2020, the novel coronavirus has infected over 26 million people (confirmed cases) and caused 0.86 million
deaths globally. Since the disease mainly spreads by human breath through air droplets, and with the current lack of a vaccine
or effective treatments, the main practices to prevent the spread of COVID-19 include social distancing, sanitation, masks, and
reducing human mobility by adopting quarantine policies. However, full mobility limitations in an entire country can only be
made for short periods, mainly due to high economic costs1, 2 .
The patterns of human mobility and their effect on the spread of COVID-19 have been studied for the initial stage of the
pandemic5 . In the early stage of the virus’s spread in China, it seemed as if the spread could be solely explained by the mobility
patterns; i.e., Lévy flight6 patterns. These patterns are characterized by many short movements, together with a few very
long range movements according to a power law distribution. Yet, human mobility patterns alone cannot explain the virus’s
continued spread to other regions around the globe.
This is mainly because the spread of the virus is not evenly distributed in different countries and does not follow the
distribution of population around the globe. This mismatch can be easily seen by comparing the population distribution to the
distribution of the COVID-19 (infected and death) cases (Fig. 1a). This can also be seen by plotting the number of COVID-19
cases versus population (Fig. 1b)—while there is a general increase in COVID-19 cases as a function of population size, the
range of (infected and death) cases spans several orders of magnitude, indicating a mismatch between the population size and
COVID-19 spread. Moreover, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases is not closely related to the number of COVID-19
deaths as can be clearly seen from spread of points between the two dashed lines in Fig. 1c, covering more than one order of
magnitude. This large spread is probably due to biases associated, for example, with in the number of COVID-19 tests which
vary with time and from one country to another.
One possible explanation for the mismatch between COVID-19 cases and population is related to atmospheric conditions,
about which there is an intense debate7–10 . It is apparent that most of the northern hemisphere (NH) countries have passed the
first wave of the disease and are currently recovering from COVID-19 spread (Fig. 1e,g), as they progress through the NH
summer (Fig. 1i), while southern hemisphere (SH) countries experienced a delayed burst of COVID-19 (Fig. 1d,f) with an
increasing number of COVID-19 cases during the SH winter. This suggests a possible link between temperature (and other
climate variables) and the spread of COVID-19. Yet, there are counterexamples in both hemispheres (e.g., India in the NH and
Australia in the SH), which complicate the study of the correlation between climate variables and the spread of COVID-19.

Figure 1. World population, COVID-19 cases, and temperature. (a) The distribution of the world’s population (blue),
total COVID-19 infected cases (red), and total COVID-19 death cases (orange) by latitude. (b) Total number of COVID-19
infected cases (blue) and death cases (red) versus population. The dashed lines are reference lines of slope 1 indicating the 1%
(upper line) and 10−4 % (lower line) percentages, and the dotted line indicates the 70% herd immunity value. Note the
mismatch between the population and COVID-19 cases, suggesting that additional factors other than population size are
affecting the disease spread. (c) COVID-19 death cases versus COVID-19 infected cases. The dashed lines are reference lines
of slope 1 indicating the 10% (upper line) and 1% (lower line) percentages. Note the large spread between the two, covering
more than 1 order of magnitude. (d-e) One-week moving average of new daily COVID-19 infected cases as a function of time
(22/1/2020 to 22/8/2020) in countries from (d) the southern hemisphere (SH) and (e) the northern hemisphere (NH). (f-g) Same
as (d-e) for the new death cases. (h-i) The corresponding one-week moving average of surface air daily mean temperatures of
the countries plotted in panels d and e. It is apparent that in the NH (panels e,g, and i), the number of new COVID-19 cases
usually decreases as the temperature increases, while the opposite occurs in the SH (panels d,f and h). Yet, there are
counterexamples in both hemispheres, (e.g., Australia in the SH and India in the NH), indicating a non-trivial relation between
the spread of COVID-19 and temperature. We show a sample of countries in which the population is higher than 1 million and
the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases is larger than 10,000. The temperature data is obtained from the ERA5 reanalysis3, 4 .

It has been shown11 that high temperatures (>38 ◦ C) and high relative humidity (> 95%) disrupt SARS-CoV viability and
activation. It is also known that other types of viruses, such as influenza, have higher activation levels in colder weather; the
reason for this, however, is still under debate12, 13 . Currently, during the NH summer, it seems that the seasonal cycle does not
2/15

affect COVID-19 in the way it affects influenza.
The effect of the atmospheric conditions on COVID-19 spread is still under debate. The origin of this debate is related to
many biases in the COVID-19 data, which make it very difficult to compare one place to another. The biases include different
healthcare capabilities in different countries, different numbers of COVID-19 tests administered in different countries and
different time, partial or possibly intentionally incorrect information published by some countries, different age pyramids, and
different countermeasures and human mobility restrictions. Moreover, some studies reported a high COVID-19 replication rate
under colder conditions7 , while other studies claimed that infection rates increase only with temperature and are negatively
correlated with humidity8 . Similarly, a study of 429 cities in China10 found an increased risk of spread in a narrow temperature
range and that both high and low humidity rates are associated with higher reproduction rates9 .
Most of the studies on the effect of climate conditions on the spread of COVID-19 have concentrated on temperature and
humidity and are mainly on limited regional scale. However, UV radiation has received much less attention. First, we note that
the virus causing COVID-19 can live for almost three days on surfaces14 and also that other corona-viruses are highly sensitive
to UV light15, 16 . Artificial disinfection by UV light takes about 15 minutes, and UV radiation is commonly used as a germicidal
disinfectant, both directly and indirectly. For example, experiments investigating the effectiveness of non-direct artificial UV
lights that were installed in hospital rooms reported a reduction in tuberculosis of almost 80%17 . While most artificial UV
disinfection lights range from 250–305 nm18–22 and 250 nm wavelengths barely reach ground level, the effectiveness of virus
disinfection by longer wavelength UV lights (that do reach ground level and penetrate the atmosphere) is proven by SODIS
(SOlar water DISinfection)23–26 . This method of water disinfection is effectively used to disinfect water against the rhinovirus
(common cold), polio virus, and norovirus. It is used in the developing world daily, for water purification, in more than 2 M
houses. In contrast to the 15-minute disinfection period, it disinfects water by exposing it to UV from the sun for over 12 hours.
Indeed, a recent modeling study suggested reduced COVID-19 infection during the summer due to the relatively high sunlight
UV radiation at ground level27 .
Following the above summary, the goal of this study is to quantify the effects and significance of climate variables
(temperature, specific and relative humidity, and UV radiation) on the spread of COVID-19, using surrogate data tests. The
proposed tests are based on a random shuffling of climate records from different locations on the globe and a comparison of
the shuffled data to the original data (e.g., relative number of COVID-19 death cases). For more details, see the Materials
and Methods section below. We applied the tests to both global data and data from individual regions. Our results indicate a
significantly high number of COVID-19 cases (above the 95% confidence level of the shuffled surrogate control) when the
temperature is about 10◦ C, the relative humidity is ∼60% the specific humidity is ∼5 g/kg, and the UV radiation is ∼ 80 kJ/m2 .

Results
We summarize the main results in Fig. 2 where we plot the probability density function (pdf) of the relative number of
COVID-19 death cases (i.e., number of death cases per thousand) as a function of temperature (first column), relative humidity
(second column), specific humidity (third column), and UV radiation (forth column). The different geographic regions include
the entire globe (first row), the globe excluding the US (second row), and North-America (third row). We used the daily mean
climate data of a 14-day backward mean. The results are consistent over the different regions and suggest a preference for spread
in a relatively narrow range of specific humidity. The maximum of the probability density is well above the 95% confidence
level for a relatively low temperature (around 10◦ C) and low humidity (around 60% relative humidity and 5 g/kg specific
humidity). In some cases, it is below the 5% confidence level for higher temperature and higher (relative and specific) humidity.
One possible explanation for the cold and dry weather preference may be the virus’s poor viability in higher temperatures and
humidity. As shown in ref.11 , SARS-CoV’s survival and activation levels in high temperatures and high humidity are also poor.
Another explanation for the cold/winter weather preference may be the relatively lower levels of UV radiation from the sun
during this season.
The analysis of UV radiation is shown in the fourth column of Fig. 2 and indicates that the number of COVID-19 relative
death cases is above the 95% confidence level when the UV radiation is ∼80 kJ/m2 . Since the virus lives on steel and plastic
surfaces for several days14, 28, 29 , it is possible that sites with lower UV radiation levels will suffer from a longer survival time
of the virus on surfaces, leading to higher infection rates. Also, vitamin D, which is needed for the activation of the lungs’
immune system, requires UV light for its formation; thus, lower exposures to UV radiation30 may reduce its production. Our
results support the modeling study of ref.27 .
The saturated water vapor pressure can be determined by using the Clausius–Clapeyron relation31 . This relation yields an
exponential relation between the air temperature and the saturated water vapor pressure. The specific humidity is a measure for
the amount of water vapor in the air (e.g., in grams of water vapor per kg of air) while the relative humidity is the ratio between
the measured specific humidity and the maximum specific humidity. It turns out that the relative humidity exhibits weak (if at
all) seasonality such that the specific humidity is expected to have seasonal cycle with higher value during the hot season.

Figure 2. The real and surrogate data pdfs of COVID-19 relative deaths cases as a function of temperature, T ,
relative humidity, r, specific humidity, q, and UV radiation. The different rows depict the results of different regions as
follows: (a-d) global, (e-h) global excluding US, and (i-l) North-America. Columns (from left to right) present the pdf versus
temperature, relative humidity, specific humidity, and UV radiation. The blue curves depict the number of daily confirmed new
COVID-19 cases recorded over the period of 23/1/20–15/8/20 as a function of seven-day lagged daily mean climate variables.
The figure also depicts the corresponding distributions of the shuffled (location) surrogate data where the median (solid black
line) and the 5-95% confidence interval (shaded gray area) are plotted. Importantly, the peaks for temperature around 10◦ C and
specific humidity around 5 g/kg are significant, falling well above the 95% surrogate level, suggesting that the COVID-19 virus
has a tendency to be more effective at these temperature and specific humidity values. The title in each panel indicates the
values of the separation measures between the original data pdf and the surrogate data pdf: M: maximum probability difference
between the pdfs; A: the area between the original pdf (blue curve) and the confidence interval of the surrogate data pdfs (gray
area); and O: the 1 minus overlap between the original pdf and the mean pdf of the surrogate data. The larger the separation
value (of all measures), the greater the separation.

Fig. 3 shows the evolution with time of the pdfs of the temperature, relative and specific humidity, and UV radiation. The
daily mean values with the 14-day backward mean are used. The preference of COVID-19 for a specific temperature and
humidity can be also seen in Fig. 3. The upper panels present the (weekly) pdfs of temperature, humidity, and UV radiation in
the locations of the reported COVID-19 cases, where the relative number of death cases is not taken into account. The seasonal
trend toward warmer, more humid, and higher UV radiation levels is clearly seen. This is expected as the majority of the
COVID-19 cases were reported in the NH such that the seasonal trend reflects the NH winter to summer trend. In comparison,
the lower panels of Fig. 3 present the weekly pdfs of COVID-19 relative death cases as a function of temperature, relative and
specific humidity, and UV radiation. In contrast to the top panels, the COVID-19 pdfs are more skewed with a single narrow
maximum that follows, to some extent, the seasonal trends shown in the upper panels. We note that the relative humidity does
not exhibit a clear seasonal trend. The pdf of COVID-19 relative death cases as a function of temperature peaks around 10◦ C at
the first part of the pandemic and then switches to ∼25◦ C toward the NH summer, mainly as a result of the late COVID-19
burst in India and Brazil. The situation is somehow similar for the specific humidity which peaks around 5 g/kg at the first part

relative humidity, specific humidity, and UV radiation as a function of time (1/23/20–15/8/20), based on the reported locations
of COVID-19 death cases around the world. The number of cases is not taken into account here so that the results reflect the
changes in temporal atmospheric variables from mainly NH winter conditions (as most of the locations of the COVID-19 cases
are from the NH) to mainly NH summer conditions. This seasonal trend is seen in (a), (c), and (d) but is most clearly reflected
in the UV radiation (panel d), which increases toward the NH summer solstice and decrease afterward. The relative humidity
does not exhibit seasonal trend. Lower panels: Pdfs (colors) of COVID-19 relative death cases versus time and temperature,

of the pandemic. The transition from the first part of the pandemic to the second part can also be seen by comparing the pdfs of
the first three months of the COVID-19 pandemic (23/1/2020 to 22/4/2020) to the last three months (16/5/2020 to 15/8/2020)
where the preferred temperature of 10◦ C and the preferred specific humidity of 5 g/kg is clear in the first period but not in the
second period (Figs. S3, S4).
To strengthen the results reported above of enhanced COVID-19 spread for a preferred temperature, relative humidity,
specific humidity and UV radiation, we also analyzed the relative number of COVID-19 confirmed cases. The results are shown
in Fig. 4 and exhibit similar results as for the relative number of COVID-19 death cases seen in Fig. 2. Yet, the confirmed cases
results are less significant, probably due to biases associated with the number of tests which become more available with time.
The results described above are based on the relative number of COVID-19 deaths and confirmed cases, i.e., the number
of COVID-19 cases divided by the size of population. The normalization by population aims in taking into account, very
roughly, the population density. Still, it is interesting also to check the results without the normalization by the population
size, as clearly in most countries the situation is far from the herd community ratio (see Fig. 1a). The results are shown in Fig.
S1 and are similar to the results when the normalization by population is performed (Fig. 2). This strengthen our conclusion
regarding the preference of the COVID-19 virus to develop under cold and dry conditions. We also analyzed the number of
confirmed COVID-19 cases without normalization by population and here there is no significant preference to specific value of
temperature and humidity (Fig. S2). This is probably due to the biases associated with the number of COVID-19 tests versus
time.
In addition to the surrogate method presented here, we performed two other surrogate data tests to support the effect of
climate variables on the spread of COVID-19; for more details, see the Materials and Methods section. In the first surrogate
test, we randomly chose the longitudes (over land) but kept the original latitudes of the COVID-19 cases. This aims to find
a possible preference of COVID-19 for specific climate conditions, while keeping the seasonality (as the original latitude is
maintained). In the second, additional, surrogate approach, both the longitudes and latitudes were chosen randomly where the

Figure 4. Results of COVID-19 infected cases. Same as Fig. 2 for the relative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Here
we consider the daily mean values with a 7-day backward mean. The results show similar preferences as those of Fig. 2.

random locations are evenly distributed over land. This aims to test the spread of COVID-19 with respect to global (continental)
mean climate conditions. The results of these methods are shown in the SI (Figs. S5,S6) and indicate that COVID-19 spread is
affected by temperature, relative and specific humidity, and UV radiation, supporting the results reported above.

Discussion
The fast spread of COVID-19 has resulted in a global turbulence of fear, uncertainty, and social distress. In some countries,
severe quarantine restrictions were imposed, changing people’s lives entirely. Then, the restrictions were slowly removed.
Yet, even the most infected places in the world are far from reaching the herd immunity percentage32, 33 ; see the dotted line
of Fig. 1b. While it is clear that the most effective strategy to fight the spread of COVID-19 is quarantine restrictions, our
results indicate that high temperature, high specific humidity, and high UV radiation can slowdown the spread of the disease.
Our results might explain the delayed burst of COVID-19 in some warm climate countries and SH countries which entered
the winter when the NH entered the summer. We conjecture that the situation could have been much worse if the climate in
countries such as India and Brazil, which experienced late bursts of COVID-19, was colder and drier. Moreover, it is plausible
that the climate, which is warmer humid during the NH summer, helped to cope with the pandemic in many places. If our
conjectures are correct, the spread of COVID-19 will be enhanced toward the next NH winter in the absence of effective
medication or vaccine.
The implications of our results demand attention. In the current period in the month of September it seems as though
most NH countries already exit the first wave of the pandemic while some countries experience now the second wave of the
pandemic; the most infected country, the USA, is still in the midst of its fight. In contrast, SH countries (excluding, e.g., New
Zealand) are manifesting a growth in their infection curve (see Fig. 1). We suggest that since the SH countries are now in
winter, COVID-19 spreads more easily due to the lower temperatures and lower UV radiation.

Data and Methods
We extracted climate variables from the ERA5 reanalysis database3, 4 ; ERA5 is a high spatial (1/4 of a degree) and temporal
(hourly) resolution database that includes many multi-level climate variables. We focus on surface level data of 2 m temperature,
downward UV radiation (in the range of 200–440 nm) at the surface, and 1000 hPa relative and specific humidity. We tested
whether these climate variables can be associated with the spread of COVID-19. We used the hourly data to extract the daily
mean and daily maximum values of the different climate variables.
The COVID-19 data is obtained from the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 GitHub repository34 , and the demographic data is
obtained from35 . The COVID-19 data includes the number of confirmed cases, the number of active cases, the number of
severe cases, the number of deaths, and more. Here, we focused on the daily deaths and the number daily confirmed new cases.
We used the daily deaths, along with the daily confirmed cases, since presumably there are infected people that are not tested,
but this happens less often for deaths. Furthermore, the number of tests differ between developed and developing countries,
affecting the reported number of infections, while the number of deaths is not subject to this bias. The data is provided for the
entire country (e.g., Germany and Italy), for different provinces and regions within a country (e.g., UK, Canada, China, and
Australia), and for cities within a country (such as the US). We used the regional COVID-19 data when possible.
We mainly analyzed the “normalized” number of death cases by considering the number of cases per 1000 inhabitants. We
concentrated on countries/states/provinces whose population is larger than half a million. The population normalization was
performed in order to filter out the population size effect, and we found results that are similar to the results without population
normalization; see Figs. 2, S1. In addition to the analysis of daily new COVID-19 death cases, we also considered the number
of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases.
The different climate variables were interpolated to the reported locations of COVID-19 cases. Then, for each location
and date, we calculated the past d-day mean (either of the daily mean or daily maximum) and the d-day lag values of the
climate variables. The rationale behind the d-day mean operation is that new COVID-19 death cases may occur after a variable
number of days, somewhere between a few days (from the infection time) to more than one month–the mean operation crudely
reflects this temporal spread. The d-day lag operation aims to examine the other extreme, unrealistic alternative in which new
COVID-19 death cases occur after a fixed number of days after the infection. The daily-mean and daily-max procedures aim to
test whether the extreme values of temperature/humidity/UV affect the virus spread or the accumulated daily value (which is
reflected by the mean operation). We examined different time lags and temporal mean periods and found a typical span time of
14 days (not shown). The typical span time for the number of confirmed cases is seven days. Generally speaking, the daily
mean d-days mean procedure yielded the best results.
We developed surrogate data tests (inspired by ref.36 ) to study whether COVID-19 spread favors a certain range of climate
attributes. The common practice is to assume a NULL hypothesis and to design statistical tests that will either falsify or confirm
this hypothesis. In our case, the NULL hypothesis is that the climate attributes are not related to COVID-19 spread. If this is
indeed the case, the spread should not be affected by the climate conditions of a certain location. Thus, we shuffled the locations
of the reported COVID-19 cases, keeping the time series of the cases unaffected but using the climate data of other random
locations. The shuffling operation can be repeated many times. If the NULL hypothesis is valid, the resulting distribution
of the shuffled data should be similar to the distribution of the original data. If it is significantly different than the original
distribution, the NULL hypothesis is rejected, and the climate variable is proven (to a certain confidence level) to affect the
spread of COVID-19.
We proposed and implemented three methods to generate random locations of COVID-19 cases. In the first method
discussed above, the reported locations of the virus cases were shuffled, i.e., we analyzed the number of COVID-19 cases that
were recorded in a particular location, with climatic records from a different, randomly selected location, from the list of the
locations of reported cases; see Fig. 2. In the second method (see Figs. S5 of the SI), we randomly chose the longitude of the
reported COVID-19 locations but kept the latitude; the random longitudes were restricted to be over land. In this way, we kept
the original seasonality, yet studied the sensitivity of the results to the climate variability along the original latitude. In the third
method, we randomly chose both the longitude and latitude and used the climate records of the random locations instead of the
climate records of the original locations. The new random locations were chosen to be evenly distributed over land.
We constructed the probability density function (pdf) of the COVID-19 cases using the various climate variables; see Fig. 2.
Then, the pdf of the original data was compared to the pdf of the surrogate data. We generated 200 surrogate time series for
each reported COVID-19 location and then estimated the 5% and 95% confidence level. High separation between the pdf of the
real data and the pdf of the surrogate data implies a higher dependency of COVID-19 on the climatic variables. We quantified
the dissimilarity between the pdfs of the real data and the surrogate data in three ways: (a) the maximum probability difference
between the real data pdf and the 95% confidence level of the surrogate data pdf, (b) 1 minus the overlapping area between the
original data pdf and the mean pdf of the surrogate data, and (c) the sum of the areas that are bounded between the original data
pdf and the 5% and 95% confidence level of the surrogate data pdfs (i.e., the area between the blue curve in Fig. 2 and the
shaded gray area). We use the letters “M,” “O,” and “A,” respectively, to refer to these three separation measures. The larger the
7/15

separation value (of all measures), the greater the separation.
