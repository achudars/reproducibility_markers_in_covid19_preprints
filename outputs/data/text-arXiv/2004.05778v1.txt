Based on the classical SIR model, we derive a simple modification for the dynamics of epidemics
with a known incubation period of infection. The model is described by a system of integrodifferential equations. Parameters of our model directly related to epidemiological data. We derive
some analytical results, as well as perform numerical simulations. We use the proposed model to
analyze COVID-19 epidemic data in Armenia. We propose a strategy: organize a quarantine, and
then conduct extensive testing of risk groups during the quarantine, evaluating the percentage of
the population among risk groups and people with symptoms.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Mathematical modeling for epidemiology has a rather
long history, dating back to the studies by D. Bernoulli
[1]. Later, Kermack and McKendrick [2] proposed their
prominent theory for infectious disease dynamics, which
influenced the following SIR and related models. By the
end of the last century, significant progress in the field
was made (a systematic literature review for this period is
presented in Anderson and May’s book [3]). The COVID19 pandemic has drawn the attention of researchers from
all over the world and different areas to epidemic modeling. One of the simplest SIR models for the virus spread
in Northern Italy was introduced in [4]. Another research
group used the logistic equation to analyze empirical data
on the epidemic in different states [11].
Here, we mainly focus on mean-field models that discard the spatial dependence of the epidemic process.
Therefore, we avoid network models of epidemics. Moreover, it is crucial to consider the final incubation period of
the disease to construct a correct model for the COVID19 case. Taking into account this distinctive feature, we
consider the dynamics of the aged-structured population,
which a well-known problem in evolutionary research [5]
- [10]. Generally, epidemic models have a higher order of
non-linearity than evolutionary models, although there
are some similarities between these two classes.
In this study, we derive a system of integro-differential
equations based on the rigorous master equation that adequately describes infection dynamics with an incubation
period, e.g., COVID-19. First, we discuss the SIR model.
Then, we move on to its modification and apply it to the
data on the COVID-19 epidemic in Armenia.
Consider the SIR model where the parameter S stands
for the number of susceptible people, I for the number of
infected people, and R for the number of people who have
recovered and developed immunity to the infection. We

assume that S, I, R satisfy the constraint S + I + R = N .

where 1/b is the period when the infected people are contagious.
The parameter a can be obtained from the empirical
data on infection rate:
α
a= ,
N
(2)
N = S + I + R.
Thus, we assume that a healthy person is infected with
a probability proportional to the fraction of infection in
the population. Probability is also proportional to the
population density.
One of the most widely discussed and crucial parameters in epidemiological data is the basic reproduction
number of the infection:
α
R0 = .
(3)
b
For the COVID-19, it has been estimated as [4]:
2 < R0 < 4
In fact, the real data allows us to measure three main
parameters: the exponential growth coefficient at the beginning of the epidemic; the minimum period of time, in
which an infected person can transmit the infection; and
the maximum period, when an infected person ceases to
transmit the infection.
The most important objectives of the investigation are
the maximal possible proportion of the infected population, and then the period before the peak of the epidemic.

SIR MODEL WITH INCUBATION PERIOD

Consider the spread of infectious diseases with a recovery period up to T days. At the t-th moment of time,

2
we have S(t) for the size of the susceptible population,
R(t) for the recovered population. We divide the infected
population according to the age of infection, looking at
time intervals δ and defining Il (t) as the number of infected people with the age of infection in (lδ, (l+1)δ). We
assume that the incubation period for a random infected
person is L and the infection spreads from L to T days.
Below, we take δ → 0 for the continuous mode of time
limit.
Assuming that the spread of infection has a rate a, we
obtain the following system of equations:
(S(t + δ) − S(t)) /δ = −aS(t)

We suggested that after T days a person recovers and
the patients are not isolated from the rest of the population between days L and T . Eq. (4) describes the
dynamics of the population over discrete time, which is
the right choice for numerical simulation.
Consider now the continuous-time version of the
model. In the limit of small δ, we introduce the continuous function Il (t) = I(x, t), where δI(x, t) is the size
of the infected population with age x, x + δ. The continuous time versions for the first three equations are:

For increasing α, we get an increasing value of k as well.
In the SIR model the epidemic threshold is at R = 1 or
a = b, so our model is similar to SIR with b = 1/(T − L).
In Fig 1., we analyze the epidemiological data for
COVID-19 in Armenia using our model. We examine the
dynamics of infected population in Armenia from March
25, when the quarantine in the country has been introduced by the government, until April 5.

GENERAL CASE OF OUR MODEL

Let us consider the case, when the infectivity (the ability to transfer the infection to susceptible individuals) of

3
infected individuals depends on the age of infection (via
a kernel f (x)), also the population with the age x is diluted with the rate g(x). The latter seems to be a reasonable assumption, since an infected individual with a
large age reveals some symptoms of infection, therefore,
has chances to be isolated. Now Eq. (4) is modified:
(S(t + δ) − S(t))/δ = −aS(t)

ARMENIAN CASE

We now apply the generalized version of the model to
the epidemics in Armenia. We look at two periods of
epidemics: the first period from March 24 to April 5 and
the later (second period), when quarantine starts to work
efficiently.

The specific functions g(x)

Let us analyze our Eq. (16). If we are trying to reduce
the growth rate k, it can be done in two ways:
1. reducing the number of contacts, A,
2. increasing the g(x) via containment activities.

The parameter A in our model is proportional to the
number of human contacts during the day. In the first
time period, we have had a = 0.235, k = 0.088. After the
quarantine in Armenia, k decreased from the value 0.088
till the value 0.031, with a = 0.135. The critical value
of A to eliminate the epidemics is a = 0.1. We reduced
43% of human contacts. The reducing further 26% of
remaining contacts, we can eliminate the epidemics.
Let’s evaluate what degree of g we need to eliminate
the epidemic at given values ofA, if we attribute the current situation to g = 0. For the case of quarantine,
we take the current value k = 0.031, then we see that
g = 0.035 eliminates epidemics.
The parameter A in our model is proportional to the
number of human contacts during the day. In the first
period of epidemics, we had a = 0.235, k = 0.088. After
quarantine in Armenia, k decreased from 0.088 to 0.031,
with a = 0.135. The critical value of A for the elimination
of epidemics is A = 0.1. We have reduced 43% of human
contacts. A further reduction of 26% of the remaining
contacts, we can eliminate the epidemic.

In this paper, we introduced a version of SIR model
for infection spreading with known incubation period.
This model was applied to analyze the COVID-19 epidemic data in Armenia. We constructed the simplest
version of population dynamics of age-structured population. Close work has been done in [13], which is related

to SIR model. In [13], a temporal kernel F (t) has been
introduced that modulates the infectivity of each infected
individual. Compared to such model, we introduced the
distribution of infected population at given moment of
time via an age of infection, instead of looking just long
history of focus populations. In other works related to
the population dynamics of age-structured population,
the differential equations with time delay usually have
been considered. Instead, we use integro-differential system of equations, which seems to be an adequate approach to the current situation with COVID-19 epidemic.
From our perspective, the proposed approach significantly changes the epidemiological picture (compare to
classical SIR models), since the virus is active for about
two weeks. Next, we introduced two functions: f (x),
which describes the distribution of infectivity by age, and
g(x), which describes the content measures. In the normal SIR model, we have two parameters for the rate of
infection and the removal of infections. In our integrodifferential model, mapping to elementary processes is
straightforward: we just need the velocity parameter a
and two periods: the incubation period L and recovery
period T with symptoms after the carrier is separated
from society. We derive an analytical result for exponential growth in the early stages of epidemics, as well as
for the epidemic threshold. It will be very interesting to
investigate the transitional situation near the threshold.
We suggest simply making numbers and choosing a parameter value to match the correct exponential growth.
We applied our model to understand the situation with
epidemics in Armenia. What is advantageous in our
model, that we can clearly separate two aspects of the
epidemic: contact strength (through coefficient A) and
deterrence measures through parameter g. We check that
in fact we need to make minimal efforts to stop the epidemics, and testing is much cheaper during quarantine.
Currently, if we detect only 3.5% of the infected population per day, strictly monitoring the symptoms, we
can stop the epidemic. This is much more complicated
without quarantine.

A = 0.2 during the second period and we need A = 0.151
to eliminate the epidemic. Due to the quarantine, we reduced 40% of contacts, we now needs in reducing of 25%
of existing contacts. Holding current values of contacts,
we need rising the value of g from 0.05 to 0.09.
We verified that taking g = 0.15 before the quarantine
does not give adequate results. How can we increase g in
practice? Testing the 20% per week in high risk groups
of the population, we can eliminate the epidemics.
