INTRODUCTION

Coronaviruses is related to illness that vary from a common cold to more severe diseases
related to respiratory syndromes. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was discovered in
2019, the first time identified in humans. It is zoonotic, which means that it is transmitted
among animals and humans. In January 21, 2019, World Health Organization (WHO)
published the first Situation Report about the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). It announces to
the world the origin of the COVID-19, reporting cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology
detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China. Afterward, the situation evolves to a huge
global crisis with severe effects in Italy, Iran, Spain, South Korea and all over the world. In 11
March 2020, WHO declared that COVID-19 can be characterized as pandemic.

This dramatic situation points that all tools can be useful to define the best strategies for
the public health system. In this regard, mathematical modeling is an interesting approach that
can allow the evaluation of different scenarios, furnishing information for a proper support for
health system decisions. In general, nonlinear dynamics of biological and biomedical systems
is the objective of several researches that can be based on mathematical modeling or time series
analysis (Savi, 2005). In particular, coronavirus propagation can be described by a
mathematical model that allows the nonlinear dynamics analysis, representing different
populations related to the phenomenon.
Literature presents some examples related to the dynamics of infectious diseases.
Different kinds of models can be employed, essentially considering nonlinear governing
equations. Rihan et al. (2018) described the dynamics of coronavirus infection in human,
establishing interaction among human cells and the virus.
Chen et al. (2020) developed a mathematical model for calculating the transmissibility
of the virus considering a simplified version of the bats-hosts-reservoir-people transmission
model, defined as a reservoir-people model. Results follow the general trend of the initial
propagation. Li et al. (2020) estimated characteristics of the epidemiologic time distribution,
exploiting some pattern trends of transmission propagation. Riou & Althaus (2020) exploited
the pattern of human-to-human transmission of novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China. Two key
parameters are considered: basic reproduction number that defines the infectious propagation;
and the individual variation in the number of secondary cases. Uncertainty quantification tools
were employed to define the transmission patterns.
Susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) models are an interesting approach to
deal with the mathematical modeling of coronavirus transmission. Wu et al. (2020)
investigated Wuhan – China case, evaluating nowcasting and forecasting domestic and
international spread outbreak. Lin et al. (2020) proposed a model considering individual
reaction, governmental action and emigration. The model is based on the original work of He
et al. (2013) that proposed a model to describe the 1918 influenza.
The mathematical model proposed by Lin et al. (2020) seems to be capable to capture
the general propagation of the novel coronavirus, being employed in this work to evaluate
different scenarios of the propagation of coronavirus in Brazil. Initially, a model verification is
carried out considering infected population evolution of China, Italy, Iran and Brazil.
Afterward, Brazilian COVID-19 evolution is investigated, simulating different scenarios
defined based on governmental and individual reactions.

MATHEMATICAL MODEL

A frame-by-frame description of the reality can be represented by a set of differential
equations. By assuming only time evolution of state variables, 𝑥 ∈ ℜ𝑛 , spatial aspects are not
of concern, allowing to establish a governing equation of the form: 𝑥̇ = 𝑓(𝑥), 𝑥 ∈ ℜ𝑛 . The
description of coronavirus disease 2019 dynamics defines its propagation considering animals
and humans transmission. Different kinds of populations need to be defined in order to have a
proper scenario of the disease propagation.
Lin et al. (2020) proposes a susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR)
framework model to describe the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This model was
inspired on the original model of He et al. (2013) for influenza. Essentially, the description
considers a total population of size N that contains two classes: D is a public perception of risk
regarding severe cases and deaths; and C represents the cumulative infected cases. In addition,
S is the susceptible population, E is the exposed population, I is the infectious population and
R is the removed population that includes both recovered and deaths. A simplified version of
the model considers only person-to-person transmission, and therefore, zoonotic effect is
neglected. This scenario assumes the second stage of the Wuhan – China case, after the close
of the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. Emigration effect is also neglected in order to
simplify the original model. Therefore, the simplified version of the governing equations
considers the interaction among all these populations, being expressed by the following set of
differential equations
𝑆̇ = −𝛽
𝐸̇ = 𝛽

𝑆𝐼
𝑁

(1)

𝑆𝐼
− 𝜎𝐸
𝑁

(2)

𝐼 ̇ = 𝜎𝐸 − 𝛾𝐼

(3)

𝑅̇ = 𝛾𝑅 𝐼

(4)

𝐷̇ = 𝑑𝛾𝐼 − 𝜆𝐷

(5)

𝐶̇ = 𝜎𝐸

(6)

where the following parameters are defined: 𝛾 is the mean infectious period; 𝛾𝑅 is the adjusted
removed period, defining the relation between removed population and the infected one; 𝜎 is
the mean latent period; 𝑑 is the proportion of severe cases; 𝜆 is the mean duration of public
reaction. It should be pointed out that the parameter 𝛾 − 𝛾𝑅 defines the evolution of the

3

nonreported removed population, which means that, if 𝛾 = 𝛾𝑅 , populations are restricted to
the classical SEIR case.
The function 𝛽 = 𝛽(𝑡) represents the transmission rate that considers governmental
action, represented by (1 − 𝛼); and the individual action, represented by the function
𝐷 𝜅

(1 − 𝑁) . Therefore, the transmission rate is modeled as follows,
𝛽 = 𝛽(𝑡) = 𝛽̂0 (1 − 𝛼̂)𝛿

(7)

(𝑖)
(𝑖)
(𝑖)
where 𝛽̂0 = 𝛽0 𝐻 (𝑡 − 𝑇𝛽0 ) represents the nominal transmission rate and 𝐻 (𝑡 − 𝑇𝛽0 ) is a

step function with the form illustrated in Figure 1. Its use is convenient in order to contemplate
variations of the transmission rate through time, being defined as follows.

Note that, it is assumed that if 𝑇𝛽0

(𝑚+1)

does not exist, the term 𝛽0

does not exist as

well, considering that index m is bigger than 1. Based on that, this general function can
represent constant values, or different step functions.
Using the same strategy, it is defined the governmental action as follows:

4

(𝑖)

𝛼̂ = 𝛼𝑖 𝐻(𝑡 − 𝑇𝐺𝑜𝑣 )

(9)
(𝑖)

where different steps are considered defined by time instants 𝑇𝐺𝑜𝑣 .
In addition, individual action is represented by
𝐷 𝜅
𝛿 = (1 − )
𝑁

(10)

which the intensity of responses is defined by parameter 𝜅. These parameters need to be
adjusted for each place, being essential for the COVID-19 description.
In general, the parameter definitions depend on several issues, being a difficult task. In
this regard, it should be pointed out that real data has spatial aspects that are not treated by this
set of governing equations. Hence, this analysis is a kind of average behavior that needs a
proper adjustment to match real data. Besides, R Li et al. (2020) evaluated Wuhan situation
concluding that undocumented novel coronavirus infections are critical for understanding the
overall prevalence and pandemic potential of this disease. The authors estimated that 86% of
all infections were undocumented and that the transmission rate per person of undocumented
infections was 55% of documented infections. This aspect makes the description even more
complex.
The use of step functions to define some parameters allows a proper representation of
different scenarios, especially the transmission rate. It is also important to observe that either
governmental or individual actions have a delayed effect on system dynamics. Virus mutations
are another relevant aspect related to the description of coronavirus dynamics that can
dramatically alter the system response, but are not treated here.
Numerical simulations are performed considering the fourth-order Runge-Kutta
method. The next sections treat the COVID-19 dynamics considering two different objectives.
Initially, the next section performed a model verification using information from China, Italy,
Iran and Brazil. Afterward, the subsequent section evaluates different scenarios for the
Brazilian case, using the parameters adjusted for the verification cases.

MODEL VERIFICATION

As an initial step of the developed analysis, a model verification is carried out using
information

available

on

Worldometer

(https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/),

considering different countries (Last updates: China – March 26, Italy – Mar 21; Iran – Mar
26; Brazil – Mar 24). The fundamental hypothesis of the analysis is that average populations
of the country is of concern. Therefore, it is assumed that each country has a homogeneous
distribution, without spatial patterns.
Basically, information from China, Italy, Iran and Brazil are employed. This information
is useful to calibrate the model parameters, evaluating its correspondence with real data. Table
1 presents parameters employed for all simulations. They are based on the information of the
Lin et al. (2020) that, in turn, is based on other references as He et al. (2010) and Breto et al.
(2009). For more details, see other citations referenced therein.

In addition, susceptible population initial condition is assumed to be 𝑆0 = 0.9𝑁 − 𝐸0 −
𝐼0 − 𝑅0 . In addition, it is assumed that there is no recovered population initially, i.e., 𝑅0 = 0.
Another information needed for the model is the number exposed persons for each infected
person. It is adopted that each infected person has the potential to expose 20 persons, 𝐸0 =
20𝐼0.
Transmission rate considers specific parameters for each case. Nevertheless, the
reference values are presented in Table 2.

Other parameters are adjusted depending on the case. In the sequence, the dynamics of
four different countries is analyzed in order to promote a model verification.

3.1 Verification Simulations

The first scenario for the model verification is based on China results. It should be pointed
out that this analysis considers all cases in China, not restricted to Wuhan. Parameters presented
in Table 3 are employed for simulations with a population of N = 1.43109 and an initial state
with 554 infected persons (𝐼0 = 554). It should be highlighted again that these parameters are
average ones since they are valid for the whole country. Of course, reaction time is different
from the distinct parts of the country, which makes necessary to estimate this parameter based
on the real data in an average way. Figure 2 presents infected population evolution showing a
good agreement between simulation and real data.

Due to chronological issues, Chinese case is the one with a large number of real data,
which makes it useful to establish a comparison of the model prediction error. Figure 3 presents
daily errors from china, highlighting the average and maximum errors. Note that the maximum
error is less than 28%, with an average error of 13.58%.

Figure 3: China – prediction errors between the simulated and real data of the infected

For the following three cases, Italy, Iran and Brazil, it is assumed that the second stage
of governmental action has not been reached yet. Therefore, it is represented by a step function
(2)

𝛼𝑖 = [0, 0.4239], which means that 𝑇𝐺𝑜𝑣 is neglected and 𝛼3 does not exist.
Italian case is now in focus considering parameters presented in Table 4 with a population
of N = 60.48106 and an initial state with 20 infected persons (𝐼0 = 20). A step function is
considered to define the nominal transmission rate, 𝛽0 , due to extreme governmental actions
that have not been effective until present days. Figure 4 presents the infected population
simulation compared with real data, showing a good agreement. Figure 5 presents daily errors
from Italy, highlighting the average and maximum errors. For this case, the maximum error is
less than 19%, with an average error of 10.60%.

population of N = 81.16106 and an initial state with 20 infected persons (𝐼0 = 20). Results are
presented in Figure 6 showing a good agreement with real data. Figure 7 presents daily errors,
highlighting the average and maximum errors. Although the average error is 15.46%, the
maximum error is around 42%, which is a large value. Nevertheless, it should be observed that
the big values are related to the beginning of the predictions, probably due to problems with
the original data.

outbreak is in the beginning, with information that is not enough for a better calibration.

BRAZILIAN SCENARIOS

This section has the objective to investigate different scenarios related to COVID-19
dynamics in Brazil. Parameters adjusted on the previous section are employed to evaluate
different scenarios varying governmental and individual reactions. It should be pointed out that
this adjustment does not have enough information, but it is possible to perform, at least a
qualitative analysis of the COVID-19 dynamics in Brazil.
Initially, two different transmission rates are defined: naive scenario, without
intervention (𝛼 = 𝜅 = 0); and with governmental and individual actions (𝛼 ≠ 0; 𝜅 ≠ 0).
Figure 9 presents numerical simulations together with the real data that is presented just for the
first days. The same parameters presented in Table 6 are employed assuming
(2)

𝑇𝐺𝑜𝑣 = 37 days. A logarithm scale is adopted since the naive scenario has a dramatic increase
of the infected cases. Besides the big difference between both cases, it is clear the huge impact

11

of variations on the transmission rate function that represents governmental and individual
actions. It is noticeable that the effective actions tend to reduce the infected population,
reducing the final crisis period as well.

Figure 9: Transmission evolution considering two different scenarios for different
transmission rates: naive scenario, without intervention (𝛼 = 𝜅 = 0); and with governmental
intervention and individual action with the values adjusted in the previous section.

A more detailed analysis of the COVID-19 dynamics is treated considering the other
populations for the case with intervention treated in Figure 9 (parameters of Table 6 with
(2)

𝑇𝐺𝑜𝑣 = 37 days). Figure 10 presents all system state variables, showing the susceptible, S,
exposed, E, infected, I, removed, R, public perception, D, and cumulative cases, C. The
interaction among all the populations defines a kind of equilibrium established by the
governing equations.

12

Figure 10: Population interactions considering a scenario with intervention: susceptible, S,
exposed, E, infected, I, removed, R, public perception, D, and cumulative cases, C.

Nowadays, one of the most relevant issue to be discussed in terms of propagation is the
governmental and individual actions. A parametric analysis is of concern considering distinct
scenarios related to intervention. Scenarios defined by the variation of the intervention
moments is initially treated. The moment of the governmental action start, represented by
(1)

parameter 𝑇𝐺𝑜𝑣 (day), is analyzed in Figure 11, considering the following values: 17, 22, 27
(2)

(1)

and 32 and 𝑇𝐺𝑜𝑣 is assumed to be 20 days after 𝑇𝐺𝑜𝑣 . Note that the delay to the start of the
governmental action dramatically alters the response, increasing the number infected
population and its duration. The same conclusion can be established considering the second
(2)

governmental action, represented by 𝑇𝐺𝑜𝑣 (day), presented in Figure 12 that shows the same
trend considering a different set of start instants: 37, 42, 47 and 52.

start, represented by parameter 𝑇𝐺𝑜𝑣 (day): 37, 42, 47 and 52.
A scenario with a governmental action that starts, finishes and then restarts again is
(𝑖)

now evaluated, considering the following parameters: 𝑇𝐺𝑜𝑣 = [17, 37, 52] and 𝛼𝑖 =
[0, 0.4239, 0 , 0.8478]. This scenario is compared with the usual one where the intervention
(𝑖)

starts in a level and then evolve to a more severe situation, considering: 𝑇𝐺𝑜𝑣 = [17, 52] and
𝛼𝑖 = [0, 0.4239, 0.8478]. Figure 13 shows both situations represented by the transmission

14

function and the evolution of infected populations. It is clear that the interruption of the
governmental action causes a dramatic worst scenario.

CONCLUSIONS

A mathematical model based on the susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered
framework is employed to describe the COVID-19 evolution. A verification procedure is
performed based on the available data from China, Italy, Iran and Brazil. Afterward, different
scenarios from Brazil is analyzed. Results clearly show that governmental and individual
actions are essential to reduce the infected populations and also the total period of the crisis.
The mathematical model can be improved in order to include more phenomenological
information that can increase its capability to describe different scenarios. Nevertheless, it
should be pointed out that the mathematical model and its numerical simulations are important
tools that can be useful for public health planning.
