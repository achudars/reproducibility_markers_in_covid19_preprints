In this paper, it is shown that the Moyal distribution is an excelent tool to study the SARSCov-II (Covid-19) epidemiological associated curves and its propagation. The Moyal parameters
give all the information to describe the form and the impact of the illness outbreak in the different
affected countries and its global impact. We checked that the Moyal distribution can accurately fit
the daily report of new confirmed cases of infected people (NCC) per country, in that places where
the contagion is reaching their final phase, describing the beginning, the most intense phase and
the descend of the contagion, simultaneously . In order to achieve the purpose of this work, it is
important to work with a complete and well compilated set of the data to be used to fit the curves.
Data from European countries like France, Spain, Italy Belgium, Sweden, United Kingdom, Denmark
and others like USA and China, have been used. Also, the correlation between the parameters of
the Moyal distribution fitting and the general public health measures imposed in each country, have
been discussed. A relation between those policies and the features of the Moyal distribution, in
terms of their parameters and critical points, is shown; from that, it can be seen that the knowledge
of the time evolution of the epidemiological curve, their critical points, superposition properties
and rates of the rising and the ending, could help to find a way to estimate the efficiency of social
distancing measures, imposed in each country, and anticipate the different phases of the pandemic.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Given the development of the pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) outbreak, it is urgent and a priority
to take decisions on public health policies and applicate them immediately. Data analysis applied to epidemiological
records can provide immediate information on the trend and progress of the contagion. The statistical distribution
of the large amount of affected people, NCC , as well as the hospitalized and deceased individuals, shows a trend and
a regular pattern common to most of the cases, especially when cases by country are studied. Particular variations
in the statistics of the NCC, along the time, can be clasificated in a finite number of categories, all of them, based in
the same mathematical model. These data are available today, thanks to the large number of websites of government
institutions that make such information available to the public. In this paper the data from [1] are used. Shortly
after the outbreak appeared in the Chinese city of Wuhan, specific theoretical works for this problem started to be
published [29–31], trying to adapt and generalize the SIR[2–11] or SEIR model[12–16] using the information that was
available (or inferred) at the time, related to the parameters of the system of simultaneous differential equations [17].
On the other hand, the limited knowlegde on this suddenly and complex phenomenon, in the geometric and numerical
details of the epidemiological curve, has been a barrier for anticipating the degrees of freedom in the analisys of the
statistical distributions of affected people, as a function of time, as well as a dare to know their symmetries, critical
points, growth constants, extinction times, etc. So, alternative methods based on empirical methods[18–28] are needed
to predict and to measure the effects of pulblic health policy to contain Covid-19. With the presented methodology,
it is not only possible to characterize the evolution of the phenomenon, but also to identify anomalies in its behavior
and sanitary risks that could menace the population (for instance, new outbreaks), offering a systematic way for
planning and implementing of political, sanitary and economic strategies that will serve as a guide for the removal of

the quarantine, the return to confinement or to anticipate a new outbreaks. Also, this is an effective methodology to
measure the start and the ending times of the epidemy phases.

II.

METODOLOGY

Lets consider, as a case study, the number of NCC per day. The outbreak in Italy was one of the first to develop
and strongly affect a significant number of its inhabitants. The progress per day is very well documented and, at this
time, it is in the extinction stage. Given the characteristics of the distribution of data over time, the best way to
mathematically describe the number of NCC per day is using the Moyal distribution Λ(t, A, µ, β), [33] which is also
known to be a very accurate approximation of the Landau distribution [32]

Λ(t) = √ e

whose derivative can be expresed in the form of a generalized exponential growth of the form:

(2)

where r (t) is the ratio of growing with units of time−1 (in this work the time unit is day):

r(t) =

i
1 h − t−µ
e β −1
2β

(3)

The theoretical interpretation of the Moyal distribution parameters is straighforward: i) The global factor and area
under the curve, A, correspond to the total of the affected individuals by Covid-19, since the beggining of the outbreak
up to their ending. ii) from r(t)Λ(t) = 0, Λ(µ) is the maximum number of NCC at the day t = µ; iii) β is a parameter,
with units of day, that uniquely characterizes the growth and extinction times of the epidemic outbreak. In a general
sense, it is the time constant of the epidemic. It is remarkable that the affectation, in the different categories of
the victims: Infected, hospitalized and deceased, have the same behavior and similar time constants for a particular
outbreak. Also, it is possible to identify the temporal delay between the maximum values of the each distribution,
from which the average recovery or death times can be quantified.

III.

MATHEMATICAL MODEL

The applied mathematical model to the data analysis is based on the hypothesis of an exponencial behaviour of
the COVID-19, where the time variation of the function is proportional to the number of cases at time t, modulated
by a time function. The cumulative distribution associated to Moyal distribution is given by:

The error function is very close to the logistic function which is usually used to describe pandemic propagation[19,
20]. But in our case the derivative of the logistic function is too symmetric to describe well the tails of the new dialy
infected cases for Covid-19 as observed in countries where the Covid-19 pandemy is slowly down and passed its highest
point. Also the error function appears in solution of lineal difusion equation with constant coefficient of diffusion. It
is interesting to get the critical points of the Moyal distribution. As said before, the maximum value of the Moyal

Obviously, the four parameters (A, β, µ, B1 and B2 ) obtained through the fit of Λ(t) to experimental data are scale
invariant, mark the escential points of the epidemiological curve and define the evolution of the epidemy for all time;
for instance Λ(B1 ) = 0.493Λ(µ). In figure 1, the model is applied to data from Germany.

RESULTS

The growth pattern is not only qualitatively similar in the different epidemiological outbreaks, following an asymmetric bell shape, furthermore, the numerical parameters that characterize the duration of the epidemic and the
relative location of its maximum point, are determined by the value of β: ∆t = 2(1.317)β is the lapse to reach
the maximum of daily new cases (for any category) starting from 0.006Λ(µ). On the other slope of the curve,
∆t = 5(1.317)β is the lapse to diminish the daily NCC, from the maximum value, to 0.06Λ(µ). Figure 2 shows the
main qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the epidemiological curve: the asymmetric bell shape according

to the Moyal distribuion, in which the position of the maxima clearly shows the average time between the maximum
of confirmed cases and the maximum number of deaths. Likewise, a fundamental property of the asymmetry of the
curve is shown, which is inherent to the mathematical function that describes it: the beginning of the growth of the
cases at t = −2(1.317)β + µ , prior to the maximum, as well as the extinction of the curve around t = 5(1.317)β + µ.
From table I, it is interesting that the countries can be classified, depending of the value of β, as shown in table
II. Contrasting this table with the general public health policy applied in each country to fight against the Covid19. European countries like Spain, Italy, Belgium, Germany and France have globally applied the same kinds of
measures to restraint the propagation of the illness. Sweden is the main European country who decided not to apply
quarentine. United Kingdom started with a kind of policy similar to Sweden, nevertheless, they eventually changed to
quarentine measures, as continental european countries like France and Spain did. In USA, the decision to implement
a quarentine or not was given to the states government, but under he pressure from federal governement to limit the
measures as much as was possible. China imposed the most strict confinement measures and its very low value of β
is an expression of the result of this policy.

and the solid line corresponds to only one Moyal distribution.

In the next subsection, we shall discuss with more details the situation in countries like Sweden, USA and United
Kingdom to illustrate the effects of general public health policy in the epidemiological curve describing Covid-19
propagation.

A.

Sweden case

In the case of Sweden, the daily NCC are very dispersed after reaching its maximun around t = 100. Nevertheless,
despite the fluctuations, the average trend is not going down; instead of that, the number of cases agrees with a
new modelization strategy: a suitable fitting function ΛT (t), must describe the appearence of new outbreaks through
the sum of differen Moyal distribution, one for each independent outbreaks. Of course, once a new contribution is
added, in the sum of Moyal functions, new degrees of freedom are added to the fit and this could increase the fitting
instability and difficult to do the algorithm converging. For simplicity, the sum of two independent Moyal distribution
is done, this can be written as follow:
ΛT (t) = Λ1 (t, A1 , β1 , µ1 ) + Λ2 (t, A2 , β2 , µ2 )

(10)

In the figure 3, the situation in Sweden is shown first using a Moyal distribution (the solid line) and, as expected,
the tail go down slowly. The dashed line represents the sum of two Moyal distributions and at present time and in
that case, the best fit prefer a trend to increase the average values, in the number of daily NCC, which could mean
that a new outbreak is taking place at this time. Meanwhile new avalaible data are published, both options must be
followed.

United Kindgom case

An interesting case, to prove the efficacy to fit a function ΛT (t) , as described in equation 10, is the anslysis of the
United Kingdom data. This case have a small but clear bump just after reach the maximum of the daily NCC. The
combination of two Moyal functions, is consistent with the assumption of two independent outbreaks, that contribute
to the total amount of cases. In figure 4, the solid line corresponds to the Moyal distribution with the parameters
given in table I. The dashed line correspond to the sum of two Moyal distribution.

C.

USA case

In the USA case, the outgoing tail takes an unusual longer time to decrease, nevertheless, it could be considered
according to one Moyal Distribution, nevertheless, this occurr in first approximation; a better data description is
achieved with the sum of two Moyal distribution. In figure 5, it can be seen the results when two Moyal distribution
are used. the dashed line corresponds to the fitting of a single Moyal distribution. The parameters values are given in
table I. The solid line corresponds to the sum of the two Moyal distribution. The parameters values of the two Moyal
distribution are given in table IV. This could be interpreted from the epidemilogical point of view because the fact
that USA has several different outbreak of the Covid-19, each of them with different time of starting and parameters.
It is interesting that the first Moyal distribution parameters are very closed to the New York Covid outbreak where
the maximum of NCC took place around the 7th April and the number of infected persons are around 380,000, within
one error sigma of our first Moyal distribution parameters.

CONCLUSION

In this paper, we have shown that the Moyal distribution is an excelent tool to study the Covid-19 epidemiological
curves and its propagation. The Moyal parameters give all the information to describe the form and the impact of
the propagation of the illness and its global impact on the country. Also it has been shown that the resutls of public
health policy measures can be evaluated through the β parameter. Clearly, this analisis could be extended to more
countries with good statistics on daily new cases, in order to applicate, validade or generalize our hipothesis. A very
interesting point is that it is possible to use this tool even before to reach the maximum point of new cases, in order
to predict the effects of social measures imposed to restrain the propagation of the Covid-19.
