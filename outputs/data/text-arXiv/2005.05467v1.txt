Abstract
Now that various countries are or will soon be moving towards relaxing shelter-in-place
rules, it is important that people use a face covering, to avoid an exponential resurgence of
the spreading of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Adherence to this measure will be
made explicitly compulsory in many places. However, since it is impossible to control each
and every person in a country, it is important to complement governmental laws with
behavioral interventions devised to impact people’s behavior beyond the force of law. Here
we report a pre-registered online experiment (N=2,459) using a heterogenous, although not
representative, sample of people living in the USA, where we test the relative effect of
messages highlighting that the coronavirus is a threat to “you” vs “your family” vs “your
community” vs “your country” on self-reported intentions to wear a face covering. Results
show that focusing on “your community” promotes intentions to wear a face covering relative
to the baseline; the trend is the same when comparing “your community” to the other
conditions, but not significant. We also conducted pre-registered analyses of gender
differences on intentions to wear a face covering. We find that men less than women intend
to wear a face covering, but this difference almost disappears in counties where wearing a
face covering is mandatory. We also find that men less than women believe that they will be
seriously affected by the coronavirus, and this partly mediates gender differences in
intentions to wear a face covering (this is particularly ironic because official statistics actually
show that men are affected by the COVID-19 more seriously than women). Finally, we also
find gender differences in self-reported negative emotions felt when wearing a face covering.
Men more than women agree that wearing a face covering is shameful, not cool, a sign of
weakness, and a stigma; and these gender differences also mediate gender differences in
intentions to wear a face covering.

Introduction
The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic represents a serious threat for millions of
people around the world. In Bergamo the excess deaths in April 2020 (defined as the number
of deaths in April 2020 minus the average number of deaths in the months before the
COVID-19 outbreak) was equal to 4.5 times the baseline number of deaths; in Guayas,
Ecuador, it was equal to 3.5 times the baseline number of deaths; in New York City it was
equal to 3 times (Burn-Murdoch, Romei, & Giles, 2020). These numbers clearly tell about
the deadly power of this coronavirus: since the baseline number of deaths worldwide is about
57 million people a year, if the coronavirus were to hit the planet with the same power as it
hit Bergamo, Guayas or New York, somewhere between 150 millions and 250 millions
people could die in a year.
Critically, a great deal of these deaths are not due directly to the coronavirus, but to the fact
that hospitals get overwhelmed and people cannot be treated as they should (Fink, 2020;
Glanz et al., 2020). For this reason, dozens of countries have imposed restrictions to the free
circulation of people, with the short-term goal of slowing down the exponential growth of the
virus and “flatten the curve” of the spread. At the time of this writing, about one third of the
world population is under some form of restriction (Kaplan, Frias, & McFall-Johnsen, 2020).
However, restrictions are highly costly in the long-term, both economically and
psychologically (Van Bavel et al. 2020). Therefore, the countries in which the curve of the
spread has been flattened (at least to some extent) are preparing to (or have already) lift(ed)
some of the restrictions; these include some of the most severely hit countries, such as Italy,
Spain, and the USA.
Yet, since a cure to the COVID-19 has not been found yet, it is of utmost importance that,
when shelter-in-place rules are relaxed, people take preventive measures to avoid that the
virus starts exponentially spreading again. One of the key prevention measures that have been
discussed by medical researchers and policy makers is wearing a face covering, which has
even been made mandatory in several European countries as well as in many American
counties, while it is strongly suggested in others (Javid, 2020).
Messaging to promote intentions to wear a face covering
To adhere to a rule such as wearing a face covering is difficult because it requires a
substantial change in our habits. Therefore, the risk that people do not adhere to it is high. For
this reason, finding mechanisms that can promote the use of face covering is key during this
phase of the pandemic response. Regulations that explicitly punish the violation of the rule
are certainly crucial to impose behavioral changes. However, since it is impossible to control
each and every person in a country, it is important to complement explicit governmental laws
with implicit behavioral interventions designed to impact people’s behavior without the force
of law.
In particular, messages highlighting the costs (or the benefits) of (not) failing to respect
prevention measures can be very effective, as they can be displayed almost everywhere in the
street through screens and posters; they can reach people in their homes through television
and social media; and they can even be voiced in the street using cars equipped with a
megaphone, as it happened in Italy (Provantini & Ugolini, 2020). This raises an important
question. Which types of messages are most effective in promoting pandemic responses that
are in line with the recommendations of the medical profession? Social and behavioral

science can be helpful in answering this question (Van Bavel et al. 2020). Accordingly,
several works in the past month have explored the effect of several types of messages on
pandemic response (Bilancini et al. 2020; Everett et al. 2020; Heffner, Vives, &
FeldmanHall, 2020; Jordan et al. 2020).
From the viewpoint of classical economic theory, people are inherently self-regarding, which
suggests that messages focusing on the consequences at the individual level might be more
effective than messages focusing on the consequences on others, even genetically related
others. Yet, decades of social and psychological research shows that people sometimes do not
act solely to maximize their own payoff: at least in economic games, a substantial proportion
of people appear to be driven by moral preferences (Krupka & Weber, 2013; Kimbrough &
Vostroknutov, 2016; Eriksson et al., 2017; Capraro & Rand, 2018; Tappin & Capraro, 2018).
Research using electric shocks has also shown that people tend to weigh harm to others more
than harm to self (Crockett et al. 2014). This suggests that highlighting the consequences on
other people may be a more effective strategy than highlighting the consequences to the self.
Consistent with this view, Jordan et al. (2020) have recently reported an experiment on
Amazon Mechanical Turk (with American participants) where they found that telling
participants that the coronavirus is a threat to “their community” is more effective at
increasing prevention intentions than telling participants that the coronavirus is a threat to
“themselves”. However, in their measure of preventive measures, no item regarding the use
of face covering was included.
The first contribution of our work is that we extend Jordan et al.’s work both in terms of the
set of messages and in terms of preventive measures. In terms of messages, we test the
relative effectiveness of messages highlighting that the coronavirus is a threat for people’s
family and for people’s compatriots, beyond the messages already used by Jordan et al.
Second, we focus on intentions to engage in a type of preventive behavior that is particularly
important now that shelter-in-place rule are being relaxed: wearing a face covering. This
preventive behavior was not considered in previous research.
Gender differences in intentions to wear a face covering and in emotions felt when
wearing a face covering
The second contribution of our work regards a detailed (pre-registered) analysis of gender
differences in self-reported intentions to wear a face covering and in the self-reported
negative emotions felt when wearing a face covering. The rationale for this analysis comes
from the observation that previous work has found that men intend to engage in preventive
behaviors less than women do (Jordan et al. 2020). Therefore, we predicted that we would
find gender differences also in intentions to wear a face covering. Clearly, understanding
whether there are such differences could be important to tailor interventions specifically on
men. For this reason, we reasoned that, beyond asking intentions to wear a face covering, it
would have been important to also collect self-reported emotions felt when wearing a face
covering. The idea is that it is possible that men more than women report having negative
feelings when wearing a face covering, and this could eventually mediate the gender
differences in intentions to wear a face covering.
After the first round of data collection (see Methods for details), we noticed another
interesting pattern of results related to gender. It seemed that gender differences in intentions
to wear a face covering were particularly strong in counties were wearing a face covering was

not mandatory, while they almost disappeared in counties were wearing a face covering was
mandatory. In other words, it seemed that making mandatory the wear of a face covering
affected men’s intentions to a greater extent than women’s intentions. Therefore, we took
advantage of the second session of data collection to further explore this effect. Moreover, in
the second session, we decided to include questions about the subjective likelihood to get the
coronavirus disease and, if so, the subjective likelihood to get over it relatively easily. Our
rationale was that it is possible that these variables mediate gender differences in intentions to
wear a face covering, and maybe also in emotions felt when wearing a face covering. We
knew that this would be particularly ironic because medical studies do show that men are
affected by the COVID-19 more seriously that women (Cai, 2020; Chen et al. 2020).
Method
Conditions
Participants were randomly assigned to one of five conditions. In each case, they were shown
a message. The key difference between the messages is that the message in the You condition
stresses the fact that the coronavirus is a threat to “you” (i.e., the participant); the message in
the Your family condition stresses the fact that the coronavirus is a threat to “your family”;
the message in the Your community condition stresses the fact that the coronavirus is a threat
to “your community”; the message in the Your country condition stresses the fact that the
coronavirus is a threat to “your country”. See Table 1 for the exact messages.

Dependent variables
After reading the message, all participants took three scales. The first two scales were taken
in random order.
1) Intentions to wear a face covering. Participants were asked to “be as accurate and
honest as [they] can” when rating the following items: When the shelter-in-place rules
are relaxed, I intend to ...
a. Wear a face covering any time I leave home.
b. Wear a face covering any time I am engaged in essential activities and/or
work, and there is no substitute for physical distancing and staying at home.
c. Wear a face covering any time I'm around people outside my household.
2) Intentions to practice physical distancing. Participants were asked to “be as accurate
and honest as [they] can”, when rating the following items: When the shelter-in-place
rules are relaxed, I intend to ...
a. Avoid hugging.
b. Avoid kissing.
c. Keep physical distance.
d. Avoid handshaking.
After the main scales, participants took a third scale.
3) Emotion felt from wearing a face covering. Participants were asked to what extent
they agree with the following statements:
a. Wearing a face covering is cool.
b. Wearing a face covering is not cool.
c. Wearing a face covering is shameful
d. Wearing a face covering is a sign of weakness.

e. The stigma attached to wearing a face covering is preventing me from wearing
one as often as I should
All answers were collected using a 10-line “snap to grid” slider with three labels: “strongly
disagree” at the far left, “neither agree nor disagree” at the center, “strongly agree” at the far
right.
Demographics
After the scales, participants were asked a set of demographic variables: sex, age, race,
political views, religiosity, whether they live in an urban area, whether wearing a face
covering is mandatory in their county, and whether there live in an area where shelter-inplace rules apply. There were also some other demographics, but these depended on the
experimental session. In Session 1 we asked participants whether they were tested positive,
whether they were tested negative, whether they were not tested but believe to have had the
coronavirus. In session 2, we replaced the last two questions with two questions regarding the
subjective likelihood of getting infected and the subjective likelihood of recovering relatively
easily in case they get infected. These variables were formulated as follows. We asked
subjects to report the extent to which they agree with the statement “I believe that it is
unlikely that I will get the coronavirus (COVID-19)” and with the statement “If I get the
coronavirus (COVID-19), I believe I will get over it relatively easily”. Answers were
collected using a 7-point likert scale from 1 = “strongly disagree” to 7 = “strongly agree”. At
the end, there was one control question to get rid of potential bots.
Pre-registration
The design1 and the analyses of Session 1 were pre-registered at:
https://aspredicted.org/xj837.pdf. Those of Session 2 were pre-registered at:
https://aspredicted.org/yr6p4.pdf. As pre-registered in Session 2, the reason for conducting
two sessions is that Session 1 gave some inconclusive results that we wanted to test on a
larger sample. Here we report the analysis directly on the overall sample. We conducted
analysis with and without a dummy variable taking into account the experimental session. All
the results remain qualitatively the same. Also, in the main text we focus on the results
relative to wearing a face covering; the results on physical distancing were uninteresting and
so we relegate them to the Appendix. We conduct the relevant analyses with and without a
dummy variable that takes into account which scale was taken first. All the results remain
qualitatively the same. Therefore, in the analysis that follows we report the outcomes without
these dummy variables.
Results
Participants
The experiment was conducted in two sessions, the first one on April 28, 2020, the second
one on May 4. In total, we recruited 2,516 participants living in the USA using Amazon
Mechanical Turk (Paolacci, Chandler, & Ipeirotis, 2010). Those who participated in session 1
(as identified by their Turk ID) were not allowed to participate in Session 2. Within the same
session, we found 32 multiple IP addresses and multiple Turk IDs; for each of them, we kept

only the first observation. Additionally, we found that 25 subjects did not pass the bot test. As
pre-registered, we eliminated these subjects. Thus, we remained with 2,459 subjects. Table 2
reports the demographic characteristics of the overall sample. The sample is quite
heterogeneous, although not representative: males are slightly overrepresented; the age group
25-54 is overrepresented, at the cost of the age groups 18-24 and 65+, which are
underrepresented; whites are also overrepresented, while Blacks or African Americans are
underrepresented.2 Moreover, the average participant appears to be also more left-leaning
than the average American.3 The sample is representative of people living in urban areas.4
We could not find the exact percentage of counties where wearing a face covering was
mandatory, neither we could find the exact percentage of counties where there were shelterin-place rules; in the Table we report also these proportions for completeness.

The effect of messages on self-reported intentions to wear a face covering
We begin by building the composite variable intentions to wear a face covering by taking the
average of its three items (a = 0.932). Figure 2 reports the mean value of this variable, split
by condition (error bars represent standard error of the mean). As pre-registered, we make
pairwise comparisons using Wilcoxon rank-sum to test for differences across conditions. We
find that the Your community condition gives rise to greater intentions to wear masks than the
Baseline (p = 0.021) and, marginally, than the Your family condition (p = 0.065). All other
p’s > 0.1.

Figure 1. Mean values of the “intention to wear a face covering” variable, split by condition.
Error bars represent standard errors of the means.
We also conduct exploratory analysis using linear regression to test whether this effect is
robust to the inclusion of demographic variables. We find that the difference between the
Your community condition and the Baseline remains significant when including all controls
(b = 0.404, p = 0.020). All other comparisons are not significant (all p’s > 0.1). Moreover, we
find than none of the main demographic variables moderate the effect (gender: p = 0.638;
age: p = 0.490; race: p = 0.885; religion: p = 0.492; urban: p = 0.885; face covering
mandatory: p = 0.926; shelter-in-place rules: p = 0.995). The only individual characteristics
that moderated the effect was political orientation (b = 0.252, p = 0.017). The positive sign
suggests that the positive effect of focusing on your community was driven by people who
self-report being right-leaning. Indeed, exploratory analysis shows that the effect is absent
among people who self-report being left-leaning (b = 0.115, p = 0.497) and it is marginally
significant among subjects who self-report being right-leaning (b = 0.722, p = 0.075).
Individual differences in self-reported negative emotions felt when wearing a face covering
In the first session, we pre-registered that we would test for the effect of gender and age on
the “negative emotions felt wearing a face covering”. Here, we report this analysis directly on

the whole sample (session 1 and session 2 together). First, we build this composite variable
by taking the average of its five items, after reversing the first item (a = 0.747). Then, as preregistered, we use linear regression to check the effect of sex and age on this variable, first in
the baseline condition and then in all conditions together, in order to test for robustness. In
the baseline, we find that being a female is significantly less associated with negative
emotions felt wearing a face covering (b = -0.329, p = 0.037), as it is also being older (b = 0.012, p = 0.049). Putting all conditions together, we obtain a similar effect of gender (b = 0.398, p < 0.001), while the effect of age becomes smaller and marginally significant (b = 0.004, p = 0.059). If we control, as pre-registered, for all the demographic variable (see Table
3), both the effects of gender and age are highly significant. Controlling for the demographic
variables also reveal a significant effect of political views (right-leaning people tend to have
more negative feelings when wearing a face covering). We also conduct non-preregistered
exploratory analyses over the “intentions to wear a face covering” variable to see whether
these individual differences remain significant. We find that they do. Being a female is
associated with greater intentions to wear a face covering; the same holds true for being leftleaning and for being older. Interestingly, we find that living in a county where wearing a
face covering is mandatory impacts people’s intentions to wear a face covering, but not the
negative emotions that they feel when wearing a face covering. We refer to Table 3 for
regression details.

Gender differences as a function of whether wearing a face covering is mandatory
As pre-registered, we now explore more in-depth gender differences in intentions to wear a
face covering and in negative emotions felt when wearing a face covering, as a function of
whether wearing a face covering is mandatory in the county where the participant lives. For
this analysis, we exclude 10 subjects who responded that they prefer not to say their gender.
Figure 3 summarizes the results. Linear regression predicting intentions to wear a face
covering as a function of sex, a dummy variable that takes into account whether the face
covering is mandatory, and their interaction, reveals a significant main effect of gender (b =
0.776, p < .001), a significant main effect of whether wearing a face covering is mandatory (b
= 1.755, p < .001), and, crucially, a significant interaction (b = -0.499, p = 0.031). The
interaction is driven by the fact that gender differences in intentions to wear a face covering
are very strong when wearing a face covering is not mandatory (b = 0.720, p < .001), but less
so when wearing a face covering is mandatory (b = 0.298, p = 0.026). All these effects
remain qualitatively the same when we include controls on all the other demographics.

Figure 2. Gender differences in intentions to wear a face covering, split by whether wearing
a face covering is mandatory in the county where the participant lives.
Then we look at gender differences in negative emotions felt when wearing a face covering.
For this analysis too, we exclude 10 subjects who responded that they prefer not to say their
gender. Figure 4 summarizes the results. Linear regression predicting the negative emotions
felt when wearing a face covering as a function of sex, whether the face covering is
mandatory, and their interaction, reveals a significant main effect of gender (b = -0.435, p <
.001), a significant main effect of whether wearing a face covering is mandatory (b = -0.204,
p =0.048), and a statistically non-significant interaction (b = 0.067, p = 0.653). Note,
however, that, as we have seen before, the main effect of whether wearing a face covering is
mandatory loses significance when controlling for all other variables; and this happens also
when we include the interaction between sex and whether wearing the face covering is
mandatory, in which case the main effect of whether wearing the face covering is mandatory
is not significant (p=0.187).

whether wearing a face covering is mandatory in the county where the participant lives.
Mediation analyses
In Session 2 we pre-registered that we would test: (i) whether gender differences in intentions
to wear a face covering are mediated by the negative emotions felt when wearing a face
covering, (ii) whether gender differences in intentions to wear a face covering are mediated
by the perceived likelihood of getting infected and, if so, by the perceived likelihood to
recover from the infection relatively easily, and (iii) whether gender differences in negative
emotions felt when wearing a face covering are mediated by the perceived likelihood of
getting infected and, if so, by the perceived likelihood to recover from the infection relatively
easily.
Starting from the first mediation analysis, linear regression predicting intentions to wear a
face covering as a function of gender and emotions felt when wearing a face covering reveals
that the negative emotions felt from wearing a face covering have a significant negative
effect on intentions to wear a face covering (b = -0.686, p < .001) and that the coefficient of
the gender variable (b = 0.317, p = 0.003) is smaller than the coefficient of the gender
variable that is obtained when regressing intentions to wear a face covering over gender only
(b = 0.590, p < .001). This suggests that, indeed, negative emotions felt when wearing a face
covering partly mediates gender differences in intentions to wear a face covering.
We now pass to the other two mediation analyses. First of all, we test whether there are
gender differences in the two measures that are supposed to mediate the effect. Indeed, linear
regression finds that men more than women believe that it is unlikely that they will get
infected (b=0.318, p <.001); in a scale from 0 to 6, the mean values are 3.25 (SE = 0.06) for

men and 2.94 (SE = 0.06) for women. Similarly, men more than women believe that, in case
they get infected, they will get over it relatively easily (b = 0.217, p = 0.009); in a scale from
0 to 6, the mean values are 3.42 (SE = 0.06) for men and 3.20 (SE = 0.06) for women.
So, we pass to the mediation analyses to see whether these variables mediate gender
differences in intentions to wear a face covering and in the negative emotions felt when
wearing a face covering.
Regressing the intentions to wear a face covering over gender and the subjective likelihood to
get infected, we find that the subjective probability to get infected is significant (b = -0.417, p
< .001) and that the coefficient of the gender variable (b = 0.462) is smaller than the
coefficient of the gender variable that is obtained when regressing the intentions to wear a
face covering over gender only (b = 0.590). This indicates that, indeed, the subjective
likelihood to get infected partly mediates gender differences in intentions to wear a face
covering. A qualitatively similar result is obtained replacing the “subjective likelihood to get
infected” variable with the “subjective likelihood to recover in case one gets infected”
variable: when regressing intentions to wear a face covering over gender and the likelihood to
get over it if infected, we find that the perceived likelihood variable is significant (b = -0.577,
p < .001) and that the coefficient of the gender variable (b = 0.471) is smaller than the
coefficient of the gender variable that is obtained when regressing the intentions to wear a
face covering variable over the gender variable only (b = 0.590).
Interestingly, we find that the same variables, the subjective likelihood to get infected and the
subjective likelihood to get over it in case one gets infected, do not mediate the gender
difference in the negative emotions felt when wearing a face covering. Regressing the
negative emotions felt when wearing a face covering over gender and the subjective
likelihood to get infected, we do find that the likelihood to get infected variable is significant
(b = 0.145, p < .001), but this time the coefficient of the gender variable (b = -0.396) is
essentially the same as the coefficient of the gender variable that is obtained when regressing
the negative emotions felt when wearing a face covering over the gender variable only (b = 0.398). Similarly, regressing the negative emotions felt when wearing a face covering over
gender and the subjective likelihood to get over the disease easily in case one gets it, we do
find that the likelihood to get over it variable is significant (b = 0.145, p < .001), but this time
the coefficient of the gender variable (b = -0.400) is essentially the same as the coefficient of
the gender variable obtained when regressing the negative emotions felt when wearing a face
covering over the gender variable only (b = -0.398). In sum, gender differences in negative
emotions felt from wearing the face covering do not seem to be explained by gender
differences in the subjective likelihood of getting infected and, in case so, of getting over it
easily; on the other hand, gender differences in these two variables partly explain gender
differences in intentions to wear a face covering.
Exploratory analysis
As additional exploratory analysis, we would like to better understand the reasons why men
tend to feel stronger negative emotions when wearing a face covering. Understanding this
might help think about particular interventions focused to promote the use of face covering
among men. To this end, we look at gender differences at the item level. We find gender
differences in all items: when people are asked whether they agree with the statement
“wearing a face covering is cool” (b = 0.249, p = 0.032), when people are asked whether they
agree with the statement “wearing a face covering is not cool” (b = -0.363, p = 0.006), when

people are asked whether they agree with the statement “wearing a face covering is
shameful” (b = -0.472, p < .001), when people are asked whether they agree with the
statement “wearing a face covering is a sign of weakness” (b = -0.481, p < .001), and when
people are asked whether they agree with the statement “the stigma attached to wearing a
face covering is preventing me from wearing one as often as I should” (b = -0.489, p < .001).
These results are robust to the inclusion of all the other demographic controls.
Discussion
Now that several countries are moving towards relaxing shelter-in-place rules, it is important
that people engage in preventive behaviors, such as wearing a face covering, to avoid that the
coronavirus disease (COVID-19) starts exponentially spreading again. To promote adherence
to this rule, laws or mandates should be supplemented with behavioral interventions.
Here, we reported an online experiment with a heterogeneous, although not representative,
large sample of people living in the USA, where we tested the relative effect of messages
highlighting that the coronavirus is a threat to “you” vs “your family” vs “your community”
vs “your country” on self-reported intentions to wear a face covering. Results show that
focusing on “your community” is better than the baseline; we also find a common trend such
that focusing on “your community” seems to be slightly more effective than focusing on
“you”, “your family” and “your country”, but none of the pairwise comparisons were
statistically significant (only the one vs. “your family” was marginally significant).
These results are similar to those presented by Jordan et al. (2020), although weaker.
Specifically, Jordan et al. found that focusing on “your community” promotes intentions to
engage in preventive behaviors compared to the “baseline” (as we also do) and compared to
focusing on “you” (in our case we find a non-significant trend). Our design differs from
Jordan et al.’s in two regards. First, in their experiment, participants do not only read a
message but are also shown a flier, which might have contributed to increase the size of the
effect. The second difference regards the dependent variable: Jordan et al. (2020) use a set of
prevention measures (handwashing, avoid touching one’s own face, etc.) that is disjoint from
our set of measures. Therefore, it is also possible that Jordan et al.’s results simply do not
extend to our measure. In any case, putting together our results and those of Jordan et al.
(2020) we can conclude that focusing on “your community” promotes intentions to engage in
several preventive behaviors compared to the baseline. This can be a useful recommendation
for leaders and policy makers.
Our pre-registered analysis of gender differences revealed a number of interesting results.
Men less than women intend to wear a face covering. This is true especially in counties
where wearing a face covering is not mandatory. Indeed, in counties in which wearing the
face covering is mandatory, gender differences in intentions to wear a face covering almost
disappear. This suggests that making wearing a face covering mandatory has a larger effect
on men than on women. Moreover, we found that gender differences in intentions to wear a
face covering are mediated by the subjective likelihood to get the disease and by the
subjective likelihood to get over it more easily than not, in case one gets it. In other words,
the fact that men less than women intend to wear a face covering can be partly explained by
the fact that men more than women believe that they will be relatively unaffected by the
disease. This is particularly ironic because official statistics show that actually the
coronavirus (COVID-19) impacts men more seriously than women. For example, 60% of the
deaths are men (Cai, 2020; Chen et al. 2020).

We also found that more men than women tend to report negative emotions when wearing a
face covering. Moreover, negative emotions when wearing a face covering mediates gender
differences in the intentions to wear a face covering. However, interestingly, gender
differences in negative emotions felt when wearing a face covering does not seem to depend
on whether wearing a face covering is mandatory. In other words, making the wear of a face
covering mandatory changes the self-reported intentions to wear a face covering, but not the
self-reported emotions felt when wearing it. Moreover, we found that the self-reported
negative emotions felt when wearing a face covering were not mediated by the likelihood to
get the disease and by the likelihood to get over it easily in case one gets it. We also
conducted some exploratory analyses to test in which specific items of the “negative
emotions felt when wearing a face covering” scale the gender differences were concentrated.
We found that men more than women disagree with the statement “wearing a face covering is
cool” and agree with the statements: “wearing a face covering is not cool” “wearing a face
covering is shameful”, “wearing a face covering is sign of weakness”, and “the stigma
attached to wearing a face covering is preventing [them] from wearing one as often as [they]
should”. This suggests that future interventions to promote the use of a face covering among
men can try to act on decreasing these negative emotions. More generally, future work can
test whether priming the use of reason vs emotion (Levine et al. 2018; Capraro, Everett &
Earp, 2019; Caviola & Capraro, 2020) can be effective at increasing intentions to use face
covering among men.
We conclude with a theoretical observation. Apart from the baseline and the “you” condition,
all other conditions (your family, your community, your country) use moral messages that are
based on a combination of the harm/care dimension (threat) and the ingroup/loyalty
dimension (your family, your community, your country) of morality (Graham et al. 2013;
Haidt, 2012; Haidt & Joseph, 2004). While these are important dimensions of morality, they
are not the only ones (Graham et al. 2013; Haidt, 2012; Haidt & Joseph, 2004; Curry, 2016;
Curry et al. 2019). Future research could test moral messages tapping other dimensions of
morality.

Appendix. Analysis of the intentions to practice physical distance
We build the composite variable intentions to practice physical distancing by taking the
average of its four items (a = 0.902). Figure A1 reports the mean value of this variable, split
by condition (error bars represent standard error of the mean). As pre-registered, we make
pairwise comparisons using Wilcoxon rank-sum to test for differences across conditions. We
find no significant differences (all p’s > 0.3).

Figure 3. Mean values of the “intentions to practice physical distancing” variable, split by
condition. Error bars represent standard errors of the means.

For completeness, we also report the full regression.
