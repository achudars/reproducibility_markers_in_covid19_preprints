Abstract
During pandemic events, strategies such as social distancing can be fundamental to reduce simultaneous infections
and mitigate the disease spreading, which is very relevant to the risk of a healthcare system collapse. Although these
strategies can be recommended, or even imposed, their actual implementation may depend on the population perception
of the risks associated with a potential infection. The current COVID-19 crisis, for instance, is showing that some
individuals are much more prone than others to remain isolated. To better understand these dynamics, we propose
an epidemiological SIR model that uses evolutionary game theory for combining in a single process social strategies,
individual risk perception, and viral spreading. In particular, we consider a disease spreading through a population,
whose agents can choose between self-isolation and a lifestyle careless of any epidemic risk. The strategy adoption is
individual and depends on the perceived disease risk compared to the quarantine cost. The game payoff governs the
strategy adoption, while the epidemic process governs the agent’s health state. At the same time, the infection rate
depends on the agent’s strategy while the perceived disease risk depends on the fraction of infected agents. Our results
show recurrent infection waves, which are usually seen in previous historic epidemic scenarios with voluntary quarantine.
In particular, such waves re-occur as the population reduces disease awareness. Notably, the risk perception is found
to be fundamental for controlling the magnitude of the infection peak, while the final infection size is mainly dictated
by the infection rates. Low awareness leads to a single and strong infection peak, while a greater disease risk leads to
shorter, although more frequent, peaks. The proposed model spontaneously captures relevant aspects of a pandemic
event, highlighting the fundamental role of social strategies.

1. Introduction
During a pandemic, quarantine and other distancing
rules can constitute the only option to curb the viral spreading, in particular in absence of vaccines or medicines to
control the symptoms resulting from an infection [1–4].
Usually, these social rules are defined by epidemiologists
and other experts, however their actual implementation
can be quite challenging. For instance, the current COVID19 crisis [5–7] is showing how some people are more easily
prone to self-isolate under voluntary quarantine than others, even despite evidences on the potential risks. By doing
so, individuals that avoid any form of restriction become
an element of risk for themselves and for their community.
In these scenarios, understanding how to stimulate and
sustain prosocial behaviors has a paramount relevance. In
this work, we aim to study the relationship between human
behavior, represented by individual quarantining strategies, and the epidemic spreading of a disease. We emphasize that this model is not an empirical description of the

current COVID-19 evolution. Instead, this is a general
theoretical framework that merges evolutionary game theory (EGT) [8] and epidemiology in a single compartmental
model. Such framework allows rational strategy changes
between agents and can be used to better understand the
central aspects regarding a generic epidemic event. Note
that this model focus on voluntary self-imposed quarantines only. Such strategy is different from policy-driven
quarantines, where the government can apply contact tracing and other methods to enforce the isolation of specific
individuals that were shown to be infected, or potentially
infectious [9–11].
Usually, the approach for studying a pandemic or epidemic process is based on compartmental models [4, 12,
13], which are a ubiquitous tool in epidemiology and modern health management systems. The SIR model is one
of the most known epidemiological models [4, 12, 14].
It describes the spreading of a disease, which confers immunity against re-infection, in agents that evolve from the
susceptible compartment, S, to the infectious, I, and eventually to the recovered (or removed) compartment R. Although simple, it has been widely used to obtain relevant

aspects of epidemic processes that present the S → I → R
structure. Since its introduction in the seminal paper by
Kermack and McKendrick [15], the model has been extensively studied and expanded to consider different hypotheses and conditions. For example, some epidemics may
require more compartments, such as the exposed and/or
asymptomatic agents (known as SEIR and SEAIR models respectively) [4, 16–18]. Spread on complex networks
was also proven useful to understand the heterogeneity of
agent contacts [19–23]. The study of control and mitigation strategies such as vaccination [24], modeling of
vector-borne diseases [25, 26], and effects of birth-anddeath dynamics [2, 12] are other examples of the wide
range of applications for compartmental models in epidemiology. Even rumors and corruption spreading have
found a natural framework in the SIR model [27–33]. Nevertheless, most of those models relate only to the disease
evolution, i.e. agents usually have no conscious actions regarding the disease. On the other hand, many control measures for infectious diseases depend on individual decision
making. In this context, the recent field of behavioral epidemiology is attracting the attention of researchers from
diverse areas, applying psychology, social engineering, and
game theory approaches to epidemiology (see [2, 14, 34]
for a review). Instead of considering agents having static
roles, behavioral epidemiology includes dynamic behavior
changes. This is a fertile ground for the recent area of social dynamics, or sociophysics [35–37], which utilizes tools
from statistical physics together with evolutionary game
theory (and others) to better understand the complex behavior of humans [7, 38–44]. For example, in a novel
approach, Bauch [45–47] integrated a SIR model into an
EGT framework to analyze vaccination decision dynamics. By doing so, agents change their vaccination strategy
dynamically, depending on their perception of the benefits and costs of a vaccine. This was later generalized into
the so-called ‘vaccination games’ framework (see [24] for
a comprehensive review). Such approach led to many interesting observations and predictions in vaccination protocols [14, 47–60].
Recent works also investigated other mitigation strategies such as awareness campaigns [61], wealth differences
[62, 63], economic incentives [64], social distancing [65,
66], information spreading [67, 68], multi-layer contact
networks [69], dynamic contacts [70] and others [71–75].
A general overview of these investigations shows the presence of a cycle, where effective mitigation measures lead
to a low risk perception, which in turn weakens said mitigation strategies, bringing the disease back [2]. The most
recent anti-vaccination movement is just one of a long history of such cycles [76–78]. Unfortunately, vaccination is
not always an option, and social isolation can be the only
practice to prevent further disease spread [1, 2, 79, 80].
Such was the case in the famous episodes of the Spanish flu
[81, 82], SARS epidemic of 2002–2003 [83, 84] and more
recently, during the COVID-19 pandemic [3, 6, 75, 85–88].
In the present work, we propose a “quarantine game”,

in which agents undergo a SIR epidemic process while,
at the same time, they can choose between two actions,
i.e. to self-quarantine and voluntarily stay at home (Q),
or continue acting normally (N). Following the game theory usual nomenclature, here we use the word strategy
as meaning the agent’s chosen action (quarantine or not).
The strategy is constantly updated based on the individual perceived cost of the quarantine versus the perceived
disease risk. While the scope of the model is intentionally
general, it is mainly motivated by the recent COVID-19
global pandemic and its consequences, that have shown a
wide spectrum of human responses to the viral spreading.
For instance, countries adopted many different restriction
policies, from mild distancing rules to strict lock-down.
However, when not mandatory, only a small fraction of
individuals may decide to self-isolate, while the rest of
a community avoids restrictions, endangering themselves
and others. The fast scale of this phenomenon has also
shown how collective perceptions of the disease risk has
changed in a matter of weeks (based or not on real scientific data) [89]. This can be seen from how individuals and
policymakers across the world have so far considered a variety of options, spanning from strict lock-downs to doing
nothing, with the hope of reaching some kind of herd immunity [90–92]. The variety of social strategies adopted
worldwide, and in particular their results in terms of successes and failures, constitute a relevant evidence of how
important is the behavioral component of a given strategy
during pandemic events.
Lastly, we emphasise that this is a theoretical model,
and in no way intends to fully grasp all the social and
political complexities exhibited by the current pandemic
scenario [93]. On the contrary, it aims to merge two elements of paramount relevance in these scenarios, i.e. game
theory and epidemic spreading, on a singular time scale.
2. Model
In the proposed model, susceptible agents (S) become
infected (I) with a rate βi upon contact with another infected agent. Then, at a constant rate γ, infected agents
get recovered (R). Besides, agents can self-impose a quarantine (Q) and stay at home, or keep acting as in a normal situation (N). In the language of game theory, the
former strategy, can be interpreted as a form of cooperation, while the latter as a selfish behavior, i.e. a form
of defection. Therefore, we shall refer interchangeably to
agents adopting quarantine as cooperators, and agents acting normally, as defectors. We note that in reality, the epidemiological term quarantine is only applicable to someone
that is not infected and chooses to stay at home. If someone is infected and chooses this action, the correct term
would be isolation. Nevertheless, for simplicity, here we
name this strategy as self-quarantine for both susceptible
and infected agents, as such differentiation in the equations would lead only to a more complex nomenclature.
The main effect of the chosen action is to influence the
2

strategy N , have a perceived risk based on their infection probability multiplied by the perceived disease cost
parameter δ:
πN = −δβN I.

We remark that the payoffs are based exclusively on
the agent’s individual perceptions. This is in accordance
with the widespread notion of individual risk perception
based on the number of (anecdotal) cases an agent is exposed to [68, 94–96]. The game theory dynamics concerns
what agents perceive to be their risks and rewards, and not
necessarily the actual risk of a given action. It is also interesting to understand how the model considers infection
sub-notifications, i.e. general population perception of the
fraction I being lower than the actual level. By using a
linear payoff structure, sub-notifications can be absorbed
in a re-scaled δ 0 value. E.g., if the informed infected fraction of the population is sub-notified by a fraction f , the
payoff structure would be the same, while the re-scaled
perceived risk would just be δ 0 = δ(1 − f ). Note that the
sub-notification only affects the payoff function, while the
epidemiological dynamics still depends only on the actual
fraction of infected individuals.
Following the usual evolutionary game dynamics, the
probability of a given agent i to adopt the strategy of agent
j is related to their payoffs πi and πj . We use the typical
Fermi rule [8]:

Figure 1: Schematic representation of the proposed model. We consider five compartments where agents transition from S, I, and R
states through epidemiological dynamics. At the same time, agents
change their own strategy (Q or N ) through an evolutionary game
dynamics. The parameter βi is the infection rate that, depending
on the strategy of an agent, is defined as βQ or βN (i.e. quarantine
versus normal life stile). Also note that infected individuals of one
given strategy can interact with susceptible individuals of the other
strategy, e.g. SQ − IN , by the cross-infection rate βa , further explained in the text. The parameter γ represents the recovery rate
and is independent of the specific strategy. Φ represents the strategy change flux for each epidemic state and it is governed by the
evolutionary game dynamics.

individual infection rate βi . We assume that quarantined
agents have a lower infection rate than normal ones, that
is βQ < βN , since those agents reduce their interactions
with other members of their community. Also, note that
although rare, cross-interactions between the two types of
strategies (quarantine or not) can still occur in our model,
e.g. SQ becomes infected by interacting with an IN individual. The cross-infection rate βa is used in such scenarios and we expect that, in general, βQ < βa < βN . Deep
explanation of such parameter is given in the following
paragraphs. We expand the usual SIR model into a five
compartment model, SQ , SN , IQ IN , and R. As recovered
agents cannot be infected again, their chosen strategy is
irrelevant. An illustrative diagram is shown in Figure 1.
By using a compartmental approach, the evolutionary
game dynamics is fully integrated into the model. This differs from usual behavioral epidemiology approaches where
the strategy fraction evolves according to a separate dynamic [2, 24, 46, 55, 65, 66, 71, 72]. Hence, our model
allows cross interactions (such as SQ interacting with IN ),
giving rise to a rich scenario where sub-population correlations can be observed.
Employing the game theory concept of perceived payoff (π), agents base their strategies on the perceived risk
of their current action. A cooperator (i.e. an agent selfimposing quarantine) expects to suffer a perceived cost Ω.
This represents the difficulties one might face in a period
of quarantine, but in turn, it strongly reduces the probability of being infected. This leads to a constant payoff (or
perceived risk) for cooperators, Q:
πQ = −Ω.

This allows strategy revision with a small but non zero
chance of mistakes. Such irrationality is measured by the
k parameter, set as k = 0.1 [8, 37, 97]. To obtain the total fraction of agents changing to a given strategy at any
moment, we consider the number of encounters between
any kind of Q and N strategies, inside each health compartment (S or I), and multiply it by the strategy transition probability Θ(πi , πj ) between strategies i and/or j.
This is equivalent to the master equation (for each compartment) of an evolutionary game dynamic [8, 98] using
the mean-field approximation, and leads us to the strategy
conversion rates, defined as
ΦS = SQ (SN + IN )Θ(πQ , πN ) − SN (SQ + IQ )Θ(πN , πQ ) (4)
ΦI = IQ (SN + IN )Θ(πQ , πN ) − IN (SQ + IQ )Θ(πN , πQ ). (5)

Here, ΦS is the rate at which SQ agents convert to SN
(and conversely for ΦI ), and it is governed by the EGT
part of the model.
Regarding the infection dynamics, we assume three different infection rates, that is, βN > βa > βQ . Here, βN
is the infection rate for defectors interacting with defectors, and similarly, βQ is the infection rate for cooperators. Cooperators and defectors interact through the crossinfection rate βa . For the sake of simplicity we set βa =
a(βN + βQ )/2, an average value of βQ and βN weighted
by the external control parameter 1 > a > 0. We set

where τ is the coupling parameter that controls how
quickly one adopts a new strategy, in relation to the timescale of the epidemic. Note that the current version of
the model does not include vital dynamics, such as birth
and death processes, since the model focuses on spread
dynamics that take place in a matter of months.

Figure 2: Typical behavior of the epidemiological population, S =
(SQ + SN ), I = (IQ + IN ), R. Note that recurrent infection peaks
emerge spontaneously. Here δ = 10, βN = 10.

The numerical integration of the equations is obtained
through a 4th order Runge–Kutta method. For the interested reader, a simplified Python script for solving the
equations is available at [105]. Regarding the results, unless stated otherwise, we set Ω = 1, τ = 1, γ = 1, βQ =
1, k = 0.1, a = 0.1 and focus on the effects of varying the
infection risk perception, δ, and defectors infection rate
βN . As initial condition, the starting setting for the population has only a very small fraction of infected agents,
i.e. I0 = 0.01, S0 = 1 − I0 ., while strategies are equally
divided between C and D.
Figure 2 presents the typical behavior of the population. The most evident phenomenon is the recurrent infection waves, even though the model has no explicit oscillatory terms. Looking at the evolution of the epidemiological
population, i.e. S = (SQ + SN ), I = (IQ + IN ), and R, we
notice that susceptible agents diminish on almost discrete
steps. The successive drops in S also coincide with the
peaks of infected agents. The inclusion of voluntary quarantine procedures in the SIR model spontaneously generates recurrent infection periods. This phenomenon can
be observed for a wide range of parameters and it is a
characteristic behavior of the model. Note that such an
effect is similar to the expected scenario of real quarantine
policies [2, 3, 85], that is, re-occurring infection seasons.
Interestingly, previous pandemics as the Spanish flu (1918)
presented such infection wave behavior [106, 107].
The cause underlying the successive infection peaks can
be understood looking at the sub-population (SQ , SN , IQ , IN , R)
and the strategy distributions through time. This can be
seen in Figure 3. Remarkably, the population behavior
hides a complex dynamic. In particular, as the fraction
of infected agents initially grows, the cooperator’s payoff quickly becomes advantageous. This is what causes
the first broad peak of SQ , as most agents start to undergo quarantine. In turn, the total fraction of infected
agents begin to decline, as the majority of the population
gets quarantined, with a low value of infection rate. Nev-

3. Results
We start by noting that the payoff structure proposed
in Eqs. (1) and (2), is akin to the public goods and climate
change dilemma games [99–102] where each agent payoff
depends on the total number of agents in some other state.
That is, the quarantine game is not a pairwise interaction
game such as the prisoner dilemma [8]. In particular, in
our case, the defector payoff depends on the total number of infected agents (I), either cooperators or defectors,
while the cooperator payoff is constant. In doing so, we obtain the collective equivalent of the snow-drift game (also
known as chicken or hawk-dove game [8]), i.e. as long
as most of the population is healthy (susceptible or recovered), the best strategy is to defect and to continue acting
normally. But as soon as most of the population chooses
this strategy, the amount of infected agents grows, resulting in a change of the best strategy, that becomes to selfquarantine. It is also worth mentioning that such scenario
is akin to the minority-game (or El Farol Bar dilemma )
[74, 103, 104], where each single individual receives the
optimal payoff if she chooses the least chosen strategy on
average. Such payoff structure can be seen as a general
anti-coordination game class, where the best strategy is
to do the opposite of what your opponents are doing. Or
specifically in our case, the opposite of what the majority of the population is doing [8]. However, note that
the fraction of infected agents is not equal to the fraction of defectors, due to the epidemiology dynamics. This
is similar to the dilemma presented in vaccination games
[45, 46, 53, 55, 94] where agents should vaccinate but, as
long as the majority of the population is vaccinated, the
incentive to not vaccinate grows. This anti-coordination
element is a central driver for the observed oscillatory dynamics.

Figure 3: Typical behavior of the sub-population, SQ , SN , IQ , IN , R.
The successive infection peaks are due to the frequent oscillations in
the strategies, even if the total susceptible and removed individuals
do not oscillate. Here, δ = 10, βN = 10.

Figure 4: Infected agents (I) and defectors strategy fraction (D) time
evolution. The horizontal line represents the value I 0 = Ω/δβN . The
vertical dashed lines indicate when I(t) = I 0 . As expected, these are
the strategy maximum and minimum values. Here δ = 10, βN = 5.

ertheless, as I tends to 0, the payoff for agents leaving
quarantine (defector strategy) starts to grow and eventually it becomes greater than the cooperator’s payoff. This
triggers a flux of SQ → SN , that is, people leaving quarantine. Such an event corresponds to the sharp increase in
SN , near the beginning of the second infection wave. With
more and more agents leaving quarantine, a second peak of
infected agents inevitably occurs. Indeed, we see that the
infection peaks are always preceded by a sharp increase in
the defector density. At this point, SN begins to decrease
sharply because part of them becomes infected and the
others (still susceptible) start becoming cooperators (the
second and broad peak in SQ ). This process repeats itself
again and again, at each time with less active agents. An
interesting effect also occurs in the sub-population of infected agents, i.e. the infection peak on defectors always
precedes the peak of cooperators. We note that the number and height of the peaks, and recurrent infection cycles,
are highly dependent on δ.
Next, we analyze the mixed strategy equilibrium point
to obtain the strategy inflection points. This is a similar
approach as the one used in [47] for vaccination games.
Suppose a mixed strategy where an agent has a probability
P to cooperate. This leads to the average expected payoff
of π̄ = P πQ + (1 − P )πN . We want to maximize it in
relation to P , therefore:

In a system composed of fully rational agents, the strategy maximum and minimum values will coincide with the
points mentioned above. Numerical analysis of the ODE
integration shows good agreement with such prediction
even if we use the Fermi strategy probability (an approach
that has inherent fluctuations/irrationality). This can be
seen in Figure 4. We note that the main effect of greater
irrationality, i.e. larger values of k, is to make the strategy oscillations more smooth around the inflection points.
This analysis remained accurate for all studied values of
δ, Ω, and βN . Also, note that the peak of infections always
happens between a maximum and minimum value of D,
in a way consistent with all studied values of parameters.
To better understand the effect of the disease risk perceptions on the infection peak size and duration, we vary
the value of δ, as this is the central parameter we are interested in. Figure 5 shows the population dynamics when
δ = {0; 5; 10}. For low-risk perceptions, agents leave
quarantine earlier and in great numbers. This creates a
big single infection peak, which is consistent with the current worst-case scenarios for a pandemic [2, 3, 85]. As we
increase the risk perception, agents will tend to cooperate (stay in quarantine) for longer periods, leading to the
distribution of smaller infection peaks along one or more
infection cycles. We highlight that this is an emergent
behavior that spontaneously appears by considering the
evolutionary game dynamics. In a pandemic scenario, this
can be one of the most important aspects of a quarantine
policy, since the healthcare system may have a small capacity, and cannot take care of all infected agents at the
same time [13].
The central characteristic of the model is the spontaneous emergence of recurrent infection waves during an
epidemic without the possibility of re-infection (SIR). While
this is not an empirical model, it is insightful to look
for similar general patterns in real data from the current
COVID-19 crisis. Figure 6 presents the actual data (ob-

π̄ = P (δβN I − Ω) − δβN I.

(11)

Since all parameters are greater than zero, we obtain
the maximum expected payoff value when P = 1 (always
cooperate) if δβN I > Ω. Conversely, if δβN I < Ω, the
maximum average payoff occurs for P = 0 (always defect).
This implies that agents will start changing strategies at
an infection level of:

While the presented model do not aim to be an empirical fit, it is
remarkable to see how the general behavior of secondary infection
waves is present. Data obtained from [108].

tained from [108]) of four different countries, regarding the
reported number of new cases (×10) and the total number of infected individuals. Such numbers are equivalent
to the fractions of I and R in our model respectively. It
is possible to see a remarkable similarity in the general
behaviour of the model with the presented data regarding the infection peaks, as well as the stair-like increase
in the total number of cases. Nevertheless, we stress that
here we are not trying to fit the real data to our model,
just observe how the general behaviour present similarities. This can also be seen in data from other countries, as
the ones presented in [109] and from the major data banks
like [108].
The effects of different disease perception values are
summarized in Figure 7. Note that when δ = 16 there are
even five different infection peaks, all with a very small
magnitude. Another interesting effect to observe is that
the first infection peak is not always the highest. For larger
values of δ, the highest peak can happen after some initial

We emphasize that the infection peak magnitude can
be a very important quantity when dealing with pandemics
[13]. In Figure 8 we present the maximum simultaneous
infection size (Imax ) as a function of the perceived disease
risk for different defector infection rates, βN . We highlight
that the equations of the proposed model can always be
normalized in relation to βQ , defining a new time scale.
Because of this, without loss of generality, we chose to
vary only βN in the presented results. We see that the
disease awareness, δ, can greatly help diminish the maximum simultaneous infected number. On the other hand,
the effect of βN in Imax is less pronounced.
We now analyze the infection size, measured by the final density of removed agents, R∗ , shown in Figure 9. We
note that the increase in δ can lead, on average, to slightly
smaller R∗ values. The decrease is more pronounced when
βN < 2. Differently from Imax however, the behavior of
R∗ is not monotonous in δ, presenting non-periodic oscillations.

Next we present the parameter space βN ×δ for the final
density of removed agents, R∗ in Figure 10. As expected,
increased disease risk perceptions leads to a smaller final
density of removed agents. Nevertheless, it is clear that
this behavior is not trivial, and different infection rates
result in large oscillations. It is interesting to note that the
valleys and peaks follow, on average, an inverse proportion
with δ. For instance, for a fixed value of R∗ , βN ∝ 1/δ.
Note that the value of Imax is highly dependent on δ but
does not change considerably with βN .
As τ is the coupling constant between the epidemic
and evolutionary game dynamics, it is correlated with how
quickly a population is able to respond to new information
regarding the current disease situation. Figure 11 reports
the effects of different τ in the evolution of the strategies.
Notably, increasing its value causes strategy changes to
become more frequent. This in turn entails more oscillations in the whole population. Every peak in the defector
density also leads, eventually, to a peak in the density of
infected agents, I. Variations in τ do not change the final
infection size considerably. We also note that variations
in the irrationality parameter, k, did not drastically affect the dynamics for reasonable values (0.01 < k < 2).
The main effect of decreasing k is to make the strategy
adoption curves sharper around the inflection points. On
the other hand, a high irrationality parameter makes the
strategy changes more smoothly in time.
Finally, we generalize the results of the proposed model
according to the evolutionary game theory framework. It
is a known result that the strategy equilibrium of a classical game is invariant in relation to the multiplication
and/or sum of a constant value over all payoffs [8]. Therefore, we can simplify the proposed payoff structure, leaving
intact the central characteristics of the game. This allows
us to obtain relevant information regarding the general

Figure 11: Strategy adoption evolution for different coupling constant values τ . In a) we present a value corresponding to half the time-scale
of the epidemics, i.e. τ = 0.5. Figure b) presents a time-scale twice as fast, τ = 2. The peaks in the defector fraction always correlates to
peaks in the total infected population I. Greater τ values leads to more frequent oscillations in the strategy distribution, and consequently
more infection peaks with lower heights. Here we used δ = 10, βN = 10.

off structure is. Given that one can re-scale and sum all
payoffs by a given constant, the central point of an anticoordination game is to have incentives that lead players
to do the opposite of the majority. This can be achieved
by the general structure in Eqs. (13) and (14), where one
strategy has a constant payoff and the other decreases as
more agents choose said strategy. This is particularly interesting when looking at mitigation models [34, 55, 72,
110] that consider the cooperator payoff as also depending
on the number of infected individuals. For a general case,
0
0
we could propose that πQ
= −aI − b and πN
= −cI − d,
with all constants being greater than zero, and c > a, as
in most mitigation game models [2, 55, 72, 110]. We can

= −(c − a)I.
= −b + d , πN
re-scale such payoff so πQ
In other words, apart from the constant naming, if we call
b + d = Ω and c − a = δβN , we get our model back. In
the context of game theory, as long as Ω < δβN , the payoff always grows as one chooses the less frequent strategy,
maintaining the anti-coordination game.
It is also possible to show that the model is different
from the SIR model with two distinct infection rates. Using the definition S = SQ + SN and I = IQ + IN we see
that:

game class. We first sum Ω in both payoffs and then divide them by βN δ. Using  = Ω/βN δ, we get the simplified
version:

πQ = 0.

(13)

πN =  − I.

(14)

Note that  is the ratio between the perceived cost of
quarantine and the cost of getting infected. By definition,
0 <  < 1 as we always expect Ω < βN δ, i.e. the cost of
performing a quarantining is smaller than that of being infected. This general payoff structure correctly predicts the
most essential feature of our model, i.e. the best strategy
is to stay on quarantine if there are many infected agents
(I > ), and leave quarantine in the opposite case. This
is very similar to the anti-coordination game class, where
the best strategy is to do the opposite of your opponent.
Here, however, the main factor to consider is the number
of infected agents, and not of quarantined ones.
If everyone is undergoing a quarantine, one has a big
incentive to avoid such strategy. On the other hand, if
everyone is not taking quarantine precautions, one has a
big incentive to do so. This general payoff structure is
similar to the free-ride scenario obtained in vaccination
games [55, 94] and other models with mitigation policies [51, 61, 65, 66, 71, 72, 110]. The inflection point
where defection becomes more advantageous can be clearly
stated as I 0 = . Differently from a classic game, however,
I = I(t), that is, the number of infected agents in our
model is time dependent and will depend on the number
of agents using the strategy Q or N . Note however that
such payoff manipulation only makes the classic game equilibrium invariant, not its evolutionary counterpart. For
the population dynamics, the payoff multiplication has the
equivalent effect of changing the value of k in the transition
probability, (3), i.e. k 0 = kβN δ.
We also deem important to state how general this pay-

Ṡ = −IQ (βa SN + βQ SQ ) − IN (βN SN + βa SQ )
(15)
˙
I = IQ (βa SN + βQ SQ ) + IN (βN SN + βa SQ ) − γI (16)
Ṙ = γI

(17)

Since the flux (Φ) terms regard only transitions between
the same epidemiological compartment, they vanish when
we look only at the total epidemiological level of the population. Even so, we see that the model does not reduce to
the SIR model with two infection rates. Indeed we cannot
totally disappear with the sub-population terms.
Furthermore, we can also consider the population at
the level of strategy adoption dynamics. C and D represent the density of cooperators and defectors respectively.
For the proposed model we have C = (SQ + IQ )/(S + I),
8

and since we only have two strategies, D = 1−C. The rate
of change in the strategies comes only from the strategy
flux terms ΦS and ΦI . In other words, Ċ = −ΦS − ΦI .
Using Equations (4) and (5), we obtain:

studied in evolutionary game theory. Nevertheless, the infection rates depend on the chosen strategy, whereas the
risk perception and payoff of each strategy depend on the
number of infected individuals.
We investigate the model through numerical and analytical approaches. Remarkably, the model presents individual reactions to the disease infection level, which can
result in secondary infections and the re-emergence of the
disease spreading after most of the population dismiss its
risk. In particular, our results revealed multiple infection
peaks for higher disease risk perceptions, very similar to
the observed behavior of past epidemic cases with voluntary quarantine measures. The interplay between the contagion and strategy dynamics exhibited a rich behavior.
The main parameter that we studied in the model is the
perceived disease risk, δ, i.e. a measure of how strongly
the population sees the individual cost of being infected.
We show that while this parameter has a small effect on
the final infection size, it is most important concerning the
infection peak size. Notably, the maximum magnitude of
the infection peak is found to be inversely proportional to
the disease perceive risk δ.
It is worth to emphasize that for no perceived disease
risk, agents decide to avoid quarantine and the population
quickly suffers from a widespread infection, resulting in a
single and huge peak of simultaneously infected agents. As
recent events related to the global COVID-19 pandemic
have shown, the total infection peak is an observable of
paramount relevance. In particular, during these critical
scenarios, healthcare systems may risk to collapse, due to
the possibility that the amount of infected individuals saturates their total capacity [13]. That is one of the reasons
why not only the total epidemic size is important, but also
the maximum number of simultaneous infections. In the
proposed model, the inclusion of the perceived disease risk
makes individuals prone to quarantine for longer times,
resulting in a smaller infection peak. As we increase the
perceived risk, multiple smaller peaks emerge. This is a
direct result of the interconnection between two complex
processes, i.e. disease spreading by the SIR model, and
rational strategy choices by the evolutionary game dynamics. We see that for high values of δ, the disease can stay
active for longer times and present more infection waves.
Nevertheless, those peaks are shorter and the maximum
number of simultaneous infections is highly dependent on
δ, quickly diminishing as the disease risk perception increases.
We also perform a payoff analysis to find the optimum
mixed strategy for a given number of infected individuals.
This allows us to analytically obtain the inflection point
of the strategy adoption dynamics. This may be used to
understand both the dependence of the most used strategy
as a function of the infection number, and when the next
infection wave can emerge again. Analyzing other parameters we find that the coupling constant τ is responsible
for changing the speed of the population response to new
infections, i.e. how fast the strategy adoption occurs, but

Ċ = (SN + IN )(SQ + IQ )Θ(πN , πQ )
− (SQ + IQ )(SN + IN )Θ(πQ , πN )
Re-arranging the terms and noting that SQ + IQ =
C(S + I) , SN + IN = D(S + I), and that S + I = 1 − R,
we finally obtain:
Ċ

=

(1 − R)2 CD[Θ(πN , πQ ) − Θ(πQ , πN )]

(18)

The first term, (1 − R)2 , modulates the speed of the
strategy change (Ċ), as it is related to the total available
population allowed to vary the strategies. Most important, however, is the rest of the equation, which is precisely
the usual mean-field form of the master equation for the
evolution of cooperation in a two strategy game, such as
the prisoner’s dilemma [8]. We can observe that the proposed model is self-consistent and returns the evolutionary
game when we only look at the strategy densities. At the
same time, (numerically) the model also returns the classic SIR dynamics with two infection rates when we make
τ = βa = 0, i.e. when we turn off the strategy dynamics
and cross infection terms.
4. Conclusions
A common approach to analyze complex systems is to
isolate its essential elements and features, trying to filter
out less relevant components. Such is the case of social
behaviors and disease spreading, two intricate processes
that, mainly for the sake of simplicity, are often analyzed
separately. In order to describe their dynamics, identifying
their essential elements and interactions, it is fundamental
to define a model able to capture, as much as possible,
the observed phenomena while maintaining its simplicity.
Due to the relevance of the behavioral component, in particular epidemic situations such as the COVID-19 crisis,
here we proposed a theoretical framework devised to combine social strategies with epidemic spreading. To this
end, we present a simplified version of the epidemiological
SIR model merged with an evolutionary game that allows
agents to rationally choose between a voluntary quarantine or a normal lifestyle during the spreading of a generic
disease. Following this approach, we obtain a single compartmental model that integrates into the same time scale
the rational decision making, from game theory, and the
epidemiological dynamics of the SIR model. The latter has
been chosen as a test case, however, the proposed model
can also be realized considering other variations, as the SIS
and SEAIR models, as well as other game theory frameworks. The infection and recovery rates are given by the
epidemiological dynamics, while the strategy changes are
controlled by the so-called strategy update rules, widely
9

has no strong effect on the infection peak size. In the same
way, the irrationality parameter k can change the properties of the strategy adoption dynamics without changing
its inflection points or the infection peak size. Lastly, we
show that the model is self-consistent and returns the usual
replicator equation when looking only at the strategy fractions of the population dynamics. Likewise, when we turn
off the interactions between the populations (τ = βa = 0)
we get back two separated SIR populations, evolving independently.
Overall, the achieved results point to the importance
of the disease perceived risk in the spreading dynamics
and how such an ingredient can be included in more realistic modeling. The area of behavioral epidemiology is
relatively recent, and evolutionary game theory and sociophysics seem to have much to add with their approaches.
As examples, we cite recent works that have highlighted
how evolutionary game dynamics can be used together
with an epidemiology-based approach to model social contact behavior such as corruption and rumor spreading [27–
29, 31, 111, 112]. In this sense, we believe that this model
can be used as an initial framework to understand more
complex phenomena regarding behavioral epidemiology,
especially the integration of game theory in compartment
models.
