The first confirmed case of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the US was reported on
January 21, 2020. By the end of March, 2020, there were more than 180000 confirmed cases in
the US, distributed across more than 2000 counties. We find that the right tail of this distribution
exhibits a power law, with Pareto exponent close to one. We investigate whether a simple model
of the growth of COVID-19 cases involving Gibrat’s law can explain the emergence of this power
law. The model is calibrated to match (i) the growth rates of confirmed cases, and (ii) the varying
lengths of time during which COVID-19 had been present within each county. Thus calibrated, the
model generates a power law with Pareto exponent nearly exactly equal to the exponent estimated
directly from the distribution of confirmed cases across counties at the end of March.

INTRODUCTION

In the natural and social sciences, a variety of size distributions exhibit a power law in the right tail, meaning
that the fraction of observations whose size S exceeds a
threshold s decays like a power function as that threshold increases: Pr(S > s) ∼ s−ζ for large s. The parameter ζ > 0 is called the Pareto (or power law) exponent.
Examples of distributions exhibiting power laws include
income [1–4], wealth [5, 6], consumption [7, 8], city populations [9–12], firm size [13, 14], family names [15–18],
stock returns [19–21], and numerous others [22–25].
A common feature of models that purport to explain
the prevalence of power laws is the presence of random
multiplicative growth. Loosely, the size St of a quantity
of interest at time t (e.g., wealth, population, firm size,
etc.) is said to exhibit random multiplicative growth if its
(random) growth factor Gt+1 = St+1 /St is independent
of the current size St . This is known among economists as
Gibrat’s law of proportional growth. On its own, Gibrat’s
law is not sufficient to generate a power law. For instance,
a geometric Brownian motion (the continuous-time analogue of a random multiplicative growth process with lognormal growth) stopped at a fixed time has a lognormal
distribution, which does not exhibit a power law. On the
other hand, a geometric Brownian motion stopped at an
exponentially distributed time has a double Pareto distribution, which exhibits a power law in both tails [26]. We
may thus expect to observe a power law in the size distribution of a population whose members have been growing
like geometric Brownian motions since birth, and whose
distribution of ages is exponential. The combination of
Gibrat’s law with an exponential age distribution as a
generative mechanism for power laws has been used extensively in recent economics literature [7, 8, 31–45]. Re-

lated techniques have also been employed in the physics
literature [27–30].
In this paper we study the distribution of confirmed
cases of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) across
US counties. As we will see, by the end of March 2020,
a power law had emerged in the right tail of that distribution. We investigate whether the combination of
Gibrat’s law (for growth in the number of cases within a
county) and a suitable age distribution (for the length of
time since the outbreak in each county) can explain this
power law. Using daily county-level data from the onset
of COVID-19 in the US in January 2020 until the end
of March 2020, we estimate the distributions of growth
rates and ages, employing a gamma parametrization of
the former and a truncated logistic parametrization of the
latter. Our primary finding is that the Pareto exponent
implied by the estimated growth rate and age distributions, which is 0.936, nearly exactly matches the Pareto
exponent estimated directly from the distribution of cases
across counties at the end of March, which is 0.930. This
indicates that the combination of Gibrat’s law with a
suitable age distribution can explain the power law observed in the right tail of the distribution of COVID-19
cases across US counties.
A nice aspect of the COVID-19 data we analyze is that
they span the entire history of confirmed cases in the US
population, thus permitting us to observe the distribution of ages (days since outbreak) across counties. While
there is limited empirical evidence that the age distributions of cities [46] and firms [47] may be approximately
exponential, it is rarely the case that data used in economics and related fields allow a reliable estimate of the
relevant age distribution. Indeed, it can be difficult to unambiguously define the age of a city, firm, or household,
the latter of which is frequently interpreted as a dynastic unit spanning multiple generations. This confounds
validation of the dynamic generative mechanism. Conveniently, our COVID-19 data reveal the entire shape of
the age distribution, which allows us to provide what appears to be the first empirical analysis in which a Pareto

2
exponent is obtained from direct estimates of both the
growth rate and age distributions.
The remainder of our paper is organized as follows.
Sec. II contains theoretical background material. In
Sec. II A we explain how the combination of Gibrat’s
law and an exponential age distribution determines a
Pareto exponent. In Sec. II B we discuss the connection
between Gibrat’s law and a simple model of epidemics.
Sec. III contains our empirical findings. In Sec. III A we
describe our dataset. In Sec. III B we display the distribution of COVID-19 cases across US counties at the
end of March, and report a Pareto exponent estimated
directly from this distribution. In Sec. III C we assess the
empirical plausibility of COVID-19 cases evolving according to Gibrat’s law. In Secs. III D and III E we report our
estimates for the distributions of growth rates and ages
respectively. In Sec. III F we show how to compute the
Pareto exponent implied by those growth rate and age
distributions, and observe that it is close to the Pareto
exponent reported in Sec. III B. Sec. IV contains brief
remarks in nontechnical language summarizing the practical import of our findings. Our data and replication
files are available online [48].

distribution of Y has Laplace transform MY satisfying
MY (z) =

n=1

Suppose that a unit (say, a county) starts with initial size (number of COVID-19 cases) S0 = 1 at t = 0
and grows randomly according to Gibrat’s law of motion
St = Gt St−1 for integer-valued t ≥ 1, where {Gt }∞
t=1
is a sequence of independent and identically distributed
(i.i.d.) positive random variables. Let T be a random
integer-valued time (days since COVID-19 outbreak in
the county), independent of the sequence {Gt }∞
t=1 , at
which the unit size ST is observed. Suppose for now that
T has the geometric distribution (i.e., the discrete-time
analogue of the exponential distribution), meaning that
for n ≥ 1 we have Pr(T = n) = p(1 − p)n−1 for some
parameter p ∈ (0, 1) called a success probability.
What can be said about the right tail of the distribution of ST ? It turns out that, under a regularity condition
on the distribution of the growth rate Xt = ln Gt , the tail
exhibits a power law. Specifically, letting E denote the
expected value operator, we shall assume that the distribution of Xt has Laplace transform M (z) = E(ezXt )
finite for real z ∈ [0, η) and diverging to infinity as z increases to η, where η may be any positive real number
or +∞. Loosely, this means that Xt can take positive
values and has a distribution with a right tail that decays to zero exponentially or faster. When this regularity
condition is satisfied, we may argue as follows to establish that the right tail of the distribution of ST exhibits a
PT
power law. Let Y = ln ST = t=1 Xt . Observe that the

pM (z)
(1)
1 − (1 − p)M (z)

(1 − p)M (ζ) = 1,

(2)

and that M (z) has strictly positive derivative at z = ζ. It
thus follows from Eq. (1) and an application of l’Hôpital’s
rule that
p
< 0,
lim (z − ζ)MY (z) = −
z→ζ
(1 − p)2 M 0 (ζ)
implying that ζ is a simple pole of MY .
The fact that ζ is a positive real pole of MY means
that the right tail of the distribution of Y decays to zero
exponentially at rate ζ, in the sense that ln Pr(Y > y) ∼
−ζy for large y. This is a consequence of a Tauberian
theorem proved in Ref. [49]. It follows that the right tail
of the distribution of ST exhibits a power law with Pareto
exponent ζ: setting y = ln s, we have

that M (z) is convex as a function of z ∈ (0, η) and satisfies M (0) < 1/(1 − p) < M (η), we deduce that there is a
unique ζ ∈ (0, η) at which

Eq. (2) appears as Eq. (10) in Ref. [27]. It shows how
the Pareto exponent ζ is uniquely determined by the
interaction of the growth rate distribution (through its
Laplace transform M ) and the age distribution (through
its parameter p). A more general version of Eq. (2) applicable in settings where the growth rates may not be i.i.d.
but instead satisfy a weaker condition involving Markov
modulation has been established in Ref. [50].
We assumed in the preceding discussion that T has the
geometric distribution. This assumption was stronger
than necessary; what matters is that the right tail of the
distribution of T decays at an exponential rate. In our
empirical analysis in Sec. III we employ a truncated logistic parametrization of the distribution of T , which has
an exponentially decaying right tail but in other respects
does not resemble the geometric distribution. We will
see in Sec. III F that Eq. (2) remains valid in this case,
with p determined by the rate at which the right tail of
the truncated logistic distribution decays exponentially
to zero. We may also allow the initial size S0 to be a
positive random variable independent of {Gt }∞
t=1 and T ,

The Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model

Here we provide a brief discussion of the SusceptibleInfected-Recovered (SIR) model of epidemics [52] and the

3
extent to which it is consistent with Gibrat’s law. In the
SIR model, a community (say, a county) consists of a
mass of individuals who are either susceptible to an infectious disease (they are neither infected nor have immunity), infected, or immune (possibly because they are
vaccinated, infected and recovered, or dead). Individuals
meet each other randomly, and conditional on an infected
individual meeting a susceptible individual, the disease
is transmitted with some probability. Let β > 0 be the
rate at which an infected individual meets a person and
transmits the disease if susceptible. Let γ > 0 be the rate
at which an infected individual recovers or dies. Letting
x, y, z be the fractions of susceptible, infected, and recovered individuals in the community (so x + y + z = 1),
the SIR model is described by the system of differential
equations
ẋ = −βxy,
ẏ = βxy − γy,
ż = γy,

(3a)
(3b)
(3c)

where ẋ, ẏ, ż are the rates of change of x, y, z.
Although the system of differential equations (3) is
nonlinear, it admits an exact analytical solution [53]. It
suffices for our purposes to study the system (3) heuristically at the beginning of the epidemic, where x ≈ 1
and y, z are small. Setting x = 1, Eq. (3b) becomes
ẏ = (β − γ)y, and hence y(t) = y0 e(β−γ)t . Integrating
Eq. (3c), we obtain
Z t
γ
z(t) = z0 +
γy(s)ds = z0 + y0
(e(β−γ)t − 1).
β−γ
0
The cumulative number of cases up to time t is therefore
given by
c(t) = y(t) + z(t) = z0 +

y0
(βe(β−γ)t − γ).
β−γ

Assuming that β > γ (so that there is an epidemic), that
time t is neither too large (so that the approximation
x ≈ 1 is valid) nor too small (so that γ  βe(β−γ)t ), and
that z0 is small relative to y0 , it follows that
c(t) ≈ y0

β
e(β−γ)t ,
β−γ

so cases grow exponentially at rate g := β − γ > 0. This
implies that the growth factor for cases between day t
and t + 1,
Gt+1 = c(t + 1)/c(t) ≈ eg ,

(4)

is independent of the current size c(t). In practice, the
transmission rate β may fluctuate over time, so it may
be plausible to assume that the growth factor Gt+1 is a
random variable independent of the current size c(t), as
in Gibrat’s law.
The point of the preceding heuristic discussion is that,
in the SIR model, the growth of infections may be broadly

consistent with Gibrat’s law in the early stages of an epidemic. The same cannot be said for the later stages of an
epidemic. In the exact analytical solution to the system
(3) given in Ref. [53], the growth rate of infections falls
as the proportion of the population that is infected or
recovered rises, because a smaller proportion of the population remains susceptible to infection. Furthermore,
the growth rate of infections may fall as individuals take
more precautionary measures such as avoiding crowded
spaces. Our empirical findings reported in Sec. III are
based on data from the onset of COVID-19 in the US in
January 2020 until the end of March 2020. At the end
of that period the total number of confirmed COVID19 cases in the US (182,308) was less than 0.06% of the
total population (330 million). We provide evidence in
Sec. III C that the growth rate of cases remained independent of the number of cases up until the end of March
2020, consistent with Gibrat’s law.

EMPIRICAL FINDINGS
A.

Dataset

Our dataset consists of the daily numbers of confirmed
COVID-19 cases in US counties reported by The New
York Times [54], based on reports from state and local
health agencies. These numbers are cumulative. We use
data from January 21, 2020, when the first case in the US
was reported, through to March 31, 2020. There are a total of 3243 counties in the US (including both states and
territories). We include the 2121 counties that reported
at least one COVID-19 case by March 31 and exclude the
remainder. Exceptionally, the dataset combines the five
boroughs of New York City (New York, Kings, Queens,
Bronx and Richmond counties) into a single unit called
New York City.

B.

Distribution of COVID-19 cases on March 31

In Fig. 1 we plot the number of confirmed COVID-19
cases in each county on March 31 against the corresponding tail probabilities in log-log scale. The tail probability
for county i is defined to be the fraction of counties whose
number of COVID-19 cases is greater than or equal to
that of county i. The county with the smallest tail probability, and therefore the highest number of COVID-19
cases, is New York City (though it is in fact an aggregate
of five counties, as pointed out in Sec. III A). The county
with the next highest number of COVID-19 cases is Nassau County, which is located in Long Island and borders
Queens County in New York City. The county with the
highest population is Los Angeles County, which has the
sixth highest number of COVID-19 cases.
Setting aside the two data points for New York City
and neighboring Nassau County, the data toward the
lower-right of Fig. 1 appear to lie roughly on a straight

Empirical plausibility of Gibrat’s law

line. This pattern is indicative of a power law in the
right tail of the distribution of COVID-19 cases across
US counties. To investigate further, we followed the approach recommended in Ref. [55]. Specifically, we used a
version of the Hill estimator [56] to fit a Pareto distribution to the data exceeding a threshold selected using the
algorithm described in Ref. [57]. Slightly more than 6%
of counties had COVID-19 cases exceeding the selected
threshold. The Hill estimate of the Pareto exponent was
ζ̂ = 0.930, with a standard error of 0.081. (Similar results were obtained using a 5% or 10% threshold.) The
fitted Pareto tail is displayed in Fig. 1, where in log-log
scale it appears as a straight line with slope −ζ̂.

The remainder of our empirical analysis focuses on determining whether the power law with estimated exponent ζ̂ = 0.930 obtained in Sec. III B can be explained
by a combination of Gibrat’s law and an age distribution
with exponential right tail, as described in Sec. II A. We
first assess the empirical plausibility of Gibrat’s law as
a description of the growth in COVID-19 cases within
counties. To this end, for each day t between March 3
and March 30 inclusive, we estimate the cross-sectional
regression equation

The two data points for New York City and Nassau
County, which recorded the highest numbers of COVID19 cases, lie somewhat to the right and to the left of our
estimated power law in Fig. 1. In its notes on methodology and definitions, The New York Times states that
where possible it assigned cases to the county where they
were treated, not where they resided [48]. This could
mean that a significant number of Nassau County residents who were confirmed as having COVID-19 but received treatment in New York City are classified as New
York City cases rather than Nassau County cases. If we
suppose that one third of Nassau County residents confirmed with COVID-19 were classified as New York City
cases, and reassign those cases to Nassau County, then
the small circles representing Nassau County and New
York City in Fig. 1 shift to the right and left respectively,
such that both are touching our line of Pareto fit.

by ordinary least squares, where cit is the number of cases
in county i up to day t, ∆ ln ci,t+1 is the growth rate in
cases in county i between day t and t + 1, Dit is the
number of days (inclusive) between day t and the day of
the first confirmed case in county i, εit is the regression
residual, and β0t , β1t , β2t , β3t are regression coefficients
that are potentially time-varying. (Here β0t corresponds
to the growth rate g = β − γ in Eq. (4).) The estimation
of Eq. (5) on day t uses the data for all counties i reporting a positive number of cases (cit > 0). We estimate
Eq. (5) for the 28 days between March 3 and March 30
inclusive because these are the days on which at least 30
counties reported a positive number of cases. The number of counties used in each regression increases from 32
on March 3 to 1940 on March 30.
Fig. 2 displays our estimates of β0t , β1t , β2t , β3t in
Eq. (5) from March 3 to March 30, with accompany-

∆ ln ci,t+1 = β0t +β1t ln cit +β2t ∆ ln cit +β3t Dit +εit (5)

5
ing 95% confidence bands. In each panel, the confidence
bands narrow as we move from left to right, reflecting
the fact that the regression sample size increases from
32 to 1940. In panels (b)-(d), we see that the estimates
of β1t , β2t , β3t are close to zero. This is exactly what
we would expect under Gibrat’s law: the growth rate in
cases between days t and t + 1 ought to be unrelated to
the number of cases on day t, the growth rate in cases
between days t − 1 and t, and the time elapsed since the
outbreak.
The estimated parameters are quite stable over time.
The estimates of β0t displayed in panel (a) indicate that
the expected growth rate of cases during March was
roughly stable at around 15–20% per day. The pooled
mean growth rate (i.e., the average over all days and
counties with at least one reported case) was 18%, which
falls outside the daily 95% confidence bands on only three
days excluding the very end of March, when mitigation
efforts may have begun to slow the epidemic. The pooled
mean growth rate may be compared to estimates of related parameters obtained in prior research on COVID19. In the context of the SIR model described in Sec. II B,
the recovery rate γ is a biological parameter determined
by the virus. In Ref. [58] the mean serial interval, which
corresponds to 1/γ, is estimated through contact tracing
to be 7.5 days. Therefore setting γ = 1/7.5 = 0.133 and
g = β − γ = 0.180, our pooled mean growth rate, we
estimate the transmission rate β to be 0.314. This in
turn implies that the reproductive number of COVID-19
(which plays an important role in epidemic dynamics) is
R0 = β/γ = 2.35, which is close to the estimate of 2.2
reported in Ref. [58].
D.

Distribution of growth rate of confirmed cases

In Fig. 3 we display a histogram of the growth rates of
confirmed COVID-19 cases, obtained by pooling our data
across all days t up to March 30 and all counties i with at
least 10 confirmed cases (cit ≥ 10) and a positive growth
rate (∆ ln ci,t+1 > 0). Overlaying the histogram we plot
a gamma distribution fit to our data by the method of
maximum likelihood. The gamma distribution has density
f (x) =

β α α−1 −βx
x
e
,
Γ(α)

x > 0,

(6)

where α, β > 0 are called the shape and rate parameters.
The maximum likelihood parameter estimates are α̂ =
2.30 and β̂ = 10.4. The fit of the gamma distribution
appears to be excellent, particularly in the right tail of
the data. It closely matches a nonparametric estimate
obtained using Gaussian kernel smoothing, which we plot
alongside it in Fig. 3.
Our data up to March 30 include a total of 5687 daycounty pairs with at least 10 confirmed cases (cit ≥ 10).
Of those, 725 day-county pairs had a zero growth rate
of cases (∆ ln ci,t+1 = 0), and were therefore excluded

cases, using data from all days up to the end of March and
all counties with at least 10 confirmed cases and a positive
growth rate of cases. The gamma fit was obtained by the

obtained by Gaussian kernel smoothing.

from the computation of the histogram in Fig. 3 and corresponding gamma fit. An observed growth rate could
be zero because there were indeed no new cases, or because the data were not updated on a particular day.
The proportion of growth rates observed to be zero is
π = 725/5687 = 0.128, which is substantial. For this
reason, in the analysis in Sec. III F, we model the distribution of the growth rate of confirmed cases as a mixture
of our maximum likelihood estimate of the gamma distribution plotted in Fig. 3 and a point mass at zero, with
proportions 1 − π and π respectively.

E.

Distribution of days since first confirmed case

In Fig. 4 we display a histogram of the number of days
(inclusive) between the day of the first confirmed case of
COVID-19 in a county, and March 31. The histogram
is computed from the 2121 counties in our dataset that
reported at least one confirmed case by March 31.
As discussed earlier, the combination of Gibrat’s law
with an exponential age distribution has been widely
used as a generative mechanism for power laws. It is
apparent from the histogram in Fig. 4, however, that the
exponential distribution (or its discrete counterpart, the
geometric distribution) cannot provide an acceptable approximation to the age distribution we observe in our
data. The problem is that the density of the exponential distribution is monotonically decreasing, whereas the
histogram in Fig. 4 is roughly hump shaped.
In nature, an exponential distribution of ages arises
when a population grows exponentially over time, as in
the Yule model of speciation discussed in Refs. [10, 26].
By analogy, we may expect to see an exponential dis-

6
where q ∈ (0, 1) is a parameter determining the rate of
exponential decay in the tails, and µ is a location parameter. After truncating all mass on nonpositive integers
and rescaling so that the remaining mass sums to one,
the probability mass assigned to each integer n ≥ 1 is
Pr(T = n) =

COVID-19 case by March 31. The truncated logistic fit was

where we have reparametrized the distribution in terms
of q and λ = q 1−µ , the latter equal to the ratio of probability masses included and excluded by truncation.
Overlaying the histogram in Fig. 4 we plot a truncated
logistic distribution fit to our data by the method of maximum likelihood. The maximum likelihood parameter estimates are q̂ = 0.825 and λ̂ = 4.06. The fit captures the
general shape of the histogram reasonably well, particularly toward the right tail, which is the more important
region for our purposes.

tribution of days-since-outbreak in our data if the number of counties that have reported at least one confirmed
COVID-19 case is growing exponentially over time. The
analogy fails because there are only 3243 counties in the
US, so that exponential growth cannot be maintained.
Once COVID-19 has spread to a substantial proportion
of counties, the rate of growth in the number of counties reporting at least one case ought to fall, eventually
vanishing as saturation is approached. Given that nearly
two thirds of US counties had reported at least one confirmed case by March 31, we would expect the number
of newly infected counties to be declining by this time.
This explains the hump shape in the histogram in Fig. 4.
The logistic function was introduced in the 19th century as a model of population growth that commences at
an exponential rate but tapers off as a saturation point
is approached due to competition for resources [59]. In
the SIR model discussed in Sec. II B, in the absence of
recovery (so that γ = 0 in Eq. (3b)), a logistic function describes the growth of the infected population over
time, and the distribution of time-since-infection for the
infected population at any given time is the truncated
logistic distribution. (Truncation is always necessary because saturation is not reached in finite time.) By analogy, when considering the spread of an infection across
a population of counties, we might expect the truncated
logistic distribution to well-approximate the distribution
of days-since-outbreak across counties at any given time.
We therefore truncate a discrete version of the logistic
distribution introduced in Ref. [60]. Without truncation,
for any integer n, the discrete logistic distribution has
probability mass

(1 + λ)(1 − q)q n−1
,
(1 + λq n−1 )(1 + λq n )

Implied Pareto exponent

In Sec. II A we discussed how the combination of
Gibrat’s law and an exponential age distribution can
generate a power law, with Pareto exponent ζ solving
Eq. (2). It remains for us to determine the Pareto exponent thus obtained when the distributions of growth
rates and ages are as estimated in Secs. III D and III E.
A complicating factor is that our age distribution is not
exactly exponential, but instead belongs to the family of
truncated logistic distributions defined by Eq. (8). This
leads us to replace Eq. (1) with
MY (z) =

∞
X
(1 + λ)(1 − q)q n−1
M (z)n ,
n−1 )(1 + λq n )

valid for all positive real z such that qM (z) < 1. Define
rn = [(1 + λq n−1 )(1 + λq n )]−1 − 1,
and let p = 1 − q. It is straightforward to show that
|rn | ≤ (1 + λ)2 q n−1 , so we may rewrite Eq. (9) as

where the first term in square brackets has a pole at the
unique ζ ∈ (0, η) solving Eq. (2) and the second term in
square brackets is analytic in a neighborhood of ζ. This
shows that ζ is a positive real pole of MY and so, as in
Sec. II A, we deduce from the Tauberian theorem proved
in Ref. [49] that the right tail of the distribution of ST
exhibits a power law with Pareto exponent ζ. Fig. 5
displays visually how ζ is determined by the parameter
q and Laplace transform M (z), with our empirical estimates for q and M (z).

β̂ = 10.4 and q̂ = 0.825 into Eq. (11), we obtain the implied Pareto exponent ζ = 0.936, which is nearly exactly
equal to (and well within the 95% confidence interval of)
the estimate ζ̂ = 0.930 reported in Sec. III B. (If we use
the nonparametric distribution in Fig. 3 in place of the
gamma distribution then the implied Pareto exponent is
ζ = 0.928.) Thus our simple model involving Gibrat’s
law generates precisely the power law we observe in the
distribution of COVID-19 cases across US counties at the
end of March.

FINAL REMARKS

We conclude with some brief remarks in nontechnical
language to summarize the primary import of our results
to policy-makers dealing with the COVID-19 epidemic,
or to historians seeking to understand the early weeks of
the COVID-19 epidemic in the US. An empirical feature
of the distribution of COVID-19 cases across US counties
at the end of March 2020 is that case loads are dramatically higher in some counties than in others. That is,
the distribution of COVID-19 cases across US counties
at the end of March has a heavy right tail. While it
may be natural to look for county-specific characteristics to explain why this is the case, our results indicate
that this is not necessary. The very high case loads observed in some counties are accurately predicted by a
simple empirically calibrated model combining (i) random multiplicative growth within each county, and (ii)
variation across counties in the duration of the spread
of COVID-19. There is no need to attribute the highest
case loads to other idiosyncratic factors. New York City,
where the number of confirmed cases at the end of March
substantially exceeds our model’s prediction, may be an
exception.
