Abstract
As the COVID-19 spreads across the world, prevention measures are becoming the essential weapons to combat against the pandemic in the period
of crisis. The lockdown measure is the most controversial one as it imposes an
overwhelming impact on our economy and society. Especially when and how
to enforce the lockdown measures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and epidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the
classic SIR model to find optimal decision making to balance between economy and people’s health during the outbreak of COVID-19. In our model,
we intend to solve a two phases optimisation problem: policymakers control
the lockdown rate to maximise the overall welfare of the society; people in
different health statuses take different decisions on their working hours and
consumption to maximise their utility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through various additional sources of data.
We use the Cournot equilibrium to model people’s behaviour and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage between economic and epidemic
costs. The analysis of simulation results provides scientific suggestions for
policymakers to make critical decisions on when to start the lockdown and
how strong it should be during the whole period of the outbreak. Although
the model is originally proposed for the COVID-19 pandemic, it can be generalised to address similar problems to control the outbreak of other infectious
diseases with the lockdown measures.

1. Introduction
As one of the most devastating pandemics in human history, the current
outbreak of COVID-19 has already caused more than one million deaths
around the globe. Numerous prevention measures have been studied by [11]
and [24] in order to control the spread of the virus by the governments. For
example, medical measures, such as research on testing, medicine, and vaccine, are accelerated; relatively easy measures, like face masking and social
distancing, are also widely accepted and applied. Essentially the most effective prevention of COVID-19 is the lockdown measure which completely
ceases the movement of the human being and thus slows down the spread
of disease. However, the lockdown measure is incredibly controversial as it
imposes a tremendous impact on our society and economy. Hence it might be
the most difficult decision to be made by the governments. Especially when
and how to impose the lockdown measure is one of the most challenging
questions for both politicians and scientists. To address this question, there
is a need to develop a mathematical model combining both epidemiology and
economics.
Epidemiological models have been widely studied to analyse the dynamics of the pandemic ([21] [22] [25] [26]). However, there is less discussion
on how the lockdown policies can influence the economic decisions of people
and the spread of disease and how can policymakers make optimal policy
in the epidemic. [10] and [9] analyse the government intervention using epidemiological models with exogenous parameters and evaluate the effect of
the intervention by simulation results. Some recent papers focus on analysis
of optimal policy and policy effect in the framework of the SIR model or its
variants. They studied the effect of different measures including fiscal policy
([7], [6], [15]), testing and quarantine ([23], [4], [18], [2]), intervention policy
on multi-aged groups ([5], [1], [12]), social distancing ( [19], [8], [14]) and
lockdown control ([3], [13], [1]). In previous works, [3] studied the optimal
lockdown policy that minimises the value of fatalities and the output costs
of the lockdown policy by locking down part of the susceptible and Infectious population, [1] researched the optimal lockdown policies on people of
different age groups, and [13] maximise the economic activity level with the
burden of the health-care system.
We extend the classic SIR model ([16], [20]) and incorporate an equilibrium framework to study the optimal lockdown policy during the pandemic
period. What we innovate from previous works is that they all only took
2

the governments’ perspective but did not take people’s own reaction to the
pandemic and the government policy into consideration, while we adopt the
extension to the SIR model from [7] by involving people’s economic decision making (consumption and working hours) and embed the SIR model
in a simple Cournot equilibrium framework to model people’s reaction to
each other. Different from [7] that studied the optimal containment policy
by controlling the tax rate, we control the level of lockdown, which is more
direct and effective for the governments, especially in the early stage of the
pandemic. Furthermore, we emphases the cost of death in our model objective of policymakers, which is an important factor in real-world government
decision making. Using this method, we can enable the lockdown policy to
identify a balance between the impact of the epidemics on the economy and
people’s health.
The motivation for this work is to address the following questions that
the policymakers may face in reality. The main findings are shown as the
short answer to these questions.
• What difference does the optimal control make on the economic and
health outcome of the epidemic compare to no control? We find that
optimal lockdown measures could significantly reduce the deaths and
infections caused by the epidemics. Although there is a short-term
recession with lockdown control, it has better long-term economic outcomes than doing no control.
• How does the timing of starting and ending affect the optimal lockdown
control itself as well as its economic and health consequences? Our results suggest that both the timing of starting and ending the lockdown
control policy makes a difference in terms of both the economic and
epidemic outcomes. It is best to start the control as early as possible,
and it is more important to avoid ending the control too early.
• How does the cost of death affect the lockdown control policy and the
outcomes? Whether policymakers regard the deaths as a negative influence on society lead to different results. Regarding deaths as negative
results in stricter lockdown control policy which leads to a much better
epidemic and slightly worse economic outcomes.
• What if policymakers have additional information on people’s health
status? Additional information about the health status of people is
3

beneficial, as the optimal separate control on people in different health
status will reach much better economic and epidemic outcomes.
This paper continues as follows, in section 2, we describe the SIR-Lockdown
Model and analyse its properties. In section 3, we discuss the parameter estimation of the model. We present the numerical results of the SIR-Lockdown
model in section 4. Section 5 makes conclusions.
2. Model
In this section, we first describe the extension to the canonical SIR model.
Then analyse the behaviour of susceptible, infectious, and recovered people in
regard to their decisions on consumption and working hours under lockdown
regulator and formulate the optimal control problem. Finally, we add the
cost of death in our model objective.
2.1. Extension of SIR
As shown in the classic SIR model ([20] [17]), we classify people into three
categories according to [16]:
• Infectious (I) are those who are tested positive to the virus;
• Recovered (R) are those who have been tested positive to the virus and
now recovered;
• Susceptible (S) are those who have not been tested positive to the virus.
We assume that all susceptible people are subjects to be infected with
some possibility in direct contact with infectious people, and infectious people will recover with a constant probability of πr or become dead with another constant probability πd . Our extension is on the infection. All infection happens via direct contact between susceptible people and infected
ones into three types of activities: purchasing and/or consumption of goods
and services, working with other people, and other daily activities. A Lockdown policy can be applied to control the working contact, hence change
the income flow, which indirectly imposes constraints on the purchasing and
consumption.

4

We use the following equation (1—5) to describe our extended SIR model
for the transition among Susceptible, Infected, Recover, and the death outcome.


Tt = πs1 (St Cts ) It Cti + πs2 (St Nts ) It Nti + πs3 St It ,
(1)
St+1 = St − Tt ,
(2)
It+1 = It + Tt − (πr + πd )It ,
(3)
Rt+1 = Rt + πr It ,
(4)
Dt+1 = Dt + πd It .
(5)
In this system of equations, St , It , Rt and Dt represents the number of people in categories of Susceptible, Infectious, Recovery and Death respectively
at time t. We use (Cts , Nts ) to model the (average) consumption behaviour
and working hours of susceptible people, (Cti , Nti ) to model the (average)
consumption behaviour and working hours of infectious people, and (Ctr , Ntr )
to model the (average) consumption behaviour and working hours of a recovered people. Tt in equation (1)is the number of newly infectious people
in the time period t to t + 1 and the three terms in the right-hand side of
this equation are used to describe the infection by the three different contact
between susceptible people and infectious people via consumption, working,
and other types of contact.
We use several constant parameters to describe the transition rate between different categories. πs1 reflects the transition rate for a susceptible
people get infected by infectious people from direct contact via purchasing/consuming. Similarly, πs2 reflects the transition rate from direct contact
via working, and πs3 reflects the transition rate from other contacts.
Denote ∆Yt = Yt+1 − Yt for Y = S, I, R, then the dynamics of the SIR
model is
∆St = −Tt ,
∆It = Tt − (πr + πd )It
∆Rt = πd It .
We use vectors and matrices to simplify our presentation. Denote Xt =
(St , It , Rt )> , Ct = (Cts , Cti , Ctr )> , nt = (nst , nit , nrt )> , and for any x = (x1 , x2 , x3 )> , c =
(c1 , c2 , c3 )> , n = (n1 , n2 , n3 )> , define
T (x, c, n) = x1 x2 (πs1 c1 c2 + πs2 n1 n2 + πs3 )
5

(6)

F (x, c, n) = (−T (x, c, n), T (x, c, n) − (πr + πd )x2 , πd x2 )>

(7)

then the system can be described as
∆Xt = F (Xt , Ct , nt ).

(8)

2.2. Behaviour of individuals in different categories
We study the rational behaviour of all people who maximise their own
welfare by choosing proper consumption and working hours like in a normal
time, i.e., the virus does not change people’s rationality and preference. Also,
we use the following utility function to model the utility from consumption
and working of an individual,
θ
u(c, n) = ln c − n2
2

(9)

where c is the consumption, and n is the working hours. The first term
measures the utility from consumption, and the second term measures the
utility from working. Denote by A the average wage per hour of a person,
hence the labor income of an individual, with working hour n is A ∗ n, which
will be the upper bound of the consumption, i.e. An ≥ c.
Denote by n0 the full working hours in a unit time before the spread of the
virus, which is officially guided by the government. It is natural that n0 is set
optimally for the society, and the optimality brings some information of the
parameter θ0 . If a person follows the full working hours n0 optimally, then
her labor income will be An0 . Since the utility function is strictly increasing
in the consumption, all labor income should be consumed up, hence the
optimal consumption c0 should be Then by the optimality of n0 , we have
∂u(c0 ,n0 )
= n10 − θn0 = 0, by which we will choose θ by
∂n
θ = 1/n20 .
The total utility of a flow of consumption and working hours {(cτ , nτ )}τ =t,··· ,T
is defined by
T
X
U (c· , n· ) =
β τ u (cτ , nτ )
(10)
t=τ

To contain the spreading of the virus, governments need to apply a lockdown policy to reduce direct contacts between people, which will impose
6

stricter constraints on their behaviour. In this paper, we study the lockdown
policy by a constraint on the ratio L ∈ [0, 1] of the working hour in the full
working capacity, i.e., given the full working hours n0 , the maximal working
hour cannot exceed n0 ∗ L. We suppose the government cannot easily identify individuals into their categories so that the lockdown constraint on the
working hours is the same for all people. We formulate the decision making
problem for each category with a given lockdown policy L· , and then study
the lockdown policy-making problem for the government.
2.2.1. Optimal decision of recovered people

Notice that the behaviour of recovered people (cr· , nr· ) plays no role in the
spread of the virus, hence the behaviour of recovered people will not affect
people in other categories. This is why we start to form this easy-to-handle
category.
7

2.2.2. Optimal behaviour of infectious people
Similar to the case of recovered people, infectious people also need to
choose their optimal consumption and working hours {(cst , nst )}t=0,1,··· ,T to
maximise their total utility from consumption and working hour, subject
to the constraint that the consumption cst cannot exceed the labour income
for the working hour nt , and nt must be no more than the lockdown policy
n0 ∗ L t .
The labor income of an infectious people is different from other categories.
Because they are infected, their health condition is usually worse than other
people. So we introduce a constant φ to discount their working efficiency,
and the labor income from nt working hour will be A ∗ φ ∗ n. Furthermore,
since an infectious people will have a constant probability πr to recover and
suffer a possibility πd of death, we need to calculate the distribution over
all categories at a future time. For an infectious people at time t, he has
the probability πr to recover in the next unit time, πd to die, and the rest
probability 1 − πr − πd to stay in the infected category. By this evolution,
we can get the conditional probabilities for his health state at a future time
τ > t. Denote by pi,i (t, τ ) the probability for him being still infected, pi,r (t, τ )
the probability being recovered, and pi,d (t, τ ) the probability of being dead.
Then we can deduce that
pi,i (t, τ ) = (1 − πr − πd )τ −t ,
(12)
τ −t
(1 − (1 − πr − πd ) )
,
(13)
pi,r (t, τ ) = πr
πr + πd
(1 − (1 − πr − πd )τ −t )
pi,d (t, τ ) = πd
.
(14)
πr + πd
If he recovered, he should behave optimally as a recovered people, while if
death has happened unfortunately, we cease the accumulation of any utility.
So, for a given flow (ci· , ni· ) of consumption and working hours taken by the
infectious people from time t, the accumulated utility he can get will be
J i (ci· , ni· ; t) =

where (c , n ) is the optimal behaviour of a recovered people determined in

Different from the infectious case, the behaviour of an infectious people (ci , ni ) is involved in our extend SIR model for the spreading of the
virus, hence they will make the decision problem for susceptible people much
harder.
2.2.3. Behaviour of susceptible people
The decision planning for a susceptible people from time t is much more
complicated if we consider the possibilities for this people to turn into infectious, recovered, and death at different future time spots. We avoid the
complexity by taking advantage of the optimal value function for an infected,
and model the objective function of a susceptible people recursively.
As for the previous two categories, we start from time t and pick up a
susceptible person. Denote the state of the SIR model at the starting time
as Xt , and the lockdown policy is fully given as L· ).
Suppose he will follow a given flow of consumption and working hours
s
(cτ , nsτ )τ =t,t+1,··· ,T before being infected, and then follow the optimal behaviour after been infected, i.e., his consumption and working hours after
infected will switch to the optimal control for an infected person from the
infection time. We denote his objective value as
J s (cs· , ns· ; t, Xt , L· ) = u(cst , nst ) + βτt J i∗ (t + 1, L· )
+β(1 − τt )J s (cs· , ns· ; t + 1, Xt+1 , L· ),
J s (cs· , ns· ; T, XT , L· ) = u(csT , nsT ),
9

(17)
(18)

where τt = πs1 n0 AφIt Lt cst + πs2 n0 It Lt nst + πs3 It is the probability of a susceptible person to be infected in the next unit time, J i∗ (t + 1, L· ) is the
optimal objective value achievable for an infected person starting from time
t + 1, and Xt+1 is the SIR state at time t + 1 resulted by people’s behaviour
r∗
i∗ r∗
(cst , nst , ci∗
t , nt , ct , nt ) and the time t state Xt .
Now it is natural that we aim at maximising the objective J s (cs· , ns· ; t, Xt , L· )
over feasible control flow (cs· , ns· )), ,i.e., the optimal behaviour of a susceptible
people will be the solution for the optimisation
max J s (cs· , ns· ; t, Xt , L· )
s.t. csτ ≤ Ansτ , nsτ ≤ n0 Lτ ,

∀τ ∈ {t, t + 1, · · · , T }.

(19)

Theorem 2.3. At time t with state Xt and the lockdown policy {Lτ : τ ∈
[t, T ]}, the optimal (cs , ns ) is
s∗
cs∗
τ = Anτ ,

τ = t, · · · , T.

(20)

Proof. We fix the lockdown policy L· and omit it when no confusion will
arise.
s∗
Denote the value function as V (t, Xt ) = J s (cs∗
· , n· ; t, Xt , L· ). According
to the dynamic programming principle, we know V must satisfy
 s s

V (t, Xt ) = s max

where τt∗ and Xt∗ are the corresponding infection probability and time t + 1
state of the SIR model.
∗
∗
If cst < Anst , then, due to the strictly increasing properties of τt in both
∗
∗
cs and ns , we can easily find a value m ∈ (cst , Anst ), and construct another
control cst = m and nst = m/A, such that the corresponding τt will be the
same as τt∗ , hence Xt+1 will also be the same as Xt∗ . But since cst > cs∗

2.3. Optimal Control of the Policymaker
With the optimal behaviour in each category under a given lockdown
policy L· , we can easily formulate the optimal policy-making problem into
an optimal control problem.

Suppose we start the lockdown problem from some time t0 with the contamination state Xt0 being given by St0 = s, It0 = i and Rt0 = r, then the

where (ct , nt ) are the optimal consumption and working hours for people
in category ca (ca can be s, i or r), which are all determined in previous
optimisation problems.
In previous objective J 0 , we remove all cases of death. In reality, since
death of disease causes has a strong negative impact to a household as well
as to the society, regulators should not ignore any death case. We include the
strong impact of death cases by introduce a penalty term into the objective

maxL· J 0 (L· ; t, Xt ) =

J λ (L. ; t, Xt ) =

(22)
In this new objective, we measure the the cost of a death by a multiple of the
optimal utility for a recovered people, and the multiple λ > 0 can be viewed
as the severity of death in the government’s view. When λ = 0, J λ reduces
to our previous objective J 0 .
With this new objective, the problem for a regulator is to solve
maxL· J λ (L· ; t, Xt ),
s.t. Lt ∈ [0, 1] ∀t ∈ [0, T ].

(23)

2.4. Solving Scheme
In Problem (23), or its reduced version (21), the optimal decisions of
individuals in all three categories are involved. Fortunately, the optimal decisions of recovered and infectious people are trivial due to our good structure
of the model, which leaves us to tackle the optimal decision problem (19) for
susceptible people before the Problem (23).
We start our solving scheme by tackling the Problem (19) with a given
lockdown policy L· . Because of the lockdown constraint, it is almost hopeless
for us to get an explicit solution. We solve this optimal control problem
numerically in the same was as in [7]. In this approach, the optimal control
at each time step is regarded as the static optimisation with two constraints
11

from the consumption budget and the lockdown policy on the working hours,
and solutions are obtained by solving the corresponding KKT condition1 .
s∗
With the optimal control (cs∗
· , n ) as functions of the lockdown policy
L· , we deal with the optimal control problem (23) as an optimisation over
the high dimension space [0, 1]T by the gradient-based interior-point method
used in the Matlab function fmincon. Although we have no theoretical proof
on the convergence of our scheme, our numerical results show the convergence
of our scheme.
Parts of our code in our scheme are from [7].
3. Model Parameters
In this section, we study how to estimate those parameters in our model
from real data, and apply it in an example with COVID-19 data in the UK
to get the numerical results for optimal lockdown control.
In our model, we have quite a lot of parameters, and some of them are
well-estimated and available from different sources. Let us start from easily
accessible ones.
For the extended SIR model, without loss of generality, we standardise the
total population to N = 1, which makes St , It , Rt and Dt be the proportions
of the population of each category in the total population.
The unit of a time step is not an essential parameter, we can simply count
the time by weeks.
πr and πd in the extended SIR model can be easily estimated from historical data, which have been done in several data sources like HPCC covid19
data cluster 2 . In our example, we will use the estimation from [7].
πs1 , πs2 and πs3 are complicated to estimate, and we defer the discussion
to after all easy ones.
For the characterisation of the decision making for individuals, we still
need parameters n0 , θ, β, A, and φ. Most of them are quite flexible, and in our
1

In fact, when we use the numerical scheme proposed in [7] to our problem, the derivative used in the KKT condition is not correct due to the absence of a complicated term
from the term in equation (17). We decide to ignore this absence due to the following
two reasons: (1) if we recover this complicated term, the calculation will be extremely
complicated; (2) from real data in the COVID-19 pandemic, we know the coefficient in
the third term βτt ) is very close to 0, which is also observed in our numerical results.

12

examples, we do not estimate them from real data but specify their values in
the same way as in different literature. We will do it in our detailed example.
Finally, let us focus on the estimation of πs1 , πs2 , πs3 . At any time t, we
have πs1 cst cit + πs2 nst nit + πs3 = πt , where πt is the transmission rate in classic
SIR model. Similar to πr and πd , the quantity πt is also available in different
data source like HPCC covid-19 data cluster2 . To estimate πs1 , πs2 , πs3 , we
choose two different time spots t1 and t2 . The first time spot t1 can be any
time between the onset of the spreading of the virus and the first lockdown
measure, and the second time spot t2 must be in a period where a lockdown
measure was applied. With the observation of πt1 and πt2 , we have:
πs1 A2 n20 + πs2 n20 + πs3 = πt1 ,

πs1 A2 n20 L2t2 + πs2 n20 L2t2 + πs3 = πt2 ,

where Lt is an estimation of actual lockdown rate at time t. These two
equations are not enough to give us the values of three parameters, we still
need one more equation for the purpose. In the case (as happened in the
UK) that no different (non-null) lockdown measures have been applied, the
third equation is officially not available. So we assume that
πs2 n20 ×

1 1
× = πs3 .
3 6

This equation is from the assumption that susceptible people spend about
1/3 of their working hours for other activities related to other types of direct
contact, and infectious people spend about half the time of susceptible ones
in this type of activity due to the poor health condition. The two proportions
1/3 and 1/6 can be adjusted based on personal experience.
These three equations can give us a good estimation of πs1 , πs2 and πs3 .
3.1. Parameter estimation: an example
We take the COVID-19 in the UK as our example, which started in the
year 2019. The only lockdown took place on 23 March 2020 and lifted up in
July 2020.
For the estimation of πs1 , πs2 and πs3 , we need to specify some other
parameters.

time-use study, which reported the working-not-from-home time. According to the study, the average daily time (in minutes) of working not from
home is 97.6 in March/April 2020 and 150.0 in 2014/2015, thus we estimate
Lt2 = 97.6/150 ≈ 0.65.
Also according to ONS, the average actual weekly hours of work for fulltime workers from Dec 2019 to Feb 2020 was 36.9 4 , thereby we set n0 = 36.9.
According to the equation n20 θ = 1, we set θ = 0.00073.
We follows the setting of some parameters in literature. The mortality
rate is set to be 0.6% from [7]. As in [7] , we assume that each infected case
takes 18 days on average to either recover or die. Since our model is weekly,
we have πd = 0.006 × 7/18, πr = 7/18 − πd . The reproduction number R0 at
time t1 in Jan 2020 is around 1.95 without control measures 5 , and between
0.7 to 1.0 in April 2020 after the lockdown 67 , we use the middle point 0.85
of this range of R0 for the calcuation of πt2 . Since in classic SIR model,
R0 = β/γ where β and γ the infected and recovery transmission rate
πt1 = 1.95 × 7/18, πt2 = 0.85 × 7/18.
Given a published average annual income 8 30350 for 52 weeks, we set A =
15.8172.
With all quantities involved in the three equations for (πs1 , πs2 , πs3 ), we
get solution
πs1 = 1.244887 × 10−6 , πs2 = 1.0336 × 10−4 , πs3 = 0.01759.

4. Numerical Results
In this section, we present the result of our numerical experiments under
the parameter setting in section 3.2. We do experiments to analyze the
impact of the optimal lockdown control policy, the policy when different
levels of the cost of death are taken into consideration, early exit and late
start of the lockdown policy, and finally the smart containment policy. For
every experiment, the initial state is (S, I, R) = (0.9998, 0.0002, 0) and the
time horizon is 100 weeks.
4.1. Optimal Lockdown Control
As Figure 1 (a), (d) (page 21) shows, if there is no lockdown control,
i.e. the lockdown rate is constant 1 for all time, then under our parameter
setting, around 15% of the population will be infected, 0.3% of the population
will die and the peak of infection will be above 0.6% at week 50. Under the
optimal lockdown control, the proportion of Infectious people decrease to
5.22 × 10−5 at week 50, then raises to 2.5 × 10−4 at week 100. 0.37% of
the population will become infected and 0.0068% of the population will die
by week 100. The optimal lockdown policy reduces the peak of infection by
95.8% and reduces the number of deaths by 97.7%. The significant life-saving
is associated with a recession. Figure 1 (e) (page 21) shows the aggregate
consumption under optimal lockdown policy decreases 20% compares to the
no control case at the beginning, but then constantly increases. The average
aggregated consumption fall by 6.6% with the optimal lockdown measure.
In Figure 1 (f) (page 21), the optimal lockdown rate starts from around
80%, then gradually release to above 95%, the speed of the increase of the
lockdown rate first decreases until around week 50, then increase until week
100.
The increase of the infected proportion is because our model has a finite
time horizon, and does not take the consequences after a time horizon of
100 weeks into consideration. In the beginning, the aggregated consumption
under optimal lockdown control is 20% less but becomes 8.2% more than
that of no control in the end. The reason that the optimal lockdown control policy did not cause a severe recession might be that in the no control
case, susceptible people will cut back their working hours, as well as their
15

consumption as the infected population increases, and in the optimal lockdown control restricted the infected population so that susceptible people
won’t cut back their consumption as much. We proved in section 2 that the
recovered and Infectious people will work as much time as possible in order
to maximize their own utility, but the behaviour of susceptible people is not
certain. In the parameter setting of our experiments, the susceptible people
almost work as much as possible just as the infected and recovered people do,
but slightly reduce their working hours from the upper bound of lockdown
constrain near the end of the time horizon, this behaviour may due to the
increase of infected proportion, which raises the risk of getting infected for
susceptible people.
In general, the optimal lockdown policy saves lives and is more robust in
economic recovery, it brings long-term health benefits and economic growth
with the cost of a short-term recession.
4.2. Cost of Death
In this subsection, we study how the severity of death regarded by the
planners affects the optimal lockdown policy. We set the penalty coefficient of
death λ in (17) as 0, 10, 20, 50, which means the death of 1 people is regarded
as the loss of 0, 10, 20, 50 recovered people by the planner. When λ = 0, it is
the same as the original optimal control model.
Our results in Figure 2 (page 22) show that adding a penalty on deaths
makes a huge difference, it significantly slows down the increase of the lockdown rate (Figure 2 (f) (page 22)), thus reduces the proportion of deaths
in a great extent: 76.7%, 83.0%, 87.2% respectively (Figure 2 (d) (page 22)),
and avoid the substantial rise of the infectious population (Figure 2 (a) (page
22)), these are beneficial in terms of the mental impact in the society as low
deaths and infection amount release the pressure on both people in the society and the planner. As the penalty coefficient increases, the optimal policy
becomes constantly more strict. The relation of the death penalty coefficient
and the result optimal control rate is below linear. As Figure 2 (f) (page 22)
shows, despite that optimal lockdown policy with different death penalty coefficient starts with quite different lockdown rates:0.62, 0.56, 0.46 for penalty
coefficient 10, 20, 50 respectively, they quickly become close. At the end of
control, the aggregate consumption, as well as the lockdown rate of optimal
policy with the death penalty is extremely close to the one without the death
penalty. Compare to the original optimal lockdown policy, there is a slight
recession when adding penalty on number of deaths: the average aggregate
16

consumption decreases by 3.3%, 4.5%, 5.5% for penalty coefficient 10, 20, 50
respectively (Figure 2 (e) (page 22)).
Although the lockdown control policy with or without the death penalty
becomes close from the middle to the end of the control, in the latter case, the
infectious population does not rise as it in the former case. This is because
that the lockdown policy with the death penalty suppresses the infectious
population to a much lower level than the lockdown policy without the death
penalty, thus the infectious population grows slower as the lockdown rate
increases.
In general, considering the cost of deaths leads to a more conservative
lockdown control policy, it saves much more lives at the cost of a short-term
recession.
4.3. Cost of Early Ending of Lockdown Control Policy
Practically, policymakers may under the intense pressure of economic
loss that forces them to end the containment policy in the middle of the
pandemic. In this subsection, we discuss the consequences of doing so. As
we see in section 4.1, the infected population reaches the bottom at the week
50, which may seem to be a good time spot to end the lockdown policy.
Our results in Figure 3 (e) (page 23) shows that there is an instant bounce
of consumption right after the end of lockdown control, but this would cause
the instant rise of infectious population (Figure 3 (a) (page 23)), and at the
end, the infectious population 72 times larger than that of week 50. The
burst of infection would result in a recession of 10.8% from the peak at the
end (Figure 3 (e) (page 23)).
So, ending the lockdown policy prematurely may not bring long-term economic benefit and what’s worse is, it would result in a substantial additional
number of deaths. Therefore we suggest that policymakers avoid terminating the lockdown policy during the pandemic in pursuit of only a short-term
economic benefit.
4.4. Cost of Start the Lockdown Control Policy Late
Policymakers could also face the situation that there are things that prevent them from taking the lockdown measure in the early stage of the pandemic.
Our results Figure 4 (f) (page 24) show the optimal lockdown policy that
starts at week 13 (around 3 months later). Compare to the optimal lockdown
policy that starts at week 0 that starts with the lockdown rate 0.8, the late
17

started optimal lockdown policy starts with a stricter constrain rate of 0.73.
Although the lockdown rate of the late started lockdown policy constantly
increases, it is always less than the original optimal lockdown policy. The late
start causes a slight stronger recession (Figure 4 (e) (page 24)): the average
aggregated consumption reduces 1% and a substantial rise of deaths (Figure
4 (d) (page 24)): the number of deaths rises 84.8% by week 100.
In general, It is the earlier the better to start the lockdown control policy,
and despite that the late start of lockdown policy brings additional loss, it
is much better than applying no containment policy or abandon it too early.
4.5. Vaccination
Vaccination is an effective method of preventing infectious diseases. We
now involve vaccination in SIR model. Assume that at each time period, fix
amount of susceptible people: δv of the starting population get vaccination
that could prevent them from getting COVID-19 and assume governments
to afford the cost of vaccination for people. Once susceptible people get
vaccination, they are regarded as recovered. Thus the objective value of
susceptible people become:

J s (cs· , ns· ; t, Xt , L· ) = u(cst , nst ) + β(1 −

(25)
We set δv = 1/104 in simulation. Results on Figure 7(a),(b),(d)(page 27)
shows that vaccination could eliminate the epidemic without a rebound of
infection and reduce the number of deaths compare that without vaccination.
Figure(e),(f) shows that vaccination reduces the severity of recession and
leads to a less strict optimal lockdown control.

4.6. Smart Lockdown Control Policy
In the lockdown control policies we studied so far, the government chooses
the same lockdown rate for all three kinds of people (susceptible, infectious,
and recovered). In this subsection, we consider the smart containment, by
which means the policymaker directly chooses working hours for all three
kinds of people with the same objective function as previous models. There
is no need to apply any lockdown on recovered people because their utility
reaches the maximum as their working hour is at the maximum and they do
not affect the utility or the transition of susceptible and Infectious people.
Our results show that in the smart lockdown control policy, Infectious people
almost do not work at the beginning, but then the planner gradually increases
their working hours as the infected population decreases rapidly, and susceptible people work almost without fear of becoming infected. Figure 5 (page
25) shows that compare to the previous optimal lockdown control policy, the
smart lockdown policy is much better, since it reduces the number of deaths
to a great extent, and almost avoids the recession because the proportion of
Infectious people is extremely small. The implement of a smart lockdown
control policy requires the planners to know the status of all people and have
control over their working hours. In reality, the knowledge of people’s status
needs measures such as medical testing and rely on the accuracy of testing.
Our results suggest that these measures and information that are helpful for
taking smart lockdown policy are beneficial for social welfare.
4.7. View of Reproduction Number
The reproduction number (R0 ) is now a basis for some governments to
make decisions in reaction to the pandemic. We present the R0 of lockdown
polices in all our experiments in Figure 6 (page 26). The R0 of smart lockdown policy is much smaller than that of all other lockdown policies. The R0
of lockdown policies with the same lockdown rate for all three kinds of people
behave similarly to their lockdown rate whereas in the no control case, its
R0 decreases constantly and the R0 of smart lockdown policy behaves similar
to the lockdown rate of Infectious people. This is because the behaviour of
all three kinds of people is in accordance with the lockdown rate in optimal
lockdown control policies, while the behaviour of susceptible people varies
if there is no control, and in the smart lockdown case, the susceptible and
recovered people almost remain the lockdown rate as constant 1 in the whole
control process, thus its R0 behaves in accordance with the lockdown rate
of Infectious people. Notice that although the R0 of in the no control case
19

decreases below 1, and the R0 of lockdown control policies with or without
the death penalty increase over 1, policies with lockdown control are much
better than that without control as analyzed in previous subsections. We,
therefore, suggest that whether R0 is larger or less than 1 can not be the
only foundation for planners to make judgements or decisions on the current
situation.
5. Conclusion
In this paper, we extend the canonical epidemiological model SIR to find
an optimal decision making with the aim to balance between economy and
people’s health. In our model, people in different health statuses take different decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximise their
own utility, while policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximise the
overall welfare, which leads to a two phases optimisation problem. Several
parameters in our model are not straightforward to specify using the common epidemic data for modelling. We develop a novel method of parameter
estimation through various additional sources of data. Our results show that
lockdown measures could effectively reduce the deaths and infections caused
by the COVID-19. There is an inevitable trade-off between the short-term recession, and health problems caused by the pandemic, and how policymakers
deal with this could lead to very different decisions. We quantify the tradeoff by emphasising the cost of death in the model objective, which enables
the optimal lockdown policy to discover a balance between the economic and
epidemic outcomes. The timing of starting and ending the lockdown control
policy makes much difference in terms of both the economic and epidemic
outcomes. So the earlier to start the control, the better the results will be.
It is crucial to avoid premature ending of the control. In the analysis of
the smart containment policy, the results suggest that additional information about the health status of people is beneficial, as the optimal lockdown
control policy will reach much better outcomes if it could be implemented
on people with different health status separately. Through comparison of
lockdown policies, we suggest that R0 cannot be the only foundation for
policy-making.
