Abstract
In this note we explore a non-static spacetime in quantum regime in the background of f (R) gravity.
The time dependent Vaidya metric which represents the spacetime of a radiating body like star is studied
in an energy dependent gravity’s rainbow, which is a UV completion of General Relativity. In our quest
we have used gravitational collapse as the main tool. The focus is to probe the nature of singularity (black
hole or naked singularity) formed out of the collapsing procedure. This is achieved via a geodesic study.
For our investigation we have considered two different models of f (R) gravity, namely the inflationary
Starobinsky’s model and the power law model. Our study reveals the fact that naked singularity is as
good a possibility as black hole as far as the central singularity is concerned. Via a proper fine tuning
of the initial data, we may realize both black hole or naked singularity as the end state of the collapse.
Thus this study is extremely important and relevant in the light of the Cosmic Censorship hypothesis. The
most important result derived from the study is that gravity’s rainbow increases the tendency of formation
of naked singularities. We have also deduced the conditions under which the singularity will be a strong
or weak curvature singularity. Finally in our quest to know more about the model we have performed a
thermodynamical study. Throughout the study we have obtained results which involve deviation from the
classical set-up. Such deviations are expected in a quantum evolution and can be attributed to the quantum
fluctuations that our model suffers from. It is expected that this study will enhance our knowledge about
quantization of gravity and subsequently about the illusive theory of quantum gravity.

Introduction

More than a hundred years back, Einstein proposed his theory of general relativity (GR) which revolutionized
our idea of gravity. It provided us a theory that could act as a powerful tool in our quest to know the universe.
With the passage of time and with extensive research glitches in the theory started showing up. The major
blow came at the turn of the last century when the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the universe [1,2]
left GR inconsistent at cosmological distances. Since then we have resorted to the alternative techniques of
modified gravity and dark energy to incorporate this accelerated expansion in our theory of gravity. While the
former deals with the geometry of spacetime, the latter is concerned with the matter content of the universe.
Extensive reviews in modified gravity can be found in the Refs. [3–5].
Many of such theories aim at modifying the linear function of scalar curvature R from its special form
in GR to a more generic form. f (R) gravity is one such attempt where the gravitational lagrangian of GR,

LGR = R is replaced by an analytic function of R i.e. Lf (R) = f (R). Choosing a suitable function for f (R),
one can explore the non-linear effects of the scalar curvature on the evolution of the universe. Extensive
reviews in f (R) gravity can be found in the Refs. [6, 7]. Viability of f (R) dark energy models have been
studied in ref. [8], where the f (R) models with a power law of R has been ruled out. Author of Ref. [9]
studied the interplay between f (R) theories and scalar-tensor theories via the Palatini formalism. Formation
of large scale structure in f (R) gravity was studied in Ref. [10]. A reconstruction scheme for f (R) theories
was explored in Ref. [11]. Various other studies related to f (R) gravity can be found in Refs. [12–15].
For a long time we have been searching for a theory of gravity that will be consistent at all length scales
and at all energy levels. Such a theory is termed as the Theory of Everything (TOE). It is understood that
this would eventually boil down to a theory of quantum gravity where GR will be reconciled to the theory of
quantum mechanics (QM). Till now there have been a few proposals for such a theory namely, Loop quantum
theory [16, 17], String theory [18, 19], Horava-Lifshitz (HL) gravity [20, 21], etc. The UV completion of GR
in the limit that GR is recovered in IR limit has eventually led to the development of the Horava-Lifshitz
gravity. An alternative mechanism of UV completion of GR was proposed by Magueijo and Smolin in the
Ref. [22] where the geometry of spacetime depends on the energy of the test particle. This theory is termed as
Gravity’s Rainbow. Although the conceptual basis of HL gravity and gravity’s rainbow are quite different yet
they aim to pursue similar ideas. Both the theories resorts to the modification of the usual energy-momentum
dispersion relations of the special theory of relativity in the UV limit, such that in the IR limit the usual
relations are retrieved. Following this, the authors in Ref. [23] tried to bridge the two theories from the
conceptual background.
We know that in GR the usual energy-momentum relations are governed by the Lorentz symmetry and so
any modifications to these in the UV limit will directly imply the violation of the symmetry. In fact different
quantum gravity approaches have shown that at high energy scales (UV limit) Lorentz symmetry breaks
down [24–27]. This breakdown is expected to occur in models like string field theory [28], discrete spacetime
[29], spacetime foam [30], non-commutative geometry [31], spin network in Loop quantum gravity [32], etc.
Magueijo and Smolin in the Ref. [33] proposed the theory of Doubly Special Relativity (DSR), where Einstein’s
Special Theory of Relativity (STR) is generalized for spacetimes with high energy, i.e. energies compared
to Planck energy (EP = 1019 GeV ). In this theory Planck energy joins the speed of light as an invariant
quantity. Nevertheless this formulation was achieved at the cost of the violation of the Lorentz symmetry.
The modifications to the field theory also suggested corresponding modification to the equivalence principle
which determines how DSR can be embedded in GR. Introducing non-zero curvature in DSR, we get what
can be called the Doubly General Relativity (DGR) or Gravity’s Rainbow. In this theory the modifications to
the usual energy-momentum dispersion relations (E 2 − p2 = m2 ) as discussed above is introduced via energy
dependent rainbow functions F (E) and G(E) as given below,
E 2 F 2 (E) − p2 G 2 (E) = m2

(1)

Here E = Es /EP , where Es is the maximum energy that a probe in the spacetime can support, and EP is the
Planck energy. From the conceptual background of the theory it is obvious that Es cannot exceed EP . The
choice of the rainbow functions should be such that they respect the correspondence principle, i.e. at the IR
limit we should be able to recover the usual energy-momentum dispersion relations of classical GR from the
Eqn.(1). This means that the rainbow functions are required to satisfy the relations,
lim

Es /EP →0

F (E) = 1,

lim

Es /EP →0

G(E) = 1.

(2)

In the above relations the limit ES /EP → 0 corresponds to a spacetime with low energy where GR becomes
dominant. It is expected that as Es → EP , effects of GR gradually fades away and quantum gravity effects
2

become more and more dominant. The rainbow functions are motivated from various theoretical and phenomenological considerations in literature. Using the results from loop quantum gravity and κ-Minkowski
noncommutative spacetime these functions have been proposed as [34, 35],
r
Es
F (Es /EP ) = 1, G(Es /EP ) = 1 − η
(3)
EP
where η is a constant. The modified dispersion from constant velocity of light motivates the following rainbow
functions [33]
1
(4)
F (Es /EP ) = G(Es /EP ) =
1 − a1 EEPs
where a1 is a constant. Moreover the observations of the hard spectra from gamma ray bursters have been
used motivate the rainbow functions [30],
F (Es /EP ) =

ea2 Es /EP − 1
,
a2 Es /EP

G(Es /EP ) = 1

(5)

where a2 is a constant. In this study it makes sense to use the rainbow functions given by eqn.(3) because the
choice is motivated from a theory of quantum gravity (loop quantum gravity).
The metric in gravity’s rainbow is written as
g µν (E) = η ab eµa (E)eνb (E).

(6)

where e0 = F −1 (Es /EP )e˜0 and ei = G −1 (Es /EP )e˜i . Here the tilde quantities refer to the frame fields which
are independent of energy thus corresponding to the geometry explored by a low energy quanta. Eqn.(6)
actually represents a family of energy dependent metrics thus forming a rainbow. In such a spacetime each
test particle with different energy will probe a different geometry thus following different geodesics. Due to
its quantum gravity background gravity’s rainbow have been studied extensively in recent times [36–43].
Gravitational collapse is an astrophysical phenomenon that plays a central role in the structure formation
process of the universe. For this reason gravitational collapse has been a field of interest for astrophysicists over
the years. It all started with Oppenheimer and Snyder who studied the collapse of a dust cloud with a static
Schwarzschild exterior and Friedmann like interior [44]. Subsequently the collapse of spherically symmetric
inhomogeneous distribution of dust was studied by Tolman [45] and Bondi [46]. In 1969, Roger Penrose in
a phenomenal paper [47] argued that any types of cosmological singularity is bound to be shrouded by an
event horizon thus making it a Black Hole (BH). This proposal is popularly known in literature as the Cosmic
Censorship Hypothesis (CCH). But this idea has subsequently been questioned in the absence of any form of
rigorous proof or observational evidence. This naturally led people to search for collapsing models that can yield
singularities which are uncensored, commonly known as Naked Singularities (NS) [48–54]. Such an uncensored
singularity will be really interesting to study because it will leak information that is generally hidden behind
the event horizon of a BH. Not only the solution of information paradox but a proper knowledge of NS will
eventually help us understand the gravity quanta thus allowing us to formulate the illusive satisfactory theory
of quantum gravity.
In 1951, P.C. Vaidya formulated a relativistic line element representing the field of radiation for a nonstatic mass [55]. This is a generalization of the Schwarzschild solution for non-static mass. Schwarzschild’s
external solution can represent the gravitational field of a cold dark body with a constant mass. So it is
obvious that the application of this solution to describe the sun’s gravitational field should only be considered
as approximate. Vaidya’s metric precisely solved this problem by successfully describing the spacetime of Sun.
In fact it can represent the spacetime of any radiating mass, such as a star. This is why it is sometimes called
the radiating or shining Schwarzschild metric. It should be mentioned here that this metric, if expressed in
3

radiation coordinates, differs from the Schwarzschild metric only in that the constant mass parameter m is
replaced by a function of retarded time. Notable studies using gravity’s rainbow in Vaidya’s metric can be
found in [56–58]. Other important studies on Vaidya spacetime can be found in [59–63].
From the above discussion we feel the need to explore the non-static radiating Vaidya spacetime in a
quantum regime. This can be achieved by introducing rainbow deformations in the Vaidya spacetime in the
background of a gravity theory. f (R) gravity being the simplest and most obvious theory of modified gravity
at least at the mathematical level, we are inclined to consider it in the background of our model. It is expected
that the radiating star represented by Vaidya spacetime will yield very interesting results in the quantum limit.
The model will be investigated via a study of gravitational collapse, which is a very important astrophysical
phenomenon. The study will be eventually complimented by a thermodynamical study in the said model.
The search for the illusive theory of quantum gravity is a motivation for the present work and we hope that
our investigation will be a step towards the better understanding of the nature of gravity quanta. The paper
is organized as follows. In Sec.2, the field equations for the rainbow deformed Vaidya spacetime in f (R)
gravity are derived and a solution is obtained. Sec.3 is dedicated to the study of gravitational collapse in the
system. In Sec.4 we have studied the thermodynamical properties of the system in detail. Finally the paper
is concluded with a conclusion and discussion in Sec.5.

Field Equations

Here we report the computed field equation for f (R) gravity’s rainbow in the time dependent Vaidya spacetime. In the study that follows we have made use of the (11) component of the field equations because of its
simplicity and so we report only that component in this section. The other components of the field equations
are reported in the appendix section.

(25)

where miv denotes the fourth partial derivative of m with respect to r.

2.2

Solution of the system

To find a solution of the field equations we have to consider specific models of f (R) gravity. Here we consider
two popular models, namely the inflationary Starobinsky’s model and the power law model, and subsequently
find the solution of the system. The emergence of the cosmic structure from the homogeneous and isotropic
universe cannot be clearly explained by the standard inflationary models, because the mechanism involved
preserves the homogeneity and isotropy at all times. A solution to this problem has been proposed by Sudarsky
et al. in Refs. [64–72], where they have introduced the concept of self induced collapse hypothesis. Here the
collapse of the wave function of the inflaton mode is restricted to occur during the inflationary period. So
there are reasons to believe that collapsing scenario in inflationary models can help us understand the quantum
evolution of universe. Moreover quantum corrections induced by rainbow functions will be highly compatible
with such a model. This motivates us to choose the Starobinsky’s model for our study. The motivation for
the power law model is obvious as it is the most generic model of f (R) gravity capable of representing all the
epochs of the universe by fine tuning the initial data.
2.2.1

Starobinsky’s Model

In this section we consider the popular Starobinsky’s inflationary model of f (R) gravity. The model is given
as [73, 74]
f (R) = R + aR2

(26)

where a ≥ 0 is the only free parameter of the theory and has the dimensions of [mass]−2 . So the parameter a
can also be written in the form a = 1/M 2 , where mass becomes the free parameter of the gravity theory. It
can easily be seen that GR can be retrieved from the theory for a = 0. Using eqns. (24),(25) and (26) we get
the following differential equation in terms of the mass ’m’,

2ar2 r3 miv − 6rm′′ + 12m′ = 0

(27)

We can see that for a = 0, we get an identity which corresponds to the case for GR. From the above equation
we get,
r3 miv − 6rm′′ + 12m′ = 0, a 6= 0
(28)
It should be noted that the parameter ′ a′ does not appear in the above differential equation. Solving the above
differential equation we get,
f2 (t)
+ f3 (t)r3 + f4 (t)r4
(29)
m(t, r) = f1 (t) −
r
6

where f1 (t), f2 (t), f3 (t) and f4 (t) are arbitrary functions of time t. So for the Starobinsky’s model, the rainbow

2.2.2

Power Law Model

Regarding power law model we would like to state that probably it is the most generic model for any theory
and has a wide range of applicability. Hence it is not surprising that it will reduce to Starobinsky’s model for
some physical restrictions. But it should be mentioned here that one should be cautious in using a generic
form of power law model because for all values of the exponent the model may not remain cosmologically
viable or for all values the model may not satisfy the standard observational tests. Amendola et al. [8] points
out such a discrepancy and rules out some basic models of f(R) theory. There are other examples as well. In
the light of these results any unhindered and free use of the power law model will be worrying. However here
our concern is to keep our study as generic as possible and not bother about observational compliances. Since
our basic aim is to study gravitational collapse which is an astrophysical phenomenon we have restricted our
study to just astrophysical implications.
We consider the following power law model [75, 76] of f (R) gravity,
f (R) = αRn ,

n>0

(31)

where α and n > 0 are constants. Using eqns.(24),(25) and (31) we get the following differential equation in
terms of the mass ’m’,

It is almost impossible to get a general solution for the above equation by the known mathematical methods.
So we may discuss some particular cases. It can easily be seen that the equation becomes an identity for n = 0
and n = 1 and does not possess a viable solution. Moreover these are trivial cases for the power law and are of
very little interest. For n = 2 this equation reduces to the corresponding equation for the Starobinsky model
discussed in the previous section.
The equation can be separated into two component equations as given below:

Gravitational Collapse

In this section we aim to study the phenomenon of gravitational collapse of a star modelled by the deformed
Vaidya metric given in eqn.(14). We will use the solutions obtained in eqns.(30) and (40) for the two different
models separately. The methodology to be employed to study the collapsing procedure is the geodesic study.
We will be interested in probing the existence of non-spacelike radial geodesics emanating from the central
singularity, that were terminated in the past at the singularity r = 0. A geodesic coming out from the central
singularity and interacting with the outside would imply the non existence of the event horizon around the
singularity. Such a singularity is quite aptly termed as a naked singularity. Due to the absence of any form of
horizon an outside observer can receive information from such a singularity and vice-versa. If only a single null
geodesic escapes from the singularity, it indicates the emission of a single wavefront and hence the singularity
would be visible (naked) only momentarily to a distant observer. This singularity is locally naked. On the
other hand if the NS is to be visible for a finitely prolonged time period, a family of geodesics must leave the
central singularity, which will make the singularity globally naked. If our search for the emanating geodesics
yield negative result, then the singularity is bound to be a BH and we will get yet another reason to upheld the
cosmic censorship hypothesis, which does not have a rigorous proof till date. On the contrary there are quite a
few works in literature [48,53,54] that supports the formation of NS thus providing significant counterexamples
for the CCH as discussed earlier. In spite of these counterexamples, generically in classical background, CCH
holds good and a singularity is always censored but in this work it is expected that the quantum nature of
gravity will play its role and support the formation of NS.
Considering the collapse to be spherical, we assume the physical radius of the r-th shell of the star at time
t be R(t, r). In the epoch t = 0, we have R(0, r) = r. If the collapse is inhomogeneous, then different shells
8

may become singular at different times. If the outgoing non-spacelike geodesics possess well defined tangent
at the singularity, dR
dr will tend to a finite limit as the geodesic approaches the singularity in the past along
the trajectories. As the trajectories reach the points (t0 , r) = (t0 , 0), the singularity occurs, which is given by
R(t0 , 0) = 0. Physically this corresponds to the matter shells being crushed to zero radius, resulting in the
formation of the central singularity. If we trace back the trajectories of the outgoing non-spacelike geodesics
from this central singularity, it is likely that they will terminate in the past at the singularity (r = 0, t = t0 )
where R(t0 , 0) = 0. Therefore we should have R → 0 as r → 0 [77].
The equation for outgoing radial null geodesics can be obtained from equation (14) by putting ds2 = 0
and dΩ22 = dθ2 + sin2 θdφ2 = 0 as

From the above expression it is quite clear that at r = 0, t = 0 there is a singularity of the above differential
equation. Suppose we consider a parameter X = rt . Using this parameter we can study the limiting behaviour
of the function X as we approach the singularity at r = 0, t = 0 along the radial null geodesic. If we denote
the limiting value by X0 then using L’Hospital’s rule we have
X0

(42)

This would indeed give an algebraic equation in terms of X0 . Now any positive real root of this equation will
give the direction of the tangent to an outgoing null geodesic at the singularity. So the existence of positive
real roots to this equation is a necessary and sufficient condition for the singularity to be naked. Now as
discussed earlier, if one single null geodesic in the (t, r) plane escapes the singularity, it would mean that
a single wavefront is emitted from the singularity and hence the singularity would appear to be naked only
instantaneously to a distant observer. This would result in a locally naked singularity. If the singularity is
to be seen for a finite period of time a family of null geodesics must escape from the singularity thus making
it globally naked. These can be investigated from the number of real positive roots obtained from the above
equation. Now we will consider the results for the two models separately.

The functions fi (t), t = 1, 2, 3, 4 are in fact constants of integration that we get on solving (integrating) the
field equations. So in principle they should be obtained from suitable initial or boundary conditions and
physically should represent the mass of the system. Obviously these initial and boundary conditions will correspond to some particular physically viable cases of the generic mathematical solutions. Therefore we should
consider those particular cases which are compatible with the present study of gravitational collapse. Our
choice for these functions should be guided by the fact that for some suitable transformations we should be
able to retrieve those chosen functions as initial or boundary conditions for our system. We further mention
that we will only consider self similar expressions for these functions to suit our analysis. Non self similar
expressions can also be considered with consequences. We choose the following:
9

f1 (t) = γ1 t,

f2 (t) = δ1 t2 ,

f3 (t) = ξ1 t−2 ,

f4 (t) = ǫ1 t−3

where γ1 , δ1 , ξ1 and ǫ1 are arbitrary constants. It should be clear that the above choices have been made
depending on the definition of X0 in equation (42) such that the ratio t/r can be formed and correspondingly
its limit can be evaluated. So we have actually considered such values of the arbitrary functions of time so
that the limit given by eqn.(43) exists.
Using the above chosen functions in eqn.(43) we get the following algebraic equation in X0
δ1 X05 − γ1 X04 + X03 −

2F (E) 2
X − ξ1 X0 − ǫ1 = 0
G(E) 0

(44)

The above equation being a five degree equation and hence it is highly unlikely to find the solution and get
the roots by the known mathematical methods. Hence we try to plot the X0 against the other parameters
and get an idea about its trend. Such plots have been generated in Figs.1, 2, 3 and 4. Also in fig.5 we have
shown the effect of gravity’s rainbow on the collapsing scenario and compared the results with those of general
relativity.

fifth degree equation, we generate plots of X0 against various parameters to get an idea about the nature of
X0 . The plots have been generated in Figs. 6, 7, 8 and 9.

algebraic methods, we have resorted to numerical techniques to get an idea of the nature of X0 , which in turn
determines the nature of singularity formed. In Figs.1 and 2 we have generated contour plots for X0 against
δ1 for different values of γ1 and ξ1 respectively. From Fig.1 we see that for δ1 < 0, X0 remains in the negative
level for different values of γ1 , thus favouring the formation of a BH. But for δ1 > 0, we see trajectories of
X0 both in the negative and positive levels. This indicates that there is a realistic chance of formation of NS
for this range. In Fig.2, we have almost a similar result as in Fig.1. In the both the figures we see that the
tendency of formation of NS increases with the increase in the value of the parameter. So the dependencies of
collapsing procedure on γ1 and ξ1 are almost of the identical nature.
In Figs.3 and 4 plots are generated for X0 against ξ1 for different values of δ1 and γ1 respectively. In
Fig.3 we see that almost all the trajectories lie in the positive region throughout the entire domain of ξ1 , thus
favouring the formation of NS. Only around ξ1 ≥ 8, we see that there is a transition and the possibility of
the formation of an event horizon brightens. It should also be mentioned here that an increase in the value
of δ1 decreases the chance of formation of NS. A near similar trend is obtained in Fig.4 where we see that the
tendency of formation of NS increases with the increase in γ1 . Moreover the transition from NS to BH starts
at an earlier stage around ξ1 = 3 as compared to Fig.3. The study would lose its significance if we cannot
understand the role played by gravity’s rainbow in the collapsing scenario. This is shown in Fig.5, where we
clearly see the trajectories for different rainbow functions and can also compare with that of general relativity.
It can be seen that gravity’s rainbow has a tendency to push the trajectories towards the positive level thus
indicating greater affinity towards the formation of NS.
In the case-2 (n = 2) of the power law model we encounter another five degree algebraic equation in X0
given in eqn.(52). Figs.6, 7, 8 and 9 are dedicated to the study of this equation. In Figs.6 and 7, we have
generated plots for X0 against τ for different values of ζ and ξ3 respectively. In Fig.6, for τ < 0, any singularity
that forms will be clothed by an event horizon, thus forming a BH. On the contrary, for τ > 0 we see that
there is a fair chance of formation of NS. Eventually what type of singularity forms depends on the initial
conditions for τ > 0. Similar results are visible in Fig.7, where trajectories are obtained for different values of
ξ3 . In both the plots the tendency of NS increases with the increase in the values of parameters ζ and ξ3 .
In Figs.8 and 9, plots have been obtained for X0 against the parameter ζ for different values of τ and

14

ξ3 respectively. In Fig.8, we see that throughout the domain of ζ trajectories exist both in the positive and
negative level. So tendency of formation of both BH and NS exists for any value of ζ and eventually depends on
the initial conditions for the final outcome. But with the increase in the value of τ the tendency of formation
of NS decreases. From Fig.9 it is evident that for ξ3 < 0, collapse results in the formation of NS, whereas
for ξ3 > 0, the generic tendency is the formation of BH. In Fig.10, we can see the effect of gravity’s rainbow
on the collapsing process, which is same as the previous case. Gravity’s rainbow increases the tendency of
formation of NS.
In almost all the figures we see that only one trajectory appears at the positive level, thus indicating that
only one null geodesic escapes the singularity thus making it locally naked in nature. In Fig.4 we find a striking
difference from the above fact. We see that in the ξ1 < 0 region we have three positive roots of X0 for γ1 = 3.
This would mean that the singularity formed in this case is visible to a distant observer for a sufficiently long
amount of time to make it globally naked in nature. So the Starobinsky’s model supports a globally naked
singularity. Understanding the role of initial data, it must be mentioned that any asymptotic nature near the
vertical axis (corresponds to a bundle of null geodesics escaping from the singularity) would eventually result
in global nakedness which may be the case in Figs.1, 2 and 6.

3.4

Strength of the singularity (Curvature growth near the singularity)

The strength of singularity is defined as the measure of its destructive capacity. The prime concern is that
whether extension of space-time is possible through the singularity or not under any situation. Following
Tipler [78] a curvature singularity is said to be strong if any object hitting it is crushed to zero volume. In [78]
the condition for a strong singularity is given by,
S = lim τ 2 ψ
τ →0

= lim τ 2 Rµν K µ K ν > 0
τ →0

(53)
µ

where Rµν is the Ricci tensor, ψ is a scalar given by ψ = Rµν K µ K ν , where K µ = dx
dτ is the tangent to the
non spacelike geodesics at the singularity and τ is the affine parameter. In the paper [79] Mkenyeleye et al.
have shown that,
S = lim τ 2 ψ

and

In ref. [79] it has also been shown that the relation between X0 and the limiting values of mass is given by,

and ṁ0 is given by the eqn.(56). It was shown by Dwivedi and Joshi in Ref. [53,80] that a classical singularity
in Vaidya spacetime is supposed to be a strong curvature singularity in a very strong sense. It was also
shown that the conjecture [81] that the strong curvature singularities are never naked is not true. Moreover
the structure of such NS were studied in detail in Ref. [82] and it was shown that the singularity presents
a directional behaviour in terms of curvature growth along the singular geodesics. In a quantum regime the
singularity formed is supposed to become gravitationally weak, thus allowing a continuous extension of the
spacetime beyond the singularity [83]. Below we study the strength of the singularities for the different models.

(60)

The above equation can be investigated for roots and using these values of X0 in the eqn.(59) we get the
conditions for which S = lim τ 2 ψ > 0, i.e. the conditions under which we get a strong singularity. For a strong
singularity we have from eqn.(59)
2δ1 X05 − γ1 X04 + 2ξ1 X0 + 3ǫ1 < 0

(61)

where X0 can be obtained as solutions of eqn.(60). Since eqn.(60) is a fifth degree algebraic equation in X0 , it
is difficult to get a general solution for X0 by the known mathematical methods. However we can get various
solutions numerically. Below we give a particular example of this.
Example
Here we find out the roots of eqn.(60) for a particular set of values of the parameters involved. Considering γ1 = 1, δ1 = 0.1, ξ1 = 0.5, ǫ1 = 10, the roots of the eqn.(60) are found to be X0 = −1.0636 −
1.23735 i, − 1.0636 + 1.23735 i, 1.26098 − 1.52332 i, 1.26098 + 1.52332 i, 9.60523. Taking the real value
of X0 = 9.60523 and the above values of the parameters we get S = −42.7027 < 0 from eqn.(59). Hence for
this particular set of values the singularity is weak. Similarly for a different set of initial conditions we may
have different results.

(67)

Just like the Starobinsky’s model, it is difficult to obtain a general solution for X0 from the above equation.
So we will resort to a numerical solution and give a particular example of it.
Example
Here we consider the following set of numerical values for the parameters involved,
γ3 = 1, γ4 = 0.1, δ3 = 0.1, δ4 = 0.5, ξ3 = 0.5, ǫ3 = 10, A = 2, B = 5
Using these values in eqn.(67) we get the roots as,
X0 = −1.26336 − 1.03348 i, − 1.26336 + 1.03348 i, 0.6967 − 1.70004 i, 0.6967 + 1.70004 i, 2.05924. Taking
the real value of X0 = 2.05924 and the above values of the parameters we get S = −37.177 < 0 from eqn.(66).
Hence for this particular set of values the singularity is weak. But by changing the initial conditions we may
have different results.

A Thermodynamical Analysis of the System

Here we will study the thermodynamical properties of the models. Thermodynamics is the heart of any
physical process which deals with exchange of heat to and from the system. So this study is crucial in our
analysis as it involves a collapsing mechanism and eventually the formation of a singularity which can be either
a BH or NS. It is a well known fact that BH thermodynamics is a very important topic of astrophysics. In a
fundamental theory of quantum gravity, it is expected that the thermodynamic properties of a system should
emerge from a microscopic statistical description. Deriving motivation from these facts we proceed to study
the thermodynamical aspects of the BHs formed as a result of collapse for the various models.

r for the Starobinsky’s model. In this section we have used the rainbow functions given by eqn.(4). In the
thermodynamic parameters it is seen that the rainbow function present is F (E). So if we use the rainbow
functions given by eqn.(3) as used in the collapse study, the results would correspond to that of GR (since
F (E) = 1). This is the reason why we choose a different set of values for the rainbow functions for the
thermodynamic study. Moreover by using different values of F (E) we can understand the effect of gravity’s

Conclusion and Discussion

In this work we have investigated rainbow modified f (R) gravity via a gravitational collapse and thermodynamical study. We have considered a non-static (time dependent) geometry, namely the Vaidya spacetime
for our study. The collapsing procedure being a time dependent phenomenon justifies our choice. Rainbow
modifications to Vaidya geometry was considered, thus making the spacetime energy dependent in nature. As
discussed earlier the rainbow modifications to a metric is significant only in the quantum regime, i.e. when
the energy of the particle probed is comparable to the Planck energy (EP ≈ 1019 GeV ) and the length scale
tends to the Planck length (LP ≈ 10−33 cm). Under such a scenario the quantum fluctuations will be at play,
and will have far reaching effect on the dynamics of the system. This was the motivation of our model and
we wanted to probe such effects via a theoretical framework.
The field equations for such a system was derived for the general f (R) expression. In order to get a
solution of the system, we needed to consider various models of f (R) gravity. In this work we considered the
famous inflationary Starobinsky’s model and the Power law model of f (R) gravity with suitable motivations.
Solutions for each of these models were obtained separately which gave the mass of the collapsing system as
a function of both the radial and temporal coordinates. Using them in the metric we obtained the geometries
for each of the models. Here it should be mentioned that in the process of solving the system we have used
the (11) component of the field equations given by eqn.(25). This has been done purely due to the simplicity
of the equation compared to the others with no other bias. This choice helped us to reduce our computational
efforts considerably, but in doing so we have missed out on a very important parameter, namely the density
parameter ρ of the matter content of the system. This is solely because ρ did not feature in the (11) component
of the field equations and hence remained absent in the subsequent analysis. So in our analysis dependence of
the collapsing procedure on the matter content of the system could not be studied, which in turn restricted
us from mapping our results to various cosmological eras.
A geodesic study was performed in order to study the collapsing procedure of the star in both the models.
The study was aimed at enquiring the nature of singularity resulting from the collapse. A singularity censored
by an event horizon will be a BH, but any singularity devoid of such horizon will be a naked one and easily
accessible from the outside. So the loss of information and other problems posed by a BH will cease to exist
for such type of singularities. This motivated us to initiate such a study. However the complexity of the

24

systems provoked us to use numerical analysis in our study. In this context we mention here that our choice
for the functions fi (t), i = 1, 2, 3...12 seems to be self similar in nature. This has been done in accordance
with the definition of X0 in eqn.(42), such that the gradient t/r can be formed without much complications.
However, naturally the question arises that what would happen if we consider non self-similar terms? From
the mathematical framework we see that under the limit r → 0, t → 0 non self-similar terms will result in the
deletion of crucial terms or in the creation of mathematically undefined terms, both of which are undesirable.
Deletion of important terms will result in loss of information about the system while undefined terms will make
further mathematical computations next to impossible. From the study it is seen that NS is quite a possibility
along with BH for the collapsing models. Fine tuning the initial conditions we may get NS or BH for different
ranges of the parameters involved. It should be mentioned that this is a significant counter-example of the
cosmic censorship hypothesis. Moreover it is seen that the naked singularity formed can be globally naked for
certain scenarios.
An important result that we have derived from this study is that under the effect of gravity’s rainbow
there is greater tendency of formation of NS. The deviations produced by the presence of rainbow functions
favours the formation of NS. This is a very interesting finding given the renewed interest of scientists in NS.
It is admitted that the result obtained depends on the initial data, which is expected from previous works
like [54,84]. Over the years it has been seen that the role of initial data is central to any study of gravitational
collapse. We know that we have not been able to detect a NS till date. In the light of such a comment it seems
that our work loses some significance. But on the contrary we would like to emphasize on the fact that our
work should generate widespread motivations for the search of NS. This is more so because for quite sometime
it is strongly believed that with the failure of cosmic censorship we would come face to face with the laws of
quantum gravity, whenever gravitational collapse of a distant star results in a NS. Thus a complete Theory
Of Everything (TOE) needs a proper knowledge of NS, which can act as a laboratory for quantum gravity.
We have also investigated the conditions for a strong singularity for different models. The conditions have
been derived and supplemented with suitable examples where required. Finally we have concluded our analysis
with a thermodynamical study of the system. Expressions for various thermodynamical parameters like the
thermalization temperature, Internal energy, etc. have been deduced for the models and their nature have
been analyzed via various plots. In a classical set-up it is expected that the thermalization temperature (T )
should decrease with distance from the core of the star or with an increase in the size of the star. From the
definition of the Internal energy (U ) it is clear that its value should increase with the size of the star for a
given T . Similarly the Helmholtz free energy F1 should also increase with an increase in r, given its definition
and relative trends of T and U . Our results show deviations from the above expected results. Such deviations
can be attributed to the quantum fluctuations of our model. Our study reveals information that characterizes
a quantum evolution of the universe. So we are hopeful on the fact that these results will be useful in any
future attempts towards the formulation of a successful theory of quantum gravity.
