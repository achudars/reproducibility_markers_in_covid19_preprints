(Updated March 12, 2021)
In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, governments have encouraged and
ordered citizens to practice social distancing, particularly by working and studying at home. Intuitively,
only a subset of people have the ability to practice remote work. However, there has been little research on
the disparity of mobility adaptation across different income groups in US cities during the pandemic. The
authors worked to fill this gap by quantifying the impacts of the pandemic on human mobility by income
in Greater Houston, Texas. We determined human mobility using pseudonymized, spatially disaggregated
cell phone location data. A longitudinal study across estimated income groups was conducted by measuring
the total travel distance, radius of gyration, number of visited locations, and per-trip distance in April 2020
compared to the data in a baseline. An apparent disparity in mobility was found across estimated income
groups. In particular, there was a strong negative correlation (ρ = -0.90) between a traveler’s estimated
income and travel distance in April. Disparities in mobility adaptability were further shown since those in
higher income brackets experienced larger percentage drops in the radius of gyration and the number of
distinct visited locations than did those in lower income brackets. The findings of this study suggest a need
to understand the reasons behind the mobility inflexibility among low-income populations during the
pandemic. The study illuminates an equity issue which may be of interest to policy makers and researchers
alike in the wake of an epidemic.

A need for addressing inequity in urban mobility during the epidemic was apparent.

1. INTRODUCTION

aimed to “flatten the curve” of infections by introducing
measures to decrease physical contact between individuals,
including implementing travel restrictions, enforcing border
closures, and encouraging social distancing (Block et al., 2020;
Chinazzi et al., 2020; de Haas et al., 2020; Hsiang et al., 2020;
Phan and Narayan, 2020; Ruktanonchai et al., 2020). In 2020, the
United States federal government implemented travel
restrictions and travel warnings for heavily-infected regions
beginning in late January and early February, and state and local
governments issued “stay-at-home” and social distancing orders
by mid-March (Peirlinck et al., 2020). As a result, American
travel behaviors have dramatically changed in terms of origins,
destinations, modes, and travel frequency due to COVID-19 and

T

HE pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has
had a significant worldwide impact in terms of health and
economy (Acter et al., 2020; Torales et al., 2020). As of January
30, 2021, the total number of confirmed cases has surpassed 100
million globally and 25 million in the United States alone. The
death toll by this same date reached over 2.1 million globally and
429,000 in the United States (World Health Organization,
2021).
In the absence of effective pharmaceutical treatments,
one of the practices believed to be effective at limiting the spread
of COVID-19 was reducing the degree of physical contact with
others and minimizing exposure to the virus. Governments have

the associated health and government mobility orders (Barbieri
et al., 2020; De Vos, 2020).

et al., 2010). Therefore, it is possible to estimate one’s
socioeconomic variables based on data obtained from mobile
devices (Frias-Martinez et al., 2010; Soto et al., 2011), though
the estimation accuracy depends on urban structures. As Prestby
et al. (2019) found in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, individual human
mobility patterns seem to have clear differences among different
socioeconomic groups especially where practical residential
segregation exists.

While these temporary restrictions on human
mobility have negatively affected short-term economic and
employment growth (Nicola et al., 2020), they showed some
positive disease-containment effects in May and June 2020;
during these two months, newly confirmed COVID-19 cases
and fatalities dropped in many regions (Block et al., 2020;
Courtemanche et al., 2020; Thu et al., 2020). Improvements
were assumed to be at least partially due to the public’s
observance of the executive orders. However, different groups
of the population may have engaged in different degrees of
change in behaviors as shown by travel distance, frequency,
modal shift, work schedules, and remote working (Kramer and
Kramer, 2020). In fact, medical records suggest that individuals
within urban areas have faced different hospitalization rates and
fatality rates per capita depending on their economic status
(Raifman and Raifman, 2020). In addition, a longitudinal survey
in the United States indicates a smaller proportion of lowerincome respondents shifted to remote work by July than did
higher-income respondents (Circella, 2020). The different
changes in behavior within different groups are worthy of a
special study in order for policy makers to make effective policies
and maintain social equity in future decision making.

2.2 COVID-19 and travelers’ mobility
In the hope of revealing the effects of mobility change
on the spread of this infectious disease, scholars have
investigated cell phone location data to report overall reductions
in human mobility measures during the COVID-19 pandemic.
In Italy, Pepe et al. (2020) analyzed anonymized cell phone
location data from Cuebiq, Inc. aggregated by province and
found a reduction greater than 30 percent in total trips and in
the radius of gyration during the country’s first lockdown
compared to baselines before the COVID-19 outbreak.
Bonaccorsi et al. (2020) investigated proprietary mobility data
from Facebook, Inc. aggregated by Italian municipalities and
reported larger mobility reductions in municipalities with
higher fiscal capacity.
In Tokyo, Japan, Yabe et al. (2020) analyzed cell phone
location data provided by Yahoo! Japan Corporation and
reported a negative correlation between assumed taxable income
per household and the reduction in mobility during the country’s
state of emergency. They also mention the scarcity of research
on how human mobility, stratified by different economic
statuses, has been affected by the pandemic.

2. LITERATURE REVIEW
The literature reviewed for this study is organized
according to several areas as follows.
2.1 Human mobility and location characteristics
As mobile communication devices have integrated
into society over the past two decades, researchers have gained
insights through the location data provided by these devices.
Nowadays, it has been known that travelers’ mobility is well
characterized by variables such as the travel distance,
approximate spatial range of travel, and the frequency of
uniquely visited locations. González et al. (2008) defined an
approximate range of activity space as the “radius of gyration”
(the average distance to observed locations from the center of
mass of all sets of observations for an individual traveler). Based
on estimated mobile phone user trajectories within Voronoi
cells, the researchers found that the trip distance distributions
can be modeled with great accuracy as a function of the radius of
gyration, which is a function of the measurement period.
Additional literature reports that individual human mobility
follows highly repetitive, predictable patterns (e.g., home-office
and home-school) on a daily basis (Schneider et al., 2013; Song

Multiple mobility studies have been conducted in the
United States. Weill et al. (2020) performed a panel regression
analysis on aggregated mobility metrics by census tract and
county across the United States. Based on four mobility metrics
(i.e., “Completely at Home” (SafeGraph, Inc.), Median Distance
Traveled (SafeGraph, Inc.), Device Exposure (PlaceIQ, Inc.), and
“Retail and Recreation” (Google, LLC)) by aggregated income
quantiles, they concluded high-income areas had larger
reductions in mobility than low-income areas. Their model
considered the effect of federal policies which applied to all
counties. Jay et al. (2020) compared SafeGraph mobility metrics
across US census block groups by aggregated income quintile.
Using January and February 2020 as the baseline, a differencein-differences linear regression revealed that in April, people in
high-income neighborhoods spent more time at home
compared to those who lived in low-income neighborhoods. At

a regional level, Apple, Inc. (2020) and Google, LLC (2020)
reported an approximate 60 percent reduction in the number of
routing requests within map services in Houston, Texas, in April
2020 from their assumed baselines.

Paralleling existing literature, our hypothesis is that
higher income is associated with larger absolute and relative
mobility reductions in April 2020 compared to the baseline of
January and February 2020.

2.3 Research gaps and contribution

The following subsection includes a brief description
of the Texas COVID-19 timeline through April 2020, with a
focus on the Greater Houston area, to provide context for the
analysis presented in this study. Readers familiar with the
COVID-19 situation in Texas may skip to the following section
that describes the methodology.

Most existing human mobility research on COVID-19
uses nationwide aggregated zonal mobility statistics at either
state or county levels. As of early 2021, few longitudinal studies
have been conducted on COVID-19-related mobility using
spatially disaggregated cell phone location data. It is hard to
conclude at a nationwide level that the observed differences in
mobility patterns were due to inequity rather than to actions
based on enacted policies or personal beliefs. In fact, observed
mobility patterns also varied across states that imposed different
degrees of travel restrictions (Abouk and Heydari, 2021). The
linkage between human mobility patterns during the pandemic
and economic status are especially worth studying within a
region under a uniform policy. It also should be noted that most
existing research in this topic relies on proprietary mobility
metrics, so fundamental variables characterizing human
mobility (e.g., radius of gyration) have rarely been reported. If
records correctly suggest that the disproportionality in COVID19 fatalities is correlated with disparity among income groups of
the population and their different levels of mobility, it would
naturally allude to a possible correlation between economic
status and change in mobility during the pandemic.

2.4 COVID-19 timeline in Texas
The first confirmed-positive case of COVID-19 in
Texas was reported in Fort Bend County on March 4, 2020, with
about a dozen more cases quickly following (Texas Department
of State Health Services, 2020a). The first confirmed death
caused by COVID-19 in Texas was reported in Matagorda
County on March 14 (Texas Department of State Health
Services, 2020b). The Governor of Texas declared a state of
disaster on March 13 for all counties in Texas (Office of the
Texas Governor, 2020). Over the next few days, metropolitan
areas including Houston ordered the closure of restaurants and
bars and imposed stricter guidelines on the size of social
gatherings.
The governor instituted GA-14 at the end of March
which minimized social gathering and encouraged social
distancing from April 2 through April 30, 2020 (Abbott, 2020).
Additionally, the Harris County judge implemented a “Stay
Home, Stay Safe” order from March 24 through April 24, making
it one of 51 counties in Texas to enact “stay-at-home” orders by
the end of March (Harris County, 2020; Wilson, 2020). As of
April 30, Texas had over 28,000 confirmed cases and 780
confirmed fatalities (Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, 2020; Johns Hopkins University & Medicine
Coronavirus Research Center, 2020).

This effort aims to fill the research gap by
investigating the impact of COVID-19 and the associated
containment policies on the mobility of individual travelers with
varying income levels through spatially disaggregated mobility
data from one metropolitan area: Greater Houston (HoustonThe Woodlands-Sugar Land). The authors approach this
objective through observing multiple mobility measures (i.e.,
total trip distance, radius of gyration, number of distinct visited
locations, and per-trip distance) in April 2020, during which an
executive order to restrict “non-essential” travels was in effect
throughout Texas.

The effects of the stay-at-home orders on human
mobility were apparent in Harris County. According to the
Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), the percentage of
people not traveling from home in Harris County, Texas, was
reported as approximately 16.9 percent, or approximately
794,800 people, in January (Bureau of Transportation Statistics,
2020); these people are assumed to stay home for reasons other
than the global COVID-19 pandemic. In March and April, this
percentage increased to 20 percent (945,300 people), and 23.6
percent (1,107,800 people), respectively; in May and June, it
dropped back toward the baseline with 19.3 percent (906,600

To the authors’ knowledge, this study appears to be
one of the first longitudinal studies using spatially disaggregated
travel data to reveal mobility change from the income
perspective in the United States. Results regarding mobility
changes across income brackets would allow policy makers to
make informed decisions regarding economic viability and social
equity.

people) and 19.7 percent (925,200 people) respectively. Within
Harris County, BTS used anonymized mobile phone data to
record the average number of daily trips as approximately
15,952,000 and 16,736,000 trips in January and February. As
people began to work from home, the average number of daily
trips dropped to about 14,593,000 and 12,028,000 trips in March
and April, respectively

After this procedure, 46,047,382 data points from
26,059 people were kept for analysis. These data points
correspond to approximately 6.6 million person trips.
3.2 Variables
As an independent variable, per-capita income in the
2018 American Community Survey (ACS) (United States
Census Bureau, 2020) was used. In the United States, one census
tract represents a community that represents a somewhathomogeneous cluster of approximately 4,000 residents. The
ACS was overlaid at the resolution of United States census tracts
using a circular area with 0.5-mi diameter around each traveler’s
median latitude and longitude of the first and last records of each
day during the study periods. When the circular cordon
overlapped multiple census tracts, the weighted average of the
census incomes was considered to be that person’s most probable
income. While each observation was collected on a roadway, it
is reasonable to assume each observation was geographically in
or near users’ residential neighborhood when the data were
aggregated (Chen et al., 2014). This geographical assumption is
a methodological limitation of our research. However, a
reasonable level of accuracy was expected because Houston is
known as one of the most residentially segregated metropolises
in the United States (Fry and Taylor, 2012). Overlaying income
typically commits an ecological fallacy to some extent; however,
the segregated nature of Houston neighborhoods lessens this
fallacy, and the projected income in this paper are conceptually
similar to the likely degree of financial appanage. The procedure
narrowed down our samples to 10,398 individuals who were
presumed to reside within Greater Houston (Fig. 1).

3. METHODS
The authors used Microsoft Office 365 ProPlus,
PostGIS 3.0, QGIS 3.14, and Julia 1.4.1 (Bezanson et al., 2017) to
investigate spatiotemporal changes in human mobility through
smartphone location data along with projected income.
3.1 Mobility data and samples
Pseudonymized iOS mobility data in January,
February, and April 2020 were provided by SAFE2SAVE, LLC,
a Texas-based company operating a smartphone application
(app). The data contained 89,928,723 data points on roadways,
and each data point contained a pseudonymized user
identification number (random integers), geographical
coordinates, and a timestamp. The data contain no personal
information such as name, income, or age.
In order to examine the changes in mobility patterns
during the global COVID-19 pandemic, mobility data in April
2020 were compared to the average data in January and February
2020 (baseline). April 2020 included the entire duration of GA14 (0:00:01 a.m. on April 2, 2020, through 11:59:59 p.m. on April
30, 2020), the executive order which encouraged residents to
stay home except for essential travels. March 2020 was not
included in the study due to the varying implementation dates of
stay-at-home orders in different jurisdictions.
To ensure the April data points were comparable to
the baseline, analyses included only data of those who recorded
(i) at least one data point in April and (ii) at least one data point
per week over the eight consecutive weeks between January 5
and February 29. The second filtering intended to filter out
people who quit using the app or non-regular app users since
comparisons cannot be drawn over time when one deletes the
app during the study period. Unlike spatially aggregated data,
this is an apparent tradeoff a spatially disaggregated longitudinal
study inherits. Although this sample reduction might have
affected the results, the effect was assumed to be negligible or
rather suitable than the do-nothing alternative with respect to
the study objective.

The authors were interested in how long, how often,
and within what distance range people traveled during the
COVID-19 pandemic compared to the baseline. To answer these
questions, the monthly total travel distance, radius of gyration,
number of distinct visited locations, and per-trip distance were
computed.

All locations were aggregated with a regular hexagonal mesh of
3 km2 (1.16 mi2) (c.f. Song et al. (2010)). The number of distinct
visited locations (S) was calculated using the first and last
recorded locations of each trip. This operation resulted in the
averages of 3.39 trips per day per person in January and 3.54 trips
per day per person in February, which are close to the statewide
estimates by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (2020).
Overlapping visits were not counted even when one mesh had
recorded multiple visits by one user.

3.2.1 Total travel distance
Monthly total travel distances were calculated as the sum of
Euclidean travel distances in a series of geographical coordinates
recorded every 1.84 minutes on average. Because map matching
was not used, the computed values are expected to be smaller
than travel distances on roadways. Nevertheless, this calculation
(Equation 1) was considered a reasonable means to observe
mobility changes within subjects.

3.2.4 Per-trip distance
Per-trip distances were derived as the arithmetic mean of the
travel distance of trips made by a user (Equation 4).

3.3 Statistical Analysis
We hypothesized that there would be negative
correlations between travelers’ mobility measures and estimated
economic status. Because the income variable was an estimate,
the individuals were grouped by projected per-capita income
bracket with a 10,000-dollar interval. Income brackets that had
fewer than 100 people were included with the nearest bracket.
This approach resulted in a smaller class interval than that of Jay
et al. (2020) or Weill et al. (2020).

3.2.2 Radius of gyration
The radii of gyration for each user were calculated as follows

The distribution of trip distance, or the total distance
traveled over the duration of a trip, is known to have a long tail,
meaning a small percentage of travelers disproportionately
influence the mean and standard deviations of aggregated
mobility variables (González et al., 2008). Because the analysis of
interest was mobility trends by income groups, each dataset’s
median was used as average for further comparisons. Spearman’s
rank correlation was used on medians to examine the hypothesis
because the linearity of the variables over income was not
necessarily assumed.

4. FINDINGS

(ρ = 0.93). However, the correlation turned out to be strongly
negative in April (ρ = -0.83). The number of distinct visited
locations had strong negative correlations with the income level
both in the baseline (ρ = -0.97) and in April (ρ = -0.98). Unlike
the other variables, median mean per-trip distance was increased
in April. While per-trip distance had a strong negative
correlation with the income bracket in the baseline (ρ = -0.90)
and in April (ρ = -0.76), the differences did not seem as evident
as the other variables.

Descriptive statistics of total travel distance, radius of
gyration, and number of distinct visited locations are
summarized in Table 1. The data revealed April experienced
54.7 percent, 73.6 percent, 48.1 percent, and 4.3 percent
reductions in mean total trip distances, mean radius of gyration,
mean number of distinct visited locations, and per-trip length,
respectively, from the baselines. The similar overall percent
reduction in the total travel distances (61.46 percent) was
consistent with Apple, Inc. (2020) and Google, LLC (2020) as
they report an approximately 60 percent reduction in the
number of routing requests in April compared to January.

Fig. 4- 7 present cumulative distribution functions of
total travel distance, radius of gyration, number of distinct
visited locations, and per-trip distance by projected income
bracket, respectively. It is evident that people with higher
projected income brackets had larger mobility reductions in total
travel distance, radius of gyration, and number of distinct visited
locations. For instance, median total travel distance was reduced
by 81.0 percent for individuals with a projected income group of
$80,000 or larger, but it was reduced by only 62.0 percent for
individuals with a projected income bracket of $20,000 or less,
compared to baseline travel distances. There was a strong
negative correlation (ρ = -0.90) between income and total travel
distance when comparing April values to baseline values. There
was a strong negative correlation (ρ = -0.93) between income
and radius of gyration when comparing April values to baseline
values. Median radius of gyration was reduced by 72.4 percent
for individuals with a projected income bracket of $80,000 or
larger, but it was reduced by only 32.0 percent for individuals

Fig. 3 shows median total travel distance, radius of
gyration, number of distinct visited locations, and per-trip
distance by projected per-capita income bracket.
Except for the per-trip distance, the values were lower
in April than in the baselines, indicating the overall reduction in
mobility. Because this study does not necessarily assume a linear
relationship between per-capita income and the mobility
variables, the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient, ρ, was
used to examine the rank correlations among the income group.
The total travel distance had almost no correlation (ρ = -0.05)
with the projected income bracket in the baseline, but it showed
a strong negative correlation (ρ = -0.90) with the income bracket
in April. The estimated income bracket had a strong positive
correlation with the radius of gyration in the baseline condition

with a projected income bracket of $20,000 or less, compared to
the baseline. Above the 70th percentile, all income groups
showed somewhat similar radii of gyration during April,
meaning their restricted activities happened within similar sizes
of areas while they all observed the stay-at-home and social
distancing orders. There was a strong negative correlation (ρ =
-0.86) between income and number of distinct visited locations
when comparing April values to baseline values. The number of
distinct visited locations was reduced by 59.6 percent for
individuals with a projected income bracket of $80,000 or larger,
but it was reduced by only 47.5 percent for individuals with a

projected income bracket of $20,000 or less, compared to
baseline travel distances. The figure also suggests smaller
changes in mobility among different economic brackets past
$50,000 a year, as supported by all the three aforementioned
measures. In median per-trip distance, there was a moderate
negative rank correlation between per-capita income and the
change in April from the baseline (ρ = -0.48). The drop in the
radius of gyration for the higher-income groups can be partially
explained in the context of larger baseline radii of gyrations in
baselines (January and February).

5. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

number of distinct visited locations followed a pattern similar to
the total travel distance.

This study used pseudonymized smartphone location
data to investigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on
individual human mobility from Greater Houston. This is part
of an ongoing effort to understand mobility change during the
COVID-19 pandemic in a greater detail. Our attempt was unique
in that it implemented a longitudinal study design on (i) spatially
disaggregated mobility data along with (ii) information from
census tracts to capture mobility change (iii) in a single
metropolitan statistical area with statewide executive orders to
stay at home. This study investigated human mobility from four
measures: total trip distance, radius of gyration, number of
distinct visited locations, and per-trip distance.

There was no clear disparity across income brackets
in the per-trip distance. Interestingly, per-trip distance increased
in April over the majority of percentiles regardless of the income
brackets. In median, per-trip distances increased by less than a
mile in all the estimated income groups. In general, trip distance
distribution shifts towards zero when the radius of gyration
becomes smaller (González et al., 2008). While the data do not
tell the reason behind the observed increase, it is likely that there
was a fundamental change in people’s trip choice in the midst of
the executive orders. Therefore, caution should be exercised
when one tries to apply conventional travel choice models to
data collected during travel restrictions. It is possible that people
made fewer pass-by stops at attractions, such as restaurants and
coffee shops, in April than they did in the baseline period.
However, further research would be needed to identify the
reasons behind the observed increase in per-trip distance.

5.1 Key Findings
Overall, our analyses revealed mobility adaptation
disparity by income. The data indicated that human mobility in
the Greater Houston area dropped significantly in April 2020
compared to the baseline (January and February 2020). We
found that individuals from census tracts with a higher percapita income had larger mobility reductions than people from
tracts with lower per-capita income while the de facto stay-athome orders were in effect.

Financial status was a likely factor of the compliance
or feasibility of stay-at-home orders. Considering that an
individual’s “essential” fixed expenses to maintain the reasonable
minimum standards of living (e.g., food, water, and electricity)
do not differ vastly, it is intuitive that the disparity in mobility
reduction seemed to be smaller among higher-income brackets
than lower-income brackets (Fig. 3).

In particular, the mobility disparity among income
brackets was evident in total travel distances. Before the travel
restriction, individuals tended to have similar travel distances
regardless of estimated income brackets. However, higherincome groups saw a larger decrease in travel distances than
lower-income groups in April. In April, the median travel
distance was 387.23 mi for those whose estimated per-capita
income was under $20,000 and 185.82 mi for those with
estimated income was $80,000 and over.

5.2 Implications of the Findings
The findings have meaningful social implications. It is
likely that people in lower income brackets did not or could not
reduce as much mobility as higher-income groups did during the
executive orders in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. In
total travel distance, radii of gyration, and the number of distinct
visited locations, cumulative density functions revealed
consistently lower mobility reductions for individuals in lower
income brackets throughout most percentile ranges. While
media and other articles have speculated that the
disproportionality of COVID-19 impacts by different financial
status, this is one of the first articles reporting the mobility
adaptation disparity in the United States at the census tract level.
If combined with further studies, the findings can be valuable for
macroscopic and mesoscopic COVID-19 epidemiological model
development and calibration as well as policy evaluations
hereafter.

Individuals from higher-income tracts had larger
average radii of gyration before the pandemic; these individuals
had slightly smaller radii of gyration during the executive orders
than lower-income individuals, indicating that higher-income
individuals reduced their radii of gyration more than lowerincome individuals did. With the result of the travel distance
alone, one might think the observed difference was largely due
to the fact that tracts with higher income are located in the
western center of Houston and thus enabled the residents to
travel shorter distances during the executive orders. However,
the smaller disparities in the radius of gyration and per-trip
distance implies that people in higher-income tracts likely made
fewer numbers of trips than those in lower-income tracts. The

Our findings are consistent with Circella (2020), who
reported difficulties in mobility adaptation among lower10

income populations during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Furthermore, the analyses supported what some nationwide
studies in the United States (Jay et al. 2020; Weill et al., 2020)
and abroad (Pepe et al., 2020) have also claimed: higher income
is associated with larger mobility reductions. Since those
preceding nationwide studies used aggregated location data to
compare mobility across a nation, it is noteworthy that the
disparity in mobility adaptation was observed among different
income groups within a metropolitan statistical area where
uniform executive orders were enforced. The results were in line
with media speculations, which might explain a reason behind
the disproportionate impacts of COVID-19: people with low
income did not have a practical choice to stay at home. Because
research indicates that racial residential segregation in Houston
had already been associated with poor-self reported health
before the COVID-19 outbreak (Anderson and Oncken, 2020),
it was likely that the pandemic had amplified inequity in the
society.

indicators of financial leeway than pre-tax income if such
variables are available in future research.
While this study showed an apparent disparity in
travelers’ mobility patterns during the pandemic, this study
could not distinguish the trip purposes or the movements of
specific types of workers. To reveal the reasons behind mobility
pattern change, more qualitative research would be worth
conducting. For instance, surveys about typical travel purposes
before and during the pandemic may reveal the reasons behind
the shift in travelers’ mobility (e.g., increased per-trip distance)
by controlling covariance.
This study demonstrated the potential of the use of
spatially disaggregated data on mobility research. Similar
regional research in different states and countries would further
reveal comparative impacts and generalizability of the
associations between financial status and mobility disparity
during travel restrictions. In the near future, it would be
beneficial to conduct meta-analyses to integrate insights about
mobility changes related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

5.3 Limitations and Future Research Directions
Our research had some limitations. One limitation of
the present study, as well as existing literature, was that the
mobile travel data may exhibit a systematic error. In other
words, pseudonymized individuals may not represent each
demographic group without bias. The authors still maintain
reasonable confidence due to the fact that the sample sizes are all
fairly large across the groups. In future studies, this limitation
can be addressed if sample data can be stratified based on
demographics information directly tied to mobility data.

Another limitation was that the authors did not
overlay any other socioeconomic variables (e.g., gender or
household size) associated with each census tract. This was
mainly because we preferred to avoid stacking ecological
fallacies. However, it has been known that age is a major
covariate of income as income tends to show an inverted Ushape with age (Sturman, 2003). Although it is difficult to
eliminate the effects of confounders completely, it would be ideal
to control the variable if the data availability and a research
design allows. Researchers would get results closer to the
“ground truth” if the true demographics of pseudonymized
mobility data were available. For example, essential businesses,
such as grocery stores and gas stations, remained open during
the executive orders, but there is little research that took such
factors into account because such mobility data are rarely
available to the public. When it comes to economic status,
disposable income, current assets, and net assets could be better
