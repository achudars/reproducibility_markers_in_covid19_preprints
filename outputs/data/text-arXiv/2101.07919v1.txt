Abstract
We investigate the problem of estimating the distribution of the individual reproduction number governing the COVID-19 pandemic. Under the assumption that this
random variable follows a Negative Binomial distribution, we focus on constructing
estimators of the parameters of this distribution using reported infection data and
taking into account issues like under-reporting or the time behavior of the infection
and of the reporting processes. To this end, we extract information from regionally
dissaggregated data reported by German health authorities, in order to estimate
not only the mean but also the variance of the distribution of the individual reproduction number. In contrast to the mean, the latter parameter also depends on the
unknown under-reporting rate of the pandemic. The estimates obtained allow not
only for a better understanding of the time-varying behavior of the expected value
of the individual reproduction number but also of its dispersion, for the construction
of bootstrap confidence intervals and for a discussion of the implications of different policy interventions. Our methodological investigations are accompanied by an
empirical study of the development of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany, which
shows a strong overdispersion of the individual reproduction number.

1. Introduction
The individual reproduction number R is commonly used in epidemiology to quantify the transmission of a disease. R describes the number of secondary infections

caused by a single SARS-CoV-2-positive individual. The random variable R is a very
important quantity in controlling the SARS-CoV-2-pandemic. Of special interest is
the expectation E(R) of the reproduction number, often denoted as R0 and called
basic reproduction number. A value R0 < 1 indicates that the pandemic is under control, while R0 > 1 indicates a strong warning that the pandemic is in an exponential
growth stadium. Notice that the expectation E(R) = R0 is only one parameter of the
distribution of the random variable R. Even though we treat R as a random variable,
the reproduction number also plays an important role in deterministic modeling in
epidemiology which typically is based on ordinary differential equations including the
Kermack-McKendrick epidemic model SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Removed) and the
SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed) model. For an introduction to the
reproduction number R and especially to the Basic Reproduction Number R0 we refer
to Chowell and Brauer (2009).
Estimates for R0 or R0,t , if possible changes over time are taken into account, on
the basis of observed non in-depth case numbers can be found in many papers in the
literature. A fundamental alternative would be to estimate E(R) = R0 from in-depth
tracking of infection-chains. Dehning et al. (2020b) discuss a model-free estimation of
the reproduction number R0,t and compare it with the standard techniques applied by
the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), which is the German government’s central scientific
institution in the field of biomedicine. Quite important for the various RKI-estimators
is the so-called generation duration or generation time. It should be noted, that it is
most difficult to estimate the reproduction number Rt or even its expectation R0,t
properly, at change points of the transmission (spread) of the virus, triggered for
example by specific countermeasures like social distancing or efficient cluster tracing
with prompt isolation.
We will follow the approach of developing methodology on the basis of non in-depth
reported case numbers but we will not only focus on the expectation but also on the
entire distribution of the reproduction number R. Cori et al. (2013) and also LloydSmith et al. (2005a) together with the associated supplementary material (Lloyd-Smith
et al. (2005b)) suggested a Negative Binomial distribution to model the stochastic
behavior of R. For COVID-19-pandemic data, the Negative Binomial distribution is
also used in Althouse el al. (2020) and Endo et al. (2020). Of special interest is the
ability of the Negative Binomial distribution to include possible dispersion, which is

2

rather likely to be present in the COVID-19-pandemic. Dispersion means that the
standard deviation or variance of a distribution may vary independently of the mean.
The latter for example is not possible for the also often used Poisson distribution,
for which variance and mean coincide. We refer to Azmon et al. (2014) for Poisson
modeling when describing methodology to estimate the reproduction number R. It
is worth mentioning that Azmon et al. (2014) also consider estimates of R if underreporting is present.
Strongly related to dispersion, which we will define more precisely in the next section, is the several times by epidemiological experts expressed fear that only (very) few
super-spreading events with a very high number of secondary infections could drive
the COVID-19-pandemic into a critical state. This may even be the case, when some
80 per cent of newly infected individuals in fact lead to none or only one secondary
infection and even when the expectation R0 is close to one.
In this paper we discuss and investigate the opportunities to estimate the distribution of the individual reproduction number R for the COVID-19-pandemic in Germany
on the basis of non in-depth infection data provided on a daily basis by the Robert
Koch Institute (RKI). Cumulative data about newly reported cases, totally infected
cases, fatalities as well as a 7-days incidence rate per 100,000 inhabitants can be found
on the website http://corona.rki.de. The reported cases are based on positive laboratory testing of SARS-CoV-2 and are denoted as COVID-19-cases irrespective of
COVID-19-symptoms. The data is available separately per local states (Bundesländer),
districts (Landkreise), age-groups and gender, to name only a few. When considering
daily COVID-19-cases it is important to carefully distinguish for individuals the time
t at which an SARS-CoV-2-infection took place, the time at which the case was first
reported to the (local) health authorities (if it was laboratory confirmed at all) and
the time at which the case finally was reported to RKI.
For the investigations in this paper we typically consider times t at which an infection with SARS-CoV-2 takes place. It is most likely that the difference of the time
of infection of a case, which in the end will be reported, and the time of reporting
follows a distribution over a couple of days. On average, we assume a time shift of
τ = 7 days, which seems to be reasonable. τ consists of the number of days (approximately 4) between a SARS-CoV-2 infection took place and the onset of symptoms
plus the time that elapses (after onset of symptoms) until a PCR-test is carried out

and a (positive) result becomes known (approximately another 2 days) plus the time
(approximately another day) that elapses until the case is first reported to the health
authorities. It is important to know that in Germany it is mandatory that for a person
for whom a proof of the pathogen SARS-CoV-2 is obtained (mostly by a PCR-test),
a report has to be transmitted to the local health department within 24 hours. After
this first reporting time to the health authorities the reporting chain is continued via
the responsible state health authorities to the Robert Koch Institute, which will take
further days.
For this paper the relevant times are the infection time and the time of the first reporting. We denote by RKIs the number of COVID-19-cases first reported at time s
to the health authorities. Then, roughly speaking the number of infections at time t,
which in the end will be reported, and RKIt+τ are related to each other.
Figure 1 displays the daily data RKIt for the second, third and fourth quarter of 2020
together with a moving average smoothing over 7 days. Averaging over 7 days seems
to be appropriate since a very strong periodic behavior of RKIt over the week is observed. The reason for this most likely lies in the fact that the reporting chain between
weekdays and weekends is substantially different. We argued that it is important to
4

estimate not only the expectation but also the dispersion or equivalently the variance
of the individual reproduction number R, for example in order to assess whether or
not this quantity changes over time. To do so we present a setup of assumptions under
which we are able to give reasonable estimates of the variance (or dispersion) of R. To
this end it appears to be necessary to rely on COVID-19-data on district (Landkreis)
level in Germany.
As a result it will be seen that the parameters of the distribution of R indeed have
changed over time and that dispersion (even over-dispersion) is rather relevant. We
will make the implication of this clear and we also report upon simulation results
which describe the changes in the behavior of the development of the pandemic if the
rather relevant super-spreading events are (to some extend) quickly discovered by the
health authorities with the result that a substantial part of the secondary infected
individuals in such a super-spreading event can promptly be isolated.
There exist already numerous papers in the literature which investigate the effects
of social distancing or contact bans and also of cluster tracing within a variety of
models. Dehning et al. (2020a) used MCMC-sampling in a SIR-model and obtained
that already in case of mild social distancing a substantial reduction of the spreading
rate is achieved. Contreras et al. (2020) describe that contact tracing is very effective
in stabilizing the number of infections (i.e. the observed number of newly infected
individuals approaches a constant value), while inefficient contact tracing leads to an
approximately exponential growth of the number of infections. Moreover, the paper
emphasizes that a combination of symptom-based testing together with effective contact tracing appears to be most effective. Additionally Linden et al. (2020) describe
clearly that a break-down of a TTI-strategy (Test-Trace-Isolate) will lead to an increasing number of not-reported COVID-19-cases and therefore accelerates the spread
of the virus.
The paper is organized as follows. In the next section we describe our modeling and
state the main assumptions used for our results. Section 3 presents the proposed estimators of the mean and of the variance of the individual reproduction number taking
into account under-reporting and the time behavior of the infection and of the reporting chain. Section 4 introduces Bootstrap-based confidence intervals for R0 . Section 5
examines the fit of the distributional assumptions made, presents estimators describing the development of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany, and studies effectiveness

5

of cluster tracing.

2. Modeling and Assumptions
As already mentioned, the Negative Binomial distribution has been suggested in the
literature as an appropriate model to describe the randomness of the reproduction
number R. The Negative Binomial distribution with parameters p ∈ (0, 1) and r ∈ N
is well-known in statistics for modeling the number of failures in a sequence of independent Bernoulli(p)-trials until the r-th success occurs. It has been extended to
parameters p ∈ (0, 1) and r ∈ (0, ∞) (we use the abbreviation N B(p, r)) via a consideration of a classical Poisson-distribution with random parameter λ distributed according to a specific Gamma-distribution. To be precise a random variable R possesses
a (generalized) Negative Binomial distribution N B(p, r), if and only if

The Negative Binomial distribution as a generalized Poisson distribution allows for
a more flexible modeling of rare events with different expectation and variance. For
R ∼ N B(p, r) we have
E(R) =

r (1 − p)
and
p

Var(R) =

r (1 − p)
.
p2

(2)

Typically the expectation E(R) is denoted by R0 . The Negative Binomial distribution
possesses a coefficient of variation CV(R) = Var(R)/E(R) = 1/p, and allows for
modeling the distribution of the reproduction number R with dispersion.
The dispersion parameter κ is defined through


R0 
Var(R) = R0 · 1 +
,
κ

(3)

which leads to κ = r (cf. Lloyd-Smith et al. (2005a)). The dispersion parameter κ and

6

the coefficient of variation both are widely used to quantify the size of the variance
given the expectation of a random variable. For fixed E(R) = R0 we have that the
smaller r the larger is the variance of the reproduction number R. To see that κ and
CV behave rather the same let us assume two sets of parameters (p, r) and (pe, re) of
Negative Binomial distributions describing the random behavior of two reproduction

e (with dispersion parameters κ and κ
e = R0
numbers R and R
e). If we fix ER = ER
then

e
CV(R)
κ · (R0 + κ

CV(R)
κ
e · (R0 + κ)

(4)

which is a decreasing function in κ
e.
For Negative Binomial distributions it is known that r → ∞ and p → 1, such that
r(1−p) → λ ∈ (0, ∞), leads to a classical Poisson(λ)-limit, while for r = 1 the Negative
Binomial distribution coincides with the geometric distribution with parameter p.
We will model the number of secondary infections caused by an individual COVID19-case with infection time (day) t, i.e., the reproduction number Rt at time t, via
a N B(pt , rt )-distribution. If we further denote the number of newly infected cases at
time t by Nt , we then are faced with a total of
Nt
X

Si,t ,

(5)

i=1

secondary infections in the future. Here S1,t , S2,t , . . . denote i.i.d. random variables
distributed according to N B(pt , rt ). It should be noted that the random variables
Si,t , i = 1, 2, . . . , are i.i.d. copies of Rt . In order to avoid confusion we decided to
use the notation Rt for the generic reproduction number, while we label the random
secondary infections from a single infected individual by Si,t .
For several reasons not all of these future cases will be reported to the German
health authorities and subsequently will not show up in the RKI-statistics of newly
laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-cases. One major, but not the only reason for this
under-reporting is that a substantial number of SARS-CoV-2-infections are asymptomatic. The studies Buitrago-Garcia al. (2020) and Oran and Topol (2020) report
that percentages of asymptomatic cases vary between 20% to 45%. These values coincide with results from a study in the community of Kupferzell (Germany), where a
percentage of asymptomatic cases of 24.5% has been observed, cf. Santos-Hövener et

7

al. (2020).
Although it seems difficult to assess the exact rate of under-reporting, this rate is
of course a relevant quantity when investigating the development of the pandemic.
Some studies state rates of not reported cases up to 80%. See for example Streeck et
al. (2020), where a 5-fold higher number of infections than the number of officially
reported cases for a specific community in Germany with a super-spreading event is
reported or the already cited study in Kupferzell (Santos-Hövener et al. (2020)), where
is was observed that six times more adults than reported have been infected, which
is a rate of under-reporting of 80% or even higher. This coincides with statements
made by the RKI, that the number of infected individuals approximately is 4-6 times
higher than the number of reported cases. Besides this, the RKI stated that there is
no evidence for a substantial change of this factor over the last months. Finally, Rahmandad et al. (2020), in a study across 86 nations, found out that under-reporting
varies substantially over countries. For Germany, Rahmandad et al. (2020) estimated
a ratio of actual to reported cases of about 6 to 7.
In this paper we denote the proportion of COVID-19-cases reported to the German
health authorities by p0,t , and allow this rate to vary (slowly) with time. A value of
p0,t ≈ 0.2 seems realistic in the light of the studies cited.
From a number of Nt newly infected individuals at time t we therefore will see within
the statistics of RKI only a binomial thinned selection of Nt , which we denote by Nt0 .
According to our assumption of a reporting rate of p0,t and because of a not small
number of cases it is reasonable to assume that, approximately,
Nt0
≈ p0,t .
Nt

(6)

It is worth mentioning that the number of reported cases Nt0 out of infections happened
at time t do not show up within the RKI-statistics neither at time t nor at a single
time point in the future. Rather, occurrence in the RKI-statistics will spread over a
span of days.

P t
This further means that from the total number N
i=1 Si,t of secondary infections
PNt e
caused by Nt primary infections we only observe i=1 Si,t laboratory-confirmed cases
with the statistics of RKI, where Sei,t possesses a Binomial-distribution with parameters
Si,t and p0,t . Equivalently, the number of reported SARS-CoV-2 secondary infections

8

out of a cohort of Nt primary infected individuals can be written as
Si,t
Nt X
X

Zi,j ,

(7)

i=1 j=1

where (Zi,j , i, j ∈ N) is a family of i.i.d. Bernoulli(p0,t )-distributed random variables.
Success, i.e. Zi,j = 1, means that a secondary infected individual gets a positive
COVID-19-test at some day in the future. As stated above it is of course not realistic
P t PSi,t
to assume that all N
i=1
j=1 Zi,j cases will show up in the RKI-statistics at one single
day. Rather occurrence of these cases in the RKI-statistics will spread over a span of
some days.
Before further elaborating on this point let us take a look at the distribution
PNt
of the total numbers of secondary infections
i=1 Si,t and reported secondary inPNt e
fections
i=1 Si,t . Since it is known that the Negative Binomial distribution is
additive, we immediately obtain, assuming independence of the single cases, that
PNt
e
i=1 Si,t ∼ N B(pt , Nt · rt ). Moreover, Si,t is a Binomial-thinning of Si,t . The property that Binomial-thinning changes the parameter but not the family of Poissondistributions carries over to the family of Negative Binomial distributions, cf. Lemma
1 of the Appendix. This means that we end up with
Sei,t ∼ N B(qt , rt ), i = 1, 2, . . . ,

(8)

with
qt =

pt
.
p0,t + pt − p0,t · pt

(9)

The parameter qt depends on the hardly known percentage p0,t of SARS-CoV-2infections reported to the health authorities. Furthermore,
Nt

Sei,t ∼ N B(qt , Nt · rt ).

(10)

i=1

So far we focused on time points t at which SARS-CoV-2-infections take place. We
already discussed in the introduction that these time points t should not be confused
with the time points at which SARS-CoV-2-infections are first reported to the health
authorities (recall that we denoted the number of COVID-19-cases first reported at
time point t to the health authorities by RKIt ). We argued that there is a (random)

9

time shift between these two time points with a likely mean of τ = 7.
So as not to make things too complicated and still take time shifts as well as random
fluctuations of reporting delays over a span of days into account, we make the following
two assumptions

The first assumption means that newly infected cases, which are of a type that will
be reported in the future, summed up over a week approximately will occur in the
RKI-statistics also within a week but shifted by τ days to the future, while the second
PNt−4 e
assumption is a relaxation of Nt0 ≈ i=1
Si,t−4 . The latter assumption would mean
that secondary infections occur with a fixed time delay of 4 days to the primary
infection. Instead of such a strict assumption (12) means that the two quantities are
roughly the same if they are summed up over a week. Here the number 4 can be
viewed as generation time of the virus.

3. Estimation of Parameters of the Distribution of the Reproduction

b7 reflects the reproduction behavior apcf. (11) and (12). It is often noted that R
0,t
proximately 14 days ago. To understand this, notice that we need two generations of
SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals in order to be able to compute reproduction numbers. Since the generation time of SARS-CoV-2 is approximately 4 days and since the

10

proposed computation of the reproduction number uses a left-sided smoothing over
7 days (cf. (13)), which leads to a time-shift of 3, a reasonable reproduction number
can only be calculated with a delay of 4 + 3 days after primary infections have taken

which is the expectation R0,t−τ −7 of the reproduction number Rt−τ −7 we are interested
in.
In order to be able to estimate both parameters r and p of a Negative Binomial fit to
the distribution of the reproduction number R we further need an estimator of Var(R).
For this we need somehow replicates of realizations of R, which we will obtain from
reported COVID-19-cases on district level from Germany. In total, Germany is divided
into about 401 districts with population numbers ranging from 34, 193 to 3, 669, 491.
For each district RKI provides daily COVID-19-cases along the same guidelines as
11

for Germany as a whole. As before we denote the number of newly infected (not
necessarily reported!) COVID-19-cases by Nt,` , where t counts the day (time) and
` = 1, . . . , L = 401 denotes the number of the district. For a single primary infected
individual we assume that the total number of secondary infected persons possesses
a N B(pt , rt )-distribution, which does not depend on the district. The total number
of secondary infections caused by Nt,` primary infected individuals then follows a
N B(pt , Nt,` · rt )-distribution. Following the arguments in Section 2 we obtain that
the total number of (in the end) reported SARS-CoV-2- secondary infections out of a
0 , is distributed
number of Nt,` primary infections in district `, which we denote by Nt,`

according to N B(qt , Nt,` · rt ), cf. (14) and (13). Note that if there is evidence that the
infection rates of some districts differs highly from the infection rates of the others
then a subset selection might be preferable.
In order to relate the number of daily first reported cases RKIt,` within district `
0 , for which the reporting is spread
with the total number of secondary infections Nt,`

over some of days, we assume in accordance with (11) and (12) for each district ` =

estimator for Var(Sei,t−τ −7 )/p0,t−τ −7 , i.e., the variance of the number of reported SARSCoV-2-secondary infection cases from a single infected individual scaled by 1/p0,t−τ −7 .

Note that not necessarily an independence assumption across districts is required in
order for (23) to be a consistent estimator. Only consistency of sample moments is
required, which, for instance, can be achieved under some rather weak dependence
assumptions. This means that neighboring districts may be dependent but districts
which are far apart from each other should behave nearly independent.

As it is seen, and in contrast to the expectation (cf. (17)), the variance of the reproduction number based on COVID-19-cases reported to the health authorities depends on
the unknown reporting rate p0,t . Since the reporting rate p0,t cannot be estimated from
reported data we only can calculate variance estimators for a variety of assumed report-

4. Bootstrap Confidence Intervals
Besides estimating the mean and the variance of the individual reproduction number
Rt as well as the parameters of the corresponding Negative Binomial distribution, it
is important to construct confidence intervals for the unknown mean R0,t . According

see also the discussion before and after equation (21) for the same property for observations obtained at the district level. Recall that this distribution depends on the
unknown under-reporting rate p0,t−14 . Based on expression (27) the following parametric bootstrap procedure can be proposed for constructing a confidence interval for
the mean R0,t−14 of the individual reproduction number.

Notice that the above algorithm imitates also the dependence in generating the

random sums ( 6s=0 RKIt−s )∗ by using the time dependent parameters pbt−14 and
P
rbt−14 as well as the (by four time units) lagged sum ( 6s=0 RKIt−s−4 )∗ . Since we
P
need pbt−14 and rbt−14 , to generate ( 6s=0 RKIt−s )∗ , our bootstrap algorithm starts for
t = 15 and needs starting values like those given in Step 1.
A simplified version of the proposed bootstrap algorithm can be applied when interest is focused in the construction of a confidence interval for a particular time point

algorithm essentially estimates via Monte Carlo the percentage points of the Negative

5. Applications
5.1. Validating the Negative Binomial Hypothesis
We first investigate the suitability of the assumed Negative Binomial distribution for
describing the random behavior of the individual reproduction number using the num17

ber of infections reported by RKI. Toward this end and as for estimating the variance,
we focus on reported COVID-19-cases on district level, i.e., on the observations RKIt,` .
This allows for getting replicates of the random variable of interest and, therefore, for
testing the hypothesis that the individual reproduction number follows a Negative
Binomial distribution. Recall that in our discussion in Section 3, it was assumed that
the sum of reported cases over the time points t, t − 1, . . . , t − 6 in district `, that is,
P6
s=0 RKIt−s,` , satisfies (τ = 7),

(29)

In order to select from the existing data appropriate samples for testing the above
assumption, we proceed as follows. We first select all districts for which the average
of reported cases at time points t − 4, t − 5, . . . , t − 11 is approximately the same.
Practically, this means that we consider districts for which
6

1X
RKIt−4−s,` ∈ [15, 25].
7

(30)

s=0

We have experienced that chosen a number of average daily infections at district
level outside the above interval, leads to the selection of a relatively small number of
districts, that is to a small sample size. Let Lt,S be the total number of districts at
time point t satisfying condition (30) and let {1, 2, . . . , Lt,S } be the corresponding set
of districts. From the total number of time points t available, we further only consider
those time points, for which Lt,S ≥ 75. This ensures that a sufficiently large number of
districts is available for testing the hypothesis of interest. After applying this selection
procedure to the RKIt,` data, we end up with a total of T = 45 data points t for
18

which the corresponding condition (30) and Lt,S ≥ 75 is satisfied.
The problem of testing the goodness-of-fit of a Negative Binomial distribution
N B(p, r) when both parameters p and r are unknown, has been considered by some
authors in the literature; see Meintanis (2005) and Best et al. (2009). Meintanis (2005)
proposed a test based on the comparison of the empirical probability generating function with that of the Negative Binomial distribution with estimated parameters. Best
et al. (2009) considered tests based on the comparison of third and fourth order moments. In the following we focus on the test proposed by Meintanis (2005) but we also
report results for the test proposed by Best et al. (2009).
The test statistic proposed by Meintanis (2005) with suggested parameter a = 5,

To obtain critical values of the Tt,n test, a parametric bootstrap procedure is used.

The distribution of the test statistic Tt,n under the null is then estimated using the
distribution of the same test statistic calculated using the bootstrap pseudo random
19

sample.
Applying the above test to the RKI data sets selected according to the described
procedure, the null hypothesis of a Negative Binomial distribution has been rejected
at the 5% level in only 8 out of the 45 different data sets considered. Notice that
qualitatively the same result is obtained, if one uses the test proposed by Best et
al. (2009). As already mentioned, this test compares the empirical third and fourth
moments with those of the Negative Binomial distribution fitted to the data; see the
test denoted by R2 /V ar(R) in page 6 of the cited paper. Applying this test leads to a
rejection of the the null hypothesis at the 5% level, in only 2 out of the 45 data sets
selected. Our testing procedures find, therefore, no evidence against the assumption
that the random behavior of the individual reproduction number is governed by a
Negative Binomial distribution.

5.2. Empirical Results
In this section we present the estimated parameter of the Negative Binomial distribution obtained for Germany based on the RKI data set by the method described
in Section 3. We consider here the time period from April 1, 2020 to December 23,
2020. Furthermore, the moment estimators in Section 3 are based on 401 districts
and a left-sided 7-day moving average smoothing is applied to the estimated moments
before computing the parameter estimators (26). As mentioned in Section 3, the parameter estimates depend on the unknown reporting rate p0,t and this rate cannot be
estimated from the data given. That is why we present results here for three possible
reporting rates, i.e., p0,t ∈ {0.2, 0.35, 0.5}. For a given reporting rate, the estimated
parameters are presented here as connected lines. However, note that the reporting
rate may vary over time and the proposed estimation procedure requires only a locally
constant reporting rate, i.e., the estimation at time t requires roughly no substantial
changes in the reporting rate for the past three weeks. This means, it is possible to
switch over time between the results of different reporting rates, if there is strong
believe that the reporting rate changes between different time periods. The estimated
parameters pt and rt are given in Figure 5 and 6, respectively. In this time period,
pt is in the range of 0.021 to 0.2 and rt in range of 0.02 to 0.25. The parameters also
can be translated into probabilities that an individual case causes a given number of
secondary infections over its entire infectious period. For this, we present in Figure 7
20

the probability that an individual causes no infections, in Figure 8 the probability
that an individual causes one to five infections, and in Figure 9 the probability that
an individual causes 20 or more infections.
Before discussing the results, first note that over the entire period nonpharmaceutical measures were in place such as mandatory wearing of face masks in
public areas, detected cases and contacts were quarantined, etc. This also can be seen
in the estimates of the parameter R0 . Over this time period, the average is 1.036,
and consequently, far less than the reproduction rate without any measures, which
is estimated as 3.32 by Alimohamadi et al. (2020) in a meta-study. Over the entire
time period a strong overdispersion can be observed irrespective of the reporting rate.
Smaller reporting rates lead in general to smaller parameter values for rt . Furthermore, in the summer period larger parameter values for rt can be observed than in the
fall period. The overdispersion can be displayed well in in probabilities. During the
summer period the probability that an individual cases causes no infection is given by
60% − 80% and it rises in the fall period to 80% − 90%. Additionally, the probability
that an individual case causes 20 or more infections almost doubles from summer to
fall and peaks in October with values about 1.5% − 2%. In contrast, the probability
that an individual case causes one to five infections almost halves from summer to fall
with values in summer of about 10% − 20%.
Endo et al. (2020) estimated the overdispersion parameter rt of the Negative Binomial distribution as 0.1 with a 95% confidence interval from 0.04 to 0.2. Note however,
that their considered time period is January and February of 2020. In that time period
non-pharmaceutical measures such as obligatory face masks in public areas were not
yet in place or less strict than in the time period considered here. Since in our considered time period non-pharmaceutical measures were less strict in Germany during
the summer 2020, it seems most reasonable to compare the results obtained in the
summer period, June 1, 2020 to October 31, 2020, with the results obtain by Endo et
al. (2020). In the summer period, rt takes values in the range of 0.025 to 0.22 and for
a reporting rate of 0.35, we obtain values in the range of 0.044 to 0.157 with a mean
value of 0.095. Hence, the obtained values coincide well with the values obtained in
Endo et al. (2020).

5.3. Simulated Interventions - Cluster Tracing
The estimated parameters can be used to simulate the effect of additional nonpharmaceutical measures such as additional cluster tracing or physical distancing. This
means that the number of daily infections is simulated using the obtained parameter estimates and additional interventions can be plugged-in. Note that non-pharmaceutical
measures already in place during the time period used for estimation are reflected in
the estimated parameters. As an example, we consider cluster tracing. Let Si,t denotes
the number of secondary infections caused by an individual case i at time t and Sei,t
the number of cases caused by this person and observed by the health authorities. The
health authorities are tracing a cluster if Sei,t > CS, where CS denotes the considered
cluster size. They are able to prevent the traced cases from causing further infections
by isolating them with some effectiveness Cef f ∈ [0, 1]. This means, if Sei,t > CS only
Si,t − Cef f Sei,t secondary cases can cause further infections.
We consider here the time period August 1, 2020 to October 31, 2020. With the
beginning of November stricter non-pharmaceutical measures have been active in Germany. Since identified cases are usually persons with symptoms of COVID-19 and a

24

positive laboratory test of SARS-CoV-2, there is possible a time delays before the
health authorities can isolate the persons of a cluster. That is why, we set the effectiveness of cluster tracing to Cef f = 0.35. For the cluster size we consider two cases:
observed clusters with size 20 or greater are traced and observed clusters with size 5
or greater are traced. These two cases are displayed in Figure 10 and 11, respectively.
We consider two possible reporting rates p0,t ∈ [0.2, 0.5]. Furthermore, the simulation
is based on 10,000 trials and the mean case is given by thick lines and the upper and
lower 5% cases by thin lines.
For the case that observed cluster with size 20 or greater are traced with effectiveness
of Cef f = 0.35, the rise in daily infections during September and October can only
be delayed by one week. For this case, the reporting rate does not affect much the
results. This changes for the case where observed clusters with size 5 or greater are
traced with effectiveness of Cef f = 0.35. In this case, the rise in daily infections during
September and October can only by delayed by two weeks for a reporting rate of 0.2
and for reporting rate of 0.5 the corresponding delay is almost one month. However,
even in the most optimistic case, i.e., a reporting rate of 50% and clusters with size
5 or greater are being traced, a strong increase in daily infections during September
and October cannot be stopped.

Lemma 1. Let X ∼ N B(p, r) with parameters p ∈ (0, 1) and r > 0. If Z1 , Z2 , . . . are
i.i.d. Bernoulli(p0 ) variables, then
Y :=

Proof:

p + p0 − p0 · p

Notice first that for X = n given, the distribution of Y |X = n is

Binomial(n, p0 ). Furthermore, if X ∼ N B(p, r) then X ∼ P oisson(λ) with λ ∼
