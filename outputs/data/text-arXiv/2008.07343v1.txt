Abstract—Artificial intelligence (AI) has been applied widely
in our daily lives in a variety of ways with numerous successful
stories. AI has also contributed to dealing with the coronavirus
disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which has been happening around
the globe. This paper presents a survey of AI methods being
used in various applications in the fight against the COVID-19
outbreak and outlines the crucial roles of AI research in this
unprecedented battle. We touch on a number of areas where AI
plays as an essential component, from medical image processing,
data analytics, text mining and natural language processing, the
Internet of Things, to computational biology and medicine. A
summary of COVID-19 related data sources that are available
for research purposes is also presented. Research directions on
exploring the potentials of AI and enhancing its capabilities and
power in the battle are thoroughly discussed. We highlight 13
groups of problems related to the COVID-19 pandemic and point
out promising AI methods and tools that can be used to solve
those problems. It is envisaged that this study will provide AI
researchers and the wider community an overview of the current
status of AI applications and motivate researchers in harnessing
AI potentials in the fight against COVID-19.

I. I NTRODUCTION
HE novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has created
tremendous chaos around the world, affecting people’s
lives and causing a large number of deaths. Since the first
cases were detected, the disease has spread to almost every country, causing deaths of over 580,000 people among
nearly 13,379,000 confirmed cases based on statistics of the
World Health Organization in the middle of July 2020 [1].
Governments of many countries have proposed intervention
policies to mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Science and technology have contributed significantly to the
implementations of these policies during this unprecedented
and chaotic time. For example, robots are used in hospitals to
deliver food and medicine to coronavirus patients or drones
are used to disinfect streets and public spaces. Many medical
researchers are rushing to investigate drugs and medicines to
treat infected patients whilst others are attempting to develop
vaccines to prevent the virus. Computer science researchers
on the other hand have managed to early detect infectious
patients using techniques that can process and understand
medical imaging data such as X-ray images and computed
tomography (CT) scans. These computational techniques are
part of artificial intelligence (AI), which has been applied
successfully in various fields. This paper focuses on the
roles of AI technologies in the battle against the COVID19 pandemic. We provide a comprehensive survey of AI

applications that support humans to reduce and suppress the
substantial impacts of the outbreak. Recent advances in AI
have contributed significantly to improving humans’ lives and
thus there is a strong belief that proper AI research plans will
fully exploit the power of AI in helping humans to defeat this
challenging battle. We discuss about these possible plans and
highlight AI research areas that could bring great benefits and
contributions to overcome the battle. In addition, we present a
summary of COVID-19 related data sources to facilitate future
studies using AI methods to deal with the pandemic.
An overview of common AI methods is presented in Fig. 1
where recent AI development is highlighted. Machine learning, especially deep learning, has made great advances and
substantial progress in long-standing fields such as computer
vision, natural language processing (NLP), speech recognition,
and video games. A significant advantage of deep learning
over traditional machine learning techniques is its ability to
deal with and make sense of different types of data, especially
big and unstructured data, e.g. text, image, video and audio
data. A number of industries, e.g. electronics, automotive, security, retail, agriculture, healthcare and medical research, have
achieved better outcomes and benefits by using deep learning
and AI methods. It is thus expected that AI technologies can
contribute to the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, such
as those surveyed in the next section.

II. AI AGAINST COVID-19: A S URVEY
We separate surveyed papers into different groups that include: deep learning algorithms for medical image processing,
data science methods for pandemic modelling, AI and the
Internet of Things (IoT), AI for text mining and NLP, and
AI in computational biology and medicine.
A. Medical Image Processing with Deep Learning
While radiologists and clinical doctors can learn to detect
COVID-19 cases based on chest CT examinations, their tasks
are manual and time consuming, especially when required to
examine a lot of cases. Bai et al. [7] convenes three Chinese
and four United States radiologists to differentiate COVID19 from other viral pneumonia based on chest CT images
obtained from a cohort of 424 cases, in which 205 cases are
from the United States with non-COVID-19 pneumonia whilst
219 cases are from China positive with COVID-19. Results
obtained show that radiologists can achieve high specificity
(which refers to the proportion of actual positives that are
correctly identified as such) in distinguishing COVID-19 from
other causes of viral pneumonia using chest CT imaging data.
However, their performance in terms of sensitivity (which

Fig. 1. An overview of common AI methods where machine learning constitutes a great proportion. The development of deep learning, a subset of machine
learning, has contributed significantly to improving the power and capabilities of recent AI applications. A number of deep learning-based convolutional neural
network (CNN) architectures, e.g. LeNet [2], AlexNet [3], GoogLeNet [4], Visual Geometry Group (VGG) Net [5] and ResNet [6], have been proposed and
applied successfully in different areas, especially in the computer vision domain. Other techniques such as autoencoders and recurrent neural networks are
crucial components of many prominent natural language processing tools. The deep learning methods in particular and AI in general may thus be employed
to create useful applications to deal with various aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

refers to the proportion of actual negatives that are correctly
identified as such) is just moderate for the same task. AI
methods, especially deep learning, have been used to process
and analyse medical imaging data to support radiologists and
doctors to improve diagnosis performance. Likewise, the current COVID-19 pandemic has witnessed a number of studies
focusing on automatic detection of COVID-19 using deep
learning systems.
A three-dimensional deep learning method, namely COVID19 detection neural network (COVNet), is introduced in [8]
to detect COVID-19 based on volumetric chest CT images.
Three kinds of CT images, including COVID-19, community
acquired pneumonia (CAP) and other non-pneumonia cases,
are mixed to test the robustness of the proposed model, which
is illustrated in Fig. 2. These images are collected from 6
hospitals in China and the detection method is evaluated by the
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).
COVNet is a convolutional ResNet-50 model [6] that takes a
series of CT slices as inputs and predicts the class labels of
the CT images via its outputs. The AUC value obtained is at
0.96, which shows a great ability of the proposed model for
detecting COVID-19 cases.
Another deep learning method based on the concatenation between the location-attention mechanism and the threedimensional CNN ResNet-18 network [6] is proposed in [9] to
detect coronavirus cases using pulmonary CT images. Distinct
manifestations of CT images of COVID-19 found in previous

Fig. 2. Illustrative architecture of the COVNet model proposed in [8] for
COVID-19 detection using CT images. Max pooling operation is used to
combine features extracted by ResNet-50 CNNs whose inputs are CT slices.
The combined features are fed into a fully connected layer to compute probabilities for three classes, i.e. non-pneumonia, community acquired pneumonia
(CAP) and COVID-19. Predicted class is the one that has highest probability
among the three classes.

studies [10], [11] and their differences with those of other
types of viral pneumonia such as influenza-A are exploited
through the proposed deep learning system. A dataset comprising CT images of COVID-19 cases, influenza-A viral
pneumonia patients and healthy cases is used to validate the
performance of the proposed method. The method’s overall
accuracy of approximately 86% is obtained on this dataset,

In line with the studies described above, we have found a
number of papers also applying deep learning for COVID19 diagnosis using radiology images. They are summarized in
Table I for comparisons.
B. AI-based Data Science Methods for COVID-19 Modelling
A modified stacked autoencoder deep learning model is used
in [26] to forecast in real-time the COVID-19 confirmed cases
across China. This modified autoencoder network includes
four layers, i.e. input, first latent layer, second latent layer
and output layer, with the number of nodes correspondingly
is 8, 32, 4 and 1. A series of 8 data points (8 days) are used as
inputs of the network. The latent variables obtained from the
second latent layer of the autoencoder model are processed
by the singular value decomposition method before being fed
into clustering algorithms in order to group the cases into
provinces or cities to investigate the transmission dynamics of
the pandemic. The resultant errors of the model are low, which
give confidence that it can be applied to forecast accurately
the transmission dynamics of the virus as a helpful tool for
public health planning and policy-making.
On the other hand, a prototype of an AI-based system,
namely α-Satellite, is proposed in [27] to assess the infectious
risk of a given geographical area at community levels. The
system collects various types of large-scale and real-time data
from heterogeneous sources, such as number of cases and
deaths, demographic data, traffic density and social media

Accuracy of 98% on X-ray images
and 94.1% on CT images

data, e.g., Reddit posts. The social media data available for
a given area may be limited so that they are enriched by the
conditional generative adversarial networks (GANs) [28] to
learn the public awareness of COVID-19. A heterogeneous
graph autoencoder model is then devised to aggregate information from neighbourhood areas of the given area in order
to estimate its risk indexes. This risk information enables
residents to select appropriate actions to prevent them from
the virus infection with minimum disruptions in their daily
lives. It is also useful for authorities to implement appropriate
mitigation strategies to combat the fast evolving pandemic.
Chang et al. [29] modify a discrete-time and stochastic
agent-based model, namely ACEMod (Australian Censusbased Epidemic Model), previously used for influenza pandemic simulation [30], [31], for modelling the COVID-19
pandemic across Australia over time. Each agent exemplifies
an individual characterized by a number of attributes such
as age, occupation, gender, susceptibility and immunity to
diseases and contact rates. The ACEMod is calibrated to model
specifics of the COVID-19 pandemic based on key disease
transmission parameters. Several intervention strategies including social distancing, school closures, travel bans, and case
isolation are then evaluated using this tuned model. Results
obtained from the experiments show that a combination of
several strategies is needed to mitigate and suppress the
COVID-19 pandemic. The best approach suggested by the
model is to combine international arrival restrictions, case
isolation and social distancing in at least 13 weeks with the
compliance level of 80% or above.

C. AI and the Internet of Things
A framework for COVID-19 detection using data obtained
from smartphones’ onboard sensors such as cameras, microphones, temperature and inertial sensors is proposed in [32].
Machine learning methods are employed for learning and
acquiring knowledge about the disease symptoms based on
the collected data. This offers a low-cost and quick approach
to coronavirus detection compared to medical Kits or CT scan
methods. This is arguably plausible because data obtained
from the smartphones’ sensors have been utilized effectively
in different individual applications and the proposed approach
integrates these applications together in a unique framework.
For instance, data obtained from the temperature-fingerprint
sensor can be used for fever level prediction [33]. Images and
videos taken by smartphones’ camera or data collected by the
onboard inertial sensors can be used for human fatigue detection [34], [35]. Likewise, Story et al. [36] use smartphone’s
videos for nausea prediction whilst Lawanont et al. [37] use
camera images and inertial sensors’ measurements for neck
posture monitoring and human headache level prediction. Alternatively, audio data obtained from smartphone’s microphone
are used for cough type detection in [38], [39].
An approach to collecting individuals’ basic travel history
and their common manifestations using a phone-based online
survey is proposed in [40]. These data are valuable for machine
learning algorithms to learn and predict the infection risk of
each individual, thus help to early identify high-risk cases for
quarantine purpose. This contributes to reducing the spread
of the virus to the susceptible populations. In another work,
Allam and Jones [41] suggest the use of AI and data sharing
standardization protocols for better global understanding and
management of urban health during the COVID-19 pandemic.
For example, added benefits can be obtained if AI is integrated
with thermal cameras, which might have been installed in
many smart cities, for early detection of the outbreak. AI methods can also demonstrate their great effectiveness in supporting
managers to make better decisions for virus containment when
loads of urban health data are collected by data sharing across
and between smart cities using the proposed protocols.
D. AI for Text Mining and NLP
A hybrid AI model for COVID-19 infection rate forecasting
is proposed in [42], which combines the epidemic susceptible
infected (SI) model, NLP and deep learning tools. The SI
model and its extension, i.e. susceptible infected recovered
(SIR), are traditional epidemic models for modelling and
predicting the development of infectious diseases where S
represents the number of susceptible people, I denotes the
number of infected people and R specifies the recovered cases.
Using differential equations to characterize the relationship
between I, S and R, these models have been used to predict
successfully SARS and Ebola infected cases, as reported
in [43] and [44] respectively. NLP is employed to extract
semantic features from related news such as epidemic control
measures of governments or residents’ disease prevention
awareness. These features are then served as inputs to the
long short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning model [45] to

revise the infection rate predictions of the SI model (detailed
in Fig. 3). Epidemic data of Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai and the
whole China are used for experiments, which demonstrate the
great accuracy of the proposed hybrid model. It can be applied
to predict the COVID-19 transmission law and development
trend, and thus useful for establishing prevention and control
measures for future pandemics. That study also shows the
importance of public awareness of governmental epidemic
prevention policies and the significant role of transparency
and openness of epidemic reports and news in containing the
development of infectious diseases.

Fig. 3. An AI-based approach to COVID-19 prediction that combines
traditional epidemic SI model, NLP and machine learning tools as introduced
in [42]. A pre-trained NLP model is used to extract NLP features from text
data, i.e. the pandemic news, reports, prevention and control measures. These
features are integrated with infection rate features obtained from the SI model
via multilayer perceptron (MLP) networks before being fed into LSTM model
for COVID-19 case modelling and prediction.

In another work, Lopez et al. [46] recommend the use of
network analysis techniques as well as NLP and text mining
to analyse a multilanguage Twitter dataset to understand
changing policies and common responses to the COVID19 outbreak across time and countries. Since the beginning
of the pandemic, governments of many countries have tried
to implement policies to mitigate the spread of the virus.
Responses of people to the pandemic and to the governmental
policies may be collected from social media platforms such
as Twitter. Much of information and misinformation is posted
through these platforms. When stricter policies such as social
distancing and country lockdowns are applied, people’s lives
are changed considerably and part of that can be observed and
captured via people’s reflections on social media platforms
as well. Analysis results of these data can be helpful for
governmental decision makers to mitigate the impacts of the
current pandemic and prepare better policies for possible
future pandemics.
Likewise, three machine learning methods including support
vector machine (SVM), naive Bayes and random forest are
used in [47] to classify 3,000 COVID-19 related posts collected from Sina Weibo, which is the Chinese equivalent of
Twitter, into seven types of situational information. Identifying
situational information is important for authorities because it
helps them to predict its propagation scale, sense the mood of
the public and understand the situation during the crisis. This
contributes to creating proper response strategies throughout

5

the COVID-19 pandemic.
E. AI in Computational Biology and Medicine
Being able to predict structures of a protein will help
understand its functions. Google DeepMind is using the latest
version of their protein structure prediction system, namely
AlphaFold [48], to predict structures of several proteins associated with COVID-19 based on their corresponding amino
acid sequences. They have released the predicted structures
in [49], but these structures still need to be experimentally
verified. Nevertheless, it is expected that these predictions will
help understand how the coronavirus functions and potentially
lead to future development of therapeutics against COVID-19.
An AI-based generative chemistry approach to design novel
molecules that can inhibit COVID-19 is proposed in [50].
Several generative machine learning models, e.g. generative
autoencoders, GANs, genetic algorithms and language models,
are used to exploit molecular representations to generate
structures, which are then optimized using reinforcement
learning methods. This is an ongoing work as the authors are
synthesising and testing the obtained molecules. However, it
is a promising approach because these AI methods can exploit
the large drug-like chemical space and automatically extract
useful information from high-dimensional data. It is thus able
to construct molecules without manually designing features
and learning the relationships between molecular structures
and their pharmacological properties. The proposed approach
is cost-effective and time-efficient and has a great potential to
generate novel drug compounds in the COVID-19 fight.
On the other hand, Randhawa et al. [51] aim to predict the
taxonomy of COVID-19 based on an alignment-free machine
learning method [52] using genomic signatures and a decision
tree approach. The alignment-free method is a computationally
inexpensive approach that can give rapid taxonomic classification of novel pathogens by processing only raw DNA
sequence data. By analysing over 5000 unique viral sequences,
the authors are able to confirm the taxonomy of COVID19 as belonging to the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus
Betacoronavirus, as previously found in [53]. The proposed
method also provides quantitative evidence that supports a
hypothesis about a bat origin for COVID-19 as indicated
in [53], [54]. Recently, Nguyen et al. [55] propose the use
of AI-based clustering methods and more than 300 genome
sequences to search for the origin of the COVID-19 virus.
Numerous clustering experiments are performed on datasets
that combine sequences of the COVID-19 virus and those
of reference viruses of various types. Results obtained show
that COVID-19 virus genomes consistently form a cluster
with those of bat and pangolin coronaviruses. That provides
quantitative evidences to support the hypotheses that bats and
pangolins may have served as the hosts for the COVID19 virus. Their findings also suggest that bats are the more
probable origin of the virus than pangolins. AI methods thus
have demonstrated their capabilities and power for mining big
biological datasets in an efficient and intelligent manner, which
contributes to the progress of finding vaccines, therapeutics or
medicines for COVID-19.

III. COVID-19 DATA S OURCES AND P OTENTIAL
M ODELLING A PPROACHES
This section summarises available data sources relevant to
COVID-19, ranging from numerical data of infection cases,
radiology images [56], Twitter, text, natural language to biological sequence data (Table II), and highlights potential
AI methods for modelling different types of data. The data
are helpful for research purposes to exploit the capabilities
and power of AI technologies in the battle against COVID19. Different data types have different characteristics and
thus require different AI methods to handle. For example,
numerical time series data of infection cases can be dealt with
by traditional machine learning methods such as naive Bayes,
logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), SVM, MLP,
fuzzy logic system [57], nonparametric Gaussian process [58],
decision tree, random forest, and ensemble learning algorithms
[59]. Deep learning recurrent neural networks such as LSTM
[45] can be used for regression prediction problems if a
large amount of training data are available. The deeper the
models, the more data are needed to enable the models to learn
effectively from data. Based on their ability to characterize
temporal dynamic behaviours, recurrent networks are well
suited for modelling infection case time series data.
Radiology images such as chest X-ray and CT scans are
high-dimensional data that require processing capabilities of
deep learning methods in which CNN-based models are
common and most suitable (e.g. LeNet [2], AlexNet [3],
GoogLeNet [4], VGG Net [5] and ResNet [6]). CNNs were
inspired by biological processes of visual cortex of human
and animal brains where each cortical neuron is activated
within its receptive field when stimulated. A receptive field
of a neuron covers a specific subarea of the visual field and
thus the entire visual field can be captured by a partial overlap
of receptive fields. A CNN consists of multiple layers where
each neuron of a subsequent (higher) layer connects to a
subset of neurons in the previous (lower) layer. This allows
the receptive field of a neuron of a higher layer covers a
larger portion of images compared to that of a lower layer.
The higher layer is able to learn more abstract features of
images than the lower layer by taking into account the spatial
relationships between different receptive fields. This use of
receptive fields enables CNNs to recognize visual patterns
and capture features from images without prior knowledge
or making hand-crafted features as in traditional machine
learning approaches. This principle is applied to different CNN
architectures although they may differ in the number of layers,
number of neurons in each layer, the use of activation and
loss functions as well as regularization and learning algorithms
[60]. Transfer learning methods can be used to customize CNN
models, which have been pretrained on large medical image
datasets, for the COVID-19 diagnosis problem. This would
avoid training a CNN from scratch and thus reduce training
time and the need for COVID-19 radiology images, which may
not be sufficiently available in the early stage of the pandemic.
Alternatively, unstructured natural language data need text
mining tools, e.g. Natural Language ToolKit (NLTK) [61],
and advanced NLP and natural language generation (NLG)

speech recognition, and question and answering. These tools
may include Embeddings from Language Models (ELMo)

Transformer [64], Googles Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) [65], Transformer-XL [66],

The core components of these tools are deep learning and
transfer learning methods. For example, ELMo and ULMFiT are built using LSTM-based language models while
Transformer utilizes an encoder-decoder structure. Likewise,
BERT and ERNIE use multi-layer Transformer as a basic
encoder while XLNet is a generalized autoregressive pretraining method inherited from Transformer-XL. Transformer also

serves as a basic model for T5, BPT and GPT-2. These are
excellent tools for many NLP and NLG tasks to handle text
and natural language data related to COVID-19.
Analysing biological sequence data such as viral genomic
and proteomic sequences requires either traditional machine
learning or advanced deep learning or a combination of both
depending on problems being addressed and data pipelines
used. As an example, traditional clustering methods, e.g.
hierarchical clustering and density-based spatial clustering of
applications with noise (DBSCAN) [72], can be employed
to find the virus origin using genomic sequences [55]. Alternatively, a fuzzy logic system can be used to predict
protein secondary structures based on quantitative properties
of amino acids, which are used to encode the twenty common
amino acids [73]. A combination between principal component
analysis and lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection
operator) can be used as a supervised approach for analysing
single-nucleotide polymorphism genetic variation data [74].

7

Advances in deep learning may be utilized for protein structure
prediction using protein amino acid sequences as in [48], [75].
An overview on the use of various types of machine learning
and deep learning methods for analysing genetic and genomic
data can be referred to [76], [77]. Typical applications may
include, for example, recognizing the locations of transcription
start sites, identifying splice sites, promoters, enhancers, or
positioned nucleosomes in a genome sequence, analysing
gene expression data for finding disease biomarkers, assigning
functional annotations to genes, predicting the expression of a
gene [76], identifying splicing junction at the DNA level, predicting the sequence specificities of DNA- and RNA-binding
proteins, modelling structural features of RNA-binding protein
targets, predicting DNA-protein binding, or annotating the
pathogenicity of genetic variants [77]. These applications can
be utilized for analysing genomic and genetic data of severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the
highly pathogenic virus that has caused the global COVID-19
pandemic.
IV. C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE R ESEARCH D IRECTIONS
The COVID-19 pandemic has considerably affected lives of
people around the globe and the number of deaths related to
the disease keeps increasing worldwide. While AI technologies
have penetrated into our daily lives with many successes, they
have also contributed to helping humans in the tough fight
against COVID-19. This paper has presented a survey of AI
applications so far in the literature relevant to the COVID19 crisis’s responses and control strategies. These applications
range from medical diagnosis based on chest radiology images,
virus transmission modelling and forecasting based on number
of cases time series and IoT data, text mining and NLP to
capture the public awareness of virus prevention measures, to
biological data analysis for drug discovery. Although various
studies have been published, we observe that there are still
relatively limited applications and contributions of AI in this
battle. This is partly due to the limited availability of data
about COVID-19 whilst AI methods normally require large
amounts of data for computational models to learn and acquire
knowledge. However, we expect that the number of AI studies
related to COVID-19 will increase significantly in the months
to come when more COVID-19 data such as medical images and biological sequences are available. Current available
datasets as summarized in Table II are stored in various
formats and standards that would hinder the development of
COVID-19 related AI research. A future work on creating,
hosting and benchmarking COVID-19 related datasets is essential because it will help to accelerate discoveries useful
for tackling the disease. Repositories for this goal should be
created following standardized protocols and allow researchers
and scientists across the world to contribute to and utilize them
freely for research purposes.
Among the published works, the use of deep learning
techniques for COVID-19 diagnosis based on radiology imaging data appears to be dominant. As summarized in Table
1, numerous studies have used various deep learning methods, applying on different datasets and utilizing a number

of evaluation criteria. This creates an immediate concern
about difficulties when utilizing these approaches to the realworld clinical practice. Accordingly, there is a demand for
a future work on developing a benchmark framework to
validate and compare the existing methods. This framework
should facilitate the same computing hardware infrastructure,
(universal) datasets covering same patient cohorts, same data
pre-processing procedures and evaluation criteria across AI
methods being evaluated.
Furthermore, as Li et al. [8] pointed out, although their
model obtained great accuracy in distinguishing COVID-19
with other types of viral pneumonia using radiology images,
it still lacks of transparency and interpretability. For example,
they do not know which imaging features have unique effects
on the output computation. The benefit that black box deep
learning methods can provide to clinical doctors is therefore
questionable. A future study on explainable AI to explain
the deep learning models’ performance as well as features of
images that contribute to the distinction between COVID-19
and other types of pneumonia is necessary. This would help
radiologists and clinical doctors to gain insights about the virus
and examine future coronavirus CT and X-ray images more
effectively.
In the field of computational biology and medicine, AI
has been used to partially understand COVID-19 or discover
novel drug compounds against the virus [49], [50]. These
are just initial results and thus there is a great demand for
AI research in this field, e.g., to investigate genetics and
chemistry of the virus and suggest ways to quickly produce
vaccines and treatment drugs. With a strong computational
power that is able to deal with large amounts of data, AI
can help scientists to gain knowledge about the coronavirus
quickly. For example, by exploring and analyzing protein
structures of virus, medical researchers would be able to find
components necessary for a vaccine or drug more effectively.
This process would be very time consuming and expensive
with conventional methods [85]. Recent astonishing success of
deep learning in identifying powerful new kinds of antibiotic
from a pool of more than 100 million molecules as published
in [86] gives a strong hope to this line of research in the battle
against COVID-9.
Compared to the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic [87], we are
now fortunately living in the age of exponential technology.
When everybody, organization and government try their best
in the battle against the pandemic, the power of AI should be
fully exploited and employed to support humans to combat this
battle. AI can be utilized for the preparedness and response
activities against the unprecedented national and global crisis. For example, AI can be used to create more effective
robots and autonomous machines for disinfection, working
in hospitals, delivering food and medicine to patients. AIbased NLP tools can be used to create systems that help
understand the public responses to intervention strategies, e.g.
lockdown and physical distancing, to detect problems such as
mental health and social anxiety, and to aid governments in
making better public policies. NLP technologies can also be
employed to develop chatbot systems that are able to remotely
communicate and provide consultations to people and patients

8

about the coronavirus. AI can be used to eradicate fake news
on social media platforms to ensure clear, responsible and
reliable information about the pandemic such as scientific
evidences relevant to the virus, governmental social distancing
policies or other pandemic prevention and control measures.
In Table III, we point out 13 groups of problems related to
COVID-19 along with types of data needed and potential AI
methods that can be used to solve those problems. We do not
aim to cover all possible AI applications but emphasize on
realistic applications that can be achieved along with their
technical challenges. Those challenges need to be addressed
effectively for AI methods to bring satisfactory results.

It is great to observe the increasing number of AI applications against the COVID-19 pandemic. AI methods however
are not silver bullets but they have limitations and challenges
such as inadequate training and validation data or when data
are abundantly available, they are normally in poor quality.
Huge efforts are needed for an AI system to be effective
and useful. They may include appropriate data processing
pipelines, model selection, efficient algorithm development,
remodelling and retraining, continuous performance monitoring and validation to facilitate continuous deployment and
so on. There are AI ethics principles and guidelines [88],
[89] that each phase of the AI system lifecycle, i.e. design,
