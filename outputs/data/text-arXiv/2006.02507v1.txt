A BSTRACT
The present article studies the extension of two deterministic models for describing the novel
coronavirus pandemic crisis, the SIR model and the SEIR model. The models were studied and
compared to real data in order to support the validity of each description and extract important
information regarding the pandemic, such as the basic reproductive number R0 , which might provide
useful information concerning the rate of increase of the pandemic predicted by each model. We
next proceed to making predictions and comparing more complex models derived from the SEIR
model with the SIRD model, in order to find the most suitable one for describing and predicting the
pandemic crisis. Aiming to answer the question if the simple SIRD model is able to make reliable
predictions and deliver suitable information compared to more complex models.

Introduction

Back on 2015, a group of researches described the potential for a SARS coronavirus circulating inside bats to mutate to
humans [1]. Early on 2020 the world suffers from an new pandemic crisis caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV2, belonging to the Betacoronavirus genus and with probable origin on bats [2]. The first cases of the novel virus date
back to December 2019 at the Food Market of Wuhan, China [3], where bats are sold among other exotic animals, since
then the virus has been spreading throughout China, later Asia, Europe, Africa and America, causing a global scale
economic crisis and being notified by the World Health Organization as an pademic on March 11th.
COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by the Sars-Cov-2 virus, currently in human-to-human sustained transmission
[4]. We know that the contamination mainly occurs by a close interaction with infected individuals, as the viral charge
is carried by respiratory droplets that can remain in suspension in air or deposited on surfaces of common contact. As a
novel strain of the Coronaviridae family, it is not expected that any individual has antibodies against it, which causes
the entire population to be susceptible to infection. As an individual is exposed to the virus, the incubation period
begins, with no symptoms and a small chance of contaminating others. When the virus is onset, the infected individual
show symptoms in a varied range of intensities and may develop severe acute respiratory syndrome. COVID-19 has a
general mortality rate bellow 5% [5], with an average of 2.3%. The behavior of the disease is age dependent, with the
higher risk group being older populations, that present a mortality rate of 8% for individuals between 70-79 years and
14.8% for people older than 80 years [6]. However, even with a low mortality rate, the number of hospitalizations is
quite high, with 5% of the cases being critical and 14% being severe [7], presenting an challenge to health care systems
of some countries.

Mathematical models predicted the potential for an international outbreak early on [8] and described how Wuhan
became the center of an epidemic crisis on China. The outbreak quickly spread throughout mainland China and other
countries. Although the pandemic crisis began on Wuhan, today the United States of America is the epicenter of the
pandemic crisis on the world.
Many models are widely used from scenario prediction [9, 10, 11, 12] to data analysis [13]. Among all those models,
the most used ones are the SIR and SEIR models [14], including their modifications to include hospitalizations,
asymptomatic cases and other compartments [15]. We develop here a comparative study between modified SIR and
SEIR models; in order to provide support for the accuracy of both models, we compare the differences on the fitting
process between the simple SIRD and simple SEIRD models and the accuracy of prediction generated by the simple
SIRD and the SEIRD model with age division, using data from Germany and the Republic of Korea. The choice was
based on the accuracy of the data for representing the true scale and dynamics of the pandemic, other countries who
presented a much lower testing rate such as Brazil [16] are not reliable sources for testing models describing the disease.
There are also countries such as Taiwan and Iceland, which kept track of the disease; however the number of cases in
those countries were much lower, escaping the deterministic nature of the models described here.

Theory

Mathematical models for disease epidemic are either deterministic or stochastic [17], where the first may be considered
some sort of thermodynamic limit of the second. An analogy made with thermodynamics, where given a big enough
number of particles in a gas, for example, you find deterministic equations to describe the behavior of the gas given
by the laws of thermodynamics without the need to know the exact behavior of each particle. Otherwise, when your
number of molecules is low or you try to compute too many interactions between particles of your system, the random
behavior and fluctuations start taking place and you get to a stochastic model.
We describe here a simple extensions of models constantly used on literature [18, 19, 10] and with it show some possible
behaviors of a disease outbreak.

2.1

SIRD

A simple mathematical model for disease epidemic can been built dividing the population in 3 groups: susceptible
individuals (S), infected individuals (I) and recovered individuals (R). The model composed by these groups is called the
SIR model. In this article, however, we consider also individuals who have died by the disease, denote by D. Following
the same arguments of the SIR model, the SIRD model can be described by the set of four differential equations:
dS
β
= − I(t)S(t)
dt
N
β
dI
= I(t)S(t) − (γ + µ)I(t)
dt
N
dR
= γI(t)
dt
dD
= µI(t)
dt

(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)

Last equation is easily understood by thinking that the variation of the number of deaths may be proportional to the
infected individuals, where the proportionality constant is denoted by µ. The constants γ and β are, respectively, the
recovery rate and the number of infected, where µ and γ are given in terms of the infection fatality rate (IFR) or the
case fatality rate (CFR); that is, the number of people who contracted the disease and died according to the total number
of infections (IFR) or the registered number of infections (CFR), and the average time taken from symptoms onset to
recovery, τr , or death τd , formally µ = PCF R /τd and γ = (1 − PCF R )/τr . The equations are simply a mathematical
way to describe how individuals passes from one group to the other according to the following chain of events: A
susceptible individual becomes infected by the virus, and from this point, it either dies or recovers (Figure 1).

Figure 1: Representation of a SIRD model, a susceptible person gets infected and either dies or recovers from the

Summing the four equations we get
S(t) + I(t) + R(t) + D(t) = const,

(5)

where the constant may represent the total number of individuals, N . Before proceeding, we propose the initial
condition that, when t goes to zero, I(t) = I0 , R(t) = D(t) = 0, and, therefore, S(t) = S0 = N − I0 ≈ N . Such an
assumption is based on the fact that the entire population is susceptible to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Since R(t) and D(t) are both data updated day by day in Germany and Korea, it would be helpful to write I(t) as
function of them so as to predict its behavior, obtaining, for example, the maximum number of infected individuals. For
reasons that may be clear soon, we first write I(t) in terms of S(t). An intuitive step is to divide equation (2) by (1).
Thus,
1
dI/dt
= −1 + k ,
dS/dt
S

(6)

where k = (γ + µ)/β. Eliminating the temporal dependence, we get a separable differential equation, that is,
dI = −dS + k

dS
,
S

(7)

which the solution is easily verified to be
I(t) = −S(t) + k ln S(t) + const.

(8)

I0 = −(N − I0 ) + k ln(N − I0 ) + const
→ const = N − k ln(N − I0 ).

(9)

Applying the initial condition, we obtain

Hence, equation (8) may be written as
I(t) = N − S(t) + k ln

S(t)
.
N − I0

(10)

We can visualize here, that depending on the combination of γ and µ, I reaches 0 before the entire population S
becomes infected (Figure 2).

Figure 2: Plot of equation (10) with different conbinations of γ and µ.
Next, we may write S(t) in terms of R(t) and D(t). For this purpose, we begin by dividing equation (1) by (3) and (1)

Since (13) is a separable equation, the well-known solution is given by
f (R) = AeaR and

.

(14)
(15)

Therefore, S(t) can be written as
S(t) = CeaR(t) + bD(t) ,

(16)

where we absorbed both constants A and B into C. By the initial condition, we find that C = N − I0 . To find a and b,
we must derive (16) in time under the condition that it may return to equation (1). In this way, we see that
aγ + bµ = −β.
By the other hand, substituting equations (14) and (15) in (13), we get

With this equation, see that as t → ∞, I does not approaches N necessarily, depending on the recovery and death rates,

R0 =

(22)

This quantity, is of vital importance of the study of a disease outbreak.
2.2

SEIRD

Another deterministic mathematical model possible is the SEIRD model, in which we consider the population N of a
given region as divided in 5 groups. At time t, there are those who are susceptible to get infected S(t), the ones who
have already been exposed the virus but does not present symptoms yet E(t), people who are already infected and
present the symptoms I(t), the ones that have already recovered from the disease R(t) and those who are dead due to
the infection D(t). This model is a good approximation to a short epidemic, so the population of a region is roughly
constant throughout the epidemic period. Also, since this is a deterministic model, we assume N to be a big number
compared to the number of people associated with the infection of a single person. The final consideration is that we
also assume that people that are recovered from the disease acquire immensity and does not become susceptible to
become infected again.
The rate of infection λ is proportional to the number of people infected, λ(t) = βI(t), where the constant β represents
the effectiveness of the infection, the rate of cure γ = P:) τr−1 , where P:) is the probability of recovery and τr
is the average time taken for an infected person to recover. Similarly the rate of death is µ = PCF R τd−1 , where
PCF R = 1 − P:) is the probability of death, given by the CFR and τd is the average time taken for an infected person to
die. Figure 3 carries an visual representation of the SEIRD model.

We first turn our attention to the construction of an appropriate formula for calculating R0 with this model. For that we
follow the method derived on [20]. The study develops a mathematical generalization for writing R0 depending on the
type of epidemiological model. R0 is defined as
R0 = ρ(F V −1 )

(28)

where ρ(X) means the spectral radius of the matrix X, that is, the largest absolute eigenvalue. Both F and V are
the matrices of the derivatives of the functions defining the behavior of the disease population, with respect to each
population compartment.
To get to these matrices, we first note that the set of equations regarding the dynamics of the SEIRD model can be
expressed as follow: Consider ~x the vector of populations, that is ~x = (x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 ) where x1 = E, x2 = I,
x3 = S, x4 = R and x5 = D. Analogously, d~x/dt is the vector of the first derivatives. Then, we can write the
dynamics of the populations as
d~x
=F −V
dt

(29)

where F is the vector that relates the appearance of new infections on the disease populations due to contamination,
and V is the input and output of members in all populations due to all other causes, such as recovery from the disease,
development of symptoms after an incubation period, etc. In our case, since all newly infected members go to the E
population

(31)

Now, we know that the situation of a disease free equilibrium (DFE), meaning no disease is happening, is achived by
the vector ~x0 = (0, 0, S0 , 0, 0), where S0 = N . According now to [20] we can calculate F and V as

being xj the vector components of ~x related to the populations with the disease, in our case E and I, and m is the
number of populations related to infectious beings. Here m = 2. Performing the derivatives, we conclude

The next step is to find the inverse matrix of V , fortunately V is a 2x2 matrix and the formula for it’s inverse is
straightforward

therefore, by computing the eingenvalues of F V −1 we find

R0 =

Pexp β [γ + (1 − Pexp )β] + (1 − Pexp )βc
c(γ + µ)

(39)

Having R0 in our hands, we continue to the study of some behaviors of this model.
The set of equations describing the model is subjected to the initial conditions. When t → 0, I(t)− → I0 , S(t) → S =
N − I0 , R(t) → 0, D(t) → 0 and E(t) → E0 , where I0 is the initial number of infected, E0 is the initial number of
exposed in the population and no deaths or recoveries are assumed at t = 0.
2.3

Non-pharmaceutical intervention

Without vaccines or efficient medicine against the disease, non-pharmaceutical interventions are the only effective
way to prevent further increase of the pandemic [13]. These interventions take different approaches such as social
distancing, social isolation and lockdown of the population. Despite the differences, they all carry the same objective,
decreasing the infection rate β. It is convenient to implement the effect of these interventions on the model, when
making predictions. Here, we model this effect by a logistic function, where β starts at a initial value βi and at some
critical time tc a intervention is imposed and beta decreases to βf = Pdec βi , where Pdec is the fraction of βi decreased
by the intervention. In France, studies estimate that the intervention decreased βi by 77% [21], therefore Pdec = 0.77
in France.

β(t) =

(1 − Pdec )βi

where τ is a constant related to the time taken for the intervention to have the effect desired. Such model reconstruct the
general behavior of interventions against the spread of the disease (Figure 4)

Age division

Since the case fatality rate (CFR) of COVID-19 is different among age groups [6, 7, 22], we propose here a modification
on both models, including the age distribution of the population and the social aspects of close contact between members
of the population. The modification is describe as follow: Each compartment is divided into M age groups, where
each i-th group has a PCF Ri associated to it, that is, the probability of death associated to the i-th age group. The β
parameter is now described as the average number of daily contacts between a member belonging to the i-th age group
to the j-th age group, multiplied by the infection probability Pinf c

βiI =

where Cij is called the social contact matrix and we included Ij and Ej inside β now to place everything on the same
sum. The age distribution among the population is retrieved from the UN prospects [23] and the social contact matrix for
those countries was measured on previous studies [24, 25]. The specific contact matrix for the Republic of Korea was
not found, however, [26] finds evidences of cultural clusters in the world, where countries belonging to the same cluster
share cultural similarities; thus, we use this fact to justify the use of Hong Kong’s social contact matrix to describe the
Republic of Korea. That way, we include cultural and population aspects for each of those countries, increasing the
odds of a successful prediction. This type of model was used recently to describe the coronavirus outbreak on large
cities in Brazil [27].

Comparing Adjustments

To test the SIRD and SEIRD model we first compare them to the pandemic crisis on the Republic of Korea, running a
numerical solution for the differential equations (23) - (27) we adjust the general behavior of the populations to Korean
data acquired from [28] since 15/02/2020. The data from the Republic of Korea consists of the infection curve and
death curve. To prevent problems with initial guess on the fitting process, both models used the same values for the
initial guess, except E0 , which is found only on the SEIRD model. S0 = N was also left as a free parameter of the
adjustment instead of set to the total population of the country, which is justified by a limitation in both models, where
the population is assumed homogeneously spread, which does not correspond to reality. Thus, N does not represent the
8

total population, instead it represents an effective population smaller than the total population, due to non-homogeneous
distribution throughout the territory, the interpretation of N as the disease evolves is discussed on the discussion session.
The parameter was chosen to be k = 0.44β, we considered a study which estimated that presyntomatic cases caused
44% of infections [29], while for c we used an average of several clinical studies shown on table 1.

The recovery time on both models is close to 8 days, while other studies such as [34] found 10 days. The time from
symptoms onset to death was in both models close to 30 days, being 1 day shorter with the SEIRD model, [35] and [36]
found τd = 18 or 11 days.
Comparing the accuracy of the fitting with the data, both models resulted the same value of χ2 . The parameter E0
presents a large margin of error, which is expected given the lack of real data concerning the exposed population.
Proceeding to the calculation of R0 for both models, using equations (39) and (22) we found
9

R0SEIRD = 1.92 ± 0.07
R0SIRD = 2.98 ± 0.09

(43)
(44)

The value for R0 according to other studies ranges from 2 to 3 [37, 38, 39, 40], therefore, both models yield acceptable
values for R0 being the one predicted by the SEIRD model lower.

Prediction Accuracy with Age Division

We now proceed to test the prediction accuracy of both models. We used the first third of the data for fitting both
models and extracting parameters, after having the parameters, we compare the prediction for the next days with these
parameters with the rest of the dataset.
4.1

Germany

For Germany, the fitting data corresponds to the cases and deaths until 17th March. However, until the peak is reached,
both models find presents very large margin of error for N , to avoid this problem, we varied N manually, from 0 to 10%
of the local population; which was taken from a united nation prospect for the year of 2020 [23], at steps of 0.05%. At
each step, we fit the initial data and reject the fitting if the χ2 value is lower than 0.995, this χ2 method for validating the
goodness of a data adjustment had already been used for epidemiological models [41]. We than plotted the maximum
and minimum acceptable fits to generate the margin of prediction, comparing it with the complete dataset. We also
decided to use τr and τd according to clinical studies when performing the prediction, instead of leave them as free
parameters for the fitting, I0 was also determined a priori according to the first registered number on 15/02/2020. The
resulting free parameters for fitting the training set are Pinf c and E0 .
With the SEIRD model, we found the maximum and minimum values of N to be Nmin = 0.25% of the German
population and Nmax = 0.40% of the German population. The Pinf c parameter varied from 15.5% to 16.2%
Using the SIRD, leaving β and I0 as free parameters. The limit values of N were Nmin = 0.15% and Nmax = 0.2%,
while β varied from 0.247 to 0.279 and I0 from 11 to 30. Figures 7 and 8 show the result of both simulations, with the
maximum Nmax and minimum Nmin curves. The shaded region is the region between Nmax and Nmin .

The training set consisted of 20 days, corresponding to the infections from 15/02 to 06/03. The SEIRD model found

23 to 65. Figures 9 and 10 present the result for prediction of both models.

Discussion

When concerning the adjustment process for acquisition of parameters with both models, there were no difference on
the accuracy of the fit, and both models yielded very close values for the parameters. However, τd is super estimated in
both models, being slightly lower on the SEIRD model. The value of τr is acceptable inside the variation of clinical
measures.
The SEIRD model yields a slower growth rate than the SIRD model, that might happen due to the incubation period
on the SEIRD model, which slows down the propagation of the virus towards other individuals. The main difference
between the growth rate predicted by both models is better visualized by figure 11, the action of the incubation period
slows down the rate of infection, as seen by the adjustments, but also decreases the peak of infections. However, the
cumulative numbers of infection, deaths and recoveries are the same.

Figure 11: Comparison between SIRD and SEIRD models. The parameters chosen were the same for both models,
except for c = 1/5.1 on the SEIRD. β = 0.45, γ = 0.054, µ = 0.0014, k = 0.44β and N = 6000000
N could be understood as the population susceptible to the first pandemic wave, due to the non-homogeneous distribution
of the population, not everyone is susceptible to the disease right at the start. With such an interpretation, N tends to
11

increase with time and approach the total population, here. Comparing predictions generated by the SIRD model with
the SEIRD model with age division, the SEIRD model becomes a little more precise, although both simulations fail to
predict the slower decrease of Korean data, that might be explained by an increase on N as time passes, resulting in new
cases registered and therefore, slowing down the rate of decrease. Such hypothesis is well acceptable since the Republic
of Korea did not adopt any lockdown or social isolation measure, making the disease able to propagate towards other
regions, increasing N with time. Even with better prediction, the SEIRD model is far more complicated than the SIRD
model and the use of the later should probably not compromise any data analysis. The same must hold true for simple
SIR and SEIR models, when deaths are not a population to be accounted for, instead are just represented with a rate of
removal for individuals.
The social isolation model developed here shows good results on the predictions, indicating that the description of β
should be close to reality. Here we find a huge advantage of the SEIRD model with age division in comparison with the
SIRD model; by including age division, it is possible to simulate the effect of specific non-pharmaceutical interventions,
such as school closure, which in principle would decrease βiI and βiE for the age groups between 0 to 19 years only.
Another possibility is to include isolation of only elderly individuals. Several non-pharmaceutical measures have been
already described in literature [42], other studies show how the total number of infected might be changed due to the
efficiency of non-pharmaceutical measures [43].
Other models might present more complete analysis of the disease, including hospitalizations and even asymptomatic
cases, which are difficult to track and seem to vary a lot from place to place, the Diamond Princess cruise ship
found 17.9% of asymptomatic infections [44], while an airplane flight found 11.2% of cases being asymptomatic. An
Italian village presented 50 to 70% of cases being asymptomatic [45]. There are yet the problem of assuring that the
asymptomatic cases registered on studies are really asymptomatic and not presymtomatic, that is, are people still on the
incubation period.
Of course, any mathematical model is only as good as the data allows, using mathematical models to describe the
disease on countries with low testing rates might yield unrealistic predictions. For example, [46] estimates 86% of
infections being undocumented on China, at the early stages of the outbreak.
Another consideration we did not take, was the possibility of reinfection, where individuals leave the recovered
group and re-enter the susceptible compartment. However, since other coronaviruses belonging to the same genus
betacoronavirus such as the SARS-CoV and the MERS-CoV does not present a high enough mutation rate to cause
reinfection in short term [47], the only cause of reinfection would be the loss of antibodies to fight the virus; nevertheless,
on both diseases, the infected person acquires antibodies enough to prevent reinfection for a period of 2 - 3 years [48].
With those considerations, we did not assume reinfection was probable on short-term. Future studies may be conducted
to study the possibility of reinfection of individuals on the long-term.

Conclusion

Mathematical models of a disease outbreak such as the COVID-19 are able to predict the behavior of the infection. Both
models have proved to be efficient tools for acquiring data and forecast the future situation. Despite the limitations, the
models made it possible to achieve a value of R0 in good agreement with other studies, providing evidence in favor of
the validity of the model.
However, the present models do not take into consideration the spatial distribution of the population, reflecting on some
uncertainties that made the window of prediction larger.
The age division does not change the prediction drastically, suggesting that in the case of a simple prediction or analysis,
SIRD models are useful. The age division SEIRD model provides an advantage when requiring specific simulations on
specific groups of the population.
