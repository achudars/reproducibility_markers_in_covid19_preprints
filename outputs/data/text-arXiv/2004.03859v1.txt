More and more countries show a significant slowdown in the number of new COVID-19 infections
due to effective governmentally instituted lockdown and social distancing measures. We have analyzed the growth behavior of the top 25 most affected countries by means of a local slope analysis
and found three distinct patterns that individual countries follow depending on the strictness of the
lockdown protocols: exponential rise and fall, power law, or logistic. For countries showing power
law growth we have determined the scaling exponents. For countries that showed a strong slowdown
in the rate of infections we have extrapolated the expected saturation of the number of infections
and the expected final date. Two different extrapolation methods (logistic and parabolic) were
used. Both methods agree on the order of magnitude of saturation and end dates. Global infections
rates are analyzed with the same methods. The relevance and accuracy of these extrapolations is
discussed.

INTRODUCTION

In December 2019 a novel corona virus (COVID-19)
was discovered in Wuhan, China. The infections quickly
spread first within China but soon thereafter moved to
neighboring Asian countries and as of February 2020
reached all continents. The first massive outbreak outside mainland China happened in Northern Italy from
which it spread rapidly all over Europe. As of April 5th
23:00 CET over 1’270’000 people in 184 countries and regions have been infected [1]. Currently, the most affected
country is the USA with over 337310 infections.
Due to its high infectivity and since no medical cure
or vaccine is available yet governments around the world
have instituted drastic measures such as curfews, lockdowns and social distancing campaigns to slow down the
number of new infections and reduce the rate at which
the virus spreads.
The mortality rate has been found to be 2.5%[2] (comparison: SARS 9.6% [3] and H1N1 influenza 0.6%[4]) but
the severity of cases is much higher for the elderly population [5] and people with preexisting health conditions
like cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, diabetes, or
cancer [5, 6] as well as heavy smoking [7] where the mortality rates can increase to 5-11% [5].
Increasingly more countries affected by the COVID-19
virus find a reduction in the rate of new infections due
to strict lockdowns. While no country so far has reached
the same saturation of the total number of infections as
China many seem to be on the way towards this stage
showing a similar situation as China at the end of February 2020.
Traditionally biological systems such as the spreading
of a disease are modeled as exponential growth leading

to the differential equation
dN
= λN
dt
where N (t) is the cumulative number of infections and
λ > 0 is the growth rate. In the case of an unlimited
supply of susceptible individuals it follows immediately
that N (t) = eλt . Of course, in any real system, the
number of susceptible individuals in finite. Hence, as the
number of infections grows the rate will slow down and
eventually the total number of infections will saturate.
This can be modeled as

with

and N0 the initial infected population size and N∞ =
limt→∞ N (t) = K.
The logistic model has been used to model the COVID19 pandemic by several research groups [9–19].
The goodness of fit for the logistic model and other
models were studied for the China data in [9, 10, 12]. It
was found that for China the logistic model underestimates the final number of infections [10] and also that
it does not predict the correct growth rates while still
in the strong growth regime [18]. A quality criterion to
determine the goodness of expected number of infections
was determined in [19]. Data from Italy under the assumption of logistic growth was studied in [13–16, 18].

2
The problem with the logistic model is that it assumes
an exponential growth which is successively clamped off
by the diminishing reservoir of people to be infected.
Data analysis for the China data [20, 21] and for the
top 25 affected countries [22] as well as additional studies for particular countries [23, 24] have clearly shown,
however, that by the introduction of lockdown measures
and social distancing the growth phase is not exponential
any more but follows a power law. The scaling exponents
are country-specific and depend on the strictness of governmental interventions and the actual adherence of the
people. The power law growth is connected with the actual societal structure that has been shown to exhibit
small world or scale-free [25, 26] behavior. The spread
of disease is determined by the number of human interactions and therefore limiting those will control the rate
at which an infection can spread. After a short initial
exponential growth period the institution of a lockdown
reduces the possible spreading avenues: the number of infections as well as the number of recovered and deceased
patients follows a power law
N (t) = Btγ
until a slow down of the rate of infection in noticeable
due to a lack of susceptible hosts.
The reason why a power law growth is observed is as
follows: Assuming a densely populated area like a major city or town each individual will during the course
of a day have many different interactions with other people. Some of them will be with close relations, i.e. people
that are important for the individual such as spouse, children, family, friends, or coworkers. Others, however will
be random contacts when sharing the same space for example in public transport, shops, entertainment facilities
etc. For the spreading of a disease the importance of
the contact, whether or not it is close or random, is not
relevant. The important thing, from the point of view
of a virus, is close physical proximity. This might be
given at the dinner table, in the office, riding a bus or
train, or walking in the public park. In fact, on an average day the number of random contacts that satisfy the
transmission criterion might well be much larger than the
contacts an individual has with his close relations. Random contacts however are the central ingredient for an
exponential growth. By instituting lockdown measures,
social distancing and telling people to stay at home it is
essentially possible – if properly followed – to eliminate
all random contacts leaving only the close relations of
family and work. It has been observed that the networks
spanned by those relationships follow a power law behavior [25, 26]. Since the virus has now only this network as
means of spreading it follows that the number of infections will also show a power law dependence. In reality
it is, of course, not possible to eliminate all random contacts (for example interactions in grocery shops), but so
far the data shows that the stricter the lockdown measures are and the more people adhere to it the closer to
a power low the rate of infections behaves.

METHOD

All data related to COVID-19 was downloaded from
the publicly available JHU-CSSE (2020) data source provided continuously by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE)
[27]. Aggregate data calculation for countries with different regions or states were performed after collecting by a
simple summation over all associated regions or provinces
(for the countries China, Australia, and Canada).
We have selected the data sets with the 25 most infections (and China) as presented in [1] on 2020-04-05 23:00
CET. The countries and their infection counts are given
in Table I.
In our previous publication [22] we have determined
the scaling coefficients γ for each of the 25 most affected
countries and compared the relative growth rates with
each other. Since more data is available by now we
have analyzed the local slopes of the presumed power
law range in further detail. In a log-log representation
log N (t) vs. log t a power law N (t) ∼ Btγ becomes
log N (t) = γ log(x) + log(B)
Hence, the derivative is
d log N (t)
= γ = const.
d log(t)
We have calculated the discrete derivative (local slope)
∆ log N (t)
∆ log t
over the available range and plotted it against the time
to analyze the power law behavior over time. A power
law behavior would exhibit regions of constant values,
whereas monotonically increasing values would indicate
exponential growth and decreasing values exponential
slow down. This plot serves as an amplifier of the internal
structures governing the growth rate to unveil changes
that cannot be seen in a simple log-log representation of
the data.
On data sets where we have found a significant downward trend of this slope (i.e. a slowdown of the growth
rate) we have also performed two extrapolation methods
in order to determine the presumed end of the infection
in that particular country. In Fig. 1 the infection data
for the Netherlands is plotted with a logistic equation fit.
At first the glance the logistic equation fits the data
well. However a closer examination in the log-log representation shows that the logistic equation fits the data
only well closer to the saturation point when the growth
rate is already substantially slowing down. The log-log
representation of the total number of infections in the
Netherlands together with the superimposed power law
fit and the logistic fit are given in Fig. 2. It can be
seen clearly that the data follows a power law behavior

Figure 2. Log-log representation of the total number of infections in the Netherlands with superimposed power law and

than the logistic equation, particularly in the beginning of the
infection spread.

data. The data seems to follow a power law over a long range
of the available data.

saturation. It is also obvious that the local slopes do
not correspond to what one would expect from a logistic
curve. In the case of China it was observed that the closer
to the saturation the data tended the better a fit to the
logistic equation was found [9–12].
The logistic extrapolation performs a non-linear fit to
equation (2) and determines the parameters K, B, and
r by a non-linear least square calculation (LevenbergMarquardt [28, 29]). Since by definition the final number
of predicted infections is never reached we have chosen
the time t at which 95% of the final value is reached to be
indicative for the end date. Therefore the extrapolated
values for N∞,log and t|N (t)=0.95N∞,log are calculated.
The parabolic fit [21] calculates a least square fit to an
inverted parabola in the log-log plot y = ax2 + bx + c.
The extremal point x0 determines the time when the full
saturation has been reached and y0 the total number of
infections by:
x0 =

−b
, y0 = ax20 + bx0 + c

and
in most of the available data range and that the logistic fit is particularly bad in the beginning of the growth
phase.
The local slope calculation is shown in Fig. 3 for the
infection data in the Netherlands. The best fit for the
logistic equation and the power law fit is superimposed.
As can be seen clearly the local slope remains constant
over nearly the whole data range and only the last three
data points show a substantial decrease in the local slope
and a close following of the logistic equation towards the

N∞,par = 10y0 , tpar = 10x0
An example of this extrapolation is given in Fig. 4
for the total number of infections in Switzerland. The
extrapolated extremum is marked with an arrow.
In order to obtain a more accurate estimation we
have performed the extrapolation calculations starting
with the last 5 data points and extending the number of data points backwards up to the last 30 data
points. If the predicted parameters tpar and N∞,par for

the parabola fit and tlog |N (t)=0.95N∞,log and N∞,log for the
logistic fit were plausible, that is tprediction > tcurrent and
N∞ > N (tcurrent ), then they were aggregated to an average value tlog and tpar and N ∞,log and N ∞,par respectively including their standard deviations.
It should be noted that the right part of the inverted
parabola after the extremum (x0 , y0 ) does not have any
physical significance.
Additionally the parabola fit is very sensitive to the
data. If the data points show a temporary increase again
the parabola might flip sides and will find the extremum
on the left of the data with an x0 that is smaller than the
most recent data point or might flip such that it points
upwards. In such cases an extrapolation was not possible.
With respect to local deviations of the data towards the
saturation the non-linear logistic fit is much more stable
and will find reasonable fits also in situations where the
parabolic fit fails.

RESULTS

We have analyzed the local slope of all the countries
given in Table I. As indicated we have additionally performed extrapolations for the countries which showed a
significant slowdown in their local slope plot. As of 202004-05 apart from China 20 of the top 25 countries showed
signs of a slowdown in the rate of infections, the 5 remaining countries are still in a strong growth phase. We have
calculated the scaling exponent γ for these countries and
summarized them in Table II.
While investigating the local slope of different countries we have noticed that not all follow them same

growth behavior. We have identified 3 different growth
patterns that show very different behaviors:
1. rise and fall pattern (exponential): the total
number of infections stays very low for a long time
and then suddenly shoots up dramatically and exponentially. After a short period of time it slows
down equally rapidly with the rate of the slow down
being exponential as well. Example countries are
US, France, Canada, and Australia. A plot of such

a behavior is shown in Fig. 5 for the USA.
2. power law pattern: after an initial increase the
growth becomes a power law and stays for most of
the time there. Only at the end of the epidemic
it slows down again and can be fitted by a logistic
equation. Examples of countries with this behavior
are China, the Netherlands, Norway, Czech Republic, Chile, and Russia. A plot of the power law behavior is given in Fig. 6 for a selection of different
countries.
3. logistic pattern: the growth follows quite closely
the shape of a logistic equation. Examples of countries are Austria, Switzerland, Ireland, and Israel.
A plot of such a behavior is shown in Fig 7 for
Austria.
An interesting mixed case is found in the data for Belgium. It starts out as typical rise and fall pattern but
then, due to stricter lockdown measures settles into a
power law growth. This behavior is shown in Fig. 8.
Perhaps the rise and fall pattern which we have discovered for various countries will eventually follow the same
behavior as Belgium or perhaps the rise and fall pattern
does move straight to the saturation. Currently it is too
early to confirm either hypothesis.
In Fig. 9 two countries showing exceptions to the patterns found in other countries are shown. First, South
Korea, where through wide range testing and strict isolation of infected individuals the government has managed to reduce the explosive exponential growth down to
a power low growth with an exceptionally low exponent
of 0.72. And on the other hand Denmark, where early

governmental measures proved effective and the exponential growth was reduced to a power law of 1.64 for a while
only to start to grow exponentially again soon thereafter.
The extrapolated final number of infections for both
extrapolations methods are shown in Fig. 10 for highly
affected countries and Fig. 11 for lesser affected countries.
As can be seen the extrapolations generally predict
the same order of magnitude apart from the US, France,
Canada, and Russia. The variability of the extrapolated
values depending on the considered number of points is
larger for the parabolic extrapolation. In the majority
of the considered data sets the parabolic extrapolations

again.

calculates larger final numbers of infections compared to
the logistic fit.
In Fig. 12 the current number of infections is plotted with the extrapolated estimates of different studies
[19, 30]. As can be seen the predicted final number of
infections varies considerably. Generally, though, the extrapolations in this study seem closer to the values of [30]
than to [19]. Particularly for the UK and the Nether-

lands the values reported [19] deviate strongly from our
calculations as well as those reported in [30]. One outlier is our extrapolation for France. While calculations
with earlier data have produced numbers in the order of
200’000-300’000 in line with the estimates of [19, 30] the
latest data points have drastically changed the extrapolation. Whether this is a fluke or, indeed, a solid trend
remains to be seen. In the case of the US the values reported in [19] are much lower than the one extrapolated
in our study and the calculated values in [30] and are
already overtaken by the current number of infections.

mated percentage of people infected relative to the country’s population is given in Table III. Additionally we
have indicated the growth pattern (shape) of the analyzed data set and the scaling exponent where the local
slope analysis showed a power law growth. It should be
noted that the final date indicated corresponds to the
time when 95% of the saturation value has been reached
and not when no new cases will be reported (which in
the case of the logistic curve happens only for t → ∞).
It is to be assumed, given the behavior of Belgium
in Fig. 8 that predictions made for countries showing
a rise and fall patterns are not accurate. The slowdown
might be just part of the transition to a slower power law
growth. Countries, however, that show a good logistic fit
such as Switzerland, Austria and others (see Table III)
might prove to have quite an accurate prediction. Expected saturation numbers for countries showing a power
law growth and subsequent slowdown would likely be less
accurate than countries with logistic patterns but still
more accurate and trustworthy than countries with a rise
and fall pattern.
The same local slope analysis can be performed for
the aggregated world wide total number of infections reported by the WHO in Fig. 13. As can bee seen the
history of the disease spread is accurately recovered form

the local slope plot. The beginning is marked by a power
law growth in mainland China with the subsequent saturation and stop of further growth. At this point the
number of infected people world wide picks up and the
rate of infections is shown to grow strongly exponentially.
The last few data points, however reveal a reversal of the
growth trend to an exponential slow down. Currently
3 of the top 5 most affected countries (USA, France and
Italy) show such as rise and fall exponential behavior and
only Spain and Germany have shown a power law growth.
Given that the USA has the strongest growth rate and
highest number of infections totaling currently at about
25% of the world wide total number it is not surprising
to see that the world data follows essentially the same
behavior as the USA.

While, indeed, the last few data points indicate that
the strong exponential growth is slowing down it cannot
be predicted whether the subsequent period will stabilize in an power law growth or a rapid decay towards
saturation for the world data as well as for the countries
exhibiting the rise and fall growth pattern such as USA,
France, and Italy.

DISCUSSION & CONCLUSIONS

We have analyzed the top 25 most affected countries
with the local slope analysis of the total number of infections and have found that different countries exhibit substantially different growth patterns. We have identified
three different patterns: exponential rise and fall, power
law, and logistic. For the countries following a power law

growth we have determined the country-specific scaling
exponent and summarized in Tables II and III.
For countries that exhibit a clear slowdown in the rate
at which the infections spreads we have extrapolated a
tentative final number of infections by two different extrapolations methods: logistic and parabolic. While it
has been shown that only few countries such as Austria
and Switzerland actually follow a logistic growth behavior the extrapolation with the logistic curve was still justified for other countries since the fit closer to the saturation seems to become increasingly better [9–12]. We
have used these extrapolation methods purely on numerical grounds and do not ascribe them the ability to actually explain the physical and biological reasons why
the spread would saturate exactly at those given points.
With few exceptions both extrapolations methods have
calculated the same order of magnitude of final numbers
of infections and also agree on the final date when this
point will be reached (95% of N∞ ).
It should be noted that while we have selected only
countries that showed a significant slowdown in the local
slope plot this does not mean that the data really moves
to a saturation. It might simply mean that the further
growth will settle to a power law growth once the governmental measures and lockdowns have started to take
effect. A slow down, thus, can mean that the growth has
now been reduced to a power law when most if not all
random encounters with other people have been eliminated. Only time will tell if this state of lockdown can
be maintained long enough that a real saturation of total
infections can be reached or if a second exponential wave
will start upon relaxing the lockdown measures too early.
It can also simply mean that the data currently shows
a downward trend just to pick up speed again a few days
later as can be seen in the data for the USA at around
day 50 (Fig. 5) and in data from Belgium at around day
33 (Fig. 8).
So far most extrapolations and predictions on the true
extent of the global pandemic (excluding China) for example [19, 30] seem to have severely underestimated the
final numbers of infections. So much so that the extrapolations of final numbers of infections of only a few days
ago are already overtaken by the current number of infections. Also it has been found that the logistic fit generally seems to underestimate the final number of infections
[10]. We do not expect the extrapolations in this study
to fare any better. We believe, however, that the predictions for the countries that actually exhibit a logistic
pattern such as Austria and Switzerland to be relatively
accurate. Much less accurate but likely to be in the right
order of magnitude are the countries exhibiting a power
law pattern with a recent slowdown. The least accurate
predictions and probably even underestimating the order
of magnitude are the countries following an exponential
rise and fall pattern.
Why then are the extrapolations so wrong? Firstly the
calculations of the saturations are based on the fitting of
some nonlinear function that determines its parameters

9
based on the previous data points. As we have shown
however there is hardly any evidence that for example
the logistic model in eq. (1) describes the actual progression of the pandemic (with a few notable exceptions).
Secondly, the physical and biological limit of possible infections is not reached by far. Current population infections are in the order of 0.2% of the total population
and are expected by the extrapolations to stay below
1% (Table III). That is far too little to effectively limit
the spread by herd immunization or actual lack of susceptible individuals. Thirdly, most models do not take
into account lockdown measures and interruption of disease spreading paths as instituted in many countries and
therefore predict with the first slow down the beginning
of the end of the pandemic. As shown in Fig. 8 for
Belgium this is simply not true. Finally, one should not
forget that power law growth, while not exponential, is
still growth. And it will still take a long time to reach the
point where an actual saturation has been achieved. So
far, outside mainland China, the only country that has
effectively managed to control the spread of the disease
is South Korea. But even there the number of infections
follows a power law with an extraordinarily low exponent of 0.7 (sub-linear growth) and no further slowdown
seems to be in sight. Also it should be noted that even
in China the pandemic is not over, it is just managed:
every day China registers between 50 and 100 new cases.
Reaching the saturation does not mean the end of the
pandemic. Leaving those few remaining daily new cases
uncontrolled and without strict isolation management, or
easing the strict measures too early can lead to a second,
perhaps more devastating wave. A cautionary example is
Denmark that managed to reduce the initial exponential
growth to a power law growth of 1.64 only to grow again
exponentially soon thereafter (Fig. 9).

taken as current extrapolations in the best case scenario
that the current slowdown is actually an indication of a
coming saturation and not just noise or transitions into a
different growth patterns. The most likely outcome, however, is that the countries showing a rise and fall pattern
are simply on the way to adjusting to a slower spread
with a power law as has been shown in the case of Belgium (Fig. 8) but will not reach the saturation range any
time soon.
Finally the analysis of the world wide spread of the
infection shows that the trend of a slowdown is a reflection of the the biggest contributor, the USA currently
contributing 25% of all cases. As long as the US is the
largest contributor the world data is likely to behave in
a similar way as the infections reported in the USA. One
should, however, not neglect that the numbers of infections given in the world data are much less accurate than
those reported by single countries. In particular countries
with few medical facilities or the lacking ability to test for
infections of the COVID-19 virus are bound to severely
under-report the true extent of the pandemic. Therefore it can only be assumed that the actual number of
infections is much higher and while the trend for individual countries, particularly in Europe and the USA might
point towards a saturation many countries on other continents might not have the means to manage the spread
of the disease. Due to the current low percentage of the
infections relative to the population this might initiate a
second wave of a global pandemic as soon as the strict
lockdown measures are relaxed and travels into countries
with less accurate reporting are allowed again.
