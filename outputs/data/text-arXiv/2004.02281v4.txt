Abstract
Recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 has affected all of our lives in one way
or the other. While medical researchers are working hard to find a cure and doctors/nurses
to attend the affected individuals, measures such as ‘lockdown’, ‘stay-at-home’, ‘social distancing’ are being implemented in different parts of the world to curb its further spread.
To model the non-stationary spread, we propose a novel time-varying semiparametric AR(p)
model for the count valued time-series of newly affected cases, collected every day and also
extend it to propose a novel time-varying INGARCH model. Our proposed structures of the
models are amenable to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling for efficient computation.
We substantiate our methods by simulations that show superiority compared to some of the
close existing methods. Finally we analyze the daily time series data of newly confirmed
cases to study its spread through different government interventions.

Introduction

Coronavirus is a class of viruses that primarily affect mammals and birds. The viruses in this
class predominantly cause respiratory infections among humans. Most of these viruses from this
class only cause mild respiratory infections or the common cold. To date, three viruses in this
class have been turned out to be deadly. In 2002-03, there was an outbreak of Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) with 11% fatality rate (Chan-Yeung and Xu, 2003). The year
2015 observed another deadly coronavirus Middle East Respiratory Syndrome(MERS) with 35%
1

fatality(Alsolamy and Arabi, 2015). The third one is COVID-19 which has caused this current
outbreak. The reported fatality of this virus is yet very low as compared to the other two. However,
it spreads much faster and can cause “community spread” when the cause of the infection can
no longer be traced back to its source. The source of this virus has been traced back to the wet
market in Wuhan, China and dates back to December 2019. Since then, it has been spreading
across the world. On January 20, 2020, United States (USA) recorded its first COVID-19 patient
in a man, returning from Wuhan, China. Italy reported its first confirmed case on January 31,
2020. After that, it has been spreading continuously.
Since there is no vaccine yet in the market, the government is implementing strong measures
such as city-wide or state-wide ‘lockdown’s, ‘stay-at-home’ notices, extensive testing to control
the outbreak. Thus, this count-valued time-series of daily new cases of infection is expected to
vary largely. While initially by the contagious nature these spread looks exponential, once some
measures are undertaken the number of cases goes down but at varying degrees depending on how
strict was the enforcement, how dense is the population, etc. There has been ample research study
in a very short time to discuss the effectiveness of lockdown and forecast of the future path of
how the virus will spread. But somehow a comprehensive understanding of the statistical model,
its estimation and uncertainty quantification remains inadequate. SIR model (Song et al., 2020),
proportional model (Deb and Majumdar, 2020), some Bayesian epidemic models (Clancy et al.,
2008; Jewell et al., 2009) etc. have been used in the context of continuous modelling because it
benefits time-series formulation and ready computation. Relatively straight-forward models have
been considered such as polynomial trends or presence of an ARMA structure etc. However, we
wish to stick to the actual daily count of new affections and this brings us to a unique juncture of
analyzing a count time series with smooth varying coefficients.
Modeling count time series is important in many different fields such as disease incidence,
accident rates, integer financial datasets such as price movement, etc. This relatively new research
stream was introduced in Zeger (1988) and interestingly he analyzed another outbreak namely
the US 1970 Polio incidence rate. This stream was furthered by Chan and Ledolter (1995) where
Poisson generalized linear models (GLM) with an autoregressive latent process in the mean are
discussed. A wide range of dependence was explored in Davis et al. (2003) for simple autoregressive
(AR) structure and external covariates. On the other hand, a different stream explored integer-

2

valued time series counts such as ARMA structures as in (Brandt and Williams, 2001; Biswas and
Song, 2009) or INGARCH structure as done in Zhu (2011, 2012c,a,b). However, from a Bayesian
perspective, only work to best of our knowledge is that of Silveira de Andrade et al. (2015) where
the authors discussed an ARMA model for different count series parameters. However, their
treatment of ignoring zero-valued data or putting the MA structure by demeaned Poisson random
variable remains questionable. None of these works focused on the time-varying nature of the
coefficients except for a brief mention in Karmakar et al. (2020+).
The rapid change in the observed counts make all earlier time-constant analysis inappropriate
and builds a path where we can explore methodological and inferential development in tracking
down the trajectory of this spread. Thus, we propose a novel semiparametric time-varying autoregressive model for counts to study the spread and examine the effects of these interventions
in the spread based on the time-varying coefficient functions. A time-varying AR(p) process consists of a time-varying mean/intercept function along with time-varying autoregressive coefficient
functions. We further generalize it to a time-varying integer-valued generalized autoregressive
conditional heteroscedasticity (tvINGARCH) model where the conditional mean depends also on
the past conditional means. Given the exponential trend of the spread, it is expected that the
mean would vary with the level.
Our goals are motivated by both the application and methodological development. To the best
of our knowledge, ours is the first attempt to model possibly autoregressive count time series with
time-varying coefficients. The mean function stands for the overall spread and the autoregressive
coefficients stand for different lags. Since this virus can be a largely asymptomatic carrier for the
first few days we wish to identify which lags are significant in our model which can be directly
linked to how many days the symptom spread but did not show up. We show that for different
areas lags 6 to 10 are significant. These findings are in-line with several research articles discussing
the incubation length for the novel coronavirus with a median of 5-6 days and 98% below 11 days.
For example, see Lauer et al. (2020b). A few provinces, state, countries have ordered lockdown or
stay-at-home orders of various degree and we find that even after these orders are in effect it takes
about 12-16 days to reach the peak and then the intercept coefficient function starts decreasing.
This is also an interesting find which characterizes the fact that the number of infected but
asymptomatic cases is large compared to the new cases reported. Additional to the time-varying

3

AR model proposal, we also offer an analysis via time-varying INGARCH model that assumes an
additional recursive term in the conditional expectation (cf. (2.9)). This extension offers some
more comprehensiveness in the modeling part as even INGARCH with small orders can help us get
rid of choosing an appropriate maximum lag value. Since for a Poisson model, the mean is same
as the variance, this can also be thought as an extension of the GARCH model in the context of
count data. First introduced by Ferland et al. (2006), these models were thoroughly analyzed in
Zhu (2012c,a, 2011, 2012b); Ahmad and Francq (2016). Our proposal of time-varying INGARCH
model adapts to the non-stationarity theme and also can be viewed as a new contribution. Finally,
we contrast the time-varying AR and the GARCH for both simulations and real-data applications
under different metrics of evaluation.
An important criticism of the estimate of basic reproduction number in the various research
items over the past two months of Feb and March 2020 is its huge degree of variability. This
skepticism is natural as the serial interval distribution of a disease cannot be estimated consistently
unless we have an exact infector/infectee pair dataset. The majority of this research is pulling out
these estimates based on what we know about two other outbreaks, namely SARS and MERS.
One can easily see the R0 estimates from the popular R0 package by Obadia et al. (2012) depends
on the start and end date and a plugin value of the serial distribution. Keeping this in mind,
we decided to NOT have R0 coefficient in our model. Instead, we focus on the autoregressive
coefficient functions and provide insights which we believe can be used to develop new estimates
of the basic reproduction number from the data itself, without having to rely on the serial number
distribution from other diseases.
In our present context, the number of affected can be covered by the popular SIR model
in this case, however, they assume additional structure on how these numbers evolve and then
tries to estimate the rate. Instead, we do not assume any such specific evolution and offer a
general perspective. Our simulation results corroborate a consistent estimation of the unknown
functions. Regression models with varying coefficient were introduced by Hastie and Tibshirani
(1993). They modeled the varying coefficients using cubic B-splines. Later, these models has been
further explored in various directions Gu and Wahba (1993); Biller and Fahrmeir (2001); Fan and
Zhang (2008); Franco-Villoria et al. (2019); Yue et al. (2014). Spline bases have been routinely
used to model the time-varying coefficients within non-linear time series models (Cai et al., 2000;

4

Huang et al., 2002; Huang and Shen, 2004; Amorim et al., 2008). We also consider the B-spline
series based priors to model the time-varying coefficients in our model. In Bayesian literature of
non-linear function modeling, B-splines series based priors have been extensively developed under
different shape constraints (He and Shi, 1998; Meyer, 2012; Das and Ghosal, 2017; Mulgrave et al.,
2018; Roy et al., 2018). To the best of our knowledge, there is no other work that puts (2.2) or
(2.10)-specific shape constraints, required for a time-varying AR or GARCH using B-spline series.
We also discuss a pointwise inferential tool by drawing credible intervals. Such tools are important
to keep an objective perspective in terms of the evolution of the time-varying coefficients without
restricting it to some specific trend models. See Karmakar et al. (2020+) ( Karmakar (2018) for
an earlier version) for a comprehensive discussion on time-varying models and their applications.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the proposed Bayesian models
in detail. Section 3 discusses an efficient computational scheme for the proposed method. We study
the performance of our proposed method in capturing true coefficient functions and show excellent
performance over other existing methods in Section 4. Section 5 deals with an application of the
proposed method on COVID-19 spread for different countries. Then, we end with discussions,
concluding remarks and possible future directions in Section 6. The supplementary materials
contain theoretical proofs.

Modeling

In this paper, our primary focus is on modeling the daily count of newly confirmed cases of
COVID-19 in a non-parametric way. Instead of compartmental models from epidemiology, we
choose to focus on building a model solely out of the COVID-19 dataset. Figure 1 illustrates the
logarithm of the absolute values of fitted residuals for different methods on the COVID-19 spread
data from Spain. We find that the time-varying AR model fits the data much better than other
routinely used time-constant methods. Given the current knowledge of the incubation period of
the virus (Lauer et al., 2020a), we fit models until lag 10 for the autoregressive part. For the
conditional heteroscedastic models, we consider the order as (1,1), which is a standard choice
for such models. This motivates us to consider the non-stationary time-series models such as
usual tvAR regression. However, we emphasize that these existing methods are suitable only for
continuous valued variables and not for count-valued series.

data from Spain.
This motivation sets up the stage to discuss Poisson autoregression with time-varying coefficients. Let {Xt } be a count-valued time series. In this paper, we consider two different structures
for the conditional mean of {Xt } given the history of the process. The first modeling framework is
in the spirit of time-varying auto-regressive models. Next, we consider another modeling structure
in the direction of time-varying generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity models.

2.1

Time-varying auto-regressive model for counts

The linear Poisson autoregressive model (Zeger, 1988; Brandt and Williams, 2001) is popular
in analyzing count valued time series. Due to the assumed non-stationary nature of the data,
we propose a time-varying version of this model. The conditional distribution for count-valued
time-series Xt given Ft−1 = {Xi : i ≤ (t − 1)} is,
Xt |Ft−1 ∼Poisson(λt ) where λt = µ(t/T ) +

ai (t/T )Xt−i .

i=1

We call our method time-varying Bayesian Auto Regressive model for Counts (TVBARC). The
rescaling of the time-varying parameters to the support [0,1] is usual for in-filled asymptotics. Due
to the Poisson link in (2.1), both conditional mean and conditional variance depend on the past
observations. The conditional expectation of Xt in the above model (2.1) is E(Xt |Ft−1 ) = µ(t/T )+

ai (t/T )Xt−i , which is positive-valued. Additionally, we impose the following constraints on

parameter space for the time-varying parameters,

ak (x) < 1}.

Note that, the conditions imposed (2.2) on the parameters is somewhat motivated from the stationarity conditions for the time-constant versions of this models. This is not uncommon in
time-varying AR literature. See Dahlhaus and Subba Rao (2006); Fryzlewicz et al. (2008); Karmakar et al. (2020+) for example. Even though the condition on µ(·) seem restrictive in the light
of what we need for invertible time-constant AR(p) process with Gaussian error, it is not unusual
when it is used to model variance parameters to ensure positivity; it was unanimously imposed
for all the literature mentioned above. Additionally, the above references heavily depend on local
stationarity: namely, for every rescaled time 0 < t < 1, they assume the existence of an X̃i process
which is close to the observed process. One key advantage of our proposal is it is free of any such
assumption. Our assumption of only the first moment is also very mild. Moreover, except for a
very general linear model discussed in (Karmakar et al., 2020+), to the best of our knowledge,
this is the very first analysis of the time-varying parameter for count time-series modeled by Poisson regression. Thus we choose to focus on the methodological development rather than proving
the optimality of these conditions. When p = 0, our proposed model reduces to routinely used
nonparametric Poisson regression model as in Shen and Ghosal (2015).
To proceed with Bayesian computation, we put priors on the unknown functions µ(·) and
ai (·)’s such that they are supported in P1 . The prior distributions on these functions are induced
through basis expansions in B-splines with suitable constraints on the coefficients to impose the

exp(βj ) ≥ 0. Thus, the induced priors, described in (2.3)− (2.8) are well supported in P.

2.2

Time-varying generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity model for counts

In the previous model, both conditional mean and conditiona variance depend on the past observations. However, Ferland et al. (2006) proposed integer valued analogue of generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity model (GARCH) after observing that the variability in number
of cases of campylobacterosis infections also changes with level. Given the complexity of COVID-19
data, we also introduce the following time-varying version of the integer valued generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity model (INGARCH) for counts. The conditional distribution
for count-valued time-series Xt given Ft−1 = {Xi : i ≤ (t − 1)} and Gt−1 = {λi : i ≤ (t − 1)} is,
Xt |Ft−1 , Gt−1 ∼Poisson(λt ) where λt = µ(t/T ) +

This constraint ensure a unique solution of the time-varying GARCH process as discussed in
Ferreira et al. (2017). Now, we modify the proposed prior from the previous subsection to put
prior on the functions µ(·), ai (·) and bj (·) such that they are supported in P2 . Using the B-spline
bases, we put following hierarchical prior on the unknown functions,

(2.18)

λ0 ∼Inverse-Gamma(d1 , d1 ).

(2.19)

Similar calculations from previous subsection also shows that the above hierarchical prior in (2.11)
to (2.19) is well-supported in P2 . We primarily focus on the special case where p = 1, q = 1.

Posterior computation

In this section, we discuss Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling method for posterior
computation. Our proposed sampling is dependent on gradient based Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
(HMC) sampling algorithm (Neal et al., 2011). Hence, we show the gradient computations of
the likelihood with respect to different parameters for TVBARC(p) and TVBINGARCH(p, q) in
following two subsections.

While fitting TVBINGARCH(p,q), we assume for any t < 0 Xt = 0, λt = 0. Thus, we need to
additionally estimate the parameter λ0 . The derivative of the likelihood concerning λ0 is calculated
numerically using the jacobian function from R package pracma. Hence, it is sampled using the
HMC algorithm too.
As the parameter spaces of θij ’s and ηkj ’s have bounded support, we map any Metropolis candidate, falling outside of the parameter space back to the nearest boundary point of the parameter
space. The number of leapfrog steps is kept fixed at 30, however, the step size parameter is tuned
to maintain an acceptance rate within the range of 0.6 to 0.8. The step length is reduced if the
acceptance rate is less than 0.6 and increased it if the rate is more than 0.8. This adjustment is
done automatically after every 100 iterations. Due to the increasing complexity of the parameter
space in TVBINGARCH, we propose to update all the parameters involved in ai (·)’s and bk (·)’s
together.

Simulation studies

In this section, we study the performance of our proposed Bayesian method in capturing the
true coefficient functions. We explore both TVBARC and TVBINGARCH with some competing
models. It is important to note that, this is to the best of our knowledge first work in Poisson
11

autoregression with a time-varying link. Thus, we compare our method with the existing timeseries models with time-constant coefficients for count data and time-varying AR with Gaussian
error. We also examine the estimation accuracy of the coefficient functions to the truth.
The hyperparameters c1 and c2 of the normal prior are all set 100, which makes the prior
weakly informative. The hyperparmaters for Inverse-Gamma prior d1 = 0.1, which is also weakly
informative. We consider 6 equidistant knots for the B-splines. We collect 10000 MCMC samples
and consider the last 5000 as post burn-in samples for inferences. In absence of any alternative
method for time-varying AR(p) model of count-valued data, we shall compare the estimated
functions with the true functions in terms of the posterior estimates of functions along with its
95% pointwise credible bands. The credible bands are calculated from the MCMC samples at
each point t = 1/T, 2/T, . . . , 1. We also compare different competing methods in terms of average
MSE (AMSE) score using the INGARCH method of tsglm of R package tscount, GARMA using
P
tscount as well, tvAR and our proposed Bayesian methods. We define AMSE as T1 t (Xt − λ̂t )2 .

Case 1: TVBARC structure

Here, we consider two model settings p = 1; Xt ∼ Poisson(µ(t/T ) + a1 (t/T )Xt−1 ) and p = 2; Xt ∼
Poisson(µ(t/T ) + a1 (t/T )Xt−1 + a2 (t/T )Xt−2 ) for t = 1, . . . , T . Three different choices for T have
been considered, T = 100, 500 and 1000. The true functions are,

µ0 (x) =10 exp − (x − 0.5)2 /0.1 ,
a10 (x) =0.3(x − 1)2 + 0.1,
a02 (x) =0.4x2 + 0.1.
We compare the estimated functions with the truth for sample size 1000 in Figures 2 and
Figure 3 for the models p = 1 and p = 2 respectively. Tables 1 and 2 illustrate the performance
of our method with respect to other competing methods.

Case 2: TVBINGARCH structure

For the tvINGARCH case, we only consider one simulation settings p = 1, q = 1; Xt ∼ Poisson(µ(t/T )+
a1 (t/T )Xt−1 + b1 (t/T )λt−1 ). Two different choices for T have been considered, T = 100 and 200,

µ0 (x) =25 exp − (x − 0.5)2 /0.1 ,
a1 (x) =0.4x2 + 0.1,
b1 (x) =0.1 sin(πx) + 0.2
Figures 4 compares the estimated functions with the truth for sample size 200 for the model
in (2.9) with p = 1, q = 1. The performance of our method is compared to other competing
methods in Tables 3.

green.
Figure 2 to 4 shows that our proposed Bayesian method captures the true functions quite well
for both of the two simulation experiments. We find that the estimation accuracy improves as the
sample size increases. As the sample size grows, the 95% credible bands are also getting tighter,
implying lower uncertainty in estimation. This gives empirical evidence in favor of the estimation
consistency Even though the credible intervals form a very useful tool to build pointwise inference
for the time-trajectory of these coefficient functions, we do not report the coverage probability
here. The average mean square error (AMSE) is always the lowest for our method in Tables 1, 2
and 3. For the Poisson distribution, mean and variance are the same. Since µ0 (x) is around 10
for simulation case 4.1, the optimal AMSE will be around 10, which is achieved by our method.
Similarly for simulation case 4.2, the optimal AMSE is expected to be around 25.

COVID-19 data application

We collect the data of new affected cases for every day from 23rd January to 14th April from an

open-source platform {https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset}.
Table 4 provide a summary of total affected cases along with the number of recovered and deceased for three most affected countries along with Hubei, New York City (NYC) and Seoul,
South Korea. Seoul is selected in the analysis for its unique approach to curbing the outbreak by
implementing an aggressive testing strategy. Hubei, Italy and NYC enforced region-wide strict
lockdown on January 23rd, March 10th, and March 20th respectively. The US, in general, has
implemented selective lockdowns across the country.South Korea took an alternative measure to
track the movements of all affected individuals and to conduct tests for COVID-19 for as many
15

countrymen as possible.
We fit the TVBARC model in (2.1) with p = 10 and the TVINGARCH model in (2.9) with
p = 1, q = 1 for the selected set of countries. The hyperparameters are the same as in the Section 4.
We collect 5000 post-burn samples for inference after burn-in 5000 MCMC samples. We calculate
derivatives of the estimated functions using derivatives of B-splines (De Boor, 2001). Note that
the confidence bands around the estimated curves provide an uncertainty quantification and offer
us to objectively decide on statistically testing certain time-trends.
We compile square-root average MSE (AMSE) scores for different methods in Table 5. One
can see all the time-varying methods are doing exceptionally better compared to the time-constant
methods. This is not surprising since the spread distribution shows significant time-nonstationarity.
Interestingly, one of the two Bayesian methods we proposed in this paper stands out as the best
fit. We analyzed three countries, two cities and the earliest epicenter Hubei separately in our
analysis. The mechanism of spread in these regions behave a little differently due to population
density, government interference, travel, etc. However, some patterns are very eminently similar
to all these regions.

Intercept trend: The trend function µ(·) behaves very similarly for US (Fig 5), Spain (Fig 9)

different for Seoul (Fig 15) and very different for Hubei (Fig 11). Since this analysis is using the
data post Jan 23, whereas the first set of infections in Hubei was in mid-December, it is natural
that the peak has occurred sometimes earlier and thus the decreasing trend. The slightly bimodal

nature for Seoul looks interesting however this might be due to the relatively smaller numbers for
Seoul. One can also find similarity in the number of days to reach a peak after strict lockdown
has been enforced. Our estimate puts it around 15-20 days.
AR(1) function: Note that, at a country level, for each of the US, Spain, and Italy, the
estimated lag 1 coefficient a1 (·) were not large and generally did not vary much over time. However,
the pattern is very different for the cities as one can see this coefficient dominates the other lags
significantly. Hubei and Seoul showed a declining curve with periodic peaks however for NYC,
there was an initial decline, possibly due to the low values around February. But since the
beginning of March, the a1 (·) grew very steadily which means the infection was spreading in an
exponential fashion which matches the empirical numbers we observed in this time-frame. The
peak for the mean function µ(·) is downward at present but the worrying sign is the upward
nature of a1 (·). Interestingly one can see since the lockdown was imposed strictly on March 20 in
New York, a1 has declined and thus it is not unfair to conclude that this measure has helped in
prohibiting the rate of spread. This also explains why we see similar patterns in Hubei and Seoul
for the AR(1) function. Also, a natural question is why we do not observe this at a country level.
A possible explanation is that the countries are more heterogeneous and with varying degrees of
initial infection and local interference.
Important lag: The TVBARC model for the US and Italy shows interestingly the sixth lag
is dominating lag 1 or 2 almost uniformly. We think this is an extremely important find as this
matches medical research that talks about the incubation period of the virus. The number of days

17

required for the symptoms to show up after an infection has been spread is currently being widely
researched and this incubation day has been proposed to have a median of 6 days and a 98%
quantile of 11 days, see Lauer et al. (2020b). Our finding is coherent with this. This direction of
research could potentially be transformative since while estimating the basic reproduction number,
there is no result, to the best of our knowledge that could estimate the lag between symptom onset
between infector and infectee from the data itself.
TVBINGARCH model: Finally, we conclude our discussion of real data analysis with a very
comprehensive model such as INGARCH. Even for INGARCH(1,1) model, the single additional
recursive parameter b1 (·) in light of model (2.9) allows us for an excellent fit instead of finding
the number of lags up to which one should fit. From Fig 6, 8 and 10, one can see there is a
striking similarity between the three countries the US, Spain, and Italy for the AR(1) and CH(1)
parameter curves. Hubei (Fig 12) and NYC (Fig 14) show similarity while Seoul (Fig 16) has
a different pattern for the CH(1) parameter. Many of these curves have multiple local peaks
which corroborate well with the numbers also fluctuating a little bit while flattening out. More
interestingly, for all the 6 figures one can see the CH(1) parameter is currently having an upward
trend while the intercept trend µ(·) is going down. This dichotomy is an interesting find and
can be corroborated with the fact that for a Poisson random variable the intensity parameter is
both the mean and variance. While the mean, in general, is going down the variability for small
numbers is somewhat relatively more.
We also provide the estimated derivatives of the estimated µ(·) functions in Fig 17. Overall,
we believe that our analysis of data from three countries and three populated cities depicts a
comprehensive picture of the mechanism of virus spread.

Discussion and Conclusion

We propose a time-varying Bayesian autoregressive model for counts (TVBARC) and time-varying
Bayesian integer-valued generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic model (TVBINGARCH) with linear link function within Poisson to study the time series of daily new confirmed cases of COVID-19. We develop a novel hierarchical Bayesian model that satisfies the
stability condition for the respective time-varying models and propose an HMC algorithm based
MCMC sampling scheme. The ‘R’ function with an example code can be found at https:

one can develop a time-varying Bayesian model for positive-valued time-series data too.
We summarize our main findings from the analysis of COVID-19 datasets here. First, we
address the time-varying nature of the dataset that takes care of not only how the virus spreads
but also different executive restrictions or government interference. It is a difficult task to pour in
other covariates as first it is debatable exactly what to include and second different countries, the
province even the residents probably behave differently. To keep the flexibility of how the numbers
evolve outside the autoregressive effects we choose to keep a mean/intercept coefficient µ(·). With
that model set-up, we analyze three different countries and three cites. We find out interesting
similarities between how the µ(·) behaves over time and see that typically there is a downward
trend after around 12 days after lockdown measures have been enforced. However, for the AR(1)
coefficient, the trends often show multiple peaks probably due to the asymptomatic spreading
capability of the virus. On the same note, another interesting find is to see how we find lag
number 6-7th to be important in the majority of the cases conforming to the facts published about
the incubation period length of coronavirus. We also propose an INGARCH model which is more
comprehensive than just an AR model and observed an interesting phenomenon in both simulation
and real-data analysis. We saw that from a predictive perspective we cannot say the INGARCH

25

always dominates an AR model and also when we settle for a small order INGARCH model we
tend to lose out on the interesting 6-7th lag phenomenon that is prevalent with this disease for
many cities and countries. However, time-varying INGARCH can be useful in summarizing the
coefficients more compactly.
There is growing skepticism in the various finding of R0, the basic reproduction number of the
pandemic. These are derived from the popular SIR model but, due to the huge non-stationary
propagation of the data, it is heavily dependent on start and end time. Also, the lags for symptom
onset between an infector and infectee is difficult to estimate and often done not from the data
itself, but SARS and MERS. We do not think this is a correct approach since the dynamics of
virus spread for COVID-19 has been different. Thus we offer a different approach rather than
having R0 in our model. However if one wants to make an explicit connection, one can propose
the ‘time-varying R0’ model extending from Obadia et al. (2012) as,
Xt |Ft−1 ∼ Poi(λt ), λt = R(t)

∞
X

Xt−i wi

i=1

one can see this is very similar to saying ai (t/T ) = R(t)wi . Moreover, the interesting find in our
paper allows us to highlight that the weights wi have a high concentration around lag 6. This
alternative way of using the data itself to re-estimate the reproduction number can be transformative.
As future work, it will be interesting to include some country-specific information such as
demographic information, geographical area, the effect of environmental time-series, etc in the
model. These are usually important factors for the spread of any infectious disease. We can also
categorize the different types of government intervention effects to elaborate more on the specific
impacts of the same. In the future we wish to analyze the number of deaths, number of recovered
cases, number of severe/critical cases, etc. for these diseases as those will hopefully have different
dynamics than the one considered here and can provide useful insights about the spread and
measures required. For computational ease, we have considered same level of smoothness for all
the coefficient functions. Fitting this model with different levels of smoothness might be able to
provide more insights. Other than building time-varying autoregressive models for positive-valued
data using the hierarchical structure from this article, one interesting future direction is to extend
this model for vector-valued count data. In general, it is difficult to model multivariate count data.
There are only a limited number of methods to deal with multivariate count data (Besag, 1974;
26

Yang et al., 2013; Roy and Dunson, 2019). Building on these multivariate count data models,
one can extend our time-varying univariate AR(p) to a time-varying vector-valued AR(p). On
the same note, even though we imposed Poisson assumption for increased model interpretation,
in the light of the upper bounds for the KL distance, it is not a necessary criterion and can be
applied to a general multiple non-stationary count time-series. Extending some of the continuous
time-series invariance results from Karmakar and Wu (2020) to multiple count time-series will be
an interesting challenge. Finally, we wish to undertake an autoregressive estimation of the basic
reproduction number with the time-varying version of compartmental models in epidemiology
immediately.
