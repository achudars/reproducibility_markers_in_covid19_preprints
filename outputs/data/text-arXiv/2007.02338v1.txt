ABSTRACT
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been creating a worldwide pandemic situation. Repurposing drugs, already shown
to be free of harmful side effects, for the treatment of COVID-19 patients is an important option in launching novel therapeutic
strategies. Therefore, reliable molecule interaction data are a crucial basis, where drug-/protein-protein interaction networks
establish invaluable, year-long carefully curated data resources. However, these resources have not yet been systematically
exploited using high-performance artificial intelligence approaches. Here, we combine three networks, two of which are
year-long curated, and one of which, on SARS-CoV-2-human host-virus protein interactions, was published only most recently
(30th of April 2020), raising a novel network that puts drugs, human and virus proteins into mutual context. We apply Variational
Graph AutoEncoders (VGAEs), representing most advanced deep learning based methodology for the analysis of data that are
subject to network constraints. Reliable simulations confirm that we operate at utmost accuracy in terms of predicting missing
links. We then predict hitherto unknown links between drugs and human proteins against which virus proteins preferably bind.
The corresponding therapeutic agents present splendid starting points for exploring novel host-directed therapy (HDT) options.

Introduction
The pandemic of COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease-2019) has affected more than 6 million people. So far, it has caused about
0.4 million deaths in over 200 countries worldwide (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html), with numbers still increasing rapidly.
COVID-19 is an acute respiratory disease caused by a highly virulent and contagious novel coronavirus strain, SARS-CoV-2,
which is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus1 . Sensing the urgency, researchers have been relentlessly searching for
possible therapeutic strategies in the last few weeks, so as to control the rapid spread.
In their quest, drug repurposing establishes one of the most relevant options, where drugs that have been approved (at least
preclinically) for fighting other diseases, are screened for their possible alternative use against the disease of interest, which is
COVID-19 here. Because they were shown to lack severe side effects before, risks in the immediate application of repurposed
drugs are limited. In comparison with de novo drug design, repurposing drugs offers various advantages. Most importantly, the
reduced time frame in development suits the urgency of the situation in general. Furthermore, most recent, and most advanced
artificial intelligence (AI) approaches have boosted drug repurposing in terms of throughput and accuracy enormously. Finally,
it is important to understand that the 3D structures of the majority of viral proteins have remained largely unknown, which
raises the puts up the obstacles for direct approaches to work even higher.
The foundation of AI based drug repurposing are molecule interaction data, optimally reflecting how drugs, viral and host
proteins get into contact with each other. During the life cycle of a virus, the viral proteins interact with various human proteins
in the infected cells. Through these interactions, the virus hijacks the host cell machinery for replication, thereby affecting
the normal function of the proteins it interacts with. To develop suitable therapeutic strategies and design antiviral drugs, a
comprehensive understanding of the interactions between viral and human proteins is essential2 .
When watching out for drugs that can be repurposed to fight the virus, one has to realize that targeting single virus proteins
easily leads to the viruses escaping the (rather simpleminded) attack by raising resistance-inducing mutations. Therefore, host-

directed therapies (HDT), which target human proteins that represent important carriers for the virus to enter and manipulate
the human cells, offer an important supplementary strategy3 . Unlike strategies that directly target the proteins of the virus, HDT
are thought to be less prone to developing resistance, because human proteins are less affected by mutations, and therefore
represent more sustainable drug targets. For establishing HDT, one has to identify proteins that are crucial for maintenance and
perseverance of the disease causing virus in the human cells. Once such proteins are targeted, the replication machinery of the
virus falls apart.
For all these reasons, repurposing drugs for HDT against COVID-19 has great potential. Moreover, it provides hope for
rapid practical implementation because of the lack of side effects.
Because the basis for drug repurposing screens are molecule interaction data, biological interaction networks offer invaluable
resources, because they have been carefully curated and steadily refined for many years. This immediately points out that
network based repurposing screens offer unprecedented opportunities in revealing targets for HDT’s, which explains the recent
popularity of such approaches in general4 . Evidence for the opportunities is further provided by successful approaches based
on viral-host networks in particular5, 6 , having led to therapy options for treating Dengue7 , HIV8 , Hepatitis C9 and Ebola10 .
Beyond fighting viruses, treatments for various other diseases have been developed11, 12 .
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, a handful of research groups have been trying to exploit network resources, developing
network algorithms for the discovery of drugs that can be repurposed to act against SARS-CoV-2. The first attempt was
made by Zhou et al.13 through an integrative network analysis, followed by Li et al.14 , who combined network data with a
comparative analysis on the gene sequences of different viruses to obtain drugs that can potentially be repurposed to act against
SARS-CoV-2.
Shortly thereafter, Gordon et al.15 conducted pioneering work by generating a map that juxtaposes SARS-CoV-2 proteins
with human proteins that were found to interact in affinity-purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) screens. Furthermore, in
independent work, Dick et al.16 identified high confidence interactions between human proteins and SARS-CoV-2 proteins
using sequence-based PPI predictors (a.k.a. PIPE4 & SPRINT).
Both of the studies15, 16 on SARS-CoV-2 provide data that had so far been urgently missing in the fight against COVID-19.
Only now, we are able to link existing (long term curated and highly reliable) drug-protein and human protein-protein interaction
data with proteins of SARS-CoV-2. In other words, only now we can draw links between the molecular agents of the virus and
existing drugs on a scale that is sufficiently large to allow for systematic high throughput repurposing screens. Still, of course,
it remains to design, develop and implement the corresponding strategies in order to exploit the now decisively augmented
resources.
As above-mentioned, in order to exploit resources to a maximum, one optimally makes use of sufficiently advanced AI
techniques. In this work, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, we combine all arguments raised above.
(1) We link existing high-quality, long-term curated and refined, large scale drug/protein - protein interaction data with
(2) molecular interaction data on SARS-CoV-2 itself, raised only a handful of weeks ago,
(3) exploit the resulting overarching network using most advanced, AI boosted techniques
(4) for repurposing drugs in the fight against SARS-CoV-2
(5) in the frame of HDT based strategies.
As for (3)-(5), we will highlight interactions between SARS-Cov-2-host protein and human proteins important for the virus
to persist using most advanced deep learning techniques that cater to exploiting network data. We are convinced that many of
the fairly broad spectrum of drugs we raise will be amenable to developing successful HDT’s against COVID-19.

Results
In the following, we will first describe the workflow of our analysis pipeline and the basic ideas that support it.
We proceed by carrying out a simulation study that proves that our pipeline accurately predicts missing links in the
encompassing drug - human protein - SARS-CoV-2-protein network that we raise and analyze. Namely we demonstrate that
our (high-performance, AI supported) prediction pipeline accurately re-establishes links that had been explicitly removed
before. This provides sound evidence that the interactions that we predict in the full network most likely reflect true interactions
between molecular interfaces.
Subsequently, we continue with the core experiments. We predict links to be missing in the full (without artificially having
removed links), encompassing drug - human protein - SARS-CoV-2-protein network, raised by combining links from year-long
curated resources on the one hand and most recently published COVID-19 resources on the other hand. As per our simulation
study, a large fraction, if not the vast majority of the predictions establish true, hence actionable interactions between drugs on
the one hand and SARS-CoV-2 associated human proteins (hence of use in HDT) on the other hand.

Figure 1. Overall workflow of the proposed method: The three networks SARS-CoV-2-host PPI, human PPI, and drug-target network
(Panel-A) are mapped by their common interactors to form an integrated representation (Panel-B). The neighborhood sampling strategy
Node2Vec converts the network into fixed-size low dimensional representations that perverse the properties of the nodes belonging to the
three major components of the integrated network (Panel-C). The resulting feature matrix (F) from the node embeddings and adjacency
matrix (A) from the integrated network are used to train a VGAE model, which is then used for prediction (panel-D).

For the purposes of high-confidence validation, we carry out a literature study on the overall 92 drugs we put forward. For
this, we inspect the postulated mechanism-of-action of the drugs in the frame of several diseases, including SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV driven diseases in particular.
Workflow
See Figure 1 for the workflow of our analysis pipeline and the basic ideas that support it. We will describe all important steps in
the paragraphs of this subsection.
See A & B in Figure 1. We have combined three interaction networks, two
of which represent year-long curated and much refined publicly available resources, namely drug-gene interaction and the
human interactome, together compiled from eight different, reliable and publicly accessible sources, and one of which the
SARS-CoV-2–human protein-protein-interaction (PPI) network was published only a few weeks ago. The integrated network
has four types of nodes:
Raising a Comprehensive Interaction Network.

3/19

1) SARS-CoV-2 proteins,
2) SARS-CoV-2-associated host proteins (CoV-host),
3) human proteins other than 2)
4) and drugs.
This means that we put drugs, human proteins and SARS-CoV-2 proteins into mutual context via the links provided by this
network. However, because the encompassing network is built from three subnetworks, links between nodes from different
individual subnetworks are presumably missing. It remains to predict them using an AI approach, preferably of utmost
performance. This AI approach needs to identify links across the individual subnetworks. Because new cross-subnetwork links
may imply links within the established networks as a consequence, the AI approach should also predict new links within the
individual parts of our network, if this is called for.
See C in Figure 1. To bring the link prediction machinery into effect, we raise a model that
operates in two stages. First, we employ a network embedding strategy (here: Node2Vec17 ), which extracts node features from
the integrated network. In a bit more formal detail, Node2Vec converts the adjacency matrix that represents the network into a
fixed-size, low-dimensional latent space the elements of which are the feature vectors of the nodes. Thereby, Node2Vec aims at
preserving the properties of the nodes relative to their surroundings in the network. For efficiency reasons, Node2Vec makes
use of a sampling strategy. The result of this step is a feature matrix (F) where rows refer to nodes and columns refer to the
inferred network features.
AI Model First Stage: Node2Vec

AI Model Second Stage: Variational Graph Autoencoders (VGAE). See B, C & D in Figure 1. In the next step, we employ
variational graph autoencoders (VGAE), as a most recent, graph neural network based technique shown to be of utmost accuracy,
to predict links in networks that although missing, are highly likely to exist18 . VGAE’s require the original graph, provided
by its adjacency matrix A and, optionally, a feature matrix that annotates the nodes of the network with helpful additional
information. Often, F does not necessarily refer to the topology of the network itself. Here, however, we do make use of the
feature matrix F that was inferred from A itself in the first step. We found that, despite just being an alternative representation
of A, using F aided in raising prediction accuracy substantially. This may not be surprising, however, because F consists of
knowledge obtained using Node2Vec, which, as being complementary to VGAE’s from a methodical point of view, cannot
necessarily revealed by VGAE’s itself.

See D in Figure 1. After training the VGAE, we finally predict links in the encompassing
drug-human-virus interaction network that had remained to be missing. For this, we make use of the decoding part of the
VGAE, which re-raises the network based on the latent representation the network provided by the encoder. Re-raising the
network results in edges between nodes that although not having been explicit before, are imperative to exist relative to the
encoded version of the network. Thereby, one predicts links between drugs and SARS-CoV-2-associated human proteins in
particular. Although these links had not been explicit elements of the drug-human interaction subnetwork before, their existence
is implied by the topological constraints the comprehensive network imposes. Thus, our model predicts both drugs and proteins:
repurposing these drugs leads to them targeting the matching proteins. See Figure 1 for the total workflow we just described.
Predicting Missing Links.

To reduce the computation time, we used a fast version of VGAE’s as proposed by Salha et
al.,19 . This fast version relies on a strategy by which to sample nodes. Using several non-overlapping test sets for different
numbers of sampling nodes, we evaluated the model based on sampling 5000 nodes as most suitable for our prediction task.
Addressing Computation Time.

Validation of the Learned Model
Let G = (V, E) be the entire drug-human-virus interaction network in the following, where nodes V represent drugs or proteins
and edges E represent interactions between them. We run Node2Vec17 on G to obtain a feature matrix F where rows can be
identfied with elements from V and columns represent features extracted from G.
After having computed F, we encode the network G into the embedding space using variational graph autoencoder (VGAE)
techniques. In detail, we use the FastGAE model19 as a version that decisively speeds up the learning process in the decoding
phase as a major argument. For encoding, FastGAE utilizes a (popular) Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) encoder. This
leads to encoding all nodes into the latent variable based embedding space. Therefore, FastGAE makes use of the original graph
adjacency matrix A, which codes the original topology of the graph, and F. Using FastGAE is explained by the fact that in the
decoding phase, a new version of the adjacency matrix has to be established, where A is huge (N × N, where N is the number
of all drugs, human proteins and SARS-CoV-2 proteins together), which slows down less rapid implementations of VGAE’s
decisively. To sort out this issue, FastGAE randomly samples subgraphs GS , referring to smaller sets of nodes S ⊂ V of size
NS , and reconstructs the corresponding submatrices AS in several iterations, each of which refers to a different S. Finally, the
submatrices of all samples are combined into an overarching matrix Ã, as an approximation of the matrix that gets reconstructed
as a whole in the decoding phase of slow approaches. Note that the approximation was shown to be highly accurate19 .

This reduces the training time compared to the general graph autoencoder model. We tested the model performance for
a different number of sampled nodes, keeping track of the area under the ROC curve (AUC), average precision (AP) score,
and model training time in the frame of a train-validation-test split at proportions 8:1:1. Table 1 shows the performance of the
model for sampled sugraph sizes NS = 7000, 5000, 3000, 2500 and 1000. For 5000 sampled nodes, the model’s performance is
sufficiently good enough concerning its training time and validation-AUC and -AP score. The average test ROC-AUC and AP
score of the model for Ns =5000 are 88.53 ± 0.03 and 84.44 ± 0.04.
To know the efficacy of the model in discovering the existing edges between only CoV-host and drug nodes, we train the
model (with Ns =5000) on an incomplete version of the graph where the links between CoV-host and drugs have been removed.
We further compute the feature matrix F based on the incomplete graph, and use it. The test set consists of all the previously
removed edges. The model performance is no doubt better for discovering those edges between CoV-host and drug nodes
(ROC-AUC: 93.56 ± 0.01 AP: 90.88 ± 0.02 for 100 runs).
The FastGAE model is learned with the feature matrix (F) and adjacency matrix (A). The node feature matrix (F) is
obtained from A using the Node2Vec neighborhood sampling strategy. The model performance is evaluated with and without
using F as feature matrix. Figure 2 shows the average performance of the model on validation sets with and without F as input
for the different number of sampling nodes. We calculate average AUC, and AP scores for 50 complete runs of the model.
From figure 2, it is evident that including F as feature matrix enhances the model’s performance markedly.

10 epoch in each run with a train-validation-test split of 8:1:1. Performance is reported over 100 runs for Ns =7000, 5000, 3000, 2500 and 1000

Graph Embedding of the Compiled Network
We use the Node2Vec framework to learn low dimensional embeddings of each node in the compiled network. It uses the
Skipgram algorithm of the word2vec model to learn the embeddings, which eventually groups nodes with a similar ‘role’ or
having a similar ‘connection pattern’ within the graph. Similar ‘role’ ensures that nodes within the sets/groups are structurally
similar/equivalent than the other nodes outside the groups. Two nodes are said to be structurally equivalent if they have identical
connection patterns to the rest of the network20 . To explore this, we have analyzed the embedding results in two steps. First,
we explore structurally equivalent nodes to identify ’roles’ and similar connection patterns to the rest of the networks, and
later use Lovain clustering to examine the same within the groups/clusters. The 0 most_similar0 function of the Node2Vec
inspects the structurally equivalent nodes within the network. We find out all the CoV-host nodes which are most similar to the
drug nodes. While it is expected to observe nodes of the same types within the neighborhood of a particular node, in some
cases, we found some drugs are neighbors of CoV-host proteins with high probability (pobs > 0.65). Figure 3 panel-C shows
a heatmap of 21 such drugs and their most similar CoV-host proteins. The drugs are hierarchically clustered based on the
similarity scores and demonstrated in the row-side dendrogram of the heatmap. A couple of these drugs are frequently used to
treat severe allergies, asthma, respiratory diseases, and gastrointestinal infections, which are the main symptoms of COVID
patients. Mainly, Dexamethasone, Cetirizine, isoprenaline, Betulinic acid and Clebopride, which are the probable neighbor of
CoV-host EXOSC3 ( with pobs: 0.71, 0.69, 0.67, 0.68 and 0.68, respectively, figure 3, panel-C) have a well-known effect on
these diseases. Betulinic acid has antiretroviral, antimalarial, and anti-inflammatory properties and acts as the inhibitors of

Figure 3. Results of applying Node2Vec on the whole network. Panel-A shows 2-dimensional t-SNE plot of all nodes in the network.
Panel-B shows the same for only drug and CoV-host nodes. Panel-C represents heatmap of 21 ‘most similar’ (structurally equivalent or have
similar ‘role’) drugs of CoV-hosts. The drugs are colored based on their clinical phase (red–launched, preclinical–blue, phase2/phase3–green
and phase-1/ phase-2–black ). Panel-D represents visualization of 17 Louvain clusters identified in the low dimensional embedding space.
Panel-E shows a network consisting of 6 drugs and their most probable neighbours within the network. These drugs share same Louvain
cluster with some CoV-host proteins.

SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease21 . Some other drugs such as ‘Clenbuterol’ and ‘Fenbendazole’, the probable neighbor of ppp1cb
and EEF1A respectively, are used as bronchodilators in asthma.
To explore the closely connected groups, we have constructed a neighborhood graph using the K-th nearest neighbor
algorithm from the node embeddings and apply Louvain clustering (Figure 3-panel-C). Although there is a clear separation
between host proteins (including CoV-host) cluster and drug cluster, some of the Louvain clusters contain both types of nodes.
For example, Louvain cluster-16 and -17 contain four and two drugs along with the other CoV-host proteins, respectively.
Figure 3 panel-D represents a network consisting of these six drugs and their most similar CoV-host nodes.
Drug–CoV-host Interaction Prediction
For drug–Cov-host interaction prediction, we exploit Variational Graph Autoencoder (VGAE), an unsupervised graph neural
network model, first introduced in18 to leverage the concept of variational autoencoder in graph-structured data. To make
learning faster, we utilized the fastGAE model to take advantage of the fast decoding phase. We have used two data matrices
in the fastGAE model for learning: one is the adjacency matrix, which represents the interaction information over all the
nodes, and the other one is the feature matrix representing the low-dimensional embeddings of all the nodes in the network.
We create a test set of ‘non-edges’ by removing all existing links between drugs and CoV-host proteins from all possible
combinations (332 CoV-host × 1302 drugs) of edges. The model is trained on the whole network with the adjacency matrix A
and feature matrix F. The trained model is then applied to the test ‘non-edges’ to know the most probable links. We identified a
total of 692 most probable links with 92 drugs and 78 CoV-host proteins with a probability threshold of 0.8. The predicted
CoV-host proteins are involved in different crucial pathways of viral infection (table 4). The p-values for pathway and GO
enrichment are calculated by using the hypergeometric test with 0.05 FDR corrections. Figure 4, Panel-A shows the heatmap of
probability scores between predicted drugs and CoV-host proteins. To get more details of the predicted bipartite graph, we

use a weighted bipartite clustering algorithm proposed by J. Beckett23 . This results in 4 bipartite modules (Panel-A figure
4): B1 (11 drugs, 28 CoV-host), B2 (4 drugs, 41 CoV-host), B3 (71 rugs and 4 CoV-host), and B4 ( 6 drugs and 5 CoV-host).
The other panels of the figure show the network diagram of four bipartite modules. B1 contains 11 drugs, including some
antibiotics (Anisomycin, Midecamycin), and anti-cancer drugs (Doxorubicin, Camptothecin). B3 also has some antibiotics such
as Puromycin, Demeclocycline, Dirithromycin, Geldanamycin, and Chlortetracycline, among them, the first three are widely
used for bronchitis, pneumonia, and respiratory tract infections24 . Some other drugs such as Lobeline and Ambroxol included in
the B3 module have a variety of therapeutic uses, including respiratory disorders and bronchitis. The high confidence predicted
interactions (with threshold 0.9) is shown in Figure 5 panel-A. To highlight some repurposable drug combination and their
predicted CoV-host target, we perform a weighted clustering (clusterONE)25 on this network and found some quasy-bicluques
(shown in Panel-B-E)
We matched our predicted drugs with the drug list recently published by Zhou et al.13 and found six common drugs:
Mesalazine, Vinblastine, Menadione, Medrysone, Fulvestrant, and Apigenin. Among them, Apigenin has a known effect in the
antiviral activity together with quercetin, rutin, and other flavonoids26 . Mesalazine is also proven to be extremely effective in
the treatment of other viral diseases like influenza A/H5N1 virus.27 .
Repurposable drugs for SARS-CoV-2
Baclofen and Fisetin

Baclofen, a benzodiazepine receptor (GABAA-receptor) agonist, has a potential role in antiviral associated treatment28 . Antiinflammatory antecedents fisetin is also tested for antiviral activity, such as for inhibition of Dengue (DENV) virus infection29 .
It down-regulates the production of proinflammatory cytokines induced by a DENV infection. Both of the drugs are listed in
the high confidence interaction set with the three CoV-hosts: TAPT1 (interacted with SARS-CoV-2 protein: orf9c), SLC30A6
(interacted with SARS-CoV-2 protein: orf9c), and TRIM59 (interacted with SARS-CoV-2 protein: orf3a) (Figure 5-panel-C).
Topoisomerase Inhibitors

Topoisomerase Inhibitors play an active role as antiviral agents by inhibiting the viral DNA replication30, 31 . Some Topoisomerase Inhibitors such as Camptothecin, Daunorubicin, Doxorubicin, Irinotecan and Mitoxantrone are predicted to interact with
several CoV-host proteins. It has been demonstrated that the anticancer drug camptothecin (CPT) and its derivative Irinotecan
have a potential role in antiviral activity32, 33 . It inhibits host cell enzyme topoisomerase-I which is required for the initiation
as well as completion of viral functions in host cell34 . Daunorubicin (DNR) has also been demonstrated as an inhibitor of
HIV-1 virus replication in human host cells35 . The conventional anticancer antibiotic Doxorubicin was identified as a selective
inhibitor of in vitro Dengue and Yellow Fever virus replication36 . It is also reported that doxorubicin coupling with monoclonal
antibody can create an immunoconjugate that can eliminate HIV-1 infection in mice cell37 . Mitoxantrone shows antiviral
activity against the human herpes simplex virus (HSV1) by reducing the transcription of viral genes in many human cells that
are essential for DNA synthesis38 .
Histone Deacetylases Inhibitors (HDACi)

Histone Deacetylases Inhibitors (HDACi) are generally used as latency-reversing agents for purging HIV-1 from the latent
reservoir like CD4 memory cell39 . Our predicted drug list (Table 3) contains two HDACi: Scriptaid and Vorinostat. Vorinostrate
can be used to achieve latency reversal in the HIV-1 virus safely and repeatedly40 . Asymptomatic patients infected with
SARS-CoV-2 are of significant concern as they are more vulnerable to infect large number of people than symptomatic patients.
Moreover, in most cases (99 percentile), patients develop symptoms after an average of 5-14 days, which is longer than the
incubation period of SARS, MERS, or other viruses41 . To this end, HDACi may serve as good candidates for recognizing and
clearing the cells in which SARS-CoV-2 latency has been reversed.
HSP inhibitor

Heat shock protein 90 (HSP) is described as a crucial host factor in the life cycle of several viruses that includes an entry in the
cell, nuclear import, transcription, and replication42, 43 . HSP90 is also shown to be an essential factor for SARS-CoV-2 envelop
(E) protein44 . In45 , HSP90 is described as a promising target for antiviral drugs. The list of predicted drugs contains three HSP
inhibitors: Tanespimycin, Geldanamycin, and its derivative Alvespimycin. The first two have a substantial effect in inhibiting
the replication of Herpes Simplex Virus and Human enterovirus 71 (EV71), respectively. Recently in46 , Geldanamycin and its
derivatives are proposed to be an effective drug in the treatment of COVID-19.
Antimalarial agent|DNA inhibitor, DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, DNA synthesis inhibitor

Inhibiting DNA synthesis during viral replication is one of the critical steps in disrupting the viral infection. The list of
predicted drugs contains six such small molecules/drugs, viz., Niclosamide, Azacitidine, Anisomycin, Novobiocin, Primaquine,
Menadione, and Metronidazole. DNA synthesis inhibitor Niclosamide has a great potential to treat a variety of viral infections,
including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and HCV virus47 and has recently been described as a potential candidate to fight the

SARS-CoV-2 virus47 . Novobiocin, an aminocoumarin antibiotic, is also used in the treatment of Zika virus (ZIKV) infections
due to its protease inhibitory activity. In 2005, Chloroquine (CQ) had been demonstrated as an effective drug against the
spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Recently Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) sulfate, a
derivative of CQ, has been evaluated to efficiently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro48 . Therefore, another anti-malarial
aminoquinolin drug Primaquine may also contribute to the attenuation of the inflammatory response of COVID-19 patients.
Primaquine is also established to be effective in the treatment of Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP)49 .
Cardiac Glycosides ATPase Inhibitor

Cardiac glycosides have been shown to play a crucial role in antiviral drugs. These drugs target cell host proteins, which help
reduce the resistance to antiviral treatments. The antiviral effects of cardiac glycosides have been described by inhibiting the
pump function of Na, K-ATPase. This makes them essential drugs against human viral infections. The predicted list of drugs
contains three cardiac glycosides ATPase inhibitors: Digoxin, Digitoxigenin, and Ouabain. These drugs have been reported to
be effective against different viruses such as herpes simplex, influenza, chikungunya, coronavirus, and respiratory syncytial
virus50 .
MG132, Resveratrol and Captopril

MG132, proteasomal inhibitor is established to be a strong inhibitor of SARS-CoV replication in early steps of the viral life
cycle51 . MG132 inhibits the cysteine protease m-calpain, which results in a pronounced inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication
in the host cell. In52 , Resveratrol has been demonstrated to be a significant inhibitor MERS-CoV infection. Resveratrol
treatment decreases the expression of nucleocapsid (N) protein of MERS-CoV, which is essential for viral replication. As
MG132 and Resveratrol play a vital role in inhibiting the replication of other coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV,
so they may be potential candidates for the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Another drug Captopril is known as
Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), which directly inhibits the production of angiotensin II. In53 , Angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2) is demonstrated as the binding site for SARS-CoV-2. So Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) may be
good candidates to use in the tentative treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infections54 .
In summary, our proposed method predicts several drug targets and multiple repurposable drugs that have prominent
literature evidence of uses as antiviral drugs, especially for two other coronavirus species SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Some
drugs are also directly associated with the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 identified by recent literature. However, further clinical
trials and several preclinical experiments are required to validate the clinical benefits of these potential drugs and drug targets.

Discussion
In this work, we have successfully generated a list of high-confidence candidate drugs that can be repurposed to counteract
SARS-CoV-2 infections. The novelties have been to integrate most recently published SARS-CoV-2 protein interaction data on
the one hand, and to use most recent, most advanced AI (deep learning) based high-performance prediction machinery on the
other hand, as the two major points. In experiments, we have validated that our prediction pipeline operates at utmost accuracy,
confirming the quality of the predictions we have raised.
The recent publication (April 30, 2020) of two novel SARS-CoV-2-human protein interaction resources15, 16 has unlocked
enormous possibilities in studying virulence and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2, and the driving mechanisms behind it. Only
now, various experimental and computational approaches in the design of drugs against COVID-19 have become conceivable,
and only now such approaches can be exploited truly systematically, at both sufficiently high throughput and accuracy.
Here, to the best of our knowledge, we have done this for the first time. We have integrated the new SARS-CoV-2 protein
interaction data with well established, long-term curated human protein and drug interaction data. These data capture hundreds
of thousands approved interfaces between encompassing sets of molecules, either reflecting drugs or human proteins. As a
result, we have obtained a comprehensive drug-human-virus interaction network that reflects the latest state of the art in terms
of our knowledge about how SARS-CoV-2 and interacts with human proteins and repurposable drugs.

For exploiting the new network—already establishing a new resource in its own right—we have opted for most recent and
advanced deep learning based technology. A generic reason for this choice is the surge in advances and the resulting boost in
operative prediction performance of related methods over the last 3-4 years. A particular reason is to make use of most advanced
graph neural network based techniques, namely variational graph autoencoders as a deep generative model of utmost accuracy,
the practical implementation of which19 was presented only a few months ago (just like the relevant network data). Note that
only this recent implementation enables to process networks of sizes in the range of common molecular interaction data. In
essence, graph neural networks “learn” the structure of links in networks, and infer rules that underlie the interplay of links.
Based on the knowledge gained, they enable to predict links and output the corresponding links together with probabilities for
them to indeed be missing.
Simulation experiments, reflecting scenarios where links known to exist in our network were re-established by prediction
upon their removal, pointed out that our pipeline does indeed predict missing links at utmost accuracy.
Encouraged by these simulations, we proceeded by performing the core experiments, and predicted links to be missing
without prior removal of links in our encompassing network. These core experiments revealed 692 high confidence interactions
relating to 92 drugs. In our experiments, we focused on predicting links between drugs and human proteins that in turn are
known to interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins (SARS-CoV-2 associated host proteins). We have decidedly put the focus not on
drug - SARS-CoV-2-protein interactions, which would have reflected more direct therapy strategies against the virus. Instead,
we have focused on predicting drugs that serve the purposes of host-directed therapy (HDT) options, because HDT strategies
have proven to be more sustainable with respect to mutations by which the virus escapes a response to the therapy applied.
Note that HDT strategies particularly cater to drug repurposing attempts, because repurposed drugs have already proven to lack
severe side effects, because they are either already in use, or have successfully passed the preclinical trial stages.
We further systematically categorized the 92 repurposable drugs into 70 categories based on their domains of application
and molecular mechanism. According to this, we identified and highlighted several drugs that target host proteins that the
virus needs to enter (and subsequently hijack) human cells. One such example is Captopril, which directly inhibits the
production of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE-2), in turn already known to be a crucial host factor for SARS-CoV-2.
Further, we identified Primaquine, as an antimalaria drug used to prevent the Malaria and also Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP)
relapses, because it interacts with the TIM complex TIMM29 and ALG11. Moreover, we have highlighted drugs that act
as DNA replication inhibitor (Niclosamide, Anisomycin), glucocorticoid receptor agonists (Medrysone), ATPase inhibitors
(Digitoxigenin, Digoxin), topoisomerase inhibitors (Camptothecin, Irinotecan), and proteosomal inhibitors (MG-132). Note that
some drugs are known to have rather severe side effects from their original use (Doxorubicin, Vinblastine), but the disrupting
effects of their short-term usage in severe COVID-19 infections may mean sufficient compensation.
In summary, we have compiled a list of drugs, which when repurposed are of great potential in the fight against the
COVID-19 pandemic, where therapy options are urgently needed. Our list of predicted drugs suggests both options that had
been identified and thoroughly discussed before and new opportunities that had not been pointed out earlier. The latter class of
drugs may offer valuable chances for pursuing new therapy strategies against COVID-19.

Materials and Methods
Dataset Preparation
We have utilized three categories of interaction datasets: human protein-protein interactome data, SARS-CoV-2-host protein
interaction data, and drug-host interaction data.
SARS-CoV-2-host Interaction Data

We have taken SARS-CoV-2–host interaction information from two recent studies by Gordon et al and Dick et al15, 16 . In15 ,
332 high confidence interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and human proteins are predicted using using affinity-purification mass
spectrometry (AP-MS). In16 , 261 high confidence interactions are identified using sequence-based PPI predictors (PIPE4 &
SPRINT).
Drug-Host Interactome Data

The drug–target interaction information has been collected from five databases, viz., DrugBank database (v4.3)57 , ChEMBL58
database, Therapeutic Target Database (TTD)59 , PharmGKB database, and IUPHAR/BPS Guide to PHARMACOLOGY60 .
Total number of drugs and drug-host interactions used in this study are 1309 and 1788407, respectively.
The Human Protein–Protein Interactome

We have built a comprehensive list of human PPIs from two datasets: (1) CCSB human Interactome database consisting of
7,000 genes, and 13944 high-quality binary interactions61–63 , (2) The Human Protein Reference Database56 which consists of
8920 proteins and 53184 PPIs.

14/19

The summary of all the datasets is provided in Table 2. CMAP database22 is used to annotate the drugs with their usage
different disease areas.
Sampling Strategy and Feature Matrix Generation
We have utilized Node2vec17 , an algorithmic framework for learning continuous feature representations for nodes in networks.
It maps the nodes to a low-dimensional feature space that maximizes the likelihood of preserving network neighborhoods.
The principle of feature learning framework in a graph can be described as follows: Let G = (V, E) be a given graph, where
V represents a set of nodes, and E represents the set of edges. The feature representation of nodes (|V |) is given by a mapping
function: f : V → Rd , where d specify the feature dimension. The f may also be represented as a node feature matrix of
dimension of |V | × d. For each node, v ∈ V , NNS (v) ⊂ V defines a network neighborhood of node v which is generated using a
neighbourhood sampling strategy S. The sampling strategy can be described as an interpolation between breadth-first search
and depth-first search technique17 . The objective function can be described as:
!
max
f

∑ log P(NNS (v)| f (v))

,

(1)

v∈V

This maximizes the likelihood of observing a network neighborhood NNS (v) for a node v given on its feature representation f .
Now the probability of observing a neighborhood node ni ∈ NNS (v) given the feature representation of the source node v is
given as :
P(NNS (v)| f (v)) =

∏

P(ni | f (v)).

(2)

ni ∈NNS (v)

where, ni is the ith neighbor of node v in neighborhood set NNS (v). The conditional likelihood of each source (v) and
neighborhood node (ni ∈ NNS (V )) pair is represented as softmax of dot product of their features f (v) and f (ni ) as follows:
P(ni | f (v)) =

exp( f (v). f (ni ))
∑u∈V exp( f (u). f (v))

(3)

Variational Graph Auto Encoder
Variational Graph Autoencoder (VGAE) is a framework for unsupervised learning on graph-structured data64 . This model uses
latent variables and is effective in learning interpretable latent representations for undirected graphs. The graph autoencoder
consists of two stacked models: 1) Encoder and 2) Decoder. First, an encoder based on graph convolution networks (GCN)18
maps the nodes into a low-dimensional embedding space. Subsequently, a decoder attempts to reconstruct the original graph
structure from the encoder representations. Both models are jointly trained to optimize the quality of the reconstruction from
the embedding space, in an unsupervised way. The functions of these two model can be described as follows:
It uses Graph Convolution Network (GCN) on adjacency matrix A and the feature representation matrix F. Encoder
generates a d 0 -dimensional latent variable zi for each node i ∈ V , with |V | = n, that corresponds to each embedding node, with
d 0 ≤ n. The inference model of the encoder is given below:
Encoder:

|v|

r(Z|A, F) = ∏ r(zi |A, F),

(4)

i=1

where, r(zi |A, F) corresponds to normal distribution, N ( µzii , σi2 ), µi and σi are the Gaussian mean and variance parameters.
The actual embedding vectors zi are samples drawn from these distributions.
Decoder: It is a generative model that decodes the latent variables zi to reconstruct the matrix A using inner products with
sigmoid activation from embedding vector, (Z).

bi, j = p(Ai, j = 1|zi , z j ) = Sigmoid(zTi .z j ),
A

(5)

b is the decoded adjacency matrix. The objective function of the variational graph autoencoder (VGAE) can be written
where, A
as:
CV GAE = Er(Z|A,F) [log p(A|Z)] − DKL (r(Z|A, F)||p(Z))

(6)

The objective function CV GAE maximizes the likelihood of decoding the adjacency matrix w.r.t graph autoencoder weights
using stochastic gradient decent. Here, DKL (.||.) represents Kullback-Leibler divergence65 and p(Z) is the prior distribution of
latent variable.

Drug–SARS-CoV-2 Link Prediction
1. Adjacency Matrix Preparation In this work, we consider an undirected graph G = (V, E) with |V | = n nodes and
|E| = m edges. We denote A as the binary adjacency matrix of G. Here V consists of SARS-Cov-2 proteins, CoV-host
proteins, drug-target proteins and drugs. The matrix (A) contains a total of n = 16444 nodes given as:
n = |NNc | + |NDT | + |NNT | + |ND |,

(7)

where, NNc is the number of SARS-CoV-2 proteins. NDT is the number of drug targets, whereas NNT and ND represent
the number of CoV-host and drugs nodes, respectively. Total number of edges is given by:
m = |E1 | + |E2 | + |E3 |,

(8)

where, E1 represents interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and human host proteins, E2 is the number of interactions among
human proteins, and E3 represents the number of interactions between drugs and human host proteins.
2. Feature Matrix Preparation: The neighborhood sampling strategy is used here to prepare a feature representation of
all nodes. A flexible biased random walk procedure is employed to explore the neighborhood of each node. A random
walk in a graph G can be described as the probability:
P(ai = x|ai−1 = v) = π(v, x),

(9)

where, π(v, x) is the transition probability between nodes v and x, where (v, x) ∈ E and ai is the ith node in the walk of
length l. The transition probability is given by π(v, x) = c pq (t, x) ∗ wvx , where t is the previous node of v n the walk, wvx
is the static edge weights and p, q are the two parameters which guides the walk. The coefficient c pq (t, x) is given by


1/p distance(t,x) = 0
c pq (t, x) = 1
(10)
distance(t,x) = 1


1/q distance(t,x) = 2
where, distance(t, x) represents the shortest path distance between nodes t and node x. The process of feature matrix
Fn×d generation is governed by the Node2vec algorithm. It starts from every nodes and simulates r random walks of fixed
length l. In every step of walk transition probability π(v, x) govern the sampling. The generated walk of each iteration
is included to a walk-list. Finally, the stochastic gradient descent is applied to optimize the list of walks and result is
returned.
3. Link Prediction: Scalable and Fast variational graph autoencoder (FastVGAE)19 is utilized in our proposed work to
reduce the computational time of VGAE in large network. The adjacency matrix A and the feature matrix F are given
into the encoder of FastVGAE. The encoder uses graph convolution neural network (GCN) on the entire graph to create
the latent representation (Z).
Z = GCN(A, F)

(11)

The encoder works on full Adjacency Matrix A. After encoding, sampling is done and decoder works on the sampled sub
graph.
b
The mechanism of decoder of FastVGAE is slightly different from traditional VGAE. It regenerate the adjacency matrix A
based on a subsample of graph nodes, Vs . It uses a graph node sampling technique to randomly sample the reconstructed
nodes at each iteration. Each node is assigned with a probability pi and the selection of noes is based on the high score of
pi . The probability pi is given by the following equation:
p(i) =

f (i)α
,
∑ j∈V f ( j)α

(12)

where, f (i) is the degree of node i, and α is the sharpening parameter. We take α = 2 in our study. The node selection
process is repeated until |Vs | = ns , where ns is the number of sampling nodes.
bs of dimension ns × ns instead of decoding the main adjacency matrix A.
The decoder reconstructs the smaller matrix, A
The decoder function follows the following equation:
bs (i, j) = Sigmoid(zTi .z j ), ∀(i, j) ∈ Vs ×Vs .
A

(13)
16/19

At each training iteration different subgraph (Gs ) is drawn using the sampling method.
After the model is trained the drug–CoV-host links are predicted using the following equation:
p(Ai j = 1|zi , z j ) = Sigmoid(zTi , z j ),

(14)

where Ai j represents the possible links between all combination of SARS-CoV-2 nodes and drug nodes. For each
combination of nodes the model gives probability based on the logistic sigmoid function.
