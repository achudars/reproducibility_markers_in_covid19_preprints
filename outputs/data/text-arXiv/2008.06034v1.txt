Abstract
The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 remains an extant threat against public health on a global scale. Cell infection
begins when the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds with the cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
(ACE2). Here, we address the role of Tetracycline as an inhibitor for the receptor-binding domain (RBD)
of the spike protein. Targeted molecular investigation show that Tetracycline binds more favorably to the
RBD (-9.40 kcal/mol) compared to Chloroquine (-6.31 kcal/mol) or Doxycycline (-8.08 kcal/mol) and inhibits
attachment to ACE2 to a greater degree (binding efficiency of 2.98 molkcal
for Tetracycline-RBD, 5.59

for Chloroquine-RBD, 5.16 mol·nm2 for Doxycycline-RBD). Stronger Tetracycline inhibition is
mol·nm2
verified with nonequilibrium PMF calculations, for which the Tetracycline-RBD complex exhibits the lowest
free energy profile along the dissociation pathway from ACE2. Tetracycline appears to target viral residues
that are usually involved in significant hydrogen bonding with ACE2; this inhibition of cellular infection
complements the anti-inflammatory and cytokine suppressing capability of Tetracycline, and may further
reduce the duration of ICU stays and mechanical ventilation induced by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction

Tetracycline in inhibiting the binding of the SARSCoV 2 spike protein to ACE2. Tetracycline is found
to bind more favorably to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein compared to Doxycycline or Chloroquine, which was included in this
study as a baseline. The Tetracycline-RBD complex
also displays lower binding efficiency to the human
cell receptor ACE2.

The extreme urgency for therapeutics against the
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) drives the review of existing drugs for their
ability to inhibit the function of this virus 1;2 .
Tetracycline has been proposed as a strong candidate against SARS-CoV-2 3 due to its lipophilic
nature, anti-inflammatory response, as well as its
ability to chelate zinc species on matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Tetracycline class antibiotics have
also been shown to be effective in reducing the duration of ventilatory support and ICU stay from acute
respiratory distress syndrome 5 , and Doxycycline
has been suggested to be an important component
in combination therapy for its anti-viral properties 6 .
Tetracycline as well as a broad band of related antibiotics have been approved by the FDA 4;7 .
In this work, we quantify the performance of

Methods

The SARS-CoV 2 RBD, ACE2, Tetracycline,
and Chloroquine molecular structures were obtained from RCSB PDB (6M0J, 2UXO, 4V2O,
2XRL) 14;15;16;17 . Missing hydrogen atoms were appended, after which structural preparation and
molecular docking with full ligand and protein
backbone flexibility were carried out using the
Rosetta suite 18;19;20 . The resulting complexes were
inspected manually, after which the binding affinities of the best-scoring complexes were gauged us-

molecular dynamics simulations 21;22;23 . The potentials of mean force (PMF) 24 along the dissociation
pathway of these RBD complexes from ACE2 were
found in LAMMPS 25 using steered molecular dynamics after parameterization with CHARMM 26 .
Jarzynski’s equality was employed to calculate the
free energy profile for each RBD complex from 10
statistically independent trajectories 27 .

Results and Discussion

Tetracycline exhibits higher binding affinity to the
RBD in both blind and site-specific docking (9.40 kcal/mol) compared to Doxycycline (-8.08
kcal/mol) or Chloroquine (-6.63 vs 6.31 kcal/mol)
as delineated in Table 1. The amino acid residues
of the RBD involved in hydrogen bonding with
the Tetracycline molecule are Tyr 449, Asn 501, Gly
496, and Tyr 505 (Fig. 1), which have been shown
to be crucial for the SARS-CoV 2 RBD in binding
to ACE2 for cellular access 8 . These four residues
comprise major hot spots that form persistent hydrogen bonds with ACE2. Meanwhile, the amino
acids of RBD that interact with Chloroquine in the
site-specific configuration are Lys 356, Arg 454, Arg
466 and Arg 355, of which none are involved in
extended hydrogen bonding with ACE2.
Tetracyline appears to bind preferably to polar
or slightly lipophilic RBD residues, which comprise the majority of amino acids that form persistent hydrogen bonds with ACE2 8;9 . Other tetracycline derivatives as Doxycycline or Minocycline are
known to be more lipophilic 3;4;9 and may therefore
prefer nonpolar residues 10 that are often buried beneath the solvent accessible surface area of the spike
protein. Indeed, the RBD residues that have highest
binding affinity to Doxycycline are Tyr 449, Gly 447,
Val 445, Gly 496, of which only two overlap with
RBD amino acids that engage in extended hydrogen bonding with ACE2. On the other end of the
spectrum, Chloroquine targets clusters of charged
residues on the RBD that do not actively participate
in hydrogen bonding with the cell receptor ACE2.
The binding efficiency 13 (magnitude of binding
energy normalized by contact interface area) of
the SARS-CoV2 RBD-ACE2 complex was found
to be 7.58 kcal/(mol·nm2 ). In the presence of the

also been shown to form persistent hydrogen bonds
in maintaining the RBD-ACE2 complex 8 .

protein-ligand complex Tetracycline-RBD, the binding efficiency with ACE2 (2.98 kcal/(mol·nm2 )) is
significantly lower than that for Chloroquine-RBD
(5.59 kcal/(mol·nm2 )) and Doxycycline-RBD (5.16
kcal/(mol·nm2 )) as displayed in Table 2. A survey
of hydrogen bonding lifetimes between the important binding site residues in the RBD with ACE2 8
shows that the Tetracycline inhibited RBD exhibits
the least hydrogen bonding activity with ACE2 (Fig.
2). This suggests that not only does Tetracycline
bind more favorably to the receptor binding domain
of the spike protein, it also inhibits the binding of
the RBD to ACE2 to a greater degree.
To verify this statement, steered molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to find the
potential of mean force (PMF) along a singular dissociation pathway for the inhibited and uninhibited
RBD-ACE2 complexes. Figure 3 shows that the
PMF for unbinding of the Tetracycline-RBD complex from ACE2 was lowest of the three structures
tested, which is in agreement with the binding efficiencies found from equilibrium simulations. This
disruption of the RBD-ACE2 interface may therefore inhibit the signaling cascade initiated during
binding of the viral spike protein.

is lowest for the Tetracycline-RBD complex, indicating that Tetracycline is a more effective inhibitor.

Conclusion

The tetracycline class of antibiotics, including Tetracycline, Oxytetracycline, and Doxycycline may be
helpful in the fight against the coronavirus SARSCoV-2, due to its preferential association with the
important residues in the viral receptor binding
domain and the resulting strong inhibition of the
RBD-ACE2 complex. Further experimental studies
are recommended to validate how this reduction
of cellular infection complements or enhances the
anti-inflammatory and anti-viral properties of tetracyclines in their role as treatment for SARS-CoV-2.
