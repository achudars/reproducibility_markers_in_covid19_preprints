Abstract
We employed the log-periodic power law singularity (LPPLS) methodology to systematically
investigate the 2020 stock market crash in the U.S. equities sectors with different levels of total
market capitalizations through four major U.S. stock market indexes, including the Wilshire
5000 Total Market index, the S&P 500 index, the S&P MidCap 400 index, and the Russell 2000
index, representing the stocks overall, the large capitalization stocks, the middle capitalization
stocks and the small capitalization stocks, respectively. During the 2020 U.S. stock market crash,
all four indexes lost more than a third of their values within five weeks, while both the middle
capitalization stocks and the small capitalization stocks have suffered much greater losses than
the large capitalization stocks and stocks overall. Our results indicate that the price trajectories of
these four stock market indexes prior to the 2020 stock market crash have clearly featured the
obvious LPPLS bubble pattern and were indeed in a positive bubble regime. Contrary to the
popular belief that the COVID-19 led to the 2020 stock market crash, the 2020 U.S. stock market
crash was endogenous, stemming from the increasingly systemic instability of the stock market
itself. We also performed the complementary post-mortem analysis of the 2020 U.S. stock
market crash. Our analyses indicate that the probability density distributions of the critical time
for these four indexes are positively skewed; the 2020 U.S. stock market crash originated from a
bubble which began to form as early as September 2018; and the bubbles in stocks with different
levels of total market capitalizations have significantly different starting time profiles. This study
not only sheds new light on the making of the 2020 U.S. stock market crash but also creates a
novel pipeline for future real-time crash detection and mechanism dissection of any financial
market and/or economic index.

1. Introduction
Until February 2020, the stock markets in the United States have experienced a 11-year boom
period since the 2008 financial crisis, and the Wilshire 5000 Total Market index, widely accepted
as the benchmark for the entire U.S. stock market, has increased dramatically by 403.5% from
6,858.4 on March 9, 2009 to 34,533.9 on February 19, 2020. However, starting on February 20,
2020, the U.S. stock market regime has suffered a sharp reversal from an upward trend to a
downward trend. The Wilshire 5000 Total Market index dropped around 12,068.8 points in the
next five weeks, which was a fall of 34.9 percent – its worst percentage loss in approximately
one month since the Great Recession in 2008. During this crash, the S&P 500 index, one of the
most followed stock indexes, dropped from 3,386.1 on February 19, 2020 to 2,237.4 on March
23, 2020, losing 33.9% of its value. The sharp drop of the S&P 500 index repeatedly triggered
the level-1 trading curbs and caused major U.S. stock markets to suspend trading for 15 minutes
on 3/9/2020, 3/12/2020, 3/16/2020, and 3/18/2020, respectively. Given that in the past 33 years,
the trading curb has been triggered only once before on October 27, 1997, the consecutive four
times triggering within 10 days are both historical and nerve wracking.
The 2020 U.S. Stock market Crash have greatly affected the lives and livelihoods of many
people throughout the country, and caused permanent damage to the wealth of many investors,
especially investors with little experience in risk management. During the crisis, the U.S.
unemployment rate has quadrupled in just two months from 3.5% in February 2020 to 14.7% in
April 2020 (FRED, 2020c).The total nonfarm payroll, which is a measure of the number of U.S.
workers in the economy excluding proprietors, private household employees, unpaid volunteers,
farm employees, and the unincorporated self-employed, and accounts for approximately 80
percent of the workers who contribute to GDP, dropped sharply from 152.463 million on
February 2020 to 130.303 million on April 2020 (FRED, 2020b). Further, the yield of the US 10year Treasury bond, one of the most popular debt instrument in the world and widely recognized
as the lowest-risk investment because it is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States,
fell sharply by 65.4% within three weeks from 1.56% on February 19, 2020 to 0.54% on March
9, 2020, its lowest close in history (FRED, 2020a). In order to stabilize the financial system and
prevent the intensification of economic recession, the Federal Reserve, being the “lender of last
resort”, took the decisive action to rapidly reduce the target range of the federal funds rate to near
zero. It has not only revived the Quantitative Easing (QE) program, but also expanded the QE
purchases to an unlimited amount to support the flow of credit and hence bolster the economy
(FED, 2020).
So far, the prevalent view is that the 2020 stock market crash was mainly caused by external
shocks. The fiction is that the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 since January
2020 and the subsequent lockdowns have caused the crash (Albuquerque et al., 2020), and
therefore; the 2020 Stock Market Crash is also called the Great Coronavirus Crash (Coy, 2020).
In addition to the COVID-19 pandemic, the mammoth nonfinancial corporate debt bulge (Lynch,
2020) and the 2020 Russia–Saudi Arabia oil price war (Guardian, 2020) are also thought to have
triggered the 2020 stock market crash.
In this research, we employed the Log Periodic Power Law Singularity (LPPLS) model (Drozdz
et al., 1999; Feigenbaum & Freund, 1996; Johansen et al., 2000; Johansen et al., 1999; Sornette
2

& Johansen, 2001; Sornette et al., 1996) to systematically analyze the 2020 stock market crash in
the United States. A fusion of statistical physics, financial economics, and behavioral finance,
the LPPLS model syndicates the mathematical and statistical physics of bifurcations and phase
transitions, the economic theory of rational expectations, and behavioral finance of herding of
traders to model a positive (or negative) financial bubbles as a process of unsustainably fasterthan-exponential growth (or drop) to reach an infinite return in finite time, leading to a shortterm correction molded by the symmetry of discrete scale invariance (Sornette, 1998). In the
LPPLS model, there are two types of agents: the rational traders who trade based on rational
expectations, and the noise traders who are prone to exhibit imitation and herding behavior.
Given that asset prices can be destabilized by the collective behavior of noise traders through the
massive herding and imitation transactions, the LPPLS model diagnose financial bubbles by
capturing two distinct characteristics of price trajectories normally observed in bubble regimes:
the faster-than-exponential growth caused by positive feedbacks by imitation and herding
behavior of noise traders, and the accelerating log-periodic volatility fluctuations of the price
growth due to expectations of higher returns and an upcoming crash.
The LPPLS model has become an increasingly recognized tool to diagnose speculative bubbles
based on its characteristic patterns embedded in asset price trajectories. A quick review of its
recent history ensues. Filimonov and Sornette (2013) simplified its calibration by transforming
the traditional LPPLS formula reducing the nonlinear parameters from four to three. Sornette et
al. (2015) proposed the LPPLS Confidence indicator and Trust indicator to qualify the sensitivity
of the observed bubble pattern. Filimonov et al. (2017) calibrated the LPPLS model via the
adjusted profile likelihood. Demos and Sornette (2017) quantified the uncertainty of the
calibrated bubble start and end times using the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix. Demirer et al.
(2019) presented the LPPLS confidence multi-scale indicators to study the predictive power of
market-based indicators. Shu and Zhu (2020b) proposed an adaptive multilevel time series
detection methodology to detect the real-time status of financial bubbles and crashes. In addition,
the LPPLS model has been broadly deployed to diagnose speculative bubbles and crashes in
various financial markets including the stock market (Demirer et al., 2019; Demos & Sornette,
2017; Filimonov et al., 2017; Jiang et al., 2010; Li, 2017; Shu, 2019; Shu & Zhu, 2019, 2020a;
Song et al., 2021; Sornette et al., 2015; Yan et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2016), the cryptocurrency
market (Gerlach et al., 2019; Shu & Zhu, 2020b), the real estate market (Zhou & Sornette, 2003,
2006, 2008), and the energy market (Sornette et al., 2009; Zhang & Yao, 2016). It should be
pointed out that the LPPLS model can only diagnose endogenous bubbles where the changes in
price trajectories are caused by the self-reinforcing synergistic herding and imitative behaviors
through interactions of market participants in the long-memory process of endogenous
organizations. A crash observed but not deteced by the LPPLS model is likely an exogenous (or
external) crash caused by changes of fundamental values of assets resulting from exogenous
shocks. For exogenous crashes, the price trajectories would not present the two distinct
characteristics of endogenous bubbles, that is, the faster-than-exponential growth and the
accelerating log-periodic volatility fluctuations of the price growth when approaching to finite
time singularity.
In order to investigate the 2020 stock market crash in U.S. equities sectors with different levels
of total market capitalization, we used four major U.S. stock market indexes, including the
Wilshire 5000 Total Market (W5000) index, the S&P 500 (SP500) index, the S&P MidCap 400
3

(SP400) index, and the Russell 2000 (R2000) index. The W5000 index measures the overall
performance of most publicly traded U.S. headquartered equities and is widely accepted as the
definitive benchmark for the market value of all stocks actively traded in the United States. The
SP500 index, maintained by the S&P Dow Jones Indices, measures the stock performance of 500
large capitalization stocks listed on the U.S. stock exchanges and is the most commonly tracked
stock index. The SP400 index, also maintained by the S&P Dow Jones Indices, is the most
followed benchmarks for middle capitalization stocks. The R2000 index, maintained by the
FTSE Russell, measures the performance of the smallest 2,000 stocks in the Russell 3000 Index
and serves as a barometer for the small capitalization stocks. These four indexes are all marketcapitalization-weighted stock market indexes. Figure 1 shows the evolution of their price
trajectories from January 2015 to December 2020.
In this study, we detected the positive and negative bubbles in the U.S. stock market based on the
LPPLS model using the daily data of the W5000, SP500, SP400, and R2000 indexes from
January 2019 through December 2020 to investigate the 2020 U.S. stock market crash. This
study also presented a complementary post-mortem analysis on the nature of the crash. This
paper is laid out as the following: Section 2 presents the methodology used including the LPPLS
model calibration and confidence indicator. Section 3 discusses the empirical analysis and results;
finally, Section 4 recaps.

2. Methodology
2.1 The Log-Periodic Power Law Singularity (LPPLS) Model
The LPPLS model is also called the Johansen–Ledoit–Sornette (JLS) model or Log-Periodic
Power Law (LPPL) Model. Based on the assumption that the observed price trajectory of an asset
during a bubble period deviates from its intrinsic fundamental value (Kindleberger & Aliber, 2011;
Sornette, 2017), the LPPLS model combines two typical bubble features: the transient superexponential growth and the accelerating log-periodic volatility fluctuations, to model the price
trajectory in a bubble regime as a process of fast-than-exponential power law growth punctuated by
short-lived corrections. In its core the LPPLS model is a parametric method highly efficient in bubble
detections and can outperform machine learning algorithms that are less parametric and more data
driven – and hence less agile and sensitive when the data volume is modest, which is often the case
for financial times series analysis. The dynamics of the observed asset price 𝑝(𝑡) in the LPPLS
model is assumed to follow (Johansen et al., 2000):

dp
=  (t )dt +  (t )dW − kdj
p

(1)

where 𝜇(𝑡) is the time-dependent expected return, 𝜎(𝑡) is the volatility, 𝑑𝑊 is the infinitesimal
increment of a standard Wiener process, 𝑑𝑗 represents a discontinuous jump with the value of
𝑗=0 before and 𝑗=1 after the crash happens, while 𝑘 measures the amplitude of a potential crash.
The crash hazard rate ℎ(𝑡) quantifying the crash probability at a specified time 𝑡 controls
dynamics of the jumps. The expected value of 𝑑𝑗 between 𝑡 and 𝑡 + 𝑑𝑡 on the condition that no
jump has yet happened can be determined as 𝐸[𝑑𝑗] = ℎ(𝑡)d𝑡. The LPPLS model reflects the
joint action of two types of agents: (a) rational traders with rational expectations and, (b) noise
traders who are susceptible to exhibit herding behavior and imitation, thereby making irrational
decisions of buying, selling or holding. On the assumption that the asset prices can be
destabilized by the collective behavior of noise traders, the aggregate effect of noise traders can
be determined by the dynamics of the crash hazard rate ℎ(𝑡) during the course a bubble
(Johansen et al., 2000):
ℎ(𝑡) = 𝛼(𝑡𝑐 − 𝑡)𝑚−1 (1 + 𝛽𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝜔 𝑙𝑛( 𝑡𝑐 − 𝑡) − 𝜙′))

(2)

where 𝛼, 𝛽, 𝜔, and 𝑡𝑐 are the model parameters. For a given time 𝑡, the crash risk is a sum of the
power law singularity 𝛼(𝑡𝑐 − 𝑡)𝑚−1 which embodies the positive feedback mechanism resulting
from the herding behaviors of the noise traders, decked by large scale amplitude periodic
oscillations in the logarithm of the time to the critical time 𝑡𝑐 . The log periodic function
cos (𝜔 ln(𝑡𝑐 − 𝑡) − 𝜙′) reflects a potential hierarchical cascade of panic acceleration leading to
punctuate the growth of price trajectories. The log-periodicity can be caused by the preexisting
hierarchy in noise trader sizes (Sornette & Johansen, 1997) and/or from the interplay between
market price impact inertia and nonlinear intrinsic fundamental value investing (Ide & Sornette,
2002).
Under the non-arbitrage and rational expectation conditions, the unconditional expectation
𝐸[𝑑𝑝]of the price increment should be zero, leading to:

5

µt
( )  E[

dp / dt
]no crash = kh(t )
p

(3)

thus, the expected return 𝜇(𝑡) is proportional to the crash hazard rate ℎ(𝑡), so that the higher the
crash risk, the higher the expected return, and vice versa. If no crash has yet occurred in a bubble
regime, the simple mathematical formula of the LPPLS for the expected trajectory of the logprice can be derived by solving Equations (1), (2) and (3) simultaneously (Sornette, 2003):
LPPLS(𝑡) ≡ 𝑙𝑛 𝐸 [𝑝(𝑡)] = 𝐴 + 𝐵(𝑡𝑐 − 𝑡)𝑚 + 𝐶(𝑡𝑐 − 𝑡)𝑚 𝑐𝑜𝑠[ 𝜔 𝑙𝑛( 𝑡𝑐 − 𝑡) − 𝜙] (4)
where 𝐵 = −𝑘𝛼/𝑚 and 𝐶 = −𝑘𝛼𝛽/√𝑚2 + 𝜔 2 . The term 𝐶 𝑐𝑜𝑠[. ] can be extended with two
linear parameters 𝐶1 = 𝐶𝑐𝑜𝑠𝜙 and 𝐶2 = 𝐶𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜙 to replace the linear parameter 𝐶 and the
nonlinear parameter 𝜙.Then the simple mathematical formula of the LPPLS in Equation (4) can
be rephrased as (Filimonov & Sornette, 2013):
LPPLS(𝑡) ≡ 𝐸𝑡 [ln 𝑝(𝑡)] = 𝐴 + 𝐵(𝑡𝑐 − 𝑡)𝑚 + 𝐶1 (𝑡𝑐 − 𝑡)𝑚 cos[𝜔 𝑙𝑛(𝑡𝑐 − 𝑡)]
+𝐶2 (𝑡𝑐 − 𝑡)𝑚 sin[𝜔 𝑙𝑛(𝑡𝑐 − 𝑡)]

(5)

where 𝐴 > 0 is the expected value of the log-price at the critical time 𝑡𝑐 . In a bubble regime, the
power parameter 𝑚 ranges between 0 and 1 to ensure that not only the price remains finite at the
𝑡𝑐 , but also the expected logarithmic price diverges at the 𝑡𝑐 . The critical time 𝑡𝑐 is the most
probable time for the asset price trajectory to undergo a regime change in a form of a major crash
or a great change of growth rate with terminating the accelerated oscillations.

2.2 Model Calibration and LPPLS Confidence Indicator
The Ordinary Least Squares method is used to calibrate the LPPLS model and estimate the thee
nonlinear parameters {t c , 𝑚, 𝜔} and the four linear parameters {𝐴, 𝐵, 𝐶1 , 𝐶2 }. Based on the 𝐿2
norm, the sum of squares of residuals of the converted LPPLS formula in Equation (5) can be
written as:
N

F (tc , m, , A, B, C1 , C2 ) = [ln p( i ) − A − B(tc −  i ) m − C1 (tc −  i ) m cos( ln(tc −  i ))
i =1

(6)

− C2 (tc −  i ) sin( ln(tc −  i ))]
m

2

where 𝜏1 = 𝑡1 and 𝜏𝑁 = 𝑡2 . Subordinating the four linear parameters (𝐴, 𝐵, 𝐶1 , 𝐶2 ) to the three
nonlinear parameters (𝑡𝑐 , 𝑚, 𝜔), we can determine the cost function 𝜒 2 ( 𝑡𝑐 , 𝑚, 𝜔):

 2 (tc , m,  ) = F1 (tc , m,  ) = min F (tc , m, , A, B, C1 , C2 ) = F (tc , m, , Aˆ , Bˆ , Cˆ1, Cˆ 2 ) (7)
{ A, B ,C ,C }
1

2

where the hat symbol ^ indicates the estimated parameters. The three nonlinear parameters
{ 𝑡𝑐 , 𝑚, 𝜔} can be estimated by solving the nonlinear optimization equation:

6

{𝑡̂c , 𝑚
̂, 𝜔
̂} = 𝑎𝑟𝑔 min 𝐹1 (𝑡c , 𝑚, 𝜔)

(8)

{𝑡𝑐 ,𝑚,𝜔}

The four linear parameters (𝐴, 𝐵, 𝐶1 , 𝐶2 ) can be obtained by solving the following optimization
equation:
(𝐴̂, 𝐵̂, 𝐶̂1 , 𝐶̂2 ) = 𝑎𝑟𝑔

min

(𝐴,𝐵, 𝐶1 ,𝐶2)

𝐹(𝑡𝑐 , 𝑚, 𝜔, 𝐴, 𝐵, 𝐶1 , 𝐶2 )

Equation (9) can be solved analytically through the matrix equations:

where 𝑓𝑖 = (𝑡𝑐 − 𝑡𝑖 )𝑚 , 𝑔𝑖 = (𝑡𝑐 − 𝑡𝑖 )𝑚 𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝜔 ln(𝑡𝑐 − 𝑡𝑖 )), and ℎ𝑖 = (𝑡𝑐 − 𝑡𝑖 )𝑚 𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝜔 ln(𝑡𝑐 −
𝑡𝑖 )).
Here the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) developed by Hansen et al.
(1995) was employed towards the optimization. The three nonlinear parameters (𝑡𝑐 , 𝑚, 𝜔) can be
estimated by minimizing the sum of residuals between the fitted LPPLS model and the observed
price trajectory. To minimize calibration problems of the LPPL model, the search space is set to
(Shu & Zhu, 2020b):
𝑚 ∈ [0,1], 𝜔 ∈ [1, 50], 𝑡𝑐 ∈ [𝑡2 , 𝑡2 +

𝑡2 −𝑡1
3

],

𝑚|𝐵|

𝜔√𝐶21 +𝐶22

≥1

(11)

The condition 𝑡c ∈ [𝑡2 , 𝑡2 + (𝑡2 − 𝑡1 )/3] ensures that the fitted critical time 𝑡c falls beyond the
endpoint 𝑡2 , but adjacent to the 𝑡2 since the LPPLS model has a degraded predictive capacity far
beyond 𝑡2 (Jiang et al., 2010). Here, the Damping parameter 𝑚|𝐵|/ (𝜔√𝐶1 2 +𝐶2 2 ) ≥ 1 because
the crash hazard rate ℎ(𝑡) is defined as a non-negative value (Bothmer & Meister, 2003).
Furthermore, to select the valid calibration results and ensure model rigorousness (Brée et al.,
2013; Sornette et al., 2013), the fitted LPPLS model results are filtered under the conditions:
𝑡2 − 𝑡1 𝜔
𝑡𝑐 − 𝑡1

𝑡𝑐 − 𝑡2

|𝑝
̂−𝑝
𝑡
𝑡|

max (

𝑝𝑡

) ≤ 0.20, 𝑝𝑙𝑜𝑚𝑏

(12)

These filters conditions are derived from empirical evidence gathered in previous investigations
on financial bubbles (Jiang et al., 2010; Sornette et al., 2015). The (𝜔/𝜋)ln[(𝑡𝑐 − 𝑡1 )/(𝑡c −
𝑡2 )] ≥ 2.5 condition is employed to distinguish between genuine log-periodic signals and noisegenerated signals (Huang et al., 2000). The max(|𝑝̂𝑡 − 𝑝𝑡 |/𝑝𝑡 ) ≤ 0.20 condition ensures that the
7

calibrated price 𝑝̂𝑡 is close to the actual asset price 𝑝𝑡 (Shu & Zhu, 2020b). The 𝑃𝑙𝑜𝑚𝑏 ≤ 𝛼𝑠𝑖𝑔
condition applies the Lomb spectral analysis to the time series of the detrended residuals 𝑟(𝑡) =
(𝑡𝑐 − 𝑡)−𝑚 (ln[𝑝(𝑡)] − 𝐴 − 𝐵(𝑡𝑐 − 𝑡)𝑚 ) to ensure the existence the logarithm-periodic
oscillations in the fitted model (Sornette & Zhou, 2002). The ln(𝑝̂𝑡 ) − ln (𝑝𝑡 )~AR(1) condition
ensures that the logarithmic price in a bubble stage is due to a deterministic LPPLS component,
the LPPLS fitting residuals can be constructed through the mean-reversal Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
(O-U) process (Lin et al., 2014). Only calibration results meeting the filter constrains in Equation
(12) are considered valid, while the remaining results are deemed superfluous.
To measure the sensitivity of the calibration results with respect to the selection of the start time
𝑡1 for the fitting windows, the LPPLS confidence indicator proposed by Sornette et al. (2015) is
utilized. It is defined as the proportion of the fitting windows for the calibrated LPPLS model
that meets the specified filter conditions. Larger LPPLS confidence indicator means more fitting
windows have the detected bubble pattern of the LPPLS model, and hence more reliable
implication of price trajectories in a bubble phrase. In contrast, the smaller LPPLS confidence
indicator means the less fitting windows would present the LPPLS bubble pattern, and therefore
more fragility of the bubble signals.
For a given fictitious “present” data point 𝑡2 , the LPPLS confidence indicator is calculated in the
following steps: (i) create a series of fitting time windows by moving the start time 𝑡1 toward the
𝑡2 with a step of 𝑑𝑡, (ii) calibrate the model within the given search space for each fitting time
window, count the number of fitting time windows that meets the specified filter constrains, and
(iii) divide this number by the total number of the fitting windows. The LPPLS confidence
indicator is causal because only data prior to 𝑡2 are used in the calculation of the LPPLS
confidence indicator.

3. Empirical analysis
3.1 LPPLS bubble identification
In this section, we adopted the LPPLS confidence indicator as a diagnostic tool to detect both
positive and negative bubbles in the U.S. stock markets based on the daily data of the W5000,
SP500, SP400, and R2000 indexes from January 2, 2019 to December 15, 2020. Data on stock
market indexes came from Yahoo Finance (https://finance.yahoo.com/). A positive bubble is
associated with the accelerating growth trend which is susceptible to changes of regime in the
form of large crashes or volatile sideway plateaus, while a negative bubble is related to the
accelerating downward trend which is vulnerable to regime changes in the form of rallies or
volatile sideway plateaus. In this study, the LPPLS confidence indicator is calculated by
shrinking the length of time windows 𝑡2 − 𝑡1 from 650 trading days to 30 trading days in steps of
5 trading days, and moving the endpoint 𝑡2 from January 2, 2019 to December 15, 2020.
Figure 2 shows the results of the LPPLS confidence indicator for these four US stock market
indexes, in which the positive bubbles is shown in red and negative bubbles in green (right scale)
along with the index price in blue (left scale). From Figure 2, we can perceive intuitively the
confidence level of the detected LPPLS bubble pattern in the price trajectories because the
8

confidence indicator measures the sensitivity of the fitting results with respect to the start time
selection. When the a substantial number of the calibrated results with different start time points
can pass the filter conditions in Equation (12), the value of the confidence indicator for a
specified pseudo-present time can reach a high enough value such as 10%, indicating that the
detected LPPLS signature is relatively robust to the selection of the start time, and therefore the
price trajectory can be confirmed in bubble regime. On the contrary, when most of the calibrated
results with different start time points fail to pass the filter conditions, the value of the
confidence indicator can be low close to zero, indicating that the detected LPPLS signature is
highly sensitive to the choice of the start times and there the price trajectory is unlikely to be in a
true bubble regime.
The detected bubble status of W5000 index is shown in Figure 2 (a), including four obvious
clusters of positive bubbles between December 13, 2019 and January 28, 2020, between
February 11 and March 4, 2020, between August 10 and September 4, 2020, and between
November 23 and December 15, 2020. There is also one subtle cluster of negative bubble
between March 26 and March 27, 2020. On February 20, 2020, the positive LPPLS confidence
indicator reached the global peak value of 11.2%, that is, 14 out of 125 fitting windows can
successfully pass the filter, indicating that the detected LPPLS bubble pattern is reliable and the
price trajectory of W5000 index can be confirmed in a positive bubble regime. There is a strong
possibility that the accelerated growth trend of the W5000 index is unsustainable, and the
positive bubble regime of the W5000 index is likely to change. The forecast of bubble regime
change was confirmed by the fact that the W5000 plunged dramatically from 34,533.9 on
February 19, 2020 to 22,465.1 on March 23, 2020, losing 34.9% of its value within 24 trading
days. During the 2020 U.S. stock market crash, similar detected positive bubble patterns shown
in Figure 2 (a) for the W5000 index can also be found in the remaining subfigures in Figure 2,
including: (b) SP500, (c) SP400, and (d) R2000. Furthermore, the negative LPPLS confidence
indicators for W5000 peaked at the value of 1.6% on March 27, 2020, for SP500 peaked at 1.6%
on March 26, 2020, for SP400 peaked at 0.8% on March 19, 2020, and for R2000 peaked at 1.6%
on March 24, 2020, respectively. The subtle clusters of negative LPPLS confidence indicators
for these four indexes indicate that there is no obvious negative LPPLS bubble pattern presented
in the price trajectories during the 2020 U.S. stock market crash.
The statistics of positive bubble detection results for these four stock market indexes during the
2020 U.S. stock market crash and the related information of the peaks and valleys are
summarized in Table 1. During the 2020 stock market crash, all four indexes lost more than a
third of their values within five weeks. The SP400 index has the largest crash size of 42.1%
dropping from 2,106.1 on February 20, 2020 to 1,218.6 on March 23, 2020, followed by the
R2000 index with a crash of 41.6% from 1,696.1 on February 20, 2020 to 991.2 on March 23,
2020, while the SP500 index has the smallest crash size of 33.9% dropping from 3,386.1 on
February 19, 2020 to 2,237.4 on March 23, 2020, indicating that both middle capitalization
stocks and small capitalization stocks have suffered much greater losses than the large
capitalization stocks. Table 1 lists the peak values of the LPPLS confidence indicator (CI) during
the 2020 U.S. stock market crash. The SP500 index has the largest peak CI value of 16.0%,
meaning that 20 out of 125 fitting windows can successfully meet the filter constrains and thus
strong LPPLS bubble signal has presented in the price trajectory of the SP500 index in the 2020
U.S. stock market crash. These four indexes have the peak confidence indicator values exceeding
9

6.4%, indicating that the price trajectories of these four stock market indexes clearly present the
LPPLS bubble pattern and are indeed in a positive bubble regime. Because the LPPLS model can
only detect the endogenous bubbles, the postive bubbles as well as the subsequent crashes in
these four indexes during the 2020 U.S. stock market crash are endogenous stemming from the
increasingly systemic instability of the stock market itself, while the well-known external shocks,
such as the COVID-19 pandemic-induced market instability, the mass hysteria, and the corporate
debt bubble, are not the root causes of the 2020 U.S. stock market crash, and they only served as
sparks during the 2020 stock market crash.

indexes based on daily data from January 2019 to December 2020.
3.2 Post-mortem analysis for the bubbles
This section presents the complementary post-mortem analysis to provide additional information
on the estimated LPPLS models for diagnosing the 2020 U.S. stock market crash. The calibrated
results that successfully pass the filter conditions in Equation (12) with endpoints falling in the
positive bubble clusters during the 2020 U.S. stock market crash were collected to perform the
post-mortem analysis on the four indexes: W5000, SP500, SP400, and R2000. In order to create
the probability density distribution of the predicted critical time 𝑡𝑐 and the start time points 𝑡1 ,
the Kernel density estimation (Davis et al., 2011; Parzen, 1962) are adopted in this study.
Figure 3 shows the probability density distribution of the predicted critical time 𝑡𝑐 ’s as well as
the estimated beginning time 𝑡1 ’s for the four U.S. stock market indexes during the 2020 U.S.
stock market crash. The optimal values for the bubble starting date 𝑡1 are represented by the
probability density distribution 𝑝𝑑𝑓(𝑡1 ) in green, while the forecasted critical time 𝑡𝑐 is depicted
by the probability density distribution 𝑝𝑑𝑓(𝑡𝑐 ) in red which can be viewed as the probability
measure of the time of crash. Three typical fitting examples with different time scale windows
are shown in Figure 3 for each index.
In particular, the results of the post-mortem analysis for the W5000 index is shown in Figure 3
(a). There are 99 calibrated results collected in the positive cluster during the 2020 U.S. stock
market crash. The ranges of the start time point 𝑡1 and the end time point 𝑡2 for the 99 selected
fitting windows are from September 20, 2018 to November 8, 2019 and from February 7, 2020
to March 4, 2020, respectively. It can be observed that the 𝑝𝑑𝑓(𝑡1 ) is concentrated on the time
frame when the W5000 index begins to super-exponentially increase and the beginning of the
W5000 index bubble can be determined as early as September 20, 2018. As shown in Figure 3
(a), the 20%/80% and 5%/95% quantile range of the crash dates 𝑡c for the W5000 index during
the 2020 U.S. stock market crash are from February 18, 2020 to March 27, 2020, and from
February 12, 2020 to May 13, 2020, respectively. The observed peak date for the W5000 index is
February 19, 2020, which lies within the quantile ranges of the predicted crash dates 𝑡c and the
𝑝𝑑𝑓(𝑡𝑐 ) is positively skewed with the peak value on February 20, 2020. Figure 3 (a) also
presents three typical fitting examples with a common endpoint 𝑡2 = February 14, 2020, and three
different sets of starting time: 𝑡1 = September 24, 2018, 𝑡1 = July 26, 2019, and 𝑡1 = October 28,
2019, --- corresponding to the long, middle and short time scale windows, respectively.
The post-mortem analysis results for the SP500, SP400 and R2000 indexes, are presented in
Figure 3 (b), (c) and (d), respectively. The 20%/80% quantile range of the crash dates 𝑡c for the
SP500, SP400 and R2000 indexes during the 2020 U.S. stock market crash are from February 18
to April 3, 2020, from January 21 to April 1, 2020, and from January 28 to February 26, 2020,
respectively. It should be noted that all four probability density distributions of the predicted
critical time 𝑡𝑐 are positively skewed and the mass of distributions are concentrated on the right
side of the figures. In addition, all four indexes have the minimum start time points 𝑡1 on
September 2018, indicating that the 2020 U.S. stock market crash originated from a bubble
12

which began to form as early as September 2018. Furthermore, the probability density
distributions of the start time point 𝑡1 can be seen not all equal for these four indexes. The
W5000 index has a similar 𝑝𝑑𝑓(𝑡1 ) shape as the SP500 index. However, the SP400 index and
R2000 index have the distinctly different 𝑝𝑑𝑓(𝑡1 ) shapes compared with the W5000 and SP500
indexes, signifying that the bubbles in stocks with different levels of total market capitalizations
may have significantly different starting time profiles.

4. Conclusions
We employed the LPPLS methodology in this study to systematically dissect the 2020 stock
market crash in the U.S. equities sectors with different levels of total market capitalizations
through four major U.S. stock market indexes, including the W5000, SP500, SP400 and R2000,
representing the stocks overall, the large capitalization stocks, the middle capitalization stocks
and the small capitalization stocks, respectively. During the 2020 U.S. stock market crash, all
four indexes lost more than a third of their values within five weeks, while both middle
capitalization stocks and small capitalization stocks have suffered much greater losses than the
large capitalization stocks and stocks overall. Our results indicate that the price trajectories of
these four stock market indexes prior to 2020 stock market crash have clearly featured the
obvious LPPLS bubble pattern of the faster-than-exponential growth corrected by the
accelerating logarithm-periodic oscillations and were indeed in a positive bubble regime.
Contrary to the popular belief that the COVID-19 pandemic-induced market instability led to the
2020 U.S. stock market crash, the crashes in these four indexes during the 2020 U.S. stock
market crash were endogenous stemming from the increasingly systemic instability of the stock
markets. The well-known external shocks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic-induced market

15

instability, the mass hysteria, and the corporate debt bubble, only served as sparks during the
2020 stock market crash, but they were not the root causes of the 2020 U.S. stock market crash.
From a historic point of view, between 1954 and 2009, the U.S. Stock market have gone through
many cycles of boom and bust with an average length of boom (expansion) period of 58 months,
2 months shy of 5 years, and the bust period averaged at 11 months. The longest boom before
2009 occurred between March 1991 and March 2001, lasting for a total of 10 years. This record
10-year boom is only eclipsed by the most recent 11-year boom from 2009 to 2020 until the
latter was interrupted by the COVID crash. Statistically, as confirmed by our LPPLS analysis,
the market was due to have a crash internally, and the COVID-19 pandemic only served as an
external trigger, hence the 2020 U.S. stock market crash might be more suitably referred to as the
‘COVID’ crash, rather than the Great COVID crash.
Furthermore, we also performed the complementary post-mortem analysis to further characterize
the estimated LPPLS models for detecting the 2020 U.S. stock market crash. The analyses
indicate that the probability density distributions of the predicted critical time for these four
indexes are positively skewed, and the 2020 U.S. stock market crash originates from a bubble
which began to form as early as September 2018. In addition, the SP400 index and R2000 index
have the distinctly different probability density distribution shapes compared to the W5000 and
SP500 indexes, indicating that the bubbles in stocks with different levels of total market
capitalizations may have significantly different starting time profiles.
This study not only provides a novel dissection of the 2020 stock market crash in the United
States, but also creates a paradigm for future studies in real-time crash detection and underlying
mechanism classification. It serves to warn us of the imminent risks in the stock market as well
as other financial markets and economic indexes.
