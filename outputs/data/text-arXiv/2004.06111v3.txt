Abstract
We provide an insight into the open data resources pertinent to the study of the spread of Covid-19
pandemic and its control. We identify the variables required to analyze fundamental aspects like seasonal
behaviour, regional mortality rates, and effectiveness of government measures. Open data resources, along
with data-driven methodologies, provide many opportunities to improve the response of the different
administrations to the virus. We describe the present limitations and difficulties encountered in most of
the open data resources. To facilitate the access to the main open data portals and resources, we identify
the most relevant institutions, at a world scale, providing Covid-19 information and/or auxiliary variables
(demographics, mobility, etc.). We also describe several open resources to access Covid-19 datasets at a
country-wide level (i.e., China, Italy, Spain, France, Germany, U.S., etc.). In an attempt to facilitate the
rapid response to the study of the seasonal behaviour of Covid-19, we enumerate the main open resources
in terms of weather and climate variables. We also assess the reusability of some representative open data
sources.

Introduction

We provide in this document a survey on the main open-resources for addressing the Covid-19 pandemic from
a data science point of view. Since the number of institutions and research teams working nowadays against
the virus is growing at a very fast pace, it is impossible to provide an exhaustive list of all the meaningful open
data providers. At a global world scope, we identify the most relevant sources. However, the enumeration
of the regional institutions providing local information is so extensive that we address it specifically only for
some countries (like China, Italy, Spain, and the U.S, among others). We focus on the variables that have
possible effects on the evolution and control of the disease at a global and regional scale [34]. That is, we
do not cover in this document the data specifically related to medical treatments, vaccines, etc. [36]. We
do provide open resources for the number of hospitalized cases, intensive care units (ICU) cases, number of
tests, etc. These variables are very relevant to monitor the evolution of the pandemic and also to evaluate
the actions taken by the decision-makers [34].
With this document, we try to make accessible many significant open data resources on Covid-19 for the
scientific community. In many situations, identifying adequate sources is difficult, especially for non-expert
data scientists. For example, GitHub repository contains many meaningful datasets of global and regional
scope, but it might be challenging to discover them without adequate guidance. Besides, the reliability of
the data source provider can be a concern. Therefore, this paper is aimed at providing a big picture of the
available data source providers for analyzing Covid-19 propagation and control. We have tried to find stable
and reliable resources so that the utility of this paper endures in time.
The paper is organized as follows. We first analyze in Section 2 the different variables that have a
significant effect on the evolution and control of the epidemic (demographics, mobility, weather conditions,
government measures, etc.). The opportunities that open data resources on Covid-19 offer to fight the
pandemic are highlighted, from a data-driven perspective, in Section 3. Different limitations and inaccuracies
of the currently available sources, along with the difficulties encountered when using them in a data-science
context are discussed in Section 4. The most relevant open data institutions at a global scale, addressing the
Covid-19 pandemic, are enumerated in Section 5. More functionally, in Section 6, we identify open source
communities that facilitate access to the required data. In Section 7, we identify open datasets related to
specific Covid-19 variables at a global and regional scale. The open access to auxiliary variables of interest
to model specific aspects of the pandemic, like seasonal behaviour or local mortality rate, is described in
Section 8. In Section 9, we discuss the reusability of the available datasets. Finally, a concluding Section 10
is included.

Covid-19

Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), technically known as SARS-CoV-2, is an infectious disease that was
first identified on December 31st 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of China’s Hubei province. The World Health
Organisation (WHO) declared the 201920 coronavirus outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International
Concern on January 30th 2020 and a pandemic on March 11th.
The virus is mainly spread during close contact and by small droplets produced when those infected cough,
sneeze or talk. These small droplets may also be produced during breathing. The virus is most contagious
during the first 4-6 days after onset of symptoms [18], although spread is possible in asymptomatic conditions
[5] and in later stages of the disease [18]. The time from exposure to onset of symptoms (incubation period)
is typically around 5 days but may range from 2 to 14 days [35]. Recommended measures to control the
pandemic include social distancing, mobility constraints, pro-active testing and isolation of detected cases
[28].

2.1

Covid-19 cases in the world

To monitor the spread of Covid-19, the different regional institutions are measuring the number of confirmed
cases, deaths, recovered, hospitalized cases, intensive care unit (ICU) cases, etc. Because of the incubation
period [35], all these variables are related with the number of infected cases in a delayed way. One of the main
objectives of those institutes is to estimate the basic reproductive number R0 , which serves to characterize
the spread of the virus [45]. Several works have calculated R0 for some outbreaks of specific locations. The
estimated values are ranging from 2 to 3 [38]. However, only limited data have been used in the majority
of works. On the other hand, achieving an accurate model of the virus reproduction is a challenging task,
4

which involves many variables and validation steps. Unfortunately, the open data sets available nowadays
are locally collected, imprecise with different criteria (lack of standardization on data collection), inconsistent
with data models, and incomplete.
One of the main limitations of these datasets is that often only cases confirmed by a laboratory test
are included. The standard method of diagnosis is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal swab. The infection can also be diagnosed from a combination of
symptoms, risk factors and a chest CT (computed tomography) scan showing features of pneumonia. Thus,
on a general basis, the infected cases without a positive laboratory test are not considered confirmed cases in
the time-series data available on the different open-source repositories. The same problem can be encountered
when analyzing death cases. In many situations, specially at the beginning of the outbreak, only the ones
that were previously confirmed infected by a laboratory test are included in these datasets.
Moreover, there are relevant variables that are not accurately measured. For example, the fraction of
infected non-asymptomatic cases in a given population can be only estimated by means of massive tests or
by effective contact-tracing methods. The massive tests carried out in small towns, for example in the north
of Italy, indicated that the fraction of asymptomatic cases in the population could be significant (comparable
or even larger than the symptomatic cases). Therefore, asymptomatic cases play an important role in virus
transmission [5]. Furthermore, important inaccuracies have been reported on the use of fast tests. It is an
important issue since their use can improve the detection of real cases.
The above limitations on the available datasets have to be taken into consideration in any data-driven
method to model or forecast the future spread of the pandemic.

2.2

Covid-19 mortality

Being able to predict the number of patients that will develop life-threatening symptoms is important since the
disease frequently requires hospitalisation and even ICU in the worst case, challenging the healthcare system
capacity [24]. One of the most important ways to measure the burden of Covid-19 is through mortality. The
probability of dying when getting infected depends on different factors [69], [54], [30]:
• Demographics [53]: age, gender, prevalence of diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, and other risk
factors [37].
• Health System [30]: availability of artificial respiration equipment, ICU, specialized medical surveillance
and treatments, etc.
On the one hand, several studies have reported a higher level of mortality for older people [53], even more
aggravated in men. Thus, protection strategies should be focused on more vulnerable age and gender groups.
Moreover, the capacity of each regional health system to cope with the pandemic is time-varying. Most
of the countries, which had already suffered in a severe way the pandemic, had their hospitals and physicians
overwhelmed by the numbers of critical cases (e.g., Italy, Spain, the U.S.) [12]. The main objective in the
control strategies, e.g., contention and mitigation of the disease, is to prevent the saturation or overload of
the health system because it will be directly translated into a significant increase in mortality.

2.3

Seasonal behaviour of Covid-19

Many respiratory viruses have a seasonality because lower temperature and lower humidity help facilitate
the transmission of the virus [39] [9]. There is no clear evidence that Covid-19 is going to behave seasonally,
reducing its transmission in summer. Indeed, during the summer season in the Southern hemisphere, e.g., in
some regions of South America and Australia, significant Covid-19 outbreaks have been already reported. In
[60], the authors show that on March 2020, the areas with significant community transmission of Covid-19
had distribution roughly along the 30-50 N corridor, at consistently similar weather patterns consisting of
average temperatures of 5-11C and low specific (3-6 g/kg), absolute humidity (4-7 g/m3). In [64], the authors
study the relationship between temperature, humidity and the transmission rate of Covid-19. They used data
collected from all the cities in China with more than 100 cases. The authors use a lineal regression framework
as model. Results indicate that increments of one-degree Celsius in temperature and one per cent in relative
humidity lower R0 by 0.0225 and 0.0158, respectively. The authors developed a web application,2 where R0
values for major worldwide cities can be obtained from temperature and humidity.

Current actions to control Covid-19 pandemic

For the control community, the different confinement, pro-active testing and isolation strategies that can be
implemented by a government clearly constitute control inputs to the system [4]. Many of these strategies to
slow or stop the spread of Covid-19 are being implemented worldwide, with different intensities. However,
these are not the unique actions that a government can undertake in order to control the pandemic. For
example, forcing the population to wear masks (or scarves) and plastic gloves might have an inhibitory effect
on the spread of the virus [15] and has not a significant impact on the economy (provided masks are produced
at large scale). From a control point of view, the objective is twofold. On one hand, it is important to assess
the effectiveness of the different measures against the spread of the virus. On the other hand, actions should
be planned in advance to mitigate the effects of the pandemic on health system, economy and society.
It is not simple to determine the effect of the possible anti-measures to be undertaken by the regional
governments for several reasons: (i) various inhibitory actions are generally implemented simultaneously,
therefore it cannot be evaluated which one has more impact; ii) the efficacy of the anti-measures depends
on a number of factors, like demographics and weather conditions of the specific region under consideration;
iii) the available data are, in many situations, imprecise and incomplete. The difficulties in predicting the
effects of the Covid-19 anti-measures on the regional evolution of disease is one side of the problem. Another
one is the inherent time-delay system nature of the dynamics of this disease. The effects of the undertaken
measures are observed only weeks later. Another issue is the level of fulfilment of the confinement measures
found in each country. In the following, current methods for contention and mitigation of the spread of the
virus are described.
2.4.1

Social distancing

Following the emergence of this novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and its spread outside China, many countries
have implemented unprecedented non-pharmaceutical interventions including case isolation, the closure of
schools and universities, banning of mass gatherings and/or public events, and wide-scale social distancing
including local and national lockdowns. Many governments around the world closed the educational institutions in an attempt to contain the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, impacting over 91% of the worlds
student population [62]. Another important aspect has been tackled by the New York Times: how income
affects peoples abilities to stay home and practice social distancing [63]. Wealthier people not only have
more job security and benefits but also may be better able to avoid becoming sick. In [11], authors use a
semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model to attempt inferring the impact of these interventions across
eleven European countries. They assume that changes in the reproductive number, i.e., a measure of transmission, are an immediate response to these interventions being implemented rather than broader gradual
changes in behaviour. In particular, this model estimates these changes by calculating backwards from the
deaths observed over time to estimate transmission that occurred several weeks prior, allowing for the time
lag between infection and death. One of the key assumptions of the model is that each intervention has the
same effect on the reproduction number R0 across countries and over time. This allows leveraging a greater
amount of data across Europe to estimate these effects. It also means that these results are driven strongly
by the data from countries with more advanced epidemics, and earlier interventions, such as Italy and Spain.
The main conclusion of this research was that it is critical that the trends in cases and deaths are closely
monitored.
2.4.2

Reducing mobility

Mobility of people is crucial to understand the spread of the virus. Higher mobility implies higher number
of contacts among people [67]. Furthermore, national and international mobility explains the rapid spatial
propagation of the virus worldwide. The authors in [65] use the Baidu Mobility Index, measured by the total
number of outside travels per day divided by the resident population, to find that reducing the number of
outings can effectively decrease the new-onset cases; a 1% decline in the outing number will reduce about 1%
of the new-onset-cases growth rate in one week (one serial interval).
Sensor technology can be a crucial tool to obtain mobility measures [51]. Nowadays, everyone has a mobile
phone equipped with a number of sensors, including GPS, that are able to collect data about people mobility.
Furthermore, the Internet and mobile phone operators can use their telecommunications towers to gather
mobility patterns. Of course, citizen privacy is an issue that has to be taken into consideration for data
anonymization. A first quantitative assessment of the impact of the Italian Government on the mobility and

6

the spatial proximity of Italians, through the analysis of a large-scale dataset on de-identified, geo-located
smartphone users can be found in [55].
2.4.3

Testing

The distinction between diagnosed and non-diagnosed is important because non-diagnosed individuals are
more likely to spread the infection than diagnosed ones. Indeed, the latter are typically isolated and this can
explain mis-perceptions of the case fatality rate and of the seriousness of the epidemic phenomenon [24]. The
main problem for developing massive tests and serology studies is the scarcity of resources, especially in some
countries. Accurate testing requires specific labs to analyze RT-PCR tests. On the other hand, the market of
rapid tests is under development [31] [49]. Some countries are carrying out serology-based testing. Serology
tests are blood-based tests that can be used to identify whether people have been exposed to a particular
pathogen by looking at their immune response. In this case, the objective is to have a big picture of the state
of population with respect to Covid-19. For instance, to check if herd immunity has been reached in some
locations [19].
2.4.4

Tracing contacts

Tracing the contacts of infected people is crucial to isolate potential infected individuals [18]. Once a person
is confirmed as an infected one, tracing people contacted with in the last few days can help to reduce the
propagation of virus. However, tracing contacts results to be a challenging task. Manual registers can
require an amount of resources unaffordable for the majority of countries. Therefore, technology should play
an important role [58] [18], in particular mobile devices [52] and wireless technologies, such as WiFi and
Bluetooth.

Data driven techniques to fight the pandemic

Currently, the majority of data available on Covid-19 is used for describing the pandemic in terms of reports
and visualizations.3 Although these techniques are useful to highlight the magnitude of the crisis, they are
not enough for contending and mitigating the problem. Also, these are insufficient for decision-makers to
anticipate the response to the virus propagation and evaluate the effectiveness of the implemented actions.
Classic epidemic models are also useful to obtain mathematical models for epidemics [45]. However, many
parameters of these models, such as infected rate and basic reproduction number, require data-driven approaches to estimate them accurately. Also, classic epidemic models, which are normally based on curve
fitting techniques, require data on different phases of the epidemic to obtain the parameters. For these reasons, it is obvious that more efficient approaches are needed rapidly to: i) model and forecast the spread
and the consequences of the pandemic; and ii) evaluate mitigation approaches that have been carried out.
Data-driven models (see ,e.g., [24] and [25]) can be such solution [68], [17]. Many data-based techniques
can be applied [40], ranging from classical statistical and machine learning approaches, e.g., linear regression
[56] [7] and Bayesian inference [20], to sophisticated models based on neural networks [13]. These techniques
require sufficient and high-quality data to provide a good estimation. Depending on the methodology used,
the quantity of data can vary notably from hundreds to millions of samples. Moreover, a wide variety of data
can be necessary for accomplishing an accurate model of a complex and dynamic system like the Covid-19
pandemic. Therefore, data from different disciplines are required, which hinders the data collection task. We
highlight three pillars of data-driven approaches for fighting Covid-19: i) informative variables for developing an accurate model; ii) objectives of the model: characterizing Covid-19 pandemic, epidemic models and
forecasting, etc.; and iii) its use for efficient decision making.
• Wish-list of variables: the list of variables is large, since many aspects should be taken into consideration to develop accurate models. The considered variables can be divided into different categories,
according to their discipline.4
– Covid-19 variables: regional time series of the number of confirmed cases, suspicious cases, deaths,
recovered, number of tests, hospitalized cases, ICU cases, isolated positive cases, serology studies,
3 For
4 The

example, https://againstcovid19.com/singapore/dashboard
following list can be improved including other disciplines and variables.

7

etc. When possible, the data should be divided per gender, age range, etc.
– Geographic variables: locations of Covid-19 variables. The locations can be obtained from either
names, e.g., countries, cities, etc., or GPS coordinates, i.e., longitude and latitude.
– Demographic variables: population and density of population by location. These variables are required for normalization of the rest of the variables. Other parameters are the age structure of the
population, the prevalence of secondary health conditions related to higher Covid-19 mortality, etc.
– Health system variables: total number of ICU beds, number of doctors and nurses, personal protective equipment (PPE), respirators, number and types of tests.
– Government measures: social distancing, movement restrictions, lockdowns, etc.
– Weather variables: temperature, relative humidity, radiation, etc.
– Contamination variables: air pollution, i.e., fine particulate matter P M2.5 .
– International and national mobility and connectivity: number of international and national flights,
number of train connections international and national mobility patterns, traffic patterns, etc.
• The use of data to estimate the state of the epidemic and develop forecasting models: By
using the aforementioned variables, different models can be developed to estimate the current state of
the pandemic and anticipate the response to the propagation of Covid-19. Examples of estimation and
forecasting analyses are:
– Estimation of the infected population.
– Estimation of economic impact.
– Forecast of impact in health system through number of infected.
– Assessing the impact in terms of mortality.
– Analysis of seasonal behaviour.
• Decision making: The final objective of the data-driven models is developing useful tools for helping
governments and institutions to anticipate the response to the Covid-19 propagation and evaluate their
actions. Among them, the most relevant are:
– Assessing the effectiveness of the measures.
– Planing ahead government actions.

Limitations and challenges raised by the available data

There exist different issues that can hinder the use of open data to address the challenges raised by the
Covid-19 pandemic. The main obstacles are addressed in the following sections.

8

4.1

Variety of formats

Since there is no a common shared open database on Covid-19, the different sources and variables required to
undertake a given analysis are often addressed by assembling several data sets into a single one. Although the
increased quantity of data sources presents new opportunities, working with such a variety of data reinforces
the validity challenges [47]. Another issue is related to the wide range of disciplines from which the data
sources are coming from. Indeed, these disciplines can be familiar with very different formats and data
representation. For instance, some available APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to get data on
Covid-19 provide JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) files. This format is widely used in computer science
for web applications. However, for instance, mathematicians and epidemiologists could not be familiar with
such format.

4.2

Time-varying nature

The needs of the outbreak require immediate response, which translates in obtaining the latest information
available. This raises some important challenges. For example, government measures are changing rapidly.
Often information is outdated by the time it has been identified. The number of countries implementing or
amending measures increases daily [3]. The daily availability of the data can be an issue for working with
multiple data sources simultaneously.

4.3

Confirmed cases is not a reliable metric

In the WHO global Covid-19 surveillance document, a confirmed case is defined as a person with laboratory
confirmation of Covid-19 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms. At the outbreak of the pandemic, the access to massive tests was very limited and often only a reduced fraction of the hospitalized cases
were tested at a laboratory level. Thus, most reports of infection are extremely filtered by the complex and
limited testing process. Furthermore, very few datasets provide information about the number of suspected
cases.
Even under the hypothesis that everyone with minor symptoms is tested, this would only provide an
estimate of the symptomatic cases of the disease. The study of the fraction of asymptomatic cases is an
active field of research (see e.g., [46] and [18]) not only because it is one key to the estimation of the total
number of infected cases, but because it plays a fundamental role in the spread of the virus [18].

4.4

Mortality rate is difficult to estimate

During the most severe periods of the virus spread in a country, in many situations the number of death
cases reported by the administration differs considerably from the real one. This is because only the deaths
with previous laboratory confirmation of the disease are included. Thus, the study of national death registers
suggests that there are notably and unexpected increases in death rates, according to the historical numbers.
For instance, New York City has reported 5330 more deaths than expected in April 20205 , only 3350 of
these can be accounted for Covid-19 reasons. These figures suggest that there exist an undercounting on
the real number of deaths. Another example is reported for Spain, where the ”Sistema de Monitorizacin
de la Mortalidad diaria (MoMo) 6 system registers the total number of deaths under any circumstance. The
report on April 7th indicates an increase of more than 50% of unexpected deaths in the month before. Such
increment is even more significant in men, where it reaches more than 60%.
The mortality rates are much more difficult to estimate since the estimates are often based on the number
of deaths relative to the number of confirmed cases of infection, which can be a small fraction of the real ones
[6]. Consequently, the comparison of mortality rates between countries makes compulsory the implementation
of correcting factors based on the estimation of Covid-19 infected cases and deaths non registered by the
respective administrations. Also, when considering the increase of mortality due to saturation of the health
care system, one has to take into consideration the fact that the patients who die on any given day were
infected much earlier. Thus, the denominator of the mortality rate should be the total number of patients
infected at the same time as those who died [6].

6 https://www.isciii.es/QueHacemos/Servicios/VigilanciaSaludPublicaRENAVE/EnfermedadesTransmisibles/MoMo/
Paginas/MoMo.aspx

9

Another important parameter to evaluate mortality is to have stratified data, according to gender and
age groups. However, such information is not provided by the majority of data sources.

4.5

Not availability of individual case data

To better understand the disease and to improve models and strategies to fight Covid-19, each case should be
tracked with its own timeline. That is, for each case, relevant information about when symptoms appeared,
medical treatments, evolution, degree of isolation, etc., should be available on a country-wide level. Then,
this data should be published anonymously, with a de-identification process, to prevent personal identity from
being revealed. The data, and the time corresponding to the change of each individual, should be published
by an official source in a structured way, at least, with daily frequency. This possibility is supported by the
opinion of many experts and members of the open-source community.7
An effort of obtaining individual case data can be found in [50]. The authors carried out a survey of
24 questions related to the impact of Covid-19 (Covid19Impact) on citizens in Spain. 8 The survey was
responded to by 146,728 participants over a period of less than two days (i.e., 44 hours). The questions
were about social contact behaviour, financial impact, working situation, and health status. The results of
the survey show the negative impact of Covid-19 on the life of citizens. It is a clear example of how the
collaboration of the citizens can be relevant to gather information on the effects of Covid-19. A similar work
has been pursued in UK and the results can be found in [32], where the authors created the Real World
Worry Dataset of 5,000 texts.9 The data analysis suggests that people in the UK specially worry about their
family and the economic situation.

4.6

Changing and non-uniform criteria

Since the governments are continuously adjusting their response to the virus, it is common to find out abrupt
changes in the trend of a timeseries because a new methodology has been implemented. For example, on
February 12th, a sudden spike of 15,152 new Covid19 cases in China was observed and it was related to the
modified method used for diagnosis, i.e., a combination of SARSCoV2 nucleic acid test and clinical Covid19
features [66].
Another relevant issue is that regions in the same country may provide data under the same label, but
with a different meaning. A good example is represented by the number of ICU cases. There might be
regions reporting the accumulative number of confirmed cases that required ICUs, and others the number of
ICUs used by Covid-19 patients. Something similar happens with the number of laboratory tests. They can
refer either to the total number of tests carried out or to the number of individuals tested. Indeed, in many
situations, the sources do not describe accurately the meaning of the counts.

4.7

Changing data-base structure and locations

The open data sources on Covid-19 are constantly improving. To provide more meaningful information, new
variables are incorporated into datasets. This translates into a change in the structure of the data, which
requires adjusting the code to download and process the information. When regional data are collected
from the official open data portals of different countries, a surveillance effort is required to keep track of the
different modifications. In many situations, the new data-files appear in different locations with different
names.

4.8

Government transparency

There are important differences in how the governments are reporting the data related to Covid-19. Furthermore, there are some concerns about the transparency of countries regarding the data provided.

for example, https://github.com/jgehrcke/covid-19-germany-gae.

4.9

Rush in academia publications

Many scientific papers are being rapidly published even without peer-review, which is a sub-optimal way to
publish science, and more studies are being based on data that is essentially non-peer-reviewed that may
have a potential for bias or may contain genuine errors in research methodologies.

Open data institutions providing worldwide Covid-19 data

Numerous institutions of different nature, e.g., global institutions, European Union (EU) institutions, universities, newspapers, etc., are providing daily reports on the evolution of the Covid-19 pandemic. In this
section, we enumerate those that, from our experience, resulted to be the most relevant and reliable ones.
In particular, we highlight the ones that provide updated information on a regular basis in the open-data
repository with easy access. Some of the enumerated institutions are making a great effort to provide consolidated data, describing in a rather exhaustive form, the sources and limitations of the provided datasets.
In this section, we describe the nature and characteristics of the information provided, detailing the specifics
of the datasets only for the most relevant ones.

5.1

World Health Organization

The primary role of WHO is to direct international health within the United Nations’ system and to lead
partners in global health responses. In the framework of the pandemic Covid-19, WHO is providing continuous
updates about the current situation all around the world.10 In [26], WHO provides guidelines to follow, in
the privacy of our house as well as in public, Q&A pages on the most common questions about the virus,
how it spreads and how it is affecting people worldwide,. Moreover, it addresses also myth busters related to
Covid-19, in order to provide a reliable source of information (see [27]).

5.2

Johns Hopkins University

Johns Hopkins experts in global public health, infectious disease, and emergency preparedness have been
at the forefront of the international response to Covid-19 (see https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/) since the
beginning. This university provides a daily update on the global map of the pandemic. The dataset provided
by the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) (see sub-subsection 7.1.1) is one of the most frequently used by
researchers and journal media.

5.3

University of Oxford

The Blavatnik School of Government is a department of University of Oxford that is working on the Covid-19
pandemic and on the policy responses we see around the world. One of their projects related to the study of
Covid-19 is focused on tracking what governments around the world are responding to the pandemic and how
they compare to others.11 Regarding the comparison of confinement strategies developed by governments,
they have created a common index named Stringency Index. This index is based on data obtained by the
Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT), which systematically collects information on
several different common policy responses governments have taken.

5.4

European Union

The European Data Portal (EDP)12 , which is the official open data portal of the European Union, gives
access to open data published by EU institutions and bodies. EDP acts as single access point to open data
and it is published by national open data portals and institutions in the EU Member States as well as by
other non-EU countries. There are numerous datasets on EDP that reference ”covid” or ”corona”. Also, less
specific datasets describing former health infections, epidemics or pandemics are also provided.13

In an effort to promote research on Covid-19, the European Union has opened a specific data portal,
called COVID-19 Data Portal https://www.covid19dataportal.org/. The datasets included in the portal
are divided into six categories, such as sequences, expression data, protein, structures, literature and other
resources.
In the follows, some of the most relevant European research centers, which have been tackling with the
Covid-19 outbreak, are briefly presented.
5.4.1

Joint Research Centre

The Joint Research Centre (JRC) is the European Commission’s science and knowledge service,14 which
employs scientists to carry out research in order to provide independent scientific advice and support to EU
policy.
5.4.2

European Center for Disease Prevention and Control

The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), established in 2004 after the 2003 SARS
outbreak and located in Solna, Sweden, is an independent EU agency, whose mission is to strengthen Europe’s
defences against infectious diseases. ECDC publishes numerous scientific and technical reports covering
various issues related to the prevention and control of infectious diseases. Towards the end of every calendar
year, ECDC publishes its Annual Epidemiological Report, which analyses surveillance data and infectious
disease threats. In addition to offering an overview of the public health situation in the EU, the report
offers an indication of where further public health action may be required to reduce the burden caused
by communicable diseases. As other organizations, ECDC is closely monitoring the Covid-19 pandemic,
providing risk assessments, public health guidance, advice on response activities to EU Member States and
the EU Commission, and daily-updated data on current outbreak [16].
For EU level surveillance, ECDC requests countries from EU and from the European Economic Area
(EEA) and UK to report laboratory-confirmed cases of Covid-19 within 24 hours after identification. This is
done through the Early Warning and Response System (EWRS).
5.4.3

European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts

The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) is an independent intergovernmental
organization supported by 34 states based in Reading [8]. ECMWF is both a research institute and a 24/7
operational service, producing and disseminating numerical weather predictions to EU Member States, Cooperating States and the broader community. ECMWF also archives data and makes them available to
authorized users. Some data are also made available under licence, and some are publicly available.

5.5

United Nations

Good examples of open-data provided by the United Nations (UN) are reported in [48]. Moreover, [29]
contains the most up-to-date Covid-19 cases and latest trend plot. It covers China, Canada, Australia at
province/state level whereas the rest of the world, including US, is covered at country level, represented by
either the country centroids or their capitals.

5.6

The New York Times

The New York Times is releasing a series of data files with cumulative counts of Covid-19 cases in the U.S.,
at state and county level, over time. The timeseries data are compiled from states, local governments and
health departments. Since January 2020, The NY Times has tracked cases of coronavirus in real-time as they
were identified after testing. Then, these data have been used to power maps and generate reports about
the outbreak. The data collection began with the first reported coronavirus case in Washington State, on
January 21st, 2020. Since then, the NY Times publishes regular updates of data in a GitHub repository.

to developing countries. The World Bank’s activities are mainly focused on developing countries, in fields
such as education, health, agriculture, etc. During the Covid-19 pandemic, WBG help developing countries
strengthen their pandemic response and health care systems. Furthermore, WBG has highlighted the importance of data to support countries in managing the global Covid-19 outbreak, including in their open
data portal, i.e., the World Bank Open Data,30 an entire section dedicated to Covid-19 and datasets with
real-time data, statistical indicators, and other types of data that are relevant to the coronavirus pandemic,
particularly focused on the economic and social impacts of the pandemic and the World Banks efforts to
address them.
This dataset is of particular relevance to assess the correlation among the health emergency and the
extraordinary shock the global economy is facing, trying to reply to the question: how is the deadly virus
impacting global poverty?.31 Indeed, estimating how much global poverty will increase because of COVID-19
is challenging and comes with a lot of uncertainty. To answer this question, they propose a model based on
household survey data provided by PovcalNet (an online tool provided by the World Bank for estimating global
poverty) and extrapolate forward using the growth projections from the recently launched World Economic
Outlook. Comparing these Covid-19-impacted forecasts with the forecasts from the previous edition of the
World Economic Outlook provides an assessment of the impact of the pandemic on global poverty, assuming
that the pandemic does not change inequality within countries.

Covid-19 Datasets

This section presents the main available datasets that can be found on the Internet related to Covid-19. The
section is divided into two parts. First, we present international datasets that provide global information
related to the virus impact of each country, such as number of total/new confirmed cases and number of
total/new confirmed death. Second, we include a number of regional data sets, where local information can
be found. Although the information can be redundant on several data sets, we believe that it could be
interesting to validate the developed models/analysis.

7.1

International datasets

In this section, we briefly introduce the institutions that provide international datasets, including also the
link (URL) to an easier access to them.
7.1.1

Johns Hopkins University Data Set

Johns Hopkins experts in global public health, infectious disease, and emergency preparedness have been at
the forefront of the international response to Covid-19.35 JHU provides a daily update of the global map of
the pandemic, which can be found at https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html.
The JHU Covid-19 dataset can be downloaded in .csv format from the Github repository. In this folder,
five different .csv files can be downloaded: i) global number of confirmed cases; ii) global number of deaths;
iii) global number of recovered; iv) total number of confirmed cases in US; and v) total number of deaths in
US. The global files refer to worldwide Covid-19 data. A reduced number of countries are further divided
into regions, e.g., China and Australia, whereas, most of them like Spain or Italy, are not. The U.S. data
.csv files correspond to the United States. In both cases, all the data refer to accumulated cases, i.e., cases
up to the date of the row in which the data is consigned. Furthermore, the geographical coordinates of each
region/country are also provided.
The data plots, which can be recovered at https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/new-cases, are obtained
by means of a 5-days moving window, averaging the values of that day, the two days before, and the two

Moreover, there are also some portals that provide demographic information, e.g. population pyramid as at
https://www.populationpyramid.net/.
For the population density, the European Environment Agency provided the Population density disaggregated with Corine land cover 2000 dataset as a GeoTiFF format file, which can be found at https://
www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/population-density-disaggregated-with-corine-land-cover2000-2.

Datasets on Government Measures

For datasets related to the government measures, ACAPS publishes reports and datasets on government
measures on Covid-19 at https://www.acaps.org/projects/covid19 (see section 5.10 for further deatils).
In particular, updated reports can be downloaded from [3]. Moreover, the ACAPS #COVID19 Government
Measures Dataset [2] puts together the measures implemented by governments worldwide in response to the
Covid-19 pandemic. The researched information available falls into five categories: i) social distancing; ii)
movement restrictions; iii) Public Health measures; iv) social and economic measures; and v) lockdowns.
Each category is broken down into several types of measures.
Another source for government measures to fight Covid-19 outbreak is made available by the OxCGRT
group at Oxford University, which provides an online API to access the country stringency data available at https://covidtracker.bsg.ox.ac.uk/about-api whereas the full dataset can be found at https:
//www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/oxford-covid-19-government-response-tracker.
The EpidemicForecasting.org website provides a dataset on mitigation measures carried out by countries,
which can be found at http://epidemicforecasting.org/about. In addition to that, they provide a simulator, i.e. the GLEAMviz simulator, which allows to explore realistic epidemic spreading scenarios at the
global scale.55
An application named CHIME, i.e., COVID-19 Hospital Impact Model for Epidemics, has been developed
by the Penn Medicine academic medical center from the University of Pennsylvania. This app is designed to
assist hospitals and public health officials to understand hospital capacity needs as they relate to the COVID19 pandemic. The application is based on a data model available at https://code-for-philly.gitbook.io/
chime/.
Last, the Open Government Partnership (OPG) organization has created a list of open government approaches to fight Covid-19 available at https://www.opengovpartnership.org/collecting-open-governmentapproaches-to-covid-19/. In particular, these approaches are organized by country and regions, and a
brief description and related URL are also provided for each one.

Weather DataSets and Applications

In this section, we focus on datasets related to weather, which are provided by several organizations all
around the world, as described in the follows.
The first group of organizations providing weather datasets are the following EU providers:
• European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF): is a research institute and an operational service, producing global numerical weather predictions and other data. It operates two services
from the EUs Copernicus Earth observation programme, the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) and the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S). Two main services are provided by the
ECMWF. The first one is the European Climate Data Store: The European Commission has entrusted
ECMWF with the implementation of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S). The mission of C3S
is to provide authoritative, quality-assured information to support adaptation and mitigation policies
in a changing climate. At the heart of the C3S infrastructure is the Climate Data Store (CDS),56 which
provides information about the past, present and future climate in terms of Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) and derived climate indicators. The second ECMWF service is the Copernicus Climate
Change Service (C3S*), which has worked with environmental software experts B-Open57 to develop
an application that allows health authorities and epidemiology centres to explore whether temperature
and humidity affect the spread of the coronavirus. This application is freely accessible from the C3S
Climate Data Store [10].
• European Commissions Joint Research Centre (JRC): different open-data projects at JRC can be of
interest for the scientific community fighting Covid-19. We highlight here the most relevant one, represented by the Photovoltaic Geographical Information System (PVGIS). The focus of PVGIS is the
research in solar resource assessment, photovoltaic (PV) performance studies, and the dissemination of
knowledge and data about solar radiation and PV performance. The PVGIS web application58 allows to
access to meteorological data pertinent to the study of the seasonal behaviour of the pandemic. Three
tools are available: i) Photovoltaic Performance; ii) Solar Radiation; and iii) Typical Meteorological
Year (TMY tool).
The second group of organizations providing weather datasets are US providers: i) the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA); and ii) the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA). NOAA is an American scientific agency within the United States Department of Commerce that
focuses on the conditions of the oceans, major waterways, and the atmosphere. It provides throught its open
climate data portal59 free access to global historical weather and climate data, in addition to station history
information. These data include quality controlled daily, monthly, seasonal, and yearly measurements of
temperature, precipitation, wind, etc.
On the other hand, NASA’s goal in Earth science is to observe, understand, and model the Earth system
to discover how it is changing. From an open-data perspective, NASA’s project Prediction of Worldwide
Energy Resource (POWER) can be very useful to recollect time series and monthly means of the most
relevant weather and climate variables for a given location. POWER project60 was initiated to improve
upon the current renewable energy data set and to create new data sets from new satellite systems. The
POWER project targets three user communities: (1) Renewable Energy; (2) Sustainable Buildings; and (3)
Agroclimatology. The access to the information can be done through the Data Access Viewer at https:
//power.larc.nasa.gov/data-access-viewer/, which is a responsive web mapping application providing
data sub-setting, charting, and visualization tools in an easy-to-use interface.
Last, there are many online APIs that provide weather data61 . Some of them can be used free of charge
for a limited number of requests. As an example, see World Weather online.62

8.4

Mobility data sets

This section includes datasets related to mobility of people.

• Mobility reports: Google has developed Covid-19 Community Mobility Reports, in which each report
is broken down by location and displays the change in visits to places, like grocery stores and parks.
The reports can be obtained by location at https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/. As a result,
a PDF document can be downloaded containing figures and trends. A similar tool has been developed
by Apple and it can be found at https://www.apple.com/covid19/mobility. The reports can be
obtained filtering by country. One important difference with respect to the Google app is that the raw
data can be retrieved in the form of .csv files. Last, the GeoDS Lab (Department of Geography at
University of Wisconsin-Madison) has developed a web application to identify mobility pattern changes
in the U.S. [23]. The application can be accessed at https://geods.geography.wisc.edu/covid19/
physical-distancing/.
• Aiport connectivity: FLIRT is a tool that allows to get data about commercial flights. It shows
direct flights from a selected location, and can simulate passengers taking multi-leg itineraries. The
data can be downloaded in different formats (.csv, JSON, etc.) at https://flirt.eha.io/
• Contact tracing: Another important source of data related to mobility for modeling the pandemic is human behaviour inferred from wireless technologies, such as cell communications, WiFi
and Bluetooth, among others. On this line, CRAWDAD is the Community Resource for Archiving
Wireless Data At Dartmouth, a wireless network data resource for the research community. This
repository contains wireless trace data from many contributing locations, and staff to develop better tools for collecting, anonymizing, and analyzing the data. The repository can be accessed at
http://crawdad.org/index.html and it allows to filter the data, for instance, Human Behavior Modeling and Opportunistic Connectivity, among other fields.

Reusability of Open Data sources

To maximize the value of the data sources about Covid-19, it is necessary that data sources are not only
available but also have a set of characteristics that make them reusable. Due to the global affection of the
pandemic, data sources are most of the cases coming from public institutions. These open government data
should follow the eight principles of open data as reported in [61].
MELODA 5 [1] is a metric to assess the reusability of an open data datasets. This metric considers 8
dimensions that affects the reusability of a dataset, which are listed hereafter:
1. Legal license: assesses the legal rights given to the reusers of the dataset.
2. Technical format: assesses the digital storage format in which the data is stored and released.
3. Access: assesses the possibilities offered to reusers to interact with the dataset to retrieve the necessary
set of data.
4. Standardization: assesses how popular and agreed are the fields composing the dataset and its description.
5. Geolocalization: assesses the geographical content of the released data.
6. Updating frequency: assesses the frequency of updating of the dataset.
7. Dissemination: assesses the efforts and resources done by the publishing entity to makes popular the
released datasets.
8. Prestige: assesses the reputation of he publishing entity for the reusers of their data.63
According to these dimensions, the assessment of the main data sources mentioned in previous sections is
reported in the following list:64
• 2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) Data Repository by JHU CSSE: 31
• Our world in data. Coronavirus Source Data: 34
63 For
64 In

Covid-19, this dimension cannot be set due to the novelty of the phenomenon.
this list the prestige dimension has not been removed and therefore there are 6 points of difference with next table.

Table 2: Total score corresponding to the first 7 reusability dimensions of MELODA 5 for different open
institutional data sources. (AR: Argentina; AU: Australia; CN: China; DE: Germany; FR: France; GB:
United Kingdom; IT: Italy; JHU: Johns Hopkins University; OWID: Our World In Data; PY: Paraguay; SP:
Spain; US: United States; ZA: South Africa).
Although the maximum score for MELODA 5 is 61 points [1], in Table 2 the Prestige dimension of the
publishing institution regarding Covid-19 is not included due to the novelty of the situation. To obtain a fair
comparison, this criterion has been removed from the analysis, thus leaving only 7 dimensions for the data
sources. Accordingly, a maximum of 55 points can be achieved. From this table, it is clear that none of the
sources score results higher than 35 points, a value that can be considered good but far from optimum. We
shall highlight that some sources are releasing their data with a license that restrict commercial use (they are
not open data).65 Hence, a score of 1 has been set for them on License dimension. Another remarkable point
is the general lack of an API to access individual data in the data sources. This forces the reusers to update
the full dataset on a daily basis. For this reason, most of the data sources score 1 in Access dimension. It is
also remarkable the general lack of geolocalization contents for most of the data sources. A mere indication
of the region/area is the most common geographic content. Consequently, 3 is the more frequent score for
Geolocalization dimension. Regarding technical format, .csv is the most popular, together with some sources
using JSON file formats. This last format provides additional key identification for each value. Although
many sources include a definition of the field, no Standardization effort is detected for sharing the same
information between sources. In fact, there is a myriad of different field names and contents. Hence, the
Dissemination dimension score has been considered the maximum for those sources that have a website to
disseminate the data sources.

Conclusions

In this paper, we provide a review of relevant open data sources for better understanding the worldwide spread
of the Covid-19. We enumerate the variables required to obtain consistent epidemiological and forecasting
models. In particular, we focus not only on the specific Covid-19 timeseries but also on a set of auxiliary
variables related to the study of its potential seasonal behaviour, the effect of age structure and prevalence
of secondary health conditions in the mortality, the effectiveness of government actions, etc.
We analyze the present situation of the available Covid-19 open data. Unfortunately, it is far from ideal
because of a good number of issues like data inconsistency, changing criteria, a large diversity of sources,
non-comparable metrics between countries, delays, etc. Despite the difficulties, the availability of open
data resources on Covid-19 and related variables provides many opportunities to different communities. In
particular, epidemiologists, data-driven researches, health care specialists, machine learning community, data
scientists, etc. With the goal of facilitating these communities the access to the required open-sources, we
identify the principal open data entities pertinent to the study of Covid-19. Furthermore, we enumerate
different open datasets, and their corresponding repositories, related to Covid-19 cases at a worldwide scale,
but also at a regional/local level. In addition, we provide specific information about the data resources for a
selection of countries that have been selected because of the intensity with which the pandemic has impacted
them, or for their relevance in the seasonal study of Covid-19, e.g., south-hemisphere countries. Finally, we
provide other open resources that facilitate the incorporation of demographics, weather and climate variables,
etc.
