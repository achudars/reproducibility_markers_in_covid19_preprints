Abstract:
To model the spread of COVID-19 coronavirus in Russian regions and in
Moscow, a discrete logistic equation describing the increase in the number of cases
is used. To check the adequacy of the mathematical model, the simulation results
were compared with the spread of coronavirus in China, in a number of European
and Asian countries, and the United States. The parameters of the logistics
equation for Russia, Moscow and other large regions were determined in the
interval [01.03 – 08.04]. A comparative analysis of growth rates of COVID-19
infected population for different countries and regions is presented. Various
scenarios of the spread of COVID-19 coronavirus in Moscow and in the regions of
Russia are considered. For each scenario, curves for the daily new cases and graphs
for the increase in the total number of cases were obtained, and the dynamics of
infection spread by day was studied. Peak times, epidemic periods, the number of
infected people at the peak and their growth were determined.
Keywords: coronavirus COVID-19, mathematical modeling, logistic equation,
epidemic development scenarios.

1. Introduction
The discrete logistic equation is use to describe the spread of the epidemic
coronavirus COVID – 19 in Russia and its regions. For the first time, the logistic
equation in differential form was suggested by the Belgian mathematician Pierre
Verhulst in 1845 [1] to model population growth. The essential difference from the
mathematical model of Thomas Malthus (presented in the famous work
"Experience of the population law" [2]), which describes exponential population
growth, is that the Verhulst model took into account competition for resources,

which leads to limited population growth. In 1920 logistic equation in differential
form
=

(1 − ),

(1)

where y(t) is the population size at time t, the parameter λ characterizes the
population growth rate, and the parameter N determines the maximum possible
population size in conditions of limited resources.
The logistic equation began to be widely used, starting from the 20s of the
last century, when it was rediscovered by R. Pearl [3] and confirmed its adequacy
in experiments with the reproduction of Drosophila flies.
Currently, the use of this equation has found wide application in
mathematical Biophysics, which is well reflected in the monographs of Russian
biophysicists G. Yu. Riznichenko and A. B. Rubin [4].
The Verhulst equation was also used to describe the spread of epidemics. In
this case, the entire population that can become infected is divided into two parts:
susceptible to the disease (Susceptible) and infected (-Infectious). It is believed
that the disease is transmitted through contacts of healthy people with patients with
a probability of λ, and under conditions of good mixing, the increase in patients is
described by the equation:
=
Here

= /

(1 − ).

(2)

is the part of infected people,

(1 − / ) is the part of people susceptible to the disease.
N is the maximum number of cases.
This model, written in the form of two equations, is called the SI model
(Susceptible-Infectious model).
Equation (2) is still being used for modeling COVID-19 coronavirus in
China [5] and Sweden [6]. It has two fixed (stationary) points: .:

= 0,

=

.

The second point is the only attractor. Thus, over time, no matter what value the
growth indicator λ in equation (2) takes, the population size will tend to N only
with different periods of time to reach this stationary state.

The SIR model (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered model) is considered more
realistic. In it, the entire population is divided into three parts: the part susceptible
to the disease y (Susceptible), infected x (Infected) and recovered z (Recovered).
The presence of recovering people in the model reduces the number of infected
people who can infect others. The model equations have the form:
=−
=+

,
− ,

= + ,
where μ − is the rate of recovery.
There are even more complex models [7] that describe the spread of
infections more accurately. However, the more complex the model, the more
unknown parameters it contains, the value of which cannot be estimated with good
accuracy.
Note, that there is a large difference between the maximum number of
residents, who are potentially ill (Nmax) and the maximum number of residents, who
are actually ill (Nin). The value of Nmax is much greater than the number of Nin.
The main parameters that most strongly affect on the spread of COVID-19
coronavirus and on the characteristics of the peak are two parameters: the growth
rate of the number of cases and the maximum value of the number of residents who
can potentially be infected Nin. The number of recovered in the case of COVID-19
almost up to the peak can be ignored.
The main parameters that most strongly affect the rate of spread of COVID19 coronavirus infection and the characteristics of the peak are two parameters: the
growth rate of the number of cases and the maximum value of the number of
residents who can potentially be infected with Nin.
We used a discrete logistic equation that contains exactly these two
parameters, and we believe that in this case it describes the spread of the epidemic
better than any other model. The discrete logistic equation is widely known thanks

to the work of the American scientist M. Feigenbaum [8]. M. Feigenbaum
discovered interesting regularities obtained using this equation and created a theory
of universality for discrete maps. In particular, he showed that when the
dimensionless growth indicator changes in the equation in the interval (3-4), period
doubling bifurcations occur, and when the growth indicator value is equal to ~
3.5699, the logistic equation generates chaotic dynamics. After these studies, the
discrete logistic equation was widely used for modeling various processes [9-10].
For an adequate discrete description of phenomena, an important characteristic is
the choice of a step, a discrete time interval, at which the population numbers are
considered.
According to calculations by Nobel laureate Michael Levitt, made for China,
in 24 hours, 1 person in China could infect 2.2 million people with a coronavirus
infection. That is, one person could become infected from another within a time
interval of ~ 10.9 hours. Therefore, a time interval of 12 hours was taken for the
discrete logistic equation. This period is close to 10.9 hours and is convenient for
comparing the estimated and actual data. In other words, the number of patients is
recalculated every 12 hours, and the actual data is checked every day.

2. Mathematical model of the spread of COVID-19
We used a discrete logistic equation to describe the spread of COVID-19
coronavirus in different countries and cities. It has the form:
=
where

= ( ),

= 1,2, … ,

(1 −

/ ),

− is the number of cases in the nth time

(3)
;λ

is the coefficient (index) of growth of population, which can be varied by changing
the conditions of infection, for example, when carrying out quarantine measures; N
is the normalization factor (the maximum value of the number of residents who can
potentially get infected). This parameter depends on a number of factors, such as

the population size, its crowding or density, resistance to disease, discipline of the
population during quarantine measures, etc.
This model describes growth in accordance with a logistic function: the
number of sick people grows rapidly until it is small (yn≪N), then the growth rate
slows down more and more, and the number of sick people asymptotically tends to
a stationary value. Making the change of variables:
This model shows that the population of sick people grows rapidly
(exponentially), while it is small ( ≪N) and begins to decrease, when there are a
lot of sick people. Making the change of variables
=

,

=

.

(4)

we reduce equation (3) to the form:
(1 −

=

),

(5)

where the variables xn and the parameter α are dimensionless.
For values 0 < α ≤ 1, regardless of the choice x0, the population size tends to
zero. That is, the number of cases will tend to zero, no matter how many cases
there were at the beginning.
At values 1 < α ≤ 3, the dimensionless number of the diseased population
tends to a stationary stable state ̅ , equal to
̅=

(6)

Therefore, over time, the number of people who become ill at the end of the
epidemic will be equal to
=

∙

(7)

The relations (6) and (7) are correct if the α index remains constant
throughout the epidemic.
Note that there is an important difference between the differential equation
describing logistic growth and the discrete one. In the differential equation at 1<α,
the number tends to the value N, and in the discrete equation-to the value

(7),

which depends on the growth rate indicator, and may differ greatly from N. The

current quarantine measures reduce the probability of infection and the indicator α
decreases, which leads to a decrease in the total number of cases .

3. The results of mathematical modeling
To test the feasibility of using the logistic equation to describe the spread of
COVID-19 coronavirus in Russian regions, the model was applied to describe the
spread of the virus in China, where epidemic has already ended [11].
The initial value of the normalized multiplier N for China was selected using
the ratio (7). For China, the number of cases at the end of the epidemic was

=

82500. The initial approximation of the average value of the population growth
indicator was taken as < α > ~ 1.12.
The rates α and the value of the normalizing factor N were determined from
the trend of the population curve of COVID-19 infected people throughout the
entire period of the epidemic. The time interval ∆=

−

, with which the

number of infected populations was calculated, was taken to be 12 hours, and
comparison with statistical data was carried out after 2∆, that is, once a day. The
value of the normalizing factor was chosen N = 760,000, and the parameters for the
growth of the infected population were equal to
α = 1.19

from 3.01.2020 to 30.01.2020,

α = 1.104

from 31.01.2020 to 10.02.2020,

α = 1.18

from 10.02.2020 to 12.02.2020,

α = 1.119

from 13.02.2020 till the end of the epidemic.

Figures 1 and 2 show the change in the population of people infected with
COVID-19 coronavirus in China and the increase in the number per day for the
period of the epidemic.

Figures 1 and 2 shows a good correspondence between the calculated and
real data. This good coincidence made it possible to use the logistic equation (3),
(5) to model the spread of the coronavirus epidemic in a number of European and
Asian countries. For each of the countries, indicators of population growth α and
normalizing factors N were found.

before the peak of the epidemic in a number of European and Asian countries and
the United States.

After analyzing the ratio of the normalizing factor to the number of residents
of Moscow, four scenarios for the development of the spread of the COVID-19
coronavirus epidemic were considered:
1 scenario:

N = 1 000 000 (N/A·100% = 7,1 %);

(8.1)

2 scenario:

N = 760 000

(N/A·100% = 5,4 %);

(8.2)

3 scenario:

N = 500 000

(N/A·100% = 3,6 %);

(8.3)

4 scenario:

N = 300 000 (N/A·100% = 2,1 %).

(8.4)

Figures 3 and 4 show actual data (from 05.03.2020 to 09.04.2020) and

Also, simulations of the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus epidemic in
the regional part of Russia was done. (The number of infected residents of the

Moscow region and Moscow was subtracted from the total number of infected
people in Russia). Table 4 shows the growth rates of the number of cases for
various scenarios with a normalizing factor:

The growth rates of the number of people infected with coronavirus in the
Russian regions were calculated in such a way as to best describe the actual data
from March 1 to April 7. We see that they changed twice. Since we use only
recorded data, the change in the indicator for the first time is probably due to an
increase in the number of tests and an improvement in their quality.
The decrease in the indicator since April 1st is due to the reaction of the virus
spread to quarantine measures Then, starting from April 8th, a forecast was made
using equation (3), which used the value of the last growth indicator.
Table 6 shows a comparison of forecast and real data for several days (from
15.04.20 to 21.04.20) for the same four scenarios.

Analyzing the data in the table 6, you can see that the best agreement with
Day

the actual data is given by calculations for the first and second scenarios with the
parameter N = 2×106 and N = 1×106. But the final choice of the normalizing factor
N can be made closer to the peak value of the daily new cases.
4. Discussion
The simplest model of infection spread chosen by us, which is based on a
discrete logistic equation (3), has demonstrated a very good description of real data
and the ability to predict the dynamics of the epidemic. Based on the data on the
spread of COVID-19 coronavirus infection in China, where the epidemic has
already ended, we worked out the procedure for finding the model parameters. The
model was used to describe the dynamics of the spread and forecast of COVID-19
coronavirus infection in various countries and cities: Spain, Italy, France, Portugal,
Sweden, South Korea, Japan, the United States, and others. For each country,
different model parameters were selected at the early stages of the spread of the
epidemic and several scenarios for its further development were proposed. All
scenarios described the actual data well at the beginning of the epidemic and
produced very similar results. But as the extent of the epidemic increases, when the
influence of the normalizing factor N begins to affect, the forecast scenarios for the
development of the epidemic begin to differ greatly. Then the final value of the
parameter N can be selected based on the actual data.

Note, that the rate of increase in the number of cases is evaluated in the first
stage of the epidemic, when the linear term prevails in equation (5), and the
nonlinear term can be ignored:
≈

(9)

Then the disease increases exponentially, which in the logarithmic scale is a
straight line. The growth indicator determines the slope of the straight line. If the
growth rate changes, then the slope of the straight line also changes. It may change
with the introduction of various quarantine measures or their cancellation.
Table 1 shows the average estimated growth rates of the number of cases
before the peak of the epidemic in a number of European and Asian countries and
the United States. The best agreement with actual data was obtained for these
values of growth rates. These values determined both the time of the peak and the
number at the peak. Table 1 shows that Sweden and Japan have the lowest rates of
growth in the number of cases. Perhaps because of these indicators, these countries
did not impose strict quarantine measures.
As mentioned above, the parameter N begins to affect strongly on the
development of the epidemic closer to its peak. Although this parameter represents
the maximum number of residents who can potentially be infected, it does not
mean that all of them will get sick. In this model, as much as corresponds to the
growth indicator α will get sick in contrast to SI, SIR, and other models. The
normalizing factor N depends on the nation's immunity to the virus, on the living
conditions of the inhabitants (crowding, etc.), on the mentality of the nation, etc. It
is calculated based on the agreement of calculated and actual data. Table 2 shows
the ratio of N to population A of the cities or countries considered (N/A·100%).
Let's consider possible scenarios for the development of the epidemic in
Moscow. The beginning of the spread of coronavirus infection in Moscow is
considered to be March 5, when 5 cases were identified. To determine the
normalizing factor N for Moscow, Table 2 was analyzed and four possible
scenarios for the spread of COVID-19 in Moscow (8.1) – (8.4) with a ratio (N/A)
of 2 to 7% were proposed.

The first scenario (8.1) is the most hard, let's call it New York scenario, the
second scenario (8.2) is called Wuhan (the normalizing factor coincides with the
normalizing factor taken for Wuhan). The last fourth scenario (8.4) is the easiest,
let's call it the Israeli one (the normalizing multiplier is the same as in Israel).
The parameter α for Moscow was selected at the early stages of infection
spread (before April 7). Fig. 7 shows the increase in the number of cases by day in
a logarithmic scale (the black line marked with crosses is statistical data, the red
curve is model calculations for the scenario with N = 760000). We see that up to
the last day of observation (April 18), the model perfectly describes the statistical
data. The graph of the number of cases shows that the entire observation segment
can be approximately divided into three intervals with different indicators α, in
which the growth trend of patients has a different slope. The values of the indicator
α are shown in Fig. 7 and in the Table 3.We see that the value of the indicator
decreased when measures for self-isolation of people gave results. In Moscow,
these measures had an impact on April 1 (Fig. 7. the slope of the straight line
decreased in a logarithmic scale).

Days from Mar. 5
Fig. 7. Determination of the growth index α of the number of patients with
COVID-19 coronavirus in Moscow

The parameter values have not been re-selected or changed since April 7. All
scenarios up to April 7 described the actual data well, but by April 14 it became
clear that the 3rd and 4th scenarios were lagging behind the actual data, especially
the 4-th scenario with N = 3×105. Splitting of forecast data under four scenarios
begins as the number of cases increases and approaches the peak (see Fig. 3, 4).
Table 5 shows the calculated data under four scenarios for the spread of the
coronavirus epidemic in Moscow: the time of peak population growth, the number
of infected people and the value of new case at the peak, the total number of cases,
and the end time. The last column shows the estimated time of the end of the
epidemic (when only a few people get sick a day).
Table 8 shows a comparison of forecast and real data for several days (from
15.04.20 to 21.04.20) for the same four scenarios for the development of the
epidemic in Moscow made on April 7. Tables 7 and 8 show that the milder
scenarios of the epidemic in Moscow (the third and fourth), unfortunately, could
not be kept. The best description of statistical data on coronavirus cases in Moscow
in the last days are given by the 1-st and 2-nd scenarios with a normalizing factors
N = 1.0×106 and N = 7.6×105. In the last week, Moscow has sharply tightened
quarantine measures and increased control over their implementation. This
suggests optimism that the second scenario of the epidemic will be held. But there
is a chance that Moscow will follow the worst-case first scenario.

Now let's look at the dynamics of the spread of COVID-19 coronavirus
infection in regional Russia (without Moscow and the Moscow region). When
calculating the number of people infected with COVID-19 coronavirus for Russian
regions, we also considered four scenarios with the ratio of normalized multipliers
to the number of Russia (minus the number of the Moscow region) in the range
[0.8-1.7%], namely, scenarios with normalized multipliers:
1st scenario: N = 2·106; 2nd scenario: N = 1·106;
3rd scenario: N = 7.6·105; 4th scenario: N = 5·105.
Table 5 shows that scenarios 3 and 4 produce results that lag more and more
behind the actual data every day. So, it was not possible to keep the milder
scenarios of the epidemic development with a smaller number of cases. In recent
days, the results of scenarios 1 and 2 have also started to lag behind the real data. It
seems that the easing of already soft restrictive measures has led to an outbreak in
some regions. This means that the growth rate parameter α has changed, and it will
need to be slightly increased and selected in the model. Which of the scenarios, the
harder 1st scenario or the less hard 2nd scenario, is implemented will be clear in a
few days.
If you compare the growth in the number of infected people in Russia with the
growth in the number of infected people in Moscow, we can see that the indicators
for the Russian regions is generally lower than for Moscow. The average

population growth rate for Moscow, calculated before the peak, is 1.112, which is
lower than in European countries, but higher than in Japan (see Table 1). The
average number of COVID-19 infected people (before the peak of the epidemic) in
Russian regions is 1.098, which is lower than in Moscow. That is, the growth rate
of the number of COVID-19 infected people in the year Moscow is 1.02 times
higher than the growth rate of the number of cases in the Russian regions (in total).
The epidemic peaks in Moscow under various scenarios occur in the range
from 19.04 to 24.04. and the epidemic peaks in Russian regions for various
scenarios from 25.04 to 4.05. In other words, the epidemic peaks in the Russian
regions are a week behind the epidemic peaks in Moscow.
The forecast was made with the indicator value unchanged from April 1. And
the value of this parameter is correlated with the number of people in contact. We
see that the measures taken to isolate the population have had an effect, and in all
scenarios the growth rate has decreased from April 1.
It should be noted that the distribution of the epidemic in China fell well
within the scenario with the choice of a single normalizing factor. To model the
epidemic in a number of European countries, such as Italy and Spain, we needed
two logistic equations with different rationing factors. This is due to fluctuations
with a large amplitude in the peak area and on a downtrend. The results of the
logistics equation with a smaller multiplier described the actual data better before
the peak. The model with a larger multiplier described the real data better after the
peak. In other words, the actual data went along the corridor between these two
curves.
What is the scenario for the spread of the epidemic in Russia after the
"Chinese" or "European" peak will become clear when the peak will be passed.
Conclusions
Mathematical modeling of the dynamics of the spread of COVID-19
coronovirus infection in Moscow and in regional Russia was carried out and
forecasts were made. The simplest nonlinear discrete equation describing logistic

growth was chosen as the model. This model contains only two parameters that are
chosen based on statistical data at the initial stage of the epidemic. The first
parameter is a rate of the increase in the number of cases. It can change with the
implementation of quarantine measures and affect on the total number of cases at
the end of the epidemic. The second parameter is a normalization multiplier that
only estimates the maximum potential number of residents who may become ill.
The predicted total number of cases is calculated in the model and may differ from
the N value by more than an order of magnitude. Its exact value can only be
determined closer to the peak of the epidemic, so based on the experience of
modeling the spread of the epidemic in different countries that have already passed
the peak, different N values are selected and different scenarios are considered.
Four different scenarios of the epidemic development are proposed for Moscow
and regional Russia. For each scenario, the growth rates of the population infected
with COVID-19 coronavirus were founded, the peak time was calculated, the
maximum increase in cases at the peak and the total number of cases during the
epidemic were found. While the work was being prepared, it became clear that
Moscow did not manage to isolate citizens well from each other, and two easier
scenarios are no longer being implemented. The tightening of quarantine measures
in the last week inspires optimism that the development of the epidemic in
Moscow will follow the second, not the worst scenario, which currently best
describes the actual data.
Mathematical modeling of the dynamics of the spread of coronavirus
infection in the regions of Russia showed that it is delayed by 6 days compared to
Moscow, and the growth rates of the number of cases is slightly less than the
growth rate in Moscow. Four scenarios for the development of the epidemic in
regional Russia were considered too. It is calculated that for the" light "scenario for
the Russian regions, the number of cases will be ~ 40,000 people, for the "heavy"
scenario – 160,000 people.
Note that we based on official data on the number of cases, which determine
the burden on health care. And unrecorded cases, which according to some

estimates may be 20% of those accounted for, ensure the spread of infection, and
the model can be used.
