N95 respirators comprise a critical part of the personal protective equipment used by frontline health-care workers, and are typically meant for one-time usage. However, the recent
COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a serious shortage of these masks leading to a worldwide effort to develop decontamination and re-use procedures. A major factor contributing
to the filtration efficiency of N95 masks is the presence of an intermediate layer of charged
polypropylene electret fibers that trap particles through electrostatic or electrophoretic effects. This charge can degrade when the mask is used. Moreover, simple decontamination
procedures (e.g. use of alcohol) can degrade any remaining charge from the polypropylene, thus severely impacting the filtration efficiency post decontamination. In this report,
we summarize our results on the development of a simple laboratory setup allowing measurement of charge and filtration efficiency in N95 masks. In particular, we propose and
show that it is possible to recharge the masks post-decontamination and recover filtration
efficiency.

respirators comprise a critical part of the personal protective equipment (PPE) used by

frontline health-care workers as they provide a barrier for transmission of pathogen laden droplets
that are ejected by coughing, sneezing, talking or breathing by an infected person3–6 . The name
designation N95 indicates that these masks can filter 0.3µm sized particles with 95% efficiency4 .
N95 masks are meant for one-time usage for two reasons: (1) potential contamination and (2)
rapid degradation of their filtration efficiency with use. However, the recent COVID-19 pandemic
has resulted in a serious shortage of these masks which has started an intensive search for methods
which would allow for multiple use.
Most of the literature has dealt with various proposals for decontamination procedures, including careful use of dry and wet heat or exposure to hydrogen peroxide vapor, ozone, UV radiation,
or alcohol5,7–14 . While each of these methods likely deactivates viruses, it seems to be common
knowledge that such procedures adversely impact filtration efficiency and may even cause deterioration of the structural integrity of the mask.
Less attention has been focused on restoring the filtration efficiency of a mask once it has
become degraded; this is the question we address in this work. In this paper we propose a method
which, provided the mask has not been structurally compromised, can restore filtration efficiency
to out-of-box levels.
As with other filtration processes, N95 masks intercept foreign particles in different layers of
the mask material. A particle can be captured either mechanically - if it encounters a mask fiber
directly in its path - or if the mask material is such that it can attract and ensnare particles, say
electrostatically16 . On making contact with the surface of the fibre, adhesive forces, such as the
Van der Waals force, immobilize the particle on the surface of the fiber17 .
Flow through a mask is usually thought to be laminar, such that the flow would usually bend
smoothly around an obstacle (fiber). If this is the case, mechanical capture of the particle on the
surface of the fiber happens when a particle deviates from its streamline path, causing an impact
with the mask material. This can happen for larger particles whose inertia is large enough to
cause such a deviation from the streamline, or for smaller particles whose Brownian diffusion is
strong enough18 . For filters based on fibrous materials, and operating at filtration velocities similar
to those encountered in human breathing, the minimum filtration efficiency occurs for ≈ 0.3µm
1

Athough we shall use the term N95, our results pertain equally to PPF2 and KN95 respirators which work on the
same basis. Moreover, we note that the protocol described herein works for surgical masks and other filtering
facepiece respirators as well.

sized particles. At this scale the filtration mechanism crosses over from a diffusion dominated
regime to an inertia dominated regime19 .
In addition to mechanical capture, N95 respirators employ an electrostatic mechanism to attract
and intercept foreign particles (charged or uncharged). This happens when there are significant
electric fields and electric field gradients in the mask material, which may occur when the fibers
are charged20 . It is these electrostatic interactions which raise the filtration of N95 masks to the
95% level. Charged fibers can attract both inherently charged particles by Coulombic forces as
well as neutral polar particles (such as tiny aqueous droplets) by dielectrophoretic forces that
come from the interaction of polarized objects and electric field gradients.
In typical N95 masks, the electrostatic filtration is performed by a layer comprised of a nonwoven melt-blown mesh of charged polypropylene fibers. Most of the pores in this mesh have
a characteristic length scale of about 15µm and about 90% of its space is void. This layer is
3

held in place between two or more quasi-rigid layers that provide both support and mechanical
filtration. Polypropylene is an electret, a dielectric material which can hold a charge or possess a
net microscopic dipole moment21 .
Pure polypropylene is a non-polar polymer with a band gap of 8eV. However, the presence
of molecular level defects both chemical and physical in nature allow the formation of localized
energy states that can trap charge21 . Moreover, its electrical polarization properties are often enhanced by introducing various additives like magnesium stearate22 or BaTiO3 23 which are added
to the polymer melt to increase the electret performance. Even then, the charge on the polypropylene fibers undergoes significant degradation when open to the surroundings, which is exacerbated
by the warm humid environment created by respiration during use. Additionally, most decontamination methods remove all the charges from the charged layer, with a concomitant reduction in
mask efficiency.
Thus, a key aspect of the performance of an electret-based mask is its ability to maintain its
charge in a hot and humid atmosphere. Failing this, extended usage can only be obtained through
a cycle of decontamination and recharging, if this is possible. It follows that a simple procedure
for electrically recharging a decontaminated mask without disassembling it would be very useful,
especially if it does not rely on special-purpose equipment which would not be readily available.
The standard methods for charging polymer fibers are corona discharge24 , photo-ionisation
induced by particle beams (gamma rays, x-rays, electron beams)25,26 , tribo-electrification27–29 ,
and liquid contact charging30 . These methods are not easily deployable in hospital conditions on
preassembled masks. In this note, we propose a simple recharging method based on high electric
fields, and demonstrate its effectiveness.
Crucially, our method can be performed using readily available equipment and materials, and
so can be employed both in urban and rural settings.

Mask filtration testing setup
Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, we did not have access to special-purpose mask filtration
equipment, so we designed and constructed a rough apparatus to measure the efficiency of filtration
of particulate matter, using an air-quality monitor as a particle counter. The setup is shown in
Figure 1. A plastic ball serves as our proxy of the human face, on which we place the mask
that we want to test. Air is sucked through the mask with a vacuum pump whose flow rate is
4

controlled and monitored by a flow meter. We use an oil-free diaphragm pump (HSV-1, High
Speed Appliances, Mumbai) that provides a maximum flow of 30 lpm. The flow can be measured
and controlled with a taper-tube flow meter. For most experiments we used a flow of 10 lpm,
similar to typical human breathing rates. This air is made to flow through an particle counting
setup which contains a Plantower PMS7003 sensor 2 . The details of the experimental setup can be
found in the GitHub repository15 ( see supplementary section.
While the particle sensor chips are optimized for 2.5 µm particle measurements, the Plantower
PMS7003 sensor also has a 0.3µm channel. The filtration efficiency (η) is determined from the
ratio of 0.3µm particles per unit time detected with the mask attached (Nmask ) to that without the
mask attached (Nambient ) as



Nmask
× 100.
η = 1−
Nambient

Our measurements are taken using a small diaphragm pump to suck air through a mask attached
to a plastic ball at flow rates (∼ 10 lpm) of the order of physiological breathing rates. Much higher
flow rates (∼ 80 lpm) are often used to certify N95 masks. To check for the dependence of the
filtration efficiency on flow rates, we measured filtration efficiency for flow rates between 3 and
30 lpm, and have found that the difference in the measured η is about one percent. The efficiency
of our particle counter for smaller particles is of order 50%. Since η is related to the ratio of Nmask
and Nambient , it is insensitive to the fact that not all the particles at 0.3µm are being counted. We
have cross-checked the measurements obtained with the Plantower chip with a Lighthouse cleanroom particle counter, and we found the measurements of η by both the devices to be consistent.
For the ambient air to be filtered, we generated aerosols of normal saline solution (0.9%) by
employing a standard medical nebulizer. These nebulizers produce a broad distribution of droplet
sizes ranging from 100 nm to 10 µm31 .
The fit of the mask to the plastic ball is imperfect, allowing air leakage from the sides. To
obtain reproducible values, the masks edges were taped to the ball using paper masking tape. The
filtration data, albeit employing a home-made testing apparatus, should be sufficient to make at
least semi-quantitative comparisons between one mask and another, and quantitative comparisons
between the same mask in its charged and uncharged states. To give a sense of the measurement,
the filtration data from a pristine N95 mask is shown in Figure 2. When the mask is placed on
the ball without taping the sides, its efficiency was 76 ± 1%. Upon taping the sides, the efficiency

Typically, particle counters work by analysing the light scattered by the particles. Since the size of the particles are
comparable to the wavelength of visible light, this scattering is of Mie type. Further, it is assumed that these are
single scattering events.

and the filtration efficiency is 76 ± 1%. Upon taping the mask to the ball, we obtain ∼ 95 ± 1% filtration
efficiency.

improved to 95 ± 1%. The reduction in filtering efficiency due to poor fitting is a generic problem
associated with the use of face masks1 .

Charge measurement
As shown in Figure 3(a), We used a Keithley 6514 electrometer to measure the charge, with
the mask placed in a metal cup which was electrically isolated from the ground by an insulating
teflon surface. The input of the electrometer is a three-lug triax connector, with the innermost wire
(input high) being the charge sensing terminal. This charge sensing terminal of the electrometer
was connected to the metal cup. In our experiments we used the guard-off condition, i.e., the
common (input low) and the chassis are grounded. Electrometers measure charge by transferring
the charge from the point of measurement to the reference capacitor of the electrometer, and only
free charge can be transferred. Therefore, since it does not account for any bound charge, our
measurement likely underestimates the total charge on a mask and so should be regarded as giving
a relative indication rather than a precise measurement of the total charge on the masks. This

a 100µm thick insulator (PET plastic sheet) was inserted between the mask and the ground electrode. Under
high field the mask acts like an electrode on which the charges can be deposited. The insulator allows the
mask to get charged because it prevents any current from flowing in the circuit.

being said, there appears to be a qualitative correlation between measured charge and filtration
efficiency, with masks with higher values of measured charge having higher filtration efficiency
η (see Table I). The data both N95 and surgical masks are tabulated in the table. The surgical
masks are different than the N95 masks in construction. Hence, comparisons between charge and
filtration efficiency should be made between masks of the same type. Moreover, we our charge
measurement technique is not sensitive to the dipolar character of the electrets. Hence quantitative
calculation of correlation based on free charges can not be estimated from this measurement alone.

TABLE I. Filtration efficiency and charge of masks tested. The surgical masks are different than the N95
masks in construction, thus, the comparisons between charge and filtration efficiency should be made between masks of the same type. The error in the charge measurement is mainly statistical in nature and
comes from the uncertainty in the contact between the mask and the electrode. Note that the resolution
of the charge measurement capability of the Keithley 6514 electrometer is few femto coulombs, which is
orders of magnitude smaller than what is measured.

Recharging

The masks were recharged by sandwiching them between two metal plate electrodes, which
were connected to the high and the low output terminals of a SRS PS370 power supply. The low
output terminal was grounded and a suitable voltage of positive or negative polarity was applied
from the high output terminal of the source meter; Figure 3(b) sketches the recharging setup.
Our recharging method exploits the nonlinear conductivity of electrets, in particular polypropylene, as a function of applied electric field. The electrical conductivity of polypropylene is dominated by hopping32,33 . Thus at high fields, the conductivity of polypropylene is high, which makes
the introduction of excess charges into the material possible by connecting it to a charge source.
When the charge source is switched off, the applied electric field becomes zero, and conductivity of the polypropylene drops effectively to zero. As a result, the added charge carriers become
immobile, and the material remains charged. We find that the total charge deposited on the masks
depends strongly on the charging time, as seen in Figure 4, which shows the result of different
charging times on a N95 mask, with the pristine value almost reattained after a 60 minute charge
at 1000V.

Filtration efficiency of recharged masks
In the previous section we demonstrated that the application of relatively high voltage recharges
the masks. Of course, the important test is whether this recharging translates into improved efficiency in the filtration of fine particles. To assess this, we first obtained a baseline measurement
for the filtration efficiency of new unused masks3 . We then performed typical sanitization protocols, during which the masks typically lost most of their charge4 , and measured the filtration
efficiency of the discharged masks. We then recharged the masks and measured their filtration
efficiency. The effect of different sanitization protocols and recharging on the filtration efficiency
of the masks is tabulated in Table II.
Representative data of the filtration efficiency of various masks after decontamination and
recharging is given in the top panels of Figure 5, where we start with a new KN95 mask whose
out-of-box filtration efficiency was measured to be 95 ± 1% (see Fig. 5(a)). The mask was then

washed at ∼ 40◦ C in a conventional washing machine with detergent. Such treatment would be
expected to dissolve the lipid layer of the SARS-CoV-2 virus which causes COVID-19. The mask
was then air dried, and its efficiency was measured to be 75 ± 1% ( see Fig. 5 (b) ). The mask
was then recharged for 60 minutes using the method of Figure 3(b), following which its filtration
efficiency was measured to be 95% ( see Fig. 5 (c) ). We then repeated this protocol, and found
that the filtration efficiency reattained 95 ± 1%. Figure 5 (d) shows that the filtration efficiency of
an exposed mask degrades only slightly, from ∼ 95 ± 1% to ∼ 92 ± 1%, over the course of one
day. This suggests that the use of sterilization procedures which do not cause structural damage to
a mask coupled with our recharging protocol will produce a respirator which may be used multiple
times with no sacrifice in filtration efficiency.
We have verified that the recharging method works on a variety of N95 respirators, and that the
filtration efficiency of degraded masks can be improved by charging, if not to brand-new efficiency.

TABLE II. The drop in the filtration efficiency in N95 masks due to different protocols of decontamination
and the recovery of filtration by recharging the masks. For the KN95 masks we used 2000V while for the
Venus and Magnum N95masks we used 1000V a . For decontamination by ethanol, a new KN95/Magnum
mask was soaked in ethanol and then dried. In the boiling method, the mask was immersed in boiling water
for 1 hour and then dried. For the washing machine method the mask was laundered in a regular washing
machine in a standard 40 ◦ C, 84 minute cycle, wash/rinse/spin dry cycle. For the steam method, the Venus
mask was exposed to steam for 5 minutes on each side. For all these protocols we started with a new
N95mask.

This suggests that by using this method we should be able to determine the effect of various
disinfection protocols on the structural integrity of different brands of mask. In this context we
note that a given sensitization method may affect different brands of masks very differently, as
seen in Table II.

In-situ application of an electric field keeps the electret filter recharged
Today, N95 masks are being worn by health-care workers for extended periods of time. This
gives rise to very humid conditions. Humidity is detrimental to electrostatics. Thus, during use,
all electrostatics-based masks slowly lose their efficiency. A solution that can help replenish the
lost charge on the masks in real time would be desirable. In this section we provide a proof-ofconcept method of keeping the masks charged which comes as a logical extension of our recharging method.
We tested a technique by which the filter material maintains its charge, and thus its filtration
efficiency. We do this by applying a high electric field in a current limited condition (very low
current (few µA), so no risk of discharge or shocking) to the material in-situ. Figure 6 shows a

between two porous metallic screens which are connected to a 4V battery whose voltage is multiplied to 2000V using a standard voltage multiplier circuit. We use a rubber gasket on both sides
of the mask material to provide electrical insulation. The efficacy of the method is indicated in
Figure 6, where the filtration efficiency in the absence of an electric field is 85 ± 1%, which rises
to 95 ± 1% upon application of voltage. We have verified that as long as the voltage is applied, the
filtration efficiency remains high.
Since the currents required are extremely small, a large battery is not required, and it is possible
that a small compact and practical solution may be feasible.

Conclusions
Since the loss of electrical charge from the polypropylene filter layer in N95 masks is known
to impact the filtration efficiency, we investigated the possibility of mask recharging for a few
commercially available N95 masks using a simple laboratory setup. Our results suggest that it is
possible to recharge the masks post-sterilization and recover filtration efficiency. However, this is
a promising development that merits further research as it may permit multiple or extended use
in practical applications. In particular, this method may allow for N95 masks to be used for a
considerably longer period of time than is the current norm, which can have a significant effect in
hospitals where mask supply is insufficient. Additionally, we envisage that our method may find
applications in a variety of air filtration contexts. We have focused in this paper on high efficiency
respirators for use in preventing disease transmission, but we anticipate applications to HVAC and
industrial filtration as well, where our recharging method would allow for the extended use of
electrostatic filters, resulting in reduced cost and waste. Furthermore, our in-situ field application
makes possible high efficiency filtration with undiminished performance over time.

SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL
Construction of the mask particle filtration efficiency tester
In this section we outline the design of the low-cost, compact, particle filtration efficiency
test setup using a Plantower PMS 7003 particle concentration sensor air quality monitor chip and
a ESP8266-based WiFi microcontroller that was used for the measurements of particle filtration
efficiency reported in this work. All the construction details, diagrams, source codes for the microcontroller and interface are available open-source at the GitHub repository5 .
A background of fine particles was generated using normal saline solution in a standard medical
nebulizer to create a fine aerosol. Air is sucked through the particle counter using an oil-free
diaphragm pump and the throughput of 0.3 µm sized particles measured with and without a mask
at the input. A simple HTML-based web interface was used to read the particle counts and evaluate
the filtration efficiency. We estimate a ±1% accuracy for measurements made with this setup.

Design
Any mask filtration efficiency test setup requires to subject a sheet of the mask material of
fixed area (or the entire mask, typically mounted on a human face mannequin), to a flux of 0.3
µm sized particles (for N95) and measure the throughput of such particles across the mask. Given
the interest in air quality measurements, especially in polluted cities, air-quality- indicator (AQI)
systems are cheaply available and widely deployed. Most of these are designed to measure PM2.5
and PM10 levels (of 2.5 µm and 10 µm sized particles). However many such AQI systems are
based on laser particle counter sensors (like the Plantower PMS 1003/5003/7003 series 6 ) that
actually provide measurements of particle counts at 0.3, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5 and 10 µm as standard
outputs. These sensors are optimized for the detection of 2.5 µm sized particles and have been
extensively tested 7
Though the sensitivity of the PMS 7003 at 0.3 µm is considerably less than at 2.5 µm, it is
reasonable enough for reliable measurements. However, in any case the absolute sensitivity is not
critical for a mask test application as the parameter of interest is a ratio of measurements. The
filtration efficiency, ηmask , can be determined from the ratio of particles per unit time detected
with, Nmask , and without the mask attached, Nambient , as

Our mask PFE test setup uses a Plantower PMS7003 sensor that is controlled via an ESP8266
WiFi micro controller unit. We used a Wemos D1 R2 WiFi capable ESP8266 based development
board for the Arduino IDE. The setup is externally powered via a standard micro USB port on the
ESP8266 board. This is connected to the PMS7003 sensor using a 1.27mm pitch IDC connector,
which supplies power and is also used for data transfer via serial communication.
A schematic of the setup and a photograph of the lab prototype are shown in Figs. 7 (a) and
(b), respectively. The PMS7003 is kept inside a small plastic box, with input and output provided
via standard 6 mm plastic tubes. We use 6 mm quick fit connectors all through the setup for ease
of assembly. We use an oil-free diaphragm pump (HSV-1, High Speed Appliances, Mumbai) that
provides a maximum flow of 30 lpm. The flow can be measured and controlled with a taper-tube

flow meter. For most experiments we used a flow of 10 lpm 8 , similar to typical human breathing
rates.
A critical design issue is that these sensors are designed to sample ambient air (with a small
internal fan) and do not have the ability to generate any suction pressure to draw air through a
face mask. Thus, some arrangement to force the air flow through the mask and past the sensor is
needed, which was done with a small diaphragm pump. It is of utmost importance to ensure that
the air being sucked through the mask is appropriately directed into the input port of the particle
counter sensor, to enable reliable measurements to be made. Further, the vacuum pump has to
sample air at the output port of the sensor, and ensure that the air flow is such that it does not
bypass the sensor. This can be conveniently achieved by using an appropriately sized divider plate
that sits tightly against the PMS7003 sensor chip and the box. This serves as a barrier between
output and input ports to prevent direct mixing, and ensures that the air flows through the sensor.
(See part marked as flow separator in Fig. 7 (d)). It is also important that the PMS7003 sensor
box and the input/output connectors are completely sealed to prevent any external air being sucked
into the box. We used a combination of tape and hot-glue for this purpose.

Source of particles
While typical room air has enough particles of 0.3µm size to enable PFE measurements on
N95 masks, air-conditioned laboratory environments often have filters that reduce the particulate
count significantly. In that case a much better signal to noise ratio in the measurements can be
achieved with intentionally enhanced particle counts in the local environment. This can easily be
done using normal saline (0.9% NaCl solution) in a standard medical nebulizer. We can obtain a
relatively constant background level with the nebulizer kept about 5 m away from the test setup.

Interfacing and user interface
The codes required for programming the ESP8266 based MCU board to interface with the
PMS7003 were written in the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and allow the
particle count data from the PMS7003 to be streamed to a local http web server as well as to a

We are aware of the ASTM test conditions for masks that specify a flow rate of 85 SLPM. However our setup is
mainly aimed to be a tool for quick evaluation of mask PFE, e.g. to check if a claimed N95 mask really meets the
specification, or to check before-and-after performance following decontamination treatments etc.

regions of particle count without and with the mask, and the calculated PFE is displayed. Similarly the data
statistics marker proves two vertical bars to demarcate a region for calculating the average and standard
deviation of particle counts.

local telnet server. A python code is used to access the real time data from the telnet server and
plot it, as well as apply the appropriate filters, analysis and PFE calculation tools.
The data transmitted from the ESP8266 module to the web server is visualized and analyzed
through a simple html interface that allows various parameters to be changed, including the particle
size channel, data acquisition rate, IP address etc. A snapshot of the mask tester user interface is
shown in Fig. 8. To ease the calculation of the PFE an intuitive user interface with an in-built
efficiency calculator has also been provided.
Another useful feature of our code is the ability to modify parameters (e.g. change WiFi name
and password, acquisition rate in seconds etc.) via OTA (over the air) updates through the WiFi
network without having to connecting the MCU physically to a computer. Detailed procedures are
available in the relevant section of the GitHub repository.
