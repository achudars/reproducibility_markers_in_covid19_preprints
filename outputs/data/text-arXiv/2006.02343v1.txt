Abstract
The in vitro antiviral activity of Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine (CQ)
against SARS-CoV-2 from the first month of pandemic proposed these drugs as the
appropriate therapeutic candidate, although their side effect directed the clinical test
toward optimizing the safe utilization strategies. The noble metal nanoparticles (NP)
as promising materials with antiviral and antibacterial properties can deliver the drug
to the target agent and decrease the side effect. In this work, we have applied quantum
mechanical and classical atomistic molecular dynamics computational approaches to
demonstrate the adsorption properties of HCQ on Ag, Au, AgAu, and Pt nanoparticles.
The adsorption energies(less than −30 kcal mol−1 ) were established for HCQ, and the
(non)perturbative effects of this drug on the plasmonic absorption spectra of AgNP and
AuNP have characterized with time-dependent density functional theory. The effect of
size and compositions of nanoparticle on the coating with HCQ and CQ have obtained
and proposed the appropriate candidate for drug delivery. This kind of modeling could
help the experimental groups to find the efficient and safe therapies.

Introduction

The pandemic coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has severely compromised healthcare system, and more than 300 clinical research group over the world focus on investigating the
potential therapeutic options for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. 1 Under the
global health crisis, one of the most rapid and reliable treatment is drug repurposing, means
examination of existing FDA approved drugs for new therapeutic purposes. 2 As development
of new drug into clinical candidate takes approximately 10 years, and vaccine development
process will take 12 to 18 months. However, the genetic sequence similarity of syndrome
coronavirus, SARC-CoV, to SARC-CoV-2 (or COVID-19) with nearly same structure in viral targets that might be inhibited by the same compounds makes the possibility of usage
the FDA approved antiviral drug for treatment. Chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine
(HCQ) have been used for many years as pharmacotherapies for malaria. It is believed that
these drugs inhibit SARS-CoV infection and have been labeled as a potential therapeutic
option against COVID-19. 3
The pre-clinical in vitro studies have done and showed the prophylactic and antiviral
effects of CQ and HCQ against SARS-CoV-2. 4–6 On the other hand, the recent clinical outcomes opinions advocated effect in preventing and treating COVID-19, but to make a clear
conclusion and optimizing safe therapeutic strategies, more examinations are desperately
needed. 7,8 It was established that these drugs by increasing the pH affects the viral replication. 9 However, the mechanism of action of HCQ/CQ against COVID-19 has not yet fully
elucidated, and it was known HCQ shares the same mechanism of action as CQ, and it is less
toxic. 3 However, a large scale and prolonged usage seems potentially dangerous and increased
the risk of drug-induced torsades de pointes and may lead to cardiac death. 10 Therefore, different treatment regimens try to focus on efficient in vivo usage of these drugs. 11,12
In this regards, nanomedicine as growing field of nanotechnology has a wide-spread application in pharmaceuticals and diagnostic devices. 13,14 Metal nanoparticles are well-known as
a promising material that able to transport drugs to specific targets in the body, and could
3

be engineered to develop new drug delivery systems. 15 Noble metals have been used as therapeutic agents from the ancient time in medicine. Noble metal nanoparticles particularly,
silver, gold and platinum nanoparticles are revealing the stability in biological environment
and survive in an intracellular. 16–18 The stable nanoparticles with small size reveal a benefit
that straightforwardly interact with biomolecules both at surface and inside cells, and play
major role in biomedical applications such as drug vehicle in diagnosis and treatment of
diseases. Silver has a long history of its usage as antibacterial properties, 19–22 and recent
studies utilized the antiviral and immunomodulatory properties of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). 23,24 Recently, R. P. Garofalo 25 and coworker, demonstrated in vivo antiviral activity
of AgNPs during respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection.
Under extended lockdown across the world, with no possibility of accessing to experimental laboratories full-time, the hard work is just beginning for computational chemists
and biophysicists to model different approaches and propose the efficient therapies to the
experimentalist. In this work, the first principle density functional calculations were carried
out to find out the affinity of HCQ/CQ molecules towards silver and gold nanoparticles, and
confirmed their weak interaction by theoretical UV-Vis absorption spectra. The complimentary calculations by changing the size and composition of metal nanoparticle and also the
number of coated HCQ molecule were done based on molecular dynamics simulations.

Computational Methods

For HCQ and CQ molecules, the geometry optimization and frequency calculation were performed with PBE generalized gradient (GGA) exchange-correlation (xc-) density functional 26
with inclusion of the Grimme dispersion correction scheme (D3) 27–29 applying Becke-Johnson
damping and a triple-ζ polarized (TZP) Slater type basis set (PBE-D3/TZP). The Conductor like Screening Model (COSMO) 30 was considered to model the effect of water solvent. For
the optimized structure the Hirshfeld point charges 31 and electrostatic potential map were

4

obtained with and without solvent (in Figure 1 and Figure S1 in supporting information).
The experimental interatomic metal-metal distance, was employed to create starting structures for further optimization with the LDA (local density approximation) xc-functional 32
and the scalar relativistic ZORA formalism. 33,34 The interactions of HCQ with icosahedral
silver and gold clusters with 147 atoms have been investigated at the PBE-D3/TZP level of
theory under the influence of relativistic effect (ZORA). To find out the effect of HCQ drug
on the electronic structures and the absorption plasmonic spectra of noble metal particle, the
recently developed time-dependent density functional approach, TD-DFT+TB method 35,36
which combines a full DFT ground state with tight-binding approximations, was applied.
The exited states calculations were performed at the optimized geometries by utilizing the
asymptotically corrected LB94 xc-functional 37 and obtained the absorption spectra in the
range of 0.0-6.0 eV. All these calculations were performed with the Amsterdam Density
Functional (ADF2019.1) program. 38
The adsorption of HCQ and CQ molecules on a periodic slab model of the Ag (111),
Au(111) and Pt(111) surfaces were simulated using the plane-wave based Quantum ESPRESSO
Package 39 with PBE-D3 26,27 functional. A plane-wave basis set with an energy cut-off of 80
Rydberg (∼ 1088 eV) has been employed and the electronion interactions were represented
through the ultrasoft pseudopotential including the scalar relativistic effects. Two layers of
Ag/Au/Pt atoms were considered with a total number of 36 atoms per layer. A large vacuum
of in the z direction (perpendicular to the bilayer) was applied and due to the large size of
the box, only the Γ-point of the reciprocal lattice was considered. During the calculations,
the internal slab atoms were kept fixed at the bulk positions while the atoms in the top layer
and molecule were allowed to relax.
The molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for interactions of HCQ and CQ with noble
metal nanoparticle (NP), Ag147 , Au147 , Au92 Ag55 and Pt147 were performed in a cubic box
 (Structures are available in Table S1–S6 in supporting informawith sides of 60 × 60 × 60A
tion). The nanoparticles fixed at the center of box which surrounded with randomly filled of

5

the water molecules and either HCQ or CQ drugs. The time step in the simulation was 2.0 fs
and the length of time is 20 ns, under the isothermal-isobaric NPT (constant particle number, pressure and temperature) condition at 300 K and 1 atm (controlled with Nose–Hoover
algorithm). The OPLS-AA 40 and TIP3P 41 force fields were used to describe the interactions of drugs and water molecules, respectively. Moreover, the Lennard-Jones parameters
for nanoparticles are listed in table S7. The electrostatic interactions were simulated with
the Particle-Particle Particle-Mesh (PPPM) 42 solver (with accuracy 1 × 10−5 ). The nonbonded dispersion interactions were computed with Lennard-Jones (LJ) 12-6 potential with

the cut-off distance of 12 A.
In order to study the effect of nanoparticle size, four different sizes of AgNPs with 147-,
561-, 1415-, 2869-atoms (with radius 1.6, 2.6, 3.6, and 4.6 nm, respectively), placed at the
simulation box with fixed (12) and different number of HCQ molecules (12, 32, 64, 105) that
increased proportionally with the number of silver atoms on the surface. The simulation box
filled with 6000 water molecules. All simulations were performed using the Gromos53a6 43
and SPC 41 force fields. The energy minimized by using the steepest descent minimization
algorithm. 44 Each system was equilibrated in both NVT ensemble coupled to the V-rescale
thermal bath at 300 K over 100 ps and in the NPT ensemble coupled to the Berendsen
pressure bath at 1 atm over 200 ps. Each system was then subjected to a 50 ns molecular
dynamics (MD) simulation under constant conditions of 1 atm and 300 K with a time step
of 1 fs. The bond lengths constrained using the LINCS algorithm 45 and the long-range
electrostatics using the particle mesh Ewald (PME) 46 were applied. The MD simulations
were carried out using the LAMMPS, 47 and GROMACS packages 48,49 and VMD package 50
was used for visualization.

Results and Discussion

Interaction of AgNP and AuNP with HCQ(CQ). The charge distribution
of HCQ and CQ molecules and their electrostatic potential map in Figure 1 displays the
active sites of these molecules for interaction with noble metal NPs. The initial structure of
complexes generated by placing the small silver cluster near the electron-rich sites (such as
N-, O- and Cl- groups). These sites can donate the electron density via their lone pairs to 4d
and 5s orbitals of silver atom. 51,52 For the CQ and HCQ, the nitrogen of pyridine ring and
(for HCQ) the oxygen of hydroxyl group have the highest affinity for interaction with noble
metal clusters. Moreover, the optimized structure of HCQ/CQ on Ag(111), Au(111), and
Pt(111) bilayer exhibited the highest affinity of drug molecules toward the platinum surface
and their charge density difference confirmed the transferred of charge and accumulation on
the metal surface (see Figure 2 and also Table S8 in supporting information).
In addition, Figure 1 shows the stable geometry of icosahedral Ag147 and Au147 nanoparticles which complexed with HCQ molecules (at PBE-D3/TZP level of theory). Herein,
the non-covalent charge-transfer interactions with partially negative charge groups of the
molecules plays the essential role in determining the ability of nanoparticle to catching
HCQ(CQ). The binding energy of HCQ with AgNP (at PBE-D3/TZP level of theory) is
about ∆Eb = −21.06 kcal mol−1 , (per number of HCQ molecule,) while, for AuNP the interaction energy is about ∆Eb = −29.39 kcal mol−1 that is more favorable than silver. The
more electron affinity of gold (EAAu = 2.31 eV) with respect to silver (EAAg = 1.30 eV) 53
increases the interactions energy of gold atoms toward the lone-pair of HCQ, which is also
confirmed with density difference map and accumulation of negative charge on the Au(111)
surface. In this regard, the adsorption energy of HCQ toward Pt(111) is about 40% more
than gold surface. (see Figure 2 and Table S8).

Absorption Spectra of AgNP and AuNP with HCQ. The absorption
spectra of bare nanoparticle and its variation under the effect of coated compounds is another important evidence that can be compared with the experimental results, and estimate
7

accurately the effect of adsorbent molecules on the variation of electronic structures of metal
NP. Silver and gold nanoparticle are well-known with their high-intensity plasmonic absorption spectra in the range of UV-Vis that can be varied by coating with drugs. Herein,
the TD-DFT+TB calculations for the optimized AgNP-HCQ and AuNP-HCQ complexes in
comparison to bare nanoparticles were obtained. TD-DFT+TB as an accurate and efficient
approach, obtained the ground-state orbitals with DFT and excited-state properties with
tight-binding method. As can be found in Figure 3, for AgNP-HCQ complex, the plasmonic spectrum in comparison to bare AgNP did not change clearly and just the intensity
of peaks around 5.5 eV damped slightly. On the other hand, for AuNP-HCQ complex after
the adsorption of HCQ the plasmonic peak of gold in the range of 4.0 – 4.5 eV exhibited
the obvious variation in term of energy and intensity and shifting to blue, that established
the more perturbative effect of HCQ adsorption on the electronic structure and plasmonic
spectrum of gold nanoparticle in comparison to silver.

AgNP, AuNP, AgAuNP, and PtNP Coated with HCQ(CQ). In this
part the effect of changing the type of nanoparticles and increasing the number of HCQ
molecules on the coating properties of nanoparticles are discussed based on the radial distribution function (RDF). RDF depicts how the density of one molecule changes as a function
of distance from another reference molecule. In addition, the RDF can be used to represent
the distance-dependent relative probability for observing a given site or atom relative to
some central site or atom. This analysis provides the microstructure information about the
arrangement of HCQ/CQ molecules as well as their affinity for interactions with nanoparticles. 54–56
Figure 4 displays the RDF, g(r), for the active sites of HCQ/CQ molecules with different
type of (147-atomic icosahedral) nanoparticles such as AgNP, AuNP, AgAuNP, and PtNP.
As can be found in Figure 4, the nitrogen of pyridine ring has the highest affinity in comparison to other type of nitrogen that is in agreement with DFT calculation (in the previous
section). However, it seems in Figure 4, the peak of chlorine grows up same as nitrogen,

8

that can be related to its vicinity to nitrogen atom of pyridine ring and not the affinity of
Cl-group. The optimized structure of DFT and the lower negative charge of Cl (-0.03 |e|)
in comparison to N (-0.17 |e|) are the acceptable reasons for this claim. In addition, the
coating of Ag147 with more HCQ molecules have simulated (in Figure S5) and confirmed
the higher g(r) for N- respect to Cl-group. Furthermore, the O-atom of hydroxyl group is
another active site of HCQ for interaction, however, for gold, silver and alloy nanoparticle,
the g(r) values for O-group is lower than N-group and for PtNP, its g(r) is slightly more
than N-group. The more attraction of N-atom (verse O-group) for interaction with gold and
silver noble metal was established by A. Antusek et al based on ab-initio calculation. 57 The
probability distribution map of atoms near the nanoparticles (see Figure S2S3 in supporting
information), has confirmed the RDF results.
Figure 5 compares the total and atom type RDFs of HCQ/CQ molecules with respect
to the variation of nanoparticles to propose the possible candidates for adsorption. Figure
5 (a), Figure 5 (b), and Figure 5 (c) compare the RDF of N- and O-atom of HCQ and
N-atom of CQ with respect to the type of nanoparticles. For N-group the affinity of different
type of nanoparticles is nearly similar to each other, although PtNP has strong numerous

group with PtNP which is appeared in the shorter distance demonstrates the best adsorption
properties on PtNP and also explains the stronger affinity of PtNP to HCQ compare to CQ.
Accordingly, we can conclude that HCQ preferred to adsorb on AuNP, AgNP and alloy from
one side and coated on PtNP by N- and O-group.
Finally, Figure 5 (d) and Figure 5 (e) show the total RDF plots of HCQ and CQ molecules
with respect to type of nanoparticles, respectively and represents the overall coating trend as
follow: PtNP > AuNP > AuAgNP > AgNP. In addition, comparing the total RDF of NPs
with HCQ and CQ (Figure 5 (f)) indicates that PtNP has a bigger g(r) for HCQ compare
to CQ which is in agreement with our DFT results presented in Table S8.

Coated HCQ on Different Size of AgnNP (n = 147, 561, 1415,
and 2869). The effect of size on the adsorption properties of AgNP has investigated
for the fixed number of HCQ (12 molecules) that interacted with twelve active sites in the
corners of icosahedral AgNP and also different number of HCQ that increased (to 32, 64, 105
molecules) proportional to the numbers of AgNP surface atoms. The radius of Ag147 , Ag561 ,
Ag1415 and Ag2869 nanoparticles is calculated to be 1.6, 2.6, 3.6, and 4.6, nm respectively
while their thickness after coating with HCQ has been increased about 1 nm.
Figure S4 shows the coated nanoparticles with HCQ molecules exhibited the significant
fluctuation within at the beginning of the simulations (∼ 5 ns ), indicating HCQ molecules
are moving free near nanoparticles due to spatial setting of the medicines in the active
site. After the fluctuation, it maintained a continuous equilibrium up to the end of the
simulation time. These results suggest that the stabilities of the dynamic equilibriums for
the complexes were reliable and that the trajectories could be useful in collecting snapshots
for further analyses (see Figure S4).
In Figure 6 (and Figure S5 and S6) the RDF plots for the fixed and different number
of HCQ with respect to the size of AgNPs and type of anchoring atoms are displayed. The
comparison of RDF plots for the N-group as an active-site (Figure 6 (b)), in addition to all
atoms (Figure 6 (a)) exhibited the decreasing in the adsorption properties by going from small
to larger AgNPs. The same trend was reproduced in Figure 6 (c) and Figure 6 (d) in which
the portion of HCQs increased with respect to the number of surface’s atoms. Generally,
the overall coating properties decreases about 65-85% by increasing the size of nanoparticle
from 1.6 to 4.6 nm, see Figure S7. It has been established that the affinity of noble metal
clusters enhanced by decreasing the size. Moreover, in agreement with the previous section
the N-group has the higher affinity for interaction with different size of AgNPs with respect
to O-group (see Figure S5 and S6). Finally, Figure S8 shows the RDF comparison for HCQ
and CQ coated on Ag2869 , and reveals the appropriate adsorption affinity of HCQ versus
CQ.

Conclusion

In summary, the adsorption properties of noble metal nanoparticles and their coating with
HCQ/CQ as the promising candidate for COVID-19 treatment have been studied. The
weak charge-transfer interaction with partially negative charge N- and O-group of drugs
that increased by changing the type of metal nanoparticles element (PtNP > AuNP >
AuAgNP > AgNP) have been investigated. Finally, this kind of combining the quantum
mechanics and molecular dynamic simulation can be suggesting these noble nanoparticles
(with low toxicity and antiviral activity) as the vehicle for efficient usage of HCQ/CQ and
decreased the drugs side effect.
