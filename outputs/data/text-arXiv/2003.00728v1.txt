Abstract
The outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) caused thousands of deaths
worldwide, and the number of total infections is still rising. However, the development of
effective vaccine for this novel virus would take a few months. Thus it is urgent to identify some
potentially effective old drugs that can be used immediately. Fortunately, some compounds that
can inhibit coronavirus in vitro have been reported. In this study, the coronavirus-specific dataset
was used to fine-tune our pre-trained multi-task deep model. Next we used the re-trained model to
select available commercial drugs against targeted proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The results show that
abacavir, a powerful nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor used to treat HIV, is
predicted to have high binding affinity with several proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Almitrine mesylate
and roflumilast which are used for respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease are also predicted to have inhibitory effect. Overall, ten drugs are listed as potential
inhibitors and the important sites for these binding by our model are exhibited. We hope these
results would be useful in the fight against SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction
Since December 2019, cases with pneumonia of unknown cause have been reported in Wuhan,
China[1]. A novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from the infections, which is the
seventh member of the family of coronaviruses that infect humans[1, 2]. Similar to MERS-CoV
and SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory diseases and is capable of spreading from
person to person. As of March 2 2020, there have been more than 87,000 confirmed SARS-CoV-2
infections worldwide, including more than 2900 deaths. Unfortunately, the development of
effective vaccine against such novel virus would take a few months. Thus it is urgent to find some
effective approved drugs that can be used quickly, which is “drug-repurposing”. As a
positive-sense, single-stranded RNA beta-coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 encodes structural,

non-structural and accessory proteins. Among these, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp),
3-chymotrypsin-like (3CL) protease, papain-like protease, helicase and spike glycoprotein are
supposed to be the main targets. Several compounds that targeted these viral proteins and inhibited
coronavirus in vitro have been reported and moved into clinical trials[3]. For example, remdesivir
is an approved HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitor, which has broad-spectrum activities against
RNA viruses such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but showed less effective in a Ebola clinical
trial[4–6]. Recent reports showed that remdesivir inhibited SARS-CoV-2 in vitro with
EC50=0.77μM[7], and was used to treat a SARS-CoV-2 infected patient in the United States[8].
The clinical trial of remdesivir for SARS-CoV-2 is currently underway in China. Obviously, more
potential inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 are still needed.
Computational methods for screening potential positive compounds to target protein actually
improve the success rates of drug discovery. Recently, methods based on deep learning have
gained impressive performance on protein-ligand binding prediction[9–11]. The main advantage
of this algorithm is that it can extract useful features automatically from the raw data during the
process of training. But the generalization of deep learning model is also limited by the lack of
specific data. Importantly, the reported virus inhibitors can be used to readjusting the model so it
would have higher accuracy.
In this study, our pre-trained multi-task deep model is used to predict possible drugs against
SARS-CoV-2. First, we fine-tune our previous model by a coronavirus specific dataset. Then a
dataset contained 4895 commercially drugs is used to screen against eight potential protein targets
of SARS-CoV-2 using the re-trained model. Drugs with high predicted affinities are listed as the
potential inhibitors. Besides, the important sites for binding by our model also exhibited. We hope
these predictions would be useful in the fight against SARS-CoV-2.

Methods
Data
Total eight viral proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are used as potential targets, including RNA-dependent
RNA polymerase (RdRp), 3-chymotrypsin-like (3CL) protease, papain-like protease, helicase,
spike glycoprotein, exonuclease, endoRNAse, 2'-O-ribose methyltransferase and envelope protein.
The amino acid sequences of these proteins are extracted from NCBI (NC_045512.2). The
virus-specific

dataset

is

achieved

from

GHDDI

with

filtration

(https://ghddi-ailab.github.io/Targeting2019-nCoV). Only samples with exact binding target and
affinity are saved. The commercially drug dataset contained 4895 samples is used to screen
potential inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2. All data that present in the training and fine-tune datasets are
excluded.

Model and fine-tune
Basically, our model consists of two parts: shared layers and task-specific layers. The shared
layers are designed to learn a joint representation for all tasks. Task-specific layers use the joint
representation to learn the weights of specific blocks based on specific tasks. In this study, two
related tasks are defined: binary classification and regression. More details would be added in the
next version. This model was previously trained by large amounts of data from various
heterogeneous protein-ligand datasets (unpublished). In this study the model is fine-tuned by
virus-specific dataset to acquire robust results for coronavirus.
After being re-trained, the model predicts the possible binding between commercially drugs and
protein targets. The output of the model is the score to estimate binding affinity (pKa) between
drug and target, the higher score the stronger binding. Drugs with high predicted affinities are
listed as the potential inhibitors.

Binding sites prediction
A non-parametric method “occlusion” used in our previous study (unpublished) is applied to
explore which parts of the input sequences are critical to the task. Briefly, si from test samples (i =
0, 1, 2, ..., n-1, here n is sample size of test set) is expressed as tuple (protein input_i, compound
input_i). While maintaining compound input_i unchanged, we systematically mask the protein
input_i in si to track the changes of the output. Then the importance of each sub-sequence in the
sequence to the prediction can be calculated.

Results and discussion
Potential inhibitors
Recently, several SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors have been reported[3, 7]. There have been more than 16
registered clinical trials with drugs against COVID-19, as of Feb.18 2020. Among these, lopinavir,
ritonavir, methylprednisolone, favipiravir and umifenovir (arbidol) have been used in multiple
trials. Chloroquine phosphate, azvudine and remdesivir are used in the most recent trials.
Favipiravir, ribavirin and remdesivir are supposed to target to viral RdRp. Disulfiram inhibits
papain-like protease whereas lopinavir and ritonavir inhibit 3CL protease. Obviously, RdRp, 3CL
protease and papain-like protease are three main targets of coronavirus.
In this study, after model prediction, top 10 potential drugs of each target are selected, then the
drugs that may have strong side effect or are not available are excluded. After manual selection,
total 10 drugs with high probability of inhibition are listed in table 1. Among these, abacavir

(sulfate), a powerful nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor used to treat HIV, is
predicted to have high binding affinity with multiple proteins of SARS-CoV-2 including RdRp,
3CL protease, papain-like protease and helicase. Darunavir, a protease inhibitor used to treat HIV,
was used in a clinical trial against COVID-19 (ChiCTR2000029541). It should be noted that, both
darunavir and darunavir (ethanolate) are not present in training set but only in test set. Our model
predicted that darunavir can target to 3CL protease, RdRp and papain-like protease with affinity
Kd= 57.30, 6.09 and 46.16 nM respectively. While darunavir (ethanolate) binds to 3CL protease,
RdRp and papain-like protease with affinity Kd= 44.51, 4.73 and 35.86 nM respectively. These
results partially prove the accuracy of our model. In our predictions, almitrine mesylate, which is a
respiratory stimulant that enhances respiration, is used in the treatment of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease. While roflumilast has anti-inflammatory effects and is used as an orally
administered drug for the treatment of inflammatory conditions of the lungs such as chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease. These two predicted drugs are associated with respiratory
symptoms that are the main clinical symptoms of COVID-19. Interestingly, kesuting syrup and
keqing capsule were used in a trial for treatment of mild and moderate COVID-19
(ChiCTR2000029991). It is uncertain whether these drugs only help to alleviate clinical symptoms
or have direct effect on virus. Daclatasvir is used against Hepatitis C Virus, which stops HCV viral
RNA replication and protein translation by directly inhibiting HCV protein NS5A. In this study,
the predicted binding affinity between daclatasvir and RdRp is 15.03nM. Fiboflapon sodium, a
high affinity 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein inhibitor used for the treatment of asthma, is
predicted to have potential affinity to Papain-like protease with Kd= 197.63nM.

Biological interpretation
To explore how the model processes the biological data, we conduct a method to identify the key
amino acids that are important for binding. The listed potential inhibitors are regarded as positive
samples with high prediction score. Then we mask sub-sequences of sample to get a “masked”
prediction score, and thus calculate the importance of the masked sub-sequences. As shown in
Fig.1, the critical parts for binding in protein sequences are visualized through heat-map. For
3C-like proteinase, the important amino acids for binding present at three main locations. It should
be noted that different drugs result in different weights of these three regions. For example,
roflumilast has higher weights in the first two regions, which indicates the binding sites for
roflumilast are close to the middle pocket of 3C-like proteinase. As for abacavir (sulfate), the three
regions more or less affect the binding, especially the second region at 180-200th amino acids. For
papain-like protease, the predicted binding sites locate at 100-120th amino acid positions. And
regions at 500-584th amino acids are predicted to be important binding sites for RdRp.

protease; (c) RdRp. (The abscissa axis is the length of protein sequences.)

Moreover, we visualize the predicted binding sites in 3D structures to show possible pockets. The
3C-like proteinase of SARS-CoV-2 (PDB: 6lu7) released on 5 February 2020 is used. The 3D
structures of papain-like protease and RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 are unavailable, thus the homology
models of these two proteins are used in this study[12, 13]. As mentioned above, three regions

contribute to the binding. As shown in Fig.2 (a), the region in the middle part (180-200th amino
acids) is the main pocket because of high weight in most predictions by our model. The
papain-like protease of SARS-CoV-2 is highly homologous to papain-like protease of SARS.
Stoermer used a SARS crystal structure template (PDB:5tl6) to prepare homology model of
SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease, with a catalytic triad composed of Cys114-His275-Asp289 and
a conventional zinc-binding domain of 4 cysteine residues Cys192, Cys194, Cys227, Cys229[12].
In his study, the central “thumb” domain contributes the catalytic Cys112 to the active site.
Similarly, our model predicts that 100-120th amino acids contribute mainly to the final binding of
small molecules. As for RdRp, two possible pockets are also shown in Fig.2 (c).

Conclusion
In this work, a multi-task model is used to predict potential commercially drugs against
SARS-CoV-2. We fine-tune the pre-trained model using some reported samples for coronavirus.
After manual selection, 10 drugs are finally listed as potential SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. Nowadays
several drugs have been reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and moved into clinical trials
against COVID-19. But more available drugs are still needed, taking into account with factors
including therapeutic effect, side effect, drug cost and drug production rate. One common problem
for deep model is the lacking of interpretability, especially for biological problem. So we exhibit
the predicted binding sites, which are thought to be important for binding by our model.
Unfortunately, the number of global infections is still rising, the COVID-19 crisis grow into a
worldwide emergency. We hope the prediction by our model would be useful in this fight.
