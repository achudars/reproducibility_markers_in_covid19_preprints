The current outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an unprecedented example
of how fast an infectious disease can spread around the globe (especially in urban areas) and the
enormous impact it causes on public health and socio-economic activities. Despite the recent surge
of investigations about different aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we still know little about the
effects of city size on the propagation of this disease in urban areas. Here we investigate how the
number of cases and deaths by COVID-19 scale with the population of Brazilian cities. Our results
indicate small towns are proportionally more affected by COVID-19 during the initial spread of
the disease, such that the cumulative numbers of cases and deaths per capita initially decrease
with population size. However, during the long-term course of the pandemic, this urban advantage
vanishes and large cities start to exhibit higher incidence of cases and deaths, such that every 1%
rise in population is associated with a 0.14% increase in the number of fatalities per capita after
about four months since the first two daily deaths. We argue that these patterns may be related to
the existence of proportionally more health infrastructure in the largest cities and a lower proportion
of older adults in large urban areas. We also find the initial growth rate of cases and deaths to be
higher in large cities; however, these growth rates tend to decrease in large cities and to increase in
small ones over time.
INTRODUCTION

Human activities have become increasingly concentrated in urban areas. A direct consequence of this worldwide urbanization process is that more people are living
in cities than in rural regions since 2007 [1], and projections indicate that the world urban population could
reach more than 90% by the end of this century [2]. Besides being increasingly urbanized, we live in an unprecedentedly connected, and highly mobile world with air
passengers exceeding 4 billion in 2018 [3]. On the one
hand, a highly connected and highly urbanized society
brought us innovation, economic growth, more access to
education and healthcare; on the other, it has also lead to
pollution, environmental degradation, privacy concerns,
more people living in substandard conditions, and suitable conditions for dissemination of infectious diseases
over the globe. In particular, the emergence of infectious
disease outbreaks has significantly increased over time,
and the majority of these events are caused by pathogens
originating in wildlife [4], which in turn has been associated with changes in environmental conditions and land
use, agricultural practices, and the rise of large human
population settlements [5].
The ongoing outbreak of the novel coronavirus (SARSCoV-2) seems to fit well the previous context as it was
first identified in Wuhan in December 2019, an influential Chinese city exceeding 11 million inhabitants, and

apparently originated from the recombination of bat and
Malayan pangolin coronaviruses [6]. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) initially spread in Mainland China
but rapidly caused outbreaks in other countries, making
the World Health Organization first declare a “Public
Health Emergency of International Concern” in January
2020, and in mid-March, the outbreak was reclassified
as a pandemic. As of 16 August 2020, over 21.2 million cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in almost
all countries, and the worldwide death toll exceeds 761
thousand people [7]. The COVID-19 pandemic poses unprecedented health and economic threats to our society,
and understanding its spreading patterns may find important factors for mitigating or controlling the outbreak.
Recent works have focused on modeling the initial
spreading of COVID-19 [8] or the fatality curves [9], projecting the outbreak peak and hospital utilization [10],
understanding the effects of mobility [11], demography [12], travel restrictions [13], behavior change on the
virus transmission [14], mitigation strategies [15], nonpharmaceutical interventions [16], network-based strategies for social distancing [17], among many others. Despite the increasing surge of scientific investigations on
the subject, little attention has been paid to understanding the effects of city size on spreading patterns
of cases and deaths by COVID-19 in urban areas. The
idea that size (as measured by population) affects different city indicators has been extensively studied and
can be summarized by the urban scaling hypothesis [18–
21]. This theory states that urban indicators are nonlinearly associated with city population such that socioeconomic indicators tend to present increasing returns

2
to scale [18, 22, 23], infrastructure indicators often display economy of scale [18, 19], and quantities related to
individual needs usually scale linearly with city population [18, 19].
Urban scaling studies of health-related quantities have
shown that the incidence and mortality of diseases are
non-linearly related to the city population [24–27]. Despite the existence of several exceptions [27], noninfectious diseases (such as diabetes) are usually less prevalent
in large cities, while infectious diseases (such as AIDS)
are relatively more common in large urban areas. This
different behavior is likely to reflect the fact that people living in large cities tend to have proportionally more
contacts and a higher degree of social interactions than
those living in small towns [19, 28]. Within this context,
the recent work of Stier, Berman, and Bettencourt [29]
has indicated that large cities in the United States experienced more pronounced growth rates of COVID-19 cases
during the first weeks after the introduction of the disease. Similarly, Cardoso and Gonçalves [30] found that
the per capita contact rate of COVID-19 increases with
the size and density of cities in United States, Brazil
and Germany. These findings have serious consequences
for the evolution of COVID-19 and suggest that large
metropolises may become infection hubs with potentially
higher and earlier peaks of infected people. Investigating whether this behavior generalizes to other places and
how different quantities such as the number of cases and
deaths scale with city size are thus important elements
for a better understanding of the spreading of COVID-19
in urban areas.
Here we investigate how population size is associated
with cases and deaths by COVID-19 in Brazilian cities.
Brazil is the sixth most populous country in the world,
with over 211 million people, of which more than 85% live
in urban areas. While it is likely that the novel coronavirus was already circulating in Brazil in early February
2020 [31], the first confirmed case in the country dates
back to 26 February 2020, in the city of São Paulo. Between the first case and 12 August 2020, Brazil has confirmed 3,088,670 cases of COVID-19 (second-largest number) spread out over 98.9% of the 5,570 Brazilian cities.
This disease caused 102,817 deaths (second-largest number) with 3,892 cities reporting at least one casualty as
of 12 August 2020.

RESULTS

We start by briefly presenting our data set (see Methods for details). Our investigations rely on the daily reports published by the Health Offices of each of the 27
Brazilian federative units. These daily reports update
the number of confirmed cases (Yc ) and the number of
deaths (Yd ) caused by COVID-19 in every Brazilian city
from 25 February 2020 (date of the first case in Brazil)
to 12 August 2020 (date of our last update). From these
data, we create time series of the number of cases Yc (tc )

for each city, where tc refers to the number of days since
the first two daily cases reported in each city. Similarly,
we create time series of the number of deaths Yd (td ),
where td refers to the number of days since the first two
daily deaths reported in each city. By doing so, we group
all cities according to their stage of disease propagation
(as measured by tc or td ) to investigate the evolution
of allometric relationships between total cases or deaths
and city population. We have also considered different
number of daily cases or deaths as the reference point,
and our results are robust against different choices (from
one to seven daily cases or daily deaths, see Figures 1-14
in S1 Appendix).
Figure 1A shows the relation between cases of COVID19 and city population on a logarithmic scale (log Yc versus log P ) for different numbers of days since the first two
daily cases (tc = 15, 58, 101 and 141 days). The approximately linear behavior on logarithmic scale indicates that
the number of cases is well described by a power-law function of the city population
Yc ∼ P βc ,

(1)

where βc is the so-called urban scaling exponent [18].
Similarly, Figure 1B shows the association between the
number of casualties and the city population on logarithmic scale (log Yd versus log P ) for different numbers of
days since two daily deaths first reported (td = 15, 50, 85
and 120 days). Again, the results indicate that the number of deaths is approximated by a power-function of the
city population
Yd ∼ P βd ,

(2)

where βd represents the urban scaling exponent for the
number of deaths.
The results of Figure 1 also show the adjusted allometric relationships (dashed lines) and the best fitting
scaling exponents βc and βd (see Methods for datails).
These exponents exhibit an increasing trend with time
so that βc and βd exceed one after some number of days
after the first two daily cases or deaths. This dynamic
behavior is better visualized in Figure 2, where we depict
βc and βd as a function of the number of days since the
first two daily cases (tc ) or deaths (td ). The scaling exponent for the number of cases βc is sub-linear (βc < 1)
during the first four months and appears to approach a
super-linear plateau (βc > 1) as the number of days tc
further increases. The dynamic behavior of the scaling
exponent for deaths βd is similar to βc ; however, βd appears to be approaching a plateau larger than the one
observed for βc .
The evolution of the scaling exponents for cases and
deaths indicates that small cities are proportionally more
affected by COVID-19 during the first four months. However, this initial apparent advantage of living in large
cities vanishes with time, and become a disadvantage after about four months. This is more evident by estimating the number of cases per capita from Eq. (1), that is,

FIG. 1. Urban scaling relations of COVID-19 cases and deaths. (A) Relationship between the total of confirmed cases
of COVID-19 (Yc ) and city population (P ) on logarithmic scale. Panels show scaling relations for the number of cases on a
particular day after the first two daily cases reported in each city (four evenly spaced values of tc between 15 days and the
largest value yielding at least 50 cities, as indicated within panels). (B) Relationship between the total of deaths caused by
COVID-19 (Yd ) and population (P ) of Brazilian cities (on logarithmic scale). Panels show scaling relations for the number of
deaths on a particular day after the first two daily deaths reported in each city (four evenly spaced values of td between 15
days and the largest value yielding at least 50 cities, as indicated within panels). In all panels, the markers represent cities and
the dashed lines are the adjusted scaling relations with best-fitting exponents indicated in each plot (βc for cases and βd for
deaths).

Yc /P ∼ P βc −1 . Similarly, we can estimate the number of
deaths per capita from Eq. (2), yielding Yd /P ∼ P βd −1 .
Thus, we expect the number of COVID-19 cases or deaths
per capita to decrease with the city population if βc < 1
and βd < 1; conversely, these per capita numbers are expected to increase with the city population if βc > 1 and
βd > 1. For instance, because βc ≈ 0.77 and βd ≈ 0.85
after 75 days since the first two daily cases or deaths, the
number of cases and deaths per capita decreases with
population as Yc /P ∼ P −0.23 and Yc /P ∼ P −0.15 . At those
particular values of tc and td , an 1% rise in the population
is associated with a ≈ 0.23% decrease in the incidence of
COVID-19 cases and ≈ 0.15% reduction in the incidence
of deaths. In a concrete example for tc = td = 75 days, we
expect a metropolis such as São Paulo (with ≈ 12 million
people) to have ≈ 54% less cases and ≈ 39% less deaths
per capita than a medium-sized city such as Maringá/PR
(with ≈ 420 thousand people, ≈ 1/30 of São Paulo), which
in turn is expected to have ≈ 41% less cases and ≈ 29%
less deaths per capita than a small-sized city such as
Paranaı́ba/MS (with ≈ 42 thousand people, ≈ 1/10 of
Maringá).
However, both scaling exponents increase with time,
such that this urban advantage vanishes and become a
disadvantage during the long course of the pandemic.
By considering our latest estimates for the scaling exponents, we find βc ≈ 1.04 (tc = 144 days) and βd ≈ 1.12
(td = 120 days). Thus, at these particular values of tc and

td , we expect the number of cases per capita to slightly
increase with population (Yc /P ∼ P 0.04 ) and the number of fatalities per capita to increase with population as
Yd /P ∼ P 0.12 . Thus, for βd ≈ 1.12 at td = 120 days, we expect a metropolis such as São Paulo (≈ 12 million people)
to have ≈ 50% more deaths per capita than Maringá/PR
(≈ 420 thousand people), which in turn is expected to
have ≈ 32% more deaths per capita than Paranaı́ba/MS
(≈ 42 thousand people). Figures 8-14 in S1 Appendix
show that the scaling relations for number of cases and
deaths per capita support the previous discussions.
The latest estimates of βc found for cases of COVID19 are smaller than those reported for the 2009 H1N1
Pandemic in Brazil (βc ≈ 1.2) and HIV in Brazil and
United States (βc ≈ 1.4) [27]. Similarly to what we observe for the cases of COVID-19, the allometric exponent
for HIV cases in Brazil was initially sub-linear during the
1980s, became super-linear after the 1990s, and started
to approach a super-linear plateau after the 2000s [27].
However, the evolution of the allometry for HIV has been
much slower than what we have observed for the COVID19. Another interesting point reported by Rocha, Thorson, and Lambiotte [27] is that the number of H1N1 cases
in Brazil started to scale linearly with city population
in 2010 (one year after the first outbreak). These authors also argue that this reduction in the scaling exponent possibly reflects a better response for the spread of
H1N1 after the pandemic outbreak. If the behavior ob-

FIG. 2. Time dependence of the scaling exponents for COVID-19 cases and deaths. (A) Dependence of the exponent

errors, and the horizontal dashed lines indicate the isometric scaling (βc = βd = 1). We note that βc and βd increase with time
and appear to approach asymptotic values larger than one.

served in the 2009 H1N1 Pandemic generalizes (at least
in part) for the current COVID-19 pandemic, we would
expect a decrease in values of βc in the future. The
lastest estimates of βd for COVID-19 deaths are larger
than those reported for diabetes (βd ≈ 0.8), heart attack
(βd ≈ 1) and cerebrovascular accident (βd ≈ 1) in Brazil
after the 2000s [27]. Conversely, scaling exponents related to disease mortality in Brazil displayed a decreasing
trend with time, and values as high as 1.25 were observed
for diabetes in 1996 (βd ≈ 1.22) and heart attack in 1981
(βd ≈ 1.25) [27]. The convergence of these exponents to
linear or sub-linear regimes may reflect the increasing access to medical facilities in urban areas [27].
Based on currently available data (Figure 2), it is hard
to confidently assert whether the values of βc and βd will
remain larger than one during the long-term course of the
pandemic. However, the persistence of this behavior indicates large cities are likely to be more affected at the end
of the COVID-19 outbreak. Part of this behavior may be
due to large cities testing for COVID-19 proportionally
more than small ones. Results for the United States indicate that more rural states have lower testing rates and
detect disproportionately fewer cases of COVID-19 [32].
As Brazilian cities are likely to suffer from this bias, we
would expect a decrease in the scaling exponent βc after
the observed increasing trend depending on the magnitude of this effect (that is, as small cities increase their
testing capabilities, their number of cases tend to increase
and bend the scaling law downwards).
On the other hand, it is clearer that large cities were
proportionately less affected during the initial months
(since the first two daily cases or deaths) of the pandemic. We believe there are at least two possible explanations for this behavior. First, it may reflect an “increasing urban advantage” where the larger the city, the
more access to medical facilities and so the chance of
receiving more appropriate treatment against the coronavirus disease. A second cause can be associated with age
demographic changes with the city population; specifi-

cally, a smaller proportion of older adults at high risk for
severe illness and death from COVID-19 leads to a reduced number of deaths per capita. Another possibility
is that the strategies and policy responses of large and
small cities to COVID-19 are different, which in turn
may lead to different efficiency in containing the pandemic. These responses are highly heterogeneous at the
national level [33, 34] as well as among counties in the
United States [35]. Among these three possibilities, we
did not explore the possible effects of different city strategies against the COVID-19, but in light of the findings
for the United States [35], this effect is likely to play
an important role in the Brazilian case and may deserve
further investigation.
To test for an increasing urban advantage for the treatment of COVID-19 during the initial spread of the disease, we investigate the scaling relation between the
number of hospital intensive care unit (ICU) beds and
city population. Because critically ill patients frequently
require mechanical ventilation [36, 37], the number of
ICU beds has proved to be crucial for the treatment of
COVID-19. Figure 3A shows the allometric relationship
between the number of ICU beds from private and public health systems (Yicu , as of April 2020) and the population, where a super-linear relationship emerges with
scaling exponent βicu ≈ 1.16. The super-linear scaling
of ICU beds indicates that large Brazilian cities are better structured to deal with critically ill patients, which
in turn may partially explain the reduction of deaths
per capita with the city size during the initial three-four
months since the first two daily deaths. It is worth noting
that the Brazilian Public Unified Health System (Sistema
Único de Saúde – SUS) is decentralized and composed
of “health regions”, contiguous groups of cities usually
formed by a large city and its neighboring cities [38].
Cities within the same health region may share medical
services, which may in turn partially explain the reduction of the structural advantages of large urban areas

FIG. 3. Urban scaling of ICU beds, high-risk and low-risk populations. (A) Relationship between the number of ICU
beds (Yicu ) and the city population (P ) on logarithmic scale. We observe that the number of ICU beds scales super-linearly
with city size (βicu = 1.16 ± 0.02), indicating an urban advantage for health coverage. (B) Relationship between the highrisk population (Phr , defined as adults older than 60 years) and the city population (P ) on logarithmic scale. The high-risk
population scales sub-linearly (βhr = 0.910 ± 0.003), showing that large cities tend to have smaller fractions of elderly than small
cities. (C) Relationship between low-risk population (Plr , defined as adults younger than 60 years) and the city population (P )
on logarithmic scale. We note that the low-risk population scales almost linearly (βhr = 1.0100 ± 0.0004) with city size. The
behavior of these three quantities partially explains the initial decrease of number of deaths per capita with population (βd < 1
for td ≲ 100 days). See Figure 15 in S1 Appendix for the scaling relations involving per capita quantities.

during the long-term course of the pandemic.
We have also investigated how age demographic distribution changes with city population. Estimates have
shown that the case fatality rate of COVID-19 is substantially higher in people aged more than 60 years (0.32% for
those younger than 60 years versus 6.5% for those older
than 60 years [39]). Thus, the age demographic of cities
represents an important factor for the number of deaths
caused by COVID-19. Figures 3B and 3C show how the
number of people older (Phr , the high-risk population)
and younger (Plr , the low-risk population) than 60 years
change with the total population (P ). We note that the
high-risk population increases sub-linearly with city size
with an exponent βhr ≈ 0.91, while the low-risk population scales linearly (βlr ≈ 1) with city size. This result
shows that large cities have a lower prevalence of adults
older than 60 years, such that a 1% increase in city population is associated with a 0.91% rise in the high-risk
population. In a more concrete example, we expect a
city with one million people to have proportionally ≈ 19%
fewer adults older than 60 years when compared with a
city of 100 thousand inhabitants. Thus, a low prevalence
of elderly in large urban areas may also partially explain
the initial reduction of the number of deaths per capita
with the increase of city population.
In addition to addressing the urban scaling of cases and
deaths of COVID-19, we have investigated associations
between the growth rates of cases and deaths and the
city population (Figures 16-22 in S1 Appendix). As mentioned, the work of Stier, Berman, and Bettencourt [29]
shows that the initial growth rates of COVID-19 cases in
metropolitan areas of the United States scale as a powerlaw function of the population with an exponent between
0.11 and 0.20. By using our data and as detailed in Meth-

ods, we have estimated the growth rates of cases (rc ) and
deaths (rd ) for Brazilian cities. In agreement with the
United States case, our results also indicate that COVID19 cases initially grow faster in large cities (Figure 23 in
S1 Appendix), such that rc ∼ P βrc with βrc between ≈ 0.1
and ≈ 0.3 during the first three months (tc ≲ 90, Figure 23
in S1 Appendix). We also found similar behavior for the
growth rate in the number of deaths rd , where a powerlaw relation rd ∼ P βrd is a reasonable description for the
empirical data with a scaling exponent βrd between ≈ 0.1
and ≈ 0.5 during the first three months (td ≲ 90, Figure 23
in S1 Appendix).
The growth rate depicts a more instantaneous picture
of the COVID-19 spreading process, and its association
with size may change during the long-term evolution of
the pandemic. These changes may reflect the different
actions taken by each city to face the COVID-19 pandemic and other particularities affecting the COVID-19
spreading. For the spreading of COVID-19 in the United
States, Heroy [40] has reported that large cities appear
to enter in an exponential spreading regime earlier than
small ones. To better investigate these possibilities in
our data, we have estimated the average relationship between the growth rate of cases (rc ) and deaths (rd ) and
the city rank s (s = 1 represents the largest city in data,
s = 2 the second-largest, and so on) at different periods. Figure 4A shows the results for the growth rates in
the number of cases (rc ). In agreement with the powerlaw association between rc and the city population (Figures 16-22 in S1 Appendix), we note that lower values of
the city rank s are associated with higher growth rates
rc in the initial days since the first two daily cases. However, as time goes by, the growth rate of cases starts to
decrease in large cities (low-rank values) and to increase

in small ones (high-rank values). This result appears to
agree with the findings of Heroy [40] in the sense that
there is a delay in the emergence of high growth rates
of cases between large and small cities. Figure 4B shows
the same analysis for growth rate in the number of deaths
rd . While we also observe a decrease in rd for large cities
and increase for small ones, the differences in rd are less
pronounced than in rc . These findings also emerge when
investigating the scaling exponents associated with the
growth rates of cases (βrc ) and deaths (βrd ). The results
of Figure 23 in S1 Appendix show that these exponents
start to decrease around tc ≈ td ≈ 100 days and become
negative in our latest estimates. It is worth remembering
that the time tc (or td ) is measured in days since the first
two daily cases (or first two daily deaths) for each city;
thus, the results of Figure 4 do not reflect delays in the
emergence of the first case in each city.

DISCUSSION

We have studied scaling relations for the number of
COVID-19 cases and deaths in Brazilian cities. Similarly to what happens for other diseases, we found the
number of cases and deaths to be power-law related to
the city population. During the initial three-four months
since the first two daily cases or deaths, we found a sublinear association between cases and deaths by COVID19, meaning that the per capita numbers of cases and
deaths tend to decrease with population in this initial
stage of the pandemic. We believe this behavior can be
partially explained by an “increasing urban advantage”
where large cities have proportionally more ICU beds
than small ones. In addition, changes in age demography with city size show that large cities have proportionally less elderly people who are at high risk of developing severe illness and dying from COVID-19. This may
also partially explain the initial reduction of fatalities per

capita with the city population. In addition, we have argued that the strategies and policy responses of large and
small cities to COVID-19 may also be different and lead
to different efficiency in containing the pandemic.
However, we found that this “urban advantage” vanishes in the long-term course of the pandemic, such that
the association between cases and deaths by COVID-19
with population becomes super-linear in our latest estimates since the first two daily cases or deaths. Thus,
the persistence of this pattern indicates that large cities
are expected to be proportionally more affected at the
end of the COVID-19 pandemic. This result is in line
with the findings for other infectious diseases [25, 27] and
probably reflects the existence of a higher degree of interaction between people in large cities [19, 28]. Because
social distancing is currently the only available measure
to mitigate the impact of COVID-19, our results suggest
that large cities may require more severe degrees of social
distancing policies.
In agreement with the results for metropolitan areas
in the United States [29], we have found that large cities
usually display higher growth rates in the number of cases
during the initial spread of the COVID-19. However, our
results also show that these growth rates tend to decrease
in large cities and to increase in small ones in the longterm course of the pandemic. This behavior suggests
the existence of a delay in the emergence of high growth
rates between large and small cities. Similar behavior
was also found in the United States [40], where large cities
appear to enter an exponential growth regime earlier than
small towns. The existence of this delay suggests that
the initial slow-spreading pace of the COVID-19 in small
cities is likely to be a transient behavior.
Together with the recent findings of Stier-BermanBettencourt [29] and Heroy [40] for the United States, as
well as those of Cardoso and Gonçalves [30] for United
States, Brazil and Germany, our results suggest that social distancing policies and other actions against the pan-

7
demic should take into account the non-linear effects of
city size on the spreading of the COVID-19.
METHODS

Thus, we assume these lognomal fluctuations in all adjusting procedures in order to estimate the values of β.
It is worth mentioning that this maximum-likelihood estimate for scaling exponents is analogous to the one obtained via usual least-squares with the log-transformed
variables (log Y versus log P ).

Data

The primary data set used in this work was collected
from the brasil.io API [41]. This API retrieves information from COVID-19 daily reports published by the
Health Offices of each of the 27 Brazilian federations (26
states and one federation district) and makes it freely
available. This data set comprises information about
the cumulative number of cases and deaths of COVID-19
from 25 February 2020 (date of the first case in Brazil)
until 12 August 2020 (date of our last update) for all
Brazilian cities reporting at least one case of COVID19. The brasil.io API also provides population data
of Brazilian cities, which in turn relies on population estimates for the year 2019 released by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). There is a
total of 5,507 Brazilian cities with at least one reported
case of COVID-19 on 12 August 2020, corresponding to
98.9% of the country’s total number of cities. In addition, 3,892 cities suffered casualties from this disease,
representing 69.9% of the total. To ensure that our estimates rely on at least 50 cities, we consider a suitable
upper threshold for the time series length (Figure 24 in
S1 Appendix). The data about age demographics refer
to the latest Brazilian census that took place in 2010,
while the data about the number of ICU beds are from
April 2020. These two data sets are maintained and made
freely available by the Department of Informatics of the
Brazilian Public Health System (DATASUS) [42].
Fitting urban scaling laws

Urban scaling [18] usually refers to a power-law association between a city property Y and the city population
P , and it is expressed by
Y = Y0 P β ,

(3)

where Y0 is a constant and β is the urban scaling exponent. Equation (3) can be linearized by taking the
logarithmic on both sides, that is,
log Y = log Y0 + β log P ,

(4)

where log Y and log P are the dependent and independent
variables of the corresponding linear relationship between
log Y and log P . We have estimated the power-law exponents in Eq. (3) by using the probabilistic approach of
Leitão et al. [43]. Specifically, we have found the probabilistic model with lognormal fluctuations and where the
fluctuations in log Y are independent of P to be the best
description of our data in the majority of scaling laws.

Logarithmic growth rates of cases and deaths

Let us consider that xt (t = 1, . . . , n) represents the
cumulative number of cases (Yc ) or the cumulative number of deaths (Yd ) for COVID-19 in a given city at time
t (number of days since first case tc or death td ). The
logarithmic growth rate rt at time t is defined as
rt = log(xt /xt−τ )/τ (t = τ, τ + 1, . . . , n)

(5)

where τ is a time delay. If we assume the numbers of cases
or deaths to initially increase exponentially (xt ∼ ert ,
where r is the exponential growth rate), rt represents
an estimate for the growth rate of this initial exponential behavior (r). We have estimated rt for the number
of cases (rc ) and deaths (rd ) up to values of tc and td
ensuring a sample size of at least 50 cities for the allometric relations between these growth rates and the city
population (Figure 24 in S1 Appendix). All results in
the main text were obtained for τ = 14 but our discussion is robust for τ between 9 and 21 days (Figures 25-38
in S1 Appendix).

Figure 23. Time dependence of the scaling exponents for growth rates of cases and deaths under different
choices for the number of daily cases or daily deaths as reference points. Panels (A)-(G) show the dependence of
the exponents βrc and βrd on tc and td when considering the first 1-7 daily cases and the first 1-7 daily deaths as reference
points. The shaded regions stand for standard errors, and the horizontal dashed lines represent βrc = βrd = 0. We notice that
behavior observed for large numbers of the reference points appear to follow the behavior of small ones in the long-term course
of the pandemic.

Figure 24. Number of cities with time series longer than a particular number of days. Left panels show the number
of cities reporting cases of COVID-19 with time series larger than d∗ days. The vertical dashed lines indicate that there are 50
cities with confirmed cases time series longer than the particular of number of days indicated within the plots. Right panels
show the number of cities reporting deaths caused by COVID-19 with time series longer than d∗ days. The vertical dashed
lines indicate that there are 50 cities with deaths time series longer than the particular of number of days indicated within the
plots. We have used these thresholds to ensure that our scaling relations are estimated from samples sizes having at least 50
cities. Panels (A)-(G) show the results when considering the first 1-7 daily cases and the first 1-7 daily deaths as reference
points.
