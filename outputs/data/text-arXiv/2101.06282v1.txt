Abstract
Governments across the world are currently facing the task of selecting suitable intervention strategies
to cope with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a highly challenging task, since harsh measures
may result in economic collapse while a relaxed strategy might lead to a high death toll. Motivated by
this, we consider the problem of forming intervention strategies to mitigate the impact of the COVID19 pandemic that optimize the trade-off between the number of deceases and the socio-economic costs.
We demonstrate that the healthcare capacity and the testing rate highly affect the optimal intervention
strategies. Moreover, we propose an approach that enables practical strategies, with a small number of
policies and policy changes, that are close to optimal. In particular, we provide tools to decide which
policies should be implemented and when should a government change to a different policy. Finally, we
consider how the presented results are affected by uncertainty in the initial reproduction number and
infection fatality rate and demonstrate that parametric uncertainty has a more substantial effect when
stricter strategies are adopted.

Introduction

A novel coronavirus was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019 [1]. The virus, now known as
SARS-COV-2 [2], spread rapidly through China and the rest of the world causing the COVID-19 disease,
being officially declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 17th, 2020. Since
the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the world has been facing an unprecedented human tragedy along
with fears of economic devastation. As a result, more than 90 million infected cases and 2 million deaths have
been reported to this date (January 19, 2021). To cope with the effects of the virus, governments across the
world have implemented a range of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as closing schools, banning public
events and imposing social distancing, self-isolation and lockdown policies. Although such interventions may
curtail the infection rate of the disease and hence the spread of the virus [3], [4], they impose an enormous
economic effect. According to the International Monetary Fund [5], the economic impact of the pandemic is
expected to cause the steepest worldwide recession in over 40 years and result in a loss of more than 5% of the
GDP in the developed world. Hence, although a combination of social distancing and lockdown policies may
be effective in containing the virus, it might be highly costly in terms of economical impact, which naturally
makes government decision making a multi-objective problem.
Mathematical models are fundamental to describe the dynamic evolution of pandemics and to form effective
policies to mitigate their impact. A seminal study in this area is [6], which describes the widely used susceptible
- infected - recovered (SIR) model. A comprehensive review of epidemiology models can be found in [7]. Such
models enable the study of the progression of various diseases over time, and facilitate the characterization
of their asymptotic behaviour and dependence on model parameters. Recently, there have been various
approaches to model the progression of the COVID-19 outbreak. A common approach is to apply different
extensions to the SIR model, e.g. [8]. In addition, a more involved compartmental model has been developed in
[9], offering larger modelling flexibility compared to simpler models. Furthermore, [10] developed an extended
model which took into account the regional heterogeneity of the pandemic.
Two important parameters in the study of epidemic progression are the basic reproduction number and
the infection fatality rate. The former is interpreted as the number of new people that the average person
transmits the disease to while the latter enables an estimate of the fatalities resulting from the disease.
The initial reproduction number, i.e. the basic reproduction number at the onset of the disease, which we

denote by R0 , is also of particular importance to accurately model the disease progression and in deciding
the extend of government policies. However, there is significant uncertainty in estimating these parameters,
as demonstrated via numerous studies that estimate R0 using statistical data from different countries [11],
[12], [13], and various studies that have reported different infection fatality rates [14], [15], [16]. Hence, it is
important to consider the effect of parametric uncertainty in forming effective government strategies.

Contribution
This study uses tools from optimal control theory to address the problem of forming a practical and efficient
government intervention strategy that limits the number of fatalities due to the COVID-19 pandemic with a
low social and economic cost until a vaccine is fully deployed.
In particular, we consider a controlled SIDARE (Susceptible, Infected undetected, infected Detected,
Acutely symptomatic - threatened, Recovered, deceased - Extinct) model that takes into account the effect of
government intervention policies. The considered model enables the integration of features such as the impact
of the available healthcare capacity and testing rate. The contribution of this study is summarized as follows:
(i) Fatalities vs economics cost. We present the relation between the number of fatalities and cost of
optimal government intervention, and study how this relation is affected by the amount of testing and
the capacity of the healthcare system to treat patients. We demonstrate the effect of these parameters
in the decease rate of the pandemic and the resulting cost associated with the optimal intervention
strategy. In addition, for a range of adopted decease tolerance levels, we provide insights on the shape
of the optimal intervention strategy and its dependence on the adopted test policy.
(ii) Which policies and when. We consider the fact that a government can only implement a limited
number of policies and policy changes over the time span of the pandemic, due to practicality and
implementability reasons and to avoid the social fatigue resulting from frequent changes in policy. Our
approach provides tools to decide which policies should be implemented and when should a government
change to a different policy. We demonstrate that a small number of policies and policy changes yields a
close to optimal government strategy. In particular, our results suggest that the additional cost incurred
from implementing 4 policies and 6 policy changes is less than 1% compared to the optimal continuously
changing strategy.
(iii) Impact of uncertainty. We consider the impact of uncertainty in the value of the initial basic reproduction number R̄0 and the infection fatality rate on the decease rates resulting from optimal government
strategies associated with particular decease tolerance levels. We demonstrate that parametric uncertainty has a larger impact when stricter government policies, associated with lower decease tolerances,
are adopted.

Results
Problem description

To study the progression of the pandemic, we consider a controlled SIDARE (Susceptible, Infected undetected, infected Detected, Acutely symptomatic - threatened, Recovered, deceased - Extinct) model (see Fig.
1), where the effects of the healthcare capacity limit and non-pharmaceutical government interventions on
the mortality and infection rates are taken into account. A full mathematical description of the controlled
SIDARE model and explanations on its components are provided in Section 4. Note that the terms threatened
and acutely symptomatic, as well as deceased and extinct are used interchangeably. In addition, we form a
multi-objective optimization problem whose cost function consists of three components: (i) the socio-economic
cost of government intervention, (ii) the cost associated with hospitalization and medical care of the acutely
symptomatic population and (iii) a cost proportional to the portion of deceased population. We seek intervention strategies that minimize the aforementioned cost function. We then investigate how such strategies can
be obtained with a limited number of distinct policies and policy changes in the described optimization problem. Further motivation and details concerning the mathematical formulation of the optimization problem is
provided in Section 4, while our approach to solve it is detailed in the Appendix.

Deceased population vs. cost of government intervention

In this section we study the problem of forming an optimal government strategy and its dependence on selected
parameters. In particular, we consider the impact of (i) the healthcare capacity limit, (ii) the testing rate
and (iii) the cost emphasis on the acutely symptomatic and deceased population, on the optimal intervention

strategy and the resulting portion of deceased population. Figure 2 depicts the relation between the portion of
deceases and the optimal cost of government intervention, resulting from solving the considered optimization
problem (described in equation (4) in Section 4), for a range of cases for testing rate, healthcare capacity and
emphasis on the acutely symptomatic and deceased population. It should be noted that all costs presented
in Fig. 2 are normalised using as basis the cost of the optimal government strategy with no testing resulting
to 0.01% deceases.
In particular, we considered the cases of (i) limited capacity, where two-thirds of the current healthcare
capacity is used for COVID-19 patients, (ii) full capacity, where the total capacity is used and (iii) extended
capacity, where the total capacity is increased by one third due to government investment and is available for
COVID-19 patients. In addition, we considered the cases where (I) no testing, (II) slow testing and (III) fast
testing policies are implemented. Finally, we consider three different cases for the cost emphasis on acutely
symptomatic population corresponding to no emphasis (a), low emphasis (b) and high emphasis (c). In
addition, a broad range of cost weights associated with the deceased population was considered in each case,
with aim to provide a rich set of policy options. Note that a zero cost policy is only demonstrated in Fig. 2
(a) since having a non-zero emphasis on the acutely symptomatic population necessarily results in an optimal
intervention strategy with a non-zero cost. The exact values used to produce the results presented in Fig. 2
are provided in Section 4.
From Fig. 2 we deduce the following:
(i) The healthcare system capacity significantly affects the portion of deceased population, particularly when
a low cost (Cost < 50%) strategy with no testing is implemented. This is particularly reflected in Fig. 2 (a)
which demonstrates that increasing the available healthcare capacity from the limited level to the extended
level results in up to a 50% decrease in deceases.
(ii) When high cost government intervention strategies are adopted (Cost > 60%), then the amount of threatened population never exceeds the healthcare capacity limit and hence its value does not affect the decease
rate. The latter is demonstrated from the fact that there is no shaded regions in most scenarios depicted in
Fig. 2 (b,c).
(iii) Increasing the amount of testing enables significantly fewer deaths for the same government intervention
cost. This is reflected in Fig. 2 (a), which demonstrates that slow testing approximately halves the portion
of deceased when compared to no testing, when a low intensity government strategy (Cost < 50%) is adopted.
In addition, fast testing results in approximately half the deceases compared to slow testing and enables low
cost strategies (Cost < 15%). It should be noted though that, although fast testing policies enable a reduction
in costs and decease rates, they may not always be feasible since they require sufficient resources in terms of
testing equipment and trained personnel.

intervention when the available healthcare capacity for COVID-19 patients is limited (red), full (blue), and extended
(yellow) and when no testing (left), slow testing (center) and fast testing (right) policies are adopted. In addition, we
present the cases where no emphasis (a), low emphasis (b) and high emphasis (c) is given to the cost associated with
the acutely symptomatic population. When identical relations are obtained for different healthcare capacity levels,
as for example in (c), then only the lowest capacity is presented. Shaded regions show the ranges of the relations
between deceased population percentage and cost of government interaction when the healthcare capacity is between
the limited and extended levels. All presented costs are normalised using as basis the cost of the optimal government
strategy with no testing resulting to 0.01% deceases.

(iv) When a decease tolerance is set, a faster testing policy enables a less intense government strategy, and
hence a lower government intervention cost. For example, when a 0.1% decease tolerance is considered, a no
testing policy requires a cost of more that 90%, while slow and fast testing policies yield the same amount of
deceases with costs of less than 40% and 10% respectively.

2.3

Government intervention strategies

Using the findings depicted in Fig. 2, we aimed to draw efficient intervention strategies that restrict the portion
of the deceased population to specific tolerated amounts with the minimum cost. The selected portions of
decease tolerances where 1%, 0.1% and 0.01%. The approach to obtain the optimal intervention strategies
is described in the appendix. The corresponding intervention strategies for each decease tolerance level and
(i) no testing, (ii) slow testing, and (iii) fast testing policy levels are depicted in Fig. 3 (a,b,c, left). Note
that a fast testing policy yielded less than 1% deceases for any intervention strategy. Figure 3 depicts the
intensity of optimal government intervention strategies (left) and the resulting portion of deceased (right)
for each decease tolerance level. It demonstrates the impact of testing availability in designing intervention

and (iii) fast testing (magenta) policies are adopted. The intensity of government intervention strategies correspond to
the strictness of government policies, where 0 corresponds to no interventions and 1 to the strictest possible intervention (e.g. a full scale lockdown). The approach to obtain the optimal continuous strategy is explained in the appendix.

and 12 and 18 policy changes are presented in the Appendix.

strategies associated with selected decease tolerances.
The intensity of government intervention is modelled in Section 4 with a parameter u (see equation (3) in

depicts the average and range of the percentage differences between the costs of the continuous strategies presented in
Fig. 3 and strategies with a small number of policies, for different numbers of allowed distinct implemented policies.

difference of less than 1% in all cases.

Section 4 and Fig. 1), where a value of u = 0 corresponds to no government interventions and u = 1 to the
strictest intervention policy (e.g. a full scale lockdown). Note that forming actual government strategies using
the provided values of u, is a nontrivial task. This problem is equivalent to obtaining the basic reproduction
number resulting from different intervention policies, which has been considered in [17]. For example, from
[17] it can be deduced that for Italy, a school closure policy results to u = 0.02 while a lockdown policy to
u = 0.8. Motivated by this, we consider any policy with u > 0.6 as a very high intensity policy. In addition,
policies with u ∈ [0, 0.2], u ∈ [0.2, 0.4] and u ∈ [0.4, 0.6] are referred to as low, medium and high intensity
policies respectively.
From Fig. 3 (a), it follows that adopting a high intensity intervention strategy (u > 0.5) for a period of
approximately 50 days is required to limit the deceases to 1% when no testing is performed. Interestingly, a
slow testing policy allows a similar portion of deceased with a government strategy of about 3 times lower
intensity. In addition, Fig. 3 (b) demonstrates that a 0.1% decease tolerance requires intervention strategies
ranging from high to very high (u ∈ [0.5, 0.7]), medium to high (u ∈ [0.25, 0.50]), and low to medium
(u ∈ [0.10, 0.25]) intensities when no, slow and fast testing policies are adopted. Furthermore, Fig. 3 (c)
shows that a decease tolerance of 0.01% requires very slowly changing strategies of very high (u ≈ 0.65), high
(u ≈ 0.45) and medium (u ≈ 0.25) intensity when no, slow and fast testing policies are respectively adopted.

2.4

Implementing a limited number of policies and policy changes

An implementable government strategy should only have a limited number of distinct policies. In addition,
frequent changes in the intervention strategy may result in social fatigue and confusion, decreasing the receptiveness of the population to the policy instructions. The policies that follow by discretizing the continuous
strategies described in the previous section are depicted in Fig. 3 with dotted plots. The approach to obtain
optimized strategies with a small number of policies and policy changes is described in the appendix. Figure
3 demonstrates that implementing 4 policies and allowing a maximum of 6 changes among them results in
almost identical levels of decease rates compared to the continuously changing strategies. Hence, a close to
optimal government response may be obtained with a relatively small number of distinct policies.
Implementing an optimal strategy with a limited number of policies and policy changes results in an
increased cost compared to the optimal continuously changing strategy. The cost differences for discrete
implementations of the strategies presented in Fig. 3 are depicted in Fig. 4, where a broad range of allowed
number of policies is considered. For all cases the number of allowed policy changes was twice the number of
implemented policies minus two. From Fig. 4, it follows that as the number of policies grows, the percentage
cost difference decreases. Furthermore, as follows from the boxed plot within Fig. 4, it can be seen that a low
cost difference can be obtained with a small number of policies. In particular, adopting 4 or more intervention
policies allowed a cost difference of less than 1%. The latter demonstrates the effectiveness of implementing
a small number of policies and policy changes.
Hence, a small number of policies and policy changes suffices for a close to optimal government response,
while at the same time resolves issues of implementability and social fatigue.

testing always limits the deceases to less than 1% and hence there is no corresponding case. The table on (a) reports
the worst case portion of deceased associated with each strategy, obtained at the maximum considered values of R̄0
and the infection fatality rate. The values where acquired by applying in each case the optimal continuous government
intervention strategy obtained with R̄0 = 3.27 and infection fatality rate of 0.66%. Dark red and dark blue colours
correspond to aggregate deceases that are at least twice and less than half the adopted tolerance levels. Additional
results that demonstrate the impact of parametric uncertainty in forming effective government mitigation strategies
are provided in the Appendix.

2.5

Effect of parametric uncertainty

The design of optimal control strategies relies on the use of mathematical models. Therefore, a critical aspect
in designing government mitigation strategies is their dependence on parametric uncertainty, i.e. the extend
of the effect of inaccurately estimating model parameters. In this section, we consider how the uncertainty
in the value of the initial basic reproduction number R̄0 and the infection fatality rate affect the amount of
deceases resulting from the strategies presented in the previous section.
In particular, we considered the effect on the aggregate deceases when the value of R̄0 ranges between
3.17 and 3.38 and when the infection fatality rate ranges between 0.39% and 1.33%, which correspond to 95%
confidence intervals, as reported in [12] and [14] respectively.
Figure 5 demonstrates the effect of parametric uncertainty on the portion of deceased resulting from
each of the 8 considered government intervention strategies presented in Fig. 3, i.e. it depicts the portion
of deceased from implementing the selected strategies when R̄0 and the infection fatality rate have been
imprecisely estimated. Figure 5 demonstrates that the level of adopted decease tolerance is crucial when it
comes to the effect of model uncertainty in the decease rate.
In particular, when a 1% decease tolerance level is adopted, the obtained policy enabled a moderate
percentage increase in the total deceases, resulting to 1.75% deceases in a worst case scenario, as demonstrated
in Fig. 5 (a). When the decease tolerance level was decreased to 0.1%, then parametric uncertainty could
7

result in up to 0.29% deceases, i.e. about 3 times higher, as demonstrated in Fig. 5 (b) and the table in
Fig. 5 (a). Finally, when a requirement for decease tolerance level of 0.01% was imposed, then the considered
uncertainty could result in up to 11.6 times higher values, as depicted in Fig. 5 (c) and the table in Fig. 5 (a).
These show that parametric uncertainty should also be taken into account in forming government policies,
particularly when the adopted policies are stricter, i.e. when a low decease tolerance level is imposed.

Discussion

Following the COVID-19 outbreak, governments across the world have adopted strict intervention policies to
contain the pandemic. However, the high economic costs resulting from these policies have sparred debates
on the necessity of the measures and on how these could be relaxed without risking a new wave of infections.
Recently, several approaches have been proposed to control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. In
particular, optimal intervention strategies that simultaneously minimize the number of fatalities and the
economic costs are presented in [18] and [19]. A similar problem has been considered in [20], which in
addition investigated model predictive control approaches. Moreover, [21] and [22] explored the use of onoff policies to mitigate the effects of the pandemic, proposing control strategies that alternate between no
measure and full measure policies. Furthermore, [10] considered regional instead of national interventions to
alleviate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, [23] considered the problem of selecting the
optimal lockdown portion that jointly minimizes the number of fatalities of the COVID-19 pandemic and the
economic costs associated with the proposed policy by considering an adapted SIR model. A similar problem
has been studied in [24], which in addition considered the effect of imposing different policies to different age
groups.
An important missing aspect that we consider in this study is the fact that governments can only impose
a limited amount of intervention policies, for practicality and implementability issues and to reduce the social
fatigue resulting from frequently changing policies. We demonstrate that a small number of distinct policies
and policy changes yields a close to optimal government strategy. In particular, our results suggest that the
additional cost incurred from implementing 4 policies and 6 policy changes is less than 1% compared to the
optimal continuously changing strategy. Using tools from optimal control theory, we provide an approach,
analytically described in the appendix (see Section B), which allows to select in an optimized fashion, which
policies should be implemented and when should a government switch to a different policy. Our approach can
be easily applied to different types of models and cost functions, which might give emphasis to other aspects
of the pandemic.
A further contribution of this paper is the study of the uncertainty in the parameters associated with the
initial reproduction number and the infection fatality rate. Our results suggest that parametric uncertainty
has a more significant effect when stricter government policies, aiming for lower decease rates, are adopted.

Methods

We consider a SIDARE model, which is a variation of the SIR model, to describe the evolution of the COVID19 pandemic, where the population is divided in six categories: (i) Susceptible to be infected, (ii) Infected
but undetected, (iii) infected and Detected, (iv) Acutely symptomatic - threatened, (v) Recovered and (vi)
Extinct - deceased. Note that we use the terms threatened and acutely symptomatic, as well as deceased and
extinct interchangeably.
The dynamics of the SIDARE model are given by
ṡ = −βsi,
(1a)
i̇ = βsi − γi i − ξi i − νi,
d˙ = νi − γd d − ξd d,

(1b)

ȧ = ξi i + ξd d − γa a − µa,

(1d)

ṙ = γi i + γd d + γa a,

(1e)

(1c)

ė = µa,
(1f)
s(0) = s0 , i(0) = i0 , d(0) = d0 , a(0) = a0 , r(0) = r0 , e(0) = e0 ,
(1g)
where s, i, d, a, r, e ∈ [0, 1] are the states of the system describing the portions of susceptible, infected undetected, infected - detected, threatened, recovered and deceased population respectively. Moreover,
s0 , i0 , d0 , a0 , r0 , e0 ∈ [0, 1] denote the initial values for s, i, d, a, r, e respectively. The model parameters are
briefly summarized below:
• β describes the infection rate for susceptible individuals.
8

• γi , γd and γa describe the recovery rates for infected undetected, infected detected and threatened
individuals.
• ν denotes the rate of detection of infected individuals, associated with the adopted level of testing.
• ξi and ξd describe the rates at which infected undetected and infected detected individuals become
acutely symptomatic.
• µ describes the mortality rate of the disease, i.e. the rate at which acutely symptomatic individuals
decease.
Note that all model parameters are assumed non-negative and constant. The SIDARE model is based on the
following assumptions:
(i) Those recovered are no longer susceptible to the disease.
(ii) The considered population is constant, i.e. no births or deaths not attributed to COVID-19 are taken
into account.
(iii) The considered country (or region) is isolated, i.e. no imported cases are taken into account.
(iv) Infected individuals that are detected are assumed to be quarantined, i.e. they do not contribute to new
infections, something justified by existing practices.
(v) Infected individuals become acutely symptomatic before they decease.
(vi) Acutely symptomatic individuals require hospitalization since they are considered threatened for decease.
The assumption of constant population suggests that the states satisfy s + i + d + a + r + e = 1 at all times
and hence that one state is redundant since it can be described by the remaining states at all times. In the
analysis below, we select r to be the redundant state, satisfying r = 1 − s − i − d − a − e.

4.1

Impact of healthcare capacity on mortality rate

An important aspect that we consider is the impact of the healthcare system capacity on the mortality rate. It
is evident that when the healthcare capacity is exceeded, then the mortality rate of the population increases.
The latter is modelled in equation (2), which suggests that the mortality rate depends on the portion of
acutely symptomatic population by the relation
⎧
⎪
⎪µa, if a ≤ h,
µ(a) = ⎨
(2)
⎪
µh + µ̂(a − h), if a > h,
⎪

where the function µ ∶ [0, 1] → R+ describes the mortality of the acutely symptomatic population. The
values of µ and µ̂ satisfy µ < µ̂ and correspond to the mortality rates when the healthcare system satisfies the
demand and when the healthcare capacity is exceeded by much. This means that when the infected population
increases, the mortality rate tends to µ̂. In addition, the value of h describes the existing healthcare capacity.
Note that for simplicity we assume a constant value of h, although its value could rise in the future due to a
possible increase in the healthcare system capacity.

Modelling government interventions on the SIDARE model

To account for the effect of the government actions to mitigate the spread of the pandemic, we introduce an
intervention input u to the SIDARE model. Its value affects the infection rate of the disease, β, resulting
in a slower spread. The controlled SIDARE model follows from equation (1) when β is replaced by β(1 − u)
and in addition includes the healthcare capacity impact on the mortality rate, described by equation (2). Its
dynamics are given by
ṡ = −βsi(1 − u),
(3a)
i̇ = βsi(1 − u) − γi i − ξi i − νi,
d˙ = νi − γd d − ξd d,

(3b)

ȧ = ξi i + ξd d − γa a − µ(a),

(3d)

ė = µ(a),

(3e)

s(0) = s0 , i(0) = i0 , d(0) = d0 , a(0) = a0 , e(0) = e0 ,

(3f)

(3c)

s + i + d + a + r + e = 1,
(3g)
where u ∈ U = [0, ū] and ū ≤ 1 is a positive constant that denotes the maximum value that the intervention
policy u is allowed to take. Since government actions should only aid in curtailing the effects of the pandemic,
u is not allowed to take negative values. The dynamics of the controlled SIDARE model are depicted in Fig. 1.
9

The value of u(t) corresponds to the government intervention policy at time t, with higher values of u
corresponding to stricter intervention policies. For example, when a government does not take any action,
then u = 0 and when a government takes the strictest possible measures, e.g. when implementing a full scale
lockdown, then u = ū.

4.3

A multi objective optimization problem

A suitable government strategy should aim to simultaneously minimize the number of fatalities and the
costs associated with implementing intervention policies. The number of the aggregate fatalities during the
considered period is given by e(T ), where the constant T > 0 denotes the considered timeframe.
Moreover, any policy u comes with a cost associated with the social and economic side effects from its
implementation. For example, a lockdown policy has an economic cost due to the inability of a portion of the
population to work and a social cost associated with restricting the population movements and interactions.
In addition, we consider the cost associated with the acutely symptomatic population. The latter describes
the costs resulting from people requiring additional care, including possible hospitalization. These motivate
the following cost functional,
T 1
T 1
u(t)2 dt + θa ∫
a(t)2 dt,
C(u, a) = ∫
2
2
0
0
where the non-negative parameter θa describes the weight given on the cost associated with the threatened
population. The proposed cost functional sets a penalty analogous to the square of the intervention effort
u, set by the government to mitigate the effects of the disease, and the square of the aggregate threatened
population a. Note that a quadratic cost is considered in order to enable a close estimate to the non-linear
cost effects arising from intense government strategies and from having a large portion of the population being
in a threatened state.
However, there is a trade-off between minimizing the economic cost of government policies and the number
of fatalities. The above motivates the following optimization problem
min J(a, e, u) = C(u, a) + θe e(T )
u∈U
(4)
s.t. (3),
where θe describes the weight given to the total number of deaths in comparison with the cost associated
with the threatened population and government intervention effort. The values of weight coefficients θe and
θa are key to form the optimal policy. For example, if θe = θa = 0, then the focus of the government is to
minimize the socio-economic cost of the intervention strategy, which trivially results to u = 0 for all times. On
the other hand, when θa and θe are large, then the focus becomes to minimize the number of fatalities and
the number of acutely symptomatic individuals, which results in a value of u that is close to ū at all times.
Since there is a trade-off between these objectives, selecting suitable values for θe and θa is highly important.
Furthermore, note that the relative ratio between θa and θe enables an extra degree of freedom in the choice
of the optimization problem and a richer set of solutions. The approach to solve the above optimization
problem, using tools from optimal control theory, is explained in the appendix (see Section B).

4.4

Implementing a limited number of policies and policy changes

A government can only implement a limited number of policies and policy changes over the time span of the
pandemic, for practicality and to avoid the social fatigue resulting from frequent policy changes. To account
for this, we restrict both the number of distinct implemented policies and policy changes in the previously
considered optimization problem.
We denote the set of possible policies by Ud , the set of distinct policies within strategy u by R(u) = {ũ ∶
∃t ∈ [0, T ] s.t. u(t) = ũ} and the set of switching instants by T = {t ∈ [0, T ] ∶ lim→0 u(t − ) ≠ lim→0 u(t + )}.
The revised problem is given by
min J(a, e, u)
u∈Ud
(5)
s.t. (3), ∣R(u)∣ ≤ n̂1 , ∣T ∣ ≤ n̂2 ,
where n̂1 and n̂2 denote the maximum number of policies that u is allowed to take from the set Ud and the
maximum allowed number of changes in the intervention strategy over the considered timeframe respectively.
The solution approach for problem (5) is analytically described within the Appendix.

4.5

Simulated parameters

In this section, we describe and justify the parameters considered in the simulation results presented in Section
2. We use the controlled SIDARE model, described by equation (3), for our simulations, with a time horizon
of T = 365 days. The selected initial conditions correspond to the very early stage of the disease, where 0.001%
10

of the population has been infected and there are no detected cases, acutely symptomatic cases, fatalities or
recoveries yet. When possible, data associated with the pandemic in Italy where used for consistency.
The values of γi and γd were selected following [25], which suggests a median time of disease onset to
recovery for mild cases of approximately two weeks. The value of γa was selected following [26], which
reported a median time between hospitalization and recovery of 12.4 days. Furthermore, to select the values
for ξi and ξd , we used the findings from [14] on hospitalization rate per age group and data for the Italian
population age distribution [27]. In addition, for the results presented in Fig. 3–5, we considered a healthcare
capacity of 333 care beds per 100, 000 habitants following [28], which corresponded to the full capacity case.
The maximum allowed value for u, given by ū, was selected to be 0.8 to account for the fact that complete
isolation is impossible, since always some critical units will need to remain operational.
The value of β was selected following an initial basic reproduction number of approximately 3.27 as
estimated in [12] and the relation R0 = βs0 /(γi + ξi + ν) which is analytically shown in the appendix (see
Section A), assuming ν = 0 at t = 0 days. The value of µ was selected following a median infection fatality rate
of 0.66%, as reported in [14]. We let µ̂, which corresponds to the fatality rate when the healthcare system
capacity is overloaded, be 5 times higher than µ, motivated by the findings in [29]. In addition, the values
for θa associated with no, low and high emphasis on acutely symptomatic population where 0, 5 × 104 and
105 respectively. For each case, a broad range of cost coefficients associated with the deceased population
was considered, letting θe ∈ [0, 2.5 × 104 ]. The no, slow and fast testing policies corresponded to values of
ν of 0, 0.05 and 0.10 respectively. Additional explanations on the simulated parameters are provided in the
Appendix.

Conclusion

We considered the problem of forming government intervention strategies that optimize the trade-off between
the number of deceases and the social and economic costs. We demonstrate the relation between the number
of fatalities and cost of optimal government intervention, and how this depends on the adopted testing policy
and the healthcare system capacity. Moreover, we determine that a small number of policies and policy
changes suffices for a close to optimal intervention strategy. In particular, our results suggest that implementing 5 policies and 8 policy changes enables a cost difference of less than 1% compared to a continuously
changing strategy. Finally, we considered the impact of uncertainty in the initial reproduction number and
infection fatality rate and demonstrated that its effect is more severe when intense government strategies are
implemented.

Analysis of the SIDARE model
Analytical results for the SIDARE model

The SIDARE model, given by equation (1), is a bilinear system with six states. Below, we demonstrate
that all states in equation (1) take non-negative values, provided that the initial conditions are non-negative,
which is clearly in line with intuition.
Lemma 1. Consider equation (1) and let all states take non-negative values at t = 0. Then, all states take
non-negative values for all times.
Proof of Lemma 1: If all states takes non-negative values at the initial conditions, then from equation
(1a), it follows that s can not take negative values by continuity and the fact that ṡ = 0 when s = 0. It then
follows that i is also non-negative from s being non-negative and equation (1b). Similar arguments hold for
states d and a, i.e. the non-negativity of i and (i, d) respectively and the dynamics in equations (1c)–(1d)
suffice so that d and a are non-negative. Finally, the non-negativity of (i, d, a) implies that ṙ ≥ 0 and ė ≥ 0
from equations (1e) and (1f) respectively and hence that r and e are also non-negative.
∎
It should also be noted that from equations (1a), (1e), and (1f) and Lemma 1, it follows that the state s
is monotonically decreasing and the states r and e are monotonically increasing.
The following lemma characterises the equilibria of equation (1). Note that we let x = (s, i, d, a, r, e) for
convenience. In addition, we denote an equilibrium of (1) by x∗ = (s∗ , i∗ , d∗ , a∗ , r∗ , e∗ ).
Lemma 2. The set of equilibria of (1) is given by S = {x∗ ∶ i∗ = d∗ = a∗ = 0}.
Proof of Lemma 2: Any equilibrium of equation (1) should satisfy s∗ i∗ = 0 from equation (1a). This
suggests from equation (1b) that i∗ = 0, which in turn suggests from equation (1c) that d∗ = 0. An equilibrium
with i∗ = d∗ = 0 also satisfies a∗ = 0 from equation (1d). Moreover, consider any point in the state space of
equation (1) with i = d = a = 0. This point is necessarily an equilibrium since all equations (1a)–(1f) are zero.
∎
The following proposition enables to define the basic reproduction number R̄0 in terms of model parameters. Note that the definitions of stable and unstable equilibria follow from [30, Definition 4.1]. Within
Proposition 1, we make use of the set X⪰0 = {x ∶ x ⪰ 0}.
Proposition 1. Consider an equilibrium point of (1), given by x∗ = (s∗ , 0, 0, 0, r∗ , e∗ ) and let x(0) take
non-negative values. Then,
(i) if s∗ < (γi + ξi + ν)/β, then there exists a neighbourhood Z of x∗ such that solutions initiated in Z ∩ X⪰0
asymptotically converge to an equilibrium point within Z.
(ii) if s∗ > (γi + ξi + ν)/β, then x∗ is an unstable equilibrium point.
Proof of Proposition 1: We first prove part (i), using Lyapunov based arguments, and then part (ii).
Part (i): First note that since all states take non-negative values at t = 0, then they take non-negative
values at all times from Lemma 1. Furthermore, from equations (1a), (1e), and (1f) it follows that the state
s is monotonically decreasing and the states r and e are monotonically increasing.
12

For the system described by equation (1), we consider an equilibrium point x∗ and the Lyapunov candidate
function
V (x) = V1 (s, r, e) + V2 (i, d, a),
where
1
1
1
V1 (s, r, e) = (s − s∗ )2 + (r − r∗ )2 + (e − e∗ )2 ,
2
2
2
and
V2 (i, d, a) = i + θ1 d + θ2 a,
where θ1 and θ2 are positive constants.
The dynamics of equation (1) suggest that
V̇1 (x) = (s − s∗ )(−βsi) + (r − r∗ )(γi i + γd d + γa a) + (e − e∗ )µa ≤ 0
where the inequality holds since s(t) ≥ s∗ , r(t) ≤ r∗ and e(t) ≤ e∗ for all times since s is monotonically
decreasing and r and e are monotonically increasing and all states i, d, a and parameters β, γi , γd , γd and µ
take non-negative values.
In addition, it follows that along trajectories of equation (1) it holds that
V̇2 (x) = βsi − γi i − ξi i − νi + θ1 (νi − γd d − ξd d) + θ2 (ξi i + ξd d − γa a − µa).
Note that for solutions initiated sufficiently close to x∗ it holds that s(t) < (γi + ξi + ν)/β at all times due
to the monotonicity of s. Therefore, letting ρ = (γi + ξi + ν) − βs(0) it follows that i̇ ≤ −ρi at all times and
consequently
V̇2 (x) ≤ −ρi + θ1 (νi − γd d − ξd d) + θ2 (ξi i + ξd d − γa a − µa).
Hence, there exist positive θ1 , θ2 satisfying θ1 ν + θ2 ξi < ρ and θ2 ξ < θ1 (γd + ξd ) such that
V̇ = V̇1 + V̇2 ≤ −φ1 i − φ2 d − φ3 a ≤ 0,
(6)
where φ1 , φ2 and φ3 are positive constants. Hence, there exists a compact connected set Ξ which includes x∗ ,
given by Ξ = {x ∶ V (x) ≤ r}, for sufficiently small r > 0, such that solutions initiated within Ξ remain in Ξ for
all times. Since r can be selected to be arbitrarily small, it follows that x∗ is a stable equilibrium of (1).
LaSalle’s invariance principle [30][Theorem 4.4] can now be applied on the compact and positively invariant
set Ξ. This guarantees that solutions to equation (1) initiated in Ξ converge to the largest invariant set within
Ξ ∩ {x ∶ V̇ (x) = 0}. If V̇ = 0 holds within Ξ it follows from equation (6) that (i, d, a) = (0, 0, 0). The latter
implies convergence of the states (s, r, e) from equations (1a) and (1e)–(1f) to the set of equilibria within Ξ.
In addition, note that if r in the definition of Ξ is selected to be sufficiently small, then Ξ contains only
stable equilibria, satisfying s∗ < (γi + ξi + ν)/β. This allows to deduce that solutions initiated within Ξ
asymptotically converge to an equilibrium point by using arguments analogous to those in [31, Prop. 4.7,
Thm 4.20].
Part (ii): Consider any equilibrium x∗ such that s∗ > (γi +ξi +ν)/β. Then, the Jacobian matrix associated
with the linearisation of equation (1) at x∗ is given by
⎡0
−βs∗

⎣
It can easily be shown that Jx∗ has three zero eigenvalues and three more given by −γd − ξd , −γa − µ and
βs∗ − γi − ξi − ν. When s∗ > (γi + ξi + ν)/β, the last eigenvalue is positive which suggests that the linearisation
at x∗ is unstable.
∎
The value of R̄0 corresponds to the basic reproduction rate. Stability of the dynamics described by
equation (1) imply a basic reproduction rate of less than or equal to 1. Hence, for the considered case it holds
that R̄0 s̄ = 1. Therefore, from Proposition 1 it follows that the value of R̄0 is given by R̄0 = 1/s̄ = β/(γi +ξi +ν).
It should be noted that all all analytical results presented above, can be trivially extended when the term
µa in equations (1d) and (1f) is replaced with µ(a).

Optimal control methodology

In this section we present the solution approach that yields the optimal continuous strategy and optimized
strategies with a limited number of policies and policy changes.
13

To improve the presentation of the results, we note that the states a and e are uniquely defined by the
initial conditions and u, and hence a functional J can be defined such that J (u) = J(a, e, u) for given initial
conditions. Therefore, the optimization problem Problem (4) can be equivalently written as
min J (u)
u∈U
(7)
s.t. (3).

B.1

Solution approach

We call û a solution to Problem (4) if J (û) = minu∈U J (u) = minu∈U J(a, e, u). We call the solution û and
the corresponding state x̂ an optimal pair. The existence of a solution to Problem (4) is established by the
following lemma.
Lemma 3. There exists a solution to Problem (4).
Proof of Lemma 3: To prove Lemma 3, we apply [32, Thm. 2.1, p. 63], which provides sufficient conditions
for the existence of an optimal solution to a general optimal control problem. In particular, the conditions in
[32, Thm. 2.1, p. 63] are satisfied for Problem (4) since:
(i) Equation (3) is continuously differentiable,
(ii) there exist a feasible solution to equation (3),
(iii) U is a compact set,
(iv) F (t, x) = {[−βsi(1 − u) , βsi(1 − u) − γi i − ξi i − νi , νi − γd d − ξd d , ξi i + ξd d − γa a − µ(a) , µ(a)]T ∶ u ∈ U}
is convex for all (t, s, i, d, a, e) ∈ [0, T ] × [0, 1]5 .
Hence, there exists an optimal solution û to Problem (4).
∎
To obtain the optimal intervention strategy û, it will be convenient to form the Hamiltonian for Problem
(4), as below

H(x, u, λ) = u2 + θa a2 + λT (f0 (x) + f1 (x)u)

Below, we provide necessary optimality conditions for Problem (4), which are a result of Pontryagin’s
minimum principle.
Proposition 2. Let (x̂, û) be a locally optimal pair to Problem (4). Then, there exists a co-state function
λ̂ ∶ [0, T ] → R5 such that the following conditions hold for almost all t ∈ [0, T ]:
˙
λ̂T = −(λ̂T (∇f0 (x̂) + ∇f1 (x̂)û)),
(9a)
λ̂(T ) = [0 0 0 0 θe ]T ,
(9b)
û = [−λ̂T f1 (x̂)]U

(9c)

Proof of Proposition 2: The proof follows from applying Pontryagin’s minimum principle [33] in Problem
(4). The principle states that for a trajectory (x̂, û) that solves Problem (4), there exists a function λ̂ ∶
[0, T ] → R5 that that:

where the Hamiltonian H is given by equation (8) and S is associated with the final cost, and is given by
S(x) = θe e. Hence, equation (9) follows directly2 from equations (8) and (10). Note that equation (9c) follows
(x̂(t), û(t), λ̂(t)) = 0 when û ∈ U o , i.e. when û lies in the interior of
from equation (10d), which results to ∂H
∂u
U.
∎
We make use of equation (9) and the controlled SIDARE model dynamics, described by equation (3) to
obtain the optimal solution to Problem (4). To tackle the challenges associated with dealing with initial and
final value constraints in numerical simulations, we used an adapted forward-backward sweep method (e.g.
[36, Ch. 21]).

B.2

Implementing a limited amount of policies and policy changes

An implementable government strategy requires that u takes a small number of distinct values, i.e. there
exists a finite set of distinct possible intervention policies Ud = {ũ1 , ũ2 , . . . , ũm̄ } ⊂ U such that u(t) ∈ Ud for
all t ≥ 0. For notational convenience, it is assumed that ũi < ũj for i < j. Moreover, for each strategy u,
we consider the set of policy change instants T = {t1 , t2 , . . . tn } satisfying 0 < t1 < t2 < ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ < tn < T , where
T > 0 denotes the considered timeframe, such that u(t) = uj ∈ Ud , t ∈ [tj−1 , tj ), 1 ≤ j ≤ n + 1, where t0 = 0 and
tn+1 = T . In addition, it is assumed that uj ≠ uj+1 , 1 ≤ j ≤ n − 1. Note that the cardinality of the set T is
important as it describes the amount of changes between policies. For any intervention strategy u, we let
R(u) = {ũ ∶ ∃t ∈ [0, T ] s.t. u(t) = ũ} satisfying R(u) ⊆ Ud denote the set of policies within u. In addition,
∣R(u)∣ describes the number of distinct policies within strategy u.
Drawing a practical government intervention strategy motivates the introduction of two constraints: (i) on
the number of distinct policies, so that a small set of rules is implemented by the population, (ii) on the number
of policy changes, since frequent policy changes may result in social fatigue, decreasing the responsiveness of
the population to the policy instructions. To account for these, we have defined the optimization problem
(5), presented also below for convenience:
min J(a, e, u)
u∈Ud

s.t. (3), ∣R(u)∣ ≤ n̂1 , ∣T ∣ ≤ n̂2 ,
where n̂1 and n̂2 respectively denote the maximum number of policies that u is allowed to take from the set
Ud and the maximum allowed number of changes in the intervention policy over the considered timeframe. In
analogy to (7), Problem (5) can be equivalently written as
min J (u)
u∈Ud
(11)
s.t. (3), ∣R(u)∣ ≤ n̂1 , ∣T ∣ ≤ n̂2 .
To solve the above problem, we make use of the solution to Problem (4), which is a continuous relaxation
to Problem (5), and hence provides a lower bound to the cost of Problem (5). Our approach to obtain a
solution to Problem (5) is described below:
(i) Obtain û that solves Problem (4).
(ii) Using û, obtain an optimized solution to Problem (5), denoted by ûd , resulting from a local minimum
cost search algorithm.
Part (i) of the above approach is explained in Section B.1 above (see also Proposition 2). Part (ii) is
described in detail below.
Part (ii): The methodology in this section is split in two steps. First, we obtain a strategy that approximates û and simultaneously satisfies the constraints of Problem (5). Using this strategy for initialization,
we implement Algorithm 1 which produces the optimized policy ûd . Note the in the presented process, it is
assumed that n̂1 > 1 and n̂2 ≥ 1. The case where n̂1 = 1 which necessarily results in ∣T ∣ = ∅ can be trivially
solved by evaluating the costs of implementing each value of u ∈ Ud .
Initialization: The first step aims to obtain an intervention strategy ūd that approximates the continuous
strategy û and simultaneously satisfies the constraints of the problem. To obtain such strategy, we let
umax = maxt∈[0,T ] û and umin = mint∈[0,T ] û and define ûi = [umin + (i − 1) ∗ (umax − umin )/(n̂1 − 1)]Ud and
Us = {ûi ∶ i ∈ {1, . . . , n̂1 }}, where n̂1 is given in Problem (5). Consequently, we let vd (t) = arg miny∈Us ∣y − û(t)∣
for all t ∈ [0, T ], i.e. we project the values of the continuous policy û onto the discrete set Us . The latter leads
to R(vd ) = Us . Moreover, we define the set T̄ i = {t ∈ [0, T ] ∶ lim→0 vd (t + ) ≠ lim→0 vd (t − )}, i.e. the set of
all time instants when a change occurs in the intervention policy vd .
dµ̄(a)

that there is a technical issue in the definition of ∂H
when a = h̄ since da is not well defined at this point. This
∂x
issue can be resolved by considering the subdifferntial of µ̄(a) at a = h̄ [34], and define the solutions for x and λ in the sense of
Filippov [35]. We refrain from properly defining these concepts to avoid the introduction of extensive technical notions and to
keep the focus of the paper on the practical aspects of the results.
2 Note

15

If ∣T̄ i ∣ ≤ n̂2 , then we select ūd = vd . Otherwise, we define ∣T̄ i ∣ strategies vd,j , such that strategy vd,j
satisfies vd,j (t) = vd (t), t ∈ [0, T ] ∖ [tj , tj+1 ) and vd,j (t) = vd (tj−1 ), t ∈ [tj , tj+1 ), i.e. vd,j follows by omitting the
jth switch in vd . We then calculate the cost for each of the above policies, given by J (vd,j ), and select the
q = ∣T̄ i ∣ − n̂2 strategies with the least cost. Finally, we neglect the switches associated with these q strategies
from vd , i.e. the q switches which individually cause the least increase in cost once removed, to construct ūd .
The latter enables the construction of ūd which satisfies all the constraints of Problem (5).

Algorithm 1: After obtaining ūd , as explained above, then an optimized solution ûd is obtained from
Algorithm 1, as described below. To initialise Algorithm 1, we first consider the set of switching instants for
strategy ūd , which we denote by T̄ , and select a sufficiently small δ > 0 which corresponds to the tolerance
of Algorithm 2, implemented within Algorithm 1. In addition, the vector p, with p ∈ N∣R(ûd )∣ , represents the
indices of implemented policies from Ud in strategy ūd in decreasing order, i.e. pi = k means that the ith
largest implemented policy is ũk , reminding that Ud = {ũ1 , ũ2 , . . . , ũm̄ }.

Algorithm 1 aims to obtain an optimized intervention strategy, denoted by ûd , by making incremental
changes in the test policy ût , as seen in equations (A.1.1)–(A.1.2), e.g. when m = 1 and n = 1 then Algorithm
1 replaces the largest policy within ût with the immediately more relaxed policy within Ud , in analogy when
n = 2 then the attempted policy is the one which is the immediately more strict. Then, Algorithm 2, described
in detail below, makes use of the test policy ût and set of switching times T and provides a new test policy
with an optimized set of switching times, denoted by T̃ , and a corresponding cost, denoted by C. If C is less
than the lowest cost obtained by that stage, denoted by Cm , then ûd is updated as in equation (A.1.4.1). In
addition, the supplementary variables Cm , p and T̄ are updated to facilitate the progression of the algorithm,
as described in equations (A.1.4.2)–(A.1.4.4).

The convergence variable θ takes the value of 0, which imposes that a new set of iterations need to be
performed for the convergence of the algorithm. If there is no improvement in Cm for all m ∈ {1, . . . , ∣R(ûd )∣}
and n ∈ {1, 2}, then Algorithm 1 converges. Convergence of Algorithm 1 suggests that any incremental change
in any of the policies within ût will result in a higher cost, and hence that a local minimum has been reached.
For improved clarity, a flowchart of Algorithm 1 is presented in Fig. 6.

Algorithm 2: Algorithm 2 aims to obtain an optimized set of switching times, denoted by T̃ and a
corresponding intervention strategy ût by making use of the discrete test policy ût , the set of switching times
T and the tolerance level δ provided from Algorithm 1 for its initialization. In particular, it alters the switching
times by δ in either direction, as demonstrated in equation (A.2.1) and updates ūt as described in equations
(A.2.2)–(A.2.3). Then, a new cost is calculated, based on the new strategy ūt by implementing equation
(A.2.4). If the new cost, denoted by C̃ is lower than the cost obtained by policy ût , then the cost, the policy
and the set of switching times are updated, as demonstrated in equations (A.2.5.1)–(A.2.5.3). Otherwise, the
policy ūt reverts to its previous value.

The variable φ serves as a convergence variable. In particular, when any iteration occurs that allows a
decrease in cost then its value is set to 0, which results in a new set of iterations for T̃ . Convergence of the
algorithm suggests that a local minimum of the cost C is reached, where changing any switching time in T̃
does not result in a lower cost. For improved intuition, Fig. 7 depicts a flowchart of Algorithm 2.

Algorithm 1 creates a monotonically decreasing sequence of values for C, which is lower bounded by
C ∗ = J (û), i.e. the cost associated with the optimal continuous policy obtained in part (i). Therefore, the
sequence of updates in C and hence Algorithm 1 converge, as directly follows by the monotone convergence
theorem (e.g. [37, Theorem 2.4.2]). A similar argument follows for the convergence of Algorithm 2.

Supplementary Results

In this section, we present additional results that supplement the presented findings. In particular, we present
optimized strategies and the corresponding decease rates when 4, 7 and 10 distinct policies and 6, 12 and 18
policy changes are allowed. Furthermore, we complement our results associated with the effect of parametric
18

uncertainty, depicted in Fig. 5, with additional results demonstrating the optimal strategies and corresponding
aggregate deceases for a range of values for the infection fatality rate and initial basic reproduction number
R̄0 . These results aim to provide additional intuition on the effect of parametric uncertainty in forming
efficient government strategies.

C.1

Simulated parameters

The controlled SIDARE model, described by equation (3) has been used in our simulations, with a time
horizon of T = 365 days. The selected initial conditions correspond to the very early stage of the disease,
where 0.001% of the population has been infected and there are no detected cases, acutely symptomatic cases,
fatalities or recoveries yet.
The values of γi and γd were selected following [25], which suggests a median time of disease onset to
recovery for mild cases of approximately two weeks. The value of γa was selected following [26], which
reported a median time between hospitalization and recovery of 12.4 days.
The value of β was selected to be 0.251, corresponding to an initial basic reproduction number R0 =
βs0 /(γi + ξi + ν) of approximately 3.27 following [12], and assuming ν = 0 at t = 0 days. The value of ū,
corresponding to the maximum allowed value for the input u was selected to be 0.8. Furthermore, to select
the values for ξi and ξd for the case of Italy, we used the findings from [14] on hospitalization rate per age
group and data for the Italian population age distribution [27]. In addition, we considered 333 care beds per
100, 000 habitants following [28].
The value of µ was selected to be 0.0085, being associated with an infection fatality rate of 0.66% as
reported in [14]. The latter is in agreement with various studies that report a mortality rate close or below
1% [15], [38], [16]. We let µ̂, which corresponds to the fatality rate when the healthcare system capacity is
overloaded, be 5 times higher than µ, motivated from [29] which compared the fatality rates in two regions in
Italy, Lombardy where more than 80% of the healthcare capacity was held by COVID-19 patients and Veneto
where up to 40% was held, and deduced an approximate five fold increase in the mortality rate.
To facilitate the reproducibility of the results, the parameter values used in the simulations, and the
justification for their selection, are reported in Table 1.

Deceased population versus cost of government intervention

In Fig. 2, we associate the cost of (optimal) government intervention and the portion of deceased population
when: (i) different hospital capacity rates, (ii) different testing rates and (iii) different cost emphasis levels
associated with the acutely symptomatic population, are considered. Note that in each case we considered a
broad range of cost weight values associated to the total number of deaths. The considered cases for hospital
capacity rates, testing rates, and cost weights attributed to the acutely symptomatic cases and the total
number of deaths are presented in Table 2.

Implementing a limited number of policies and policy changes

In Fig. 8–15, we present the intervention strategies and corresponding aggregate deceases associated with
decease tolerances of 1%, 0.1% and 0.01%. In particular, we present the optimal continuous strategy and
optimized intervention strategies with 4, 7 and 10 distinct policy levels and 6, 12 and 18 policy changes
respectively. These results are associated with Fig. 3, which however includes only the case where 4 distinct
policies and 6 policy changes are allowed. The results presented in Fig. 8–15 demonstrate that increasing the
number of distinct policies enables a decease response that is closer to the optimal continuous strategy, which
is in agreement with intuition.

C.4

Effect of parametric uncertainty

In Fig. 16–31, we present additional results associated with the effect of uncertainty in knowledge of the initial
reproduction number R̄0 and the infection fatality rate. These results aim to provide additional intuition and
clarity on the presented results.
In particular, we first consider the case where the value of R̄0 ranges between 3.17 and 3.38, which
corresponds to a 95% confidence interval, as reported in [12] when the infection mortality rate is 0.66%, as
reported in [14]. For the considered case, we obtain the optimal strategies which correspond to each value of
R̄0 for the parameters presented in Table 3, associated with the 8 continuous strategies presented in Fig. 3.
The ranges of the obtained optimal intervention strategies for each of these 8 considered cases are depicted
in Fig. 16–23 (left). From these figures, it follows that the uncertainty in R̄0 results in small variations in the
optimal strategies when no and slow testing policies are adopted. By contrast, when fast testing policies are
implemented, the impact of the uncertainty in R̄0 on the optimal strategies is more substantial.
Moreover, Fig. 16–23 (right) demonstrate the ranges of decease rates obtained when the same 8 selected
strategies are applied for R̄0 ∈ [3.17, 3.38] when the infection mortality rate is 0.66%, i.e. they depict the
decease rates from implementing the selected strategies when the value of R̄0 has been incorrectly estimated.
The effect of implementing the 8 selected strategies when in addition the infection mortality rate has been
incorrectly estimated is demonstrated in Fig. 24–31, which depict the decease rates for the considered range
of values for R̄0 when the infection mortality rate is 0.39% and 1.33% respectively. These values represent the
lower and upper bounds of a 95% infection mortality rate confidence interval, as reported in [14]. Figures 16–
23 (right) and Fig. 24–31 demonstrate that the level of the adopted decease tolerance is crucial when it comes
to the effect of model uncertainty in the decease rates. The latter is in agreement with the presented results,
which state that parametric uncertainty has a more substantial effect when stricter government strategies,
associated with lower decease tolerances, are adopted.
