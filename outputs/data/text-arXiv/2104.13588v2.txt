Abstract
In the era of open data, Poisson and other count regression models are increasingly
important. Provided this, we develop a closed-form inference for an over-dispersed Poisson regression,
especially for (over-dispersed) Bayesian Poisson wherein the exact inference is unobtainable. The
approach is derived via mode-based log-Gaussian approximation. Unlike closed-form alternatives, it
remains accurate even for zero-inflated count data. Besides, our approach has no arbitrary parameter
that must be determined a priori. Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate that the estimation error of
the proposed method is a considerably smaller estimation error than the closed-form alternatives and
as small as the usual Poisson regressions. We obtained similar results in the case of Poisson additive
mixed modeling considering spatial or group effects. The developed method was applied for analyzing
COVID-19 data in Japan. This result suggests that influences of pedestrian density, age, and other
factors on the number of cases change over periods.

Introduction
Currently, a wide variety of count data are corrected through sensors and used for smart
urban and regional management (see Soomro et al., 2019). For example, in 2020–2021 when the
coronavirus disease (COVID-19) spread globally, the daily number of people infected with
coronavirus was monitored worldwide, and countermeasures were considered based on the
observations (Viner et al., 2020).
Poisson and other regression models for count data have been used for analyzing the
number of COVID-19 cases (e.g., Oztig and Askin, 2020; Vokó and Pitter, 2020) or other diseases
(e.g., Wakefield, 2007; Lee and Neocleous, 2010). These regression models have also been used in
ecology (e.g., Ver Hoef and Boveng, 2007; Lindén and Mäntyniemi, 2011), criminology (e.g., Osgood,
2000; Piza, 2012), and other fields.
Recently, Bayesian Poisson regression, which assumes Poisson distribution for the count
data and Gaussian priors for latent variables describing spatial, group, and other effects, is widely used
in applied studies. Owing to the lack of contiguity between the Poisson and Gaussian distributions, an
approximate inference is necessary for the estimation. Unfortunately, the Markov Chain Monte Carlo
method can be slow for large samples. Faster approximations have been developed for count data
regression in a context of additive modeling (e.g., Wood, 2011; Rodríguez-Álvarez et al., 2015), mixed
effects modeling (Pinheiro and Bates, 2011), and Gaussian process (e.g., Diggle et al., 1998; Rue et
al., 2009). These approaches do not provide closed-form solutions.
Exceptionally, Chan and Dong (2011) and Chan and Vasconcelos (2011) proposed closedform approximations for Poisson regression. Their approaches have the following advantages:
(i)

Easy to implement and extend. The Gaussian process model and other models for Gaussian data
are readily transferred for count data modeling.

(ii) Computationally efficient. Unlike alternatives, numerical optimization is not needed.
(iii) Poisson regression estimates are unidentifiable or identifiable only weakly for certain data
configuration (Silva and Tenreyro, 2010). As we will illustrate later, this property considerably
worsen the accuracy of Poisson regression estimates especially for small samples with many
zeros. The linear approximation is free from such difficulty and more stable.
Breslow (1984) and El-Sayyad (1973) proposed relevant closed-form approximations, too. Given the
current situation wherein a wide range of researchers and practitioners use count data, these fast, stable,
and practical approaches will become increasingly important. Unfortunately, these approximations
have the following disadvantages:

2

(iv) They have poor approximation accuracy for zero-inflated data (i.e., counts with many zeros) as
we will demonstrate later. Zero-inflation is a special type of over-dispersion (Ver Hoef and
Boveng, 2007). Thus, a closed-form approach accurately describing over-dispersion is needed.
(v) An arbitrary parameter, which is used to avoid taking the logarithm of zero, must be determined
a priori. The value is known to have substantial impact on the modeling result (Bellego and Pape,
2019). A closed-form approach without such an arbitrary parameter is needed.
Given that, we develop a closed-form approximation for the over-dispersed Poisson
regression, especially (over-dispersed) Bayesian Poisson regression, that has (i)–(ii) and overcomes
(iii)–(iv).

Methods
Improved log-Gaussian approximation
The mode of a log-Gaussian distribution grows slower than the mean whereas the mode
and mean of a Poisson distribution grow at the same rate. Therefore, mean-based log-Gaussian
approximation, such as the Taylor approximation use in Chan and Dong (2011), can have poor
approximation accuracy around the mode, which is the distribution center. Considering the success of
Laplace or other mode-based approximations in previous studies, it is reasonable to accurately
approximate Poisson distribution around the mode. This study first introduces a mode-based
approximation achieving it.
We first consider the following Poisson model for count variables 𝑌𝑖 |𝑖 ∈ {1, … 𝑁}:
𝑌𝑖 ~𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝜆𝑖 ),

𝜆𝑖 = 𝑧𝑖 exp(𝜇𝑖 ),

(1)

where 𝜇𝑖 is represents the mean, which may be specified by a regression model with/without a
Gaussian prior. 𝑧𝑖 is a given offset variable. 𝑌𝑖 is known to have two modes {𝜆𝑖 − 1, 𝜆𝑖 } for
integer-valued 𝜆𝑖 . Later, we will use the center of the two modes 𝑀𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑐 [𝑌𝑖 ] = 𝜆𝑖 − 0.5.
Our objective is to approximate Eq. (1) by using the following log-Gaussian model for
variables 𝑦𝑖 |𝑖 ∈ {1, … 𝑁}:
𝑦𝑖 + 𝑐~𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑁 (𝜇𝑖(𝐺) ,

1
)
𝑦𝑖 + 𝑐

(2)

where 𝜇𝑖(𝐺) represents the mean, and c is a constant required to avoid taking the logarithm of zero.
1
𝑦𝑖 +𝑐

is an approximate variance for a log-transformed Poisson random deviate (see El-Sayyad, 1973).

3

We approximate the Poisson model (Eq. (1)) using the log-Gaussian model (Eq. (2)) so
that the mode 𝑀𝑜𝑑𝑒[𝑦𝑖 ] under Eq. (2) equals the mode center 𝑀𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑐 [𝑌𝑖 ] of the Poisson model. The
following condition is obtained from the mode matching 𝑀𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑐 [𝑌𝑖 ] = 𝑀𝑜𝑑𝑒[𝑦𝑖 ]:
𝑧𝑖 exp(𝜇𝑖 ) − 0.5 = exp (𝜇𝑖(𝐺) −

1
) − 𝑐.
𝑦𝑖 + 𝑐

(3)

Eq. (3) suggests that 𝜇𝑖 and 𝜇𝑖(𝐺) do not generally have a linear relationship. Exceptionally, they
have the following linear relationship if 𝑐 = 0.5:
𝜇𝑖(𝐺) = log(𝑧𝑖 ) + 𝜇𝑖 +

1
.
𝑦𝑖 + 0.5

(4)

While existing studies have determined 𝑐 somewhat arbitrary, 𝑐 = 0.5 is found to be a necessary
for applying the linear approximation under our assumption.
Let us substitute 𝑐 = 0.5 and Eq. (4) into Eq. (2). Then, we obtain the following logGaussian model approximating the Poisson model:
𝑦𝑖 + 0.5~𝐿𝑜𝑔𝑁 (log(𝑧𝑖 ) + 𝜇𝑖 +

1
1
).
,
𝑦𝑖 + 0.5 𝑦𝑖 + 0.5

(5)

By organizing Eq. (5), we have the following model:
log(𝑦𝑖∗ ) ~𝑁 (𝜇𝑖 ,
where 𝑦𝑖∗ =

𝑦𝑖 +0.5
𝑧𝑖

1
),
𝑦𝑖 + 0.5

(6)

1

exp (− 𝑦 +0.5). In short, the log-Gaussian distribution approximates the Poisson
𝑖

distribution around the mode center.
Unfortunately, the mode-based approximation is available if only 𝜆𝑖 = 𝐸[𝑌𝑖 ] ≥ 0.5 ,
which assures the non-negativity of 𝑀𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑐 [𝑌𝑖 ]. If 𝜆𝑖 < 0.5, the mode of the Poisson and logGaussian distributions behave somewhat differently: the Poisson mode is always zero while the mode
of the log-Gaussian distribution gradually converges to zero as 𝜆𝑖 (or 𝜇𝑖 ) declines. Mode-based
approximation is not suitable in this case. By contrast, the mean of the two distributions both converge
to zero as 𝜆𝑖 (or 𝜇𝑖 ) approaches zero.
Thus, for 𝐸[𝑌𝑖 ] < 0.5, we rely on a mean-based approximation based on the following
0.5

relationship, which is obtained from 𝐸[𝑦𝑖∗ ] = exp (𝜇𝑖 + 𝑦 +0.5) (see Eq. 6):
𝑖

𝐸[𝑦𝑖∗ ] exp (−

0.5
) = 𝐸[𝑌𝑖 ].
𝑦𝑖 + 0.5

4

(7)

Eq. (7) implies that, when approximating the Poisson mean using 𝑦𝑖∗ , it should be rescaled by
0.5

multiplying exp (− 𝑦 +0.5). By applying the rescaling for Eq. (6), we have the following mean-based
𝑖

approximation:
log(𝑦𝑖∗∗ ) ~𝑁 (𝜇𝑖 ,
where 𝑦𝑖∗∗ =

𝑦𝑖 +0.5
𝑧𝑖

1
),
𝑦𝑖 + 0.5

(8)

1+0.5

exp (− 𝑦 +0.5). Because of the disadvantage of the mean-based approximation
𝑖

explained in the beginning of this section, we assume Eq .(6) as long as 𝐸[𝑌𝑖 ] ≥ 0.5 (i.e., the modecenter is available) while Eq. (8) otherwise.
Still, 𝐸[𝑌𝑖 ] = 𝜆𝑖 is unknown a priori. Considering the property that 𝑃(𝑌𝑖 < 0.5) =
𝑃(𝑌𝑖 = 0), we approximate 𝑃(𝐸[𝑌𝑖 ] < 0.5) using the ratio 𝑟 of zero counts in {𝑌1 , … , 𝑌𝑁 }. Given
the approximation, Eqs. (6) and (8) are applied with probabilities 𝑟 and 1 − 𝑟, respectively. By
combining these equations using r, our proposed approximation is formulated as
1
),
𝑦𝑖 + 0.5

log(𝑦𝑖+ ) ~𝑁 (𝜇𝑖 ,
where 𝑦𝑖+ =

𝑦𝑖 +0.5
𝑧𝑖

(9)

1+0.5𝑟

exp (− 𝑦 +0.5 ), which yields Eq. (6) if 𝑟 = 0 and Eq. (8) if 𝑟 = 1. If all counts
𝑖

are non-zero, the mode-based approximation is applied for all the samples. As the share of zero counts
increases, the mean-based approximation is emphasized.

Property of the proposed approximation
Table 1 summarizes closed-form approximations for the Poisson regression models. These
methods perform approximations through the estimation of a linear regression model using the logtransformed explained variables and the inverse weight based on 𝑦𝑖 . These practical methods will be
useful for not only researchers but also practitioners. However, existing methods are accurate only for
a moderate to large 𝜇𝑖 (Chan and Vasconcelos, 2011). In other words, they should not be used for
counts with many zeros. Besides, the c parameter, which has a considerable impact on analysis result,
must be determined a priori (see the Introduction section). These drawbacks inhibit the practical use
of these approximations.

In contrast, our method does not have any unknown tuning parameters. Because of the
mode matching, the proposed method accurately approximates the mode of the Poisson distribution
irrespective of 𝜇𝑖 . As we will show later, this property dramatically improves the approximation
accuracy for zero-inflated count data.
Note that our mode-matching method is akin to the Laplace approximation, which is based
on the mode-matching of a Gaussian distribution and the target distribution. Considering studies
demonstrating the accuracy of the Laplace approximation, our mode-based approach is expected to be
accurate as well.

Results: Monte Carlo experiments
Case 1: Basic over-dispersed Poisson regression model
This section compares the estimation accuracy of the proposed approximation (Proposed)
with standard Poisson regression (Poisson), over-dispersed Poisson regression (odPoisson), and
negative binomial regression alternatives (NB). We also compare ours with the posterior
approximation of EL-Sayyad (1973) (Posterior) and the Taylor approximation of Chan and
Vasconcelos (2011) (Taylor).

The simulated count data 𝑦𝑖 is generated from the over-dispersed Poisson regression with
mean 𝜆𝑖 and the overdispersion parameter 𝜎 2 :
𝑦𝑖 ~𝑜𝑑𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝜆𝑖 , 𝜎 2 ),

𝜆𝑖 = exp(𝛽0 + 𝑥𝑖,1 𝛽1 + 𝑥𝑖,2 𝛽2 ),

(10)

where 𝑥𝑖,1 and 𝑥𝑖,2 are generated from standard normal distributions N(0, 1), and {𝛽1 , 𝛽2 } =
{2.0, 0.5}. We refer to 𝛽1 as a strong and 𝛽2 as a weak coefficient. 𝜎 2 = 1 implies the standard
Poisson regression without over-dispersion while 𝜎 2 > 1 means over-dispersion. The 𝛽0 parameter
implicitly controls the ratio of zero counts; a smaller 𝛽0 value yields more zero counts.
The coefficient estimation accuracy is compared across models while varying 𝛽0 ∈
{−2, −1, 0, 1, 1}, 𝜎 2 ∈ {1, 5}, and 𝑁 ∈ {50, 200}. In each case, the simulations were iterated 500
times and the root mean squared error (RMSE) and the mean bias are evaluated:

where 𝛽̂𝑘
is the estimated 𝛽𝑘 in the iter-th iteration.

The evaluated RMSE and bias values are plotted in Figs 1 and 2 in a case without
overdispersion 𝜎 2 = 1.0 whereas Figs 3 and 4 in cases with overdispersion 𝜎 2 = 5.0. Posterior and
Taylor tend to have large RMSEs and biases across cases, and the errors inflate if 𝑦𝑖 has many zero
values (i.e., small 𝛽0 ). These approximations do not work for zero-inflated count data. In contrast, the
RMSE values for the proposed method are as small as the exact Poisson and odPoisson specifications
across cases. Poisson, odPoisson, and NB have very large RMSE values if the counts are overdispersed (𝜎 2 = 5.0) and have many zero values (small 𝛽0 ); this is attributable to the identification
problem explained in the “Introduction” section. Proposed, which does not suffer from this problem,
advantageous in terms of stability. Although the bias of the proposed method tends to be larger than
that of Poisson and odPoisson, the value is still considerably smaller than that of Posterior and Taylor.
It is suggested that the proposed method estimates regression coefficients accurately, especially for
zero-inflated small data. Fig 5 shows the coefficient standard error (SE) estimates. If 𝑦𝑖 has less zero
values (i.e., large 𝛽0 ), the SEs estimated from the proposed method are similar to those of odPoisson,
especially in the over-dispersion case. In contrast, the proposed method indicated smaller SEs if 𝑦𝑖
had many zero values (i.e., small 𝛽0 ). Considering the better estimation accuracy of the proposed
method for small 𝛽0 , the smaller SEs might suggest the stability of the proposed method.

Case 2: Model with spatial effects
To verify the expandability of the proposed model, this section applies the proposed method
to estimate a spatial regression model, which has been widely used to analyze spatial phenomena in
the environment, economy, and epidemic. We consider the following model:
𝑦𝑖 ~𝑜𝑑𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝜆𝑖 , 𝜎 2 ),

𝜆𝑖 = exp(𝛽0 + 𝑥𝑖,1 𝛽1 + 𝑥𝑖,2 𝛽2 + 𝑠𝑖 ),

(12)

where {𝛽1 , 𝛽2 } = {2, 0.5} and 𝜎 2 = 5. 𝑠𝑖 is a process capturing a spatially dependent pattern of the
data. Following Murakami and Griffith (2015), it is modeled by assuming random effects whose
spatial dependence exponentially decays relative to the Euclidean distance between the geometric
centers of the two zones. Equation (11) is an over-dispersed Poisson mixed-effects model (MEM) that
considers spatial dependence. The model is estimated by applying the maximum likelihood (ML)
estimation for the Poisson MEM (Poisson), an over-dispersed Poisson MEM (odPoisson), the Taylor
approximate Poisson MEM (Taylor), and our specification (Proposed). Taylor and Proposed fitted
linear MEMs using the transforming explained variables and weight variables (see Table 1). All
models

were

estimated

using

the

R

package

mgcv

(https://cran.r-

project.org/web/packages/mgcv/index.html).
We assumed 𝛽0 ∈ {−2, −1, 0, 1, 1} and 𝑁 ∈ {50, 200}. In each case, the models were
estimated 500 times, and the estimation accuracies were compared. Figs 6 and 7 display the estimated

10

RMSEs and biases, respectively. When N = 50, odPoisson took extremely large RMSEs due to its
singular estimation. Poisson and Taylor also had large RMSEs. In contrast, the proposed method tends
to have smaller RMSE values. The proposed method may be a better choice for small samples. Even
for N = 200, the RMSEs and biases of Proposed were as small as those of Poisson and odPoisson. The
estimation accuracy of the proposed method was verified in the case of spatial regression.
Fig 8 compares the coefficient standard errors. For a large 𝛽0 , the SEs obtained from the
proposed method are similar to odPoisson, which proposes approximates. While odPoisson has larger
SEs for small 𝛽0 , it is attributable to the singular fit. The proposed method stabilizes it and make the
SEs small. Finally, Fig 9 compares the estimation accuracy for the spatially dependent process 𝑠𝑖 .
This figure shows that the proposed method tends to estimate the process more accurately than
alternatives.
Note that we performed another Monte Carlo experiment assuming group effects, which
model heterogeneity across groups instead of the spatially dependent effects. As summarized in
Appendix S1, the RMSEs and biases are as small as Poisson and odPoisson for N = 200 and smaller
for N = 50. The SEs are similar to odPoisson for large 𝛽0 and smaller for small 𝛽0 .
In short, the proposed method provides an accurate and stable approximation for an overdispersed Poisson MEM.

Results: COVID-19 analysis
Outline
This section employs the developed approximation to an analysis of the COVID-19
(coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic. Since the first case was detected in Wuhan, China, in December
2019, the coronavirus spread. As of February 1, 2021, the cumulative number of confirmed cases is
103.41 million, while the confirmed death toll is 2.25 million. To achieve effective infection control
for not only COVID-19 but also pandemics/endemics in the future, it is important to investigate the
determinants behind the disaster.
Fig 10 plots the number of daily cases in Japan between February 1, 2020, and January 29,
2021. The number peaked around April 2020, August 2020, and January 2021, respectively. Based on
the time trend, we refer to February 1 – May 31 as the first wave, June 1 – September 30 as the second
wave, and October 1 – January 29, 2021, as the third wave. Fig 11 displays the spatial plots of the
daily new cases by prefecture. This figure shows the tendency of the number of infected people to
become large near Tokyo and Osaka, which are major urban areas.

Figure 11: Number of cases by prefecture

We performed a regression analysis exploring the determinants of the increase/decrease in
each wave. The explained variables are the number of daily cases by prefecture by generation every
decade. The sample sizes were 51,336, 50,508, and 50,094 for the three waves respectively.
Unfortunately, the counts were zero-inflated; 89.0 % (45,696 samples), 77.1 % (38,954 samples), and
49.7 % (24,873 samples) of samples are zeros.
For the zero-inflated COVID-19 data, we fit Eq. (13) approximating an over-dispersed
Poisson additive mixed model:

regression coefficients. To scale the mean function according to the population, the offset variable 𝑧𝑖
is given by the prefectural population. The explanatory variable 𝑥𝑖 is the prefectural pedestrian
density by day, which is relative to January 13, 2020 (source: Apple Mobility Trends:
https://covid19.apple.com/mobility). The density is estimated based on the number of route searches
by Apple map users. For further detail, see the source page. 𝑔𝑖,𝑙 represents the l-th group-wise random
effect. We consider the effects by week (𝑔𝑖,1 ), days of the week (𝑔𝑖,2 ), generation (𝑔𝑖,3 ), and prefecture

14

(𝑔𝑖,4 ). In addition, a Moran coefficient-based spatial random effect 𝑠𝑖 is included to eliminate residual
spatial dependence (Murakami and Griffith, 2015).
The model was estimated using the R package spmoran (Version 0.2.1; https://cran.rproject.org/web/packages/spmoran/index.html).

Results
Table 1 summarizes the estimated parameters. The estimated coefficients of pedestrian
density become positively significant in the second and third waves. Self-restraint was estimated to
reduce the number of cases after June. Based on the estimated residual standard error (𝜎 2 ), the residual
variance was over-dispersed, and the tendency became stronger over time.

Figure 13: Estimated group effects (week, days of the week, generation)

Fig 13 plots the estimated group effects by week, days of the week, and generation. The
estimated week-wise effects show that the increase in cases lasts longer in later waves. Control of the
infection spread might be getting more difficult over waves. Regarding the days of the week, Monday
has the lowest while Thursday, Friday, and Saturday have higher values. The difference is attributable
to some business reasons such as the closing of hospitals and PCR test sites. The estimated generation
effects have considerable differences across waves. In the first wave, people who are in the working
generation (the 20s - 50s) tend to be infected. Commuting and/or meeting in the office might trigger
the infection. In the second wave, the 20’s group has a strong tendency of being infected as compared
to the elders, therefore, more self-restriction is needed. In the third wave, not only the 20s but also the
30s – 50s have high chances of being infected. Infection might spread again across the working
generation.
Fig 14 plots the estimated prefecture-wise independent effects and spatially dependent
effects. The former estimates local hotspots while the latter, global hotspots. The estimated prefecturewise effects suggest that prefectures including major cities (Tokyo, Osaka, Fukuoka) and Hokkaido
are local hotspots. More countermeasures might be required in these prefectures. On the other hand,
based on the estimated spatially dependent effects, there is a global hotspot around Tokyo, and the
influences grow over waves. Control of the infection spread from Tokyo might have been important
to mitigate the third wave.

Discussion
This study develops a practical log-Gaussian approximation for Poisson regression models.
Considering its simplicity, computational efficiency, and applicability to zero-inflated data, it will be
useful for researchers as well as practitioners.
Exploring the expandability of our approach is an important future task. For example, our
approach might be useful for spatial and spatiotemporal interpolation of count data by combining it
with Gaussian process models without additional computation and implementation costs. Our
approach might also be useful for fast count data assimilation by combining it with a state-space model.
Improving approximation accuracy would also be an interesting research endeavor. If a closed-form
approximation comparable with non-closed-form alternatives regarding not only RMSE but also bias
is developed, it will be extremely useful in practice.

Appendix S1: Monte Carlo experiments assuming group-wise
random effects
This section examines the estimation accuracy of the proposed model, assuming a Poisson
MEM with group-wise random effects. The synthetic data is generated by an over-dispersed Poisson
MEM defined as
𝑦𝑖 ~𝑜𝑑𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝜆𝑖 , 𝜎 2 ),

𝜆𝑖 = exp(𝛽0 + 𝑥𝑖,1 𝛽1 + 𝑥𝑖,2 𝛽2 + 𝑔𝑖 ),

(A-1)

where {𝛽1 , 𝛽2 } = {2, 0.5} and 𝜎 2 = 5. 𝑔𝑖 represents the group-wise random intercept. Samples
were randomly assigned to three groups for N = 50 (16.7 samples per group) and 10 groups for N =
200 (20 samples per group). The value of 𝑔𝑖 was sampled from a standard normal distribution.
Following the Monte Carlo experiments section, the Poisson MEM (Poisson), an overdispersed Poisson MEM (odPoisson), the Taylor approximate Poisson MEM (Tayor), and our
specification (Proposed) are estimated by the likelihood maximum, and their estimation accuracies are
compared while varying 𝛽0 ∈ {−2, −1, 0, 1, 1} and 𝑁 ∈ {50, 200}. In each case, the models were
estimated 500 times.
Figs A-1 and A-2 summarize the estimated RMSEs ansd biases. Proposed tends to have
smaller RMSEs than Poisson, odPoisson, and Taylor in cases with small samples (N = 50) while as
small as Poisson and odPoisson in cases with N = 200. Although Bias tends to be larger than Poisson

19

and odPoisson, they are much smaller than Taylor. Fig A-3 compares SEs. The result is consistent
with another simulation assuming spatial dependence (see the Monte Carlo experiment section); the
SEs estimated from Proposed are similar for odPoisson for large 𝛽0 and smaller for small 𝛽0 .
Regarding the group effects estimates, the accuracy of Proposed is as same as odPoisson and better
than Taylor and Poisson.
Overall, the results suggest that the proposed method accurately approximates the overdispersed Poisson MEM with group effects.
