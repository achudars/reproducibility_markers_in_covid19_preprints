Abstract. At the present stage, quarantine is the only available policy to control
COVID-19 epidemic. However, long-term quarantine is extremely expensive measure.
To explore the possibility of controlling and suppressing the epidemic at the lowest possible cost, in this paper we apply the toolbox of optimal control theory to the problem of
COVID-19 control. In this paper, we create two control SEIR type models describing the
spread of COVID-19 in a human population. For each model, we solve an optimal control
problem and find an optimal quarantine strategy that ensures the minimal level of the
infected population at the lowest possible cost. The properties of the corresponding optimal controls are established analytically by applying the Pontryagin maximum principle.
The optimal solutions are obtained numerically using BOCOP 2.0.5 software package.
The behavior of the appropriate optimal solutions and their dependence on the basic reproductive ratio, population density, and the duration of quarantine are discussed, and
practically relevant conclusions are made.

1. Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic began in Wuhan, China with the discovery of unknown pneumonia cases in late December 2019. The city of Wuhan was closed and quarantined by
22 January, 2020. On the 30th of January, World Health Organization (WHO) recognized
the outbreak of a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) as a public health emergency of international concern; on the 11th of March it announced that the outbreak had become a
pandemic and on the 13th of March that Europe had become its center. Two key factors
of this virus, which contribute to the difficultly of the pandemic, are the wide variations
of the incubation period (in some cases over 14 days) and a very large number of asymptomatic patients who are contagious but demonstrate mild or no clinical manifestations.
As no vaccine against COVID-19 is currently (the summer of 2020) available, the quarantine (or a regime of massive self-isolation) remains to be the only accessible control
policy. The Chinese experience of the February-March of 2020 shows that the quarantine
can effectively stop the spread of the infection and annihilate the virus. However, at the
same time, the large-scale quarantine is also extremely expensive policy inflicting huge

economic losses. Moreover, while some groups of a population, such as children and the
retired, can be quarantined at a comparatively low cost, the cost quickly grows as more
and more of the economically active people have to be isolated.
By quarantine, we mean social and economic constraints imposed by the national and
local governments to combat the spread of the virus by the mean of (i ) reducing the
number of social contacts and (ii ) reducing the probability of passing the infection in
the remaining contacts. These restrictions and their severity can be implemented by a
variety of different forms. A specific implementation depends on many factors, including
geographic location (where the susceptible population is located) and the local population
density.
One of the difficulties associated with COVID-19 control is that the actual functional
form that describes the transmission of the infection from one individual to another is
currently unknown in details. However, as our study demonstrates, this can be a factor
of principal importance for designing of a control policy. In this paper, to take this fact
into account, we formulated two different models of the COVID-19 transmission, which
cover two most likely cases. For each of these models, we formulated the corresponding
optimal control problems (which are respectively referred to as OCP-1 and OCP-2). Each
of the problems was analytically studied and then solved numerically for a variety of time
intervals and basic reproduction numbers.
While the objective of this paper is finding a quarantining policy that minimize both, the
level of infection and the cost of the quarantine, we left the consequences of the epidemic
for the economy out of the paper scope. The interested reader can find discussion of the
various economic scenarios associated with epidemics in [20, 21].

2. Optimal control problems
Let us consider the spread of COVID-19 in a human population of size N(t). We
postulate that the population is divided into the five classes and denote:
• S(t) – the number of susceptible individuals;
• E(t) – the number of exposed individuals who exhibit no symptoms and are not
contagious yet (the individuals in the latent state);
• I(t) – the number of infected individuals who have very mild symptoms or no
symptoms at all (it is believed that for COVID-19 those are about 80% of the
infectious individuals);
• J(t) – the number of infected individuals who are seriously ill;
• R(t) – the number of recovered individuals.
Hence, the natural equality
(2.1)

S(t) + E(t) + I(t) + J(t) + R(t) = N(t)

holds. Please note that the proposed population structure postulates that there are two
parallel pathways of the disease progression, namely, symptomatic, S → E → J → R,
and asymptomatic, S → E → I → R, which is shown in Figure 2.1.
In this paper, we are only interested in a single epidemic, which we assume to be
reasonably short. Therefore, we ignore the demographic processes (that is, the new births
and natural deaths) assuming that they occur at a considerably slower time scale. Then

the spread of COVID-19 can be described by the following system of differential equations:

Figure 2.1. Schematic compartmental diagram for the transmission dynamics of COVID-19.
Model (2.2) differs from the classical SEIR model by having two parallel infection
passways and, hence, two parallel infectious classes, namely, the asymptomatically infectious individuals I(t) and the symptomatically infectious individuals J(t). System (2.2)
postulates that the susceptible individuals S(t) are infected through contact with asymptomatically and symptomatically infected individuals, I(t) and J(t), at incidence rates
f1 (S(t), I(t), N(t)) and f2 (S(t)J(t), N(t)), respectively. After an instance of infection
the infected move into the exposed compartment E(t) where remains for an average 1/γ
days. (Hence, γ is the per capita rate with which the exposed individuals move into the
infectious groups.) Moreover, σ1 and σ2 are, respectively, the fractions of the exposed
individuals that move into the classes of the asymptomatically infected individuals I(t)
and the symptomatically infected individuals J(t). Hence, σ1 + σ2 = 1. For COVID-19
it is currently assumed that σ1 ≈ 0.8 and σ2 ≈ 0.2; we use these figures in our computations. Parameters ρ1 and ρ2 are the per capita removal (recovery plus death) rates for
the I(t) and J(t) groups, respectively. We assume that ρ1 I(t) and (1 − q)ρ2 J(t) are the
recovery rates of individuals in the I(t) and J(t) groups, respectively, and that qρ2 J(t) is
the disease-induced death rate. (Hence, value q ∈ [0, 1] is the death probability.) Moreover, in this paper, we assume that the individuals in J(t) class exhibit the characteristic
symptoms of the disease and, hence, are isolated, either at homes or in a hospital. We
assume that this implies that their ability to spread the virus is significantly limited and
postulate that βe1 > βe2 and β1 > β2 (and even βe1 ≫ βe2 , β1 ≫ β2 ) hold.
System (2.2) should be complemented by the corresponding initial conditions
(2.3)

S(0) = S0 ,

E(0) = E0 ,

I(0) = I0 ,

J(0) = J0 ,

R(0) = R0 ,

N(0) = N0 .

OPTIMAL STRATEGIES FOR COVID-19 MODELS

We assume that at t = 0 the values S0 , E0 , I0 , J0 , N0 are positive and R0 ≥ 0. Moreover,
the equality:
(2.4)

S0 + E0 + I0 + J0 + R0 = N0 ,

where N0 is the initial population size, holds.
We have to point that the precise forms of the incidence rates f1 (S(t), I(t), N(t)) and
f2 (S(t)J(t), N(t)) and, in particular, their functional dependence on population size N(t)
are currently unknown. However, as we are going to show below, the dependence of
incidence rate on population size is extremely important for designing of a quarantining
strategy. In the Kermack-McKendrick type models, it is typically assumed that the
rate of infection obeys the law of acting masses (see, e.g., [3, 4]), and, thus, the rate is
directly proportional to the product of the current numbers of susceptible and infected
individuals. Then the intensity of infection in the susceptible compartment, that is also
called the force of infection, has the form βI(t). However, for some infectious diseases
it is more appropriate to postulate that the force of infection depends on the relative
value (density) of the infectious individuals, rather than of their absolute number, and,
hence, is expressed as βI(t)/N(t) ([1, 3]). Under this assumption, the so-called “standard
disease incidence rate” is respectively defined as βS(t)I(t) or βS(t)I(t)/N(t). Since, as
we mentioned above, for COVID-19 the real-life dependency of the incidence rate on the
population size is unknown in detail, we consider both above-mentioned rates, namely,
the bilinear rates
(2.5)
and the “standard” rates
(2.6)

βe1 S(t)I(t),
β1 S(t)I(t)/N(t),

βe2 S(t)J(t)
β2 S(t)J(t)/N(t).

We believe that, with respect of the dependency of the incidence rate on population size
N(t), all realistic transmission rates are bounded by these two limiting cases. Please note
that, if the population size N(t) is constant, or if its variations are reasonably small, then,
in the absence of a control, these two incidence rates respectively lead to identical or to
a very similar outcomes. (See, for example, Figure 6.1 in Section 6, which demonstrates
the dynamics of the infective population for these two incidence rates in the absence of
a control.) Nevertheless, as we show below, if quarantine is imposed, the corresponding
control models are principally different.
Indeed, quarantine results in a reduction of the number of infectious contacts (either
through reducing a probability of passing the infection, or through a direct reduction of
the number of contacts, or, more often, through both these modes). What is of importance, this reduction equally affects all groups of epidemiological significance, apart from
the group of symptomatically ill individuals who assumed to be isolated in either case.
However, this later group is small, and, hence, we can assume that the reduction equally
affects the entire population N(t) as well. In each of the group affected by the reduction,
such a reduction is equivalent to introduction of the “effective epidemiologically active”
(that is, involved in the disease transmission) population: for example, if at the moment
t the number of infectious contacts of the susceptible group S(t) is reduced by a factor
v(t) (v(t) ∈ [0, 1]), then v(t)S(t) susceptible individuals can be considered as temporary
inactive (“removed”) from the susceptible group, and, hence, the effective susceptible population is (1 − v(t))S(t). As we said, quarantine affects all groups (apart from the group
J(t) of the patients with serious symptoms, who are assumed to be already isolated)
equally, and, hence, the effective numbers of epidemiologically active individuals in other
groups are (1 − v(t))E(t), (1 − v(t))I(t) and (1 − v(t))R(t), respectively. Furthermore,
N(t) is defined by (2.1). However, we already assumed that the number of infectious and

OPTIMAL STRATEGIES FOR COVID-19 MODELS

5

severely ill, J(t), is small compared with S(t), R(t) and even with asymptomatic infectious
group, I(t). Hence, we can assume that the effective size of the entire epidemiologically
active population is
(2.7)

e = (1 − v(t))S(t) + (1 − v(t))E(t) + (1 − v(t))I(t)
N(t)
+ J(t) + (1 − v(t))R(t) ≈ (1 − v(t))N(t).

Therefore, for the first of the models, under the action of quarantine the effective incidence rates f1 (S(t), I(t), N(t)) and f2 (S(t), J(t), N(t)) are βe1 (1−v(t))2 S(t)I(t) and βe2 (1−
v(t))S(t)J(t), respectively. For the second model, the rates are β1 (1 − v(t))S(t)I(t)/N(t)
and β2 S(t)J(t)/N(t), respectively. As one can see, the effect of quarantine significantly
depends on the actual dependency of the transmission rate on population size N(t).
We assume that model (2.2) is to be an object of control, and, hence, we consider this
model at a given finite time interval [0, T ].

with the initial conditions (2.3).
It is easy to see that the equations of system (2.8) together with initial conditions (2.3)
and equality (2.4) imply relationship (2.1) and that the value of N(t) naturally varies
(decreases due to disease-induced mortality).
For the sake of simplicity, let us perform the normalization of system (2.8) and initial
conditions (2.3), using the following formulas:

(2.9)

s(t) = N0−1 S(t),

e(t) = N0−1 E(t),

i(t) = N0−1 I(t),

j(t) = N0−1 J(t),
β1 = βe1 N0 ,

r(t) = N0−1 R(t),
β2 = βe2 N0 .

n(t) = N0−1 N(t),

r(0) = r0 ,

n(0) = 1.

Here s0 , e0 , i0 , j0 are positive, r0 ≥ 0 (further in this paper we will use r0 = 0 assuming
that we study an initial stage of the epidemic), and the equality
(2.12)

s0 + e0 + i0 + j0 + r0 = 1,

following from (2.4), holds.
Please note that normalization (2.9) converts equality (2.1) into equality
(2.13)

s(t) + e(t) + i(t) + j(t) + r(t) = n(t),

t ∈ [0, T ].

The important properties of solutions for system (2.10) are established by the following
lemma.
Lemma 1. Let system (2.10) with the initial conditions (2.11) have solutions s(t), e(t),
i(t), j(t), r(t), n(t). Then, for all t ∈ (0, T ], the solutions are positive, bounded and
defined on the entire interval [0, T ].
The proof of Lemma 1 is deferred to Appendix A. Lemma 1 implies that all solutions
of system (2.10) with the initial conditions (2.11) retain their biological meanings for all
t ∈ [0, T ].
Let us introduce a control function u(t) into system (2.10). We assume that this control
reflects the intensity of the quarantine. We assume that the quarantine implies “effective
isolation” of equal fraction u(t) in groups S(t), I(t) and R(t) (or reducing the number of
contacts of the individuals in these groups by factor (1 − u(t))), whereas the group J(t)
(the symptomatically ill individuals) is assumed to be already isolated and, therefore, its
status is not affected by the quarantine. The control satisfies the restrictions:
(2.14)

0 ≤ u(t) ≤ umax < 1.

These considerations, combined with the discussion of the groups effective population
sizes, lead to the following control system:

2.2. Model 2. For the incidence rates (2.6), the change in the size of the compartments
is described by the following system of differential equations:
 ′
S (t) = −S(t)N −1 (t) (β1 I(t) + β2 J(t)) , t ∈ [0, T ],

The corresponding initial conditions are defined by (2.3) and (2.4). Here β1 and β2 are

and symptomatic infected individuals J(t), respectively.

Substituting (2.9) into system (2.16) with initial conditions (2.3), we obtain the following normalized system of differential equations:

with the initial conditions (2.11).
The positiveness, boundedness, and continuation of the solutions s(t), e(t), i(t), j(t),
r(t), n(t) on the entire interval [0, T ] for system (2.17) are established by arguments
similar to those presented in Lemma 1.
Now, we introduce into system (2.17) the control function (the “quarantine intensity”)
u(t). We have to stress that, due to the difference of incidence rates, the effect of quarantine on model (2.17) is different (smaller) compared to model (2.10).
As above, we assume that the quarantine implies isolation of fraction u(t) in groups S(t),
I(t) and R(t), whereas the group J(t) is assumed to be already isolated. Furthermore,
group J(t) is comparatively small, and, hence, we can assume that
(2.18)

N(t) ≈ S(t) + I(t) + R(t)

and that the fraction u(t) of the population N(t) is isolated. These considerations leads
to the following control system:

satisfies restrictions (2.14).
Please note that for u(t) = 0 (in the absence of quarantine) systems (2.15) and (2.19)
become systems (2.10) and (2.17), respectively. The different manifestation of control u(t)
in models (2.15) and (2.19) shows why the dependence of an incidence rate on population
size N(t) is so important for studying impacts of quarantine.
To formulate the optimal control problems, let us introduce set Ω(T ) of all admissible
controls. The set is formed by all possible Lebesgue measurable functions u(t) that for
almost all t ∈ [0, T ] satisfy restrictions (2.14). For control systems (2.15) and (2.19), on
the set Ω(T ) of all admissible controls, we consider objective function

Here, α1 , α2 are non-negative and α3 is positive weighting coefficients. For convenience
of notation, in function (2.20) we below denote the terminal part by P .
In function (2.20), the first two terms reflect the COVID-19 level at the end of quarantine period [0, T ] and the cumulative level over the entire quarantine period. The last
term determines the total cost of the quarantine. We have to note that the actual cost
function is unknown. However, it is obvious that quarantining some groups, such as children or the retired, is comparatively inexpensive, and that the cost rapidly grows as wider
groups of economically active individuals become isolated. The quadratic cost function
that we use in this paper qualitatively reflects this situation and, at the same time, is
mathematically simple.
Please note that phase variables e(t), i(t) and j(t) are only present in the objective
function (2.20). Moreover, the first four equations of system (2.15) are independent of
variables r(t) and n(t). Therefore, the last two differential equations can be omitted from
system (2.15). Likewise, the fifth differential equation can be excluded from system (2.19).
As a result, we state the first optimal control problem (OCP-1) as a problem of minimizing the objective function (2.20) on the set Ω(T ) of all admissible controls for system

It is easy to see that for OCP-2 the assumptions of Corollary 2 (Exercise 2) to Theorem 4 (chapter 4, [13]) are correct. Namely, Lemma 1, which is also valid for the control
system (2.23) and (2.24), gives a uniform estimate for its solution (s(t), e(t), i(t), j(t), n(t))
corresponding to any admissible control u(t) from Ω(T ) for all t ∈ [0, T ]. In addition,
system (2.23) is linear in control u(t), and the integrand (α2 (e + i + j) + 0.5α3 u2 ) of the
objective function (2.20) is a convex function with respect to u ∈ [0, umax]. Therefore, all
these facts guarantee the existence of an appropriate optimal solution for OCP-2, which
consists of the optimal control u2∗ (t) and the corresponding optimal solutions s2∗ (t), e2∗ (t),
i2∗ (t), j∗2 (t), n2∗ (t) to system (2.23), (2.24).
To justify the existence of the optimal solution for OCP-1, we use Theorem 4.1 ([8])
(see also Theorem 5.2.1 ([5])). One of the key facts in it is also a uniform estimate
for the solution (s(t), e(t), i(t), j(t)) of system (2.21) and (2.22) corresponding to any

admissible control u(t) from Ω(T ) for all t ∈ [0, T ]. This estimate is a direct consequence
of Lemma 1, which also holds for the considered control system. Another key assumption
in this theorem is the convexity of the set:
n
F (s, e, i, j) = z = (z1 , z2 , z3 , z4 , z5 ) :

z1 = −s β1 (1 − u)2 i + β2 (1 − u)j ,

(2.25)

z3 = σ1 γe − ρ1 i, z4 = σ2 γe − ρ2 j,
o
z5 ≥ α2 (e + i + j) + 0.5α3 u2, u ∈ [0, umax ] ,
considered for an arbitrary fixed point (s, e, i, j) with positive coordinates (see Lemma 1).
For this set, such a property is established by the following lemma.
Lemma 2. The set F (s, e, i, j) is convex for an arbitrary fixed point (s, e, i, j) with positive
coordinates.
The proof of this lemma is in Appendix B. Lemma 2 and the previous fact guarantee the existence of an appropriate optimal solution for OCP-1, which consists of the
optimal control u1∗ (t) and the corresponding optimal solutions s1∗ (t), e1∗ (t), i1∗ (t), j∗1 (t) to
system (2.21), (2.22).
3. Analysis of OCP-1
To study OCP-1 analytically, we apply the Pontryagin maximum principle ([18]).
Firstly, we write down the Hamiltonian of this problem:

H(s, e, i, j, ψ1 , ψ2 , ψ3 , ψ4 , u) = −s β1 (1 − u)2 i + β2 (1 − u)j (ψ1 − ψ2 )
− γe(ψ2 − σ1 ψ3 − σ2 ψ4 ) − ρ1 iψ3 − ρ2 jψ4 − α2 (e + i + j) − 0.5α3 u2 ,

where ψ1 , ψ2 , ψ3 , ψ4 are the adjoint variables. The Hamiltonian satisfies:

Hs′ (s, e, i, j, ψ1 , ψ2 , ψ3 , ψ4 , u) = − β1 (1 − u)2 i + β2 (1 − u)j (ψ1 − ψ2 ),
He′ (s, e, i, j, ψ1 , ψ2 , ψ3 , ψ4 , u) = −γ(ψ2 − σ1 ψ3 − σ2 ψ4 ) − α2 ,

Hi′ (s, e, i, j, ψ1 , ψ2 , ψ3 , ψ4 , u) = −β1 (1 − u)2 s(ψ1 − ψ2 ) − ρ1 ψ3 − α2 ,
Hj′ (s, e, i, j, ψ1 , ψ2 , ψ3 , ψ4 , u) = −β2 (1 − u)s(ψ1 − ψ2 ) − ρ2 ψ4 − α2 .
By the Pontryagin maximum principle, for the optimal control u1∗ (t) and the corresponding optimal solutions s1∗ (t), e1∗ (t), i1∗ (t), j∗1 (t) to system (2.21), there exists the
vector-function ψ∗ (t) = (ψ1∗ (t), ψ2∗ (t), ψ3∗ (t), ψ4∗ (t)), such that

with respect to u ∈ [0, umax ] for almost all t ∈ [0, T ].
With respect to u, this Hamiltonian is a quadratic function of the form
−A∗ (t)u2 + B∗ (t)u − C∗ (t),
where

(3.4)

A∗ (t) = β1 s1∗ (t)i1∗ (t)(ψ1∗ (t) − ψ2∗ (t)) + 0.5α3 ,

B∗ (t) = s1∗ (t) 2β1 i1∗ (t) + β2 j∗1 (t) (ψ1∗ (t) − ψ2∗ (t)),

+ ρ1 i1∗ (t)ψ3∗ (t) + ρ2 j∗1 (t)ψ4∗ (t) + (e1∗ (t) + i1∗ (t) + j∗1 (t)).

Here function λ1∗ (t) is the so-called indicator function [19], which for A∗ (t) 6= 0 is defined
as
(3.6)

λ1∗ (t) = 0.5A−1
∗ (t)B∗ (t).

It determines the behavior of the optimal control u1∗ (t) according to (3.5).
By (3.2), (3.4) and (3.6) we can see that A∗ (T ) > 0 and B∗ (T ) > 0, and, therefore,
inequality λ1∗ (T ) > 0 holds. According to (3.5), this means that the following lemma is
true.
Lemma 3. At t = T , the optimal control u1∗ (t) is positive and takes either value λ1∗ (T )
or value umax .
Now we can see that the following lemma is valid.
Lemma 4. Let us assume that at moment t0 ∈ [0, T ), the inequality A∗ (t0 ) < 0 holds.
Then the inequality λ1∗ (t0 ) > 0.5umax holds as well.
The proof of this lemma is in Appendix C. The following important corollary can be
drawn from Lemma 4.

Equality (3.7) shows that for all values of t ∈ [0, T ], the maximum of Hamiltonian (3.3)
is reached with a unique value u = u1∗ (t). Therefore the following lemma immediately
follows from Theorem 6.1 in [8].
Lemma 6. The optimal control u1∗ (t) is a continuous function on the interval [0, T ].
Remark 7. Systems (2.21) and (3.1) with corresponding initial conditions (2.22) and (3.2),
and equality (3.7) together with (3.6) form the two-point boundary value problem for the
maximum principle. The optimal control u1∗ (t) satisfies this boundary value problem together with the corresponding optimal solutions s1∗ (t), e1∗ (t), i1∗ (t), j∗1 (t) for system (2.21).
Moreover, arguing as in [11, 15, 22], due to the boundedness of the state and adjoint
variables and the Lipschitz properties of systems (2.21) and (3.1) and relationship (3.7),
one can establish the uniqueness of this control.

4. Analytical study of OCP-2
To analytically study OCP-2, we also use the Pontryagin maximum principle. The
Hamiltonian of OCP-2 is
H(s, e, i, j, n,φ1 , φ2 , φ3 , φ4 , φ5 , u) = −sn−1 (β1 (1 − u)i + β2 j) (φ1 − φ2 )
− γe(φ2 − σ1 φ3 − σ2 φ4 ) − ρ1 iφ3 − ρ2 j(φ4 + qφ5 )
− α2 (e + i + j) − 0.5α3 u2 ,
where φ1 , φ2 , φ3 , φ4 , φ5 are the adjoint variables. The Hamiltonian satisfies
Hs′ (s, e, i, j, n, φ1 , φ2 , φ3 , φ4 , φ5 , u) = −n−1 (β1 (1 − u)i + β2 j) (φ1 − φ2 ),
He′ (s, e, i, j, n, φ1 , φ2 , φ3 , φ4 , φ5 , u) = −γ(φ2 − σ1 φ3 − σ2 φ4 ) − α2 ,
Hi′(s, e, i, j, n, φ1 , φ2 , φ3 , φ4 , φ5 , u) = −β1 (1 − u)sn−1 (φ1 − φ2 ) − ρ1 φ3 − α2 ,
Hj′ (s, e, i, j, n, φ1 , φ2 , φ3 , φ4 , φ5 , u) = −β2 sn−1 (φ1 − φ2 ) − ρ2 (φ4 + qφ5 ) − α2 ,
Hn′ (s, e, i, j, n, φ1 , φ2 , φ3 , φ4 , φ5 , u) = sn−2 (β1 (1 − u)i + β2 j) (φ1 − φ2 ),
Hu′ (s, e, i, j, n, φ1 , φ2 , φ3 , φ4 , φ5 , u) = β1 sn−1 i(φ1 − φ2 ) − α3 u.
By the Pontryagin maximum principle, for the optimal control u2∗ (t) and the corresponding optimal solutions s2∗ (t), e2∗ (t), i2∗ (t), j∗2 (t), n2∗ (t) to system (2.23), there exists the
vector-function φ∗ (t) = (φ∗1 (t), φ∗2 (t), φ∗3 (t), φ∗4 (t), φ∗5 (t)), such that:

,
λ2∗ (T ) = α1 α3−1 β1 s2∗ (T )i2∗ (T ) n2∗ (T )

which by Lemma 1, implies the inequality λ2∗ (T ) > 0. According to (4.4), this implies
that the following lemma that is similar to Lemma 3 is true.

Lemma 8. At t = T , the optimal control u2∗ (t) is positive and takes either value λ2∗ (T ),
or value umax .
Equalities (4.4) show that for all t ∈ [0, T ] the maximum of Hamiltonian (4.3) is reached
with a unique value u = u2∗ (t). Therefore, the following lemma, which is similar to
Lemma 6, immediately follows from Theorem 6.1 in [8].
Lemma 9. The optimal control u2∗ (t) is a continuous function on the interval [0, T ].
Finally, the arguments in Remark 7 are also applicable here. Specifically, systems (2.23)
and (4.1) with initial conditions (2.24), (4.2), relationship (4.4) and equality (4.5) form a
two-point boundary value problem for the maximum principle. The optimal control u2∗ (t)

OPTIMAL STRATEGIES FOR COVID-19 MODELS

satisfies this boundary value problem together with the corresponding optimal solutions
s2∗ (t), e2∗ (t), i2∗ (t), j∗2 (t), n2∗ (t) for system (2.23). Moreover, due to the boundedness of the
solutions for the state and adjoint variables and the Lipschitz properties of systems (2.23)
and (4.1), and equation (4.4) that defines the control, it is possible to establish the
uniqueness of this control.
5. The basic reproductive ratio
The basic reproductive ratio ℜ0 typically characterizes the ability of infection to spread:
it is usually assumed ([23]) that an epidemic occurs if ℜ0 > 1. If ℜ0 < 1, then the
epidemic gradually fades ([16]). To find ℜ0 for systems (2.10) and (2.17), we apply the
Next-Generation Matrix Approach [24]. For both these systems, the basic reproductive
ratio is given by the same formula:
(5.1)

ℜ0 =

β1 σ1 β2 σ2
+
.
ρ1
ρ2

Further in this paper we use the following values of parameters:
(5.2)

ρ1 = 1/14 = 0.071429 1/days σ1 = 0.8 α1 = 1.0
ρ2 = 1/21 = 0.047619 1/days σ2 = 0.2 α2 = 1.0
γ = 0.18 1/days
q = 0.15 α3 = 5.0 · 10−5
umax = 0.9

We also assume that
(5.3)

β2 = 0.1β1 .

For these values of parameters,
(5.4)

ℜ0 = 11.62 · β1 .

Table 1 shows the relationships between ℜ0 and coefficients β1 and β2 that are assumed
to be related via (5.3) and (5.4). Further in this paper we use the value of ℜ0 from
{2.5; 3.0; 4.0; 6.0} (see [6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 17, 25, 26]).

Parameters from (5.2) yield
ℜ10 (umax ) = 0.01β1 (0.8 · 14 + 0.2 · 21) = 0.154β1 ,
ℜ20 (umax ) = 0.1β1 (0.8 · 14 + 0.2 · 21) = 1.54β1 .
It is easy to see that for all values of β1 from Table 1 the inequalities
ℜ10 (umax ) < 1,

ℜ20 (umax ) < 1

hold. This means that quarantine with the maximum intensity umax = 0.9 should eventually stop the epidemic. It is also clear that for both systems the value of umax can be
reduced.
6. Numerical results
We conduct numerical study of OCP-1 and OCP-2 using BOCOP 2.0.5 package [2].
BOCOP 2.0.5 is an optimal control interface implemented in MATLAB and used for
solving optimal control problems with general path and boundary constraints and with
free or fixed final time. By a time discretization, such optimal control problems are
approximated by finite-dimensional optimization problems, which are then solved by the
well-known software package IPOPT using sparse exact derivatives that are computed by
ADOL-C. IPOPT is an open-source software package designed for large-scale nonlinear
optimization. In the computations, we set the number of time steps to 5000 and the
tolerance to 10−14 and use the sixth-order Lobatto III C discretization rule [2].
In the computations we use parameters from (5.2) and Table 1. The value of T (the
duration of the quarantine) is 15 days, 30 days or 60 days. The initial conditions are
s0 = 0.99985 (S0 = 107 − 1500) e0 = 5.0 · 10−5 (E0 = 500)
i0 = 8.0 · 10−5 (I0 = 800)
j0 = 2.0 · 10−5 (J0 = 200)
n0 = 1.0 (N0 = 107 )
Though we investigated these problems for ℜ0 ∈ {2.5; 3.0; 4.0; 6.0} and for time intervals
[0, T ], T ∈ {15; 30; 45; 60; 120} days, in this section we provide only the results for ℜ0 = 3.0
and ℜ0 = 6.0, as the most representative cases of average (ℜ0 = 3.0) and high (ℜ0 = 6.0)
virus infectivity, referring to other case, if needed. Table 2 shows “the number of active
cases” (i(T ) + j(T )) at the end of the quarantine for different T ∈ {15; 30; 60; 120} and
ℜ0 ∈ {3.0; 6.0} under each control strategy (OCP-1 and OCP-2) and without control for
Model-1 (2.10) and Model-2 (2.17).

and Model-2 on the time interval of 60 and 180 days. While the dynamics of the spread
of the virus in these models is very similar and mainly determined by the value of ℜ0 , the
numerical values of all the solutions are a little bit different. (See also columns 4 and 6 of
Table 2). We can see from the graphs in Figure 6.1 that under the same initial conditions
and parameters, the peak of proportion of the total sick carriers of the virus falls on
day 130 at ℜ0 = 3.0 and the 70th day at ℜ0 = 6.0 and is approximately 2, 200, 000 virus
carriers and 3, 800, 000, respectively.
Figures 6.2–6.7 present some results of computations for two optimal control problems
(OCP-1 and OCP-2) on the time interval of 15, 30 and 60 days.
Figures 6.2–6.4 show the results of computations for OCP-1 for 15, 30 and 60 days
of control (duration of the quarantine measures) for two different reproductive ratios
(ℜ0 = 3.0 and ℜ0 = 6.0). Figures 6.5–6.7 show the results of similar computations for
OCP-2. These figures demonstrate that even for a comparatively low basic reproductive
ratio, 15-day quarantine is insufficient to eradicate the epidemic. In particular, for OCP2, one can see that the graphs of j∗2 (t) and (i2∗ (t) + j∗2 (t)) do not even start to decrease.
(Please, note that the sums of the appropriate graphs (i1∗ (t) + j∗1 (t)) and (i2∗ (t) + j∗2 (t))
represent the level of the infectious at moment t for OCP-1 and OCP-2, respectively.)

upper row: i1∗ (t), j∗1 (t); lower row: i1∗ (t) + j∗1 (t), u1∗ (t).
Note that the results for ℜ0 = 4.0 are very similar to those for ℜ0 = 3.0. If the virus
is more contagious, that is for ℜ0 = 6.0, then the situation is worse: as one can see in
Figure 6.5, the hardest quarantine conditions give no acceptable result for 15 days, and
the virus continues to grow. The need for optimal quarantine management for at least
two months is especially well manifested in Figures 6.5–6.7 for OCP-2, if the intensity
of infection is high (see the blue curves). So, if we consider only a site in two weeks
or even in one month (Figures 6.5 and 6.6), then it can be seen that the number of
patients who may require hospitalization (j∗2 (t)) steadily increases over a site of 15 days
(j∗2 (15) > j∗2 (0) = 2.0 · 10−5 ), does not decrease in 30 days (j∗2 (30) > j∗2 (0) = 2.0 · 10−5 ),
and only when considering the quarantine of 60 days, a decrease in symptomatic patients
(j∗2 (60) = 1.75 · 10−5) is observed. Of course, for ℜ0 = 3.0, the situation with optimal
control is much better and the red curves j∗2 (t) begin to decrease almost immediately,
reaching a minimum value at T = 60, so that the approximate number of all infected
(i2∗ (60) + j∗2 (60)) is 230 people, which is much less than the initial value of 1000.
The results of the 30-day policy for ℜ0 = 3.0 and ℜ0 = 6.0 are presented in Figures 6.3
and 6.6. One can see in these figures, that at ℜ0 = 3.0 for both, OCP-1 and OCP-2,
the graph of j∗1 (t) or j∗2 (t) (symptomatic virus carriers) passes its maximum and starts
to decrease. However, it is noteworthy that at ℜ0 = 6.0 for OCP-2, the level of symptomatically infected j∗2 (t) is increasing even under the strongest quarantine measures. One

upper row: i1∗ (t), j∗1 (t); lower row: i1∗ (t) + j∗1 (t), u1∗ (t).
conclusion that has to be withdrawn from these results is that the importance of actual
dependency of the incidence rate on the population size N(t).
The blue curves in all Figures 6.2–6.7 obtained for the high infectivity level (ℜ0 =
6.0), show that the 60-day quarantine gives considerably better results for both OCP-1
and OCP-2. For both optimal control problems, even in the case of the high communicability of the infection, the corresponding graphs for the infection level pass their maxima and
start decreasing. Let us compare OCP-1 results with those for the uncontrolled Model-1
using Table 2 and Figure 6.1. Thus, for (ℜ0 = 6.0) without optimal quarantine policy, at
the end of 60 days there would be approximately 3,234,000 people infected (see the fourth
column of Table 2) and even more (3,800,000) at the peak of infection (see Figure 6.1).
Under optimal control (OCP-1) this number would be reduced to 107–108 infected at the
end of the 60th day (see Figure 6.4 and the third column of Table 2).
For the both problems, the optimal controls u1∗ (t) and u2∗ (t) should be kept as high as
possible from the beginning of the policy and till a considerable decrease of the infection
level is reached. Then the quarantine measures maybe slightly relaxed.
Since the impact of quarantine in OCP-2 is smaller (as it was explained earlier, in
Section 2, when the incidence rate types were discussed), it is not a surprise that the
corresponding optimal control u2∗ (t) is to keep the value of umax during almost the entire
time period. The optimal control u1∗ (t) should be maximal during the first month and

then different kind of restrictions can be slowly reduced, day by day. Although all our
numerical results show that the decrease in quarantine measures does not become zero
even at the very end of each restriction period, this fact is consistent with Lemmas 3
and 8.
We carried out calculations for both optimal control problems also in the 120-day
quarantine period, as can be seen from Table 2. Although the level of infection with such
a long quarantine does indeed decrease in comparison with the 60-day quarantine, the
optimal value of the objective function (2.20) increases, so as the cost of the quarantine.
In spite of the fact that, for example, for OCP-1, the number of infected at the end of a
120 day-quarantine would be 43 compared to 105 at the end of a 60-day quarantine, such
a long quarantine is simply impossible to impose and obviously it is unrealistic from an
economic point of view.
7. Conclusions
In this paper, we explored the optimal, in the terms of minimizing the cost of intervention and the infection level, quarantine implemented to control the spread of COVID-19
in a human population. To address this problem, we constructed two SEIR-type models.
We took into consideration that the real-life infection rate for COVID-19 is unknown,

and, therefore, the models that we constructed are different in the form of their functional dependency on the population size N. A bounded control function reflecting the
“intensity of quarantine measures” in the population has been introduced into each of
these models. We have to note that this type of control reflects all sorts of the direct and
indirect measures, such as quarantine, mask-wearing, various educational and information
campaigns, aimed at reducing the possibility of transmission of the virus from the infected
to the susceptible individuals. In our study we assumed that there is neither vaccine, nor
drug available for the disease treatment. By the term “quarantine” we mean all direct
(isolation) and indirect protective measures during a specified period.
The very first observation that should be done is that for these two models the impacts
of the quarantine is very different. This observation dignifies the significance of the actual
form of the dependency of the incidence rate on the population size.
For each of these two control model, the optimal control problem, consisting in minimizing the Bolza type objective function, was stated. Its terminal part determined the level
of disease in the population caused by COVID-19 at the end of the quarantine period,
and its integral part was a weighted sum of the cumulative level of disease over the entire
quarantine period with the total cost of this quarantine. Applying the Pontryagin maximum principle, we conducted a detail analysis of the optimal solutions for these optimal

control problems (OCP-1 and OCP-2) and thereby established the principal properties of
the corresponding optimal controls.
Based on the knowledge of the basic reproductive numbers, we estimated the values for
the control models parameters. For a variety of model parameters, we numerically fond
the optimal controls for different durations of the quarantine. The results of computations
that were performed using BOCOP 2.0.5 software are presented and discussed. One of the
notable conclusion that follows from these results is that the quarantine measures with
intensity umax = 0.9 (that is, a reduction of contacts to 10% of the pre-quarantine level)
is able to eventually eradicate the epidemic, and that the value of umax can be reduced
for both control models.
The results of calculations for both considered models and comparison of the dynamics
of the system subjected to the optimal control with that of the uncontrolled systems
(see (2.10) and (2.17)) confirm the undeniable benefits of the optimal controls. Thus, for
both no-control models, the fraction of the infectious (both, the asymptomatic carriers
of the virus along and the patients with symptoms) grows exponentially very quickly.
For example, for system (2.10), for a moderate value of the basic reproductive number
ℜ0 = 3.0, at the end of the second month the fraction of the infectious carriers (the
value of i + j for T = 60) in a situation without quarantine is 8.95 · 10−3 . On the other
hand, for the same parameter but with the optimal quarantine, this fraction is equal to

(See in Figures 6.4 and 6.7 the corresponding (i + j)-curves and Table 2.) The difference
in about 1000 times is apparent.
Our analysis and computations lead to the following conclusions regarding the optimal
control policy in the absence of vaccine and effective drugs for COVID-19:
• The COVID-19 epidemic can be stopped by quarantine measures, and the virus
can be eliminated by decreasing the level of infection below its survival level,
e.g., less than one secondary infection produced by one infected individual in each
location. This outcome can be reached even without vaccination, by quarantine
measures only.
• However, for both considered models short term (under 30 days) quarantine is
insufficient for preventing the epidemics. One should not expect that Even a 1month quarantine would be sufficient to decrease the infection to and below its
survival level. A longer quarantine, e.g. 60-days quarantine, is needed to get
decisive results.
• It is essential to keep as strong as possible quarantine for the most time of the
planned period. The quarantine restrictions can be gradually reduced only when
the infection level reaches a certain low level.

• For any quarantine duration, the control should never becomes zero, even at the
end of the predetermined time interval. This fact confirms our analytical results
stated by Lemmas 3 and 8. This implies that certain protective measures, such
as wearing face masks, avoiding crowds and maintaining strong personal hygiene
practices, should be continued and encouraged in the society even at the end of a
strict quarantine.
We also would like to stress one more time that the outcome of any study of a quarantine
crucially depends on the actual dependency of the incidence rate on the population size;
this is probably the most important factor for quarantine modeling.

Appendix A.
Proof of Lemma 1. Let the solutions s(t), e(t), i(t), j(t), r(t), n(t) for system (2.10) with
initial conditions (2.11) be determined on interval [0, t1 ), which is the maximum possible
interval for the existence of these solutions. Then, the first equation of the system can
be considered as a linear homogeneous differential equation with the corresponding initial
condition. Integrating yields
Rt
− (β1 i(ξ)+β2 j(ξ))dξ

s(t) = s0 e

0

.

This implies the positiveness of function s(t) on the interval [0, t1 ). Then, the positiveness
of functions e(t), i(t), j(t) on this interval immediately follows from the arguments similar
to those used to justify Proposition 2.1.2 in ([19]). The positiveness of function r(t) on
interval [0, t1 ) is a consequence of the corresponding differential equation of system (2.10)
and the positiveness of i(t) and j(t). Finally, the positiveness of function n(t) on this
interval is ensured by (2.13).
The boundedness of the solution s(t), e(t), i(t), j(t), r(t), n(t) on interval [0, t1 ) follows
from their positivity, equation (2.13), and inequality
n(t) ≤ 1,

t ∈ [0, t1 ),

which is a consequence of the last equation of system (2.10).
Moreover, if t1 > T , then the statement of the lemma is proven. If t1 ≤ T , then this
statement is ensured by the positiveness and the boundedness of the functions s(t), e(t),
i(t), j(t), r(t) and n(t), as well as the possibility of continuing these solutions over the
entire time interval [0, T ] ([9]).

Appendix B.
Proof of Lemma 2. Let us note that since the expressions for z3 and z4 in (2.25) do not
contain control u and the convexity of the set does not change under linear transformations, it is sufficient to establish the convexity of the set:
n

G(s, e, i, j) = y = (y1 , y2, y3 ) : y1 = −s β1 (1 − u)2 i + β2 (1 − u)j ,
o

y2 = s β1 (1 − u)2 i + β2 (1 − u)j , y3 ≥ 0.5α3 u2 , u ∈ [0, umax] .

To simplify the subsequent arguments, we introduce the following notations:
M = β1 si,

L = β2 sj,

K = 0.5α3

and auxiliary control:
w = 1 − u,

w ∈ [wmin, 1],

wmin = 1 − umax > 0.

It is easy to see that the values M, L, and K are positive. Finally, we will define the
quadratic function:
f (w) = Mw 2 + Lw, w ∈ [wmin, 1].
It is obvious that it is convex and monotonically increasing on this interval.
As a result, we obtain the following set:
n
o
H = y = (y1 , y2, y3 ) : y1 = −f (w), y2 = f (w), y3 ≥ K(1 − w)2 , w ∈ [wmin , 1] .
We will further justify its convexity.
Let us take arbitrary two points yb, ye ∈ H, yb 6= ye and a number λ ∈ [0, 1]. We consider
that they correspond to the controls w
b and w;
e w,
b w
e ∈ [wmin, 1] such that:
yb1 = −f (w),
b

ye1 = −f (w),
e

yb2 = f (w),
b

ye2 = f (w),
e

yb3 ≥ K(1 − w)
b 2,

ye3 ≥ K(1 − w)
e 2.

Next, let us take the point ȳ = λb
y + (1 − λ)e
y and show that ȳ ∈ H. This inclusion
implies the required convexity.
Now, due to the definition of the function f (w), we consider the quadratic equation:
f (w) = λf (w)
b + (1 − λ)f (w).
e

It is easy to see that it has a unique solution w̄ ∈ [wmin , 1] such that:
(B.1)

f (w̄) = λf (w)
b + (1 − λ)f (w).
e

Thus, we have the validity of the following equalities:
ȳ1 = λb
y1 + (1 − λ)e
y1 ,

ȳ2 = λb
y2 + (1 − λ)e
y2 .

Now, we consider the value (λw
b + (1 − λ)w)
e ∈ [wmin, 1] and show that the inequality:

(B.2)

w̄ ≥ λw
b + (1 − λ)w
e

holds for it. Indeed, this inequality follows directly from equality (B.1), the definition of
the convexity of the function f (w) and its monotonic increase on the interval [wmin, 1].
It remains for us to justify the inequality:
λb
y3 + (1 − λ)e
y3 ≥ K(1 − w̄)2 ,
where yb3 and ye3 are subject to the restrictions:
yb3 ≥ K(1 − w)
b 2,

ye3 ≥ K(1 − w)
e 2.

Indeed, due to the convexity of the function (1 − w)2 for w ∈ [wmin , 1], the monotonic
increase of the function η 2 for all η ∈ [0, 1] and inequality (B.2), we have a chain of
relationships:

λb
y3 + (1 − λ)e
y3 ≥ K λ(1 − w)
b 2 + (1 − λ)(1 − w)
e2
≥ K (1 − [λw
b + (1 − λ)w])
e 2 ≥ K(1 − w̄)2 .

This was what was required to be shown.

Appendix C.
Proof of Lemma 4. We assume the opposite. Let the inequality
(C.1)

λ1∗ (t0 ) ≤ 0.5umax

hold. Now we consider the possible cases for B∗ (t0 ).
Case 1. Let B∗ (t0 ) ≥ 0. Using Lemma 1 and the corresponding equation from (3.4),
we obtain inequality ψ1∗ (t0 ) − ψ2∗ (t0 ) ≥ 0, which leads to the contradictory inequality
A∗ (t0 ) > 0. Therefore, this case is impossible.
Case 2. Let B∗ (t0 ) < 0. Again, due to Lemma 1 and the same formula from (3.4), we
find the inequality:
(C.2)

ψ1∗ (t0 ) − ψ2∗ (t0 ) < 0.

By relationships (3.4) and (3.6), we rewrite the inequality (C.1) as

(C.3)
s1∗ (t0 ) β1 (2 − umax )i1∗ (t0 ) + β2 j∗1 (t0 ) (ψ1∗ (t0 ) − ψ2∗ (t0 )) ≥ 0.5α3 umax .
Using (2.14) and Lemma 1, we obtain the inequality:


s1∗ (t0 ) β1 (2 − umax )i1∗ (t0 ) + β2 j∗1 (t0 ) > 0,

which together with (C.2) contradicts the inequality (C.3). Hence, this case is impossible
as well.
Therefore, our assumption was wrong and the required statement is proven.
