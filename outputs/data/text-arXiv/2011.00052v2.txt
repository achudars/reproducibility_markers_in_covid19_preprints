A BSTRACT
Wearing masks is a useful protection method against COVID-19, which has caused widespread
economic and social impact worldwide. Across the globe, governments have put mandates for the use
of face masks, which have received both positive and negative reaction. Online social media provides
an exciting platform to study the use of masks and analyze underlying mask-wearing patterns. In
this article, we analyze 2.04 million social media images for six US cities. An increase in masks
worn in images is seen as the COVID-19 cases rose, particularly when their respective states imposed
strict regulations. We also found a decrease in the posting of group pictures as stay-at-home laws
were put into place. Furthermore, mask compliance in the Black Lives Matter protest was analyzed,
eliciting that 40% of the people in group photos wore masks, and 45% of them wore the masks with
a fit score of greater than 80%. We introduce two new datasets, VAriety MAsks - Classification
(VAMA-C) and VAriety MAsks - Segmentation (VAMA-S), for mask detection and mask fit analysis
tasks, respectively. For the analysis, we create two frameworks, face mask detector (for classifying
masked and unmasked faces) and mask fit analyzer (a semantic segmentation based model to calculate
a mask-fit score). The face mask detector achieved a classification accuracy of 98%, and the semantic
segmentation model for the mask fit analyzer achieved an Intersection Over Union (IOU) score of
98%. We conclude that such a framework can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of such public
health strategies using social media platforms in times of pandemic.

Introduction

1.1

Overview

The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has the world in its grips. The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared it as
a global pandemic on March 11, 2020, and with exponentially rising cases, there are currently more than 74 million
confirmed cases worldwide [1](as on 17th December 2020). Following WHO health advisories, most countries have
declared national emergencies, closed borders, and restricted public movement [25]. In such distressing times, masks
have been found to reduce potential exposure risk from an infected person, proving to be a successful measure to
suppress transmission and save lives [19, 13]. Many studies have recognized the importance of community-wide
wearing masks for controlling the pandemic [11, 33].

With its ease of access and global outreach, social media has a disproportionate influence on disseminating information
during a pandemic [17]. In recent times of the pandemic, social media has become a popular platform for people to
express their thoughts, opinions and broadcast activities. The general public and authorities have been using hashtags
like #CoronaOutbreak, #COVID19, and #mask to disseminate important information and health advisories, which
provides us with an opportunity to analyze behaviors and the impact of such advisories worldwide.
This study analyzes social media images from Instagram for (not) using masks and evaluates mask-fit using deep neural
networks. We curated a dataset of 2.04 million location-tagged images crawled from the internet. We focused our study
on six US cities (Table 1): New York City, Seattle, Boston, Dallas, Minneapolis, New Orleans.
Following data collection, we did a comparative analysis from images on each of these cities in terms of the number of
mask wearers and non-mask wearers. We observed the effect of the state government’s mask-wearing guidelines on
Instagram images from these cities during the pandemic’s early months. We additionally studied the mask-wearing
behaviors, including mask-fit, and derived a Fit Score for the same. Following data collection from Instagram, we
used face detection, facial landmarking, and semantic segmentation algorithms to quantify these indices in the six
cities. The facial landmarking algorithm detected the jaw region (mask location), which was then fed as input to the
deep learning models for classifying each face as “masked” or “unmasked” and semantic segmentation of mask v/s
rest. Since protests involve large physical grouping of people, we calculated our novel indices upon images from these
events, thus providing a significant opportunity to study compliance and analyze social media trends.
The rest of this paper is organized in the following manner. Section 2 talks about related works in the field of mask
classification and face detection. Section 3 presents datasets, models, and methods that were used for the study. Section
4 talks about our experiments, results, and the derived analysis. With our analysis on social media data we answer the
following questions.
1. How many people are wearing masks in images on social media?
2. If they are wearing a mask, then how good is their fit?
3. Is there any correlation between the COVID-19 cases and the number of masks worn when looked through
online social media?
4. How successful are the stay-at-home laws and mask-wearing mandates put by governments?
5. Was there any change in mask wearing behaviour of people, while they were out in protests?

Related Works

Social media has been extensively explored and analyzed for patterns that have emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic
[14, 9, 20, 21]. Signorini et al. [29] examined Twitter based-information to track the swiftly-evolving public sentiment
regarding Swine Flu in 2011 as well as correlate the H1N1 virus sub-type related activity to accurately track reported
disease levels in the US. Realizing the potential of social media in understanding such events, in this study, we utilize
the social media images from Instagram, a popular image-sharing social media platform.
There exists two datasets previously published for mask classification tasks, MAFA(MAsked FAces)[18] and
RMFD(Real world Masked Face Dataset)[22]. MAFA dataset contains 35,805 masked images. Since, the MAFA
Dataset was curated and released in 2017, it couldn’t capture different varieties and types of masks that have been in
use during the pandemic period. Also MAFA dataset is biased towards one kind of mask, it majorly consists of medical
staff wearing disposable medical grade masks. RMFD contains 7,959 masked images containing a variety of masks
used during the COVID-19 period. However, manual qualitative evaluation of the images revealed that the images were
not suitable for analysing high quality social media images. To the best of our knowledge, there exists no previous work
which is trying to analyse mask fit using semantic segmentation and a corresponding annotated dataset for the same.

Methods
Datasets

In this article, we use three dataset collections for classification, segmentation and analysis stage of the article
respectively.
Classification Dataset
For masked face images, around 30,000 images were collated from Google Search Images and Instagram explore tag
pages. Tags like ”people wearing mask”, “children wearing masks”, etc. [full list in Table 6] were used to scrape images

from google. Images from Instagram were also collected with the Tag explore feature, using these three tags: “mask”,
“masked”, “covidmask”. Post data collection, images with width and height of at least 50 pixels were kept, to ensure
decent quality of images. Then Face Detector from Section 2.2.1 was used on these images to extract faces. Then the
images of faces were distributed between 5 annotators, and annotators were asked to classify the face as either “masked”
or “unmasked”. After the annotations, images of 9,055 masked faces were obtained, which were used in Section 2.2.2
to train the classifier. This dataset of 9,055 masked images (VAriety MAsks - Classification (VAMA-C)) is publicly
available for use in use and further research at precog.iiitd.edu.in/resources.html.
For un-masked face images we made a random sample(without replacement) of size 9055 from VGGFace2 Dataset [10],
which is large scale face recognition dataset. VGGFace2, along with VAMA-C (2.1) was used to train the Unmask-Mask
Classifier in Section 2.2.2.
Semantic Segmentation Dataset
In order to evaluate whether the masks are being worn effectively or not using the images from social media, we need to
get pixel level annotations for a mask in a given image. For this we employ “semantic segmentation”. For training a
semantic segmentation based model, pixel-level annotations for the entire image were needed. Out of 9,055 masked
faces that we obtained from section 2.1, we selected 504 images with different poses and a wide variety of mask designs
and then annotated these images for mask fit analysis using Label Studio [32]. This dataset was then used to train a
semantic-segmentation model in Section 2.2.3. This dataset (VAriety MAsks - Segmentation (VAMA-S)) is publicly
available for use in use and further at precog.iiitd.edu.in/resources.html .
Analysis Dataset
For the analysis phase, we collected the location tagged public posts from Instagram between 1st Feb 2020 and 31st
May 2020 for six cities New York City, Seattle, Dallas, New Orleans, Minneapolis and Boston. The chosen time
frame captures the beginning and the growth of the COVID-19 pandemic. This collection was done for six major US
cities. These six cities were selected to represent different geographical sections of the country. We collected a total of
2.04 million public posts from these six cities. These posts were collected via Instagram’s explore location feature.
Instagram’s GraphQL API was employed for the data collection. The tools used have been published as a python PyPI
package at https://pypi.org/project/instagram-scraper/. The states and the summary statistics can be found in the Table 1.
2.2

Proposed Framework

The proposed framework includes face detection followed by landmark detection followed by classification and/or
segmentation, as shown in Figure 2 and Figure 4. A detailed explanation of each component in the pipeline is given in
the following subsections. The trained model was further used to conduct the analysis given in Section 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3.
2.2.1

Face Detection and Facial Landmarks Detection

Images, as obtained from sources mentioned in Section 2.1 consisted of various individuals. Thereby, to detect face
masks in these images, the first task in the pipeline was face detection. This was done using the pre-trained model
Retinaface[16], which is the top-performing model on Face Detection on WIDER Face(Hard) dataset[34] . Next,
facial landmarks were obtained using the Dlib’s implementation[24] of finding facial landmarks(Figure 1) proposed by
Kazemi et al.[23].
1. The landmark numbers 5-13, 31-36, 49-68 was used to filter the jaw region from the face. This jaw region
obtained was then used as input in the classification component in Section 2.2.2.

classification model, which is referred to as the jaw. The lower ROI is the nose mouth region, which is used while
calculating the fit score of a mask.

2. The landmark numbers 32-36, 49-68 was used to filter the nose-mouth region from the face. This nose-mouth
region obtained was then used for calculating the fit-score defined in Section 2.2.3.
An example of output of the facial landmarks on a face is shown in Figure 3.
2.2.2

Classification: Masked or Unmasked

After obtaining the image of the jaw from Section 2.2.1, the images were classified depending on whether a given
image of the jaw contained a mask over it or not. The following architectures were used for classification - MobileNet,
NasNetMobile, EfficientNet, and DenseNet since these have significantly fewer parameters than most other architectures
(Table 2).
The input image size for all the models was 224 x 224. Weight initialization of all models was done using ImageNet.
All the models were truncated at the last fully connected layer. The following layers were added: (i) Average Pooling
with 5 x 5 Pool size, (ii) Flatten Layer, (iii) Dense Layer with 128 hidden units and reLU activation (iv) Dropout layer

In order to train the classifier for detecting mask and unmask from the input jaw regions, the following base models are
trained : MobileNet V2, Nas Net, EffecientNet B0, EffecientNet B1, EffecientNet B2, DenseNet121. The total data
from Section 2.1 consisted of 9,055 masked and 9,055 Unmasked samples which were split into 80:20 ratio of train and
validation set. 5-Fold Cross validation is used to evaluate the performance of the trained models and the results are
shown in Table 3. The evaluation clearly indicates that EfficientNet B0 emerges as the best performing model with an
overall accuracy of 0.98 ± 0.01. We use this trained model for further analysis.
To visually inspect what the trained EfficientNet B0 had learned, we implemented GradCam [28] on the network.
GradCam assesses which parts of the input image have the highest activation values, given a target class. In this case,
we passed the jaw region after facial landmark detection as the input image to the GradCam network for three examples,
two masked and one unmasked. The corresponding activation maps are shown in Figure 5.
2.2.3

Mask Fit Analyzer

In order to determine the fit of the mask on the appropriate region covering the nose and mouth region of the face, we
trained the following network. A fit score was defined as shown in Equation 3 where, Region of Interest(ROI) was the
nose-mouth region from Section 2.2.1. Fit score is the percentage of area of ROI covered by mask (detected by the
segmentation model). This gives a perfect fit score if the nose and mouth are covered. To detect the area covered by

Masks
This Section presents the results of experiments conducted to evaluate patterns of people wearing masks in the six cities
across the selected time frame, 1st Feb 2020 and 31st May 2020. A total of 1.66 million faces were detected from
all the posts across the six cities. Out of which a total of 0.23 million faces had masks. Table 5 shows the City-wise
distribution of the detected faces and masks. 1.16 million posts(57% of the total posts collected) had no faces while
1.89 million (93%) of the total posts had no masked faces. One or more faces were detected in 0.87 million (43%) of
the posts, of which 0.61 million(30%) had a single face detected, and 0.26 million (13%) had multiple faces detected.

cases with percentage of masked photos

While in 0.14 million(7%) of the total posts, one or more masked faces were detected, out of which 0.12 million(6%)
had a single masked face detected. It is evident from Figure 6 that the number of posts drastically decreases as the
number of faces and masks increases.
A group photo is described as a picture with at least two faces detected. Figure 7, indicates that as the pandemic grew
and the lockdowns came into effect, group posting decreased significantly, implying that the lockdowns and social
distances measures were successful as seen through the images posted on Instagram.
We studied and compared the number of people wearing masks across the six cities using monthly percentages of
masked faces. For each city, the dataset was divided into months, and the percentages of people wearing masks were
computed. Figure 9 shows the monthly percentages of mask-wearers for each of the six cities. A general increasing
trend is seen across all the cities, implying that more people started wearing masks as the pandemic grew in each city.
We also checked for correlation of Covid-19 cases with the percentage of people wearing masks in the cities’ respective
states. We compared the lagged series of cumulative Covid-19 cases with the percentage of masked photos daily. Figure
8 shows the correlation for every city with the appropriate lag value for the Covid-19 cases series. We observe the
highest correlations in Minneapolis and Seattle. The lag was selected between 0 and 14 based on the highest correlation
value. Most of the cities have a maximum correlation at a lag of one day. Therefore, an increase in the number of masks
is seen a day after, a spike in the number of cases.
3.2

Impact of Government Policies

This subsection analyzes how social media behavior changed when wearing masks guidelines and stay-at-home laws
were put in place by respective state governments.
Stay At Home Laws
Fig 10 shows the average percentage of group pictures being posted for each of the six cities before and after the
stay-at-home laws were put into place. We see a decrease in the percentages after the stay at home mandates are applied.
1. Boston Department of Public Health issued a two-week stay-at-home advisory on March 23, 2020 [2] following
which a drop of 2% was seen in the percentage of group pictures.
2. For Minneapolis, stay-at-home advisory came into effect on March 27, 2020 [3] following which a drop of
1.6% was observed in percentage of group pictures .
3. New Orleans observed a drop of 0.58% in number of group pics, post stay-at-home orders starting March 20,
2020 [4].
4. Dallas saw a drop of 2.8 % in the number of group pics after March 23, 2020 [26], after application of
stay-at-home orders.
5. Seattle observed a drop of 1.3 % after stay-at-home order on May 31, 2020 [5].

Mask Wearing mandates
Fig 11 shows the percentage of people wearing masks before and after the state mask mandates were applied for the 3
cities who implemented these mandates within our selected time range. We see an increase in the percentages after the
mandates are put in place for all of the four cities, showing that these mandates were useful.
1. In Boston, residents were asked to wear a mask in public places starting May 6, 2020 [2]. An increase of 3%
was seen in the percentage of people wearing masks, in the collected posts for Boston.
2. Mask wearing guidelines were put in place on April 30, 2020 for Minneapolis, encouraging people to wear
face coverings [7]. An increase of 7.4% was seen in the percentage of people wearing masks for Minneapolis.
3. In New York State, residents were asked to wear masks in public starting April 15, 2020 [8], following which
a drop of around 1% is seen the percentage of people wearing masks in New York City.

3.3

Protests and the Pandemic

The killing of George Floyd on 25th May 2020 sparked a series of protests[31] and agitation across the country. Protests
are designed to stimulate public action for social justice. Such protests involve the physical gathering of people, making
it difficult to adhere to social distancing and to wear masks. These protests provide an opportunity to observe how
people reacted in terms of wearing masks and social distancing during a pandemic. To study these patterns on Instagram.
We collected and used data for New York City and Minneapolis for the time period May 25th - July 15th 2020. These
two cities observed major protests[12].
We curate a list of trending tags and keywords during this period (refer Table 7). We refer to the posts whose captions
included these tags as BLM posts and the rest as Non-BLM posts. The classification and segmentation pipelines were
applied to the selected posts for the two cities.
Figure 12 shows the difference in the percentage of group pics between BLM and non-BLM posts, which implies that
a significant number of posts collected under the BLM tags had groups of people present. To get insight into how
many people were wearing masks during the protests, we compare non-BLM group pics and BLM-group pics. Figure
13 shows percentages of faces covered with masks in group pictures for Non-BLM, and BLM posts. There was a
significant increase in the percentage of people detected with masks, showing that a high percentage of people were
abiding to mask-wearing laws during the protests.

score of greater than equal to 90%
We employed the mask-fit analyzer from Section 2 on the BLM posts to get an insight into how well people wore masks
in groups during the protests. Figure 14 shows the distribution of the fit scores, for people wearing masks in BLM-posts.

Around only 45% of the detected faces had a fit score of ≥ 80%. This means that the remaining 55% had some major
part of their nose-mouth region not covered.

Discussion

This article presents two datasets, VAMA-C and VAMA-S, for classification and segmentation tasks respectively. We
develop a novel face mask classifier to classify masked and unmasked faces with an accuracy of 98%. We further
propose a mask-fit metric and a semantic segmentation based model with an accuracy of 98%. Using these models, we
analyzed how people wore masks in images of six cities in the United States using Instagram posts. We could not scale
it up to more cities because of the data collection process’s limitations.
A general increasing trend in the percentage of people wearing masks is found as the pandemic grows. We also find that
state policies proved useful in imposing mask-wearing and stay-at-home recommendations. A significant decrease in
the posting of group pictures was found for every city, post stay-at-home guidelines were put in place. A significant
increase in the percentage of mask-wearers is observed in the states, where state wise mask-wearing orders were
applied. We further analyzed the George Floyd protests in New York City and Minneapolis through Instagram and
found that there were significantly more group pictures for the protest-related posts than otherwise. 40% of people in
protest-related posts were found to be wearing masks, which is much greater than what was observed on average for the
unrelated posts for both the cities. On analyzing the mask-fit of people in protest-related posts it was found that a lot of
people were wearing masks with low fit scores and only 45% of people had a fit score greater than 80%. The analysis
presented in the paper takes into account only the faces present in the picture, regardless of its context. An addition
to the modeling pipeline would be an indoor/ outdoor environment detector, similar to Zhou, et al. [35]. Another
addition to the analysis could be selectively looking at the activity of certain user who are deemed as “influencers” on
the network. Their activity on the network can be analysed in conjunction with the activity of their followers. This can
help determine the role of social networks and the power of certain influential nodes in that network over the behaviour
other people during critical times such as a pandemic. A natural extension of this work is its replication across other
social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Baidu.
