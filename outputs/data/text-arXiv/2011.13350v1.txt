Abstract
Justifying draconian measures during the Covid-19 pandemic was difficult not only
because of the restriction of individual rights, but also because of its economic
impact. The objective of this work is to present a machine learning approach to
identify regions that should implement similar health policies. For that end, we
successfully developed a system that gives a notion of economic impact given the
prediction of new incidental cases through unsupervised learning and time series
forecasting. This system was built taking into account computational restrictions
and low maintenance requirements in order to improve the system’s resilience.
Finally this system was deployed as part of a web application for simulation and
data analysis of COVID-19, in Colombia, available at (https://covid19.dis.
eafit.edu.co).

Introduction

The Covid-19 pandemic brought with it both health and economic problems for public administrations.
Lockdowns [7], increased Government spending [3], and compulsory mask usage [4] were among the
measurements taken by governments. Some of these measures were claimed as necessary but were
unpopular among the citizens, mainly because of their economic impact, as well as the restriction
of individual liberties. Public policies during the Covid-19 outbreak should be based on holistic
approaches that consider health, economical and social variables in a given territory. There have been
some unsupervised approaches to establish the economic impact of Covid-19 pandemic([2] [10]), but
those studies are focused exclusively on health variables.
In this work we propose a system that generates clusters among Colombian regions based on Covid19 new incidences forecasts, health, geographic, demographic and economic variables (see Table
1). Hence, such clusters generate geographical regions with similar impact due to the pandemic in
several dimensions. This delivers public administrators a source to identify vulnerable population and
identifying the impact of policies in different regions, thus providing an extra input for the generation
and justification of public policies among uncertainty to contain the pandemic at a regional level.

Design

The system proposed consists of two parts. On the one hand, a forecasting model that predicts the
number of cases for each of the next 7 days in all 33 Colombian departments. On the other hand, a
clustering process that, with the help of some dimensionality reduction techniques, generates clusters
associated to each department.

Canada.

The forecast of new incidences is included in a vector representation that also contains the variables
shown in Table 1 for each department. Those variables are static in time, as it is assumed that they do
not change significantly during each week of forecast. The demographic and economic variables were
extracted from the official sources of the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE)
and the National Planning Department (DNP). The information of the geographical variables was
obtained from the official page of Colombia’s Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology and Environmental
Studies (IDEAM). The health variables are available on the official web sites of the National Institute
of Health (INS), and on that of the Ministry of Health and Social Protection.

These embeddings make a vector representation of each political subdivision of interest that contains,
the pandemic’s progression, economical, healthcare, geographical and demographic data. Then, the
embeddings are clustered (after applying a dimensionality reduction technique) and such clusters are
the system’s final output.

Implementation
Forecaster

The chosen forecaster model is a neural net that only uses the new Covid-19 cases as external variables
(this is due to the scarcity of APIs with updated public data). The series of new positive cases by
department have several peaks, explained maybe by delays in testing. To overcome this problem,
three features were included in the model. First, the input data is normalized by taking the logarithm
of the raw data. Then, an exponential moving average (equation 1), with α = 0.1, is computed for all
the new incidences series and used as feature(as is suggested in [11]). Finally, the day of the week
was incorporated as an input using an embedding layer.
vt = αxt−1 − (1 − α)vt

Encoder-decoder architectures have been satisfactorily used for time series forecasting [12]. In
particular, 2014 deep Mind’s wave net [9] proposed a way to stack convolutional layers to extract
features from sequence data, and keep the number of parameters in the model low. This last property
reduces the amount of computational power required to train and deploy the system. This is the
reason why, the used architecture consists of an encoder that is made of a series of blocks, each
one composed of a dilated convolution with 128 filters of size 2 and causal padding, a Dense layer
followed by batch normalization, and finally, a ReLu activation [6]. There were 6 of these blocks
with 1,2,3,4,5 and 6 as dilation rates, respectively. The decoder takes as inputs the encoder output and
one dimensional embeddings for the day of the week in the forecasted window, and then passes these
inputs through to dense layers with ReLu activations. The predictions are made by a dense layer with
the size of the forecasted windows as its number of units.
The net is trained using the quantile loss in order to predict confidence intervals. The 5, 90 and 50
quantiles are predicted, and the last one is taken as the prediction. Before computing the loss, the net
output is re-scaled using the last value of the exponential smoothing in the training window:
ŷt+1,..t+h = exp(N N (x)) ∗ It

Clustering

Once the inference is made, the forecasted mean of the predicted window is added to a vector that
contains all the other gathered variables. Those vectors are normalized and then, in order to avoid
the curse of dimensionality [5], a dimensionality reduction is done before applying the k-means or
k-medoids algorithm.
Three dimensionality reduction techniques were used. The first one, was a PCA that captures 90
percent of the original variance. Then, we used genetic algorithms for feature selection as they can
be used to improve silhouette scores [8]. Lastly, we tried two simple auto-encoders with the same
architectures. In the symmetric one the weights between layers are shared, thus reducing the number
of weights as pictured in Figure 2. Both auto-encoders were trained for one epoch.
We used silhouette metric to evaluate cluster consistency, as the popular elbow method is not ideal
to fit the clusters in production because it needs a person’s input. The system then uses the highest
silhouette obtained after clustering.

Results

The first set of experiments was to validate the forecaster net’s architecture. The baseline to beat was
an ARIMA model for each political subdivision (33 in total) trained on the whole history to predict
a 7-day window. A single net was trained to predict all 33 series with windows of size of 10 and a
forecast window of size seven. As seven is the total size of the test set, the net does not use any test
data to predict the forecast, hence avoiding data leakage. Another neural net was trained without
the day embeddings in order to validate the hypothesis that this feature helps to overcome series
with peaks due to delayed tests. The seven days chosen for validation was the week from August 23
to August 29. This time window seemed appropriate, as it was during this week that the pandemic
reached the peak of new daily infected cases in Colombia. The number of epochs used was four
and the optimizer chosen was ADAM with a learning rate of 0.001. The training data was the daily
number of infected people from March 3 until August 22.
The results are summarized in Table 2, the chosen metric to evaluate the forecast was SMAPE, rather
than MAPE as there were a lot of series with a value of 0 in several days and hence the MAPE could
not be computed on those cases. The SMAPE reported is the average SMAPE for each of the seven
days forecast for the 33 Colombian departments.

It is worth noticing that even though the neural net with the day embeddings had a better overall
performance, it actually did worse on average in Colombia’s Departments with the highest population
(Bogotá, Antioquia, Valle del Cauca and Atlántico ).
The second set of experiments were relative to the clustering process. Once the new cases of infection
were forecasted, those values were averaged and used as a feature for the data-set described in section
2. The results are summarized in Table 3.

For the case of the symmetric auto-encoder and the genetic algorithms, the suggested number of
clusters was very satisfactory (Figure 3). The clusters obtained from the symmetric auto encoder
embedings clearly distinguished the four most densely populated Colombian departments. In contrast,
the genetic algorithms produced one big contiguous cluster where only the capital city (Bogota) is
differentiated.

Conclusions

Machine learning methods could provide reliable systems to assist in the development of public
policies. In this work we proposed and tested a simple approach to generate groups of regions in
Colombia with similar social, economic and health impact by the Covid-19 pandemic. The results
obtained were satisfactory, the system naturally suggests five clusters and distinguishes departments
with high populations regions from their surroundings.
Important questions arise for future works, such as the analysis of cluster centroids to gain some
interpretability on the clustering process. Another downstream task is to compare the clusters
generated at different dates by the system, and try to identify patterns related to vulnerable population,
or the economic impact of a lockdown. We hope that this work will encourage more applications of
machine learning related to the development of public policies.
