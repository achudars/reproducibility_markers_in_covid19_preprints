Abstract. Public sentiment (the opinions, attitudes or feelings expressed
by the public) is a factor of interest for government, as it directly influences the implementation of policies. Given the unprecedented nature of
the COVID-19 crisis, having an up-to-date representation of public sentiment on governmental measures and announcements is crucial. While the
‘staying-at-home’ policy makes face-to-face interactions and interviews
challenging, analysing real-time Twitter data that reflects public opinion
toward policy measures is a cost-effective way to access public sentiment.
In this context, we collect streaming data using the Twitter API starting from the COVID-19 outbreak in the Netherlands in February 2020,
and track Dutch general public reactions on governmental measures and
announcements. We provide temporal analysis of tweet frequency and
public sentiment over the past nice months. We also identify public attitudes towards two Dutch policies in case studies: one regarding social
distancing and one regarding wearing face masks. By presenting those
preliminary results, we aim to provide visibility into the social media discussions around COVID-19 to the general public, scientists and policy
makers. The data collection and analysis will be updated and expanded
over time.

Introduction

Public support is essential for the success of policy measures. Support can be
measured from physical behaviours, but also from how people think and talk
about these measures, which is known as public sentiment [3]. As public sentiment (the opinions, attitudes or feelings expressed by the public) can directly
influence the implementation of policies [5], it is crucial for policy makers to
know the public sentiment of chosen policies and to take this sentiment into
account when deciding on new policies.
This preprint was last updated on December 21, 2020.

Given the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 crisis, having an up-todate representation of Dutch public sentiment on governmental measures and
announcements becomes even more important. However, it is uncertain how
public sentiment evolves when the perceived urgency of policy measures changes
over time, which is our main research focus in this paper.
The ‘staying-at-home’ policy makes analysing public sentiment towards specific policies by means of face-to-face research methods like interviews and questionnaires challenging, while classical online surveys could delay the analysis
results by the restriction of frequency. Meanwhile, about 2.8 million users in the
Netherlands use Twitter to share their opinions [28], making it a valuable platform for tracking and analysing public sentiment. It also allows for much more
and frequent measurements and better indication of changes over time in public
reactions. Therefore, aiming at understanding the variation of Dutch public sentiment during the COVID-19 outbreak period, we propose to analyse Twitter
data using machine learning and natural language processing approaches [34,36].
By analysing real-time data through non-invasive methods, we aim to provide a
cost-effective way to access public sentiment towards policy measures in a timely
manner.
In this paper we present the preliminary results of our data analysis. First, we
collected Dutch Twitter data and filtered the data based on predefined COVID19 related keywords. Second, we analysed the temporal pattern of Dutch public
sentiment during the period of COVID-19 epidemic in the Netherlands. Third, we
conducted two case studies to extract the public attitude towards governmental
policies of social distancing and wearing face masks. In addition, to enhance
the representative of the Dutch public opinion learned from Twitter data, we
collect additional data from comments on the news website Nu.nl and Dutch
posts on Reddit. This data is used for annotation, model training and analysis
(similar to the Twitter data). By presenting those findings, we expect to provide
a sentiment-oriented overview of social media discussions around COVID-19 to
the general public, scientists and policy makers.

Related work

Social media sentiment has previously been analyzed during pandemics such as
H1N1 [9]. Also the COVID-19 pandemic, despite being a relatively new topic, has
attracted many researchers from different areas, including social media analysis.
Abd-Alrazaq et al. [1] noted four main COVID-19 related themes on Twitter:
virus origin, contamination sources, preventive measures and impact on societies. Zhao et al. [39] identified topics and sentiment related to COVID-19 in
China. Samuel et al. [31] conducts textual analyses of Twitter COVID-19 data
to identify public fear sentiment. Several studies focus on bots [18] and misinformation [21,32] which influence opinions on social media. Chen et al. [8] show
that positive polarity government messages on social media result in higher public engagement. Cinelli et al. [11] identified COVID-19 related topics in various
social media, including Reddit and Twitter. They found that the ratio of mis-

information to reliable information was stable over time, however Twitter has a
larger percentage of misinformation compared to Reddit.
From a technical point of view, our sentiment analysis covers two perspectives: polarity analysis (whether a message is positive or negative [3]) and stance
analysis (whether a message is supportive of or against a given target [24]).
Stance detection has recently received considerable attention in the NLP community [22], for which neural networks with word embeddings have proven to
be effective [38,24]. An annotation and training approach for classifying hate
speech in COVID-19 related tweets using embeddings is described by Cotik et
al. [13]. Other approaches of interest for sentiment analysis include using lexical
and semantic knowledge bases [17], and unsupervised stance clustering methods
[14].
In more recent work, Miao et al. [27] studied the effect of the public’s response
on the pandemic measures in the United States by performing social media
analysis. They found that data distillation of data sets of other domains was a
good alternative for missing relevant training data. In related work, Addawood
et al. [2] showed that over 2020 the polarity of the public towards the pandemic
degraded in Saudi Arabia while Kurten et al. [23] performed a similar study for
Belgium and Xue et al. [37] did a world-wide study. In other work based on
tweets, Van Loon et al. [25] explored the relation between political preferences
and tendency to socially distance.

Data Acquisition and Processing

Our main data set consists of Dutch tweets collected by the twiqs.nl service
[35]. The analysis of this data is compared with comments from the discussion
website Reddit and the Dutch news website Nu.nl, where the general public can
add comments to news articles. We include data from February to November
2020 in this paper.

Twitter Data Collection

Twiqs.nl is a service from the Netherlands eScience Center and Surf which collects Dutch tweets and provided aggregated analysis to the research community
[35]. The service has been available since 2013 and currently harvests about
600,000 Dutch tweets per day. We use the data from February 2020 (the first
month a COVID-19 patient was diagnosed in The Netherlands) onwards. We
rely on the lang feature provided by the Twitter API to determine the language
that the tweet is written in. Tests with tweet replies indicate that our corpus
covers more than 80% of the tweets written in Dutch. An overview of the corpus
size can be found in Table 1.
3.2

COVID-19 Keyword Filtering

We filtered the general corpus to obtain only tweets that contain disease keywords, related topic words or related hashtags. The list of filter keywords is
shown in Table 2, which we selected based on four important categories related
to our research focus. Keyword filtering was done case-insensitive and longer
words containing one of these keywords as substrings, like the word coronavirus,
were also selected. The size of the filtered tweet corpus can be found in Table 3.
The differences between the numbers of tweets in the various months are
striking. We explore the reason of this diversity in Section 4.1. We also observe some topic drift among selected tweets, for example in February the discussion was often about foreign outbreaks while in March that shifted to the
measures (maatregelen) taken by the Dutch government against the pandemic.
Appendix D contains an overview of all detected new topics in Dutch pandemic
tweets.

Validation Data Collection: Reddit and Nu.nl

Considering the recent concern about groups amplifying minority opinions on
Twitter [16], we analyse Dutch public opinion from two alternative data sets to
validate our Twitter analysis results. In Table 3, we present the information of
corpora from those data sources, Reddit and Nu.nl.

Nu.nl is a widely used Dutch online news website. This website publishes news
articles 24 hours a day, and allows the public to respond to every individual news
article by posting comments. We have collected all comments on news articles
tagged Coronavirus 3 .
Reddit is organized in a large number of high-level topics called subreddits.
Users can post a message in a subreddit in order to start a thread, and other users
can post comments in reply to either the original message or an existing comment. There are a large number of threads related to COVID-19 on Reddit, for
instance a thread called “Megathread Coronavirus COVID-19 in Nederland” in
the subreddit r/thenetherlands has been active since March 2020. This thread
was one of the main sources of the Reddit posts included in this comparison
analysis. We collected all comments in the subreddits coronanetherlands, CoronaNL, CoronavirusNL and the Megathread Coronavirus COVID-19 in Nederland
of the subreddit thenetherlands. As we considered only the Dutch comments in
this study, we excluded about 10% of English comments in the Reddit data using
the Python package langid [26].
All collected Nu.nl and Reddit comments are assumed to be on-topic, therefore no keyword filtering has been applied during data collection. Note that the
Nu.nl and Reddit data sizes are orders of magnitude smaller than the tweet
corpus (see Table 3).

General Public Reaction and Sentiment

We perform a temporal analysis of Dutch public reaction by examining the
frequency of the COVID-19 related tweets and average sentiment (polarity) of
those tweets. We also take the regular press conference of the Dutch government
into account to analyse the correlation between public reaction and government
policies over the time period.

Fig. 1. Daily frequencies of Dutch tweets related to the COVID-19 topics. The line of
‘pandemic’ covers tweets with any of the keywords in Table 2, while the other lines
represent individual keywords. RIVM is the Dutch national health institute. The peak
of each line is around the date of an important pandemic press conference by the Dutch
government (March 12th, 2020).

4.1

Temporal Frequency of COVID-19 Related Tweets

The daily frequencies of Dutch COVID-19 tweets are presented in Figure 1. We
define COVID-19 related tweets as messages written in Dutch that contain any of
the eight keywords listed in Table 2 (case-insensitive and possibly as substring).
We found the most popular five keywords (i.e. corona, covid, rivm, lockdown
and mondkapje) and also plotted frequencies of tweets containing one of these
keywords. Finally, the frequency of tweets on social distancing was added (see
section 5.1 for a definition of such tweets).
In Figure 1, the COVID-19-related tweets peak around a press conference of
the Dutch government on Thursday March 12th 2020 (in which the government
announced the first national lockdown measures to stop spread of corona virus
in The Netherlands) and reach the top after March 15th 2020 (when the bars
and restaurants were closed). After that, the COVID-19-related tweets keep
decreasing in frequency. As noted in Table 3, the number of tweets containing
the selected keywords decreases over time until July when it started rising again.
There are two possible reasons for the decrease, either the topic became less
popular or people continue to talk about COVID-19 in tweets but without using
the keywords in Table 2 such as corona or covid.
To check these hypotheses a similar analysis is performed on the data sets
of Reddit and Nu.nl and their results are presented in Figure 2. The left sub-

Reddit posts (right). The lines of ‘pandemic’ covers tweets with any of the keywords

graph of Figure 2 shows the frequency of Reddit comments per day related to
COVID-19, which is consistent with the Twitter data. In this case the decrease
may be caused either by people finding other threads to post comments, or a
general loss of interest in the topic. Further analysis shows that the relative
frequency of keywords in the collected threads remains rather stable. Because
all the messages are about COVID-19 by default, the relative frequencies are
indicative of the way people talk about the topic. This data combined with
the tweet analysis therefore seems to support the hypothesis that the topic was
actually less popular in July 2020 compared to the preceding period, and the
hypothesis that people use different words to discuss the topic is not supported.
Interestingly, analysis also shows that a large number of the messages in
the Reddit and Nu.nl comments did not use any of the four popular keywords
in Figure 1, while all messages are about COVID-19. One explanation for this
may be that within long comment threads the messages may become less selfcontained than, e.g., a new tweet, which could influence the usage of keywords.
However, it is also possible that the Twitter analysis suffers from a large false
negative rate of COVID-19 related tweets that are not selected by the keyword
filter, even in the peak period around March 15th where keyword frequencies are
the highest.
4.2

Temporal Sentiment of COVID-19 Related Tweets

We used the sentiment module of the Python library pattern [33] to automatically assign a polarity score to each tweet. The scores are based on pattern’s
Dutch sentiment lexicon which contains 3918 words, mostly adjectives, and a
language-independent emoji lexicon with about 120 emoji. The sentiment scores

and detailed contents are given in appendix B. We also listed the content of several
events that happened on the date of local minima of the two lines in appendix C.

range between -1 (very negative) and +1 (very positive). Two-thirds of the tweets
received a non-zero score. An overview of the daily average sentiment can be
found in Figure 3. To assess the results, we compare our daily tweet polarity
scores with those of a similar study by the Dutch national statistics office [7]
and found a positive correlation (r=0.46 for February-June).
In Figure 3, the y-axis represents the polarity score calculated by our sentiment analysis approach, where a higher polarity score means more positive
attitude. We can observe that the average polarity score of Dutch tweets related
to COVID-19 was always lower than the general polarity score, which indicates
that, compared with general topics discussed in Twitter, the public is more negative towards COVID-19-related topics. Also, some interesting links can be found
between press conferences and trends of public sentiment. For instance, general
sentiment reached a low peak point on the date of the third press conference of
the Dutch government about the pandemic, March 12th (3), when the first lockdown measures were announced. More recently, the COVID-19-related sentiment
reached a high peak point on the date of May 19th (I), when the government
announced the first release measures. Because of these findings we conjecture
that the trend of average daily sentiment shown in Twitter is influenced by
governmental measures and announcements.
In addition, we studied the temporal sentiment development for all Dutch
tweets on March 12th in detail to investigate the short-term influence of governmental announcements. We found that the impact of the press conference is
visible in the evolution of the overall sentiment measured per hour. As shown in
Figure 4, the sentiment is relatively stable from 05:00h onwards, but suddenly

drops around the time of the press conference at 15:00h. The result indicates
that the reaction of public sentiment towards governmental measures and announcements can be captured in a very short time period from Twitter data.

Case Studies: Public Attitude towards Specific Policies

Besides the above application of sentiment analysis for COVID-19 in general, we
are also interested in public attitude towards certain topics (e.g. a specific policy
measure). In particular, we study whether the public opinion is supportive of or
against a specific policy measure, which is known as stance analysis [22]. In this
paper, we analyse the stance with respect to two national pandemic measures:
social distancing and wearing face masks.
We employed the machine learning library fastText for determining the stance
of tweets automatically. This library is used for on-the-fly training of word embeddings with subword features from the input data, as part of a linear feedforward neural network [4,20]. For each topic a classifier is trained with manually
annotated training data. After evaluating these models, the classifiers are used
to predict the stance of all other messages in the dataset in order to perform a
comprehensive stance analysis for the target topics.
5.1

Case study 1: social distancing

In our first case study, we assessed the stance of Dutch Twitter with respect to
social distancing. This measure was announced nationally on Sunday 15 March
2020. It recommends the public to keep one-and-a-half meters distance to each
other during social interactions. Note that this definition (and the corresponding
data collection) excludes the closely related topic of avoiding social interaction
with other people.

Fig. 5. Size of the training data related to the labeling performance of the best model
of the machine learner fastText measured on held-out test data. The larger the training
data, the better the performance of the learner. There is no indication of the performance plateauing and optimal performance seems to require more than 100,000 (105 )
manually labelled tweets. However we regard a 0.8 fraction score as quite satisfactory.

Data processing and annotation We built a query for social distancing
tweets interactively. Starting with the Dutch word for one-and-a-half (anderhalve), we compared the tokens in matched and unmatched Dutch tweets of
1 June 2020 with the t-score [10]. This produced three more interesting query
words: 1.5, meter and afstand (Dutch for distance). We repeated the process in
an iterative manner until no useful new query words appeared. In the end, we
use the query anderhalve followed by meter, or 1.5 or 1,5 followed by m, or both
afstand and hou* (Dutch for “to keep”) anywhere in the tweet in any order.4
We applied the defined query to our Dutch tweet collection of February-June
2020 and found 670,249 matching tweets (including retweets). We randomly
selected about 1% of the tweets (5,732 unique tweets) for annotation. These
tweets were labelled by a single annotator with respect to the question: Does the
tweet or tweet author support or reject the social distancing measure announced
by the Dutch government on 15 March 2020?. The annotation scheme included
three labels: Supports, Rejects and Other (for irrelevant tweets and tweets for
which the stance could not be determined). The annotator found 56% Supports
tweets, 24% Rejects tweets and 20% Other tweets. 400 tweets were annotated
by a second annotator to access the inter-annotator agreement, which proved to
be κ = 0.60 [12].
Stance classifier training and evaluation For training the fastText model
for stance analysis, we used ten-fold cross-validation on the human labeled tweets
in combination with a grid search to determine the optimal word vector dimension (10-300), number of training epochs (10-500) and learning rate (0.05-1.0).

Table 4. The parameter setting and performance of the trained stance classifier for
social distancing tweets

FastText consists of an integrated neural network architecture which estimates
useful word representations with a skipgram model [4] and classifies texts with
three-layer network based on a linear model [20]. For the setup of the neural
network itself we used the default settings of the fastText library. The dataset
was divided in 80% training, 10% validation for parameter optimization, and
10% test examples.
For our application, accurately predicting the stance label of each text in the
data is very expensive and unnecessary, given that we care more about the public attitude rather than individual opinion. We therefore introduce the fraction
score, which measures the performance of predicting the relation between Reject
labels and Support labels. The effectiveness of such proportion measurement has
been proved within practical prediction problems [19,6]. In this paper, we define
the fraction score as rpredicted /rgold , where r is:
r=

N umberReject labels
N umberSupport labels

(1)

We optimize the parameter settings based on both the accuracy of individual
prediction and the performance of fraction score. The optimal value of the fraction score is 1.0, however given that the classifiers predict more Support than
Reject labels their fraction scores are lower than one. The optimal parameter
settings and classification results are shown in Table 4. The baseline method
labels the given message as the majority class (i.e., support in case of social
distancing tweets).
To assess the effect of the training size on the performance of the automatic classifier, we performed additional 10-fold cross-validation experiments
with varying training sizes (but constant test sizes). The results can be found
in Figure 5. Both accuracy and fraction score increase for larger training sizes,
while there is no indication of the performance lines leveling off. This indicates
a potential for performance improvement with more annotated training data.
Stance analysis Next, we applied the trained fastText model (optimized by
the fraction score) for labelling the tweets of February–November 2020. The
temporal rates of Supports, Rejects and Other tweets can be found in Figure 6
(green line). After initially being high in March (95%), the support gradually

support has increased.

decreases to below 50% in June. This is consistent with reports by the Dutch
health authority RIVM on public support for the measure [29]. On the other
hand, the graph also shows an increasing support on Twitter for the social
distancing measure in June and July, which was not immediately reported by the
health authorities. Eventually the rise in support for the measure was confirmed
by the RIVM in September 2020 [30], based on questionnaires filled in by its
general public panel. The fact that social media analysis picked up this change
supports the validity of this type of analysis.
A confounding issue is the activity of fringe groups amplifying minority opinions on Twitter [16], which may influence stance measurements based on tweets.
For this reason we applied the same classification model to assess the stances of
messages on social distancing from the other two platforms, Reddit and Nu.nl.
The temporal stances on all three platforms are presented in Figure 6. We can
find a similar trend among all three platforms that validates our Twitter analysis. The related data volume on Reddit and Nu.nl is a lot lower than on Twitter.
For Reddit, as only around 3000 messages are found in 5 months, the result may
have been influenced by noise.
5.2

Case study 2: face masks

In our second case study, we focused on the specific Dutch policy measure on
wearing face masks (Dutch: mondkapjes). At the start of the pandemic the Dutch
health organization RIVM advised against the use of face masks by the general

PuReGoMe Report

Fig. 7. Development of the support for the April policy on the general public not
wearing face masks on Reddit (blue), the Dutch news site Nu.nl (orange) and Twitter
(green). On Twitter and on Nu.nl there is a rejection of the policy over time at stable
rates, although at different absolute levels. On Reddit the policy is rejected as well
but the rate shows more variance over time. Note that the Reddit graph was based on
fewer data (2,134 posts vs 34,943 Nu.nl comments and 730,655 tweets). Face masks
became mandatory in Dutch public transport in June and in Dutch public buildings
in December.

public because it deemed the other measures (social distancing in combination
with frequent hand washing) sufficient. Since June 2020 the policy has changed
gradually, with face masks being mandatory in public buildings since December 2020. For annotation we used the original policy, for which the annotator
answered the question What is the opinion of the tweet about the RIVM policy advising against the use of face masks by the general public?. Similar to the
social distancing data, 578 tweets and 744 Nu.nl comments that contained the
word mondkapje were annotated by a single annotator with one of three labels:
Supports, Rejects and Other. Then, a trained fastText model was built from the
labelled data. Based on this model, the labelling results of all tweets, comments
and posts containing the word mondkapje can be found in Figure 7.
We found that most of the tweets (85%) and most Nu.nl comments (75%)
rejected the policy. There were too few Reddit posts on this topic to obtain an
accurate picture over time but the stance was also less than 50% supportive.
Two examples of frequent opinions (translated to English) are as follows:
Face masks are useless: corona droplets do not travel more than 1.5m. Is this a
scientific conclusion of the RIVM? Or is it a fake argument because of shortages?
2008 RIVM scientist says that face masks reduce infections and have effect.

14

Wang, Schraagen, Tjong Kim Sang, Dastani

Broadly I agree. But with respect to face masks I refer to scientists in our neighboring countries. They have another opinion than the RIVM, So yes... who is
right?
A possible reason for the stance being more supportive on Nu.nl than on
Twitter is that the comments on Nu.nl are actively moderated while tweets are
not, leaving less room for trolls to attack the government policy. This finding
also indicates the importance of capturing the public reactions across different
sources.

Discussion and Future Work

We present a first analysis of Dutch tweets related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
We concentrate on online public reactions towards the measures taken by the
government against the spread of the corona virus. Our analysis shows that the
pandemic generated large interest on Dutch Twitter with tens of thousands of
tweets on the topic each day. The sentiment of the COVID-19-related topic tends
to be more negative than that of Dutch tweets on average. We also found that
national press conferences about governmental measures and announcements
(e.g. the first national press conference about the lockdown policy) can influence
public sentiment, and furthermore the impact on tweet sentiment can be captured in a very short time period. However, we did not find a direct correlation
between all press conferences and trends of public sentiment. We would like to
investigate the influence of governmental measures and announcements in more
detailed analysis. In future work, we also see the potential to explain temporal trends of the public sentiment by linking these trends to daily numbers of
infections and deaths in the Netherlands.
In two case studies we assessed the stance of Dutch tweets on the national
advice on social distancing and on wearing face masks. The analysis showed that
people widely supported social distancing when the measure was announced
in March, then support declined until June and increased again recently. We
think this phenomenon may be related to the the pandemic situation in the
Netherlands (the number of reported COVID-19 patients has also decreased and
increased during this time, as shown in Appendix A). With respect to face masks,
analysis showed that the public widely rejected the initial government position
that face masks are useless for the general public. The rejection rates remained
relatively stable over the past months.
As future work, we are interested in performing stance analysis regarding
other policy measures, like compulsory school closing and infection testing. In
order to be able to tackle stance across topics with machine learning, some
initial manual annotation needs to be done for each of these new topics. Active
learning [15] could be an interesting approach for limiting the burden of this
task. This method identifies the parts of the data for which annotation would
be most beneficial to the machine learner and thus limits the effort required for
performing the manual annotation process.

From a practical perspective, we would like to improve the explainability of
our analysis results. We are collaborating with social scientists, who use quantitative methods (i.e. online questionnaires and interviews) to investigate the
influence of policy measures on the general public.
We are also interested in a geographic separation of the data. Some tweets
contain location information which would be useful for detecting Dutch tweets
from other countries, like Belgium, which we want to exclude. But the location
information could also be used for dividing The Netherlands in regions and
look for regional differences in attitudes towards government policies. If such
differences were found, they could possibly help explain regional variances in the
spread of the virus.
