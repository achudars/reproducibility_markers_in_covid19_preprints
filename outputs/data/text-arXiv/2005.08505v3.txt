Abstract

time of widespread Internet access. This digitization enables researchers to explore the impact of the pandemic across society by
analyzing how it has impacted users’ digital traces. For instance,
Wikipedia, the world’s largest encyclopedia and one of the most
visited sites on the Web, captures rich digital traces from readers
and makes them publicly available in aggregated form. Wikipedia
is used hundreds of millions of times each day to address a wide
spectrum of information needs, ranging from getting information
to make personal decisions to reading up on something that was
discussed in the media [12].
In this context, we study the effect of the pandemic and its associated shifts in needs, interests, and concerns affects the global
readership of a key information source on the internet Moreover,
the conveniences of Wikipedia access data do not end there, since
its usage offers solutions to the aforementioned challenges. Analyzing Wikipedia logs allows us to address the issue of scale,
since Wikipedia has versions for languages spoken all over the
globe, and also the challenge of immediacy, since the “alwayson” nature of usage logs enables the careful inspection on how
information seeking patterns evolved through time.

We study how the COVID-19 pandemic, alongside the severe mobility
restrictions that ensued, has impacted information access on Wikipedia,
the world’s largest online encyclopedia. A longitudinal analysis that
combines pageview statistics for 12 Wikipedia language editions with
mobility reports published by Apple and Google reveals massive shifts
in the volume and the nature of information seeking patterns amidst
the pandemic. Interestingly, while we observe a transient increase in
Wikipedia’s pageview volume following mobility restrictions, the nature
of information sought was impacted more permanently. These changes
are most pronounced for language editions associated with countries
in which the most severe mobility restrictions were implemented. We
also find that articles belonging to different topics behaved differently;
e.g., attention towards entertainment-related topics is lingering and even
increasing, while the interest in health-and biology-related topics was
either small or transient. Our results highlight the utility of Wikipedia
for studying how the pandemic affected people’s needs, interests, and
concerns.

may act as an initial starting point for further research on the

Methods and Data. Our analyses combine Wikipedia access
logs, mobility reports made available by Apple and Google, and
information on the dates of non-pharmaceutical interventions. We
enrich the Wikipedia access logs in different ways, categorizing
articles as COVID-19-related or not, attributing articles to a series
of predefined “topics,” and calculating how distant from normal is
the distribution of views over articles. Also, we calculate relevant
points-in-time related to mobility change: capturing, for different
countries, when mobility suddenly decreased and when it returned
to normality. Methodologically, drawing meaningful conclusions
from the longitudinal Wikipedia access logs is challenging due
to the presence of trends and seasonalities. We overcome these
hurdles by performing careful difference-in-differences analyses
in a regression framework. We detail our methods and the data
employed in Sec. 3.

related to the disease, finding a high prevalence of mis- or unverifiable information. Other studies that followed have found similar
and complementary results. [14] have also found a high prevalence of low-credibility information, which is disproportionally
spread by bots. [15] have identified and analyzed the drivers behind one of the main COVID-19-related conspiracies postulating
the spread of the infection to be related to the 5G standard for
cellular networks. Analyzing data containing conspiracy-related
hashtags, they found that a handful of users were driving the conspiratory content and that many of those using the hashtag were
denouncing the conspiracy theory.
Orthogonal to misinformation, but still relevant in the context
of an “infodemic,” recent work has also studied how social media
became a fertile ground for xenophobia and racism. [16] have
shown an increase of sinophobic and racial slurs in both mainstream and fringe platforms. [17] study how the usage of the term
“Chinese Virus” happened in social media, pointing Twitter as a
place of perpetuation of COVID-19-stigma.
While the studies discussed here detect and measure content
that may impact behaviors and beliefs (e.g. conspiracy theories),
we focus on the inverse question: can we uncover changes in
behaviors and beliefs through digital traces? We argue that both
these directions are important to the over-arching goal of understanding the social dynamics of the spread of the virus [18], since
to understand the impact of misinformation, one must be capable
of measuring people’s needs, interests, and concerns.

Findings. Our analysis of the trends in the number of pageviews
(Sec. 4.1) shows that there is a sharp increase in the volume of
information seeking in Wikipedia following sudden decreases
in mobility induced by non-pharmaceutical interventions. This
increase, however, is transient: our careful differences-in-differences experimental set-up suggests that in the long run, there is
either a decrease or no significant increase for 11 out of the 12
languages.
Considering not the volume, but the nature of information seeking in Wikipedia (Sec. 4.2), as measured through our "distance
from normality" metric, we again observe the same patterns: a
sharp increase following mobility drops followed by a decrease
after mobility returns to normality. Yet, here, our differences-indifferences experimental set-up suggests that part of the increase
remained, suggesting that the crisis’ impact in information seeking behavior had persisted through the mobility interventions.
Lastly, we zoom in into what kinds of articles received more
or less attention throughout the pandemic (Sec. 4.3). We find that
some topics, e.g. BIOLOGY, had transient increases or decreases
in volume, while others, had persistent increases (e.g. VIDEO
GAMES ) or decreases (e.g. TRANSPORTATION ). Overall, surprisingly, many of the topics with persistent increases relate not to
basic needs related to the pandemic, but to entertainment and
self-actualization.
We discuss our findings in the light of the research questions
and in the overall context of assessing the social impact of the
pandemic in Sec. 5.

Recent work has also more broadly characterized how COVID19 has altered people’s behavior across the internet, and how
digital traces can be used to better understand the pandemic.
A first, more broad theme in this direction is on how COVID-19
has increased internet traffic. [19] have shown that, as a result
of COVID-19 induced lockdowns, Internet traffic of residential
users increased by 15-20%. Traffic increases were observed in
applications such as Web conferencing, VPN, gaming, and messaging that people use when at home. Results in the same direction
have also been found in survey-based studies analyzing internet
time [20], and by a smaller-scale study measuring the increase in
the stress of a campus network [21].
Second, and more related to the work at hand, are works leveraging digital traces to understand the impact of COVID-19 on
mental health, economy, society, and human needs [22–24]. We
highlight two recent papers based on search data. [25] use Google
search data on COVID-19 specific keywords to predict the speed
of the spread of the disease. They find, for instance, that searches
for “wash hands” is correlated with a slower spreading speed of
the disease. [26] measure changes in human needs using search
logs from Bing. They find that, for variety of different “need categories”, there was elevated increase in search activity, and that
subcategories related to the most basic needs received the largest
boost.
To summarize, the outlined related work is complementary to
the study at hand. Having signals from multiple distinct digital
traces such as network usage, social media and search logs may
allow stakeholders to paint a more comprehensive picture of how
pandemic the impacted society.

The COVID-19 infodemic

COVID-19 was the first event of its magnitude to take place
in the era of social media and of user-generated content. The
important role that platforms such as Twitter and Facebook have
in today’s society has prompted researchers to study patterns of
virality and of information sharing in social media amidst the
pandemic.

collected in February 2020, with trending hashtags and keywords

Figure 1: Robust detection of mobility and normality changepoints
from Google and Apple mobility reports. The reports specify by what
percentage the time spent at various location types has changed, compared to a baseline period in January 2020. We use time series for all location types, with multiple changepoint detection algorithms and varying
hyperparameters. Given the abruptness of the decrease in most countries,
different runs largely agree; we use the average as a robust changepoint.
For languages spoken in multiple languages, e.g. German (right), we average mobility time series from the main countries where the language is
spoken (here 3), weighted according to the proportion of native speakers
(details in Appendix A.

Wikipedia in times of crisis

Finally, it is important to stress that our work extends a rich literature studying behavioral changes of Wikipedia readers amidst unexpected events, crises, and catastrophes [27–31]. In work that is
most closely related, researchers have used Wikipedia pageviews
in order to monitor and forecast diseases at a global scale [32, 33]
and to study anxiety and information seeking about infectious
diseases, such as influenza [34], H1N1 [35], and Zika [36].
Resonating with existing work, our results highlight the integral
role played by Wikipedia in times of crisis and its usefulness
to understand how these events impacted the behavior of those
who read it. Also, it is worth noticing that the differences-indifferences methodology we employ here may also be of use for
future research aimed at understanding how a given crisis has
impacted Wikipedia usage logs while accounting for seasonal
effects.
In the context of COVID-19, [37] have characterized the editing
dynamics of the English Wikipedia’s response to the pandemic.
They found users’ activity to be bursty, and that external events
seem to act as drivers of complex patterns of editor engagement.
Interestingly, the paper by Keegan and Tao studies “the other
side of the coin,” examining edits, while we analyze pageviews.
Expanding their analysis to articles that are not related to COVID19 in similar fashion to what we propose is an interesting avenue
for future research.

pageview statistics,1 which specify how frequently each article
was accessed daily between 1 January 2018 and 31 July 2020, aggregating both the desktop and the mobile versions of the site. The
languages selected as well as basic statistics for their Wikipedia
editions can be found in Table 1.
Enriching Wikipedia articles. To gain further insight into which
kinds of article people are reading, we enrich our page-view data
with two additional sources. First, we label each article with one of
57 topics based on ORES’ article topic model.2 We collect
the topic predictions (one page can belong to multiple topics)
from the model for each of the articles in English (the language
for which the model was developed) and link article across the
12 languages studied. Second, we idenfify whether each article
is related to the pandemic or not.3 Analyzing these allows us
to disentangle the changes in Wikipedia usage due to seeking
information about the COVID-19 pandemic from other, perhaps
less obvious patterns.
Pandemic timeline. Nine of the 12 languages are primarily spoken in a single country. For each country, we used Wikipedia to
manually determine 5 days of particular interest in the context of
COVID-19: first reported case, first death, ban of public events,
school closure, lockdown.
Two problems with employing the aforementioned days of interest in statistical analyses are (1) that it is not guaranteed that
they would impact movement patterns across different countries
homogeneously (e.g., it could be that for some of the countries
people stayed more at home even before the lockdown was enacted), and (2) that not all days of interest were observed for the
countries of interest (e.g., in Sweden there was no country-wide
lockdown before 31 July 2020).

Materials and Methods
Data

The analyses of this paper combine information about the content and usage of Wikipedia with information about the progression of the pandemic.
Wikipedia. We selected 12 languages that have Wikipedia editions of varied sizes. The choice of which language editions
to choose took into consideration: (i) the size of the Wiki, (ii)
whether the language was spoken in relatively few countries, (iii)
the kinds of non-pharmaceutical interventions imposed in these
countries. The overarching goal in selecting the languages was
to have relevant wiki projects representing different attitudes towards the crisis, preferably from languages easily tied to one
country (three criteria that are often impossible to simultaneously
satisfy). For each language edition, we obtained publicly available

2 https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/ORES/Articletopic
3 Based

on the article list in https://covid-data.wmflabs.org. The number
of COVID-19-related articles varies substantially across language editions; e.g.,
English has over 300, Swedish has only 9.

Mobility reports. To address these limitations, we turn to daily
mobility reports published by Apple and Google,4 which capture
population-wide movement patterns based on cellphone location
signals. The mobility reports specify, for each day, by what percentage the time spent in various location types (e.g., residential
areas, workplaces, retail and recreation, etc.) differed from a
pre-pandemic baseline period in early 2020. Both governmentmandated lockdowns as well as self-motivated social distancing
measures manifest themselves as sharp changes in the mobility
time series, which we detect automatically using changepoint
detection algorithms (Fig. 1, left; details in Appendix A). We
henceforth refer to these points as mobility changepoints. We use
mobility changepoints as heuristic dates for when people started
spending substantially more time in their homes. Unlike choosing
one of the days of interest, this leads to a meaningful “treatment”
across different countries.
Three of the 12 languages are spoken more widely than in one
predominant country: English, German, and French. As Wikipedia
pageview statistics are available only at the language level, not
at the country level, we determine a mobility changepoint for
these language editions by aggregating mobility reports for the
countries in which the language is official (Fig. 1, right; details in
Appendix A).
We emphasize that, since any Wikipedia edition can be accessed from anywhere (barring censorship), the link between
Wikipedia language editions and countries is merely approximate,
even for languages that are official in only a single country. This
should be kept in mind when interpreting our results, especially
for the English edition, which is read widely across the globe.
Additionally, we calculate another important “changepoint”
which does not represent an abrupt change in mobility pattern,
but rather, the point in time for which mobility returned to normal.
These are also calculated with mobility data: for a given mobility
time series, we compute the point in time for which the future average mobility remains within a 10% band around baseline levels
(defined as pre-pandemic mobility levels by Google and Apple).
In cases of languages spoken in multiple countries, we maintain
the same aggregation scheme as for mobility changepoints. We
refer to these as normality changepoints (also depicted in Fig. 1).

ity changepoint. The idea here is to capture what changes were
introduced by the sudden halts in human mobility induced by
non-phamaceutical intervention measures. In the second scenario,
Fig. 3(b), we compare the difference between 5 weeks after the
mobility changepoint and 5 weeks after things went back. Here,
we capture how information seeking patterns changed as mobility interventions waned. The third scenario, Fig. 3(c), compares
the difference in activity between two scenarios where mobility
was similar in 2020: 5 weeks before the mobility changepoint
and 5 weeks after (again, comparing it to the difference of the
same period the year before). If our first scenario captures “what
changed,” and our second scenario captures “what endured,” here
we are able to measure whether the pandemic led to changes that
endured through the non-pharmaceutical interventions. Lastly the
fourth scenario, Fig. 3(d), is an adaptation of the first for events
other than mobility (e.g. when the schools closed or lockdowns
were officially declared).
Notice that for some languages, we do not have entire 5 weeks
in our data after the normality changepoint. In these cases we
simply use all the data up to 31st of July, selecting the same period
in the year before.
3

Distance from normality

So far we have described the data we collected and the overall
study design. Here, we explain how we derive a different, more
generic signal that attempts to quantify attention shifts, that is
whether the pageviews are going to the same articles through a
period of time. We introduce a notion of “distance from normality”
as follows. In each day, the pageviews in a given language edition
form a distribution over articles, characterizing how users’ attention was distributed. We represent each daily distribution as an
“attention vector” with one entry per article and entries summing
to 1.
With over 6 million Wikipedia articles, many of which are
rarely visited, attention vectors are large and noisy. Therefore,
we first apply principal component analysis (PCA) in order to
project attention vectors into a low-dimensional subspace. In the
subspace, two attention vectors are naturally compared via their
Euclidean distance.
The notion of “normal” attention is captured by the average attention vector over all days of 2019, i.e., well before the pandemic;
and for each subsequent day, the distance from normality is given
by the Euclidean distance of that day’s attention vector from the
average attention vector. Notice that we calculate the attention
vector separately for each Wikipedia language edition using all
its articles and then perform the dimensionality reduction.
We use this metric in addition to the aforementioned topics to
broadly understand changes in the information seeking patterns
of Wikipedia, at page level.

Differences-in-Differences

We now explain our study design. Differences-in-differences
is a technique that mimics an experimental design with observational data, by studying the effect of a treatment (here, mobility
changes) on a treatment group vs. a control group [38]. The specific regression models are discussed as we present results, and
here we focus on explaining and justifying our setup, illustrated
in the left-hand side of Fig. 3.
We perform distinct differences-in-differences, comparing the
evolution of signals (e.g., pageview volume), during the pandemic
with the same time periods in the previous year. We specify the
pre-intervention and post-intervention periods for each scenario in
the treatment group, that is, in 2020. Then, for the control group,
these periods are chosen as the same dates in 2019.
In the first scenario, Fig. 3(a), we compare the difference in
activity between 5 weeks before and 5 weeks after the mobil-

Results
Shifts in overall pageview volume

We begin by examining the volume of information seeking
across the pandemic. To do so, we leverage the count of pageviews
across all articles for 12 languages. To distinguish between an
increase in information seeking about COVID-19-related articles
vs. the remainder of Wikipedia we analyze the two sets of articles
separately. We analyze the changes in pageviews for COVID-19-

Figure 2: Evolution of Wikipedia access for 12 language. Column 1: percentage of pageviews spent on COVID-19-related pages (logarithmic
scale). Column 2: total number of pageviews for all other pages (linear scales); solid: 14 January to 31 July 2020; dotted: corresponding period in
2019. Column 3: cumulative difference in total number of pageviews between study period of 2020 and corresponding period of 2019, reported in
terms of multiples of average daily number of pageviews in 2019 (y-axes identical across languages, except for Serbian, where cumulative volume is
much higher). Column 4: “distance from normality” with respect to topical attention (cf. Sec. 4.2) for 2020 (solid) and 2019 (dotted). All plots show,
as vertical lines, mobility changepoints and pandemic-related events.

crease.6 The eventual return to normal levels of mobility did not
seem to have any sharp impact on the pageview share of these
articles. We emphasize that these time series are plotted on logarithmic y-scales, such that a linear slope in the plots, even if small,
corresponds to an exponential rate of change.
COVID-19-related articles were generally among the most popular during the period of study; e.g., 12 of the 15 most accessed
articles in the English version were related to the pandemic. In
some languages, the fraction of pageviews going to COVID-19-related articles surpassed 2% on some days, a considerable share of
Wikipedia’s overall volume, considering that English Wikipedia
has over 6 million articles.

related articles through our diffs-in-diffs framework. We analyze
the overall historical trend of other articles, as compared with the
previous year.
Pageview trends in COVID-19-related articles. Wikipedia has
been shown to be an accurate and up-to-date source of COVID19-related information,5 and we start by investigating how heavily
this information was accessed by users. Fig. 2 (1st column) tracks
the popularity of COVID-19-related articles (as a fraction of all
pageviews) in all 12 languages over the course of the pandemic,
from 14 January (the earliest time for which mobility reports are
available) to 31 July 2020. Vertical lines in the Figure represent
the dates associated with noteworthy events (e.g. 1st case), as well
as non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g. Lockdowns).
In nearly all languages, the share of COVID-19-related pageviews increased up to the mobility changepoint (dashed vertical

to the creation of important COVID-19-related articles; e.g., the Swedish article

IN SWEDEN ) was created on 22 March 2020 and immediately received wide

majority. Their popularity during the period of study, in terms of
the daily total number of pageviews, is shown as solid lines in
Fig. 2 (column 2; linear y-scales). The dotted lines correspond
to the same period in 2019, precisely one year earlier.7 Notice
that in this plot, the y-scales vary per language edition, since their
sizes differ substantially.
A clear pattern emerges in many language editions. Access
volumes in 2020 closely mirror those in 2019 up to the mobility
changepoint associated with the respective language. Thereafter,
the access volumes of 2020 begin to rise up and above those for
2019 for nearly all languages. The trend is particularly strong for
languages spoken in the countries with the most severe lockdown
measures (e.g. Serbian, Italian, French), and it is weakest for
languages spoken where mobility-related interventions have been
weaker than elsewhere (e.g. Japan and Scandinavia). Finally, once
normality is restored (as measured by the normality changepoint),
we have that the pageview volume again aligns itself with the
quantities observed in the previous year. Again, for countries
with the weaker lockdowns, the "back to normality" effect is less
noticeable since the pageview counts never deviated substantially
from last year’s to begin with.
We further explore this relationship in Fig. 2 (column 3) via
cumulative plots, where the daily 2020-minus-2019 difference
is accumulated from 14 January onward. Since languages have
vastly different access volumes overall (cf. column 2), and to have
a common scale across languages, we express the cumulative
difference in terms of multiples of the average daily pageview volume attained in 2019 by the respective language. The increase is
dramatic for some languages; e.g., the Serbian Wikipedia edition
has experienced about 57 days’ worth of surplus access volume
between mid-March and late-July 2020, corresponding roughly
to tripling access volume, compared to the previous year. Strong
effects are also observed for Italian (27 surplus days at its peak),
French (21 days), Japanese (17 days), English (13 days), Dutch
(7 days), and Finnish (7 days). As mobility returns to normality,
we see this increase stabilize itself (e.g. Serbian, French), or even
decrease (e.g. English, Italian), aligned with previous analyses.
Note that 8 of the 12 languages (Italian, Japanese, Finnish,
Dutch, German, Korean, Danish and even Serbian) initially ran
a deficit, with Wikipedia being visited less in 2020 compared
to the corresponding days in 2019 (reflected as negative values
in the plots of column 3 of Fig. 2), but all except 3 languages
(Norwegian, Swedish, Danish) recovered and eventually ran a
surplus by the end of the study period.

factors: year (2019 or 2020), period (before or after calendar
day of mobility changepoint), language. We now model y as
a linear function of these three factors and all their two- and
three-way interactions. In R formula notation,
y ∼ year ∗ period ∗ language.

(1)

Difference-in-differences regression. In order to go beyond visual inspection and to quantify the shifts in pageview volume,
we take a regression-based difference-in-differences approach, as
described in Sec. 3.2.
In this setup, we consider, for each language a time window
of 100 weeks (70 days) split around either the mobility or the
normality changepoints in 2020, as well as the corresponding
time window in 2019. Each of these 140 days contributes one data
point per language, for a total of 140 × 12 = 1,680 data points.
As the dependent variable y, we use the logarithm of the number
of pageviews, and as independent variables, the following three

Here, a ∗ b is shorthand notation for a + b + a : b, where in turn
a : b stands for the interaction of a and b.
Pageview volumes were considered in logarithmic form for two
reasons: first, because raw pageview counts are far from normally
distributed, with numerous large outliers, and second, because
the logarithm makes the model multiplicative, thus implicitly normalizing the estimated effects and making it possible to compare
languages with different pageview volumes: if b is the coefficient
of the three-way interaction year : period : language, then eb
captures the multiplicative factor by which pageview volumes
increased when mobility dropped, after accounting for differences stemming from the year alone or the period alone,8 which
are already captured by the coefficients of year : language and
period : language, respectively.
The estimated logarithmic effects are plotted for all languages
in Fig. 3(a) (column 1). The results confirm the effects observed
visually in Fig. 2 (column 3); e.g., the logarithmic pre-vs.-post
mobility changepoint effect on the Italian version is around 0.38
(corresponding to an increase in pageviews of e0.38 ≈ 146%).
For language editions where the effect was less pronounced in
the trend analysis, we also find smaller (e.g. for Swedish the
increase was of approximately 8%) or not significant (e.g. Danish)
effects. Another set of interesting cases are languages for which
the increase in pageviews are was substantial but more gradual,
such as Japanese. Although it had a larger cumulative pageview
difference than English (17 vs. 13 in Fig. 2 column 3), here its
effect is smaller (0.10 for Japanse vs. 0.16 for English).
In a similar fashion, in Fig. 3(b) (1st column) we perform the
same analysis, but now comparing the 5-week period after the
mobility changepoint with the (up to) 5-week period after the
mobility indicators returned to their baseline values. Interestingly,
the results of this analysis are, to a large extent, diametrically
opposite of those in the first diffs-in-diffs setup. If before Serbian
and Italian were the languages for which there were the biggest
increases, here, the analyses suggest that they are the ones which
lost the biggest fraction of their pageviews. e.g., the logarithmic
effect pre mobility changepoint vs. post normality changepoint
is around -0.43 for Italian, (a multiplicative decrease of e−0.43 ≈
64% of the original value). Here, we find the stronger effects for
language editions where the trend was not noticeable in Fig. 2,
but recall that many of these languages were running a deficit of
pageviews compared with the baseline.
In Fig. 3(c), we fit yet another model that shares the preintervention with the setup in Fig. 3(a) and the post-intervention
period with Fig. 3(b). Its purpose is clear: since we observe a
increase in pageviews following the mobility changepoint and
a decrease following the return to normality, we now ask: did
changes endure through the non-pharmaceutical interventions?
According to what we observe in Fig. 2, most countries (9 out of

instance (cf. Fig. 2, column 2), Swedish pre-mid-March pageviews were
consistently lower in 2020 than in 2019; and Finnish post-mid-March pageviews
were higher than pre-mid-March pageviews even in 2019, without the pandemic.

12) have no significant changes in page-view access in the long
run. In fact, for two of them, Norwegian and Danish, there were
significant negative effects: multiplicative decreases of around
89% and 90% respectively.
Lastly, to study the fourth and last experimental set-up, we fit a
slightly different model:

that, not only this holds when considering all languages together,
but also that events associated with a mobility decrease are significantly more associated with an increase in pageviews than other
pandemic-related events.

y ∼ year ∗ period + language,

So far, we observed an overall increase in pageviews following mobility restrictions. Then once mobility went back to normal, so did pageviews. Next, we explore whether these shifts
affected pageviews evenly across articles or whether users’ attention shifted from certain topics to others.
Three different scenarios are intuitively possible here. First, it
could be that the increase in pageviews was not followed by any
changes in which articles people read: people read more of the
same. Second, information seeking patterns may behave similarly
to pageviews: once mobility was reduced, people start to read
different articles, but once mobility went back to normal the effect
disappears. Third, it may be that things did change coinciding
with the mobility restrictions, but then never returned to normality
(even after mobility and pageview counts did).
To gain a better understanding of what happened, we analyze
the temporal trends for the distance from normality metric (defined in Sec. 3.3) and perform the differences in differences in the
same setup as in Sec. 4.1.

where the dependent variable y is again the logarithm of the number of pageviews, language now merely serves as a languagespecific baseline, and year : period is the only interaction term
which captures the estimated effect in a language-independent
way. We fit this model not only for the case where period is defined by the mobility changepoint, but also where it is defined by
the 5 other pandemic-related events. This way, we may compare
effect sizes for the various events when used as “treatments”.
The estimated logarithmic effects are plotted for each event
in Fig. 3(c) (column 1) (R2 > 0.95 for all models). We find
that events that are more tightly related to decreased mobility are associated with the largest increases in pageviews. For
example, for mobile, the pre-vs.-post first-death effect is only
around 0.09 (e0.10 ≈110%); for school closure, it is around 0.16
(e0.16 ≈117%); and for the actual lockdown, it is largest, at 0.27
(e0.27 ≈131%). Also, as expected from the previous results, we
also find that the effect in the return to normality changepoint is
significant and negative, -0.11 (e−0.11 ≈89%).
This corroborates the previous results on mobility and Wikipedia access from yet another angle. Earlier, in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3(a)
we showed that languages spoken in countries with a stricter lockdown saw a larger pageview increase, whereas here we showed

Figure 4: Shifts in topic-specific pageview volumes. Effect of mobility decrease (and eventual return to normalcy) on relative pageview share of 57
topics, estimated via difference-in-differences regression, pooled across 12 languages. Again we use three different setups in order to capture how
things changed through different moments of the pandemic (see Sec. 3.2 for details). Topics are grouped according to their behaved given changes in
human mobility, as shown in the brackets in the right-handside. Error bars represent 95% CIs.

Difference-in-differences regression. To quantify the attention
shifts more objectively, we perform a difference-in-differences
regression analogous to the one in Sec. 4.1 (Eq. 1), but this time
with the outcome y being the logarithm of the distance from
normality, rather than of the pageview volume We again employ
the setups previously described and show the interaction terms in
the right-hand side of Fig. 4 .

to the end of September 2019. We observe that the (dotted) 2019
baseline curves stay flat around the mobility changepoints. If additional pageviews gained after the changepoints mirrored the average attention distribution, one would expect equally flat curves
for 2020. Quite on the contrary, however, the curves for 2020
increase sharply at the mobility changepoints, a clear indication
of large topical shifts in overall attention. Interestingly, we find
that these changes occur even for languages for which there was
no substantial page-view increase, such as Danish, Swedish and
Norwegian. This suggests that, although these languages were
not reading more, their information seeking patterns still differed
overall.

Overall, in the two first set-ups, Fig. 3(a-b) (column 2) we
find results similar to those we obtained in the pageview analysis.
For all languages, there is a sharp increase in the distance from
normality when comparing the period before and after the mobility changepoint with the previous year. Comparing the period
after the mobility changepoint with the period after the normality
changepoint, we find a significant decrease in the difference of
the metric relative to the previous year. Results are also similar to
what we observed for pageviews in the fourth scenario, Fig. 3(d),
where we compare the before vs. after for many pandemic-related
significant events. Here again, we see a gradation, where the
regressions for events more closely associated with mobility decrease (e.g. lockdowns) yield stronger effects.

As mobility returned to its normal threshold, we find that there
was a substantial decrease in our metric. That is, the distance from
normality became smaller after the effect of mobility restriction
interventions waned. Yet, it is important to notice that the new
state where it settled thereafter was generally larger than in the
previous year (e.g. ∼0.3 vs. ∼0.03 for Italian). Also, for some of
the language editions (Dutch and Scandinavian languages), we
see a second sudden increase in the metric around mid-July for
which we find no obvious explanation.
8

Interestingly the picture in the third scenario, shown Fig. 3(c),
differs from pageviews: here the distance from normality remains
higher than baseline for 8 of the 12 languages. This scenario
compares the period before the mobility changepoint with the
period after mobility went back to normal. This indicates that
attention shifted massively during the mobility restrictions but
settled in a new state after mobility went back to normal.
This suggests that a portion of the effect was transient, and
clearly associated with the mobility decrease. Yet, there was also
another part that lingered months after mobility interventions
waned. A plausible explanation for this phenomenon is that the social impact of the pandemic and its associated non-pharmaceutical
interventions have altered the interests, needs and concerns of
people in the long run.

in pageview volumes, we have plenty of entertainment related
subjects such as VIDEO GAMES, BOOKS and RADIO . Meanwhile,
topics that experienced a persistent decrease include geographical
locations (e.g. EASTERN EUROPE, NORTHERN AFRICA), as well
as topics clearly related to outdoor activities/leaving your house,
such as ARCHITECTURE, SPORTS and TRANSPORTATION. These
findings suggest that people shifted information seeking needs
from outdoor-related activities (e.g. SPORTS), to indoor-related
activities (e.g. VIDEO GAMES).
In the third and fourth sectors of the figure, we have topics
for which the increase or the decrease in pageview volume was
transient. A noteworthy topic that here is BIOLOGY, which may
have received a boost given the sudden importance of all things
virus-related, but that eventually, as people got used to the pandemic, returned to the normal levels of volume compared to the
previous year. After the mobility changepoint, as shown in column (a), pages related to biology had an increase of around 109%,
followed by a decrease of around 89% after things went back to
normal, as shown in column (b). Overall, comparing the 5-week
period before the mobility changepoint with the 5-week period
after the normality changepoint, the effect is not significant.
Lastly, the last five sectors of the figure are either topics that
observed a "reversed" increase or decrease,9 shown in the 6th and
7th sectors, or that experienced no change following the mobility
changepoint at all, in the 8th, 9th and 10th sectors. For the latter
kind, some topics also observed an eventual increase or decrease
in the diffs-in-diffs scenarios depicted in columns (b) or (c). Of
these last sectors, a remarkable topic is MEDICINE & HEALTH
which presents a substantial decrease overall, as shown in column
(c), but that did not experience an increase following the mobility
changepoint, as shown in column (a). We further investigated the
time-series for the topic and found out that this happened because
the shift in interest for the topic happened before the mobility
changepoint for many countries. This is aligned with previous
suggestions that the “panic” of the disease preceded its actual
spread [18].
All in all, our results suggest that while COVID-19-related
topics had transient increases (as in BIOLOGY) or no increase
at all (as in MEDICINE & HEALTH) following mobility restrictions, several topics related to entertainment did see lingering
increases. Similarly, several topics related to outdoors see persistent decreases. Importantly, although mobility returned to normal
in many places, the pandemic is far from ending. Thus, these
shifts may be either medium-term changes that will be reverted
once the pandemic is over, or long-term changes that will remain
for years to come.

Shifts in topic-specific pageview volume

So far, we observed a massive increase in pageview volume following the sudden mobility change induced by COVID-19-related
interventions, which was not explained by a simple proportional
increase according to the prior attention distribution (Sec. 4.1).
Rather, the increase in pageview volume was accompanied by
major shifts in attention (Sec. 4.2). Moreover, we have also found
that, although the shifts in pageview volume were reverted once
mobility restrictions waned, this was not the same for the shifts
in attention: information seeking patterns seems to have been
impacted in the long run. Next, we investigate the shift further,
with the goal of identifying which topics gained, and which lost,
attention, and also which of these changes remained after the
mobility-related interventions waned.
Again, we account for trends and seasonality by formulating
difference-in-differences regression models analogous to that of
Eq. 1. We hence use a model without a language term, but with
an added topic term (for notation, cf. Eq. 1):
y ∼ year ∗ period ∗ topic.

(3)

We code the 57 topics as 56 dummy variables, with one arbitrary
topic serving as a baseline topic. This amounts to 95,760 data
points, one for each combination of year, calendar day (35 days
before as well as after), topic and language. The outcome variable
y of interest is the logarithm of the fraction of pageviews going
to articles of the respective topic on the respective day. Again we
run models for different setups (here we consider only the first
three scenarios discussed in Sec. 3.2; R2 > 0.85 for all models).
Summing the coefficient of year : period : topic with the
coefficient of year : period (corresponding to the baseline topic)
reveals changes in topical interest around the changepoints of
interest.
Given the three distinct differences-in-differences estimations,
we are able to categorize different topics according to how they
behaved given changes in human mobility: Did they change? Did
these changes endure once mobility went back to normal? These
categories of topics are annotated in the right-hand side of Fig. 4.
In the first two sectors of the figure (the first two coloured
blocks), we have topics for which a persistent increase or decrease was observed. These topics experienced an increase following the mobility changepoint, as shown in column (a), which
was sustained once the pandemic ended, as shown in column
(c). Amidst the topics for which there was a persistent increase

Discussion and Conclusions

In summary, our findings suggest that the sharp decrease in human mobility induced by COVID-19-related non-pharmaceutical
interventions has boosted the volume of information seeking in
Wikipedia, and changed the nature of what is sought after, even
considering non-COVID-19-related articles (RQ1). Once mobility
returned to its normal levels, the volume of information seeking
returned to its expected threshold, but the kinds of content that

were sought after did not (RQ2). Lastly, touching upon both research questions, we zoom in into what articles received more or
less attention through this period. We find that some topics, e.g.
BIOLOGY , had transient increases or decreases in volume, while
others, had persistent increases (e.g. VIDEO GAMES) or decreases
(e.g. TRANSPORTATION).
In addition to broadly addressing our research questions, these
findings may be holistically evaluated to characterize the social
impact of the pandemic.
First, the trends in the volume of pageviews may themselves be
interpreted as a trace of the social impact of the pandemic. The
increase in information seeking that closely followed mobility
decreases and eventual returns to normalcy suggests that, once
we are deprived of activities halted by non-pharmaceutical interventions, we resort even more to information seeking in the web,
an activity related to entertainment and self-actualization.
Second, our analysis on the nature of what is sought after
suggests that the social impact of the crisis has persisted through
its associated mobility interventions. While this does not provide
answers on how things changed, it provides evidence that there
were long-term changes induced by the pandemic are not only
geopolitical or economic in nature, but related to human needs,
interests in concerns.
Third, our results suggest that most of the topics that experienced persistent increases (e.g. VIDEO GAMES and INTERNET
CULTURE ) are not related to needs often framed as “basic” such
as safety and physiological needs [39]. Although this does not imply that the latter were not increased,10 it nevertheless reinforces
that there was an increase in people’s need for entertainment, and
arguably, self-actualization.
An alternate angle in which we can frame aforementioned discussion is to consider not how Wikipedia logs sheds light into
the social impact of the pandemic, but on how this specific event
sheds light into Wikipedia’s role in the time of crisis. While previous work highlights how Wikipedia is able to provide crucial
information to millions of people amidst epidemics [34], we show
that things do not stop there. Wikipedia can also play the role of
providing information related to non-essential needs, and browsing Wikipedia becomes more popular once other activities are
hindered by an unexpected crisis.

pendently) that vary in intensity and when analyzing events that
are less or more related to decrease in mobility (Fig. 3d), and also
(for both the volume and the nature) how consistent the increases
and decreases in the signals follow mobility patterns (Fig. 3a-b
analyzed jointly).
Another limitation of this work has to do with the biases of
Wikipedia readership. Given the popularity of the world’s largest
online encyclopedia, it is tempting to try to generalize our findings to large populations. Yet, we must recall that this may not
be true due to uneven access to internet and varying levels of
digital literacy. It could be for example that the groups with the
largest increase in basic needs lacks the capability to access Wikipedia, and that we loose the signals associated with this important
population.

Limitations. Our study performed a careful analysis of the trends
in Wikipedia. As our findings are observational, such a causal link
cannot be conclusively established. Indeed, lockdown measures
and the ensuing decrease in mobility coincided with numerous
other life changes inflicted by the pandemic, and any of these concomitant changes—rather than the increase in time spent at home—
might in principle be the true cause of the changes in Wikipedia
access patterns; e.g., one might argue that an increased concern
about health issues might drive people to access more encyclopedic information. Nevertheless, our work presents circumstantial
indications that there is indeed a causal link between mobility and
the volume of information seeking (and to some extent also for the
shifts in the nature of information seeking). These include (for the
volume of information seeking) the dose–response relationship
between mobility and pageviews, observed both when analyzing
countries with mobility interventions (Fig. 3a-b analyzed inde-

and the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on COVID-19
in 11 European countries. Report, 2020.

Future Work. A further interesting causal question asks in what
activities people engage when forced to spend time at home. Answering this would require drawing conclusions from the particular lockdown that we are observing in the context of COVID-19
to general situations of restricted mobility. One idea would be to
treat COVID-19 as an instrumental variable [38], i.e., a haphazard
event that systematically nudges people to stay at home, while
affecting people’s interests only via the lockdown measures. It
would be interesting to explore whether COVID-19 can be used
as an instrumental variable to estimate, e.g., what books people
read, or what dishes they cook when they are forced to, or—let
the glass be half-full—when they are given the chance to, spend
more time at home.

Obtaining mobility changepoints

Mobility Data. To estimate the effective lockdown dates, we
use the mobility reports made available by Google and Apple.
Google released community-level reports [40] indicating the daily
percentage change in visits to predefined categories of places:
Retail and Recreation aggregates places like restaurants, cafés,
shopping centers, Grocery and Pharmacy, Parks, Transit Stations

Changepoint detection. Changepoint detection, is the task of
identifying state changes in time-series. We can benefit from the
large literature on offline changepoint detection to identify the
effective time of lockdown based on changes in mobility timeseries.

for public transport hubs, Workplaces, and Residential which
estimates stay-at-home changes. The changes, for a given place
on a given day, are reported in comparison to a baseline value,
i.e., the median volume for the same day of the week computed
across a 5-week period between January 3rd and February 6th .
Similarly, Apple reports relative changes compared to a baseline
volume measured on January 13th along 3 dimensions of mobility:
Driving, Walking, and Transit. Combined, these represent 9 types
of time-series capturing mobility behavior.

These techniques usually rely on two components: (i) a costfunction assessing the quality of a particular signal segmentation
and (ii) a technique to search the space of possible segmentations,
guided by the cost-function [41]. For more details, we refer to the
review of [42]. In this work, we considered the cost-functions and
search algorithms available as part of the ruptures package. 11

Dealing with language / country mismatch. Some languages
like English, French or German cannot easily be matched to one
particular geographical area. For them, we collect the largest
countries in terms of native speakers for which mobility data
was available. We then produce an aggregate of the mobility
data across countries weighted by the percentage of native speakers of the language in each country. For English, we aggregated:

Several different design choices can be made: (i) different
subsets of mobility time-series can be selected and (ii) different
changepoint algorithms can be employed We ran the pipeline with
many different parameters and report the results in Table 2. The
standard deviations are due to changing parameters and are small,
often below 1 day. Indeed, for most countries, the changes in
mobility are very clear, and different methods largely agree.
