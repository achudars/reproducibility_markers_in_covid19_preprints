Abstract The recent COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increasing interest
in the modeling and analysis of infectious diseases. The pandemic has made
a significant impact on the way we behave and interact in our daily life. The
past year has witnessed a strong interplay between human behaviors and
epidemic spreading. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary game-theoretic
framework to study the coupled evolutions of herd behaviors and epidemics. Our
framework extends the classical degree-based mean-field epidemic model over
complex networks by coupling it with the evolutionary game dynamics. The
statistically equivalent individuals in a population choose their social activity
intensities based on the fitness or the payoffs that depend on the state of the
epidemics. Meanwhile, the spreading of the infectious disease over the complex
network is reciprocally influenced by the players’ social activities. We analyze
the coupled dynamics by studying the stationary properties of the epidemic
for a given herd behavior and the structural properties of the game for a given
epidemic process. The decisions of the herd turn out to be strategic substitutes.
We formulate an equivalent finite-player game and an equivalent network to
represent the interactions among the finite populations. We develop structurepreserving approximation techniques to study time-dependent properties of
the joint evolution of the behavioral and epidemic dynamics. The resemblance
between the simulated coupled dynamics and the real COVID-19 statistics in
the numerical experiments indicates the predictive power of our framework.

1 Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has unprecedentedly impacted our society in many
ways. Companies, schools, and the government have shut down their offices.
Many people work at home, shop online, and communicate over zoom. The
past year has witnessed a litany of policies regarding social distancing, maskwearing, and vaccination to prevent and mitigate the spreading of the pandemic.
The pandemic has made a significant impact on the way we behave and
interact in our daily life. We have observed a strong interplay between people’s
behaviors and the pandemic. When the pandemic transforms the pattern of
social interactions, the human behaviors also change how the infectious disease
spreads. When the number of COVID cases goes down, reopening policies
enable more social activities to return to normal. If not done carefully, they
would create second or third waves of infections, which we have witnessed
recently in many countries.
The behaviors of individuals in the same fashion create a collective behavioral pattern that leads to the behavior of the population, which is also known
as herd behavior. The herd behavior plays an important role in the pandemic.
It is often driven by policies or individual incentives. For example, cities like
New York and London have designed incentives for individuals to be vaccinated
to reach targeted herd immunity. Many countries have enforced the policies of
mask-wearing in public spaces to create herd behavior that reduces the risk of
mass infection.
Existing works on herd behaviors have focused mainly on topics related to
financial markets and economics [1,31]. At the same time, epidemic processes
are often studied as stand-alone dynamical processes without incorporating
individual behaviors into the model [26]. The epidemic models alone from the
literature are insufficient. There is a need for an integrated framework that
gives a holistic understanding of the pandemic together with herd behaviors.
In this paper, we propose a dynamics-coupled evolutionary game-theoretic
framework to model the herd behaviors that are coupled with the spreading of
epidemics. Noncooperative games [2] are natural tools for the study of strategic
decision-making of rational individuals in competitive environments. When
populations instead of a finite number of individuals are of interest, the strategy
profile of the population game captures the herd behavior. The reason lies
in that the macroscopic herd behaviors of the populations result from the
microscopic strategic choices of individuals without central coordination.
Evolutionary games study the strategic behaviors of the populations in which
one population can mutate and choose a strategy against another population
to maximize its fitness. The evolutionary game dynamics are population-level
or mean-field dynamics that describe the evolution or the adaptive revision of
the strategies when the populations interact with each other. The outcome of
the evolutionary game and its associated dynamics is defined by the concept
of evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS), which refines the concept of Nash
equilibrium. The evolutionary dynamics provide a straightforward way to
describe the macroscopic strategic interactions among the populations and

the evolution of the herd behavior in response to the underlying changing
environments, including the information received by the population and the
fitness of the population affected by the epidemics.
One critical component of our evolutionary game framework is the modeling
of the infectious disease. In this work, we consider a class of mean-field epidemic
models over complex networks to capture the social interactions among the
individuals [26,27,10, 25]. The individuals over the network are assumed to
be statistical equivalent within the same class of population. The mean-field
dynamics forthrightly describe the influences of the herd behavior on the
spreading of the epidemic. We use a complex network model that is characterized
by a degree distribution to represent the social interactions of the populations.
Each individual in the network is associated with a degree or the number of
connections that determines the probability of infection and thus the spreading
of the disease.
The epidemic model is consolidated into the evolutionary game framework
as illustrated in Fig. 1. The spreading of the epidemic among the populations is
affected by the social activity intensities of the individuals. As the information
and the policies concerning the epidemic being communicated to the population
through public media, individuals can respond to them and adapt their social
activities, constituting herd behavior at the population level. It is clear from Fig.
1 that the state of the epidemics and the herd behaviors are interdependent.
The integrated framework in Fig. 1 can be mathematically described by
a system of coupled differential equations. One set of differential equations
represents the mean-field evolutionary dynamics of the game strategies. The
other set of differential equations describes the epidemic process. It is critical to
exam the structural properties of the coupled dynamics, including the stability
and the steady state. To this end, we first discuss the stability of the epidemic
dynamics under fixed herd behavior and then analyze the structural properties

4

Shutian Liu et al.

of the evolutionary game under the steady states. We find out that, under
certain conditions, there is a unique nontrivial globally asymptotically stable
steady state given the herd behaviors. The players’ decisions in the game
turn out to be strategic substitutes. This property makes the ESS or the
Nash equilibria achievable even when the individuals revise their strategies
myopically on their own. This structural property is shown to hold even when
the epidemic is not at its steady state.
We formulate a unified optimization problem to compute the Nash equilibrium based on an equivalent representation of the population game as a
finite-player game problem, where each population is viewed as a player. Furthermore, we develop two structure-preserving approximation techniques to
analyze the time-dependent evolution of the herd behaviors and the epidemics.
We show that both schemes preserve the strategic substitutes property of the
game.
The proposed dynamics-coupled evolutionary game provides a suitable
framework to study the impact of misinformation on epidemics. We use numerical experiments to compare the simulated infection curve with the COVID-19
statistics of the infected in New York City. The prediction of two peaks in the
pandemic over a time interval of interest provides a promising analytical and
policy design tool for the pandemic.
The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 discusses related works.
We introduce the general framework in Section 3. In Section 4, we present
analytical results for the case where the epidemic evolves at a faster time scale.
We characterize the steady-state behavior of the epidemic, investigate the Nash
equilibrium and structural properties of the game, and study the impact of
misinformation. In Section 5, we extend the structural properties to different
time scales and develop approximation schemes to study time-dependent behaviors. Section 6 presents the numerical experiments. We conclude the paper
in Section 7.

2 Related Work
The mean-field approach has been a standard tool to study the spreading
of epidemics over complex networks [26,27,10]. The key components in this
approach are the infection probabilities of the nodes, which bridge the degree
distribution of the nodes with the contagion events. This model has been
used to model spreading over networks for a diverse range of applications. For
example, in [15], the authors have investigated multi-strain epidemic dynamics
over complex networks to study the control policies when a single pathogen
creates many strains of infections of different features. Another recent endeavor
is [7], where the authors have focused on the optimal quarantining policies when
multiple diseases coexist and have observed a switching phenomenon between
equilibria. Our framework extends the statistical equivalence assumptions of
the standard degree-based mean-field approach. The players in our framework
are distinguished by their degrees of connections and the strategies they choose.

The proposed coupled system of differential equations describes the flow of
contagion when individuals adopt different social activity intensities.
The connection of game theory and epidemic models has been successfully
established in the celebrated work [3]. The authors have characterized the
vaccination decisions in populations using the concept of convergently-stable
Nash equilibrium. The vaccination game [3] has then been used to guide policies
on social distancing [14] and analyze imitative behaviors in vaccination [12].
We are motivated by the problem settings of [3] and consider a heterogeneous
population over complex networks, whose connectivity is characterized by
the degree distributions of individuals. We use specific dynamic processes
to model the evolution of the herd behaviors, enabling observations on the
time-dependent properties of herd behaviors.

3 Problem setting
In this section, we describe our dynamics-coupled evolutionary game framework
in detail. We first introduce the general framework and then turn to the setting
under epidemic.

3.1 The general framework
Consider N ∈ N+ players (nodes) over a network. Each player belongs to
a subset in the set D := {1, 2, ..., D} representing its degree of connectivity,
i.e., a player in d ∈ D has degree d. Let N d ∈ N+ denote the number of
players who has degree d. We have N = N 1 + N 2 + · · · + N D . The degree
distribution is then denoted by [md ]d∈D := (m1 , m2 , ..., mD ) ∈ [0, 1]D , where
d
md = NN , ∀d ∈ D. Let Ξ be the finite state space of all the players and
d
S d := {sd1 , sd2 , ..., sdnd } ⊂ [0, 1]n be the finite strategy space of players with
degree d, with |Ξ| = L and |S d | = nd , respectively. Let I d := {1, 2, ..., nd }
denote the index set of the strategies in S d , ∀d ∈ D. The strategy indexed by
i ∈ I d is sdi ∈ S d . We assume throughout this paper that the strategies in each
set S d , ∀d ∈ D, are listed in an increasing
i, j ∈ I d such that
Q order,d i.e., for any P
d
d
i > j, we have that si > sj . Let S := d∈D S with |S| = d∈D nd = n. Let
wξd (t) denote the fraction of players with degree d who are in state ξ at time t.
Let xdi (t) denote the fraction of players with degree d playing strategy sdi at time
1
D
t. We use w(t) = (w1 (t), ..., wD (t)) ∈ W ⊂ RDL
+ and x(t) = (x (t), ..., x (t)) ∈
Q
n1 ×···×nD
d
d
X = d∈D X ⊂ R+
to denote the concatenations of wξ (t) and xdi (t),
respectively. Note that we refer to x(t) as the herd behavior at time t.
Suppose that players are constantly interacting physically over the network.
By physical interactions, we refer to the face-to-face social interactions which
can cause potential changes in players’ states. Interacting in online chat rooms
is an example of social interaction which is not a physical interaction, since
chatting online will not cause contagion. We use the degree-based mean-field

6

approach [10, 26] to capture the coupled dynamical systems on the large network.
The players are assumed to be statistically equivalent if they have the same
degree and the same strategy. In other words, in the large population, the
players are distinguishable only based on their degree and their strategy.
Let Qdξ : W × X × [0, 1]D → R be a Lipschitz function describing the
dynamical evolution of the fraction of players with degree d who are in state ξ.
The coupled dynamics of players’ state transitions are as follows:

ẇξd (t) = Qdξ w(t), x(t), [md ]d∈D , ∀d ∈ D, ∀ξ ∈ Ξ.
(1)
Note that in (1), the dependence on w(t) emphasizes the coupling of players’
state transitions, and the dependence on [md ]d∈D illustrates the effect of the
network. We use w̄(x) to denote the steady-state value of w(x). The game
mechanism shown in Fig. 1 coordinates the information acquisition of the
players. As the state evolves, public media broadcasts information relevant to
the states w and the strategy profile x to all the players at times. We assume that
the times between information broadcasts are independent, and they follow a
rate τ exponential distribution. Each information broadcast triggers a strategic
interaction where the players update their strategies based on the current
d
information received. For all i, j ∈ I d , let Rij
(w(t), x(t)) : W × X → [0, 1]
denote the probability of a player with degree d switching from strategy sdi ∈ S d
to strategy sdj ∈ S d . The evolution of the fraction of players with degree d
playing strategy sdi in the strategic interactions can be described as follows.
Consider a small time period dt. There will be τ dt expected information
broadcasts during this period. The change of the number of players with degree
d playing strategy sdi can be expressed as:


X

N
xdj (t)Rji
(w(t), x(t)) −
xdi (t)Rij
(w(t), x(t)) τ dt.
(2)
j∈I d

j∈I d

By considering fractions of players in (2), we obtain the mean dynamic as
follows:

(w(t), x(t))
ẋi (t) =

(w(t), x(t)), ∀i ∈ I d , ∀d ∈ D.
j∈I d

Equations (1) and (3) constitute a system of coupled differential equations
describing the joint evolution of states and strategies. This coupled system is
depicted in Fig. 2.
Since the coupled evolutions in (1) and (3) involve the subpopulations of the
players instead of individual players, we naturally interpret the above setting
as the interactions among populations when the total number of players goes
to infinity, i.e., N → ∞. In the sequel, we refer to the players with degree
d ∈ D as population d.

For all i ∈ I d , let Fid : W × X → R denote the payoff function of a player
with degree d who plays strategy sdi ∈ S d . In general, Fid depends on w(t) and
x(t). The dependence on x(t) characterizes the game-theoretic aspect of the
framework. The dependence on w(t) reveals the coupling of all players’ state

evolutions. We use F = (F 1 , ..., F D ) ∈ Rn ×···×n to denote the concatenation.
Connecting with the standard definition of evolutionary games [30], we refer
to the a herd behavior x as a social state and call, with a slight abuse of ter1

We refer to the game defined by the payoff function F , the evolutionary dynamics (3), and the coupled state dynamics (1) as a dynamics-coupled evolutionary
game.
Definition 1 Let N E(F ) denote the set of NE of the game defined by the
payoff F and the coupled state transitions (1). A social state x ∈ X is a Nash
Equilibrium (NE), i.e., x ∈ N E(F ), if for all d ∈ D, xd ∈ md BRd (x), where
d
the set BRd (·) denotes the set of best responses, i.e., BRd (x) := {z ∈ Rn+ :
T
d
d
1 z = 1, zi > 0, if si ∈ arg maxj∈I d Fj (x, w̄(x))}.
The difference between Definition 1 and the standard NE is that x is the best
response to the payoffs generated by x together with the steady-state value of
(1) given x. This integrates the coupling of (1) and (3) into the definition of
NE of our framework.
The terms social state and herd behavior will be used interchangeably when
we refer to x.
3.2 The framework under epidemics
Consider the states of the players described by the Susceptible-Infected (SI)
compartmental model over a degree-based network [27] with degree distribution

8

Shutian Liu et al.

[md ]d∈D . We use Iid (t) to denote the fraction of the infected players in population
d adopting strategy sdi ∈ S d at time t, ∀i ∈ I d , ∀d ∈ D.
The strategies sd1 , sd2 , ..., sdnd ∈ [0, 1], d ∈ D, are in the action sets of an
individual with degree d. A strategy sdi can be interpreted as the choice of
social inactivity intensity level i of an individual of degree d. The social inactivity
intensity is quantized into nd levels for an individual to choose from. Naturally,
the chosen social activity intensity (SAI) level is given by 1−sdi , ∀i ∈ I d , ∀d ∈ D,
which can be viewed as the probability of a player behaving actively in the faceto-face physical interactions through all of her connections with other players.
A strategy sdi , i ∈ I d , d ∈ D, close to 1 means that the player is considerably
mindful when interacting socially through her connections with others. Apart
from social activity intensities, the strategies of players can also be interpreted
as the willingness to wear masks or the probability to vaccinate. Note that in
the context of epidemics, the herd behavior describes the collective patterns in
the populations’ social activity intensities.
Given a herd behavior x ∈ X , the evolution of Iid (t) is also affected by a
recovery rate γ ∈ R+ and a contagion rate λ ∈ R+ . The dynamical system,
analogous to (1), describing the time evolution of Iid (t) is

I˙id (t) = −γIid (t) + λdi 1 − Iid (t) dΘ(t),
(4)
where λdi = λ(1 − sdi ) ∈ R+ denotes the activity-aware contagion rate of a
player with degree d and SAI 1 − sdi . The second term on the right-hand side
of (4) corresponds to the growth of Iid (t). This growth is proportional to the
activity-aware contagion rate λdi , the density of susceptible players 1 − Iid (t),
the degree of connections d, and the probability Θ(t) ∈ [0, 1] that a link is
connected to an infected player. This probability can be expressed as follows:

P
P
d d
d∈D
i∈I d dxi Ii (t)
P
.
(5)
Θ(t) =
d
d∈D dm
Since we have assumed the statistical equivalence of players with the same
degree and the same strategy, the numerator of the right-hand-side of (5)
consists of the sum of the probabilities that a link is connected to an infected
player within each equivalence class. The probability of a link connecting
to an infected player with degree d choosing strategy sdi is proportional to
dxdi Iid (t). Hence, we obtain (5). The consistency of (4) and (5) follows from a
similar reasoning as discussed in [27], since the effect of SAI has already been
considered in the activity-aware contagion rate λdi .
Note that (5) couples the dynamics in (4) corresponding to each strategy
of each population. The concatenation of all n fractions of infected is I(t) =
1
D
(I 1 (t), ..., I D (t)) ∈ [0, 1]n ×···×n . We use I¯id and Θ̄ to denote the steady-state
d
quantities of Ii (t) and Θ(t). The concatenations are I¯ and I¯d .
Players with degree d who choose strategy sdi ∈ S d , i ∈ I d , d ∈ D has payoff
d
Fi , which depends on the information broadcast at the time of sampling, i.e.,
Iid (t), as defined in Section 3.1. In the context of the epidemic, it takes the
following form:
d,i
Fid = sdi Uina + (1 − sdi )Uact
,
(6)

Title Suppressed Due to Excessive Length

d,i
where Uact
: [0, 1] → R+ and Uina ∈ R. In (6), sdi Uina represents the expected
d,i
utility of being socially inactive; (1 − sdi )Uact
represents the expected utility of
being socially active.
d,i
The function Uact
, ∀i ∈ I d , ∀d ∈ D corresponds to the reward from getting
d,i
infected through physical interactions on the network. Therefore, we let Uact
d
be decreasing in ηi ∈ [0, 1], which represents the probability that a player
in population d playing strategy sdi is infected. The probability that a player
is infected can be equivalently understood as the fraction of players within
the same statistical equivalent class who are infected. Thus, we obtain ηid =
Oid (Iid (t)), where Oid : [0, 1] → [0, 1] is a player’s observation of the infected
fraction of players at the time of an information broadcast. Note that the
case of imperfect observations will be discussed in Section 4.5. For now, we
consider the case of perfect observations, i.e., ηid = Iid (t). Since the evolution
(4) is coupled and the term (5) depends on the herd behavior x, the payoff
satisfies the definition in Section 3.1. Note that the rate parameter τ determines
the time-scale of the coupled system of differential equations. The sampled
epidemic status is at a steady state if τ1 → ∞ and is time-dependent otherwise.
d,i
In this paper, we consider Uact
= −ract ηid for all players with reward
parameter ract ∈ R+ , for simplicity reasons. The term Uina corresponds to
isolating oneself from others. Hence, we assume that Uina is a negative constant
reward for all players, i.e., Uina = rina ∈ R− .
∈ R− to be the relative reward of being socially inactive
By defining r = rrina
act
against being socially active, we obtain the payoff function suitable under (4)
as follows:
Fid = sdi r − (1 − sdi )ηid .
(7)

Note that we have dropped the dependence of Fid and ηid on the epidemic state
I when we analyze equilibrium behaviors, since the epidemic state is a function
that only depends on the social state x, as can be observed in Definition 1.

4 Long-term behavior
In this section, we study the long-term behavior of our model under the
assumption that τ1 → ∞. The epidemic dynamics (4) are assumed to reach
the steady state more quickly than the herd behaviors. When an information
broadcast changes the behavior, the epidemic dynamics would respond to it
quickly and reach a steady-state before the next information broadcast arrives.

steady state, players are uninfected no matter which statistical equivalent class

pair is often referred to as the disease-free state [7]. Meanwhile, there exist
positive steady states, which arise from dividing Θ̄ from both sides of (10)

from the epidemic only if she lives a totally isolated life. Note that the positive

result presents the conditions on the stability of the zero steady-state pair and
the positive steady-state pair.

This implies that the objective function is nonnegative,
i.e., d∈D −EF d (x) + d∈D y d md ≥ 0.
Suppose that x∗ = (x1∗ , ..., xD∗ ) is an NE of the population game. Define

we obtain
−y d∗ 1nd = −(md )−1 (xd∗ )T F d (xd∗ , x−d∗ )1nd .

Gradient-based algorithms can be used to numerically solve the optimization

of the gradient vectors ∂xi (x) for all i ∈ I d and for all d ∈ D. We provide
below the explicit expression of the gradient vector given a social state.

there exists a neighborhood VΘ of Θ∗ and a neighborhood Vx of x∗ , such that
there is a unique continuously differentiable function h : Vx → VΘ satisfying
h(x∗ ) = Θ∗ and H(h(x∗ ), x∗ ) = 0. Furthermore, the derivative of h(·) can be

In general, the optimization problem (12) is nonconvex. However, gradientbased algorithms are still applicable to find stationary points, i.e., points with
sufficiently small gradients. Moreover, we know from the proof of Theorem 3
that the global optimal point yields a zero objective value. Therefore, we can
test the stationary point obtained using gradient-based algorithms and using
the objective value to determine whether it is a potential global optimal point,
i.e., an NE social state.

4.4 Long-term property of the game

plays following specific revision protocols converge to an NE. In this section, we
analyze players’ incentives to change their strategies when the game is played

In some classes of games, such as potential games and stable games, various evolutionary dynamics show global stability. These games require special
structures of the derivative matrix DF (x). Next, we investigate the structural
properties of (19).

t

A straightforward explanation of the above result is that the decisions in
our evolutionary game are strategic substitutes; i.e., when a player with degree
d ∈ D changes her strategy from sdi to sdj such that sdi < sdj , ∀i, j ∈ I d , other
players, say players with degree d0 , are more likely to choose a strategy closer
0
0
to sd0 from the set S d , and vice versa. This fact is also supported by the
observations of the human behaviors under an epidemic. People tend to stay
at home when the streets become crowded. There is a higher probability to get
infected with a higher social interactivity. On the contrary, people tend to be
outdoors if the others choose to stay at home.
The counterpart to a submodular game is a supermodular game [30], where
decisions of players are strategic complements. In supermodular games, increases
in strategies of other players result in a relatively higher strategy of a given
player. This isotone property of the payoff function makes the best response
correspondences of players well-behaved and the best-response dynamics with
stochastic perturbation converge to perturbed NE of the game [30]. The
behavior of learning dynamics in submodular games is more involved [20].
However, following [38] and [9], we obtain guarantees on the stability of certain
learning processes.
Consider the best-response dynamics of the form
xd[k+1] = min{md BRd (x[k] )},

∀d ∈ D,

(21)

where the subscript [k] represents iteration k and min{·} stands for choosing the
least component. Let xdmin = (md , 0, ..., 0)T and xdmax = (0, ..., 0, md )T denote
the minimal and maximal state of population d. Let xmin = (x1min , ..., xD
min )
and xmax = (x1max , ..., xD
)
denote
the
minimal
and
maximal
social
state.
The
max
following result [38] characterizes the stability of the learning process (21).

18

Shutian Liu et al.

Corollary 1 There exists a minimal point x∗min ∈ N E(F ) and a maximal point
x∗max ∈ N E(F ). The best-response dynamics (21) generate a monotonically
increasing sequence which converges to x∗min when the initial point is xmin ; (21)
generates a monotonically decreasing sequence which converges to x∗max when
the initial point is xmax .
The results in Corollary 1 have the following interpretations. The initialization at xmin corresponds to the situation where players pay little attention to
potential infections caused by the epidemic. In this scenario, players are at high
SAIs and interact actively over the network. Through sequential revisions of
strategies, players gradually become aware of the potential risks from physical
interactions and they become increasingly careful about their physical interactions with others. Hence, the sequence generated by (21) starting from xmin
is increasing. The convergence to x∗min shows that by naively best-responding
to current payoffs, the population can eventually reach a point where no one
has an incentive to further revise her strategies. On the contrary, the scenario
where the starting point is xmax indicates cautious plays at the beginning, since
players have no information about the potential consequences of the epidemic.
Through sequential plays, players know more about the epidemic and they
become more audacious, i.e., the subsequent social states generated by (21)
after xmax are decreasing. And finally, there is a point where no one is willing
to take more risks (e.g., going to the supermarket without wearing a mask).
Note that the maximal and the minimal points x∗max and x∗min do not, in
general, correspond to the equilibrium points where the payoffs of players
reach the maximum and the minimum, respectively [9]. Corollary 1 enables
the monotone convergence to NE of the evolutionary dynamics of the form:

ẋd = min{md BRd (x)} − xd ,

∀d ∈ D,

(22)

where min{·} selects the least element from a set. The reason lies in the
discretization of (22): xd (t + δ) = δ min{md BRd (x(t))} + (1 − δ)xd (t), which
has the interpretation that in a small period δ, only δ portion of the population
revises their strategies to the one obtained using the best-responses. The updates
(21) correspond to δ = 1. Suppose that tk and tk+1 are two time instances
corresponding to iteration [k] and [k + 1] in (21). Since starting from xmin , (21)
yields xd[k] ≤ xd[k+1] , and for any δ ∈ (0, 1), xd (tk +δ) = δ min{md BRd (x(tk ))}+
(1 − δ)xd (tk ) = δxd[k+1] + (1 − δ)xd[k] . Then, xd[k] ≤ xd (tk + δ) ≤ xd[k+1] . If we
pick δ, δ1 , · · · , δend ∈ [0, 1] such that 0 < δ1 < δ2 < · · · < δend < 1, the same
relation follows: xd[k] ≤ xd (tk + δ1 ) ≤ · · · ≤ xd (tk + δend ) ≤ xd[k+1] . Therefore,
the discretization of (22) is monotone between tk and tk+1 for arbitrary choices
of an increasing sequence of δ. This shows the monotonicity of (22) and its
convergence to the NE from xmin , when we let δ → 0. The scenario where the
starting point is xmax follows the similar reasoning.

4.5 Misinformation broadcasting
Information plays an important role in shaping human behaviors. In the
information broadcast, the media can control the strategies of players through
the design of the information. In this subsection, we investigate manipulations
on players’ observations of the status of the epidemic. For simplicity reasons,
we assume that the information broadcast only contains Θ̄, which represents
the average probability that a link on the network connects to an infected
node, at a given social state. This assumption can be understood as the total
infected number of people reported by the news. In addition, we assume that
the strategy sets S d are identical for all d ∈ D with the minimal element
denoted by smin and the maximal element denoted by smax .
Define F d (s) : [smin , smax ] → R by F d (s) = sr − (1 − s)ηid = sr − (1 −
s)Oid (I¯id ) for all d ∈ D. The function F d (s) extends the payoff of players with
degree d ∈ D to a continuous function defined on the continuum [smin , smax ].
This extension helps analyze the properties of the payoff when the strategies
are perturbed.
Combining (7) and (8), we obtain
F d (s) = sr − (1 − s)

Proof From (23), we know that the minimal value of the second term on the

right-hand side is 0 when Θ̄ = 0. In this case, ds
F d (s) ≤ 0 since r is negative.
d
Therefore, dominant strategies for all players can only appear if ds
F d (s) ≤ 0
when the second term on the right-hand side of (23) takes the maximal value.
Hence, by requiring (23) to be negative when Θ̄ = 1, we arrive at (24).
t
u

20

Shutian Liu et al.

According to the above result, when the relative reward r satisfies (24), a player
chooses smin no matter what she observes from the information broadcast. We
regard the relative reward satisfying the equality in (24) as the critical relative
reward and denote it by rcrit . Condition (24) is relatively demanding, since
it requires the reward perceptions of all players in the populations to go to
one extreme, i.e., the reward of socially inactive is low whatever the status of
the epidemic is. However, with smin being a potential dominant strategy, the
information broadcaster can make the condition on r for enabling dominant
strategies less restrictive by taking advantage of Θ̄. Specifically, by misreporting
Θ̄ with a value Θ̃ satisfying 0 ≤ Θ̃ < Θ̄ in every information broadcast, the
information broadcaster makes smin dominant for all players even if |r| < |rcrit |.
This shows the destructive impact of misinformation. Indeed, even when a
player possesses a reward perception that social inactivity during the epidemic
is acceptable, if the media consecutively underreport the epidemic, this player
would underestimate possible consequences of infection and become highly
socially active, i.e., playing strategy smin . As a consequence, few infections
cause regional outbreaks of the epidemic, and the epidemic eventually becomes
a pandemic.

5 Time-dependent behavior
In Section 4, we have assumed that the epidemic dynamics evolve at a faster
time scale. In this section, we investigate our framework at a different time scale.
We first present a result analogous to that of Section 4.4 to make connections
with the rate-τ exponential distribution that controls the times between the
information broadcasts. Then, we show that the essence of the framework
is maintained when we consider the approximate time-dependent epidemic
dynamics.

5.1 Time-dependent property of the game
We emphasize the time-dependence of the probability of infection using ηid (∆t),
where ∆t denotes the time between information broadcasts. We rewrite the
payoffs of players as:
Fid = sdi r − (1 − sdi )ηid (∆t).

(25)

The next result is the time-dependent counterpart of Theorem 4.
Theorem 6 Under the assumption that all the players have the same probability to be infected at the beginning, i.e. Iid (0) = i0 , ∀i ∈ I d , ∀d ∈ D, the game
defined in Section 3.2 with payoff functions (25) is a submodular game for any
time ∆t > 0 between information broadcasts.
Proof We first show that Iid (t) are ordered when Iid (0) = i0 , ∀i ∈ I d , ∀d ∈ D.
From (4), we observe that the distinct term is λdi = λ(1 − sdi ). For all i, j ∈ I d

Title Suppressed Due to Excessive Length

21

such that i > j and sdi , sdj ∈ S d , since sdi > sdj , I˙id (t) is an upper bound of I˙jd (t)
for all d ∈ D. At an arbitrary time t > 0, we obtain the expression
Z t
Iid (t) = Iid (0) +
−γIid (t) + λ(1 − sdi )(1 − Iid (t))dΘ(t)dt.
0

Since Iid (0) = i0 , ∀i ∈ I d , ∀d ∈ D, we conclude that Ijd (t) > Iid (t) for all t > 0
and d ∈ D if i > j using arguments in [4]. Note that the social state x only
appears in the expression of Θ(t) and Θ(t) stays the same for all sdi ∈ S d and
d ∈ D. Therefore, the relation Ijd (t) > Iid (t) holds when the social state x
evolves.
Next, we derive the structural properties of the matrix DFcd (x) with the
payoff (25). We focus on the time period [t, t + ∆t]. The evolution of the
epidemic dynamics is
Z t+∆t
d
d
Ii (t + ∆t) = Ii (t) +
−γIid (t) + λ(1 − sdi )(1 − Iid (t))dΘ(t)dt. (26)

The only term that depends on the social state in (26) is Θ(t). Hence, the
derivative of the payoff (25) with respect to the social state is

The matrix DFcd (x) takes (27) as the element on the row corresponding to
strategy sdi ∈ S d of population d and the column corresponding to strategy
scj ∈ S c of population c. Our objective is to show that (Σ d )T DFcd (x)Σ c ≤ 0
for all d, c ∈ D. We arrive at the expression of the element in (Σ d )T DFcd (x)Σ c
on row i column j as follows:
λdc d,c

(29)
Then, it suffices to prove that (29) is nonnegative.
A sufficient condition for (29) to be nonnegative is that the integrand in (29)
is nonnegative on the interval [t, t+∆t]. We have shown that Ijd (t) > Iid (t) when
d
i > j. Hence, it suffices to show that [(1−sdi+1 )2 (1−Ii+1
(t))−(1−sdi )2 (1−Iid (t))]
is negative. By rearranging the differential equation (4), we arrive at
I˙id (t) + γIid (t)
= (1 − sdi )(1 − Iid (t)).

Multiplying 1 − sdi on both sides of (30), we obtain
I˙id (t) + γIid (t)
(1 − sdi ) = (1 − sdi )2 (1 − Iid (t)).
λdΘ(t)

(31)

By (31), it suffices to prove that the left-hand side of (31) is decreasing with
respect to i. We have shown that I˙jd (t) upper bounds I˙id (t) and Ijd (t) > Iid (t)
if i > j. In addition, the strategies in the set S d follow an increasing order.
Therefore, we conclude that the left-hand side of (31) decreases as i increases.
This completes the proof.
t
u
We remark that in the proof of Theorem 6, the time ∆t is arbitrary. This
suggests the possibility of different time intervals between two information
broadcasts. Hence, we can assume that the times between the information
broadcasts are independent and follow a rate τ exponential distribution, which
coincides with the settings described in Section 3.
With Theorem 6, the convergence result in Corollary 1 can be extended to
the setting where the epidemic evolves for an arbitrary time between any two
information broadcasts. Indeed, after the learning procedure defined in (21)
does not result in new social states given additional information broadcasts, the
epidemic will gradually converge to the unique positive steady state associated
with the current social state as t → ∞. This leads to Nash equilibria defined
in Definition 1.

5.2 Equivalent networks and approximations
In general, the time-dependent behaviors depend on the solution of a system
of nonlinear differential equations. Here, we study it using approximations.
Combining (4) and (5), we obtain

where Ã(d,i),(d0 ,i0 ) =

(d, i) representing the row index and (d0 , i0 ) representing the column index. We
use a pair (d, i) to represent an index to emphasize that this index is associated
with population d ∈ D and strategy sdi ∈ S d , i ∈ I d . The matrix Ã acts as an
equivalent adjacency matrix if we regard our epidemic dynamics as a dynamical
system on a small network with n nodes. The entry Ã(d,i),(d0 ,i0 ) stands for
the weight on the link from node (d, i) to node (d0 , i0 ). In general, matrix Ã
is asymmetric, indicating that the equivalent network is directed. Since we

Title Suppressed Due to Excessive Length

23

have interpreted the population game as a D-player game in Section 4.3, the
interactions among the D players can be captured by the small network.
To analyze the time-dependent behavior of the epidemics, we ignore the
quadratic terms in the equivalent dynamics and arrive at:

Combining the two terms and rewriting it in matrix form, we obtain

(33)

where A = Ã − λγ Λ ∈ Rn×n and Λ represents the identity matrix. Let vk and κk
denote the k-th eigenvector and eigenvalue of matrix A. Then, we can express
I(t) as a linear combination of the eigenvectors as
I(t) '

where αk (t) is a time-dependent parameter associated with vk . To solve for
αk (t), we use the following equation:

Hence,

The differential equation (34) has solutions αk (t) = αk (0)eλκk t . Therefore, we
obtain the time-dependent behavior of the epidemic:

The exponential term determines the growth speed of I(t). Hence, the largest
eigenvalue κ1 corresponds to the fastest evolution component.
In general, (35) can be approximated using I(t) ' α1 (0)eλκ1 t v1 by assuming
that the largest eigenvalue is significantly greater than the second largest
eigenvalue. In our case, we can leverage the structural properties of matrix Ã
to justify the approximation given by
I(t) ' α1 (0)eλκ1 t v1 .
From the definition of Ã(d,i),(d0 ,i0 ) , we obtain

This shows that matrix

eigenvalue κ̃1 = d¯−1 d∈D i∈I d d2 (1 − sdi )xdi of order 1 associated with the

we arrive at κ1 = κ̃1 − λγ associated with v1 = ṽ1 , and κk = − λγ associated
λd(1−sd )

with vk = ṽk if k 6= 1. Consider the conditions

γ
which we have assume

P in Theorem
P
we obtain κ̃1 ≥ d1¯ λγ d∈D i∈I d dxdi = λγ . Hence, κ1 ≥ 0. This shows that the

λd(1−sd )

i
largest eigenvalue is nonnegative when
≥ 1. In addition, we know that
γ
γ
κk = − λ < 0 for all k 6= 1. Therefore, the initial values αk (0) in (35) decays
exponentially in time if k 6= 1. This justifies the approximation (36).
Some of the properties of our framework introduced in the previous sections
depends on the submodularity of the game. The approximation (36) does not
break this structural feature. Consider the derivative of the payoff under the
approximation (36):

∂ d
F (x, t) = −α1 (0)λteλκ1 t d(1 − sdi )2 c2 (1 − scj ).
∂xcj i

(37)

In (37), both d(1 − z)2 and c2 (1 − z) are decreasing functions in z on z ∈ [0, 1].
Hence, we can show that the inequality (Σ d )T DFcd (x)Σ c ≤ 0 holds when
DFcd (x) is based on (37). Therefore, after the approximation, players’ decisions
remain strategic substitutes.
5.3 Carleman linearization
In the above analysis based on approximation, we have ignored the influence
of the quadratic term. We now introduce another technique, called Carleman
linearization [33]. This approximation method considers an iterative procedure
which linearizes a nonlinear system with increasing accuracy as the iterations
proceed. We provide the explicit linearization construction procedure.
We first reformulate (32) as

where ∆ = A − ωΛn , ∆[2] = A[2] − ωΛn2 and so on. The inverse of the matrix
on the left-hand side of (41) has a closed form according to [33]. Hence, we can
find ρ, ρ[2] , ..., ρ[C] and take the inverse Laplace transform to find I, I[2] , ..., I[C] .
The accuracy of the linearization depends on the value of C. For numerical
computations, the approximation is stopped at a sufficiently large C under
which the Carleman linearization is sufficiently accurate.
The Carleman approximation (40) is more accurate than the approximation
(33) for estimating the time-dependent growth of the original nonlinear system
(4). The explicit forms of the matrices A, ..., A[C] and B, ..., B[C−1] in (40) make
it convenient to implement the iterative Carleman linearization procedures.
After determining the order C, the Carleman linearization neglect high-order
terms with the subscripts higher than [C], which introduce errors to the
computation of I through the extended states I[2] , ..., I[C] of the system (40).
However, according to [16], we can compensate this drawback by periodically
resetting extended states and recomputing them from the original state I. In

26

Shutian Liu et al.

these resettings, there is no need to recompute the matrices A, ..., A[C] and
B, ..., B[C−1] .
As pointed out in [16,11], the equations of the sensitivity analysis of the
states leads to the same forms in both linear and nonlinear systems approximated by the Carleman linearization. This suggests the possibility that the
gradients of the payoffs (25) under (40) share the same analytical properties
as (33). Specifically, we observe that the matrix A[C] is constructed using
a Kronecker sum [19], whose eigenvalues are the sums of the eigenvalues of
its components. The components A ⊗ ΛnC−1 and Λn ⊗ A[C−1] are themselves
Kronecker products, whose eigenvalues are products of eigenvalues of their
factors. Hence, the eigenvalues of A[C] are the eigenvalues of A multiplied by
the scalar C. Therefore, by applying similar techniques as discussed in Section
5.2 to (40), we obtain

where κ1,[C] and v1,[C] represent the largest eigenvalue and the corresponding
eigenvector of the system matrix of (40), and α1,[C] (0) is the initial value
d
of the time-dependent parameter, analogous to (34), satisfying dt
α1,[C] (t) =
λκ1,[C] α1,[C] (t). The time-dependent behavior of I is obtained from (42) by
selecting the related terms. Leveraging these terms, we observe, by following
similar arguments as those for (37), that players’ decisions remain strategic
substitutes for time-dependent epidemic behaviors under the Carleman linearization in our game framework. In addition, (40) provides a way to estimate
herd behaviors involved in A, ..., A[C] using empirical epidemic data I, · · · , I[C]
at different time instances.

6 Numerical experiments
In this section, we present the results of numerical experiments. For presentation
purposes, we set the number of populations D to be 2, with numbers of strategies
n1 and n2 being 3 and 2, respectively.

6.1 Convergence results
In Fig.3, the best-response dynamics (21) and the iterations of the optimization
problem (12) converge to the same NE. According to the evolution of the
social state, the best-response dynamics provide a smoother learning process
where populations gradually learn the equilibrium strategies through sequential
strategic interactions. This is due to the monotonicity of the updates of the

social states in (21) under the submodular property of the game. The learning
process provided by the optimization problem (12) is not as well-shaped as the
one given by the best-response dynamics. However, the optimization problem
provides a different learning approach containing a global objective for all
players, differing from merely considering individual player’s myopic reactions
toward the payoff realizations. We interpret the optimization of the problem
(12) as an objective-guided evolutionary process describing strategy revisions
in the population, with the explicit gradients (17) acting as the incentives of
the players in revising their strategies.
In Fig.4, we compare the convergence of the best-response dynamics when
information broadcasts take place at the steady states of the epidemic dynamics
and when information broadcasts take place before the epidemic dynamics
reach the steady states. Interestingly, in Fig.4(a) and Fig.4(b), the evolution
of the social state converges to the same NE, despite the different evolution

28

patterns at the beginning. Apart from the different time scales used in Fig.4(a)
and Fig.4(b), we have approximated the epidemic evolution using only the
linear terms of (4) in Fig.4(b). This result corroborates the approximation
methods we have discussed in Section 5.2.

(a)

(b)

Fig. 5 Effect of delaying the information broadcasts. (a) Information broadcasts take
place before the epidemic dynamics reach the steady states. (b) Delaying the information
broadcasts.

In Fig. 5, we compare the learning processes with and without delays in
the information broadcasts. As shown in Fig. 5, the delays in the information
broadcasts significantly influence the evolution of the behaviors. The curve
corresponding to d = 1 and s12 is smoother in Fig. 5(a) than in Fig. 5(b).
However, both the processes in Fig. 5(a) and in Fig. 5(b) converge to the same
equilibrium point. Delays in information broadcasts often arise from either the
delays in data collection and processing or purposeful deferral of the broadcast.
The results suggest that even if the broadcaster has difficulty in obtaining the
epidemic status in real time, the out-of-date information can still lead the herd
to reach equilibria, as long as the reported information is chronological and
precise. Therefore, our framework has the potential to guide real-world policy
developing, since neither information reporting nor behavioral revision of the
herd is perfectly on time.
6.2 Infection waves due to strategy changes
In Fig. 6, we compare the curve of the reported cases using the real COVID-19
data and the simulated curve of the infected density using our framework. The
multi-peak curves in Fig. 6(a) and Fig. 6(b) correspond to different waves of
epidemic outbreak. The first wave is the natural outbreak of an epidemic when
it first starts to spread among infectious individuals. The decreases of new
cases between July 2020 and November 2020 in Fig. 6(a) and between time 20
to 50 in Fig. 6(b) correspond to the period when people start to avoid close
contacts and the policies are enforced to mitigate the epidemic, such as wearing

masks all the time. In Fig. 6(a), the second infection wave is a consequence of
relaxed social guidance [29] and the violations of existing quarantine policies.
The behaviors of the populations are set to change at t = 50 in Fig. 6(b). This
change captures the populations’ overconfidence on the epidemic status as the
number of new cases decreases. When the populations become less careful, i.e.,
more people play strategies close to sd1 in the set S d , the new infected density
curve increases and shows a second peak. This second peak is an indication of
the influence of the herd behaviors on the epidemic evolution.

6.3 Equivalent networks
Fig. 7 illustrates the equivalent small networks discussed in Section 5.2. From the
randomized initial network in Fig. 7(a), we eventually arrive at the equilibrium
network in Fig. 7(b), which has a special structure, where a few nodes are
in the center with others being peripheral nodes. This pattern is often called
a core-peripheral structure [13]. In Fig. 7(b), the nodes s13 and s22 act as the

cores, since all the other nodes have a link pointing towards them but they
only have links pointing toward each other. Core-peripheral networks are
consequences of network formation games where the directed links represent
resource flows [13]. This observation suggests that the evolution of populations’
strategies can be statistically equivalent to an N -person sequential network
formation game. Each player represents a population in which the individuals
are indistinguishable and choose the same strategy.

7 Conclusion
In this paper, we have proposed an evolutionary game framework that couples
the state dynamics of the epidemics with the evolution of strategies to study
the herd behaviors of the population over complex networks. We have designed
the mechanism containing physical interactions and information broadcasts
to combine coupled state transitions over a complex network and sequential
strategy revisions in the populations. Taking the epidemic model as a special
case, we have found a unique nontrivial steady state when the evolution of the
epidemic evolves at a faster time scale.
We have characterized the Nash equilibrium of the game at the steadystate and have explicitly expressed its gradient that facilitates numerical
computations and the analysis of structural properties of the game. In addition,
we have shown that decisions in the game are strategic substitutes under
arbitrary time scales. This observation has enabled simple learning processes
to reach the equilibrium point. We have constructed an equivalent small
network to represent the complex network, and proposed structure-preserving
approximation methods that can maintain the strategic substitutes property of
the game. Having applied our framework to study the impact of misinformation
on epidemics, we have shown that misreports lead to a high social activity
intensity, which can exacerbate the spreading of the infection disease.
Our numerical examples have indicated the predictive power of our framework by comparing the simulated dynamics to the real COVID-19 statistics.

Title Suppressed Due to Excessive Length

The multi-peak pattern observed in the case study has shown that the herd
behaviors have attributed to multiple outbreaks of an epidemic. In addition,
the numerical experiments on the delays in the information broadcasts suggest
an extension of our framework to scenarios where the populations react to the
underlying dynamics with a delay. We would extend our framework to study
generalized compartmental models and the role of information structure in the
human behaviors in an epidemic.
