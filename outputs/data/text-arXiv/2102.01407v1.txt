Abstract
This paper introduces new methods to study the changing dynamics of COVID19 cases and deaths among the 50 worst-affected countries throughout 2020.
First, we analyse the trajectories and turning points of rolling mortality rates
to understand at which times the disease was most lethal. We demonstrate
five characteristic classes of mortality rate trajectories and determine structural
similarity in mortality trends over time. Next, we introduce a class of virulence
matrices to study the evolution of COVID-19 cases and deaths on a global scale.
Finally, we introduce three-way inconsistency analysis to determine anomalous
countries with respect to three attributes: countries’ COVID-19 cases, deaths
and human development indices. We demonstrate the most anomalous countries
across these three measures are Pakistan, the United States and the United Arab
Emirates.

1. Introduction
2020 will be remembered as the year that the world first battled the COVID19 pandemic. Almost 2 million people lost their lives, substantial restrictions
on population movement and activities were imposed, and almost every country
experienced an economic recession. During that year, treatments improved
substantially [1, 2, 3, 4] and several vaccines were produced by the end of the
year [5, 6]. However, the disease remains highly prevalent around the world as
of the start of 2021, and measures to contain and reduce its transmission remain
highly relevant for the reduction of casualties as well as economic and other
social consequences [7, 8].
Throughout the year, government responses to the pandemic varied substantially, both over time and between countries. Early government responses
included banning travel [9], the implementation of testing and contact tracing

programs [10], and lockdowns. Due to the economic consequences of lockdowns,
many countries implemented them too late [11, 12] and lifted restrictions before
cases had sufficiently reduced [13]. Such disparate responses to the virus led
to great variability in case and death counts, creating different waves of the
outbreak across many countries. Such later waves often exhibited higher case
and death counts than the first [14, 15].
Close analysis of the dynamics of the disease on a country-by-country basis and
over time is necessary to inform governments of the most successful strategies for
reducing transmission of cases and progression to deaths. Identifying structural
similarities between countries’ trajectories can support conclusions that certain
government responses will likely result in better or worse outcomes. Moreover,
identifying anomalous countries can provide insights on which responses to the
pandemic were exceptionally good or poor.
We implement new and existing time series analysis methods to analyse
COVID-19 prevalence and mortality trends, both on a country-by-country basis
and globally, with the identification of similarity and anomalies as our focus.
Time series analysis has been applied broadly in epidemiology, including to studies
of Ebola [16, 17], the Zika virus [18, 19], and more recently, COVID-19 itself
[20, 21, 22, 23, 24]. Within the nonlinear dynamics community, methods such
as networks [25, 26], distance analysis [15, 27, 28, 29, 30] and power-law models
[23, 20, 31] have been used to model physical phenomena in other contexts.
This paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we analyse the trajectories
of mortality rates on a country-by-country basis. In particular, we build upon a
recently introduced algorithmic framework to identify the turning points of the
mortality trajectories, which reveal when the disease was most and least lethal
(with respect to the progression from cases to deaths). Then, we suitably modify
existing semi-metrics to assign countries into classes of mortality trajectories. In
Section 3, we analyse the eigenspectra of a new class of virulence matrices to
study trends in the worldwide prevalence and mortality of COVID-19. In Section
4, we compare countries’ case and death counts with their human development
index (HDI) and use a new method to identify the most anomalous countries
between these attributes. We believe that this is the first paper to quantitatively
combine these features and identify respective anomalies. In Section 5, we
summarise our findings regarding COVID-19 trends throughout the year 2020.
2. Mortality rate analysis
In this section, we study the dynamics of the COVID-19 mortality rate
among n = 50 countries. Our data spans 01/01/2020 to 31/12/2020, a period of
T = 366 days. We choose the countries with the 50 greatest total case counts of
COVID-19 as of 31/12/2020, order these by alphabetical order, and index them
i = 1, ..., n. Let xi (t), yi (t) ∈ R be the multivariate time series of new daily cases
and deaths, respectively, for i = 1, ..., n and t = 1, ..., T . For a given country, let

ri (t) be its 30-day rolling mortality rate, defined by

, t = 30, ..., T,

(1)

or zero if no cases have been observed over the last 30 days. This gives a
multivariate time series ri (t), for i = 1, ..., n and t = 30, ..., T . The data point at
time t describes the rolling mortality rate over the prior 30 days.
2.1. Methodology
The aim of this section is to study these mortality trends on a country-bycountry basis and identify structural similarity across different countries. For this
purpose, we use two (semi)-metrics between the mortality rate time series and
apply hierarchical clustering [32, 33] to these measures. Hierarchical clustering
has been used in several epidemiological applications, including inflammatory
diseases [34], airborne diseases [35], Alzheimer’s disease [36], Ebola [37], SARS
[38], and COVID-19 [21].
These mortality rates ri (t) exhibit highly undulating behaviour, moving
between clear peaks and troughs (turning points). Our first semi-metric measures
distance between algorithmically-identified turning points as a proxy for each
time series’ behaviour. We modify an existing algorithmic framework for this
purpose. First, we apply a Savitzky-Golay filter to produce a collection of
smoothed time series r̂i (t), t = 30, ..., T and i = 1, ..., n. Next, we follow [15]
and apply a two-step algorithm where we select and then refine a set of turning
points. We assign each smoothed mortality rate time series a non-empty set
Pi and Ti of local maxima (peaks) and local minima (troughs). To better suit
our specific application, we modify the second step of this algorithm, in which
the turning point list is refined. Full details are included in Appendix A. We
display 12 countries’ mortality rate time series and annotate their turning points
in Figure 1.
To quantify distance between time series’ turning points, we modify the semimetric of [39] (with p = 1). Given two non-empty finite sets S1 , S2 ⊂ {1, 2, ..., T },
this is defined as
P
P

1
b∈S2 d(b, S1 )
a∈S1 d(a, S2 )
D(S1 , S2 ) =
+
,
(2)
2T
#S2
#S1
where d(b, S1 ) is the minimal distance from b ∈ S2 to the set S1 , and #S1 is the
cardinality of S1 , and analogously for S2 . By the choice of normalisation, this
is always bounded between 0 and 1. To more appropriately separate different
behaviours among mortality trends, we modify this semi-metric by including a
regularisation term as follows:
D0 (S1 , S2 ) = D(S1 , S2 ) + β|#S1 − #S2 |,

(3)

where 0 < β < 1 is a constant. The resulting values D0 (S1 , S2 ) are symmetric,
non-negative, and zero if and only if S1 = S2 . Then, we define the n × n matrix
3

DT P between turning point sets by
TP
Dij
= D0 (Pi , Pj ) + D0 (Ti , Tj ).

(4)

We perform hierarchical clustering on DT P in Figure 2, with β = 1/3 (as a
compromise between the usual sizes of D(S1 , S2 ) and |#S1 − #S2 |). These
distances do not capture the absolute values of the mortality rate time series;
they only distinguish between their undulating behaviour, reflected in their sets
of turning points. To round out our analysis, we include another metric, an L1
norm that does account for difference in the absolute values of mortality. We
define another matrix by

Dij

|ri (t) − rj (t)|,

and perform hierarchical clustering on D1 in Figure 3.
2.2. Results
In Figure 1, we display rolling mortality rate and turning points for 12
countries: Brazil, India, Mexico, the United States (US), the Netherlands,
Sweden, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Ecuador and Bulgaria. These countries
display highly heterogeneous behaviours, which are suitably captured in Figure 2.
This dendrogram reveals four clusters of similarity, and one outlier. Russia (1j)
is the unique country with just two detected turning points. Several developing
countries such as Brazil (1a), India (1b) and Mexico (1c) as well as developed
countries including the US (1d), the Netherlands (1e) and Sweden (1f) have
three turning points. France (1g), Germany (1h) and Italy (1i) have four turning
points. Ecuador (1k) and others have five, while Bulgaria (1l) and others have
six.
Within the 4-turning point cluster, we see a dense subcluster of similarity containing Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czechia, France, Georgia, Germany, Hungary,
Italy, Poland, Portugal, Switzerland and the United Kingdom (UK). All these
countries experienced a peak in the mortality rate in April or May (corresponding
to the previous 30 days) and a local minimum near the beginning of September
(corresponding to the previous 30 days during August). This similarity can be
seen by examining members of this cluster, France (1g), Germany (1h) and Italy
(1i).
Turning to Figure 3, several other insights concerning the mortality rate
trajectories emerge. First, Mexico and Ecuador are identified as outliers in the
collection of countries, with only slight similarity to each other. For Mexico (1c),
this is due to a consistently high mortality rate over time, over 10% for most
of the period. Ecuador (1k) is an outlier due to peaks in mortality over 30%,
higher than any other country. Belgium, France, Hungary, Spain, and the UK
form their own smaller cluster characterised by high mortality rates (of around
20%) in their first wave of COVID-19. Indeed, these countries experienced higher
mortality in March-April than anywhere else in the world.

turning points; Brazil, India and the US have three; most European countries have four, with
a strong subcluster of similarity observed including Austria, Belgium, and others. Two smaller
classes are observed containing five and six turning points, respectively.

and May, rapidly decreasing from then.

3. Virulence matrix analysis
In this section, we develop a new framework of time-varying analysis of
30-day rolling virulence matrices, inspired by, but differing from, covariance
matrices in finance [40]. Let t = 30, ..., T be a particular time. We form
vectors xi (t) = (xi (t − 29), ..., xi (t)), analogously for yi (t). These two vectors
record the case and death counts over the past 30 days. We may also form
ri (t) = (ri (t − 29), ..., ri (t)) for t = 59, ..., T , as the time series ri (t) only begin
at t = 30. Define (unscaled) inner products by
t
X

hxi (t), xj (t)i =

xi (s)xj (s).

(6)

s=t−29

We then define n × n (unscaled) virulence matrices with respect to cases, deaths
and mortality rates by the following (i, j = 1, ...n):
Vijc (t) = hxi (t), xj (t)i, t = 30, ..., T ;

(7)

Vijd (t)
Vijr (t)

= hyi (t), yj (t)i, t = 30, ..., T ;

(8)

= hri (t), rj (t)i, t = 59, ..., T.

(9)

We could also analogously define normalised virulence matrices by using normalised inner products in place of the unscaled inner products above. These
matrices are thus named because they provide a representation of the global
spread of COVID-19 over the last 30 days and contain relationships between
different countries’ trajectories. The use of a standard covariance matrix here
would not appropriately measure this prevalence: a country with a constant
(but severe) number of cases for the past 30 days would yield a zero covariance
with any other country. Each matrix V (t) is a n × n symmetric real matrix,
and thus is diagonalisable with all real eigenvalues. By the positivity of the
inner product, each matrix satisfies a non-negativity condition uT V u ≥ 0 for
u ∈ Rn , and so all eigenvalues are non-negative. We list and order the eigenvalues
λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ ... ≥ λn ≥ 0. This produces a time-varying eigenspectrum, which
we display in Figure 4 for the first ten eigenvalues. Moreover, for any such
symmetric matrix, the greatest eigenvalue λ1 holds particular significance. By
the spectral theorem, λ1 coincides with the operator norm of the matrix [41], a
measure of its total size. That is,
λ1 = ||V ||op =

||V u||
.
−{0} ||u||

max
n

u∈R

(10)

Subsequent eigenvalues also have a real-world interpretation. λ2 = 0 if and
only if the matrix V is rank 1, which occurs if and only if all trajectories xi
(in the instance of the cases matrix) differ by a multiplicative constant. In
general, a small value of λ2 relative to λ1 indicates substantial homogeneity in
the trajectories.
In Figures 4a, 4b and 4c, respectively, we display the time-varying eigenspectra
7

for the virulence matrices associated to cases, deaths and mortality rates. There
are several interesting properties of these time-varying eigenspectra. The first
eigenvalue λ1 of Figure 4a demonstrates the general increase of new COVID-19
cases over the course of 2020. The sharp spike towards the end of the year
demonstrates the rapid growth in cases in the final months of 2020. Figure 4b
has two prominent peaks in its first eigenvalue, corresponding to the periods of
March-April and November-December. These peaks highlight the natural history
of COVID-19, where many countries suffered significant deaths during their
first wave of the virus, enforced harsh restrictions resulting in fewer cases and
deaths, and subsequently experienced further growth in cases and deaths upon
such restrictions’ easing. Finally, the first eigenvalue in Figure 4c highlights an
interesting trend in the mortality rate. There is a marked spike in March-April,
followed by a significant reduction throughout the remainder of 2020. This shape
in the first eigenvalue likely represents vulnerable people dying earlier and/or
under-reporting of cases early in the year, contributing to a higher calculated
mortality rate from reported cases and deaths.
The relationship between the first eigenvalue and subsequent eigenvalues
is also of interest. Figure 4a shows the second eigenvalue λ2 becoming quite
significant for cases towards the end of 2020, when the total number of cases is
larger than ever. This shows that the behaviour of new cases in late 2020 is more
heterogeneous than the first wave, when all cases were rising quite uniformly
throughout the world. Figures 4b and 4c show a more moderate, but similar
phenomenon concerning deaths and mortality rate at various stages of the year.
The second eigenvalue in Figure 4b is slightly more pronounced in the second
wave of the virus, displaying more heterogeneity in COVID-19 deaths later in
the year. The second eigenvalue in Figure 4c is more pronounced during the
first wave of the virus - highlighting more heterogeneity during the first wave
of the virus with respect to mortality. Indeed, Figure 1 shows that European
countries experienced substantial mortality in their first wave of COVID-19,
which characterised them as anomalous in Figure 3. This contributed to a
meaningful heterogeneity of mortality rates across the world during the early
stages of the year.
4. Inconsistency analysis
In this section, we describe how we measure the consistency between three
attributes, and reveal anomalous countries in the process. To do so, we introduce
a new method of comparing three distance matrices and apply this to distances
between case and death time series, and human development indices (HDI). Let
hi be the HDI of each country. Calculated by the United Nations Development
Programme [42], this index combines a country’s life expectancy, educational
standards and economic standard of living. Bounded between 0 and 1, the HDI
hi reflects a substantially lower living standard the further h moves from 1. To
reflect this, we use a logarithmic distance between these indices that penalises

movement away from 1 more than a linear distance:
h
Dij
= | log hi − log hj |, i, j = 1, ..., n.

(11)

This forms a n × n distance matrix between countries’ development indices.
Given the exponential nature of the spread of the virus, we also use a logarithmic
distance between the case and death time series. Some of these time series have
negative counts due to retrospective adjustments in the data. In order to ensure
non-negative counts, we first apply a Savitzky-Golay filter to produce smoothed
case and death time series x̂i (t) and ŷi (t) respectively. Due to its moving average
and polynomial smoothing, this eliminates almost all negatives, except when
there are very few counts. We replace any non-positive count with a 1. Then,
we may calculate a logarithmic L1 distance as follows:
c
Dij
= || log x̂i − log x̂j || =

T
X

| log x̂i (t) − log x̂j (t)|;

(12)

| log ŷi (t) − log ŷj (t)|.

(13)

t=1
d
Dij

= || log ŷi − log ŷj || =

T
X
t=1

We use such a metric between case or death time series rather than a simple
difference between the total yearly counts to distinguish between countries (and
hence reveal potential anomalies) according to when the cases or deaths occurred.
Thus, we have defined three n × n distance matrices between countries. Given a
n × n distance matrix D, its corresponding affinity matrix is defined as
Aij = 1 −

Dij
, i, j = 1, ..., n.
max {D}

(14)

All elements of these affinity matrices lie in [0, 1], so it is appropriate to compare
them directly by taking their difference. Given a n × n matrix C, let |C| be the
matrix given by taking the absolute value of all elements, that is |C|ij = |Cij |.
Then, define three n × n symmetric pairwise inconsistency matrices:
INCc,d = |Ac − Ad |;

a weighted anomaly score to reduce bias in one set of anomaly scores being

= ai /M + ai /M +

ai /M . This aims to record a neutral contribution from each anomaly score.
In Tables 1 and 2, we record the anomaly vectors, total anomaly score and
weighted anomaly score for all 50 countries under consideration. In Figure 5, we
plot the total consistency matrix INCc,d,h , where anomalous countries can easily
be seen due to larger entries in their respective rows and columns. An analogous
weighted consistency matrix can also be defined, which is broadly similar to the
one shown.
The total inconsistency matrix and all computed anomaly scores yield several
insights. First, the three most anomalous countries with respect to the weighted
anomaly score are Pakistan, the US and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). A
near-identical result applies if we use the unscaled total anomaly score, with
Pakistan, the US, Nepal and then the UAE exhibiting the largest unscaled
scores. For the US and Pakistan, the highest contribution to the total or
weighted anomaly score comes from their high pairwise anomaly scores ac,h and
ad,h , which are the two highest of any country. Interestingly, these high scores
have differing explanations. The US is highly inconsistent between cases (and
analogously deaths) and HDI due to its much higher case and death counts
than other countries of similar HDI. Pakistan is classified as inconsistent due
to an extreme HDI, the lowest of any country under consideration, but a case
and death time series that are similar to many others. Thus, due to a lower
HDI than other countries with similar case and death counts, it is registered as
inconsistent. We remark that high anomaly scores do not necessarily indicate a
straight-forward anomalous quotient between cases or HDI, for example. Instead,
a high anomaly score reflects inconsistency in relationships with other countries.
On the other hand, the UAE has a high weighted and total anomaly score
due to its value of ac,d , which is the highest of any country. Indeed, the
UAE experienced the lowest mortality rate across 2020 of any country under
consideration. The country with the second-highest value of ac,d is Mexico. This
is anomalous for the opposite reason: a consistently high progression from cases

higher values of the matrix, and hence more inconsistency between the attributes under
consideration: cases, deaths and HDI. The US and Pakistan can be seen to have substantial
inconsistency with many other countries.

to deaths, as first noted in Figure 1c.
5. Discussion and conclusion
In this paper, we analyse the natural history of COVID-19 across 50 countries
over 2020. We observe significant structural similarity between certain countries
as well as heterogeneity across the world with respect to COVID-19 prevalence
and mortality, and identify anomalous countries therein.
In Section 2, we analyse mortality rate trajectories for 50 countries. By
modifying a recently introduced turning point algorithm and introducing a
new semi-metric between turning point sets, we assign these time series into
five characteristic classes according to their differing trajectories. Russia is
identified as an outlier - its mortality rate rose consistently until July and never
dropped substantially enough to register a subsequent trough in our algorithmic
framework. It is unique in this sense among the 50 countries, possessing a
consistently stable mortality rate after its first peak. 19 countries exhibit three
turning points, including Brazil, India and the US, indicating a substantial

reduction in mortality from a first peak. 21 countries exhibit four turning
points, indicating a second wave in which mortality has increased once again.
In particular, a strong subcluster contains most Western European countries:
Austria, Belgium, Czechia, France (1g), Germany (1h), Hungary, Italy (1i),
Portugal, Switzerland, and the UK. These all share highly similar mortality
trajectories, with a first peak in April-May, a trough around September, and
another peak at the end of the year.
There are three wealthy western European countries that do not fit into
this cluster. Both the Netherlands and Sweden, displayed in Figures 1e and 1f
respectively, do not register a second peak in mortality. Indeed, these countries
both kept their mortality low towards the end of the year, while France, Germany
and Italy experienced an increase. Prior research has noted that the Netherlands
reduced its mortality rate substantially in its second wave of COVID-19 [43],
while Sweden changed its COVID-19 response substantially relative to the first
half of the year [44]. Spain registers six turning points primarily due to highly
irregular reporting, featuring negative counts and large numbers of cases and
deaths consolidated and reported on single sporadic days.
A smaller number of countries exhibited more turning points: five with 5
turning points and four with 6. We observe that the majority of developed
countries exhibit 3 or 4 turning points, as visible in Figure 2, while the outlier
countries (with 2,5 or 6 turning points) were mostly developing countries. This
reflects more regular (and less undulating) behaviour in the mortality rate
trajectories and has two explanations. First, more developed countries may have
implemented more consistent testing, which could have caused less fluctuations

14

in the reported mortality rate. Secondly, more developed countries may have
more healthcare resources to improve their treatment of COVID-19 and thereby
reduce and stabilise the mortality rate over time.
In Section 3, we introduce a new class of virulence matrices for cases, deaths
and mortality rates and analyse their eigenspectra. The first eigenvalue λ1
provides a measure of the total scale of the matrices and summarises worldwide
trends in prevalence and mortality throughout 2020. Figure 4a reflects a substantial surge in cases towards the end of the year, Figure 4b shows multiple
waves of deaths of comparable magnitude, while Figure 4c shows an early peak
that dominates the rest of the period. The second eigenvalue λ2 provides a
measure of the heterogeneity among the studied time series. Figure 4a exhibits
a considerable rise in heterogeneity towards the end of the year, during a time in
which new cases trajectories across different countries were substantial but quite
non-uniform. In Figure 4b, we see a much greater value of λ2 during the second
wave of deaths, in which λ1 is in fact lower than the first wave. The much milder
drop off between λ1 and λ2 indicates the greatest heterogeneity with respect to
deaths during this period in the middle of the year. Figure 4c similarly reveals
substantial heterogeneity in mortality rates during the earlier part of the year.
When viewed in conjunction, these three figures provide several insights
into the natural history of the disease throughout 2020. Case counts generally
increased in global severity throughout the year, while death counts constituted
a much clearer pattern of multiple waves. The mortality rate trajectory (4c) can
explain this - in March and April, the progression from reported cases to deaths
was much more severe throughout Europe, causing substantial deaths despite
fewer cases than late 2020. During the middle of the year, the heterogeneity
in death counts was at its highest. Indeed, the months of June to August
featured relatively few new cases in Europe [45], while Brazil [46], India and
other developing countries experienced substantial growth in cases [47]. Towards
the end of the year, the pandemic once again impacted the entire world, with
more counts observed than ever before. During this time, mortality was low,
but cases were so high that deaths became the highest they have ever been.
Heterogeneity in case trajectories also increased substantially, with COVID-19
trajectories differing substantially between different countries, many increasing,
some decreasing, but most with high total counts. One could more closely
examine heterogeneity by considering normalised virulence matrices obtained
from normalised inner products, as explained in Section 3.
In Section 4, we study the consistency between cases, deaths and HDI for
all 50 countries under consideration. We believe that this is the first method
proposed to study (in)consistencies among a collection of time series for up
to three measures. We propose two measures of anomaly across these three
quantities: a total and weighted anomaly score (that more appropriately combines
the contributions of the three pairwise anomaly components). The three most
anomalous countries with respect to the weighted score are Pakistan, the US and
the UAE. Closer inspection of the pairwise anomaly components in Tables 1 and
2 can reveal which quantities most contribute to a country’s total or weighted
score. For the UAE, this is the high anomaly score between cases and deaths,
15

caused by the lowest progression from cases to deaths among our collection of
countries. For the US, both anomaly scores ac,h and ad,h contribute highly;
these reflect the fact that the US has considerably more cases and deaths than
other countries of similar HDI. For Pakistan, the same two anomaly scores ac,h
and ad,h are the largest of any country, but for the opposite reason: its HDI is
substantially lower than any country with a similar case and death time series.
The full collection of anomaly scores can also reveal broad trends regarding
consistency between the three measures. In Tables 1 and 2, we see that the
two pairwise anomaly scores relative to HDI are systematically greater than the
pairwise score between case and death counts. Indeed, we have ac,d
< ad,h
for
i
i
c,d
c,h
every single country and ai < ai for every country except Mexico (which has
the second-highest case-death anomaly score after the UAE due to its consistently
and anomalously high mortality). These patterns reveal systematically more
consistency between case and death counts than between case or death counts
and HDI. Qualitatively, this reveals there is little relationship between a country’s
HDI and its case or death counts. In addition, a closer examination reveals that
ac,h
< ad,h
for 34 out of the 50 countries, 2/3 of the collection. Thus, to a lesser
i
i
extent, there is greater consistency between case counts and HDI than there is
between death counts and HDI. This is a surprising finding - one would naively
expect more consistency between a lower HDI and higher deaths due to poorer
healthcare quality resulting in a greater progression of cases to deaths, regardless
of the number of cases.
Several limitations and opportunities for future research exist in this inconsistency framework. First, the results could also be repeated for case and death
time series as a proportion of each country’s population. Alternative metrics
between cases and deaths could be used, such as a simple difference between the
total yearly counts, without the temporal component provided by the L1 metric.
A closer analysis of the relationship between the varying sizes of the anomaly
scores could quantitatively characterise the differing consistency between three
quantities as a whole. One limitation in this analysis framework is that anomalies
are measured purely by their relative deviation from the rest of the collection,
and direction (positive or negative) is ignored. A closer inspection is necessary
to determine the nature of the anomaly. However, this could be seen as a benefit
of the methodology as well, as it is flexible in the detection of different sorts of
inconsistent behaviour.
Overall, this paper introduces new methods for analysing COVID-19 prevalence and mortality on a country-by-country and worldwide basis and chronicles
the natural history of COVID-19 during 2020. On a global scale, we reveal
broad trends in case and death counts as well as mortality trajectories, which
present a coherent picture of the changing impacts of COVID-19 over time.
On a country-by-country basis, we reveal both heterogeneity and structural
similarity with respect to mortality over time and study consistency between
COVID-19 prevalence and human development, revealing specific anomalous
countries. Moreover, the framework presented in this paper could be applied
broadly to various epidemiological or economic crises.

16

As 2021 begins, the world remains severely affected by COVID-19. Though
vaccination distribution is underway in many countries, the analysis of trends
in cases, deaths and mortality remains of substantial relevance to governments.
The identification of structural similarity in mortality rate trajectories between
European states may inspire additional cooperation [7] and coordination of their
strategic response to the pandemic. Our methods highlight countries that have
responded particularly well or poorly, and our analysis highlights points in time
where cases, deaths and mortality rates changed substantially for candidate
countries. Finally, we reveal global changes in the relationship between cases,
deaths and mortality rates over time. Such changes should inform governments
regarding their response to the pandemic. This will be particularly crucial in
the coming months, as various vaccines are administered over the world.
Data availability
Daily COVID-19 case and death counts and human development index data
can be accessed at "Our World in Data" [48].
Appendix A. Turning point methodology
In this section, we provide more details for the identification of turning
points of a mortality rate time series r(t). First, some smoothing is necessary
due to irregularities in the data set, and discrepancies between different data
sources. The Savitzy-Golay filter ameliorates these issues by combining polynomial smoothing with a moving average computation, and yields a smoothed time
series r̂(t) ∈ R≥0 . Subsequently, we perform a two-step process to select and
then refine a non-empty set P of local maxima (peaks) and T of local minima
(troughs).
Following [15], we apply a two-step algorithm to the smoothed time series
r̂(t). The first step produces an alternating sequence of troughs and peaks. The
second step refines this sequence according to chosen conditions and parameters.
The most important conditions to identify a peak or trough, respectively, in the
first step, are the following:
r̂(t0 ) = max{r̂(t) : max(1, t0 − l) ≤ t ≤ min(t0 + l, T )},

(A.1)

r̂(t0 ) = min{r̂(t) : max(1, t0 − l) ≤ t ≤ min(t0 + l, T )},

(A.2)

where l is a parameter to be chosen. Following [15], we select l = 17, which
accounts for the 14-day incubation period of the virus [49] and less testing on
weekends. Defining peaks and troughs according to this definition alone has
several flaws, such as the potential for two consecutive peaks.
Instead, we implement an inductive procedure to choose an alternating
sequence of peaks and troughs. Suppose t0 is the last determined peak. We
search in the period t > t0 for the first of two cases: if we find a time t1 > t0
that satisfies (A.2) as well as a non-triviality condition r̂(t1 ) < r̂(t0 ), we add

17

t1 to the set of troughs and proceed from there. If we find a time t1 > t0 that
satisfies (A.1) and r̂(t0 ) ≥ r̂(t1 ), we ignore this lower peak as redundant; if we
find a time t1 > t0 that satisfies (A.1) and r̂(t1 ) > r̂(t0 ), we remove the peak t0 ,
replace it with t1 and continue from t1 . A similar process applies from a trough
at t0 .
At this point, the time series is assigned an alternating sequence of troughs
and peaks. However, some turning points are immaterial and should be excluded.
The second step is a flexible approach introduced in [15] for this purpose. In
this paper, we introduce new conditions within this framework. First, we use
the same peak ratio procedure: let t1 < t3 be two peaks, necessarily separated
by a trough. We select a parameter δ = 0.2, and if the peak ratio, defined as
r̂(t3 )
r̂(t1 ) < δ, we remove the peak t3 . If two consecutive troughs t2 , t4 remain, we
remove t2 if r̂(t2 ) > r̂(t4 ), otherwise remove t4 . That is, if the second peak has
size less than δ of the first peak, we remove it.
Finally, let t1 , t2 be adjacent turning points (one a trough, one a peak). We
choose a parameter  = log(2); if
| log r̂(t2 ) − log r̂(t1 )| < ,

(A.3)

that is, the values of the turning point differ by less than a factor of 2, we
remove t2 from our sets of peaks and troughs. If t2 is not the final turning point,
we also remove t1 . This is a different condition from previous work - whereas
[15] considers the average change with time between turning points of new case
trajectories, we consider only the absolute change between turning points in
mortality rate. Indeed, there is no need to consider how much time has passed
when determining whether mortality has increased or decreased by a sufficient
amount, in our implementation a factor of 2, to warrant a turning point being
included.
