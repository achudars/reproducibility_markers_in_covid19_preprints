A novel fractal structure for the cosmological horizon, inspired by COVID-19 geometry, which
results in a modified area entropy, is applied to cosmology in order to serve dark energy. The
constraints based on a complete set of observational data are derived. There is a strong Bayesian
evidence in favor of such a dark energy in comparison to a standard ΛCDM model and that this
energy cannot be reduced to a cosmological constant. Besides, there is a shift towards smaller values
of baryon density parameter and towards larger values of the Hubble parameter, which reduces the
Hubble tension.
INTRODUCTION

Black holes and cosmological horizons are very strongly
explored phenomena in physics recently because they
make the link between the classical and the quantum
in the context of gravity. Through the Hawking temperature [1] and Bekenstein area entropy [2], they allow
thermodynamics to be related to the classical geometry
of space. So, any modification of geometry will influence the entropy related to the horizons. A modification
of fractal nature has been recently proposed by Barrow
[3] who was inspired by the COVID-19 virus geometrical
structure. The idea is to consider the core sphere of the
horizon with the attached number N of heavily packed
smaller spheres, to each of which, step by step, a number N of some smaller spheres are latched on and so on,
forming a fractal. The obtained fractal, which contains
a series of smaller and smaller spheres, is analogous to
known fractal structures such as the Koch snowflake, the
Sierpiński gasket, and the Menger sponge [3] - one can
find many of their graphical representations in the literature and over the internet. Simple calculations which
apply geometrical series allow to add up all the surfaces
of a hierarchical system of spheres which can be called
the “sphereflake”. The recurrence formula for the radius
rn+1 of the (n + 1)-th sphere is rn+1 = λrn , where rn is
the radius of the n-th sphere, and λ < 1. Taking infinite
number of steps (n → ∞), we can count up the effective
surface area of all the spheres as a geometrical series

with an effective radius being defined as

where 0 ≤ ∆ ≤ 1, provided that N λ2 < 1. The resulting
2
effective surface area Aef f ∝ ref
f is larger than the core
2
sphere surface area A ∝ r (so r ∝ A1/2 ) of radius r
and in the extreme case of ∆ = 1, it acts as if it was a

volume because the spheres cover a piece of a 3-volume,
despite they are surfaces. In other words, geometrically,
we sum up the areas, but since our main concern is the
area entropy issue, then we deal with information aspects
of the problem. In fact, when ∆ = 1 one has the most
intricate surface of the horizon with the COVID-19-like
fractal geometry. Modification of the horizon area immediately leads to a change of the effective Bekenstein
entropy, making it larger than in a smooth case, according to the formula

where kB is the Boltzmann constant.
In cosmology, there has been a vivid discussion of possible explanations of the dark energy phenomenon as
contributed from cosmological horizons, leading to holographic dark energy [4]. It emerges that the fractal horizon can extra contribute to the matter. This has been
first calculated in [5] and then tested by observational
data from Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa) Pantheon sample and passively evolving early-type galaxies acting as
Cosmic Chronometers (CC) in [6].
In this work we apply the full set of cosmological data
up-to-date to derive the most comprehensive bounds on
the holographic and fractal parameters. The issue is that
they strongly differ from the ones obtained in [5], as we
will show later.
THEORETICAL BACKGROUND

According to [4] the holographic dark energy is given
by ρH ∝ Sef f L−4 with the effective Bekenstein entropy

2
Sef f ∝ Aef f ∝ L2+∆ , where L is the horizon length.
Thus, following [5] we can express Barrow holographic
dark energy (BH) as:
ρBH =

3 C 2 2( ∆2 −1)
L
,
8πG

(5)

where C is the holographic parameter with dimensions of
[T]−1 [L]1−∆/2 and G the Newton gravitational constant.
As suggested in [7], we identify the length L with the
future event horizon:

where a is the scale factor. The cosmological equation is
simply
H2 =

where the suffices m and r refer respectively to matter
and radiation. Note that the standard continuity equation for matter and radiation is still valid, i.e.

(8)
ρ̇m,r + 3H ρm,r + 2

where the pressure pi = wi ρi , with the equation of state
parameter wi being 0 for standard pressureless matter
and 1/3 for radiation. We rewrite Eq. (7) as
1 = Ωm (a) + Ωr (a) + ΩH (a) ,

(9)

introducing the dimensionless density parameters Ωi (a)1 ,
defined as

It is easy to verify that in the limit Ωr → 0 one retrieves
Eq. (14) from [5].
Although the main focus of this work will be based
on the above discussion, we need to emphasize that the
identification of the boundary with the event horizon,
Eq. (6), is not the only possible choice. Following [8],
in [7] it was assumed that only the event horizon could
give rise to a proper accelerated expansion, i.e. to a holographic dark energy, while particle and Hubble horizons
were unsuitable. But in [9] it was shown that indeed the
Hubble horizon can be assumed as boundary and can induce a proper holographic dark energy, but only if an
interaction between dark energy and dark matter was allowed. We will show here that the BH model can instead
have the Hubble horizon as a boundary and result in an
effective dark energy behaviour without the need of any
interaction between the dark sectors.
If we assume the Hubble horizon as the boundary,
namely
c

(15)
H(a)
the BH dark energy density would look like (absorbing
the speed of light c into the constant C):
3 C 2 2(1− ∆2 )
H
.
(16)
8πG
Still relying on the separate conservation of both matter
and radiation, Eq. (9) would remain the same, but with
the dimensionless BH density parameter defined as
ρBH =

In order to find the evolution of the holographic dark
energy density, we follow [7] and [5] procedure: (1.) we
insert Eq. (12) into Eq. (6); (2.) we obtain the future
event horizon from inversion of Eq. (11); (3.) we compare results from step (1) and step (2) and differentiate

C 2 2(1− ∆2 )
H
= C 2 H −∆ .
(17)
H2
We will now analyze what happens in the two extremal
cases, i.e. ∆ = 0 and ∆ = 1. For ∆ = 0, from Eq. (9) we
find
ΩBH (a) =

1

We will follow the standard convention for which Ωi (a), as a function, is the dimensionless density parameter at any scale factor a,
while Ωi , with no argument specified, will be the dimensionless
density parameter at the present time, i.e. Ωi (a = 1) = Ωi .

ΩBH (a = 1) = C 2 = 1 − Ωm − Ωr ,

(18)

so that Eq. (7) becomes:

C 2 = (1 − Ωm − Ωr ) H0 ,

Now we cannot easily disentangle the behaviour of the
effective holographic dark energy from the other components, but we can have an insight from studying the
behaviour of the dimensionless density,
ΩBH (a) =

(1 − Ωm − Ωr )H0

and Eq. (7) becomes a second order equation in the Hubble parameter:


(21)
whose solution is:
H(a) =

Ωm,BH (a)

If we consider negligible the contribution of radiation we
arrive to H 2 ∝ a−3 , ρBH ∝ H 2 ∝ a−3 , Ωm ∝ const.
and ΩBH ∝ const., which clearly reproduce the flaws
highlighted in [7] which can be solved only if we add
interaction in the dark sector as suggested in [9].
But ∆ = 0 is a trivial case, where BH model is reduced
to the standard one. The situation is totally different
when ∆ = 1; indeed, in this case from Eq. (9) we have

0.8

H 2 = H02

Ωm a−3 + Ωr a−4 + (1 − Ωm − Ωr )H 2 . (19)

(25)

In Fig. 1, where we have Ωm (a) in blue and ΩBH (a)
in black in the top panel, and wBH (a) in the bottom
one, we clearly show that the Hubble radius, in the BH
dark energy context, can safely play the role of boundary, implying a dark energy behaviour (note the limit
wBH −−−→ −1/3 independent of the set parameters)
a→0

without any need to introduce interaction in the dark
sector.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

To analyze in full detail the compatibility of BH with
cosmological data, we use the most updated set of data

available today related to the geometrical global evolution of our Universe at large scales. We consider: Type
Ia Supernovae (SNeIa) from the Pantheon sample; Cosmic Chronometers (CC); the gravitational lensing data
from COSMOGRAIL’s Wellspring project (H0LiCOW);
the “Mayflower” sample of Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs);
Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from several surveys; and the latest Planck 2018 release for Cosmic Microwave Background radiation (CMB).
We consider two different cases: the set which we call
“full data”, where we join both early- (CMB and BAO
data from SDSS) and late-time observations (SNeIa, CC,
H0LiCOW, GRBs and BAO data from WiggleZ); and
the “late-time” data set, which includes only late-time
data. We have decided to consider these two cases separately, because while on the one hand early-time data
have much more stringent constraining power in cosmological model inference than late-time ones, on the other
hand, they seem to be biased to statistically support a
standard ΛCDM model, i.e. a cosmological constant as
dark energy. By separating data in such a way, we could
aim to have some more insight into a possible presence
of a time varying dark energy candidate.
To perform our statistical analysis, we define the total χ2 as the sum of all the contributions considered,

4
χ2 = χ2SN + χ2G + χ2H + χ2HCOW + χ2BAO + χ2CM B . To
minimize the χ2 we use our own code implementation
of a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) [10–12] and
we test its convergence using the method of [13]. Finally, we assess BH reliability using Bayesian Evidence,
E. Our reference model is the standard ΛCDM model,
analyzed with the same set of data. Then, we calculate
the Bayesian Evidence using the algorithm from [14]. To
reduce its prior dependence [15] and avoid any misleading estimation, we have used the same uninformative flat
priors on the parameters for each model while running
our MCMC codes, on a sufficiently wide range, so that a
further increasing has negligible impact on E. Such priors are mainly physically motivated: 0 < Ωb < Ωm < 1,
0 < h < 1, 0 ≤ ∆ ≤ 1 [3], and C > 0 (given Eq. (5), we
cannot discriminate among positive and negative values).
After the Bayesian Evidence, we define the Bayes Factor
as the ratio of evidence between two models, Mi and Mj ,
Bji = Ei /Ej : if Bji > 1, model Mi is preferred over Mj ,
given the data. As stated above, here the ΛCDM model
will play the role of the reference models Mj . Finally, in
order to state how much better is model Mi with respect
to model Mj , we have followed the Jeffreys’ Scale [16].
Type Ia Supernovae

The Pantheon compilation [17] is made of 1048 objects
spanning the redshift range 0.01 < z < 2.26. The corresponding χ2SN is defined as
SN
χ2SN = ∆µSN · C−1
,
SN · ∆µ

(26)

where ∆µ = µtheo −µobs is the difference between the theoretical and the observed value of the distance modulus
for each SNeIa and CSN represents the total covariance
matrix. Note that we do not use the binned version as in
[6], but the full one. The distance modulus is defined as
µ(z, p) = 5 log10 [dL (z, p)] + µ0 ,

(27)

where

The definition of CC is used for Early-Type galaxies
which exhibit a passive evolution and a characteristic feature in their spectra [19], for which can be used as clocks
and provide measurements of the Hubble parameter H(z)
[20]. The sample we are going to use in this work is from
[21] and covers the redshift range 0 < z < 1.97. The χ2H
is defined as

H0LiCOW

On of the main novelty in the cosmological data set
used here to constrain a cosmological model is the data
from the H0LiCOW collaboration [22]. The main goal
was to use the sensitivity of strong gravitational lensing
events to constrain H0 and, possibly, other parameters
characterizing the cosmological background. H0LiCOW
has used 6 selected lensed quasars [23] for which it was
possible to retrieve multiple (lensing) images. Having
multiple images makes it possible to take advantage of
lensing time delay as a cosmological probes: in fact, it is
well-known that during a lensing event, the light travel
time from the sources (in this case, the quasars) to the
observer depends both on the path length and on the
gravitational potential of the foreground mass(ess) (the
lenses). When multiple images are produced, they can
exhibit a time delay at collection given by


(31)

DLS 2
In a typical gravitational lensing configuration [24], zL is
the lens redshift, θ is the angular position of the image,
β is the angular position of the source and Ψ̂ is the effective lens potential. The distances DS , DL and DLS
are, respectively, the angular diameter distances from the
source to the observer, from the lens to the observer, and
between source and lens. The angular diameter distance
is given by

DA (z, p) =

so that we have: DS = DA (zS ), DL = DA (zL ), and
DLS = 1/(1 + zS ) [(1 + zS )DS − (1 + zL )DL ] [25]. The

Gamma Ray Bursts

Although the possibility to “standardize” GRBs is still
on debate, we focus on the “Mayflower” sample, made
of 79 GRBs in the redshift interval 1.44 < z < 8.1 [26],
because it has been calibrated with a robust cosmological
model independent procedure. The observational probe
related to GRBs observable is the distance modulus, so
the same procedure used for SNeIa is also applied here.

From the DR12 we also include measurements derived

Cosmic Microwave Background

As CMB data we use the shift parameters defined in
[34] and derived from the latest Planck 2018 data release
[35]. Thus, the χ2CM B is defined as
CM B
χ2CM B = ∆F CM B · C−1
,
CM B · ∆F

where the vector F CM B is made of the quantities:
q
r(z∗ , p)
R(p) ≡ Ωm H02

r(z∗ , p)
la (p) ≡ π

rs (z∗ , p)
in addition to Ωb h2 . Here rs (z∗ ) is the comoving sound
horizon evaluated at the photon-decoupling redshift evaluated using the fitting formula from [36],

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

We display constraints on cosmological parameters
from our MCMC analysis in Table I, and the convergence

test on MCMC runs in Table II. The posterior distributions for each parameter are shown in Fig. 2.
If we compare our analysis to the one in [6], we can
definitely assess that late-time-only observations are unable to constrain BH dark energy parameters, with the
fractal parameter ∆ spanning the full range of validity,
and the BH characteristic energy scale C being well defined (contrarily to what found in [6]), but with large
errors. The addition of early-time data is crucial: both
parameters’ confidence levels are now highly narrowed,
as can be seen in the left panel of Fig. 3. Note that the
value of the fractal parameter ∆ totally rejects both the
lower (∆ = 0) and the upper (∆ = 1) limit.
The most striking result is given by the Bayes ratio: given Jeffreys’ scale, there is “strong evidence”,
ln Bji ≈ 3.5, in favour of BH dark energy w.r.t. a standard ΛCDM. This is a very surprising claim taking into
account the outside of cosmological origin (i.e. COVID19-like) nature of this type of dark energy, reinforced by
the fact that the BH dark energy cannot be reduced to
a cosmological constant.
Moreover, if we pay more attention to the values of the
cosmological parameters, we can see that this statistical
preference is led by a shift in both the Hubble constant, h,
and the baryonic content, Ωb (this is an important point,
because Ωb is called into question only when dealing with
early-time data). As shown in the right panel of Fig. 3,
we have a shift toward smaller values of Ωb , partially
consistent with the ΛCDM scenario on the upper tail,
and larger values of h, thus reducing the Hubble tension
[37–39] to . 2.75σ.
This shift in the cosmological parameters has as main
consequence a shift in both the sound horizon value (at
decoupling, rs (z∗ ) and at dragging, rs (zd ), epochs) and
in the distance to last scattering. In Table I we report the
values of both the sound horizons for all the considered
models. The change with respect to ΛCDM is clear, but

it is actually naturally expected if we look more carefully
at the behaviour of the BH dark energy.
In Figs. 4 and 5 we plot the evolution of the dimensionless density parameters, which clearly show how the BH
dark energy model effectively behaves as an Early Dark
Energy (EDE) model, although starting from totally different theoretical premises. The shifts in the geometrical
distances connected to CMB physics are a quite known
fact [40] for EDEs, and the Barrow holographic model

perfectly fits this scenario.
In the left panel of Fig. 4 we show the evolution with
time of matter (blue), baryons (red) and dark energy
(grey/black) for both full BH model (1σ confidence levels as shaded regions) and full ΛCDM (dashed lines). For
what concerns matter and baryons, the behaviours from
the two scenarios are statistically equivalent both at late
and early (approaching decoupling epoch) times, which
are the regimes directly tested by our data. The depar-

ture at intermediate redshifts, z ∼ [10, 100] is of course
due to the lack of probes in that regime, but it still statistically not relevant.
Instead, for what concerns the dark energy component,
we see that the fractal horizon-based holographic model
from Barrow’s proposal is an effective EDE, qualitatively

and quantitatively. The right panel of Fig. 4 compares
BH model (the solid black line is the best fit-derived behaviour) with ΛCDM. The scales of the axis have been
choosing for a better comparison with literature, as for
example with Fig. 1 in [41]. In Fig. 5, we plot ΩBH (a) in
different redshift regimes, from left to right: late times

9
only; till CMB (full redshift range of our probes); and at
early times, prior to decoupling era.
In the right panel of Fig. 4 we can note how we do have
a bump in ΩBH (a) at z ∼ 103 ÷ 104 which, giving our
results, is totally consistent with the used geometrical
probes. Trying to have more insights about all these results, we can compare our work with literature for EDEs.
The Planck survey has tried to put constraints on some
EDE models [42], with data from the 2015 release (a
more recent analysis with Planck 2018 data can be found
in [43]). Although a direct comparison with the model
considered here is not possible because the behaviours
of the fluids do not resemble each other, we can have
indirect insights in the physical soundness of BH dark
energy if we calculate some parameters like, for example,
the amount of dark energy at early time. For BH we
have ΩBH (a = 0) . 4 · 10−4 : even if we are using only
geometrical probes, this constraint is as good as and as
stringent as the one which can be derived by using the
full power spectrum information from Planck, see Table
3 and Fig. 11 in [42].
A different EDE model has been analyzed in [44]; in
their Table I one can find values for the sound horizon at
recombination and check how for EDEs the shifts in such
geometrical distances are natural, exactly like it happens
for our model. More interestingly, the model in [44] is
characterized by two further parameters: the scale factor ac at which we have a transition (or switch) in the
EDE fluid from a cosmological constant-like behaviour
to a dynamical one, and the amount of EDE expected
at that same redshift. It turns out that the fit to the
data (including Planck 2015 power spectrum) is consistent with log ac ∼ −3.7 and an EDE fraction of ∼ 5%.
Our model, based only on geometrical probes, has the
bump at log ac ∼ −3.6 and the fraction of BH dark energy at that time is ∼ 6.6%. We need to add also that the
analysis in [44] uses at the same time both Planck data
and the measurement of H0 from local probes, which is
surely acting as a prior/bias on the final results, more
specifically in lowering the Hubble tension. In our case,
instead, we are not using any prior on H0 , but we have
added data from H0LICOW. Thus, the agreement between the two scenarios, although very different, is quite
strong, and we are confident that BH dark energy might
be still successful in fitting data related to cosmological
perturbations.
A further analysis about its influence on the growth
of perturbations [45] is of course needed and will be presented in a forthcoming paper. Careful attention will be
needed to understand the role of dark energy perturbations, which are not taken into account in [46], for example, but seem to be important to successfully fit the data,
as shown in [44]. Thus the real question to be addressed
will be only how this further analysis will influence the
new parameters of Barrow formulation (the fractal dimension in particular) and if the statistical preference for

this model with respect to ΛCDM will stay untouched,
lowered or improved.
