Abstract: What is the impact of COVID-19 on South Africa? This paper envisages assisting researchers
and decision-makers in battling the COVID-19 pandemic focusing on South Africa. This paper focuses
on the spread of the disease by applying heatmap retrieval of hotspot areas and spatial analysis is
carried out using the Moran index. For capturing spatial autocorrelation between the provinces of
South Africa, the adjacent, as well as the geographical distance measures, are used as a weight matrix
for both absolute and relative counts. Furthermore, generalized logistic growth curve modeling is used
for the prediction of the COVID-19 spread. We expect this data-driven modeling to provide some
insights into hotspot identification and timeous action controlling the spread of the virus.
Keywords: Adjacent distance; COVID-19; Geographical distance; Logistic modelling; Moran’s I; South

1. Introduction
During December 2019, several cases of pneumonia of an unknown aetiology were reported in
Wuhan, a city within the Hubei province of China ([1]). Within a week investigators found that the
initial cases where all associated with a seafood market where live poultry and wild animals were
being sold ([2]). Since then the disease has been registered, and become known, as the coronavirus
or COVID-19 which is caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2).
This disease has shown that in early stages of infection, symptoms of severe acute respiratory infection
can occur. These may include a cough, fever and shortness of breath ([3]). Some patients may then
develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other serious complications which may
potentially lead to multiple organ failure ([1]). Since mid-December, COVID-19 has spread to all seven
continents, increasing its prevalence throughout the entire world, and was declared a pandemic, by
the World Health Organization (WHO) on the 11th of March ([4]). This rapid spread has been fuelled
by the fact that the majority of infected people do not experience severe symptoms, which makes it

more likely to remain mobile and hence infect others ([5]). The transmission primarily occurs through
contact from person to person, coughing or sneezing and touching of contaminated surfaces ([6]).
On the 14th of February the first case of COVID-19 was reported in Africa, in the City of Cairo, by the
Egyptian Ministry of Health and Population. The individual, who travelled between China and Cairo on
a business trip was identified through contact screening ([7]). The first South African case was
confirmed by The National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) on the morning of the 5th of
March 2020. The patient, a 38 year old male, was part of a group of 10 people, including his wife, who
arrived back in South Africa on the 1st of March from Europe. Since then the number of infections and
deaths have risen drastically. President Cyril Rhamaphosa was praised by the director-general of the
WHO, Dr Tedros Adganom Ghemreyesus, for his leadership and approach to protecting South Africans
during these trying times ([8]). The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) also commended President
Cyril Ramaphosa for his leadership and for South Africa’s “ruthlessly efficient” response to the
coronavirus ([9]). On the 15th of March President Cyril Ramaphosa declared a national state of
disaster, the terms of the Disaster Management Act which enable the focus to be put on preventing
and reducing the risk of the virus spreading ([10]), and only a few days later on the 23rd of March the
President declared a national lockdown commencing on midnight of the 26th of March.
In South Africa, these extreme measures are absolutely necessary, as the country contains a high risk
population combined with low-income country characteristics. The main concerns, which are thought
to escalate the spread of the coronavirus, are the large and densely populated areas and townships,
including a high level of poverty and movement within these areas. Combined with existing epidemics
such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), tuberculosis (TB) and malaria, this might lead to an
increase in morbidity and mortality. Since the wide spread of non-communicable diseases, such as
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart disease, hypertension and diabetes, in Africa are
known risk factors for severe cases of COVID-19 these may also increase the death rate in these lowerincome countries ([11]). As winter is approaching, overcrowded houses and the large
immunocompromised population, will contribute to the increase in the number of COVID-19 cases
rising ([12]).
To date, as reported by the Coronavirus disease 2019 [13], South Africa has the largest number of
COVID-19 cases in Africa. Although it has been shown that South Africans are generally complying
during the lockdown, by investigating insights from vehicle-tracking data, is was shown that vehicle
activity dropped by 20% even before the lockdown and reduced by 75% after the lockdown was
implemented ([14]). This decline in movement directly indicates the effect on the economy, with the
closure of businesses like manufacturing, retail and restaurants, to name only a few. With numerous
businesses no longer operating, many South Africans are no longer receiving an income. The Human
Science Research Council also released a note on the mental health of South Africans, stating that the
stage is already set for major mental health implications, and noting that that failure to put measures
into place to mitigate the psychological impacts of quarantine, is likely to lead to an ineffective and
slow economic recovery ([15]).
In this study, we make use of the Moran index to spatially identify the spread in South Africa with
respect to the provinces for the COVID-19 infections. Finding these hotspots will provide insights in
identifying, and assist in tracking, the COVID-19 spread. With this information South Africa will be
better able to predict local outbreaks and develop public health policies to better manage and update
medical procedures currently set in place. Since the strict lockdown (level 5) is phased out from the
1st of May (moved to level 4 lockdown), the location of these hotspots could assist in guiding the riskadjusted strategy and the economic activity plan, set out by the South African government. It would
thus be important to know where these hotspots are and if they are statistically significant. Further, a

generalized logistic model of the growth trend will be employed to show the difference between the
hotspot areas and the areas outside of it. With the continuing growth and development of COVID-19
in South Africa, this analysis might be helpful to guide political leaders and health authorities to
manage the allocation of resources and prepare for future virus control.
The effect of COVID-19 is still in early stages in South Africa but different tendencies have already been
observed when compared to the US and other European countries ([13]). Understanding these
tendencies will be very important in guiding the fight against COVID-19 in South African as well as the
rest of Africa. This is an initial study from which many other interesting studies will follow and it will
be very important to continue with analyses as more cases are reported and more data becomes
available. South Africa, with the most confirmed COVID-19 cases, will need to be the leader in guiding
the fight against COVID-19 in Africa.

2. Study Area and Materials
South Africa, formally known as the Republic of South Africa, is situated at the southernmost tip of
Africa and covers a surface area of 1 219 602 km. With a coastline stretching more than 3000km from
the desert border of Namibia touching the Atlantic Ocean, around the tip of Africa to the northern
bordered of Mozambique on the Indian Ocean side. South Africa shares common boundaries with
Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Swaziland, with the Mountain Kingdom of Lesotho landlocked by SA.
The Prince Edward and Marion islands lie some 1 920km south-east of Cape Town ([16]).
With a population of more than 59 million, South Africa is the world’s 25’th most populated nation
consisting of nine different provinces. South Africa has three designated capital cities; executive
Pretoria, judicial Bloemfontein and legislative Cape Town. The largest city and main economic hub
being Johannesburg, which is also the main entry point for visitors from other countries via OR
Thambo International Airport ([16]).
The following timeline of the major interventions in South Africa for the COVID-19 outbreak and the
statistics are shown in Figures 1 and 2 respectively.

The Data Science for Social Impact research (DSFSI) group at the University of Pretoria captures the
COVID-19 data, number of cases, on national and provincial level. Missing values and anomalies in the
provincial data are adjusted or imputed using data from the University of Cape Town COVID-19
dashboard. The demographic data used are the provincial population numbers published by. Number
of recoveries and deaths used are those published by the NICD.
Distances between the provinces are determined using the main city from each of the provinces. The
main city is the city most likely to be the highest risk for COVID-19 infection. In most cases, the main
city is also the capital city of the province. The main cities are indicated in Table 1.

3. Methods
The spatial correlation between the 9 provinces, Northern Cape, Eastern Cape, Free State, Western
Cape, Limpopo, North West, KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga, and Gauteng in South Africa, we use the
Moran’s autocorrelation coefficient, also known as the Moran index (denoted by I) in geographic
health science. Furthermore, we make use of generalized logistic function (GLF) for identifying an
appropriate growth curve of COVID-19. Hence, this section is devoted to the definition of Moran index
(Moran’s I) as well as the GLF.
3.1. Spatial correlation coefficient
The Moran index, originally defined by [17], is a measure of spatial association or spatial
autocorrelation which can be used to find spatial hotspots or clusters and is available in many software
applications. This index has been defined as the measure of choice for scientists, specifically in
environmental sciences, ecology and public health ([18]). Some other indices include the Getis’ G
index, Geary’s C, local Ii and Gi, spatial scan statistics and Tango’s C index ([19] and [18]). The Moran
index has both a local and global representation. The global Moran’s I is a global measure for spatial
autocorrelation while the local Moran’s I index examines the individual locations, enabling hotspots
to be identified based on comparisons to the neighbouring locations ([19]). This local Moran’s I has
been successfully applied to hotspot identification for infection clusters such as those investigated by
[20], who researched the bovine tuberculosis breakdowns (bTB )in Northern Irish cattle herds in order
to access the spatial association in the number and prevalence of chronic bTB across Northern Ireland.
Other areas where this index has been successfully applied and commonly used are diseases, mortality
rates, environmental planning and environmental sciences. It’s important to note that the result can
be affected by the definition of the weight function, data transformation and existence of outliers
([19]).
Until now, not many COVID-19 related research has made use of the Moran Index and no research
was found for South African specific cases. Some studies that include the use of this index are: 1) [21]
explored the spatial epidemic dynamic of COVID-19 in mainland China in order to determine whether
a spatial association of the COVID-19 infection existed; 2) [22] applied the Moran index to a spatial
panel which showed that COVID-19 infection is spatially dependent and mainly spread from Hubei
Province in Central Chine to neighbouring areas; 3) [23] used a global dataset of COVID-19 cases as
well as a global climate database and investigated how climate parameters could contribute to the
growth rate of COVID-19 cases while simultaneously controlling for potential confounding effects
using spatial analysis; 4) [24] used data on all mobile phone users to examine the impact of the
Coronavirus outbreak under the Swedish mild recommendations and restrictions regime on individual
mobility and if the changes in geographical mobility vary over different socio-economic strata and 5)
[25] investigated the influence of spatial proximities and travel patterns from Italy on the further
spread of the SARS-CoV-2 around the globe.
This index is an extension of the Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient for spatial
pattern recognition. Observations in close proximity are more likely to be similar than those far apart
([26-27]). In order to formulate the Moran index for our purpose, assume we have 𝑑 provinces and
the pair (𝑥𝑖 , 𝑥𝑗 ) is for the attribute (variable) 𝑥 in provinces 𝑖, 𝑗 = 1, ⋯ , 𝑑, respectively. Then, the
spatial weight 𝑤𝑖𝑗 quantifies the level of closeness between 𝑥𝑖 and 𝑥𝑗 and the Moran index is defined
by
𝑑 ∑𝑑𝑖=1 ∑𝑑𝑗=1 𝑤𝑖𝑗 (𝑥𝑖 − 𝑥̅ )(𝑥𝑗 − 𝑥̅ )
ℐ= ×
,
(1)
𝑆𝑜
∑𝑑𝑖=1(𝑥𝑖 − 𝑥̅ )2

where 𝑥̅ = 𝑛−1 ∑𝑛𝑖=1 𝑥𝑖 and 𝑆𝑜 = ∑𝑛𝑖=1 ∑𝑛𝑗=1 𝑤𝑖𝑗 ; 𝑖 ≠ 𝑗.
The Moran’s ℐ takes value on [−1,1] and ℐ = 0 shows no spatial correlation between the provinces
for the underlying attribute. According to [28], there are two ways to identify the weights. In our
context, we identify the (𝑖, 𝑗)-th element of the weight matrix 𝑊, from taxonomic level classification
viewpoint, as
1 if the provinces i and j are connected
𝑤𝑖𝑗 = {
0
otherwise
Using the phylogenetic tree classification (geographical distance), we assign the weights following
1
𝛼 𝑖𝑓 𝐷𝑖𝑗 ≤ 𝜆
𝑤𝑖𝑗 = {𝐷𝑖𝑗
0 𝑖𝑓 𝐷𝑖𝑗 > 𝜆
where 𝐷𝑖𝑗 is the distance between the province centre 𝑖 and province centre 𝑗, 𝜆 is a distance
threshold, and 𝛼 is a power level parameter. See [29] for more detail and comparison between
different weights.
3.2. Modeling population growth
In this section, we predict some attributes via logistic growth curve modeling. The logistic
function/curve is commonly used for dynamic modeling in many branches of science including
chemistry, physics, material science, forestry, disease progression, sociology, etc. For our purpose
and generality, we follow the Richards' differential equation (RDE) due to [30] given by
𝜈

𝑑𝑃(𝑡) 1
𝑃(𝑡)
= (1 − (
) ) 𝑃(𝑡)
𝑑𝑡
𝛼
𝐾
with initial condition 𝑃(𝑡𝑜 ) = 𝑃𝑜 , 𝐾 is the carrying capacity, the maximum capacity or total
population here, 𝛼, 𝜈 > 0 to obtain the generalized logistic curve (GLC)
𝐾

𝑃(𝑡) =
(1 +

1
𝜈(𝑡−𝑡𝑜 ) 𝜈
−
𝛼
𝑄𝑒
)

(2)

𝐾 𝜈

with 𝑄 = (𝑃 ) − 1.
𝑜

The typical logistic curve which is widely used in modeling, is the special of the GLC for 𝜈 = 1. Further,
the Gompertz curve can be obtained for the limiting case 𝜈 → 0+ . See [31] for more details and
applications of the GLC.
While only a few studies applied the logistic growth models to COVID-19 specific research questions,
only one combined the model with the use of the Moran index to show that the infection is spatially
dependent ([22]), with no studies for South African data. Some of these studies, which applied only
the logistic growth model include; 1) [32] who uses the logistic growth equation to describe the
process on a macroscopic level and 2) [33] who reviews the epidemic virus growth and decline curves
in China using the phenomenological logistic growth model.
Mathematical description of biological growth (i.e. population models) is very important in many
research disciplines. Amongst these population models, especially noteworthy are the clear analytical
solutions of the generalized logistic functions ([34]).

4. Results and Discussions
In this section, we start off with a general inspection on the provincial distribution of the total
confirmed and death cases given in Figures 3 and 4, respectively. From these figures it is observed that
the heatmaps of confirmed and death cases agree, and therefore more confirmed cases are followed
by more deaths. Furthermore, it is observed that the hotspots are Western Cape and Gauteng, with
the former the highest risk of infection.

South Arica.

Figure 4. The heat map of the provincial distribution of total deaths of COVID-19 up to 25 April in South Arica.

In order to test the spatial autocorrelation of COVID-19 in South Africa, the interaction between
provinces is estimated using Moran’s I from March 21, 2020 to April 25, 2020 based on absolute counts
by using Eq. (1) and the results are reported in Table 2.
Based on the adjacent 0-1 weight matrix, not all Moran coefficients are significant at the significance
level of 5% (see the fifth column in Table 2), and the values are around the interval of [0, 1], since
there is a positive correlation among the confirmed cases according to the geographical structure.
Comparatively, no significant spatial correlation is tested out based on spatial geographic distance
(the last column of Table 2), which indicates the spreading direction in South Africa is mainly based on
adjacent areas to neighbors, and doesn't matter how far the distance to the infectious center. So main
cities adjacent to are at higher risk.

To extend the analysis, we calculated the corresponding p-values of Moran's test given by Table 2 over
the time, shown in Figure 5. Comparing the corresponding p-values of Moran's test, some deviation
exist in the statistical timeliness in main cities of provinces from March 21, 2020 to April 25 so it is
inevitable that maybe bias occurred in our results. From April 20 to 25, the spatial autocorrelation is
significantly different in terms of adjacency to main cities. This means that the prevalence of COVID19 varies in main cities.

counts.

Figure 6. The difference between Moran's observed and expected values given by Table 2 over the time, on the
basis of the absolute counts.

Additional analysis has been taken into account to validate the results based on the Moran index
characteristics. The observed Moran index along with its expected value and standard error are
tabulated in Table 3. The expected value of Moran index is -1/(N-1)=-1/8=-0.125 in our case. Using
the adjacency weights, we obtain the same result as discussed based on Table 2. However, since the
null hypothesis that there is no spatial autocorrelation between the provinces is not rejected for the
geographical distance, we can argue there is no evidence of negative auto-correlation here, as with
random data you would expect it to be a negative value more often than positive.
The impact of President Cyril Ramaphosa’s decision in containing the outbreak by strict lockdown
regulations is supported by the p-values in Figure 6 (see dates 20 April and onwards).
In addition, the spatial autocorrelation of COVID-19 in South Africa based on the relative counts, has
been estimated using I from March 21, 2020 to April 25, 2020, and the results are reported in Table 3.
In this table, for the adjacent 0-1 weights, more coefficients are significant at the level of 5% (see the
fifth column in Table 4), with values in the interval [0, 1], since there is no positive correlation among
the confirmed cases according to the geographical structure. Comparatively, very few significant
spatial correlations are measured based on the spatial geographic distance (the last column of Table
3), which indicates that the spread direction in South Africa is mainly based on adjacent areas to
neighbours, and less so on the distance to the infection centre. In conclusion, as it is identified in
heatmaps Figures 3 and 4 the two main cities are at higher risk.

We also calculated the corresponding p-values of Moran's test given by Table 3 over the time, shown
in Figure 7.

Comparing the corresponding p-values of Moran's test, some deviation exist in the statistical
timeliness in main cities of provinces from March 21, 2020 to April 25 so it is inevitable that bias occurs
in the results. April 20 to 25 is not significantly different in terms of adjacency to main cities. This
means that the prevalence of COVID-19 based on relative counts, is the similar in the main cities.

Figure 7. The corresponding p-values of Moran's test given by Table 4 over the time, according to the relative
counts (absolute counts divided by 1M residents).

Figure 8. The difference between Moran's observed and expected values given by Table 2 over the time, according
to the relative counts.

Figure 9 displays observed cumulative confirmed cases, the fitted logistic growth model given by Eq.
(2) with ν=1 and the corresponding 95% confidence interval for each province. However, the model in
Eq. (2) was not fitted on the data associated with the WC province. As it is seen from Figure 9, the
cumulative number of confirmed cases in all provinces is described very well by a logistic growth
model. The high values of the R-Squared, shown at the bottom-right of each figure, also confirms the
goodness of fit of all 8 models, with FS having the lowest R-Square (0.939). Hence, we can rely on
predictions given as red lines until June 5 proportionally to the magnitude of the given R-Squared for
each province.

5. Conclusions
Despite the inaccuracies associated with medical predictions, identifying hot spots and logistic
modelling is still invaluable for better understanding of the spread in South Africa. The results of the
Moran index showed the impact of President Cyril Ramaphosa’s decision in containing the outbreak
by strict lockdown regulations and the inter provisional travelling prohibition has a positive role in
tapering the counts. The results indicated that the spreading direction in South Africa is mainly based
on adjacent areas to neighbours, and doesn’t matter how far the distance is to the infectious centre.
The logistic growth models show a good fit to the provincial data, with R-Square values above 0.9.
Visually however it is clear that for certain provinces a different modelling strategy could yield even
better results ([36]). These provinces are GP, FS and NC and likely also WC.
With South Africa phasing out the lockdown as of the beginning of May, implementing the riskadjusted strategy and economic activity plan, South African will be seeing workers returning to their
workplace and COVID-19 cases are expected to increase. This initial study highlights the importance
of continued analysis and showcases the valuable input that can be obtained from these analyses
results.
