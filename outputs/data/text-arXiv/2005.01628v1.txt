Summary
Genetic mapping sprung in the last decade of the 20th century with the development of
statistical procedures putting classical models of genetic effects together with molecular
biology techniques. It eventually became clear that those models, originally developed
to serve other purposes, implied limitations at different stages of the analyses—
disclosing loci, measuring their effects and providing additional parameters for adequate
biological/medical interpretations. The present paper is aimed to ponder whether it is
realistic and worth to try and further amend classical models of genetic effects or it
proves more sensible to undertake alternative theoretical strategies instead. In order to
further feed into that debate, mathematical developments for gene-environment
interaction stemming from the classical models of genetic effects are here revised and
brought up-to-date with the prospects present-day available data bestow, particularly in
the context of precision medicine. Those developments strengthen the methodology
required to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic.

Introduction
Steps forward in scientific progress are often accompanied with expectations beyond
objective appraisal. Quantitative trait locus experiments rose thirty years back and
substantial resources were since soon after expectantly invested for elucidating genetic
architectures of traits of economical importance (see e.g. Rifkin, 2012). In turn, the
latest decade witnessed a swift switch of major efforts to aid livestock production and
plant breeding towards genomic prediction (see e.g. Gondro et al., 2013). Initially
developed for model species, genetic mapping of human traits became stunningly
possible at the beginning of the current century by means of The International HapMap
Project (International HapMap, 2003) and genome-wide association studies (GWAS;
see e.g. Gondro et al., 2013) but, similarly, its potential for dissecting the genetic basis
of diseases is already openly questioned nowadays (see e.g. Teperino, 2020a).
In this context, the first half of the title of the present paper, “Gene-environment
interaction in the era of precision medicine”, has been stolen from a recent paper in

which bottlenecks of classical models of genetic effects and of their use in genetic
mapping are discussed (Li et al., 2019). That paper echoes the message that techniques
using conventional genetic models do often not provide insightful enough results and
that, in particular, they provided hitherto no clear-cut evidence on whether disease
etiologies are due to rare alleles with strong effects or to common alleles with weak
effects. More to the point, that paper includes a simulation by means of which certain
genetic models are shown not to be able to capture the complexity of the realistic
underlying factors of a disease—particularly, involving epistatic effects (gene
interactions, i.e., departures from the sum of the marginal contributions of the effects of
the genes involved).
Further on, the aforementioned paper (Li et al., 2019) provides a probabilistic approach
consisting on a Bayesian framework to hierarchically model gene-environment
interaction, leading to a population-dependent index C called the genetic coefficient of
the disease (at a population)—“a large C indicates large distinguishability of case
genomes from control genomes”. Then the paper illustrates the performance of the
proposed methodology using a built-up example in which the disease susceptibility is
by default very low (0.01) and it significantly increases due to either environmental
(exposure) or genetic (risk allele) factors or both, to 0.4, 0.5 and 0.9, respectively. That
case is hereafter referred to as the risk and exposure (RAE) case (see Table 1). With an
exposure frequency of 0.24 and a frequency of the risk allele of 0.15, Li et al. (2019)
report the genetic coefficient of the disease of the RAE case to be C=0.79.
Gene-environment interaction within the framework of the classical models
About half a dozen years earlier, Ma et al. (2012) had provided a model of geneenvironment interaction based on the NOIA model of genetic effects (Álvarez-Castro
and Carlborg, 2007), thus stemming from the classical models. In these models, the
parameter 2α can be used to reflect the “difference between the additive expectations of
case genomes and control genomes”, thus providing an alternative measure for Li et
al.’s (2019) genetic coefficient of the disease, C. Assuming then Hardy-Weinberg
proportions at the risk allele locus and equal risk of heterozygotes and homozygotes for
the risk allele (since not explicitly specified otherwise in that paper), Ma et al.’s (2012)
model can be used to compute a difference between the additive expectations of case
genomes and control genomes of 2α=0.85 (or, to be more precise, 2αG=0.85, using Ma
et al.’s (2012) specific notation). The departure between this value and Li et al.’s (2019)
genetic coefficient of the disease, C=0.79, could be due to the choices needed to be
made above in relation with dominance and the Hardy-Weinberg proportions.
Besides the aforementioned statistical formulation of genetic effects, both NOIA
(Álvarez-Castro and Carlborg, 2007) and Ma et al.’s (2012) extension of it to geneenvironment interaction entail a so-called functional formulation. Whereas the statistical
formulation is population-referenced and thus its parameters reflect properties of
populations, the functional formulation is individual-referenced and thus its parameters
reflect plane effects of substitutions from a reference class (a genotype at an
environment) to the others. Applying that functional formulation from the default (nonexposed and non-risk) individual reference (0.01), the additive, dominance,
environment, additive-by-environment and dominance-by-environment effects
reflecting the aforementioned substitutions are 0.245, 0.245, 0,39, 0.005 and 0.005,
respectively (see Table 2). Those values show that, although Li et al.’s (2019) RAE case

entails both genetic and environmental effects, it can hardly be considered a geneenvironment interaction case as intended, since the gene-environment interaction effects
are extremely small relative to both the genetic and the environmental marginal
contributions—the interaction effects actually lay about two orders of magnitude below
the marginal effects.
Hitherto, it has been shown that relatively recent implementations of the classical
models not only enable the analysis of the RAE case built up by Li et al. (2019) to
illustrate their theoretical proposals but are also adequate to easily and precisely
quantify basic properties of that case itself, which have apparently been missed by those
authors. More generally speaking, theoretical developments stemming from the classical
models are not always fairly acknowledged. To this regard it is at this point worth
adding up that both NOIA (Álvarez-Castro and Carlborg, 2007) and Ma et al.’s (2012)
extension of it to gene-environment interaction can properly deal with departures not
only from complete dominance but also from Hardy-Weinberg proportions, which were
assumed above only due to the absence of any explicit specifications of departures from
those features.
Nevertheless, the general warning Li et al. (2019) post on the use of genetic models still
holds—the current state-of-the-art of implementations of classical models of genetic
effects, whether unfairly acknowledged or not, keeps on leaving room for further
improvement. Indeed, the original NOIA proposal fails to properly account for
nonrandom associations of marginal genotypic frequencies (i.e., assumes linkage
equilibrium between/among the loci involved) and Ma et al.’s (2012) inherits that
limitation in what regards associations between genotypes and environments (i.e., geneenvironment correlations). Thus, those models shall hereafter be referred to as APNOIA
(associations-pending NOIA) developments. Incidentally, it is imperative to overcome
that limitation both because correlations between/among marginal frequencies may
occur in populations and because they are in any case likely to achieve significant levels
in the actual samples used in real data analyses.
A further improved classical model of gene-environment interaction
Opportunely, it is hereafter shown that the downsides of the APNOIA developments of
gene-environment interaction can be fixed. Indeed, new mathematical developments for
studying gene-environment interaction are provided right below in which geneenvironment correlation is properly implemented. Since the resulting theoretical
proposal overcomes the aforementioned associations-pending limitation, it shall be
referred as ARNOIA (associations-resolved NOIA).
A biallelic locus A (with alleles A1 and A2) and two environmental instances (E1 and
E2) of an environmental variable E are initially considered. This setting leads to six
possible classes—combinations of genotypes and environments—and thus to six
phenotypic expectations (e.g. six values of disease susceptibility). Those values are
gathered in the column-vector of genotypic values, G = (Gijk), where the subscripts
indicate genotype AjAk at environment Ei.
The genotypic values can be expressed in terms of genetic effects by means of
regression model

G = Nµ µ + Ne e + Nα α + Nδ δ + Nαe αe + δe, (expression 1)
in which the explanatory variables are the mean phenotype µ, the environmental effect,
e = υ1 = (e1, e2)T (where T stands for the transpose operation), the genetic additive
effect, α = υ2 = (α1, α2)T, the dominance effect, δ = υ3 = (δ11, δ12, δ22)T, and the additiveby-environment effect, αe = υ4 = (αe11, αe12, αe21, αe22)T, and the residual term is the
dominance-by-environment effect, δe = η4 = (δeijk).
Let 1(m) be a column vector of length m with all its scalars equal to 1, I(n) an identity
2 1 0 T
matrix of dimension n, N =�
� and ⊗ the Kronecker product. Then, the design
0 1 2
matrices in expression (1) can be expressed as

Nµ = 1(6), Ne = N1 = I (2) ⨂1(3), Nα = N2 = 1(2) ⨂𝐍𝐍 , Nδ = N3 = 1(2) ⨂I(3) and Nαe = N4 =
I (2) ⨂N. (expression 2)

Regression (1) with design matrices (2) is meant to be solved sequentially, as follows.
Let the population frequencies be pijk and let P be the diagonal matrix of those
frequencies, P=diag(pijk). Then, the mean phenotype is µ = Σpijk Gijk, the mean-corrected
vector of genotypic values is η0 = G – 1(6)µ and the expressions for the remaining
explanatory variables and the residual term of regression (1) come from computing, for
l=1 to 4,
� 𝑙𝑙 ηl-1 and ηl = Ml ηl-1, (expression 3)
υl =𝐇𝐇
−1

� 𝑙𝑙 = �𝐍𝐍𝑙𝑙T 𝐏𝐏𝐍𝐍𝑙𝑙 � 𝐍𝐍𝑙𝑙T 𝐏𝐏 and Ml = I(6) – Nl𝐇𝐇
� 𝑙𝑙 .
with 𝐇𝐇

In order to fully integrate the present theoretical proposal within the aforementioned
NOIA framework (Álvarez-Castro and Carlborg, 2007), regression (1) has to be
expressed in the form of a standardized statistical formulation. Such formulation is
G = S E, (expression 4)

where E = (µ, α, δ, e, αe, δe)T is the vector of genetic/environmental effects and S can
be obtained via its inverse, S-1, whose rows are: the first one is (pijk), as it can be derived
from µ = Σpijk Gijk; the second one comes from α = ( α2 – α1 ); the third one from δ = δ12
– (( δ11 + δ22 ) / 2 ); the fourth one from e = e2 – e1; the fifth one from αe = ( αe11 – αe12
– αe21 + αe22 ) and the sixth one is ( ½, –1, ½, –½, 1, –½ ).
Using previous extensions of classical models of genetic effects (Alvarez-Castro and
Crujeiras, 2019; Álvarez-Castro and Yang, 2011), the ARNOIA regression framework
for gene-environment interaction developed right above can be extended to several
possibly multiallelic loci, arbitrary epistasis, arbitrary departures from linkage
equilibrium and simultaneously to several environmental variables with multiple
environmental instances, with nonrandom associations (i.e., correlations) of
environmental variables and of genotypes and environments. The details of such
extensions are though out of the scope of this paper.

How much of an improvement?
For illustrating the advantage ARNOIA confers over the APNOIA shoulders it stands
on (the ones of Álvarez-Castro and Carlborg, 2007; Ma et al., 2012), Figure 1A shows
the additive, dominance and environmental effects (with dashed, dotted and solid lines,
respectively) of the RAE case worked out above (see also Table 2). Ma et al.’s (2012)
model provides—along the whole range of possible correlations between the risk allele
and environmental exposure—the effects that fit to the random association scenario
(gray horizontal lines), whereas ARNOIA (black lines) shows how those parameters
actually change with negative (to the left of zero) and positive (to the right) riskexposure correlations. Roughly, the effects decrease and increase with negative and
positive correlations, respectively, although a slight decrease of the additive effect
towards the maximum positive correlations and a bit of a more capricious behavior of
the dominance effect for intermediate positive correlations can also be noticed. The
thick vertical line marks the point of random association (i.e., no correlation) where all
values provided by APNOIA type Ma et al.’s (2012) model are correct and meet the
ones provided by ARNOIA (particularly, by expression 4). The values of all the effects
as computed at that point are provided in Table 2.
In view of Figure 1A, it could seem that settling for the relatively simpler APNOIA
formulae (not accounting for nonrandom associations of genes and environments) by
Ma et al. (2012) would not come with a high cost. Indeed, values that are correct for
circumstances known beforehand (precisely, nonrandom associations) are retrieved
regardless the nonrandom associations involved. However, that is but a mirage for such
a restriction shall, on the one hand, compromise the flexibility of the model for making
predictions, as illustrated further below, and, on the other hand, make the models to be
less efficient in disclosing genetic architectures, as explained hereafter.
It is well known that interactions (of any kind, including gene-environment interaction
or just dominance) may make lower level effects (like environmental effects or genetic
additive effects) vanish under certain circumstances (possibly, given the
genetic/environmental composition of an experimental sample). This is unfortunately
not always properly taken into account. Such is the case, for instance, of a
commendable review on models of gene-environment interaction in the context of plant
breeding by Malosetti et al. (2013). Although the approaches there considered are not so
genetic-effects grounded as NOIA (whether APNOIA or ARNOIA), they also found a
sequential strategy like the one proposed above within expressions (1-3) to be most
adequate. However, they overstepped the mark when specifically proposing a
conditional sequential procedure, by claiming that “dominance effects should be tested
conditioned on the additive effects present in the model.” Since effects on the phenotype
may (as further illustrated below) cancel out in average at the group of individuals under
study because of the interactions in which they are involved, and thus become likely to
be missed in mapping experiments, unveiling interactions becomes doubly imperative
rather than something to subject to the condition of first having found their lower-order
effects.
Thus, the theoretical genetic/environment models and the estimation strategies used
must become as flexible and thorough as possible in order to address the difficulty of
dealing with possibly masked effects. It is then necessary in the first place to
opportunely implement such models with interaction effects, as thoroughly recalled by

Li et al. (2019). But since interactions are particularly elusive, it is also crucial to
improve the flexibility of the models concerning the frequencies of the sample—
specifically, concerning the departures of the frequencies of the sample from
equilibrium situations like Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, linkage equilibrium and
random associations of genes and environments. Indeed, Ma et al. (2012) reasonably
stress that their proposal implements—as an improvement from previous geneenvironment interaction models—arbitrary departures from Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium.
In what follows, a case of actual gene-environment interaction is considered. It is a case
of (genetic) risk to (environmental) exposure (thus referred to hereafter as RTE), where
the risk allele increases disease susceptibility only when combined with exposure, hence
actually interacting with the environment. Thus described, the interaction behaves as a
switch—the environmental effect shall either be switched on (when carrying the risk
allele) or turned off (otherwise). Table 1 provides the details of the RTE case. Table 2
further shows that the functional additive and dominance effects (i.e., the marginal
genetic effects) of this case from the reference of the individual default class (no genetic
risk and no exposure) are zero, which actually is in accordance with the genetic risk
being turned off in the absence of exposure. In Table 2 it is further shown that geneinteraction effects are large, which implies that the marginal genetic effects are not nil
in absolute terms—they would show up from alternative references. In fact, still in
Table 2, statistical (population-reference) marginal genetic effects are shown to be
different from zero.
For a broader scope, Figure 1B shows all the genetic/environmental effects of the
system as obtained using ARNOIA, with the marginal effects displayed as in Figure 1A
and the gene-environment interaction effects in gray. The marginal genetic effects of the
RTE case are small in the absence of gene environment correlation. Indeed, this case
entails a visual example of a warning issued above since it illustrates that marginal
effects approach zero as an occasional outcome (of a particular set of population
frequencies), making it tricky to spot them in a mapping experiment. The trouble
vanishes though as long as the (larger) gene-environment interaction effects are
inspected (despite the apparent absence of marginal genetic effects) and disclosed. Note
also that although the marginal genetic effects get closer to zero under certain negative
correlations (towards the far left end of the graph), the additive-by-environment
interaction effect increases accordingly. Thus, in any case, eventually out-of-reach
marginal effects may be unveiled by diligently fishing interaction effects.
Overall, for properly detecting marginal (genetic and environmental) and interaction
(gene-gene and gene-environment) effects (and, therefore, identify their corresponding
loci and environmental variables) in mapping experiments it is essential that the genetic
models entail not only any interactions between/among the effects themselves but also
any departures from equilibrium genotype/environment frequencies, as Figure 1 shows
ARNOIA to accomplish. Moreover, it is hereafter illustrated that the advantages of
ARNOIA are crucial also for using detected genetic and environment underlying factors
of traits in the formulation of predictions, particularly in the context of precision
medicine.

Predictions under diminishing exposure
Figure 2A shows the genetic coefficient of the disease sensu Li et al. (2019) for the
RAE case. As mentioned above, in the context of the developments stemming from the
classical models of genetic effects such coefficient is given by the parameter 2α. On top
of the variables already considered in Figure 1A, Figure 2A has one dimension added
for enabling predictions in the context of a hypothetical decrease of the environmental
exposure. The black solid line in Figure 2A marks random association and shows that
the genetic coefficient of the disease is simply not affected by decreasing the exposure
frequency in the population. This is as expected under lack of interplay between gene an
environment (i.e., no interaction and to correlation). Indeed, although the trait is subject
to both genetic and environmental influence, as long as there is no (or very little)
interplay between them, the genetic parameter remains virtually constant in the face of
variations in the environmental exposure.
However, as already shown above in relation with Figure 1 (where the additive genetic
effect, α, was shown instead of the slightly different genetic coefficient of the disease,
2α), such interplay may come not only by means of gene-environment interaction but
also through gene-environment correlation. Thus and so, whereas the genetic coefficient
of the disease remains constant in Figure 2A against diminishing exposure in the
absence of significant gene-environment interaction, it is in point of fact affected by
risk-exposure correlations. In particular, the genetic coefficient of the disease decreases
with negative associations, as the surface to the left of the black line shows, and it
increases for positive associations up to a maximum followed by a slight decrease, to
the right of the black line (likewise the additive effect, α, in Figure 1A). Note also that
the range of risk-exposure associations narrows down as the exposure frequency
approaches zero, which explains the tip of the surface at the end of the black line.
In Figure 2B, the RTE case of Figure 1B is resumed and further extended in a way
analogous to Figure 2A from Figure 1A. As Figure 2B shows, for the RTE case the
genetic coefficient of the disease approaches zero for decreasing values of exposure
under random association of risk and environment (decreasing black line). That
coefficient also decreases—also down to zero—for decreasing (increasingly negative)
association between the risk allele and environmental exposure, as the left tip of the
surface shows. In plain language, the figure shows that the problem of increased disease
susceptibility of the carriers of the risk allele may be equally reduced (and eventually
removed) either by reducing exposure for the whole population or by restricting the
access to the exposed environment only for the risk population, or even trough any
intermediate alternative (any reduction of the exposure in the population biased towards
the carriers of risk alleles). The optimal management would then depend just upon the
reluctance of the average individual to avoid the exposed environment (or even the
actual feasibility of bringing the whole population out of it) and the cost of tests to
detect the risk allele, which would enable personalized warnings.
Overall, the two cases considered in Figure 2 deal with rather singular—either virtually
absent, RAE, or switch-type, RTE—instances of gene-environment interaction, for
which some predictions would be feasible even without mathematical modeling. The
results obtained using ARNOIA not only reassuringly agree with the conceptually
attainable predictions but also further illustrate how to precisely quantify any desired

genetic/environmental parameter, which can hereinafter be applied to more complex
real cases of interest undergoing less intuitive behaviors.
Road work ahead
Because affordable data is an ever-changing variable, it is sensible to assume that,
likewise, theoretical models required in the analyses shall need to keep on being worked
out every now and then. In this context, it is as essential to make the best possible use of
the models available at a particular time-spot as it is to point out in which way they are
at that time imposing limitations in the analyses. For instance, as Li et al. (2019) have
claimed, it is fundamental to interiorize the importance of epistasis as, e.g., Huang et al.
(2012) showed. But then Li et al. (2019) are also implicitly acknowledging that “model
insufficiency” was not so severe as to preclude the crucial importance of epistasis in
genetic architectures to be inferred. More to the point, an elusive implementation of
models of genetic interactions (epistasis)—even claimed to be beyond reach—has
recently been developed, enabling genetic interaction and genotype frequencies
correlation (linkage disequilibrium) to be disentangled (Alvarez-Castro and Crujeiras,
2019). Analogous achievements are provided in this communication in what regards
gene-environment interaction and gene-environment correlation, as discussed hereafter.
In what is currently understood as the, at least relative, “failure of GWAS” (Teperino,
2020b), gene-environment interaction is also pointed out as a key factor. Indeed, the
importance of gene-environment interaction in human health has been stressed in
relation with a broad spectrum of disorders ranging from obesity and other metabolic
disorders through autoimmune diseases to cancer (e.g. Cust, 2020; Teperino, 2020a).
What is then necessary in order to move forward? Concerning the theoretical models
involved in data analyses, developments enabling gene-environment interaction and
gene-environment correlation to be properly disentangled have especially been
demanded. As a recent example within the field of precision medicine, particularly in
the context of mental health, Assary et al. (2020) have advocated that “Identifying
which form of gene-environment interplay contributes to a particular disorder or
behavior is absolutely crucial in order to select suitable intervention efforts” because
theoretical developments that enable a joint analysis of both phenomena are needed in
particular for “ensuring that the outcomes of one do not bias the effects of the other”.
This paper meets that demand and it does so by providing a theoretical framework that,
as mentioned above, simultaneously addresses many other genetic facts of relevance
(like epistasis, multiple alleles and departures from genetic equilibria like HardyWeinberg equilibrium and linkage equilibrium). Thus, more to the point, the ARNOIA
model here provided illustrates the possibilities of mathematical developments
stemming from the classical models of genetic effects in what regards their potential to
keep on being improved and address eventual demands to come. In other words, no
evidence seems to support that the machinery here proven useful to fix inconvenient
potholes of the classical models road could be inadequate for similar purposes in the
future.
The previous is however not to say that alternative roads should never be built. It looks
sensible in any case to assume that a new road will consume significant resources before
providing benefits comparable to the already existing ones, especially in what regards
the wealth of experience amassed in the use of them. Therefore, it would be reasonable

to first thoroughly inspect the possibilities of the existing roads to be fixed and as well
to guarantee the added value the new road is intended to bring. On top of that, it would
also make perfect sense to assume that the new road would only provide its best service
when adequately connected with the previous road network. Whenever developed along
these lines, alternative perspectives in genetic modeling could aim to open doors to
novel analyses and/or double check the already existing ones and thus enrich the
application of mathematical models in precision medicine.
As a final remark, it would be regrettable in the context of the current COVID-19
pandemic not to devote at least a few lines of this paper to the application of ARNOIA
to such a global threaten. The strong link between gene-environment interaction and
epidemiology has already been underscored in relation with the COVID-19 pandemic
(Rodriguez-Morales et al., 2020). It thus becomes worth making it crystal clear in the
first place that ARNOIA is certainly suitable not only for the trait considered in the
examples above (disease susceptibility), but also for additional traits of relevance within
the field of epidemiology, including for instance mortality caused by a disease. It is also
particularly useful to notice here that although virulence variability is underlain by
mutations (and thus conceptually related to genetics), ARNOIA may naturally integrate
the virus mutations simply as an environmental variable, since that is how they are
perceived from the perspective of the susceptible individuals—the genetic component of
the model. Bearing that in mind, it is easier to perceive why it is crucial, for the study of
COVID-19 as well, that ARNOIA considers together (but disentangled) geneenvironment interaction and gene-environment correlation. Indeed, the various
geographical regions affected by the disease do not only undergo different proportions
of virus strains (environmental component) but also different genetic backgrounds of
the susceptible individuals (genetic component), thus setting a gene-environment
correlation scenario in which gene-environment interaction needs to be properly
understood.

using APNOIA and ARNOIA (ultimately from expression 4), as explained in the text.
