Abstract
The outbreak of Covid-19 led the world to an unprecedent health and economical
crisis. In an attempt to responde to this emergency researchers worldwide are
intensively studying the Covid-19 pandemic dynamics. In this work, a SIRSi
compartmental model is proposed, which is a modification of the known classical
SIR model. The proposed SIRSi model considers differences in the immunization
within a population, and the possibility of unreported or asymptomatic cases.
The model is adjusted to three major cities of São Paulo State, in Brazil, namely,
São Paulo, Santos and Campinas, providing estimates on the duration and peaks
of the outbreak.
Keywords: Covid-19, Compartmental models, Equilibrium analysis,
Parameter fitting.

dealing with the outbreak. On 5th January 2020 WHO published the first outbreak news on the new virus. On 7th January the causative agent was identified
and named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
(WHO named the disease Covid-19). On 13th January 2020 the first case outside China was reported in Thailand. On 22nd January 2020 WHO stated
that there was evidence of human-to-human transmission, and approximately
seven weeks later, on 13th March 2020, WHO characterized the Covid-19 as a
pandemic [1, 2].
In Brazil, the first confirmed Covid-19 case was reported on the 26th February 2020, and up to 25th June 2020 there was 1,188,631 confirmed cases with
53,830 deaths [3]. Globally, according to [4] there was 9,292,202 confirmed cases,
and 479,133 deaths up to 25th June 20201.
Most cases are asymptomatic carriers and are spontaneously resolved, however, some developed various fatal complications, notably for patients with comorbidities [2], and, allied to the fastly spread of covid-19, the worldwide emergency state brings up with important, and yet unanswered, questions related to
the contagion dynamical behavior and its mitigation and control strategies. As
a result, strategies to contain the contagion such as social distancing, quarantine
and complete lockdown of areas have been studied [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
In Mexico, on 18th March 2020, the Mexican Health Secretariat reported
that the pandemic was going to last 90 days, with 250,656 expected cases. On
the next day, the Health Secretariat informed that approximately 9.8% (24,594)
of the cases would need hospitalization, and 4.2% (10,528) of the total cases
would be critical patients, needing intensive care. On the same date the number
of available Health Care units at that time was 4,291 with 2,053 ventilators [11].
The situation in Mexico led to the adoption of non-pharmaceutical interventions,
such as washing hands, social distancing, cough/sneeze etiquette, and so on.
In Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the social distancing started on 17 March 2020
[8], and the government of the state of São Paulo, Brazil, decreed quarantine on

23rd March 2020. Up to 25th June 2020, the State of São Paulo had 248,587
confirmed cases with 13,759 deaths.
One important question is related to the patient’s immunity after recovery.
The difference in immunity after recovery have been reported in humans in [12],
and in experiments with rhesus macaques [13]. The experiment in [12] collected
plasma from 175 Covid-19 recovered patients, and SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) were detected from day 10 to 15 after the onset of
the disease and remained thereafter. Nonetheless, the NAbs levels were variable
in the cohort, 52 (≈30%) of the patients developed low levels of these antibodies, from which with 10 (≈6% of the recovered patients) the NAbs levels were
undetectable, 25 (≈14%) developed high levels.
In [14] the data suggests that the response to SARS-CoV-2 is imbalanced regarding to controlling the virus replication versus the activation of the adaptive
immune response. In some cases the immune system doesn’t work properly and
lung cells remain vulnerable to infection. The virus continues replicating while
the immune response system attacks infected cells, killing even healthy nearby
cells, and the lung tissue becomes seriously inflamed. This seems to be the
mechanism that make some patients become severely ill weeks after their initial infection. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 probably induces immunity like other
coronaviruses, however, it is so new that this mechanism isn’t fully understood
[15].
The economic crisis due to the pandemics is another important issue. According to [16] the mortality rate of Covid-19 is not necessarily correlated with
the economic risk to global economy since governments, companies, consumers
and media reacted to the economic shock. However, a global recession seems to
be inevitable, its duration and intensity will depende on the success of measures
to prevent the spread of Covid-19.
Taking the whole scenario into account researchers worldwide are intensively
studying and developing mathematical models of the Covid-19 outbreak. The
knowledge on this pandemic dynamics is important for providing estimates on
the duration and peaks of the outbreak.

The macro-modelling of infectious disease spread have been a field of research
from many years since the simple deterministic model of Kermack and McKendrick [17, 18, 19, 20], that provides a dynamical model classifying individuals
in a population as Susceptible - Infected - Removed (SIR) [21]. A number of
classical models such as SIR [22] and Susceptible - Exposed - Infected - Removed
(SEIR) [23, 24] have been proposed for epidemic modelling.
In addition, works considering time delayed [25] and fractional order [26]
dynamical systems applied to Covid-19 outbreak have also been proposed.
In [27] a SIRD model had been adjusted to Covid-19 spreads in China, Italy
and France. The results have shown that the recovery rate were similar for the
situations of China, Itally and France. In [28], a mixed analytical-statistical
inverse problem is used to predict the Covid-29 progression in Brazil, a SIRU
model, where U stands for Unreported cases, was used for the direct problem,
and a mixture of parameter estimation with Bayesian inference for the inverse
problem analysis.
Compartmental models considering immigration and home isolation, or quarantine, are proposed on [10], all the situations presented infection-endemic equilibrium, the results demonstrated that home isolation, or lockdown, mitigates
the chance of infection.
In this work the proposed model is a modification of the original compartmental SIR model of Kermack and McKendrick [17, 18, 19], including a sick
(Sick ) population compartment representing nodes of the network that manifest
the symptoms of the disease. The proposed Susceptible - Infected - Removed Sick (SIRSi) model also considers the birth and death of individuals in the given
population. In addition, a feedback from those recovered who did not gain immunity or loss their immunity after a period of time and become susceptible
again is also introduced.
The proposed SIRSi model presents both a disease free and an endemic
equilibrium, and the influence of the re-susceptibility feedback is investigated
both analytically and numerically.
The parameters of the proposed SIRSi model are numerically fitted to the
4

epidemic situation for three cities of the São Paulo State, Brazil, namely, São
Paulo, the capital of the State; Santos, on the coast and approximately 80
Km away from São Paulo; and Campinas, in the interior of the state and approximately 90 Km distant from the capital São Paulo, providing estimates for
diagnosis and forecasting of the Covid-19 epidemics spread.
The paper is organized as follows, on section 2 the SIRSi compartmental
mathematical model is presented. The equilibrium points existence and stability
conditions are discussed in section 3, showing the possibility of both endemic
and disease-free equilibrium. The parameter fitting of the SIRSi model for the
cities of São Paulo, Santos and Campinas is shown in secton 4, and the numerical
experiments results in section 5. The concluding remarks can be seen in section
6.

2. A modified SIR model with birth and death cases
The proposed SIRSi model can be seen in Fig. 1. In this model, the susceptible population S is infected at a rate α when contact infected individuals
from I. The susceptible compartment also receives a population, at a rate 1/γ,
who didn’t gain complete immunity after recovering or who loss their immunity
after a period of time.
The compartment I represents the infectious population in incubation stage
prior the onset of symptoms. Infection transmission during this period has
been reported in [29, 30, 31, 32]. The infected population can be asymptomatic
or symptomatic. The period between infection and onset of symptoms, 1/β2 ,
ranges from 3 to 38 days with median of 5.2. Once the infected individual is
tested positive and the case is documented, the case is moved to the Sick compartment. Those who don’t develop severe symptoms become asymptomatic.
In [33] the estimative of the infections originated from undocumented cases
is as high as 86%, which include mild, limited and lack of symptoms infectious
individuals. In other recent studies [34, 35], it was found that, 20% - 40% of
positive tested patients were asymptomatic.

Figure 1: Epidemiological SIRSi model.

In this work, and according to [36], the asymptomatic population is considered as those of under-reporting cases. This population could be as 7 times
bigger than the size of the documented cases. This group, under-reporting cases,
become recovered with the period 1/β1 .
Some of the individuals within this population could eventually develop
symptoms. In [37], it has been reported that the average time between infection and the onset of symptoms can be 4.6 days. Once the case becomes
documented it should be moved to the Sick compartment. Sick are those infected which seek for medical attention with severe symptoms. This population
are those who tested positive for COVID-19. In [38] it was reported that this
population could represent up to 19.9% of the total documented cases, of which
13.8% are severe cases and 6.1% require intensive care. The sick population
become recovered with the period 1/β3 or removed at a rate σ (see Fig. 1).
In order to consider the social distancing measure effect in the number of
infected and deaths toll shown in Fig. 1, the parameter θ is introduced on
the mathematical model (1), where θ is subject to the constraint 0 < θ < 1.
Consequently, given these facts, the mathematical SIRSi model is given by (1),

6

Ṡ = λ − α(1 − θ)SI − δS + γR,
I˙ = α(1 − θ)SI − (β1 + β2 )I,

(1)

Ṡick = β2 I − (β3 + σ)Sick
Ṙ = β1 I + β3 Sick − (γ + δ)R
where λ and δ are the birth and death rates, respectively.
It is important to notice that the number of documented cases is a key
information that should emerge, somehow, from (1). The reason is the fact
that the accumulated number of confirmed cases is publicly available, and will
be used to fine-tuning the model. The number of daily new infections is also
available, but it tends to be noisy and less representative of the dynamics.

3. Disease-free and endemic equilibrium points
Considering (1), such that ẋ = f (x), where x = (S, I, Sick , R)T , x ∈ U ⊂

4
(R+
0 ) , f : U → U is the right-hand side of (1), and parameters α, β1 , β2 , β3 ,

σ, γ, θ ∈ R+ .

To investigate the influence of the introduction of the feedback from those

recovered with no immunity which become susceptible again, and dividing the
population into groups, the equilibrium points related to the model described
by (1) must be determined and their stability discussed.
Assuming α 6= 0, i.e., susceptible can be converted into infected, and despite

being an assumption it is realistic for a spreading disease, the equilibrium points
are such that f (x∗ ) = 0.
Using the Hartman-Grobman Theorem [39] the local stability of the equi-

librium points can be determined by the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix
∂f
computed on each equilibrium point. The Jacobian J =
of (1) is given
∂x x∗
by (2).

In the following the disease-free (section 3.1) and the endemic (section 3.2)
equilibrium points are determined.
3.1. Disease-free equilibrium points
The disease-free equilibrium is a state corresponding to the absence of infected individuals, i.e., I ∗ = 0. Applying this condition to the equilibrium of
(1), the point can be determined.
Assume that there exist a disease free-equilibrium (I ∗ = 0), x∗ ∈ U, such

∗
that f (x∗ ) = 0. This equilibrium point x∗ = (S ∗ , I ∗ , Sick
, R∗ )T with x∗ in the

first octant of R4 is given by:
∗
P1 = (S ∗ , I ∗ , Sick
, R∗ )T = (λ/δ, 0, 0, 0)T .

(3)

Considering P1 , the corresponding linear system Jacobian [39] JP1 =
is given by (4).

By the Laplace determinant development [40], the eigenvalues of (4) are the
elements in the diagonal, that is, ξ1 = −δ, ξ2 = α(1 − θ)(λ/δ) − (β1 + β2 ),

ξ3 = −(β3 + σ) and ξ4 = −(δ + γ).

The eigenvalues above with the Hartman-Grobman Theorem indicates that

(1) presents one disease-free equilibrium point, and considering the condition

8

given by the eigenvalue ξ2 = α(1 − θ)λ/δ − (β1 + β2 ), if α(1 − θ)λ/δ < (β1 + β2 )

the eigenvector associated indicates an asymptotically stable direction. Consequently, if α(1 − θ)λ/δ > (β1 + β2 ) the equilibrium point P1 is unstable,

indicating a bifurcation in the parameter space.
3.2. Endemic equilibrium points

The endemic equilibrium points are characterized by the existence of infected
people in the population, that is, (I ∗ 6= 0).

Therefore, assuming the existence of an endemic equilibrium point, with

∗ T
x ∈ U, such that f (x∗ ) = 0, the equilibrium point P2 = x∗ = (S ∗ , I ∗ , R∗ , Sick
)
∗

in the first octant of R4 is given by (6),

) ∈ R+ is given by (6).

Note that condition (6) reflects the fact that, in order to the endemic equilibrium exists, the rate α at which, the people flux rate, represented by λ/δ, become
infected, has to be greater than the rate at which infected population leave the
compartment I, either overcoming the disease or becoming symptomatic.
It is important to highlight that λ/δ could also represent the total people
flux commuting from a different city in a multi-population model.

The characteristic polynomial det(A − Id ξ) = 0 is

ξ 4 + a1 ξ 3 + a2 ξ 2 + a3 ξ + a4 = 0,

(8)

with

a1 =β3 + 2 δ + γ + σ + I ∗ α(1 − θ);
a2 =I ∗ α(1 − θ) (β1 + β2 + β3 + δ + γ + σ) + 2 δ (β3 + σ)+

a4 =I ∗ α(1 − θ) (β1 β3 δ + β2 β3 δ + β1 δ σ + β2 δ σ + β2 γ σ) .
Any further effort to analytically analyze ξ eigenvalues, becomes quite difficult due to the coefficients complexity. A possible alternative approach is to go
for numerical calculations.
However, some insight for the model with feedback γ can be obtained, in
terms of bifurcations and stability, if we analyze the eigenvalues when γ = 0
and γ 6= 0.
3.2.1. Eigenvalues for γ = 0
Note that in this case, the endemic equilibrium is still possible. Computing
the eigenvalues results,

ξ2 = − (β3 + σ),

such that ∆ = 4 δ (β1 + β2 ) + (α(1 − θ))2 λ2 − 4λα(1 − θ)(β1 + β2 )2 .

The eigenvalues ξ3 and ξ4 can be either complex conjugate stable, or both

real. The eigenvalue ξ3 needs to be further studied due to the possibility of
bifurcation.
Analysing the eigenvalue ξ3 , if α(1 − θ) λ >

quently (6) holds true.

On the other hand, if α(1 − θ) λ <

√
∆, P2 is stable, and conse-

√
∆, the endemic equilibrium point

is unstable, and the existence condition (6) is not satisfied, consequently, the
endemic equilibrium point P2 , if existing, is stable.
3.2.2. Eigenvalues for γ → ∞
Another insight can be obtained by looking with the case γ → ∞. In this

case, the endemic equilibrium becomes:

β1 + β2
,
α(1 − θ)
(β3 + σ)
[α(1 − θ)λ − (β1 + β2 )δ]

Sick
→
α(1 − θ)
S∗ =

(11)

R∗ → 0,
which is subject to the same existence condition given in equation (6).
Under the assumption γ → ∞, the characteristic polynomials coefficients in

equation (9) can be approximated by (12):

11

a1 ≈ γ,
a2 ≈ γ(I ∗ α(1 − θ) + β3 + δ + σ) = γb2 ,

(12)

a3 ≈ γ(I ∗ α(1 − θ) (β2 + β3 + σ) + δ(β3 + σ)) = γb3 ,
a4 = γI ∗ α(1 − θ)β2 σ = γb4 ,
the characteristic polynomial (8) can be rewritten as in (13):

ξ 4 + γξ 3 + γb2 ξ 2 + γb3 ξ + γb4 = 0,

(13)

ξ 4 + γ(ξ 3 + b2 ξ 2 + b3 ξ + b4 ) = 0,
assuming that at least one root |ξ| goes to infinity as γ → ∞, we rewrite the

polynomial as

ξ 4 + γξ 3 = 0,

(14)

ξ 3 (ξ + γ) = 0,
then,
ξ1 = −γ, and γ → ∞,
so, one eigenvalue seem to be going to −∞ as γ → ∞. To find an approximation
to the other three roots, the characteristic polynomial is rewritten in equation
(13). It can be also assumed that the other three roots are finite,

ξ 4 + γξ 3 + γb2 ξ 2 + γb3 ξ + γb4 = 0,
1 4
ξ + ξ 3 + b2 ξ 2 + b3 ξ + b4 = 0,
γ

(15)

≈ ξ 3 + b2 ξ 2 + b3 ξ + b4 = 0.
Looking for insight numerical experiments are performed.
4. Parameters fitting by the least-squares method
In this section the parameters of the proposed SIRSi model (1) (see Fig. 1)
are numerically adjusted to fit the curve for confirmed symptomatic infected
12

cases of three major cities in the state of São Paulo - Brazil, using public available data from the State Data Analysis System - SEADE (Sistema Estadual de
Análise de Dados 2 ). The total population for the cities was obtained from the
same source and it is shown in table 1.

Table 1: Total population collected from SEADE.

To calculate birth and death rates, λ and δ respectively, linear interpolation
was necessary, as the data from the public repository was out of date, results
are shown in Fig. 2.

Figure 2: Birth and death rates per 1000 inhabitants for São Paulo, Santos and Campinas.
Public data is shown in solid lines and interpolated values are shown in dashed lines.

One of the first actions against the spread of the virus was the imposition
of a social distancing measure which was first decreed in São Paulo on May
17. This intervention, represented by θ in the model, focuses on reducing the
2 https://www.seade.gov.br/

13

possible contact between infected and susceptible individuals, so it is introduced
as a factor of the transmission rate, i.e. α(1 − θ). The time series corresponding
to the daily measures of this index along with their mean for each one of the

cities considered are shown in figure 3. Although this time variation resembles
a 7-day periodic function, especially on the second half of the register, we use
as a first approximation the mean of this measure as a representative value.

Figure 3: Percentage of social distancing [41].

By the time we write, there is no much of information about the duration
of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2, however what it is known so far is
that protection after recovery wanes over time. Recent research highlight that
immune response and antibodies protection after recovery may depend on the
14

severity of the infection, in some cases this protection can last for as little as 12
weeks while in others few cases no antibodies protection is obtained at all [42,
43, 44, 45, 46, 47]. To assess the influence of this behavior on the disease spread,
we set the feedback parameter γ at constant values γ ∈ {0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04}

in order to map possible scenarios especially those related to possible second
waves of infection.
The transmission rate of symptomatic individuals prior hospitalization is

estimated between 1.12 to 1.19 while for asymptomatic cases this rate ranges
between 0.1 to 0.6, in model (1) this parameter is represented by the product
α(1 − θ), thus, we let α ∈ [0.1, 1.0]. The mean time between infection and onset-

of-symptoms for confirmed cases, 1/β2 , is 2 days, thus we let β2 ∈ [0.1, 0.6]. The
time from onset-of-infection to fully recovery, 1/β1 , is considered to be between

a few days up to two weeks (5 to 15 days). The period of time it takes for
a symptomatic patient to overcome the disease, 1/β3 , and the time between
hospitalization to death, 1/σ, are both considered to be between 5 to 20 days
[48, 37, 38, 49].
The trust-region reflective least-squares algorithm [50, 51, 52] along with a
4th-order Runge-Kutta integrator were used to fit parameters in model (1) to
actual data collected from public repositories for each one of the three cities into
consideration. All parameters and initial conditions computed are normalized
with respect to the total population in each case. For the fitting, we set S0 ∈

[0, 1], I0 ∈ [0, 1] with initial guess S0i = 99.9% and I0i = 0.1%, the initial

condition for Sick and R was set to zero. Results are shown in tables 2 to 7,
and the temporal evolution of the Sick compartment for each city, for both, the
fitted model and the public data, is show in figures 6, 8 and 10.

In order to assess the influence of the parameter γ in the endemic equilibrium,
the eigenvalues were plotted for the set of fitted parameters found, for γ ∈ [0, 2).

In figures 4 are shown the eigenvalues for the endemic equilibrium for each city

computed for each one of the fitted sets. At γ = 0 eigenvalues are stable for
São Paulo e Santos, as γ increases, eigenvalues move towards the left-hand side
of the complex plane, whereas for Campinas eigenvalues are unstable for γ = 0.

5. Numerical experiments
In this section the numerical experiments are conducted using the MATLABSimulink [53] for two different conditions. Firstly, the SIRSi model is fitted with
the real data for the Sicks population, and for different values of the parameter
γ. In the sequence, the simulation for the infected population I, that can be
inferred from the proposed model, is carried out.

Figure 4: Eigenvalues for γ ∈ {0, 0.1}, for the three cities into consideration.

The numerical experiments, as in section 4, were conducted for three major
cities in the state of São Paulo, namely, São Paulo, Campinas, and Santos.
The initial condition is x0 = (S0 , I0 , Sick0 , R0 )T , where S0 and I0 are the
normalized susceptible and infected populations, which are considered free parameters in the sense that they can be modified by the fitting algorithm.
5.1. Simulation results for São Paulo
In Fig.6 it can be seen that the SIRSi model is adjusted for the confirmed
cases of infected people data.
Considering that the acquired immunity is permanent, i.e., γ = 0, and that
the isolation rate is constant, the peak of the infection occurs soon after July
2020, and until the end of the the same year, the disease will not persist, since
the number of confirmed cases will go down to zero.

On the other hand, assuming that immunity is not permanent and adopting
a reinfection rate γ = 0.01, meaning that every 100 days a recovered person
becomes susceptible again, the model predicts a decrease in the confirmed cases
and a new wave of infection in the first half of 2022.
Decreasing the time interval to 50 days in which a recovered person becomes
susceptible (γ = 0.02), the model indicates a second wave of infection in the
first half of 2021. For the situation in which a recovered system is susceptible
to each 25 days (γ = 0.04), the model simulation shows that by the end of this
year the number of confirmed infected will reduce by almost two thirds and that
the number of infected will continue decreasing over time, but the number of
confirmed cases will remain higher than the other simulated curves.
In Fig.7, the infected compartment I inferred from the SIRSi model is presented, showing that the peak of infection is close to July 2020.

Increasing γ will reduce the time for a recovered person to become susceptible again, causing the peaks in Fig. 7 to increase, when compared to the
curves for lower values of γ. This behavior, however, cannot be observed in
Fig.6, indicating that the increase the re-susceptibility feedback gain γ possibly
contributes to the increase of asymptomatic or unreported infected cases.
In addition, it appears that if those recovered acquire permanent immunity
γ = 0, the number of infected people tends to zero by the end of 2020. For
γ = 0.01, it appears that there is a small increase in January 2022. For γ = 0.02
a new wave of confirmed cases can be seen in Fig.6, and accordingly, the increase
in the infected population is also observed in Fig.7.
For São Paulo, the numerical experiments show that considering any reinfection rate, there will be confirmed infected cases and unreported infected cases

5.2. Simulation results for Santos
Fig.8 shows the SIRSi model adjusted to the confirmed cases of infected
people data for Santos. Assuming that the immunity acquired is permanent,
γ = 0, and that the isolation rate is constant, the peak of the confirmed cases in
Santos will occur very close to July 2020. and similarly to São Paulo (see Fig.
6), until the end of the same year, the disease will not persist with the number
of confirmed cases going down to zero.
Adopting a nonzero reinfection rate, such that one person every 100 days
becomes susceptible again (γ = 0.01), a second wave of infection is seen in the
coastal city around July 2021, one year before the second wave predicted for

São Paulo with the same value for the re-susceptibility feedback gain γ.
Considering γ = 0.02, for which an infected person becomes susceptible
again in a time interval of 50 days, the second wave of confirmed cases occurs
at the beginning of the first half of 2021 and the number of confirmed infected
is reduced to one third of the peak value.
These situations should be analyzed with caution and it is suggested to study
the influence of the flow of people between these cities, since in the city of Santos
the second waves of infections occur before the city of São Paulo.
For γ = 0.04, after the peak of the confirmed cases, a second wave can be
observed in the numerical results before the end of 2020, delaying the reduction
of the confirmed cases.
For Santos, the numerical experiments show that for γ = 0 and for γ = 0.03,
the numbers of confirmed cases tend to zero in the beginning of 2023.

Figure 9: Time evolution for infected population in Santos.

The increase in re-susceptibility feedback gain γ, will reduction the time for
an infected person to be susceptible again, causing higher peaks when compared
with the curves for lower values of γ. This behavior does not occur in Fig.8
indicating that the increase in feedback possibly contributes to the increase in
asymptomatic or unreported infected cases. This situation is similar to what is
observed for São Paulo.
In addition, for γ = 0, the number of the infected people I tends to zero
before the end of the 2020 (see the curve for γ = 0 in Fig.9).
For γ = 0.01, a new wave of infection in 2021 can be seen, and for γ = 0.02
the peak of the second wave of infection is near January 2021 (see Fig.9, γ = 0.01
and γ = 0.02).

23

Unlike São Paulo, the highest peak of infection among the unreported occurs
when γ = 0.03 and this behavior suggests a more detailed study of the dynamics, because together with the situation in which the infected person acquires
permanent immunity , these rates suggest that the saving of confirmed cases
(see Fig.8 and asymptomatic infected individuals tends to zero more quickly.
In the situation in which a recovered person is liable to a new susceptibility
in 25 days, it is observed that the infection persists in the population for a
longer time, as shown by the curve with γ = 0.04 in Fig.9 and justifies the
policy strategies public policies, including vaccination.

Figure 10: Time evolution for confirmed cases (sick population) in Campinas.

For permanent acquired immunity, γ = 0, and constant isolation rate, the
24

peak of confirmed infection cases occur in the beginning of the second half of
2020.
Considering the re-susceptibility feedback gain γ > 0, in Fig. 10, it seems
that with the increasing of γ the time necessary for the number of confirmed
infected cases go down to zero is slightly bigger, unlike the other two cities
studied. In addition, Campinas does not present a second wave of infection,
even with the variation γ.
The general behavior of Campinas, concerning the sensitivity analysis for
γ, present results that differ from Santos and São Paulo. It can be noticed in
Fig. 10 that the observed data are far from the peak of infection predicted by
the SIRSi model. At this point, more data is needed for any further qualitative
analysis.
Observing the eigenvalues for the city of Campinas (See Figs. 4 and 5) it can
be noticed that they are all real, indicating that there is no oscillatory behavior
in the dynamics of the model. Depending on the new data this situation might
change.
The infected compartment of Campinas presents the peak of infection close
to the beginning of the second half of 2020, Fig.11.
The increase in the reinfection parameter, causes the peak to increase and
this occurs in the figure Fig.10 indicating that the increase in feedback possibly
contributes to the increase in asymptomatic or unreported infected.

6. Conclusions
The proposed SIRSi model was fitted to publicly available data of the Covid19 outbreak, providing estimates on the duration and peaks of the outbreak.
In addition, the model allows to infer information related to unreported and
asymptomatic cases.
The proposed model with feedback adjusted to the confirmed infection data,
suggests the possibility of the recovered ones having temporary immunity γ > 0
or even permanent γ = 0.

Figure 11: Time evolution for infected population in Campinas.

Considering the situation in which immunity is temporary, there is a second
wave of infection which, depending on the time interval for a recovered person
to be susceptible again, indicates a second wave with a greater or lesser number
of reinfected persons.
If the time interval is shorter (larger γ), the second wave of infection will have
a greater number of infected people when compared to a shorter time interval
of the feedback.
The qualitative behavior for São Paulo and Santos are similar in terms the
sensitivity analysis of the re-susceptibility feedback gain γ. The bigger the γ the
shorter the time for a recovered person to become susceptible again to infection,
increasing unreported or asymptomatic cases.
For the city of Campinas, it is suggested to collect more data, because as
the data of the confirmed infected presents a certain distance from the peak of
the infection, the dynamics of the model may undergo some significant change,
26

given the sensitivity of the model to disturbances.
