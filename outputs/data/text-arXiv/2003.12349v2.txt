Abstract
Due to the recent coronavirus outbreak, many efforts and innovative solutions have surfaced to deal
with the possible shortage of ventilators upon catastrophic surges of patients. One solution involves
splitting one ventilator to treat multiple patients and is in principle easy to implement, but there are
obvious risks, and little is known on how the technique would work on patients with ARDS from Covid19. Previous studies have shown that multiple test lungs of equal characteristics can be successfully
ventilated from one machine, but that large variations in tidal volume delivery occurs when lungs with
different compliance are connected. In contribution to the discussion of the feasibility of the technique,
a technical assessment was done including experiments expanding on the previous studies using two
types of test lungs, different ventilator settings and test lung characteristics. Using two test lungs
connected to a ventilator, the tidal volumes and pressures into both lungs were measured for different
combinations of lung compliance, airway resistances, modes of ventilation, inspiratory and endexpiratory pressure levels. We found discrepancies in delivered tidal volumes for paired test lungs
proportional with compliance differences, little influence from differences in airway resistances, and
that changes in compliance of only one test lung would also change the tidal volume delivered to the
other test lung when in volume controlled mode. For one of the test lung types, we also found that
higher PEEP settings could strongly influence the tidal volume balance between the test lungs. From this
study and from a technical point of view, we were not able to identify reliable settings, adjustments or
any simple measures to overcome the hazards of this simple technique, and a more advanced solution is
indicated for mitigating risks.

Introduction
During catastrophes with a surge of patients needing ventilatory support exceeding the number of
available ventilators, a solution has been proposed for connecting multiple patients to the same
ventilator. Neyman and Babcock Irvin introduced this concept in 2006, which is described below. The
solution is very simple to implement, requiring only three T-tubes, adapters and extra tubes for each
patient. With the recent coronavirus pandemic, interest in the solution has quickly spread globally, but
little is known on how the solution works in reality, in particular for the treatment of ARDS from the
coronavirus.

Description of the solution
The Neyman and Babcock Irvin solution involves connecting four patients to one ventilator by four sets
of tubes connected to the ventilator using two two-way splitters as shown in figure 1, one for the
inspiratory and another for the expiratory limb. The splitter is made of three T-tubes and connection
adapters connected as shown in figure 1b. Other types of splitters such as Y-connectors should work
equally.

Figure 1. Example of a connection of three T-tubes and adapters to make a splitter for
four patients connected to the inspiratory and expiratory limb of one ventilator.

Relevant tests to date
Neyman and Irvin 2006 did a simulation study of the method on four equal test-lungs (Puritan-Bennet)
that were ventilated for about six hours using pressure-controlled ventilation (peak pressure of 25
cmH20) followed by another six hours of volume-controlled ventilation (2000 mL tidal volume). The
positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was set to 0 cm H20, the respiratory rate to 16 breaths/min for

both modes, and the circuit was inspected approximately every 20 minutes visually checking the test
lungs and recording the ventilator display. A relatively even distribution in tidal volume between the
four lungs was recorded with 471±22 mL for pressure control and 507±1 mL for volume control. The
authors indicate further studies for testing of efficacy and safety, but suggest a significant potential for
the expanded use of a single ventilator during cases of disaster surge involving multiple casualties with
respiratory failure.
Paladino et al. 2008 went further and tested the principle in an animal study on four 70 kg sheep
ventilated for 12 hours. The method was similar to Neyman and Babcock Irvin, but with microbial filters
added on each expiratory limb. Arterial pH, pCO2, pO2, heart rate and blood pressure was monitored
during the course of the experiment. Although there were issues with CO2 retention and poor
oxygenation due to positioning, and a case of hypoxia due to adverse reaction to induction agents, the
authors report successful oxygenation and ventilation of all animals for 12 hours while keeping them
hemodynamically stable.
Branson et al. 2012 did a study similar to Neyman and Babcock Irvin, but with test lungs having variable
airway resistance and compliance (the inverse of stiffness). In this way, they could study how the
method would work if patients with different lung characteristics would be connected to the same
ventilator. They found that the ventilation was distributed quite evenly for lungs with equal resistance
and compliance, but found large differences in the ventilation between lungs (from 257 to 621 mL tidal
volume) having different compliance. The authors recommend avoiding the use of this method, given
the potential hazardous and untoward complications.
Lately, Chatburn et al did a simulation study using breathing simulators with evidence-based lung
models having differences in lung resistance and compliance, combining six pairs of simulated patients.
Their experiments confirmed the potential for markedly different ventilation and oxygenation for
patients with uneven respiratory system impedances during multiplex ventilation. More recently,
several innovative solutions have been presented to deal with the known issues of the technique, such
as implementation of individual flow restrictors or pressure relief valves [Clarke et al 2020, Han et al
2020, Hermann et al 2020].
The only study done on humans to our knowledge is a test on two awake volunteers ventilated through
facemasks for ten minutes, connected to the same ventilator (Draeger Evita XL) by Y-connectors splitting
the inspiratory and expiratory limbs (Smith and Brown 2009). Ventilation was given by pressure-control
with an inspiratory pressure of 30 cm H20, PEEP at 2 cm H20, 18 breaths/min while inspiratory and
endtidal CO2 was monitored at the masks. After ten minutes, both subjects’ endtidal CO2 were
acceptable (4.7 and 5.7 kPa) and well tolerated.

Summary and discussion of previous studies
The combined data from studies related to the technique is scarce and not very relevant to ARDS,
making it difficult to draw any conclusion on the suitability of the method (see table 1 for an overview).
The method has been discussed and faced criticism among experts, cautioning against usage.
These tests have shown that the technique may work technically under given circumstances, but with
the lack of relevant tests and the potential hazards, the method has received strong criticism since first
published. Branson published comments on both the studies from Neyman and Babcock Irvin and the
Paladino study in letters to the Editors in Acad. Em. Med and Resuscitation (Branson 2006 and 2008),
pointing to weaknesses of the studies and raising concerns on patient safety. Concerns are raised with
the animal study (Paladino et al. 2008) for being too optimistic with the animals having episodes of
hypoxia and hypercapnia despite having no deliberate pulmonary pathology, and less relevant as the
animals had well-functioning lungs.
The method has been commented by an expert group on critical care [Lewis et al. 2007] where the
issues of dynamic airflow resistance and compliance throughout the duration of ventilation was raised
along with the need for pharmacological paralyzation, seeing more potential utility for the technique on
patients with normal lungs and thereby freeing additional ventilators for patients with high resistance or
low compliance. Recently, protocols have been developed for implementation of the method around
the world, and at the same time, the Society of Critical Care Medicine has published a Consensus
Statement on Multiple Patients Per Ventilator (March 26 2020), advising against the use of the technique
(www.sccm.org/Disaster/Joint-Statement-on-Multiple-Patients-Per-Ventilato). There is wide agreement
that this technique is only a last resort solution in case of equipment shortage [Tonetti et al 2020,
Pearson et al 2020].
Due to the lack of data on the feasibility of the technique, we conducted a study with a series of tests,
extending the relevant cases of lung characteristics and ventilator settings tested previously. The aim of
this study was to learn more about the feasibility and issues with the technique and provide more data
from relevant experiments to support the evaluation of the concept from a technical standpoint.

Methods
Two types of test lungs, either a pair of Michigan Instruments (MI) adult lung simulators or a pair of IMT
Analytics Smartlung Adult were connected to one ventilator (Löwenstein Medical Leon Plus anesthetic
machine) using T-connectors as shown in figure 3. The Michigan Instruments test lungs were springbased with 2L capacity while the IMT test lungs were 1000 mL bags with a capacity of 600 mL. One of
the test lungs (Lung A) was set to a constant compliance at approximately 30 mL/mbar, while the other
test lung was set to variable levels of compliance as shown in Table 2. The true compliance of the test
lungs were measured by the ventilator, and differed slightly for the given values for the IMT test lungs

(28 mL/mbar for Lung A at 25 mL/mbar and 7, 14, 20 and 29 mL/mbar at the four adjustable levels of
Lung B of 10, 15, 20 and 30 mL/mbar). Both IMT test lungs had adjustable airway resistance at the
connection into the lung, possible to adjust to 5, 20, 50 and 200 mbar/L/s. For monitoring of individual
tidal volumes and pressures into the lungs, an IMT Analytics type PF300 flow and pressure analyzer was
connected between each lung and the assigned inspiratory and expiratory tubes as shown in figure 3.

Figure 3. Setup for the testing of two lungs sharing one ventilator with monitoring of
tidal volumes and pressure into both lungs (the IMT test lungs are shown in the drawing)

Figure 4. Test lungs, flow and pressure sensors and the anesthetic machine used in the study.

The aim was to investigate this simple ventilator sharing setup in how the distribution in ventilation
between two lungs depends on differences in compliance, and how this dependency relates to the
airway resistance, mode of ventilation (pressure or volume control), levels of peak inspiratory pressure
(PIP) and the extrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Table 2 shows all settings used in the
tests. For volume-controlled ventilation, we used a tidal volume of 900 mL to obtain 450 mL in both
lungs upon balanced ventilation. An earlier test with the same setup showed that the distribution
between the two test lungs was independent of the tidal volume setting (from 900 to 1500 mL), hence
we used only one setting at 900 mL for the volume controlled tests. As default, a PEEP of 6 mbar was
used unless mentioned otherwise.

Results
Modes of ventilation
Figure 5 shows how the distribution in ventilation between the two MI test lungs was dependent on the
differences in compliance between them using both volume- and pressure-controlled modes of
ventilation. Expectedly, the tidal volumes were equal upon equal compliances (CA = CB = 30 mL/mbar),
and Lung B received lower parts of the total tidal volume as its compliance decreased. The change in
Lung B’s compliance also caused the ventilation of Lung A to change when in volume-controlled mode
(Figure 5a), but not in pressure-controlled mode (Figure 5b and c). In volume control and at CB = 15, as
an example where one lung was set to half the compliance of the other, the less compliant lung received
about 30% less volume while the more compliant lung received a similarly large increase in volume
compared to when the compliances were equal (CB = 30). In pressure controlled mode, this reduction in
delivered volume to lung B at CB = 15 was about 50%, but with no change to Lung A. The ratio of tidal
volumes delivered between the two test lungs was approximately equal to the ratio of compliance
between the lungs, independent on whether volume control or pressure control with a PIP of 20 or 30
mbar was used.

Figure 5. Delivered tidal volumes to the two MI test lungs using volume control (a), pressure control with
PIP=20 mbar (b) and pressure control with PIP=30 mbar (c). Testlung A has a constant compliance of 30
mL/mbar while the compliance of testlung B (CB) is changed from 50 to 10 mL/mbar. A PEEP of 6 mbar
was used in these measurements. # indicates that the ventilator was not able to completely obtain the
set inspiratory pressure of 30 mbar (approximately four mbar lower) due to the large MI test lung
volume.

Figure 6 shows how the distribution in ventilation when the IMT test lungs were used. As the pressure
limit alarms were triggered at the 30 mbar limit in volume controlled mode (figure 6a), volumecontrolled ventilation without pressure limitation is also presented in figure 6b. Based on figure 6b-d,
the same effect of changes in ventilation to both lungs upon changes in CB is seen in also in volumecontrolled ventilation of these test lungs, along with the unchanged ventilation of lung A when in
pressure-controlled mode. For these test lungs, the ratio of tidal volumes could differ from the
compliance ratios, seen in particular for CB=20 in pressure controlled mode.

Figure 6. Delivered tidal volumes to the two IMT test lungs using volume control (a-b) and pressure
control with PIP set to 20 mbar (c) and 30 mbar (d). Tidal volumes delivered with a pressure limitation at
30 mbar is shown in a) and in b) without pressure limitation. * indicates that the pressure limit was
reached during the ventilation. A PEEP of 6 mbar was used in these measurements.

The effect of PEEP setting
Figure 7 shows the distribution in ventilation between two MI test lungs when PEEP was increased to 10
and 15 mbar for volume controlled and pressure controlled ventilation. This distribution remained
similar to the original setting with a PEEP at 6 mbar (figure 5) for both ventilation modes. Expectedly, the
tidal volumes decreased for high PEEP due to lower driving pressures, but the ratios between the tidal
volumes measured in the two lungs remained similar, independent on PEEP or PIP level. For the IMT test
lungs however, the PEEP level affected the distribution in volumes between the lungs. A particularly
noteworthy case was for CB=20, where a PEEP level of 10 mbar would seem to ventilate the two lungs
more evenly than for a PEEP at 6, but when the PEEP was increased to 15, Lung A (the more compliant
of the two) lost tidal volume while lung B remained at the same level. In this case, the PEEP at 15 mbar
had caused Lung A to remain highly inflated after expiration leaving little capacity for additional
ventilation, while lung B was empty after expiration allowing more air to enter from the driving
pressure. This effect of PEEP was present in both volume and pressure controlled ventilation.

Figure 8. Delivered tidal volumes to the two IMT test lungs for higher levels of PEEP, shown for volume
control (a-b) and pressure control with (c-d) and pressure control with PIP=30 mbar. Testlung A has a
constant compliance of 30 mL/mbar while the compliance of testlung B (CB) is changed from 30 to 7
mL/mbar. * indicates that the pressure limit was reached during the ventilation.

The effect of airway resistance
For the IMT test lungs, we also changed the airway resistances to both lungs in different combinations,
and this effect on the distribution of tidal volumes is presented in figures 9 and 10 for volume-controlled
and pressure controlled modes respectively. A comparison between figure 9a (with RA= RB=20 mbar/L/s)
and 6a (with RA= RB=5 mbar/L/s) shows that the volume distribution between the test lungs was
unaffected by increasing the resistance equally for both lungs, independent of the compliance in Lung B.
Increasing only the resistance into Lung B gave a slight reduction in the tidal volume of Lung B, and
correspondingly a slight increase in tidal volume of Lung B was measured upon increasing only the
resistance into Lung A. This change was small (for example 28 mL at CB=20 when increasing RA to 20)
although the resistance was quadrupled, and there were no significant changes in pressure. This effect
of differences in airway resistance on the tidal volume was low in both volume and pressure controlled
ventilation modes. A tenfold increase in the airway resistance into lung A caused a considerable
decrease in the tidal volume delivered to this lung as shown in figures 9d and 10d. At the same time and
only for volume controlled mode, the tidal volumes delivered to lung B increased considerably (for
CB=30 and 20) as a consequence of this large increase in airway resistance into lung A. In this case, the
restriction (RA=50) had caused the pressure in to lung A to drop to around 15 mbar.

Figure 10. Delivered tidal volumes to the two IMT test lungs for different combinations of airway
resistance to lung A (RA) and to lung B (RB), ventilated in pressure control mode. A PIP of 20 mbar and a
PEEP of 6 mbar was used for these measurements.

Discussion
The results clearly show how differences in compliance could cause large discrepancies in ventilation
between the two test lungs and that this discrepancy was large already when the stiffer lung had a 30%
lower compliance than the other lung. This confirms that connecting patients with such differences in
compliance by this technique may cause very different delivery of tidal volumes from the same setting
on the ventilator. In addition to insufficient ventilation of the stiffer lung, the problem of potentially
causing volutrauma in the more compliant lung arises, in particular for volume-controlled ventilation
where reduced compliance in one lung directly increases the volume delivered to the other lung. As
demonstrated in the results, pressure-controlled ventilation kept the ventilation to the constant lung (A)
stable while the compliance of the other lung was changed (figure 5b-c) which is an advantage of this
mode. However, compensating for low ventilation of the stiffer lung by increasing PIP would still cause
unintended elevated inflation of the more compliant lung (comparing figure 5b and 5c). Only two test
lungs were connected in this study, and these issues would not be any less problematic when
connecting four patients to the same ventilator. Two randomly paired patients with ARDS could have
relatively large differences in compliance, as the baseline variation between patients can be large
(Amato et al. 1998, Gattinoni et al. 2006, Sundareasn et al. 2011), with a coefficient of variation of about
20% to 40% from these studies. Perhaps even more important is the intraindividual changes in lung
condition during the course of treatment and changes in lung impedance due to regular events such as

changing the position of the patient, sudden obstruction due to secretion, coughing, or breathing in
non-paralyzed patients.
Our results are largely in agreement with Branson et al. 2012, who also found a low effect of airway
resistance differences compared to compliance differences in the volume distribution between test
lungs. Branson et al. 2012 also reported that the discrepancies in delivered tidal volumes was
exacerbated for pressure-controlled ventilation (using a PIP of 15 cm H20), where we measured equal
discrepancies for the two modes when using the MI test lungs (figure 11a). We also measured a higher
discrepancy for pressure-controlled with PIP=20 and lower discrepancies with PIP=30 for the IMT test
lungs, probably due to these particular test lung characteristics.
The extrinsic PEEP was set to 6 mbar as default for all tests until the PEEP was increased to 10 and 15
mbar while studying the effect on the ventilation distribution. For the MI test lungs, there was no effect
on the ventilation distribution from the changes in PEEP, but for the IMT test lungs the PEEP level
interacted with the distribution of tidal volumes. Going from 6 to 10 mbar PEEP, the tidal volumes of the
two lungs became more equal, especially notable when CB=20 (figure 8). Our next finding was that
further increases in PEEP could greatly influence the tidal volumes of the two test lungs and in
unintended ways. The PEEP setting is used in treatment to sustain a positive pressure after the end of
expiration to prevent alveolar collapse, but this effect could be quite different when several lungs are
connected to the same inspiratory and expiratory valves. As shown in figure 8, the distribution in tidal
volumes was strongly dependent on the PEEP, and at CB=20 Lung B obtained about three times the tidal
volume of Lung A although Lung A was more compliant. In this case, Lung A was largely inflated after
expiration with less inspiratory capacity left, while lung B was empty after expiration. The “two-balloon
effect” (Merritt and Weinhaus 1978) could possibly have contributed to this volume discrepancy, and
the inclusion of one-way valves could possibly help. This issue was only present for the IMT test lungs
(behaving more like a balloon and having a lower capacity than the MI lungs), but could indicate an
additional concern in ventilating lungs with different compliances using higher PEEP, also supporting a
need for the possibility to adjust PEEP individually if ventilators would be shared.
According to theory, the distribution in ventilated volumes between the lungs should simply be equal to
the ratio of dynamic compliances between them, assuming equal pressures into the lungs and equal
lung capacities. Figure 11 shows the relation between compliance ratio between the test lungs and the
fraction of the total tidal volume delivered to test lung B (having variable compliance) presented for all
the experimental cases measured in this study. In summary, none of these experimental cases could
reliably provide balanced ventilation to test lungs with unequal compliance. Clearly, all measurements
with the MI test lungs had a good agreement with theoretical expectation, independent on modes of
ventilation, level of PIP or level of PEEP. For the experiments with IMT test lungs, there were several
cases deviating from the theoretical line. The cases when PEEP was set to 15 mbar, the cases with large
airway resistance into lung A and for pressure-controlled ventilation with a PIP at 30 mbar all had an
elevated fraction of volume delivered to lung B. On the other hand, all cases of pressure control with a
PIP at 20 mbar had a reduced fraction of volume delivered to lung B. With respect to splitting of a
ventilator, the line should ideally lie around a 50% fraction independent on the compliance ratio. In a
couple of cases (pressure controlled ventilation, PIP=30 mbar and PEEP of either 6 or 10 mbar), the line
is close to 50% from 70% to 100% compliance ratios. However, this is most likely due to the
characteristics of these particular test lungs (such as their inspiratory capacities being reached), and
would not be a reliable setting for this purpose. At the same time, limited inspiratory pressures (in

particular the plateau pressure < 30 cmH20) is important to prevent ventilator-induced lung injury in
ARDS [Alhazzani et al 2020].
The large increase in airway resistance into lung A (RA=50) shifted the volume fraction closer towards
50% when the lungs had different compliance (70% compliance ratio), an effect that is relevant to the
application of flow restrictors that has been suggested as a means to balance tidal volumes in split
ventilation [Clarke et al 2020]. This involves connecting a flow restrictor valve into one or both of the
inspiratory tubes for constriction of the flow to the more compliant lung in order to compensate for tidal
volume differences. Based on our test, there was little effect on tidal volumes from a four-fold increase
in constriction, and a ten-fold constriction (from 5 to 50 mbar/L/s) was necessary to have a balancing
effect on the tidal volumes for the IMT test lungs with CA=28 and CB=20. With such a strong constriction,
it could be difficult to tune the flow accurately within the remaining cross-sectional area of the tube
unless the valve control is very precise. In addition, such constriction and increase of airway resistances
alters to the inspiratory time constant (resistance multiplied by compliance). We believe that pressurereduction valves would be more suitable for this purpose, providing a more linear control of individual
inspiratory pressures and tidal volumes.

Figure 11. The fraction of the total tidal volume delivered to the test lung with variable compliance (lung
B) plotted as a function of the ratio of compliances between the test lungs. All experimental cases are
plotted for the MI test lungs in a) and for the IMT test lungs in b). Note that a) includes one
measurement with higher compliance ratio (167%) and that b) also includes tests with different airway
resistances.

It is important to stress that experimenting on test lungs have obvious limitations and is far from the
real situation with ventilation of real pathological lungs over many days with additional concerns such as
contamination, coughs and voluntary breathing triggering the ventilator, and the extrapolation of these
experiments to the treatment of real lungs is limited. In addition, there are ethical concerns, as
discussed in Pearson et al 2020. Although two different types of test lungs were used, both will likely
have different characteristics from lungs in ARDS patients, including the levels of compliance and the
pressure-volume characteristics. The IMT test lungs had adjustable compliance from 10 to 30 mL/mbar
(in reality 7-29 mL/mbar) and a capacity of 600mL, which is far less than expected for healthy lungs and
also low for ARDS lungs. The IMT test lungs may be more relevant for the case of the “baby lung”
associated with ARDS [Gattinoni and Pesenti 2005]. The discrepancy in results between the two types of
test lungs also underscores the importance of properly relevant test lungs and their characteristics when
testing new methods in simulations. The tests in this study was done using only one particular
ventilator, a part of an anesthetic machine representing a typical ventilator, and the ventilator behavior
when connecting multiple circuits may differ between models.
Anyhow, our main goal was to investigate the distribution of ventilation for lungs with relative
differences in compliance. At the same time, this should be taken into consideration when interpreting
our results on patients with other compliance levels. The observed effects of PEEP in test lung with
different compliance will likely be of clinical relevance in patients with ARDS as personalized, elevated
PEEP often is indicated. An issue with differences in the effect of PEEP due to even modest differences in
compliance between patients was also reported in Chatburn et al 2020. In patients with severe lung
failure due to ARDS the optimal combination between pressure, flow and PEEP is sought. Individualized
therapy will not be possible when one ventilator is shared between two or more patients unless
substantial modifications are implemented. Sharing one ventilator on two or more patients will
complicate monitoring of all included patients and the competence and clinical skills of the critical care
nurse or physician will be crucial. The ventilator setting is individualized based on measurements of
flow, pressure, and end-tidal CO2. In a patient safety perspective, a simple pressure controlled ventilator
mode with moderate PEEP in patients with comparable respiration physiology is indicated.

Conclusion
Based on the test in this study of the simple ventilator splitting technique [Neyman G and Irvin CB 2006]
including different test lungs, ventilation modes, PIP levels, PEEP levels and combinations of airway
resistances, we did not find any reliable setting, adjustment or simple measure to provide balanced
ventilation of lungs with different compliance. A more advanced modification is indicated that includes
in-line pressure-reduction valves at the inspiratory limbs for individualized inspiratory pressure,
individual adjustment of PEEP at the expiratory limbs (potentially also by in-line pressure reduction
valves), sensors for individual monitoring of tidal volumes and pressures in addition to the splitters and
filters used in the simple setup. Such a solution has lately been in development, investigated and tested
by an international working group on differential multiventilation (differentialmultivent.org).
