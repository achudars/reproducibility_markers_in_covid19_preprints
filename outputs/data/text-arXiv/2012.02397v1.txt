Abstract
Social distancing has been the only effective way to contain the spread of an
infectious disease prior to the availability of the pharmaceutical treatment. It can
lower the infection rate of the disease at the economic cost. A pandemic crisis like
COVID-19, however, has posed a dilemma to the policymakers since a long-term
restrictive social distancing or even lockdown will keep economic cost rising. This
paper investigates an efficient social distancing policy to manage the integrated
risk from economic health and public health issues for COVID-19 using a stochastic epidemic modeling with mobility controls. The social distancing is to restrict the
community mobility, which was recently accessible with big data analytics. This
paper takes advantage of the community mobility data to model the COVID-19
processes and infer the COVID-19 driven economic values from major market index price, which allow us to formulate the search of the efficient social distancing
policy as a stochastic control problem. We propose to solve the problem with a
deep-learning approach. By applying our framework to the US data, we empirically
examine the efficiency of the US social distancing policy and offer recommendations
generated from the algorithm.

Introduction

The coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which was first identified in Wuhan, China, in Dec
2019, has resulted in a pandemic. Its widespread outbreak since Feb 2020 imposes unexpected challenges on countries around the globe, as it has caused hundreds of thousands
of deaths, severe resource shortages, and a severe economic blow. Several studies estimate
an inevitable global recession as a result of the pandemic. Wren-Lewis (2020) suggests
a decline in economic growth due to disrupted global supply chains and reduced social
consumption. According to Fernandes (2020), the GDP growth could decline by 3-5%
depending on the country, costing 2.5-3% of global GDP for each additional shutdown
month. Makridis & Hartley (2020) estimates a 5% decline in GDP growth monthly in
United States (US), while the economic cost of the first two months since the outbreak
of COVID-19 in US has already been $2.14 trillion, roughly 10% percent of GDP in US.
A broad variety of mathematical models studying the evolution of (COVID-19) epidemic processes have been proposed in the literature. A classic deterministic compartmental modeling framework, SIR model, is first proposed in Kermack & McKendrick
(1927). Recently, SIR model variations have been developed with increasing mathematical complexity, enabling the study of several aspects of the epidemic process. For example,
Karako et al. (2020); Bardina et al. (2020) models an additional individual action, including latent periods and the presence of asymptomatic patients. Several studies (He
et al. (2020); Chang et al. (2020); Moore & Okyere (2020)) model the transmission of
COVID-19 by considering government’s control measures, while some studies (de Souza
et al. (2020)) incorporate the epidemiological and clinical characteristics in modeling.
The aforementioned studies improve our understanding of the underlying virus transition
mechanism and provide guidance on how to manage the spread of the virus.
Among policies in reaction to pandemic, the non-pharmaceutical social distancing is a
crucial tool for minimizing the spread of virus by preserving physical distance and decreasing social interactions; see Habersaat et al. (2020) for ten qualitative considerations in the
new norm. Common social distancing laws include bans on public events, close-downs
of schools and non-important workplaces, limits on public transports;see Kissler et al.
(2020). Companies like Google, Apple, and Cuebiq have already utilized the location
data of their users to deliver useful mobility and economic trends information; see Google
(2020); Apple (2020); Cuebiq (2020). A vast amount of recent COVID-19 studies focus
on researching the pattern of changes in mobility (Warren & Skillman (2020); Ghader
et al. (2020); Gao et al. (2020)), the role of mobility in disease prediction (Liu et al.
(2020); Miller et al. (2020)), estimating the effectiveness of distancing social strategies
(Liu et al. (2020); Soucy et al. (2020)) and economic consequence of mobility restriction
(Bonaccorsi et al. (2020)).
While social distancing can effectively lower infection rates, policymakers face a complicated situation in trying to reconcile stringent public health acts and keep the economy
running. The combined impact of shutdown policies with public health crisis further results in a sharp contraction of economic activity; see Barua (2020). Substantial evidence
suggests that government restrictions on commercial activities bring huge economic damage, especially for a service-oriented economy like US; see Baker et al. (2020). McKee &
Stuckler (2020) adds that if the world fails to protect the economy, the COVID-19 could
cost beyond the disease itself economically and in turn the healthcare system’s blow will
lead to long-lasting damage in health in the future. An efficient social distancing policy
(ESDP) that takes into account both public health and economic health is desired and
2

draws researchers’ attention. Some highly related studies are Benzell et al. (2020); Block
et al. (2020). However, the aforementioned studies on social distancing are more of qualitative discussion, offering guidance on how to implement social distancing. López & Rodó
(2020) conducts data analysis with real COVID-19 data and conduct simulation studies
to evaluate different scenarios. Nikolopoulos et al. (2020) develop a hybrid forecasting
method for infectious disease and the excess demand for products and services during the
pandemic. Silal. (2020) offers a comprehensive overview of operational research methods
for the management of infectious disease.
However, we notice that the existing studies did not tease out the mobility changes
from the stochastic modeling of the COVID-19 processes, given that the data we used
to feed into the model have been affected by the time-varying social distancing policies.
Moreover, the literature is lack of a quantitative study on the ESDP. The key to these
two research gaps is to take advantage of the community mobility data from Google. This
paper contributes to the literature in the following aspects.
1. We extend the susceptible, infectious, recovered, and deceased (SIRD) model to
incorporate community mobility data to predict the COVID-19 process, while the
randomnesses are studied statistically. This enables us to regard the mobility as
the control variable.
2. We statistically learn the COVID-driven economic value from a major financial
index, the mobility changes, and the COVID-19 statistics.
3. We then formulate a stochastic control problem to determine the optimal mobility
target (or social distancing policy) and solve it numerically via a deep learning
approach. The objective functional of the stochastic control problem integrates
public health and economic health while the state processes are the statistically
estimated SIRD model and the COVID-driven economic value. By varying the
weights between the public and economic health risk in the objective functional, we
define the notion of the efficient social distancing frontier(ESDF), through which
we measure the efficiency of realized social distancing schemes.
Our proposed framework consists of three novel components learnt from the COVID-19
pandemic experience. The first one is the incorporation of social mobility into to the
stochastic epidemic model detailed in Section 2. We empirically show the significance of
mobility controls during the COVID-19 crisis period. The second novel idea is to learn
the economic cost from the frequently updated financial market data in Section 3. We
link the stability of major financial indices to the realized epidemic and mobility control
variables. Our empirical tests confirm the significance and relevancy of the cost functional
to the stochastic epidemic model. The learning of the cost functional is performed for
the data before any economic stimulus because our goal is to reduce the economic cost
from the disease rather than predicting the index movement for profit making. Section
4 details the conceptual framework of integrating public health and economic health to
formulate ESDPs in (4), results are provided in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 concludes.

Stochastic modeling of COVID-19

We model the COVID-19 process based on a compartmental epidemiological framework,
originated in Kermack & McKendrick (1927). Specifically, the population is assigned
3

to compartments with labels, S, I, R, and D, representing the fractions of individuals
who are susceptible, infectious, recovered, and deceased, respectively, to the infectious disease. There are also many extensions with more or modified compartments; see Hethcote
(2000). However, their applicability highly depends on the available data and for most
infectious disease, especially COVID-19, the access of the data is limited and the accuracy
of some data is arguable when enormous data are being processed everyday. Therefore,
we only focus on the SIRD model that only require the number of reported cases, active
cases, and deaths.
The stochastic modeling in this paper consists of two parts. In the first part, we aim
to build a stochastic SIRD model that can fit with the real data of COVID-19 in United
States (US). Although the SIRD model is usually presented in differential equations, we
consider a discrete-time SIRD model as it is more intuitive in practice. To align with the
frequency of the data we collect, the time interval is set as one day, indexed by t ∈ N.
A standard SIRD epidemiological model is also used in Fernández-Villaverde & Jones
(2020) to inversely back out a time-varying virus reproduction rate to capture changes in
behavior and policy that occur at different times. However, we would like to use real data
to estimate the stochastic process of the reproduction rate. This research demonstrates
the value of modeling the changing infection rates of social distancing and enhanced
hygienic practices. The distinct feature of our modeling of COVID-19 is to incorporate
with the Google mobility indices, available at Google (2020), into the model and our
studies show that they are highly correlated with the infection rates. In fact, without
taking the mobility of the community into consideration, the modeling of the infectious
disease is inaccurate. In the next section, we further build an econometric model on the
market indices with the independent variables using COVID-19 statistics and the Google
mobility indices. We also find that the COVID-19 and mobility indices play important
roles in explaining the market indices during the COVID-19 crisis.

2.1

The SIRD model with stochastic log-odds

Now, the S, I, R, and D are treated as (stochastic) processes indexed by t. A discretetime classic SIRD model is given by

where fβ (βt+1 ), fγ (γt+1 ), and fδ (δt+1 ) represent rates of infection, recovery, and death
over the period [t, t + 1], respectively. Here, we consider all functions f ’s as sigmoid
function1 , i.e.
1
,
fβ (x) = fγ (x) = fδ (x) = σ(x) :=
1 + e−x
In general, one can consider inhomogeneous functions f ’s and modify any of them as 1/(K + e−x )
such that the corresponding rate ranges in (0, 1/K) for any constant K > 0. Although the rates can
sometimes exceed 1, especially for the infection rate during the early outbreak, our studies found that
using sigmoid function (K = 1) yields consistently decent fitting results for US COVID-19 data and thus
we will stick with the standard sigmoid function. Note that during the early outbreak of the disease, the
data are too less and not reliable.

such that βt+1 , γt+1 , and δt+1 are interpreted as log-odds of infection, recovery, and death,
respectively. In contrast with most studies that assume constant rates and disregard the
range (or positivity) of the rate, this formulation allows us to study the log-odds on the
real line and the resulting rates always range in (0, 1). It is crucial for later analyses when
we introduce mobility controls into the log-odds, since the stochastic modeling (of the
log-odds) is now free of constraints, so are the controls. With the data of {(It , Rt , Dt )}Tt=0
and the model (1), we can compute the log-odds as follows: for t = 0, 1, . . . , T − 1,

One simple but key observation is that the data we can collect are usually affected
by the changing environment. For example, the government and the medical authorities
might have made efforts in reducing the infectious cases or deaths by isolation of infected
individuals, social distancing, and/or vaccination (if any); see Cheng et al. (2020). When
the vaccination is not available yet, the isolation and social distancing become the most
efficient ways to contain the virus situation. Most countries had implemented them when
they were aware of seriousness of the disease on their lands; COVID-19 in US is no
exception. Hence, when the data are fed into the SIRD model (1) or (2), these factors
should be taken into account. This paper is focused on fighting COVID-19 by mobility
controls (isolation and social distancing) only. Under the assumption of no vaccination,
it is natural to consider that the recovery log-odds γ and the death log-odds δ in (2) are
specific to the virus and they are not affected by exogenous factors. Throughout this
paper, we do not consider the variety of the virus and presume that one country has only
one major type of the virus. The infection rate β, however, is dependent on the mobility
of the community.
To join the efforts in fighting COVID-19, Google, a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc., recently published COVID-19 community mobility reports based on data collected from
Google products (e.g. Google Maps) to help public health officials to make critical decisions; see Google (2020). The Google mobility indices are also considered as feasible
controls as they are directly linked to the government’s social distancing policy. One major contribution of this paper is to derive the optimal mobility controls (social distancing).
These indices cover mobility changes (compared to the baseline2 ) of retail & recreation
(RR), grocery & pharmacy (GP), parks (PA), transit stations (TS), workplaces (WP),
and residential (RE), denoted by a vector α = (α(RR) , α(GP ) , α(P A) , α(T S) , α(W P ) , α(RE) )> .
Based on the discussion above, the stochastic modeling of β uses mobility indices
as independent variables while that of γ and δ does not use any independent variables.
To investigate the dynamics of the log-odds, we consider three forms of the dependent
variables. Specifically, for ξt = βt , γt , or δt , we consider the dependent variables of the
forms: 1) ξt ; 2) ξt − ξt−1 ; and 3) ξt /ξt−1 − 1. When the residuals are fitted with normality,
we are essentially modeling the process as independent normal random variables, the
Brownian motion, and geometric Brownian motion for these three forms of dependent
variables, respectively. When we attempt to model the relation between the infection
rate (log-odds) and the mobility indices, our preliminary studies show that using data
2

The baseline values are computed as the median values of the indices from the pre-virus period from
Jan 3 to Feb 6, 2020. A zero control vector represents a baseline day. Note that it is defined statistically
and there was not be such a day in the past.

5

of 5-day moving average for each mobility index produces much better results. It can
be understood from an epidemiological perspective that there is an incubation period
and the infection is related to the contacts over a certain period. We denote the moving
average mobility indices as ᾱ = (ᾱ(RR) , ᾱ(GP ) , ᾱ(P A) , ᾱ(T S) , ᾱ(W P ) , ᾱ(RE) )> . It will be used
as the explanatory variables of β.

2.2

US COVID-19 data

Before we present our data analysis, we remark that the COVID-19 data seem to be
inaccurate during the early outbreak. For example, in the data collected from Worldometer.info, the total recovery cases would sometimes decrease until Mar 19, 2020. Since R
and D are of smaller orders compared to I, they have large volatilities and thus when we
study the {γt } and {δt } processes, we feed only the data starting from Mar 19, 2020. As
the controversial data points do not have big impacts on I, we still study {βt } with the
data starting from Mar 1, 2020.
Our first attempt is to fit the three different transformations of ξt = βt , γt , or δt with
normality. We conduct the Shapiro–Wilk normality tests (see Shapiro & Wilk (1965))
for the log-odds and the p-values are reported in Table 1, where each row represents the
testing with the data up to the indicated date. When the p-value is large (exceeds a
significance level), we cannot reject the normality assumption of the data. We can see
that {γt /γt−1 − 1} can be assumed to be normally distributed, while {δt /δt−1 − 1} is comparably normally distributed3 . {βt − βt−1 } may also be considered normally distributed
marginally. However, as we discussed, the infection rate (or log-odds) generally depends
on the mobility controls of the country.

Next, we regress each transformation of the infection log-odds on the 5-day moving
average mobility indices ᾱ = (ᾱ(RR) , ᾱ(GP ) , ᾱ(P A) , ᾱ(T S) , ᾱ(W P ) , ᾱ(RE) )> , i.e. we consider
the regression model LHSt+1 = c0 + c> ᾱt + t+1 for t = 1, . . . , T − 1, where LHSt+1 =
βt , βt − βt−1 or βt /βt−1 − 1, c0 and c are regression coefficients, and t+1 is the error
term at time t + 1. The regression results for each period are presented in Table 24 .
With the mobility indices as independent variables, the fittings are greatly improved and
promising. The best models consistently use the βt as dependent variable and in this
case, all the coefficients of determination (R2 ) are larger than 0.84 while the residuals
pass the Shapiro–Wilk normality test with any significance level larger than 9.8%.
3

The death rates or cases are likely affected by other factors across time that are not captured with
the mobility considered in this paper. However, we still adopt this simple model for simplicity.
4
For the fittings of using βt − βt−1 or βt /βt−1 − 1 as dependent variable, we found that truncation
of the early problematic data points (first 20 data) improve the model fit. However, the truncation does
not improve the fitting of using βt as dependent variable. Table 2 presented the best results for each of
them and using βt is still the winner.

(mean µ and standard deviation σ) can be easily estimated with historical data as given
in Table 3. From Table 2 and Table 3, we can see that the parameter estimates are quite
stable for the whole month of June. The intercept c0 and the coefficient corresponding to
ᾱ(W P ) are sometimes statistically insignificant but we still keep them for the consistency
of the model and the purpose of capturing all mobility effects on economics and controls.

The interpretation of the regression coefficients in Table 2 requires extra cautions as the
mobility indices are highly correlated with each other, a phenomenon known as multicollinearity. However, as we just use the regression model for predicting the drift of βt+1
in (3), the multicollinearity does not bother the prediction.
With the fitted model (3), we can conduct simulations to evaluate the effectiveness
of the government’s responses to COVID-19. Fixing the future mobility indices as the
median ones for each period corresponding to a social distancing policy, we find that
only school closure in US will still lead to massive infectious cases and deaths, while the
COVID-19 can be contained by the end of 2020 with school and workplace closures. The
results are presented in the Appendix A.

Learning COVID-19 driven economic value from
financial data

Although restricting social mobility has positive effect in containing the disease, there
are opportunity costs from reducing the mobility. At least, nobody is happy with the
lockdown of the economy. The aggregated economic cost should reflect the risk from
economic downturn, the spread of the disease, and the social dissatisfaction. Therefore,
the optimal mobility control strikes the best balance between consumption and health of
the population. A similar considerations in Hall et al. (2020) investigates the trade-off
between the consumption and COVID-19 deaths. The novelty of our approach is to learn
the aggregated economic cost as a functional of SIRD and mobility indices through the
financial market data.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the US government has made different responses
to the coronavirus situation over different periods; see Cheng et al. (2020); Roser et al.
(2020). In supplementary appendix, we focus on some past representative mobility indices
and conduct simulation studies to investigate their implications. However, the government is not limited by the past responses and can launch some new or combined social
distancing rules to control the community mobility effectively. To find the optimal mobility control policy, we need to first identify the trade-off among the COVID-19 statistics,
the mobility controls, and the target of our interest. Some studies concerning about the
healthcare burden set the cost functional as the healthcare costs. A more recent study in
Benzell et al. (2020) quantifies the lockdown decision as a trade-off between infection risks
and benefits, by using multiple indicators coming from both economic and consumers’
contributions. We share the view that during a pandemic crisis like COVID-19, the financial market is dominated by the news about the COVID-19 as it affects many businesses.
Especially when the country is locked down, the economics and most businesses in the
country will be lashed. It characterizes a trade-off between the mobility controls and the
economics of the country.
In this subsection, we explore the relationships among the COVID-19 statistics, the
mobility controls, and the market index. The market index, chosen as S&P 500 index for
the US in this paper, is used to reflect the economics of the US. Once the relationships
are identified, we postulate that the economic health is reflected through the stability of
the market during the COVID-19 crisis period prior to any economic stimulus. Efficient
mobility control policy attempts to achieve public health goals (such as target infection
rate less than 1) with minimum cost on economic health. To conceptualize the efficiency,
we search for the optimal mobility control policy set that minimizes the acquired cost
8

functional incorporating both public and economic health.

S&P 500 index price data

The S&P 500 index prices are downloaded from Yahoo!Finance. We conduct an ex-post
regression of the daily S&P 500 index closing prices (SPXt ) on the COVID-19 statistics
and mobility indices. Specifically, we postulate that
X
SPXt = κ0 + κ> αt + κI It + κR Rt + κD Dt + SP
t
X
for t = 1, . . . , T , where κ0 , κ ∈ R6 , κI , κR , and κD are regression coefficients and SP
t
is the error term at time t. Note that in the independent variables, we use α instead of
the moving average one ᾱ because the market’s reaction to the community mobility is
immediate. The regression results are reported in Table 4. Each fitting is based on the
daily data (working days) from Mar 9 to the fitting date indicated in the table.

From Table 4, we can see that the fittings are all good as all R2 are higher than 0.89
and the residuals pass the Shapiro–Wilk normality test with any significance level larger
than 38%. It shows that during the COVID-19 crisis, the COVID-19 statistics and the
mobility indices have high explanatory power for the S&P 500 index price. Even some
independent variables are insignificant, we choose to keep all the independent variables
because we look for a high explanatory power and in our preliminary studies on the control
problem below, eliminating some mobility controls will lead to the extreme values of the
eliminated mobility controls in optimality. Again, we need to be cautious in interpreting
the coefficients as there is also multicollinearity. However, it does not affect our use of
the regression model as the proxy for the COVID-19 driven economic values learnt from
the S&P 500 index price.

Efficient social distancing

When we aim to reduce an integrated risk of public health and economic health through
social distancing, it can be conceptually written as
min {(public health risk) + λ(economic health risk)},
α

(4)

where α is a mobility control and λ ≥ 0 reflects the economic risk aversion. When λ = 0,
the policymaker only cares about the public health even at an unlimited economic cost.
In other words, a policymaker concerning the economic health should take a positive
λ. However, an extremely large λ means almost ignoring the public health issue. For
any fixed λ ≥ 0, if the conceptual problem (4) can be solved, then the optimal mobility
control α∗ (λ) is called an efficient social distancing policy (ESDP). We define the efficient
social distancing frontier (ESDF) as the set of all ESDPs: ESDF = {α∗ (λ) : λ ≥ 0}.
The conceptual framework (4) and the ESDF constitute an epidemic-economic analogue to the mean-variance portfolio theory by Markowitz (1952), a Nobel memorial prize
work. The key difference is that portfolio theory focuses on mean and variance of a single
random output (the investor’s wealth) whereas the efficient social distancing problem
(4) has two different random outputs associated with the epidemic and economic issues,
respectively.
An obvious COVID-19 public health target is to contain infection by social distancing.
In a statistical perspective, we concern about the probability of increasing in the infection
rate σ(βt ) with a social distancing policy against the probability of decreasing. The ratio
between the two probabilities is essentially the odds of infection. In Section 2, we have
spent a lot of effort to statistically learn how the log-odds of infection βt depends on
the stochastic epidemic model with mobility controls using an empirical dataset. We,
therefore, set the public health target as minimizing the expected log-odds of infection:
min E[βt ], at a future time t. In other words, the public health risk is set as the expected
future log-odds of inflection. In fact, the log-odds of infection is an increasing function
of the infection rate but it is more sensitive to the change in social distancing policy,
facilitating the numerical optimization efficiency.
We model the economic health as the stability of the economic value associated with
the epidemic model and social distancing policy. With the predicted S&P 500 index price
over the COVID-19 crisis period, we statistically learn the economic value in SPX as
d t = κ̂0 + κ̂> αt + κ̂I It + κ̂R Rt + κ̂D Dt ,
SPX

(5)

where κ̂0 , κ̂, κ̂I , κ̂R , and κ̂D appear in Table 4. The economic health risk is the tracking
error between the COVID-19 driven economic growth and a reasonable growth. Mathematically, the tracking error reads
!2

2
d t − SPX
d0
SPX
d
− rt
∝ SPXt − Targett ,
d0
SPX
d 0 (1 + rt ) is the target economic
where rt is the target growth rate and Targett = SPX
value. A reasonable growth rate rt could be the risk-free interest rate, the inflation rate,
or GDP growth rate etc. However, when t is small for the case of near future, all of the
target rates are close to zero. In fact, minimizing the expected tracking error with rt = 0
aims to reducing the risk of significant economic downturn without emphasising on the
economic growth.
10

Therefore, our conceptual framework of integrating public health and economic health
in (4) is modelled through the (running) cost functional:
d t − Targett )2 ,
c(t, Xt , λ; αt ) = βt + λ(SPX

(6)

where Xt := (It , Rt , Dt , βt , γt , δt )> . In reality, a policymaker seldom considers the effect on
a single future day but rather a period of future time h. For instance, if the policymaker
considers the projection for 5 working days in a week, then h = 5, which is also the
choice of our numerical study. Therefore, we formulate and quantify the efficient social
distancing problem (4) into a stochastic control problem:
" t+h

s=t+1 satisfies (1) and (3), SPXt satisfies (5),

s.t.

where the cost functional c is given in (6), and As is the feasible set of mobility controls
determined at time s. As discussed before, the mobility indices are highly correlated
with each other. We characterize As using principal component analysis (PCA). This enhances the searching efficiency of the computation without sacrificing reasonable feasible
controls. The idea is to use the historical data of the mobility indices to determine the
transformation from indices α to their PCs: P = Âα, where Â ∈ R6×6 is a matrix to be
estimated. We then compute the historical PCs, P ∈ R6 , and determine the lower and
upper bounds of each entry of the historical PCs, namely L̂ ∈ R6 and Û ∈ R6 , respectively. The definition of α requires that each entry of the α falls in the range of [−1, 1].
Let Ât , L̂t , and Ût be the estimates using the data up to time t. Then the feasible set As
at time s ∈ [t, t + h − 1] is given by
As := {αs (ws ) : R30 → R6 | L̂t ≤e Ât αs ≤e Ût and − 1 ≤e αs ≤e 1},

(8)

where ≤e is the entry-wise less-than-or-equal-to operator and 1 = (1, . . . , 1)> ∈ R6 .
Note that the feasible set (8) is an approximation of the full feasible set. However, our
numerical studies show that it works well in practice and the ESDPs found are close to
some realized mobility indices.
To incorporate the PC constraints on αs into the objective function, we use a Lagrangian approach such that the revised cost is

that the optimal controls we learned strictly satisfy all of the constraints. Cross-validation
is a classic and well-received machine learning and statistical learning technique to identify
the most useful opportunity set.
We solve (7) numerically by the deep learning framework in Tsang & Wong (2020) .
The implementation procedure is detailed in Appendix B.

Results and discussion

Figure 1 presents the ESDF for the week containing Jun 29, 2020 by setting the target
daily increment rate as 0. In other words, we want the COVID-19 driven economic
value found in the S&P 500 index to stay near the initial economic level calibrated
on Jun 26 2020, in the upcoming week. To draw a better interpretation, the y−axis
of Figure 1 is P
the aggregated infection rate which is transformed from the log-odds of
infection as σ( 5h=1 βt+h /5) whereas the x−axis is the tracking error of the COVID-19
driven economic value. To match the order of magnitude between the infection rate and
the tracking error, we report the tracking error (TE) in terms of root mean square error
(RMSE) in returns. Specifically,

In Figure 1, the shaded area above the ESDF is the region of epidemic-economic outcomes
from the set of feasible social distancing strategies. The lower bullet shape ESDF curve
is drawn by varying the λ. A sensitivity analysis of the ESDF against the target rate rt
is shown in Figure 2. It is clear that a reasonable choice of rt does not materially affect
the ESDF, which consistently maintains a lower bullet-shape curve.

Efficient social distancing Figure 2: ESDF with different increment rates

To better describe our empirical results, we introduce an empirical quantity for measuring the efficiency of a social distancing policy. For any feasible social distancing policy
illustrated as a point inside the feasible set in Figure 1, we can search for the intersection point (TE∗ , infection rate∗ ) between the ESDF and the straight line connecting the
feasible point and the origin. The intersection point is referred to as the benchmarking
ESDP point. For any feasible social distancing policy, we define the public-economic
risk area (PERA) as the product between the infection rate and the TE, illustrated as
the large rectangle in Figure 1. Similarly, we measure the benchmarking ESDP’s PERA
(BEPERA) in the same manner, illustrated as the small rectangle. Hence, the efficiency
ratio (ER) is defined as
ER =

BEPERA
TE∗ × infection rate∗
=
∈ [0, 1].
PERA
TE × infection rate
12

The greater the ER the higher the efficiency of a feasible social distancing policy. Clearly,
ESDP has ER equal to 100%. Figure 3 displays the ESDPs for the validation dataset from
Figure 3: US mobility index controls. The shaded area depicts the range of average efficient mobility controls over the validation data set. The solid line represent the historical
mobility.

June 8, 2020 to June 26, 2020. We set rt = 0 and compute the ESDP for λ ∈ (0.001, 0.1).
We highlight that the computed ESDPs all satisfy the PC constraints on the control. We
aim to visualize the efficiency of historical social distancing by benchmarking against our
ESDPs in Figure 3. The top panel of the graph shows the weekly ESDFs (the curves),
historical epidemic-economic points (corresponding to historical social distancing policies)
and the benchmarking ESDPs, over four weeks in June, 2020. In this way, we can compute
the ERs for these four weeks. We recognize by inspection and, in fact, the ER number
also shows that the first week’s policy is the most efficient one among the four. In fact,
the ER numbers for the four weeks are 91.13%, 43.77%, 46.99% and 21.92%, respectively.
The ER trend implies that the historical social distancing is losing its efficiency in this
particular month.
The second panel of Figure 3 shows the trend of historical active infections per population over the four weeks in June, 2020. We recognize a mild decreasing trend in the
first week. However, the increasing trend begins in the second week and the number of
13

active infected cases keeps increasing in the rest of the month. This seems related to the
efficiency of the social distancing scheme.
The third panel of Figure 3 reports the historical mobility indices, namely RR, GP, PA,
TS, WP and RE, and the ESDPs. Solid lines are the realized historical mobility indices
in the dataset. The historical indices are typically more volatile over the weekends than
weekdays. Therefore, we only report the results for weekdays (working days). Although
all of the historical mobility indices are seemingly stable over the month, we recognize
slight increases in RR and TS, and a clear rising trend in PA in the last three weeks
when compared to the situation in the first week, indicating certain level of relaxation
in mobility. The shaded area in each mobility index represents the range of ESDPs
for λ ∈ (0.001, 0.1). The dash lines are those from the recommended ESDP, which is
obtained as follows. We use the mobility indices from the last Friday and compute the
(TE, infection rate) of the current week from the training sample. Then, we find the λ
by which the ESDP offers the same TE. Such an ESDP is our recommended ESDP. The
intent of doing so aims to maintain the same level of economic risk while pulling down the
infection rate to the efficient level. It can be seen from Figure 3 that the first week’s policy
is very close to the recommended ESDP. In the following weeks, the recommended ESDP
suggests to reduce mobilities in all areas except for RE. It seems that the data-driven
ESDP computed from our algorithm provides a reliable reference for social distancing
policymakers.

Conclusion

This paper leverages the community mobility reported by Google to model the infection
process of COVID-19 and the economy of a country. Using the US COVID-19 data, we
found that the fittings of a stochastic SIRD model are significantly improved with mobility
indices and during the pandemic crisis, the explanatory power of the mobility indices on
the market index (S&P 500 index) is high. Our stochastic modeling of US COVID-19
allows us to simulate the possible scenarios given certain mobility in the future and thus
we can verify the effectiveness of a social distancing policy. Moving forward, this paper
also provides efficient social distancing policies by solving a dynamic stochastic control
problem, where we initiate an objective integrating economic health and public health.
Such a realistic problem is posed with analytical challenges while we manage to solve
it with a deep-learning approach. The results are informative and the policymakers can
refer to the model’s suggestion to design the social distancing policy.

A

The responses to COVID-19 and their implications in simulation studies

The SIRD model (1) with stochastic processes of (3) can be used to describe the evolution
of the infectious disease in the country. In this subsection, we conduct simulation studies
to analyze some scenarios of COVID-19 in US.
Note that the daily mobility indices of a country are random and different indices are
highly correlated with each other. It is very difficult to fix the community mobility α as an
arbitrary vector. In this subsection, we investigate the real historical data of the mobility
and investigate how certain real mobility affect the evolution of the COVID-19. We are

14

focused on some representative mobility in the past. For different measures of social
distancing and restriction of public gatherings by the government, they will be reflected
on the community mobility. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the US government has
made different responses to the coronavirus situation over different periods; see Cheng
et al. (2020); Roser et al. (2020). Based on the government’s responses, we consider
four periods and we take the median mobility indices as the representative community
mobility in each period; see Table 5.
Table 5: The median mobility indices over different periods with different major measures
by the government.

α(0) := (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)>
α(1) := (0.07, 0.02, 0.12, 0.02, 0.02, −0.01)>
α(2) := (0.055, 0.09, 0.15, −0.045, −0.015, 0.01)>
α(3) := (−0.3, −0.07, 0.06, −0.42, −0.4, 0.15)>

Next, we simulate the SIRD model (1) and (3) with parameters estimated on Jun
21 and the mobility indices listed in Table 5. Although the mobility indices are merely
median values, we found that α(1) , α(2) , and α(3) are close to the mobility indices of Feb
27, Mar 10, and May 6, respectively, in terms of Euclidean distance. For each community
mobility, we conduct 10,000 simulations and compute the median curves of I, R, and D
over the subsequent one year (Jun 22, 2020 – Jun 21, 2021). The 0.45- and 0.55-quantile
curves are also included to visualize the volatility of the curves. The results are presented
in Figure 4 with different mobility controls.
From Figure 4, we can see that with the mobility chosen from Jan 3 to Mar 18, 2020,
there would be many infectious cases and deaths. With the baseline mobility, more than
90% of people in US will be infected. With the responses in early March, the infectious
cases and deaths are reduced but are still of a large magnitude. While the infectious
cases and deaths are significantly reduced with the mobility of α(3) , the COVID-19 can
be contained by the end of 2020.
We can also observe that the variances of I, R, and D are time-inhomogeneous.
Specifically, their variances are positively correlated with the current infectious cases I.
It can be explained by noting the specification of the SIRD model (1). Hence, controlling
the mobility not only lowers the infection rate but also stabilizes the coronavirus situation.

B

Deep-learning solution

Such a complicated multi-objective stochastic optimal control problem in (7) does not
admit an explicit analytical solution. It should be solved numerically and a promising
computational approach is deep learning through an appropriate deep neutral network
(DNN). As the DNN is closely related to the Markov decision process (MDP). We transform the stochastic control problem (7) into a discrete-time MDP considered in Tsang &
Wong (2020). More specifically, we write the problem as follows
Vt (w) =
s.t.

min

αs ∈As , s=t,...,t+h−1

J(t, Xt ; {αs }t+h−1

ws = φ(ws−1 , αs−1 (ws−1 ), ηs ), s = t + 1, · · · , t + h, wt = w,

where ws := (Xs , α

and adding αs ; ηs := (Zs , Zs , Zs ) ∈ R is a vector of noisy information at time s. The
model is fully characterized by the state variable ws and thus the optimal control αs
depends only
P on the current state ws . To simplify notation, we define the cumulative
cost Cτλ = τs=t+1 cλ (s, Xs , λ; αs−1 ) for t + 1 ≤ τ ≤ t + h, where cλ is defined in (9). In
the following, we detail the deep-learning solution to the MDP (10). In fact, our deeplearning solution agrees with that proposed in Tsang & Wong (2020), which establishes
the theoretical convergence guarantee of their deep-learning solution and demonstrates
the computation up to 100 dimensions. Our problem also encounters high-dimensionality

16

but only of 30 dimensions, including the moving average controls. As mentioned before,
the optimal control α is a function of current state w. We represent this dependence by a
multilayer feedforward neural network (FNN) with L hidden layers in the following form:
ws ∈ R30 → gsL+1 (θs ) ∈ R6 → αs ,

s = t, · · · , t + h − 1,

(11)

where θs denotes the parameters of the network. Let DL = {g L+1 (θ) : R30 → R6 } be the
class of functions computed by the standard FNN. DL can be represented as follows:
g0 = w
g ` = σ` (B `−1 g `−1 + M `−1 ), ` = 1, · · · , L,
g L+1 = B L g L + M L ,

(12)

where σ` (·) are non-linear activation functions, B ` is the matrix weight and M ` is the
vector bias θ = (B ` , M ` )L`=0 . In this FNN, g 0 ∈ R30 is the input layer and g L+1 ∈ R6 is the
output layer, {g ` }L`=1 are hidden layers for which the nonlinear activation functions are
applied. There are many possible choices of activation functions σ` (·), such as the tanh
activation function, rectified linear unit (ReLU), and the softmax activation function.
To impose control bounds at the last step, we apply tanh(x) := 1+e2−2x − 1 ∈ [−1, 1]
to the output layer g L+1 element-wisely. The class of the control functions computed by
(11) at time s ∈ [t, t + h − 1] is defined as
Gs = {αs : R30 → R6 : αs (ws ; θs ) = tanh(gsL+1 ), gsL+1 ∈ DL }.

(13)

As we consider feedback control policies α ∈ G, the relaxed problem becomes
Vt∗ (w) =

(14)

We remark that the approximation of Vt (w) by Vt∗ (w) is consistent with Tsang & Wong
(2020). Based on the above relaxed problem, the DNN architecture is illustrated as
follows.
We would like to stress that our empirical computation has PC constraints on αs for
enhancing the computational efficiency. In other words, we optimize the cumulative cost
λ
C t for which we perform cross-validation to identify the best fit penalty coefficients λi for
i = 1, 2, · · · , 6. With the architecture above, we sample {ηs }t+h
s=t+1 as the input data and
train the DNN with standard stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method. The training
algorithm can be easily implemented using common libraries (e.g., TensorFlow Abadi
et al. (2015)).
We use Keras in TensorFlow to implement our algorithm with the Adam optimizer
Kingma & Ba (2015) to optimize parameters. For the architecture of the FNN, we set
the number of hidden layers to 2, i.e, L = 2. We choose the ReLU as our activation
function for the hidden layers. We set the number of neurons for each hidden layer to 64,
the initial learning rate to 0.0001. The model is trained with 20,000 simulated training
samples for 100 times. After training, a set of simulated testing samples is applied to the
model to obtain a set of optimized controls.
