Abstract—In the last decade, humanity has faced many different pandemics such as SARS, H1N1, and presently novel
coronavirus (COVID-19). On one side, scientists are focusing on
vaccinations, and on the other side, there is a need to propose
models that can help us in understanding the spread of these
pandemics as it can help governmental and other concerned
agencies to be well prepared, especially from pandemics, which
spreads faster like COVID-19. The main reason for some epidemic turning into pandemics is the connectivity among different
regions of the world, which makes it easier to affect a wider
geographical area, often worldwide. In addition, the population
distribution and social coherence in the different regions of the
world is non-uniform. Thus, once the epidemic enters a region,
then the local population distribution plays an important role.
Inspired by these ideas, we proposed a mobility-based SIR model
for epidemics, which especially takes into account pandemic
situations. To the best of our knowledge, this model is first of its
kind, which takes into account the population distribution and
connectivity of different geographic locations across the globe.
In addition to presenting the mathematical proof of our model,
we have performed extensive simulations using synthetic data
to demonstrate our model’s generalizability. To demonstrate the
wider scope of our model, we used our model to forecast the
COVID-19 cases for Estonia.

I. I NTRODUCTION
In this modern age, pandemics are not a rare phenomenon.
As in the last decade, we have seen several pandemics such
as H1N1, SARS, EBOLA, and presently in 2020 humanity
is facing its biggest crisis due to COVID-19. The severity
of these pandemics can be understood by the death toll
claimed by them. According to WHO, the pandemic H1N1/09
virus resulted in 18,036 deaths [1]. On the other hand, the
CDC estimate between 151,700 to 575,400 deaths due to
the pandemic H1N1/09 virus [2]. Currently, the coronavirus
(COVID-19) pandemic, which started in December 2019 from
Wuhan, China has infected 2,404,249 individuals and claimed
165,229 (as of 20th April 2020) deaths worldwide [3] [4].
Pandemics are different from epidemics in terms of their
geographic spread. An epidemic affects many people at the
same time. It spreads from person to person and remains local
to a specific region. In comparison, when an epidemic engulfs
an entire country, continent, or the whole world, it is termed
as pandemic.

In the past, various models have been proposed for understanding the epidemic spreads. These models can be broadly
classified into two categories, that is agent-based modeling
[5] [6] [7] and compartmental models [8] [9] [10]. The
agent-based modeling is used for simulating the actions and
interactions of autonomous agents as a whole [11]. These
agents can be both individual or collective entities such as
organizations or groups. In contrast, differential equations are
used in compartmental models, where the population is divided
into different compartments such as suspected (S), infected (I),
and recovered (R) [8]. Several other variants of these models
have also been proposed such as SI [12], SIS [13], SIR [8],
SIRS [14], etc.
Compartmental models are often being criticized by the
agent-based model researchers because they struggle to capture the connectivity between different regions of the globe,
and different real-world population characteristic, such as
worldwide population distribution [15] [16]. In this study,
we proposed a mobility-based model, an extension to the
classical SIR based epidemic model, which considers the realworld population distribution across different regions of the
world. Most importantly, the model also takes into account the
connectivity factor among various regions of the world, which
is the key cause in accelerating the process of transforming
epidemics into pandemics. We model the regions in a 2dimensional lattice, where each cell represents the mobility
parameter (or direct connectivity) from one region to another.
Along with presenting the mathematical proof of our model,
we have performed extensive simulations on synthetic data
and forecast the COVID-19 cases in Estonia1 by inferring
the interaction among individuals through call data records
between Estonian counties to demonstrate the model’s ability
to generalize on different types of data.
The proposed model is composed of (local) transmission
rate of the infection β and to cover the mobility aspect, we
introduce parameters: 1) ‘α’ which is a social connectivity parameter that signifies how well individuals are socially linked
with each others, and 2) ‘c(i,j) ’ that represents individuals
mobility from some region j to another region i. Thus, the
infection can transfer within the region with the transmission
rate β and can also be introduced from other regions through

Fig. 1: Local And Global Transmission Of Infection : Each
cell represents a separate region with some population density
(here regions are 1 to 16). Individuals in each cell are colorcoded: Black (Susceptible), Red (Infected) and Green (Recovered). The local transmission rate of infection is β for all cells.
For region 6, it’s social connectivity with other regions is α.
The mobility of individuals from region 4 to region 6 and
fraction of infected individual at region 4 are represented as
c(6, 4) and I(4) respectively. Therefore, infection can transfer
from region 4 to 6 via global transmission rate αc(6, 4)I(4)β.
Similarly, αc(6, 13)I(13)β and αc(6, 16)I(16)β signifies the
global transmission rate from region 13 and 16 respectively to
region 6.

global transmission rate which depends upon α, c(i,j) , Ij
(fraction of infected at region j) and β. With the help of Figure
1, we illustrate our proposed model for better understanding.
We applied our model on synthetic network as well as on a
real network of Estonia considering the population density and
the connectivity among counties, which is created using call
data records (CDR) to investigate the following questions:
•

•

•

•

How social connectivity parameter ‘α’ affects the fraction
of individuals in different compartments (susceptible,
infected and recovered) during a pandemic? We address
this question by carefully examining the effect of α while
keeping all the other parameters constant (Section IV-B).
What are the outcomes of restricting mobility from the
top-X percentile of strongly connected regions? We explore the outcomes of mobility restriction with the model
and found that restricting the mobility of top-10 percentile
of connected regions can reduce the number of infected
individuals between 18% to 27% (Section IV-B).
What is the relationship between social connectivity parameter ‘α’ and mobility restriction (of top-X percentile)
of strongly connected regions? To address this question,
we performed numerical simulation on the proposed
mean-field equations (Section IV-B, Figure 4).
How efficiently this model can perform in real scenarios?
We answer this question by projecting the expected

COVID-19 cases in Estonia using the model and compared the results with the real cases (Section IV-B3).
The limitation of classical compartmental epidemiological
models is that they do not take into account the importance of
reducing social connectivity (or isolation) and the significance
of mobility restriction during the spreading of a pandemic such
as COVID-19. This limitation is overcome in the proposed
model. We found that the reproduction number R0 for a
pandemic depends upon the social connectivity and mobility parameter. We also discovered that during a pandemic,
restricting mobility reduces the fraction of individuals in an
infected compartment and reducing the social connectivity
(or isolation) delays the peak and also reduces the number
of infected individuals from the pandemic. We believe that
this model can help to adopt a balanced strategy to address a
pandemic crisis.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Next, we
discuss related works with respect to epidemic modeling.
We then describe the model preliminaries and derivations in
Section III. Section IV presents the evaluation results of our
model and we conclude with a discussion of future directions
in Section V.
II. R ELATED W ORK
In this section, we discuss relevant literature with respect
to epidemic modeling which involves two different lines of
work. First involving agent-based modeling and the second
using compartmental based modeling. In the agent-based
modeling, authors model epidemics by simulating the actions
and interactions of autonomous agents (both individual or
collective entities such as organizations or groups) with a
view of assessing their effects on the system as a whole [11]
by using transportation systems such as road networks [16],
airways [15] etc. These models have been used for understanding various epidemics such as smallpox [17], influenza [18],
cholera [19], and very recently about COVID-19 [15].
In contrast to agent-based modeling, a differential equation based compartmental models have also been used for
understanding epidemics, which is the basis of this work. This
line of literature is mainly based on the classical SIR model
proposed by Kermack and McKendrick [8] followed by [20]
[21]. In [20], the authors considered the host population as
a dynamic variable rather than constant, as conventionally
assumed, which provides a broader understanding of the
population behavior during infectious disease. In their work in
[21], authors discuss the idea of the basic reproductive rate,
threshold about host densities, and modes of transmission.
Different variations of SIR model have also been proposed to capture various real-world scenarios. For example,
introducing a delay in the model to capture the incubation
period during the spreading [22]–[25] or the introduction of
interventions such as antiviral drugs [26]. In a different work
to represent non-linear nature of epidemic spread, a SIR rumor
spreading model was proposed in which tie strengths were
dependent on nodes’ degree [27]. Apart from SIR based
models, there exist different flavors of compartmental models,

sical SIR model as follows:
ds(t)

(1)
dt
di(t)
= βs(t)i(t) − µi(t)
(2)
dt
dr(t)
= µi(t)
(3)
dt
where, s(t), i(t), r(t) is the fraction of susceptible, infected
and recovered population at time t. However, the classical
SIR epidemic model does not consider the heterogeneity
and topology of the real-world network. To overcome this
limitation, we introduce the mobility and social connectivity
parameters in our proposed model.
Let, ‘l’ represents the total number of locations and ‘c’
denotes the connection (or individuals’ mobility) between
locations. The propagation of infection at each location is
explained as: Each healthy individual can get the infection
either from an infected individual located in the same location
(local transmission) or from an individual visiting from other
connected locations (global transmission). The local transmission rate of infection is represented by β and the recovery rate
as µ and, β and µ ∈ [0,1]. In the next section, we discuss the
local transmission of infection and then the global transmission
is discussed in detail in the Section III-B.

which represent different scenarios such as SIS [13], where
individuals do not recover and can become susceptible again.
This model has also been studied using varying types of
underlying topologies [28].
A set of works has also focused on exhibiting the epidemic spreading by using varying types of underlying network
structures. For example, authors in [29], [30] and [31]
used a scale-free network and in [32] a small-world evolving
networks for evaluating their epidemiological framework. In
their work in [33], authors combine a discrete, stochastic SEIR
(E stands for exposed) model with a three-scale community
network model to demonstrate that the different regional trends
may be explained by different community mixing rates. A
detailed study with respect to various epidemic models on
varying topologies has been done in [34].
In another line of work, authors proposed models to understand epidemics based on the speed of growth. For example, in
[35], authors applied their generalized-growth model to characterize the ascending phase of an outbreak on 20 different epidemics. Their findings revealed that sub-exponential growth is
a common phenomenon, especially for pathogens that are not
airborne. In another work [36], researchers explain the rapid
spread of H1N1 in 2009 around the world by using a flexible
Bayesian, space–time, Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR)
modeling approach. [37] developed a simulation model of a
pandemic (H1N1) 2009 outbreak in a structured population
using demographic data from a medium-sized city in Ontario
and epidemiologic influenza pandemic data. In comparison
to previous works, the proposed model introduces mobility
and social connectivity parameters, the key characteristics for
turning epidemics into pandemics.

A. Local Transmission
Let, Ni be the population at location i, where i ∈ l and
the total population is divided into three compartments. The
compartments for location i at time t are as follows:
1) Si (t): the number of individuals susceptible or not yet
infected. This compartment is referred as susceptible
compartment.
2) Ii (t): the number of infected individuals which can
further spread the disease to the individuals present
in the susceptible compartment. This compartment is
referred to as infected compartment.
3) Ri (t): the number of individuals who have been recovered from infected compartment. This compartment is
referred as recovered compartment.
Our assumptions regarding the transmission of an individual
from one compartment to another compartment are as follows:
1) A healthy individual after becoming infected moves
from susceptible to the infected compartment.
2) An individual can recovered spontaneously at any time
with the recovery rate µ. The recovery of an individual
is independent of healthy and infected compartment
individuals.
3) Once the individual gets recovered, it will become
immune to the disease and thus, will not transmit the
infection to individuals in the susceptible compartment.
4) In addition, this model ignores the demography that is
birth or death of individuals. Therefore, the population
remains constant.
B. Global Transmission
Let, j (j ⊂ l) represents a set P
of locations, which are
connected to location i. Therefore, j Nj is the maximum
possible number of individuals connected to location i, from

Where, Eq. 4 describes the rate of change of susceptible
individuals at location i, and Eq. 5 refers to rate of change

of recovered individuals at location i. Please refer Table I for
notations and their meaning.
C. Dynamical Behaviour Of The Model
Eq. (4-6) represents nonlinear dynamical system of pandemic spreading, where at any time t,
Si (t) + Ii (t) + Ri (t) = Ni (t)

(7)

In order to solve mean-field Eq. (4-6), following assumptions are made (Please note that these assumptions are not
considered during our experiments):
1) Initially, the population at all locations is equal to N(t)
at time t.
2) Individuals in infected compartments
are equal to I(t) at
P
all locations at time t and j Ij = |j|.Ij = kIj , where,
k is the number of locations connected to location i, that
is, k = |j|.
3) The mobility of individuals from one location to another
location is a fraction of total population N . Let, the sum
of fraction of population mobility from |k| locations is n.
Then, the total individuals mobility
from set of locations
P
j to i is n ∗ N . Therefore, j ci,j = nN .
By considering the above assumptions, Eq. 4 and 6 can be
written as

In case there is no social connectivity to other locations
(α = 0 or k = 0 or n = 0) then the mobility SIR model will
become the standard SIR model and the reproduction number
is R0 = βµ . Therefore, the reproduction number is directly
proportional to social connectivity parameter α, number of
connected locations k and depends upon individuals’ mobility
during a pandemic.

For the analysis, we created an aggregated flow matrix of
individuals per day from Origin to Destination (OD), which
follows random distribution. Furthermore, three different techniques are considered for selecting the seed infection location:
1) Pandemics origin from a random location: In this, a
random location is selected as seed infection location
and a small fraction of individuals were infected at that
location.
2) Pandemics origin from a weakly connected location:
Here, seed location is selected strategically, which is
weakly connected to other locations. That implies least
mobility of individuals from this location to other locations.
3) Pandemics origin from a strongly connected location: In
this also, seed location is selected strategically, which
is strongly connected to other locations. This signifies
that, highest mobility of individuals from this location
to other locations.
Our simulation is oriented towards addressing the following
questions:
• How social connectivity parameter ‘α’ affects the fraction of individuals in different compartments (susceptible,
infected and recovered) during a pandemic?
• What are the outcomes of restricting the mobility (for
top-X percentile) of strongly connected locations?
• What is the relationship between social connectivity parameter ‘α’ and the mobility restriction (top-X percentile
of strongly connected locations?
• How efficiently this model can perform in real scenarios?
We answer this question by projecting the expected
COVID-19 cases in Estonia.
B. Results
We perform various simulation experiments to explain the
proposed model on OD network by using previously discussed
techniques for selecting the seed infection location. It is to
be noted that, if α = 0, then the model will behave as
a standard SIR model. Also, if the mobility is reduced to
100 percentile (that is no mobility allowed) from strongly
connected locations, then also model will act as a standard
SIR model.
1) Pandemics Origin From a Random Location: Fig. 2
displays the influence of the social connectivity parameter
’α’ while retaining the other parameters constant. Fig. 2a
to 2f shows the pandemic dynamics with different values of
α starting with α = 1 to α = 0.1. We observe that the
peak of the infected compartment decreases significantly, as

peak. Furthermore, we analysed the number of days required
to reach the point where highest fraction of individuals get
infected (see Figure 5). This indicates that mobility restrictions
and minimal social contact will postpone the pandemic’s peak
and will give sufficient time for the preparations especially for
the health sector.

the α decreases, and it also takes longer to reach its peak.
This indicates that there is a positive impact of lock-down in
controlling a pandemic.
The effect of restricting the mobility from the top-X percentile of highly connected locations with other locations
is shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3a to 3d displays the pandemic
dynamics with different percentile of mobility restrictions of
highly connected locations starting with 0% to 30% (keeping
α = 0.5). We observe that in case of pandemic, restricting
the mobility from the top-10 percentile of highly connected
locations can reduce the number of individuals who can get
infected to 27%. Therefore, quarantine plays a vital role during
pandemics.
In order to understand the relationship between α and
mobility restriction from strongly connected locations, we performed the numerical simulation of the proposed mean-field
equations (see Figure 4). We can infer that social connectivity
parameter ‘α’ and mobility both plays an important role during
pandemics. Therefore, it is advisable to follow a dual strategy
approach during a pandemic outbreak as controlling mobility
reduces the fraction of infected individuals and α delays the

2) Pandemics Origin From a Weakly and Strongly Connected Locations: Fig. 6 displays the influence of the social communication parameter ’α’ while keeping the other
parameters constant for both weakly and strongly connected
locations. Fig. 6a to 6l shows the pandemic dynamics with
different values of α starting with α = 1 to α = 0.1.
It can be noted that when a pandemic originates from a
weakly connected location, it takes longer to reach its peak
compared to when it starts from a strongly connected location.
This shows that location of origin also plays an important
role during pandemic. Similar to random location, reducing
mobility from the highly connected locations by 10 percentile
can reduce the number of infected individuals between 18%
to 27% for weakly and strongly connected locations.
3) Case Study Of Estonia: To demonstrate the usability of
the model, we applied it on a real-time data of Estonia’s to fit
COVID-19 cases. Fig. 7 shows the actual number of cases and
the cases forecast by the model using different values for α
and mobility percentile. For example, when alpha = 0.95, this
indicates that social connectivity of individuals are reduced
by 5% and also top-5% of strongly connected locations are
restricted from mobility. Similarly, α = 0.7, implies that
social connectivity of individuals are reduced by 30% and also
the top-30% of strongly connected locations have introduced
restricted mobility.
For simulation, we created the OD matrix between counties
of Estonia using call data records [38]. Furthermore, these call
interactions are converted into population mobility between
counties using Estonian population data [39]. For the local
transmission of the virus (within the county), we consider the
reproduction number R0 = 2.5 [40].

Cases reported until 11th March, 2020 are considered as
initial condition for the model. The reason behind selecting
11th March, 2020 as initial condition is that, till this date
no local transmission of the virus was reported2 . Till the day
of initial condition, the Estonian Health Board confirmed 13
cases in Harju and two cases in Tartumaa and Saaremaa
each3 . During the simulation, the number of cases in all
other counties are initialized to zero. The infection rate β and
recovery rate µ are adjusted according to the value of R0 for
COVID-19. By 10th April 2020, reported cases in Estonia
and forecast cases using the model are shown in Fig. 7. It
can be noticed that the model predicted much higher cases of
COVID-19 if no restrictions are introduced (α = 1). However,
as the restrictions were introduced by the Government4 the
number of cases got damped (Actual). Thus, the applicability
of this model is to forecast a range of predicted number of
cases which can help the governmental and health agencies to
understand the impact and introduce proportional interventions
to restrict the spread of the epidemic.

Fig. 6: Pandemic Origin From Weak and Strongly Location:
Effect of Social Connectivity Parameter ‘α’

Classical compartmental epidemic models are unable to describe the spreading pattern of pandemics such as COVID-19
as they do not take into account the effect of social connectivity
and mobility in spreading of the virus. Our proposed mobility
based SIR model shows the significance of social connectivity
and mobility during pandemics by taking into consideration
the local and the global transmission rate of the infection.
We have simulated the proposed model considering three
different origins of the infection, namely random location,
weakly connected location and strongly connected location.
Our simulation shows that limiting the social connectivity
reduces and delays the peak of the infected compartment.

4 https://www.valitsus.ee/en/news

Our analysis also shows that restricting the mobility from
the top-10 percentile of connected locations can reduce the
number of infected individuals between 18% to 27%. From
the mathematical proof for our proposed model, we obtained
that the reproduction number R0 directly depends upon social
connectivity of individuals, number of connected locations
and individuals mobility between locations which is in line
with our simulations’ results. This indicates that introducing
isolation and quarantine is effective in fighting a pandemic
crisis. Using the proposed model, we also simulated the real
world scenario by considering the COVID-19 cases in Estonia.
Simulation reveals that the mobility based SIR model can be
helpful to forecast the expected number of cases after some
proportion of isolation and quarantine is introduced in the
society.
We plan to include various future directions for this work
such as by simulating the model using additional dynamic networks. Another direction would be to use additional mobility
data such as transportation network for better understanding
the pandemic behavior. Importantly, we plan to introduce
infection delay and recovery delay simultaneously in our future
studies.
