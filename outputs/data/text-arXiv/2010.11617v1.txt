Abstract
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a severe ongoing novel pandemic that has emerged in Wuhan,
China, in December 2019. As of October 13, the outbreak has spread rapidly across the world,
affecting over 38 million people, and causing over 1 million deaths. In this article, I analysed
several time series forecasting methods to predict the spread of COVID-19 second wave in Italy,
over the period after October 13, 2020. I used an autoregressive model (ARIMA), an exponential
smoothing state space model (ETS), a neural network autoregression model (NNAR), and the
following hybrid combinations of them: ARIMA-ETS, ARIMA-NNAR, ETS-NNAR, and
ARIMA-ETS-NNAR. About the data, I forecasted the number of patients hospitalized with mild
symptoms, and in intensive care units (ICU). The data refer to the period February 21, 2020–
October 13, 2020 and are extracted from the website of the Italian Ministry of Health
(www.salute.gov.it). The results show that i) the hybrid models, except for ARIMA-ETS, are better
at capturing the linear and non-linear epidemic patterns, by outperforming the respective single
models; and ii) the number of COVID-19-related hospitalized with mild symptoms and in ICU
will rapidly increase in the next weeks, by reaching the peak in about 50-60 days, i.e. in midDecember 2020, at least. To tackle the upcoming COVID-19 second wave, on one hand, it is
necessary to hire healthcare workers and implement sufficient hospital facilities, protective
equipment, and ordinary and intensive care beds; and on the other hand, it may be useful to enhance
social distancing by improving public transport and adopting the double-shifts schooling system,
for example.

1. Introduction
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a severe ongoing novel pandemic that has officially emerged
in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. As of October 13, 2020, it has affected 215 countries and
territories, with over 38 million cases and approximately 1.1 million deaths (Worldometer, 2020).
At the time of writing, the most affected countries are both advanced and developing countries,
such as Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, France, India, Peru, Russia, Spain, and the USA. In the last
two weeks, several European countries, including Italy, saw a worrying surge of COVID-19
infections.
Italy was the first European country to be severely hit by COVID-19, and it has been one of the
main epicenters of the pandemic for about two months, i.e. from mid-February 2020 to mid-April
2020, when the outbreak reached the first peak. Then, the epidemic curve progressively decreased
until mid-August 2020, and after that the spread of infection re-accelerated again until today. As
of October 13, Italy has suffered 36,246 deaths and 365,467 cases.
The likelihood of a second wave is real and makes it necessary to predict the future epidemic
evolution, in plan to buy medical devices and healthcare facilities, and to manage health centers,
clinics, hospitals, and ordinary and intensive care beds.
Thus, the major goal of this paper is to provide short and mid-term forecasts of the patients
hospitalized from COVID-19 over the period after October 13, 2020. In fact, the COVID-19related hospitalizations trends allow to have a clear picture of the overall stress and pressure on
the national health care system. In particular, I implemented and compared three different time
series forecast techniques and their feasible hybrid combinations: autoregressive moving average
(ARIMA) model, innovations state space models for exponential smoothing (ETS), neural network
autoregression (NNAR) model, ARIMA-ETS model, ARIMA-NNAR model, ETS-NNAR model,
and ARIMA-ETS-NNAR model.
I organized the rest of this paper as follows. In section 2, I quickly discussed the relevant literature.
In section 3, I presented the data used in the analysis and discussed the empirical strategy. In
section 4, I discussed the main findings and policy implications. Finally, in section 5, I provided
some conclusive considerations.
2. Related literature
From the beginning of the 2020, an increasing body of literature has attempted to forecast the
spread of the COVID-2019 outbreak using different approaches (Bhardwaj, 2020; Fanelli and
Piazza, 2020; Giordano et al., 2020; Nesteruk. 2020; Tuite et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020; Xu et al.,
2020; Zhao et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). The most used are ARIMA (Alzahrani et al. 2020;
Benvenuto et al., 2020, Ceylan, 2020; Perone, 2020a & b), ETS (Bhandary et al., 2020; Cao et al.,
2020; Joseph et al., 2020), artificial neural network models (Melin et al., 2020; Wieczorek et al.,
2020), models derived from the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) basic approach (Fanelli and
Piazza, 2020; Giordano et al., 2020; Nesteruk, 2020; Wu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020), and hybrid
models (Chakraborty and Ghosh, 2020; Hasan et al., 2020; Singh et al., 2020; Swaraj et al., 2020).

The implementation and the comparison of them, except for SIR models, represent the core of this
paper. Thus, in table 1, I reported 18 international studies that used single or hybrid ARIMA, ETS,
and neural network to forecast the transmission patterns of COVID-19 across the world.

3. Materials and methods

The data used in this article refer to the real-time number of COVID-19 patients with mild
symptoms and in ICU in Italy from February 21, 2020 to October 13, 2020, for 236 observations.
I extracted the data from the official Italian Ministry of Health’s website (www.salute.gov). The
confirmed COVID-19-related hospitalizations trends are shown in Figure 1.
Data show that both patients hospitalized with mild symptoms and in ICU reached a first peak on
April 4, 2020; after that, they followed a downward trend until mid-August, before re-accelerating
again from the end of September 2020 to mid-October 2020. I compute the forecasts by using
different statistical techniques and their combination. Specifically, I use a univariate linear
autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models, univariate exponential smoothing
state space model (ETS), univariate linear and nonlinear neural network autoregression (NNAR)
models, hybrid ARIMA-ETS model, hybrid ARIMA-NNAR model, and hybrid ETS-NNAR
model.
The combination of different times series forecast methods should allow to maximize the chance
of capturing both the linear (if any) and nonlinear epidemic patterns (Zhang, 2003; Pannigrahi and
Behera, 2017), and it is useful with phenomena like COVID-19 epidemic, which seems
characterized by linear and nonlinear dynamics and components (Batista, 2020, Gupta and Pal,
2020). As well established from the seminal work of Bates and Granger (1969), combining
techniques with unique properties may allow to achieve better performance and forecast accuracy.2
The models are calculated as follows:
ARIMA models are detected by applying the “auto.arima” function included in the
package “forecast” (in R environment) and developed by Hyndman and Khandakar
(2008).3 This function follows sequential steps to identify the best ARIMA models, i.e.
the number of p parameters of the autoregressive process (AR), the order i of differencing
(I), and the number of q parameters of the moving average process (MA).4 It combines
unit root tests, 5 and the minimization of the following estimation methods: the biascorrected Akaike’s information criterion (AICc),6 and the maximum likelihood estimation
(MLE). The unit root tests allow to identify the order of differencing; while the AICc and
the MLE methods allow to identify the optimal parameters of the AR and MA processes.
Finally, the overall goodness of fit is tested by using five common forecast accuracy

A description of the “auto.arima” function is provided by Hyndman and Athanasopoulos (2018, section 8.7).

This definition refers to non-seasonal ARIMA model.
5
I use both the augmented Dickey-Fuller’s test (ADF) (1981) and the Kwiatkowsky, Phillips, Schmidt, and Shin’s
test (KPSS) (1992). In fact, as stated by Gujarati and Porter (2009), there is not a recognized uniformly powerful test
for detecting unit root.
6
The AICc is a bias-corrected version of the original Akaike information criterion (AIC), proposed by Sugiura (1978)
and Hurvich and Tsai (1989), which performs significantly better than the latter in both small and moderate sample
sizes, as in this case (Hurvich and Tsai, 1989).

measures: mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), mean
absolute scaled error (MASE), and root mean square error (RMSE);
ETS models are identified by using the “ets” function included in the package “forecast”
(in R environment), developed by Hyndman et al. (2008).7 ETS simple models comprise
two main equations: a forecast equation and a smoothing equation. By implementing the
last two equations into an innovation state space model, it is possible to get an
observation/measurement equation and a transition/state equation, respectively. The first
equation allows to describe the observed data; while the second equation allows to
describe the behavior of the unobserved states. The states refer to the level, trend, and
seasonality. In particular, I use the AICc metric for choosing the best ETS model. The
goodness of fit is tested by using MAE, MAPE, MASE, and RMSE metrics;
NNAR models are identified by using the “nnetar” function included in the package
“caret” (R environment), developed by Hyndman, O’Hara, and Wang.8 For non-seasonal
data, I can describe NNAR models with the notation NNAR (p,k), where p denotes the
number of non-seasonal lags used as inputs, and k means the number of nodes/neurons in
the hidden layer. NNAR (p,k) is the same as AR process, but with nonlinear functions.
The optimal number of non-seasonal lags is obtained by using the AICc metric, and the
optimal number of neurons is identified by calculating (p+P+1)/2, where p is the nonseasonal AR order, and P is the seasonal AR order (if any). Finally, the goodness of fit is
investigated using MAE, MAPE, MASE, and RMSE metrics;
Hybrid models are identified by using the “hybridModel” function included in the package
“forecastHybrid” (in R environment), developed by Shaub and Ellis.9 To combine the
single time series forecasting methods, I proceed as follows: i) first, I apply the Box-Cox
(1964) power transformation to the inputs to make normality assumption more plausible;
and ii) then, I implement the cross validation errors (“cv.errors”), which allow to give
more weight to the models that perform relatively better, by producing the best forecast;
and iii) finally, MAE, MAPE, RMSE, and Theil’s U are used for validating the weighting
procedure.
The estimated basic equation for ARIMA model is the following (Davidson, 2000):
𝛥𝑑 𝑦𝑡 = 𝜙1 𝛥𝑑 𝑦𝑡−1 + ⋯ 𝜙𝑝 𝛥𝑑 𝑦𝑡−𝑝 + 𝑦1 𝜀𝑡−1 + ⋯ 𝑦𝑞 𝜀𝑡−𝑞 + 𝜀𝑡

Where 𝛥𝑑 the second difference operator, p is the lag order of the AR process, ϕ is the coefficient
of each parameter p, q is the order of the MA process, γ is the coefficient of each parameter q, and
𝜀𝑡 denotes the residuals of errors in time t.
The estimated equations for basic ETS (A,N,N) model with additive error is the following
(Hyndman and Athanasopoulos, 2018, section 7)10:
Forecast equation: 𝑦̂𝑡+1‫𝑡𝑙 = 𝑡 ׀‬

[2]

Smoothing equation: 𝑙𝑡 = 𝑙𝑡−1 + 𝛼(𝑦𝑡 − 𝑙𝑡−1 )

[3]

Where 𝑙𝑡 is the new estimated level, 𝑦̂𝑡+1‫ 𝑡׀‬denotes each one-step-ahead prediction for time t+1,
which results from the weighted average of all the observed data, 0 ≤ 𝛼 ≤ 1 is the smoothing
parameter which controls the rate of decrease of the weights, and 𝑦𝑡 − 𝑙𝑡−1 is the error at time t.
So, each forecasted observation is the sum of the previous level and an error. For each type of
errors, additive or multiplicative, there is a specific probability distribution. For a model with
additive errors, such in this case, it is assumed that errors follow a normal distribution. Thus, the
equations [2] and [3] can be rewritten as follows, respectively:
Observation equation: 𝑦𝑡 = 𝑙𝑡−1 + 𝜀𝑡

[4]

Transition equation: 𝑙𝑡 = 𝑙𝑡−1 + 𝛼𝜀𝑡

[5]

The equations [4] and [5] represent the innovations state space models that underlie the exponential
smoothing methods.
The basic form of the neural network autoregression equation is the following (Hyndman and
Athanasopoulos 2018, section 11.3):
𝑦𝑡 = 𝑓(𝑦𝑡−1 ) + 𝜀𝑡

[6]
′

Where 𝑦𝑡−1 = (𝑦𝑡−1, 𝑦𝑡−2 … , 𝑦𝑡−𝑛 ) is a vector containing the lagged values of the observed data,
f is the neural network with n hidden neurons in a single layer, and 𝜀𝑡 is the error. Finally, the
hybrid models are simple a combination of the described single models.

10

How stated by Hyndman and Athanasopoulos (2018, section 7), the innovations state space models for exponential
smoothing encompass 15 different methods. For each method there are two models: one with additive errors and one
with multiplicative errors, for a total of 30 models. The equation [2] refers to the simplest of the ETS models.

4. Results and discussion
In tables 2, 3, 4 and 5, I reported the main forecast accuracy measures, and the best selected
parameters for the single and hybrid models. For the patients hospitalized with mild symptoms
(Tables 2 and 3), the optimal models are: ARIMA (4,2,4), ETS (A,Ad,N),11 NNAR (4,2), hybrid
ARIMA (4,2,4)-NNAR (7,4), hybrid ARIMA (4,2,4)-ETS (A,Ad,N), hybrid ETS (A,Ad,N)NNAR (7,4), and hybrid ARIMA (4,2,4)-ETS(A,Ad,N)-NNAR (7,4). For the patients hospitalized
in ICU (Tables 4 and 5), the optimal single and hybrid models are: univariate ARIMA (3,2,7),
univariate ETS (A,A,N), NNAR (4,2), hybrid ARIMA(4,2,3)-NNAR(6,4), hybrid ARIMA(4,2,3)ETS(A,A,N), 12 hybrid ETS(A,A,N)-NNAR(6,4), and hybrid ARIMA(4,2,3)-ETS(A,A,N)NNAR(6,4).13
According to Lewis’ interpretation (Lewis 1982, p. 40), since MAPE is always lower than 10, all
the predictive models are highly accurate. In particular, the forecasts show a forecast accuracy
(100-MAPE) ranging from 95.68% to 97.84%. Since MASE and Theil’s U are always and

The selected ETS model is also known as Holt’s linear trend method.

significantly lower than 1, all the proposed forecasting models performed better than the forecasts
from the (no-change) “naïve” methods, i.e. the forecasts with no adjustments for casual factors
(Hyndman and Koehler, 2006). This allows to justify the use of more complex and sophisticated
models, such as ARIMA, ETS, NNAR, and their hybrid combination.
In tables 6 and 7, I compared the single and hybrid models by considering the minimization of
MAE, MAPE, and RMSE. For the patients hospitalized with mild symptoms, hybrid ARIMA-ETS
is better than the respective single models in 2 measures out of 6; the hybrid ARIMA-NNAR and
ETS-NNAR are better than the respective single models in all the accuracy measures; and the
hybrid ARIMA-ETS-NNAR is better than respective single models in 8 measures out of 9. For the
patients hospitalized in ICU, hybrid ARIMA-ETS is better than the single models in 3 measures
out of 6; and hybrid ARIMA-NNAR is better than the respective single models in all the accuracy
measures; ETS-NNAR is better than the respective single models in 5 measures out of 6; and
ARIMA-ETS-NNAR is better than respective single models in 8 measures out of 9.
The most reliable and accurate single and hybrid models are ARIMA and ARIMA-NNAR,
respectively. The results show that hybrid models always outperformed the single models, with
the only exception of ARIMA-ETS. The best models are ARIMA-NNAR, ETS-NNAR, and
ARIMA-ETS-NNAR.
In table 8, I also compute the percentage efficiency gains – in terms of MAE and RMSE
minimization – from using the three best hybrid models. Specifically, hybrid ARIMA-NNAR
outperforms single ARIMA and NNAR models from 1.87% to 8.91% on MAE, and from 4.19%
to 9.47% on RMSE. Hybrid ETS-NNAR outperforms single ETS and NNAR models from 3.01%
to 9.02% on MAE, and from 2.68% to 12.4% on RMSE. Finally, hybrid ARIMA-ETS-NNAR
outperforms single ARIMA, ETS, and NNAR models from 0.69% to 9.61% on MAE, and from
0.1% to 12.4% on RMSE.
In figures 2 to 8, I fit all the seven models for both the time series. The light blue area shows the
prediction interval at 80%, and the dark blue area shows the prediction interval at 95%. The
forecasts of the best models show that the number of patients hospitalized with mild symptoms
and in ICU will significantly increase in the next 45 days, i.e. from October 14, 2020 to November
27, 2020. However, if the number of patients hospitalized with mild symptom will approximately
stabilize between the end of November 2020 and the beginning of December 2020, the number of
patients in ICU will require more time to reach the plateau. This is also confirmed by the other
forecasting methods, except of ETS.
ARIMA-NNAR, ETS-NNAR, and ARIMA-ETS-NNAR show that: i) after 10 days (October 23),
the number of patients hospitalized with mild symptoms will be 8,829, 8,032, or 8,125,
respectively; ii) after 20 days (November 2), they will be 14,038, 12,058, or 11,877; and iii) after
45 days (November 27), they will be 20,795, 14,823 or 16,052. About the number of patients
hospitalized in ICU, ARIMA-NNAR, ETS-NNAR, and ARIMA-ETS-NNAR show that: i) after
10 days, the required intensive care beds will be 1,177, 1,040 or 1,100; ii) after 20 days, they will
be 2,065, 1,446, or 1,829; and iii) after 45 days, they will be 3,320, 1,907 or 3,030.14

The forecasted values are shown in Table A5 (Appendix A).

Thus, a second wave of COVID-19 is expected in the next two months, with a peak in midDecember 2020. This has several policy implications both for the national health care system and
economic activities. In particular, the predictions seem to stress the importance of implementing
adequate containment measures and an increasing number of ordinary and intensive care beds, of
hiring further healthcare personnel, and of buying care facilities, protective equipment, and
ventilators to fight the infection and reduce deaths.15
However, the opportunity of implementing more or less restrictive non-pharmaceutical
interventions (NIP) to tackle the epidemic – such as social distancing, travel ban, the use of face
mask, hand hygiene, and bar and restaurant restrictions (ECDC, 2020) – should be carefully
evaluated because of the negative impact on the overall economic activity. In fact, according to
Fitch Rating’s (2020) previsions, the first wave of COVID-19 and the consequent massive
lockdown measures could have already caused up to 9.5% contraction for the Italian 2020 GDP.
Thus, to avoid new strict lockdown measures and further economic loss, it seems important to
ensure the strict compliance with the basic COVID-19 control measures, such as social distancing,
hand hygiene, and the use of protective equipment, rather than restricting or even closing public
and private economic activities, such as provided by the recent Italian Prime Minister’s Decrees
of October 13, 2020. In fact, if the extension of the national state of emergency is well justified,
the hours restriction for bakery, bar, ice cream shops, pubs, restaurant, and retail trade activities,
and the total closure of all indoor and outdoor dance halls, discos, and similar spaces may seriously
worsen the current Italy’s economic downturn.16
By the contrary, it may be more useful to expand public transport, adopt the double-shifts
schooling system, and isolate older and vulnerable people. Finally, a better balance between public
health, public utility, and freedom of economic initiative is recommended.

This is consistent with my recent paper (Perone, 2021), in which I showed that the Italian health care system
saturation played a key role in explaining the variability of COVID-19 mortality. In particular, ordinary and intensive
care beds saturation allowed to explain almost up to 90% of the COVID-19 mortality, at the first peak of the epidemic.

5. Conclusions
In this paper, I attempted to forecast the short and mid-term dynamics of the real-time patients
hospitalized from COVID-19 in Italy. In particular, I used both single time series forecast methods
and hybrid combinations of them. The results show that: i) the best single and hybrid models are
ARIMA and ARIMA-NNAR, respectively; ii) and hybrid ARIMA-NNAR, ETS-NNAR, and
ARIMA-ETS-NNAR models outperformed the respective single models, by leading to more
accurate and reliable predictions. Thus, hybrid models seem to enhance the chances of capturing
a greater number of combinations of the linear and nonlinear epidemic patterns, compared with
the use of single time series forecasting methods.
Predictions seem also to give useful policy indications. In fact, they show that the number of
patients hospitalized with mild symptoms and in ICU will significantly grow until mid-December
2020, when the second epidemic peak is expected. I predict that the necessary ordinary and
intensive care beds will double in 10 days, and triple in about 20 days. Thus, it is necessary to
strengthen the national health care system by buying protective equipment and hospital beds,
managing health care facilities, and hiring and training healthcare workers.
Finally, the hybrid combination of ARIMA, ETS, and NNAR have proven to be sufficiently
accurate in the short and mid-term. However, the results in the mid-term should be taken with
more caution because of the inevitable uncertainty and bias, which tend to grow over time.
