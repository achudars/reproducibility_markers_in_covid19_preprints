Using the classical Susceptible-Infected-Recovered epidemiological model, an analytical formula
is derived for the number of beds occupied by Covid-19 patients. The analytical curve is fitted to
data in Belgium, France, New York City and Switzerland, with a correlation coefficient exceeding
98.8%, suggesting that finer models are unnecessary with such macroscopic data. The fitting is
used to extract estimates of the doubling time in the ascending phase of the epidemic, the mean
recovery time and, for those who require medical intervention, the mean hospitalization time. Large
variations can be observed among different outbreaks.

I.

INTRODUCTION

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to develop in various parts of the world, the scientific community at large is
producing a massive effort to gather as many information as possible on the nature of virus and its ability to spread.
At the epidemiological level, some parameters are of course particularly desirable to ascertain such as the rate of
infection, β, within a given population and the average time of spontaneous recovery, tR . But perhaps even more
important from a crisis management point of view is to be able to predict how many beds in hospital are needed and
how long they will be occupied. Some estimates are of course already available [1–6], however they usually rest on
the analysis of rather small cohorts. This paper is an attempt to extract such an information from the data made
available in several similar but different contexts: Belgium, France, Italy, Switzerland, and New York City (NYC).
It will be shown that an analytical curve derived from the simplest possible SIR compartment model can be made
to fit remarkably well with the data, with a correlation coefficient ranging from 0.988 in New York City to beyond
0.997 elsewhere. With such good fits, the obtained curves can safely be extrapolated to forecast bed occupation
several weeks in advance. This calls into question the necessity to resort to more complex modelling, involving more
parameters than the SIR model, to confront macroscopic data in the absence of more detailed information [7]. The
study also shows that a great disparity of epidemiological parameters can exist between different countries, despite
their similarities. This reflects both the policies put in places to mitigate local epidemics and also, perhaps, underlines
differences between health systems.
Besides the managerial motivation invoked above, the focus in this study is on the hospitalization dynamics for two
reasons. Firstly, since the beginning of the pandemic, a large uncertainty has been surrounding the number of cases,
as the ability and protocols to test patients varies from one country to the next. Estimates of the number of infected
people, as well as when the epidemics started in a given region appear poorly reliable. By contrast, bed occupation
numbers are easier to monitor. Next, the processes leading to the number of occupied beds are multiple and additive,
leading to a much smoother data than, for instance, the daily numbers of admitted and discharged patients. Hence,
curve fitting is expected to yield more reliable information with hospitalization data. Except for NYC, where the data
is lacking, we will both exploit general bed occupancy and the number of patients in Intensive Care Units (ICU).

MATHEMATICAL MODELLING

The simplest of all epidemiological models is the SIR model, which separates a given population into a set of
susceptible (S), infected (I), and recovered (R) individuals. These populations evolve in time according to
dS
= −βSI/N,
dt
dI
= βSI/N − I/tR ,
dt
dR
= I/tR ,
dt

(1)
(2)
(3)

where S(t) + I(t) + R(t) = N , the size of the population, β is the infection rate and tR is the spontaneous recovery
time. In the majority of countries where confinement measures have been taken, the growing exponential phase of
the local outbreak was stopped well before a sizeable fraction of the population was infected. Hence, thanks to public

2
intervention, I(t), R(t)  N at all time, even if they could reach considerable values. Therefore, one has S(t) ≈ N
and the equation for I(t) becomes, with good approximation,
dI
= (β − 1/tR ) I.
dt

(4)

The effect of confinement and social distancing is to reduce the coefficient β, so that this parameter is a function
of time. For simplicity, we assume that there is a well defined date at which β switches from a large value β0 to a
smaller one, β1 . This, of course, is an approximation, but it appears acceptable since there has been, in most of the
setting considered in this study, a well defined date where the local authority has declared some form of lockdown [8].
Taking, for each outbreak, t = 0 as the time when lockdown started, we thus have
 ct
e , t < 0,
I(t) = I0 × −γt
(5)
e , t > 0.
where c and γ are given by
c = β0 − 1/tR ,

γ = 1/tR − β1

(6)

and are, respectively, the initial growth rate and the late-time decay rate. Equivalent to c, and more convenient to
discuss, is the doubling time td = ln(2)/c during the initial phase of the local outbreak.
In Eq. (5), I0 is the value of I(t) at t = 0, a number difficult to determine with accuracy. Note that all we can learn
from the data of I(t) is c and γ, which is not quite enough to know β0 , β1 and tR . Hopefully, β1 is close to zero, but
in all probability it isn’t. Hence, tR < γ −1 . However, one may hypothesize that the populations involved with the
pandemic in Belgium, France, Switzerland, Italy and New York City all have similar response to the virus, so that
they share the same value tR . Hence, the smallest of the values of γ −1 extracted from these five epidemic events may
count as the best estimation of the upper bound on tR .
Knowing I(t), the evolution of the number of hospitalized patients P (t) is straightforward to model. It obeys the
equation
dP (t)
= αγI(t − τ ) − P (t)/tH ,
dt

(7)

which expresses, simply, that the number of hospitalisations increases at a rate proportional to the number of infected
people and that, once admitted into hospital, the mean time of stay is tH . Above, α is the probability, if infected, to
be hospitalised. In this last Eq., I(t) appears with a delay τ . This delay accounts, for the most part, for the average
time elapsed between being infected and requiring to be hospitalized; additionally, one may conjecture that social
event such as mass gatherings may have further delayed the response to the measures, leading to a larger value of τ .
Combining Eqs. (5) and (7), one derives


P (t) = p ec(t−τ ) 1 − e−(ctH +1)(t−t0 )/tH ,
t < τ,
(8)




ctH + 1  −(t−τ )/tH

− e−γ(t−τ ) ,
t > τ,
(9)
= p 1 − e−(ctH +1)(τ −t0 )/tH e−(t−τ )/tH +
γtH − 1
where t0 is the time of the first hospital admission and where p = αI0 ecτ γtH /(1 + ctH ). Finding p, it would be
particularly interesting to deduce α. Unfortunately, this requires the knowledge of I0 , which we don’t have.
In the same way as for P (t), one may derive an evolution model for the number of occupied beds in Intensive Care
Unit (ICU), PICU (t). The simplest way is to write
dPICU (t)
= αICU γI(t − τ 0 ) − PICU (t)/tICU .
dt

(10)

The above equation neglects intermediate stages between being infected and integrating the ICU. Accordingly, the
evolution of PICU (t) is given by the same expressions as in Eqs. (8) and (9) but with the substitutions tH → tICU ,
τ → τ 0 , and p → pICU .
One may argue that Eqs. (5) to (10) are oversimplified in that the model neglects an intermediate population E(t)
of exposed, not-yet contagious individuals, and that the population PICU should rather be coupled to the larger set
P (t) rather than I(t) as in [3]. In the same vein, we have not separated the population in age categories, even though
this would be highly relevant [9]. However, the attitude in the present paper is to invoke the simplest possible model
in order to exploit simple explicit formulas like Eqs. (8) and (9). As we will see, this yields excellent fit to the data.

DATA AND FIT

Hospitalization data was gathered for
1. Belgium, during the period extending from 2020-03-15 to 2020-05-28 [10]. Official lockdown was imposed on
2020-03-18. The first patient was hospitalized on 2020-02-04.
2. France, during the period extending from 2020-03-18 to 2020-05-28 [11]. Official lockdown was imposed on
2020-03-17. The first patient was hospitalized on 2020-01-24.
3. Italy, during the period extending from 2020-02-24 to 2020-05-28 [12]. Official lockdown was imposed on 202003-9. Estimation of the first hospitalization is 2020-02-07.
4. Switzerland, during the period extending from 2020-02-25 to 2020-05-28 [13]. Containment measures were taken
as of 2020-03-20. First hospitalization was on 2020-02-26.
5. New York City, during the period extending from 2020-02-29 to 2020-05-23 [14]. Stay-at-home order was enforced
on 2020-03-22. Estimation of the first hospitalization is 2020-02-29.
The data sets were analyzed with Mathematica 8.0 using the functions ‘FindFit’ and ‘NonlinearModelFit’. Both
commands allow to obtain parameter set by least-square regression and the latter yields 95% confidence intervals
(CI). One notes that the parameters γ −1 and tH (or tICU ) appear in separate but very similar mathematical terms in
Eq. (9), making these two parameters strongly correlated and rendering their determination ambiguous. For example,
with the french data, the pairs (γ −1 , tH ) ≈ (12, 42) and (γ −1 , tH ) ≈ (42, 12) can be made to yield almost equally
good fit. In order to remove the ambiguity and narrow down 95% CI, one should fix one of these two parameters.
To this end a first round of parameter fitting was carried out for each geographical region in which td , the doubling
time in the initial phase, was varied between 3 and 7. It turned out that there was little ambiguity with Belgian data,
where both γ −1 and tH were close to 16 days. For Italy γ −1 was found to lie between 15 and 21 days, whereas NYC
and Switzerland gave lower values, around 9 days. From this initial investigation, one makes the following informed
guesses: γ −1 (Belgium) = 16, γ −1 (Italy) = 20, γ −1 (NYC, Switzerland) = 9. Finally, for France, one assumes the same
value as in Belgium: γ −1 (France) = 16. What is output as 95% IC in the following should of course be regarded, at
best, as conditional probabilities. They are mere indicators of uncertainty.
Curve fitting was done separately with ICU data.
Given the set of data points (ti , yi ) with mean value ȳ for a given outbreak, the correlation coefficient was computed
as

(P (ti ) − ȳ) (yi − ȳ)

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The comparisons of the analytical curves with the official data is shown in Fig. 1. In all cases, a close fit is obtained
with the analytical formula, with C almost equal to 1. A close inspection of the curves shows that the growth phase
is not purely exponential, meaning that β is not simply a constant β0 during that phase. This was anticipated. The
ranges of values for the various parameters are summarized in Table I. Notable similarities, but also differences, can
be seen from one country/city to another. Below, we highlight some of them.
Belgium and NYC have been exposed to the most rapidly growing outbreaks with doubling time under 4 days;
this is consistent with their high population densities. td was between 4 and 5 days in France and Switzerland, and
between 5 and 6 days in Italy.
Italy, France, and Belgium imposed very similar lockdown measures with very similar restrictions. Their ranges
of values for τ are also similar in their lower bound. However, one clearly sees that the response to the lockdown
measures was delayed by a longer time in Italy and in France than in Belgium. The larger value of τ in Italy than
in France may be due to the fact that lockdown was imposed in two steps: on the 8th of March in the northern
region and the next day to the rest of the country. In the case of France, one recalls that the first round of local
elections took place two days before the lockdown all over the country. Despite precautions, this may have given a
last-minute boost to the outbreak, accounting for the larger values of τ . Ranges of values obtained with ICU data are
systematically shifted towards longer times, indicating an extra delay between the development of severe symptoms
and the further degradation of health condition necessitating ICU care.

The Belgian CI for τ suggests a time from exposition to severe symptoms of 7.9 ± 0.4 days. This appears consistent
with previous reports. In a retrospective study of clinical progression in patients of a single helath center in Shangai
(Jan 20 to Feb 6 2020) Chen et. al report a time from onset of symptoms to hospital of 4 (2-7) days [4], while an
incubation time of 5.1 days (4.5-5.8) has been reported [15, 16].
In all cases where ICU data were available, tICU is significantly less than tH : by approximately 1 day in Belgium,
20 days in France, 8 days in Italy and 5 days in Switzerland. Combining Belgium, Italy and Switzerland, tH lies in
the range 16-22 days. The study in Shanghai (China) reports a similar number for discharge time: 16 days (12-20) [4].
With an hospitalization time of 35 ± 0.7 days, France appears as an outlier. The opposite is seen with NYC data,
which show strikingly shorter average stay at hospital that in the European countries considered. This suggests two
opposite management policies: the former (France as an extreme case) where patients are kept until complete recovery,
the latter (NYC) in which patient are discharged as soon as possible in order to make way for new admissions. The
present fit estimates tH (NYC) = 12.6 ± 1. This is much less than in the other data sets. However, Richardson et al.
conducted a study of 5700 patients hospitalized in NYC area and found even lower values: the overall length of stay
was only 4.1 days (2.3-6.8) [6]. Possible causes of discrepancy are (i) over-simplification of the present approach or
(ii) the limited interval of the study by Richardson et al., between March 1 and April 4, 2020, shortly before the peak
of the outbreak.
Italy, Switzerland, and Belgium display similar figures for tICU : slightly more than 16 days in Italy, slightly less in
Belgium, and between 13 and 17.25 for Switzerland. In France, again, tICU appears to be significantly longer.

V.

CONCLUSION

In this paper, we have shown how the simplest of all epidemiological models suffices to match macroscopic data with
almost perfection. Having not let the pandemic evolve freely, political decision makers have curbed the outbreaks in
a way that can be modelled by simple analytical formulas. These provide mathematical models for bed occupation
numbers as a function of time that can be fitted very closely to the data supplied by health agencies. The fitting
procedure yields estimates of some important epidemiological parameters of COVID-19. Assuming values of the decay
rate γ of the outbreak, one derives estimates of the time from contamination to hospital, the time in hospital, and the
time in ICU. Numbers obtained are consistent with previously published values. Ranges of confidence are given, but
they are conditioned by the value γ. Still, interesting trends are observed, notably the much shorter hospitalization
time inferred for NYC compared to the other geographical areas. Overall, a great disparity of values is observed
depending on geographical location. Local circumstances, in the form of numbers of available beds, massive public
gathering, peculiarities in the lockdown measure, and also public awareness, certainly have impacted the parameters
of the local outbreaks. This should be taken into account in epidemiological models. If only macroscopic data, such
as those analyzed here, are available, it appears unnecessary to resort to more complicated models than SIR or close
variants thereof.
