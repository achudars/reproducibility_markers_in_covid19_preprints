Abstract
The present paper introduces a new model used to study and analyse the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) epidemic-reported-data from Spain.
This is a Hidden Markov Model whose hidden layer is a regeneration process with
Poisson immigration, Po-INAR(1), together with a mechanism that allows the
estimation of the under-reporting in non-stationary count time series. A novelty of the
model is that the expectation of the innovations in the unobserved process is a
time-dependent function defined in such a way that information about the spread of an
epidemic, as modelled through a Susceptible-Infectious-Removed dynamical system, is
incorporated into the model. In addition, the parameter controlling the intensity of the
under-reporting is also made to vary with time to adjust to possible seasonality or trend
in the data. Maximum likelihood methods are used to estimate the parameters of the
model.

Introduction
A major difficulty in the fight against the pandemic caused by the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) is the large number of people who
become infected and experience a mild form of the disease but can pass it on to
others [1, 2]. The lack of tests to carry out large-scale diagnoses and the different
protocols regarding testing policies add an extra source of uncertainty about the true
number of infected individuals. This causes the number of cases reported by the
authorities that serve as a basis for public health policies to be a severe underestimation
of the actual number of cases in the population [3].
The problem of under-reporting affects data quality and therefore contributes to
misrepresent results and conclusions, as reported observations do not reflect the total
amount of cases of interest but only a fraction of them. Any measure related to the
evolution or impact of the epidemic (e.g., lethality rates, basic and effective

1/20

reproduction numbers, and others) will be distorted. This problem is not exclusive of
epidemics but pervades in most areas of public health, as well as in economics and
society. During the past years, several authors have studied this phenomenon in
different applications. Among these authors, we can highlight [4] who studied the
under-reporting in worker absenteeism through Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis, [5]
who considered a Bayesian approach to estimate the number of committed crimes in
Málaga in 1993 and Stockholm between 1980 and 1986, [6] who described the
under-reported in work-related skin diseases in Norway from 2000 to 2013, or [7] who
studied under-reporting in tuberculosis in Brazil. Although the previous works, among
others, proposed new methods to describe, identify or estimate under-reporting of data,
none of them, to our knowledge, tried to model the under-reported in integer-valued
time series data. In [8] it is proposed a simple model for count time series data that
estimates the under-reporting of the human papillomavirus infections in the province of
Girona from 2010 to 2014, the number of deaths attributable to a rare, aggressive
tumour (pleural and peritoneal mesotheliomas) in Great Britain from 1968 to 2013, and
the number of botulism cases in Canada from 1970 to 2013. The aforementioned model
was extended by considering a more complex correlation structure among the
observations of the time series in [9], where the authors studied the number of real cases
of gender violence in Galicia from 2007 and 2017. The adequacy of the models in [8, 9]
was assessed through simulations of different scenarios that were well recovered by the
estimation procedure, and as for real data the results coincide with expert’s opinion.
Our original motivation for this work was the study of daily reported cases of
SARS-CoV2 in different areas of Spain. The protocol for testing as of February 2020
only included clinically suspicious patients who recently arrived from China [10]. The
protocol experienced changes in the succeeding weeks, and by May 2020, the norm
became the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or molecular tests performed to
individuals with a broader collection of symptoms and contacts of confirmed
patients [11]. This scenario suggests that there is a hidden process that governs the
evolution of the daily number of infected individuals, and an observed process that
reflects only part of it. Moreover, the proportion of unobserved cases varies in time, due
at least to the changes in testing protocols. On the other hand, it is reasonable to
assume that the underlying process is non-stationary since the evolution of the epidemic
of SARS-CoV2 has been observed to evolve initially drawing a mild logarithmic curve
followed by an outbreak with exponential growth, which later slows down and also
declines exponentially, with varying growth-decay rates which depend much on the
application and effectiveness of public health prevention measures.
In light of all the above considerations, we propose in this paper a new extension of
the model in [8], which deals with the non-stationary behaviour of the hidden process
and estimates the under-reporting in epidemics such as the SARS-CoV2 pandemic and
potential outbreaks. The unobserved process is modeled with an INAR(1) structure,
assuming that for each case counted during day n, a new case appears in day n + 1 with
a fixed (yet unknown) probability α, and to these a random number of other counts are
added (innovations). We shall assume that these innovations are independent of the
past and Poisson distributed. The mean of the innovations will be modelled as the
difference of the affected individuals from day n to day n + 1, found through the
solution of a SIR (Susceptible, Infectious, and Removed) compartmental model, thus
taking to account the spread of the epidemic. We reconstruct the most plausible count
for each time and propose different forecasting methods. The latter allows us to
estimate more precisely measures such as the lethality rate and provides more accurate
predictions for applying more realistic measures of control and prevention. The model is
applied to the time series of the number of new daily SARS-CoV2 cases confirmed by
PCR in different regions with different characteristics, and climate conditions in Spain.

Despite being especially useful to model and estimate the under-reporting in small areas
with low counts, the application also shows that our model can be used in larger areas
that can be split into smaller regions following geographic or sanitary criteria (e.g.,
dividing large areas into smaller sanitary areas).

Methods
Modelling the under-reporting of stationary time series
Our approach to the modelling of the non-reported daily counts in the SARS-CoV2
cases series is an extension of the model introduced in [8], that we briefly discuss here.
Consider that the true (unobserved) counts come from a process Xn , n ∈ N, defined
with an integer-valued autoregressive model of order 1 (INAR(1)):
Xn = α ◦ Xn−1 + Wn ,

(1)

where 0 < α < 1 is a fixed parameter, and Wn are the innovations, distributed
according to a discrete probability law, independent of Xn . The operator ◦ is the
binomial thinning or subsampling operator defined by:
xn−1

[α ◦ Xn−1 |Xn−1 = xn−1 ] =

X

Bj ,

(2)

j=1

where {Bj } is a sequence of independent and identically distributed Bernoulli random
variables with parameter α, denoted as Bern(α). Note that
[α ◦ Xn−1 |Xn−1 = xn−1 ] ∼ Binomial(xn−1 , α).
The model in (1) can be seen as an homogeneous Markov chain with transition
probabilities given by:
min(i,j) 

P(Xn = i|Xn−1 = j) =

X

k=0


j k
α (1 − α)j−k P(Wn = i − k),
k

(3)

where, in the case of the so-called INAR(1) process with Poisson innovations,
−λ i−k
λ
P(Wn = i − k) = e (i−k)!
. The INAR(1) model can be interpreted as a branching
process with immigration, where α is the probability of remaining in the system by
jumping from time n − 1 to time n, and the innovations are seen as new individuals in
the system.
More details on the INAR(1) model and several extensions can be found in [12–16]
or in [17–20] where INAR models based on generalisations of the binomial thinning
operators (e.g., expectation thinning operators) are defined.
Now consider a very simple mechanism that can lead to an observable and
potentially under-reported process Yn :

Yn =

Xn
q ◦ Xn

with probability 1 − ω
with probability ω,

(4)

That is, for each n, we observe Xn with probability 1 − ω, and a q-thinning (as defined
in equation (2)) of Xn with probability ω, independent of the past {Xj : j < n}.
PXn
Therefore, what we observe (the reported counts) is Yn = (1 − 1n )Xn + 1n j=1
ξj
where 1n ∼ Bern(ω) and ξj ∼ Bern(q).
In the next sections, we will generalise this process to allow for
non-time-homogeneous processes, by modelling the mean of the innovations in 1, as well
as the under-reporting parameter q in 4, as functions of time.

Parameter estimation
The parameters of the model can be estimated using different strategies. In [8], the
authors proposed a moments-based method and a likelihood-based method. Since the
first method is only appropriate when the series is stationary, we will focus on the
second method of estimation based on the likelihood function.
The model described in (1) and (4) is a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with an
infinite number of states [21, 22], and hence, the maximum likelihood estimators of the
parameters involve intensive numerical computations. For a given n, the possible values
of the series Xn must be equal to or greater than the observed value of Yn , which
implies a wide range of possible trajectories. Given the observed series, there are a
countable number of potential sequences that can lead to it, and therefore the likelihood
function cannot be computed directly. A way to circumvent this problem consists of
using the forward algorithm [21, 22]. This recursive algorithm is linear in n; it is based
on the forward probabilities of the Markov Chain that can be computed in terms of the
transition and emission probabilities. These forward probabilities are defined by
X
γk (y1:k , xk ) =
P(Yk = yk |Xk = xk )P(Xk = xk |Xk−1 = xk−1 )
xk−1

γk−1 (y1:k−1 , xk−1 ).

(5)

Thus, the likelihood function of P
the model can be computed as
∞
P(Y1 = y1 , Y2 = y2 , . . . , Yn = yn ) = Xn =yn γn (y1:n , xn ).
In this case, the transition probabilities, P(Xk = xk |Xk−1 = xk−1 ) are given by the
equation (3). That is, the transition probabilities are defined by the conditional
probability mass function of the INAR(1) model. On the other hand, the emission
probabilities are defined by:


yk > xk ,
0
x
k
(6)
P(Yk = yk |Xk = xk ) = (1 − ω) + ωq
yk = xk ,

 xk  yk
xk −yk
yk < xk .
ω yk q (1 − q)
Notice that, in practice, an upper threshold has to be defined in the sum that
computes the likelihood function. In this application, this threshold is fixed as 1.5 times
the maximum value of the series.
The reconstruction of the most likely latent sequence is a key point in the current
analysis since it gives us a picture of how the unobserved process behaves. To do so, the
Viterbi algorithm [23] is used, which consists in finding the sequence X ∗ that maximises
the likelihood function of Xn given the observed process Yn and a known vector of
b 1:n |Y1:n )
b 1:n |Y1:n ) = P(X
parameters. That is, X ∗ = argmaxX P(X
. However, since the
b 1:n )
P(Y

denominator P(Y

Modelling the spread of an epidemic: the SIR model
The key interest of researchers when dealing with an epidemic such as the current
SARS-CoV2 is to estimate the propagation of the disease and its possible end date to
apply appropriate measures of control and prevention [24].
We shall link the expectation of the innovations in (1) to the daily number of
individuals affected by the disease. For that purpose, we will study a simplified version
of a SIR model. This model belongs to the class of compartmental models, and a
system of ordinary differential equations governs its behaviour. Consider three classes of

August 4, 2020

4/20

individuals at each time t ∈ R: those who are healthy but susceptible to get the disease
(S(t)), those who are infected and thus transmitters of the disease (I(t)), and those
individuals who have been removed from the system and will not get infected again
(R(t)) [25, 26]. The SIR model describes the dynamics of the spread of the virus and it
is formally defined by a system of differential equations given in S1 Appendix.
The parameters of interest are β, γ, and N , which are the infection rate, the removal
rate, and the total susceptible population, respectively. For each t, the following
condition is fulfilled: S(t) + I(t) + R(t) = N . Usually, the initial conditions are set to
R(0) = 0, I(0) = I0 and S(0) = N − I0 . Although this model sensibly represents certain
epidemics’ evolution, it is hard to fit into real-world data due to the sensitiveness to
slight changes in both the values of the parameters and the initial conditions.
Consider now the number of affected individuals A(t) = I(t) + R(t). We show in S1
Appendix that the number of individuals affected by the disease can be fairly
represented by

A(t) =

M∗

M ∗ A0 ekt
.
+ A0 (ekt − 1)

(7)

(β−γ)
where k = β − γ and M ∗ = Nβ−γ/2
. Recall that β is the infection rate, γ is the recovery
rate and N the total susceptible population.
The solution given in (7) allows to take into account the information on the spread
of the epidemics in the model given by (1) and (4), by considering that the expectation
of the innovations, instead of being constant, that is, λ, it will be a function of time
such that λt = new(t) = A(t) − A(t − 1), where new(t) are the new affected cases at
time t. It can be seen that the equation (7) behaves as an exponential function close to
the origin, that is, A(t) ≈ A0 ekt when t ≈ 0. Therefore, the new affected cases grows
exponentially at the beginning, that is, new(t) = A(t) − A(t − 1) = A0 (1 − e−k )ekt . In
addition, the function A(t) tends to M ∗ as t tends to ∞. The maximum value of A(t),
that is, A(∞) can be obtained by numerically solving the following equation (see S1
Appendix for details):

Equation (8) can be especially useful in the reconstruction of the SIR process by
recovering the parameters β, γ, and N once the under-reporting model is estimated.
Taking into account this SIR representation of the expected value of the innovations
λt in the latent process model, a more realistic description of the model for the
SARS-CoV2 data will be derived, which will allow estimating the characteristics of the
under-reporting in such data and the spread of the epidemic jointly.

Modelling the under-reporting of non-stationary time series
including information of the spread of the disease
The model described in equations (1) and (4) is useful for detecting and quantifying the
under-reporting at a local scale because of the likelihood computations work well with
relatively small counts. In addition, it is meant to model weakly stationary processes
i.e., with expectation, variance, and auto-covariances not varying in time.
However, many real-world time series data are non-stationary as they may be
governed by trends or volatilities and may have different seasonal and cyclic patterns.
For example, the series of daily new SARS-CoV2 cases analysed in the present work
show intricate trend patterns. The observed series in the cases we analyse present a

August 4, 2020

seasonal component, which is due to the “weekend effect”. That is, the number of cases
reported during certain days of the week decreases, and thus the official records show
fewer cases periodically. This behaviour repeats weekly. It is a problem attributable to
the reporting process and not to the nature of the underlying phenomenon. The model
in equations (1) and (4) has to be modified in order to take this particularities into
account.
We proceed now to incorporate the information on the evolution concerning the
SARS-CoV2 epidemic into the model in equations (1) and (4), and thus to fit the trend
displayed in Figures 1, 3, and 4 appropriately.
Our analysis is based on the daily number of new cases of SARS-CoV2. For each
time n, the new counts can be expressed in terms of the affected number of individuals
that we have introduced in the previous section. That is, for each n, the number of new
individuals can be defined in terms of the number of affected individuals, as follows:
new(n) = A(n) − A(n − 1), where A(n) is defined in (7). This information can be
appropriately incorporated into the model to accommodate the trend present in the data
using the information on the propagation of the epidemic provided by the data itself.
A sensible way to do it is by considering that the expectation of the innovations of
the latent process Xn in expression (1) varies with the number of new cases at each time
n, and thus that the model in (1) and (4) is not stationary anymore. Specifically, the
innovations of Xn will have Poisson distribution with λn = new(n) = A(n) − A(n − 1),
where A(n) is given by (7). Therefore, the unobserved process Xn becomes:
Xn = α ◦ Xn−1 + Wn (λn ),

(9)

where the value of parameter α is still fixed between (0, 1), but now the parameter of
the Poisson distributed innovations Wn is a function of time, λn = f (Θ, n), where Θ is a
vector of parameters. Particularly, λn = new(n) = A(n) − A(n − 1), where A(n) is
defined by (7), assuming that A0 = 1. The value of A0 is known, representing the
number of affected people at the starting time. However, if this value also needs to be
estimated, it should thus be kept in the expression (7) as a parameter.
The model (4) defines the under-reported as an independent process in the sense
that the state of under-reporting at time n is not affected by the same state at time
n − 1. However, Fernández-Fontelo et.at. in [9] introduced a version of the
under-reporting scheme according to a two-state Markov chain. Although this approach
of the under-reporting process could have been considered in the current model, the
resulting model would be significantly more complicated than the one presented here
from a computational point of view. In addition, the under-reporting process in (4)
could also be considered stationary since it remains constant throughout the study (e.g.,
the under-reporting does not vary with time).
In the present work, however, the under-reporting process is flexible in that we do
not restrict the under-reporting parameters to be constant over time; they can vary
throughout the study if needed. To do so, both under-reporting parameters ω and q can
be made to vary with time, that is, ωn = f (n, Γ) and qn = f (n, ∆), where Γ and ∆ are
vectors of parameters. In our current model, just the parameter q is considered
time-dependent, and not both parameters to reduce computational issues. The latter
means that, if both parameters ω and q are considered time-dependent, the resulting
model is more complex and often shows convergence problems.
Particularly, the intensity of the under-reporting (i.e., q) is adjusted by the following

(10)

Hence, we ensure that qn ∈ (0, 1). In the expression (10), γ1 indicates whether q
increases or decreases over time, while γ2 and γ3 indicate whether the series has a
seasonal pattern with period p = 7 (one week). Notice that if γ1 = γ2 = γ3 = 0, then
the previous logit function becomes constant and thus qn = q resulting in the model (4).
Hence, considering this function for the intensity of the under-reporting, the
under-reporting process in the present model is defined by:

Xn
with probability 1 − ω,
Yn =
(11)
qn ◦ Xn with probability ω.
The parameters of the new model defined in (9) and (11) can be estimated using the
forward algorithm through the forward probabilities defined in (5). In addition, the
Viterbi algorithm introduced before can also be used to reconstruct the most likely
latent sequences.
Model forecasting
Another interesting point of the current analysis is the prediction of new daily cases of
SARS-CoV2. These predictions can be used as a tool for foreseeing potential future
outbreaks of the disease and, therefore, helping to implement earlier measures to lessen
the impact of outbreaks. We propose two different predictors.
The most straightforward way to predict the values of Yn+1 , Yn+2 , . . . given the
sample values Y1 , Y2 , · · · , Yn is by considering their average point predictions, that is,
E(Yn+1 ), E(Yn+2 ) . . . . In particular, since the model (1) is an auto-regressive model of
order 1, these average point predictions are expressed in terms of the last observed
value, that is, Yn .
Accordingly with the properties of the binomial thinning operator we have that
n+k
E(Yn+k ) = E (Xn+k )(1 − ω(1 − qn )), where E(Xn+k ) = λ1−α
and
λn+k = A(n + k) − A(n + k − 1). On the other hand, it is easy to see that
Pk
E(Xn+k ) = αk E(Xn ) + i=1 αk−i λn+i . Hence, if we have estimates for the
corresponding parameters at a given time n + k, the average point prediction of Yn+k
can be computed as follows:
E(Yn+k ) = ϕn+k αk Yn + ϕn+k (1 − ω(1 − qn ))

The distribution (13) is a mixture of two components that are sums of a Binomial
distribution and a Poisson distribution. To compute the corresponding probabilities for
each component, a direct modification of expression (3) can be used. Finally, if
P1 (Yn+k = j|Xn = xn ) is the probability of Yn+k = j in the first component of the
mixture (13), and P2 (Yn+k = j|Xn = xn ) the same probability in the second
component, the probability that P(Yn+k = j|Xn = xn ) of the mixture (13) is
P(Yn+k = j|Xn = xn ) = (1 − ω)P1 (Yn+k = j|Xn = xn ) + ωP2 (Yn+k = j|Xn = xn ).

Results
The current application is based on the official daily number of confirmed SARS-CoV2
cases in different areas of Spain. In particular, it shows that the model presented before
can be used to identify and quantify the under-reporting in small regions of Spain as
well as in larger areas that can be officially and hierarchically divided into smaller
regions (e.g., areas that can be divided into provinces or sanitary regions). That is, the
model is ideal for quantifying the under-reporting issue locally and brings a solution to
study that phenomenon in larger areas by aggregating the information in their smaller
regions. Also, at the same time the under-reporting is estimated, the model
accommodates the spread of the pandemic and provides this information through the
parameters M ∗ and k.

Under-reporting of SARS-CoV2 in small areas of Spain
Three different small areas from Spain in the North (Cantabria), South (Islas Canarias),
and Mediterranean coast (Islas Baleares) have been selected. The data from these areas
consist of the number of confirmed cases by positive PCR tests. The day of
confirmation coincides with the actual day the patient manifests symptomatology. See
“Availability of data and codes” section for data availability. All time series range in the
period from 5 March to 20 May 2020.
The time series corresponding to Cantabria takes values ranging from 0 to 161 cases
per day, with a mean of 36 and 2788 positive PCR cases. The number of deaths is 209,
36 deaths per 100000 inhabitants since the beginning of the pandemic, set on February
20, 2020.
The time series for Islas Canarias takes values ranging from 0 to 147 positive PCR
cases per day and with an average of 30 roughly and a total of 2299 positive cases by
PCR. A total of 155 people died, which means seven deaths per 100000 inhabitants
since the beginning of the pandemic.
The time series for Islas Baleares has values ranging from 0 to 107, with an average
of 28 and 2125 positive cases by PCR. Two hundred twenty-one deaths are registered in
this area since the beginning of the pandemic. This implies a total of 19 deaths per
100000 inhabitants.

Fig 1 shows the evolution over time of the new daily positive cases by PCR in
Cantabria, Islas Canarias, and Islas Baleares. The graph shows that these time series
are governed by a trend that increases to a maximum peak (the peak of the pandemic)
and decreases. Therefore, it is evident that the time series are non-stationary.
Additionally, the series shows periodic peaks that coincide with the “weekend effect”
previously described.

Table gives the MLE and standard errors of the
parameters of the model defined in (9) and (11) for
Cantabria, Islas Canarias and Islas Baleares.

The graph also shows the reconstructed time series with the Viterbi algorithm for the
above areas (black lines). Although the Spanish authorities have confirmed by PCR a
total of 2788, 2299, and 2125 new SARS-CoV2 cases in the studied period in Cantabria,
Islas Canarias and Islas Baleares, the model presented here estimates a total of 6074,
3370, and 4079 new cases within this period in the areas mentioned above. That is,
officially Cantabria, Islas Canarias, and Islas Baleares only the 45.9%, 68.2%, and 52.9%
of the total new SARS-CoV2 cases by PCR are registered.
On 20 May, a total of 209, 155, and 221 people died due to SARS-CoV2 in Cantabria,
Islas Canarias, and Islas Baleares, respectively. As expected, the lethality rates
computed using the observed and reconstructed number of confirmed cases by PCR
differ. While these rates are 7.5%, 6.7%, and 10.4% in Cantabria, Islas Canarias, and
Islas Baleares, the reconstructed rates significantly decrease to 3.4%, 4.6%, and 5.4%.
Results in Table 1 also allow reconstructing the SIR model, and therefore estimating
the parameters β, γ and N , also using the number of affected people A∗ when the curve
A(t) grows fastest (see S1 Appendix).
Although the exact solution of the SIR model can be derived, in our model, an
approximate solution to the SIR model has been considered as the logistic function A(t)
to make the model computationally less expensive. Because our SIR estimation relies on
an approximated solution, in practice, in some cases, the reconstruction of the
parameters β, γ, and N is not possible since the equation (S1.11) has no proper solution.
In the case of Cantabria, Islas Canarias and Islas Baleares, a proper solution for
(S1.11) has been found for the three regions. In particular, for Cantabria, considering
the estimated parameters α̂ = 0.9653, M̂ ∗ = 237.99, k̂ = 0.3344 and observing that the
fastest growth of A(t) occurs at A∗ = 1631.9, we obtain A∞ ≈ 6858.5,
A0 = 1/(1 − α̂) = 28.8 and, solving numerically (S1.11), N̂ = 427418.7. Then, plugging
the value of N̂ in (8) and using that β̂ − γ̂ = 0.3344 we find γ̂ = 85.57 and β̂ = 85.90.
Acting similarly for the other two regions, for Islas Canarias N̂ = 50629.4, γ̂ = 10.07
and β̂ = 10.40. For Islas Baleares, N̂ = 79584.6, γ̂ = 13.05 and β̂ = 13.34

Fig 2 shows the forecasting results based on the average point prediction and the
k-ahead forecasting distribution (e.g., percentiles 2.5%, 50%, and 97%) for the areas
mentioned above using a dynamic and static approach. The dynamic method is usually
used to evaluate the models’ predictive capability and consists of splitting down the
time series into the training and testing time series sets of sizes n − k and k. The
method starts training the model over the n − k observation in the training set. The
prediction and the 95% confidence levels for the observation n − k + 1 are computed
through the trained model and compared to the true observation n − k + 1. After that,
the training set is updated by including the first n − k + 1, the model is re-fitted over
the new training set, and a new prediction for the observation n − k + 2 is computed.
This recursive process is repeated until the last prediction for the n observation is
computed over the training set containing the n − 1 first observations. The static
method is usually used to predict unknown future values. The idea consists of using the
last Xn value to predict, both the average point prediction at time t + k and the
k-ahead forecasting distribution.

Fig 2 shows the dynamic prediction from 6 May to 20 May. In particular, the graph
shows the average point prediction (blue line), the median point prediction (yellow
lines), and the percentiles 2.5% and 97.5% (red-solid lines) of the forecasting
distribution. For all areas, it is clear that most of the time, the observed values are
within the percentiles 2.5% and 97.5%, that is, within the 95% confidence levels. This

Under-reporting of SARS-CoV2 in large areas of Spain
In this second example, the number of daily SARS-CoV2 cases confirmed by PCR is
studied in two large areas of Spain by splitting these areas into smaller hierarchical
regions (e.g., areas divided into smaller areas according to geographical or sanitary
reasons). In these cases, as before, the day of confirmation coincides with the actual day
the patient had symptoms. Recall that the model introduced here is especially useful for
studying the evolution of the SARS-CoV2 cases and identifying and quantifying its
under-reported in small areas. However, in this example, we will show that larger areas
can also be studied with these models if we have a way to split these vast areas.
The autonomous community of Galicia is divided into seven different sanitary areas.
These areas’ data consist of the number of daily new cases of SARS-CoV2 confirmed by
PCR from 12 March to 27 April. For the Galician data, the series had to be cut on 28
April since the region’s health system changed the definition of new cases from 28 April
onwards. Overall the autonomous community, the minimum, and the maximum number
of new daily cases confirmed by PCR range from 0 to 185, with 21 cases per day on
average. A total of 6974 cases are registered in Galicia as confirmed cases by PCR on 28
April. See “Availability of data and codes” section for data availability.
The autonomous community of Andalucı́a is divided into seven provinces. In this
case, each province’s time series is the number of new daily SARS-CoV2 cases confirmed
by PCR from 5 March to 20 May. Overall Andalucı́a, the minimum and the maximum
number of daily cases confirmed by PCR range from 0 to 185, with 20.4 cases per day on
average A total of 12591 cases are officially registered in Andalucı́a as confirmed cases
by PCR on 20 May. See “Availability of data and codes” section for data availability.
Table 2 shows the maximum likelihood estimates of the model in (9) and (11), or
nested versions, for each of the sanitary areas and provinces of Galicia and Andalucı́a,
respectively. It can be seen in that table that the models between lower regions within
the same area are consistent.

For Galicia, from 12 March to 27 April, a total of 1630, 1269, 1096, 577, 1323, 670,
and 409 cases of SARS-CoV2 are officially registered in Coruña, Vigo, Santiago,
Pontevedra, Ourense, Lugo, and Ferrol, respectively. However, our model estimates that,
over the same period previously defined, a total of 3559, 3062, 2112, 951, 3922, 1363,
and 1121 cases of SARS-CoV2 in with the same characteristics and the corresponding
areas above really occurred. The latter implies that only 45.8%, 41.4%, 51.89%, 60.7%,
33.7%, 49.2% and 36.5% of the total registered cases of SARS-CoV2 that have been
confirmed by PCR has been observed in Coruña, Vigo, Santiago, Pontevedra, Ourense,
Lugo, and Ferrol, respectively. Overall in Galicia, a total of 6974 cases are registered
between 12 March to 27 April. Our model estimates that the actual number of cases
with the same characteristics is 16090; that is, only 43.3% of the cases have been
officially registered. During that period, a total of 405 people died due to SARS-CoV2
that implies a lethality of 5.8% or 2.5% depending on whether the denominator is the
observed or reconstructed total cases, respectively. The mortality rate overall Galicia is
estimated as 15 deaths per 100000 inhabitants.
The estimation of the parameters of the SIR model can be obtained as described in
the first example. For instance, for Pontevedra N̂ = 5129.6, γ̂ = 2.76 and β̂ = 3.02, and
for Ferrol N̂ = 55790.5, γ̂ = 39.83 and β̂ = 40.11.
For Andalucia, from 5 March to 20 May, a total of 497, 1252, 1338, 2437, 401, 1443,
2761, and 2462 cases of SARS-CoV2 are officially registered in Almerı́a, Cádiz, Córdoba,

a total of 856, 1908, 2025, 3525, 644, 2552, 3845, and 3847 over the same period and
respectively for the same areas. That is, only 58.1%, 65.6%, 66.1%, 69.1%, 62.3%,
56.5%, 71.8% and 64.0% of the total registered cases of SARS-CoV2 that have been
confirmed by PCR has been observed in Almerı́a, Cádiz, Córdoba, Granada, Huelva,
Jaén, Málaga, and Sevilla, respectively. Overall Andalucı́a, a total of 12591 cases are
registered from 5 March to 20 May. Our model estimates a total of 19202 cases with the
same characteristics as those in the registered cases; that is, only 65.6% are registered in
this autonomous community. As before, the lethality rate strongly differs depending on
whether the denominator is considered as the observed or reconstructed total of cases
over the specified period. In particular, overall Andalucia, 1371 people died over the
specified period, which implies lethality rates of 10.9% or 7.1% if the number of total
cases corresponds to the officially registered or reconstructed, respectively. The
mortality rate overall Andalucı́a is estimated as 16 deaths per 100000 inhabitants.
Concerning the reconstruction of the SIR models, for example, for Córdoba
N̂ = 22500.2, γ̂ = 6.06 and β̂ = 6.33, and for Huelva N̂ = 7842.1, γ̂ = 5.77 and
β̂ = 5.98.
Fig 2 can also be built for both the areas of Galicia and Andalucı́a in the same way
than what we did before for Cantabria, Islas Canarias and Islas Baleares.

Discussion
One of the major challenges in the struggle against the SARS-CoV2 pandemic relies on
the people who come down with a mild form of the disease (e.g., experiencing mild
symptoms or even being asymptomatic) and therefore constituting one of the most
powerful vectors of virus’ transmission, combined with the lack of tests that impede
carrying out large-scale screenings [1]. However, the quick and efficient identification of
those people is vital to earlier control potential trends of infection and evaluate the
pandemic’s impact (e.g., to get unbiased estimators on the spread and impact of the
epidemic).
Since the epidemic showed up last December in China, the concern with the
under-reporting in official data as the number of infections and deaths worldwide has
been on everyone’s lips, including the media [27–29].
With this in mind, this paper aims to introduce an extension of the model proposed
in [8] to estimate the magnitude of the under-reporting in epidemics such as the current
SARS-CoV2. That article introduces a model that considers two processes: an
underlying process (true process) that we do not observe, and the observed and
potentially under-reported process that provides a proportion of what happens (a
proportion of the true process). The model’s particularity is that the underlying process
assumes an INAR(1) structure, and hence a particular correlation structure. The model
measures the under-reporting with two parameters that estimate the number of times
the process is under-reported (ω), and the overall distance between the most likely
sequence of latent states and the observed sequence (q). However, the model in [8] is
intended to fit stationary time series, which is not the case of the SARS-CoV2 data.
Therefore, to adapt the model above to the SARS-CoV2 case, the expected value of the
underlying process is allowed to be time-dependent through an approximated solution of
the SIR differential equations that depend on the new affected individuals at each time.
The new version of the model also allows considering time-varying under-reporting,
which, in the SARS-CoV2 case, may sometimes be more realistic (e.g., the intensity of
the under-reporting may decrease if the number of large-scale screenings increases).
Thus, the resulting model measures the under-reporting and adapts the evolution of the
pandemic based on the SIR model at the same time.
This paper’s results confirm that the under-reporting is effectively present in
SARS-CoV2 data from various regions in Spain conditioned to different management,
policies, and climate conditions. Results also show that the model has powerful
predictive characteristics exhibited in Fig 2 and that the SIR parameters N , β, and γ
can be relatively quickly recovered from the results in Tables 1 and 2. As expected, the
under-reporting from almost all regions is not constant over time but varies with times
showing a decreasing trend (γ̂1 ) and a seasonal pattern with seven days of periodicity
(γ̂2 and γ̂3 ). A decreasing trend means that the q parameter tends to 0 as time
increases, and therefore the intensity of the under-reporting phenomenon is stronger as
time passes. This result is surprising since it was expected a less intense under-reporting
process as time increases. However, the changes in protocols, data collection strategies,
among others, could have affected the evolution of this under-reporting process. On the
other hand, the seven-days periodicity is explained by the “weekend effect” that
produces a systematic decrease in the number of new cases during the weekends.
It has been shown that the coverage percentages vary from 33.7 % (Ourense in
Galicia) to 71.8 % (Málaga in Andalucı́a) and that the estimated lethality rates
decrease significantly when the number of reconstructed cases, rather than the number
based only on officially reported cases, are considered as the total number of affected
individuals. In particular, lethality rates with official cases range from 5.8 % to 10.9 %
and decrease to 2.5 % and 7.1 % with the reconstructed cases. The example with the
lethality rates reveals the influence of the under-reporting onto the parameters’

estimates, which are often used to make decisions, and thus the importance of having
appropriate methods to identify, control and estimate under-reporting.
Besides the under-reporting quantification, the model allows estimating the SIR
model under the underlying process. In particular, for Cantabria, Islas Canarias and
Islas Baleares it is estimated that the number of susceptible people (N̂ ) is 427418.7,
50629.4 and 79584.6, while the infection and removal rates (scaled by N̂ ) are 0.0201%
and 0.0200%, 0.0205% and 0.0199%, and 0.0168% and 0.0164%, respectively. The latter
means the basic reproduction numbers (β̂/γ̂) are slightly over 1, which means that the
virus, although nearly to be controlled, is not under control yet. For the second
example, which is mainly intended to show how the model can be used for large areas
with large counts, similar numbers have been obtained for β̂ and γ̂.
One of the main limitations of the current work is based on the available data since
the model can only estimate the unobserved counts that have similar characteristics to
the observed data. Since our data do not contain asymptomatic, our estimated
reconstructions in Figs 1, 3, and 4 do not contain those asymptomatic and only people
with the same characteristics than the observed counts who have not been officially
registered. To also include asymptomatic in the reconstruction of the underlying
process, random tests should be done to include cases that have passed the infection
asymptomatically. However, to the authors’ knowledge, this information is not available
yet. Other limitations are related to computational issues, especially when dealing with
relatively large counts, and the sensitivity of the approximated solution of the SIR
model that sometimes do not allow recovering the parameters N̂ , β̂ and γ̂.
The model presented here constitutes a first approach to a reliable method to
estimate the under-reporting of a pandemic such the current SARS-CoV2. Furthermore,
the model can be extended in different ways, such as considering more complex
correlation structures in the underlying process (e.g., INAR(p) or INARMA model), or
considering more general thinning operators for representing the observed process.
