The SHIR Model: Realistic Fits to COVID-19 Case Numbers
T.Barnes∗

We consider a global (location independent) model of pandemic growth which generalizes the SIR
model to accommodate important features of the COVID-19 pandemic, notably the implementation
of pandemic reduction measures. This “SHIR” model is applied to COVID-19 data, and shows
promise as a simple, tractable formalism with few parameters that can be used to model pandemic
case numbers. As an example we show that the average time dependence of new COVID-19 cases
per day from 15 Central and Western European countries is in good agreement with the analytic,
parameter-free prediction of the model.

SIR Models

In the models typically employed in epidemiology to
follow the evolution of a pandemic [1], one begins by
partitioning a total population of N individuals into a
complete set of disjoint subsets, according to their medical histories. The simplest models of this type have only
a few categories, such as 1) the susceptible but as yet
uninfected population S, 2) the infected but not recovered population I, who can infect S, and 3) the recovered population R, who can no longer infect S, and can
themselves no longer be infected. First-order ordinary
differential equations (ODEs) in time are assumed to describe the coupling between these groups. Once the appropriate initial conditions are specified, these ODEs can
be integrated, which gives predictions for the subsequent
evolution of the group populations.
In this example, given constant rates {rij } for the two
assumed transitions, S → I and I → R, the resulting
ODEs for this simple “SIR” model are

so the total number of individuals is a constant, N0 .

fR can be inferred from the other two populations, using

We will assume that the entire population is initially in
category S (susceptible but not infected or recovered),
so that fS (t = 0) = 1 and fI (t = 0) = 0. Given these
initial conditions we can solve the equations (3), which
also imply fR through fR = 1 − fS − fI , with the results

The behavior of this system is just what one would expect from the dynamics described in the SIR-type defining equations (1): The initial population of susceptibles
(S) decays exponentially at the specified rate rI as they
transition into infected (I); the infected fraction increases
to a maximum [2], and then declines as it populates the
final, recovered population (R). As t → ∞ one asymptotically approaches a state in which all of the population has transitioned to recovered, fR (t = +∞) = 1.
As anticipated, at any intermediate time 0 < t < +∞,
fS (t) + fI (t) + fI (t) = 1.
As a specific example, the time dependence predicted
by this SIR model is shown in Fig.1, for rI = 0.5 [days−1 ]
and rR = 0.1 [days−1 ] (an infection rate of five times the
recovery rate).
B.

A “SHIR” Model for COVID-19

Two important modifications to this simple pedagogical SIR model appear appropriate for a more realistic
description of the COVID-19 pandemic. One is that the
rate of transitions from susceptible (S) to infected (I)
should be proportional to the product of these two populations, since their interaction determines this rate. This
modifies the second evolution equation for the population
fraction fI (t) to
dfI /dt = +rI fS fI − rR fI .

(5)

This “second-order reaction kinetics” in the infection process is a standard assumption in epidemic models [1, 3].
A second, more novel modification of the SIR model is
to incorporate the effects of a social response to a highprofile pandemic such as COVID-19. In this case there
has been strong encouragement from governments and
medical authorities to reduce the growth of the pandemic
by implementing social distancing and related measures.
In this SHIR model these actions reduce the susceptible population by transferring them to a new category
of “hidden” individuals (H) who are not susceptible to
infection, which is populated from the original group of
susceptibles (S) through another rate process,
dfH /dt = +rH fS .

(6)

The individuals in H are not only the physically sequestered; simply changing behavior, such as avoiding
public assemblies, crowded schools and public transportation, implementing rigorous hygienic practices, and
many other measures contribute to the continued reduction of the effective susceptible population fraction fS [4].
We consider τ = 1/rH , the “social response time,” to
be a measure of how quickly a society responds to a developing pandemic threat. We shall subsequently find
that there are interesting differences between countries
in the fitted values of this parameter.
The partner DE for fS , similarly modified to include
a second-order infection rate process as well as the new

first-order social response transition term for S → H, is
dfS /dt = −rI fS fI − rH fS .

(7)

The final “recovery” DE for dR/dt is unchanged from
the SIR model formula in (1). However since the R cases
in practice include mortality as well as recovery, we will
instead refer to the R population as “resolved” [6].
Collecting these results gives our complete set of SHIR
model DEs,
dfH /dt = +rH fS
dfS /dt = −rI fS fI − rH fS
dfI /dt = +rI fS fI − rR fI
dfR /dt = +rR fI .

(8)

Note that one recovers the three original pandemic DEs
of Kermack et al. [3] (their Eqs.(29)) through the substitutions f(S,I,R) → (x, y, z)/N and (rI , rR ) → (κ, ℓ), and
removing the “hidden population” of the SHIR model by
setting rH = 0 and fH = 0.
We note in passing that the infected (and still infective) individuals (all those in box I) are also referred to
in the literature as the “active” cases, numbering A(t).
Here, I(t) and A(t) are identical; any individuals in box
I who are no longer infective are immediately reclassified
as “resolved,” and moved to box R.
Since (8) is a nonlinear set of ODEs for the four population fractions fS,H,I,R , an exact analytical solution will
not be possible, except in certain limits and approximations. However some important results can still be proven
for this nonlinear system. One such result, obtained by
adding the 4 equations in (8), is that the sum of the four
populations fractions f is a constant of motion. Thus
fH + fS + fI + fR = 1, or H + S + I + R remains a constant, N0 .
Another useful result is that the population fractions
of the two groups H “hidden” and R “resolved” can be
expressed simply in terms of the susceptible (S) and infected (I) fractions fS and fI ,
fH (t) = fH (t0 ) + rH

and

Our principle task will therefore be to solve the two coupled equations for fS (t) and fI (t), the second and third
equations in the set (8).
Since the rate of increase of the infected fraction dfI /dt
is proportional to the product fI fS , a trivial solution of
the model follows from an initial condition of no infections, fI (t = 0) = 0; this implies fI (t) = 0, i.e. that
there are no infections at any later (or earlier) time. In
this limit all that happens is that the initial fully susceptible population fS (t = 0) = 1; fH (t = 0) = 0 evolves
into an increasingly hidden population, as a decaying exponential;
fS (t) = e−rH t ,
fH (t) = 1 − e−rH t .

(in)

lim dfI

/dt = +rI e−rH t fI .

(12)

For completeness we note that the rate of decrease of the
“active” (still infective) population fraction fI (t) per day
due to transitions from “infected” to “resolved” status is
given by
(out)

dfI

/dt = −rR fI

(13)

so the full DE for fI (t) in this small-fI (t) limit is
lim dfI /dt = +(rI e−rH t − rR )fI .

S>>I

(14)

The formula for the fractional “new cases per day”
(cpd) growth rate in the small-fI (t) approximation,
Eq.(12), is attractive for several reasons. First, it is easily compared to data, since there is copious information
available from many countries regarding the number of
new cases per day. (This quantity is simply N0 times the
(in)
dfI /dt above.) Second, since (14) is a linear, homogeneous, first-order differential equation involving only
fI (t), and the associated integral over time is tractable,
we may solve for fI (t) analytically in this small-fI (t) approximation.
In the early and intermediate stages of a pandemic in
which the infected fraction still dominates the resolved
fraction, we can ignore the assumed slower transition of
infected to resolved by setting rR = 0, which gives

In the following section we will compare the expected
time dependence of several pandemic models to COVID19 data, including the SHIR model prediction (16). We
will follow this with more detailed SHIR-model calculations of the cumulative case numbers N0 fI (t) and especially the new cases per day (cpd), N0 dfI (t)/dt, and
will describe detailed fits of these functions to COVID19 data from a range of countries.

(11)

In practice the fraction of infected individuals fI (t) will
usually be much smaller than the fraction of susceptibles
fS (t). This suggests that we use the no-infection limit
(11) for fS (t) as a first approximation in determining
fI (t) in the small-fI (t) limit. With this substitution, we
find that the increase in dfI /dt, the fractional rate of new
cases per day, will be
S>>I

This relation is especially amenable to comparison with
data, as it relates two observed quantities, the number
of new cases per day (N0 dfI (t)/dt) and the cumulative
number of cases (N0 fI (t)), assuming that N0 fR (t) can
be neglected. The SHIR model in this small-infectedfraction limit predicts that this ratio should be a decaying
exponential in time,

PANDEMIC DYNAMICS

Simple models versus COVID-19 data

Here we will first discuss the time dependence predicted by two familiar dynamic models of pandemics, and
will show how these models can be compared to COVID19 data. We will find that there are serious difficulties in
applying these simple models to COVID-19.
In this discussion we will consider only the cumulative
number of cases as a function of time (here called P(t)),
and the rate of appearance of new cases per day, dP/dt.
These numbers are widely reported for COVID-19, and
require little interpretation. One important point is that
the number of cumulative cases to time t, P(t), is the
sum of the infected I(t) and the resolved R(t) populations
distinguished in the previous section;
P= I+R .

(17)

As a first, simplest model of the growth of a pandemic,
one can assume that the rate of change of the number of
cases dP/dt is proportional to the number of cases P,
dP
≡ Ṗ = λP .
dt

(18)

The solution of this differential equation is an exponential
times the number of cases at some arbitrary initial time,
P(t) = P(0) eλt .

(19)

This simple model clearly makes unrealistic assumptions,
notably that there are infinitely many potential cases. It
also neglects spatial dependence or other “local” aspects
of the problem, as well as the effect of transitions from
infected to resolved individuals who are no longer infective. This exponential model predicts that the ratio of

In Fig.3 we compare this expectation to the ratio of
new cases reported per day (∆P/∆t) to the cumulative
number of cases (P) for the UK, using data from Ref.[7]
over the period 18 Mar - 04 May 2020. Evidently this
ratio is far from constant; it falls by about a factor of 10
over the 47-day period shown.
The simple exponential model can be improved
through the introduction of a limit in the number of the
population that can be infected, Pmax . One can assume
that the infection rate is initially equivalent to the exponential model, but later in the pandemic is suppressed
in proportion to the number of uninfected individuals remaining, Pmax − P. A simple DE with these properties
is the “logistic model,” defined by

Pmax
 .

this ratio should be a simple, linear function of P,
dP/dt
= λ(1 − P/Pmax) .
P

(23)

So, when data on this ratio (y-axis) is plotted against
P (x-axis), this model anticipates linear P-dependence,
with an x-axis intercept (where dP/dt = 0) at P = Pmax .
In Fig.4 we show an example of this plot for COVID-19
data, using the USA cumulative cases and new cases per
day data from Ref.[7] through 15 July 2020. Although
this ratio initially has some qualitative resemblance to
the logistic model form (23), (see Fig.4 upper left), the
more recent data (lower right) is clearly inconsistent with
(23), and cannot be extrapolated linearly to zero dP/dt.
A study of the pandemic time dependence predicted
by the logistic model shows another specific aspect of the
model that makes it unrealistic for COVID-19; the rate
of new cases dP/dt predicted by this model is symmetric
about the maximum, at the P(t) inflection point t = t0 .
We shall see that in contrast the rate of new cases dP/dt
observed in the COVID-19 data is rather skewed, and has
a faster rise to maximum than the subsequent decline.

(21)

The solution of this model, which is symmetric about
P = Pmax /2, is the inverse of an exponential plus a constant, translated by a t0 that is determined by the initial
conditions;

This logistic model can also easily be tested by comparison with data on the ratio of new cases per day to

The SHIR model versus COVID-19 data

Here we will test a third prediction for time dependence, which is the form predicted by the SHIR model of
the previous section. There we noted that the infected
fraction fI of the population is predicted to satisfy the
differential equation
dfI /dt
= +rI e−rH t
fI

(24)

in the limits of a small fraction of the population being
infected (fI << 1) and the resolved fraction being small

5
relative to the infected fraction (fR << fI ). The existing
COVID-19 data suggests that these are both reasonable
approximations in the early and intermediate stages of
the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expectation (24) can immediately be compared
to data, since (dfI /dt)/fI is just the ratio shown on the
y-axis of Fig.3. The dotted line in the figure shows a
decaying exponential fit of exactly the form (24), which
evidently gives a very good description of the data. The
parameter values found in this fit are rI = 0.233 [days−1 ]
and τ ≡ 1/rH = 20.9 [days].
Motivated by the good agreement between the SHIR
model prediction of a decaying exponential in time for
(dfI /dt)/fI and the COVID-19 data evident in Fig.3, we
will subsequently discuss SHIR model predictions in more
detail, and will show fits of this model to COVID-19 data
from many European countries. This will follow a short
discussion of some general aspects of mathematically similar models, which will be used in the detailed discussion
of SHIR results.

General results for a class of pandemic models

The results discussed above motivate the consideration
of generalizations of the simplest “pure exponential” pandemic model, in which the constant λ of that model (20)
is replaced by an explicit function of time,

PREDICTIONS OF THE SHIR MODEL

Cumulative cases P(t) and cases per day (cpd)
dP/dt(t)

In Sec.I.B. we introduced the “SHIR” model as a generalization of the SIR model, with the effects of pandemic reduction measures incorporated through a “hidden” population (H) that migrates from the initial susceptible population (S) with a rate constant rH . In the
limit of a small infected population fraction (fI << 1)
relative to the remaining fraction of susceptibles (fS ),
and assuming that the resolved fraction fR can be neglected, we showed that the infected fraction satisfies a
differential equation of the form

(27)

On substituting the general solution P(t) from (26) into
this constraint, we find an equivalent definition of the in-

(30)

The rate coefficients rH and rI can be interpreted respectively as a characteristic “social response time” τ = 1/rH
for the implementation of pandemic reduction measures,
and an initial condition (at some t = 0) on the growth
rate function λ(t);
λ(t) = λ(0) e−t/τ .

Formally this may be regarded as exponential growth in a
new (nonlinear) time variable u, defined by du = λ(t)dt.
Since this is a model of the growth of a pandemic, the
cumulative number of cases (26) can only increase, or become flat when the pandemic has been completely halted,
which occurs if and when we reach a time tf for which
λ(tf ) = 0. Accordingly we constrain λ(t) to be positive
(pandemic ongoing, t < tf ) or zero (t = tf , pandemic
halted).
The inflection point of P(t) is of considerable importance, since this is the time of peak pandemic growth.
The time tinf l of the inflection point is specified by the
rate of change of case numbers dP/dt reaching a maximum; this occurs when the second derivative d2 P/dt2 is
zero,

If we multiply the infected fraction fI by the total population N0 ,
P(t) = N0 · fI

(32)

and similarly scale the fractional new cases per day,
dP/dt = N0 · dfI /dt ,

(33)

we can compare the results for the cumulative cases P(t)
and new cases per day dP/dt directly to the data as normally reported.
Given the form (31), on solving (29) we find that the
predicted number of cases as a function of time in the
SHIR model is a nested exponential,

P(t) = Pmax / exp λ(0)τ e−t/τ .

This rate of growth is zero at t = −∞, increases to a
maximum value at the P(t) inflection point t0 , and then
decreases with time, approaching zero exponentially as
t → +∞. dP/dt integrates to a finite number of cases
Pmax as t → +∞. The maximum number of cases per

by

The three parameters that specify a solution of the
SHIR model, Pmax , τ and t0 , all have simple interpretations; they are respectively the height, width scale, and
time shift of the pandemic profile P(t) (or of the rate
of new cases, dP/dt). Pmax is by definition the maximum value of P(t), and gives the total number of cases,
which is P(t) at t = +∞. The social response time τ sets
the scale for all time-interval features of P(t) and dP/dt,
since changing t0 only translates these functions. The
time shift t0 is the time of the inflection point of P(t),
tinf l = t0 = τ ln(λ(0)τ ).

This inflection point t0 may be considered the peak of
the local pandemic, since the number of new cases per
day estimated by the fit is then a maximum.
For discussion purposes a convenient choice for t0 in
(36) and (37) is t0 = 0, which places the inflection point
of P(t) at t = 0. Plotting P(t) or dP/dt against t in
units of τ , normalized to their maximum values, gives
a parameter-independent “universal profile” for each of
these functions. The universal form for P(t), scaled by
its maximum value Pmax , is shown in Fig.5. The inflection point of P(t) at t = 0 is indicated, where both
P(0)/Pmax and its slope (in the dimensionless time variable t/τ ) equal e−1 . This last property implies that the
total number of cases Pmax and the cumulative number
of cases at the time of the P(t) inflection point (pandemic
maximum), P(t0 ), are related by
Pmax = e · P(t0 ) .

P(t) / Pmax

This function increases monotonically from P = 0 at t =
−∞ to Pmax at t = +∞, and has a single inflection point
at t = tx0 . This is an example of a Gompertz [8] curve,
y = abq [9]; these are often encountered in problems in
which a proportional rate of growth f˙/f is driven by an
exponential.
The rate of appearance of new cases per day (cpd) in
the model, dP/dt, can be evaluated directly from P(t)
above, and is

This provides a simple estimate of the total expected
cases Pmax from the number observed up to the pandemic
peak, P(t0 ), which may already be known.
Some additional times of interest are those at which
P(t) has reached 10%, 50%, 90% and 99% of the total cumulative cases; these are respectively (t − t0 )/τ =

dP/dt from half-max to peak, which is 0.985τ ; and the

APPLICATION OF THE SHIR MODEL TO
COVID-19 DATA
A.

Goals of the Fitting Exercise

In this section we will show results from fitting the predicted early pandemic time dependence from the SHIR
model as derived in Sec.IIIA to data for the confirmed
COVID-19 case numbers from many different countries.
We will primarily consider fits of the new case numbers
per day (cpd) to the SHIR model prediction, Eq.(37).
As an initial example we will show results for Austria,
including fits to both the cpd and the cumulative case
numbers. Following this we will give the results of SHIR
model fits to the cpds reported by a representative set of
Western countries, and will compare and contrast these
results. We will also discuss procedures for fitting more
complicated datasets that show evidence for multiple infection sites, and will show examples of such fits. Finally we will show how datasets from multiple countries
can be combined, and will use this procedure to test the
predicted SHIR model profile for new cases per day, displayed as a universal (parameter-free) curve.

SHIR model single country fits: Europe

As a first application we will fit the three-parameter
SHIR model to the data on the number of new daily
COVID-19 cases per day in Austria, as reported on the
Worldometer website, Ref.[7]. Austria was chosen because it represents one of the earliest COVID-19 outbreaks in Europe, so their data allows us to follow both
the earlier and later stages of the pandemic. For this fit
we will use the entire Austrian cpd dataset from the initial website date of 15 Feb 2020 through 06 May 2020,

comprising a nominal 82 data points. (For most countries we consider, including Austria, there are actually
many “null” or zero entries in the early dates.)
As a reminder, in the small fraction of infections limit
assumed here one may solve the model for the cumulative case numbers of infected people P(t) and hence the
rate of new cases per day dP/dt in closed form, given
by Eqs.(36,37). The three free parameters in these functions are Pmax (total number of cases), τ (social response
time), and t0 (the P(t) inflection point; time of the maximum cases per day). Our common t = 0 reference time
in all these numerical fits and discussions is taken to be
18 Mar 2020. The fits are all simple, unweighted leastsquares without data errors.

FIG. 7: New COVID-19 cases per day reported for Austria
over the period 15 Feb - 06 May 2020, with a SHIR model fit
(solid line). The maximum new case rate and associated time
(the P(t) inflection point, t0 ) in the model are indicated by
a single large point. Estimated 95% CL limits are shown as
dotted lines.

The result of this fit for Austria is shown in Fig.7. This
is a surprisingly good fit to the full range of the cpd data,
including the rapid initial rise after the early cases, the
peak region, and the subsequent slower decline; all are
reasonably well described by the model [11].
The SHIR model parameters resulting from this fit to
the cpd data from Austria are given below.
Pmax = 14.9(8)k [cases]
τ
= 7.54(50) [days]
t0 = 7.32(49) [days] .

(44)

These and other fitted parameters are typically quoted
to three-place accuracy in this paper, to allow numerical tests such as debugging of numerical routines and
checking analytic results.
There is evidently reasonable agreement between the
SHIR model and the data with these parameters for the
number of new cases per day, although there is considerable scatter in the data. The numerical value of
the peak predicted cpd, Pmax /eτ , and the time of the

(45)

Evidently the SHIR model also provides a reasonably accurate description of the cumulative cases for Austria.
The parameter values resulting from the two fits, to
cpd data (44) and cumulative cases data (45), are quite
similar [12]. The total case numbers Pmax differ from
their mean by ±2%, the fitted social response times τ

peak, tinf l = t0 are indicated by a single large point in
Fig.7. These values are respectively 728 [cases/day] and
7.32 [days] (measured from t = 0 on 18 Mar 2020), giving
25 Mar 2020 as the peak date for new cases per day in
Austria implied by this fit.
The fitted value of the Austrian “social response time,”
τ ≈ 7.5 [days], is of special note. This is the smallest
value (hence the fastest social response) we have found
in our fits to the COVID-19 pandemic numbers from a
large set of 15 representative Central and Western European countries (see Table I). This suggests that Austria
deployed an especially rapid and effective response to this
pandemic, which presumably had a strongly limiting effect on the total number of cases.
A minor discrepancy between the model and data is
evident at the early times in Fig.7 that are characterized by small case numbers. (See times before about
t = −4 [days] in the figure.) The number of early cases
is clearly underpredicted by the fit. This may represent their growth from a small number of initial cases,
closely monitored and hence developing rather slowly,
which were evident before the primary pandemic contribution became dominant. We will note a similar, more
prominent effect in the early data from Denmark and
Norway at about the same date.
An alternative approach would be to fit the cumulative
number of reported cases as a function of time, which is
typically reported together with the new cases per day.
Since one is the derivative of the other, these should give
similar parameter values. Of course the results will not
be identical, because the model is not exact, and the
cumulative cases data will give higher fitting weight to
the later stages of the pandemic.
The choice of which dataset to fit, cumulative cases
or new cases per day, may be suggested by the subject
of greatest interest; the peak of the pandemic is best
determined by fitting the new cases per day, but the final
number of cases will be best determined if constrained by
the large total case numbers reported in the later stages
of the pandemic.
Here as an example of the second fit we give the SHIR
model results that follow from fitting the cumulative case
numbers from Austria. We again use a set of 82 points of
Austrian data [7] from the initial reporting date of 15 Feb
2020 through the fitting date, 06 May 2020. The SHIR
model fit to the Austrian cumulative cases data is shown
in Fig.8. The parameters resulting from this cumulative

differ from their mean by ±4%, and the fitted times of the
Austrian inflection point (maximum rate of new cases) in
the two fits differ by just 0.8 [days].
Next we will follow the same procedure described in the
first Austrian fit above, and will fit the SHIR model to the
cpd data for each of a representative set of Central and
Western European countries. For each fit, as discussed
for Austria, we have again used 82 pts of daily new case
numbers per day [7] for the period 15 Feb - 06 May 2020
as the only input data. This data fitted to the threeparameter SHIR model form for dP(t)/dt, (37). This
fixes the three model parameters Pmax (with units of
[cases]), τ [days], and the inflection point tinf l = t0 [days]
(measured from t = 0 on 18 Mar 2020) separately for each
country.
The fitted parameter values for the entire set of 15
Central and Western European countries considered here
are given in Table.I, together with the calendar date of
the inflection point t0 , and the fitted peak number of new
cases per day, which occurs at t0 .

Implications of European Single Country Fits

Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of the SHIR model
fits to 15 Central and Western European countries in
Table.I is the wide range of values found for the “social
response time” τ , and how it appears to correlate with
national coronavirus policy. As τ sets the width of the
pandemic peak, it is a measure of how long a country
will have to endure the pandemic. (Recall for example
that the FWHM of the new cases per day, dP/dt, is about
2.4·τ .) The extreme cases are Austria (τ ≈ 7.5 days) and
Sweden (τ ≈ 26 days), over 3 times longer than Austria.
The Swedish cpd data and fit are shown in Fig.9.
The very slow Swedish response time is apparently the
result of a rather controversial COVID-19 policy pro-

way, and the Swedish fatalities per capita are larger by a
similar amount. This argues that an aggressive national
policy of minimizing the social response time τ , for example through contact tracing, extensive testing, rapid
medical response and isolation of positive cases through
quarantine, may be the most effective in reducing the total case and fatality numbers. It may also prove easier to
sustain a strict policy over a short period of time than a
more lax one over a longer period.
The UK and Dutch social response times τ are also
quite large, and can also be correlated with their early national policies that promoted “flattening the curve” and
developing herd immunity. To quote the Dutch Prime
Minister regarding COVID-19 policy in a national address [14], (in translation) “... we can slow down the
spread of the virus while at the same time building group
immunity in a controlled way.” In a national address [15]
the UK Prime Minister stated that “It is vital to slow
the spread of the disease. That is the way we reduce the
number of people needing hospital treatment at any one
time.”
Of course the argument that slowing the spread of the
pandemic is advantageous because it “flattens the curve”
is specious. This tacitly assumes that the total number
of cases Pmax is constant, so a broader rate curve must
have a lower mean. In practice there is instead evidence
that a longer τ may result in more infections per capita,
as seen in comparing Sweden with Denmark and Norway. If so, flattening the curve by slowing the spread
of the pandemic unfortunately increases the total number of cases and fatalities. This complicated and perhaps
counterintuitive issue certainly merits careful future investigation.

moted by the Swedish State Epidemiologist, A. Tegnell [13], which did not impose the strict school closings,
border controls, and restrictions on large gatherings that
characterized the policies of other Scandinavian countries. Tegnell instead advocated a more open society during the pandemic, to promote herd immunity and a quick
economic recovery. Although the Swedish policy was evidently successful in broadening the curve, their per capita
number of cases is over twice that of Denmark and Nor-

SHIR model single country fits: North America

We have also carried out fits of the SHIR model to
COVID-19 data for three North American countries,
Canada, Mexico and the USA. These three countries were
treated as a separate exercise because of concerns that
European and North American policies differed considerably, which might lead to very different fit parameters
and pandemic curves. This was indeed found to be the
case.
Most of the fits of the SHIR model to European countries described above were carried out in May 2020, using
82-point Worldometer coronavirus datasets [7] covering
the period 15 Feb - 06 May 2020. Initially we used the
same procedures and datasets for the three North American countries. This appeared satisfactory for Canada and
the USA, however the data for Mexico showed that this
country was still in the early stages of the pandemic, and
had a very long social response time of about 63 days,
with a predicted pandemic peak in late July. For this
reason we decided to carry out a fit to Mexico incorporating later data, specifically a 151-point Worldometer
cpd dataset for the period 15 Feb - 14 July 2020, and

Fits to countries with multiple events

Of course each of the national pandemic datasets we
are studying is in some sense the sum of multiple events,
displaced in time and encountering special local conditions. In the USA for example the early data is dominated by events on the West Coast, but these were superseded by the major outbreak involving New York City,
and then by a smaller event in New Jersey, and a larger
number of local events in the Midwest and South. Fitting the data from many local outbreaks as a single event
is clearly problematic. A series of local events separated
in time but still overlapping significantly, if fitted as a
single outbreak, could give a misleadingly large τ . Separating the individual events will require accurate local
data, and a more detailed investigation.
Despite this concern, the SHIR model does nonetheless
allow a reasonably accurate fit to most of the national
datasets we have considered. Of the 15 European countries we have discussed here, just two showed clear evidence of a more complicated pandemic history that could

not be fitted as a single-peak event. These were Denmark and Norway. In both countries there was evidence
of an early, short-lived outbreak, which led to about 800
cases of COVID-19 in each country, both during the period of 10-13 Mar 2020. In both countries this early outbreak was rapidly suppressed, presumably through contact tracing and quarantine.
We found that the cpd data from Denmark and Norway could be described by using Eq.(37) to represent two
independent outbreaks, a short, early one, with a very
short τ ≈ 1.2 [days], and a dominant second outbreak,
with the more typical COVID-19 parameters listed in Table.I. The resulting two-peak fit for Norway is shown in
Fig.10 [11].
Norway cpd fitted to SHIR model
82pts Norway cpd data fitted to SHIR model, main peak params Pmax = 6.95396k [cases], τ = 10.1415 [days], t0 = 8.70977 [days] (27 Mar)

new cases per day (cpd)

have fitted the corresponding data for Canada as well.
Recent developments in the USA have shown a dramatic departure from a single peak model, which suggests that the USA should be treated as a superposition
of several more localized outbreaks. Accordingly, here we
quote SHIR model fit results for New York State alone,
as a representative component of the USA with an effective social response. The cpd data in this case is available
from 12 Mar 2020, so we fitted a dataset covering the period 12 Mar - 14 July 2020, comprising 125 data points.
The results of these fits are given in Table.II. The social
response times {τ } for North America extend from near
to well beyond the upper end of the European range; the
values for New York State and Canada are comparable to
the highest values observed in Europe, near the 16 [days]
and 26 [days] found for Italy and Sweden respectively.
This suggests comparably extended periods of pandemic
in these North American countries. The τ value of about
65 [days] found in the fit to Mexico is remarkable, much
longer than that of any other country considered in this
study. (A fit to Brazilian data, not included here, finds a
similar value for τ .) This SHIR model fit for Mexico (to
the 15 Feb - 14 July 2020 cpd data) predicts that their
pandemic peak will occur on 31 July 2020, and anticipates just over a million total cases.

later peaks, thus 11.01k and 7.72k cases respectively.

SHIR model fits to multiple countries

The idea of simultaneously fitting multiple countries
to the SHIR model seems appealing, particularly as this
model gives a good description of the case numbers from
many different European countries. Unfortunately there
are complications with this procedure; individual countries vary considerably in the fitted values of the total
cases Pmax , the characteristic social response time τ , and
the local time of the pandemic peak, t0 . These differences
suggest a scaling approach, in which we determine these
parameters separately for each country in a SHIR model
fit, and then translate (by t0 ) and scale (by Pmax and τ )
the datasets for each country separately. If the model and
the data are both accurate, these translated and scaled
datasets should provide points that fall on the universal

curves shown in Figs.5 and 6. Of course there are indications that the COVID-19 data itself is occasionally
problematic, with considerable scatter, single-bin spikes,
and in some countries a modulation with a 7-day period
that may reflect a weekly reporting regimen. Nonetheless it is of interest to generate this translated and scaled
scatterplot, to see whether a common pandemic profile
is indeed evident in the European data.
This scatterplot is shown in Fig.11 for the 82-point cpd
datasets of all 15 European countries in Table.I. Each
national dataset was translated and scaled separately by
its particular values of t0 , Pmax , and τ (as given in the
table) before being added to this figure. The data from
Denmark and Norway before 20 Mar 2020 was excluded
from the plot, to suppress contributions from their initial
early outbreaks.

We can use this scatterplot to combine the data from
the 15 European countries we have considered, since they
have now been superimposed through translating in time
and scaling both axes. On binning in the scaled time
variable (t − t0 )/τ , we can calculate the average and variance of the scaled cpd datapoints in each bin, which provides an average and error for dP/dt at that value of
(t − t0 )/τ . As an example, we have used bins of width
∆(t − t0 )/τ = 0.5, centered on t − t0 = 0, which gives
the result shown in Fig.12. This appears approximately
consistent with the parameter-free SHIR model result for
dP/dt (46), although there may be relatively minor discrepancies at onset ((t − t0 )/τ ≈ −2) and well after peak
((t − t0 )/τ ≈ 3 − 4).
The Europe-averaged COVID-19 data for the new
cases per day shown as points with errors in Fig.12 can be

used to calculate expectation values under this common
COVID-19 dP/dt distribution. Some of these results are
given in Table.III, where they are compared to theoretical values predicted by the SHIR model dP/dt, Eq.(46).
Evidently the simpler expected values are in reasonably
good agreement, notably the displaced value of the mean
from the maximum. There is however a discrepancy in
the cubic expected values, which are sensitive to the relatively less well determined wings of the distribution at
larger |t − t0 |/τ .

Future prospects

We have shown that a SHIR (generalized SIR) model
and its associated differential equations give rather good
closed-form results for the COVID-19 data on new cases
per day and cumulative cases, when solved under certain
assumptions. These assumptions can be relaxed in future
studies.
One important assumption was to ignore the effects
of the “resolved” population fraction fR . This quantity,
which is certainly of interest in planning economic recovery, is simple to evaluate from the “infected” fraction we
have discussed here; it is simply the integral in Eq.10.
This can be evaluated analytically, together with the full
DE for fI , including the rR term, to accommodate transitions out of “infected” and into “resolved.” The cumulative case numbers P(t) discussed in relation to COVID-19
data should then be defined by P(t) = N0 (fI + fR ), i.e.
“infected” plus “resolved,” since fR is no longer assumed
to be negligible.
Calculations of mortality rates are certainly of interest,
and are implicitly included in the transition from the infected population I (or IS ) to the resolved population R.
Mortality can easily be treated separately, for example
by specifying separate I → R rate parameters for mortality and for recovery. In the extended SHIR model of
Fig.13, mortality would presumably only contribute to
the combined rate for IS → R. The mortality rate coefficients may of course depend strongly on the procedures
followed at each country’s medical facilities.
Numerical methods can be used to extract SHIR model
results for the full model, including the S − I quadratic
infection term, and can test the importance of the “small
fraction of infections” approximation used here.
A straightforward generalization of the model could
accommodate the effect of “asymptomatic” infected individuals on the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Recent antibody results from Italy [16] suggest that the
asymptomatic cases are a large but not dominant fraction of all COVID-19 cases. Once better data on the
number of asymptomatic cases becomes available, it may
prove useful to extend the model to include this population. This group follows a progression S → IA → R, and
while in the IA population presumably contributes to the
infection of other individuals still in S. Although adding
this branch to the model may indicate that the fraction
of resolved individuals fR is much larger than the SHIR
model alone suggests, the pathway through symptomatic
cases will remain as before. The most visible predictions
of the model, for the number of symptomatic cases (now
IS ), may not change significantly. A block diagram of
this extended SHIR model is shown in Fig.13.
Finally, although we have primarily considered
COVID-19 in Central and Western European countries,
largely because of an assumed similarity in standards
for reporting data, there is extensive data available from
many other countries which could be addressed using this
type of model, undoubtedly with interesting results.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have introduced a generalization of
the SIR model in order to incorporate the effects of pandemic reduction measures. This “SHIR” model adds a
rate process that allows transitions from the susceptible
population (S) to a new “hidden” population (H), which
we assume is not susceptible to infection. We have solved
this model analytically in the limit of a small infected
population fraction, and showed that the predicted time
dependence of cumulative cases and new cases per day
is in surprisingly good agreement with COVID-19 data.
(We primarily considered Central and Western European
countries in this study.) The solution of the model with
our approximations involves three free parameters; one
is the “social response time” τ , which varies widely between countries, in a manner that correlates with their
coronavirus policies.

[2] In this simple SIR model the time at which fI is a maximum and that maximum value can be solved for analytically, and are respectively t = ln(rI /rR )/(rI − rR ) and
fI = (ρ/(ρ − 1))(ρ−1/(ρ−1) − ρ−ρ/(ρ−1) ), where ρ = rI /rR .

[4] Protected groups similar to the “H” box of Fig.2 have
previously been considered in generalizations of the SIR
model. For example, the effects of vaccination are discussed using an SIRV model [1], and the 2003 SARS
model of Lipsitch et al. [5] introduces an XQ population
to model quarantine.

[6] The use of “resolved” for the post-infected population
R, the sum of deceased and recovered, was suggested by
P.Ardaury. This population is also referred to as “closed
cases” in the Worldometer COVID-19 database [7].

[10] Skewness is a dimensionless property of a distribution,
and is defined by < (t− < t >)3 > /σ 3 , where the aver-

ages here are taken using the distribution dP/dt.
[11] We note in passing that a single “outlier” point in the
Austrian cpd data, 1321 new cases on 26 Mar 2020, lies
above the upper cutoff of 1000 cases per day in Fig.7. It
was of course included in the fit. Similarly, the Norwegian cpd data includes an outlier of 399 new cases on 27
Mar 2020 and a negative entry of -44 new cases on 08
Apr 2020, which we assume was a correction to the data.
These points were included in the Norwegian fit shown
in Fig.(10).
[12] It is notable that the estimated parameter errors in the
cumulative “cas” data fit are much smaller than in the
preceding new cases per day “cpd” fit. The cas parameter
errors are likely underestimated, since the cas data points
represent a running sum, and are therefore highly correlated. The cpd parameter errors are presumably more
realistic, since they are not correlated in this manner.
Note that the differences between the fitted cpd and cas
parameters are comparable to the cpd errors.
