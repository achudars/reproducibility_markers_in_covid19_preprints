One sentence summary: Government interventions should target non-local contacts
in order to efficiently prevent disease spread.

Abstract
Countries around the world implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to
flatten the curve of COVID-19 cases but failed to eradicate the disease. Design of
efficient NPIs requires identification of the structure of the underlying transmission
network. We combine Bayesian parameter inference with a network-based
epidemiological model that allows to interpolate between random and small-world
transmission networks. Using epidemiological data from Germany, we show that NPIs
reduced non-local contacts in the transmission network, resulting in a change from an
exponential to a constant regime. Due to the small-world nature of the inferred network,
exponential spread can be efficiently prevented by reducing non-local contacts.
Eliminating the disease remains costly as it requires to reduce all contacts. Our code is
freely available and can be readily adapted to any country.

Introduction
The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has dramatic consequences at a global scale. Since effective
treatments and vaccines are still unavailable, many countries have applied

1/18

non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) of varying severity, like cancelling big events,
closing schools, and shutting down businesses to reduce virus transmission by limiting
contacts in the population. The prime goal of NPI design is to prevent those contacts in
the population which contribute the most to disease spread while allowing less
dangerous contacts. Data from several countries indicate that the effect of early, less
strict NPIs, like cancellation of large events, had a profound effect on the spread of the
disease [1, 2]. Other findings suggest that only a full lockdown reduced the spread
noticeably [3], although the implementation of the lockdown varied dramatically
between individual countries. For example, Germany did not implement a full lockdown
but enacted contact restrictions and closure of non-essential businesses so that people
were still allowed to leave their homes and meet in small groups. In several countries,
following the implementations of various NPIs, the curves of cumulative infections left
the exponential regime and entered a linear one, corresponding to a constant regime of
new infections, and an effective reproduction number around 1, see Fig. 1A-C. This is
remarkable, because these countries are very heterogeneous regarding their
demographics, economic situation and the implemented NPIs. Epidemiological models
that assume an underlying random transmission network predict this behavior only for
a particularly fine-tuned set of parameters, which contrasts with the robustness of the
decline in the reproduction number observed in reality [2, 4–6]. Identification of the
underlying transmission network is not only crucial for the design of effective NPIs, but
also for assessing other properties of COVID-19 spread, such as the herd immunity
threshold [7]. Thurner et al. suggested that the linear regime of cumulative infections is
a consequence of a small-world transmission network [8], see Fig. 1D-I. The
heterogeneous topology of real social networks is reflected by a small average path
length between any two nodes (small world property) and by a power-law distribution
(scale-free property) of the node degree [9, 10]. Network-based epidemiological models
allow to consider the effects of heterogeneity with respect to the type and frequency of
contacts in the population, i. e. how often people meet and whom, by representing all
agents as nodes of a network and the contacts in the population by links between these
nodes [11–13]. The spread of diseases is strengthened on scale-free networks and the
epidemic processes on such networks do not possess epidemic thresholds so that they
always produce a major epidemic outbreak [14, 15]. Consequently, on a scale-free
network topology the disease is persistent no matter the infection rate [16]. A similar
model was able to explain the disease dynamics during the SARS outbreak in Hong
Kong in 2003 [17]. Recently, Komarova et. al. discussed the power law behavior of the
dynamics of COVID-19 spread in the context of a metapopulation model [18]. We
combine Bayesian parameter inference [19] with a network-based epidemiological model
that allows to interpolate between random and small-world transmission networks to
infer the topology of the transmission network in Germany during three time periods:
February 26 until March 15, before serious NPIs were imposed, March 16 until June 6,
when strict contact restrictions were in place and non-essential businesses were closed,
and June 7 until September 15, when most NPIs were lifted. We show that NPIs
reduced non-local contacts in the transmission network, resulting in a change from an
exponential to a constant regime of new cases. Non-local contacts often span a large
distance in the transmission network and connect different cliques. They include for
example contacts during public transport, in bars and restaurants, but also contacts to
relatives that live far away. Furthermore, given the nature of non-local contacts, the
probability for superspreader events increases when there is a high density of such
non-local contacts, as they enable the disease to spread to fully susceptible
interconnected cliques. Moreover, reduction of non-local contacts has a strong
non-linear effect on the effective reproduction rate and the peak value of infected people,
pushing the disease dynamics into a regime of a constant number of new infections.

2/18

Decreasing the total number of contacts including those within connected cliques, on
the other hand, has a strong effect if the epidemic threshold is reached or if the network
is almost random, see Fig. 1D,G. Furthermore, we are able to analytically predict
disease spread in the absence of non-local contacts by a wave
√ equation where the wave
speed (proportional to the growth rate) c scales as c ∝ k 2 k, where k is the number of
local contacts. This corresponds to the linear spreading regime. In summary, our model
suggests that the prime goal of NPIs should be to decrease non-local contacts in the
population to prevent an exponential disease spread.

Results
Bayesian parameter inference
We aimed to infer the induced changes in the topology of the COVID-19 transmission
network by Bayesian parameter inference. We expected that NPIs lead to a change in
the behavior of people and therefore in the topology of the corresponding transmission
network. We assumed that the transmission network can be described by the
Watts-Strogatz network [9] that can interpolate between a random and a small-world
network (Supplementary material). Crucially, in this framework, we could distinguish
local contacts within cliques, like households, nursing homes, businesses etc. and
non-local contacts outside of these clusters, corresponding to encounters in public
transport, with business partners, friends and family that live far away and similar.
During the construction of the Watts-Strogatz network, n nodes are placed in a ring
topology and connected to their k = 2, 4, 6, . . . nearest neighbors (local contacts). After
that, each link is rewired with a probability p to another random node (see Fig. S1),
and we refer to these links as non-local. We used the SEIR
(susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed) epidemiological model for the COVID-19
disease dynamics. Agents in the SEIR model were represented by the network nodes
such that infectious agents could spread the disease with probability pI to susceptible
agents that they are connected to in discrete time steps of single days (Supplementary
material, Fig. S2).
We inferred the model parameters p, k, pI for the time periods before and after the
first NPIs were implemented in Germany, and after most NPIs were lifted again by
applying an approximate Bayesian computation with sequential Monte Carlo
(ABC-SMC) algorithm (Supplementary material). We did not infer those SEIR model
parameters corresponding to the disease progression, which were reported in the
literature [21] (Supplementary material) and kept the number of agents fixed at
n = 3 × 105 . For the time periods before June 6 when a large number of infections was
not reported, we also inferred the initial numbers of exposed and infectious individuals
nE (0), nI (0).
Based on Google mobility reports and previous work on the inference of change
points in the spread of COVID-19 [2, 22] we assumed the critical time point for the
effect of NPIs in Germany to be March 15, as from March 16, NPIs were synchronized
in German states, and schools and non-essential businesses were closed.
We intentionally chose broad, uninformative priors for all parameters, such that we
could compare the obtained posterior distributions with other data sources as a
sanity-check of our approach. To account for the weekday-dependent reporting delay we
used a seven day rolling average of new case reports provided by John Hopkins
University [20]. Our parameter inference scheme is based on a minimization of the
difference between this average and the number of agents becoming infectious in the
model on the corresponding day. We here assumed that all people that were tested
positive were also infectious at the time of the test and that the time delay between

people turning infectious and their test is negligible.
First, we inferred the parameters for the time from February 26 to March 15, since
daily new cases increased rapidly after February 26, while there were almost no cases in
the week before. Our analysis of this time period revealed an almost random
transmission network, with a median fraction of non-local contacts of p = 0.48 (with
95 % credibility interval, CI [0.23, 0.94]), a large number of contacts k = 26 (CI [22, 32])
and a high infection probability of pI = 0.035 (CI [0.025, 0.061]). For the initial
condition we estimated that 33 (CI [4, 46]) people were exposed and 81 (CI [32, 118])
people were infectious on February 26.
To assess the changes of the transmission network induced by the NPIs in Germany,
we next considered the time period following March 16. During that time frame the
NPIs were changed several times, however, the contact restrictions, which we regard as
the most crucial intervention, were only lifted on June 6, which is why we chose this
date as the endpoint of the time interval. As the total number of cases was
computationally intractable, we instead used the relative number of new cases as input
for this time period (Supplementary material).
Our Bayesian parameter inference reveals that the NPIs reduced the number of
contacts in the transmission network considerably to k = 6 (CI [4, 10]). They also
reduced the infection probability of these contacts to pI = 0.02 (CI [0.010, 0.039]), which
matches well with an estimation based on the individual-level secondary attack rate in
the household of 17 % [23] (Supplementary material). Crucially, the fraction of
non-local contacts decreased to p = 7 × 10−5 (CI [10−7 , 0.12]), stopping the exponential
growth. Additionally, we estimated the number of exposed people on March 16 to be
nE (March16) = 78 (CI [31, 147]) per million and the number of infectious people to be
nI (March16) = 452 (CI [301, 656]) per million. The fact that during the week before
March 16 there were only 57 infections per million detected in Germany is a hint that a
large fraction of infections went unnoticed at the time, which agrees with other
reports [24].
We also inferred the model parameters for the time period following June 6 when
contact restrictions were lifted. To this end, we used the final time point of simulation
instances from the previous time period as initial condition. For the number of contacts
we obtained a median k = 12 (CI [6, 20]) that matches well with reports of the average
number of daily contacts in Europe of 13.4 [25]. The median fraction of non-local
contacts was estimated as p = 0.03 (CI [0.001, 0.6]), which means it was notably smaller
than before NPIs had been implemented, but larger than in the time period of strict
NPIs. Interestingly, we found that the infection probability was as low in this time
period at pI = 0.02 (CI [0.01, 0.04]) as during the lockdown, which could be the result of
a seasonal effect and of people spending more time outside, which hinders the spread of
airborne diseases such as COVID-19. We inferred rather broad parameter posterior
distributions for this time period, due to the generally low number of infections and
large localized outbreaks. Also, for the time periods without strict NPIs (February 26 to
March 15 and June 6 to September 15), for which we inferred a large fraction of
non-local contacts, the infection probability pI and the number of contacts k were
notably correlated, leading to broader posterior distributions. The prior and posterior
parameter distributions of the network parameters and the infection probability for the
three time periods are shown in Fig. 2.

Disease dynamics in the small-world network
To determine precisely the transitions between the linear and exponential regimes of the
disease dynamics, we performed a parameter scan varying the network parameters p
and k, while keeping the disease-specific parameters and the system size fixed at
n = 105 , pI = 0.02. Thereby, reducing k corresponds to reducing the total number of

the three time periods and the uniform prior distribution (gray). (A) The infection
probability pI reduced from pI = 0.035 (CI [0.025, 0.061]) pre-lockdown to pI = 0.02
(CI [0.01, 0.04]) during the lockdown. After most restrictions were lifted, the infection
probability remained almost unchanged at pI = 0.02 (CI [0.01, 0.04]). (B) The fraction
of non-local contacts in the transmission network p reduced strongly from p = 0.48 (CI
[0.23, 0.94]) to p = 8 × 10−5 (CI [10−7 , 0.12]) when restrictions were put in place and
increased to p = 0.03 (CI [0.001, 0.60]) when they were lifted. (C) The total number
of contacts k decreased strongly from k = 26 (CI [22, 32]) to k = 6 (CI [4, 10]) during
lockdown before increasing again to k = 12 (CI [6, 20]) after restrictions were lifted.
contacts (local and non-local), while reducing p does not change the number of contacts,
but restricts them to locally clustered agents (cliques). We recorded the peak number of
simultaneously infected people, because a central goal of NPIs is to prevent the overload
of the health system, and the total number of infected people after 100 days as a
measure for the total damage to public health, see Fig. 3.
Importantly, the number of infections could be reduced massively by only decreasing
the fraction of non-local contacts in the population, while keeping the total number of
contacts constant. As we have inferred the parameters of the transmission network for
different time periods, we could associate them with regions in our parameter space. If
no NPIs had been implemented and people would not have changed their behavior,
more than 40 % of people could have been infected simultaneously and almost
everybody would have been infected after one year (Fig. 3, blue square). The peak was
reduced to 0.0002 % by the interventions (Fig. 3A, green point). Lifting the NPIs,
moved the system back into the exponential regime, with a projected peak of infections
of 1.3 % and almost 10 % of the population to be infected within one year (Fig. 3,
yellow diamond). As we have shown, reducing the number of contacts can in principle
push the system below the epidemiological threshold leading to extinction of the disease
(see Figs. 1, 3), however the effect is weaker in the regime far away from the threshold
(see Figs. 1,3, k = 10, 12, 14). On the other hand, in the small world regime p ≈ 0,
increasing the fraction of non-local contacts has a dramatic effect: both the peak value
of infected agents and the total number of infected agents increase in a non-linear
manner. Preventing most non-local contacts in the network (p → 0) hinders the spread
of the disease, so that the effective reproduction number fluctuates around 1, and the
cumulative number of infections increases linearly with time as observed in many

6/18

countries after the first NPIs were imposed.

outbreak. (A) Number of simultaneously infected people (peak of infections) in percent

non-local contacts, while keeping the total number of contacts constant. (B) Cumulative
number of infections after one year in percent of the population. Similar to the peak of
infections, the cumulative number of infections can be limited by reducing the fraction
of non-local contacts. Blue square (pre-LD), green point (LD) and yellow diamond

parameter inference for the time periods 26/02–15/03, 16/03–05/06 and 06/06–15/09,
respectively. The NPIs after March 15 prevented an exponential spread of the disease,
but lifting them led to another exponential increase. Shown are contour lines of the
mean of 20 independent realizations of each parameter combination (p, k), while the
other parameters were fixed at n = 105 , pI = 0.02.

Wave speed of infections in the linear regime
We were especially interested in the disease dynamics in the regime p → 0, as this is
where traditional epidemiological models that assume a random transmission network
break down. In the case of only local contacts in the network, the disease spreads like a
wave originating from the initially infectious agent. This wave-like disease spread was
also reported in real networks, such as the air traffic network [26]. In order to calculate
the speed of the infection wave, we used a mean-field approximation of an SIR-like
agent-based model operating on the Watts-Strogatz small-world network. We scaled the
mean-field equations to continuous time t and space x (where the distance is measured
as the number of links along the ring of nodes), and approximated the dynamics by a
set of partial differential equations for the probability densities of susceptible σ(x, t),
infectious ι(x, t) and removed ρ(x, t) agents (see Supplementary material). In particular,
we obtained for the probability density of infectious agents
h

where κI is the infection rate, κR is the removal rate and k̃R := k(k/2 + 1)(k + 1)/12.
The total number of infectious agents I is defined as I := ι dx, where the integral

represents the non-local coupling by non-local contacts. This equation resembles the
Fisher-KPP equation [27] but with a non-local coupling and non-linear diffusion term.
We recover the classical SIR model for p = 1, as expected. For the regime p = 0, we
calculated the minimal speed of disease spread through the network as
q
√
(2)
cmin = 2 kκI k̃(kκI − κR ) ∝ k 2 k.
Notably, the wave speed depends on k in a highly non-linear way. Comparing our
prediction against simulation data of our parameter scan revealed that the wave speed
is proportional to the growth rate of the cumulative infections in the linear regime, see
Fig. 4.

Discussion
We used Bayesian parameter inference to estimate the effect of government
interventions in Germany on the transmission network of COVID-19 assuming it can be
approximated by the Watts-Strogatz network. Our analysis revealed that NPIs lead to a
reduction in transmission probability, number of contacts, and, crucially, to the removal
of almost all contacts outside highly clustered cliques, like households and businesses. In
contrast to standard epidemiological models, in this regime the cumulative number of
infections does not increase exponentially but linearly, with a massively reduced peak of
infections. The dynamics corresponds to a wave-like spread of the disease in the √
network, whose wave speed c we predicted by mean-field theory to scale as c ∝ k 2 k in
dependence of the number of contacts k. At the same time, the effective reproduction
number fluctuates around 1, irrespective of the wave speed, and is therefore not a useful

8/18

observable any more. However, as long as the epidemic threshold is not reached by
reduction of contacts between cliques and reduction of infection probability, the disease
still spreads in the population, which underlines the need for an effective test, trace, and
isolate (TTI) system and, ultimately, a vaccine. In our model we assumed a
Watts-Strogatz transmission network and therefore assigned non-local links randomly.
However, in real social networks, such contacts preferentially link to hubs with a large
number of connections potentially connecting several communities, like grocery stores,
restaurants, religious establishments etc. This results in a scale-free degree distribution
of the network that favors disease spread even more than randomly assigned non-local
links and can lead to outbursts of infections (superspreading events) [17]. Our
parameter inference scheme finds larger values for the total number of social contacts k
than previously reported [25] for the time period before NPIs were put in place.
Superspreading events, which are not explicitly part of our model, can explain this
discrepancy. A recent study which used mobility network data to show that the spread
of the disease is mostly driven by infections at events, which connect different
communities, for example in restaurants and religious establishments, further supports
the importance of non-local contacts [28]. Moreover, empirical studies of the
circumstances under which people got infected revealed that although 46 to 66 % of
transmission is household-based (local contacts), non-local contacts between these
cliques are essential to sustain the epidemic, even if only a low percentage of infections
are caused directly by them [29]. A theoretical study that investigated the effect of
different social network-based distancing strategies, and showed that the most effective
social distancing strategy is to restrict contacts to a single clique (local contacts), and to
eliminate any contacts between the cliques (non-local contacts) [30]. We inferred that
lifting contact restrictions in Germany after June 6 moved the disease dynamics back
into the exponential regime. However, the effective reproduction number remained close
to one, likely due to a strong seasonal effect on the transmission probability. This
seasonal effect likely ended in October leading to a second fast exponential growth of
cases. The German government responded with new NPIs in November, which reduced
the effective reproduction number to a value around one again corresponding to a linear
regime. Our analysis shows that NPIs can reduce the effective reproduction number to
one by eliminating predominantly non-local contacts. These are contacts outside of
clustered cliques like households and work places in restaurants, bars, and clubs.
However, eliminating the disease does most likely require to cut almost all contacts
between different cliques, for example by working from home and not having direct
contact with colleagues. In summary, government interventions should target non-local
contacts in order to efficiently prevent disease spread.

Supporting Information
Model definition
We study an agent-based, discrete-time SEIR-like model on the classical Watts-Strogatz
small world network, representing agents as network nodes. The network is constructed
by, first, connecting every node with its k nearest neighbors in a ring-like topology, and,
second, rewiring every link to a random node with probability p. A sketch of the
network can be found in Fig. S1. Every node i has a discrete state si ∈ S = {S, E, I, R},
corresponding to susceptible (S), exposed (E), infectious (I), and removed (R) states.
Disease progression is dictated by Γ-distributed waiting times inferred from
COVID-19 disease characteristics, as these have been found to describe the disease
best [21]. During every discrete time step t, where the length of the time step

topology and linked to their k nearest neighbors. Next, every link is rewired randomly
with a small probability p. Every agent has one of four states: susceptible (gray), exposed
(gold), infectious (red) or removed (black). The size of network nodes corresponds to
the node degree.
corresponds to 1 day, each susceptible agent can become exposed with probability pI to
every infectious agent they are connected to,
P (si (t + 1) = E|si (t) = S) = 1 − (1 − pI )Ii ,

(3)

where Ii is the number of infectious agents node i is connected to. Upon infection, we
change the agent’s state to exposed, and assign a waiting time τE ∼ Γ(kE , θE ) which we
draw from a Γ-distribution with shape kE and scale θE . During every time step, waiting
times are reduced by 1, τE (t + 1) = τE (t) − 1 if τE (t) > 0. Else, the disease progresses,
si (t + 1) = I, and a new waiting time is assigned from another Γ-distribution
τI ∼ Γ(kI , θI ), with shape kI and scale θI . Finally, when τI ≤ 0, the node is removed,
si (t + 1) = R. A sketch for the SEIR dynamics can be found in Fig. S2. We calculate
the shape and scale of the Γ-distributions from the reported mean time and variance in
the respective states according to

Note that we did not infer these parameters with our Bayesian parameter inference
framework.
In our model we do not account for an inflow of infectious people by travel; we
instead account for the initial surge of infections by placing randomly nE (0) exposed
and nI (0) infectious agents in the population.

Figure S2. Dynamics in the agent-based SEIR model. Susceptible agents can
become exposed, if they are linked to infectious agents (see text). Exposed agents become
infectious after the waiting time τE , and infectious agents are removed after τI . All
nodes are updated simultaneously at every time step t.

Bayesian parameter inference
General approach
We apply approximate Bayesian computation with a sequential Monte-Carlo scheme
(ABC-SMC) to infer the set of parameters Θ = {pI , p, k, nE (0), nI (0)} of our
agent-based model. We always keep the total number of agents fixed at n = 3 · 105 . To
this end, we employ the Python package pyABC [31]. In short, the algorithm employs
sequential importance sampling over generations T = 1, ..., nT . In generation T , the
algorithm draws sets of parameters θi from a given proposal distribution and
consequently simulates data C (i) from the model, until nABC instances were accepted
based on the comparison to observed data via a distance function D(C (i) , Cobs ) and
acceptance threshold εT , D(C (i) , Cobs ) ≤ εT . As distance function, we choose the
absolute difference between new cases in the model instance C (i) (t) and the respective
reports for Germany Cobs (t),

They are compared to the seven-day rolling average of new case reports in Germany
Cobs (t) provided by John Hopkins University [20] to account for the weekly fluctuation
in reporting. Acceptance of model instances depends on the acceptance threshold T of
generation T , which we choose as the median of the distances of the accepted distances
of the previous generation

When nABC model instances have been accepted, the algorithm constructs new proposal
distributions from the accepted instances to allow high acceptance rates while
decreasing the threshold [32]. In particular, for the continuous variables it employs a
multivariate normal distribution with adaptive covariance matrix based on the sample
covariance matrix, whose scale parameter is determined by a grid search with 5-fold
cross validation and refitting on the whole data set. We compute the discrete numbers
of initially exposed and infectious people nE (0), nI (0) by rounding the continuous
output of the multivariate normal distribution. We can do this without a large error as
these parameters vary smoothly over a large range. For the parameter k we employ an
adaptive, discrete transition that assigns probabilities to all possible parameter values
directly from the frequency of the respective value in the population of accepted
particles with additional random jumps (with probability 0.3) to ensure absolute
continuity of the prior..
The process is repeated until the acceptance threshold is sufficiently low; we
especially ensured that the threshold is considerably lower than the difference between
the reported cases and the seven-day rolling average of cases.
February 26 - March 15
The early phase of the epidemic is characterized by a low number of cumulative
infections. We can therefore directly use the absolute numbers of new infections as
input for our agent-based model, as we are always far away from the epidemic threshold.
We choose broad, uniform priors for all the parameters that can be found in table S1.
Note that the probability for random connections varies on several orders of magnitude
p ∈ [10−6 , 100 ] and we therefore infer this parameter on a logarithmic scale. We use
nABC = 100 and obtain an effective sample size of neff ≈ 46.

March 16 - June 6
In the time period from March 16 to June 6 Germany recorded 177652 cases in total.
This means that it becomes computationally unfeasible to replicate the population
directly in our model without noticing a strong effect of the removed (immune) agents.
Therefore, we scale down the total number of infections to our system size and compare
the relative number of cases per 300,000 people instead. Assuming our hypothesis that
the NPIs lead to a strongly clustered transmission network holds, we expect a large
number of unconnected communities in Germany in that time period, which we
represent as distinct model instances. We use nABC = 200 and obtain an effective
sample size of neff ≈ 105.
June 7 - September 15
To infer the parameters of the system during this time period we first sample
parameters from the posterior distribution which we obtained for the previous time
period, and let the system evolve for 81 days (corresponding to the time period from

March 16 to June 6). Next, we change the infection probability pI and assign a new
transmission network based on a new set of parameters p, k. For these parameters, we
choose the same prior distributions as for the previous time period, see Table S3. We
use nABC = 200 and obtain an effective sample size of neff ≈ 164.

Parameter scan
To investigate the disease dynamics in the small-world network, we perform a parameter
scan. We vary the network parameters p, k while keeping the rest of the parameters
fixed at n = 105 , pI = 0.02, nE (0) = 0, nI (0) = 10. Our choice for pI during the
parameter scan is motivated by reports of the COVID-19 individual-level secondary
attack rate (SAR) in the household of 17 % [23]. Inverting eq. 3 we obtain
√
pI = 1 − τI 1 − SAR ≈ 0.02.
(9)
We vary the number of contacts from k = 2, 4, . . . , 24 and sample the probability for
random contacts in eleven equally-spaced steps on the log scale from log10 p = −5, . . . , 0.
As initial condition, 10 random agents are set to the infectious state and the system is
simulated until there are no more exposed and infectious agents. We repeat this process
five times per parameter combination (p, k). As output we determine the peak of
simultaneously infectious people
npeak (p, k) := max nI (t, p, k),
t

(10)

and the cumulative infection curves
N (t, p, k) = nI (t, p, k) + nR (t, p, k).

(11)

In the highly clustered regime p = 10−5 we calculate the linear growth rate from the
cumulative infections as


N (tmax , k) − N (tmin , k)
c(k) :=
,
(12)
tmax − tmin
where we neglect the initial exponential growth by skipping tmin = hτI i = 10 time steps.

16/18

Mathematical analysis
Epidemic threshold
We can calculate an upper bound for the number of contacts kc by demanding R0 = 1,
i. e. a single infectious person in a network of susceptible people will effect on average
one other person. Using eq. 3 we can calculate the expected number of infections as
R0 = 1 = kc [1 − (1 − pI )τI ] ⇐⇒ kc =

1
.
1 − (1 − pI )τI

(13)

For pI = 0.02 and hτI i ≈ 10 we obtain kc ≈ 5.5.
Derivation of differential-equation approximation
In order to predict the linear growth of infections in the highly clustered small-world
network, we consider a simplified variant of our original model, where we neglect the
exposed state and assume that the progression times are distributed exponentially.
Then we describe the state of an agent j in our model by a set of three Boolean
stochastic variables sj (t), ij (t), rj (t) = 0, 1, where sj + ij + rj = 1 and sj = 1 indicates
that the agent is susceptible, ij = 1 means he is infectious and if rj = 1 he is removed.
We represent the event ”agent j becomes infectious at time t” by the Boolean stochastic
variable αj (t) with
P (αj (t) = 1) = 1 − (1 − pI )Ij (t) ,
(14)
P
where Ij (t) := m∈Nj im (t) is the number of infectious agents in the neighborhood Nj
of agent j. Similarly, the event ”agent j is removed at time t” is given by the stochastic
variable βj (t) with
P (βj (t) = 1) = pR = 1/τI .
(15)
During one time step the state of all agents changes as
sj (t + 1)

=

sj (t) − αj (t)sj (t),

(16)

ij (t + 1)

=

ij (t) + αj (t)sj (t) − βj (t)ij (t),

(17)

rj (t + 1)

=

rj (t) + βj (t)ij (t).

(18)

We want to calculate the expected value of the state variable under a mean-field
approximation, i. e. we replace the expected value of a function f (X) of any random
variable X by the function evaluated at the expected value of the random variable,
hf (X)i ≈ f (hXi). In particular, this also means that we neglect any correlations
between the state variables of neighboring nodes. We denote the expected values of the
state variables as σj (t) := hsj (t)i , ιj (t) := hij (t)i , ρj := hrj (t)i. For the expected
number of infectious neighbors we obtain
hIj (t)i = (1 − p)

where N is the total number of nodes in the network and p is the probability of a
random link (see Model definition). We also introduce a small time step length τ > 0
and the continuous time t̂ = τ t along with the transition rates κI := pI /τ, κR := pR /τ .
In the following we only consider the continous time and drop the hat for better
readability. For τ → 0 we can then approximate the expected value of αj (t) by a Taylor
approximation around pI = 0 as
P (αj (t) = 1) = 1 − (1 − κI τ )Ij (t) ≈ κI τ Ij (t).

(20)

17/18

Approximating all time-dependent functions by their Taylor approximation up to first
order f (t + τ ) ≈ f (t) + τ f 0 (t) and rearranging terms we obtain the following set of
non-linear ODEs for the expected value of the agents’ states
σj0 (t)

ι0j (t)
ρ0j (t)

= κI σj (t) hIj (t)i − κR ιj (t),

= κR ιj (t).

(23)

Note that this set of ODEs does not depend on the time step length any more and that
the equations are linked by the expected number of infected in every node’s
neighborhood given by eq. 19. We can further simplify our system by considering the
regime N → ∞, and introducing the spatial step length ∆x > 0 so that
N ∆x = L = const. We can then replace the state probabilities σj (t), ιj (t), ρj (t) by the
probability densities σ(x + j∆x, t), ι(x + j∆x, t), ρ(x + j∆x, t). This allows us to
approximate the expected number of infectious agents in the neighborhood by expanding
the terms ι(x + m∆x, t) ≈ ι(x, t) + m∆x∂x ι(x, t) + m∆x/2∂xx ι(x, t) to obtain

Calculation of the infection wave speed in the small-world network
To calculate the wave speed of infections we consider the regime p = 0, so that we can
neglect the non-local coupling by I(t) in eq. 25. We also notice that there are two steady
states σ = 1 and ρ = 1, and we suspect that they are connected by a travelling wave, as
the first steady state is unstable while the second one is stable if kκI > κR . Next we
make the wave ansatz ι(x, t) = ι(z = x − ct) with the wave speed c. For z → ∞ (far
from the wave front) we expect ρ → 0, σ → 1 and we can therefore write eq. 26 as
