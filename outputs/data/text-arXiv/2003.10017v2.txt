Abstract
We present an empirical algorithm to forecast the evolution of the number of COVID19 symptomatic patients in the early stages of the pandemic spread and after strict social
distancing interventions. The algorithm is based on a low dimensional model for the
variation of the exponential growth rate that decreases after the implementation of strict
social distancing measures. From the observable data given by the number of tested
positive, our model estimates the number of infected hindcast introducing in the model
formulation the incubation time. We also use the model to follow the number of infected
patients who later die using the registered number of deaths and the distribution time
from infection to death. The relationship of the proposed model with the SIR models is
studied. Model parameters fitting is done by minimizing a quadratic error between the
data and the model forecast. An extended model is also proposed that allows a longer term
forecast. An online implementation of the model is avalaible at www.ctim.es/covid19

Introduction

In this work we propose an empirical parametric model to forecast the evolution of the number
of COVID-19 symptomatic patients, N (t), after social distancing interventions. This study
presents a numerical analysis of the effect of the confinement phase of the pandemic. It attempts to predict the evolution of the number of cases and deaths, based on past observations
and assuming that the social distancing policy is steady or evolves slowly. Hence the main
assumptions we take are:
1. The evolution of the cumulative number of contaminated patients, y(t), grows at an
exponential rate (that we name a), during a period of time t0 . We thus have y 0 (t) =
ay(t). Then, after social distancing measures are imposed the exponential rate r(t) (such
that y 0 (t) = r(t)y(t)) decreases until it attains the value 0 at time t1 . In this study, we
considered first the following type of evolution for the exponential rate:

 a if 0 ≤ t ≤ t0
b if t ∈ (t0 , t1 ]
r1 (t) =
(1)

0 if
t > t1
1

but we realized that the next parametric model, with the same number of unknowns, was
more flexible and accurate:


  a γ if 0 ≤ t ≤ t0
−t
r(t) =
(2)
a tt11−t
if t ∈ (t0 , t1 ]
0


0
if
t > t1 .
In the first model the parameters for r1 (t) are a, b, t0 and t1 , and the parameters for r(t)
are a, γ, t0 and t1 . The values for a, b and γ are always positive. The larger the value of
γ the stronger the effect of the social distancing measures on the growth of N (t).
2. The evolution of the number N (t) of the symptomatic patients at time t depends on the
evolution law of contaminated patients, and on the law of the incubation period.
3. At the beginning of the epidemic outbreak, the data of tested positive patients provided
by most countries can be assumed to concern mostly symptomatic patients. This is a
reasonable assumption in the countries where tests were performed only on patients which
show some symptoms. It is important to point out that the available databases about
the coronavirus expansion make no distinction between infected subjects which show
symptoms or not. If we assume that the number of symptomatic patients is proportional
to the number of registered infected subjects, the model still works. This is a reasonable
assumption as long as a country keeps the same infection test policy. If a country changes
its testing policy and starts testing more subjects, then many non-symptomatic subjects
are going to be included in the dataset, which can strongly deteriorate the accuracy of
any observational model. This is why our model (2) for the decay of the exponential rate
is merely empirical, and aims at the simplest formulation possible.
4. The social distancing measures are taken at the beginning of the epidemic and there are
many more exposed subjects than infected and recovered ones, so that we can assume
that the variation of the symptomatic patients only depends on the existing contaminated
patients and the influence of the social distancing measures (see below the relation with
the SIR model).

Regarding the distribution of the incubation period, Lauer et al. in [6], using the data of
181 patients approximate the distribution of the incubation period as a log-normal distribution.
The cumulative distribution function of this log-normal is given by


dx if
t>0
(3)
F (t) =

otherwise
with µ = 1.621 and σ = 0.418.
The rest of the paper is organized in the following way: in section 2 we study the solution
of equation (4). In section 3, we analyze the relation of this model with the usual SIR model.
In section 4, we present a short discussion about the lack of reliability of the available data
of the COVID-19 spread. In section 5, we present the algorithm proposed to fit the model to
the data. In section 6, we present an extension of the empirical model to the forecast of the
number of deaths. Section 7 presents the experimental setup. Finally section 8 concludes.

The empirical evolution model

The continuous version of the evolution of contaminated subjects, y(t), following an exponential
grow, r(t), is given by the very basic differential equation:
y 0 (t) = r(t)y(t).
This equation can be solved explicitly, and in the case of r(t) given by (2) the solution is

and it is attained at t1 . Therefore the impact of the social distancing measures is determined
by the value :

The smaller this value, the more effective the social distancing interventions. We notice that
the peak in the new daily contaminated patients is obtained when y 0 (t) changes sign which
corresponds to y 00 (t) = 0. Using a straightforward computation we obtain that the peak is
attained at

We observe that since F (t) converges to 1 when t goes to ∞, then
a

Limt→∞ N (t) = Ceat0 e γ+1 (t1 −t0 ) − C.
Notice that y(0) = C, N (0) = 0 and there is a delay between the evolutions of y(t) − C and
N (t), corresponding to the time required by contaminated subjects to become symptomatic.
Notice that the official number of cases is related to N (t) which is the variable that can be
observable. N (t) does not follow, in general an exponential growth. In fact:
R t1 0

In practice, the observable data is the number of registered tested positive patients. An
extra time is required from the moment the patient shows symptoms until the test is done and
3

it is finally recorded as tested positive. This time strongly depends on the in-country logistics.
In this work we assume that this time is about 2 days, so in expression 7 we replace F (t − s)
by F (t − s − 2). This modification does not change the profile of N (t), it simply represents an
extra delay between the evolution of contaminated subjects and the evolution of the registered
tested positive subjects.

2.1

An extended model to track different trend modifications

The exponential growth given by equation (2) is very simple and it is useful to compute an
estimation of y(t) after an strict lockdown is implemented, this estimation covers from the
epidemic outbreak until a certain time after the daily peak. However if we want to go further
and to approximate the evolution for a longer time we need to extend the model to have more
flexibility in order to fit the epidemic spread. In fact, the above basic model can be easily
extended in the following way: let {tk0 , tk1 }k=1,..,K be 2 increasing sequences of real numbers
satisfying tk+1
< tk1 . {tk0 } represent times where a change is expected in the evolution trend of
0
the epidemic. Then the exponential growth (2) can be extended in the following way:

(8)

Notice that r(t) can be discontinuous at tk0 because a relaxation of social distancing measures will
definitely produce an abrupt modification in the exponential growth of the epidemic. We point
out that the function r(t) is always decreasing except at the possible points of discontinuity
tk0 . In particular, the model is not well adapted to scenarios where the growth rate can grow
continuously, such as a second epidemic wave.

Relation with the SIR model

The basic SIR model separates the population in three compartments: S(t) (the number of
susceptible), I(t) (the number of infectious), and R(t) (the number of recovered). It should be
mentioned in this model that the number of dead is negligible. We can also consider that R(t)
is the sum of recovered and deceased. Each member of the population typically progresses from
susceptible to infectious to recovered. The basic SIR model to estimate S(t), I(t) and R(t) is
the following system of ordinary differential equations:
dS
dt
dI
dt
dR
dt

I
= −β I+S+R
S 

S
S
= β I+S+R − γ I = R0 I+S+R
− 1 γI
= γI,

where β and γ are parameters which depend on the particular disease. R0 = βγ , named the
reproductive number, is one of the key parameters in transmission models and it represents
the number of secondary infections that arise from a typical primary case in a completely
4

susceptible population. Notice that S(t), the number of susceptible subjects, is a decreasing
function. When the ratio between S(t) and the total population satisfies
1
S(t)
=
,
I(t) + S(t) + R(t)
R0
we obtain dI
(t) = 0. Hence the peak of infected subjects is attained, and from that time,
dt
the number of infected subjects starts decreasing. Notice that the larger R0 , the larger the
time required to attain the infection peak. We observe that in our model, in the evolution of
contaminated patients, y(t), we include the infected and recovered subjects, so y(t) = I(t)+R(t)
and then using the SIR model we obtain that
S(t)
dy
(t) = β
(y(t) − R(t)).
(9)
dt
I(t) + S(t) + R(t)
The SIR model with constant γ and β and the conclusions about the peak of infected subjects
make sense only if the virus propagates freely across time, but everything changes if we impose
social distancing measures to the population. A natural way to include human interventions
in the SIR model is to replace β by a time dependent function β(t). This strategy has been
used by different authors in different contexts using extended versions of the SIR models. For
instance in [3], the authors propose the following exponential type function:
β(t) = β1 + (β0 − β1 )e−q(t−t0 )+
another exponential type function has been introduced in [7]:
τ (t) = τ1 e−µ(t−N )+
In [1] the following rational function is proposed:
β(t) = β0 (1 − ρ(t − t0 )/t)
In [4] the author proposes the function
τ (t) = τ0 [1 − µ(t − N )+ ]+ .

(10)

We observe that this is a particular case of the function (2) defining r(t) where a = τ0 , µ =
1/(t1 − t0 ), N = t0 and γ = 1. The only difference of this function with r(t) is that in r(t) we
add the power γ to modulate the way the exponential growth rate decreases.
In this work we assume that social distancing interventions govern the evolution of contaminated subjects rather than the SIR dynamic and we replace equation (9) by
dy
(t) = r(t)y(t).
dt
Therefore we include in the term r(t) the impact of the human interventions, the influence of
the ratio between S(t) and the total population and the influence of R(t). The latter makes
sense if we are at the beginning of the pandemic (so R(t) ≈ 0) or if we assume that R(t) is
proportional to y(t). By focusing just on the number of contaminated subjects we reduce the
complexity of the problem and we avoid to deal with the balance between infected, exposed
and recovered patients which is very difficult to estimate properly due to the lack of accuracy
in the data we can manage about the number of infected subjects. We point out that in our
model y(t) is the number of infected patients which show symptoms, which is the data most
countries provide when using PCR tests.

A discussion about the reliability of the existing data
about the coronavirus expansion in terms of the evaluation of the impact of social distancing interventions

Tested positive subjects: First, we stress again that what we can observe is the evolution of
tested positive subjects, which is quite different from the evolution of contaminated subjects.
This value strongly depends on the testing policy which can change across the time. If the
testing policy does not change too much during the period of time used to estimate the model,
our forecast will still be valid to some extent. This value has the advantage that it is the first
one to react to the installation of social distancing measures.
Symptomatic tested positive subjects: With the existing variety of testing policies, this
value seems to be more reliable than just tested positive subjects. On the one hand official data
make no distinction between symptomatic and asymptomatic tested positive subjects. On the
other hand, when the health system is overwhelmed, many symptomatic subjects not requiring
hospitalization are simply sent home without testing.
Number of deaths: Theoretically, this is a reliable data, but when the health system is
overwhelmed a significant number of patients die without being counted as affected by the
coronavirus, so the accuracy of this data depends on the capacity of the health system to
properly count the deaths. This is far from being the case when the health system is completely
overwhelmed.
Number of hospitalizations or number of patients in intensive care: Again, theoretically, these data are more reliable than the number of tested positive, but again, in the case
of a health system completely overwhelmed, the quality of these data is strongly deteriorated.
Another issue with these data is the way they are provided. In some cases, the official data
refer to the current situation where the patients which leave the hospital or reanimation are
removed from the statistics.
Another important issue in the data quality is the time required for a new case to be included
in official statistics. For example, if new PCR positive tests and new antibody positive tests are
added at the same day, the quality of the data deteriorates seriously. Indeed, both detection
correspond to infections at very different past times! Even using only PCR tests, the time from
the presentation of symptoms to inclusion in official statistics must be taken into account. In
Spain, this time is distributed with a median of 6 days; in 25% of cases it is even more than 10
days. This delay deteriorates the usability of the data, and hinders a short-term prediction of
the evolution of the epidemic.

The algorithm

As discussed in the previous section, the data we use are far for being reliable. In our approach
we use a very simple model with few parameters in the hope that the simplicity of the model
can compensate in some way for the lack of accuracy of the data and provide a big picture of
the evolution of pandemic expansion after social distancing interventions. We observe that if
6

we have not enough data after the implementation of social distancing measures, the parameters γ and t1 cannot be computed properly from the data. To reduce the uncertainty in the
calculation of these parameters, we can set ”a priori” the expected value of the effectiveness of
the containment effectiveness given by Ma,γ,t1 ,t0 , defined in (6), based on the values obtained for
other countries which have implemented previously the same kind of social distancing measures.
That is, we can constrain the effectiveness to satisfy
Ma,γ,t1 ,t0 =

a
(t1 − t0 ) = M0
γ+1

(11)

where M0 > 0.

Parameter adjustment

Given a dataset, D(t), of the number of symptomatic patients across the time for a region, we
fix the parameters by minimizing the quadratic mean error

Error[tmin ,tmax ] (C, a, γ, t0 , t1 , t̃) = Ptmax

t=tmin

X

w(t) t=tmin

w(t) D(t) − N (t + t̃)

2

,

(13)

where t̃ is the translation of N (t) to fit D(t). The interval [tmin , tmax ] is the range of values we
use to fit the parameters of the model. We assign the following weight w(t) to each data value
in the model estimation:
w(t) = (t − tmin + 1)α

(14)

where α ≥ 0. When α = 0 all points in the dataset have the same weight (w(t) ≡ 1). The
higher the value of α the more weight it will be giving to the latest values of the dataset.
To adjust the model parameters, we use a Newton-Raphson type method combined with an
extensive search exploration of potential parameter interval values.
Computation of C: we observe that C is a scale factor and if the other parameters of the
model are given, C can be estimated by equating to zero the derivative of the error (13) with
respect to C, which yields the following expression for C:
Ptmax

w(t)D(t)N1 (t + t̃)
C = Ptmaxt=tmin
t=tmin w(t)N1 (t + t̃)N1 (t + t̃)
7

(15)

where N1 (t + t̃) = N (t + t̃) is computed using C = 1 and the other given parameters. We point
out that the values of C and t0 are very related, in terms of the evolution of contaminated
subjects, y(t). Indeed the values C 0 = Cea and t00 = t0 − 1 provide the same results as C and
t0 .

5.3

Computing the minimum of Error[tmin ,tmax ] (C, a, γ, t0 , t1 , t̃)

First, we observe that, in general, due to the strong variation of the available data, the quadratic
error, Error[tmin ,tmax ] (C, a, γ, t0 , t1 , t̃) can have several local minima. To avoid getting trapped
in a spurious local minimum, we use a basic optimization strategy, where we combine massive
evaluations of Error[tmin ,tmax ] (C, a, γ, t0 , t1 , t̃) in large discrete intervals with a basic NewtonRaphson type method to improve locally a, γ, t̃. To simplify the complexity, we use (15) to
express C as a function of the rest of parameters, that is, C ≡ C(a, γ, t0 , t1 , t̃), so the quadratic
error becomes Error[tmin ,tmax ] (a, γ, t0 , t1 , t̃) ≡ Error[tmin ,tmax ] (C(a, γ, t0 , t1 , t̃), a, γ, t0 , t1 , t̃). The
times t0 and t1 are computed in integer precision and the rest of parameters in floating precision.
The computation of t0 and t1 in integer precision has little influence on the final result because
small variations of t0 are mostly compensated modifying C and small variations of t1 are mostly
compensated modifying γ.

MAIN STEPS OF THE OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM
• Step 1: Computation of tmin and tmax . We define tmin as the the time when the data
starts to grow with an exponential growth with a minimum value of 10, that is:
tmin = min{t : D(t − 2) > 10 and D(t) > 1.1D(t − 1) and D(t − 1) > 1.1D(t − 2)}
and we fix tmax = min{tmin + N1 , tc }, where N1 is a parameter of the algorithm to fix the
number of days used to compute the model. tc is the max available time in the data set
observation.
• Step 2: Initial estimation of t̃. We fix initially the following reference values for the rest
of parameters: a = 0.13, γ = 2, t0 = 17 and t1 = 52. Then t̃ is computed initially in
integer precision as
t̃0 =

arg min

Error[tmin ,tmax ] (a, γ, t0 , t1 , k)

k∈N ∩[kmin ,kmax ]

where [kmin , kmax ] has been fixed experimentally as [kmin , kmax ] =[−26 − tmin , 10 − tmin ].
• Step 3: Computing an initial minimum evaluating the energy in parameter intervals.
For each parameter p ∈ {a, γ, t0 , t1 , t̃} we define a discrete interval Ip = {p1 , .., pNp } (in
the case of p = t̃, Ip is a neighborhood of t̃0 computed above) and we define the set
I = Ia × Iγ × It0 × It1 × It̃ . We compute a first minimum, P0 , as
P0 = arg min Error[tmin ,tmax ] (a, γ, t0 , t1 , t̃)
(a,γ,t0 ,t1 ,t̃)∈I

This ”brute force” technique has the advantage that it can be easily implemented using
parallelization and to a certain extent, it avoids getting trapped in spurious local minima.
8

Once P0 is computed, it is improved using a basic Newton-Raphson method to optimize
a, γ, t̃.
• Step 4. Improving iteratively the minimum location: For k = 0, 1, 2, .. we use a small
discrete neighborhood, NPk , of Pk , and we define Pk+1 as
Pk+1 =

arg min

Error[tmin ,tmax ] (a, γ, t0 , t1 , t̃)

(a,γ,t0 ,t1 ,t̃)∈NPk

after this initial estimation, Pk+1 is improved using the Newton-Raphson method. Iterations stop when
Error(Pk ) − Error(Pk+1 )
< T OL
Error(Pk )
where T OL is a convergence parameter (we fix T OL = 10−6 in the algorithm implementation). This iterative procedure allows to improve the minimum estimation. In particular,
it allows the minimum to go beyond the initial parameter interval I.
As quoted before, at the beginning of the epidemic spread, when not much data is available
it can be useful to fix the expected value of effectiveness of the containment effectiveness given
by Ma,γ,t1 ,t0 defined in (6), in that case the value of Ma,γ,t1 ,t0 becomes a parameter of the
algorithm and this value constraints the parameter optimization steps of the algorithm.

5.4

Adaptation of the algorithm to the extended model

In the case where the exponential growth is given by the extended model (8), we compute the
unknowns of the model, given by C, t̃ and tk0 , tk1 , ak , γk for k=1,..,K, in the following way:
1. We compute C, t̃ and t10 , t11 , a1 , γ1 using the algorithm explained above.
2. for each k=2,..,K, we compute tk0 , tk1 , ak , γk iteratively in the following way:
P
• tmax = min{tmin + ki=1 Ni , tc }. (where Nk is a parameter of the algorithm to fix
how many days we consider to compute the model k)
• tk0 = t̃ + tmax − Nk
• We compute tk1 , ak , γk by minimizing the quadratic error in the interval [tmin , tmax ]
with respect to tk1 , ak and γk .

Forecasting the number of deaths

We can easily extend the model to the case of the evolution of the number of deaths. In this
case y(t) represents the number of contaminated subjects who die and N (t) the registered
number of deaths. The only thing we have to change is the cumulative distribution F (t). In
that case we have to use the infection-to-death time distribution. In [2], the authors model this
distribution as the sum of two independent random times, both being Gamma distributed with
mean 5.1 days and coefficient of variation 0.86 and 18.8 days and a coefficient of variation 0.45
respectively. The infection-to-death distribution is therefore given by
9

if rm · (Gamma(5.1, 0.86) + Gamma(18.8, 0.45))
where if rm is the population averaged over the age structure of a given country. As if rm is
a constant factor, we can assume that if rm = 1 because in our model, this factor will be
compensated by the constant factor C. Therefore, changing, in expression (7), F (t) by the
cumulative distribution of the infection-to-death time distribution we can follow the evolution
of the number of deaths.
In the same way, assuming that we know the time distribution of other registered values
as for instance, the infection-to-hospitalization time distribution, we can forecast, using the
same model, the evolution of the corresponding registered value. We point out that the time
distribution of the COVID-19 registered values is a topic under investigation and the results
can change in the next future. For instance, the study presented in [9] suggests that there are
two sub-populations in delays between hospitalization and death: individuals that die quickly
upon hospital admission (15% of fatal cases, mean time to death of 0.67 days) and individuals
who die after longer time periods (85% of fatal cases, mean time to death of 13.2 days). The
combination of Gamma distributions presented above does not reflect this behavior. In the
official Spain report [8] using the information of 9765 patients, it is estimated that, in the case
of men, the time from the onset of symptoms to death has a median of 11 days with quartiles
Q1 = 7 and Q3 = 16. In the case of women, these values are median= 10, Q1 = 6 and Q3 = 14.
Based on the values for men an women, we approximate, experimentally, the distribution of the
time from the onset of symptoms to death as a lognormal(µ = 2.351375257, σ = 0.6011434688)
distribution. The median of this distribution is = 10.5, Q1 = 7 and Q3 = 15.75. So we can
approximate the distribution of the time from infection to death as the following mixtures of
lognormal distributions
lognormal(µ = 1.621, σ = 0.418) + lognormal(µ = 2.351375257, σ = 0.6011434688),

(16)

where the first one corresponds to the time infection to the onset of symptoms (see (3)). In
Fig. 1, we compare the profile of the distributions using the mixture of Gammas proposed in
[2] and the one obtained using the mixture of lognormals (16). We point out that they are
quite different. Using the mixture of Gammas, a patient takes considerably more time to die
from the infection. In Fig. 2 we compare the forecasts obtained by the proposed model using
the infection to death time distribution proposed in [2] and the one obtained using (16). We
observe that the forecast of deaths are quite similar but the forecasts of fatally affected subjects
are very different. We believe that the one obtained by the lognormals is more plausible because
in the other one the number of fatally affected subjects goes to zero too quickly with respect
to the evolution of deaths. In the IPOL online demo we use the one obtained by the mixture
of lognormals. However, we believe that this approximation is not very accurate either, and as
quoted before, we think that the knowledge and accuracy of the time distribution of the basic
epidemic factors will be improved in the near future.

is zero, then no extended model is computed. Using two extended models and the basic
model (the first one) we can manage situations where the pandemic outbreak initially
starts to growth exponentially and then, due to lockdown measures the growth rate starts
to decrease (this is managed by the basic model), then the growth rate changes its trend,
because, for instance, the test capacity of the country improves (this can be managed by
the first extended model) and finally the evolution stabilizes around a baseline (this can
be managed by the second extended model). Many countries have followed these three
phases when a strict lockdown has been implemented. We point out that the model we
propose is not expected to simulate properly the impact of mild social distancing measures
or of a second wave.

Conclusions

The proposed algorithm for the basic model is able to forecast quite well the evolution of the
epidemic spread in its early stage when little information is available and strict social distancing
measures are implemented. If we fix manually the value of Ma,γ,t0 ,t1 using the one obtained
for other countries where similar social distancing measures have been implemented we can
improve the results in a significant way. We have experimentally estimated, using the cases of
Italy, Spain and France, that the value of Ma,γ,t0 ,t1 when a strict lockdown is applied is bewteen
1.4 and 1.7.
The formulation of the extended model allows us to properly track the evolution of the full
course of the first epidemic wave.
A critical reader will have noticed that contrarily to the SIR models, our model based on
the r(t) law is empirical. This is justified by three facts that we have stressed:
a) Given the huge observation noise it is better to work with a very low dimensional model,
so that we estimate a very few empirical parameters, rather than the many that cannot actually
be estimated;
b) As highlight in the paper, to cope with the influence of the social distance measures, SIR
models also require to define empirical models for the growth rate β(t).
c) The virtue of the proposed empirical model is that it may cope not only with noise, but
also with a variation of the very definition of observed variables. This variation definitely happens. Indeed, the various administrations are progressively changing the way they make their
statistics about the observed cases. They also adapt their testing policy, and ultimately they
also adjust their containment policy. Thus, an adapted parametric approach to the prediction
might be adequate to overcome all these limitations.
