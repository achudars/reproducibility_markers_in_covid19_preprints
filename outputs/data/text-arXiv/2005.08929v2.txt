Abstract
This paper investigates whether security markets price the effect of social distancing on firms operations. We document that firms that are more resilient to
social distancing significantly outperformed those with lower resilience during
the COVID-19 outbreak, even after controlling for the standard risk factors.
Similar cross-sectional return differentials already emerged before the COVID19 crisis: the 2014-19 cumulative return differential between more and less
resilient firms is of similar size as during the outbreak, suggesting growing
awareness of pandemic risk well in advance of its materialization. Finally, we
use stock option prices to infer the markets return expectations after the onset
of the pandemic: even at a two-year horizon, stocks of more pandemic-resilient
firms are expected to yield significantly lower returns than less resilient ones,
reflecting their lower exposure to disaster risk. Hence, going forward, markets
appear to price exposure to a new risk factor, namely, pandemic risk.

Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting lockdown are currently inflicting massive
harm on the economy, in the form of unprecedented output losses, massive redundancies and countless bankruptcies. The effects of the pandemic are widely perceived
not to be purely transient, as witnessed by current changes in expectations (Coibion
et al., 2020b; Hanspal et al., 2020; Coibion et al., 2020a) and in asset prices (Gormsen
and Koijen, 2020). But its effects are also proving to be quite heterogeneous: some
firms, especially in high-tech industries, appear to have adapted quite well to social
distancing requirements, for instance by resorting extensively to teleworking, while
others, such as food catering, travel and tourism, could not do so, as the nature of
their business requires close contact with customers and/or among employees. This
heterogeneity is also visible in the diverging stock price performance of companies: in
the first quarter of 2020, stocks such as Apple, Microsoft and Google outperformed
the market, yielding market-adjusted returns of 19%, 12% and 33% respectively,
while others such as Marriott, United Airlines and Royal Caribbean massively underperformed, with market-adjusted returns of −38%, −53% and −66%.
Hence, the COVID-19 shock has unearthed a hitherto hidden economic watershed,
namely, that between disaster-resilient activities and non-resilient ones. Insofar as
the COVID-19 pandemic persists or revives in the near future, or similar disasters
may occur further in the future, resilience may become a key firm attribute, one
which will be relevant to investors’ portfolio choices, banks’ lending policies, and
managers’ investment decisions.
In this paper, we investigate whether asset prices reveal growing investors’ awareness that pandemic resilience, defined as reliance on technologies and/or organizational structures that are robust to social distancing, is priced by security markets.
To measure firms’ resilience to pandemics, we rely on measures recently introduced
in labor economics by Dingel and Neiman (2020), Hensvik et al. (2020) and Koren
and Pető (2020), intended to capture the extent to which firms’ operations are compatible with social distancing. These measures quantify the degree to which jobs can
be done from home and do not rely on human interaction in physical proximity.
We then test whether the stocks of more resilient companies have generated excess
returns, after controlling for market risk and other established risk factors, before
and/or during the COVID-19 shock. We find this to be the case: pandemic-resilient
stocks outperformed less resilient ones not only between late February and March

–1–

2020, i.e. during the outbreak of the pandemic, but also in the previous six years, in
which their cumulative excess return was of similar magnitude as during the crisis.
Furthermore, we investigate the returns that investors expect the two stock classes
to generate after the COVID-19 shock, by extracting the expected stock returns
implied by option prices. We find that, going forward, pandemic-resilient stocks
are expected to generate lower excess returns, indicating that, since the COVID-19
pandemic materialized, the market has priced a disaster premium.
Thus, our research question is not only whether, but also when financial markets
started pricing disaster risk and resilience to it. Interestingly, our evidence indicates
that investors became gradually aware of such risk even before the COVID-19 shock,
and they consider such risk to be still price-relevant, even after it has materialized.
Given the largely unanticipated nature of the current pandemic, it may appear
unrealistic that investors became cognizant to its threat in advance. But it should
be recalled that as early as five years before the COVID-19 outbreak, high-profile
business and political leaders already issued public warnings of the risk of devastating
epidemics. For instance, in a speech delivered on 2 December 2014 at the NIH about
the response to the Ebola epidemic, U.S. President Barack Obama stated:
“There may and likely will come a time in which we have both an airborne
disease that is deadly. And in order for us to deal with that effectively,
we have to put in place an infrastructure – not just here at home, but
globally – that allows us to see it quickly, isolate it quickly, respond to
it quickly. [...] So that if and when a new strain of flu, like the Spanish
flu, crops up five years from now or a decade from now, we’ve made the
investment and we’re further along to be able to catch it. It is a smart
investment for us to make. It’s not just insurance; it is knowing that down
the road we’re going to continue to have problems like this – particularly
in a globalized world where you move from one side of the world to the
other in a day.”
Similarly, in 2015, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates gave a TED Talk about pandemics that attracted widespread attention. In this talk he warned that in 2014
the world had barely avoided a global outbreak of Ebola, largely because of pure
luck, and, just like Obama, alerted the audience to the need to prepare for future
pandemics, from scenario planning to vaccine research and health worker training.
Hence, it cannot be ruled out that the most alert investors may have started taking

–2–

into account such concerns in their portfolio choices well in advance of the current
pandemic, shying away from the stocks of companies that would be less resilient to
it and starting to overweight those likely to be more resilient.
One may also wonder why even after the occurrence of COVID-19 the market
still prices pandemic risk to some extent, being willing to accept lower expected
returns on more resilient stocks, as revealed by option prices according to our estimates. However, currently there is still high uncertainty regarding the duration of
the COVID-19 pandemic. Medical experts have repeatedly warned about the risk of
a second wave of contagion as the lockdown measures are gradually relaxed (see Xu
and Li, 2020, among others). Indeed, top health officials do not rule out that the
disease may become endemic. On 13 May 2020, Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director
of emergencies at the World Health Organization (WHO) stated:
“I think it’s important to put this on the table. This virus may become
just another endemic virus in our communities. And this virus may never
go away. HIV has not gone away, we’ve come to terms with the virus [...]
I think it is important that we’re realistic and I don’t think anyone can
predict when or if this disease will disappear.”
Such uncertainty, possibly coupled with heightened awareness that similar disasters may occur again in the future, could explain why, since COVID-19, pandemic
risk is priced in the cross-section of returns, as shown by our evidence based on
option prices. Hence, going forward, asset pricing models will have to include exposures to this additional risk factor among those used to explain the cross-section of
returns, and asset managers will have to take such exposures into account in portfolio
selection.
Our analysis is related to the asset pricing literature on rare disasters, starting
with Rietz (1988), who extends the Lucas (1978) model to include a rare disaster
state and shows that this leads to high equity risk premia and low risk-free returns,
even with reasonable time discounting and risk preferences. Barro (2006) and Barro
(2009) extend this model and show that empirically calibrated disaster probabilities
may suffice to explain the observed high equity premium, low risk-free rate and stock
return volatility. The theoretical literature on disaster risk has also been extended to
allow for learning (see, e.g.,Veronesi (2004), Wachter and Zhu (2019), Gillman et al.
(2014), Lu and Siemer (2016)), and/or for stochastic disaster risk (see, e.g., Wachter
(2013) and Gabaix (2012)).

–3–

One common feature of these models is that risk premia that would appear abnormally high conditioning on no disaster occurring, are in fact justified, being merely
an equilibrium compensation for the expected loss in a disaster plus a risk premium
as this loss occurs when the marginal utility of consumption is high. In particular,
the model by Gabaix (2012) implies that, in the cross-section of stocks, those that
are expected to be less resilient to disasters, should carry a higher risk premium, conditioning on no disaster occurring, but also unconditionally. Our empirical analysis
speaks to these predictions.
Our work is also related to a fast growing literature on the stock market response
to the COVID-19 pandemic in the first quarter of 2020. The early comprehensive
study by Ramelli and Wagner (2020) documents that during the ‘outbreak’ period
(which they define as 20 January to 21 February 2020), U.S. firms with high exposure
to China and, more generally, to international trade, as well as firms with high
leverage and low cash holdings experienced the sharpest stock price declines. The
leverage- and cash holding effects also persist through the ‘fever’ period (from 24
February to 20 March 2020). Bretscher et al. (2020) provide evidence for supply
chain effects in the cross-section of stocks during COVID-19. Moreover, Albuquerque
et al. (2020) find that firms with high environmental and social (ES) ratings offered
comparably higher returns and lower return volatility in the first quarter of 2020.
Some studies relate the price response of different stocks to the pandemic to the
corresponding firms’ exposure to the disease. Ramelli and Wagner (2020) and Hassan
et al. (2020) analyze conference call data, which the latter use to construct text-based,
firm-level measures for exposures to epidemic diseases, and find that stock returns are
significantly and negatively related to disease exposures, with demand- and supplychain related concerns being primary drivers. Alfaro et al. (2020) analyse the effect
of unanticipated changes in infections during the SARS and the COVID-19 epidemics
on stock returns, and show that stock prices drop in response to high unexpected
infections. In the cross-section, exposure to pandemic risk turns out to be greater for
larger and more capital intensive firms, and, consistently with Ramelli and Wagner
(2020), more levered and less profitable ones.
Some of the results obtained for the response of U.S. stock returns to the pandemic
appear to extend to non-U.S. stock returns. Ding et al. (2020) show for a sample
of over 50 countries that firms with better financials, less supply chain exposures
and more corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities experienced milder stock
price reactions in the first quarter of 2020. Other studies focus on the response

–4–

of country-level stock market indices to COVID-19: Ru et al. (2020) find that stock
markets in countries with 2003 SARS experience reacted more quickly to the outbreak
than countries without prior experience, while Gerding et al. (2020) document that
market declines were more severe in countries with lower fiscal capacity, defined as
higher debt/GDP ratio. Finally, Croce et al. (2020) use Twitter news to study the
(real-time) COVID-19 caused contagion in global equity markets.
Our analysis differs from that in all these papers since it focuses on the asset
pricing implications of companies’ exposure to social distancing, which is the main
economic consequence of the epidemic, and studies such implications not only for
the period of the COVID-19 outbreak, but also prior and after its occurrence. This
enables us to investigate whether learning about pandemic risk occurred in advance
of the outbreak, and whether investors kept pricing it since the outbreak.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a framework to
interpret the relationship between disaster risk and the stock returns of firms featuring different disaster resilience. Section 3 provides a brief discussion of alternative
measures of firms’ disaster resilience. The data and results are presented in Section
4. Section 5 concludes.

Disaster Awareness and Risk Premia

In this section we sketch three distinct and mutually exclusive models of how financial
markets may respond to disaster risk and to its materialization. As we shall see, each
model has different predictions about the stock return differential of resilient vs. nonresilient firms prior, during and after the occurrence of a disaster, as shown in Table
1. Our empirical analysis in Section 4 will investigate which of the three sets of
predictions is most consistent with the data.

Unpriced disaster risk. We start with a model where disaster is completely unex-

–5–

pected. In the case of COVID-19, this amounts to assuming that before the first
quarter of 2020 financial market participants were unaware of the danger posed by
the virus and of its consequences in terms of social distancing. Going forward, a new
disaster is again regarded as a zero-probability event, or anyway as being price irrelevant (for instance, in the case of COVID-19, due to development of vaccines and/or
effective drugs). In this model, disaster risk would not be priced before COVID-19
nor after it. Such market expectations could result either from bounded rationality,
i.e. investors assigning a zero probability weight to a positive probability event, or
from a disaster truly having a negligible probability both before and after its occurrence. In the latter case, unpriced disaster risk would be consistent with rational
expectations.
If this is the correct model in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, one should
observe (i) no return pattern related to firm pandemic resilience prior to 2020; (ii)
a sharper price drop for less resilient firms than for more resilient ones at the time
of the outbreak, as investors take into account that the cash flows of the former will
be hurt more than those of the latter; (iii) no differential response of the expected
returns of the two classes of firms after the crisis, since COVID-19 does not lead to
any updating of the return-generating process, i.e. disaster risk remains unpriced.
As disaster is considered as a one-time event, its occurrence leaves the stochastic
discount factors of all stocks unchanged.
Priced disaster risk. The second model is one where disasters, however rare, are
rationally anticipated, so that more resilient firms are priced at a premium relative
to less resilient ones, i.e. offer a lower expected return in no-disaster periods, as
predicted by Barro (2006), Barro (2009) and Gabaix (2012). Such models predict
that, in equilibrium, securities more exposed to a disaster, i.e. those issued by less
resilient firms, pay a risk premium to compensate investors for this risk. Hence,
they predict that (i) prior to the disaster, stocks’ excess returns are related to firms’
disaster resilience; (ii) during the disaster, investors take into account that the cash
flows of less resilient firms drop by more than those of the more resilient ones, so that
their disaster-time stock performance is worse; (iii) after the disaster, the pre-disaster
excess return pattern re-emerges, i.e. disaster risk remains priced. In principle, this
hypothesis does not preclude that investors may update the probability of disasters
upon the occurrence of one: if they have increased this probability as a result of
COVID-19, the expected return differential between non-resilient and resilient firms
should become more pronounced after the pandemics than it was before it.

–6–

Prior learning about disaster risk. Finally, we consider a model where investors learn
about the probability of a disaster occurring or about its implications before its occurrence. In the case of COVID-19, as mentioned in the introduction, they may have
revised upwards the probability of a pandemic occurring or become more keenly aware
of its social distancing implications, for instance as a result of SARS, Ebola, and/or
the statements by Bill Gates, Barack Obama and other opinion leaders. By the same
token, investors may have become more aware of the characteristics that make firms
more resilient to pandemics. Any of these forms of learning implies a demand shift by
investors from less to more resilient stocks before the pandemic, leading the latter to
outperform the former, once their respective exposures to “traditional” risk factors
are controlled for. Once disaster strikes, one would again observe the stocks of more
resilient firms outperforming less resilient ones. But this pattern should reverse in the
post-disaster phase: as at that stage learning would be complete, the stocks of more
resilient firms will be priced at a premium relative to less resilient ones, i.e. should
offer a lower expected return. This scenario has parallels with learning about the “importance” of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) scores by investors. In a
rational expectations equilibrium without learning, portfolios with strict ESG rules
should underperform, but in the presence of gradual learning about the importance
of ESG ratings for investors, the stocks of firms with high ESG ratings appreciate,
and ESG mutual funds outperform (see Pastor et al., 2020).
Hence, this model predicts that (i) excess returns of resilient relative to nonresilient firms should be observed prior to the disaster; (ii) when disaster strikes,
investors take into account that the cash flows of less resilient firms drop by more
than those of more resilient ones; (iii) after the disaster, resilient firms offer lower
expected returns that non-resilient ones, as learning about disaster risk has taken
place.

Measuring Firm Resilience to Pandemics

This section describes social distancing measures that may be relevant for the pricing
of stocks, as firms with operations requiring less direct physical interaction and more
easily performed from home should be more resilient to social distancing rules than
other firms. To gauge the effect of social distancing on firms, recent research in labor
economics has developed measures of the extent to which jobs can be done from home
and rely on human interaction in physical proximity. Some studies have developed

–7–

such measures starting from worker-level survey responses, while others have done so
by characterizing the tasks required by each occupation based on the Occupational
Information Network (O*Net) and on the authors’ own judgement.
Hensvik et al. (2020, HLR) use the first approach: they rely on the ‘American
Time Use Survey’ (2011-2018) to estimate the prevalence of working at ‘home’ and at
the ‘workplace’ and, starting from worker-level survey responses, estimate the fraction
of employees that work at home and at the workplace, as well as the hours worked at
home and at the workplace at the industry-level.1 Instead, both Dingel and Neiman
(2020, DN) and Koren and Pető (2020, KP) use data from O*Net surveys. DN
use this data, and their own judgement, to assess the teleworkability of occupations
and provide industry-level estimates for the percentage of jobs that can be done at
home as well as for the percentage of wages associated with teleworkable occupations.
KP construct three types of industry-level measures of face-to-face interactions, depending on whether these are due to internal communication (‘teamwork’), external
communication (‘customers’), or physical proximity to others (‘presence’). They also
aggregate ‘teamwork’ and ‘customers’ to a measure of ‘communication’ intensity and
construct an industry-level measure of the percentage of employees ‘affected’ by social distancing regulations due to their occupations being communication-intensive
and/or requiring close physical proximity to others.2
In our estimates, we rely primarily on the measures proposed by KP, but also check
whether our results are robust to the use of those produced by HLR and DN. The
results presented in the next section focus mostly on KP’s ‘affected share’ variable.
We choose this as our main variable because, beside teleworkability, it also explicitly
accounts for physical proximity to others, i.e. exactly what social distancing rules aim
to avoid. Additionally, we consider DN’s measure of the fraction of wages accounted
for by jobs that can be performed at home (‘teleworkable manual wage’) and HLR’s
measure of daily work hours at the workplace (‘dur workplace’). However, we also
discuss results obtained using all other variables suggested by KP, DN, and HLR.
Table A.1 in the Appendix lists all the measures and presents their definitions.
1

As the authors mention, their measures for working at home should provide a lower bound for
the current situation, as the COVID-19 crisis is likely to have prompted additional substitution of
work at the workplace with work at home.
2

The estimates of these studies are available for NAICS industry classifications, at the 2- and
3-digit level for DN, at the 4-digit level for HLR, and at the 3-digit-level for KP. For details on the
data, see Table A.1 in the Appendix.

Empirical Results

We use the NAICS industry classification of stocks to assign the DN, HLR, and KP
metrics to firms, and code each firm as a ‘High’ or ‘Low’ resilience one, depending on how its industry scores relative to the median value of the relevant metric.
Then, we analyze whether and how the resulting variation in U.S. firms’ pandemic
resilience affects the cross-section of their stock returns at the time of the COVID-19
shock (Subsection 4.2), before the shock (Subsection 4.3) and after its occurrence
(Subsection 4.4).

4.1

Data and Methodology

We obtain prices for all common stocks listed at the NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ
from the Compustat Capital IQ North America Daily database and compute daily
returns, accounting for price-adjustments and dividends. We also retrieve data on
daily risk-free, market and standard factor returns from Kenneth Frenchs website.
Our estimates in Subsection 4.2 require daily data from January 2019 to March
2020: after estimating firms’ exposures to common factors from 2019 data, we use
these exposures to compute factor model-adjusted stock returns in the first quarter
of 2020.3
For the regressions of daily stock returns on factor returns, we require a minimum
of 127 daily observations, and estimate the following specifications: we alternatively
regress stock returns on market excess returns (CAPM), on the returns of the three
Fama and French (1993) factors (FF3, i.e. market, size, and value) and the five Fama
and French (2015) factors (FF5, i.e. market, size, value, investment, and profitability). In addition, we augment the FF3 and FF5 specifications by the momentum
factor (Carhart, 1997) so as to obtain FF4 and FF6 exposures. The 2019 exposures
are then used to measure factor model-adjusted stock returns in the first quarter
of 2020 as the difference between a stock’s daily excess return and its CAPM beta
multiplied by the daily market excess return; we proceed analogously for the FF
specifications.
Next, stock return data are matched with the resilience proxies based on KP, DN,
and HLR metrics by industry, based on firms’ 2-, 3-, or 4-digit NAICS codes. Only
industries for which resilience measures are available are retained in the data set.
3

This approach follows Ramelli and Wagner (2020) and other related papers.

–9–

Moreover, firms with equity market capitalization below USD 10 million are dropped
from the sample. For the first quarter of 2020, this results in a sample with a total
of 227,812 observations for 3,614 firms in 75 industries at the NAICS 3-digit level for
KP and DN, and 222 industries at the NAICS 4-digit level for HLR.
For the analysis in Subsection 4.4, we additionally obtain S&P 500 index option
and individual stock options data from OptionMetrics for the first quarter of 2020.
We use the volatility surface data to compute SVIX-measures of the risk-neutral variance, keeping data for firms for which we can compute SVIX-measures for horizons
of 30, 91, 182, 365, and 730 days, and match this with the stock data. This results
in a sample of 160,951 observations for 2,721 firms in 74 industries at the NAICS
3-digit level for KP and DN and 212 industries at the NAICS 4-digit level for HLR.

4.2

Returns and Firm Resilience during the Disaster

We study stock returns in the first quarter of 2020, and specifically from February 24,
the day after Italy introduced its lockdown, to March 20, the last trading day before
the Fed announced aggressive action intended to soften the blow of the pandemic.4
As shown by Panel A of Figure 1, in this time window there was a surge in the
public’s attention to the COVID-19 epidemic (as measured by Google trends), while
the prices of U.S. stocks (as measured by the Fama-French market factor) fell sharply.
A first look at the data suggests that the stocks of more pandemic-resilient firms,
i.e. those included in the ‘High’ resilience portfolio (based on the ‘affected share’
metric by KP) performed better in this time window than those in the ‘Low’ resilience
portfolio. Panel B in Figure 1, which plots cumulative excess returns for the valueweighted portfolios of firms with high and low resilience, shows that both portfolios
dropped sharply in price, but that of high-resilience firms depreciated far less: from
February 24 to March 20, their shares outperformed those of the other group by
approximately 10%.
[Insert Figure 1]
4

This period corresponds to the ‘fever’-period in Ramelli and Wagner (2020); see their paper for
a detailed account of the sequence of events. On Monday March 23, the Fed unveiled its plan to buy
an unlimited amount of bonds with government guarantees, including some commercial mortgage
debt. It also established the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility (SMCCF), in order to
purchase existing investment-grade corporate debt, including exchange-traded funds, as well as the
Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility (PMCCF), to purchase newly issued corporate bonds,
so as to prevent companies facing pandemic fallout from dismissing employees and terminating
business relationships.

Since the different performances of the two portfolios shown in Figure 1 may stem
from their different exposure to standard risk factors, we estimate CAPM- and FFexposures from daily data in 2019. We then use these exposures to compute daily
CAPM-adjusted and FF-adjusted returns, i.e., excess returns net of such exposures
multiplied by the respective factor returns (see Subsection 4.1 for details). Figure 2
presents the results: controlling for market factor risk (CAPM-adjusted returns in
Panel A), the cumulative return of the High- and Low-resilience portfolio are about
+10% and −15%, respectively, from February 24 to March 20, i.e. the cumulative
CAPM-adjusted High-minus-Low return is approximately 25%. Panels B and C
show that accounting for the FF-factors does not change the results qualitatively:
the resulting risk-adjusted return differentials are in the range between 15% and
20%. The plots suggest that the differential return between the two portfolios has
been negligible from early January until late February, and that the results in the
COVID-19 time window are mostly driven by the sharp decline of the Low-resilience
portfolio. Once the Fed announced its intervention (on March 23) the High-resilience
portfolio recovered slightly and, as a result, the Low-minus-High differential dropped.
Interestingly, the time-series of the cumulative Low-minus-High returns resembles
that of the Google trends index. Indeed, regressing daily returns on changes in the
Google index confirms a statistically significant relation, with R2 between 0.19 and
0.22, depending on which factor-model adjustment is used.
[Insert Figure 2]
Figures A.1 and A.2 in the Appendix provide evidence on the robustness of the
results shown in Figure 2 with respect to other resilience measures. They plot the
risk-adjusted returns and the differentials of the High- and Low-resilience portfolios
based on DN’s ‘teleworkable manual wage’ and HLR’s ‘dur workplace’. The results
are qualitatively similar to those in Figure 2.
To analyze the statistical significance of these findings, Table 2 reports the averages of daily excess returns (in Column 1) and risk-adjusted returns (in Columns 2
to 6) for High-resilience and Low-resilience stocks from February 24 to March 20, as
well as the difference between the two, using the resilience measures based on KP, DN
and HLR. Panel A shows that the differential return based on SKP’s ‘affected share’
metric is statistically significant, whether it is based on raw excess returns or adjusted for market exposure (CAPM), for the classic Fama-French factors (FF3 and
FF5) or for those that also control for momentum (FF4 and FF6). For resilience

– 11 –

measures based on DN (Panel B) and HLR (Panel C), the average CAPM-adjusted
differential returns are statistically significant as well, but there is some variation in
the significance of the FF-adjusted returns. A common feature across all resilience
measures is that Low-resilience stocks generate (at least marginally) significant negative excess returns in all return specifications. For KP, we additionally find that all
risk-adjusted returns of the High-resilience portfolio are significantly positive in all
specifications.
[Insert Table 2]
Tables A.2 to A.4 in the Appendix present results for the other metrics proposed
by KP, DN, and HLR, respectively. For KP (Table A.2), most return differentials are
significantly different from zero when controlling for CAPM- and FF-exposures. For
‘presence share’, the measure that aims to capture the necessity of working in close
proximity to others, the results are even stronger than those based on ‘affected share’.
For DN and HLR, relying on the other proxies generally reduces the significance of
the results, but CAPM-adjusted return differentials remain statistically significant
(see Tables A.3 and A.4, respectively).
To better understand the source of the High-minus-Low differential returns, we
study the cumulative risk-adjusted returns in the cross-section of (value-weighted)
industry portfolios and present results for the 25 industries with the highest number
of firms, in total 2,974 firms. Table 3 presents summary statistics.
[Insert Table 3]
Figure 3 plots the cumulative risk-adjusted returns of value-weighted industry
portfolios, ranked by their resilience to pandemics, based on KP’s ‘affected share’
variable. The figure shows that less resilient industries feature substantially lower
cumulative risk-adjusted returns during the COVID-19 crisis: the stocks of the least
resilient industries (such as those in NAICS-industry 212: Mining, except oil and
gas; 483: Water transportation) generated returns 40% to 50% lower than the most
resilient ones (224: Computer and electronic products; 511: Publishing industries,
except Internet), depending on the risk adjustment. The cross-sectional relationship
between pandemic resilience and cumulative returns is not only highly statistically
significant in all three panels of the figure, but also economically significant: for
instance, a decrease of 10 percentage points in the resilience metric is associated with

– 12 –

Returns and Firm Resilience before the Disaster

The evidence in the previous section indicates that when the public became aware of
the COVID-19 outbreak, stock returns reacted differently depending on companies’
resilience to the social distancing rules triggered by the pandemic. However, in principle investors may have been aware of pandemic risk even before the COVID-19 shock,
so that this risk may have to some extent been priced by the stock market in advance.
As explained in Section 2, if investors were fully aware of such risk in advance, they
should have required lower expected returns on the stocks of pandemic-resilient companies than on those of non-resilient ones, controlling for their respective exposures
to other risks. If instead investors had become gradually aware of such risk, one
should observe the opposite pattern, namely, the stocks of pandemic-resilient companies outperforming non-resilient ones. Finally, if investors were completely unaware
of such risk, one should not detect any difference in the stock market performance of
the two types of companies, prior to the pandemic.
Figure 4 provides evidence on this point, by displaying the time series pattern
of risk-adjusted cumulative returns for High- and Low-resilience stocks for six years
before the COVID-19 crisis, as well as for a High-minus-Low-resilience portfolio.5
Irrespective of the risk adjustment considered (CAPM, FF3 or FF5), the figure shows
that High-resilience stocks vastly outperformed Low-resilience ones, with most of the
differential return stemming from the outperformance of the former rather than the
underperformance of the latter. Moreover, about half of the cumulative risk-adjusted
return differential between the two portfolios over the whole interval from 2014 to
early 2020 materialized before the COVID-19 crisis, the spike occurring during the
crisis accounting for the other half.
[Insert Figure 4]

The empirical approach is the same as before, i.e. we estimate exposure from daily excess
returns over a calendar year and use these exposures to compute risk-adjusted returns in the next
year.

– 13 –

Hence, this evidence appears consistent with the third hypothesis outlined in
Section 2, namely, that investors have become gradually aware of disaster risk before
the current pandemics, and therefore have sought to acquire the stocks of pandemicresilient stocks at increasingly high prices, to insulate their portfolios against this
previously unknown type of risk.

4.4

Option-Implied Expected Returns after the Disaster

To study how the market prices resilience to disaster risk going forward, we rely
on equity options data. Options prices are observable in real time and inherently
forward-looking. These features are especially useful in the current crisis, in which
– due to its unprecedented nature – relying on historical data appears particularly
questionable.
Recent research shows how prices of index options and stock options can be used
to compute measures of expected market returns and expected stock returns. In
our analysis, we follow the approaches suggested by Martin (2017) and Martin and
Wagner (2019). Martin (2017) argues that the risk-neutral variance of the market
provides a lower bound on the equity premium. He also argues that, empirically, the
lower bound is approximately tight, so that the risk-neutral variance of the market
directly measures the equity premium. Martin and Wagner (2019) derive a formula
for the expected return on a stock in terms of the risk-neutral variance of the market
and the stock’s excess risk-neutral variance relative to that of the average stock.
The three measures of risk-neutral variance – for the market, a particular stock
and the average stock – can be computed from option prices using the approach
of Breeden and Litzenberger (1978). The market risk-neutral variance, SVIX2t , is
determined by the prices of index options:
SVIX2t

=

Rf,t+1 Sm,t

"Z

Fm,t

Z

∞

putm,t (K) dK +

#
callm,t (K) dK ,

Fm,t

where Rf,t+1 is the gross riskfree rate, Sm,t and Fm,t denote the spot and forward
(to time t + 1) prices of the market, and putm,t (K) and callm,t (K) denote the time t
prices of European puts and calls on the market that expire at time t + 1 with strike
K. The length of the time interval from t to t + 1 corresponds to the maturity of the
options used in the computation.
The risk-neutral variance at the individual stock level, SVIX2i,t , is defined in terms

– 14 –

of individual stock option prices:
SVIX2i,t =

Rf,t+1 Si,t

"Z

Fi,t

#

∞

calli,t (K) dK ,

puti,t (K) dK +

where the subscripts i indicate the underlying stock i.
Finally, using SVIX2i,t for all firms available at time t, we calculate the risk-neutral
P
2
average stock variance index as SVIXt = i wi,t SVIX2i,t .
Using these three risk-neutral variances, one can compute the expected return on
a stock using the formula derived by Martin and Wagner (2019):

1
Et Ri,t+1 − Rf,t+1
2
= SVIX2t + SVIX2i,t −SVIXt .
Rf,t+1
2
where Ri,t+1 denotes the one period gross return on stock i. Hence, in the crosssection, differences in expected returns reflect variation in SVIX2i,t .
In our analysis of expected returns, we use the measures proposed by KP, DN,
and HLR to construct risk-neutral variance indices for firms with high resilience to
2
2
disaster risk, SVIXH , and for firms with low resilience SVIXL . For every day in our
sample, we compute these indices for each resilience measure as the value-weighted
sum of the underlying firms’ SVIX2i,t , for maturities ranging from 30 to 730 days. We
present results for all stocks for which options are available in OptionMetrics, but
to face possible concerns about limited trading in options on small stocks we also
present results for the subset of S&P 500 firms in the Appendix.
2

2

Figure 5 plots the time series of SVIXL and SVIXH , measuring resilience on the
basis of KP’s ‘affected share’ measure, as well as their difference for maturities of 30,
91, 365 and 730 days. The results show that, until early March, the options-implied
variance of High-resilience stocks slightly exceeded that for Low-resilience stocks. At
the time of the Italian lockdown (February 24), the approximate 2% (p.a.) difference
2
2
SVIXL − SVIXH implies that High-resilience firms had higher expected returns than
Low-resilience ones. During the Covid-19 crisis, the sign of this premium reverses and
its magnitude surges to more than 30% (p.a.) at the peak, as implied by one-month
options decreasing with longer maturities to approximately 8% (p.a.) for a forecast
horizon of two years. Until the end of March these premia gradually declined to half
(interestingly, starting shortly before the reversal in stock prices) and imply, as of
March 31, that the stocks of Low-resilience firms are expected to carry a premium of

– 15 –

about 5.5% (p.a.) over the next year and about 4% (p.a.) over the next two years.
The results are qualitatively very similar when only large firms (i.e., constituents of
the S&P 500) are retained in the sample, although these firms feature lower SVIXlevels, as shown in Figure A.4 of the Appendix.
[Insert Figure 5]
To illustrate these results with reference to some well-known stocks, Figure 6
presents the expected returns of a selected group of S&P firms, respectively featuring
high and low resilience to the pandemic, plotting all of them on the same scale, for all
stocks and maturities. As examples of very high-resilience firms, the figure plots the
option-implied expected returns of Apple, Google, and Microsoft. At the opposite
end of the resilience range, as examples of very low-resilience stocks, the figure plots
the expected returns of Marriott, United Airlines and Royal Caribbean: travel and
tourism have been among the industries hardest hit by the stay-at-home orders and
social distancing rules.
[Insert Figure 6]
Two results emerge strikingly from Figure 6. First, at the outbreak of the COVID19 crisis, all the option-implied expected returns rose, but those of low-resilience
stocks (right-side charts) increased by an order of magnitude more than those of lowresilience ones (left-side charts). At the peak of the crisis, the expected return implied
by short-term options became an enormous 300% (p.a.) for United Airlines and Royal
Caribbean, reflecting unprecedented uncertainty about the immediate future of their
businesses. Second, this increase is much more persistent for low-resilience stocks:
at the end of our sample, on March 31, their expected returns are still elevated,
while for high-resilience stocks they revert back to pre-COVID-19 levels, especially
for the two-year horizon. Third, for all stocks expected returns decrease in levels as
maturities increase, indicating that there is a term structure to pandemic risk: it
is perceived to decrease substantially as the horizon lengthens, though it far from
vanishes for low-resilience stocks.
Figure 7 provides a clearer view of the time-series patterns of the expected returns
of the six stocks, as it adapts the vertical scale of the plot to their range of variation.
The figure allows in particular to appreciate that, even at the end of our sample,
almost two months after the outbreak, investors still require much higher expected

– 16 –

returns from Marriott, United Airlines and Royal Caribbean than from Apple, Google
and Microsoft, and that even at the two-year horizon the expected return is a multiple
of what it was at the beginning of the year before the COVID-19 crisis. The most
extreme case is Royal Caribbean, whose two-year options imply, as of March 31, an
expected return of 60% (p.a.) for a two-year horizon.
[Insert Figure 7]
Taken together, these results indicate that disaster resilience is priced in equity
options and that the COVID-19 crisis has greatly affected how financial markets
price resilience to disaster risk: While the two-year expected returns have reverted
to their pre-crisis levels for the firms least affected by social distancing requirements,
the expected returns for the firms most severely affected by the pandemic are much
higher than before the crisis. Hence, it appears that, going forward, markets consider
disaster risk, and specifically the resilience against a pandemic, to be much more
important than they did before COVID-19.

Conclusions

The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, it investigates whether the COVID19 outbreak triggered a different stock return response depending on companies’
resilience to social distancing, which is the most severe constraint that the pandemic
has imposed on firms’ operations. On this score, we find that more resilient companies
greatly outperformed less resilient ones, even after controlling for all conventional
measures of risk premia.
Second, the paper explores whether similar cross-sectional return differentials
already emerged before the COVID-19 outbreak. Indeed this is the case: in the
2014-19 interval, the cumulative return differential between more and less pandemicresilient firms is of about the same magnitude as during the outbreak, i.e. between
late February and early April 2020. We interpret this as evidence of learning by
investors, i.e., of their growing awareness of the potential threat posed by pandemics
well in advance of its materialization.
Finally, we exploit option price data to infer whether, after the COVID-19 outbreak, investors price pandemic risk over different horizons, and find that they do:
even on a 2-year horizon, stocks of more pandemic-resilient firms are expected to

– 17 –

yield significantly lower returns than less resilient ones, reflecting lower exposure to
disaster risk. Such differences are massive in the case of some stocks: for example, as
late as early April 2020, the expected return on low-resilience stocks such as Royal
Caribbean and United Airlines is around 60% and 40% respectively, while those of
high-resilience stocks such as Apple and Microsoft are between 3% and 4%.
Hence, going forward, markets appear to price exposure to a new risk factor,
namely, pandemic risk. In future development of this work, we plan to investigate
whether such risk is part of a wider sustainability risk factor, or at least whether the
two types of risk are correlated. We also plan to investigate whether resilience to
social distancing has not only direct effects on stock prices, but also indirect effects
via demand and supply linkages, i.e. whether for instance the stocks of firms that
depend heavily on low-resilience firms are themselves more exposed to pandemic risk,
other things equal.

Figure 5. Stock options-implied risk-neutral variances
This figure plots stock options-implied risk-neutral variance indices for firms with high and low resilience to social dis2
tancing during the first quarter of 2020. On any given day, we assign a firm to the high resilience index, SVIXH,t , if its
2

‘affected share’ (as defined by Koren and Pető, 2020) is below the median value and to the low resilience index, SVIXL,t ,
if it is above. The indices are computed as the value-weighted sums of individual firms’ risk-neutral variances, SVIX2i,t .

The difference SVIXL,t − SVIXL,t measures the expected return of low resilience in excess of high resilience stocks. Panels
A to D present results using options maturities of 30, 91, 365 and 730 days, respectively. The dashed vertical lines mark
February 24 and March 20.

Table 2: Excess and risk-adjusted returns of high and low resilience stocks
This table reports averages of daily returns for value-weighted portfolios of low and high resilience stocks from February 24
to March 20, 2020, i.e. from the day after Italy introduced its lockdown to the last trading day before the Fed announced
its intervention. On any given day, we assign a firm to the ‘High’ (‘Low’) portfolio, in Panel A, if its ‘affected share’ (as
defined by Koren and Pető, 2020) is below (above) the median value; in Panel B, if its ‘teleworkable manual wage’ (as
defined by Dingel and Neiman, 2020) is above (below) the median value; in Panel C, if its ‘dur workplace’ (as defined by
Hensvik et al., 2020) is below (above) the median value. and to the ‘Low’ portfolio if it is above. In addition to rae excess
returns (ret), we report CAPM-adjusted returns, i.e. controlling for exposure to market risk, returns adjusted for the
Fama-French three factor model exposures (ff3, i.e. market, size, value) and five factor model exposures (ff5, i.e. market,
size, value, investments, profitability), and the Fama-French models augmented by the momentum factor (ff4 and ff6).
Values in square brackets are t-statistics based on standard errors following Newey and West (1987), where we choose the
optimal truncation lag as suggested by Andrews (1991). ∗ , ∗∗ and ∗∗∗ denote statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and

Table 3: Summary statistics for industry portfolios
This table presents summary statistics for the returns of value-weighted industry portfolios from February 24 to March
20, 2020, i.e. from the day after Italy introduced its lockdown to the last trading day before the Fed announced its
intervention. We define resilience as 100 (%) minus the ‘affected share’ defined by Koren and Pető (2020) and present
results for the 25 industries with the highest number of firms (in total 2,974). We report the industries’ 3-digit NAICS code,
their description, the number of firms in the respective industries and their cumulative return. Specifically, we present
CAPM-adjusted returns, i.e. controlling for exposure to market risk as well as results controlling for the Fama-French
three factor model exposures (ff3, i.e. market, size, value) and five factor model exposures (ff5, i.e. market, size, value,

This figure plots the cumulative risk-adjusted returns of portfolios sorted by firms’ resilience to disaster risk during the
first quarter of 2020. On any given day, we assign a firm to the ‘High’ portfolio if its ‘teleworkable manual wage’ (as
defined by Dingel and Neiman, 2020) is above the median value and to the ‘Low’ portfolio if it is below. In Panel A, we
present CAPM-adjusted returns, i.e. controlling for exposure to market risk. Panels B and C present results controlling
for the Fama-French three factor model exposures (i.e. market, size, value) and five factor model exposures (i.e. market,
size, value, investments, profitability), respectively. We plot the cumulative value-weighted portfolio returns for the ‘High’
portfolio (in green) and the Low portfolio (in red) as well as the High-Low differential return (in blue). The dashed vertical

Figure A.4. Stock options-implied risk-neutral variances of S&P 500 firms
This figure plots stock options-implied risk-neutral variance indices for S&P 500 firms with high and low resilience to social
2
distancing during the first quarter of 2020. On any given day, we assign a firm to the high resilience index, SVIXH,t , if its
2

‘affected share’ (as defined by Koren and Pető, 2020) is below the median value and to the low resilience index, SVIXL,t ,
if it is above. The indices are computed as the value-weighted sums of individual firms’ risk-neutral variances, SVIX2i,t .
2

2

The difference SVIXL,t − SVIXL,t measures the expected return of low resilience in excess of high resilience stocks. Panels
A to D present results using options maturities of 30, 91, 365 and 730 days, respectively. The dashed vertical lines mark
February 24 and March 20.

Table A.1: Measures of teleworkability, working at home and at the workplace, and business
face-to-face interactions
This Table provides an overview of the empirical measures on which we base our analysis of stocks’ disaster resilience.
Panel A lists the teleworkability measures provided by Dingel and Neiman (2020) for 24 industries at the NAICS 2-digit
level and for 88 industries at the NAICS 3-digit level. Panel B lists the work at home and work at the workplace measures
provided by Hensvik et al. (2020) for 310 industries at the NAICS 4-digit level. Panel C lists the communication-intensity
and physical proximity measures suggested by Koren and Pető (2020) for 84 industries at the NAICS 3-digit level.

Panel A. Dingel and Neiman (2020):
‘teleworkable emp’
‘teleworkable wage’
‘teleworkable manual emp’
‘teleworkable manual wage’

fraction of jobs that can be done from home estimated from
O*Net data
fraction of wages to jobs that can be done from home estimated
from O*Net data
fraction of jobs that can be done from home based on manual
classification by the authors
fraction of wages to jobs that can be done from home based on
manual classification by the authors
Panel B. Hensvik et al. (2020)

‘home’
‘workplace’

fraction of respondents that work at home
fraction of respondents that work at workplace

‘dur home’
‘dur workplace’

hours worked at home per day
hours worked at workplace per day

‘share home’

hours worked at home divided by hours worked at home and at
workplace
Panel C. Koren and Pető (2020)

‘teamwork share’
‘customer share’
‘communication share’

percentage of workers in teamwork-intensive occupations, i.e.
internal communication
percentage of workers in customer-facing occupations, i.e.
external communication
percentage of workers in teamwork-intensive and/or
customer-facing occupations

‘presence share’

percentage of workers whose jobs require physical presence in
close proximity to others

‘affected share’

percentage of workers in occupations that are
communication-intensive and/or require physical presence in
close proximity to others

Table A.2: Other measures of Koren and Pető (2020)
This table presents results analogous to Panel A in Table 2 but using the other measures constructed by Koren and Pető
(2020) instead of their ‘affected share’ variable.
