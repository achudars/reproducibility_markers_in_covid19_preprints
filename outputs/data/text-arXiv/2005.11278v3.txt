Abstract: We assess the impact of COVID-19 response measures implemented in Germany and Switzerland on cumulative COVID-19-related hospitalization and death rates. Our analysis exploits the fact that
the epidemic was more advanced in some regions than in others when certain lockdown measures came
into force, based on measuring health outcomes relative to the region-specific start of the epidemic and
comparing outcomes across regions with earlier and later start dates. When estimating the effect of
the relative timing of measures, we control for regional characteristics and initial epidemic trends by
linear regression (Germany and Switzerland), doubly robust estimation (Germany), or synthetic controls
(Switzerland). We find for both countries that a relatively later exposure to the measures entails higher
cumulative hospitalization and death rates on region-specific days after the outbreak of the epidemic,
suggesting that an earlier imposition of measures is more effective than a later one. For Germany, we also
evaluate curfews (as introduced in a subset of states) based on cross-regional variation. We do not find
any effects of curfews on top of the federally imposed contact restriction that banned groups of more than
2 individuals. Finally, an analysis of mobility patterns in Switzerland shows an immediate behavioral
effect of the lockdown in terms of reduced mobility.

Introduction

This paper assesses how the COVID-19 response measures implemented in Switzerland and Germany affect the development of cumulative COVID-19-related hospitalization and death rates.
In both countries, the federal governments implemented extensive lockdown measures, including
the closure of non-essential shops, schools, childcare centers, cafes, bars and restaurants. In
Germany, these measures were further enhanced with a ban on gatherings with more than two
people decided at federal level and curfews implemented in several states. With the measures in
place for some weeks, both countries report a flattening of the COVID-19 epidemic curve. This
alone, however, does not necessarily exclusively reflect the impact of the measures, but likely
also general time trends in the spread of the virus. For this reason, this study aims to provide
evidence about the causal effects of the German and Swiss measures by exploiting variation (i)
in their relative timing due the fact that the epidemic was more advanced in some regions than
in others when certain measures came into force and (ii) across regions due to the fact that some
measures were only introduced in a subset of regions.
A range of studies on the impact of COVID-19 response measures focus on predicting the
development of the pandemic in terms of infections, hospitalizations, or death rates based on
simulating the spread of the virus and calibrating the model as a function of the measures. For
instance, Koo et al. (2020) provide a simulation study on the COVID-19 outbreak in Singapore
and model the development of COVID-19 infections under four potential intervention scenarios.
Likewise, Bicher et al. (2020) developed an agent-based simulation model to predict the development of infections under different scenarios of lockdown timing and exit strategies out of the
lockdown in Austria, finding that delaying the lockdown by 1 week would have translated into an
increase of infections by 4 times. Donsimoni et al. (2020) simulate the effect of lockdown timing
and duration on the rate of COVID-19 infections and the expected end date of the epidemic in
Germany. The study suggests that a complete lift of measures on April 20th would have borne
the risk of increasing infection rates. The authors further advise to adopt exit strategies and
policies that differ across regions in order to learn about which measures are most effective for
containing the epidemic while reducing social and economic costs.
In contrast to such simulations, in which empirical data serve for calibrating parameters in
prediction models, a growing literature applies policy evaluation methods as outlined in Imbens

1

& Wooldridge (2009) to assess the effectiveness of lockdown measures based on variation across
regions and over time. Qiu et al. (2020) for instance investigate the influence of socioeconomic
factors and COVID-19 response measures on transmission dynamics in China, finding that measures at a local level have a larger impact on the epidemic curve than restricting population flows
between cities. Juranek & Zoutman (2020) use an event study approach to assess the effect of
the lockdown measures of Denmark and Norway on hospitalizations based on a comparison with
Sweden whose measures are comparably lenient. Results suggest that the peak number of hospitalizations would have more than doubled in Denmark and Norway had they followed Sweden’s
strategy.
Dave, Friedson, Matsuzawa, & Sabia (2020) use a difference-in-differences approach to evaluate lockdown measures (namely shelter in place orders) in the US by exploiting variation in
responses across states and over time. As a consequence of the measures, they find an important
increase (of 5 -10%) in the rate at which state residents remained in their homes full-time as well
as substantial reductions in cumulative COVID-19 cases (44% after three weeks),1 with early
adopting states with a high population density benefitting most. See also Fowler et al. (2020) for
a related difference-in-differences strategy for the US that suggests reductions in infections, too,
as well as in fatalities. Results in Friedson et al. (2020), who use a synthetic control approach
to analyse the measures’ effectiveness in California, and Dave, Friedson, Matsuzawa, Sabia, &
Safford (2020), who evaluate the impact of the measures implemented in Texas in an event study
framework, point in the same direction. Weber (2020) exploits regional differences in the timing of measures in Germany finding that school closures, prohibition of mass events, as well as
gathering bans and curfews played a major role in reducing the number of confirmed infections,
while border closures and shut-downs of the service and retail sector did not show a significant
effect. Studies on the impact of face mask requirements in public transport, retailers and public
businesses find evidence for a reduction in the spread of the virus through such requirements,
see e.g. Mitze et al. (2020) for a synthetic control study on German data and Chernozhukov
et al. (2020), who assess the impact of such requirements in the US within a causal framework
that allows for both, direct effects of COVID-19 response measures and indirect effects through
behavioral changes.
Askitas et al. (2020) apply an event study design to assess a range of different response
1

The estimated effect on fatalities is also negative but less precise.

measures across 135 countries and find that cancelling public events and restricting gatherings
reduce new infections more effectively than mobility restrictions like international travel controls.
This is in line with Bonardi et al. (2020) who consider first difference and AR(1) models based
on 184 countries and conclude that lockdown measures generally reduce confirmed infections
and fatalities (and even more so if imposed rather earlier than later), while border closures do
not show important effects. Findings in Banholzer et al. (2020), a study on 20 Western countries
in a Bayesian framework, suggest that venue closures and gathering bans are most effective in
reducing infections but also attest a significant effect of border closures.
Our paper contributes to this growing literature by analysing COVID-19-related hospitalizations and death rates across administrative units over time, namely across counties in the case
of Germany and across cantons in the case of Switzerland. We estimate the effect of the relative
timing of lockdown measures based on measuring health outcomes relative to the region-specific
start of the epidemic and comparing outcomes across regions with earlier and later start dates.
The start date is defined as the day on which the confirmed regional infections per 10,000 inhabitants exceed 1 for the first time. In the analysis, we control for regional characteristics
(population size and density, age structure, and GDP per capita), initial trends of the epidemic
(median age of confirmed infections and initial growth rate of confirmed infections), and other
policies selectively introduced prior to the major lockdowns (e.g. a ban on visits to hospitals and
retirement homes in some regions).
Linear regression estimates suggest that for both Switzerland (which also includes the Principality of Liechtenstein as data point) and Germany, a relatively later exposure to the measures
entails higher cumulative hospitalization and death rates on sufficiently advanced region-specific
days after the outbreak of the epidemic. This suggests that an earlier imposition of measures
is more effective than a later one w.r.t. our health outcomes, which is in line with findings in
Amuedo-Dorantes et al. (2020) on the effect of lockdown timing on COVID-19-related deaths in
Spain. For Germany with its substantially larger number of observations, we also estimate the
effect of the relative timing based on doubly robust (DR) estimation, see Robins et al. (1994)
and Robins & Rotnitzky (1995), which is a more flexible approach than exclusively relying on
a linear outcome model. For Switzerland, we also consider the synthetic control method, see
Abadie & Gardeazabal (2003) and Abadie et al. (2010), to assess for two selected cantons with
a relatively late exposure what their counterfactual outcomes would have been under an earlier
3

exposure. Both the DR and synthetic control methods corroborate the findings of the linear
regression. For Germany only, we also evaluate the effect of curfews that were introduced by a
subset of German states in addition to the federal lockdown measures and bans of gatherings
with more than two individuals. Exploiting this cross-sectional variation while controlling for
observed characteristics, neither linear regression nor DR estimation suggest that curfews further
reduce hospitalizations and fatalities under the lockdown measures already in place, which is in
line with the findings in Bonardi et al. (2020) and Banholzer et al. (2020). Finally, we investigate
how mobility patterns in Switzerland changed after the lockdown measures by means of a t-test
that is applied to canton-specific mobility statistics and find an immediate behavioral change
in terms of reduced mobility. This is particularly interesting in light of the results in Deb et
al. (2020), a cross-country study on Apple mobility trends, which suggest that social distancing
measures have been more effective in countries where they resulted in larger mobility reductions.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the
timeline of COVID-19 measures in Switzerland and Germany. Sections 3 and 4 describe the data
and econometric methods used in the analyses. Section 5 presents and interprets the results.
Section 6 concludes.

Timeline of COVID-19 Response Measures

Both Germany and Switzerland are federal states with competencies in epidemic control partly
belonging to the 26 cantons in Switzerland and the 16 federal states (Länder) in Germany. The
German states themselves are comprised of all in all 401 counties (Kreise) which also have certain
competencies in handling epidemic outbreaks. With competencies fragmented across the federal
governments and sub-federal authorities, not all measures were implemented in all regions and,
if so, not always at the same time. However, decisions on key COVID-19 response measures
were made at the federal level in both countries.
In Switzerland, the first COVID-19 response measure, a ban of events with more than 1000
visitors, was announced and implemented at the federal level on February 28th when there
were some 25 confirmed COVID-19 cases (0.03 per 10,000 inhabitants) in Switzerland. Several
measures at the cantonal level followed. For instance, many cantons introduced a ban on visits to
retirement homes. Some 2.5 weeks after the first measure was implemented, the Federal Council

4

decided to close all schools and childcare centers in Switzerland as well as non-essential shops,
cafes, bars, and restaurants on March 16th. In the following, we will refer to these measures
as lockdown measures. At that point in time, the rate of confirmed infections in Switzerland
was at 4.2 per 10,000 inhabitants. The schedule of response measures in the Principality of
Liechtenstein (LI) was similar to that in Switzerland with the lockdown entering into force two
days later. Due to the two countries’ similar schedules of COVID-19 response measures, their
geographic proximity and their economic, cultural and political interconnection, we include LI
as additional data point when investigating the impact of the lockdown measures in Switzerland.
In Germany, first measures at the federal level were implemented between March 9th and
March 12th. On March 8th, when there were some 1000 reported COVID-19 cases (0.12 per
10,000 inhabitants) in Germany, the federal government advised against events with more than
1000 visitors. This recommendation was translated into a ban by most federal states, while
others implemented it as recommendation only. As in Switzerland, schools and childcare centers
in most German states closed on March 16th, the remaining states followed within two days.
The closure of all non-essential retailers, bars and public events of any kind and the restriction of
restaurant opening hours was decided at the federal level on March 16th when the overall rate of
confirmed infections reached 1.1 per 10,000 inhabitants. The states implemented these measures
between March 17th and March 20th. Other than in Switzerland and LI, these measures were
further enhanced later on. On March 22nd, a ban of groups with more than two individuals
was decided at the federal level and several states additionally implemented curfews. Since
April 17th, more and more states have made wearing face masks in shops and public transport
compulsory, resulting in a nationwide requirement to wear masks in public from April 27th on.
Meanwhile, lockdown measures have been lifted gradually in Switzerland and Germany, with
distinct schedules and exit strategies across countries and states. For instance, curfews ended
in the respective German states on April 27th, with the exception of Bavaria, where they ended
on May 5th.

Data

For Switzerland and LI, data on confirmed COVID-19 infections as well as on COVID-19related hospitalizations and deaths are amalgamated by the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health

5

(FOPH) and made available to the interuniversity research consortium of the Swiss School of
Public Health (www.ssphplus.ch). For each confirmed case, the FOPH gathers information on
the reporting canton, test date, as well as patient’s age and gender from laboratory declarations. For our analysis, we aggregate the number of confirmed infections, hospitalizations and
fatalities by canton and test date, compute the respective cumulative numbers by canton and
date, and complement the data with socio-demographic variables at the cantonal level (and for
LI) from the statistical offices of Switzerland and LI. For each of the 26 Swiss cantons and
LI, we calculate the rate of cumulative confirmed infections, hospitalizations and fatalities per
10,000 inhabitants, as well as the median age of those tested positively for COVID-19 prior to
the lockdown measures in Switzerland and LI. Furthermore, we construct indicators for whether
a canton has introduced certain additional measures not imposed by the federal government
along with variables providing the start date of such canton-level measures as stated in press
releases of the respective cantons. Additionally, we investigate data on mobility patterns of a
representative sample of the Swiss adult population before and after the implementation of the
lockdown measures. The data are collected with a GPS tracking app in the MOBIS-COVID19
study, a research project initiated by the ETH Zurich and the University of Basel, see Molloy et
al. (2020). The participants’ mobility patterns have been tracked since autumn 2019 allowing for
comparisons between mobility patterns before and after the implementation of main response
measures in Switzerland.
In Germany, all confirmed infections and deaths are reported to the Robert Koch Institute
(RKI), a federal government agency and research institute for disease control and prevention.
The RKI publishes data on the age group, gender, test date and county of residence of each
validated COVID-19 case reported to the institute. Only for the county of Berlin with 3.6 million
inhabitants, the RKI also reports the urban residential district of confirmed cases. All in all,
there are 401 counties in Germany and 12 residential districts in Berlin. Similar to Switzerland,
we aggregate the data by county (or residential district, respectively) and test date, and compute
cumulative confirmed cases and fatalities by county and date. We complement the data with
socio-demographic variables at the county/district level from the Federal Office of Statistics, the
statistical offices of the federal states and the statistical office of the city of Berlin. As most
measures in Germany were implemented at the state or even county level and at different points
in time, we generate variables for all measures indicating whether and when they were imposed
6

in each county.

Figure 1 provides the cumulative numbers of confirmed COVID-19 infections and COVID19-related deaths per 10,000 inhabitants in Germany (left) as well as cumulative numbers of
confirmed infections, hospitalizations and deaths in Switzerland (right). The figure suggests a
flattening of the COVID-19 epidemic curve in both countries after the main COVID-19 measures
have been in place for some weeks, which does, however, not necessarily exclusively reflect the
causal impact of the measures. As a further descriptive statistic, Figure 2 provides the overall
deaths per 10,000 inhabitants (thus including COVID-19-related mortality) by calendar week
in Germany and Switzerland since January 1st 2020 (provisional data). While the increase in
mortality in March and April can be linked to the COVID-19 epidemic (a finding that also holds
when controlling for the average mortality over 2015-2019), we cannot directly infer how large
the increase would have been with and without the lockdown measures. For this reason, our
analysis aims at shedding light on the causal effect of the measures.

Econometric Approach

In our analysis, we exploit the fact that the epidemic was more advanced in some regions
than in others when the key control measures came into force. In Switzerland, for instance,
Basel-Stadt had already more than 1 confirmed case per 10,000 inhabitants 12 days before

7

the federal lockdown measures were implemented, while other cantons such as St. Gallen were
at an earlier stage, reaching 1 confirmed infection per 10,000 inhabitants on the day of the
lockdown. In Germany, the county of Heinsberg recorded more than 1 confirmed infection per
10,000 inhabitants already 19 days before the lockdown. In several other counties this level of
infections was reached only after the lockdown.
For Germany, we investigate the impact of the lockdown measures as well as the curfew on
cumulative deaths per 10,000 inhabitants. For Switzerland and LI, we assess the causal effect of
the lockdown on both cumulative hospitalizations and deaths per 10,000 inhabitants. The idea
is to quantify the epidemic stage of each canton/county when measures were implemented by
defining dates on which the health outcomes are measured relative to the day a canton/county
first reached a certain rate of confirmed infections. For both Germany and Switzerland, we define
the start date of the epidemic as the day when the rate of infections first reached or exceeded
1 infection per 10,000 inhabitants. In Switzerland, for instance, the start date of the epidemic
in Basel-Stadt is on March 5th (late exposure to measures) while in St. Gallen the epidemic
started on March 16th (early exposure to measures). Appendix A provides the start states for
all Swiss cantons and LI.
Besides their obvious relevance for health care, a further motivation to consider hospitalization and death rates as outcomes is that their measurement is likely more robust to differences

8

in testing strategies across regions than the measurement of confirmed COVID-19 infections.
While the share of infections with mild symptoms being detected ceteris paribus likely rises
with increased testing, the number of hospitalizations and fatalities gives a better estimate of
the severeness of the epidemic in terms of human loss and strains for the health care system.
As both Germany and Switzerland maintain a system of mandatory health insurance and neither country generally saw their hospitalization capacities exhausted, we would suspect that the
number of COVID-19-related hospitalizations in general mirrors well the number of individuals
infected with COVID-19 that are in need of hospitalization. Nevertheless, a potential concern
in our analysis is that the criteria for hospitalizations might not be uniform across regions. The
same may apply to the measurement of fatalities, i.e. the definition of criteria according to which
a decease is attributed to COVID-19. If such measurement issues in health outcomes are not
systematically associated with the region-specific start date of the epidemic (or more generally,
with the policy interventions considered), they do not bias the results of our analysis. However,
if for instance regions with an earlier start date and a more advanced epidemic systematically
applied more stringent rules for hospital admissions (e.g. to prevent capacity constraints), this
could also entail an underestimation of COVID-19 fatalities due to underreporting deceases at
home. In this case, our analysis of the relative timing of measures presented below would likely
provide a lower bound of the true effect on (capacity-unconstraint) hospitalizations and fatalities.

4.1

OLS Approach

We compare the average number of cumulative hospitalizations and fatalities per 10,000 inhabitants on canton/county-specific epidemic days across three groups of cantons/counties. These
groups are defined by the canton/county-specific epidemic day when lockdown measures came
into place. For Switzerland and LI, we distinguish the groups of cantons as follows. Cantons
reaching or exceeding 1 confirmed infection per 10,000 inhabitants at most 4 days before the
lockdown measures are exposed to the measures at a relatively early stage of the epidemic and
constitute the reference group (sample size N = 8). Those cantons with at least 1 confirmed
infection per 10,000 inhabitants between 5 and 8 days before March 16th (or March 18th in the
case of LI) are the intermediate intervention group (N = 11). Those with a canton-specific start
date at least 9 days before March 16th are the late intervention group (N = 8).
For Germany, we proceed analogously and define the treatment groups based on the days
9

between the county-specific start of the epidemic and the lockdown according to the retail
closures between March 17th and 20th, but with somewhat different time brackets. Counties
with at least 1 confirmed infection per 10,000 inhabitants not earlier than 3 days after the
implementation of lockdown measures make up the reference group. The specified start dates
are later than the lockdown, which may at first glance raise endogeneity concerns. However, any
effect of the measures can materialize in the outcomes only with a substantial time lag of more
than 1.5 weeks (due to incubation time and reporting lags), as also confirmed in our analysis.
Therefore, confirmed infection rates are not yet influenced by the measures even several days
after the lockdown. Yet, we exclude 4 counties having start dates as late as 9 days after the
lockdown or later, leaving us with a reference group of N = 52. The intermediate intervention
group is comprised of all counties with at least 1 confirmed infection per 10,000 inhabitants
between 3 days before and 2 days after the lockdown (N = 275). The late intervention group
consists of counties with at least 1 confirmed infection per 10,000 inhabitants more than 3 days
before the lockdown (N = 81).
We estimate the difference in cumulative death rates, as well as hospitalization rates for
Switzerland and LI, between either of the two treatment groups (intermediate and late intervention group) and the reference group by means of an OLS regression with treatment indicators.
We also control for the following canton-/county-specific covariates: population size and density,
income per capita, age distribution, age structure of positively tested up to the lockdown, the
initial canton-/county-specific growth trend for confirmed cases, and canton-specific bans on visits in hospitals and retired homes entering into force prior to the lockdown. The large number of
counties in Germany allows us to further control for past mortality by age group, past mortality
rate related to respiratory diseases and hospital capacities (beds/1000 inhabitants). We also
control for state-specific measures entering into force prior to the general lockdown, like bans of
or recommendations against events with more than 1000 visitors, as well as curfews imposed in
some states only a few days after the general lockdown. Appendix B provides descriptive statistics of the covariates used in the analysis of the German and Swiss measures for the respective
total samples as well as separately for the various intervention groups.
Though aiming to control for confounders jointly affecting the region-specific epidemic and
the health outcomes in a comprehensive way, we cannot completely rule out that some important
characteristics are omitted in our analysis. For instance, we cannot directly control for the
10

amount of inter-generational interactions, which is according to Bayer & Kuhn (2020) correlated
with the ratio of deaths over confirmed cases and could potentially differ across regions. We,
however, point out that the results for the relative timing of measures are quite robust to (not)
controlling for covariates. Since the lockdown measures in Germany and in Switzerland have
been eased starting with April 20th and April 27th, respectively, we evaluate the effect of the
relative timing of measures on the health outcomes in these countries until April 23rd and April
30th, respectively.
For Germany, we also investigate the impact of curfews, as introduced in some federal states
between March 21st and 23rd on top of the federally imposed contact restriction that banned
groups of more than 2 individuals. The OLS regression contains a binary treatment indicator
for curfews as well as a range of control variables. The latter include the previously mentioned
county-specific characteristics, growth trends and COVID-19 response measures, and in addition
the cumulative confirmed infections and death rates on several days prior to the curfews, in
order to make regions exposed and not exposed to curfews as similar as possible. The OLS
specification is provided in Appendix C, descriptive statistics for counties with and without
curfews in Appendix B.

4.2

Doubly Robust Estimation

The larger number of regions in Germany allows us to also consider a more flexible (so-called
semiparametric) evaluation approach based on doubly robust (DR) estimation, see Robins et
al. (1994) and Robins & Rotnitzky (1995). It is based on (i) estimating a logit model for the
treatment probability as a function of the covariates as well as a linear model for the outcome
as a function of the treatment and the covariates and (ii) using the respective model predictions
as plug-in parameters for the estimation of the treatment effects. DR provides consistent effect
estimates if at least one of the plug-in models is correctly specified and thus relies on less stringent
assumptions than OLS. Using the ‘drgee’ package of Zetterqvist & Sjölander (2015) for the
statistical software ‘R’, we apply DR for estimating the average effect of a binary intervention
separately to subsets of counties consisting of the reference group and either the intermediate
intervention group or the late intervention group.

11

4.3

Synthetic Control Approach

For Switzerland, we complement the regression analysis with a synthetic control approach, a
quantitative case study method suggested in Abadie & Gardeazabal (2003). To this end, we
compare cumulative hospitalization and fatality rates in a specific canton with a late exposure
to the lockdown to the rates of an artificially (or synthetically) created counterfactual canton.
This synthetic canton should be comparable to the original reference canton in terms of covariates
outlined in Section 4.1 and pre-treatment health outcomes (measured 2 and 5 days after the start
date), but characterized by an earlier exposure to the lockdown.2 To this end, the synthetic
canton is generated as a weighted average of control cantons with an earlier exposure using the
‘Synth’ package of Abadie et al. (2011) for the statistical software ‘R’, where the weights depend
on how close their characteristics and pre-treatment outcomes match the values of the reference
canton with the later exposure. The control pool includes all in all 11 cantons that reached 1
confirmed infection per 10,000 inhabitants at most 3 days before the lockdown.

Results
Germany

Figure 3 reports the mean differences in cumulative fatalities per 10,000 inhabitants between
either treatment group and the early intervention group (reference group) per day up to 28 days
after the county-specific start date (solid lines) based on the OLS approach.3 It also includes 90%
confidence intervals (dashed lines). The mean differences in fatality rates between the late and
the early intervention groups (left) remain close to zero during the first 2.5 weeks of the countyspecific epidemic but show a positive and statistically significant tendency thereafter. The point
estimates suggest that after one month, fatalities per 10,000 inhabitants are reduced by 0.7 cases
under an earlier lockdown. Also the difference in death rates between the intermediate and the
early intervention groups are statistically significant at the 10 percent level, but (expectedly)

In contrast to the OLS specification provided in Appendix C, squared variables (i.e. the squares of the population
share aged 65+ and of the median age of confirmed infections prior to the lockdown) are not included. In
addition, the dummy for the number of inhabitants being smaller than 60,000 is replaced by the actual number
of inhabitants.

The motivation for the 28 days window is that we would like to include all (but 4) counties while at the same time
only considering the period when the lockdown measures were fully implemented. As the last county we include
in our evaluation sample saw its start of the epidemic 8 days after the lockdown, the time range considered in
the analysis is limited to this specific window not including any effects of the first easing of lockdown measures
starting with April 20th.

smaller in magnitude. Overall, the results suggest that the relative timing of measures had
a perceptible impact on COVID19-related fatalities in Germany. We note that Appendix C
provides the OLS specification with the full list of coefficients on treatments and covariates along
with standard errors 28 days after the start of the epidemic. Concerning the robustness of our
findings, we note that estimations without controlling for observed covariates yield qualitatively
similar results, see Appendix D).

Figure 3: OLS effects of late (left) and intermediate (right) timing of measures on cumulative deaths per
10,000 inhabitants in Germany.

Figure 4 reports the estimates of DR, which are generally similar to OLS, though suggesting
an even stronger effect of a late timing of lockdown measures on the death rate. The point
estimate suggests that an earlier lockdown reduces fatalities by roughly 1 case per 10,000 one
month after the start of the epidemic.
Figure 5 reports the results of a further OLS regression, in which the treatment indicators for
the intermediate and late intervention groups are replaced by the time lag between the countyspecific start date of the epidemic and the lockdown, in order to (linearly) estimate the effect
of the lag. This can be interpreted as the average effect of waiting an additional day before
implementing the measures. The point estimates suggest that each additional day without
lockdown entails on average 0.04 to 0.05 additional fatalities per 10,000 inhabitants after one
month of the epidemic, even though the confidence intervals are rather wide (but yet do not
include a zero effect). Again, these results are quite robust to not controlling for covariates, see
Appendix D.

Furthermore, the left graph in Figure 6 provides the OLS-based effects of curfews relative to
contact restrictions, i.e. bans of gatherings with more than 2 persons, under all other lockdown
measures already in place. The estimates have a positive sign, which appears counter-intuitive
as curfews are more restrictive than contact restrictions, but are never statistically significantly
different from zero throughout the evaluation window which starts on March 23rd and ends 35
days later. The same finding applies to estimation results based on DR, which are shown in the
right graph of Figure 6. Therefore, we do not find evidence that curfews are more effective than
banning groups for reducing fatality rates.

up to 44 days after the start of the canton-specific epidemic (solid line), as well as 90% confidence
intervals (dashed lines). See Appendix C for the full OLS specification with the coefficients on
treatments and covariates on the last day of the evaluation window and fatalities as outcome
variable. We note that the canton of Ticino is excluded from this analysis due to its comparably
strong economic and social ties with Northern Italy (which was particularly severely affected
by the COVID19 crisis), as this could arguably have affected the canton’s hospitalizations and
fatalities. However, our findings are quite similar when including Ticino in the regression, as
well as when not controlling for covariates, see Appendix E.
As for Germany, we see no immediate effect of the relative timing of measures on the health
outcomes right after their introduction. However, after about two weeks, there is a positive
tendency in the effect on cumulative hospitalizations that becomes statistically significant at the
10% level about 2.5 weeks after the start of the canton-specific epidemic. The point estimates
suggest that after 1.5 months, cumulative hospitalizations per 10,000 inhabitants increase by
almost 4 cases when introducing the measures later rather than earlier, even though the estimates
are not very precise (i.e. confidence intervals are wide). A qualitatively similar pattern is observed
for the effect on cumulative deaths, which becomes statistically significant after about 3 weeks.

10,000 inhabitants.

The point estimates suggest an increase of 1 to 2 fatalities per 10,000 inhabitants in the case of
a later lockdown, but precision is again low. Figure 8 reports the same analysis for a comparison
of the groups with intermediate and early timing. As these two groups are more similar in terms
of the relative timing of the measures, differences are less pronounced and never statistically
significant in all but one case, which might be due to low statistical power related to the small
number of cantons.4
Finally, we report the results of the synthetic control method for two cantons experiencing
the lockdown rather late relative to their start date of the epidemic. Figure 9 plots the difference
in cumulative hospitalizations (left) and deaths (right) per 10,000 inhabitants on a daily base
after the canton-specific start date between Basel-Stadt, which was on day 12 of the epidemic
when the measures came into force, and its synthetic counterfactual. The latter is generated
from a control group of 11 cantons with an earlier timing (with start dates between 3 days before
and 1 day after the lockdown). Dots on the solid line imply that the differences are statistically
significant at the 10% level according to placebo tests in the control group, in which each of the
11 cantons is considered as (pseudo-)treated in a rotating scheme in order to estimate its (pseudo)counterfactual based on the remaining 10 cantons. We, however, note that the estimation of
4

For cumulative fatalities, we also run the OLS regression using an alternative data source based on calculations of
the statistics office of the canton of Zurich, available at https://statistik.zh.ch (retrieved on May 15th). We obtain
a comparable pattern. Namely, the late intervention effect turns statistically significant after about 3 weeks with
even somewhat higher point estimates (approaching 3) at the end of the evaluation window. The intermediate
intervention effect is again insignificant.

16

(right) per 10,000 inhabitants.

p-values might be imprecise, due to the low number of control cantons available for the placebo
tests.
Again, the relative timing of measures shows no immediate effect on hospitalizations but
the difference becomes statistically significant after roughly 2.5 weeks. The point estimates
suggest that the hospitalization rate in Basel-Stadt could have been reduced by more than 4
hospitalizations if the lockdown measures had been introduced earlier. Similarily, the fatalities
per 10,000 inhabitants could have been reduced by 1 to 2 cases about 1.5 months after the start
of the epidemic. As for the OLS analysis, the exact numbers should, however, be interpreted
with caution, as they are imprecisely estimated and canton-specific factors not considered in the
analysis could play a role as well.
Figure 10 reports the results for Neuchâtel, another canton with a relatively late timing,
which was on day 10 of the epidemic when the measures came into force. Concerning the effect
of the lockdown timing on hospitalizations, we find a similar pattern as for Basel-Stadt. Albeit
the effect on COVID-19-related fatalities is somewhat less pronounced, it turns statistically
significant in the final periods of the evaluation window.

reference period of 4 weeks in autumn 2019, see Molloy et al. (2020). While mobility was
already reduced in times of comparably soft COVID-19 response measures before March 16th,
the data point to a further and drastic reduction in mobility after the implementation of lockdown
measures. The last column gives the mean difference before and after March 16th in terms of
average percentage changes in distances traveled. On average, study participants reduced their
mobility after March 16th by 57.17 % when compared to the reference period in 2019 and, as
indicated in the table, by 35.09 percentage points more than in the first two weeks of March. A
weighted regression of the pooled distance changes on an before-after-indicator for March 16th
(with the weights corresponding to the canton-specific sample sizes) yields a heteroscedasticityrobust t-statistic of 10.85 for the before-after difference. The lockdown measures therefore had
an immediate effect on mobility patterns that is highly statistically significant.

Conclusion

In this paper, we analyzed the impact of lockdown measures on COVID-19 related fatalities and
hospitalizations in Germany and Switzerland. For doing so, we exploited the fact that measures
differed across regions and that the epidemic was more advanced in some regions than in others
when certain measures came into force. Using OLS and doubly robust estimation, we compared
the development of COVID-19-related hospitalization and death rates - two indicators which are
arguably rather robust to regional differences in COVID-19 testing policies - across regions that
have been at different epidemic stages when exposed to the lockdown measures. For Switzerland,
we also applied a synthetic control approach to investigate the impact of the relative timing of the
lockdown in two selected cantons and investigated how the lockdown affected mobility patterns
19

in a representative sample. In addition, we analyzed the impact of curfews as implemented in
some German states on top of the federal ban on gatherings of more than 2 persons based on a
cross-regional comparison.
For both countries, we found an earlier lockdown to be more effective than a later one, as
cumulative hospitalisation and fatality rates measured relative to the region-specific start date
of the epidemic were higher in regions with a more advanced spread of COVID-19 when the
measures came into force. In contrast, our results did not provide evidence for curfews being
more effective than bans on gatherings under the other lockdown measures already in place.
Finally, we saw an immediate effect of the Swiss lockdown measures on behavioral patterns in
terms of a significant reduction in mobility.
