Abstract—The recent COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in high
fatality rates, especially for patients who suffer from underlying
health issues. One of the more serious symptoms exhibited from
patients suffering from an acute COVID-19 infection is breathing
difficulties and shortness of breath, which is largely due to the
excessive fluid (cellular leakage and cytokine storm) and mucoid
debris that have filled lung alveoli, and reduced the surfactant
tension resulting in heavy and stiff lungs. In this paper we propose
the use of micro-bubbles filled with exosomes that can be released
upon exposure to ultrasound signals as a possible rescue therapy
in deteriorating COVID-19 patients. Recent studies have shown
that exosomes can be used to repair and treat lung damage for
patients who have suffered from the viral infection. We have
conducted simulations to show the efficacy of the ultrasound
signals that will penetrate through layers of tissues reaching
the alveoli that contains the micro-bubbles. Our results have
shown that ultrasound signals with low frequencies are required
to oscillate and rupture the polymer-based micro-bubbles. Our
proposed system can be used for patients who require immediate
rescue treatments for lung damage, as well as for recovered
patients who may suffer from viral relapse infection, where the
micro-bubbles will remain dormant for a temporary therapeutic
window until they are exposed to the ultrasound signals.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The recent COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in many new
challenges for humanity in the 21st century. According to the
World Health Organization (WHO), more than a 100 million
people worldwide have been infected with the SARS-CoV-2
virus, and unfortunately 2.2% of those infected have resulted
in death, this mortality rate was obtained from the number of
confirmed deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases
from the data made available by the WHO in the time of
writing this paper. While the virus does not have a high fatality
rate, the risk lies with people who have underlying health
condition such as respiratory disorders and chronic diseases,
as well as the elderly age group due to their frailty. During

2020, numerous studies have been carried out to gain more
knowledge about this unknown virus, and in particular in
understanding its infection process, as well as novel treatment
techniques.
The research findings related to the infection process found
that people infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus can progress
through four different stages of infection [1]. The first stage
is described as the incubation period where the virus may
not be detected and the patient will not show any types of
symptoms. The second stage is the period in which the patient
will start showing mild symptoms such as fever, malaise and
dry cough, and during this stage the patients can be in the
pulmonary phase infection period resulting in pneumonia and
pulmonary inflammation. During this stage the virus can be
detected through testing [1]. The third stage is when the patient
starts to exhibit severe symptoms similar to Acute Respiratory
Distress syndrome (ARDS) with a high viral load [1]. The
fourth and final stage is when the patient start to recover from
the infection and is highly dependent on their immune system
response and the treatments that have been applied.
When the immune system does not react positively against
the virus, it starts to proliferate throughout the body, affecting
tissues and causing destruction. This is especially the case for
cells that have high concentrations of Angiotensin-Converting
Enzyme 2 (ACE2), which can be found in certain cells within
the lungs, kidney, intestine, arteries and heart [2]. The damage
due to the inflammatory process in the lungs can result in lifethreatening respiratory disorders and extraordinary therapeutic
efforts are required to suppress the inflammation and repair the
lungs tissues in a timely manner. For this reason, a number
of research challenges have been dedicated towards novel
treatments that can suppress the inflammatory process due to
the infection.
Recent studies have shown that the Mesenchymal Stem
Cells - Derived Exosomes (MSC-EXOS) presents the same

therapeutic benefits of MSCs [3] and can be used for the
treatment of lung damages resulting from the SARS-CoV-2
infection due to their immunomodulatory functions that can be
used for organs repair [4]. These extracellular vesicles need to
be carefully isolated and stored in special mediums during
the treatment process, and further studies are required to
determine optimal dosage of growth factor production during
the treatment. In particular, an outstanding research issue is
the ability to dynamically control the release depending on
the condition of the damaged tissue.
This paper proposes a novel solution for an external device
that can be used for automated control of MSC-EXOS release
to treat patients that are suffering from lung damage due to the
COVID-19 infection. This automated mechanism is based on
polymer-based encapsulated micro-bubbles that houses MSCEXOS that are placed in the lungs and remain temporarily
on a state of dormancy, where there is a therapeutic window
before they are removed by biological actions of the lungs [5],
until it is activated to be released for treatment. Our proposed
solution is illustrated in Fig. 1, where the ultrasound source
will emit ultrasound waves that will travel deep into the lungs
to break the micro-bubbles to release the extracellular vesicles.
Our aim is to enable typical wireless body area networks to
interface the micro-bubbles within the body that can control
functions [6][7][8]. Besides applying this system to patients
who are placed on a ventilator, it can also be used for patients
who have recovered from COVID-19, but still remain viral
positive with a possibility of infection relapse. In the latter
case, the micro-bubbles will remain on a temporary therapeutic
window of dormancy in the lungs, and once they are required
to release MSC-EXOS, an ultrasound signal can be applied
and this could be from a portable device such as mobile
phone [9]. Simulation has been conducted to demonstrate the
concept and in particular on the efficiency of the ultrasound
signals that are emitted to break the micro-bubble to release
the therapeutic molecules. Our simulation results have found
that the ultrasound signal intensity and frequency required is
highly dependent on the materials within the alveoli region
(e.g., the damage in the lungs that results excessive fluid of
mucoid debris (lung edema) caused by the damage).
The paper is organized as follows: Section II presents the
overall system model of the ultrasound that is used to control
the breakage of the micro-bubbles. Section III investigates
the ultrasound propagation model, considering the attenuation,
reflection, and refraction from the different tissue mediums and
this impacts on ultrasound intensity. Section IV presents the
polymer-based encapsulated micro-bubbles and the models for
radius and its impact on a force applied leading to breakage.
Section V presents the simulation results, while section VI
presents the conclusion.

tion. The ultrasound transducers are placed externally on the
chest of the patients, where it emits ultrasound signals that
penetrate through layers of tissue to reach previously placed
micro-bubbles. The ultrasound signals will travel through
the adipose tissue, pectoralis muscle, pleural space, as well
as gaps between the rib cage, and then through the lung
tissue to reach the alveoli region where the micro-bubbles are
located. Patients can inhale the micro-bubbles containing the
exosomes that propagate through the Bronchial tubes reaching
and ultimately residing in the vicinity of the alveoli air sacks.
The inhalation process can be assisted through the use of
the ventilators in endotrachial intubated patients who are in
a critical condition. The micro-bubbles are made of polymer
material that breaks upon the exposure to sound waves which
has been previously observed in [10][11][12][13].

In this paper, we will focus mainly on two aspects of the
overall system: the intra-body ultrasound propagation model
as well as the micro-bubbles breaking process. The external
transducer that will generate and radiate the ultrasound signals
as well as the inhalation process of the micro-bubbles are
outside the scope of this paper. Our main objective with the
following models is to evaluate and quantify the micro-bubbles
breakage process in order to release the exosomes for the
treatment.
III. I NTRA - BODY U LTRASOUND P ROPAGATION M ODEL
Ultrasound technology has a number of attractive properties that make them ideal for medical applications. This
includes their radiation signals that do not cause hazards to
the body if they are below certain recommended intensity, and
can be integrated into compact low-cost miniature transducer
devices that can be easily used. The ultrasound parameters
that can be measured such as the signal speed, attenuation,
acoustic impedance, and dispersion, can be used and designed
appropriately to match different tissue characteristics [14].
According to the United States - Food and Drug Administration (US-FDA), the highest known acoustic field emissions
ISP T A.3 for diagnostic ultrasound devices used for peripheral
vessels is ISP T A.3 = 720mW/cm2 , for the Cardiac region
is ISP T A.3 = 430mW/cm2 , for Fetal Imaging & Other
is ISP T A.3 = 94mW/cm2 , and for Ophthalmic usage is
ISP T A.3 = 17mW/cm2 [15].
The main challenge for our proposed system is to optimize
the ultrasound acoustic pressure that is sufficient enough to
reach deep into the alveoli region where the micro-bubbles are
residing and to break them in order to activate the treatment.
We, thereafter, need to consider the ultrasound attenuation
caused by the tissue layers that will act as the pathway where
the signal will propagate, as well as the acoustic properties of
each tissue such as the density, speed of sound and attenuation
coefficient. At the same time, we also need to consider other
materials that will reside in the alveoli due to the lung damage
as this will also affect the signal attenuation.
A. Attenuation
Ultrasound signals will face attenuation as they propagate
through biological tissue due to the absorbance of energy by
the fluids, cells composition and structure of different tissue
layers. The attenuation affects higher frequency transmissions,
thus resulting in the signal travelling lower distances in the
tissue [14]. As shown in Fig. 2, the signals will face a number
of effects, and this includes reflection and attenuation as the
signals propagate between the different impedance level of
each tissue layer.
The attenuation model for the ultrasound signal, which gets
attenuated due to the frequency and distance, is represented
as follows [14][16]:
Id = Is 10−(

αf d
10 )

,

(1)

where Id and Is are the ultrasound intensity levels at a distance
d from a source s, respectively, α is the attenuation coefficient

of the various tissue type, f is the ultrasound wave frequency,
and d is the distance between the source and the target microbubbles.
For the micro-bubbles radius oscillation model developed by
Hoff, which will be explained in section IV in this article, he
used the acoustic pressure as excitation for the micro-bubbles
instead of the ultrasound intensity, and this pressure can be
expressed as Eq. (2) [16], where Pd is the pressure at a distance
d from a source s, Id is the intensity at the same distance
and Zmedium is the acoustic impedance of the medium where
the micro-bubble is inserted which can be calculated from the
product between the density (ρ) and the speed of sound (c) of
the medium.

Pd = (Id Zmedium ) 2 ,

(2)

Both Eq. (1) and Eq. (2) are going to be used for the simulation
process of the ultrasound intensity attenuation through the
tissue layers and to determine the acoustic pressure reaching
the micro-bubbles at the specified distance within the lungs
respectively.
B. Reflection
As the ultrasound signals penetrate through the different layers of the tissue, it will encounter different acoustic impedance,
which can contribute to the reflection of the signals as well.
Based on two materials Z1 and Z2 with incident ultrasound
signal Is and the received signal Ir at distance d, we can
represent this relationship as [16]
Ir
(Z2 − Z1 )2
.
=
Is
(Z2 + Z1 )2

(3)

However, we are interested in the transmitted ultrasound
signal It , that will continue propagating through the different
tissue layers eventually reaching the micro-bubbles, and it can
be obtained from Eq. (3) as follows [16]:
It = 1 −

IV. P OLYMER -BASED M ICRO - BUBBLES FOR E XOSOMES
E NCAPSULATION
Over the years numerous studies have been carried out
to incorporate drugs and therapeutic molecules within the
encapsulated micro-bubbles to help with different treatments
that require targeted drug-delivery [17] [10] [18]. For example,
micro-bubbles with 0.1µm to 10µm diameter, have been used
as ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs) to improve the quality
of the images that use ultrasound technologies. The most
common approach used for micro-bubble based drug-delivery
is by either attaching or inserting the substances into the
encapsulating shells (this could be in a two-coated shell).
However, our application requires that we rupture and break
the micro-bubble, which will have the shell’s thickness as
one of the main factors to overcome, and so adding another
layer, a viscoelastic layer for example, to the shells will limit
the micro-bubble’s oscillation amplitude, which makes the

addition, he also considered that the pressure far from the
bubble (p∞ ) is the sum of the surrounding liquid pressure
p0 and the acoustic pressure that is being applied pi (t) [11].
These assumptions resulted in Eq. (7), which represents the
micro-bubble motion equation, described as follows:

rupture process very difficult. In particular, when we focus on
the release of the exosomes at low acoustic amplitude [19].
Therefore, an alternative solution is to insert the exosomes,
contained in the hydrogel fluid, into the gaseous nucleus of
the micro-bubble, as illustrated in Fig. 3, which in turn will
transform it into an anti-bubble.
According to Kotopoulies et al. [19], the dynamics of the
anti-bubble is similar to the dynamics of a gas bubble if the
liquid core is less than 50% of the micro-bubble’s diameter
[19]. This way, we can use a simplified version of Church’s
model [20] that was developed by Hoff et al. [11] for the
oscillations of polymeric micro-bubbles considering the effects
of structure that utilizes an encapsulating shell. The oscillation
behaviour of the micro-bubble is represented as:

where R1 and R2 are the inner and outer shell radii, ρL is
the density of the surrounding liquid, pge is the gas equilibrium
pressure within the micro-bubble, R1e and R2e are the inner
and outer shell radii at equilibrium, dSe is the shell thickness
at equilibrium, p∞ (t) is the pressure in the liquid far from
the micro-bubble, κ is the gas polythropic exponent, µL is
the shear viscosity of the surrounding liquid, and µS and Gs
are the shear viscosity and shear modulus, respectively, of the
polymer micro-bubble shell [11].
The Eq. (5) is represented as a function of the inner and
outer radii of the micro-bubble. However, Hoff modified Eq.
(5) into a function of the outer radius R = R2 (t). To do that,
he used the following expression [11]:

Hoff also considered that at equilibrium, the pressure in the gas
inside the bubble can be assumed to be equal to the hydrostatic
pressure of the surrounding liquid (pge = p0 ) [11], which
means that there is no tension in the shell at equilibrium. In

V. S IMULATIONS
A. Simulation Model
We developed a simulation model using MATLAB, where
we simulate the ultrasound signal intensity that propagates
through various layers of the tissue between the chest and
the alveoli, and this includes the materials within the alveoli
that resulted from the lung tissue damage, as well as signal
that penetrates through the micro-bubbles. In our simulation
study, we consider five different layers of tissues, and this
includes the skin with an average thickness of 2.05mm [25],
the subcutaneous fat tissue with a thickness of 19.57mm
[25], muscle tissue with a thickness of 3.29mm [26], the
connective tissue with 0.5mm, and finally the lung tissue with
10cm thickness [27]. The acoustic properties of each tissue are
presented in Table I. We know that for patients who suffer from
severe COVID-19 infections, the lung characteristics changes,
where the density is larger when compared to a healthy lung.
This expansion is due to the amount of inflammation and
mucus produced during the infection and this will depend on
the stage as well as the severity of the infection. In cases where
the patients suffer from respiratory distress, this expansion can
increase considerably.
B. Ultrasound Propagation through COVID-19 Damaged Tissue
To run the simulations we developed an algorithm on MATLAB using Eq.(1) - Eq.(4) and the results are shown on Fig. 4.
In the simulation results presented in Fig. 4, we tested different
ultrasound frequencies to see how it penetrates through varying
distances. The simulation also includes materials from the
COVID-19 patients in the alveoli. The results show that low
frequencies are able to penetrate towards the alveoli compared
to higher frequencies, which suffer from very high attenuation
with distance. All tissue layers caused ultrasound intensity
attenuation and reflection, however the layers before the Lung
(from the source to 2.541cm on Fig. 4) presented a lower
reflection and the ultrasound signal did propagate through all
of them up to the lungs. When the signal reached the lungs
(after 2.541cm of distance), it suffered higher absorption and
reflection for all the applied frequencies.

C. Micro-bubble Radius Oscillation Simulations
To perform the simulations of the micro-bubbles radius
oscillations, the MATLAB ”Bubblesim” package developed
by Hoff was used. For our study, we considered a microbubble with a polymeric shell of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)
(PLGA), which has a Shear Modulus of 60M P a, and Shear
Viscosity of 1P a − s [28] with 5nm of thickness and 1.5µm
for the outer radius. For the first simulations, we considered
the gas inside the micro-bubble to have the same properties
of the air, and that the micro-bubbles were inserted into the
Lung with the medium characteristics of COVID-19 Lung
tissue. Fig. 5 shows the amplitude of the oscillations with
respect to variations in the ultrasound frequency and pressure
for a single micro-bubble. The results comply with ultrasound
propagation behaviour in Fig. 4, where we find that at the
very low frequency of 0.1M Hz we will obtain high radius
oscillations of the micro-bubbles. At this particular frequency,
the amplitude is large enough to rupture the micro-bubble.
While at 0.3M Hz we observe small oscillations, that is not
sufficient to break the micro-bubble.
The same simulation process was done for the other ultrasound intensity limits specified by the US-FDA (94mW/cm2 ,

micro-bubbles that will break within the lung. The simulation
considered five micro-bubbles inside a lung infected with
COVID-19, from which the reference values can be observed
in Table I. The micro-bubbles are placed at a distance of
1.8cm from each other at the same depth. The results from the
simulations are shown in Fig. 6. For the intensity source of
94mW/cm2 , three micro-bubbles ruptured and two oscillated
with the applied frequency of 0.1M Hz and for the other
frequencies, part of the micro-bubbles oscillated or did not
suffer any excitation. When the micro-bubbles were applied
430mW/cm2 , four micro-bubbles ruptured and one oscillated
with 0.1M Hz, one micro-bubble ruptured and the rest oscillated with 0.3M Hz. At the same time some oscillations
were observed and for other micro-bubbles no excitation was
observed for the other frequencies. For the ultrasound intensity
of 720mW/cm2 , the micro bubbles showed the same results
obtained for 430mW/cm2 with frequencies of 0.1M Hz and
0.3M Hz, and for the other frequencies some micro-bubbles
oscillated and some did not suffer excitation.

in order to rescue patients who are infected and seriously
compromised with the virus. In this paper, we proposed an
ultrasound-based control of exosomes release from microbubbles for treating lung damage from COVID-19 infection.
Simulations have been conducted to validate the required intensity and frequency of ultrasound signals that will penetrate
different layers of the tissue to reach the alveoli containing the
micro-bubbles. The results from the simulations showed that
very low frequency signals are more efficient in oscillating
and vibrating the micro-bubbles in order to break them to
release the exosomes. Our proposed approach can lead to
future reactive and proactive treatments, where micro-bubbles
can be ruptured to release the exosomes on demand.
