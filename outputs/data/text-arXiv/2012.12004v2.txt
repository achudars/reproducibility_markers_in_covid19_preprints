Abstract: We employ the epidemic Renormalization Group (eRG) framework to understand,
reproduce and predict the COVID-19 pandemic diffusion across the US. The human mobility across
different geographical US divisions is modelled via open source flight data alongside the impact of
social distancing for each such division. We analyse the impact of the vaccination strategy on the
current pandemic wave dynamics in the US. We observe that the ongoing vaccination campaign will
not impact the current pandemic wave and therefore strict social distancing measures must still be
enacted. To curb the current and the next waves our results indisputably show that vaccinations
alone are not enough and strict social distancing measures are required until sufficient immunity is
achieved. Our results are essential for a successful vaccination strategy in the US.

INTRODUCTION

The United States (US), raged by the SARS-CoV-2
virus, are paying an immense toll in terms of the loss
of human lives and jobs, with a dreadful impact on society and economy. Understanding and predicting the time
evolution of the pandemic plays a key role in defining prevention and control strategies. Short-term forecasts have
been obtained, since the early days, via effective methods
[1–3]. Furthermore, time-honored mathematical models
can be used, like compartmental models [4–8] of the SIR
type [9] or complex networks [10–12]. Nevertheless, it
remains very hard to understand and forecast the wave
pattern of pandemics like COVID-19 [13].
In this work, we employ the epidemic Renormalization
Group (eRG) framework, recently developed in [14, 15].
It can be mapped [15, 16] into a time-dependent compartmental model of the SIR type [9]. The eRG framework provides a single first order differential equation,
apt to describing the time-evolution of the cumulative
number of infected cases in an isolated region [14]. It
has been extended in [15] to include interactions among
multiple regions of the world. The main advantage over
SIR models is its simplicity, and the fact that it relies on
symmetries of the system instead of a detailed description. As a result, no computer simulation is needed in
order to understand the time-evolution of the epidemic

even at large scales [15]. Recently, the framework has
been extended to include the multi-wave pattern [17, 18]
observed in the COVID-19 and other pandemics [19].
The Renormalization Group approach [20, 21] has a
long history in physics with impact from particle to condensed matter physics and beyond. Its application to
epidemic dynamics is complementary to other approaches
[10–12, 22–29]. Here we demonstrate that the framework
is able to reproduce and predict the pandemic diffusion
in the US taking into account the human mobility across
different geographical US divisions, as well as the impact
of social distancing within each one. To gain an insight
and to better monitor the human exchange we make use
of open source flight data among the states. We calibrate
the model on the first wave pandemic, raging from March
to August, 2020. With these insights, we then analyse
and understand the current second wave, raging in all
the divisions. The eRG framework can also be easily
adapted to take into account vaccinations [23]. We propose a new framework and use it to quantify the impact
of the vaccination campaign, started on December 14th,
on the current and future wave dynamics. Our results are
in agreement with previous work based on compartmental models [30], and confirm that the current campaign
will have limited impact on the ongoing wave.

METHODOLOGY

In this section we briefly review our methods that include the open source flight data description, their interplay with the eRG mathematical model framework and,
last but not least, the interplay with vaccine deployment
and implementation.

A.

Data description

The flight data comes from the OpenSky Network,
which is a non-profit association that provides open access to real-world air traffic control dataset for research
purposes [31]. The OpenSky COVID-19 Flight Dataset
1
was made available in April 2020 and is currently updated on a monthly basis, with the purpose of supporting
research on the spread of the pandemic and the associated economic impact. This dataset has been used to
investigate mobility in the early months of the pandemic
[32] as well as the pandemic’s effect on economic indicators [33].
The data provides information about the origin and
destination airports as well as the date and time of all
flights worldwide. For our analyses we considered domestic flights in the US only. We aggregated the data, to
obtain the number of flights between all pairs of airports
per day, from the beginning of April until the end of October, 2020. Subsequently, the airports in each state and
the number of flights associated with them were combined, to give the number of within and between state
flights, on a day to day basis for the whole period.
The number of daily infected cases, which is also used
for analysis in this paper, is provided by the open source
online repository Opendatasoft 2 .

cal modeling, therefore, is challenged by statistical artifacts. For these reasons we group the states following
the census divisions 3 , as summarized in Table I and illustrated in Fig.1. Note, that contrary to the official
definitions, we include Maryland and Delaware in MidAtlantic instead of South Atlantic. The main reason is
that the population of these two states is more connected
to states in Mid-Atlantic, as proven by the diffusion timing of the virus.
Building upon our successful understanding of the
COVID-19 temporal evolution [34] we apply our framework to the US case. Building on that framework we
employ the following eRG set of first order differential
equations [15] to describe the time-evolution of the cumulative number of infected cases within the US divisions:

 X
dαi
αi
kij αj −αi
= γi αi 1 −
+
(e
− 1) , (1)
dt
ai
nmi
j6=i

where
αi (t) = ln Ii (t) ,

(2)

with Ii (t) being the cumulative number of infected cases
per million inhabitants for the division i and ln indicating
its natural logarithm. These equations embody, within
a small number of parameters, the pandemic spreading
dynamics across coupled regions of the world via the temporal evolution of αi (t). The parameters γi and ai can
be extracted by the data within each single wave. The
fit methodology is described in [14, 15].
In the US, it is well known that the COVID-19 pandemic started in NE and MA (mainly in New York City)
and then spread to the other divisions. Thus, we define
the US first wave period from March to the end of August
as shown in Fig. 2. In particular, one observes a peak of
new infected in NE and MA around April, while for the
other divisions the main peak occurs around July. We
also observe an initial feature in the latter divisions that
we did not attempt to model except for ENC (mostly located in Chicago) and WNC. For the two latter divisions,
we considered these as two independent first wave components. The US second wave is thus associated with the
episode starting in October, 2020.
As a first method, working under the assumption that
the US pandemic indeed originated in New York (MA),
we first determine the kij matrix entries between the division MA and the others. The values are chosen to reasonably reproduce the delay between the main peaks of
the first wave in pairs of divisions (C.f. the top section
in Table II). Interestingly, with the exception of NE, the
entries of the k matrix are comparable to the ones we
used for Europe [34]. For NE, a large coupling is needed
due to the tight connections between the two regions, in
particular New York City with the neighbouring states
and Massachusetts.

FIG. 2. Weekly new number of cases for all the 9 divisions.

As a second method, we used the flight data to estimate the number of travellers between different divisions,
under the assumption that the kij matrix entries are proportional to this set of data. To have a realistic matrix
for kij , we first take the mean number of flights from
division i to division j during the period from April 1st
to May 31st for the first wave, and from September 1st
to October 31st for the second wave. Then, we multiply
the number of flights by an effective average number of
passengers, and normalize it by 106 , following the definition of kij [15]. For the first wave, the optimal average
number of passenger is found to be 10, while for the second wave we find an optimal value of 5. Note that these
values do not correspond to the actual number of passengers in the flights: in fact, the values of the couplings
kij also take into account the probability of the passengers to carry the infection as compared to the average
in the division of origin. When the value is low it might
suggest that the sample of passengers in a flight is less
infectious than average, as people with symptoms tend
not to travel. Controls at airports may also contribute to
this. The key information we extract from the flight data
is the relative flux of infections among different divisions.
The results are listed in the middle and bottom sections of Table II. We keep the same value from the previous fit only for MA-NE. The reason behind this choice
is the tight connection between the two divisions, where
most of the human mobility is imputable to road trans-

port.
By the end of November, we clearly observe a new
rise in the number of infections, signalling the onset of a
second wave pandemic in the US (see Fig. 2). Using our
framework, we model and then simulate the second wave
across the different US divisions.
Finally, to check the geographical diffusion of the virus
during the various phases of the pandemic in the US,
we define an indicator of the uniformity of the new case
incidence [18]. This indicator can be defined week by
week via a χ2 -like variable, given by:
9

1X
χ (t) =
9 i=1
2



2
Ii0 (t)
−1
,
hI 0 (t)i

(3)

where Ii0 (t) is the number of new cases per week in division i at time t and hI 0 (t)i the mean of the same quantity
in the 9 divisions. The parameter χ2 quantifies the geographical diffusion of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the US:
the smaller its value, the more uniform the pandemic
spread within the whole country. The result is shown in
Fig. 3: during the first peak in April (light gray shade),
the value of χ2 is large, signalling that the epidemic diffusion is localized in a few divisions; during the second peak
of the first wave (gray shade), the value has dropped, signalling that the epidemic has been spreading to all divisions. Finally, the data for the ongoing second wave (dark
gray shade) shows that χ2 is dropping towards zero, as

Vaccine deployment and implementation

Various vaccines have been developed for the COVID19 pandemic, and their deployment in the US has already
started on December 14th 4 . The effect of the immunization due to the vaccine has been studied in the context
of compartmental models, like SEIR [30]. In our mathematical model, the simplest and most intuitive effect is a
reduction of both the total number of infections during a
single wave, ai , and/or the effective diffusion rate of the
virus γi , in each division.
To validate this working hypothesis, and understand
how the vaccination of a portion of the population affects
the values of a and γ in the eRG framework, we studied
the effect of immunization in a simple percolation model,
which has been shown to be in the same class of universality as simple compartmental models [35]. To do so, we
set up a Monte-Carlo simulation, consisting of a square

4

https://www.washingtonpost.com

5
grid whose nodes are associated to a susceptible individual. Each node can be in four exclusive states: Susceptible (S), Infected (I), Recovered (R) or Vaccinated (V).
At each step in time in the simulation, for each node we
generate a random number r between 0 and 1: if the
node is in state S in proximity to a node in state I and
r < γ∗ , we switch its state to I, else it remains S; if the
node is in state I and r < ∗ , we switch its state to R,
else it remains I; if the node is in state R or V, it will
not change. This model reproduces the diffusion of the
infection, where γ∗ is the infection probability on the lattice and ∗ is the recovery rate. Finally, we fit the data
from the simulation to the solution of a simple eRG equation to extract γ and a. The vaccination is implemented
by setting a random fraction Rv of nodes to the state V
before the simulation starts. The values of a and γ as
a function of the fraction of vaccinations are shown in
Fig.4: we observe that both parameters are reduced by
the same percentage as the vaccination up to Rv . 25%.
Above this value of vaccinated nodes, the simulation is
unstable and the result cannot be trusted. This result,
nevertheless, demonstrates that the vaccination reduces
both parameters a and γ proportionally reinforcing our
expectation.

We can thereby assume that a fraction Rv of the population is vaccinated in a time interval ∆t . The rate of
vaccinations is therefore c = Rv /∆t . This implies that
the variation in γ, during the time interval from tv to
tv + ∆t , is given by:
dγ(t)
= −c γ(tv ) ,
dt

(4)

where γ(tv ) is the effective infection rate before the start
of the vaccination campaign. The solution for the timedependent effective infection rate is
γ(t) = γ(tv )[1 − c(t − tv )] ,

(5)

until t = tv + ∆t , after which γ remains constant again
at a reduced value γ(tv ) (1 − Rv ).
To find the variation of a(t) within the vaccination
interval tv to tv +∆t , we assume that the not-yet-infected
individuals are vaccinated at the same rate c as the total
population. Thus, at any given time, the variation in
the number of individuals that will be exposed to the
infection, ea(t) , is proportional to the difference ea(t) −
eα(t) . This leads to the following differential equation:
da(t)
= −c (1 − eα(t)−a(t) ) .
dt

10 000

(6)

This equation needs to be solved in a coupled system with
the eRG one. Note that the derivative is zero outside of
the time interval [tv , tv + ∆t ]. In the numerical solutions
for the effect of the vaccine, we will add one equation for
each ai (t), assuming that the vaccination rate c is the
same in all divisions.

In a realistic scenario, the vaccination of the population can only be implemented in a gradual way, so that
the total vaccination campaign has a duration in time.

The epidemic data (C.f. Fig.2) shows that the MA division (New York City) was first hit hard by the COVID19 pandemic, and was followed closely by NE. The other
divisions witnessed a comparable peak of new infections
3-4 months later. Note that we are using cases normalized per million to facilitate the comparison between divisions with varying population. As a first study, we want
to test the eRG equations (1) against the hypothesis that
the epidemic has been diffusing from MA to the other divisions. The parameters ai and γi are fixed by fitting
the data, as shown in Table III. Thus, the timing of the
peaks in the divisions is determined by the entries of the
kij matrix. Determining all 81 entries from the data is
not possible, as we only have 9 epidemiological curves.
Thus, we assume that only the couplings between the
source MA and any other division are responsible. The
results of the fits are shown in the top block of Table II,
and will be used as a control benchmark.

TABLE III. Parameters of the eRG model for the first and second wave in the 9 divisions. For the first wave, we report the
values from the fit, including the 1σ error. For the second wave, the values are chosen to reproduce the current data, adjourned
to December 16th.

Except for k21 that links NE and MA, all the other k2j
are of order 10−3 , thus confirming the range we found
for the European second wave [34]. The value of k21
is of order unity, which implies that there is a stronger
connection between the two divisions. This may be explained by the fact that there exist a significant flow
of people between New York City and the neighbouring
states (including Massachusetts) in New England. Work
commutes and weekend travelling by car explains the required high number of travellers per week. Another interesting feature is the presence of a small peak of infections
for ENC and WNC, around March. This feature cannot
originate from the MA division, as that would imply a
k-value of order 10, which is clearly unrealistic [15]. The
only viable solution is that the epidemic hit these two
divisions from abroad. On the other hand, the second
peak observed around August can be explained by the
interaction with MA.
The values of kij are, in principle, determined by the
flow of people between different divisions. Thus, we could
use any set of mobility data [36] to estimate the relative numbers of the entries, while the normalization also
depends on the effective infection power of the traveling individuals and it can be determined from the data.
With the help of mobility data, we can reduce the 81
parameters to a single one. Due to the large distances
across divisions, we decided to focus on the flight data,
as described in the methodology section. The values of
the entries are reported in the middle section of Table II.
Note that for MA-NE we used the same value obtained
from the previous fit, as the people’s flow is mostly dominated by land movements.
Using this matrix of kij to simulate the spread of the
first wave across the country, as originating from MA, we
obtain the curves in the left panels of Fig.5. For nearly
all divisions, we obtain the correct timing for the peak,
with the exception of SA and ESC (for ENC and WNC,
the anomaly may be linked to the presence of a mild
early peak and the absence of a prominent second peak).
The results are more accurate for divisions far from MA,

thus validating the method as the diffusion of the virus
seems to depend on the people travelling (by air) among
divisions. For SA, the predicted curve is substantially
anticipated compared to the data: this discrepancy may
be explained by the presence of an air hub in Atlanta, GE,
so that many of the passengers of flights landing there do
not stop in the division but instead take an immediate
connecting flight.

B.

Understanding the second wave

The US states are currently witnessing a second wave,
which is ravaging in all the 9 divisions with comparable
intensity. Previous studies in the eRG framework have
uncovered two possible origins for an epidemic wave to
start: one is the coupling with an external region with
a raging epidemic [15], the second is the instability represented by a strolling phase in between waves [17, 18].
We have shown that the former mechanism can account
for the peak structure during the first wave.
As a first step, we will try to use the same method to
understand the second wave. Since travelling to the US
from abroad has been strongly reduced and regulated, we
will consider the divisions that witnessed a peak in JulyAugust as source for the second wave. To this purpose,
we define a Region-X [15] as an average sum of all the
divisions with a pandemic peak occurring in the JulyAugust period. The parameters are chosen to reproduce
the number of cases in the totality of the relevant 7 divisions (SA, ESC, NSC, ENC, WNC, M and P) normalized
by the total population. For each division, we optimized
ai and γi to reproduce the current data adjourned at
December 16th (C.f. Table III). For the couplings kij
we use the flight data, except for the usual MA-NE couplings (C.f. bottom section of Table II). Finally, the k0j
connecting the 9 divisions to the source Region-X are
computed by summing the k entries between the division j and the 7 divisions used to model Region-X (also
derived from flight data).

FIG. 5. Simulation of the spread of the first wave (left plots) and the second wave (right plots) using flight-data-derived kappa
matrix. For the first wave, MA is used as a seed region, while for the second wave a combination of the first waves among
divisions acts as the seed region (Region-X). The vertical dashed lines in the right column plots mark the date when the
simulation was done. The data points in the grayed region where not used to tune the eRG solutions.

The results of the eRG equations are shown in the right
panels of Fig. 5, showing a good agreement. The values
of the k0j of the Region-X are one order of magnitude
larger than the others. This fact can be interpreted by
the presence of hotspots in each division which also contribute significantly to the new wave. In other words,
traveling among divisions cannot be the only responsible
factor for the onset of the second wave in the US. This
hypothesis can also be validated by studying the uniformity of the distribution of the new infections in various

states during the three peaks, as shown in Fig.3. Comparing the three peak regions, we see that the uniformity
indicator is systematically decreasing, thus indicating a
more geographically uniform presence of the virus.
It is also interesting to notice that the value of γi for the
second wave is systematically smaller than the infection
rate during the first wave. This is in agreement with
the results we found in [17, 18], where we modelled the
multi-wave structure of the pandemic via an instability
inside each region. The result of this simple analysis

8
supports the hypothesis that the virus is now endemic
for all states in the US, thus a multi-wave pattern will
continue to emerge. Traveling among states (or divisions)
is less relevant at this stage.
The result of our eRG analysis shows that the current wave will end in March-April 2021. Note, however,
that we have not taken into account the potential disastrous effect of the Christmas and New Year holidays,
which could lead to an increase in the infection rates. In
some divisions there is a increase at the end of November,
which can be attributed to the Thanksgiving holiday.

C.

Effect of the current vaccination strategy

Following the development of multiple vaccines for
the SARS-COV-2 virus 5 , vaccination campaigns have
started in many countries, including the US. This will
influence the development of the current wave, and help
in curbing the future ones. The vaccination campaign
started on December 14th in the US 6 . We also know
that the US has purchased 100 million doses from Pfizer
(plus an additional 100 million from Moderna) 7 , so that
at least 20% of the population may be vaccinated in this
first campaign. As of December 28, 0.64% of the total population has been vaccinated 8 in a little over one
week, thus in our study we will use this as a benchmark
weekly rate. The data listed above defines our starting
benchmark for the current vaccination campaign.
To study the effect of the vaccinations, we have solved
the eRG equations for the second wave, with the addition
of the reduction of ai and γi , as detailed in the methodology section. We show the result for two sample divisions
in Fig.6 (dashed curves) as compared to the same solutions without vaccines (solid curves). A vaccination at a
0.64% rate per week does not affect the peak of new infections. As a reference, we also increased the vaccination
rates to 1% and 2%: in these cases, an important flattening of the epidemic curve can be observed for SA, where
the vaccination started early compared to the peak of infections. This situation may be realized, as the vaccine
is being administered to the population that is more at
risk of being infected by the virus. In the other extreme
case, represented by WNC, the vaccine is ineffective in
changing the current wave because the peak has already
been attained before the vaccination campaign started.
Our results confirm that the current vaccination strategy, which is performed during a peak episode, is not effective to substantially slow down the spread of the virus.
On the other hand, the effectiveness for future waves is
not a question. It would be, in fact, very efficient to be

able to administer the vaccine to a larger portion of the
population before the start of the next wave.

D.

Update of the vaccination to the first quarter
2021

As shown in the right column in Fig. 5, our simulation
of the second wave, done in mid December 2020, reproduces very well the epidemiological data up to March 17,
2021. The only exception is Pacific, which has seen a
sharper drop in the number of new infections. Furthermore, one can clearly see a rebounce in January that can
be accredited to the Christmas holidays. Nevertheless,
this small effect does not have a significant impact on
the agreement of our prediction with the data.
In the first quarter of 2021, the vaccination campaign
has also taken off steadily, with nearly a quarter of the US
population having received at least one shot of vaccine.
Furthermore, since February 27 the FDA has authorised
the use of the Janssen mono-dose vaccine 9 , which is now
being administered together with the two-dose Pfizer and
Moderna vaccines. The data show that the rate of vaccinations has been increasing approximately linearly with
time, thus we updated the prediction to take into account
a vaccination fraction c(t) growing linearly with time:
c(t) = u t ,

(7)

where the numerical value for each division are shown in
Table IV.
The new results are shown in Fig. 7 for the 9 divisions. We consider both people that received at least one
shot (partial vaccination, in dash-dotted lines) and fully
vaccinated ones (dashed lines), with an offset of 4 weeks
between the beginning of the two. We consider them as
two extreme cases, defining a systematic error in our account of vaccinations. In all divisions, the effect is minor,
as the vaccination campaign has started too close to the
peak of the second wave. The only exception is Pacific,
where taking into account vaccinations substantially improves the agreement with the data.
The updated results confirm that a vaccination campaign operating during a wave will not significantly affect the timing and height of the peak. Social distancing
and containment measures remain necessary. Conversely,
vaccinating a large portion of the population will certainly curb the eventual next wave.

DISCUSSION

In this paper we employ the epidemic Renormalization
Group (eRG) framework in order to understand, reproduce and predict the diffusion of the COVID-19 pandemic
across the US as well as the effect of vaccination strategies. By using flight data, we are able to see the changes
in mobility across the divisions, and observe how these
changes affect the spread of the virus. Furthermore, we
show that the impact of the vaccination campaign on
the current wave of the pandemic in the US is marginal.
Based on that, the importance of social distancing is still
relevant. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the current
wave is due to the endemic diffusion of the virus. Therefore, building upon our previous results [18], in order to
control the next pandemic wave the number of daily new
cases per million must be around or less than 10-20 during the next inter-wave period. This conclusion is further
corroborated in [37] for Europe.
We learnt that the number of infected individuals in
the current wave are not affected measurably by the vaccination campaign. However, it is foreseeable that it will
impact specific compartments such as the overall number
of deceased individuals. Our study included an immu-

nization rate between 0.64% to 2% of the total population
each week. We also updated the results with the actual
rates of vaccination in the different divisions, as of March
24, 2020. The results of our eRG model agree remarkably well with the new data from December 28, 2020, to
March 17, 2021. To curb the current and the next waves,
our results indisputably show that vaccinations alone are
not enough and strict social distancing measures are required until sufficient immunity is achieved.

Our results should be employed by governments and
decision makers to implement local and global measures
and, most importantly, the results of this paper can be
used as a foundation for vaccination campaign strategies
for governments.

Given that pandemics are recurrent events, our results go beyond COVID-19 and are universally applicable. What we have seen in the data for the US is that it
started in New York and, from there, it diffused to the
rest of the country. It is, therefore, important to contain
future pandemics at an early stage.
