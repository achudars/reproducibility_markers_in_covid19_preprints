Abstract
Strong social distancing restrictions have been crucial to controlling the COVID-19 outbreak
thus far, and the next question is when and how to relax these restrictions. A sequential timing
of relaxing restrictions across groups is explored in order to identify policies that simultaneously
reduce health risks and economic stagnation relative to current policies. The goal will be to
mitigate health risks, particularly among the most fragile sub-populations, while also managing
the deleterious effect of restrictions on economic activity. The results of this paper show that
a properly constructed sequential release of age-defined subgroups from strict social distancing
protocols can lead to lower overall fatality rates than the simultaneous release of all individuals
after a lockdown. The optimal release policy, in terms of minimizing overall death rate, must
be sequential in nature, and it is important to properly time each step of the staggered release.
This model allows for testing of various timing choices for staggered release policies, which can
provide insights that may be helpful in the design, testing, and planning of disease management
policies for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and future outbreaks.

Introduction

Social distancing restrictions like the stay-at-home orders issued in the United States are structured
as a type of everybody-or-nobody type of policy. However, limiting attention to this specific class
of policies ignores the crucial fact that diseases like COVID-19 have differential impacts of infection
on various sub-groups of the population. Disease severity and survival rates for COVID-19 have
been documented to vary significantly based on age and health of an individual (CDC, 2020). In
this paper, we make use of this inherent variation to design a more effective set of restrictions that
strategically releases some sub-groups of the population earlier than others.

1

The motivating question behind this paper is: How can we best protect the most vulnerable
members of the population? Early death rates for COVID-19 have been alarming, particularly
among the elderly. Infected individuals over the age of 65 face a fatality rate on the order of 10%
(Elflein, 2020). The first order concern here will be to reduce this death rate so that the elderly
population is not decimated by this disease. For context, young individuals under the age of 35
face a barely measurable fatality rate of under 0.1%, while the middle-aged cohort between ages 35
and 65 faces a fatality rate around 1% (Elflein, 2020).
At the time of the writing of this manuscript, a few cases of a new severe syndrome has been
documented among children, possibly related to COVID-19 (Fleisler, 2020). While these cases are
extremely rare so far, this occurrence highlights the potential uncertainty involved in evaluating the
consequences of a plan for how to relax restrictions moving forward. It is difficult to ever state with
certainty that we fully understand the risks involved in any plan, particularly one which involves
releasing some segments of the population before others.
On the other hand, keeping the entire population under strict restrictions for an extended period
of time has deleterious effects on the economy. Since restrictions were put in place in America, visits
to commercial venues are down two-thirds (Couture et al., 2020), and this decreased activity has
led to small business closure and layoff rates of around 50% in Mid-Atlantic states (Bartik et al.,
2020). Shutdown sectors represent over 20% of all US payroll employment (Vavra, 2020) and the
burden of these job losses has fallen primarily on the poor (Mongey et al., 2020).
Firms expect sales to fall by 6.5% and uncertainty about future performance has risen over 40%
(Bartik, 2020), which has led to unprecedented stock market volatility (Baker, 2020). All told,
the economic cost of closing non-essential businesses could total nearly $10,000 per household per
quarter (Mulligan, 2020), and this could cause persistent harm in the form of lower output and
employment even after the shutdown ends (Huber, 2018).
While saving lives must be the primary concern, judiciously increasing economic activity earlier
than otherwise is an important secondary goal as well. Perhaps the most important takeaway from
the analysis in this paper is how to design policies that can responsibly mitigate the economic effects
of a sustained shutdown without jeopardizing the most vulnerable members of the population.
We will make use of the inherent age-specific variation in the ability of hosts to handle infection
to design disease control policies that minimize the number of severe cases that lead to deaths while
increasing the ability of individuals to participate in activities that reduce the economic paralysis
generated by this pandemic. This paper analyzes and explores the benefits of policies that are
predicated upon around the timely release of younger individuals from social distancing restrictions
before the release of older sub-populations. Compared to standard simultaneous release policies,
carefully planned and executed staggered release polices are likely to lead to:
• Fewer infections over the entire duration of the pandemic
• Significantly lower death rate among the elderly
• Lower death rate across the whole population
• Increased economic activity at an earlier date without increased health risks
Of course, there is no perfect policy that fixes everything without any cost, so it is not surprising
that some trade-offs will exist at the heart of our proposed social distancing framework. Specifically,
within a staggered release policy, the group released first necessarily faces a higher immediate risk
of infection (and by extension, death) than they would have if they had not been released.
2

To be concrete, the proposed release of the youngest group of individuals while older groups
remain under strict restrictions might mean that expected infection and death rates among the
youngest group would increase in the short run, relative to those that would result from the delayed
simultaneous release of every individual.
On the other hand, the smaller population size at first release would also reduce overall risk to
those released, so these trade-offs are complicated and bear further scrutiny. In some cases, the net
effect of early release can actually reduce the risk faced by the young group overall, but this is not
guaranteed. There are obviously important ethical considerations if first release were to expose the
released population to higher risk and hence early return should not be mandatory.
However, it is important to remember that the recorded death rate of young individuals from
COVID-19 thus far is on the order of 0.01% (Elflein, 2020), and even the most severe staggered
release policies considered in this paper would increase the estimated death rate for young individuals by less than 0.0001%. For context, the same policies can decrease death rates for the elderly
by over 1%.
To understand why staggered release policies would have such a strong impact on decreasing
elderly death rates (and can even decrease young death rates), it is important to consider the
exponential nature of any disease outbreak. Uncontrolled infections cause more and more infections,
which leads to the disaster scenario of facing a large spike in infection rates that exceeds health
care capacity. The desire to avoid a dangerous initial peak is precisely what informed the decision
to install restrictions in the first place, and this motivation is eloquently captured in the familiar
‘flattening the peak’ narrative (CDC, 2020).
However, the unique danger of COVID-19 lies precisely in its novelty. Severe restrictions, even if
they are in place for an extended period time, will not prevent a dangerous second peak of infection
rates because there was no chance for the population to build up any meaningful level of immunity
before activity resumed (Feng et al., 2020). This is the downside of the any simultaneous release
policy that serves as the benchmark for comparison in this paper. After the entire population is
released, the infection once again may spread like wildfire. In particular, the resulting exposure
of the elderly to high infection rates would lead to a higher density of severe cases that require
intensive care, which threatens health care capacity and ensures greater loss of life.
The benefit of staggered release policies is exactly avoiding these dangerous levels of severe
infections by redistributing both the likelihood of infection from the elderly to the young and from a
more dangerous concurrent timing to a more manageable spread out timing. By releasing the young
group from restrictions at an earlier date than others, their subsequent exposure to the disease,
which would mostly result in asymptomatic or mild infections, provides a much higher density of
immunity in the population when it comes time to release the older groups from restrictions. This
lowers the likelihood of infection for everyone post-lockdown which should help avoid exceeding
health care capacity. The concept of deploying recovered individuals with antibodies into society
to restart the economy while keeping infectious contacts low is further developed in (Weitz et al.,
2020) who term it ‘shield immunity.’
Compare this manageable level of infections to the potentially dangerous secondary peak that
would appear under the simultaneous release policy. In that scenario, an overburdened health care
system has significant negative spillover effects to all members of the population regardless of their
COVID-19 infection status. Any patients with a severe infection during a time when health care
systems are overburdened face a significantly higher risk of death, and it is precisely these additional
deaths that staggered release policies are able to reduce, according to our results.
However, staggered release policies still need appropriate timing to achieve these benefits. In

3

fact, the mistimed release of certain groups may lead to an increase in death rates, so this is not
a trivial consideration. While the early release of the youngest group is generally going to be
significantly helpful, the response of the epidemic curve to specific choices of when to release older
groups is more complicated and requires more detailed analysis, as pointed out more generally by
Morris et al. (2020).
As an example, suppose young individuals have already been released. The next decision may
be when to release middle-aged individuals. Our results suggest that if this choice is timed to be
just before the peak of infections generated by young individuals, this release actually significantly
exacerbates the growth of infections to a new higher peak that can lead to noticeably higher death
rates. By waiting until after the peak of infections generated by young individuals, this release only
produces a small bump in infection rates that does not result in greater risks for anyone involved.
This result is consistent with the findings in Morris et al. (2020).
As Morris et al. show, optimal control in this context responds to the changing levels of susceptibility and infection rate in the population. Our results show that, by waiting for the population to
get past prescribed immunity levels, it is possible to ensure that each step in the staggered release
policy has the intended positive consequences.
This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the extended SEIR model. Detailed
analysis and numerical simulations of the model are presented in Section 3, and the comparison of
outcomes between staggered release policies and the simultaneous release benchmark is featured in
this section as well. Section 4 provides a discussion of the main results and concludes. Sensitivity
analysis on the more uncertain parameters are included in the Appendix.

Model

Simple SIR and SEIR types of epidemic models have been used in most current studies of COVID-19
dynamics (see, for example, Li et al. 2020; Morris et al., 2020; Sanche et al., 2020; Weitz et al., 2020).
The model introduced in this section is an extension of the standard Susceptible-Exposed-InfectiousRemoved (SEIR) model modified by the incorporation of asymptomatic infections, disease-induced
deaths, hospitalizations, and preferential mixing between different age groups. These extensions
enable a flexible description of COVID-19 disease transmission dynamics within a model that accounts for age-defined groups. Since we are modeling a single outbreak, other considerations such
as aging, migration, births, and unrelated deaths are ignored.
The population is divided into multiple age groups, also referred as sub-populations and labeled
by i (i = 1, 2, · · · , n). Each sub-population is further divided into seven epidemiological classes:
susceptible (Si ), exposed (Ei ), infectious but asymptomatic (Ai ), infectious and symptomatic (Ii ),
hospitalized
(Hi ), recovered (Ri ), and dead due to disease (Mi ). The total population is N =
Pn
N
,
where
Ni = Si + Ei + Ai + Ii + Hi + Ri + Mi (i = 1, 2, · · · , n). A disease transmission

diagram for each sub-group is depicted in Figure 1.
The model consists of the following system of differential equations:

In model (1), ki denotes the per capita rate of progression to the infectious state (1/ki represents
the mean latent period, chosen to be 10 days), γi and γai denote the per-capita recovery rate if
alive with proportion w (1/γi and 1/γai are the mean infectious periods, chosen to be 7 days), ηi
denotes the rate at which symptomatic individuals are hospitalized if alive, φi is the rate at which
hospitalized individuals leave the Hi class with proportion 1 − qi recovered and qi dead. ai (t) is the
per capita effective contact rate, i.e., contacts that can lead to infection (Hethcote, 2000). In the
case of no intervention, ai (t) = a0i = R0i γi , where R0i is the basic reproduction number for group i.
Our values for R0i are based on the recent report in Sanche et al. (2020), which gives an estimated
value of the basic reproduction number to be 5.7 (95% CI 3.8, 8.9). Although new estimates seem to
suggest that these values are on the high range, we will be using them in our examples, since these

5

values do not impact the overall objective of this paper, namely, that sequential age-dependent
group releases offer us a framework to address the opening of the economy within a policy with the
priority of protecting the most vulnerable.
Although our model is formulated for n groups, in order to illustrate our approach, we consider
three groups denoted by G1, G2, G3, representing young (age 35 and younger), middle-aged (35
to 65 years old), and elderly (65 and over), respectively. It is assumed that the young group, G1,
has a higher within-group basic reproduction number (R01 ) than the older groups with themselves
(G2 and G3). We take the values R01 = 5, R02 = 3.6, and R03 = 2.4 in our numerical simulations.
When intervention measures are implemented, here via a social distancing function that depends
on the severity of the restriction, contact rates ai will be reduced.
The specific functional form of ai (t) used is given in (4). For ease of reference, we will refer to ai
simply as a contact rate. It is assumed in the model that among the infectious people, proportions
pi and 1 − pi are symptomatic and asymptomatic, respectively. Asymptomatic and hospitalized
individuals can also transmit the disease but possibly at lower rates than symptomatic individuals
(references), which are denoted by the factors θi ≤ 1 and χi < 1, respectively. All parameters are
non-negative and their definition is also listed in Table 1. The numerical studies in this paper will
focus on these 3 age groups.
The contacts between sub-groups are described by the mixing matrix C = (cij ), where cij is
the proportion of the ith sub-group’s contacts that is with members of the j th group. We will adopt
the commonly used preferential mixing (Nold, 1980 and later extended by Jacquez et al., 1988), in
which case, the elements of C have the following form:
cij = i δij + (1 − i )fj ,

(1 − j )aj Nj
,
where fj = P
k (1 − k )ak Nk

i, j = 1, 2, · · · , n,

(3)

where i ∈ [0, 1] describe the preference level and δij is the Kronecker delta (1 when i = j and
0 otherwise). The function cij in (3) satisfies the required constraints for mixing functions (see
Busenberg and Castillo-Chavez, 1991).
Social distancing policies are introduced to reduce the standard contact rates. Here, it is assumed
that ai (t) is a function of time and that their values are influenced by the selected policy. Specifically,
we model them via step functions defined as follows:

business as usual (0) to no contact (1), ds and dr represent the duration for secondary and tertiary
restrictions which are characterized by si (t) reductions of contacts for group i for t in that secondary
and tertiary period, respectively, and finally sr represents residual restrictions after these policies
are lifted.
The parameters µi and φi denote disease related death rates for individuals in the Ii and Hi
classes, respectively. To account for the dangers of overburdening health care systems, there will
be a scaling factor added to the death rates of infected individuals as total infections approaches

We will explore the effects of different policies by simulating the model with various schedules

sb = 0.8, which corresponds to real policies used by governments around the world.

Analysis and Results

This section describes the main results of this study for three age groups (n = 3) and provides
illustrations of the approach through simulations. Since there are multiple dimensions in the policy

7

space, we first focus our attention on a set of polices with overall fixed duration. Recall that db is
the duration of initial restrictions and ds is the duration of secondary restrictions. We will consider
policies with db + ds = dT and, where dT is a fixed time where the secondary restrictions are
assumed to end.
Further, since over a month1 has already passed under restrictions, we take db ≥ 30 with sb = 0.8
and since some residual restrictions may be required the value sr = 0.1 is assumed as well. The
primary policy variable will be si (t), the severity of restrictions on each group i across time. In order
to make the notation more accessible, we use sy (t) ≡ s1 (t) to denote the severity of restrictions on
the young group (G1). Similarly sm (t) ≡ s2 (t) and so (t) ≡ s3 (t) for the middle-aged group (G2)
and old group (G3).
While our notation allows for any progression of severity measures for si (t), we will focus on
particular policies that set a certain level of restrictions on each group across chunks of time, which
we call the initial phase (which lasts for db days), the secondary phase (which lasts for ds days),
and the tertiary phase (which lasts for dt days). This structure was chosen because it allows for
a fully staggered release of the population from restrictions one group at a time. In general, the
idea will be to consider releasing the young group during the secondary phase and the middle-aged
group during the tertiary phase.

3.1

Early Release of the Young Group

First, we will consider policies that release the young group from restrictions before other groups.
There is no need to consider a tertiary period in this case, so these policies are represented by
sy (t) < sb for t > T1 + db , while sm (t) = so (t) = sb for t < T1 + db + ds . For ease of notation,
we let ssy = sy (t) for all t ∈ [T1 + db , T1 + db + ds ] and refer to them as the severity of restrictions
on the young group during the secondary period of restrictions. The range of policies available for
consideration is ssy ∈ [sr , sb ] = [0.1, 0.8].
This class of policies includes all staggered release policies and ssy = sb = 0.8 represents the
baseline simultaneous release policy, where all three groups are held under restrictions for a longer
time before being released together. The goal will be to minimize death rates: ωy , ωm , ωo and ω.
The following result shows how these death rates (ωy , ωm , ωo , ω) respond to the early release of the
young group from restrictions (ssy < sb ) by comparing outcomes from projected outbreaks under
policies with various values of ssy .
Result 3.1 Overall death rate ω and death rates for the middle-aged and elderly groups, ωm and
ωo , are strictly increasing in severity of secondary restrictions ssy , while death rate for the young
group ωy is minimized at an intermediate value of severity ssy < sb .
By fixing other aspects of the social distancing policy, such as the timing of intervention and
severity of restrictions on other groups, we are able to identify the precise impact of releasing the
young group from restrictions before other groups. The fundamental takeaway from this result is
that releasing the least vulnerable group of a population before other groups will reduce the number
of deaths overall.
This strictly monotonic relationship between severity of secondary restrictions on the young and
death rates for every group besides the young holds for all parameter values used in our simulations.
1 Simulations in this paper will assume the initial restrictions change after 30 days, but the results in this paper
are robust to how long initial restrictions have been in place. Simulations using 90 days for this value are presented
in the appendix in order to demonstrate that our results are not sensitive to this choice.

8

A comparison between these policies is presented in Figure 2 using one particular choice for these
parameters: T1 = 70, db = 30, ds = 70, sb = 0.8, sr = 0.1, and sm (t) = so (t) = sb for all
t < T1 + db + ds . That is, initial restrictions of severity sb = 0.8 were installed at time T1 = 70 for
a duration of db = 30 days. Then at t = T1 + db = 100, there is a choice of whether (and to what
degree) to release the young group from restrictions; a choice of ssy . Regardless of this choice, the
middle-aged and elderly groups are held under restrictions for ds = 70 more days, and eventually
everyone is (mostly) released (sr = 0.1) from restrictions at t = T1 + db + ds = 170 days.

Figure 2: Comparison of projected outbreaks under the simultaneous release benchmark and three
staggered release policies. Plot (a) shows the simultaneous release benchmark, with all three groups
being released from restrictions at time t = 170. Plot (a) is the baseline scenario with sy (t) = 0.8 for
t ∈ (T1 +db , T1 +db +ds ) = (100, 170), which correspond to the policy of extend the initial restriction
of SD for an additional 70 days. Plots (b), (c), and (d) show the cases when the young group has a
relaxed policy after the initial strict policy. More specifically, for t ∈ (100, 170), sy (t) = 0.5, 0.3, 0.1
in (b)–(d), respectively. Other parameter values are given in the text.
Figure 2(a) presents the baseline simultaneous release policy, which we use as a benchmark for
evaluating efficacy of staggered release policies. It is the case where all groups are held under the
same severity of restrictions for the secondary period and then all released at once at t = 170 days.
We observe that while infection rates are consistently decreasing throughout the 100 days when
restrictions are in place, the lack of population immunity at the timing of release due to such strict
9

restrictions leads to a dangerously high second peak of infection rates. This also carries significant
risk of death for the most vulnerable population, the elderly, since they will need intensive care at
a time when health care systems are overwhelmed.
Compare this benchmark simultaneous release policy with the other projected outbreaks under
various degrees of staggered released policies. Figure 2(b-d), corresponding to ssy = 0.5, 0.3, 0.1
respectively, demonstrate the effect of staggered release: shifting the delayed peak earlier in time
and decreasing the loss of life associated with that second wave. As the young group is released
from restrictions, their activity leads to more infections earlier which helps in two ways.
The increased population immunity when the other groups are released lowers the risk of infection for more vulnerable groups, and if vulnerable members of the population do get sick at the
later dates, there are fewer concurrent infections at that time so they can receive the level of care
they need. By making infections both less likely and less dangerous for more vulnerable segments
of the population, staggered release policies are able to significantly reduce death rates.
However, it may be important to note that this benefit is not without some small degree of cost.
The increased infection rates incurred by members of the young group would mechanically lead to
a slightly higher death rate under the most extreme staggered release policies (ssy ≤ 0.2). While
this is certainly a non-trivial trade-off, the actual impact is very small in absolute terms, on the
order of 0.001% higher death rates for ssy = 0.1 compared to ssy = 0.8.
Figure 3 illustrates the behavior of death rates ωy , ωm , ωo , and ω in response to the range
of choices ssy < sb . Note the straightforward behavior of ωm , ωo , and ω. These are all strictly
decreasing as the young group is subject to less severe secondary restrictions. The change in ωy
is non-trivial, benefiting from some relaxed secondary restrictions but eventually this death rate
increases as they face fewer secondary restrictions. Note that there are values of ssy representing
intermediate secondary restrictions that lead to decreased risk of death for all groups.

3.2

Intermediate Release of the Middle-Aged Group

The results in Section 3.1 present the positive impacts of releasing the young group. In this section,
we explore the impact of releasing the middle-aged group at some point between the young group
and the elderly group as well. The intuition would be that since the middle-aged group is less
vulnerable than the elderly group, staggering their releases may have similar benefits to the early
release of the young group. We will observe a similar result here, but with some caveats.
In order to facilitate the intermediate release of the middle-aged group, we will now need to
include a tertiary period of restrictions, during which that group may be released. This will be a
natural extension of previous notation. As db and ds referred to the duration of initial and secondary
restrictions, dt will be used to refer to the duration of tertiary restrictions. As before, so (t) = 0.8
for all t < T1 + db + ds + dt , but now sm (t) = stm ≤ 0.8 is another policy variable.
At this point it becomes expedient to denote four particularly important values for t. First, T1
is the day of the outbreak on which initial restrictions are installed. We will maintain T1 = 70 as
before. Next, T2 = T1 + db is the day of the outbreak on which initial restrictions are lifted and
secondary restrictions take place - for the policies in this section, the young group will be released
at this time. Next, T3 = T2 + ds is the day of the outbreak on which secondary restrictions are lifted
and tertiary restrictions take place - the middle-aged group may be released at this time. Finally,
T4 = T3 + dt is the day of the outbreak on which tertiary restrictions are lifted and every group is
released at this time if they were not already.
More detailed analysis of the degree of release has already been done in section 3.1, so here we
will focus on policies that either ‘release’ a group (si (t) = 0.1) or ‘do not release’ a group from
restrictions (si (t) = 0.8) at each cutoff time t ∈ {T2 , T3 , T4 }. Thus policies can be further simplified
as a choice of release dates (ry , rm , ro ) for the three groups, where ri ∈ {T2 , T3 , T4 }. Note that
the extremal staggered policy considered in section 3.1 with ssy = 0.1 would be represented by
(ry , rm , ro ) = (T2 , T4 , T4 ) with (db , ds , dt ) = (30, 70, 0). We call this the “young release” policy.

are at (ry , rm , ro ) = (T2 , T3 , T4 ) with levels of contact reductions: sb = 0.8, ssy = stm = 0.1, and
sr = 0.1. This describes the staggered release strategies illustrated in Figures 5(c) and (d).

11

The baseline simultaneous release policy will be the same idea as before, with all three groups
being held under the same severity of restrictions as the initial restrictions until T4 . This is represented by (ry , rm , ro ) = (T4 , T4 , T4 ). Two natural comparisons are the “young release” policy
and the “middle release” policy of (ry , rm , ro ) = (T2 , T3 , T4 ), where the young group is released
after initial restrictions and the middle-aged group is released after secondary restrictions. Figure
4 depicts the timing of policy changes for an example staggered release policy. These policies will
be evaluated based on the resulting peak size of infections and projected death rates for the elderly
(ωo ) and overall (ω).

where no groups are released until T4 = 170 days. Plot (b) is the “young release” case where
the young group is released at T2 = 100 days. Plot (c) is the “young and middle-aged release”
case, where the young group is released at T2 = 100 days and the middle-aged group is released
at T3 = 140 days. Plot (d) is the “alternate staggered release” case, where the young group is

descriptions of these results can be found in the text and Table 2.
Figure 5 shows projections for these three policy choices with (db , ds , dt ) = (30, 30, 40) along
with a fourth policy which is a slight variation on the “middle release” policy, with (db , ds , dt ) =

12

(30, 50, 40). This fourth policy is an adapted version of the “middle release” policy designed as
a minimal change in order to fix a key oversight that would lead to negative consequences if the
“middle release” policy is implemented. These four policies along with projections for peak size
and various death rates are summarized in Table 2.

Table 2: Comparison of four different policies and associated outcomes. A detailed description of
these policies can be found in the text and Figure 5 offers a visualization of their projections.
As before, the change from the baseline case (Figure 5a) to the “young release” case (Figure 5b)
is significantly positive in terms of reducing peak size and reducing death rates for the elderly and
overall. However, the “middle release” case (Figure 5c) does not correspond to an unambiguously
positive change when compared to the impact of releasing the young’ case. This second release
reduces the death rate among the elderly albeit it results in a higher death rate overall. It leads to
a higher peak size than even the simultaneous release benchmark.
The reason for this detrimental effect on overall death rate can be seen from Figure 5. Since T3
occurs close to a peak in the infection rate, releasing the middle-aged group at that point puts them
at significant risk of infection and death, even though they are much less vulnerable in general than
the elderly. This particular timing actually exacerbates the peak size of the outbreak endangers the
middle-aged group more than it protects the elderly. While the projected death rates in this case
are still lower than in the simultaneous release benchmark, the peak size is actually higher.
Fortunately, these downsides can be avoided by waiting some additional time before releasing
the middle-aged group, which we will call the “patient staggered release” policy (Figure 5d). By
waiting for infection rates to begin to decrease, the release of the middle-aged group causes only a
minor spike in infections, small enough that it does not jeopardize members of the group. While this
does result in a slightly higher risk for the middle-aged group since they were still released earlier
than in the “young release” case, this fourth policy meaningfully reduces elderly and overall death
rates, as well as decreasing peak size (see Table 2). This relationship between timing of release for
intermediate groups and the path of the outbreak informs our second main result:
Result 3.2 Assume the young group has already been released at T2 . There exists a cutoff T ∗ such
that releasing the middle-aged group at T3 < T ∗ increases death rate ω and releasing the middle-aged
group at T3 > T ∗ decreases death rate ω. This T ∗ is closely related to the time at which infection
rates begin to decrease.
The importance of properly timing intermediate release of the middle-aged group can be explained by examining the Ii and Hi equations in Model (1). The
total number of symptomatic

P3
infections at time t is given by I(t) + H(t) = i=1 Ii (t) + Hi (t) , and the nature of how this curve
responds to a subsequent group’s release is what determines whether that decision is beneficial or
harmful overall. The slope of this function I(t) + H(t) is presented in Figure 6, along with the
P3
function for population immunity at time t, R(t) = i=1 Ri (t).

13

Figure 6(a) shows the slope of the infection curve under the “young release” policy depicted in
Figure 5(b), which we can observe begins positive from T2 = 100 when young people are released
but is eventually negative at some point between T2 and T4 (there is no meaningful T3 here since
middle-aged people are not released early in this policy). This point when the slope goes from
positive to negative will be closely related to T ∗ , the cutoff point when releasing the middle-aged
group becomes beneficial.
Figure 6(b) shows the slope of the infection curve under the “middle release” policy depicted
in Figure 5(c). Here we can observe the choice of timing T3 is too early; releasing middle-aged
individuals at this value of T3 exacerbates the infection rate and this effect is what leads to higher
death rates overall. Compare this to Figure 6(c), which shows the slope of the infection curve under
the “patient staggered release” policy depicted in Figure 5(d). This choice of T3 is after the slope
of the infection curve has become negative, and it does not cause a large spike in infections.
Since it is generally difficult to accurately measure concurrent infections, one useful proxy is the
population immunity rate. The green curves presented in Figure 6 show the recovered portion of
the population. In order to identify the correct choice for T3 , it would be possible to test members
of the population for antibodies in order to conclude enough population immunity exists to believe
the next step of the staggered release policy would be beneficial. Note that the measured population
immunity at the choice of T3 in the “middle release” policy visible in Figure 6(b) would be below
20%, while the corresponding population immunity at T3 in the “patient staggered release” policy
would be closer to 40%. This is an operational method to choose T3 correctly.

used the same parameter values as in Figure 5(c) and (d), respectively. It shows that the slope at T3
is positive in (b) and negative in (c), with the immunity levels around 17% and 34%, respectively.
It also shows that the slope is zero at t = 142 days, suggesting that the middle-aged group should
be released after that time.
However, there is still an important takeaway from the fact that the “middle release” policy had
significantly negative consequences. This reveals the importance of properly considering the timing
of any staggered release policy, since the benefits of fostering immunity through release of less
vulnerable groups can be outweighed by the immediate exposure of more groups to high infection
rates. Figure 7 shows how severe these consequences can be when staggered release is timed wrong.
Releasing the middle-aged group too soon after releasing the young group puts more people
into the active population at a time when infection rates are high, and while the middle-aged
group is much less vulnerable than the elderly group, they are also much more vulnerable than the
young group so these increased infections lead to a significant increase in deaths. This leads to the

Middle-Aged Group Release Timing (Days since Young Group Release)

Figure 7: Comparison of death rates when middle-aged group is released earlier than the elderly
group, measured as the percentage change in likelihood of death. This illustrates that compared to
the “young release” benchmark, releasing the middle-aged group may decrease the elderly group’s
death rate but sharply increases the middle-aged group’s death rate.
discouraging result that the earlier this middle-aged group is released, the higher the death rate
they face will be.
However, even in this particularly stark case, the reduction in death rates for the elderly can
be strong enough to reduce death rates overall, since the elderly death rate sits at a much higher
magnitude than the middle-aged death rate. This leads to an interesting implication that releasing
middle-aged members of the population only really hurts themselves while marginally benefiting
others, so perhaps a voluntary release policy could have some merit in this context. Such questions
are likely outside the scope of this paper, however.
Finally, another important benchmark may be the one generated by the types of policies being
considered and enacted in some states, where the entire population are being already released
from restrictions. Under our framework here, this would be represented by release dates for all
three groups being immediately after initial restrictions, so (ry , rm , ro ) = (T2 , T2 , T2 ). This carries
significant risk of a dangerous second peak without any groups being protected, so it will result
in much higher death rates for the elderly and overall. A comparison between death rates for this
“early release” policy and the other policies considered in this section is presented in Figure 8.
First and foremost, the death rates for every single group is the highest under the early release
policy. Perhaps interestingly, the delayed simultaneous release policy does not perform much better
than the early release policy in terms of these projected death rates either. This relationship
reinforces the point that an essential component to any successful disease control policy must
consider some version of staggered release across groups of the population or risk simply delaying
the inevitable. Since strict measures imposed on the entire population does not allow for any
immunity to build up in the interim, there is no significant benefit to those restrictions.
However, the two staggered release policies perform much better than either simultaneous release
option. The death rates for middle-aged people is minimized under the young release option, while
the elderly death rate and overall death rate are minimized under the patient staggered release

option. This represents a non-trivial trade-off between decreasing death rates for the middle-aged
group and the elderly, but whichever choice is made would result in one of the staggered release
policies being chosen. Since members of the young group face very small risk from the disease, only
negligible changes to their death rate occurs across any of these policies.
The more fundamental question of how to handle the trade-off between economic stagnation
and health risks is certainly difficult to answer, but from these results it would appear that however
that problem is ultimately tackled, the resulting optimal policy must incorporate some form of
staggered release. An early simultaneous release is far too costly in terms of health risks and loss
of life to justify the marginal increase in economic activity compared to even a slightly staggered
release policy. On the other hand, a delayed simultaneous release is both economically detrimental
and more dangerous than staggered release policies.

Discussion

The results in this paper support the possibly counter-intuitive notion that releasing some groups
earlier from social distancing restrictions may in fact benefit everyone involved. While standard
policies under consideration almost always treat the entire population as one group for the purposes of enacting or retracting restrictions, the optimal policy should actually treat sub-groups of
16

the population differently and release them from restrictions sequentially in order to best protect
vulnerable members of the population while also promoting economic recovery.
It should be noted that the age distribution used in the analysis within this paper is appropriate
for the population of the USA, but applying the same framework to other countries may require
significantly different population assumptions. For instance, countries like Italy, Japan, or Spain
would have a higher proportion of elderly individuals. While the qualitative results should still hold,
any quantitative conclusions would obviously be sensitive to the age structure of the population.
One of the main results is that releasing the youngest group of the population, which in the model
considered here was the section of the population under the age of 35, will not only significantly
reduce death rates among the elderly, but also reduce death rates for the middle-aged group and
potentially for the young group as well. This type of staggered release policy succeeds in these goals
by preventing a dangerously high second peak from occurring while protecting the most vulnerable
group, the elderly, by allowing a higher degree of immunity to build up in the population before
they are released.
Compared to the delayed simultaneous release benchmark, staggered release policies that release
the young group first can save a significant portion of lives among the elderly. In the particular
example presented in Figure 3, the magnitude of this effect exceeds a 10% reduction in elderly
death rates, which would translate to over 1% of the elderly population being saved, since the
elderly face a recorded 10% death rate (Elflein, 2020). The estimated size of this effect is robust
to alternate parameter specifications, and some sensitivity analysis is presented in the Appendix.
For comparison, the corresponding estimated increase in the death rate of young individuals in this
example is on the order of 0.0001%.
While 0.0001% is still positive, there are many aspects of society which involve some group
accepting (in some cases, significantly) greater personal risk in order to reduce risks faced by
others. Some examples include military service, first responders, and health care workers during
this pandemic. For young individuals under a staggered release policy, this slight increase in risk
would also be compensated by the ability to return to work and everyday life at a much earlier
date.
Furthermore, even a staggered release policy that releases young people from restrictions would
not require every single person under the age of 35 to resume activity. The already small death
rate observed among the young is likely driven primarily by a subset who are immunocompromised
or otherwise find themselves at higher risk, and these individuals can elect to remain at home. If
these choices were taken into account, it is likely that even the most severe staggered release policies
would not increase the death rate among the young.
Another important result demonstrates the importance of properly timing the release of subsequent cohorts in order to optimally control the progression of an outbreak. Comparing Figure
5(c) with Figure 5(d) reveals the stark change in outcomes if the release of middle-aged individuals
is mistimed to be even a few weeks too early. Releasing these individuals from restrictions while
infection rates are still rising results in a significantly higher peak size of infections and much higher
death rates compared to waiting and releasing them after infection rates have begun to fall.
Importantly, while economic considerations were mentioned as a motivating factor behind the
earlier removal of restrictions for some groups, there were no actual economic components in the
model we used in this paper. Our conclusion that staggered release policies outperform simultaneous
release policies is shown through a direct comparison of health risks and aggregate loss of life
estimated from projections of the outbreak under these policies. The fact that earlier release of
certain sub-groups enhances economic activity on the whole is a further benefit to staggered release

17

policies, but this is a benefit that exists outside of our model.
We want to stress that we do not use increased economic activity to justify increasing health
risks or loss of life. Staggered release policies accomplish both goals rather than putting either one
before the other. We also want to stress that while the analysis in this paper provides support for
the idea of releasing some people earlier, it absolutely does not provide support for any plan to end
all social distancing policies prematurely.
The very idea of a staggered release policy is to only release part of the population, and releasing
everyone early would lead to disastrous results. The analysis we perform relies on the continuation
of restrictions on the older and more vulnerable group(s) in order to achieve better outcomes for
them in particular. Releasing these groups early as well would result in a higher risk of death for
everyone and would never be justified by the type of analysis done here.
Additionally, the underlying parameters used in this paper rely on current knowledge and beliefs
about COVID-19 – preferential mixing parameters, proportion of asymptomatic cases, infectious
period, etc. The commonly accepted values for these may change in significant ways as we learn
more about the disease, but our qualitative results hold across a wide variety of choices for these
parameters. This sensitivity analysis is presented in the Appendix.
Ultimately, it was our goal to analyze the idea that staggered release policies may have some
meaningful advantages over a delayed release for everyone. While there must certainly be more
analysis with much greater precision before we could confidently recommend these policies be implemented, we do believe there is significant merit to their consideration. Even before economic
concerns are inserted into the discussion, it appears that there can be direct benefits to all parties
involved in terms of a lower risk of infection and death. When such concerns are incorporated,
staggered release policies would thoroughly outperform simultaneous release policies.

4.1

Conclusion

Social distancing restrictions have been a powerful and important tool in controlling the spread of
COVID-19 and keeping infection rates low enough to avoid exceeding health care capacity. Now
that the initial phase of the outbreak has been addressed, the next step is to properly schedule the
relaxation of constraints in order to optimally control the entirety of the outbreak. The decision
to lift restrictions on everyone simultaneously is perhaps the natural policy, but this can have dire
consequences if a second peak arises as a result of insufficient immunity in the population. Such
an outcome would defeat the purpose of installing restrictions in the first place, so it is crucially
important to consider more effective policies in terms of when to release people from restrictions.
To summarize, the early release of young individuals provides an interim period that allows
them to build up some degree of immunity without facing significant health risks themselves, in
order to protect older and more vulnerable individuals from severe health risks by reducing their
likelihood of infection and death. As an added benefit, the staggered release policy allows for more
activity in the population at an earlier date than the delayed simultaneous release policy would.
Thus staggered release policies can positively impact everyone involved by allowing people to return
to their lives without risking them.

Appendix

We include in this appendix 3 examples to demonstrate that the main conclusions discussed in this
paper are not sensitive to the choice of those model parameters that have high level of uncertainty.
These include the proportions of symptomatic infections (pi ), levels of preferential mixing (i ), and
the recovery rate γ. We will present the aggregate death rates between a staggered release policy
and a simultaneous release policy for a variety of values for each of the following parameter groups:
proportion of asymptomatic cases (pi ), preferential mixing (i ), recovery rate (γ), and the duration
of restriction for the initial period (db ).

A.1

Proportion of asymptomatic infections, pi

Consider first the parameters pi . The values used in the simulation presented in the main text
are (py , pm , po ) = (0.25, 0.5, 0.8). To check how variation of these parameter values may affect the conclusions, such as the disease-induced death rates. we examined the following sets:
(py , pm , po ) = (0.25, 0.25, 0.25), (0.5, 0.5, 0.5), (0.8, 0.8, 0.8), (0.35, 0.25, 0.45), and (0.1, 0.2, 0.3). All
other parameters are the same as in Figure 8. Results are shown in Figure 9(a), and we observe
qualitatively the same behavior as in Figure 8.

A.2

Preferential mixing parameters, i

The parameter values used in the main text are (y , m , o ) = (0.7, 0.5, 0.9). Consider the following
choices for these values: (y , m , o ) = (0.5, 0.5, 0.5), (0.9, 0.9, 0.9), (0, 0, 0), and (0.35, 0.25, 0.45). All
other parameters are the same as in Figure 8. This is presented in Figure 9(b). Again, we observe
qualitatively the same behavior as in Figure 8.

A.3

Recovery rate γ of symptomatic infections

In the main text, we used 1/γ = 7. For robustness, we will examine: 1/γ = 4, 6, 8, and 10. All
other parameters are the same as in Figure 8. This is presented in Figure 9(c).
In all three cases A1–A3, the main result that staggered release leads to lower death rates for
older groups and overall relative to the simultaneous release benchmark holds across a wide variety
of choices for these parameters for which the correct values are less certain in the literature.

Length of Initial Restrictions

In the main text, we used db = 30 days. Our simulations with db = 60 and db = 90 days show
similar qualitative results as that for db = 30 days presented in Figure 5.

Figure 10: Similar to Figure 5 but with db = 90 for the initial duration (db = 30 in Figure 5). All
other parameter values are the same as in Figure 5. The projected overall death rates are: (a) 1.38,
(b) 1.26, (c) 1.29, and (d) 1.11, and these follow the pattern as the cases in Figure 5.
