Abstract
COVID-19 has quickly spread across the globe, becoming a pandemic. This disease has a
variable impact in different countries depending on their cultural norms, mitigation efforts and
health infrastructure. In India, a majority of people rely upon traditional Indian medicine to treat
human maladies due to less-cost, easier availability and without any side-effect. These medicines
are made by herbal plants. This study aims to assess the Indian herbal plants in the pursuit of
potential COVID-19 inhibitors using in silico approaches. We have considered 18 extracted
compounds of 11 different species of these plants. Our calculated lipophilicity, aqueous
solubility and binding affinity of the extracted compounds suggest that the inhibition potentials
in the order; harsingar > aloe vera > giloy > turmeric > neem > ashwagandha > red onion > tulsi
> cannabis > black pepper. On comparing the binding affinity with hydroxychloroquine, we note
that the inhibition potentials of the extracts of harsingar, aloe vera and giloy are very promising.
Therefore, we believe that these findings will open further possibilities and accelerate the works
towards finding an antidote for this malady.

Introduction
The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been declared as a worldwide epidemic by the
world health organization (WHO). According to the latest update of the WHO1, there are more
than 1 million cases of the COVID-19 worldwide, causing almost 50 thousand deaths affecting
203 countries, areas or territories. This novel coronavirus was detected in late December 2019
and recognized in early January 2020 in China2,3. On 11 February 2020, the international
committee on taxonomy of viruses declared this “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2” (SARS-CoV-2) as the new virus4. Presumably, this virus picks up its name from the virus
responsible for the SARS outbreak of 2003 as they are genetically related but different.
Subsequently, the WHO announced “COVID-19” as the name of this new disease5. The COVID19 spread abruptly across the globe, becoming a pandemic within a couple of weeks and apart
from China, the news of the carnage started pouring in from countries like the USA, Italy, Spain,
France, Germany and Iran along with India on a day to day basis. After the first case of the
COVID-19 on 30 January 2020 in India, there become 1466 cases and 38 deaths as per official
data of the ministry of health and family welfare, India6.
Unfortunately, there has been no noticeable breakthrough in the management of this
disease to date and the patient is given a treatment based on his observable and diagnosable
symptoms. Although several attempts have been made in the research and development of the
diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines for this novel coronavirus7, there exists no
chemotherapeutic agent so far which has been shown unequivocally to be effective in treating
human diseases due to a minuscule virus. To combat this deadly COVID-19, a number of
conventional drugs8-10 like chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, etc. have been tried and
found with certain curative effect in vitro. However, the clinical drug response is not very

3

encouraging and toxicity remains an inevitable issue causing serious adverse effects11. This
prompted us to study the inhibition of COVID-19 protease by Indian herbal plants.
Because of the inherent side effects of the synthetic chemicals used in allopathic drugs, a
sizeable population has switched over to the traditional system of medicine (herbal medicine) for
their primary health care. Ayurveda, the age-old Indian system of medicine, is increasingly
becoming a sought after system to bank on. The ayurvedic treatment has become an alternative
to conventional medicines due to several reasons including easy availability, less or no side
effects and less cost. India has always been a rich reservoir of medicinal plants because of
several agro-climatic zones. Therefore, in the present work, we have chosen a multitude of
Indian herbal plants such as harsingar (Nyctanthes arbor-tristis), giloy (Tinospora cordifolia),
aloe vera (Aloe barbadensis miller), turmeric (Curcuma longa), neem (Azadirachta indica),
ashwagandha (Withania somnifera), ginger (Zingiber officinale), red onion (Allium cepa), tulsi
(Ocimum sanctum), cannabis (Cannabis sativa) and black pepper (Piper nigrum). The
pharmacological importance of these plants is well documented in the literature12-14. We have
selected a few extracted compounds of these herbal plants and evaluated their inhibition
properties against COVID-19 main protease in silico. We have obtained encouraging responses
from most of these medicinal plants in general. The inhibition potentials of harsingar, aloe vera
and giloy are particularly interesting. Therefore, we believe that this study should offer some
insights into the development of alternative drugs for this novel coronavirus.
Methodology
This study was performed by the SwissDock web server15,16, which incorporates an
automated in silico molecular docking procedure based on the EADock ESS docking algorithm.
To determine the inhibition properties of Indian medicinal plants against COVID-19 protease,
4

the potential target protein was retrieved from the RCSB protein data bank (PDB ID: 6LU7)
deposited in February 202017. The processed coordinates files for the ligands as well as COVID19 protease (6LU7) has been uploaded, and docking was carried out with the „Accurate‟
parameter option, which is considered to be the most extensive for the sampling of the binding
modes. The output clusters have been obtained after each docking runs and classified based on
the full fitness (FF) score by the SwissDock algorithm. A greater negative FF score suggests a
more favorable binding mode between ligand and receptor with a better fit. The visual graphics
of docking results have been generated by using the UCSF Chimera program18.
In addition, we have calculated the lipophilicity (log P) and aqueous solubility (log S)
using ALOGPS 2.1 program19, which is based on the electro-topological state indices and
associative neural network modeling20. These two parameters are very important for quantitative
structure-property relationship (QSPR) studies.
Results and Discussion
We have considered a total of 11 different varieties (species) of Indian medicinal plants.
Fig. 1 displays the molecular structures of a few (main) compounds extracted from these plants.
We have focused on mainly those compounds which have been found to possess anti-malarial,
anti-viral or other similar activities. Nictoflorin (C27H30O15), astragalin (C21H20O11), lupeol
(C25H26O4) are extracted from the leaves of harsingar. Berberine (C28H18NO4) and sitosterol
(C29H50O) are chemical constituents of the stem of the giloy. Aloenin (C19H22O10) and aloesin
(C19H22O9) are extracted from aloe vera leaves. Curcumin (C21H20O6) is extracted from the dried
ground rhizome of the turmeric. Nimbin (C30H36O9) is the first bitter compound isolated from the
oil of neem. Withanolide (C28H38O6) and withaferin A (C28H38O6) are steroidal constituents of
ashwagandha.

Fig. 1. Molecular structures of the compounds extracted from Indian herbal plants. Harsingar
(night jasmine or parijat) is distributed widely in sub-Himalayan regions, southwards to
Godavari and also found in Indian gardens as ornamental plant. Giloy (moonseed plant or
guduchi) is a large deciduous, extensively spreading climbing shrub found throughout India and
also in Bangladesh, Srilanka and China. Aloe vera (ghrit kumari) is a well known medicinal
plant with sharp pointed, lanced shaped and edged leaves having its origin in African content,
Turmeric (circumin or haldi), a traditional Chinese medicine, is commonly used species in Indian
subcontinent, not only for health but also for the preservation of food. Ashwagandha is known as
Indian winter cherry. Neem (margosa tree) also called as Indian lilac with its centre of origin in
southern and southeastern Asia, is regarded as „village dispensary‟ in India and also a religious
gift from nature. Red onion is a versatile vegetable, i.e., consumed fresh as well as in the form of
processed products. Tulsi is the one of the most religious and medicinal plant in India and grown
throughout the country from Andaman and Nicobar island to the Himalayas. Cannabis is a plant
of psychoactive drug and black pepper is a kind of household species used in India.
6

Gingerol (C17H26O4) and shogaol (C17H24O3) are two constituents of pungent ketones,
which result in the strong aroma of ginger. Quercetin (C15H10O7) is the main flavonoid content of
(red) onion. Ursolic acid (C30H48O3) and apigenin (C15H10O5) are chemical constituents of tulsi
leaves. Cannabidiol (C21H30O2) major constituent of cannabis extracts and is devoid of the
typical psychological effects of cannabis in humans. Piperine (C17H19NO3) is a naturally
occurring alkaloid, was isolated from the plants of both the black and white pepper grains.
In order to compare the biological activity and pharmacological behavior of the extracted
compounds, we have evaluated their log P as well as log S values and listed in Table 1. Log P
measures the hydrophilicity of a compound. The compounds having high log P values show poor
absorption or low permeability. One can note that the log P values of most of these compounds
lie in the range 2.64-4.95. These values indicate that the compounds can easily diffuse across the
cell membranes due to their high organic (lipid) permeability. However, lupeol, sitosterol, ursolic
acid and cannabidiol have log P in the range 5.12-7.27 (exceeding to 5) and therefore, they
possess high hydrophobicity and poor absorption. On the contrary, nictoflorin, astragalin,
aloenin, aloesin and quercetin possess high absorption due to their log P in the range 0.05-1.81.
Log S represents the aqueous solubility of the compound. It is an important factor, associated
with the bioavailability of compounds. Most of these compounds have log S values higher than 5, except lupeol, sitosterol and ursolic acid. Note that the log S values of more than 85% of
compounds (drugs) fall in the range between -1 and -5

21

. This is consistent with their log P

values as poor solubility implies poor absorption and hence, bioavailability. Thus, log P along
with log S values of these compounds confirmed their permeability across cell membranes. In
particular, the nictoflorin, astragalin, aloenin, aloesin and quercetin seem to be more biologically
potent. These parameters are also associated with their interaction with receptors.

The molecular docking studies explore the interaction mechanism between ligands and
receptors. The interactions between a ligand and receptor play a crucial role in the field of drug
discovery. The molecular docking calculations have been performed as blind, i.e., covered the
entire protein surface, not any specific region of the protein as the binding pocket in order to
avoid sampling bias. The docking parameters such as binding affinity, FF score, and H-bond,
bond-length along with amino acids (residue) found in the binding site pockets (active site) of
6LU7 are listed in Table 1. The results of molecular docking are displayed in Fig. 2.
The binding affinity (∆G) of (drug) compounds depends on the type of bonding (H-bond)
that occurs with the active site of the protein. The results of docking show that the extracts of
harsingar, nictoflorin, astragalin and lupeol form H-bond of bond lengths 2.311 Å, 2.197 Å and
2.027 Å with the glycine (GLY-143), phenylalanine (PHE-140) and threonine (THR-26)
respectively. The compounds of aloe vera, aloenin forms H-bond (bond length = 2.151 Å) with
phenylalanine (PHE-140) and aloesin forms two H-bonds with GLY-143 (bond length = 2.016
Å) and glutamate (GLU-166) with bond length = 2.297 Å. The constituents of giloy, berberine
forms two H-bonds with the same amino acid GLY-143 having bond lengths of 2.540 Å and
2.577 Å, whereas sitosterol forms H-bond with PHE-166 of bond length 2.080 Å. The
compounds of turmeric and neem, curcumin and nimbin form H-bonds with the same amino acid
GLY-143 of bond lengths 2.243 Å and 2.161 Å, respectively. The derivatives of ashwagandha,
withanolide forms two H-bonds with the GLU-166 (bond length = 1.991 Å and 2.110 Å) and
withaferin A forms H-bond with GLY-143 of bond length 2.577 Å. The compounds of ginger,
gingerol forms H-bond with THR-190 (bond length = 2.026 Å) and shogaol forms three Hbonds, one with GLY-143 (bond length = 2.016 Å) and two with the THR-26 and THR-24
having bond lengths 2.398 Å and 2.345 Å, respectively.

and apigenin form H-bonds with the GLY-143 (bond length = 2.330 Å) and the THR-26 (bond
length = 1.994 Å), respectively. The constituent of cannabis, cannabidiol forms H-bond with the
GLY-143 (bond length = 2.325 Å), a non-polar amino acid.

Fig. 3. Binding affinity plot of Indian herbal plants and a few drugs for comparison of inhibition
potential against COVID-19 protease.

Thus, our docking analyses suggest that the COVID-19 protease (6LU7) can be inhibited
by the extracts of Indian herbal plants. Based on the binding affinity, the inhibition potential of
these plants (based on their extracts) can be ranked as; harsingar > aloe vera > giloy > turmeric >
neem > ashwagandha > red onion > tulsi > cannabis > black pepper. The highest inhibition
potentials are obtained for the extracts of harsingar and aloe vera, namely nictoflorin (∆G = 11

9.18) and aloenin (∆G = -9.13), respectively. This also provides us an opportunity to compare the
∆G value of the compounds extracted from other plants. Fig. 3 plots the binding affinities of
these compounds, along with those of a few previously reported inhibitors such as remdesivir,
chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. Considering hydroxychloroquine as a reference, we note
that the inhibition potentials of the extracts of harsingar, aloe vera and giloy are very
encouraging. The extracts of turmeric, neem, ashwagandha and ginger have larger inhibition
potentials than that of chloroquine. The compounds extracted from other plants also possess
certain inhibition properties against COVID-19 protease.
Conclusions and Perspectives
We have performed an in silico study on the inhibition of COVID-19 protease by the
extracts of Indian herbal plants. We noticed that all these plants possess inhibition properties to a
certain extent. Based on the binding affinity as well as log P and log S values, harsingar, aloe
vera and giloy appear as the most powerful inhibitors among the eleven plants considered here.
Other potential inhibitors of COVID-19 protease include turmeric, neem, ashwagandha and
ginger. The inhibition potentials of all these plant extracts are found to be larger than those of
chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. These two anti-malarial drug compounds are already
reported to inhibit COVID-19 protease in vitro. Due to inherent toxicity and side-effects,
however, they are not approved by most of the countries. Therefore, our findings become very
interesting towards the development of alternative (herbal) medicines having no apparent sideeffects. We expect prompt actions in this direction to combat with the COVID-19.
