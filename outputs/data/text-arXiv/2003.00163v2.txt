Abstract
Motivation: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a new type of coronavirus has
been emerging from China and led to thousands of death globally since December 2019. Despite
many groups have engaged in studying the newly emerged virus and searching for the treatment of
COVID-19, the understanding of the COVID-19 target-ligand interactions represents a key challenge.
Herein, we introduce COVID-19 Docking Server, a web server that predicts the binding modes
between COVID-19 targets and the ligands including small molecules, peptides and antibodies.
Results: Structures of proteins involved in the virus life cycle were collected or constructed based on
the homologs of coronavirus, and prepared ready for docking. The meta platform provides a free and
interactive tool for the prediction of COVID-19 target-ligand interactions and following drug discovery
for COVID-19.

Introduction

According the situation report from World Health Organization (WHO),
7,039,918 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and 404,396
deaths have been reported all around the world till June 9th, 2020. The
first COVID-19 case was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province of
China in December 2019. The pathogen caused the disease was soon
identified as a novel coronavirus, which belongs to the genus

Betacoronavirus and is closely related to severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) with 89.1% nucleotide similarity in
the viral genome (Jiang, et al., 2020; Wu, et al., 2020). Later on, it was
named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) by the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses.
Tremendous efforts have been done to study the newly emerged virus
and find potent drugs for clinical usage. Wang et. al from Wuhan
Institute of Virology screened some of the FDA approved anti-virus or
anti-infection drugs and found that remdesivir and chloroquine could

Implementation

The COVID-19 Docking Server web interface is written in PHP and
HTML, and JSMol (http://jmol.sourceforge.net/) is used for molecular
visualization on the results pages. Totally, 27 targets essential in virus
life cycle are prepared and available for docking on the website
(Supplementary Information, Fig. S1 and S2), including spike protein,

membrane protein, envelop small membrane protein, nucleocapsid
protein, main protease, papain-like protease, nsp3 (207-379), RNA
dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, nsp12/7/8 complex) , nsp7, nsp8,
nsp12, helicase, nsp14, nsp15 (endoribonuclease), nsp10, nsp16,
nsp16/10 (2'-O-methyltransferase), nsp1, nsp2, nsp4, nsp6, nsp9,
ORF3A, ORF6, ORF7A, ORF8, ORF10. The flow chart of the COVID19 Docking Server is shown in Fig. S3.
For small molecule docking, Autodock Vina (Trott and Olson, 2010)
is used as docking engine. Open Babel was used for format
transformation or 3D coordinate generation for the uploaded files
(O'Boyle, et al., 2011). For experimental complex structures, the docking
box was defined on the center of native ligand with 30Å×30Å×30Å in
length to include the residues of entire cavity. For homology modeled
structures, it is defined according to the information of active sites or
binding sites of its homologs of SARS-CoV (detailed in Supplementary
Information). All the parameters are set as default and we provide
exhaustiveness value options for the user to choose the docking
precision. Except for Autodock Vina score, we also provide an
alternative scoring function as complement to evaluate the binding
affinities for small molecules (Li, et al., 2016).
For peptide and antibody docking, CoDockPP (Kong, et al., 2019) is
used as docking engine. CoDockPP program provides a multistage FFTbased strategy for both global docking and site-specific docking. An
angle interval of 15º is used for rotational sampling, and a spacing of 1.2
Å is adopted for fast Fourier transform (FFT) translational search.
Finally, the top binding modes are clustered with ligand root mean
square deviations (L_RMSD) cutoff of 3.0 Å in global docking and 2.0
Å in site-specific docking.

effectively inhibit the virus in cell based assay with EC50 of 0.77 and
1.13 μM, respectively (Wang, et al., 2020). Several clinical trials are
ongoing for the treatment of COVID-19. However, no drug or vaccine
has yet been approved.
In a very short time, the structures of functional proteins essential for
SARS-CoV-2 were achieved by groups in China, including the main
protease and spike protein in binding with angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2). Until May 20, totally 181 structures were released in
the Protein Data Bank, which related to 11 different kinds of SARSCoV-2 proteins. Although the structures of other proteins remain
unknown, the high amino acid identity between SARS-CoV-2 and
SARS-CoV (77.2%) enables that it is possible to establish the homology
modeled structures of SARS-CoV-2 based on the protein structures of
SARS-CoV with high confidence. I-TASSER group provided 24 high
quality predicted structures of SARS-CoV-2 to download (Zhang, et al.,
2020). Based on the these structure information, a web-server, COVID19 Docking Server, was constructed to facilitate people to evaluate the
binding modes and binding affinities between the targets and small
molecules, peptides as well as antibodies. By launching the server, we
hope to provide a free and easy to use tool for people who is interested in
drug discovery against COVID-19.

Usage

3.1 Usage of small molecule docking

3.2 Usage of peptide or antibody docking
Similar to small molecule docking, the user needs to choose the COVID19 protein target and uploads ligand protein (peptide or antibody) in
strict pdb format for peptide or antibody docking. The default mode is
globe docking and the user also could input residues for site specific
docking. If the user defined constraint residues for the receptor and
ligand simultaneously, then he needs to choose the constraint
type: ambiguous constraints
or multiple constraints.
When
the
“ambiguous constraints” is selected, the conformations are retained with
at least one selected residue on the interface. When the “multiple
constraints” is selected, the conformations are retained with both of the
residues on the interface. We use the post-fusion state of S2 segment of
spike protein as an example for peptide docking, and RBD of spike
protein as an example for antibody docking. The 5-helices structure from
6LXT was used as receptor and the other helix was used as ligand
peptide (Xia, et al., 2020). By using the default global searching, the
L_RMSD for Top 1 binding mode was 0.93 Å (Fig. 1C). The antibody
structure from 7BZ5 (Wu, et al., 2020) were extracted and docked to
RBD by using global searching option. And the L_RMSD for Top 1
binding mode was 1.14 Å (Fig. 1D).
To evaluation the docking protocols, the re-dock experiments were
conducted for those targets with experimental complex structure
available. Most of the complex structures were reproduced by using the
docking procedure on the web server (Table S1 & S2 in Supplementary
Information). Since online on March 5, 2020, the COVID-19 server has
completed > 7,000 jobs from about 400 unique users in three months. As
the continuously increasing infections of SARS-CoV-2 in a number of
countries all around the world, more researchers and groups are involved
in the study of this virus and the demand of prediction for target-ligand
complex structures may increase accordingly.

For each job of small molecule docking, the user can choose one of the
COVID-19 targets. The small molecules should be uploaded in
strict smi, mol2 or sdf formats. Two computational types are provided
with the default computational type as “Docking” (D) to dock single
small molecule to the target, and the other option “Batch Docking” (B)
to dock a number of small molecules to the target. The top 10 models are
visualized in 3D by JSmol and the user can view and download the
docking results from the result page. Here, we take RdRp and its
inhibitor triphosphate form of remdesivir as an example for small
molecule docking (Yin, et al., 2020). The “Docking” mode was selected
and the mol2 format of its inhibitor in PDB 7BV2 was uploaded as
ligand. The predicted binding energy of Top 1 ranked binding mode was
-8.3 kcal/mol, and the L_RMSD was 1.97 Å. As shown in Fig. 1A, the
best binding mode of the inhibitor is very similar to the native ligand in
the experimental structure. In addition, if users have a set of small
molecules and want to explore the changes in predicted binding affinity
with various chemical substitutions, they can use batch docking mode as
shown in Fig. 1B.

An online meta server, COVID-19 Docking Server, was constructed to
predict the binding modes between the targets of COVID-19 and its
potential ligands by implement of Autodock Vina and CoDockPP as
docking engines. The server provides a user-friendly interface and
binding mode visualization for the results, which makes it a useful tool
for drug discovery of COVID-19.
