ABSTRACT To curb the spread of COVID-19, many governments around the world have implemented
tiered lockdowns with varying degrees of stringency. Lockdown levels are typically increased when the
disease spreads and reduced when the disease abates. A predictive control approach is used to develop
optimized lockdown strategies for curbing the spread of COVID-19. The strategies are then applied to
South African data. The South African case is of interest as the South African government has defined
five distinct levels of lockdown, which serves as a discrete control input. An epidemiological model for the
spread of COVID-19 in South Africa was previously developed, and is used in conjunction with a hybrid
model predictive controller to optimize lockdown management under different policy scenarios. Scenarios
considered include how to flatten the curve to a level that the healthcare system can cope with, how to
balance lives and livelihoods, and what impact the compliance of the population to the lockdown measures
has on the spread of COVID-19. The main purpose of this paper is to show what the optimal lockdown level
should be given the policy that is in place, as determined by the closed-loop feedback controller.

I. INTRODUCTION

A novel coronavirus, believed to be of zoonotic origin,
emerged in Wuhan, China towards the end of 2019. This
virus, which was subsequently named SARS-CoV-2 and the
disease it causes COVID-19 [1], has since spread around the
world. The WHO characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic on
11 March 2020 [2]. The COVID-19 pandemic first took hold
in regions of the world that share high volumes of air traffic
with China [3]. The importance of “flattening the curve”, i.e.
reducing the number of COVID-19 infected patients needing
critical care to be below the number of available beds in
intensive care units or appropriately equipped field hospitals,
soon became evident [4].
The South African National Institute for Communicable
Diseases confirmed the first COVID-19 case in South Africa
on 5 March 2020. Having learnt from elsewhere about the
importance of “flattening the curve”, the South African Government was quick to place the country under strict lockdown
(what later became known as lockdown level 5) on 27 March
VOLUME xx, 2020

2020 after only 1,170 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 1
related death [5].
The early strict lockdown measures in South Africa have
been successful from an epidemiological point of view, but
great harm was done to an economy that was already weak
before the COVID-19 pandemic started [6]. As a result, significant pressure was applied to relax the lockdown measures
even though the number of infectious individuals was still
growing exponentially [7].
The South African government has formulated five lockdown levels with varying degrees of strictness with regards to
the measures imposed in order to systematically restore economic activity. There is thus significant interest in determining the epidemiological impact of the lockdown levels [8].
Towards this end, an epidemiological model was developed
for South Africa in [9], and a predictive control approach to
managing lockdown levels is presented in this work.
One policy approach to managing lockdown levels may be
to flatten the curve so as not to overwhelm the healthcare

system. Some infected individuals need hospitalization and
intensive care - there are studies that show that roughly 5 %
of confirmed infectious cases require admission to intensive
care units (ICUs) [10]. As more and more individuals are
exposed and infected, healthcare systems can easily become
overwhelmed, especially in developing countries with fragile
and underdeveloped healthcare systems [11]. The amount of
ICU beds available can therefore serve as a high limit for the
number of infected individuals needing intensive care [4].
The lockdowns that enforce social distancing however
have a huge economic impact [12]. Considering the cumulative impact of lockdown on the economy is therefore
also relevant. Another policy approach may therefore be
to not impose strict lockdown measures for too long, and
to potentially reduce the lockdown level even though the
healthcare capacity may be exceeded. This policy is known
as “balancing lives and livelihoods” (see [13]).
The aim of this paper is to illustrate the optimal implementation of these policy choices through the use of a model
predictive control approach [14]. Lockdown levels are represented as integer values, whereas the SEIQRDP model used
is continuous and dynamic. Dynamic systems that contain
continuous and discrete state/input variables are known as
hybrid systems [15], and therefore a hybrid model predictive
control (HMPC) approach is required.
Solving the resulting constrained optimization problem is
known as mixed integer programming. These problems are
NP-hard (non-deterministic polynomial-time) and even to
test if a feasible solution improves on the best solution to
date is an NP problem [15]. Genetic algorithms (see e.g. [16])
have been found in the past to be suitable for solving HMPC
problems, and are therefore used in this work (see e.g. [17],
[18]).
Genetic algorithms (GAs) are founded on the principles of
natural selection and population genetics [16]. A GA solves
the optimization problem in a derivative-free manner using
a population of potential solutions that are evolved over
generations to produce better solutions. Each individual in
the population is assigned a fitness value that determines
how well it solves the problem and hence how likely it is to
propagate its characteristics to successive populations. A GA
does not mathematically guarantee optimality, but provides a
feasible solution in an appropriate time frame. Given the limited number of possible control moves, constraint functions,
and population size used here, optimality is however likely.
Other approaches to solving HMPC problems are also
possible, as illustrated in e.g. [19].
Once the control move is calculated, some time is required
for the country to prepare for the new lockdown level. To
achieve this the lockdown level to be implemented is calculated some time in advance. A fixed delay between the
control move calculation and implementation is not a typical
HMPC requirement. It is however required in this instance
for practical implementation of the appropriate lockdown
level.
Other approaches to feedback control of COVID-19 in
2

various forms exist in literature. [20] and [21] show how
implementation of social distancing measures in an “on-off”
fashion might be used to stem the spread of the virus. This
might be effective in limiting the spread, but an “on-off”
approach to lockdown is difficult to implement practically
and after a number of iterations the population may well not
wish to comply any longer. [22] shows an optimal control
strategy to limit deaths in the United States through implementation of social distancing measures. [23] presents a
robust MPC approach to calculating optimal social distancing
measures for Germany. The degree of social distancing is
restricted to only change once a week, but how a real-valued
degree of social distancing is practically achieved is less
straightforward. [23] notes that adaptive feedback strategies
are required to reliably contain the COVID-19 outbreak. [4]
shows an “on-off” approach as well as real-valued social
distancing measures to control the number of patients requiring intensive care to below the available capacity. All
of the controllers referenced in this paragraph also operate
under a single policy scenario, as opposed to the framework
discussed in this work that deals with multiple scenarios.
In this work, predictive control is used to implement various policy scenarios by varying the lockdown level, where
each level has its own well-defined set of regulations. How
the control action is practically implemented is therefore
well determined. The novelty of the paper is therefore the
implementation of an HMPC to control under different policy
scenarios within a context where the practical implementation of the control output is well defined.
An overview of the epidemiological model used in this
work is given in Section II along with the parameters for the
South African case. The controller design for different policy
scenarios is presented in Section III, the results and discussion in Section IV, and finally the conclusion in Section VI.
II. EPIDEMIOLOGICAL MODEL DEVELOPMENT

It is noted in [24] that accurate epidemiological models are
indispensable for planning and decision making, such as the
feedback control described in this work.
Even though the model development is not the main aim of
this paper, a model is required for the implemented HMPC.
This section is dedicated to showing the model development,
before the main contributions of this paper, i.e. that of controller design and simulation, as are discussed in sections III
and IV.
A. SEIQRDP MODEL

The SEIQRDP model is a generalized compartmental epidemiological model with 7 states. The model was proposed
by [25] and is an adaptation of the classical SEIR model (see
e.g. [26]). The model states and model parameters that drive
transitions between them are shown in Fig. 1. The colours
used for Q, R, and D correspond to what is used in the results
figures later in the article. The states are described as:
• S - Portion of the population still susceptible to getting
infected,

The model equations are given as:

where N is the total population size, α is the rate at which the
population becomes insusceptible (in general either through
vaccinations or medication). At the time of writing there
is no vaccine that will allow an individual to transfer from
the susceptible to insusceptible portion of the population
[27]. Consequently α should be considered to be close to
zero. β(t) is the (possibly time dependent) transmission rate
parameter, γ = [Nlat ]−1 is the inverse of the average length
of the latency period before a person becomes infectious (in
days), δ = [Ninf ]−1 is the inverse of the number of days that
a person stays infectious without yet being diagnosed, λ(t)
is the recovery rate, and κ(t) is the mortality rate. Both λ(t)
and κ(t) are potentially functions of time, and [25] notes that
VOLUME xx, 2020

λ(t) gradually increases with time while κ(t) decreases with
time. As such, the functions shown in (8) and (9) are used to
model λ(t) and κ(t). In (8) it is set that λ1 ≥ λ2 such that
λ(t) ≥ 0.

λ(t) = λ1 − λ2 exp(−λ3 t)

(8)

κ(t) = κ1 exp(−κ2 t).

(9)

A decreasing κ-value is observed in the data of various
countries (see e.g. [25], or the data in [5] for South Africa or
Italy). Even though κ → 0 as t → ∞, κ > 0 over the horizon
where predictions are made.
β is often considered to be constant, but is dependent on
interventions like social distancing, restrictions on travel, and
other lockdown measures [28]. This implies that β may also
be time dependent as these interventions change over time. In
cases where international and even regional travel is limited,
the number of susceptible individuals one may encounter can
only decrease over time. This, coupled with the fact that given
a constant δ, the effective reproduction number (shown in
(12)) can only reduce to below 1 if β decreases. This lead
[9] to find that β(t) can effectively be modelled using a
decreasing function of time of the form
β(t) = β1 + β2 exp(−β3 t).

(10)

This function describing β might not be applicable for
all countries under all circumstances, but for the countries
considered in [9] it seems reasonable.
The basic reproduction number, R0 , which is the expected
number of cases directly generated by one case in the population, is given by [25] as
R0 =

β
T
(1 − α) ,
δ

(11)

where T is the number of days. When α ≈ 0, and β is a
function of time, this can be simplified as
R0 ≈

β(0)
.
δ

(12)

Interventions such as social distancing, restrictions on
population movement, and wearing of masks (among others)
can reduce the effective reproduction number mainly through
reducing the effective number of contacts per person. This is
why the imposition of varying lockdown levels may be used
as a control handle to effect policy decisions.
Even though compartmental models depend on accurate
parameter values that may be time-variant, the model structure is flexible enough to produce relatively accurate descriptions of the spread of the virus for various countries as shown
in [9]. It is however emphasized that predictions are sensitive
to some of the parameter values, and as such need to be taken
with caution during the early stages of the epidemic.

B. PARAMETER ESTIMATION FOR SOUTH AFRICA
1

Data are obtained from The Humanitarian Data Exchange ,
as compiled by the Johns Hopkins University Center for
Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CCSE) from various
sources. The data include the number of confirmed infectious
cases, recovered cases, and deceased cases per day from
January 2020.
In order to get a sense of the applicability of the model and
what the parameter values should be, parameter estimations
were first carried out to determine SEIQRDP models for
Germany, Italy, and South Korea in [9]. These countries were
selected as their outbreaks started earlier than that of South
Africa, and consequently their parameter estimation should
be more accurate. They have also had differing approaches
under different circumstances, which means that the different
parameters obtained should illustrate how the model behaves.
Epidemiological considerations largely drove the constraints
on parameter values used in the South African model. Parameter values obtained for β from the models for other
countries however guided the constraints on each parameter
in the South African case.
When the number of cases is very low, community transmissions do not drive the spread which makes accurate modelling difficult. As such, the data taken for fitting is from 18
April 2020. The initial “level 5” lockdown model derived in
[9] used data up to 8 May 2020. Here the model is re-fit using
data up to 16 August 2020. The South African government
relaxed the lockdown to level 4 on 1 May 2020 and to level 3
on 1 June 2020.
To accommodate potentially differing β-values for different lockdown levels, the effective β-value is obtained using:
β ∗ (t) = βm (l) · β(t)

(13)

where βm (l) is the β-multiplier as a function of the
lockdown level (l). This achieves a varying contact rate
without varying the time dynamics of β(t) using a levelbased multiplier.
Modelling can therefore estimate the β-values for level 5
(βm (5)), level 4 (βm (4)), and level 3 (βm (3)). The fit of
the model to the data is shown in Fig. 2 and the estimated
parameter values are shown in Table 1.
βm (1) and βm (2) still need to be determined. To get a
sense of how the contact rate may have changed during
different lockdown levels, the Google mobility data for South
Africa (obtained from [29]) are considered. The mobility
data list the relative percentage change in time spent at
different location types, based on the median value for the
period between 3 January and 6 February 2020. The average
difference for all non-residential location types is used to
determine an average overall indication of much time people
are spending outside of their homes, and in potential contact
with others. The index is shown in Fig. 3. If βm (1) is considered to correspond to the period before level 5 lockdown is

implemented, then βm (2) can be calculated such that it lies
partway between βm (1) and βm (3).
The values for βm (l) are calculated as such and the final
β-multiplier values are shown in Table 2. The percentage
change in β-multiplier value from level 1 is also shown in
Fig. 3. It can be seen from Fig. 3 that the β-multiplier values
obtained seem reasonable when compared to mobility data,
and that compliance to lockdown measures does decrease
over time as the mobility tends to increase while the lockdown level remains constant.
One criticism of deterministic epidemiological models
(see e.g. [30]) is that if R0 < 1 there will only be a small
outbreak, and if R0 > 1 there will be a major outbreak.
This is because the model assumes that the community is
homogeneous and that individuals mix uniformly. In reality
however individuals will not mix uniformly, especially if
regional travel is prohibited. This means that the effective
reproduction number does decrease over time in practice,
as modelled in [9]. Varying β however leads to large model
sensitivity, meaning that the total number of cases predicted
may be higher than what occurs in practice. The varying β
version of the model is however still useful to illustrate the
effect of policy decisions on the relative number of cases
recorded.
III. CONTROLLER DESIGN

An HMPC controller using a GA to solve for the optimal
control action (similar to [18]) is implemented to determine
optimal lockdown levels for different policy scenarios. The
controlled variable is the active number of confirmed infectious cases: Q as given by (4).
The control problem is formulated as:

VOLUME xx, 2020

A flattening the curve policy is one where lockdown is
implemented in order to ensure that the healthcare system
is not overwhelmed by keeping the maximum number of
cases requiring intensive care below the number of ICU beds
available [31]. In South Africa the number of ICU beds
available for COVID-19 patients was stated in [32] to be
7,188. Using the number of beds for the country as a whole
may be somewhat crude. Regional values might be preferred,
but as the model is for the country as a whole the high limit
is considered in that fashion as well.
[10] found that roughly 5 % of confirmed infectious cases
required admission to ICU. With 7,188 ICU beds available
for COVID-19 patients, this implies that the active confirmed
infectious case number should remain below 143,760.
The objective function used to implement this policy
penalizes an output (confirmed infectious cases Q) above
the number of ICU bed imposed high limit as well as the
magnitude of the control move (the lockdown level). This
ensures that the output value will tend to remain below the
high limit without setting the lockdown level needlessly high.
The objective function is stated as:

Year-on-year BETI decrease

The sampling period ∆T = 1 day (which was found to
produce a sufficient resolution for progressing the simulation
numerically), Np = 280 (which is a long enough horizon
to capture the dynamics of the spread of the virus, as shown
by the modelling results of [9]), and Nc = 3 (which is an
often used control horizon value that provides a good middle
ground between controller aggressiveness and resolution to
solve the control problem, see e.g. [33]); Nc is however
implemented using a blocking vector [33] of Nb = [7, 7, 7]
implying that the lockdown level may only change at most
every 7 days (1 week).

B. BALANCING LIVES AND LIVELIHOODS POLICY

When implementing the “flattening the curve” policy the
lockdown might end up being extremely long, which has an
economic impact in itself. Preventing economic activity and
therefore preventing certain people from earning a living will
likely increase poverty, which in itself leads to life years lost.
As such the cumulative economic impact of lockdown should
also be considered, which is done by adapting the objective
function to be:
J(·) =

X
i=1

ksi k2Ws +

NX
c −1

kui k2Wu + EC,k +

i=0

NX
c −1

kEi k2WE

(17)
where EC,k is the cumulative economic impact of lockdown
levels that have already been implemented, Ei is the marginal
economic impact of lockdown as implemented over the control horizon (as is ultimately reported in Table 3), and WE is
the weight (scalar) relating to the economic impact. At each
simulation step the cumulative economic impact is increased
as:
EC,k+1 = EC,k + WE · Ei .

(18)

For Ei the quantified relative economic impact per lockdown level is required. One may wish to consider something
like the gross domestic product (GDP) or the value add of the
industries that may operate during each lockdown level as in
[6]. GDP figures are often only reported at least one quarter
after the fact which does not help in this case. The percentage
of each industry that will be affected per lockdown level is
not known directly and estimating these may add too much
uncertainty. A more frequently updated indicator, which is
used here instead, is the BankservAfrica Economic Transactions Index (BETI) which show the volumes and values of
inter-bank transfers [34]. BankservAfrica states that BETI is
a leading indicator for the South African GDP – it correlates
well with GDP figures while appearing a quarter earlier.
There is however some seasonality connected to economic
transaction volumes, and as such year-on-year values are
used to gauge the impact of lockdown levels. The relative
economic impact for level 1, 3, 4, and 5 are determined using
the year-on-year decrease in the BETI value for March to
June 2020. The value for levels 2 is interpolated from the
other levels. The values and corresponding months are shown

in Table 3 as well as Fig. 4 to highlight the interpolation
results.
The relative economic impact values per level are normalized to be between 0 and 1. As they are weighted in
(17) their relative values are important, and because they are
included in a 2-norm calculation the absolute values need to
be monotonically increasing.
This treatment of the economic impact may be somewhat
simplistic, but economic data in the public domain are unfortunately limited or largely delayed. This approach does
quantify the relative impact of different lockdown levels,
which should be sufficient for the policy optimization.
This type of policy may reduce lockdown levels to curb
economic losses, even though infection rates may be considered to be unacceptably high. This scenario is presently
happening in various countries in the developing world [35].
C. COMPLIANCE TO LOCKDOWN REGULATIONS

Some residents cannot or will not endure living under continual lockdown regulations (for various reasons). [36] notes
that 230,000 cases have been opened against South African
residents for violating lockdown rules by 22 May 2020. A
significant proportion of these cases were opened in the last
couple of weeks before the [36] article was written, showing
that violations become more prevalent over time. Compliance
to lockdown regulations can therefore be considered as an
unmeasured disturbance that impact on the parameters of the
SEIQRDP model.
In this scenario (17) is still minimized, but the compliance
disturbance is introduced as a multiplicative disturbance on
the expected number of contacts between people by altering
the value of β; (13) is altered to produce:
β ∗ (t) = (βm (1) · (1 − d) + βm (l) · d) · β(t)

lockdown level. When d = 1 the intended β-value for the
associated lockdown level is obtained as in (13). When d =
0 the β-value obtained is as if lockdown level 1 had been
implemented.
D. CONTROL MOVE CONSTRAINT CONSIDERATIONS

There is a very delicate balance to be maintained when
implementing policy decisions. Due regard has to be given to
the effect that policies may have on the citizens of the country
concerned. If not, compliance may reduce and disgruntled
citizens may deliberately violate regulations or fail to keep
track of which lockdown level is currently in force.
To prevent this scenario, a dynamic constraint is placed on
the controller which ensures that from the present lockdown
level to the end of the control horizon, the control moves must
be monotonically increasing or monotonically decreasing.
This constraint is enforced as:
(

∆[uk−1 ,uk ,...,uk+Nc −1 ]
∆t
∆[uk−1 ,uk ,...,uk+Nc −1 ]
∆t

≥0
∀ ui , i ∈ [k−1, k+Nc −1].
≤0
(20)
This prevents excessive fluctuations of the lockdown level
that the controller may otherwise seek to exploit in order to
minimize the objective function. Excessive fluctuations of the
lockdown levels also make it difficult to enforce and regulate
the lockdown rules on a national scale as time is needed to
implement any policy changes.
Once the control move (lockdown level) has been calculated, some time is needed for the nation to prepare to
implement that lockdown level. Here, 1 week (7 days) of
preparation time is provided. Given the blocking vector of
Nb = [7, 7, 7], this is practically achieved by fixing the first
element of the control vector to the previously calculated
value and then using the second element as the control
move to be implemented. This is contrary to regular receding
horizon control where the first element is implemented.
This implementation approach is no different from the
regular receding horizon approach in the absence of modelplant mismatch and/or disturbances. No difference should
therefore be expected for the initial flattening the curve and
balancing lives and livelihoods policy simulations. Once the
compliance disturbance is introduced however this implementation does however have some impact, given that the
level of compliance when the control move is calculated
may not be the same as the level of compliance when it is
implemented.

E. GA OPTIMIZATION IMPLEMENTATION

The controller design discussed in this section relies on a
solver that can solve an objective function based on a hybrid
model which contains continuous time dynamics, time varying model parameters, discontinuities in the form of discrete
lockdown levels, and dynamic non-linear constraints.
The GA is a solver that has shown good results with
such mixed integer models, non-linearities and complex nonlinear constraint functions, and convergence to a global minimum in the presence of many local minima [17], [37]. It has
also been successfully used as a solver for HMPC [17], [18].
Owing to these advantages a GA is used in this study.
The Matlab ga function in the Global Optimization Toolbox was used to implement the GA. The Matlab ga function
uses a set of solutions, called the population, that are calculated to minimize a fitness function. With each iteration in the
GA a new generation is calculated from the old population
through a mutation function (while always adhering to the
upper and lower bounds as well as the inequality, equality,
and non-linear constraints). The mutation function keeps
the variables in the population that minimized the fitness
function the most, and also defines new values according to
a stochastic function. The GA is terminated when the fitness
function value, fitness tolerance (i.e. the change in the fitness
function value between iterations), or the maximum number
of generations is exceeded [38].
In this work the HMPC problem solves within approximately 5 seconds on a standard computing platform. As a
solution is only required once a day, the execution time is
not an issue. Therefore the fitness tolerance, fitness limit,
population size and maximum number of generations were
left as default in the Matlab ga function. It is important to
note that these parameters may be altered when the controller
execution time needs to be reduced. The ga function was set
up using the following options and parameters:
•
•
•
•

The fitness function is the objective function policy in
(15) or (17).
The lower bound (LB) is the hard low limit for the three
control moves, which is [uk−1 , 1, 1].
The upper bound (UB) is the hard high limit for the three
control moves, which is [uk−1 , 5, 5].
The non-linear constraint function is implemented using
(20).

parameters and result metrics for each scenario are shown
in Table 4. The metrics shown are the maximum number
of active confirmed infectious cases, i.e. the maximum of
Q, the number of days (from the start of the simulation on
18 April 2020) before the lockdown level is raised above
1, the number of days after the lockdown level has been
raised above 1 until it is returned to 1, and the number of
days in each lockdown level. The number of days in level
1 is only taken up to the point where the lockdown is finally
reduced back to level 1. The number of days before lockdown
is implemented is an important metric to consider as it will
improve the nation’s readiness for lockdown and in turn
improve long term compliance.
A. FLATTENING THE CURVE POLICY

The simulation result for the flattening the curve policy
scenario described in Section III-A is shown in Fig. 5.
From Fig. 5 it is visible that implementing lockdown at
the correct time and to the correct level allows the active
number of confirmed infectious cases to hardly violate the
ICU capacity limit. The lockdown is however implemented
relatively early (37 days after the start of the simulation on
18 April 2020) and lasts relatively long (77 days).
B. BALANCING LIVES AND LIVELIHOODS POLICY

The lockdown scenario illustrated in Fig. 5 will likely have
devastating effects on a South African economy that was
already fragile before the onset of COVID-19. The result
for the balancing lives and livelihodds policy, as described
in Section III-B, is shown in Fig. 6. In this case lockdown
is implemented up to level 2 and shortly after to level 5
to try and curb the spread of the virus, moving to level 5
somewhat later than in the flattening the curve scenario to
alleviate some of the economic impact of lockdown. After a
couple of weeks on level 5 the cumulative economic impact

increases so much that the level is reduced in spite of the
ICU capacity limit being exceeded. The dotted line in the top
panel of Fig. 6 shows the cumulative economic impact of the
lockdown that has already been implemented (as per (18)),
weighted to fit onto the same scale as Q. The cumulative
economic impact is already weighted (WE in (18)) meaning
the original units become irrelevant. The dotted line in Fig. 6)
is therefore shown without any units, but the shape over time
is informative. It is clear that as the economic impact grows,
the ICU limit is allowed to be violated further in order to
reduce the lockdown level and curb economic losses.
This policy balances lives and livelihoods by delaying
the start of lockdown level 5 with a week and reducing the
total time in level 5 by two weeks. The peak number in
Fig. 6 of active confirmed infectious cases is much higher
than that of Fig. 5. The advantage of this policy however is
that the peak in the maximum number of cases is delayed
as opposed to having no policy in place. Besides winning
time, this scenario also provides an estimate of the additional
number of COVID-19 specific intensive care beds required,
something that healthcare authorities can use to plan their
response.
This implies that if the economic impact of each level
of lockdown can be quantified beforehand, temporary ICU
facilities can be procured to the point where lockdown might
be eased earlier to limit the cumulative economic impact
while the ICU limit is still respected.
C. COMPLIANCE TO LOCKDOWN REGULATIONS

Given that compliance to lockdown regulations has seemingly waned over time in South Africa, the compliance parameter (d) in (19) is initiated with a value of 1, and reduced
linearly after a number of weeks in lockdown down to a value
of 0.3 (as seen in the bottom panel of Fig. 7). After the initial

compliance does increase at each reduction of the lockdown
level, but this has little impact given the magnitude of the
cumulative economic losses.
This policy has some resemblance to what has transpired
in South Africa to date. Lockdown regulations were imposed
early but relaxed while cases were still increasing owing to
economic concerns. Poor compliance was noticed (see e.g.
[36]) and after relaxing lockdown regulations some measures
were re-imposed to try and curb the spread.
The preliminary version of this paper, [39], used a model
with much higher case number predictions. This means that
the lockdown durations in [39] are much longer than those
found in this work. The shapes of the control moves and
outputs are however similar. Moreover, the controller hardly
required any tuning changes to achieve similar results, even
though the model changed significantly. This illustrates that
the controller is quite robust to the model used, and that
the policy concepts presented remain conceptually valid irrespective of whether the underlying model is very accurate.
V. LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY

decrease the level of compliance is set to increase every time
that the lockdown level is reduced. This is because there are
fewer regulations on lower levels, and the level of compliance
to those regulations will likely be higher initially. After the
initial surge, compliance will again reduce in a linear fashion.
It is visible from Fig. 7 that the lockdown is imposed
at the same time and with the same magnitude as what it
was in Fig. 6. Lockdown is also reduced from level 5 to
4 at the same time. After a couple of weeks in lockdown
however the population starts to deviate from the rules and
the effective number of contacts per person increases, which
consequently increases the spread of the virus. To try and
curb this phenomenon the controller moves the lockdown
level back to 5 as it applies feedback to try and balance
the ICU bed imposed limit with the economic impact of
the lockdown. After another period at level 5 the cumulative
economic impact has however ballooned while compliance
remains relatively low. Left with large economic losses and
a non-compliant population, the controller ramps down the
lockdown level from 5 to 1 in a relatively short time. The

Firstly, any model-based controller inherits the limitations of
the model that it is based upon. At the time of modelling the
spread of the virus, the SEIQRDP model appeared to be flexible enough and sufficiently representative of the underlying
system to be useful. In time however it is possible that new
knowledge is gained about the spread of COVID-19 that may
show the SEIQRDP model to be insufficient, or that another
model is superior.
Quantifying the economic impact per lockdown level may
be prone to error. As stated in Section III-B, it would be
preferable to base the impact on GDP directly, as opposed
to the proxy BETI index, but the timeliness of GDP data is
limiting.
The HMPC implementation assumes full state feedback, as
noted in Section III. State estimation was not implemented to
limit errors that may be introduced in such a step. The states
of many systems can be accurately estimated, but without a
full observability analysis of the system (see e.g. [40]) and
an implementation of state estimation it is difficult to say for
certain that this system lends itself to accurate estimation.

VI. CONCLUSION

An epidemiological model was developed for the spread of
COVID-19 in South Africa in [9]. The model was re-fitted
here using data for the period from 18 April to 16 August
2020 while the country was under lockdown levels 5, 4, and
3. The model was adapted here with varying values for the
spread rate (βm (l)) under varying levels of the lockdown
using more recent data. The main contribution of this paper
is the implementation of the HMPC controller to determine
the optimal lockdown level over time for different policy
scenarios.
Under a scenario where “flattening the curve” is the goal,
the healthcare capacity, expressed in terms of the number of
available ICU beds, is largely respected, but the lockdown is
severe. The detrimental cumulative economic impact of such
a severe lockdown is high. A balancing lives and livelihoods
policy was therefore introduced to allow for increased economic activity by reducing the lockdown level earlier. This
has the effect that the ICU bed imposed limit is violated, but
that more livelihoods are saved.
Lastly, compliance to lockdown regulations is added as an
unmeasured disturbance. The effect of the compliance is seen
through the higher number of confirmed infectious cases. To
curb waning compliance the lockdown level is increased and
extended to the point where the economic loss is too great
and lockdown is ended rather abruptly.
The simulations therefore show how to optimally implement lockdown strategies given the main concerns and policy
the implementer wants to enact.
