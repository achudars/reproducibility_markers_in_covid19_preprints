The COVID-19 infection cases have surged globally, causing devastations to both the society and economy. A key factor contributing to the sustained spreading is the presence of a large number of asymptomatic or hidden spreaders, who mix among the susceptible population without being detected or quarantined. Here we propose an effective non-pharmacological intervention method of detecting the asymptomatic spreaders in contact-tracing networks, and validated it on the empirical COVID-19 spreading
network in Singapore. We find that using pure physical spreading equations, the hidden spreaders of
COVID-19 can be identified with remarkable accuracy. Specifically, based on the unique characteristics
of COVID-19 spreading dynamics, we propose a computational framework capturing the transition probabilities among different infectious states in a network, and extend it to an efficient algorithm to identify
asymptotic individuals. Our simulation results indicate that a screening method using our prediction
outperforms machine learning algorithms, e.g. graph neural networks, that are designed as baselines in
this work, as well as random screening of infection’s closest contacts widely used by China in its early
outbreak. Furthermore, our method provides high precision even with incomplete information of the
contract-tracing networks. Our work can be of critical importance to the non-pharmacological interventions of COVID-19, especially with increasing adoptions of contact tracing measures using various
new technologies. Beyond COVID-19, our framework can be useful for other epidemic diseases that also
feature asymptomatic spreading.

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread at rapid
rates [1–3], and the development of effective pharmacological treatments is still uncertain according to WHO, nonpharmacological interventions like isolation of the infectious
through quarantines [4, 5] are the most effective and possibly the only means of containing the continued outbreaks, as
it effectively reduces the person to person transmissions [6].
Yet, unlike other infectious diseases like SARS and Ebola,
COVID-19 is unique in that a large portion of its infected population is mild or asymptotic [7]. Even some of the asymptotic infections do not exhibit any clinic symptoms until selfrecovery [8, 9]. Without being detected and subsequently
quarantined, the asymptomatic population (i.e. hidden spreaders) sustains the ongoing spreading of the disease to the susceptible population unknowingly [10, 11]. This poses a major

challenge in the effective mitigation of the pandemic spreading. Furthermore, empirical studies have shown that such
asymptomatic infections accounts for a large proportion of the
population [12–18], as much as up to 80% [18]. Currently,
estimation of the asymptomatic cases is done through exhaustive screening of close contacts of the known infected cases in
the contact tracing networks [17]. This untargeted method requires large amount of resources and is time consuming, that
in turn leads to ineffective or delayed interventions to quarantine the asymptomatic cases. Hence, a targeted screening
in the contact tracing network is pertinent, such that asymptomatic individuals can be estimated with high precision for
intervention and spreading mitigation.
Here we incorporate the empirical characteristics of the
COVID-19 spreading dynamics into a Markovian process, i.e.
vectors that represent the different infection stages and their
associated transition probabilities. By embedding the transition process into a contact tracing network that includes the

2
known infected nodes (individuals), we develop a method that
predicts the infectious states of the rest of the network with
high precision. By combining such predictions with the network structure, we then derive the spreading power of every
node taking into account of both its infectious state and its
specific location in the network, such that screening of the
asymptomatic can be prioritised accordingly. The effectiveness of our method is validated by empirical data from two
COVID-19 transmission networks in Singapore. Moreover, in
the simulated COVID-19 transmission experiment of contacttracing network, we find that a screening scheme designed by
the proposed computational framework outperforms several
machine-learning baselines designed in this work and the random screening of infection neighbors. The latter was widely
used in early COVID-19 outbreaks in China. Furthermore,
even in the realistic situation of incomplete information on the
contact tracing network, with missing links or sub networks
consisting of only contacts of the infected cases, our method
retains high accuracy. Thus our method is highly effective in
asymptomatic case estimation and can be implemented to any
contact-tracing networks either constructed manually [19] or
through technological means [20] such as Bluetooth [21, 22],
GPS [23] and digital check-in check-out technologies (e.g.
health QR codes [24] widely used in China).

I.

asymptomatic patients who carry the virus but have never
exhibited any symptoms until recovery. As a result, an individual can have a total of 5 different states in the process of
COVID-19 spreading (see Fig. 1a), namely, Susceptible (S),
Presymptomatic (P ), Asymptomatic (A), Symptomatic Infectious (I) and Recovered (R). Since the infectious duration in
the states of P , I and A follows a specific probability distribution, here we further break down the P, I and A states
into finer states representing the progression in each of the 3
states, i.e., the number of days passed since the beginning of
the states. For better clarity, we denote t as the number of days
of the COVID-19 evolution on the entire network and d as the
number of days in a particular infected state for a particular
individual. Since an individual i can be at any stage in the
process, we can use Zi (t) to represent the state probabilities
at time t:
Zi (t) =(Si (t), Pi1 (t), ..., Pid (t), ..., Ii1 (t), ...,
Iid (t), ..., A1i (t), ..., Adi (t), ..., Ri (t))

(1)

where Si (t) and Ri (t) is the probability that the individual i is
susceptible and recovered at day t, respectively. Pid (t), Iid (t)
and Adi (t) are the probabilities that i is in the state of P , I
and A for d days at the time of t. Since all of asymptomatic,
presymptomatic and symptomatic states are infected states,
their total probability corresponds to that of a node is infectious, and we use Ci (t) to represent it:

RESULTS

Ci (t) = Pi (t) + Ii (t) + Ai (t)
Given the spreading of the COVID-19 occurring over the
contact network, the challenge is to identify asymptomatic
nodes with the information of infected symptomatic individuals (nodes) that have been identified from a certain time T .
We approach this by estimating the probability of each node
being in the infected state as illustrated in Fig. 1. Specifically, we first construct the transition dynamical equations
among different infection stages and states based on the empirically observation of COVID-19 disease progression. The
set of transition equations is then combined with the contact
network topology and data on the observed infection history
to deduce the state of each node in the network.
As observed in many clinical studies, the hidden spreaders of COVID-19 fall into two different categories. One is
the presymptomatic infections who are asymptomatic and infected, but will later develop clinical symptoms (e.g. fever,
cough, dyspnea, etc.); The other type corresponds to the

(2)

where Pi (t) = d=1 Pid (t), Ii (t) = d=1 Iid (t), Ai (t) =
P∞
d
d=1 Ai (t). Throughout this work we use Ci (t) as a key
indicator to infer whether an individual is infected .
From here, we can extract the probability transition dynamics among the 5 different states as follows. First, for a node
who is in the susceptible state S at t, its next state at t + 1
will be jointly determined by the state of its neighbors in the
network at t. Specifically, the probability of a node i in S
state remains in S on day t + 1 (i.e., not infected by any of its
infected neighbor on the next day) is:
Si (t + 1) = Si (t) ·

Y

(1 − F(t, j, β))

(3)

j∈∂i

where ∂i represents the set of neighbors (contacts) of i in the
network, F(t, j, β) represents the probability that i is infected
by j. This can only happen if j is in the infected state on day t
(probability Cj (t)), and happens to transmit it to i (probability

3
probability that the individual i is in the state of R at the time
t + 1 is:

β). Then we have:
F(t, j, β) = Cj (t) · β

(4)

Here β can be estimated from the empirically observed disease reproduction number R0 for COVID-19 and the average number of neighbors in the contact tracing network hki.

tible person carries the virus, which can be expressed as λ =
σ2
p·µA +(1−p)·(exp(µP + 2P )+µI ), where p is the proportion
σ2
of asymptomatic infected cases, µA , exp(µP + 2P ), µI are the
average time of the virus carried by infected individuals in A,
P and I states [25, 26] respectively.
Next, for an individual under S state at time t, the probability of becoming presymptomatic state P at t + 1 is:
Y
Pi1 (t + 1) = Si (t) · (1 − p) · (1 −
(1 − F(t, j, β)) (5)
j∈∂i

Accordingly, we can calculate the probability that the state of
i become A at t + 1 as:
Y
A1i (t + 1) = Si (t) · p · (1 −
(1 − F(t, j, β)) (6)
j∈∂i

In the third case where a node i is in the infected state (i.e. E,
I or A, d ≥ 1) on day t, the transition probabilities that they
will stay in the same state on day t + 1 are:
1 − FP (d)

1 − FP (d − 1)

0. The fourth case is that individual in the presymptomatic
state P turns into the symptomatic infectious state I at the
next day, and can be described with the following transition
probability:

a certain probability of being recovered i.e, turning into the R
state on the next day. From the above equation, we obtain the

To validate our mathematical framework, we test it on
a real contact-tracing network in the Infectious Stay Away
exhibition[27] (ISA network, see Sec. SI 1 for data detailed
description) with 410 individuals and average degree hki of
13 (more experiments on another social network are illustrated in Sec. SI 5). We simulate the spreading with the empirically observed parameters on COVID-19 spreading mechanisms [25] (see Methods for the simulation details). From
repeated simulations, we then obtain the probability of every
possible state of a node, and compare this baseline with the
theoretical results from Eqns. 3-9. Here we set the dimension of Z to 77 according to the empirical temporal distributions of the infected states [25, 26] (see Method for detail).
From Fig. 2a and b, we can see that our theoretical result on
the temporal evolutions of the disease in the whole network is
well validated by the simulations. These show that our transition probability framework is accurate in producing the real
spreading dynamics.
Now we extend the proposed transition probability equations to identify nodes with high risk of being asymptomatic,
assuming the infection history on symptomatic nodes is already known. The underlying principle is to update every
node’s state by incorporating the information of known infection into Eqns.(2-9) in the subsequent days, and then deduce
the infection probability Ci (T ) for each node i in the network (see the details in the Method). The nodes with higher
Ci (T ) are identified as having high risk of being infected at
day T . We test the effectiveness by applying it on two sets of
real COVID-19 spreading data on the contact-tracing network
in Singapore [19] (see Fig. 2c and d). The details of network
is provided in Method and in Sec. SI 1. We find that the
ranking our Ci (T ) values are highly correlated with the date
of infection t of nodes (Fig. 2e and f), meaning nodes with
higher infection probabilities indeed have higher risk of being
infected in the real COVID-19 spreading data.
The Singapore empirical datasets have the constraint of
merely including the symptomatic individuals’ identities in
the network. Therefore, to further evaluate our method, we

4
simulate a realistic COVID-19 spreading process on the ISA
network for T days to obtain the detailed infection history
of every node in the network, such that the exact infection
history on the asymptomatic nodes can be obtained. Assuming only the symptomatic nodes with state I are observed,
we use our above method to identify those infected individuals among the rest of the nodes. Specifically, we select the
nodes with the highest Ci (T ) values as the mostly likely infected nodes. To our best knowledge, there is few prior works
for estimating asymptomatic nodes in the network. Therefore,
we also design several screening baselines based on the popular graph neural networks methods including Node2Vec [38],
graph convolutional network [39] and graph attention networks [40] to further compare our results. (Detailed methodologies for those methods in Sec. SI 3).
The simulations results show that our transition probabilistic method (i.e. static screening) significantly outperforms the
other methods in terms of the accuracy and recall on the local
network where one can only observe the nearest neighbors of
the known nodes in states I (see SI Figure 1). Such advantage is still evident when we consider the alternative scenario
that one can observe the full network structure [21, 22] (see
SI Figure 3), and the intermediate scenario when only nearest and second nearest neighbors are known in the network
(see SI Figure 2). In a more realistic setting, the screening of the contact tracing network happens continuously in
time. Here one can update the set of known infected nodes
after every screening, and subsequently update the infected
risk for the rest of the network from time to time. Therefore, we develop a dynamic screening method by updating the
evaluation of Ci (t) every time a new infected node is found
through selective screening of the network (see the details in
the Method Section). This dynamic screening method outperforms (see Fig. 3a-d) other screening methods and even our
previous static screening method (see Fig. 3d inset), implying that such dynamic screening method is highly effective in
identifying infected nodes by screening less people.
Very often, the contact tracing network collected through
either manual survey or digital tracking is at best incomplete,
such that it is important to have a screening method that is
still robust when there is missing information on the network
structure. To test such robustness of our method, we randomly
remove up to 80% of the edges in the ISA network, and test the
accuracy of the method based on the remaining network (see
the results on another network in SI Figures 14-19). We find

that the dynamic screening method on the various scenarios
can still reliably identify the infected nodes in terms of accuracy and recall rate, as shown in Fig. 3e-h (see the robustness
result on the static screening method in SI Figures 14-17).
Lastly, we study the effectiveness of our method in containing the overall spread of COVID-19. In the widespread of
COVID-19, limited resource on screening constrains the number of individuals the government can screen in a given day.
Hence, targeted screening and mitigation can have significant
impact on ‘flattening the curve’ of daily infected cases. To
study such effect, we again simulate the COVID-19 spreading on the ISA network [27], and start screening/testing from
day 10 using our method (i.e. ‘neighbor containment’). Each
day 2% (4% in SI Figure 20) of the whole network are tested
for the disease, and the positive ones are immediately quarantined, corresponding a transition to the state R (see details of
the containment strategy in Sec. SI 4). As shown in Fig. 4a-e,
our method is highly effective in suppressing the daily infection cases and total infection cases, outperforming both the
baseline strategy of only quarantining the infected ones (labeled as ‘infection containment’) and the strategy randomly
screening 2%N among the neighbors of the known infections
(labelled as ‘neighbor containment’), where N is the network
size. In addition, we find that even with up to 80% missing
links, our method is still robust enough to effectively suppress
the spreading, close to that of knowing the full network structure. It shows that our method is expected to be highly effective in containing COVID-19 spread in practice.

CONCLUSION

In this paper, based on the transmission rule of COVID-19
and the underlying physical spreading equations, we for the
first time studied the estimation of asymptomatic infections
in the contact-tracing network, which is a current major concern in the prevention and containment of COVID-19 worldwide. We provided a complete computational framework of
inferring latent infection on contact network. Based on this,
we proposed a feasible method for optimal detection of latent infection in combination with nodal transmission ability
in the network. We show that the COVID-19 transmission
can be broken in a timely and efficient manner by the proposed method, which outperforms the direct contact screening, a typical method widely used in China. In addition, our

COVID-19 spreading simulation. At the starting time
T = 0, we select the 3 nodes with the largest degree in the
network as initial infected nodes, whose infected states are determined as either Asymptomatic or Presymptomatic according to the parameter p of Tab. 1. Then we apply the empirically observed parameters on COVID-19 spreading mechanisms [25] including reproductive number R0 = 3.50 and

asymptotic infection ratio p = 15% on our equations to simulate the spreading. The set of values are listed in Table. 1(see
Sec. SI 1 for the detail description of parameters and Sec. SI
3 for the discussion of the parameter sensitivity). Each simulation corresponds to one realization of the actual spreading
based on the realistic dynamics, and the actual states of each
node at every time step can be captured. More details of the
simulation of COVID-19 are provided in Sec. SI 2.
Identifying infection probability Ci (T ). The goal is to
identify nodes with high risk of being asymptomatic with infection history on known symptomatic nodes, and we extend
our transition probability equations to study this problem. At
a certain time T , given the set I of infected individuals, the
first day of infection sj and the day of recovery rj for each
individual j ∈ I, we aim to develop a method from Eqns. 210 to deduce the infection probability Ci (T ) for each node
i in the network. Note that the day of recovery can also be
the day of death or quarantine. The initial condition at t = 0
is that every node in the network is in susceptible state, i.e.
Zi (0) = {1, 0, · · · , 0}. The day of first infection in the network is set to 1, i.e. minj∈I sj = 1, and we update every
node’s state in the subsequent days depending on whether
their infection history is known at time T . For the known
nodes j ∈ I, we artificially assign their infection states according to the known information, meaning that j is assigned
state S when t < sj , state R when t > rj , and infectious state
when sj < t < rj . For the other nodes, we evaluate their
state vector Zi (t) at every time step t according to the transition probabilities in Eqns. 2-9, until the final day T , such that
their probabilities Ci (T ) of being infected can be evaluated
from Zi (T ).
Dynamic screening method. Every time we screen only
node k that is of highest risk according to the algorithm; if
node k is COVID-19 positive, it is added to the known infected nodes set I, and its neighbors are added to the unknown
set, and we repeat the transition probability calculations according to Eqns. 2-10 from time 0 < t ≤ T ; if k is negative,
its probability state vector is set to be Zk (t) = {1, 0, · · · , 0}
in the calculation of Eqns. 2-10. Next, the revised estimations of infection probabilities for each unknown node from
Eqns. 2-10 tells us which node is the most risky and to be
tested.

demonstrating its effectiveness in practical scenarios. We believe that the theory and the corresponding methods in identifying COVID-19 hidden spreaders are of great practical significance. In principle, it provides policymakers and front-line
workers in COVID-19 with important and effective guidance
and tools that could be deployed swiftly to fight COVID-19,
and save billions of people around the world who are still
suffering as the epidemic continues to spread throughout the
world.

METHOD

Singapore COVID-19 datasets. The data was collected by
the Singapore government [19], and contains comprehensive
records on the dates of showing symptoms and confirming the
disease, as well as their contact networks. We pick the infected nodes from the first two different time points, and set
T to January 26, 2020 and February 19, 2020 for Singapore A
and Singapore B, respectively. Then based on the known infection history of the nodes, our transition probability method
estimates the infection probabilities Ci (T ) of every other node
in the networks.
The dimension of the state vector Zi (t). The dimension
of the state vector Zi (t) corresponds to the total number of sub
states possible during the various disease progression paths,
i.e., the number of days that an individual can be in each of
the 3 different infected states. From the empirical temporal
distributions of the infected states [25, 26] (Tab. 1), we use
3 standard deviations [41] as cut off on the max number of
days in states P, I, A, which are 20, 20, 35 days, yielding a
dimension of 77 for Z. (S and R states have no sub states).

FIG. 1: Identifying Asymptomatic and Presymptomatic COVID-19 Infections on Contact-tracing Networks. (a) The
COVID-19 state transition of an individual. A susceptible will become either asymptomatic or presymptomatic after being
infected. An asymptomatic patient will further turns to the symptomatic state after an incubation period, while an
presymptomatic patient will never exhibit any symptoms until the recover. (b) Illustration of asymptotic/presymptomatic node
identification problem. In a contact-tracing network, only a small fraction of the nodes’ states are known (marked with color),
while the hidden asymptomatic/presymptomatic individuals within the population (marked with grey) are potential spreaders.
Our purpose is to find asymptomatic/presymptomatic infected individuals in the population using the contact-tracing network
and the information of known confirmed cases. (c) Diagram of the proposed method. The state transition of an unknown node k
is modeled as a Markov process, i.e., a vector Zk where the elements represent the probabilities of different infection stages in
(a). The specific value of the vector Zk (t + 1) at t + 1 is determined by the infection status of known nodes at t and the
structure of the contact network. (d) After iterations over the whole network, each unknown node will be assigned with an
infection indicator according to the eventual values of its state vector Zk , which represents the risk of being infected.

FIG. 2: Empirical and Simulated Validation of the Proposed Model. (a) The number of people in each of the 5 states in the
simulation process of COVID-19 spreading on the ISA network. At T = 0, we select three nodes with the maximum degree in
the ISA network as the initial infected spreaders. Dash lines represent the theory values calculated by Eqns.(6-10). Dots
represent the average value of 1000 simulations. (b) The theoretical probability vs. numerical frequency of each individual
being in various states on T = 10 days. Each dot corresponds to a certain state of a node in the ISA network while the errorbar
is the 95% confidence interval obtained by the bootstrapping method [42]. (c) The topological structure of a real COVID-19
spreading network in Singapore (Singapore A), where dots are patients and curves are contacts between patients (see Sec. SI 1
for the description of the network). The points on the timeline indicate the date of the patient’s presence. (d) The topological
structure of another network of Singapore (Singapore B). (e) Relationship between the individual symptomatic time and the
estimated infection probability in Singapore A. The network has a total of T = 30, from January 23, 2020 to February 21, 2020.
Here we utilize the information of infections from the first two different time points as known set to infer the rest nodes’ states
in the network by Eqns. (1-9). Using the obtained state vector of each unknown node, we rank them according to the infection
probability and compare with it’s real symptomatic time. Since all patients are symptomatic in the dataset, the rank is based on
Ci (t) − Ai (t). The line denotes the linear fitted result and the shaded area denotes the 95% confidence interval. (f) Similar to
(e), the value of the rank of infection probability vs. symptomatic time in Singapore B. The network has a total of T = 40, from
February 11, 2020 to March 21, 2020. We use infections who got infected the first two different time points for training.

FIG. 3: Screening Performance Assessment. (a-d) Performance of the dynamic screening method on the ISA network
compared with other machine-learning baselines (see details in Sec. SI 3). (a) The accuracy vs. rank of infection (divided by
the network size). The accuracy is defined as the proportion of non-Susceptible individuals in the ranking list. Since all nodes
we screen at T do not have symptoms, here we use the value of Ci (t) − Ii (t) to rank these nodes. (b) Similar to (a), the relative
accuracy of the machine-learning-based algorithms, which is the ratio between the accuracy of our proposed algorithm and
other algorithms. (c) The relationship between the rank of infection and the recall rate (i.e., the proportion of successfully
identified non-Susceptible individuals to those in the whole network. (d) Similar to (c), the relative recall rate of the
machine-learning-based algorithms. (inset) Recall rate of the static algorithms on the 1-step neighbor subnetwork and on the
whole network (see SI Figures 14-17), compared with the dynamic algorithm. (e-h) Performance of the dynamic screening
method with incomplete network information. We randomly remove a fraction of links in the ISA network (see the result of
another social network in Sec. SI 5) and then employ the proposed screening schemes on the remaining network. (e) The
relationship between the accuracy and the ranking value of the infection probability with different proportions of the removed
edges. Here we normalize the ranking value to range [0,1] by dividing it with the total number of individuals who have been
screened. (f) Accuracy of the dynamic screening method vs. the proportion of the removed edges by measuring the infection
rank with different proportions. For example, top 20% rank means the 20% nodes with the highest infection possibility which
is equal to 0.2 of norlized rank of infection in (e). (g) The dependencies of recall rate of the dynamic screening method on the
infection rank. (h) Recall vs. the remaining edges.

FIG. 4: Containment Effectiveness of the Proposed Scheme on Simulated COVID-19 Spreading. From T = 10 of
COVID-19 spreading simulation on the ISA network, we conduct different approaches separately to contain the pandemic,
including the proposed method (i.e. Dynamic Containment), the Infection Containment and the Neighbor Containment (see
Sec. SI 4 for details). For the Neighbor Containment and the proposed method, we select a total of 2%N of individuals to
screen and then quarantine those tested positive at each time step. (a) Visualization of infected population without conducting
any contain scheme and (b-d) the 3 different control schemes). (e) The number of daily new infections in different control
schemes. The value of each curve is divided by the highest point at that time to normalize to [0,1]. (f) The cumulative number
of infections corresponding to (e). (g-h) The performance of our control scheme under an incomplete network where a fraction
of links are randomly removed in the detection process.
