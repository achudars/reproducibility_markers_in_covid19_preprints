Abstract
Background
COVID-19 pandemic has created an extreme pressure on the global healthcare services. Fast, reliable and early clinical assessment of
the severity of the disease can help in allocating and prioritizing resources to reduce mortality.
Methods
In order to study the important blood biomarkers for predicting disease mortality, a retrospective study was conducted on 375 COVID19 positive patients admitted to Tongji Hospital (China) from January 10 to February 18, 2020. Demographic and clinical characteristics,
and patient outcomes were investigated using machine learning tools to identify key biomarkers to predict the mortality of individual
patient. A nomogram was developed for predicting the mortality risk among COVID-19 patients.
Results
Lactate dehydrogenase, neutrophils (%), lymphocyte (%), high sensitive C-reactive protein, and age - acquired at hospital admission
were identified as key predictors of death by multi-tree XGBoost model. The area under curve (AUC) of the nomogram for the derivation
and validation cohort were 0.961 and 0.991, respectively. An integrated score (LNLCA) was calculated with the corresponding death
probability. COVID-19 patients were divided into three subgroups: low-, moderate- and high-risk groups using LNLCA cut-off values
of 10.4 and 12.65 with the death probability less than 5%, 5% to 50%, and above 50%, respectively.
Conclusions
The prognostic model, nomogram and LNLCA score can help in early detection of high mortality risk of COVID-19 patients, which
will help doctors to improve the management of patient stratification.

CHARACTERISTICS, AND CLINICAL OUTCOMES
Of the 375 patients, 174 (46.4%) died, while 201 (53.6%)
patients recovered from COVID-19 and were discharged from
hospital. Figure 1 summarizes the outcome of patients based
on their initial conditions: general (197), severe (27) and
critical (151). The minimal, maximal and median follow-up
times (from hospital admission to death or discharge) for all
375 patients are 0 days, 35 days and 12 days, respectively.
Table 1 summarizes the demographic characteristics,

The detailed description of 16 characteristics are listed in

Hospital Ethics Committee.

In summary, based on multiple risk factors (Lactate
Dehydrogenase, Neutrophils (%), Lymphocytes (%), High
Sensitive C-reactive protein, and age), our developed
nomogram can predict the prognosis of patients with COVID19 with good discrimination and calibration. The model can
predict the patient’s outcome far ahead of the day of primary
clinical outcome with very high accuracy. Therefore, the
application of LNLCA would help clinicians make an efficient
and optimized patient stratification management plan without
overloading the healthcare resources and also reduce the death
