Abstract
Monotone matrices play a key role in the convergence theory of regular splittings and
different types of weak regular splittings. If monotonicity fails, then it is difficult to
guarantee the convergence of the above-mentioned classes of matrices. In such a case, Kmonotonicity is sufficient for the convergence of K-regular and K-weak regular splittings,
where K is a proper cone in Rn . However, the convergence theory of a two-stage iteration
scheme in general proper cone setting is a gap in the literature. Especially, the same study
for weak regular splittings of type II (even if in standard proper cone setting, i.e., K =
Rn+ ), is open. To this end, we propose convergence theory of two-stage iterative scheme
for K-weak regular splittings of both types in the proper cone setting. We provide some
sufficient conditions which guarantee that the induced splitting from a two-stage iterative
scheme is a K-regular splitting and then establish some comparison theorems. We also
study K-monotone convergence theory of the stationary two-stage iterative method in
case of a K-weak regular splitting of type II. The most interesting and important part of
this work is on M-matrices appearing in the Covid-19 pandemic model. Finally, numerical
computations are performed using the proposed technique to compute the next generation
matrix involved in the pandemic model.

1. Introduction
Let us consider a real large and sparse n × n non-singular linear systems of the form
Ax = b

(1.1)

that appear in the process of discretization of elliptic partial differential equations (see
[22, 26]). Whereas matrix equations of the form AX = B appear in the problem of
computing the spectral radius of the next generation matrix in a Covid-19 Pandemic
model which is shown in Section 5. Iterative methods using matrix splittings is one of
the simple methods for finding the iterative solution of (1.1) and the same idea can also be
used to solve AX = B. So, our focus is on developing convergence theory of a particular
iteration scheme to solve (1.1). A matrix splitting A = U − V leads to the iteration
scheme
xk+1 = Hxk + c.

(1.2)

The matrix H = U −1 V in the above equation is called as the iteration matrix. It is
well-known that the iteration scheme (1.2) converges for any initial vector x0 (or is called
convergent) if ρ(H) < 1, where ρ(H) denotes the spectral radius of the matrix H, i.e.,
maximum of moduli of eigenvalues of H.
A splitting A = U − V is called a K-regular splitting [5, 7] if U −1 exists, U −1 ≥K 0
and V ≥K 0 (A ≥K 0 means AK ⊆ K where K is a proper cone, see the next section for
more details). A splitting A = U − V is called a K-weak regular splitting of type I (or
type II) [5, 7] if U −1 exists, U −1 ≥K 0 and U −1 V ≥K 0 (or V U −1 ≥K 0). The following
convergence theorem was established in [5].
Theorem 1.1. (Theorem 2.2, [5])
Let A = U − V be a K-weak regular splitting of type I (or type II). Then, A−1 exists and
A−1 ≥K 0 if and only if ρ(U −1 V ) < 1.
When K = Rn+ , then the definitions of K-regular and K-weak regular type I (or type II)
splittings coincide with the definition of regular [24] and weak regular type I (or type II)
[19, 28], respectively. We refer the reader to the book [24] for the convergence results for
these classes of matrices. However, the classical iterative methods are computationally
expensive, which attracts the researcher to develop fast iterative solvers. In this context,
several comparison results are obtained in the literature (see [5, 6, 14] and the references
cited therein).
In 1973, Nichols [18] proposed the notion of two-stage iterative method which is
recalled next. Let us consider an iterative scheme of the form
Uxk+1 = V xk + b,
2

(1.3)

where we take the splitting A = U − V of A for solving a linear system of the form (1.1).
The scheme (1.3) is called outer iteration. At each step of (1.3), we must solve the inner
equations
Uy = b̃,

b̃ = V xk + b.

(1.4)

In the two-stage iterative technique, we solve (1.4) by another iterative scheme (called
inner iteration) which is formed by using a splitting U = F − G, and the same scheme
performs s(k) inner iterations. In particular, Frommer and Szyld [9] considered the twostage iterative scheme of the form

For a given initial vector x0 , the two-stage iterative scheme (1.5) produces the sequence

We say that the iterative scheme (1.5) is stationary when s(k) = s for all k, while it is
non-stationary when s(k) changes with k. The authors of [9] established the convergence
of (1.5) by considering A = U − V as a convergent regular splitting and U = F − G
as a convergent weak regular splitting of type I for both stationary and non-stationary
scheme (1.5). We refer to [4] for the stability and error analysis of the two-stage iterative
method. One can also refer a few more convergence and comparison results by Bai and
Wang [1], but the scope is limited up to type I only. In this article, we aim to establish
the convergence of the two-stage iterative scheme (1.5) when A = U − V has a K-regular
splitting and the inner iteration matrix splitting U = F − G has a K-weak regular splitting of type II thus expanding the convergence theory of two-stage iterative method.
The structure of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, we introduce some notations
and definitions which help to prove the main results. The convergence result is established
in Section 3. We further analyze the K-regularity of the induced splitting from the twostage iterative scheme and derive a few comparison theorems. In Section 4, we set up
the K-monotone convergence theorem for the two-stage iterative scheme. Section 5 deals
with a Covid-19 pandemic model and the computation of the next generation matrix
involved in this model.

2. Preliminaries
In this section, we collect some basic results required to prove our main results. We begin
with the notation Rn×n which represents the set of all real matrices of order n × n. We
denote the transpose of A ∈ Rn×n by AT . Throughout the paper, all our matrices are
real n × n matrices unless otherwise stated. σ(A) denotes the set of all eigenvalues of A.
By a convergent matrix A, we mean lim Ak = 0. A matrix A is convergent if and only
k→∞

if ρ(A) < 1. We write K and int(K) to denote a proper cone and the interior of K in
Rn , respectively. A nonempty subset K of Rn is called a cone if 0 ≤ λ implies λK ⊆ K.
A cone K is closed if and only if it coincides with its closure. A cone is a convex cone if
K + K ⊆ K, a pointed cone if K ∩ (−K) = {0} and a solid cone if int(K) 6= φ. A closed,
pointed, solid convex cone is called a proper cone. A proper cone induces a partial order
in Rn via x ≥K y if and only if x − y ≥K 0 (see [3] for more details). π(K) denotes the
set of all matrices in Rn×n which leave a proper cone K ⊆ Rn invariant (i.e., AK ⊆ K).
We now move to the notion of K-nonnegativity of a matrix which generalizes the usual
nonnegativity (i.e., entry-wise nonnegativity). A ≥K 0 is equivalent to A ∈ π(K). For
A, B ∈ Rn×n , A ≥K B if A − B ≥K 0. A matrix A is called K-monotone if A−1 exists
and A−1 ≥K 0 (see [3]). A vector x ∈ Rn is called K-nonnegative (K-positive) if x ∈ K
(x ∈ int(K)), and is denoted as x ≥K 0 (x >K 0). Similarly, for x, y ∈ Rn , x ≥K y
(x >K y) if x − y ≥K 0 (x − y >K 0). Applications of nonnegative matrices to ecology
and epidemiology can be seen in the very recent article [13] by Lewis et al.. Next results
deal with nonnegativity of a matrix and its spectral radius.
Theorem 2.1. (Corollary 3.2 & Lemma 3.3, [14])
Let A ≥K 0. Then
(i) Ax ≥K αx, x ≥K 0, implies α ≤ ρ(A). Moreover, if Ax > αx, then α < ρ(A).
(ii) βx ≥K Ax, x > 0, implies ρ(A) ≤ β. Moreover, if αx > Ax, then α > ρ(A).
Theorem 2.2. (Theorem 1.3.2, [3] & Lemma 2, [27])
Let A ≥K 0. Then
(i) ρ(A) is an eigenvalue.
(ii) K contains an eigenvector of A corresponding to ρ(A).
(iii) ρ(A) < α if and only if αI − A is non-singular and (αI − A)−1 ≥K 0.
The next result discusses the convergence of a K-monotone sequence (i.e., a monotone
sequence with respect to the proper cone K).
Lemma 2.3. (Lemma 1, [2])
Let K be a proper cone in Rn and let {si }∞
i=0 be a K-monotone non-decreasing sequence.
4

Let t ∈ Rn be such that t − si ∈ K for every positive integer i. Then the sequence {si }∞
i=0
converges.
A comparison of the spectral radii of two different iteration matrices arising out of two
matrix splittings is useful for improving the speed of the iteration scheme (1.2). In this
direction, several comparison results have been introduced in the literature (see [5, 6]).
We recall below a few comparison results for the iterative scheme (1.2) that are helpful
to obtain our main results in Section 3. The first two results stated below generalize
Theorem 3.4 and Theorem 3.7 of [28], while the third one generalizes Theorem 3.4 of [17]
for an arbitrary proper cone K. These results can be proved similarly as proved in [28]
and [17] using our preliminary results, and is therefore omitted.
Theorem 2.4. Let A = U1 − V1 = U2 − V2 be two K-weak regular splittings of type II of
a K-monotone matrix A ∈ Rn×n . If V2 ≥K V1 , then ρ(U1−1 V1 ) ≤ ρ(U2−1 V2 ) < 1.
Theorem 2.5. Let A = U1 − V1 = U2 − V2 be two K-weak regular splittings of different
types of a K-monotone matrix A ∈ Rn×n . If U1−1 ≥K U2−1 , then ρ(U1−1 V1 ) ≤ ρ(U2−1 V2 ) <
1.
Theorem 2.6. Let A = U1 − V1 = U2 − V2 be two K-weak regular splittings of type II of
a K-monotone matrix A ∈ Rn×n . If U2 ≥K U1 ≥K 0, then ρ(U1−1 V1 ) ≤ ρ(U2−1 V2 ) < 1.

3. Main Results
We divide this section into two parts. The first subsection discusses the convergence
results for stationary and non-stationary two-stage method. We then classify the type
of splitting induced by the two-stage iterative scheme. The second subsection discusses
some interesting comparison results.

3.1. Convergence Results
In the case of standard proper cone K = Rn+ , Frommer and Szyld [9] obtained the
convergence criteria for stationary two-stage iteration scheme (1.5) in Theorem 4.3 [9]
when U = F − G is a convergent weak regular splitting of type I. In Theorem 4.4 [9], they
stated the convergence result for non-stationary two-stage iteration scheme (1.5). We
state below the convergence result for stationary and non-stationary two-stage iteration
schemes in an arbitrary proper cone setting. We skip the proof as it follows similar steps
as in [9].
5

Theorem 3.1. Let A = U − V be a convergent K-regular splitting and U = F − G be
a convergent K-weak regular splitting of type I. Then, the stationary and non-stationary
two-stage iteration scheme is convergent for any sequence s(k) ≥ 1, k = 1, 2, . . . of inner
iterations.
However, the convergence of (1.5) is not yet studied if U = F −G is not a weak regular
splitting of type I even in the standard proper cone Rn+ setting. This issue is settled in
this subsection for another class of splittings known as K-weak regular splitting of type
II. To do this, we have

from the two-stage iteration scheme (1.5). If the splitting U = F − G for the system (1.4)
is a K-weak regular splitting of type II, then the matrix

is K-nonnegative. Recall that two matrices B and C are similar if there exists a nonsingular matrix X such that B = XCX −1 . It is well-known that similar matrices have
the same eigenvalues. Hence ρ(B) = ρ(C). Based on this fact, we present below our
first main result which says Ts(k) and Tbs(k) have the same spectral radius under some
assumption.

Lemma 3.2. Let Tbs(k) be as defined as (3.2) and Ts(k) be as defined as (3.1) for s(k) =
1, 2, . . . . If V F −1 G = GF −1 V , then ρ(Tbs(k) ) = ρ(Ts(k) ).
Proof. Since V F −1 G = GF −1 V , we have V (F −1 G)s(k) = (GF −1 )s(k) V for any nonnega-

tive integer s(k). Also, we observe that U −1 GF −1 = F −1 GU −1 . Therefore, U −1 (GF −1)j =
(F −1 G)j U −1 for any nonnegative integer j. Now,
ATs(k) A−1 = A[I − (I − (F −1 G)s(k) )(I − U −1 V )]A−1
= I − A(I − (F −1G)s(k) )U −1
= I − A(U −1 − (F −1 G)s(k) U −1 )
= I − AU −1 (I − (GF −1)s(k) )
= I − (I − V U −1 )(I − (GF −1 )s(k) )
= I − (I − (GF −1 )s(k) ) + V U −1 (I − (GF −1 )s(k) )

Thus, the matrices Ts(k) and Tbs(k) are similar. Hence, ρ(Tbs(k) ) = ρ(Ts(k) ).

Next, we establish the convergence of (1.5) when the splitting U = F − G is a K-weak

regular splitting of type II that partially fulfills the objective of the paper.
Theorem 3.3. Let A = U − V be a convergent K-regular splitting and U = F − G be
a convergent K-weak regular splitting of type II such that V F −1 G = GF −1 V . Then, the
stationary two-stage iterative method is convergent for any initial vector x0 .

(GF −1 )j y = Tbs(k) x. By Theorem 2.1 (ii), we have ρ(Tbs(k) ) < 1. Hence

ρ(Ts(k) ) < 1 by Lemma 3.2.

In the standard proper cone setting (K = Rn+ ), we have the following new result.
Corollary 3.4. Let A = U − V be a convergent regular splitting and U = F − G be
a convergent weak regular splitting of type II such that V F −1 G = GF −1 V . Then, the
stationary two-stage iterative method is convergent for any initial vector x0 .
Remark 3.1. Each of the result presented hereafter for the proper cone has an inbuilt
corollary as mentioned above in the standard proper cone (K = Rn+ ) setting which is
even a new result.
For non-stationary two-stage method, we have the following result. The proof is
similar to above, therefore we omit it.
Theorem 3.5. Let A = U − V be a convergent K-regular splitting and U = F − G be
a convergent K-weak regular splitting of type II such that V F −1 G = GF −1 V . Then, the
non-stationary two-stage iterative method (1.5) is convergent for any sequence s(k) ≥
1, k = 0, 1, 2, . . ..
Next result states that the matrices Ts(k) and Tbs(k) induce the same splitting.

Theorem 3.6. Let A = U − V be a K-regular splitting of a K-monotone matrix A ∈
Rn×n . Let U = F − G be a K-weak regular splitting of type II such that V F −1 G =
GF −1 V . Then, the matrices Ts(k) and Tbs(k) induce the same splitting A = B − C, where

B = A(I − Ts(k) )−1 . Further, the unique splitting A = X − Y induced by the matrix Tbs(k)
is also a K-weak regular splitting of type II.

Proof. We have B = A(I − Ts(k) )−1 and C = B − A. Let X = (I − Tbs(k) )−1 A and
Y = X − A. We will show that Ts(k) and Tbs(k) induce the same splitting A = B − C.

Also, Y X −1 = (X − A)X −1 = I − AA−1 (I − Tbs(k) ) = Tbs(k) ≥K 0. Thus, A = X − Y is

a K-weak regular splitting of type II. Let A = X1 − Y1 be another splitting induced by
Tbs(k) such that Tbs(k) = Y1 X1−1 . Then A = X1 − Tbs(k) X1 = (I − Tbs(k) )X1 which implies
X1 = (I − Tbs(k) )−1 A = X. Hence, A = X − Y is a unique K-weak regular splitting of
type II induced by Tbs(k) .

Remark 3.2. From the above result, it is easy to observe that the induced splitting has
the form
A = Ps(k) − Tbs(k) Ps(k) ,

where the matrix Tbs(k) is as defined by (3.2) and Ps(k)

F − G is a K-weak regular splitting of type II. Similarly, if U = F − G is a K-weak
regular splitting of type I in the above theorem, then the induced splitting is a unique Kweak regular splitting of type I. While proving the same, we do not need the assumption
V F −1 G = GF −1 V .
In the following, we provide some sufficient conditions for the induced splitting to be
a K-regular splitting.
Theorem 3.7. Let A = U − V be a K-regular splitting of a K-monotone matrix A ∈
Rn×n . Let U = F −G be a K-weak regular splitting of type II such that V F −1 G = GF −1 V .
If G ≥K GF −1 G, then the induced splitting A = Ps(k) − Tbs(k) Ps(k) is a K-regular splitting.
9

Proof. By Theorem 3.6 amd Remark 3.2, the induced splitting A = Ps(k) − Tbs(k) Ps(k) is a
K-weak regular splitting of type II. So, we only need to prove that Tbs(k) Ps(k) ≥K 0. We

have

Tbs(k) Ps(k) = Ps(k) − A

= (I − (GF −1 )s(k) )−1 U − U + V
= [(I − (GF −1 )s(k) )−1 − I]U + V
= (I − (GF −1 )s(k) )−1 (GF −1 )s(k) U + V.

Now, in order to show that (GF −1 )s(k) U ≥K 0, it is sufficient to prove that (GF −1 )2 U ≥K
0. So,
(GF −1 )2 U = (GF −1 )(GF −1)U
= GF −1 GF −1 (F − G)
= GF −1 (G − GF −1 G) ≥K 0.
As GF −1 ≥K 0 and (GF −1 )2 U ≥K 0, we have (GF −1 )s(k) U ≥K 0. Hence Tbs(k) Ps(k) ≥K
0.

3.2. Comparison Results
In this section, we prove certain comparison results. These results help us to choose a
splitting that yields faster convergence of the respective two-stage iterative scheme (1.5).
In this aspect, we now frame two different two-stage iterative schemes by taking two

We use this information to prove our first comparison result presented below.
Theorem 3.8. Let A = U − V be a K-regular splitting of a K-monotone matrix A ∈

then ρ(Ts(k) ) ≤ ρ(T s(k) ) < 1.
Proof. By Theorem 3.5, we have ρ(Ts(k) ) < 1 and ρ(T s(k) ) < 1. Now, by Theorem 3.6
and Remark 3.2, the induced splittings A = Ps(k) − Tbs(k) Ps(k) and A = P s(k) − Tb s(k) P s(k)
10

are K-weak regular splittings of type II. Since ρ(F −1 G) < 1 and ρ(F

Tb s(k) P s(k) = [I − (G F )s(k) ]−1 U − A ≥K [I − (GF −1 )s(k) ]−1 U − A = Tbs(k) Ps(k) . Thus,
applying Theorem 2.4 to the splittings A = Ps(k) − Tbs(k) Ps(k) and A = P s(k) − Tb s(k) P s(k) ,
we get ρ(Tb ) ≤ ρ(Tb ). Hence ρ(T ) ≤ ρ(T ) < 1 by Lemma 3.2.

nonnegative restriction on the matrix U in Theorem 3.8 can be dropped if we add the
condition G ≥K GF −1 G to the above result. Next, we illustrate a few more comparison
results.

Hence ρ(Ts(k) ) ≤ ρ(T s(k) ) < 1 by Lemma 3.2.

by Lemma 3.2.

We end this subsection with a result that compares two K-weak regular splittings of
different types.
Theorem 3.12. Let A = U − V be a K-regular splitting of a K-monotone matrix A ∈

respectively. The induced splittings A = Ps(k) − Ps(k) Ts(k) is a K-weak regular splitting

4. Monotone Iterations
In this section, we discuss the monotone convergence theory of the two-stage stationary
iterative method (1.5). The monotone convergence theorem for the case when U = F − G
is a weak regular splitting of type I was proved by Bai [1]. We prove the case when
U = F − G is a K-weak regular splitting of type II. To this end, we need an additional
assumption “A is K-nonnegative”, and the same is shown hereunder.
Theorem 4.1. (Monotone Convergence Theorem) Let A = U −V be a K-regular splitting
of a K-nonnegative and K-monotone matrix A ∈ Rn×n . Further, assume that U = F − G
be a K-weak regular splitting of type II such that V F −1 G = GF −1 V and s(k) ≥ 1,
k = 0, 1, 2 . . . be the inner iteration sequence. If x0 and y0 are initial values that hold
x1 ≥K x0 , y0 ≥K y1 and y0 ≥K A−1 b ≥K x0 .

(4.1)

Then, the sequences {xk } and {yk } generated by
−1
xk+1 = Ts(k) xk + Ps(k)
b,
−1
yk+1 = Ts(k) yk + Ps(k)
b,

k = 0, 1, 2, . . . satisfy
(i) yk ≥K yk+1 ≥K xk+1 ≥K xk , k = 0, 1, 2, . . .,
(ii) lim xk = A−1 b = lim yk and yk ≥K yk+1 ≥K A−1 b ≥K xk+1 ≥K xk , k =
n→∞

k→∞

0, 1, 2, . . ..
Proof. (i) We will show by induction that xk+1 ≥K xk for k = 0, 1, 2, . . .. The case k = 0
is established by the hypothesis. Assume that the result holds for k = 0, 1, . . . , p > 0 so
13

that xp+1 −xp ≥K 0, then there exist zp+1 and zp such that zp+1 −zp = A(xp+1 −xp ) ≥K 0.
Since s(k) is independent of k and Tbs(k) ≥K 0 for k = 0, 1, . . ., we have
A−1 Tbs(p) (zp+1 − zp ) = Ts(p) A−1 (zp+1 − zp )
= Ts(p) (xp+1 − xp )

s(p)−1

Similarly, we can show that yp ≥K yp+1 for each p. Now, assume that yp − xp ≥K 0 for
some p > 0, then
−1
−1
yp+1 − xp+1 = (Ts(p) yp + Ps(p)
b) − (Ts(p) xp + Ps(p)
b)

= Ts(p) (yp − xp )
= A−1 Tbs(p) A(yp − xp ) ≥K 0.

Again, it follows by induction that yp ≥K xp for each p. Thus, yk ≥K yk+1 ≥K xk+1 ≥K
xk , k = 0, 1, 2, . . ..
(ii) The sequence {xk } is K-monotonic increasing and there exists y0 ∈ Rn such
that y0 − xk ≥K 0 for all k, therefore it converges by Lemma 2.3. Similarly, {−yk } is
K-monotonic increasing and there exists −x0 ∈ Rn such that −x0 + yk ≥K 0 for all k,
therefore it converges by Lemma 2.3. This implies that the sequence {yk } also converges.
Thus, the sequences {xk } and {yk } converge to (I − Ts(k) )−1 P −1 b = P −1 (I − Tbs(k) )−1 b,
s(k)

s(k)

i.e., A b. Hence, yk ≥K yk+1 ≥K A b ≥K xk+1 ≥K xk , k = 0, 1, 2, . . ..

The existence of x0 and y0 which satisfies the inequality (4.1) is guaranteed by the
following result.
Theorem 4.2. Let A = U − V be a K-regular splitting and U = F − G be a K-weak
regular splitting of type II of a K-monotone matrix A such that V F −1 G = GF −1 V . If
ρ(Ts(k) ) < 1, then the existence of x0 and y0 are assured.
Proof. Assume that ρ(Ts(k) ) < 1, then ρ(Tbs(k) ) < 1 by Lemma 3.2. Since Tbs(k) ≥K 0,
there exists x ≥K 0 such that Tbs(k) x = ρ(Ts(k) )x by Theorem 2.2 (i) & (ii). Let z = A−1 x.
Then, z ≥K 0 and Ts(k) z = ρ(Ts(k) )z. Therefore, z ≥K ρ(Ts(k) )z. Let x0 = A−1 b − z. We

≥K A−1 b − z = x0 .
Setting
y0 = A−1 b + z,
it then follows similarly that y0 ≥K y1 . Moreover, y0 − x0 = 2z ≥K 0.
We conclude this section with the remark that if we consider the iteration scheme
Xk+1 = U −1 V Xk + U −1 B, k = 0, 1, 2, · · · ,
then this scheme will converge to A−1 B for any initial matrix X0 if and only if ρ(U −1 V ) <
1. Analogously, the above discussed two-stage technique is also applicable to solve AX =
B. Especially, the system with multiple right-hand side vectors, the splitting algorithms
are advantageous as we need only one splitting for the entire computations and exactly
two splittings for the two-stage iteration method.

5. COVID-19 Pandemic Model & Next Generation
Matrix
The pandemic model is localized, and is highly heterogeneous corresponding to the age
structure and the different stages of disease transmission. A generalized pandemic model
15

considers a heterogeneous population(intra-compartmental) that can be grouped into
n homogeneous compartments(inter-compartmental). Our focus is to identify the next
generation matrix which involves the inverse of an M-matrix [3] in it. We are going to
emphasize on an efficient numerical method to find the inverse of this special matrix. For
the shake of completeness, the next generation matrix (NGM) is crucial in computing the
reproduction number of the pandemic. The basic reproductive number (R0 ) of COVID19 has been initially estimated by the World Health Organization (WHO) that ranges
between 1.4 and 2.5, as declared in the statement regarding the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2,
dated January 23, 2020. Later in [12, 25], the researchers estimated that the mean of R0
is higher than 3.28, and the median is higher than 2.79, by observing the super spreading
nature and the doubling rate of this novel Coronavirus.
Definition 5.1. ([8])
In epidemiology, we take basic reproduction number/ratio, R0 , as the average number of
individuals infected by the single infected individual during his or her entire infectious
period, in a population which is entirely susceptible.
The basic reproduction number is a key parameter in the mathematical modeling of
transmissible diseases. Very recently, Khajanchi and Sarkar [11] considered a compartmental model design to predict the possible infections in the COVID-19 pandemic in India. The model considers six compartment of populations susceptible(S), asymptomatic(I a ),
reported symptomatic(I s ), unreported symptomatic(I u ) and recovered(R). This is called
SAIUQR pandemic model and the same model is reproduced below.

dQ(t) = ξa I a − γq Q − δQ
dR(t) = ηa I a + ηi I s + ηu I u − φR − δR
To be precise, the solutions to the above system of differential equations leave invariant
a certain cone in Rn , where n is the number of compartments. Our mathematical model
introduces some demographic effects by assuming a proportional natural mortality rate
of δ > 0 and birth rate µ per unit time. The parameter β represents the probability
of disease transmission rate. Let αa , αs , and αu be the adjustment factors with the
disease transmission rate. A quarantined population can either move to the susceptible
16

or infected compartment at the rate of ρs . Here, γq is the rate at which the quarantined
uninfected contacts are released into the wider community. The asymptomatic individuals
deplete by reported and unreported symptomatic individuals at the rate γa with a portion
θ ∈ (0, 1), and become quarantine at the rate ξa . Further, ηa , ηi and ηu are the recovery
rate from the asymptomatic, the reported-symptomatic and the unreported-symptomatic
class. A small modification to the existing model is by considering, some people return
from the recovery class, again to the exposed class at the rate of φ. We have the following
matrix B corresponding to the new infection

This matrix is of rank one for the present model but this can be of higher rank (for
example: vector-host Model or two strain model). And one can see that this is a nonlinear
matrix function of time [23]. The matrix associated with the transition terms in the model
is

Here, the matrix A is always an M-matrix. Finally, the next-generation matrix is defined
as BA−1 to compute the pandemic reproduction number R0 = ρ(BA−1 ). For more details
about this threshold number and the special matrix, one can refer [23]. It’s important to
note that these matrices are larger than the 4 × 4 matrix which we have seen so far, in
most of the realistic model.
The model can be modified to understand the impact of social distancing and lockdown
measures on the entire pandemic growth like the model considered in [21] for predicting
the spread of COVID-19 in India. In this model, a social contact matrix is considered
and is partitioned into the home, workplace, school and all other contacts. Our notation
is C for the entire contact matrix partitioned by workplace (C W ), home (C H ), school
(C S ) and others (C O ). Thus, C = C W + C H + C S + C O , where the total contact can be
reduced by controlling all parts except home contact. The lockdown and social distancing
like interventions can be incorporated by multiplying a time-dependent control function
17

with the respective contact. The time-dependent social contact matrix at a time is
Cij (t) = CijH + uW (t)CijW + uS (t)CijS + uO (t)CijO

(5.2)

where uW (t), uS (t) and uO (t) are the control functions corresponding to contact matrices
for work, school and others, depending on the percentage of lockdown implemented on
their contacts.
Further, we consider the age structure of the population, and divide the population
aggregated by age into M groups labeled by i = 1, 2, · · · M. The population within
the age group i is partitioned into susceptible Si , asymptomatic infectives Iia , reported
symptomatic Iis , unreported symptomatic Iiu and removed individuals Ri . The sum of
these is the size of the population in age group i, Ni = Si + Iia + Iis + Iiu + Ri . Therefore,
the total population size is
M
X
Ni = N.
i=1

The contact matrix based on a demographic survey is suggested in [20] that considers
16(= M) different age groups ranging from 1 to 80 age people. So, we have the contact
matrix of order 16 with n number of disease transformation variables. Then, the incidence
function associated with the depletion from susceptible class due to infected individuals
is

the identity matrix. The matrices A and B are block diagonal matrices, and each block

including the fast algorithm for the PageRank problem [16], more general Markov chain

The model parameters are mostly estimated based on the data available from the

COVID-19 spread during the first few days in India. Let us consider a particular set of
19

data experimented in [11], the initial population sizes are
(S, A, Q, I, U, R) = (39402, 1500, 2000, 20, 0, 0)
for a particular state in India. The model parameters are µ = 1200, β = 1.10, αa = 0.264,
αi = 0.76, αu = 0.96, ξa = 0.07151, γa = 0.0012, γq = 0.0015, δ = 0.03, ηa = 1/7.48,
θ = 0.8, ηi = 1/7, ηu = 1/7, ρs = 0.5, and φ = 0.1, as per the prescribed data in [11].
The prescribed data provides us the new infection matrix and disease transition matrix

Finally, we have the basic reproduction number R0 = ρ(BA−1 ) = 3.9327471467109305.
As we have ρ(BA−1 ) = ρ(A−1 B), so instead of computing BA−1 , we can compute A−1 B
to meet our purpose. Our aim is to compute the solution matrix A−1 B for solving the
matrix equation
AX = B

Figure 1: Monotonically increasing and decreasing convergence pattern of the iterative solution to the
exact solution from two different initial approximated vector, which are nonnegative.

The monotonic convergence theorem proved in Section 4 is computationally established
by solving the 4 × 4 linear system (5.7) with multiple Right-Hand Side(RHS). The matrix and both the splittings satisfy all the required conditions mentioned in the theorem.
Also, the initial approximations x0 = [0, 0, 0, 0]T and y0 = [106.5647, 10, 1, 241.9189]T
satisfy the necessary conditions required by Theorem 4.1. Only the first column of the
RHS matrix is used for the two-stage iteration method to generate Fig.1 corresponding
to the iteration numbers. One can observe here, each component of the solution vector
converges monotonically. In (a), the convergence is monotonically increasing. In (b), it
is monotonically decreasing. And one can observe from the above figure that both are
converging to single solution vector A−1 B(:, 1).
Next, our interest is to understand the computational aspect of the two-stage iterative
method using the type-II splittings. Our matrix computations considered the 4 × 4
transition matrix (5.6) of the pandemic model with standard iteration scheme (1.2) and
two-stage iteration scheme (1.5), and similarly an extended 64 × 64 matrix using the
block matrix formulation (5.4) of (5.6). In two-stage Algorithm-1, we have used SOR
type splitting with a relaxation parameter ω. In Table-1, we have compared the standard
iteration scheme with the two-stage standard iteration scheme corresponding to ω = 1
and ω = 1.7. The data listed in table shows that the two-stage iteration scheme for
ω = 1.7 is faster than the standard iteration scheme and the two-stage iteration scheme
21

with ω = 1.
When the condition numbers of the matrices become larger, the two-stage iteration
scheme with ω = 1.7 converges gradually faster than the two-stage iteration scheme
for ω = 1. The condition number is higher when the rate at which the recovered individuals are reinfected (or φ value) in the model is bigger, so we have considered the value of
φ as 0.07, 0.08, 0.09 and 0.10, such that the condition number increase gradually and the
iteration numbers also increase. In Table-1, we have computed condition number only
for 4 × 4 matrices as there is no significant change in condition number for 64 × 64 size
matrices when φ values are same. Similarly, we have computed the spectral radius only
for 64 × 64 size.
