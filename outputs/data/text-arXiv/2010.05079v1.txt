Abstract. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a public health emergency
of international concern affecting more than 200 countries and territories worldwide. As of
September 30, 2020, it has caused a pandemic outbreak with more than 33 million confirmed
infections and more than 1 million reported deaths worldwide. Several statistical, machine
learning, and hybrid models have previously tried to forecast COVID-19 confirmed cases for
profoundly affected countries. Due to extreme uncertainty and nonstationarity in the time
series data, forecasting of COVID-19 confirmed cases has become a very challenging job. For
univariate time series forecasting, there are various statistical and machine learning models
available in the literature. But, epidemic forecasting has a dubious track record. Its failures
became more prominent due to insufficient data input, flaws in modeling assumptions, high
sensitivity of estimates, lack of incorporation of epidemiological features, inadequate past
evidence on effects of available interventions, lack of transparency, errors, lack of determinacy,
and lack of expertise in crucial disciplines. This chapter focuses on assessing different shortterm forecasting models that can forecast the daily COVID-19 cases for various countries.
In the form of an empirical study on forecasting accuracy, this chapter provides evidence to
show that there is no universal method available that can accurately forecast pandemic data.
Still, forecasters’ predictions are useful for the effective allocation of healthcare resources and
will act as an early-warning system for government policymakers.

Introduction

In December 2019, clusters of pneumonia cases caused by the novel Coronavirus
(COVID-19) were identified at the Wuhan, Hubei province in China [58, 48] after
almost hundred years of the 1918 Spanish flu [118]. Soon after the emergence of
the novel beta coronavirus, World Health Organization (WHO) characterized this
contagious disease as a “global pandemic” due to its rapid spread worldwide [99].
Many scientists have attempted to make forecasts about its impact. However, despite
involving many excellent modelers, best intentions, and highly sophisticated tools,
forecasting COVID-19 pandemics is harder [64], and this is primarily due to the
following major factors:
– Very less amount of data is available;
– Less understanding of the factors that contribute to it;
– Model accuracy is constrained by our knowledge of the virus, however. With an
emerging disease such as COVID-19, many transmission-related biologic features
are hard to measure and remain unknown;
– The most obvious source of uncertainty affecting all models is that we don’t know
how many people are or have been infected;

– Ongoing issues with virologic testing mean that we are certainly missing a substantial number of cases, so models fitted to confirmed cases are likely to be
highly uncertain [55];
– The problem of using confirmed cases to fit models is further complicated because
the fraction of confirmed cases is spatially heterogeneous and time-varying [123];
– Finally, many parameters associated with COVID-19 transmission are poorly
understood.
Amid enormous uncertainty about the future of the COVID-19 pandemic, statistical, machine learning, and epidemiological models are critical forecasting tools for
policymakers, clinicians, and public health practitioners [26, 76, 126, 36, 73, 130].
COVID-19 modeling studies generally follow one of two general approaches that
we will refer to as forecasting models and mechanistic models. Although there are
hybrid approaches, these two model types tend to address different questions on
different time scales, and they deal differently with uncertainty [25]. Compartmental epidemiological models have been developed over nearly a century and are well
tested on data from past epidemics. These models are based on modeling the actual
infection process and are useful for predicting long-term trajectories of the epidemic
curves [25]. Short-term Forecasting models are often statistical, fitting a line or
curve to data and extrapolating from there – like seeing a pattern in a sequence of
numbers and guessing the next number, without incorporating the process that produces the pattern [23, 24, 26]. Well constructed statistical frameworks can be used
for short-term forecasts, using machine learning or regression. In statistical models,
the uncertainty of the prediction is generally presented as statistically computed
prediction intervals around an estimate [51, 65]. Given that what happens a month
from now will depend on what happens in the interim, the estimated uncertainty
should increase as you look further into the future. These models yield quantitative
projections that policymakers may need to allocate resources or plan interventions
in the short-term.
Forecasting time series datasets have been a traditional research topic for decades,
and various models have been developed to improve forecasting accuracy [27, 10, 49].
There are numerous methods available to forecast time series, including traditional
statistical models and machine learning algorithms, providing many options for modelers working on epidemiological forecasting [24, 25, 20, 26, 80, 22, 97]. Many research
efforts have focused on developing a universal forecasting model but failed, which
is also evident from the “No Free Lunch Theorem” [125]. This chapter focuses on
assessing popularly used short-term forecasting (nowcasting) models for COVID-19
from an empirical perspective. The findings of this chapter will fill the gap in the
literature of nowcasting of COVID-19 by comparing various forecasting methods, understanding global characteristics of pandemic data, and discovering real challenges
for pandemic forecasters.
The upcoming sections present a collection of recent findings on COVID-19 forecasting. Additionally, twenty nowcasting (statistical, machine learning, and hybrid)
models are assessed for five countries of the United States of America (USA), India,
Brazil, Russia, and Peru. Finally, some recommendations for policy-making decisions
and limitations of these forecasting tools have been discussed.

Researchers face unprecedented challenges during this global pandemic to forecast
future real-time cases with traditional mathematical, statistical, forecasting, and machine learning tools [76, 126, 36, 73, 130]. Studies in March with simple yet powerful
forecasting methods like the exponential smoothing model predicted cases ten days
ahead that, despite the positive bias, had reasonable forecast error [91]. Early linear
and exponential model forecasts for better preparation regarding hospital beds, ICU
admission estimation, resource allocation, emergency funding, and proposing strong
containment measures were conducted [46] that projected about 869 ICU and 14542
ICU admissions in Italy for March 20, 2020. Health-care workers had to go through
the immense mental stress left with a formidable choice of prioritizing young and
healthy adults over the elderly for allocation of life support, mostly unwanted ignoring of those who are extremely unlikely to survive [35, 100]. Real estimates of
mortality with 14-days delay demonstrated underestimating of the COVID-19 outbreak and indicated a grave future with a global case fatality rate (CFR) of 5.7% in
March [13]. The contact tracing, quarantine, and isolation efforts have a differential
effect on the mortality due to COVID-19 among countries. Even though it seems
that the CFR of COVID-19 is less compared to other deadly epidemics, there are
concerns about it being eventually returning as the seasonal flu, causing a second
wave or future pandemic [89, 95].
Mechanistic models, like the Susceptible–Exposed–Infectious–Recovered (SEIR)
frameworks, try to mimic the way COVID-19 spreads and are used to forecast or
simulate future transmission scenarios under various assumptions about parameters
governing the transmission, disease, and immunity [56, 52, 8, 29, 77]. Mechanistic
modeling is one of the only ways to explore possible long-term epidemiologic outcomes [7]. For example, the model from Ferguson et al. [40] that has been used
to guide policy responses in the United States and Britain examines how many
COVID-19 deaths may occur over the next two years under various social distancing
measures. Kissler et al. [70] ask whether we can expect seasonal, recurrent epidemics
if immunity against novel coronavirus functions similarly to immunity against the
milder coronaviruses that we transmit seasonally. In a detailed mechanistic model of
Boston-area transmission, Aleta et al. [4] simulate various lockdown “exit strategies”.
These models are a way to formalize what we know about the viral transmission and
explore possible futures of a system that involves nonlinear interactions, which is almost impossible to do using intuition alone [54, 85]. Although these epidemiological
models are useful for estimating the dynamics of transmission, targeting resources,
and evaluating the impact of intervention strategies, the models require parameters
and depend on many assumptions.
Several statistical and machine learning methods for real-time forecasting of the
new and cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 are developed to overcome limitations of the epidemiological model approaches and assist public health planning and
policy-making [25, 91, 6, 26, 23]. Real-time forecasting with foretelling predictions
is required to reach a statistically validated conjecture in this current health crisis.
Some of the leading-edge research concerning real-time projections of COVID-19
confirmed cases, recovered cases, and mortality using statistical, machine learning,
and mathematical time series modeling are given in Table 1.

Global characteristics of pandemic time series

A univariate time series is the simplest form of temporal data and is a sequence of real
numbers collected regularly over time, where each number represents a value [28, 18].
There are broadly two major steps involved in univariate time series forecasting [60]:
– Studying the global characteristics of the time series data;
– Analysis of data with the ‘best-fitted’ forecasting model.
Understanding the global characteristics of pandemic confirmed cases data can help
forecasters determine what kind of forecasting method will be appropriate for the
given situation [120]. As such, we aim to perform a meaningful data analysis, including the study of time series characteristics, to provide a suitable and comprehensive
knowledge foundation for the future step of selecting an apt forecasting method.
Thus, we take the path of using statistical measures to understand pandemic time
series characteristics to assist method selection and data analysis. These characteristics will carry summarized information of the time series, capturing the ‘global
picture’ of the datasets. Based on the recommendation of [32, 122, 75, 74], we study
several classical and advanced time series characteristics of COVID-19 data. This
study considers eight global characteristics of the time series: periodicity, stationarity, serial correlation, skewness, kurtosis, nonlinearity, long-term dependence, and
chaos. This collection of measures provides quantified descriptions and gives a rich
portrait of the pandemic time-series’ nature. A brief description of these statistical
and advanced time-series measures are given below.
3.1

Periodicity

A seasonal pattern exists when a time series is influenced by seasonal factors, such
as the month of the year or day of the week. The seasonality of a time series is
defined as a pattern that repeats itself over fixed intervals of time [18]. In general,
the seasonality can be found by identifying a large autocorrelation coefficient or a
large partial autocorrelation coefficient at the seasonal lag. Since the periodicity is
very important for determining the seasonality and examining the cyclic pattern of
the time series, the periodicity feature extraction becomes a necessity. Unfortunately,
many time series available from the dataset in different domains do not always have
known frequency or regular periodicity. Seasonal time series are sometimes also called
cyclic series, although there is a significant distinction between them. Cyclic data
have varying frequency lengths, but seasonality is of a fixed length over each period.
For time series with no seasonal pattern, the frequency is set to 1. The seasonality
is tested using the ‘stl’ function within the “stats” package in R statistical software
[60].
3.2

Stationarity

Stationarity is the foremost fundamental statistical property tested for in time series analysis because most statistical models require that the underlying generating
processes be stationary [27]. Stationarity means that a time series (or rather the
process rendering it) do not change over time. In statistics, a unit root test tests

6

T. Chakraborty, I. Ghosh, T. Mahajan, T. Arora

whether a time series variable is non-stationary and possesses a unit root [93]. The
null hypothesis is generally defined as the presence of a unit root, and the alternative
hypothesis is either stationarity, trend stationarity, or explosive root depending on
the test used. In econometrics, Kwiatkowski–Phillips–Schmidt–Shin (KPSS) tests
are used for testing a null hypothesis that an observable time series is stationary
around a deterministic trend (that is, trend-stationary) against the alternative of
a unit root [108]. The KPSS test is done using the ‘kpss.test’ function within the
“tseries” package in R statistical software [117].
3.3

Serial correlation

Serial correlation is the relationship between a variable and a lagged version of itself
over various time intervals. Serial correlation occurs in time-series studies when
the errors associated with a given time period carry over into future time periods
[18]. We have used Box-Pierce statistics [19] in our approach to estimate the serial
correlation measure and extract the measures from COVID-19 data. The Box-Pierce
statistic was designed by Box and Pierce in 1970 for testing residuals from a forecast
model [122]. It is a common portmanteau test for computing the measure. The
mathematical formula of the Box-Pierce statistic is as follows:
Qh = n

h
X

rk2 ,

k=1

where n is the length of the time series, h is the maximum lag being considered
(usually h is chosen as 20), and rk is the autocorrelation function. The portmanteau
test is done using the ‘Box.test’ function within the “stats” package in R statistical
software [63].
3.4

Nonlinearity

Nonlinear time series models have been used extensively to model complex dynamics
not adequately represented by linear models [67]. Nonlinearity is one important
time series characteristic to determine the selection of an appropriate forecasting
method. [115] There are many approaches to test the nonlinearity in time series
models, including a nonparametric kernel test and a Neural Network test [119]. In the
comparative studies between these two approaches, the Neural Network test has been
reported with better reliability [122]. In this research, we used Teräsvirta’s neural
network test [112] for measuring time series data nonlinearity. It has been widely
accepted and reported that it can correctly model the nonlinear structure of the data
[113]. It is a test for neglected nonlinearity, likely to have power against a range of
alternatives based on the NN model (augmented single-hidden-layer feedforward
neural network model). This takes large values when the series is nonlinear and
values near zero when the series is linear. The test is done using the ‘nonlinearityTest’
function within the “nonlinearTseries” package in R statistical software [42].
3.5

Skewness

Skewness is a measure of symmetry, or more precisely, the lack of symmetry. A
distribution, or dataset, is symmetric if it looks the same to the left and the right

Short-term Forecasting of COVID-19

7

of the center point [122]. A skewness measure is used to characterize the degree
of asymmetry of values around the mean value [83]. For univariate data Yt , the
skewness coefficient is
n
3
1 X
S=
Yt − Ȳ ,
3
nσ t=1

where Ȳ is the mean, σ is the standard deviation, and n is the number of data
points. The skewness for a normal distribution is zero, and any symmetric data
should have the skewness near zero. Negative values for the skewness indicate data
that are skewed left, and positive values for the skewness indicate data that are
skewed right. In other words, left skewness means that the left tail is heavier than
the right tail. Similarly, right skewness means the right tail is heavier than the left
tail [69]. Skewness is calculated using the ‘skewness’ function within the “e1071”
package in R statistical software [81].
3.6

Kurtosis (heavy-tails)

Kurtosis is a measure of whether the data are peaked or flat, relative to a normal
distribution [83]. A dataset with high kurtosis tends to have a distinct peak near the
mean, decline rather rapidly, and have heavy tails. Datasets with low kurtosis tend
to have a flat top near the mean rather than a sharp
4 peak. For a univariate time
Pn
1
series Yt , the kurtosis coefficient is nσ4 t=1 Yt − Ȳ . The kurtosis for a standard
normal distribution is 3. Therefore, the excess kurtosis is defined as
n
4
1 X
K=
Yt − Ȳ − 3.
4
nσ t=1

So, the standard normal distribution has an excess kurtosis of zero. Positive kurtosis
indicates a ‘peaked’ distribution and negative kurtosis indicates a ‘flat’ distribution
[47]. Kurtosis is calculated using the ‘kurtosis’ function within the “PerformanceAnalytics” package in R statistical software [90].
3.7

Long-range Dependence

Processes with long-range dependence have attracted a good deal of attention from
a probabilistic perspective in time series analysis [98]. With such increasing importance of the ‘self-similarity’ or ‘long-range dependence’ as one of the time series
characteristics, we study this feature into the group of pandemic data characteristics. The definition of self-similarity is most related to the self-similarity parameter,
also called Hurst exponent (H) [15]. The class of autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average (ARFIMA) processes [44] is a good estimation method for
computing H. In an ARIMA(p, d, q), p is the order of AR, d is the degree first differencing involved, and q is the order of MA. If the time series is suspected of exhibiting
long-range dependency, parameter d may be replaced by certain non-integer values
in the ARFIMA model [21]. We fit an ARFIMA(0, d, 0) to the maximum likelihood,
which is approximated by using the fast and accurate method of Haslett and Raftery
[50]. We then estimate the Hurst parameter using the relation H = d + 0.5. The
self-similarity feature can only be detected in the RAW data of the time series.

8

T. Chakraborty, I. Ghosh, T. Mahajan, T. Arora

The value of H can be obtained using the ‘hurstexp’ function within the “pracma”
package in R statistical software [16].
3.8

Chaos (dynamic systems)

Many systems in nature that were previously considered random processes are now
categorized as chaotic systems. For several years, Lyapunov Characteristic Exponents are of interest in the study of dynamical systems to characterize quantitatively
their stochasticity properties, related essentially to the exponential divergence of
nearby orbits [39]. Nonlinear dynamical systems often exhibit chaos, characterized
by sensitive dependence on initial values, or more precisely by a positive Lyapunov
Exponent (LE) [38]. Recognizing and quantifying chaos in time series are essential steps toward understanding the nature of random behavior and revealing the
extent to which short-term forecasts may be improved [53]. LE, as a measure of
the divergence of nearby trajectories, has been used to qualifying chaos by giving a
quantitative value [14]. The algorithm of computing LE from time-series is applied
to continuous dynamical systems in an n-dimensional phase space [101]. LE is calculated using the ‘Lyapunov exponent’ function within the “tseriesChaos” package
in R statistical software [9].

Popular forecasting methods for pandemic nowcasting

Time series forecasting models work by taking a series of historical observations
and extrapolating future patterns. These are great when the data are accurate; the
future is similar to the past. Forecasting tools are designed to predict possible future
alternatives and help current planing and decision making [10].
There are essentially three general approaches to forecasting a time series [82]:
1. Generating forecasts from an individual model;
2. Combining forecasts from many models (forecast model averaging);
3. Hybrid experts for time series forecasting.
Single (individual) forecasting models are either traditional statistical methods
or modern machine learning tools. We study ten popularly used single forecasting
models from classical time series, advanced statistics, and machine learning literature. There has been a vast literature on the forecast combinations motivated by
the seminal work of Bates & Granger [12] and followed by a plethora of empirical
applications showing that combination forecasts are often superior to their counterparts (see, [17, 114], for example). Combining forecasts using a weighted average
is considered a successful way of hedging against the risk of selecting a misspecified model [31]. A significant challenge is in choosing an appropriate set of weights,
and many attempts to do this have been worse than simply using equal weights –
something that has become known as the “forecast combination puzzle” (see, for
example, [109]). To overcome this, hybrid models became popular with the seminal
work of Zhang [127] and further extended for epidemic forecasting in [24, 26, 23].
The forecasting methods can be briefly reviewed and organized in the architecture
shown in Figure 1.

4.1

Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model

The autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) is one of the well-known
linear models in time-series forecasting, developed in the early 1970s [18]. It is
widely used to track linear tendencies in stationary time-series data. It is denoted
by ARIMA(p, d, q), where the three components have significant meanings. The parameters p and q represent the order of AR and MA models, respectively, and d
denotes the level of differencing to convert nonstationary data into stationary time
series [78]. ARIMA model can be mathematically expressed as follows:
y t = α0 +

p
X
i=1

βi yt−i + ǫt −

q
X

αj ǫt−j ,

j=1

where yt denotes the actual value of the variable at time t, ǫt denotes the random
error at time t, βi and αj are the coefficients of the model. Some necessary steps
to be followed for any given time-series dataset to build an ARIMA model are as
follows:
– Identification of the model (achieving stationarity).
– Use autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial ACF plots to select the AR and
MA model parameters, respectively, and finally estimate model parameters for
the ARIMA model.
– The ‘best-fitted’ forecasting model can be found using the Akaike Information
Criteria (AIC) or the Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC). Finally, one checks
the model diagnostics to measure its performance.

10

An implementation in R statistical software is available using the ‘auto.arima’ function under the “forecast” package, which returns the ‘best’ ARIMA model according
to either AIC or BIC values [61].
4.2

Wavelet-based ARIMA (WARIMA) model

Wavelet analysis is a mathematical tool that can reveal information within the signals in both the time and scale (frequency) domains. This property overcomes the
primary drawback of Fourier analysis, and wavelet transforms the original signal
data (especially in the time domain) into a different domain for data analysis and
processing. Wavelet-based models are most suitable for nonstationary data, unlike
standard ARIMA. Most epidemic time-series datasets are nonstationary; therefore,
wavelet transforms are used as a forecasting model for these datasets [26]. When
conducting wavelet analysis in the context of time series analysis [5], the selection
of the optimal number of decomposition levels is vital to determine the performance
of the model in the wavelet domain. The following formula for the number of decomposition levels, W L = int[log(n)], is used to select the number of decomposition
levels, where n is the time-series length.
The wavelet-based ARIMA (WARIMA) model transforms the time series data
by using a hybrid maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT) algorithm
with a ‘haar’ filter [88]. Daubechies wavelets can produce identical events across the
observed time series in so many fashions that most other time series prediction
models cannot recognize. The necessary steps of a wavelet-based forecasting model,
defined by [5], are as follows. Firstly, the Daubechies wavelet transformation and
a decomposition level are applied to the nonstationary time series data. Secondly,
the series is reconstructed by removing the high-frequency component, using the
wavelet denoising method. Lastly, an appropriate ARIMA model is applied to the
reconstructed series to generate out-of-sample forecasts of the given time series data.
Wavelets were first considered as a family of functions by Morlet [121], constructed
from the translations and dilation of a single function, which is called “Mother
Wavelet”. These wavelets are defined as follows:


t−n
1
φ
φm,n (t) = p
; m, n ∈ R,
m
|m|
where the parameter m (6= 0) is denoted as the scaling parameter or scale, and
it measures the degree of compression. The parameter n is used to determine the
time location of the wavelet, and it is called the translation parameter. If the value
|m| < 1, then the wavelet in m is a compressed version (smaller support is the
time domain) of the mother wavelet and primarily corresponds to higher frequencies, and when |m| > 1, then φ( m, n)(t) has larger time width than φ(t) and corresponds to lower frequencies. Hence wavelets have time width adopted to their
frequencies, which is the main reason behind the success of the Morlet wavelets
in signal processing and time-frequency signal analysis [86]. An implementation of
the WARIMA model is available using the ‘WaveletFittingarma’ function under the
“WaveletArima” package in R statistical software [87].

Autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average (ARFIMA)
model

Fractionally autoregressive integrated moving average or autoregressive fractionally
integrated moving average models are the generalized version ARIMA model in time
series forecasting, which allow non-integer values of the differencing parameter [44].
It may sometimes happen that our time-series data is not stationary, but when we
try differencing with parameter d taking the value to be an integer, it may over
difference it. To overcome this problem, it is necessary to difference the time series
data using a fractional value. These models are useful in modeling time series, which
has deviations from the long-run mean decay more slowly than an exponential decay;
these models can deal with time-series data having long memory [94]. ARFIMA
models can be mathematically expressed as follows:

where B is is the backshift operator, p, q are ARIMA parameters, and d is the
differencing term (allowed to take non-integer values). An R implementation of
ARFIMA model can be done with ‘arfima’ function under the “forecast”package
[61]. An ARFIMA(p, d, q) model is selected and estimated automatically using the
Hyndman-Khandakar (2008) [59] algorithm to select p and q and the Haslett and
Raftery (1989) [50] algorithm to estimate the parameters including d.

Exponential smoothing state space (ETS) model

Exponential smoothing state space methods are very effective methods in case of
time series forecasting. Exponential smoothing was proposed in the late 1950s [124]
and has motivated some of the most successful forecasting methods. Forecasts produced using exponential smoothing methods are weighted averages of past observations, with the weights decaying exponentially as the observations get older. The
ETS models belong to the family of state-space models, consisting of three-level components such as an error component (E), a trend component (T), and a seasonal
component(S). This method is used to forecast univariate time series data. Each
model consists of a measurement equation that describes the observed data, and
some state equations that describe how the unobserved components or states (level,
trend, seasonal) change over time [60]. Hence, these are referred to as state-space
models. The flexibility of the ETS model lies in its ability to trend and seasonal components of different traits. Errors can be of two types: Additive and Multiplicative.
Trend Component can be any of the following: None, Additive, Additive Damped,
Multiplicative and Multiplicative Damped. Seasonal Component can be of three
types: None, Additive, and Multiplicative. Thus, there are 15 models with additive
errors and 15 models with multiplicative errors. To determine the best model of 30
ETS models, several criteria such as Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC), Akaike’s
Information Criterion correction (AICc), and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)
can be used [59]. An R implementation of the model is available in the ‘ets’ function
under “forecast” package [61].

Self-exciting threshold autoregressive (SETAR) model

As an extension of autoregressive model, Self-exciting threshold autoregressive (SETAR) model is used to model time series data, in order to allow for higher degree of
flexibility in model parameters through a regime switching behaviour [116]. Given
a time-series data yt , the SETAR model is used to predict future values, assuming
that the behavior of the time series changes once the series enters a different regime.
This switch from one to another regime depends on the past values of the series.
The model consists of k autoregressive (AR) parts, each for a different regime. The
model is usually denoted as SETAR (k, p) where k is the number of threshold, there
are k +1 number of regime in the model and p is the order of the autoregressive part.
For example, suppose an AR(1) model is assumed in both regimes, then a 2-regime
SETAR model is given by [41]:
yt = φ0,1 + φ1,1 yt−1 + ǫt if yt−1 ≤ c,
= φ0,2 + φ1,2 yt−1 + ǫt if yt−1 > c,

(1)

where for the moment the ǫt are assumed to be an i.i.d. white noise sequence conditional upon the history of the time series and c is the threshold value. The SETAR
model assumes that the border between the two regimes is given by a specific value
of the threshold variable yt−1 . The model can be implemented using ‘setar’ function
under the “tsDyn” package in R [34].
4.6

Bayesian structural time series (BSTS) model

Bayesian Statistics has many applications in the field of statistical techniques such
as regression, classification, clustering, and time series analysis. Scott and Varian
[105] used structural time series models to show how Google search data can be
used to improve short-term forecasts of economic time series. In the structural time
series model, the observation in time t, yt is defined as follows:
yt = XtT βt + ǫt
where βt is the vector of latent variables, Xt is the vector of model parameters, and
ǫt are assumed follow Normal distributions with zero mean and Ht as the variance.
In addition, βt is represented as follows:
βt+1 = St βt + Rt δt ,
where δt are assumed to follow Normal distributions with zero mean and Qt as the
variance. Gaussian distribution is selected as the prior of the BSTS model since we
use the occurred frequency values ranging from 0 to ∞ [66]. An R implementation
is available under the “bsts” package [103], where one can add local linear trend and
seasonal components as required. The state specification is passed as an argument to
‘bsts’ function, along with the data and the desired number of Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) iterations, and the model is fit using an MCMC algorithm [104].

Theta model

The ‘Theta method’ or ‘Theta model’ is a univariate time series forecasting technique that performed particularly well in M3 forecasting competition and of interest
to forecasters [11]. The method decomposes the original data into two or more lines,
called theta lines, and extrapolates them using forecasting models. Finally, the predictions are combined to obtain the final forecasts. The theta lines can be estimated
by simply modifying the ‘curvatures’ of the original time series [110]. This change
is obtained from a coefficient, called θ coefficient, which is directly applied to the
second differences of the time series:
”
”
Ynew
(θ) = θYdata
,

(2)

”
where Ydata
= Yt − 2Yt−1 + Yt−2 at time t for t = 3, 4, · · · , n and {Y1 , Y2 , · · · , Yn }
denote the observed univariate time series. In practice, coefficient θ can be considered
as a transformation parameter which creates a series of the same mean and slope
with that of the original data but having different variances. Now, Eqn. (2) is a
second-order difference equation and has solution of the following form [62]:

Ynew (θ) = aθ + bθ (t − 1) + θYt ,

(3)

where aθ and bθ are constants and t = 1, 2, · · · , n. Thus, Ynew (θ) is equivalent to a
linear function of Yt with a linear trend added. The values of aθ and bθ are computed
by minimizing the sum of squared differences:
t
X
i=1

2

[Yt − Ynew (θ)] =

t
X
i=1

[(1 − θ)Yt − aθ − bθ (t − 1)]2 .

(4)

Forecasts from the Theta model are obtained by a weighted average of forecasts
of Ynew (θ) for different values of θ. Also, the prediction intervals and likelihoodbased estimation of the parameters can be obtained based on a state-space model,
demonstrated in [62]. An R implementation of the Theta model is possible with
‘thetaf’ function in “forecast” package [61].
4.8

TBATS model

The main objective of TBATS model is to deal with complex seasonal patterns using
exponential smoothing [33]. The name is acronyms for key features of the models:
Trigonometric seasonality (T), Box-Cox Transformation (B), ARMA errors (A),
Trend (T) and Seasonal (S) components. TBATS makes it easy for users to handle
data with multiple seasonal patterns. This model is preferable when the seasonality
changes over time [60]. TBATS models can be described as follows:
(µ)

where yt is the time series at time point t (Box-Cox Transformed), st is the

the ARMA(p, q) process for residuals and et as the Gaussian white noise. TBATS
model can be implemented using ‘tbats’ function under the “forecast” package in R
statistical software [61].
4.9

Artificial neural networks (ANN) model

Forecasting with artificial neural networks (ANN) has received increasing interest
in various research and applied domains in the late 1990s. It has been given special
attention in epidemiological forecasting [92]. Multi-layered feed-forward neural networks with back-propagation learning rules are the most widely used models with
applications in classification and prediction problems [129]. There is a single hidden
layer between the input and output layers in a simple feed-forward neural net, and
where weights connect the layers. Denoting by ωji the weights between the input
layer and hidden layer and νkj denotes the weights between the hidden and output
layers. Based on the given inputs xi , the neuron’s net input is calculated as the
weighted sum of its inputs. The output layer of the neuron, yj , is based on a sigmoidal function indicating the magnitude of this net-input [43]. For the j th hidden
neuron, the calculation for the net input and output are:
nethj

with λ ∈ (0, 1) is a parameter used to control the gradient of the function and J is
the number of neurons in the hidden layer. The back-propagation [102] learning algorithm is the most commonly used technique in ANN. In the error back-propagation
step, the weights in ANN are updated by minimizing

where, dpk is the desired output of neuron k and for input pattern√p. The common

formula for number of neurons in the hidden layer is h = (i+j)
2
the number of hidden neurons, where i is the number of output yj and d denotes
the number of i training patterns in the input xi [128]. The application of ANN for
time series data is possible with ‘mlp’ function under ”nnfor” package in R [72].

Autoregressive neural network (ARNN) model

Autoregressive neural network (ARNN) received attention in time series literature
in late 1990s [37]. The architecture of a simple feedforward neural network can be
described as a network of neurons arranged in input layer, hidden layer, and output
layer in a prescribed order. Each layer passes the information to the next layer
using weights that are obtained using a learning algorithm [128]. ARNN model is a
modification to the simple ANN model especially designed for prediction problems
of time series datasets [37]. ARNN model uses a pre-specified number of lagged
values of the time series as inputs and number of hidden neurons in its architecture
is also fixed [60]. ARNN(p, k) model uses p lagged inputs of the time series data in
a one hidden layered feedforward neural network with k hidden units in the hidden
layer. Let x denotes a p-lagged inputs and f is a neural network of the following
architecture:
k
X

f (x) = c0 +
(5)
wj φ aj + b′j x ;
j=1

where c0 , aj , wj are connecting weights, bj are p-dimensional weight vector and φ is
a bounded nonlinear sigmoidal function (e.g., logistic squasher function or tangent
hyperbolic activation function). These Weights are trained using a gradient descent
backpropagation [102]. Standard ANN faces the dilemma to choose the number of
hidden neurons in the hidden layer and optimal choice is unknown. But for ARNN
model, we adopt the formula k = [(p+1)/2] for non-seasonal time series data where p
is the number of lagged inputs in an autoregressive model [60]. ARNN model can be
applied using the ‘nnetar’ function available in the R statistical package “forecast”
[61].
4.11

Ensemble forecasting models

The idea of ensemble time series forecasts was given by Bates and Granger (1969)
in their seminal work [12]. Forecasts generated from ARIMA, ETS, Theta, ARNN,
WARIMA can be combined with equal weights, weights based on in-sample errors, or
cross-validated weights. In the ensemble framework, cross-validation for time series
data with user-supplied models and forecasting functions is also possible to evaluate model accuracy [106]. Combining several candidate models can hedge against
an incorrect model specification. Bates and Granger(1969) [12] suggested such an
approach and observed, somewhat surprisingly, that the combined forecast can even
outperform the single best component forecast. While combination weights selected
equally or proportionally to past model errors are possible approaches, many more
sophisticated combination schemes, have been suggested. For example, rather than
normalizing weights to sum to unity, unconstrained and even negative weights could
be possible [45]. The simple equal-weights combination might appear woefully obsolete and probably non-competitive compared to the multitude of sophisticated
combination approaches or advanced machine learning and neural network forecasting models, especially in the age of big data. However, such simple combinations
can still be competitive, particularly for pandemic time series [106]. A flow diagram
of the ensemble method is presented in Figure 2.

16

Fig. 2. Flow diagram of the ensemble model where M1, M2, and M3 are three different univariate time
series models

The ensemble method by [12] produces forecasts out to a horizon h by applying
a weight wm to each m of the n model forecasts in the ensemble. The ensemble
forecast f (i) for time horizon 1 ≤ i ≤ h and with individual component model
forecasts fm (i) is then
n
X
f (i) =
wm fm (i).
m=1

The weights can be determined in several ways (for example, supplied by the user,
set equally, determined by in-sample errors, or determined by cross-validation). The
“forecastHybrid” package in R includes these component models in order to enhance the “forecast” package base models with easy ensembling (e.g., ‘hybridModel’
function in R statistical software) [107].

4.12

Hybrid forecasting models

The idea of hybridizing time series models and combining different forecasts was
first introduced by Zhang [127] and further extended by [68, 24, 26, 23]. The hybrid
forecasting models are based on an error re-modeling approach, and there are broadly
two types of error calculations popular in the literature, which are given below
[84, 30]:
Definition 1. In the additive error model, the forecaster treats the expert’s estimate
as a variable, Ŷt , and thinks of it as the sum of two terms:
Ŷt = Yt + et ,
where Yt is the true value and et be the additive error term.
Definition 2. In the multiplicative error model, the forecaster treats the expert’s
estimate Ŷt as the product of two terms:
Ŷt = Yt × et ,
where Yt is the true value and et be the multiplicative error term.

Short-term Forecasting of COVID-19

17

Now, even if the relationship is of product type, in the log-log scale it becomes
additive. Hence, without loss of generality, we may assume the relationship to be
additive and expect errors (additive) of a forecasting model to be random shocks [23].
These hybrid models are useful for complex correlation structures where less amount
of knowledge is available about the data generating process. A simple example is the
daily confirmed cases of the COVID-19 cases for various countries where very little is
known about the structural properties of the current pandemic. The mathematical
formulation of the proposed hybrid model (Zt ) is as follows:
Zt = Lt + Nt ,
where Lt is the linear part and Nt is the nonlinear part of the hybrid model. We can
estimate both Lt and Nt from the available time series data. Let L̂t be the forecast
value of the linear model (e.g., ARIMA) at time t and ǫt represent the error residuals
at time t, obtained from the linear model. Then, we write
ǫt = Zt − L̂t .
These left-out residuals are further modeled by a nonlinear model (e.g., ANN or
ARNN) and can be represented as follows:
ǫt = f (ǫt−1 , ǫt−2 , ..., ǫt−p ) + εt ,
where f is a nonlinear function, and the modeling is done by the nonlinear ANN or
ARNN model as defined in Eqn. (5) and εt is supposed to be the random shocks.
Therefore, the combined forecast can be obtained as follows:
Ẑt = L̂t + N̂t ,
where N̂t is the forecasted value of the nonlinear time series model. An overall flow
diagram of the proposed hybrid model is given in Figure 3. In the hybrid model,
a nonlinear model is applied in the second stage to re-model the left-over autocorrelations in the residuals, which the linear model could not model. Thus, this can
be considered as an error re-modeling approach. This is important because due to
model misspecification and disturbances in the pandemic rate time series, the linear
models may fail to generate white noise behavior for the forecast residuals. Thus,
hybrid approaches eventually can improve the predictions for the epidemiological
forecasting problems, as shown in [24, 26, 23]. These hybrid models only assume
that the linear and nonlinear components of the epidemic time series can be separated individually. The implementation of the hybrid models used in this study are
available in [1].

Experimental analysis

Five time series COVID-19 datasets for the USA, India, Russia, Brazil, and Peru
UK are considered for assessing twenty forecasting models (individual, ensemble,
and hybrid). The datasets are mostly nonlinear, nonstationary, and non-gaussian in
nature. We have used root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE),
mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and symmetric MAPE (SMAPE) to evaluate the predictive performance of the models used in this study. Since the number
of data points in both the datasets is limited, advanced deep learning techniques
will over-fit the datasets [51].
5.1

Datasets

We use publicly available datasets to compare various forecasting frameworks. COVID19 cases of five countries with the highest number of cases were collected [2, 3]. The

Global characteristics

Characteristics of these five time series were examined using Hurst exponent, KPSS
test and Terasvirta test and other measures as described in Section 3. Hurst exponent

Short-term Forecasting of COVID-19

19

(denoted by H), which ranges between zero to one, is calculated to measure the longrange dependency in a time series and provides a measure of long-term nonlinearity.
For values of H near zero, the time series under consideration is mean-reverting.
An increase in the value will be followed by a decrease in the series and vice versa.
When H is close to 0.5, the series has no autocorrelation with past values. These
types of series are often called Brownian motion. When H is near one, an increase
or decrease in the value is most likely to be followed by a similar movement in the
future. All the five COVID-19 datasets in this study possess the Hurst exponent
value near one, which indicates that these time series datasets have a strong trend
of increase followed by an increase or decrease followed by another decline.
KPSS tests are performed to examine the stationarity of a given time series.
The null hypothesis for the KPSS test is that the time series is stationary. Thus,
the series is nonstationary when the p-value less than a threshold. From Table 3,
all the five datasets can be characterized as non-stationary as the p-value < 0.01
in each instances. Terasvirta test examines the linearity of a time series against the
alternative that a nonlinear process has generated the series. It is observed that the
USA, Russia, and Peru COVID-19 datasets are likely to follow a nonlinear trend.
On the other hand, India and Brazil datasets have some linear trends.

Further, we examine serial correlation, skewness, kurtosis, and maximum Lyapunov exponent for the five COVID-19 datasets. The results are reported in Table 4.
The serial correlation of the datasets is computed using the Box-Pierce test statistic
for the null hypothesis of independence in a given time series. The p-values related
to each of the datasets were found to be below the significant level (see Table 4).
This indicates that these COVID-19 datasets have no serial correlation when lag
equals one. Skewness for Russia COVID-19 dataset is found to be negative, whereas
the other four datasets are positively skewed. This means for the Russia dataset;
the left tail is heavier than the right tail. For the other four datasets, the right tail
is heavier than the left tail. The Kurtosis values for the India dataset are found
positive while the other four datasets have negative kurtosis values. Therefore, the
COVID-19 dataset of India tends to have a peaked distribution, and the other four
datasets may have a flat distribution. We observe that each of the five datasets is
non-chaotic in nature, i.e., the maximum Lyapunov exponents are less than unity.
A summary of the implementation tools is presented in Table 5.

Analysis of results

This subsection is devoted to the experimental analysis of confirmed COVID-19
cases using different time series forecasting models. The test period is chosen to
be 15 days and 30 days, whereas the rest of the data is used as training data (see
Table 2). In first columns of Tables 6 and 7, we present training data and test
data for USA, India, Brazil, Russia and Peru. The autocorrelation function (ACF)
and partial autocorrelation function (PACF) plots are also depicted for the training
period of each of the five countries in Tables 6 and 7. ACF and PACF plots are
generated after applying the required number of differencing of each training data
using the r function ‘diff’. The required order of differencing is obtained by using
the R function ‘ndiffs’ which estimate the number of differences required to make

Short-term Forecasting of COVID-19

21

a given time series stationary. The integer-valued order of differencing is then used
as the value of ’d’ in the ARIMA(p, d, q) model. Other two parameters ‘p’ and ‘q’
of the model are obtained from ACF and PACF plots respectively (see Tables 6
and 7). However, we choose the ‘best’ fitted ARIMA model using AIC value for
each training dataset. Table 6 presents the training data (black colored) and test
data (red-colored) and corresponding ACF and PACF plots for the five time-series
datasets.

30-days ahead forecasts were generated for each model, and accuracy metrics were

computed to determine the best predictive models. From the ten popular single
models, we choose the best one based on the accuracy metrics. On the other hand,
one hybrid/ensemble model is selected from the rest of the ten models. The bestfitted ARIMA parameters, ETS, ARNN, and ARFIMA models for each country are
reported in the respective tables. Table 7 presents the training data (black colored)
and test data (red-colored) and corresponding plots for the five datasets. Twenty
forecasting models are implemented on these pandemic time-series datasets. Table 5
gives the essential details about the functions and packages required for implementation.

Results for USA COVID-19 data: Among the single models, ARIMA(2,1,4)
performs best in terms of accuracy metrics for 15-days ahead forecasts. TBATS
and ARNN(16,8) also have competitive accuracy metrics. Hybrid ARIMA-ARNN
model improves the earlier ARIMA forecasts and has the best accuracy among all
hybrid/ensemble models (see Table 8). Hybrid ARIMA-WARIMA also does a good
job and improves ARIMA model forecasts. In-sample and out-of-sample forecasts
obtained from ARIMA and hybrid ARIMA-ARNN models are depicted in Fig. 4(a).
Out-of-sample forecasts are generated using the whole dataset as training data.

Results from all the five datasets reveal that none of the forecasting models
performs uniformly, and therefore, one should be carefully select the appropriate
forecasting model while dealing with COVID-19 datasets.

Discussions

In this study, we assessed several statistical, machine learning, and composite models on the confirmed cases of COVID-19 data sets for the five countries with the
highest number of cases. Thus, COVID-19 cases in the USA, followed by India,
Brazil, Russia, and Peru, are considered. The datasets mostly exhibit nonlinear and
nonstationary behavior. Twenty forecasting models were applied to five datasets,
and an empirical study is presented here. The empirical findings suggest no universal method exists that can outperform every other model for all the datasets in
COVID-19 nowcasting. Still, the future forecasts obtained from models with the best
accuracy will be useful in decision and policy makings for government officials and
policymakers to allocate adequate health care resources for the coming days in responding to the crisis. However, we recommend updating the datasets regularly and
comparing the accuracy metrics to obtain the best model. As this is evident from
this empirical study that no model can perform consistently as the best forecasting
model, one must update the datasets regularly to generate useful forecasts. Time
series of epidemics can oscillate heavily due to various epidemiological factors, and
these fluctuations are challenging to be captured adequately for precise forecasting.
All five different countries, except Brazil and Peru, will face a diminishing trend
in the number of new confirmed cases of COVID-19 pandemic. Followed by the both
short-term out of sample forecasts reported in this study, the lockdown and shutdown periods can be adjusted accordingly to handle the uncertain and vulnerable
situations of the COVID-19 pandemic. Authorities and health care can modify their
planning in stockpile and hospital-beds, depending on these COVID-19 pandemic
forecasts.

Models are constrained by what we know and what we assume but used appropriately, and with an understanding of these limitations, they can and should help
guide us through this pandemic. Since purely statistical approaches do not account
for how transmission occurs, they are generally not well suited for long-term predictions about epidemiological dynamics (such as when the peak will occur and whether
resurgence will happen) or inference about intervention efficacy. Several forecasting
models, therefore, limit their projections to two weeks or a month ahead.

Conclusion and Future Challenges

In this research, we have focused on analyzing the nature of the COVID-19 time series data and understanding the data characteristics of the time series. This empirical
work studied a wide range of statistical forecasting methods and machine learning
algorithms. We have also presented more systematic representations of single, ensemble, and hybrid approaches available for epidemic forecasting. This quantitative
study could be used to assess and forecast COVID-19 confirmed cases, which will
benefit epidemiologists and modelers in their real-world applications.
Considering this scope of the study, we can present a list of challenges of pandemic forecasting (short-term) with the forecasting tools presented in this chapter:
– Collect more data on the factors that contribute to daily confirmed cases of
COVID-19.
– model the entire predictive distribution, with particular focus on accurately quantifying uncertainty [55].
– There is no universal model that can generate ‘best’ short-term forecasts of
COVID-19 confirmed cases.
– Continuously monitor the performance of any model against real data and either
re-adjust or discard models based on accruing evidence.
– Developing models in real-time for a novel virus, with poor quality data, is a
formidable task and real challenge for epidemic forecasters.
– Epidemiological estimates and compartmental models can be useful for longterm pandemic trajectory prediction, but they often assume some unrealistic
assumptions [64].
– Future research is needed to collect, clean, and curate data and develop a coherent approach to evaluate the suitability of models with regard to COVID-19
predictions and forecast uncertainties.
