Abstract: Pneumonia is one of the foremost lung diseases and untreated pneumonia will lead to serious
threats for all age groups. The proposed work aims to extract and evaluate the Coronavirus disease
(COVID-19) caused pneumonia infection in lung using CT scans. We propose an image-assisted system
to extract COVID-19 infected sections from lung CT scans (coronal view). It includes following steps:
(i) Threshold filter to extract the lung region by eliminating possible artifacts; (ii) Image enhancement
using Harmony-Search-Optimization and Otsu thresholding; (iii) Image segmentation to extract infected
region(s); and (iv) Region-of-interest (ROI) extraction (features) from binary image to compute level of
severity. The features that are extracted from ROI are then employed to identify the pixel ratio between
the lung and infection sections to identify infection level of severity. The primary objective of the tool is
to assist the pulmonologist not only to detect but also to help plan treatment process. As a consequence,
for mass screening processing, it will help prevent diagnostic burden.

1. Introduction
The increased medical facility in the modern era is committed to provide a better living atmosphere
to the human community by preventing life-threatening diseases. Due to various uncontrolled and
unavoidable reasons, communicable and chronic diseases in humans are gradually rising globally. Most
of these diseases can be controlled and completely cured when it is identified in its premature stage.
When disease symptom is experienced, the patient approaches the hospital for the diagnosis to identify
the cause, nature and the severity of the disease.
The disease in the internal body organs are very acute compared to other illnesses and hence, more
diagnostic methods are recommended and implemented to identify the disease and its severity to plan
for an appropriate treatment procedure to control the disease. In human physiology, the lung is one of
the prime organs responsible to circulate the air and the infection/disease in lung will severely affect the

respiratory system and the untreated lung disease will lead to death. The major causes of lung defects are
due to diseases, such as tuberculosis, lung-cancer, and pneumonia [1,2]. Further, the infection in lungs
due to microorganisms, such as bacteria, virus and fungi may cause mild to harsh illness; which may
require instantaneous medical support to cure the disease.
When a patient is admitted to the hospital due to respiratory infection, the pulmonologist will
recommend a series of diagnostic procedures ranging from the non-laboratory to laboratory tests to
identify the cause, location, and severity of the infection. The laboratory tests include common
procedures, like complete-blood-count, blood-gas-analysis and pleural-fluid-analysis [3,4]. The nonlaboratory tests are mainly the image assisted techniques used to record or inspect the lung regions using
chest radiography (X-ray), Computed-Tomography (CT) scan and bronchoscope. Due to its non-invasive
nature, the chest X-ray and CT are commonly used to record the digital images of the lungs, which can be
further examined by an experienced doctor or a computer-supported system to identify the severity of
the infection. Compared to the chest X-ray, the CT Scan Images (CTSI) is widely preferred due to its merit
and the three-dimensional view of the lung; which further can be used to provide 2D images of axial,
coronal and Sagittal-View for the better diagnosis. The recent studies also confirmed the merit of the CT
in detecting the infection in the respiratory tract and pneumonia [5].
The objective of the proposed work is to develop an image processing procedure to extract the
infected section of COVID-19from lung CTSI. The recent studies on COVID-19 infection confirmed that,
the assessment of disease severity rate is essential to plan for the appropriate treatment to cure the
patients. In real-time scenarios, infected regions from the bio-imaging methods, such as CT and chest
radiographs are assessed by an experienced doctor and based on the recommendation; possible treatment
procedures are suggested and implemented to reduce the infection level. The personal detection with an
experienced doctor will be a tedious task when the number of patients is large and hence, it is necessary
to develop an automated/semi-automated image processing procedure to assist the doctor to examine the
lung images of the patients. This procedure will considerably reduce the diagnostic burden of the doctor
by segregating the lung CTSI based on the severity level. Further, this procedure also will assist the
doctor to track the changes in infection rate (reduction/progress in infection) when the treatment is
implemented.
The current literature on COVID-19 confirms that the disease infection rate in a patient is normally
performed with lung CT/X-ray images and correct detection of the infection level is very essential to plan
for an appropriate treatment process. The infection visibility in chest X-ray is very poor and it needs the
expertise to identify and understand the information; hence in most of the recent works; CTSI is preferred
compared to the chest X-ray. Further, the work of Li et al. [6] also suggested that, visual quantitative
analysis using the CTSI provided good reliability and better diagnostic capability. Hence, the proposed
work considered the coronal-view of the two-dimensional CTSI for the experimental investigation. The
proposed study is investigated in the MATLAB® environment and the essential CTSI of COVID-19 is
collected from the Radiopedia database [7].
This work implements a series of procedures, such as threshold filtering, multi-thresholding,
segmentation and area feature extraction to detect the COVID-19 pneumonia infection from the
considered CTSI. After extracting the infected region with better accuracy, the infection stage is then
computed using the ratio of pixels in the infection/lung section. This Severity-Level-Measure (SLM) is
then considered to short the existing patient’s CTSI and the image that has a higher value of SLM will be
sent to the pulmonologist for the approval. The pulmonologist will also perform a visual check on the
CTSI, and as per the findings, the appropriate treatment will be initiated.
The remaining part of this research is presented as follows; section 2 discusses the existing works on
the COVID-19 database, section 3 outlines the methodology implemented, sections 4 and 5 present the
experimental outcome and the conclusion, respectively.

2. Related Works on COVID-19 Infection
COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Corona Virus2 (SARS-CoV-2) and this sickness is first revealed in China (Wuhan) in December 2019 [7, 8]. Due to the
outbreak, COVID-19 has emerged as a global challenge and a significant number of research works are
initiated to discover the solution to control the infection rate and spreading of the COVID-19 [9].
Due to its significance, a significant amount of research works are proposed to assess pneumonia
caused by COVID-19 and the severity of this infection is to be accounted to take the decision regarding;
(i) Treatment procedure to be followed and (ii) The choice of the drug and its dosage level. The noninvasive image assisted detection procedures are followed in the hospitals to detect the severity of the
COVID-19 pneumonia and the imaging modalities, such as CT and Chest X-ray are widely considered.
The information seen in CT is more clear compared to the Chest X-ray and hence, this research work
considered only the CTSI for the examination, Moreover, the resent findings by [10] confirmed that the
CT offers better judgment accuracy compared to the laboratory level detection process called Reverse
transcription-polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). The recent procedures to detect COVID-19
pneumonia using the CTSI are summarized in Table 1.

Due to its significance, recently researchers proposed a considerable number of COVID-19
prediction and detection procedures [21-23]. The recent work of Rodriguez-Morales et al. [24] presents a
detailed review of the detection and prediction of COVID-19 pneumonia infection. The existing
identification procedures involves in laboratory level detection using RT-PCR and physical assessment of
CTSI using an experienced radiologist. The computerized detection procedure is essential to reduce the
assessment burden of the radiologist and support the fast and accurate decision-making process.
The proposed research work aims to develop an image-assisted procedure to detect and extract
the COVID-19 infected section from the CTSI. This work initially considered the coronal-view of the CTSI
for the assessment and later, a similar procedure is executed to evaluate the axial-view of CTSI. The
proposed work also proposed a methodology to detect the average infection rate by considering the pixel
information of the infected section and the lung section. The ratio between the pixels of the infected and
lung segments is considered to examine the severity of the COVID-19 pneumonia.
3. Materials and Methods
This part of the study discusses the proposed method implemented to detect the pneumonia
infection from CTSI. The various stages involved in the proposed technique are presented in Figure 1.
Initially, the two-dimensional CTSI is collected from the benchmark database. The CTSI is associated with
the lung section along with the artifacts, such as the bone and other body sections. The threshold filler
discussed in Bhandary et al. [4] is then implemented to separate the lung from the artifact. Later, a multithreshold based on Otsu function and Harmony-Search-Optimization (HSO) is implemented to enhance
the visibility of the infected lung segment. The enhanced section is then extracted using watershed
segmentation. Finally, the pixel values of the binary images of infected and the lung region are
considered to compute the severity rate.

Dataset3

Dataset2

Dataset1

The COVID-19 is a new class of infection, which causes mild to severe pneumonia according to the
infection rate and the age of the individuals [5, 18-20]. The existing clinical level detection of the infection
involves laboratory analysis with RT-PCR and imaging-based detection with CTSI and chest X-ray. Due
to various restrictions, the collection of the radiology images from patients is a challenging task; further,
the COVID-19 is a new category of disease and hence the image database existing is very limited.
The proposed work considered the images of the Radiopedia database for the evaluation [7].
Radiopedia shared the clinical-grade chest X-ray and CTSI for the research purpose. This work used the
clinical-grade CTSI of coronal-view images of case studies, such as 1 [25], 4 [26], 5 [27], 7 [28], 15 [29], 38
[30], 39 [31], and 45 [32] for the experimental investigation. Along with the above said images, CTSI of
case study 30 [33] is also considered to test the performance of the proposed procedure on the axial-view
images. From each case study, ten numbers of 2D CTSI are extracted and examined. Further, this work
also considered the COVID-19 images available in [34] for the examination. This dataset consist the axial
and coronal-view of the CTSI recorded with and without the contrast agent.
This work considered 90 2D slices of coronal-view (9 patients x 10slices = 90 slices) and 20 2D slices
of axial-view (2 patients x 10slices = 20slices) CTSI for the experimental investigation. The sample test
images of the coronal-view CTSI is depicted in figure 2 and the dimension of the images are considered
as given in the Radiopedia database.

3.2 Threshold filter
The accuracy in the medical image evaluation depends mainly on the images considered for the
examination. In this work, the artifacts (bone and other body segments) existing in the considered test
image is initially removed using the threshold filter discussed in [4]. The concept of this filter is simple
and it separates the test image into two sections based on the chosen threshold value. In this work, the
threshold values are selected manually by trial and error analysis and the chosen threshold then works
well on all the images considered in the proposed study.

The considered images can be exactly separated based on its pixels, when the threshold is chosen as
184 (i.e. < 184 = lung and >184 is artifact). The results attained with the threshold filter are depicted in
figure 3. Fig 3(a) depicts the original test image and the gray histogram; and Fig 3(b) and (c) depict the
image and histograms of the lung and the artifacts, respectively. The similar threshold values are
considered for other test images, in this study.
3.3 Image enhancement
In the literature, a number of medical image enhancement procedures are available to pre-process
the test images. This work employed the three-level threshold-based enhancement of medical imaging
procedure discussed in the recent works [35,36]. This pre-processing procedure will enhance the test
image by grouping alike pixels of the background, normal lung fragment and the COVID-19 infection. In
this work, Harmony-Search-Optimization (HSO) algorithm is implemented to find the optimal threshold
due to its simplicity and lesser tuning parameters. Initially, the threshold selection is done using the
entropy techniques [35,36] and Otsu between-class function [37] and the enhancement achieved with
Otsu is superior compared to other technique. Hence, the entire work is executed using the HSO + Otsu.
The essential information on the thresholding can be found in the earlier works of Oliva et al. [38] and
Cuevas et al. [39]. This work considered the HSO+Otsu based threshold implemented in [38-40]. Other
information on Otsu thresholding can be found in the earlier research works available in [41].
3.4 Segmentation of Pneumonia Infection
In the medical image examination problem, the extraction of the abnormal section from the test
image is essential for further assessment. The extraction of an abnormal section is normally done using a
chosen image segmentation procedure and, in this work, an automated segmentation procedure called
the watershed technique is implemented. The watershed approach implements a series of techniques,
such as edge detection, morphological operation, image-fill, enhancement, and extraction. The recent
work of Bhandary et al. [4] confirms that the watershed technique helped to extract the abnormal section
from the CTSI with better accuracy. The extracted abnormal section is in the form of the binary in which
the background is assigned with a value ‘0’ and the extracted region is assigned with ‘1’ and this section
is considered for further assessment, if necessary.

3.5 Severity Level Computation
The hospital level examination of the COVID-19 is performed with a laboratory test: RT-PCR to
confirm the infection. After admitting the patient, the imaging procedures, such as CT/X-ray data are
considered to identify infected section and its level of severity. Based on the severity level, the
appropriate treatment procedure is to be planned which involves in the need for the assisting devices,
monitoring devices, and the choice of the drug and its dosage level. Further, the imaging procedure also
assists the pulmonologist to confirm the recovery of the patient with respect to the treatment currently
implemented. For each patient, the imaging procedure is to be followed for a considerable number of
times to record and confirm the recovery. A personal analysis of the CTSI with an experienced radiologist
is essential for an accurate diagnosis. The increase in patient’s rate will improve the diagnostic burden of
the radiologist and hence a computer-supported assisting methodology is essential to get the preliminary
diagnosis regarding the pneumonia infection. In this work, an image assisted disease severity level is
proposed to identify the infection severity based on the mathematical expression depicted in Eqn. 1;

In this work, the binary image of the lung can be extracted using ITK-Snap [42,43], an open-access
software available for the assessment of medical images. If this tool is implemented, a lab technician can
perform the proposed image examination task and the experimental outcome along with the considered
CTSI is then submitted for the suggestion of an experienced radiologist.

4. Result and Discussions
This part presents the experimental result obtained from the proposed system and its dissuasion.
The proposed work is implemented using a workstation with the Intel i5 processor with a clock
frequency 2.GHz with 8GB RAM and 2DB VRAM. The experimental outcome confirms that the proposed
system takes a mean time of 38 sec to process a patient’s data (10 slices) and provides the mean value of
infection rate for further evaluation.

pixels of the lung section as well as the extracted section are computed. The outcome of this procedure is
depicted in figure 5 and the results attained for lung and COVID-19 infection are presented in Fig 5(a)

This examination procedure is then considered to evaluate the COVID-19 infection in other CTSI of
the case studies and the results are noted. The sample experimental outcome for the coronal and axialview images is depicted in figure 6. In which, Fig 6(a)-(c) depicts the chosen test images and the threshold

Figure 6. Results attained for coronal and axial view test images of COVID-19 infected lung CT Images
(Subscripts; 1 and 2 denote the coronal and axial-view slices, respectively)

The proposed image-assisted detection procedure works well on the CTSI of the coronal and axialview and helps achieve a better segmentation of the infected lung section. The proposed technique
offered the following average infection rate for the considered test images: Case1 = 15.96%, Case4 =
18.24%, Case5 = 19.05%, Case7 = 14.17%, Case15 = 32.02%, Case30 = 16.21%, Case38 = 13.85%, Case39 =

9.95%, and Case45 = 17.58%. The patient with a larger infection rate will get more priority for the
treatment compared to the patient with a lesser rate. Further, this analysis also can be used to detect the
progress of the COVID-19 infection in a patient; using the CTSI recorded with various time intervals. This
measure can also be considered to detect the recovery rate of the patient.
Along with the above said patient cases, this work also considered the COVID-19 pneumonia
infection dataset of 75-year-old (male) patient for the assessment [27,34] and the experimental
investigation obtained with axial-view (10 slices) and coronal-view (10 slices) lung images offered an
average infection rate of 38.52% and 39.06% respectively. This result confirmed that, proposed work helps
to attain a better detection of the lung infection irrespective of the CTSI slice orientation (i.e.
coronal/axial). Further, the infection rates computed for both the image cases are approximately similar,
which confirms the clinically significance of proposed technique.
This work proposed preliminary research to examine the COVID-19 infection using the CTSI of the
coronal and axial-view dataset. The COVID-19 is a novel disease and hence the collection of clinical-grade
images is a difficult task. This work executed a series of procedure to extract the infected section from the
2D lung CT scan slices and also proposed a mathematical expression to compute the infection rate using a
pixel-level assessment. In future, this work can be extended in the following directions: (i) Developing a
procedure to detect and categorize the COVID-19 infection mild, moderate, and severe class; (ii) Image
assisted automated follow-up study to detect the progress of the disease; and (iii) Implementing an
automated detection system to classify the existing CTSI slices into normal/COVID-19 pneumonia class.
5. Conclusion
The main aim of the proposed research work is to develop an image assisted examination procedure
to extract and assess the COVID-19 pneumonia infection from the lung CT scan images (CTSI). This work
proposed a series of procedures to extract the infected section from the considered CTSI with images
orientation, such as coronal and axial. This work also suggests a procedure to compute the infection rate
in the lung based on the pixel level ratio of the infected and lung region. This work considered the
clinical-grade 2D slices of the CTSI for the examination and the result attained in this study confirms that
proposed procedure is efficient in extracting the infected section with better accuracy. Further, this
infection rate can be used to classify the considered test images into various classes based on the
amplitude of the infection rate.
Considering these preliminary results, our immediate plan is to examine COVID-19 benchmark
datasets and clinical study (collected from hospitals). The proposed system, however, is currently, not
suitable to examine chest X-Ray images of the patients that are COVID-19 infected.
