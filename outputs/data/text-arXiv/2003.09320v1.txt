Abstract
Background
In the night of February 20, 2020, the first case of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was
confirmed in the Lombardy Region, Italy. In the week that followed, Lombardy experienced a very
rapid increase in the number of cases. We analyzed the first 5,830 laboratory-confirmed cases to
provide the first epidemiological characterization of a COVID-19 outbreak in a Western Country.
Methods
Epidemiological data were collected through standardized interviews of confirmed cases and their
close contacts. We collected demographic backgrounds, dates of symptom onset, clinical features,
respiratory tract specimen results, hospitalization, contact tracing. We provide estimates of the
reproduction number and serial interval.
Results
The epidemic in Italy started much earlier than February 20, 2020. At the time of detection of the
first COVID-19 case, the epidemic had already spread in most municipalities of SouthernLombardy. The median age for of cases is 69 years (range, 1 month to 101 years). 47% of positive
subjects were hospitalized. Among these, 18% required intensive care. The mean serial interval is
estimated to be 6.6 days (95% CI, 0.7 to 19). We estimate the basic reproduction number at 3.1
(95% CI, 2.9 to 3.2). We estimated a decreasing trend in the net reproduction number starting
around February 20, 2020. We did not observe significantly different viral loads in nasal swabs
between symptomatic and asymptomatic.
Conclusions
The transmission potential of COVID-19 is very high and the number of critical cases may become
largely unsustainable for the healthcare system in a very short-time horizon. We observed a slight
decrease of the reproduction number, possibly connected with an increased population awareness
and early effect of interventions. Aggressive containment strategies are required to control COVID19 spread and catastrophic outcomes for the healthcare system.

Introduction

In the late night of February 20, 2020, the first case of novel coronavirus infectious disease
(CoVID-19) was confirmed in the Lombardy Region, Italy, a district with 10 million inhabitants.
The patient was a 38-year old healthy man (patient 1), admitted to the Hospital of Codogno, with a
mild pneumonia resistant to therapy, no relevant travel history and no apparent exposure to diseased
contacts. Starting with the morning of February 21, a strict proactive intervention for tracing and
testing all patient’ contacts was set up. Although the patient zero could not be detected, an initial
outbreak was identified around the city of Codogno. In the week that followed, Codogno area, as
well as several neighboring towns in southern Lombardy, experienced a very rapid increase in the
number of detected cases, which rose to over 530 positive samples by February 28 and 5,830 by
March 8th. With the increase in the number of detected cases, also their spatial distribution
expanded, reaching several other areas in northern Lombardy. Over this period, the Regional Health
System, Local Health Authorities (ATS: Agenzia di Tutela della Salute), the Lombardy Reference
Virology laboratories, and the National Health Institute (ISS: Istituto Superiore della Sanità)
collaborated to introduce coordinated actions to limit the spread of the infection. Among these,
isolation of cases, contact tracing, intensive testing, and the definition of a “red” quarantined area
around the most affected towns.

Here we provide an analysis of the first 5,830 laboratory-confirmed cases reported in Lombardy,
with date of symptoms onset over the period from January 14 to March 8, 2020. Epidemiological
analyses of the confirmed cases and their background demographic and exposure characteristics are
presented here as well as the transmission dynamics of the infection within the Region. Also, the
virological analysis on a subsample of the reported cases is included to provide preliminary
assessment of the level of the viral load among symptomatic and asymptomatic cases.

Method
The earliest case was detected through the Lombardy Notifiable Disease Surveillance System,
which is routinely used to monitor about 80 infectious diseases including at the time of reporting
COVID-19. Due to the relevance of this diagnosis for immediate intervention, the data was
simultaneously confirmed by real time RT PCR by two independent Regional Reference
Laboratories, and further confirmed by sequencing of the amplicons. As indicated by the ISS, the
sample was then sent to the ISS Rome Laboratory for confirmatory testing. Nevertheless,
immediate intervention measures were set up on the basis of the local laboratory data.

Case definition
The case definitions for suspected COVID-19 cases were based on the European Centre for Disease
Prevention and Control (ECDC) case definitions. A suspected COVID-19 case was defined
according to the following criteria:
1) a patient with acute respiratory tract infection (sudden onset of at least one of the following:
cough, fever, shortness of breath) AND with no other aetiology that fully explains the clinical
presentation AND at least one of these other conditions: a history of travel to or residence in
China, OR patient is a health care worker who has been working in an environment where
severe acute respiratory infections of unknown etiology are being cared for; OR
2) a patient with any acute respiratory illness AND at least one of these other conditions: having
been in close contact with a confirmed or probable COVID-19 case in the last 14 days prior to
onset of symptoms, OR having visited or worked in a live animal market in Wuhan, Hubei
Province, China in the last 14 days prior to onset of symptoms, OR having worked or attended a
health care facility in the last 14 days prior to onset of symptoms where patients with hospitalassociated COVID-19 have been reported.

5

A probable case was defined as a suspected case for whom testing for virus causing COVID-19 is
inconclusive (according to the test results reported by the laboratory) or for whom testing was
positive with a specific real-time RT PCR assay detecting the SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for
the COVID-19. Confirmed case was a person with laboratory confirmation of virus causing of
SARS-CoV-2 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms.

Epidemiological data and statistical analysis
Epidemiological data were collected through standardized interviews of confirmed cases and their
close contacts performed by the ATS operators. The information gathered were used to fill the
datasets and included: demographic backgrounds, dates of symptom onset, clinical features,
respiratory tract specimen results, hospitalization, contact tracing. Investigators interviewed each
positive subject and/or their relatives, where necessary, to determine the history of exposure during
the 2 weeks before the symptom onset of the positive test result, including dates, times,
relationships, hobbies, and other patterns of exposures. The definition of contact used in the
epidemiological field investigation is provided in the Supplementary Material. Data from the local
datasets were entered into a central database and analyzed. Cases with established epidemiological
links were used to estimate the distribution of the serial interval (i.e., the time period between the
time of onset of symptoms in a primary case and the time of onset in her/his secondary cases.

Laboratory testing
According to WHO suggestions, nasal swabs (UTM viral transport ®, Copan Italia S.p.a) from all
suspected cases were tested with at least two real-time RT PCR assays targeting different genes (E
and RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2 [1]. In addition, a novel quantitative real-time RT PCR targeting an
additional SARS-CoV-2 gene (M) was developed (details provided upon request). From February
21 to February 25, all suspected cases and asymptomatic contacts were tested. From February 26
onward, testing was applied only to symptomatic patients.

COVID-19 transmission dynamics
The basic reproduction number R0 represents the average number of secondary cases generated by a
primary infector in a fully susceptible population. Once interventions are put in place or the number
of susceptible individuals declines, the transmission potential of the disease at a given time t is
measured in terms of the net reproduction number Rt. We provide estimates of both R0 and Rt for
the entire Lombardy and for the three most affected areas by using a Bayesian approach widely
adopted in the literature [2-4] (details reported in the Supplementary Material).

Ethical approval
Data collection and analysis of cases and close contacts was part of a continuing public health
outbreak investigation and were thus considered exempt from institutional review board approval.

Results
As of March 8, 2020, a total of 5,830 positive cases were reported in all provinces of the Lombardy
Region (Figure 1). The first case (patient 1) was detected and laboratory confirmed at the Hospital
of Codogno in the Lodi Province on February 20. By the following day 28 positive cases were
identified in the same area. On February 23, given the upsurge of positive cases in the area, a Prime
Minister Decree (DPCM Law 23/02/20 n.6) introduced strict measures aimed at containing the
spread of the disease. The implemented measures included the lockdown of a number of
municipalities that appeared at the center of the outbreak (Red Zone), the closure of schools of all
grades and universities, and the suspension of public activities, sports events, and social gatherings
across the Region.

The rapid intensification of regional surveillance that occurred in the following days, through
contact tracing and testing of both symptomatic and asymptomatic exposures to positive cases,
provided critical information for the detection of possible epidemiological links, and uncovered
7

ongoing transmission previous to the identification of patient 1. For this analysis, it emerged a
highly different figure of the Lombardy outbreak with ongoing transmission in January and much
less steep in the number of cases as it could misleadingly be suggested by the temporal trend in the
number of notified cases (see Supplementary Material). A delay of 3.6 days (95% CI, 1 to 10) was
found between the date in which the result of the test was received and the date of the recording in
the dataset. The delay between the dates of symptom onset and reporting was 7.3 days (95%CI, 1 to
20). Therefore, the dates of symptom onset provide a reliable picture of the situation up to about the
end of February. Both delays showed a decline over time (see Supplementary Material).

During the early stages of the COVID-19 epidemic in Lombardy, we observed the formation of
three major clusters identified around the cities of Codogno, Bergamo, and Cremona (see
Supplementary Material). Later on, the epidemic started to widespread in the entire region (Fig. 2).
However, as of March 5, the majority of cases (72%) were observed in the provinces of Bergamo,
Lodi (where Codogno is located), and Cremona.

We analyzed the characteristics of the confirmed cases stratified by three time periods: the first
period accounts for patients with symptom onset up to February 19, the day before the first case
was identified in Codogno; the second for those with symptom onset between February 20 and
February 25, the day before a change in the testing policy was introduced entailing the stop of
testing for asymptomatic contacts of COVID-19 cases; the third period considers cases with
symptom onset from February 26 onwards. For consistency with the rest of the analysis, we
excluded those cases that were explicitly reported as asymptomatic (n=204) as this group was more
affected by changes in the testing and reporting criteria over the considered periods. From the
remaining pool of records (n=5,626), we found a median age for positive cases of 69 years (range, 1
month to 101 years), with over half of the cases occurring in the over 65 (34% in the 75+) and 62%
of the overall number of positives being males (Table 1). Almost half of the cases were hospitalized
8

(47%), although this percentage increases when we stratify the dataset considering those reporting a
date of symptom onset and those who did not (most likely less severe cases). In the former group
63%, 61% and 56% of the cases were hospitalized in, respectively, the three considered periods
whereas in the latter group (those without a date of symptom onset) the percentage was 29%.
Among those hospitalized, 18% required intensive care. Overall, 346 deaths occurred in the region
and the case fatality rates (CFRs) was highest in the older age groups (14% in the 75+ years). Over
the periods we observed changes in the geographical distribution of the cases in the twelve
Provinces of the Lombardy Region, with Lodi being the most affected province in Period 1 and the
fourth in Period 3, after Bergamo, Brescia and Cremona which, respectively, accounted for 25%,
21% and 17% of the overall number of cases of the region.

From the analysis of 90 observations of individual serial intervals in 55 clusters, we estimated the
distribution of the serial interval to follow a gamma distribution with mean 6.6 days (percentiles
2.5th and 97.5th of the distribution: 0.7-19.0). Hence, we estimated that 95% of cases develop
symptoms within 16.1 days of their infector.

For the entire Lombardy and in each of the three analyzed major clusters, we identified an initial
phase lasting between one and two weeks characterized by exponential growth. During that phase,
we estimated the doubling time of the epidemic to be 3.1 days (95% CI, 2.2 to 5.4) in Bergamo, 3.5
days (95% CI, 2.7 to 4.8) in Codogno, and 3.4 days (95% CI, 2.5 to 5.0) in Cremona. In Lombardy
as a whole, the epidemic doubling time was estimated ad 2.6 days (95% CI, 2.2 to 3.0). In the same
phase, we estimated the basic reproduction number at 2.9 (95% CI, 2.3 to 3.4) in Bergamo, 2.5
(95% CI, 2.1 to 2.8) in Codogno, 2.3 (95% CI, 1.9 to 2.7) in Cremona, and 3.1 (95% CI, 2.9 to 3.2)
in Lombardy as a whole. In all locations, the exponential growth phase of the epidemic did not last
long and the net reproduction number Rt was estimated to follow a highly variable temporal
dynamic. In particular, in Bergamo and Cremona, we estimated a rapid increase of Rt before
9

starting to slightly decrease (Fig. 3). In Codogno, the first reported cases developed symptoms in
late January, 2020. Since then, Rt was estimated to slowly, but constantly, increase for more than 2
weeks before starting to decline (Fig. 3). In Lombardy as a whole, we estimated Rt to be under the
epidemic threshold for the initial part of the epidemic and then to quickly grow as soon as the
epidemic started to spread in different geographical areas (Fig. 3). Most importantly, in all locations
we estimated Rt to follow a decreasing trend since February 20, although it is estimated to be still
above the epidemic threshold. These results are robust to assuming different distributions of the
serial interval (see Supplementary Material).

Overall, from February 21 to March 3, 7,925 nasal swabs were analyzed in Lombardy, with 2,251
positives for SARS-Cov-2. A deeper analysis was performed on the subset data from Pavia
Reference Laboratory where 6,208 subjects were swabbed and 1,529 resulted positive. Out of 1,529
positive subjects, 422 (27.6%) were tested between February 21 and February 26, when both
symptomatic patients and symptomatic/asymptomatic contacts were considered (the positivity rate
was 14.6%, 422/2,892). In particular, among the 380 positive subjects detected on February 21, 17
(4.5%) were defined as asymptomatic, 295 (77.6%) were classified as symptomatic, and in 68 cases
(17.8%) there was no clear indication on the presence of symptoms. Over the period from February
27 to March 3, only symptomatic primary cases and their symptomatic contacts were tested,
increasing the detection rate to 33.4% (1,107/3,316).

The median SARS-CoV-2 levels in nasal swabs was 5.0 Log10 RNA copies/ml (range 1.7-10.1) in
symptomatic and 4.7 log10 RNA copies/ml (range 2.1-7.1) in asymptomatic patients (Fig. 4). The
viral load in nasal swabs of symptomatic patients and asymptomatic subjects was not statistically
different (two-sample t-test, p=0.51).

Discussion
We have provided an initial assessment of the rapidly changing epidemiology and transmission
dynamics of COVID-19 outbreak occurred in Lombardy Region. What we have observed is an
impressive increase in positive cases within a few days, of which about half needed hospitalization
and 16% of these required admission to intensive care unit.

At the beginning of the epidemic, cases were mostly observed in Codogno, within the Lodi
Province, in the southern part of Lombardy. As the epidemic progressed, the infection spread to
other areas of the region, causing significant and increasing burden of disease and intensive care
needs, especially among the elderly. This confirms findings on COVID-19 epidemiology in China
[5]. However, with the data available at this time, it is not possible to assess whether the lack of
cases among children and young adults is a consequence of reduced risk of infection or a propensity
for milder clinical symptoms. Moreover, we found that about 60% of COVID-19 cases were male,
although the reason remains to be clarified.

We estimated the mean serial interval to be 6.6 days, which lies in between the estimates obtained
for Hubei Province of China (mean 7.5 days) [6] and for the other Chinese provinces (mean 5.1
days) [4]. The observed difference of 1.5 days with respect of the mean serial interval in Chinese
provinces outside Hubei is a possible indicator that COVID-19 cases in Lombardy are not isolated
as quickly as in those provinces of China and thus continue to spread the infection for a longer
amount of time. We estimated the mean R0 to be in the range 2.3-3.1 during the exponential growth
phase of the epidemic. The daily reproduction number has highly fluctuated over time, but it is
rather homogenous across geographical areas. In all the three identified clusters and in Lombardy as
a whole, we estimate a slightly decreasing trend of Rt starting form about February 20. However,
we estimated Rt to be still well above the epidemic threshold.
11

We did not observe significantly different viral loads in nasal swabs between symptomatic and
asymptomatic subjects, suggesting the same potential for transmitting the virus. However, the
limited number of asymptomatic infected subjects that were identified through contact tracing
during the first week of data collection may suggest a minor role of asymptomatic individuals in
overall spread of the infection. In contrast, active search of both symptomatic and asymptomatic
cases in the initial phases of the outbreak drained significant resources somewhat limiting the
timely identification of all infected individuals.

It is important to note that this study is clearly affected by the usual limitations deriving from the
data analysis of rapidly evolving infectious disease outbreaks. In such a situation the proper
identification of the correct epidemiological links between cases is challenging. This increases the
uncertainty surrounding our estimates of the serial interval. As time progressed, critical public
health interventions were put in place affecting the quickness of data collection. This partially
explains the large delay between the dates of symptom onset and reporting. Such an observed delay
does not allow the analysis of the net reproduction number to be extended after February 25 (as the
data after that date could be incomplete). The estimates of the net reproduction number are robust to
an unknown level of underreporting, but would be affected by a time-varying reporting rate. This
could be the case here, given the change in the testing protocol occurred on February 25.
Asymptomatic transmission remains a challenge to prove and quantify, although we found
virological evidence suggesting a similar viral load in symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects.
This may also affect the estimates of the reproduction number.

The threat posed by COVID-19 is unprecedented and greatly complicated by the limited knowledge
on COVID-19 epidemiology. Policy makers in the Lombardy Region had to take rapid decisions on
how to mitigate the spread of the epidemic, minimizing morbidity and mortality, delaying an
12

epidemic peak that was going to overwhelm healthcare services. The initial response of the
Regional Health System was almost immediate and was articulated around three main objectives:
collection of epidemiological data to understand the situation and perform model-based predictions,
increase in diagnostics (strengthening of regional laboratories), and promoting hospital assistance
for affected subjects (suspension of outpatient activities, creation of dedicated paths and areas,
upgrading of hospital and intensive care places). Coordinated actions were taken to limit the spread
of the infection (e.g., case isolation, contact tracing, and the definition of a quarantined area).
Despite these interventions, we have observed a progressive and parallel growth in the incidence,
hospitalizations, hospital and intensive care efforts, and mortality. All of those are responsible for a
rapid saturation of the health emergency system with a progressive difficulty of being able to treat
both subjects with COVID-19 and those with other pathologies. Nonetheless, as shown by our
analysis, the set-up of a quarantine area around the epicenter of the outbreak in Codogno, appears to
have played a critical role in controlling the infection, inducing a reduction in the number of
reported positive cases in the area and a consequent decrease in the estimate of the net reproductive
number. This appeared as relatively robust evidence that helped informing the decision of enforcing
other stringent measures to the entire Region. We expect that the impact of these measures may be
more markedly visible in the next couple of weeks.

In conclusion, even in the presence of all considered limitations, this analysis of the first two weeks
of data provides important insights into the transmission dynamics of the infection, the virological
characteristics of positive cases, both asymptomatic and symptomatic, as well as the critical factors
in the reporting system that need to be further considered. Such information will be highly valuable
for other Italian regions and countries that are now facing an upsurge in the number of COVID-19
cases.

Figure 1. Daily number of new confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 cases in Lombardy by date of
onset (N=3,521). The epidemic curve is based on data up to March 8, 2020. The decline in the
number of cases in the last few days is partially due to the delay between the date of reporting and
the date of symptom onset. The colors of the bars represent the three considered periods.

Figure 2. Geographical distribution of the cumulative number of cases (dates of symptom onset)
across all municipalities of Lombardy.

Figure 3. Estimated net reproduction number Rt in the three main clusters and in Lombardy as a
whole, over a 4-day moving average. We excluded cases with symptom onset after February 25,
2020 to account for the incompleteness of the dataset in the last few days due to reporting delays.

1. Definition of contact
Close contact of a confirmed case was considered a person living in the same household as a COVID-19
case, a person having had face-to-face contact with a COVID-19 case within 2 meters and >15 minutes; a
person who was in a closed environment (e.g. classroom, meeting room, hospital waiting room, etc.) with
a COVID-19 case >15 minutes and at a distance of <2 meters; a healthcare worker (HCW) or other
person providing direct care for a COVID-19 case, or laboratory workers handling specimens from a
COVID-19 case without recommended personal protective equipment (PPE) or with a possible breach of
PPE; a contact in an aircraft sitting within two seats (in any direction) of the COVID-19 case, travel
companions or persons providing care, and crew members serving in the section of the aircraft where the
index case was seated (if severity of symptoms or movement of the case indicate more extensive
exposure, passengers seated in the entire section or all passengers on the aircraft may be considered close
contacts). The epidemiological link could have occurred within a 14‐day period before the onset of
symptoms in the case under consideration.

2. Definition of geographical clusters
Three clusters of municipalities were defined around the cities of Codogno, Cremona, and Bergamo,
which represent the largest cities in the three most affected geographical areas of Lombardy as of March
8, 2020. A cluster was defined as all municipalities whose barycenter lay within a radius of 10 km from
the barycenter of the three major cities. The 'haversine method' was used to calculate the distance between
municipalities. Table S1 shows the list of municipalities included in the three clusters. Figures S1 shows
the epidemic curves associated with the three identified clusters and the contribution of the three clusters
to the epidemic trajectory of the whole region.

Date of onset of symptoms

geographical clusters and in the remaining areas of the Lombardy.

3. Reporting delays
The temporal trend of the number of reported cases provides a highly different picture of the
epidemiological situation of the COVID-19 outbreak in Lombardy (Fig. S2). This is due to the delay in
identification of cases and reporting. Data on laboratory-confirmed symptomatic cases reported in
Lombardy by March 8, 2020 were used to estimate the time between the onset of symptoms and the
laboratory confirmation. We used maximum likelihood to fit a negative binomial distribution to the data.
We found that the best-fitting distribution has mean 5.25 (SD: 0.085) and dispersion 1.57 (SD: 0.054), see
Figure S3.

observed in the patient line list (bars) and as estimated by the best-fitting negative binomial distribution (solid
line represents the mean estimate; shaded area represents the 95%CI of estimates).

We assessed possible bias in the data due to delays between the time of confirmation of a case and the
time when the patient record is inserted in the centralized database (i.e., the reporting date). To this aim,
we compared the epidemic curves by symptom onset and by confirmation date in successive updates of
the patient line list (Figure S4). From these curves, we computed the delay by which each positive case
and its symptom (when symptomatic) are reported in the current version of patient line list (Figure S5),
and we used maximum likelihood to fit to each of them a gamma distribution. The parameters of the bestfitting distributions are reported in Tab. S2.

the fact that there is a delay of about two weeks until we can assume 90% completeness of the data for the

4. Serial interval distribution
Data on close contacts’ of positive cases were collected through standardized interviews of performed by
the ATS operators of the Lombardy Region. Epidemiological links were used to estimate the serial
intervals for pairs of primary infectors and secondary cases between cases in the same cluster, connected
by an epidemiological link.
Of the 6,106 reported contacts, only 3.8% resulted in COVID-19 infection. Of these 233, for 90 pairs of
cases we found an infector-infectee relationship and have the dates of symptom onset of both cases.
Identified secondary cases were ascribed to 55 unique primary cases.
A gamma distribution was fitted to the obtained set of individual serial intervals by using maximum
likelihood estimation. The best fitting gamma distribution (Fig. S8) has mean 6.6 days and median 5.5
days (shape 1.87, SD 0.26; scale 0.28, SD 0.04).

Figure S8. Red bars represent observed lags between the symptom onset dates of secondary cases and

their corresponding primary infectors. The solid line and the shaded area show the estimated mean
and 95%CI of the serial interval as obtained by the best-fitting gamma distribution.
5. Estimation of the reproduction number
The basic reproduction number R0 represents the average number of secondary cases generated by a
primary infector in a fully susceptible population. In general terms, when R0 is larger than 1 the infection
may spread in the population and the larger R0 the larger effort required to control the epidemic. Once the
number of susceptible individuals declines, the transmission potential of the disease at a given time t is
measured in terms of the net reproduction number R(t). The net reproduction number is useful to track the
effectiveness of performed control measures and other factors affecting the spread of the epidemic (e.g.,
the behavioral response of the population) over time. As soon as R(t) falls below 1, the epidemic starts to
decline.
To estimate R(t), we use the same methodology presented in reference [2-4]. We assumed that the daily
number of new cases (date of symptom onset) with locally acquired infection L(t) can be approximated
by a Poisson distribution according to the equation
1

𝐿(𝑡)~Pois *𝑅(𝑡) , 𝜑(𝑠)𝐶(𝑡 − 𝑠)5
234

where
• C(t), with t from 1 to T, is daily number of new cases (date of symptom onset);
• R(t) is the net reproduction number at time t;
• 𝜑(𝑠) is the distribution of the generation time (corresponding to the distribution of the serial
interval) calculated at time s.
The likelihood ℒ of the observed time series of cases from day 1 to day T conditional on C(0) is thus
given by
;

1

ℒ = 9 𝑃 *𝐿(𝑡); 𝑅(𝑡) , 𝜑(𝑠)𝐶(𝑡 − 𝑠))5
13<

23<

where P(k; λ) is the probability mass function of a Poisson distribution (i.e., the probability of observing k
events if these events occur with rate λ).
We then used MCMC Metropolis-Hastings sampling to estimate the posterior distribution of R(t). To
estimate R0, we assumed that during the period where the epidemic showed exponential growth R(t)=R0
and used the above described procedure.

6. Sensitivity analysis on the serial interval
As sensitivity analysis, we report the results obtained by considering estimates of the serial interval
obtained by epidemiological investigations of the very first few clusters in Wuhan, China [5] and by the
analysis of transmission the Chinese provinces outside Hubei [4]. The estimated trends in the dynamics of
R(t) are robust with these choices of the serial interval (Fig. S9 and S10). In particular, the decreasing
trend of R(t) since late February is clearly visible in both scenarios. Clearly, in absolute terms, the longer
the serial interval and the larger is the estimated R(t) value.

Figure S9. Estimated net reproduction number (Rt) in the three clusters and in Lombardy as a whole, over a 4day moving average by considering a serial interval of mean 5.1 days (SD: 3.4 days) [4]. We excluded cases with
symptom onset after February 25, 2020 to account for the incompleteness of the dataset in the last few days due
to reporting delays.
