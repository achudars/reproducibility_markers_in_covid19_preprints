Abstract
We constructed a near-real-time daily CO2 emission dataset, namely the Carbon Monitor, to
monitor the variations of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and cement production since
January 1st 2019 at national level with near-global coverage on a daily basis, with the potential to
be frequently updated. Daily CO2 emissions are estimated from a diverse range of activity data,
including: hourly to daily electrical power generation data of 29 countries, monthly production
data and production indices of industry processes of 62 countries/regions, daily mobility data and
mobility indices of road transportation of 416 cities worldwide. Individual flight location data and
monthly data were utilised for aviation and maritime transportation sectors estimates. In addition,
monthly fuel consumption data that corrected for daily air temperature of 206 countries were used
for estimating the emissions from commercial and residential buildings. This Carbon Monitor
dataset manifests the dynamic nature of CO2 emissions through daily, weekly and seasonal
variations as influenced by workdays and holidays, as well as the unfolding impacts of the
COVID-19 pandemic. The Carbon Monitor near-real-time CO2 emission dataset shows a 7.8%
decline of CO2 emission globally from Jan 1st to Apr 30th in 2020 when compared with the same
period in 2019, and detects a re-growth of CO2 emissions by late April which are mainly
attributed to the recovery of economy activities in China and partial easing of lockdowns in other
countries. Further, this daily updated CO2 emission dataset could offer a range of opportunities
for related scientific research and policy making.

Background & Summary
The main cause of global climate change is the excessive anthropogenic emission of CO2 to
the atmosphere from geological carbon reservoirs, from the combustion of fossil fuel and
cement production. Dynamic information on fossil fuel-related CO2 emissions is critical for
understanding the impacts on climate due to different human activities, and their variability,
on the forcing of climate change. Further, the combustion processes of fossil fuel also emit
short-lived pollutants such as SO2 , NO2 and CO. Therefore, such information would also
allow a more accurate quantification and better understanding of air quality changes 1,2 .
Estimates of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and cement production 2-8 are based
on both activity data (e.g., the amount of fuel burnt or energy produced) and emission factors
(See Methods) 9 . The sources of these data are mainly national energy statistics, although a
number of organizations such as CDIAC, BP, EDGAR, IEA and GCP also produce and
compile estimates for different groups of countries or for all countries 1,10-12. The reported
fossil fuel-related CO2 emissions are usually on an annual basis while lagging the very year’s
emissions by at least one year.
The uncertainty associated with CO2 emissions from burning fossil fuel and producing cement
is small when considering large emitters or the global totals, smaller than that of co-emitted
combustion-related pollutants for which uncertain technological factors influence the ratio of
emitted amounts to fossil fuel burnt 13-15 . The uncertainty of global carbon emissions from
fossil fuel burning and cement production varies between ±6% and ±10% 5,7,16,17 (±2σ). The
uncertainty is attributed to both the activity data and the emission factors. For the activity
data, the amount of fuel burnt is recorded by energy production and consumption statistics,
hence the uncertainties are introduced by errors and inconsistencies in the reported figures
from different sources. For the emission factors, the different fuel types, quality and
combustion efficiency together contribute to the overall uncertainty. For example, coal used
in China is of variable quality and so is its emission factors, both before (raw coal) and after
cleaning (cleaned coal) varies significantly, which was found to cause a 15% uncertainty
range for CO2 emissions. On the other hand, there is very limited temporal change of
emission factors. For example, the annual difference of emission factors for coal consumption
was within 2% globally18 while the variation of emission factors for oil and gas was found to
be much smaller.
Given the fact that the uncertainty of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel burning and cement
production is in general under ±10% 10,19,20 , and the annual difference of emission factors is
less than 2% 18 , the CO2 emission thus can be estimated directly by estimating the absolute
amount and the relative change of activity through time. This method has been widely used
for scientific products that update recent changes of CO 2 emissions estimates 1,21,22 23,
understanding that official and comprehensive CO2 national inventories reported by countries
to the UNFCCC become available with a lag of two years for Annex-I countries and several
years for non-Annex-I ones 24. As such, a higher spatial, temporal and sectoral resolution of
CO2 emission inventories beyond annual and national level can be obtained by spatial,

temporal and sectoral data to disaggregate the annual national emissions 9,14,23,25 . The level of
granularity of spatially explicit dynamic emission inventories depends on available data, such
as location and operations of point sources 23 (i.e. power generation for a certain plant),
regional statistics of energy use (i.e. monthly fuel consumption) 9,25, and knowledge of
proxies for the distribution of emissions such as gridded population density, night lights,
urban forms and GDP data etc. 9,14,23,25.
Gaining from past experiences of constructing annual inventories and newly compiled activity
data, we present in this study a novel daily dataset of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel burning
and cement production at national level. The countries/regions include China, India, U.S.,
Europe (EU27 & UK), Russia, Japan, Brazil, and rest of world (ROW), as well as the
emissions from international bunkers. This dataset, known as Carbon Monitor, is separated
into several key emission sectors: power sector (39% of total emissions), industrial production
(28%), ground transport (18%), air transport (3%), ship transport (2%), and residential
consumption (10 %). For the first time, daily emissions estimates are produced for these six
sectors, based on dynamically and regularly updated activity data. This is made possible by
the availability of recent activity data such as hourly electrical power generation, traffic
indices, airplane locations and natural gas distribution, with the assumption that the daily
variation of emissions is driven by the activity data and that the contribution from emission
factors is negligible, as they evolve at longer time scales, e.g. from policy implementation and
technology shifts.
The framework of this study is illustrated in Fig 1. We calculated national CO2 emissions and
international aviation and shipping emissions since the Jan 1st 2019, drawing on hourly
datasets of electricity power production and their CO 2 emissions in 29 countries (thus
including the substantial variations in carbon intensity associated with the variable mix of
electricity production), daily vehicle traffic indices in 416 cities worldwide, monthly
production data for cement, steel and other energy intensive industrial products in 62
countries/regions, daily maritime and aircraft transportation activity data, and either previousyear fuel use data corrected for air temperature to residential and the commercial buildings .
Together, these data cover almost all fossil fuels and industry sources of global CO2
emissions, except for the emission from land use change (up to 10% of global CO2 emissions)
and non-fossil fuel CO2 emissions of industrial products (up to 2% of global CO2 emissions) 26
in addition to cement and clinker (i.e. plate glass, ammonia, calcium carbide, soda ash,
ethylene, ferroalloys, alumina, lead and zinc etc.).
While daily emission can be directly calculated using near-real-time activity data and
emission factors for the electricity power sector, such an approach is difficult to apply to all
sectors. For the industry sector, emissions can be estimated monthly in some countries. For
the other sectors, we used proxy data instead of daily real activity data, to dynamically
downscale the annual or monthly CO2 emissions totals on a daily basis. For instance, traffic
indices in cities representative of each country were used instead of actual vehicle counts and
categories, combined with annual national total sectoral emissions, to produce daily road

transportation emissions. As such, for the road transportation, air transportation and
residential use of fuels sectors in most countries, we downscaled monthly or annual total
emission data in 2019 to calculate the daily CO2 emission in the very year. Subsequently, we
scaled monthly totals of 2019 by daily proxies of activities to obtain daily CO 2 emissions data
in the first four months of 2020, during the unprecedented disturbance of the COVID-19
pandemic. The Carbon Monitor near-real-time CO2 emission dataset shows a 7.8% decline of
CO2 emission globally from January 1st to April 30th in 2020 when compared with the same
period in 2019, and detects a re-growth of CO2 emissions by late April which are mainly
attributed to the recovery of economy activities in China and partial easing of lockdowns in
other countries.

Methods
Annual total and sectorial emission per country in the baseline year 2019
According to the IPCC Guidelines for emission reporting4 , the CO2 emissions 𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑠
should be calculated by multiplying activity data 𝐴𝐷 by corresponding emission
factors 𝐸𝐹.
𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑠 = ∑ ∑ ∑ 𝐴𝐷𝑖,𝑗,𝑘 ∙ 𝐸𝐹𝑖,𝑗,𝑘

(1)

Where 𝑖, 𝑗, 𝑘 are indices for regions, sectors and fuel types respectively. 𝐸𝐹 can be further
separated into the net heating values 𝑣 for each fuel type (the energy obtained per unit of
fuel), the carbon content 𝑐 per energy output (t C/TJ) and the oxidization rate 𝑜 (the fraction
(in %) of fuel oxidized during combustion):
(2)
𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑠 = ∑ ∑ ∑ 𝐴𝐷𝑖,𝑗,𝑘 ∙ (𝑣𝑖,𝑗,𝑘 ∙ 𝑐𝑖,𝑗,𝑘 ∙ 𝑜𝑖,𝑗,𝑘 )
Due to the lag of more than two years in publishing governmental energy statistics, we started
from the latest CO2 emissions estimates up to 2018 from current CO2 databases1,10-12. For
2019, we completed this information to obtain annual total emissions based on literature data
and disaggregated the annual total into daily emissions (see below). For 2020, we estimated
daily CO2 emissions by using daily changes of activity data in 2020 compared to 2019. The
CO2 emissions and sectoral structure in 2018 for countries and regions were extracted from
EDGAR V4.3.21,27 and V5.0 for each country, and national emissions were scaled to the year

2019 based on our own estimate (for China) and data from the Global Carbon Budget 201921
(for other countries):
𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑟,2019 = 𝛼𝑟 ∙ 𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑟,2018

(3)

For China, we firstly calculated CO2 emissions in 2018 based on the energy consumption by
fuel types and cement production in 2018 from China Energy Statistical Yearbook 28 and the
National Bureau Statistics 29 following Equation 1. We projected the energy consumption in
2019 from the annual growth rates of coal, oil and gas reported by Statistical Communiqué 29
and applied China-specific emission factors 30 to obtain the annual growth rate of emissions in
2019. For US and Europe (EU27&UK), we used updated emission growth rates in 2019
published by CarbonBrief (https://www.carbonbrief.org/guest-post-why-chinas-co2emissions-grew-less-than-feared-in-2019). For countries with no estimates of emission growth
rates in 2019 such as Russia, Japan and Brazil, we assumed their growth rates of emissions
was 0.5% based on the emission growth rate of the rest of world22.
In this study, the EDGAR sectors were aggregated into four sectors (𝑠): power sector, industry
sector, transport sector (ground transport, aviation and shipping), and residential sector. This
is consistent with the new activity data we used below to compute daily variations. We used
the sectoral distribution in 2018 from EDGAR to infer the sectoral emissions in 2019 for each
country/region (Equation 4), assuming that the sectoral distribution remained unchanged in
these two years.

Data acquisition and processing of Carbon Monitor daily CO 2 emissions
According to IPCC Guidelines 4 , the CO2 emissions for sector could be calculated by
multiplying sectoral activity data by their corresponding emission factors following
Equation 5:
𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠 = 𝐴𝐷𝑠 ∙ 𝐸𝐹𝑠

(5)

The emissions were here calculated following this equation, separately for the power sector,

the industry sector, the transport sector, and the residential sector.

1. Power sector.
The CO2 emissions from power sector can be calculated by adapting Equation 5 with sector
specific activity data (i.e. electricity production/thermal electricity production) and
corresponding emission factors (Equation 6):
𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑝𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟 = 𝐴𝐷𝑝𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟 ∙ 𝐸𝐹𝑝𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟

(6)

Normally the emission factors change slightly over time but can be assumed to remain
constant over the two years period considered in this study, compared to the huge changes in
activity data. Thus, we assumed that emission factors remained unchanged in 2019 and 2020,
and calculated the daily emissions as follows:
𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑑𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑦 = 𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑙𝑦 ∙

𝐴𝐷𝑑𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑦

(7)

𝐴𝐷𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑙𝑦

The data sources of daily activity data in power sector are described as Table 2. The
countries/regions listed in Table 2 account for more than 70% of the total CO 2 emissions in
the power sector. For emissions from other countries (ROW), which are not listed in Table 2,
we estimated the power sector emission changes in 2020 based on the period of the national
lock-down. For daily emission changes of ROW in 2019, we firstly assumed a linear
relationship between daily global emission and daily total emissions of the ROW countries
listed in Table 2. Then we classified each country according to whether they adopted lockdown measures, based on official reports. Based on daily emission data of the power sector of
the countries listed in Table 2, we calculated the respective average change rates of power
sectors in ROW countries between January and April, assuming changes started since the date
of lock-down in each country. Emissions from countries with no lock-down were left
unchanged. We then applied these country-specific January to April emissions growth rates to
estimate daily changes for each ROW country in 2020, based on their lock-down measures,
and aggregated them into daily emission for ROW.

2. Industry sector: Industrial and cement production
While daily production data is not directly available for industrial and cement production, the
monthly CO2 emissions from industry and cement production sector could be calculated by
using monthly statistics of industrial production, and daily data of electricity generation to
disaggregate the monthly CO2 emissions into daily values. This calculation assumes a linear
relationship between daily electricity generation for industry and daily industry production
data to compute daily industry production.
The emissions from industrial production during the fossil fuel combustion were calculated
by multiplying activity data (i.e., fossil fuel consumption data in the industrial sector) by
corresponding emission factors by type of fuel. Due to limited data availability, we assumed a
linear relationship between daily industrial production and industrial fossil fuel use, and the
emission factors remaining unchanged. So, the monthly emissions in 2019 in country/region
could be calculated by following equation:
𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑙𝑦,2019,𝑟 = 𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑙𝑦,2019,𝑟 ∙ (𝑃𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑡ℎ𝑙𝑦,2019,𝑟⁄𝑃𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑙𝑦,2019,𝑖,𝑟 )

(8)

The emissions from cement production during the chemical process of calcination of calcite
were calculated with the same Eq.(8), which is normally used by multiplying the cement
production by the emission factor of this industry.
Specifically, for China, the emissions from the industry sector were further divided into steel

industry, cement industry, chemical industry, and other industries (indicated by index 𝑖):
𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑙𝑦,2019,𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑎

(9)

= ∑ 𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑙𝑦,2019,𝑖 ∙ (𝑃𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑡ℎ𝑙𝑦,2019,𝑖⁄𝑃𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑙𝑦,2019,𝑖 )
For the monthly emissions in 2020 in country/region , we used the following equation:
𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑙𝑦,2020,𝑟 = 𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑡ℎ𝑙𝑦,2019,𝑟 ∙ (𝑃𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑡ℎ𝑙𝑦,2020,𝑟⁄𝑃𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑡ℎ𝑙𝑦,2019,𝑟 )

(10)

where 𝑃 is the industrial production in different industrial sectors (in China) or a total
Industrial Production Index (in other countries) as listed in Table 3. In China’s case, the
January and February estimates were combined as no individual monthly data was reported
by sources listed in Table 3 for these two months. The monthly industrial emissions were
disaggregated to daily emissions using daily electricity data, as explained above.
Lacking in the latest Industrial Production Index in April 2020 for Europe, India, Japan,
Russia and Brazil, we adopted monthly growth rates of industrial output from Trading
Economics (https://tradingeconomics.com) based on preliminary survey data. For other
countries not listed in Table 3, we used the same method as described for the power sector to
calculate the daily industry emissions from ROW.
To allocate monthly emissions into daily emissions, we use the weight of daily electricity
production to monthly electricity production:
𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑑𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑦 = 𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑡ℎ𝑙𝑦 ∙ (𝐸𝑙𝑒𝑐𝑑𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑦 ⁄𝐸𝑙𝑒𝑐𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑡ℎ𝑙𝑦 )

3. Transport sector
1) Road transportation
We collected hourly TomTom congestion level data from the TomTom website
(https://www.tomtom.com/en_gb/traffic-index/). The congestion level (called 𝑋 hereafter)
represents the extra time spent on a trip, in percentage, compared to uncongested condition.
TomTom congestion level data were obtained for 416 cities across 57 countries at a temporal
resolution of one hour. Of note that a zero-congestion level means that the traffic is fluid or
‘normal’, but does not mean there was no vehicle and zero emissions. It is thus important to
identify the lower threshold of emissions when the congestion level is zero. To do so, we
compared the time series of daily mean TomTom congestion level 𝑋, with the daily mean car
flux (called hereafter in vehicle per day) from publicly available real-time 𝑄 data from an
average of 60 roads in the Paris megacity. Those daily mean car counts were reported by the
City’s service (https://opendata.paris.fr/pages/home/). We used a sigmoid function to fit the
relationship between 𝑋 and 𝑄 (Fig 2):
𝑏 𝑋𝑐
(12)
𝑑 𝑐 + 𝑋𝑐
where a, b, c and d are the regression parameters (Table 4). We verified that the empirical fit
𝑄=𝑎+

from Eq. (12) can reproduce the observed large drop of 𝑄 due to the lockdown in Paris and
the recovery afterwards. We assume that daily emissions relative changes were proportional
to the relative change of the function 𝑄(𝑋) from Eq. (12). Then, we applied the
function 𝑄(𝑋) established for Paris to other cities included in the TomTom dataset, assuming
that the relative magnitude in car counts (and thus emissions) follow similar relationship with
TomTom. The emission changes were first calculated for individual cities, and then weighted

by city emissions to aggregate to national changes. For a specific country 𝑖 with 𝑛 cities
reported by TomTom, the national daily vehicle flux for day j was given by:
𝑄𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑦,𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑗 =

∑𝑛𝑖=1 𝑄𝑖,𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑗 𝐸𝑖
∑𝑛𝑖=1 𝐸𝑖

(13)

Where is the annual road transportation emission of city n taken in the grid point of each
TomTom city from the annual gridded EDGARv4.3.2 emission map for the “road
transportation” sector (1A3b) (httpiis://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/) for the year 2010, assuming
that the spatial distribution of ground transport did not change significantly within a country
between 2010 and the period of this study. Then, the daily road transportation emissions in
2019 and 2020 (𝐸𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑦,𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑗 ) for a country were scaled such that the total road
transportation emissions in the first four months of 2019 equaled to 121/365 times the annual
emissions of this sector in 2019 (𝐸𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑦,2019 ) estimated in this study：
𝐸𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑦,𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑗 = 𝑄𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑦,𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑗

121/365 × 𝐸𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑦,2019
∑121
𝑗=1 𝑄𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑦,𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑗 (2019)

(14)

For countries not included in the TomTom dataset, we assumed that the emission changes
follow the mean changes of other countries. For example, Cyprus, as an EU member country,
had no city reported in TomTom dataset, so its relative emission change was assumed to
follow the same pattern of the total emissions from other EU countries included in TomTom
dataset (which covers 98% of EU total emissions). Similarly, the relative emission changes of
countries in ROW but not reported by TomTom were assumed to follow the same pattern of
the total emissions from all TomTom reported countries (which cover 85% of global total
emissions).

2) Aviation
We calculated CO2 emissions from commercial aviation following a commonly used
approach: reconstructing the emission inventories from bottom up based on the knowledge of
the parameters of individual flights. We collected the FlightRadar24 data
(https://www.flightradar24.com/) for the departure and landing airports for each flight, the
calculate the distance flown assuming the shortest distance for each flight, and then CO 2
emissions per flight31 . Flights were grouped per country, and for each country between
domestic or international traffic. The daily CO 2 emission was computed as the product of
distance flown, by a CO2 emission factor per km flown, according to:
𝐷𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑦 𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑎𝑣𝑖𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 = 𝐷𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑦 𝐾𝑖𝑙𝑜𝑚𝑒𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑠 𝐹𝑙𝑜𝑤𝑛𝑎𝑣𝑖𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 2020 × 𝐸𝐹𝑎𝑣𝑖𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 2019

(14)

We acquired monthly individual commercial flight information from FlightRadar24.
Individual commercial flights are tracked by FlightRadar24 based on reception of ADS-B
signals emitted by aircraft and received by their network of ADS-B receptors 31.
The 𝐷𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑦 𝐾𝑖𝑙𝑜𝑚𝑒𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑠 𝐹𝑙𝑜𝑤𝑛 are computed assuming great circle distance between the takeoff, cruising, descent and landing points for each flight and are cumulated over all flights. As
there is no sufficient data available to convert the FlightRadar24 database into CO 2 emissions
on a flight-by-flight basis, we computed CO2 emissions by assuming a constant CO2 emission
factor per km flown across the whole fleet of aircraft (regional, narrowbody passenger,
widebody passenger and freight operations). This assumption is justified if the mix of flights
between these categories has not changed substantially between 2019 and 2020.
𝐸𝐹𝑎𝑣𝑖𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 2019 = 𝐴𝑛𝑛𝑢𝑎𝑙 𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑠 𝑎𝑣𝑖𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 2018
× 𝐺𝑟𝑜𝑤𝑡ℎ 𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑎𝑣𝑖𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 2018−2019
/𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝐸𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝐾𝑖𝑙𝑜𝑚𝑒𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑠 𝐹𝑙𝑜𝑤𝑛 𝑎𝑣𝑖𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 2019

(15)

EDGAR published an estimate of total CO2 emissions from commercial aviation in 2018 of
925 Mt CO2 . And the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) implied annual
compound growth rate of total emissions from commercial flights, 5.7%, during the past five
years from 2013 to 201832 . In the absence of further information, we considered this increase
to be representative of the emission growth rate of commercial aviation from 2018 to 2019.
The FlightRadar24 database has incomplete data for some flights and may miss altogether a
small fraction of actual flights 31 , so we scaled the EDGAR estimate of CO2 emissions
(inflated by 5.7% for the year 2019) with the total estimated number of kilometers flown in
2019 (67.91 million km) and apply this scaling factor to 2020 data. We assumed that the
fraction of missed flights was the same in 2019 and 2020, which is reasonable.

3) Ships
We collected international CO2 shipping emissions from 2016-2018 based on the EDGAR’s
international emissions. We also. collected global shipping emissions during the period of
2007-2015 from IMO33 and ICCT (https://theicct.org/sites/default/files/publications/Global-

shipping-GHG-emissions-2013-2015_ICCT-Report_17102017_vF.pdf). According to the
Third IMO GHG Study33 , CO2 emissions from international shipping accounted for 88% of
global shipping emissions, domestic and fishing accounts for 8% and 4%, respectively. We
calculated international CO2 shipping emissions from 2007-2015 from global shipping
emissions and the ratio of international shipping and global shipping emissions. We
extrapolated emissions from linear fits 2007-2018 to estimate the emissions in 2019. The data
sources of shipping emissions are in Table 6. We obtained emissions for the first quarter of
2019 based on the assumption the equal distribution of monthly shipping CO2 emissions. The
equations are as follows:
𝑀𝑜𝑛𝑡ℎ𝑙𝑦 𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑠ℎ𝑖𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑛𝑔,2019
= 𝛼 × 𝑌𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑙𝑦 𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑠ℎ𝑖𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑛𝑔,2019 × 𝑅𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑡ℎ

(16)

𝛼 is the increasing rate of international shipping emissions in 2019 based on the linear
extrapolation of data from the period 2007-2018, estimated to be of 3.01%. 𝑅𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑡ℎ represents
the ratio of the months to be calculated in the whole year. Given this, we estimated the
shipping emissions for the first quarter of 2019, 𝑅𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑡ℎ equals 121/365.
We assumed that the change in shipping emissions was linearly related to the change in ships.
Traffic volume. The change of international shipping emissions for the first four months of
2020 was calculated according to the following equation:
𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑑,2020 = 𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑑,2019 × 𝐶𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥
(17)
Where represents the ratio of the change in shipping emissions, estimated to the end of Apr
by -15% compared to the same period of last year according to
https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/global-container-shipments-set-fall-30-next-fewmonths.

4. Residential sector: residential and commercial buildings
Fuel consumption daily data from this sector are not available. Several studies (ref) showed
that the main source of daily and monthly variability of this sector is climate, namely heating
emissions increase when temperature falls below a threshold which depends on region,
building types and people habits. We calculated emissions by assuming annual totals unchanged
from 2019 and using climate daily climate information, in three steps: 1) estimation of populationweighted heating degree days for each country and for each day based on the ERA534
reanalysis of 2-meters air temperature, 2) split residential emissions into two parts: cooking
emissions and heating emissions according to the EDGAR database35, using the EDGAR estimates
of 2018 residential emissions as the baseline. Emissions from cooking were assumed to remain
independent of temperature, and those from heating were assumed to be a function of the

heating demand. Based on the change of population-weighted heating degree days in each
country in 2019 and 2020, we downscaled annual EDGAR 2018 residential emissions to daily
values for 2019 and 2020 as described by Eq. 18-20:
𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑐,𝑚 = 𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑐,𝑚,2018 ×

∑𝑚 𝐻𝐷𝐷𝑐,𝑑
∑𝑚,2018 𝐻𝐷𝐷𝑐,𝑑

𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑐,𝑑 = 𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑐,𝑚 × 𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔,𝑐,𝑚 ×

(20)

where 𝑐 is country, 𝑑 is day, 𝑚 is month, 𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑐,𝑚 is the residential emissions of country 𝑐 in
month 𝑚 of the year 2019 or 2020, 𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑐,𝑚,2018 is the emissions of country 𝑐 in month 𝑚 of
the year 2018, 𝐻𝐷𝐷𝑐,𝑑 is the population-weighted heating degree day in country 𝑐 in day 𝑑,
𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑐,𝑑 is the residential emissions of country 𝑐 in day 𝑑 of the year 2019 or 2020,
𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔,𝑐,𝑚 is the percentage of residential emissions from heating demand in country 𝑐
in month 𝑚, 𝑁𝑚 is the number of days in month 𝑚, 𝑃𝑜𝑝𝑔𝑟𝑖𝑑 is gridded population data
derived from Gridded Population of the World, Version 4 36 , 𝑇 is the daily average air
temperature at 2 meter derived from ERA5 34 .

The main assumption is this approach is that residential emissions did not change
from other factors than heating degree days variations in 2020, when people time in
houses dramatically increased during the lock-down period. In order to test the
validity of this assumption, we compiled natural gas daily consumption data by
residential and commercial buildings for France
(https://www.smart.grtgaz.com/fr/consommation) (unfortunately such data could not be
collected in many countries) during 2019 and 2020. Natural gas consumption in kWh
per day was transformed to CO 2 emissions using an emission factor of 10.55 kWh per
m3 and a molar volume of 22.4 10-3 m3 per mole.
Firstly, we verified that the temporal variation of those ‘true’ residential CO 2
emissions was similar to that given by equations (18) to (20). Secondly, after fitting a
piecewise model to those natural gas residential emission data using ERA5 air
temperature data, we removed the effect of temperature to obtain an emission
corrected for temperature effects. Even if the lock down was very strict in France, we
found no significant emission anomaly, meaning that the fact that nearly the entire
population was confined at home did not increase or decrease emissions. This
complementary analysis tentatively suggests that residential emissions can be well
approximated in other countries by equations (18) to (20) based only on temperature
during the lock down period.

Fig 4. Residential and commercial building daily natural gas consumption
(linearly related to CO 2 emissions from this sector) in France for the last 5 years.
Temperature effects have been removed from emissions using a linear piecewise
model. When the effect of variable winter temperature was accounted for, no
significant change is seen in 2020 during the very strict lock -down period.

Data Records
Currently there are 27484 data records provided in this dataset:
-

268 records are daily mean CO2 emissions (from fossil fuel combustion and cement
production process) 1751-2020.

-

4374 records are the daily emissions for 9 countries/regions (China, India, US,
EU27&UK, Russia, Japan, Brazil, ROW and Globe) and 486 days (from January 1st 2019
to April 30th 2020).

-

22842 records are daily emissions in power sector, ground transport sector, industry
sector, residential sector, aviation sector and international shipping sector respectively,
for 9 countries/regions (China, India, US, EU27&UK, Russia, Japan, Brazil, ROW and
Globe) and 486 days (from January 1st 2019 to April 30th 2020).

Technical Validation
Uncertainty estimates
We followed the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories to conduct
the uncertainty analysis of the data. Firstly, the uncertainties were calculated for each sector:

-

Power sector: the uncertainty is mainly from inter-annual variability of coal emission
factors. Based the UN statistics the inter-annual variability of fossil fuel is within
(±1.5%), which been used as uncertainty of the CO2 from power sectors.

-

Industrial sector: Uncertainty of CO2 from Industry and cement production comes from
the monthly production data. Given CO2 from Industry and cement production in China
accounts for more than 60% of world total industrial CO2 , and the fact that uncertainty of
emission in China is t Uncertainty from monthly statistics was derived from 10000 Monte
Carlo simulations to estimate a 68% confidence interval (1-sigma) for China. from
monthly statistics was derived from 10000 Monte Carlo simulations to estimate a 68%
confidence interval (1-sigma) for China. We calculated the 68% prediction interval of
linear regression models between emissions estimated from monthly statistics and official
emissions obtained from annual statistics at the end of each year, to deduce the one-sigma
uncertainty involved when using monthly data to represent the whole year’s change. The
squared correlation coefficients are within the range of 0.88 (e.g., coal production) and
0.98 (e.g., energy import and export data), which represent that only using the monthly
data can explain 88% to 98% of the whole year’s variation 37 , while the remaining
variation not covered yet reflect the uncertainty caused by the frequent revisions of
China’s statistical data after they are first published.

-

Ground Transportation: The emissions in ground transportation sector is estimated by
assuming that the relative magnitude in car counts (and thus emissions) follow the similar
relationship with TomTom. So the emissions were quantified by the prediction interval of
the regression.
-

Aviation: Uncertainties in the aviation CO2 emissions are difficult to assess. Sources

of uncertainties arise from the ICCT (2018) estimate used to scale emissions, the lack of
completeness of the flight database and the fixed average conversion factor between
kilometre flown and CO2 emissions. These last two uncertainties should have a limited
impact as we do not expect a change between 2019 and 2020 in database completeness
and in the average fleet composition. In the study the uncertainty of aviation sector comes
from the difference of daily emission data estimated based on the two methods. We
calculate the average difference between the daily emission results estimated based on the
flight route distance and the number of flights, and then divide the average difference by
the average of the daily emissions estimated by the two methods to obtain the uncertainty
of CO2 from aviation sector.
-

Shipping: We used the uncertainty analysis from IMO as our uncertainty estimate for
shipping emissions. According to Third IMO Greenhouse Gas study 2014 33, the
uncertainty of shipping emissions was 13% based on bottom-up estimates.

-

Residential: The 2-sigma uncertainty in daily emissions are estimated as 40%, which is
calculated based on the comparison with daily residential emissions derived from real fuel
consumptions in several European countries including France, Great Britain, Italy,

Belgium, and Spain.
The uncertainty of emission projection in 2019 is estimated as 2.2%, by combining the
reported uncertainty of the projected growth rates and the EDGAR estimates in 2018.
Then we combine all the uncertainties by following the error propagation equation from
IPCC. Eq. (21) is used to derive for the uncertainty of the sum, which could be used to
combine the uncertainties of all sectors:
𝑈𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 =

√ ∑(𝑈𝑠 ∙ 𝜇𝑠 )
|∑ 𝜇 𝑠|

(21)

Where 𝑈𝑠 and 𝜇 𝑠 are the percentage uncertainties and the uncertain quantities (daily mean
emissions) of sector 𝑠 respectively.
Eq. (22) is used to derive for the uncertainty of the multiplication, which is used to combine
the uncertainties of all sectors and of the projected emissions in 2019:
𝑈𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑙𝑙 = √ ∑ 𝑈𝑖2
