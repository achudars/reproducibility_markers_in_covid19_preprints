SUMMARY As of 2020, COVID-19 is spreading in the world. In Japan,
the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare developed COVID-19 ContactConfirming Application (COCOA). The researches to examine the effect
of COCOA are still not sufficient. We develop a mathematical model to
examine the effect of COCOA and show examined result.

Introduction

On June 19, 2020, the Japanese government developed and
released COVID-19 Contact-Confirming Application (COCOA) [1], which was the smartphone app to decrease the
number of COVID-19 infectors. By using COCOA, the
users can know whether or not they are contact with the infectors (refer to Fig. 1). If the close contact persons who
receive the contact information from the app are staying at
home, there is a possibility of decreasing the total infections
(because they may be infections).
We consider that the reduction effect of new infectors
increases as the usage rate of the app increases. However,
the usage rate of COCOA looks insufficient in Japan. As of
Oct. 2020, the number of install is about 18 million [1]. In
other words, the usage rate is about 15%. To increase the
usage rate, it is important to report the reduction effect by
the research (e.g. mathematical model and simulation etc.).
There are many researches on the model for estimating
the number of COVID-19 infectors. For example, Hou et
al. [2] showed that a measure of decreasing the contact with
the persons could effectively decrease the total infectors.
Chatterjee et al. [3] also conducted a simulation experiment
as a case study in India. The other simulation models of
COVID-19 were also reported in [4] [5] [6]. However, these
researches did not show the reduction effect of the app such
as COCOA.
The simulation model for estimating the effect of the
app on decreasing infectors were developed. For example,

Hinch et al. [7] used the individual-based network model and
Omae et al. [8] used the multi-agent simulation. However,
in the case of the infection disease estimation, the reliability
verification of the simulation results is difficult because the
researcher cannot experiment in the real world (i.e. we cannot calculate the differences between actual and estimated
results). As the alternative method to verify the reliability,
it is necessary to examine the effects by the various simulation methods and verify that the obtained results are similar.
However, the research to survey the effect of the app such
as COCOA to the number of total infectors is still insufficient. Therefore, we develop a calculation model to know
the app’s effect in this letter. We also examine whether or
not the results are similar between previous researches and
our model.

Calculation model
Definition of the effect of COCOA

We calculate the total infectors 𝐼𝑡 at the day 𝑡 as
𝐼𝑡 = 𝐼𝑡−1 + 𝑅𝑚 −1 (1 − 𝑝 2 )𝐼𝑡−1 − 𝑚 −1 𝐼𝑡−1
= 𝐼𝑡−1 (1 + 𝑅𝑚 −1 (1 − 𝑝 2 ) − 𝑚 −1 ),

(1)

where 𝑅 is a reproduction number. 𝑅 means the number of
new infectors that the single infector infects other persons
during total infection period. 𝑚 is the number of average
days for recovering from infection. Therefore, 𝑚 −1 in the
third term is recovery rate of single day. And 𝑅𝑚 −1 in the
second term is the number of new infectors of single day that

reproduced by one infector. 𝑝 is the usage rate of the app
in the total population. The first term 𝐼𝑡−1 shows the total
infectors at previous day. The second term 𝑅𝑚 −1 (1− 𝑝 2 )𝐼𝑡−1
shows the amount of new increased infectors. COCOA can
notice the contact information to a person who is contact with
an infector, only if both use the app. If only one uses the
app, COCOA cannot notice the information to a close contact
person. Moreover, the app’s usage probability of infectors is
𝑝. And the app’s usage probability of close contact persons
is also 𝑝. Because a joint probability of them is 𝑝 2 , only this
percentage of newly infectors receive contact information.
We assume that close contact persons who receive the contact
information from the app do not go outside (i.e stay home).
In this case, they infect nobody. Therefore, we can define
the amount of new increased infectors is 𝑅𝑚 −1 (1 − 𝑝 2 )𝐼𝑡−1 .
The third term 𝑚 −1 𝐼𝑡−1 is the amount of decreased infectors
by the recover or death. Eq.(1) was developed by partially
referring to the equation for solving the number of infector
in SIR model [9].
In the case of using the number of initial infectors 𝐼0 ,
we can express 𝐼𝑡 from Eq.(1) as:
𝐼𝑡 = 𝐼0 (1 + 𝑅𝑚 −1 (1 − 𝑝 2 ) − 𝑚 −1 ) 𝑡 .

(2)

The proof of Eq.(2) is given in the appendix.
Then, the relative rate of the total number of infectors
whether to use the app is 𝐼𝑡 ( 𝑝)/𝐼𝑡 ( 𝑝 = 0). Therefore, the
effect of the usage rate of the app 𝑝 on decreasing infectors
can be defined as:
𝐼𝑡 ( 𝑝)
𝐼𝑡 ( 𝑝 = 0)
(1 + 𝑅𝑚 −1 (1 − 𝑝 2 ) − 𝑚 −1 ) 𝑡
,
= 1−
(1 + 𝑅𝑚 −1 − 𝑚 −1 ) 𝑡

𝐸 𝑡 ( 𝑝) = 1 −

Turning point by the usage rate of the app 𝑝 between
infection spread and convergence

In this section, we describe the turning point between infection spread and convergence by using the app. Based on
Eq.(1), the coefficient of the amount increasing infectors is
𝑅𝑚 −1 (1 − 𝑝 2 ), and the coefficient of the amount decreasing
infectors is 𝑚 −1 . Therefore, if 𝑅𝑚 −1 (1− 𝑝 2 ) = 𝑚 −1 , the total
infectors 𝐼𝑡 does not increase. In other words,
𝑅𝑚 −1 (1 − 𝑝 2 ) = 𝑚 −1 , i.e. 𝑅(1 − 𝑝 2 ) = 1,

(4)

is the condition of convergence of spreading infection disease. We solve for 𝑝, then,
𝑝 = (1 − 𝑅 −1 ) 1/2 .

(5)

Eq.(5) means that, to lead the spreading infection to convergence, the required usage rate 𝑝 of app depends on the
reproduction number of virus 𝑅. The relationship between
𝑝 and 𝑅 by Eq.(5) are shown in Table.1. As 𝑅 increases, the
required 𝑝 also increases.
The reproduction number 𝑅 of COVID-19 is between
1.4 and 2.5 [10]. 𝑅 of SARS which is prevailed in 2003

Table 1 Turning point between infection spread and convergence: the
relationship between 𝑅 and 𝑝 in Eq.(5)
𝑅 1.0 1.25 1.50 1.75 2.00 2.25 2.50 2.75
𝑝 0.0% 44.7% 57.7% 65.5% 70.7% 74.5% 77.5% 79.8%

in Hong-Kong is about 2.7 [11]. 𝑅 of seasonal influenza is
about 1.3 [12]. Therefore, we consider that the app such as
COCOA is effective to various infection disease.
Moreover, we consider the limitation of 𝑝 for 𝑅:
lim 𝑝 = lim (1 − 𝑅 −1 ) 1/2 = 1.
𝑅→∞

(6)

𝑅→∞

This means that even if the epidemic of infection disease
of very high 𝑅 occuers, when everyone use the app i.e.
𝑝 = 100%, the spread of infection will be overcame. It is
important to appropriately use the app for us.
Since our model is simple, there are some limitations.
For example, there is a time lag between an infector being
infected and registering to the app in real world. We did
not consider it. However, we emphasize that the model by
simple calculation is important to understand the effect of
COCOA on decreasing infectors

Simulation

3.1

Condition

To calculate the effect of the app by using our models, we set
the following condition. The initial infectors 𝐼0 is 50 persons.
The maximum of simulation days is 50 days. We consider
the usage rates of the app: 𝑝 = 0, 20, · · · , 80, 100%.
We explain about 𝑅, which is the number of new infectors that the single infector infects other persons. According
to WHO, the reproduction number of COVID-19 is from 1.4
to 2.5 [10]. Therefore, we use 𝑅 = 2.0.
COCOA can send the notification of the contact information last 2 weeks [1]. We assume the total infection period
of COVID-19 is 2 weeks (14 days) i.e. 𝑚 = 14. In other
words, we use the coefficient in the second term of Eq.(1)
𝑅𝑚 −1 = 2/14 ' 0.143 and the coefficient in third term of
Eq.(1) 𝑚 −1 = 1/14 ' 0.071.
3.2

Results and discussions

The result of the calculation of the total infectors 𝐼𝑡 by Eq.(2)
is shown in Fig. 2. In the case of the usage rate 𝑝 = 0%,
the number of total infectors is over 1,400 persons. Moreover, as 𝑝 increases, the total infectors decreases. The most
notable point is 𝑝 = 60%. In this case, the total infectors
is nearly flat (slightly increased). When 𝑝 = 80 and 100%,
the total infectors decrease. In other words, we can interpret
that the spread of COVID-19 is the end. This result has
similar tendency to the result obtained by Hinch et al. [7]
based on the individual-based network model and Omae et
al. [8] based on multi-agent simulation. They reported the
spreading COVID-19 is convergence if the usage rate of the
app over 60%. Therefore, we emphasize that our developed

mathematical model supports the results of Hinch et al. [7]
and Omae et al. [8]. The point of appearing similar result by
various methods is important.
The effect of the usage rate of the app 𝑝 in 𝐸 𝑡 (Eq.(3)) is
shown in Fig. 3. As the basic trends, the reduction effect of
the number of infectors increases over the time. Moreover,
as 𝑝 increases, the effect increases. However, even if the
usage rate of the app is low (e.g. 𝑝 = 20%), the reduction
effect appears steadily.

Conclusion

In this letter, we reported the effect of the app such as COCOA on decreasing infectors based on the simple calculation model. As the result, we could understand the features/dynamics of the total infectors because we incorporated
the usage rate of the app into the model. However, other important parameters did not be incorporated and considered
in this letter. One of them is the registration rate of infection.
If infectors that use the app reject the registration of infection information, COCOA will not work. Our model assume
that all infectors who use the app register the infection information. Moreover, we assume that close contact persons
who received the contact information from the app do not
go outside (i.e stay home). We consider that some persons
go outside without worrying about the contact notifications.
Thus, our developed model can be interpreted as the upper
limit of the effect. Therefore, we incorporate their points
into the model as future works. Finally, we will develop
more desirable model to estimate the effect of COCOA.

Appendix: Proof of Eq.(2)
We explain the proof of Eq.(2) from Eq.(1) of all natural
number 𝑡 by using mathematical induction.
When 𝑡 = 1, Eq.(1) is
𝐼1 = 𝐼0 (1 + 𝑅𝑚 −1 (1 − 𝑝 2 ) − 𝑚 −1 ),

(7)

and Eq.(2) is
𝐼1 = 𝐼0 (1 + 𝑅𝑚 −1 (1 − 𝑝 2 ) − 𝑚 −1 ).

(8)

Then, Eq.(7) equals Eq.(8) i.e. when 𝑡 = 1, Eq.(1) equals
Eq.(2).
After that, we assume Eq.(1) equals Eq.(2) when 𝑡 = 𝑘
(𝑘 is a natural number). In other words,
𝐼 𝑘 = 𝐼0 (1 + 𝑅𝑚 −1 (1 − 𝑝 2 ) − 𝑚 −1 ) 𝑘 ,

(9)

is true by Eq.(2).
When 𝑡 = 𝑘 + 1, Eq.(1) is
𝐼 𝑘+1 = 𝐼 𝑘 (1 + 𝑅𝑚 −1 (1 − 𝑝 2 ) − 𝑚 −1 )
= 𝐼0 (1 + 𝑅𝑚 −1 (1 − 𝑝 2 ) − 𝑚 −1 ) 𝑘+1 .

(10)

Note that we use Eq.(9).
When 𝑡 = 𝑘 + 1, Eq.(2) is
𝐼 𝑘+1 = 𝐼0 (1 + 𝑅𝑚 −1 (1 − 𝑝 2 ) − 𝑚 −1 ) 𝑘+1 .

(11)

Thus, Eq.(10) equals Eq.(11) when 𝑡 = 𝑘 + 1.
Therefore, Eq.(1) equals Eq.(2) when all natural numbers 𝑡.
