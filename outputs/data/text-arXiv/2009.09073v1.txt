Abstract
Battle with COVID-19 turned out to be a marathon, not a sprint, and behavioral adjustments
have been unavoidable to stay viable. In this paper, we employ a data-centric approach to
investigate individual mobility adaptations and mask-wearing in Seoul, South Korea. We first
identify six epidemic phases and two waves based on COVID-19 case count and its geospatial
dispersion. The phase-specific linear models reveal the strong, self-driven mobility reductions in
the first escalation and peak with a common focus on public transit use and less-essential
weekend/afternoon trips. However, comparable reduction was not present in the second wave, as
the shifted focus from mobility to mask-wearing was evident. Although no lockdowns and gentle
nudge to wear mask seemed counter-intuitive, simple and persistent communication on personal
safety has been effective and sustainable to induce cooperative behavioral adaptations. Our phasespecific analyses and interpretation highlight the importance of targeted response consistent with
the fluctuating epidemic risk.

1. Introduction
Mobility intervention has been embraced as one of the most effective and immediate control
measures since the early days of COVID-19 pandemic, and universal quarantines such as
lockdown and shelter-in-place have shown measurable success. Sjödin et al.1 conducted a
modeling study to show that the lockdown duration could be shortened when household size and
time spent outside one’s home were brief. Since household size could not be easily changed, the
study concluded that strict quarantine measures are the key to reduce its duration. Leung et al. 2
showed that reproduction number has dropped below 1 after lockdowns in 14 Chinese provinces,
and the fatality risk could also be decreased. Based on the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered model,
the study projected that premature relaxation of lockdown measures would increase the cumulative
case count exponentially. López and Rodó3 used a stochastic Susceptible-Exposed-InfectiousRecovered to project the epidemic progression after lockdown, suggesting that another larger scale
infection wave is likely if lockdown measures were alleviated prematurely and abruptly.
Although strong mobility stringency can minimize uncertainties arising from individual
differences to achieve prompt and well-coordinated response, high social and economic costs have
been inevitable. Suppressing personal mobility was found to deepen economic inequalities4,5,
generate disconnects among communities6, and even cause mental illness7. As the pandemic
prolonged, concerns over accumulating costs and exit strategies have deepened. Phased exit
strategy, prioritizing people at the highest risk, and managing misinformation were suggested to
reduce unintended cost in the post-lockdown period8.
Another key control measure of massive testing and contact-tracing has shown promising
outcomes in several countries including South Korea9. However, a recent study found that such
approaches are feasible only when case numbers remain at a manageable level, and the success of
prevention measures depends on the population’s behavioral changes in response10. Hellewell et
al.11 stated that contact tracing and isolation without mobility reduction might not be sufficient to

3

contain the outbreak under plausible scenarios.
Even if the testing-contact-tracing has been effective to contain the outbreak, it cannot serve
as a direct incentive to induce behavioral adaptations. The main motivation of our study is
consistent with the aforementioned studies, and we aim to evaluate the role of mobility when case
numbers remain at a traceable level. Several recent studies also emphasized the need to understand
behavioral aspects and perception changes regarding policy adherence12, and the importance of
mobility data analyses for a broader understanding of the efficacy of public communication and
social distancing interventions13. Despite the urgent need for adaptive mobility policy targeting
behavioral adaptations, there are limited academic and technical resources available. It is
encouraging, however, that an increasing number of researches utilize large-scale near-real time
datasets to study the interrelationship among mobility change, social impact, and policy
response5,6,14.
In this paper, we employ data-centric approaches to trace the evolution of mobility behavioral
adaptation and its relationship to epidemic progression in Seoul, South Korea for the first 189 days
(27 weeks). As the 4th country infected with COVID-19, the nation had been the worst-affected
country outside China in the beginning15. However, the nation has managed to control the infection
rate under 20.99 per million population since January 20, 2020 without lockdown-type mandates.
The nation’s capital Seoul also has been able to contain the maximum daily confirmed cases under
52 or 5.34 per million population in the same period with minimal mobility restrictions.
Due to the time-dependent and transient nature of epidemic progression and mobility patterns,
modeling their relationship over the entire 27 weeks is meaningless. As the first step, we propose
a framework to identify epidemic phases based on the case count as well as the geospatial spread
of COVID-19. The mobility patterns are represented with the reductions in subway ridership
(public transit) and traffic volume (private mode) compared to the same period of 2019, given the
mobility network under full operations. Association between mobility and epidemic progression

4

is then modeled as linear models in six epidemic phases using a changing point detection technique.
Seasonality specific to mobility including the day-of-week and the time-of-day effect is also
evaluated to discover common focus in mobility decisions. Lastly, findings from the statistical
analyses are assessed with risk perception and facemask use in a collective manner.

2. Method
2.1. Determination of epidemic phases
The major transitions in epidemic progression were determined by detecting the major
structural changes in daily case counts with a changing point detection (CPD) method of
breakpoint detection algorithms16,17. The algorithms simultaneously detect the major interventions
in sequential data, and have been widely used in multiple disciplines including finance18-21,
genetics22,23, climate change24,25, social science26-28, ecology29, and geology30,31. In our analysis,
the intercept-only linear model of 𝑦 = 𝛽0 + 𝜖 was assumed to detect the day of major structural
change, and used in the COVID-19 case count analysis and the mobility seasonality analysis.
Although the breakpoint analysis method detects the structural changes in a robust manner,
sequential data in general represent long-term trends in a retrospective manner, and is sensitive to
the timespan under investigation. To complement such shortcomings, we propose to measure the
geospatial progression of COVID-19 in addition to the confirmed case count. Conceptually, it is
intuitive that quantifying spatial dispersion provides useful insights for an infectious disease like
COVID-19, as the risk cannot be the same when 100 new cases are located in a single location
versus spread evenly across a region. Methodologically, we employed two topological measures
of grouped distance (𝑑𝑔 ) and Hausdorff distance (𝑑𝐻 ). Since both measures represent the distance
between two sets, one can reduce the two-day changes into single metrics. If the daily case
sequence represents the long-term trend, the topological measures are designed to capture the
short-term momentum.

Given the set of locations exposed by COVID-19 patients, which we call the contact locations,
let

𝑃𝑡 = {𝑝𝑡 : 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑐𝑡 𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 𝑜𝑛 𝑑𝑎𝑦 𝑡} be the set of all contact locations of day t. The

grouped

distance

between

1
∑
‖𝑝𝑡
|𝑃𝑡 |∙|𝑃𝑡+1 | 𝑝𝑡 ∈𝑃𝑡 ,𝑝𝑡+1 ∈𝑃𝑡+1

𝑃𝑡

𝑃𝑡+1

and

is

defined

as

𝑑𝑔 (𝑃𝑡 , 𝑃𝑡+1 ) =

− 𝑝𝑡+1 ‖. It is the average distance to reach from a point in 𝑃𝑡 to

points in 𝑃𝑡+1, representing proximity of two sets. While small 𝑑𝑔 indicates 𝑃𝑡 and 𝑃𝑡+1 are
more concentrated in a local cluster, large 𝑑𝑔
distance is defined as 𝑑𝐻 (𝑃𝑡+1 , 𝑃𝑡 ) =

max

indicates they are more scattered. Hausdorff

min ‖𝑝𝑡+1 − 𝑝𝑡 ‖, which is the maximum distance

𝑝𝑡+1 ∈𝑃𝑡+1 𝑝𝑡 ∈𝑃𝑡

to reach from 𝑃𝑡+1 to 𝑃𝑡 . Large 𝑑𝐻 is observed when at least one new case occurred far from
the existing mass.
Both measures are bounded between 0 and the length of the major axis of the geographical
boundary. Theoretically, both measures can reach zero if the existing mass was a single cluster,
and new cases also belong to the same cluster. Likewise, both measures can reach near the
maximum when new cases are located in the opposite corner from the existing mass. Once the
contact locations start to spread and fill up the region, 𝑑𝑔 will remain close to half of the
maximum, while 𝑑𝐻 will be much smaller than that. More formally, 𝑑𝐻 > 𝑑𝑔 means that there
exists at least one location on day 𝑡 + 1 that contains none of the contact locations of day 𝑡
within the radius of 𝑑𝑔 . Conversely, 𝑑𝑔 > 𝑑𝐻 means that all locations of day 𝑡 + 1 contain at
least one of the locations of day 𝑡 within 𝑑𝑔 . In our context, new cases need to be closer to the
existing mass when existing cases are scattered with less concentration, yielding 𝑑𝑔 ≫ 𝑑𝐻 , which
is the geospatial peak. In the analysis, the metric 𝑑𝑔 − 𝑑𝐻 was used to identify the geospatial
peak period compared to the geospatial contraction and expansion.
Once the epidemic phases of trigger, escalation, peak, and de-escalation phases were
established using both the count interventions and the topological metric, the relationship between
mobility and epidemic progression was modeled as linear models by individual phases. In the
6

bivariate linear model, the response variable is the mobility reduction, and the COVID-19 count
is the regressor.

2.2. Data
There are four main datasets used in the study – the hourly subway ridership and traffic volume,
COVID-19 case counts and contact locations, risk perception of COVID-19 infection, and
universal mask adoption rate. While the mobility and COVID-19 data were direct observations,
risk perception and mask adoption rate were based on Likert scale responses sourced from a series
of cross-sectional surveys. Subway ridership included the number of passengers getting on and off
at 275 stations of subway lines 1 through 8, aggregated in hourly intervals. Traffic volume included
the number of vehicles at 100 sensor stations located in the city’s major road links. To incorporate
the strong seasonality in mobility demand, changes were measured in the amount of reduction
𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 𝑜𝑓 2020

compared to the same period of 2019 as 1 − 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒

𝑜𝑓 2019

, by matching the closest day-of-week.

For instance, Friday, February 7, 2020, was matched with Friday, February 8, 2019. COVID-19
daily confirmed case counts and contact tracing information were sourced from multiple sources
including Kaggle COVID-19 open data, KCDC (Korea Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention), and Seoul Metropolitan government. Daily data values are 7-day simple moving
averages unless noted otherwise.
Regarding risk perception and universal mask adoption rate, we resorted to several
independent survey results due to the lack of direct observation data and its highly qualitative
nature. Two types of risk perception—overall risk of COVID-19 and risk of personal infection—
were obtained from biweekly surveys conducted by Hankook Research. Overall risk of COVID19 represents the percentage of people who responded that the spread of the pandemic within the
nation was “very” or “somewhat” serious. Risk of personal infection represents the percentage of
people who responded that the likelihood of contracting the virus was more than or equal to 50%32.
7

The rate of universal mask adoption was based on five independent survey outcomes33-37, which
captured the proportion of the surveyed having worn masks whenever necessary. Additional details
and availability of data used are included in the supplementary.
3. Results
3.1. Determination of COVID-19 phases
In Figure 1-a, the breakpoint analysis results of COVID-19 case count trend are shown with
four interventions, yielding five phases divided on day 50, 82, 128, 156. In Figure 1-b, 𝑑𝑔 − 𝑑𝐻
is shown with four transition days on 29, 82, 106, 169. When combined, we have 7 transition points
in total. Although not detected in case counts, day 28 can be considered as the transition from a
trigger to an escalation phase. Day 50 is the start of the peak phase in the first wave. Day 82 is the
transition from the peak to a de-escalation. Day 106 divides the third phase into the de-escalation
of the first wave and the escalation of the second wave. Day 128 is the start of the second wave
peak. Although one can speculate day 156 is the start of a de-escalation, the case counts are not
low enough compared to the first de-escalation. Moreover, 𝑑𝑔 − 𝑑𝐻 stayed positive until day 168,
suggesting the second peak had continued closer to 168. Although the validity of spatial dispersion
results after day 169 is limited due to the contact location availability (see Supplementary Note 1),
it is unlikely that the city had entered a de-escalation phase with 𝑑𝑔 − 𝑑𝐻 being mostly positive.
As results, we defined six epidemic phases as the trigger (1-29), escalation-1 (30-50), peak-1 (5182), de-escalation (83-106), escalation-2 (107-128), and peak-2 (129-189).

3.2. Association between epidemic progression and mobility
Linear model results are shown in Figure 2. In subway ridership, an addition of a single case
resulted in an additional 4.1% reduction in escalation-1, which converted to a 0.5% recovery in
escalation-2. In traffic volume, the additional reduction was 1.3% in escalation-1, and a 0.1%
recovery in escalation-2. Between two peaks, the constant 40.8% subway ridership reduction in
peak-1 was decreased to 20.9% in peak-2. Traffic volume shows recovery from an 8.8% reduction
to 4.2% with a 0.1% additional recovery per additional new case.
The results provide several useful insights. The reduction ratio between public transit (subway)
9

to private trip mode (traffic volume) was approximately 4 to 1, manifesting the strong shift in mode
preference. One can also infer that the reductions of approximately 40% in public transit use and
10% in traffic volume are possible upper-bounds of voluntary mobility adjustment, and equivalent
to 32 day delay to enter the de-escalation phase. Strong positive linearity in escalation-1 combined
with the maximum reduction throughout peak-1 indicates the public’s willingness to embrace
behavioral adjustment with rising infection risk, even without stringent mobility policy. However,
conversion from the strong positive in the first escalation to marginally negative linearity in the
second indicates significant changes in the public’s perception of mobility as the main means of
personal safety.

3.3. Seasonality in mobility
Since mobility patterns are embedded with strong seasonality, mobility patterns were evaluated
for its time-of-day and day-of-week effects. As shown in Figure 3, the overall trends of two trip
modes are similar except in magnitude, and public transit demand continues to recover as early as
day 63 (week 9). The subway ridership shows reductions at least three times larger than traffic
volume, which agrees with our findings in section 3.2. It is also worth noting that the subway has
continued operations during the epidemic, serving more than 50% of the usual demand. Despite
the strong preference shift to private mode, public transit has remained a vital urban mobility
option, especially to those with limited mode choices.
It is notable that the first major interventions of two modes agree on day 34 (week 5), which is
before any major government response is put in place. Moreover, weekends, nighttime, and
afternoon trips show larger reductions compared to weekdays and commute hours. Under low
policy stringency, such outcomes strongly suggest that early mobility reduction had been driven
by proactive individual adaptations with a common focus on reducing non-essential trips while
preserving the essential commute trips in private mode. Continuous recovery after the deescalation signifies changes in public perception regarding the role of mobility, which agrees with
our findings in section 3.2.

weekday, and weekend plots show the day-of-week effect in mobility reductions. Commute hours
(7AM-9AM & 6PM-8PM), afternoon (2PM-5PM) and nighttime (9PM-12AM) plots show timeof-day effect.

3.4. Mobility, risk perception and universal facemask use
In this section, subway ridership reduction is assessed with the public risk perception, as it is
the main trigger of the behavioral adjustment. In Figure 4, bi-weekly public survey outcomes32 on
overall risk of COVID-19 (shown in solid square) vs. risk of personal infection (shown in triangle)
are shown. The rate of universal mask use (shown in circle) and subway ridership reduction
percentage (shown in blue) are also included. Overall, the personal infection risk perception shares
the key characteristics of epidemic phases, as it increased during two escalation phases, remained
over 70% during two peaks, and decreased during the de-escalation.
It is notable that the universal facemask wearing had already reached over 60% in escalation1. Considering the official promotion on universal face covering had started and remained as a
recommendation from day 63 (peak-1) to day 217 (peak-2), the public’s awareness on the benefit
12

of facemask had been in place much earlier than the government recommendation. As some studies
suggested38, the high compliance level is likely the result of the past infectious outbreak
experiences amplified by the current epidemic risk. Since escalation-2, mask use exceeded both
the personal infection risk perception and the subway ridership reduction. The mask-wearing
experiences in the earlier period seemed to have led the public to embrace the facemask as the
longer-term personal safety measure, especially in returning to one’s mobility routines.
It is also worth noting that the personal risk perception remained higher than the overall
epidemic risk perception in the second wave. The government’s social distancing level also stayed
at the lowest Level 11 during peak-2, since its level is solely determined by the case count trend.
When the geospatial momentum is considered, it is evident that Seoul had missed the opportunity
to contain the second peak, and the inopportune timing of national economic stimulus to promote
in-person shopping and dining since day 10639. However, the high level of public’s risk perception
remained as the main force to prevent rapid resurgence despite the reactive government response.

South Korea has adopted a three-level social distancing scheme, where the level of
intervention is determined based on weekly average case count and reproduction number
within the region. In Seoul Metropolitan area, elevation from Level 1 to Level 2 occurs when
the weekly average case count exceeds 40 and the reproduction number is higher than or equal
to 1.3 40. Elevation from Level 2 to Level 3 occurs when a) two-week average daily toll exceeds
100 and b) daily case count is doubled from the previous day two times within a week, but after
c) careful review on the potential impact on the social, economic and medical costs as well as
public and expert opinions. More details are included in Supplementary Information.

COVID-19 is the percentage who responded that the spread of the pandemic within the nation was
“very” or “somewhat” serious32. Risk of personal infection is the percentage who responded that
the likelihood of contracting the virus was more than or equal to 50%32. The rate of universal mask
use33-37 is the proportion who responded they have worn masks whenever necessary such as in
public space.

4. Discussion
In this paper, behavioral changes during COVID-19 outbreak were evaluated in Seoul, South
Korea focusing on mobility and facemask use under the marginal mobility restriction. The
epidemic phases were defined based on case count and geospatial momentum. Through the phasespecific analyses, we unraveled the true nature of inter-dependency among the epidemic
progression, mobility, facemask and public perception. Linear models between mobility reduction
and COVID-19 case counts revealed strong linearities during the escalation and de-escalation
14

phases of the first wave, manifesting their interactive nature. The second wave turned out to be not
another repetition of the first wave, as mobility continued to recover regardless of fluctuating
COVID-19 risk. The public’s risk perception showed their vigilance to closely monitor the
epidemic progression. As the pandemic persisted for a longer period, the shift in focus from
mobility to facemask was evident as the main means of personal safety. The results and
interpretations were only visible after establishing the epidemic phases, which demonstrates the
significance of multi-faceted data collection and analyses to trace the evolving evidence of the
ongoing pandemic.
Although low mobility stringency and gentle nudge on mask-wearing seemed counterintuitive to fight a pandemic, evidence from South Korea indicated otherwise. Our study
demonstrated the self-driven nature of behavioral adaptations with shifted focus from mobility
reduction to facemask use, showing their substitutive nature. However, KCDC noted in July
briefing that mask-wearing rate fell close to 50% in the indoor facilities such as restaurants and
coffee shops, where 2-meter distancing is rarely abided41. The recent domestic resurgence from
day 207 (week 30) are mostly the clusters originated from close contacts in groups such as in
restaurants and churches42, pushing the contact-tracing near the full capacity. Reflecting on the
effectiveness of mobility reduction in the first escalation, our observations from the second peak
manifest that facemask cannot be a perfect substitute for mobility restriction. Mobility policy
should be the main prevention measure during the escalation and peak phases while the facemasks
should serve a key enabler for the fluid mobility recovery during the de-escalation.
COVID-19 is a pandemic we have never experienced in our modern history, but it might not
be the last. Learning from the evolving evidence on behavioral adaptations and the resulting public
cooperation will have a long-lasting impact to fight this pandemic, and to prepare for the next.
However, understanding behavioral changes amid the unprepared pandemics such as COVID-19
is a tall order. As future research, we suggest the following topics for the broader academic

15

communities to explore.
In mobility, our study specifically focused on trip modes in mobility pattern mining, since they
are direct observations and have been in service the whole period. From the transportation
economics perspective, however, not only the trip mode but also the trip purposes need to be
evaluated to fully capture the behavioral aspects, as the mode is a mere means to achieve one’s
trip purpose. Therefore, expansive data analytics on trip purposes are imperative for adaptive and
targeted mobility control. Moreover, analyses on trip purpose may validate the efficacy of various
mobility controls, and to identify the high-risk sectors. Incorporating demographic groups such as
age, gender and occupations may also broaden our understanding.
In epidemiology, a broader set of metrics might be helpful to monitor and track the progression
closer to real-time. In the prolonged battle with COVID-19, the importance of timely response
empowered by fast data tracking is no less than searching for the ultimate medical interventions.
The changing point detection method and geospatial progression measures effectively captured the
progression of the outbreak on multiple ends. Further geometric pattern mining methodology such
as topological data analysis43 may reveal the spatial characteristics even further, which has critical
implications in the infectious outbreaks as COVID-19. The necessary condition of data availability
and methodological validation must be met, and requires active and collaborative contributions of
broader academic disciplines.
In policy, there needs to be a framework to evaluate the efficacy and relevance of key control
measures in a systematic and collective manner. Although the testing-contact tracing-isolating has
proved successful in South Korea44, the process of contact tracing had unintended social impacts,
especially on the underrepresented populations45-46. Moreover, adherence to contact tracing has
put growing pressure on the nation’s universal healthcare system, and required an enormous
sacrifice of the healthcare professionals47. Our study outcome strongly suggests that the public is
willing to adapt to a reasonable level of mobility restriction, which can alleviate the enduring

16

pressure on the national healthcare infrastructure. Contribution of facemasks and social distancing
needs to be considered as a set of policies than of competing interests.

Supplementary Note 1. COVID-19 epidemiological data description
The epidemiological data of the first 189 days consists of two datasets: COVID-19 daily
tolls and contact tracing information. COVID-19 daily toll data is collected from KCDC46, and
contact tracing information is sourced from the Kaggle COVID-19 open data47 for the first
133 days from the Seoul Metropolitan government48 since day 134. The daily toll includes
the number of cases confirmed between 0:00 and 23:59 on the same day. Before day 43, the
daily toll referred to cases confirmed between 16:00 of the previous day and 15:59 of the day.
Contact tracing information is the itinerary of a confirmed patient from a few days before
the symptom onset to the day of quarantine49. If a patient shows no symptoms at the time of
quarantine, the itinerary of the patient is collected from a few days before the day of testing
to the day of quarantine. The itinerary is recorded with the coordinates of stores, buildings
visited, and the means of transportation used each day. In the case of Seoul, the
administrative office of each of 25 districts (i.e. Gu) collects and publishes the itinerary
information of each patient on the administrative office’s webpage, and the Seoul
Metropolitan government also publishes the data collected from each district office on its
official webpage. The final contact tracing data used for the calculation of the geospatial
distance of Seoul up to day 189 contains 5,309 contact locations of 1,288 confirmed cases.
We have used anonymized contact tracing information provided by KCDC. For data
accessibility, please inquire directly to KCDC.
When the outbreak first occurred in South Korea, there was no clear policy on to what
extent the information should be disclosed. Before KCDC first distributed the first edition of
“the disclosure of itinerary and information of confirmed patients” on day 55 (March 14), some
privacy-sensitive information was disclosed without strict guidelines. Information released
during this period contained travel records of all places such as nightlife venues. The legal
guideline for information disclosure was first enacted on day 55 and has undergone two
amendments since then. When first published, the guideline defined the purpose of the
disclosure and specified the scope and details of information to be released. The guideline
stated that information, such as itinerary and close contacts*, should be disclosed to the
extent that no individual can be specified; particular places and transportation modes where
unknown contacts might have occurred should be informed to the public. Detailed addresses
and names of workplaces would not be disclosed unless virus transmission to unspecified
employees was expected. This edition stated that each municipal government “may not”
24

disclose the places where the confirmed patient stayed, if all contacts were confirmed.
The second edition of “the disclosure of itinerary and information of confirmed patients”
was published on April 12 (day 84). This edition stated that contact information should be
disclosed only for 14 days after the patient had the last contact. The time range was extended
to two days before the date of symptom onset or testing. This edition specified that each
government should notify the public about the sterilization status of places visited by
patients.
The third edition was announced on June 30 (day 163). This edition emphasized that each
patient’s information should be deleted 14 days after the patient had the last contact. The
guideline for protecting personal information has also been changed so that gender, age,
nationality, detailed address (only provide Gu-wise information) of residence, and names of
workplaces are not disclosed. Since this edition, information to be released has been in the
form of a list of visited places, including region, type, name, and address of the facility,
exposed date, and status of sterilization, instead of the itinerary form. In addition, if all
contacts in a particular place have been identified, the information of the place visited by a
patient “should not” be disclosed to the public. The information of cluster cases is to be
announced by KCDC, not by municipalities. Supplementary Table 3 summarizes the changes
in “the disclosure of itinerary and information of confirmed patients” over the three editions.
The electrical signature check-in system, launched on June 10 (day 143), has indirectly
affected the accessibility of contact tracing data. After the implementation of the system,
investigators have been able to trace the close contacts of confirmed patients with more
completion. As stated in “the disclosure of itinerary and information of confirmed patients”,
each local government “may not” (day 84-162) or “should not” (day 163-ongoing) disclose
the place visited by a patient if all the contacts have been identified. As this guideline was
changed to “should not reveal such locations” on day 163, there have been more cases that
all contacts are identified through an electric signature check-in system, leaving a
considerable portion of contact location information unpublished.
The electrical signature check-in system had undergone a pilot period from June 1 (day
134) to June 7 (day 140) and began operation from June 10 (day 143). The period prior to
June 30 (day 163) was the pre-implementation period where no legal penalties were
imposed. Initially, implementation has been required in eight facilities classified as high-risk,

25

including pubs, nightclubs, colatech (non-alcohol nightclub), karaoke, indoor group exercise
facilities, and indoor standing concert hall. On June 12 (day 145), the Seoul metropolitan
government required large cram schools and PC cafes to implement the system, and on June
21 (day 154), the KCDC further classified buffet, large cram school, door-to-door sales
promotion facility, and logistics distribution center as high-risk facilities.

* Contacts indicate people that a COVID-19 confirmed patient may have been in contact with.
The scope of contacts is determined considering symptoms of the patient, mask-wearing
status, duration of the stay, and exposed situation. All contacts, both symptomatic and
asymptomatic, are subject to self-quarantine for 14 days with daily monitoring by public
health staff.

Supplementary Note 2. Mobility data description
The subway ridership and traffic volume of the year 2019 and 2020 are direct
observation counts. Subway ridership data was collected from Seoul Metro50 and consists of
the hourly number of passengers getting on and off at 275 stations. Traffic volume data,
consisting of hourly traffic volumes at 270 locations including major road links in Seoul such
as downtown areas, city borders, bridges, arterials, and city highways, was collected from
Seoul TOPIS51. We used traffic volume data of 100 locations with a missing rate of less than
0.25% in the analysis. Missing values were filled in with the median value of the traffic
volume of the week before and after. Reductions are measured by matching the closest dayof-week of 2020 to 2019. For instance, Friday, February 7, 2020 was matched with Friday,
February 8, 2019. Over the 189 days, there were seven holidays; Lunar New Year (January
24-27), Independence Movement Day (March 1), Buddha’s Birthday (April 30), Labor Day
(May 1), Children’s Day (May 5), the Parliamentary Election (April 15), and Memorial Day
(June 6). Holidays were matched with the corresponding 2019 holidays, except that the
quadrennial Parliamentary Election day was matched with the closest day-of-week. Both the
traffic volume and subway ridership data are provided in figshare45. For more details, please
refer to our data summary paper52.

27

Supplementary Note 3. Survey source description
Risk perception rate was obtained from a series of surveys conducted by Gallup Korea32. Risk
perception rate was measured as the percentage of respondents in Seoul (n=193; aged 18 or
over) who rated their level of worry related to coronavirus infection as “very worried” or
“somewhat worried”. We retrieved the risk perception trend from a total of 16 surveys, which
were conducted weekly between February 4 (day 16) and April 8 (day 80) and biweekly
between April 21 (day 93) and July 16 (day 179). The survey results have been posted on its
official website and are publicly available for research use32.
The two surveys33 conducted in early February (day 16) and April (day 74) measured
mask adoption rate by investigating the percentage of respondents across the nation
(n=2,002; aged 18 or over) who have used facemasks for protection against COVID-19.
Survey design and questionnaire are detailed in Jang et al. (2020). Gallup International also
surveyed the percentage of respondents across the nation (n=801; aged 18 or over) who have
adopted mask-wearing as a precautionary behavior in March (day 61)34. In addition, from a
series of surveys conducted in late February (day 40) (n=973)35, May (day 117) (n=1,000)36,
and June (day 162) (n=1,000)37, we collected the percentage of people across the nation who
responded that they have “always” worn facemasks over the past week when outside the
home. The late February survey design and results are detailed in Lee & You (2020), and the
May, June, and July survey results were retrieved from media releases36-37.

Supplementary Note 4. Policy responses in South Korea
Mobility restriction. To back up our statement that the nation has had marginal mobility
restriction, we summarize government responses adopted throughout COVID-19 (see
Supplementary Table 5). We also quantify the stringency of policy responses, by adopting
scoring criteria and method of Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT)53.
Specifically, we adopted two indices—government response index and mobility restriction
index— to show that mobility restriction has been relatively marginal compared to overall
government responses (see figure S1). Government response index, which was first
proposed in the working paper of OxCGRT, is based on 13 policy indicators including
workplace closure and stay-at-home requirement9. Mobility restriction index is calculated
based on only 3 indicators that directly constrain mobility: public transport closure, stay-athome requirement, and internal movement restriction. The types of indicators as well as the
scoring method used in this study are solely based on OxCGRT9. Scoring codebooks and
relevant sources are detailed in Supplementary Table 5.
In summary, the government has not mandated stay-at-home for the public, as of Aug 13.
The official advice has been a recommendation on not-leaving-house, even throughout strict
social distancing period (day 63-91). Public transport has not been closed during COVID-19.
Internal movement restriction was also on recommending to refrain from traveling from/to
special disaster zones. Please see Supplementary Table 5 for a detailed description and
references.

Figure S1. Government response index and mobility restriction index, based on OxCGRT
Facemask policy responses. KCDC’s official advice for mask-wearing before day 63 was that
mask-wearing is only recommended for those showing symptoms, those caring for people
with symptoms, those visiting medical facilities, those working in environments with a high
29

risk of infection, and those with underlying illness54. Only since strict social distancing (day
63), KCDC has recommended the general public to wear masks in crowded indoor spaces55.
Mask wearing has been also mandatory in public transport in Seoul from day 115 and in the
nation from day 12856.
