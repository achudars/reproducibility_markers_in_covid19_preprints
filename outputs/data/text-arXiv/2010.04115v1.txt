Abstract Nowadays, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses a great threat to
public health and economy worldwide. Unfortunately, there is yet no effective drug for
this disease. For this, several countries have adopted multiple preventive interventions
to avoid the spread of COVID-19. Here, we propose a delayed mathematical model to
predict the epidemiological trend of COVID-19 in Morocco. Parameter estimation
and sensitivity analysis of the proposed model are rigorously studied. Moreover,
numerical simulations are presented in order to test the effectiveness of the preventive
measures and strategies that were imposed by the Moroccan authorities and also help
policy makers and public health administration to develop such strategies.
Keywords: COVID-19, coronavirus, mathematical modeling, basic reproduction
number, prediction.

1 Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that appeared in China
at the end of 2019. It is caused by a new type of virus belonging to the coronaviruses
family and recently named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) [1]. On March 11, 2020, COVID-19 was reclassified as a pandemic by
the World Health Organization (WHO). The disease spreads rapidly from country
to country, causing enormous economic damage and many deaths worldwide. The
first case of COVID-19 in Morocco was confirmed on March 2, 2020 in city of
Casablanca. It involved a Moroccan expatriate residing in Italy and who came from
Italy on February 27, 2020. As of April 17, 2020, the confirmed cases reached 2564
and the number of recoveries reached 281 with a total number of 135 deaths [2].
Moroccan authorities have implemented multiple preventive measures and strategies to control the spread of disease, such as the closing of borders, suspension of
schools and universities, closing coffee shops, the shut-down of all mosques in the
country, etc. Further, Morocco has declared a state of health emergency during the
period from March 20 to April 20, 2020, to avoid the spread of COVID-19. During
this period, movement during the day should be limited to work, shopping, medical
care, purchasing medicine, medical supplies, and emergency situations only. In addition, and from April 6, 2020, the wearing of a mask became compulsory for all
persons authorized to move.
Mathematical modeling of COVID-19 transmission has attracted the attention of
many scientists. Tang et al. [3] used a Susceptible–Exposed–Infectious–Recovered
(SEIR) compartmental model to estimate the basic reproduction number of COVID19 transmission based on data obtained for the confirmed cases of the disease in
mainland China. Wu et al. [4] provided an estimate of the size of the epidemic
in Wuhan on the basis of the number of cases exported from Wuhan to cities

outside mainland China by using a SEIR model. In [5], Kuniya applied the SEIR
compartmental model for the prediction of the epidemic peak for COVID-19 in Japan
by using the real-time data from January 15 to February 29, 2020. Fanelli and Piazza
[6] analyzed and forecasted COVID-19 spreading in China, Italy and France by using
a simple Susceptible–Infected–Recovered–Death (SIRD) model. The authors of [7]
present a mathematical model and study the dynamics of COVID-19 that emerged
recently in Wuhan, China. For a fractional (non-integer order) model see [8].
In the models cited above, the transmission of the disease was assumed to be
instantaneous and therefore they are formulated by ordinary differential equations
(ODEs), without time delays. In this study, we propose a mathematical model governed by delay differential equations (DDEs) to predict the epidemiological trend of
COVID-19 in Morocco and taking into account multiple preventive measures and
strategies implemented by Moroccan authorities, related to the confinement period
between March 2 and June 20, 2020, in order to control the spread of disease. To
do this, Section 2 deals with the formulation of the model. Section 3 is devoted
to parameters estimation and sensitivity analysis. Forecast of COVID-19 spreading
in Morocco is presented in Section 4. We end with a discussion of the results, in
Section 5.

2 Formulation of the model
Around the world, all the countries that are attacked by the COVID-19 have imposed
several strategies, with different degrees, to fight against it, namely the reduction
of some rights by adopting the quarantine method in order to prevent contacts
between vulnerable and infected individuals, closing the geographical borders of the
countries, and enforcing the capacity of the sanitary system. Similarly, the Kingdom
of Morocco quickly followed all of the previous strategies when the pandemic was
in its early stages.
Remark 1 The terms “susceptibility” and “vulnerability” are often used interchangeably for populations with disproportionate health burdens [9]. The distinction between vulnerability and susceptibility marks the difference between being intact
but fragile–vulnerable and being injured and predisposed to compound additional
harm–susceptible [10]. Here, we refer to “the potential to contract the COVID-19”
as vulnerability, to emphasize the environmental nature of the disease.
After the first reported positive case in Morocco, March 2, 2020, the closing of
schools and universities is done at March 16, 2020; the state of health emergency
(containment) is imposed to contain the outbreak from March 20, 2020; and the
closure of the borders is performed at March 24, 2020. Additionally, the face mask is
obligatory used in the general population at April 6, 2020. Based on these preventive
measures and strategies, we model the dynamics of the transmission of COVID-19 in
Morocco by extending the classical SIR model. Precisely, the population is divided
into eight classes, denoted by 𝑉, 𝐼𝑠 , 𝐼 𝑎 , 𝐹𝑏 , 𝐹𝑔 , 𝐹𝑐 , 𝑅 and 𝐷, where 𝑉 represents the

4

vulnerable sub-population, which is not infected and has not been infected before, but
is susceptible to develop the disease if exposed to the virus; 𝐼𝑠 is the symptomatic
infected sub-population, which has not yet been treated, it transmits the disease,
and outside of proper support it can progress to spontaneous recovery or death; 𝐼 𝑎
is the asymptomatic infected sub-population who is infected but does not transmit
the disease, it is not known by the health system and progresses spontaneously to
recovery; 𝐹𝑏 , 𝐹𝑔 and 𝐹𝑐 are the patients diagnosed, supported by the Moroccan
health system and under quarantine, and subdivided into three categories: benign,
severe, and critical forms, respectively. Finally, 𝑅 and 𝐷 are the recovered and died
classes. The schematic diagram of our extended model is illustrated in Figure 1.

Therefore, the extended model can be governed by the following system of DDEs:

where 𝑢 represents the level of control strategies on the vulnerable population. We
adopt the bilinear incidence rate to describe the infection of the disease and use
parameter 𝛽 to denote the transmission rate. It is reasonable to assume that the infected individuals are subdivided into individuals with symptoms and others without
symptoms, for which we employ the parameter 𝜖 to denote the proportion for the
symptomatic individuals and 1 − 𝜖 for the asymptomatic ones. The parameter 𝛼
measures the efficiency of public health administration for hospitalization. Diagnosed symptomatic infected population moves to the three forms: benign, severe and
critical, by the rates 𝛾𝑏 , 𝛾𝑔 and 𝛾𝑐 , respectively. The mean recovery period of these
forms are denoted by 1/𝑟 𝑏 , 1/𝑟 𝑔 and 1/𝑟 𝑐 , respectively. The later forms die also
with the rates 𝜇 𝑏 , 𝜇𝑔 and 𝜇 𝑐 , respectively. Symptomatic infected population, which
is not diagnosed, moves to the recovery compartment with a rate 𝜂 𝑠 or dies with a
rate 𝜇 𝑠 . On the other hand, asymptomatic infected population moves to the recovery
compartment with a rate 𝜂 𝑎 . The times delay 𝜏1 and 𝜏2 denote the incubation period
and the period time needed before hospitalization, respectively.
For biological reasons, we assume that the initial conditions of system (1) satisfy:
𝑉 (𝜃) = 𝜙1 (𝜃) ≥ 0,
𝐹𝑏 (𝜃) = 𝜙4 (𝜃) ≥ 0,
𝑅(𝜃) = 𝜙7 (𝜃) ≥ 0,

𝐼𝑠 (𝜃) = 𝜙2 (𝜃) ≥ 0, 𝐼 𝑎 (𝜃) = 𝜙3 (𝜃) ≥ 0,
𝐹𝑔 (𝜃) = 𝜙5 (𝜃) ≥ 0, 𝐹𝑐 (𝜃) = 𝜙6 (𝜃) ≥ 0,
𝐷 (𝜃) = 𝜙8 (𝜃) ≥ 0, 𝜃 ∈ [−𝜏, 0],

where 𝜏 = max{𝜏1 , 𝜏2 }. Let C = 𝐶 ( [−𝜏, 0], R8 ) be the Banach space of continuous
functions from the interval [−𝜏, 0] into R8 , equipped with the uniform topology. It
follows from the theory of functional differential equations [11] that system (1) with
initial conditions (𝜙1 , 𝜙2 , 𝜙3 , 𝜙4 , 𝜙5 , 𝜙6 , 𝜙7 , 𝜙8 ) ∈ C has a unique solution.
On the other hand, the basic reproduction number is an important threshold parameter that determines the spread of infection when the disease is introduced into
the population [12]. This number is defined as the expected number of secondary
cases produced, in a completely susceptible population, by a typical infective individual. By using the next generation matrix approach [13], the basic reproduction
number R 0 of system (1) is given by
R 0 = 𝜌(𝐹𝑉 −1 ) =

𝛽𝜖 (1 − 𝑢)
,
𝜂 𝑠 + 𝜇 𝑠 + 𝛼(𝛾𝑏 + 𝛾𝑔 + 𝛾𝑐 )

3 Parameter estimation and sensitivity analysis
Based on the daily published Moroccan data [14], we estimate the values of some
parameters of the model. The proportion of asymptomatic forms can vary from 20.6%

6

Zine, Lotfi, Mahrouf, Boukhouima, Aqachmar, Hattaf, Torres and Yousfi

of infected population to 39.9% [15]. Then, 𝜖 ∈ [0.61, 0.794]. The progression
rates 𝛾𝑏 , 𝛾𝑔 and 𝛾𝑐 from symptomatic infected individuals to the three forms are
assumed to be 80% of diagnosed cases for benign form, 15% of diagnosed cases for
severe form, and 5% of diagnosed cases for critical form, respectively [16]. The true
mortality of COVID-19 will take some time to be fully understood. The data we have
so far indicate that the crude mortality ratio (the number of reported deaths divided
by the reported cases) is between 3 and 4% [16]. As the Moroccan health system is
not overloaded at the moment, it is assumed that deaths mainly come from critical
cases with a percentage of 40% for an average period of 13.5 days [16]. Since the
mortality rate of symptomatic individuals differs from country to country [6], we
assume that 1% of symptomatic individuals die for an average period of 21 days,
whereas the recovery rate for asymptomatic cases is 100% and is the same for severe
and benign forms if a proper medical care is taken with an average period of 21 days.
We employ a least-square procedure with Poisson noise as in [5] to estimate the
transmission rate. The incubation period is estimated to be 5.5 days [17, 18] while
the time needed before hospitalization is estimated to be 7.5 days [19, 20, 21]. The
estimation of the above parameters is given in Table 1.

Sensitivity analysis is commonly used to determine the robustness of model
predictions to some parameter values. It is used to discover parameters that have
a high impact on R 0 and should be targeted by intervention strategies. The main
objective of this section is to examine the sensitivity of the basic reproduction
number R 0 with respect to model parameters by the so-called sensitivity index.

Definition 1 ([22, 23]) The normalized forward sensitivity index of a variable 𝜈, that
depends differentially on a parameter 𝜌, is defined as

According to Definition 1, we derive the normalized forward sensitivity index of
R 0 with respect to 𝛽, 𝜖, 𝜂 𝑠 , 𝜇 𝑠 , 𝛾𝑏 , 𝛾𝑔 , 𝛾𝑐 , and 𝛼, which is summarized in Table 2.

on R 0 , while R 0 is slightly impacted by the rest of the parameters.

4 Prevision of COVID-19 in Morocco
In this section, we present the forecasts of COVID-19 in Morocco relating with
different preventive measures and strategies implemented by Moroccan authorities
on the confinement period between March 2 and June 20, 2020. Then the parameter
𝑢 can be defined as follows:

We see in Figure 2 the evolution of the number of diagnosed infected positive
individuals with different sets of measures: low, middle, high, and strict interventions.
Up to April 15, the curves corresponding to the first three sets of measures increase
exponentially, while the curve corresponding to the fourth set of measures has lost its
initial exponential character and tends to flatten over time. In addition, the last daily
reported cases in Morocco from March 2 to April 17, confirm the biological tendency
of our model. Thus, our model is efficient to describe the spread of COVID-19 in
Morocco. However, we note that some clinical data is a little far from the values of
the model due to certain foci that appeared in some large areas or at the level of
certain industrial areas.
Next, we give the graphical results related to delays parameters to prove their
biological importance.

We observe in Figure 3 a highly impact of delays on the number of diagnosed positive

clinical data.

Now, we indicate the predicted relative impact of the model and especially the
diagnosed infective individuals with and without interventions applied progressively

Before finding the first positive infected case in Morocco, the authorities have
begun with a suspension of international air lines to and from China, and installed
health control check-points at the borders but without any interventions into the
Moroccan population. For this, we simulate model (1) in the case 𝑢 = 0, which is
illustrated by Figures 4 and 5.

Fig. 4: Time variation of the diagnosed infective individuals without any intervention
on the Moroccan population with different values of 𝛽 (95%𝐶 𝐼, 0.4484 − 0.455).

We remark from Figure 4 that the estimated epidemic peak is 𝑡 ∗ = 142
(95%𝐶 𝐼, 141 − 143), that is, starting from March 2, 2020 (𝑡 = 0), the estimated
epidemic peak is July 21, 2020 (𝑡 = 142).

In the absence of any government intervention, the disease persists strongly and
almost all of the vulnerable population will be reached by the infection (Figure 5).
After the first imported positive infected case, Moroccan authorities began to
establish some preventive interventions between the 2 and the 10th of March, namely
isolation of positive cases, contact tracing, hygiene measures, prevention measures in
workplaces, and ban of mass gathering events. For this reason, we have selected in this
period 𝑢 = 0.2. From March 10 up to March 20, 2020, additional preventive measures
were established: gradual suspension of all international sea, ground, and air lines
(including with Spain, Italia, Algeria, France, Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, and
Portugal), closure of coffees, restaurants, cinemas, theaters, party rooms, clubs, sport
centers, hammams, game rooms and sport fields, closure of mosques, schools and
universities, disinfection of public transportation means, reduction of the carrying
capacity of taxis, buses and tramways, movement/travel restrictions, and containment

measures of the general population. These measures correspond to the choice of the
control 𝑢 = 0.3. From March 20 up to April 6, the Moroccan authority declared a state
of emergency with a complete lockdown, night-time curfew, movement restrictions
24/24, ban of human movements between cities, suspension of railway lines, streets
disinfection, and extensive cleaning and disinfection of port and airport facilities.
For this, we assume that 𝑢 = 0.4. From April 6, the authority decided compulsory
wearing of masks in public spaces, which implies a significant positive influence
on the above interventions and an increase of their efficiency level. In this case, we
assume that 𝑢 = 0.8. Tacking into account all these policies, we present the following
Figures 6 and 7.

We remark from Figure 6 that the estimated epidemic peak is 𝑡 ∗ = 57 (95%𝐶 𝐼, 56 −
57), that is, starting from March 2 (𝑡 = 0), the estimated epidemic peak is April 28,
2020 (𝑡 = 57).

From Figure 7, we see that all the measures taken into this second strategy have a
significant impact on the number of new positive diagnosed cases per day. Compared
to Figure 5, the time required to reach the peak is reduced by 85 days, avoiding
globally an interesting number of new infections and new deaths. Furthermore, the
computed basic reproduction number R 0 is less than 1, which means the extinction
of the disease if the measures cited above are strictly implemented.

4.2 Intervention effectiveness
Here, on one hand, we compare the impact of different degrees of effectiveness on
the evolution of the number of positive infected diagnosed individuals, symptomatic
individuals, and deaths (see Figures 8 and 9). In addition, we present the cumulative
cases in Figure 10 and we summarize it in Table 4. We remark that the effectiveness
of the policies plays an important role to reduce, or not, the human damage and

ensure the eradication of the illness. However, mitigation measures must be strictly
respected to maintain a good level of control over the spread of the virus.

On the other hand, we are carrying out a statistical study on a national scale and
we note that the trend at the beginning was exponential and will undergo a break due
to the multiple interventions of the government, which is globally a good sign (see
Figure 11), whereas it is needful to pay attention at the evolution of the curves in the
different regions in Morocco. Since the clinical data of COVID-19 was not available
on a daily basis at the start of the spread of the epidemic in Morocco, we proceeded
with a choice of unit of three days. We also remark that almost all the regions have a
homogeneous tendency with the national one, except Tangier–Tetouan–Al Hoceima
(TTA), Oriental, Marrakech–Safi (MS), and Casablanca–Settat (CS), which show a
mitigation of the epidemic that does not seem very stable (see Figures 12 and 13).

5 Discussion
Our work followed several steps. First of all, we have formulated an adequate mathematical model to describe the evolution of the COVID-19 disease epidemic in
Morocco. This model allows us to have an idea on the number of resuscitation beds
to prepare for severe forms and intensive care units for critical forms. Second, we have
estimated the corresponding parameters based on the daily Moroccan data. Furthermore, we have applied the least-square-method to determine the confidence interval
of the transmission rate 𝛽, which is given by (95%𝐶 𝐼, 0.4484 − 0.455). Third, we
have computed the basic reproduction number R 0 with the next-generation-matrix
method, for which we have studied the sensitivity analysis in order to examine the
robustness of the model. We have observed that the transmission rate 𝛽 and the
proportion of individuals with symptoms 𝜖 are the most sensitive parameters and
have a high impact on R 0 . By performing some numerical simulations, we have
represented the effect of measures taken by the government, step by step, with the
control 𝑢. In the first period, the appropriate basic reproduction number for 𝑢 = 0.2
is R 0 = 2.9108. In the second period, R 0 = 2.5469 for 𝑢 = 0.3. Thirdly, R 0 = 2.1831
for 𝑢 = 0.4. In the last period, R 0 = 0.7277 for 𝑢 = 0.8. Based on all strategies taken
by the Moroccan authorities, we affirm that the best one is to increase considerably
the level of the lockdown accompanied by the general use of the face masks. In this
case, the estimated endemic peak will take place around April 28. Finally, through
an analysis of regional data, we have shown that the evolution of the pandemic is
consistent with the general epidemiological tendency at the national level.

We finish by mentioning that the used historic data and the different preventive
measures and strategies implemented by Moroccan authorities and considered in our
study, are related to the confinement period in Morocco, between March 2 and June
20, 2020, whereas the use of historic data and other measures and strategies, linked
to the deconfinement phase, are left to another research work.
