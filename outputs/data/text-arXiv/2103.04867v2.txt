Abstract
Background: Trends in hospitalised case-fatality risk (HFR), risk of intensive care unit (ICU)
admission and lengths of stay for patients hospitalised for COVID-19 in England over the prevaccination era are unknown.
Methods: Data on hospital and ICU admissions with COVID-19 at 31 NHS trusts in England were
collected by Public Health England’s Severe Acute Respiratory Infections surveillance system and
linked to death information. We applied parametric multi-state mixture models, accounting for
censored outcomes and regressing risks and times between events on month of admission,
geography, and baseline characteristics.
Findings: 20,785 adults were admitted with COVID-19 in 2020. Between March and
June/July/August estimated HFR reduced from 31.9% (95% confidence interval 30.3-33.5%) to
10.9% (9.4-12.7%), then rose steadily from 21.6% (18.4-25.5%) in September to 25.7% (23.029.2%) in December, with steeper increases among older patients, those with multi-morbidity and
outside London/South of England. ICU admission risk reduced from 13.9% (12.8-15.2%) in March
to 6.2% (5.3-7.1%) in May, rising to a high of 14.2% (11.1-17.2%) in September.

Median length of stay in non-critical care increased during 2020, from 6.6 to 12.3 days for those
dying, and from 6.1 to 9.3 days for those discharged.
Interpretation: Initial improvements in patient outcomes, corresponding to developments in clinical
practice, were not sustained throughout 2020, with HFR in December approaching the levels seen
at the start of the pandemic, whilst median hospital stays have lengthened. The role of increased
transmission, new variants, case-mix and hospital pressures in increasing COVID-19 severity
requires urgent further investigation.

Introduction
COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital in England experience different possible pathways to a
final outcome of either discharge or death, including admission to critical care (an intensive care
unit (ICU) or high dependency unit (HDU)), a step-down from critical care to an acute ward, and
transfers between hospitals. Knowledge of the risk of each pathway, the times taken (lengths of
stay) to reach final outcomes and, particularly, how these change over time, are crucial to: (i)
evaluate the effect of clinical and public health strategies on reducing disease burden (e.g. by
reconstructing the evolution of the pandemic); and (ii) inform future policies, through medium- and
long-term predictions of hospital demand [1,2]. Preliminary evidence exists for changes in mortality
among critically ill patients with COVID-19 admitted to ICU/HDU in England during the first wave of
the pandemic, with factors including age, sex, ethnicity and comorbidity associated with differing
severity for hospitalised individuals [3–6]. However, little is known about how both risks of
outcomes, and lengths of stay for all hospitalised patients have changed over time, particularly
after the first pandemic wave up to the present vaccination era.
In March 2020, Public Health England (PHE) swiftly reconfigured existing influenza hospital
surveillance to collect detailed individual-level data on COVID-19 patients, through the Severe
Acute Respiratory Infections in England (SARI-Watch) surveillance system [7]. These data, which
include all dates of movement between levels of care and outcomes and patient characteristics,
allow estimation of the progression of COVID-19 patients through each hospital pathway. In this
study we focus on how risks of each event and lengths of stay have varied over the months of the
pandemic. In particular, we estimate changes in the hospital-fatality risk (HFR), averaged over the
different pathways through hospital. Using parametric mixture multi-state models, we correctly
account for both the competing risks of each pathway and missing outcome information
(censoring) [8–10].

Methods
Study design and setting
Public Health England’s (PHE’s) Severe Acute Respiratory Infections in England (SARI-Watch)
surveillance system, previously known as the COVID-19 Hospitalisations in England Surveillance
System (CHESS), is a mandatory reporting system for all ICU/HDU admissions with COVID-19 at
National Health Service (NHS) trusts in England [7]. A subset of ‘sentinel’ NHS trusts report
information on the wider range of all hospital admissions.
Participants

4

All adults aged 15+ admitted to 31 SARI-Watch sentinel NHS trusts between 15th March and 31st
December 2020 with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nosocomial cases of COVID-19
were excluded. Follow-up to death (COVID-19 associated or other cause) was extended until 11th
January 2021, via linkage.
Variables
Variables collected in SARI-Watch include dates of hospital and critical care admission, date and
type of outcome and baseline characteristics, specifically: age group, sex, region of residence
(London, South, Midlands and East, and North of England), self-reported ethnicity and number of
comorbidities. Due to small sample sizes, covariates were grouped where appropriate. Month
groupings were: March, April, May, June/July/August, September, October, November and
December; age groups were: 15-44, 45-64, 65-74, and 75+; region groupings were: London/South
of England, Midlands and East of England, and North of England; ethnicity groupings were: Asian,
Black, Mixed/Other and White; and comorbidity burden was grouped as: 0, 1, 2, and 3+
comorbidities. Comorbidity included pre-existing serious medical conditions such as: coronary
heart disease, BMI≥30, diabetes, immunosuppression due to treatment or disease, renal disease,
liver disease, neurological disorders, respiratory disease (excluding asthma), and asthma requiring
medication.
Data sources and outcomes
SARI-Watch data are submitted to PHE via a secure online reporting tool, with data reporters able
to update records with subsequent patient outcome information. Linkage to PHE’s data on deaths
among people with COVID-19 [11] was undertaken to obtain complete information on date and
cause of COVID-19-related death. Self-declared ethnicity was obtained through linkage to the NHS
Hospital Episodes Statistics database (HES) [12]. Linkage was undertaken for data up to 11th
January 2021. Further details concerning these linkages are provided in the Appendix.
Bias
We obtained complete information on mortality and our statistical methodology was specifically
designed to account for censored outcomes. The 31 sentinel trusts were verified to have consistent
reporting of both critical and non-critical care patients over time and compared against aggregate
admissions data for COVID-19 (see Appendix for list of trusts). Sentinel NHS trusts were originally
recruited by PHE using regional and trust representation sampling, during the COVID-19 pandemic
trusts chose whether to continue sentinel reporting leading to certain regions being overrepresented, this may have introduced bias for which we could not account.
Statistical methods

5

We used a multi-state competing risks mixture model with four states: non-critical care, critical care
(ICU), discharge and death, and two sub-models: events following hospital admission and events
following critical care (ICU) admission. The design of this multi-state model is shown in Figure 1
and details of the model and model parameters are provided in the Appendix. Briefly, the model
defines the probability that each competing event will occur next, and the distribution of the time to
each event if that event occurs [13]. The probabilities of competing events were related to
covariates through multinomial logistic regression, and the times to events were related to
covariates through accelerated failure time models. The covariates considered included month of
admission, age group, gender, ethnicity, region and number of comorbidities, as detailed in the
Appendix. Time-to-event distributions and covariates on model parameters were chosen through
critical assessment of goodness of fit (by comparison to non-parametric Aalen-Johansen
cumulative incidence curves) and Akaike’s information criterion (AIC).
The two sub-models shown in Figure 1 are a simplification of the patient pathway, to account for
poorly completed information on unit type and critical care discharge dates. Critical care (ICU and
HDU) admissions were combined into a single “ICU” state and additional hospital stays following
ICU discharge were combined with the ICU state. Date of hospital admission, date of ICU
admission for those admitted to ICU, and date and type of final outcome (discharge or death) were
well completed.
Censoring
Overall, 13.7% of hospital admissions (2,843/20,785) and 17.7% of critical care admissions
(392/2,213) had unknown final outcomes. These outcomes may be missing either because they
were not reported despite having occurred (which we term “truly” missing), or because they had
not occurred by the end of the period covered by the data (termed “right-censoring”). For earlier
months, missing outcomes are more likely to be truly missing, whereas in the most recent months,
a greater proportion of missing outcomes are likely to represent patients who remain in hospital
care.
Among those with unknown outcome, a last known status was reported as either: ‘still in
hospital/still in ICU’ at the date of data extraction, transferred on a particular date, or unknown.
Patients ‘still in hospital/still in ICU’ were censored at the date of data extraction, or at 60 days if
they were reported as still in non-critical care beyond 60 days, or at 90 days if they were reported
as still in critical care beyond 90 days (Figure 2). This approach was a compromise between
excluding these records from the analysis and censoring at the date of data extraction, which
would allow for unrealistically long hospital stays of several months after admission. The 60/90-day
windows included 99% of observed final outcomes, and 90-day in-hospital outcomes are also used
in other studies of critical care [3]. Transferred patients with unknown outcome were censored at

6

the date of transfer, patients with unknown status and unknown outcome were censored at the
date of their last observed event.
Model implementation
Models were implemented using the flexsurv (version 2.0) package [14] in R (version 4.0.3) [15].
HFR, averaged over admissions with and without ICU, was estimated by combining the two submodels. We report 95% confidence intervals representing uncertainty in estimates, and for lengths
of stay we additionally report interquartile ranges representing heterogeneity within the population.
Tables of estimated quantities, odds ratios and expected time ratios are provided in the Appendix.

Results
Participant characteristics
A total of 20,785 patients were admitted to a sentinel NHS trust between 15th March and 31st
December 2020. The flowchart in Figure 2 shows the various pathways taken by patients and the
aggregated number of observed transitions between each state.
Table 1 presents baseline characteristics by month of admission. Among those admitted to a
sentinel NHS trust in March, 60% (2,037/3,391) were male, this proportion decreased to 50%
(1,117/2,197) in May and remained between 50-55% for subsequent months. The age distribution
of patients admitted to hospital fluctuated from month to month, with around 60% aged over 65 and
40% aged under 65. Meanwhile, the proportion of individuals of White ethnicity increased, from
63% (2,148/3,391) in March to 80% (1,768/2,200) in December, with a corresponding reduction in
the proportion of patients of Asian, Black and Mixed/Other ethnicity. Patients admitted towards the
end of the study period had fewer comorbidities; 44% (1,507/3,391) of patients admitted in March
had three or more comorbidities, compared to 33% (721/2,200) of those admitted in December.
The proportion with zero comorbidities rose from 18% (594/3,391) in March to 28% (623/2,200) in
December. Differing regional trends were observed in hospital admissions; during March and April
over half of admissions (60% and 54%, respectively) occurred in London and the South of
England, whereas in September and October most hospital admissions (60% and 59%,
respectively) occurred in the North of England.
Critical care admissions
Figure 3 shows the proportion of hospital admissions admitted to ICU over time by age and sex.
Trends for non-critical care admissions were similar across all age groups and both sexes. A
greater proportion of men compared to women and middle-aged (aged 45-75) patients compared
to younger (aged 15-45) and older (aged 75+) patients were admitted to critical care.

7

Outcome probabilities
Estimated outcome probabilities following hospital admission are shown in Figure 4.
Probability of ICU admission following hospital admission dramatically decreased between March
and May, from 13.9% (95% confidence interval 12.8-15.2%) to 6.2% (5.3-7.1%); subsequently
rising to a peak of 14.2% (11.1-17.2%) in September, followed by a steady fall to 9.6% (8.6-10.9%)
in December. These trends were similar across all subgroups.
Probability of death outside of critical care declined from 25.3% (23.8-26.8%) in March to 9.4%
(7.9-11.1%) in June/July/August (OR 0.8, 0.6-1.1), followed by a resurgence to 23.1% (20.4-26%)
in December (OR 1.3, 1.1-1.6). Over the study period, patients aged 65-74 and 75+ had
significantly greater odds of death outside of critical care compared to patients aged 15-45 (OR
8.2, 3-8-18 and OR 71.1, 32.7-154.4, respectively). Patients with multiple comorbidities were
similarly at greater risk of death outside of critical care (OR 2.3, 1.5-3.5 for 2 comorbidities and OR
5.2, 3.6-7.5 for 3+ comorbidities) compared to those with no comorbidities (Supplementary table
8).
Figure 5 shows estimated probability of death among patients admitted to critical care. This fell
from 47.4% (42.5-51.7%) in March to 24.1% (16.1-35.1%) in June/July/August, increased to 40.2%
(34.1-46.6%) in October and fell again to 26.8% (20.2-34.2%) in December. Whilst confidence
intervals are wide in smaller groups, this oscillating trend was estimated across most subgroups.
Hospitalised case-fatality risk
Estimated hospitalised case-fatality risk (HFR), averaged across ICU and non-ICU admissions, is
shown in Figure 6. Between March and June/July/August HFR reduced from 31.9% (30.3-33.5%)
to 10.9% (9.4-12.7%); this was followed by an increase to 21.6% (18.4-25.5%) in September and
steady rise to 25.7% (23.0-29.2%) for patients admitted in December. Whilst the initial fall in HFR
was estimated across all subgroups, the increase to December was estimated particularly in the
oldest age group (75+) and those with three or more comorbidities, with estimated HFRs of 42.6%
(38.3-46.8%) and 34.5% (29.9-38.9%) for admissions in the final month of 2020, respectively.
In December, HFR was estimated to be higher in the North of England, at 28.6% (23.3-34.8%),
and Midlands and East of England, at 27% (22.9-31.6%), compared to London and the South of
England at 19.3% (16.1-23.3%). HFR for people of White ethnicity was higher during December, at
27.4% (24.3-30.8%), compared to 13% (9-19.3%) and 7.3% (3.3-18.6%) for people of Asian and
Mixed/Other ethnicity, respectively. Whilst HFR for people of Black ethnicity was estimated to be
lower than those of White ethnicity during March to June/July/August, confidence intervals were
wider in December and overlapped the HFR for White ethnicity.
Length of stay

8

Estimated median times from hospital admission to next event are shown in Figure 7. Time to ICU
admission remained low throughout the period, with a median of between 0.8 and 1.3 days after
hospital admission (Figure 7A). Median length of stay in hospital prior to death in non-critical care
increased from 6.6 days (6.2-7.1 days) in March to 12.3 days (10.9-14.0 days) in December, with a
similar trend across all subgroups. Median lengths of stay in non-critical care prior to discharge
initially fell from 6.1 days (5.7-6.5 days) for admissions during March to 4.1 days (3.8-4.5 days) in
June/July/August, before lengthening to 9.3 days (8.5-10.3 days) in December. Heterogeneity
between lengths of stay prior to discharge or death increased over time, with wider inter-quartile
ranges estimated in more recent months.
Estimated length of stay in non-critical care prior to discharge was longest among older patients,
with a median of 17.8 days (16.2-19.7 days) for patients aged 75+ (expected time ratio, ETR
compared to 15-45: 3.7, 3.5-4) admitted in December (Figure 7C). Length of stay in non-critical
care prior to discharge was also longer in the North (ETR compared to London/South 1.7, 1.6-1.9)
compared to elsewhere in England; 13.8 days (12.3-15.6 days) in the North of England in
December compared to 7.9 days (7.2-8.9 days) in London and the South of England and 9.9 days
(9.0-11.1 days) in the Midlands and East of England (Figure 7D).
Figure 8 shows lengths of stay in ICU; as compared to non-critical care patients (Figure 7) patients
admitted to critical care spent longer in hospital. Median length of stay in ICU prior to discharge
initially reduced from 24.4 days (21.1-28.5 days) in March to 13.8 days (10.2-18.5 days) in
June/July/August (ETR 0.6, 0.4-0.8), then increased to 38 days (29-48.9 days) in December (ETR
1.6, 1.2-2.1). Median length of stay in ICU prior to death showed less variability over time, ranging
between 8.6 and 12.5 days.

Discussion
Principal findings
Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in England, risks of severe events and lengths of stay in
hospital have varied by month of admission and according to baseline characteristics. The
hospitalised case-fatality risk fell during the first ‘wave’ of the pandemic (March to
June/July/August), although a resurgence was estimated across all subgroups up to December
2020, particularly among older patients, those presenting with multiple comorbidities, those of
White ethnicity (unadjusted for age), and regions outside London and the South of England.
Meanwhile, lengths of stay in hospital for patients admitted with COVID-19 have tended to increase
since the start of the pandemic.
Temporal variations in patient outcomes and lengths of stay are likely to be influenced by a range
of factors, including changes in patient characteristics and in clinical practice. Despite accounting

9

for changes in patient characteristics over time, these covariates did not fully explain the decline
and subsequent increase in severity for hospitalised COVID-19 patients, with trends persisting.
Comparison with other studies
Our estimates for critical care patients support the findings of the Intensive Care National Audit &
Research Centre which reported a reduction in critical care mortality between March and June
2020, followed by an increase in mortality during the autumn and subsequent slow decline [3].
Considering all hospitalised patients, the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging
Infections Consortium (ISARIC) estimated a reduction in in-hospital mortality among 208 hospitals
in England, Scotland, and Wales, from 30-35% in March and early April to 10-15% in late July and
August [6]. Meanwhile estimates of in-hospital mortality from the HES dataset, adjusted for age,
sex, comorbidity, deprivation and date, showed a decline between early March and late May from
52.2% to 16.8% [16].
Our study, whilst limited to a selected group of hospitals, provides further evidence of this decline
in hospitalised mortality during the first wave of COVID-19 in England. By accounting for competing
risks, we additionally estimated trends in risks of ICU admission and hospital discharge, as well as
lengths of stay for both critical and non-critical care patients. A key strength of our work is the
longer follow-up period, which allowed for previously unexplored trends throughout 2020, in
particular in autumn and winter, to be estimated.
Compared to the ISARIC study, we estimated a lower risk of ICU admission during March and April
(17% vs 10 to 14%) [6]. Hospitals in London were the first to experience high numbers of critical
care admissions during the first wave, so the fact that London sites were under-represented in the
list of reporters to our study likely contributed to the reduced overall severity of infection in our
estimates during these months compared to this study.
Several studies have shown association between increased severity due to COVID-19 and
baseline covariates [3,5,6,16]. In common with these studies, we estimated increased risk of
mortality for older patients and those with multiple comorbidities. These studies have also linked
increased deprivation, and Asian, Black or Mixed/Other ethnicity compared to White ethnicity to
increased severity. Full postcode information was unavailable and we were therefore unable to
account for deprivation in our study. We estimated lower HFR for people of Asian, Black or
Mixed/Other ethnicities compared to White ethnicity, this may be due to a differing age profile for
these populations. Supplementary Figure 3 presents HFR by three covariates: month of admission,
age group and ethnicity, showing that after controlling for age, HFR was similar for people of Asian,
Black and White ethnicities, although with wider confidence intervals in groups of smaller size.
Strengths and limitations of the study

10

By linking with PHE’s mortality data we were able to identify all deaths due to COVID-19 occurring
in the population, improving the completeness of the death information and thereby reducing
uncertainty in our mortality estimates.
Another strength of this work is the statistical software we applied to surveillance data, allowing for
robust estimates of outcome probability and lengths of stay to be obtained. Whilst we did not
explicitly model seasonality, instead using a categorical month covariate, cyclic regression models
or other smoothed functions of time could be used in future work to investigate seasonal variation
in COVID-19 mortality rates.
Vaccination for COVID-19 in England began in mid-December 2020, with around 1.2 million people
receiving their first dose by the end of December [17]. Our estimates cover the entire prevaccination period and therefore provide a comprehensive assessment of hospital severity before
the effects of vaccination could be felt.
A limitation of the sentinel reporting was smaller group sizes compared to other studies [4,16], this
led to increased uncertainty in our estimates, particularly among BAME patient groups, and limited
analyses to only two covariates for the most part (month of admission plus one demographic
factor). This limited the extent to which interactions between covariates could be explored,
although it is likely that a high degree of correlation exists between certain covariates.
Conclusions and policy implications
Improved patient management, along with containment of COVID-19, is likely to have contributed
to the estimated reduction in mortality during the first wave of infection in England [18]. From
March onwards, hospital wards were re-configured to prepare for a rapidly increasing number of
severe cases [19], nevertheless, several London-based hospitals entered ‘surge’, with availability
of staff and ventilator units limiting the number of critical care beds [20]. At this time, there may
have been prioritisation of ICU treatments to those most likely to benefit from invasive treatments,
which may be reflected in our estimated improvements in patient outcomes. Concurrent national
lockdown restrictions were effective in limiting transmission of COVID-19 in the community, slowing
the influx of new patients from April onwards [21]. Use of treatments, such as Dexamethasone, and
therapies such as prone positioning also improved outcomes for patients in non-critical care wards
[22,23].
The estimated increase in mortality after the summer months may reflect a combination of multiple
factors: increased transmission after easing of national restrictions; regional outbreaks [24];
changes in case-mix with a greater proportion of older, clinically vulnerable individuals observed
being admitted to hospital [25]; seasonality; the emergence of new variants of concern (still a
matter of debate and research [26]); and overloading of hospitals in hotspots and nationwide

11

towards the end of the year [27]. Changes in critical care bed occupancy were worryingly
correlated with estimated changes in mortality (Supplementary Figure 4), for example, although
this crude comparison may hide a multitude of interlinked factors.
The concerning trends in hospitalised case-fatality risk and the relationship between increased
transmission, appearance of new variants, hospital pressure, and mortality merits further urgent
investigation. Changes in outcomes of patients admitted to hospital should continue to be closely
monitored. Our results provide an invaluable baseline for future evaluation of the effect of
vaccination on mortality and have been shared with the UK Government’s Scientific Pandemic
Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M) and Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE)
[28,29].

Appendix
Model description
We used a parametric semi-Markov multi-state model with four states. The model comprises two
sub-models which represent competing risks of the next event ‘from Hospital admission’ and ‘from
ICU admission’ (Figure 1).
In each of the sub-models an individual 𝑖 in state 𝑟 makes a transition to a state 𝑠 with probability
𝜋𝑟,𝑠 . Denote 𝑆𝑟,𝑠 the distribution of time from entering state 𝑟 to moving to state 𝑠, given that this
transition occurs (i.e. the conditional length of stay). A variety of parametric distributions are
considered for this time.
This is a semi-Markov model, as the rates of transition to subsequent states depend on how long a
person has spent in the current state, but not on any events before entering the current state.
Censoring of data
Transitions experienced by individual 𝑖 are observed in the data as one of three types 𝛿𝑖,𝑗 :
1. exact transition time: {𝑦𝑖,𝑗 , 𝑟𝑖,𝑗 , 𝑠𝑖,𝑗 , 𝛿𝑖,𝑗 = 1} transition from state 𝑟𝑖,𝑗 to state 𝑠𝑖,𝑗 occurs at time
𝑦𝑖,𝑗
2. right censoring: {𝑦𝑖,𝑗 , 𝑟𝑖,𝑗 , 𝑠𝑖,𝑗 , 𝛿𝑖,𝑗 = 2} follow-up ends while individual is in state 𝑟𝑖,𝑗 at time
𝑦𝑖,𝑗 , the next state and time of transition are unknown
3. partially-known outcome: {𝑦𝑖,𝑗 , 𝑟𝑖,𝑗 , 𝑠𝑖,𝑗 , 𝛿𝑖,𝑗 = 3} it is known whether an individual went to
ICU, but unknown if they are still in hospital at time 𝑦𝑖,𝑗
Likelihood
Let 𝑓𝑟,𝑠 ( |𝜃𝑟,𝑠 ) be the density of the parametric distribution for the time of transition from state 𝑟 to
state 𝑠, conditional on this being the transition that occurs. Then the likelihood contributions are:
𝛿𝑖,𝑗 = 1:

𝑙𝑖,𝑗 = 𝜋𝑟𝑖,𝑗 𝑠𝑖,𝑗 𝑓𝑟𝑖,𝑗𝑠𝑖,𝑗 (𝑦𝑖,𝑗 |𝜃𝑟𝑖,𝑗𝑠𝑖,𝑗 )

𝛿𝑖,𝑗 = 2:

𝑙𝑖,𝑗 = ∑ 𝜋𝑟𝑖,𝑗𝑠 (1 − 𝐹𝑟𝑖,𝑗𝑠 (𝑦𝑖,𝑗 |𝜃𝑟𝑖,𝑗𝑠 ))

𝛿𝑖,𝑗 = 3, 𝑠 ≠ Discharge:
𝛿𝑖,𝑗 = 3, 𝑠 = Discharge:

𝑠∈𝑆𝑟

as for 𝛿𝑖,𝑗 = 2
𝑙𝑖,𝑗 = 𝜋𝑟𝑖,𝑗 𝑠

Covariates
The flexsurv package in R is used to maximise this likelihood for the SARI-Watch dataset.
Multinomial logistic regression is used within the flexsurv package to allow the 𝜋𝑟,𝑠 to depend upon
the covariates and their interactions. Covariates are also included on parameters 𝜃𝑟,𝑠 of the

25

parametric distributions 𝑓𝑟,𝑠 . The choice of parameters and covariate effects are shown in
Supplementary Table 1.
The parametric distributions chosen included the Generalized Gamma, Gamma and Log-normal
distributions. The cumulative distribution functions for these distributions are included in [10].
Data linkage
Data linkage to PHE’s mortality data was undertaken using a deterministic linkage on NHS
number. PHE’s mortality data comprised deaths from four sources in order to ensure maximum
completeness (the Office for National Statistics (ONS) death registrations, NHSE deaths in
hospitals, SGSS and local Health Protection Teams). Death outcomes are included in these data if
they occurred within 60 days of a positive COVID-19 test, or COVID-19 was mentioned on the
death certificate.
Data linkage to the NHS Hospital Episodes Statistics database was undertaken using a
deterministic linkage on NHS number.
Goodness of fit
Goodness of fit curves for the parametric model compared to the non-parametric Aalen-Johansen
cumulative incidence estimator are included in the Appendix. The models showed good
agreement, with the parametric model estimating increased probability of discharge compared to
the Aalen-Johansen estimator due to the two methods assuming different censoring mechanisms.
