Abstract
The dynamics of many epidemic models for infectious diseases that spread in a single host population demonstrate a threshold phenomenon.
If the basic reproduction number R0 is below unity, the disease-free equilibrium P0 is globally
stable in the feasible region and the disease always dies out.
If R0 > 1, a unique endemic equilibrium P ∗ is globally asymptotically stable in the interior of
the feasible region and the disease will persist at the endemic equilibrium if it is initially present.
In this paper (Part I), we reinvestigate the study of the stability or the non stability of a mathematical Covid-19 model constructed by Nita H. Shah, Ankush H. Suthar and Ekta N. Jayswal
in https ://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.04.20053173.
We use a criterion of Li-Wang for stability of matrices [Li-Wang] on the second additive compound matrix associated to their model.
In second paper (Part II), In order to control the Covid-19 system, i.e., force the trajectories to
go to the equilibria we will add some control parameters with uncertain parameters to stabilize
the five-dimensional Covid-19 system studied in this paper. Based on compound matrices theory,
we apply in [Intissar] again the criterion of Li-Wang to study the stability of equilibrium points
of Covid-19 system with uncertain parameters. In this part II, all sophisticated technical calculations including those in part I are given in appendices.

§1 Introduction and preliminary results
A mathematical Covid-19 model is constructed in [Shah et al] by Nita H. Shah, Ankush H.
Suthar and Ekta N. Jayswal to study human to human transmission of the Covid-19.
The model consists all possible human to human transmission of the virus.
The Covid-2019 is highly contagious in nature and infected cases are seen in most of the countries around the world, hence in the model the susceptible population class is ignored and whole
population is divided in five compartments :
(1) class of exposed individuals E(t) (individuals surrounded by infection by not yet infected),
(2) class of infected individuals by Covid-19 I(t),
(3) class of critically infected individuals by Covid-19 C(t),
(4) class of hospitalised individuals H(t),
and
(5) class of dead individuals due to Covid-19 D(t).
Human to human transmission dynamics of Covid-19 is describe graphically in

• Table of parameters used in the model is described as follow :
B : Birth rate of class of exposed individuals : 0.80 Calculated
µ Natural death rate : 0.01 Assumed
β1 : Transmission rate of individuals moving from exposed to infected class : 0.55 Calculated
β2 : Rate at which infected individuals goes into sever condition or in critical condition : 0.40
Calculated

Theorem 1.2
(i) The positive orthant R5+ is positively invariant under the flow of (covid-19). Precisely, if
E(0) > 0 ; I(0) > 0 ; C(0) > 0 ; H(0) > 0 ; D(0) > 0 then ∀t > 0 ; E(t) > 0 ; I(t) > 0 C(t) > 0 ;
H(t) > 0 ; D(t) > 0.
Proof
(i) • Let’s suppose I(0) > 0, then from the second equation of (covid-19)), if
χ(t) = (β10 − β1 )E + β2 + β6 + β8 + µ then the integration from 0 to t > 0 gives :
I(t) = I(0)e−

Therefore I(t) > 0; ∀t ≥ 0.
• Consider the following sub-equations related to the variables C and H :

C(0) > 0 and H(0) > 0

The system (1.3) takes the matrix form :

= M U (t) + F (t)

where

called Duhamel formula :

Therefore C(t) > 0; ∀t ≥ 0. and H(t) > 0; ∀t ≥ 0.
We can observe also that M is a Metzler matrix (a matrix A = (aij 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n is a
Metzler matrix if all of its elements are non-negative except for those on the main diagonal, which are unconstrained.) That is, a Metzler matrix is any matrix A which satisfies

i 6= j.

Thus, (1.3) is a monotone system. It follows that, R2+ is invariant under the flow of (1.3).
• Let’s suppose E(0) > 0, then from the first equation of (covid-19)), if
χ(t) = (β1 − β10 )I − β7 D + µ and π(t) = β9 H(t) + B which is > 0.
the integration from 0 to t > 0 gives :

Rt

E(t) = E(0)e− 0 χ(s)ds + e− 0 χ(s)ds
0

Therefore E(t) > 0; ∀t ≥ 0.
• Let’s suppose D(0) > 0, then from the 5th equation of (covid-19)), if
χ(t) = β7 E and π(t) = β6 I(t) + β5 C(t) which is > 0.
the integration from 0 to t > 0 gives :
Z t
Rt

Ru
D(t) = D(0)e− 0 χ(s)ds + e− 0 χ(s)ds

Therefore D(t) > 0; ∀t ≥ 0.

domain.
Consider the following n-dimensional system :
x0 (t) = f (x(t)); t ≥ 0

(1.6)

where f : Ω ⊂ Rn −→ Rn is C 1 -function.
Definition 1.4
• We say that x∗ is an equilibrium point of (1.6) if f (x∗ ) = 0.
• We will say that an equilibrium point x∗ is stable if
∀  > 0, ∃δ > 0 such that || x − x∗ ||< δ and t > 0 =⇒|| φt (x) − x∗ ||< 
where φt (x) is a solution of (1.6)
• We will say that an equilibrium point x∗ is asymptotically stable if for each neighborhood
U of x∗ there exists a neighborhood W such that x∗ ∈ W ⊂ U and x(0) ∈ W implies that the
solution φt (x) satisfies φt (x) ∈ U for all t > 0, and that φt (x) −→ x∗ as t −→ +∞.
In particular, a system is called asymptotically stable around its equilibrium point at the origin
if it satisfies the following two conditions :
1. Given any  > 0; ∃δ1 > 0 such that if || x(0) ||< δ1 , then
|| φt (x) ||< , ∀t > 0.
2. ∃δ1 > 0 such that if || x(0) ||< δ2 , then φt (x) −→ 0 as t −→ ∞.



The first condition requires that the state trajectory can be confined to an arbitrarily small
“ball" centered at the equilibrium point and of radius , when released from an arbitrary initial
condition in a ball of sufficiently small (but positive) radius δ1 . This is called stability in the
sense of Lyapunov (i.s.L.).
It is possible to have stability in the sense of Lyapunov without having asymptotic stability, in
which case we refer to the equilibrium point as marginally stable. Nonlinear systems also exist
that satisfy the second requirement without being stable i.s.L. An equilibrium point that is not
stable i.s.L. is termed unstable.

Covid-19

x(0) = (x1 (0), .., xi (0), .., xn (0)) = x0 is fixed

and
fi : Rn −→ R are C 1 -functions which are given.
and suppose that x∗ = (x∗1 , ..., x∗i , ...., x∗n ) is a steady state, that is, fi (x∗ ) = 0.

The question of interest is whether the steady state is stable or unstable. Consider a small
perturbation from the steady state by letting xi = x∗i + ui , 1 ≤ i ≤ n where both ui , 1 ≤ i are
understood to be small. The question of interest translates into the following : will ui , 1 ≤ i
where both grow (so that xi , 1 ≤ i ≤ n move away from the steady state), or will they decay to
zero (so that xi , , 1 ≤ i ≤ n move towards the steady state) ?

In the former case, we say that the steady state is unstable, in the latter it is stable.To see
whether the perturbation grows or decays, we need to derive differential equations for ui , 1 ≤ i
We do so as follows :
dxi
dui
=
, 1 ≤ i ≤ n (since x∗i is constant 1 ≤ i ≤ n)

= fi (x∗ + u), u = (u1 , ..., ui , ....un ) (substitution)

n

∂fi ∗
(x ) + .... (since fi (x∗ ) = 0)
∂x
j
j=1

The .... denote higher order terms, Since ui ; 1 ≤ i ≤ n are assumed to be small, these higher
order terms are extremely small.

The above linear system for ui ; 1 ≤ i ≤ n has the trivial steady state ui = 0; 1 ≤ i ≤ n, and
the stability of this trivial steady state is determined by the eigenvalues of the matrix, as follows :

If we can safely neglect the higher order terms, we obtain the following linear system of equations governing the evolution of the perturbations ui , 1 ≤ i ≤ n :

Theorem 1.5
if the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix all have real parts less than zero, then the steady state
is stable.
if the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix all have real parts < 0, then the steady state is asymptotically stable.
If at least one of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix has real part greater than zero, then
the steady state is unstable.
Otherwise there is no conclusion (then we have a borderline case between stability and instability ; such cases require an investigation of the higher order terms we neglected, and this
requires more sophisticated mathematical machinery discussed in advanced courses on ordinary
differential equations).

An equilibrium point x∗ is said hyperbolic if all eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix have real

Remark 1.7
A hyperbolic equilibrium point x∗ is asymptotically stable if the eigenvalues of the Jacobian
matrix all have real parts < 0 or otherwise it is unstable.
Let A be the Jacobian matrix, assume that it is a real hyperbolic matrix, i.e. <eλ 6= 0 for for

There is a linear change of variables [good coordinates (xs , xu )] that induces a splitting into

We have written xs = Ps x, xu = Pu x where Ps : Rn −→ Es and Pu : Rn −→ Eu are the orthogonal projections.
Last but not least, there is a theorem (the Hartman- Grobman Theorem) that guarantees that
the stability of the steady state x∗ of the original system is the same as the stability of the
trivial steady state 0 of the linearized system.
Let x∗ be an equilibrium point of nonlinear system (1.6) then by applying a translation, we
can always assume 0 is a equilibrium point of (1.6).
• Poincaré in his dissertation showed that if f is analytic at the equilibrium point x∗ , and the
eigenvalues of Jx∗ are nonresonant, then there is a formal power series of change of variable to
change (1.6) to a linear system [Poincaré] and [Arnold].
• Hartman and Grobman showed that if f is continuously differentiable, then there is a neighborhood of a hyperbolic equilibrium point and a homeomorphism on this neighborhood, such that
the system in this neighborhood is changed to a linear system under such a homeomorphism
[Grobman], [Hartman1], [Hartman 2] , [Perko,] and [X-Wang].
Theorem 1.8 (Hartman-Grobman theorem)
Let Ω be an open set of Rn containing the origin, f : Ω −→ Rn be a C 1 - function on Ω, 0 be a
hyperbolic equilibrium point of the system (1.6), and Ur = {x; || x ||< r} be the neighborhood
of the origin of radius r. For any r,  > 0 such that Ur+ ⊂ Ω, there exists a transformation
y = H(x), H(0) = 0 and H is a homeomorphism in a neighborhood of 0, such that the system
(1.6) is changed into the linear system

Proof
see http://www.math.utah.edu/∼treiberg/M6414HartmanGrobman.pdf.
Thus, the procedure to determine stability of x∗ is as follows :
1. Compute all partial derivatives of the right-hand-side of the original system of differential
equations, and construct the Jacobian matrix.

2. Evaluate the Jacobian matrix at the steady state.
3. Compute eigenvalues.
4. Conclude stability or instability based on the real parts of the eigenvalues.
Definition 1.9 (Liapunov function)
Let x∗ be an equilibrium point of (1.6), U ⊂ Ω be a neighborhood of x∗ and L : U −→ R be a
continuous function. We say that L is Liapunov function for (1.6) at x∗ if
(1) L(x∗ ) = 0 and for every x 6= x∗ we have L(x) > 0 ;
(2) The function t −→ L(φt (x)) is decreasing.
We say that L is strictly Liapunov function for (1.6) at x∗ if L satisfy (1) and
(3) the function t −→ L(φt (x)) is strictly decreasing.
Remark 1.10
If L is C 1 function then we can replace :
- The condition (2) by ∀ x ∈ U, < ∇L(x), f (x) >≤ 0.
and
- The condition (3) by ∀ x ∈ U, < ∇L(x), f (x) >< 0.
Theorem 1.11
If (1.6) admits a Liapunov function at an equilibrium point x∗ , then x∗ is stable and if the
Liapunov function is strictly decreasing then x∗ is asymptotically stable.

We outline in the next section the Li-Wang’s stability criterion [Li-Wang] for real matrices
and we recall of some spectral properties of M-matrices. In section 3 we give some preliminary
definitions and some lemmas for linear stability of (covid-19) system. In section 4, we present
a study of stability of equilibrium points of (covid-19) system by using the R0 criterion and
Li-Wang criterion on second additive compound matrix associated to Jacobian matrix of system
(covid-19).
§ 2 On Li-Wang’s stability criterion of real matrix.
Definition 2.1
Let A be an n × n matrix and let σ(A) be its spectrum. The stability modulus of A is defined by
s(A) = M ax{Reλ; λ ∈ σ(A)} i.e. s(A) is the maximum real part of the eigenvalues of A called
also the spectral abscissa.
A is said to be stable if s(A) < 0.

The stability of a matrix is related to the Routh-Hurwitz problem on the number of zeros of
a polynomial that have negative real parts. Routh-Hurwitz discovered necessary and sufficient
conditions for all of the zeros to have negative real parts, which are known today as the RouthHurwitz conditions. A good and concise account of the Routh-Hurwitz problem can be found
in [Banks et al].
The Li-Wang criterion offer an alternative to the well-known Routh-Hurwitz. It based on
Lozinskiǐ measures and seconde additive compound matrix. For detailed discussions on compound matrices, the reader is referred to [Li-Wang] and for additive compound matrices to
[Fiedle].
• In [Li-Wang] a necessary and sufficient condition for the stability of an n × n matrix with real
entries is derived (Li-Wang criterion) by using a simple spectral property of additive compound
matrices.
• A survey is given of a connection between compound matrices and ordinary differential equations by James S ; Muldowney in [Muldowney]
And for an application of Li-Wang criterion, we can consult [Diekmann et al] , [Intissar et al]
and [Khanh].

It follows from the definition of etA that e−t||A|| ≤|| etA ||≤ et||A|| , 0 ≤ t < +∞ but − || A || and

Proof
(i) For the proof, see [[Daletskii-Krein], Chap. I, Theorem 4.1]..
We see from the last equality in (2.5) that α is the spectral abscissa of the matrix A : α = s(A).
Let us stress that the spectral abscissa is independent of the choice of the norm.
(ii) We see from the last equality in (2.6) that β is the logarithmic norm of the matrix A :
β =|| A ||log .
Consider the logarithmic function on the positive semi-axis. In view of its continuous differentiability, it locally satisfies the Lipschitz condition. Therefore, for any  > 0, we can indicate a
δ = δ > 0such that
|lnu − lnv| ≤ (1 + )|u − v| for |u − 1| < δ, |v − 1| < δ.
Therefore, under the conditions ||| etA || −1 |< δ and ||| I + tA || −1 |< δ, , we have
| ln || exp(tA) || −ln || I + tA ||≤ (1 + ) ||| etA || − || I + tA |||

(2.9)

In (2.9), the quantity on the left exists, is finite and is equal to β ; as proved above, the limit

the inequality β ≥ b.

Suppose for the time being that the written inequality is strict : β > b. For a sufficiently small
 > 0, we can write β −  ≥ b +  . From the obtained  > 0, we then find a δ = δ such that
|| etA ||≤|| et(b+) || for 0 < t ≤ δ.

Thus,
|| etA ||≤ et(β−) for 0 < t < +∞,
and this explicitly contradicts the definition of the number β.
This Theorem implies the important inequality :
α =s(A) ≤ || A ||log = β.
For every A, B ∈ Mn (C), α ≥ 0 , and ξ ∈ C the following relations hold :
•1

µ(αA + ξI) = αµ(A) + <eξ.

The most important property of the compound mapping is that it is multiplicative.
Lemma 2.6. ([Marshall et al], Theorem 19.F.2)
Let A and B be n × n matrices and let 1 ≤ k ≤ n, then Ck (AB) = Ck (A)Ck (B).



This property is equivalent to the Binet-Cauchy theorem :
Theorem 2.7 (Binet-Cauchy Theorem)
Let A be a n × m complex matrix, B be a m × l complex matrix and p ≤ min{n, m, l} then
Cp (AB) = Cp (A)Cp (B).

Some other principal properties of compound matrices are given in [[Aitken], [Marcus] , [Mitrouli et al], [Kravvaritis et al]] for A ∈ Mn (C) and p an integer, 1 ≤ p ≤ n :
in particular, let A ∈ Mn (C) and k ≤ n then we have :
•1 if A is unitary, then Ck (A) is unitary.
•2 if A is diagonal, then Ck (A) is digonal.
•3 if A is upper (lower) triangular , then Ck (A) is uppe (lower) triangular.
•4 Ck (AT ) = Ck (A)T .
•5 det(A + I) = 1 + det(A) +

•7 if {λi , i = 1....., n} are eigenvalues of A then the eigenvalues of Ck (A) are of the following
form :
{λi1 ....λik , 1 ≤ i1 < ..... < ik . ≤ n}.
The main use of compound matrices are their spectral properties which follow from the previous
lemma together with the Jordan Canonical Form.
The compounds of companion matrices can be used to study products of roots of polynomials. An excellent example of this can be seen in [Hong et al] where there is an extensive
description of the compounds of companion matrices as well as some applications.

• Positive Definite Matrix
Definition 2.15
An n × n complex matrix A is called positive definite if
<e[x∗ Ax] > 0

(2.4)

for all nonzero complex vectors x ∈ Cn , where x∗ denotes the conjugate transpose of the vector
x.
In the case of a real matrix A, equation (2.4) reduces to
<e[xT Ax] > 0

(2.5)

where xT denotes the transpose.



• Positive definite matrices are of both theoretical and computational importance in a wide
variety of applications. They are used, for example, in optimization algorithms and in the
construction of various linear regression models (Johnson 1970).
A positive definite matrix has at least one matrix square root. Furthermore, exactly one of its
matrix square roots is itself positive definite.
A necessary and sufficient condition for a complex matrix A to be positive definite is that the
Hermitian part
AH =

1
(A + AH )
2

(2.6)

where AH denotes the conjugate transpose, be positive definite.
This means that a real matrix A is positive definite iff the symmetric part
AS =

1
(A + AT )
2

(2.7)

where AT is the transpose, is positive definite (Johnson 1970).

21

• Confusingly, the discussion of positive definite matrices is often restricted to only Hermitian
matrices, or symmetric matrices .
in the case of real matrices (Pease 1965 [ Pease], Johnson 1970 [Johnson], Marcus and Minc
1988, p. 182 [Marcus et al 1] ; Marcus and Minc 1992, p. 69[Marcus et al 2] ; Golub and
Van Loan 1996, p. 140 [ Golub et al]).
A Hermitian (or symmetric) matrix is positive definite iff all its eigenvalues are positive. Therefore, a general complex (respectively, real) matrix is positive definite iff its Hermitian (or
symmetric) part has all positive eigenvalues.
The determinant of a positive definite matrix is always positive, so a positive definite matrix is
always nonsingular.

(ii) There exists a diagonal matrix D with elements > 0 such that DA is definite positive matrix.

Proof
(i) =⇒ (ii)
Let e be the vector having all its components equal to 1. We define x and y by Ax = e and
A∗ y = e. Then we have xi > 0 and yi > 0 for all i.

Consequently B and B ∗ are strictly dominant diagonal matrices. Then B + B ∗ is also a strictly

there exists α > 0 such that < Bu, u >≥ α || u ||2 .

• The Schur stability criteria of matrices using the additive compound matrix

A matrix A is said to be Schur stable if ρ(A) < 1, where ρ(A) = max{| λ |; λ ∈ σ(A)} (the

• Basic reproduction number
Mathematical modeling can play an important role in helping to quantify possible disease control
strategies by focusing on the important aspects of a disease, determining threshold quantities
for disease survival, and evaluating the effect of particular control strategies.
A very important threshold quantity is the basic reproduction number, sometimes called the
basic reproductive number or basic reproductive ratio (Heffernan, Smith, & Wahl, 2005) [Heffernan et al], which is usually denoted by R0 .
The epidemiological definition of R0 is the average number of secondary cases produced by one
infected individual introduced into a population of susceptible individuals, where an infected
individual has acquired the disease, and susceptible individuals are healthy but can acquire the
disease.
In reality, the value of R0 for a specific disease depends on many variables, such as location
and density of population.
The study of the stability of jacobian matrices of order less than three of a dynamic system
yields a reasonable R0 , but for more complex compartmental models, especially those with
more infected compartments, the study of the stability is difficult as it relies on the algebraic
Routh-Hurwitz conditions for stability of the Jacobian matrix.
An alternative method proposed by Diekmann, Heesterbeek, and Metz (1990) in [Diekmann et
al] and elaborated by van den Driessche and Watmough (2002) [Driessche et al 1] gives a way
of determining R0 for a compartmental model by using the next generation matrix.
Here an outline of this method is given, the proofs and further details can be found in van
den Driessche and Watmough (2002) [Driessche et al 1] and van den Driessche and Watmough
(2008) [Driessche et al 2] .
Let x = (x1 , x2 , ...., xm , ..., xn )T be the number of individuals in each compartment, where the
first m < n compartments contain infected individuals.
Assume that the equilibrium point x∗ exists and is stable in the absence of disease, and that the
linearized equations for x1 , ..., xm at the x∗ decouple from the other equations. The assumptions
are given in more details in the references cited above.
Consider these equations written in the form :
dxi
= Fi (x) − Vi (x), 1 ≤ i ≤ m
dt
In this splitting,
Fi (x) is the rate of appearance of new infections in compartment i,
and
Vi (x) is the rate of other transitions between compartment i and other infected compartments.

Remark 3.2
Let A = (aij ) be a n × n real matrix such that (aij ) ≤ 0 for all i 6= j, 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n. Then matrix
A is also an M-matrix if it can be expressed in the form A = sI − B, where B = (bij ) with
bij ≥ 0, for all 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n, where s is at least as large as the maximum of the moduli of the
eigenvalues of B, and I is an identity matrix.
For the non-singularity of A, according to the Perron-Frobenius theorem, it must be the case
that s > ρ(B). Also, for a non-singular M-matrix, the diagonal elements aii of A must be positive. Here we will further characterize only the class of non-singular M-matrices.

Definition 3.3 (Metzler matrix)
In mathematics, especially linear algebra, a matrix is called Metzler, quasipositive (or quasipositive) or essentially nonnegative if all of its elements are non-negative except for those on
the main diagonal, which are unconstrained. That is, a Metzler matrix is any matrix A which
satisfies A = (aij ); aij ≥ 0, i 6= j.

M -matrices are very useful. We can found some of their applications to ecology, numerical analy28

sis, probability, mathematical programming, game theory, control theory, and matrix theory. 
• Some fondamental properties of M-matrices
An M-matrix A ∈ Mn (R) is a matrix of the form A = αI − B, where B ≥ 0 (B is elementwise
nonnegative) and α ≥ ρ(B). (By the Perron-Frobenius theorem e.g., [Intissar arxiv], p. 26,
ρ(B), the spectral radius of B, is an eigenvalue of B.)
If A = αI − B, where I is the identity matrix, B is non-negative and α > ρ(B), then A is a
non-singular M-matrix ; if α = ρ(B), then A is a singular M-matrix.
There are many definitions of M-matrices equivalent to the above. For example, if a matrix A
has the Z sign pattern and ρ(A) > 0, then A is a non-singular M-matrix [4, p. 135 (G20)].
A matrix of the form αI − B, B ≥ 0 is called a Z−matrix.
• Observe that a Z−matrix A is an M −matrix if and only if A + l is nonsingular for all  > 0.
We said that a matrix A = (aij ) of order n has the Z sign pattern if aij ≤ 0 for all i 6= j.
if a matrix A has the Z sign pattern and ρ(A) > 0, then A is a non-singular M-matrix [[Berman et al], p. 135 (G20)].
From Exercise 6b of Horn and Johnson [[Horn-Johson], p. 127] and Berman and Plemmons
[[Berman et al], p. 159 (5.2)], we get the following lemma :
Lemma 3.4
Let A be a non-singular M-matrix and suppose B and BA−1 have the Z sign pattern.Then B
is a non-singular M-matrix if and only if BA−1 is a non-singular M-matrix.

In general, this lemma does not hold if B a singular M-matrix. It can be shown to hold if B is
singular and irreducible. However, this is not sufficient for our needs in part II of this work. we
shall need of the following lemma :
Lemma 3.5
Let A be a non-singular M-matrix and suppose B ≥ 0.Then,
(i) (A − B) is a non-singular M-matrix if and only A − B)A−1 is a non-singular M-matrix.
(ii)(A − B) is a non-singular M-matrix if and only A − B)A−1 is a non-singular M-matrix.
Proof
Let C = A − B). Then both C and CA−1 = I − BA−1 have the Z sign pattern. (Recall that
A−1 ≥ 0 since A is a non-singular M-matrix).
Hence, the above lemma implies statement (i). A separate continuity argument can be constructed for each implication in the singular case.
The following theorem collects conditions that characterize nonsingular M −matrices.

Theorem 3.6
Let A = αl − B, B ≥ 0. Then the following statements are equivalent :
a. α > ρ(B),
b. A is positive stable : If λ is an eigenvalue of A, then <eλ > 0,
c. A is nonsingular and A−1 ≥ 0,
d. Ax is positive for some positive vector x,
e. The principal minors of A are positive,
f. The leading principal minors of A are positive.
Proof
Conditions (b), (c), and (e) are due to Ostrowski [Ostrowski], who introduced the concept of
M −matrices. Condition (e) is known in the economics literature as the Hawkins-Simon condition [Hawkins-Simon]
Condition (d) is due to Schneider [Schneider] and Ky-Fan in [Fan] and the condition (f) to
Fiedler and Ptak [Fiedler-Ptàk].
Many additional characterizations of nonsingular (and of singular) M-matrices are given in
[Berman et al] .
A subset of the set of all M-matrices that contains the nonsingular M-matrices and whose matrices share many of their properties is the set of group-invertible M-matrices (M-matrices with
"property c").
Basic reproduction number R0 for the model can be established using the next generation matrix method [Cheng-Shan] and [Diekmann et al].

Corollary 4.2
If the parameters (β1 , β2 , ....., β10 ) satisfy one of the following conditions :
(i) β1 < β10 ;

Then the model (covid-19) has a unique equilibrium :



Definition 4.3
The equilibrium P ∗ = (E ∗ , I ∗ , C ∗ , H ∗ , D∗ ) is called feasible if its components are positive.



Thanks to [Driessche et al 1]., the following result is straightforward.
Theorem 4.4
If R0 < 1, the DFE is locally asymptotically stable. If R0 > 1, the DFE is unstable.



The epidemiological interpretation of Theorem 4.4 is that, (covid-19) can be eliminated in the
population when R0 < 1 if the initial conditions of the dynamical system (covid-19) are in
the basin of attraction of the DFE P0 .
The theorem 4.4 shows also that, R0 is a threshold which can determine if the disease will be
spread or not. Thus, reducing its value, is a means to mitigate or even eliminate the (covid-19) .
It can be therefore important to determine among model parameters those who mostly influence
its value.
Now let e(t) = E(t) − E ∗ , i(t) = I(t) − I ∗ , c(t) = C(t) − C ∗ , h(t) = H(t) − H ∗ and
d(t) = D(t) − D∗ then it is easy to verify that e, i, c, h and d satisfy the following system

Proposition 4.7
Let χ(λ) = λ3 + a1 λ2 + a2 λ + a3 , so that χ is uniformly asymptotically stable (uas), it is
necessary that it suffices that ∆1 = a1 > 0, ∆2 = a1 a2 − a3 > 0 and ∆3 = a3 ∆2 > 0.
A necessary condition for all the roots of the characteristic polynomial to admit a negative
real part, all the coefficients must be positive, that is to say : a1 > 0, a2 > 0, ..., a3 > 0.
• As

•1 If ∆χ > 0, 3 different real roots of the equation χ(λ) = 0.
•2 If ∆χ = 0, one double or triple root of the equation χ(λ) = 0.
•3 If ∆χ < 0, one real root and two complex roots of the equation χ(λ) = 0.
•4 if ∆χ > 0, then a necessary and sufficient condition for an equilibrium point to be
locally asymptotically stable is a1 > 0, a3 > 0, a1 a2 − a3 > 0.
•5 if ∆χ < 0, a1 < 0, a2 < 0, then all roots of χ(λ) = 0 satisfy the condition |arg(λ)| <

•6 if ∆χ > 0, a1 > 0, a2 > 0, a1 a2 − a3 = 0, then an equilibrium point is locally asymptotically stable.
•7 A necessary condition for an equilibrium point to be locally asymptotically stable is
a3 > 0.
•8 if the conditions ∆χ < 0, a1 > 0, a2 > 0, a1 a2 − a3 = 0 are satisfied, then an equilibrium
point is not locally asymptotically stable.
We remark that •4 , •6 and •4 are not satisfy by the coefficients of χ(λ). So we have to solve
the cubic equation χ(λ) = 0 by the Cardan’s method which is ingenious and effective, but quite
non-intuitive.

In second paper (Part II), In order to control the Covid-19 system, i.e., force the trajectories to
go to the equilibria we will add some control parameters with uncertain parameters to stabilize
the five-dimensional Covid-19 system studied in this paper.

Jp∗ ,u1 ,u2 ,u3 = Jp∗ + U and its second additive compound matrix (Jp∗ + U)[2] , by applying again
the criterion of Li-Wang on second compound matrix associated to the system (4.1) with these

We have constructed a Lyapunov function L of the system (4.1) for apply the classical Lyapunov theorem and to get :
Theorem 4.12
(i) (0, 0, 0, 0, 0) is a stable equilibrium point in the sense of Lyapunov.
(ii) V(e, i, c, h, d) < 0, 0 <|| (e, i, c, h, d) ||< r1 for some r1 , i.e. if L is lnd.
(iii) (0, 0, 0, 0, 0) is an asymptotically stable equilibrium point.
