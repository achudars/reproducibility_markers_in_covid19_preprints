Abstract: Epidemic modeling is an essential tool to understand the spread of the novel coronavirus and ultimately assist in disease prevention, policymaking, and resource allocation. In this article, we establish a
state of the art interface between classic mathematical and statistical models and propose a novel spacetime epidemic modeling framework to study the spatial-temporal pattern in the spread of infectious disease.
We propose a quasi-likelihood approach via the penalized spline approximation and alternatively reweighted
least-squares technique to estimate the model. Furthermore, we provide a short-term and long-term countylevel prediction of the infected/death count for the US by accounting for the control measures, health service
resources, and other local features. Utilizing spatiotemporal analysis, our proposed model enhances the dynamics of the epidemiological mechanism and dissects the spatiotemporal structure of the spreading disease.
To assess the uncertainty associated with the prediction, we develop a projection band based on the envelope
of the bootstrap forecast paths. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by a simulation study.
We apply the proposed method to model and forecast the spread of COVID-19 at both county and state levels
in the United States.

Background & Introduction

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak started last December,
and it has expanded to impact nearly every corner of the world. On New Year’s Eve of 2019, the
World Health Organization (WHO) was informed of mysterious pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China. On
January 3, 2020, 44 cases were reported to WHO, among whom 11 were severely ill (WHO, 2020b). By
February 4, confirmed cases had been reported in 24 countries outside China (WHO, 2020d). The US
confirmed its first case in Washington state On January 21 – a man who returned to the US from Wuhan
(CDC, 2020b). On January 30, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed the
person-to-person spread of coronavirus in the US (CDC, 2020). On the same day, the WHO declared
the coronavirus outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (WHO, 2020c,e).

Many nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were implemented to prevent the spread of COVID19. For example, Wuhan implemented screening measures for travelers leaving the city at airports,
railway stations, and other passenger terminals, and eventually closed off Wuhan City on January 22
(Qin and Wang, 2020). The US started screening at twenty airports at the end of January (Aratani
and Berger, 2020). On February 25, San Francisco became the first US city to declare a state of
emergency over COVID-19 (State of the City and County of San Francisco, 2020), followed by the
states of Washington (State of Washington, Office of the Governor, 2020) and Florida (State of Florida,
Office of the Governor, 2020). On March 13, President Donald Trump declared a national COVID-19
emergency (TRUMP, 2020), and sixteen states announced school closures by then (Ujifusa, 2020). On
March 19, California issued a “stay-at-home” order for all of its 40 million residents (Karimi and Moon,
2020), and within two weeks, the majority of the states had taken similar actions. By the end of March,
more than 91% of the world’s population lived in countries with restrictions for non-resident travelers
from abroad (Phillip Connor, 2020).
Even with all the control measures taken in place, the spread of COVID-19 is still dramatic. From
February 7 to 14, both the total cases confirmed and deaths worldwide almost doubled within one week.
Meanwhile, COVID-19 kept spreading globally, and over 50 countries reported confirmed cases by the
end of February (WHO, 2020a). During mid-March, COVID-19 presented in all 50 states in the US
Starting from March 26, the US led the world in COVID-19 cases. On May 28, the US COVID-19
death count passed one hundred thousand, and then in the middle of June, the number of confirmed
cases of COVID-19 hit two million in the US. The confirmed and death cases kept increasing rapidly
in the following months. By the beginning of September, the US surpassed six million confirmed cases
and hit seven million on September 25. On October 16, the US surpassed eight million confirmed cases
and 218 thousand deaths (CDC, 2020).
The effect of COVID-19 is profound. The World Bank estimated that the coronavirus pandemic
could push additional 16 million people into extreme poverty. On April 14, the International Monetary
Fund warned that the world is facing its worst economic downturn as coronavirus lockdowns continue
to wreak havoc on the global economy (Gopinath, 2020). Due to the immense pressures of the crippled
economy and an anxious public amid a pandemic, the US started to loosen lockdown measures in late
April and backtracked after reopening for a few weeks and seeing a surge in cases. As the pandemic
progresses, there are broader interests from the public in answering questions such as how far the
SARS-CoV-2 virus will spread, how many lives it will eventually claim, how effective intervention
strategies will be, as well as whether and when the pandemic will resurge.
Epidemic modeling is an important scientific tool to answer these questions by aiding people to
understand the pandemic data, make predictions, and help the medical professionals and decision-

3
makers allocate resources and design/evaluate intervention strategies to fight against COVID-19; see
Gog (2020); Vespignani et al. (2020). Several attempts had been made to model and forecast the spread
and mortality of COVID-19; for example, see Kucharski et al. (2020); Sun et al. (2020).
The fundamental concept of infectious disease epidemiology is investigating how the diseases
spread. Mathematical models are undeniably useful in understanding the dynamics of infectious disease
spread Keeling and Rohani (2008). An essential type of mathematical model is the class of mechanistic
models such as the Susceptible-Infectious-Removed (SIR) compartmental model or the SusceptibleExposed-Infectious-Recovered model (SEIR); see details in Brauer et al. (2008); Lawson et al. (2016).
Mechanistic models make explicit hypotheses about the biological mechanisms that drive the dynamics
of infection. These mechanistic models characterize disease transmission through a set of differential
equations, and they demonstrate the average behavior of the epidemic. Statistical modeling is another
powerful tool for extracting information about the disease spread in epidemic studies Held et al. (2020).
The data modeling is one of the cultures in statistical modeling, and it is usually designed for inference
about the relationships between variables whilst also catering to prediction. When analyzing the confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19, other factors, such as demographics, socioeconomic status,
mobility, and control policies, may also be responsible for temporal or spatial patterns. For maximal effectiveness, we create a novel method to appreciate and exploit the complementary strengths of
mathematical and statistical models in this paper.
We borrow the mechanistic rules from the SIR model and form a data-driven model with three
compartments: infectious, susceptible, and removed states. The capacity of the health care system,
and control measures, such as government-mandated social distancing, also have a significant impact
on the spread of the epidemic. We borrow the strength from statistical models and include various explanatory variables to study not only the spatiotemporal structure but also the effects of the explanatory
variables. Notice that the spread of the disease varies a lot across different geographical regions; we
incorporate discrete-time spatially varying coefficient models to different compartments to reconstruct
the spatiotemporal dynamics of the disease transmission. In general, the spatiotemporal models are
able to bring in more information to the epidemic study (Held et al., 2019; Jia et al., 2020).
With an emerging disease such as COVID-19, it is hard to measure many features of the transmission process, which may take a long time to fully understand. Thus, it is desirable to make inferences
from observed data as model-free as possible. For a parametric epidemic model, the typical inference
problem involves estimating the parameters associated with the parametric models from the data at
hand. Such specifications are ad hoc, and if misspecified, can lead to substantial estimation bias problems. This issue might be addressed in practice by considering alternative nonparametric models or
sensitivity analyses if some of the underlying model parameters are assumed to be known. By adopting

4
a nonparametric approach, we do not impose a particular parametric structure, which significantly enhances the flexibility of the parametric epidemic models. Nonparametric approaches to fitting epidemic
models to the data have received relatively little attention in the literature, possibly due to the lack of
data. With the rich COVID-19 epidemic data released every day, we can consider the nonparametric
method to model the covariates and coefficient functions.
By allowing the response (such as infected and death counts) to depend on time and location,
we consider a generalized additive varying coefficient model to estimate the unobserved process of
the disease transmission. For our model estimation, we propose a quasi-likelihood approach via the
penalized spline approximation and an iteratively reweighted least-squares technique. Our proposed
algorithm is sufficiently fast and efficient for the user to analyze large datasets within seconds. As
an empirical illustration, we apply the proposed model and estimation method to a study of COVID19 at the county-level in the US. We illustrate how the proposed method can be used to analyze the
spatiotemporal dynamics of the disease spread and guide evidence-based decision making.
Finally, prediction models for COVID-19 at the county-level that combine local characteristics and
actions are very beneficial for the community to understand the dynamics of the disease spread and
support decision making at a time when they are urgently needed. Knowing more about the vulnerable
communities and the reasons for those communities that are more likely to be infected are crucial for
the policy and decision-makers to assist in prevention efforts and ultimately stop the pandemic. In this
paper, we consider both the short-term impact and long-term impact of the SARS-CoV-2 virus at the
county level in the US. To assess the uncertainty associated with the prediction, we also propose a
projection band constructed based on the envelope of the bootstrap forecast paths, which are closest to
the forecast path obtained based on the original sample.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the epidemic and endemic data.
Section 3 outlines the nonparametric spatiotemporal modeling framework and describes how to incorporate additional covariates. Section 4 introduces our estimation method, our algorithm, and details of the implementation. Section 5 provides the prediction as well as the uncertain quantification
with the prediction band of the forecast path. Section 6 evaluates the finite sample performance of
the proposed method using a simulation study. Section 7 describes the results and findings of the
case study. Section 8 concludes the paper with a discussion. Supplementary Material (https:

COVID-19 Case Study and Data
2.1

Research Goal of the Study

The goal of this study is threefold. First, we develop a new dynamic epidemic modeling framework for
public health surveillance data to study the spatial-temporal pattern in the spread of COVID-19. We
aim to investigate whether the proposed model could be used to guide the modeling of the dynamic of
the spread at the county level by moving beyond the typical theoretical conceptualization of context
where a county’s infection is only associated with its own features. Second, to understand the factors
that contribute to the spread of COVID-19, we model the daily infected cases at the county level in
consideration of the demographic, environmental, behavioral, socioeconomic factors in the US. Third,
we project the spatial-temporal pattern of the spread of the virus in the US. For the short-term forecast,
we provide the prediction of the daily infection count and death count up to the county level. As for the
long-term forecast, we project the total infected and death cases in the next three months.

2.2

Epidemic Data from the COVID-19 Outbreak in the US

This study analyzes data from the reported confirmed COVID-19 infections and deaths at the county
level, which are reported by the 3,104 counties from the 48 mainland US states and the District of
Columbia. The aggregated COVID-19 cases are from January 20 until September 3, 2020. The data
are collected, compiled and cleaned from a combination of public sources that aim to facilitate the research effort to confront COVID-19, including Health Department Website in each state or region, the
New York Times (NYT, 2020), the COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and
Engineering at Johns Hopkins University (JHU CSSE, 2020), and the COVID Tracking Project (Atlantic, 2020). These data sources automatically updated every day or every other day. We have created
a dashboard https://covid19.stat.iastate.edu/ to visualize and track the infected and
death cases, which was launched on March 27, 2020.

2.3

Information of the covariates

We consider various county-level characteristics as covariate information in our study, which can be
divided into six groups. The data sources and the operational definitions of these features are discussed
as follows, and a list of all the variables is summarized in Table 2.1.
Policies. Government declarations are used to identify the dates that different jurisdictions implemented various social distancing policies (emergency declarations, school closures, bans on large
gatherings, limits on bars, restaurants and other public places, the deployment of severe travel restrictions, and “stay-at-home” or “shelter-in-place” orders). President Trump declared a state of emergency
on March 13, 2020, to enhance the federal government response to confront the COVID-19. By March

6
16, 2020, every state had made an emergency declaration. Since then, more severe social distancing
actions had been taken by the majority of the states, especially those hardest hit by the pandemic. We
compiled the dates of executive orders by checking national and state governmental websites, news
articles and press releases.
Demographic Characteristics. To capture the demographic characteristics of a county, five variables are considered in the analysis to describe the racial, ethnic, sexual and age structures: the percent
of the population who identify as African American, the percent of the population who identify as
Hispanic or Latino, the rate of aged people (≥ 65 years) per capita, the ratio of male over female and
population density over square mile of land area. The former two variables were obtained from the
2010 Census (US Census Bureau, 2010), and the latter three variables are extracted from the 2010–
2018 American Community Survey (ACS) Demographic and Housing Estimates (US Census Bureau,
2010).
Healthcare Infrastructure. We incorporated three components in our analysis to describe the
healthcare infrastructure in each county: percent of the population aged less than 65 years without
health insurance, local government expenditures for health per capita, and total counts of hospital beds
per 1,000 population. These components measure the access for residents to public health resources
within and across counties. The first component is available in the USA Counties Database (US Census Bureau, 2010), the second is from Economic Census 2012 (US Census Bureau, 2012), and the
last is compiled from Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-level Data (US Department of Homeland
Security).
Socioeconomic Status. A diverse of factors are considered to describe the socioeconomic status in
each county. We first apply the factor analysis to seven factors collected from the 2005–2009 ACS 5year estimates (US Census Bureau, 2010), and generate two factors: social affluence and concentrated
disadvantage. To be specific, the former is comprised of the percent of families with annual incomes
higher than $75,000 (factor loading = 0.86), percent of the population aged 25 years or older with a
bachelor’s degree or higher (factor loading = 0.92), percent of the people working in management,
professional, and related occupations (factor loading = 0.73), and the median value of owner-occupied
housing units (factor loading = 0.74); whereas the latter includes the percent of the households with
public assistance income (factor loading = 0.34), the percent of households with female householders
and no husband present (factor loading = 0.81), and civilian labor force unemployment rate (factor
loading = 0.56). These two factors, affluence and disadvantage, explain more than 60% of the variation.
We also incorporate the Gini coefficient to measure income inequality. The Gini coefficient, also
known as Gini index, is a well-known measure for income inequality and wealth distribution in economics, with value ranging from zero (complete equality, where everyone has exactly the same income)

7
to one (total inequality, where one person occupies all of the income). The 2005–2009 ACS (US Census
Bureau, 2010) provided the household income data that allow us to calculate the Gini coefficient.
Rural/urban Factor. In the literature, rural/urban residence has been found to be associated with
the spread of epidemics. Specifically, rural counties are often characterized by poor socio-economic
profiles and limited access to healthcare services, indicating a potential higher risk. To capture rural/urban residence, we use the urban rate from the 2010 Census (US Census Bureau, 2010).
Geographic Information. The longitude and latitude of the geographic center for each county in
the US are available in Gazetteer Files (US Census Bureau, 2019).
Mobility. The data are collected and cleaned from the US Department of Transportation, Bureau of
Transportation Statistics and Descartes Labs. It describes the daily number of trips within each county
produced from an anonymized national panel of mobile device data from multiple sources. Trips are
defined as movements that include a stay of longer than 10 minutes at an anonymized location away
from home.

Space-time Epidemic Modeling

In this section, to study the spatiotemporal pattern of COVID-19, we developed a novel spatiotemporal
epidemic model (STEM) to estimate and predict the infection and death cases at the area level based on
the idea of the compartment models. For simplicity, we introduce the STEM based on the parsimonious
SIR models, but it can be extended to the SEIR models with an extra “exposed” compartment for
infected but not infectious individuals.
For area i and day t, let Yit be the number of new cases, and let Iit , Dit , Rit , and Sit be the
number of accumulated active infectious cases, accumulated death cases, accumulated recovered cases,
and susceptible population, respectively. Let Ni be the total population for the ith area, and denote
Zit = log(Sit /Ni ). Let Ui = (Ui1 , Ui2 )> be the GPS coordinates of the geographic center of area i,
which ranges over a bounded domain Ω ⊆ R2 of the region under study. Let Xi = (Xi1 , . . . , Xiq )> be
a q-dimensional vector of explanatory variables collected from the US Census Bureau. For example,
the socioeconomic factors, health resources, and demographic conditions. Let Aijt be the jth dummy
variable of actions or measures taken for area i at time t, and let Ait = (Ai1t , . . . , Aipt )> , which varies
with the time.
In this paper, we consider the exponential families of distributions. The conditional density of Yit
given (Ii−1 , Zi,t−1 , Ai,t−r , Xi , Ui ) = (w, z, a, x, u) can be represented as

We assume that the determinants of the daily new cases of a particular area can be explained not
only by the features of that area but also by the characteristics of the surrounding areas. Based on the
idea of the SIR models, we propose a discrete-time spatial epidemic model comprising the susceptible
state, infected state, removed state, and area-level characteristics. Below we use superscripts I, D and
R to denote infected, death and recovered states. We assume that the conditional mean value of daily
R
new positive cases (µIit ), fatal cases (µD
it ) and recovery (µit ) in area i and day t can be modeled via a

link function g as follows:

is to allow for deviations from mass action and to account for the discrete-time approximation to the
continuous time model (Finkenstädt and Grenfell, 2000; Wakefield et al., 2019). In many cases, the
standard bilinear form may not necessarily hold. The above proposed epidemic model incorporates the
nonlinear incidence rates, which represents a much wider range of dynamical behavior than those with
I (·),
bilinear incidence rates (Liu et al., 1987). These dynamical behaviors are determined mainly by β0t
I (·), β D (·), and β D . For example, when β I (·) and αI are both 1, it corresponds to the standard

assumption of homogeneous mixing in De Jong et al. (1995).
In our study, since we model the number of new cases at time t for area i, Poisson or Negative
Binomial (NB) might be an appropriate option for random component (Kim and Wang, 2020; Yu et al.,
2020). For example, for the infection model, we can assume that

10
• (Poisson) E(Yit |Zi,t−1 , Ai,t−r , Xi , Ui ) = µIit , Var(Yit |Zi,t−1 , Ai,t−r , Xi , Ui ) = µIit ,
• (NB) E(Yit |Zi,t−1 , Ai,t−r , Xi , Ui ) = µIit , Var(Yit |Zi,t−1 , Ai,t−r , Xi , Ui ) = µIit (1+µIit /Ii,t−1 ),
where µIit can be modeled via the same log link as follows:

We can consider similar models for the death count. At the beginning of the outbreak, infected and
death cases could be rare, so “Poisson” might be a reasonable choice of the random component to
describe the distribution of rare events in a large population. As the disease progresses, the variation of
infected/death count increases across counties and states. So, at the acceleration phase of the disease,
the negative binomial random component might be an appropriate option for the presence of overdispersion.
The above spatiotemporal epidemic model (STEM) is developed based on the foundation of epidemic modeling. It can provide a rich characterization of different types of errors for modeling the
uncertainty. Moreover, it accounts for both spatiotemporal nonstationarity and area-level local features
simultaneously. It also offers flexibility in assessing the dynamics of the spread at different times and
locations than various parametric models in the literature.

Estimation of the STEM

In this section, we describe how to estimate the parameters and nonparameteric components in the
proposed STEM model. To capture the temporal dynamics, we consider the moving window approach.

4.1

Penalized Quasi-likelihood Method

We first describe the estimation of model (3.1). For the current time t, and rounghness parameters λ0
and λ1 , we consider the penalized quasi-likelihood problem defined as follows:

where t0 + 1 is the window width for the model fitting, and it can can be selected by minimizing the
prediction errors or maximizing the correlation between the predicted and observed values. The energy
functional is defined as follows:
Z

E(β) =
(∇u1 β) + 2(∇u1 ∇u2 β)2 + (∇2u2 β)2 du1 du2 ,

(4.2)

where ∇quj β(u) is the qth order derivative in the direction uj , j = 1, 2, at any location u = (u1 , u2 )> .
Note that, except for parameters {αj }pj=0 , other functions are related to curse of dimensionality
due to the nature of functions. To handle this difficulty, we employ the basis expansion approach to approximate the univariate and bivariate functions discussed below. The univariate additive components
{γk (·)}qk=1 and the spatially varying coefficient components {β` (·)}1`=0 in model (3.4) are approximated using univariate polynomial spline and bivariate penalized splines over triangulation (BPST), respectively. The BPST method is well known to be computationally efficient to deal with data distributed
on complex domains with irregular shape or with holes inside; see the details in Lai and Wang (2013)
and Sangalli et al. (2013). We provide a brief introduction to univariate and bivariate splines below.
Assume that Xk takes value on an interval [ak , bk ], k = 1, . . . , q. Let Uk = Uk% ([ak , bk ]) be the space of
the polynomial splines of order % + 1. Next, let Uk0 = {φ ∈ Uk : Eφ(Xk ) = 0}, which creates a space
of the centered spline functions; see Xue and Liang (2010), Liu et al. (2013) and Wang et al. (2020c).
Let J be the index set of the basis functions, and then denote by {ϕkJ (xk ), J ∈ J } the original Bspline basis functions for the kth covariate. Let ϕ0kJ (xk ) = ϕkJ (xk ) − ϕk1 (xk )EϕkJ (Xk )/Eϕk1 (Xk ),
ΦkJ (xk ) = ϕ0kJ (xk )/SD{ϕ0kJ (Xk )}, J ∈ J , then EΦkJ (Xk ) = 0 and EΦ2kJ (Xk ) = 1. For
P
>
all xk ∈ [ak , bk ], the estimator of γk (xk ) is γ
bk (xk ) =
J∈J ξkJ ΦkJ (xk ) = Φk (xk )ξ k , where
Φk (xk ) = (ΦkJ (xk ), J ∈ J )> and ξ k = (ξkJ , J ∈ J )> is a vector of coefficients.

For the bivariate coefficient functions β0 (·) and β1 (·) in the STEM model (3.4), we introduce
bivariate spline over triangulation (Lai and Wang, 2013). The spatial domain Ω with either an arbitrary
shape or holes inside can be partitioned into M triangles, T1 , . . . , TM , that is, Ω = ∪M
m=1 Tm . Then,
denote 4 := {T1 , . . . , TM } by a triangulation of the domain Ω (Lai and Schumaker, 2007); see, for
example, Figure 6.3. Given an integer d ≥ 0, let Pd (T ) be the space of all polynomials of degree ≤ d
on T . Let Cr (Ω) be the space of rth continuously differentiable functions over the domain Ω. For
0 ≤ r < d and 4, we construct the spline space of degree d and smoothness r over 4 in the following:
Srd (4) = {P ∈ Cr (Ω) : P|Tm ∈ Pd (Tm ), Tm ∈ 4, m = 1, . . . , M }.

(4.3)

For triangulation 4 with M triangles, denote a set of bivariate Bernstein basis polynomials for
Srd (4)

as {Bm (u)}m∈M , where an index set M for basis functions has its cardinality |M| = M (d +

1)(d+2)/2. Then, we can approximate the bivariate functions β` (·) ∈ Srd (4) in the STEM model (3.4)

by m∈M Bm (u)θ`m = B(u)> θ ` , where B(u) = {Bm (u), m ∈ M}> and θ ` = {θ`m , m ∈ M}> .
In practice, the triangulation can be obtained through varieties of software; see for example, the
“Delaunay” algorithm (delaunay.m in MATLAB or DelaunayTriangulation in MATHEMATICA), the
R package “Triangulation” (Wang and Lai, 2019), and the “DistMesh” Matlab code. The bivariate
spline basis are generated via the R package “BPST” (Wang et al., 2019). See more discussions of how
to generate the bivariate spline over triangulations in Mu et al. (2018) and Yu et al. (2020).

Considering the basis expansion, the energy functional E(β` ) in (4.2) can be approximated by
E(B(·)> θ ` ) = θ >
` Pθ ` , for ` = 0, 1, where P is a block diagonal penalty matrix. By introducing the
constraint matrix H which satisfies Hθ ` = 0, ` = 0, 1, we can reflect global smoothness in Srd (4) in
(4.3). For the current time t, the maximization problem (4.1) is changed to minimize

Directly solving the optimization problem in (4.4) is not straightforward due to the smoothness con

where Q1 is the first r columns of an orthogonal matrix Q, and R2 is a matrix of zeros, which is a submatrix of an upper triangle matrix R. Then, reparametrization of θ ` = Q2 θ ∗` for some θ ∗` , ` = 0, 1,
enforces Hθ ` = 0. Thus, the constraint problem in (4.4) can be changed to an unconstrained optimization problem as follows:

Compared with the traditional nonparametric techniques, such as kernel smoothing, the proposed
algorithm is much more computationally efficient. Therefore, we can easily apply our method to analyze massive spatiotemporal data sets.

4.3

Modeling the Number of Fatal and Recovered Cases

To fit the proposed STEM and make predictions for cumulative positive cases, one obstacle is the lack
of direct observations for the number of active cases, Iit . Instead, the most commonly reported number
is the count of total confirmed cases, Cit . Some departments of public health also release information

14
about fatal cases Dit and recovered cases Rit , while such kind of data tends to suffer from missingness,
large error and inconsistency due to its difficulty in data collection; see the discussions in KCRA (2020).
Based on the fact that Iit = Cit − Rit − Dit , we attempt to modeling Dit and Rit in order to
facilitate the estimation and prediction of newly confirmed cases Yit based on the proposed STEM
model. Let ∆Dit = Dit − Di,t−1 be the new fatal cases on day t. Note that patients who die on any
given day were infected much earlier. Using similar notations in the STEM model (3.4), we assume
that
∆Dit |Xi , Ui , Ii,t−δ , Ai,t−r ∼ Poisson(µD
it ),

(4.7)

where δ = 14 is the time delay between illness and death as suggested in Baud et al. (2020), and

Ideally, if sufficient data for recovered cases can be collected from each area, a similar model
can be fitted to explain the growth of the recovered cases. However, there are no uniform criteria to
collect recovery reports across the US (Howard and Yu, 2020). According to the CDC, severe cases
with COVID-19 often require medical care and receive supportive care in the hospital. At the same
time, in general, most people with the mild illness are not hospitalized and suggested to recover at
home. Currently, only a few states regularly update the number of recovered patients, but seldom can
the counts be mapped to counties.
Due to the lack of data, we are no longer able to use all the explanatory variables discussed above to
model daily new recovered cases. Instead, we mimic the relationship between the number of recovered
and active cases from some Compartmental models in epidemiology (Anastassopoulou et al., 2020;
Siettos and Russo, 2013). At current time point t, we assume that ∆Ris = νt Ii,s−1 + εis , s =
t−t0 , . . . , t, in which the recovery rate νt enables us to make reasonable predictions for future recovered
patients counts and provide researchers with the foresight of when the epidemic will end. The rate νt
can be either estimated from available state-level data, or obtained from prior medical studies due to
the under-reporting issue in actual data.

4.4

Zero-inflated Models at the Early Stage of the Outbreak

It is well known that in the early stage of an epidemic, the quality of any model output can be affected by
the restricted quality of data that pertain to under-detection or inconsistent detection of cases, reporting
delays, and poor documentation, regarding infections, deaths, tests, and other factors. There are many
counties with zero daily counts at the early stage of disease spread. Therefore, we consider zero-inflated
models based on a zero-inflated probability distribution, i.e., a distribution that allows for frequent
zero-valued observations. Following the previous works (Arab et al., 2012; Wood et al., 2016), we

15
assume the observed counts Yit contributes to a zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) distribution, ZIP(µIit , pIit ),
specifically, we assume that
P (Yit = y|Ii,t−1 , Zi,t−1 , Ai,t−r , Xi , Ui ) =

unknown parameters. Here we take b0 = 0 and a1 , a2 are estimated with the roughness parameters.
See Wood et al. (2016) for the estimation of a1 and a2 .
Let ∆Dit = Dit − Di,t−1 be the number of new fatal cases on day t. Similarly, we can consider
zero-inflated models for fatal cases, in which we assume the observed count ∆Dit contributes to a ZIP

distribution ZIP(µD

Forecast and Band of the Forecast Path

Understanding the impact of COVID-19 requires accurate forecasting of the spread of infectious cases
as well as analysis of the number of deaths and recoveries. In this section, we describe our prediction
procedure of these counts; specifically, we are interested in predicting the number of new infected cases
and deaths. We also provide the prediction band to quantify the uncertainty of the prediction.

5.1

The h-step Ahead Prediction

We first consider an h-step ahead prediction. If we observe Cis , Iis , Ris , Dis for s = 1, . . . , t, then the
n,t
infection model and fatal cases model can be fitted by regressing {Yis }n,t
i=1,s=t−t0 , {∆Dis }i=1,s=t−t0

on {Ii,s−1 , Zi,s−1 , Ai,s−r , Xi }n,t
i=1,s=1 , respectively. In our forecast, we fit the infection model (3.1)
and death model (3.2) alternatively to update the predicted number of cases in each compartment. To
be specific, the predictions of at t + h are

step predicted values can be plugged back into equation (5.1) to obtain the predictions for the following
days by repeating the same procedure.

5.2

Prediction Bands

There is substantial interest in quantifying the uncertainty for the forecasts with a succession of periods;
see, for example, Kong et al. (2018) and Murray et al. (2020). To assess the uncertainty associated with
the prediction, we propose to develop a prediction band that provides an upper and lower expectation
for the real path of the observations.
To construct the band for forecast path {Yi,t+h , h = 1, . . . , H}, we consider the bootstrap method
(Staszewska-Bystrova, 2009), in which the bootstrap samples are generated using the bias-corrected
bootstrap procedure. Bootstrapping is a powerful and flexible data analysis tool, which allows us to
assign measures of accuracy. By simulating the observed data from our estimated model, we collect
the bootstrap samples. For a given bootstrap sample, we re-estimate the model, and produce the corresponding forecast paths. The prediction uncertainty comes from two parts: the estimation variation and
the variation from the individual bootstrap sample. We construct 100(1 − α)% prediction band based
on the envelope covering all the forecast paths after deleting 100α% extreme paths from all bootstrap
paths. See Algorithms 5.1 and 5.2 for the details.

A Simulation Study

In this section, we conduct a simulation study to evaluate the finite sample performance of the proposed
method. In the simulation, we use a subset of covariates of the county-level characteristics analyzed in
Section 7. The response variable Yit and ∆Dit are generated from a ZIP distribution with the logarithm
of Poisson parameters generated as following:

also include the corresponding estimated functions from one experiment in Figure 6.2 (d)–(f) to show
that the spatial pattern can be very well captured using the proposed method. For recovery data, the
daily recovered cases are simulated by ∆Rit = ν R Ii,s−1 , where ν R = 0.07. We simulate data by
assuming that a pandemic emerged on March 15 with 1 case showed up in each of the 420 selected
counties. These counties are selected if COVID-19 cases had been found by March 15 in real data.
Then, daily confirmed, fatal and recovered cases are generated based on model (6.1) and (6.2) from a
ZIP distribution with the complimentary log of the zero probability being linearly dependent on the log
of the Poisson parameter µIit and µD

To evaluate the performance numerically, we conduct 100 Monte Carlo experiments with 9 or 14
days as the training window sizes. For the univariate spline smoothing, we use cubic splines with
two interior knots; and for the bivariate spline smoothing, we consider degree d = 2, smoothness
r = 1, and two different triangulations in Figure 6.3: 41 (119 triangles with 87 vertices) and 42 (522
triangles with 306 vertices). The root mean squared error (RMSE) for the parametric and nonparametric
components in models (6.1) and (6.2) are reported in Table 6.1. According to the numeric results, the

training data can help improve the accuracy in estimating most of the coefficient functions.

In addition, the root mean squared prediction error for h-day ahead predictions using 14 days
as the training period are presented in Table 6.2, h = 1, . . . , 28. For comparison, we also consider
the naive model that assumes a linear growth pattern for total confirmed cases for each county that
E(Cit |t) = βi0 + βi1 t, Var(Cit |t) = σi2 , where Cit stands for the number of total confirmed cases
in ith county. Comparing with the linear model separately fitted for each county without taking into
account the spatial correlation, the prediction performance of STEM is better, especially for the longterm forecast. We further construct 95% prediction bands based on the proposed bootstrap method and

calculate the empirical coverage rate based on 100 replications. Table 6.3 reports summary statistics
of the coverage rates for 3104 counties in 48 contiguous states. For each county, we examine how
often, out of 100 iterations, that the true infected/fatal cases curve falls inside the band all the time for a
two-week or four-week forecasting period. Eventually, the coverage rates are very close to the nominal
level for most counties, as shown by the quartiles.

Analysis and Findings in COVID-19

The goals of the following study are two-fold. First, we develop a new dynamic epidemic modeling framework for public health surveillance data to study the spatiotemporal pattern in the spread of
COVID-19. We aim to investigate whether the proposed model could guide the modeling of the dynamics of the spread at the county level by moving beyond the typical theoretical conceptualization
of context where a county’s infection is only associated with its own features. Second, to understand
the factors that contribute to the spread of COVID-19, we model the daily infected cases at the county
level, considering the demographic, environmental, behavioral, and socioeconomic factors in the US.

We consider the data collected from March 16 to September 3, 2020; see the data description in
Section 2. Note that in models (7.1) and (7.2), the covariate Controlit is a dummy variable for the
executive order “shelter-in-place” or “stay-at-home”, namely Controlit = 1 suggesting “shelter-inplace” taken place for county i at time t, while Controlit = 0 suggesting no restriction or restriction
lifted. See Table 2.1 for details of other county-level predictors.
We use 28 days, two incubation periods, as an estimation window to examine how the covariates
affect the newly infected cases and fatal cases, and we choose δ = 14. The roughness parameters are
selected by the generalized cross-validation (GCV). The performance of the univariate and bivariate

splines is dependent upon the choice of the knots and triangulations, respectively. We use cubic splines
with two interior knots for the univariate spline smoothing. We generate the triangulations according
to “max-min” criterion, which maximizes the minimum angle of all the angles of the triangles in the
triangulation. We consider the same triangulations as shown in Figure 6.3: 41 and 42 . By the “maxmin” criterion, 42 is better than 41 , but it also significantly increases the number of parameters to
estimate. As a trade-off, for the estimation of β0I (·) and β1I (·), we adopt the finer triangulation 42 , and
use the rough triangulation 41 to estimate β0D (·) due to the sparsity problem in the death count and
many zeros observed.
First of all, we describe our findings from modeling the COVID-19 related infection counts in
3,104 counties from the 48 mainland US states and the District of Columbia. To examine the effect
of the control measures (“shelter-in-place” or “stay-at-home” orders) and mobility level after 7 days,
I = 0, j = 1, 2 in model (7.1). Figure 7.1 (a) shows that the control
we test the hypothesis: H0 : αjt

measure is significant for the infected count most of the time. Figure 7.1 (b) shows that the p-value of
the mobility is always less than 0.0001, and thus the mobility is significant for the entire study period.

SCBs in Figure 7.2. Based on Figure 7.2, we can observe that at the beginning of the pandemic, the
infected cases increase with the population density (PD), which is consistent with our intuition. We
also find that the infections increase with African American Ratio and Hispanic Latino Ratio at the
beginning of the outbreak.

We also study the effect of the covariates over time. Figure 7.3 shows the effect of the aged
people rate at different time points over the outbreak. In the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic,

25
from March to April, COVID-19 struck the elderly more severely than the younger people. By midApril and May, we saw that those communities with less aged people suffered more from COVID19. Counties with a very high rate of aged people still experience high infection rates. However,
when people understood the virus more and took action to protect the senior people, from mid-June to
September, those counties with a higher rate of aged people became those least infected.

“Affluence”, “Disadvantage”, “EHPC”, “AA” and “SEX” are significant with p-values smaller than
0.05 most of time, while the rest of the predictors are significant on some days, but insignificant on

26
other days.
In addition, movies 13 and 14 in the Supplementary Material illustrate the estimated coefficient
functions of β0I (·) and β1I (·) in model (7.1). From Movie 13, we can see that the transmission rate,
β0I (·), varies at different locations and in different phases of the outbreak, especially the high rate in
late March and April. Movie 14 shows that β1I (·) also varies from one location to another location,
which indicates that the homogeneous mixing assumption of the simple SIR models does not hold. The
transmission rate is high in most states at the end of April; however, it became much lower since June.
Movie 15 on the Supplementary Material shows the pattern of βbD in model (7.2). From this animation,

we observe a severe fatality condition in the southern states in July and a pattern of general decrease in

Short-term Forecasting Performance and Results

In this section, we investigate the short-term prediction performance of the proposed method. In the
following, we consider h-day ahead prediction based on the forecasting method described in Section 5.
We choose nine days as a training window for model fit to predict the next seven days, which minimizes
the mean squared prediction errors.
An R shiny app (Wang et al., 2020a) is developed to provide a 7-day forecast of COVID-19 infection and death count at both the county level and state level, in which the state level forecast is
obtained by aggregating forecasts across counties in each state. This app was launched on 03/27/2020
for displaying the results of our 7-day forecasting.
We demonstrate the accuracy of the STEM for h-day ahead predictions, h = 1, . . . , 7. For comparison, we also consider the two naive models that assume a linear or exponential growth pattern for
total confirmed cases for each county: for i = 1, . . . , n,
• (Linear) E(Cit |t) = βi0 + βi1 t, Var(Cit |t) = σi2 ;
• (Exponential, Poisson) log{E(Cit |t)} = βi0 + βi1 t, Var(Cit |t) = exp(βi0 + βi1 t);
and the following simple epidemic method (EM):
D
D
• (EM) log(µit ) = β0 + β1 log(Ii,t−1 ), log(µD
it ) = β0 + β1 log(Ii,t−14 ).

We consider the data collected from April 8 to September 3, 2020. To show the accuracy of
different methods, we compute the following root mean-squared prediction errors (RMSPEs):

Table 7.1 shows the average of the RMSPEs for h-day. From this table, we can see that our proposed method performs the best in predicting the infection count regardless of the date for prediction.
When predicting the death count, both EM and STEM methods outperform the other competitors.
Overall, we can see that our proposed method outperforms other competing methods in terms of the
prediction accuracy. When we analyze the COVID-19 dataset, we also notice a strong temporal-pattern.
To be more specific, at the beginning of this pandemic, a more complex model is necessary to describe
the outbreak’s different severe levels. As the pandemic expands, a simpler model can be used for future
prediction. Start from middle July, a more complex model is necessary due to the pandemic’s pattern
change. Hence, a more flexible model like the STEM is more appropriate for COVID-19 data analysis.

Long-term Forecasting Performance and Results

With the rapid spread of the COVID-19 across the US, there has been an increasing public health
concern regarding the adequacy of resources to treat infected cases. It is well known that hospital beds,
intensive care units, and ventilators are critical for the treatment of patients with severe illness. To
predict the timing of the outbreak peak and the number of health resources required at a peak, in this
section, we also provide the long-term projection of the death counts, assuming that the future will
continue to follow the current pattern, and current interventions will remain the same till the end of
forecasting period.
The long-term projections are conducted at the county and state levels, respectively. Due to the lack
of reliable recovered data, we consider the recovery rate uniformly distributed from 5% ∼ 15%, where
the recovery rate is defined as the number of daily recovered cases divided by the number of active cases
14 days (one incubation period) ago. Figure 7.5 (a) - (f) show the one month-ahead prediction and the

29
corresponding 95% prediction band in six different counties. Table 7.2 summarizes the performance of
the one month-ahead projection for county-level fatal cases. We use the root of mean squared prediction
error to measure the prediction performance. Table 7.2 shows that our proposed method has good
prediction performance. The prediction error increases as time goes by, as the error will accumulate
over time. Also, we evaluate the performance of the prediction band. We calculate the empirical
coverage rate: the proportion of counties for which the h-day ahead prediction band, h = 1, . . . , 30,
covers the observed counts. From Table 7.2, we see that the empirical coverage rates of the county-level
band are close to the nominal level for one week-ahead prediction, and we still have a good coverage
rate even for one month-ahead prediction. The projection for other counties and states can be found
from our weekly updated Shiny App (Wang et al., 2020b) and the webpage of CDC (CDC, 2020a).
Note that CDC (2020a) presents predicted death counts for the next four weeks in the US provided by
different research teams, including ours, through which we can compare our long-term projection with
the other methods. It shows that our approach gives reliable guidance of the trend of death in the future.

Conclusion and Discussion

This work has aimed to bridge the gap between mathematical models and statistical analysis in the
infectious disease study. We created a state-of-art interface between mathematical models and statistical
models to understand the dynamic pattern of the spread of contagious diseases. Our proposed model
enhances the dynamics of the S(E)IR mechanism through spatiotemporal analysis.
For analyzing the confirmed and death cases of COVID-19, other factors may also be responsible
for temporal or spatial patterns. We investigated the spatial associations between the infected count,

at the county-level and combining local characteristics are very beneficial for the community to understand the dynamics of the disease spread and support decision-making when urgently needed. To
examine spatial nonstationarity in the transmission rate of the disease, we proposed a nonparametric
spatially varying coefficient model, which allows the transmission to vary from one area to another
area. The proposed method can be used as an essential tool for understanding the dynamics of the
disease spread, as well as for assessing how this outbreak may unfold through time and space.
Based on our results, disease mapping can easily be implemented to illustrate high-risk areas and
thus help policymaking and resource allocation. Our method can also be extended to other situations,
including epidemic models in which there are several types of individuals with potentially different area
characteristics or more complex models that include features such as latent periods or a more realistic
population structure.
Our paper did not take the under-reported issue (for example, the asymptomatic coronavirus infectious cases) into account. Although our model may have partially corrected the problem with the
spatiotemporal information, a better way to ultimately solve this problem is to use survey data based on
a representative survey sampling strategy Held et al. (2019). For example, following Finkenstädt and
Grenfell (2000), we can assume that the true number of confirmed cases (Cit∗ ) is related to the number
of reported cases (Cit ) via Cit∗ = ρit Cit , where ρit is the reporting rate, and can be estimated based on
the survey data. Then, our STEM can be extended further to this scenario.
