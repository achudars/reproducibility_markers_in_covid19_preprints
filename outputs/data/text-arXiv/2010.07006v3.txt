Abstract
A method of Transitional Automorphic Mapping of the Genome on Itself (TAMGI) is aimed at combining detection
and reconstruction of correlational and quasi-periodic motifs in the viral genomic RNA/DNA sequences. The motifs
reconstructed by TAMGI are robust with respect to indels and point mutations and can be tried as putative
therapeutic targets. We developed and tested the relevant theory and statistical criteria for TAMGI applications. The
applications of TAMGI are illustrated by the study of motifs in the genomes of the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronaviruses SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (the latter coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 being responsible for
the COVID-19 pandemic) packaged within filament-like helical capsid. Such ribonucleocapsid is transported into
spherical membrane envelope with incorporated spike glycoproteins. Two other examples concern the genomes of
viruses with icosahedral capsids, satellite tobacco mosaic virus (STMV) and bacteriophage PHIX174. A part of the
quasi-periodic motifs in these viral genomes was evolved due to weakly specific cooperative interaction between
genomic ssRNA/ssDNA and nucleocapsid proteins. The symmetry of the capsids leads to the natural selection of
specific quasi-periodic motifs in the related genomic sequences. Generally, TAMGI provides a convenient tool for
the study of numerous molecular mechanisms with participation of both quasi-periodic motifs and complete repeats,
the genome organization, contextual analysis of cis/trans regulatory elements, data mining, and correlations in the
genomic sequences.

1. Introduction
The development of antiviral drugs is based mainly on targeting specific motifs in viral proteins
and/or viral genomes (De Clercq, 2006; Müller and Kräusslich, 2009; Lou et al., 2014; Kretova et al.,
2017; Kravatsky et al., 2017). Sequencing of viral genomes provides the primary source of information
(Wohl et al., 2016; Houldcroft et al., 2017). Then, the viral sequences are annotated against available
databases (Sharma et al., 2016; Ibrahim et al., 2018). The choice of putative targets in viral genomes is
strongly hampered by high frequency of point mutations and indels. In this paper we describe a method
for combined detection and reconstruction of correlational and quasi-periodic motifs which is
approximately robust with respect to point mutations and indels.
The method of Transitional Automorphic Mapping of the Genome on Itself (TAMGI) is based on
the extension and adaptation of the well-known correlation function technique (see, e.g., Chechetkin and
Turygin, 1996; Li, 1997; Lobzin and Chechetkin, 2000; Bernaola-Galván et al., 2002; and further
references therein). The primary objects in our approach are correlational motifs. Generally, they cannot
be reduced to the sparse or tandem repeats with gaps and alignments. As periodic features produce
decaying or persistent oscillations in correlational motifs separated by distances multiple to the period, the
periodic features can also be detected by the suggested method. TAMGI is able to reconstruct tandem
repeats (both complete and incomplete) as well. In this latter problem it overlaps with the methods
developed by the other authors (Benson, 1999; Szklarczyk and Heringa, 2004; Boeva et al., 2006; Sokol
et al., 2007; Shi and Liang, 2019). With respect to the whole genome, TAMGI can be considered as an
analog of principal component analysis. The distribution of correlational motifs over the genome provides
information about large-scale genome organization.
The method of TAMGI was sketched briefly in our paper (Chechetkin and Lobzin, 2021) when
applying to the study of ribonucleocapsid assembly/packaging signals in the genomes of the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronaviruses SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. In this publication we develop the
extended theory and derive the relevant statistical criteria for analysis of the output set of patterns in
TAMGI. To illustrate the applications, we chose the genomes of the coronaviruses SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2 packaged within the helical capsid as well as the genomes of two viruses with the
icosahedral capsids, satellite tobacco mosaic virus (STMV) and bacteriophage ϕX174 studied previously
(Chechetkin and Lobzin, 2019, 2021) by different methods. Such choices allow us to cross-check the
features detected by TAMGI and other methods.
2. Theory and methods
2.1. Transitional genome mapping
The algorithm for TAMGI is defined as follows. Let a nucleotide N m,α of the type α be positioned
at a site m of the genomic sequence. The nucleotide N m,α will be retained if it has at least one neighbor

3

N m-s,α or N m+s,α of the same type and be replaced by void otherwise (denoted traditionally by hyphen). All
neighbors of the same type, N m-s,α or/and N m+s,α , should also be retained. The resulting sequence after
TAMGI is composed of the nucleotides of four types (A, C, G, T) and the hyphens "-" denoting voids.
Further analysis is reduced to the study of all complete words of length k (k-mers) composed only of
nucleotides (voids within the complete words are prohibited) and surrounded by the voids "-" at 5'- and
3'-ends, -N k -. By definition, the complete words are non-overlapping. At the next stage, the mismatches
with hyphens to the complete words can be studied.
To avoid end effects and to ensure homogeneity of the mapping, the linear genomes will always
be circularized,

if 1 ≤ m ≤ M ;
 N m,α ,
N mc ,α = 
 N m − M ,α , if M + 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 M − 1,

(1)

where N m,α denotes the nucleotide of the type α ∈ (A, C, G, T) positioned at the site m and M is the
genome length. Choosing circularized mapping is natural and convenient for the study of quasi-repeating
motifs. The theory and simulations show that for even M the step M/2 should be considered apart from the
other steps. Therefore, the range of steps can be chosen from 1 to

 [ M / 2] for odd M ;
L=
 M/ 2 − 1 for even M ,

(2)

where the brackets denote the integer part of the quotient. Any sequence can be expanded via the
complete set of TAMGI components (TAMGI sequences for particular steps) with the steps from s=1 to
[M/2]. This means that TAMGI components can be considered as the generalized genome coordinates or
the principal components related to the genome organization.
The circularized version of TAMGI can also be described as follows. (i) Take and circularize a
linear genome. Superimpose two identical circular genomes over each other. (ii) Rotate clockwise one of
the genomes on a step s and count all coincidences between two genomes. (iii) Rotate counterclockwise
one of the genomes on a step s and count all coincidences between two genomes. (iv) Unite all
coincidences into one sequence and fill the voids by hyphens.
We explain the algorithm using particular fragment of 20 nt at the start of the genome for the
coronavirus SARS-CoV, 5'-ATATTAGGTTTTTACCTACC-3'. Let us choose the step s=3 for example.
The nucleotide T at the site m=2 has the neighboring nucleotide T at the site m=5; both nucleotides should
be retained. The nucleotide A at the site m=3 has the neighboring nucleotide A at the site m=6; both
nucleotides should also be retained. The nucleotide T at the site m=4 has no T-neighbors at both sites m=1
and 7 and should be replaced by hyphen, etc. If this fragment is circularized, the nucleotide A at the site
m=18 will have the neighboring nucleotide A at the site m=1 and both nucleotides should be retained.
Finally, the resulting sequence after TAMGI with the step s=3 has the form, ATA-TA--TT-TT--C-AC-,

4

and contains 1-mer, -C-; 2-mers, -TA-, -TT-, -TT-, -AC-; and 3-mer, -ATA-. Let the fragment above be
placed within region surrounded by indels, indel|ATATTAGGTTTTTACCTACC|indel. Then, the
application of TAMGI with the step s=3 to such sequence retains all neighboring nucleotides within
fragment, except possibly the nucleotides at the boundaries depending on the other neighbors. This means
that TAMGI is robust with respect to indels if the step s is less than the distances between indels. For N ID
indels homogeneously distributed over the genome of length M the mean distance between indels is
M/(N ID + 1). Only the motifs reconstructed by TAMGI with the steps s > M/(N ID + 1) will be affected by
indels. In this range TAMGI can be applied to the study of the general character of correlations which
remains robust in the presence of indels. Therefore, the duality of the combined detection/reconstruction
analysis by TAMGI provides additional opportunities and covers all range of the steps from 1 to L
defined by Eq. (2). The application of TAMGI to a sequence with complete tandem repeats yields long
words composed of repeats if the step s coincides with the length of repeats.
The typical protocol for application of TAMGI to the study of the viral genomic sequences is as
follows. Take conventional reference sequence from GenBank and perform the complete TAMGI
analysis for such sequence. Then, using isolates with real point mutations and indels, assess the
conservation of motifs and variations in correlations obtained by TAMGI. The most conserved motifs can
be recommended as putative therapeutic targets related to medical applications. Using real sequencing
data for the assessment of mutation impact on motifs is essential because the rate of mutations strongly
varies for different viruses. Many mutations make the virus unviable and lead to its extinction from
population. Only neutral or compatible mutations are permissible. Some rare mutations can be considered
as favorable. The mutations may be distributed over viral genomes strongly inhomogeneously and there
are conserved (approximately or strictly) regions on viral genomes with small frequency of mutations
(see, e.g., Kretova et al., 2017; Kravatsky et al., 2017). These complicated effects cannot be assessed by
simplified simulations.
2.2. Correlation motifs and tandem repeats
Unlike repeats (tandem, sparse, complete and incomplete), which are quite common objects, the
correlation motifs seem to be not considered before. Therefore, after presentation of TAMGI algorithm, it
would be useful to compare tandem and correlation motifs. Consider, e.g., the sequence ATGATCGGC.
If the repeats are searched for by a typical algorithm for triplets with one gap, one obtains AT-AT----,
whereas TAMGI with s = 3 yields AT-ATC--C. In the case of tandem repeats, TAMGI can be reduced to
the algorithm for incomplete tandem repeats after proper redefinitions and filtering, but generally the
results are different.
The tandem repeats in the viral genomes are rarely encountered but occur sometimes. In
particular, the genome of human coronavirus HCoV-HKU1 (GenBank accession: NC_006577.2) contains
fragment with 14 tandem repeats of 30 nt, AATGACGATGAAGATGTTGTTACTGGTGAC, coding for
amino acids NDDEDVVTGD (Woo et al., 2006). The application of TAMGI with the step s = 30 to this

5

fragment provides long 420-mer composed of tandem repeats, whereas, e.g., the mapping with s = 54
yields correlation motifs ATGACGATGA repeating with spacing of 30 nt. As the period p = 54 is equal
to the ribonucleocapsid helix pitch (see Section 3.1), this means that such correlation motifs may facilitate
the encapsidation. Generally, long tandem repeats are simultaneously a source of a variety of correlation
motifs which can play different functional roles and participate in various molecular mechanisms. Such
correlation motifs modified by mutations can subsequently be scattered over the genome. Being more
general object, the correlation motifs include tandem repeats as a particular case.
2.3. Normalization of nucleotide frequencies after TAMGI
The frequencies of nucleotides after TAMGI with the step s,

ϕ α, s = N α, s / M ; ϕ total , s = ∑ ϕ α, s ,

(3)

α

should be properly normalized to assess their statistical significance. The normalization ought to be
performed against the counterpart characteristics in the random sequences of the same nucleotide
composition. Below, we will always imply that the length of the genome satisfies the condition M >> 1.
The frequencies for the combinations
(non-N α )(N) s-1 N α (N) s-1 N α (N) s-1 ... N α (N) s-1 N α (N) s-1 (non-N α ) (where N α denotes the nucleotides of the type
α, N means any nucleotide and it is implied that there are n nucleotides of the type α with the proper
spacing s within this combination) can be assessed in the random sequences as

p n , α = (1 − ϕ α ) 2 ϕ nα ; n = 1, 2, ... ,

(4)

where ϕ α is the frequency of nucleotides of the type α in the genome. Then, the frequency of the
nucleotides of the type α after application of TAMGI, Φ α , is expressed through the frequencies defined
by Eq. (4) as follows,
∞

∑ np
n =2

n, α

= Φ α = ϕ 2α ( 2 − ϕ α ) ,

(5)

while the total frequency of nucleotides after TAMGI is obtained by summation over Φ α ,

Φ total = ∑ Φ α .

(6)

α

The variances for the frequencies defined by Eqs. (5) and (6) are determined for the random sequences by
the binomial distribution,
2
σ 2 ( Φ α ) = Φ α (1 − Φ α ) / M ; σ total
= ∑ σ2 ( Φ α ) .

(7)

α

6

This means that the total frequency defined by Eq. (6) can be presented in terms of a normalized
deviation,

κ s = (ϕ total , s − Φ total ) / σ total ,

(8)

(for notations, see Eqs. (3) and (5)–(7)). As can be proved (see also below), the deviations (8) in the
random sequences are governed by the Gaussian statistics and the deviations for the different steps s are
approximately independent. The steps with the pronounced deviations of high statistical significance (see
Eq. (8) and Section 2.4 below) are of primary interest. For quasi-periodic motifs with a period p, the
deviations (8) should reveal approximately equidistant peaks at the steps s = p, 2p, ... A part of
statistically significant deviations may be associated with correlations between nucleotides. The
normalized deviations defined by Eq. (8) unify dynamical range and presentation of data. Such
presentation facilitates the comparison of genomes with different nucleotide composition.
2.4. Distribution of k-mers after TAMGI
The frequency of words of length k, -N k - (where N means nucleotide of any type), in the random
sequences can be assessed as,
k
; k = 1, 2, ... ,
p k = (1 − Φ total ) 2 Φ total

(9)

where Φ total is defined by Eqs. (5) and (6). Let there be n k, s words of length k after TAMGI with the step
s. Then, the empirical probability to detect a word longer than k' can be determined as,
k

k

k =k ′

k =1

max
max
~
P~rs ( k ≥ k ′) = ∑ nk , s / ∑ nk , s .

(10)

The summation in Eq. (10) is performed up to the maximum detected length. The frequency of words
with lengths exceeding k' in the random sequences is given by
∞

k′
Φ ( k ≥ k ′) = ∑ pk = (1 − Φ total ) Φ total
.

(11)

k =k ′

The probability to find a word with a length exceeding k' in the complete pool of words can be calculated
as
k ′ −1
Pr( k ≥ k ′) = Φ ( k ≥ k ′) / Φ ( k ≥ 1) = Φ total
.

(12)

The empirical probability for the natural genomic sequences (10) should be compared with the
predictions for the random sequences expressed by Eq. (12). The difference between natural and
theoretical distributions can be statistically assessed by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov criterion.
The probability density corresponding to probability (12) is defined as

7

k −1
k
p( k ) = Φ total
− Φ total
; k = 1, 2, ... .

(13)

Then, the mean length of words and its variance in the random sequences after TAMGI are given by
∞

< k > = ∑ kp ( k ) = 1 /(1 − Φ total ) ,

(14)

σ 2 ( k ) = < k 2 > − < k > 2 = Φ total /(1 − Φ total ) 2 .

(15)

k =1

The mean number of all words in the random sequences after TAMGI can be assessed as

n words = M Φ ( k ≥ 1) = M Φ total (1 − Φ total ) = M Φ total / < k > .

(16)

The maximum length of words within the interval of steps ∆s = s 2 − s1 + 1 in the random sequences can
be estimated using Bonferroni approximation as
k′

max, ∆s
M ( s2 − s1 + 1) (1 − Φ total ) Φ total
= Ν thr .

(17)

A typical threshold for the statistical significance is Ν thr = 0.05, whereas the lower boundary for the
maximum length corresponds to Ν thr ≅ 1 .
2.5. Tests
The theoretical predictions for TAMGI of random sequences were tested by reshuffling the
genomic sequence for SARS-CoV (M = 29751, N A = 8481, N G = 6187, N T = 9143, N C = 5940). The
frequencies averaged over 10,000 random realizations were in complete agreement with the theoretical
results (5)–(7). The spectrum for normalized deviations (8) is shown in Fig. 1A and is homogeneous for
the circularized genome. As expected, the normalized deviations (8) are governed by Gaussian statistics
(see Fig. 1B). The distribution of k-mer lengths after TAMGI for a particular arbitrarily chosen step is
shown in Fig. 1C, while Fig. 1D shows the distribution of k-mer lengths for the steps 1–500. Both in Figs.
1C and 1D the deviations for distributions of word lengths for particular random realization from
theoretical probability defined by Eq. (12) appeared to be insignificant by Kolmogorov-Smirnov criterion.
As expected from Eq. (17), the maximum length detected for the set associated with the interval 1–500
appeared to be longer in comparison with that for a particular step. Thus, the tests prove that suggested
characteristics can be used for the study of real genomes.

3. Results
For illustration of TAMGI applications, we chose motifs in viral genomes evolved due to specific
interactions between genomic RNA/DNA during packaging into protein capsid (Rossmann and Rao,
2012; Mateu, 2013). As the main information in viral genomes is related to the coding for different
proteins needed for virus proliferation, the signals corresponding to genome packaging are evolved using
the redundancy of the genetic code. The detection and reconstruction of such motifs are especially
challenging because the specificity of molecular interactions is rather weak, while the point mutations and

9

indels induced mainly during replication stage are frequent. Helical, icosahedral or prolate capsids of
viruses possess a certain symmetry which can serve as a guiding thread to search for segment regularities
and distribution of motifs in the viral genomes (Chechetkin and Lobzin, 2019, 2021).
3.1. Quasi-periodic motifs in the genomes of the coronaviruses SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2
At the beginning of April 2021, the number of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) cases
exceeded 131.2 million, while the number of deaths over all world exceeded 2.9 million
(https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). The pandemic is still continuing and the second and third
waves of diseases are pending in many countries. The development of efficient medications and vaccines
against the coronaviruses needs the knowledge of main molecular mechanisms in the virus life cycle and
virus-host interaction (Ziebuhr, 2016; Saxena, 2020; O'Leary et al., 2020; Mishra and Tripathi, 2021).
The long (about 30,000 nt) non-segmented plus-sense single-stranded RNA genome of the coronaviruses
is packaged within a filament-like helical nucleocapsid, while the whole ribonucleocapsid is packaged
within a membrane envelope with spike glycoproteins in a mode resembling the outlines of the flower
petals (Neuman and Buchmeier, 2016; Masters, 2019; Chang et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2007; Gui et al.,
2017). The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 caused the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic and appeared to be
much more virulent than its relative SARS-CoV. The cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have
revealed that the ribonucleocapsid of SARS-CoV is helical with an outer diameter of 16 nm and an inner
diameter of 4 nm (Chang et al., 2014). The turn of the nucleocapsid is composed of two octamers
polymerized from dimeric N proteins (Chen et al., 2007). The pitch for the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid is 14
nm. The packaging of the SARS-CoV ssRNA genome near internal surface of helical nucleocapsid with
such parameters should correspond to 54–56 nt per helical turn (or 6.75–7 nt per N protein) (Chang et al.,
2014; Chechetkin and Lobzin, 2021). The counterpart cryo-EM data for SARS-CoV-2 are yet absent. The
bioinformatic analysis may elucidate similarities between structural characteristics of the nucleocapsids
for two coronaviruses. The whole ribonucleocapsid structure of coronaviruses remains invariant under
transition by one helical turn. Due to the transitional symmetry of a helix, weakly specific cooperative
interaction between ssRNA and nucleocapsid proteins should lead to the natural selection of specific
quasi-periodic motifs in the related genomic sequences (Chechetkin and Lobzin, 2021). In this section we
will show how these features can be established with TAMGI method.
We took for comparative analysis and illustration the reference genomic sequence for SARS-CoV
(GenBank accession: NC_004718; M = 29751, N A = 8481, N G = 6187, N T = 9143, N C = 5940) and the
genomic sequence for one of isolates of SARS-CoV-2 (GenBank accession: MT371038; M = 29719, N A
= 8873, N G = 5834, N T = 9554, N C = 5458). The general overviews for the corresponding normalized
deviations defined by Eq. (8) for TAMGI steps from 1 up to [M/2] are shown in Figs. 2A and 2B. About
two-thirds of the genome for both viruses code for replicase proteins. The large-scale segmentation
related to such coding mode is clearly seen in Figs. 2A and 2B. The pronounced peaks corresponding to
quasi-periodic motifs with period p ≈ 54 are shown in the inserts. The deviation for the step s = 54

10

appeared to be the highest for TAMGI data for SARS-CoV, whereas the deviation for the step s = 54 is a
bit lower than the highest deviation for s = 9 for TAMGI data for SARS-CoV-2. The deviations for the
multiples of the step s = 54 are also significant and indicate its quasi-periodic nature.
The distributions of k-mer lengths after TAMGI with the step s = 54 are shown in Figs. 2C and
2D and compared with the counterpart distributions for particular random realizations. The corresponding
distributions of k-mer lengths after TAMGI with the steps within the interval s = 1–500 are shown in
Figs. 2E and 2F and also compared with the counterpart distributions for particular random realizations.
The deviations between all natural and random distributions were highly statistically significant by
Kolmogorov-Smirnov criterion (Pr < 10-5).

The sequences after TAMGI with the step s = 54 and the lists of the words, -N k -, with k ≥ 12 for
TAMGI with the steps within interval s = 1–500 are explicitly reproduced in Supplements S1–S4. As is
seen from the list of motifs in Supplement S3, a part of the longest words for SARS-CoV was generated
by poly-A signal positioned at 3'-end of the genome and corresponding to transcription termination. The
counterpart signal was not reproduced in the version of the genomic sequence for SARS-CoV-2. We
retained, however, poly-A signal to illustrate the ability of TAMGI to detect such signals as well. By the
estimates in Section 2.1, the motifs corresponding to the steps s ≤ 500 should be robust in the presence of
about 60 indels, whereas their number is commonly within 1–5. The comparison of repertoires of words
with the lengths k ≥ 6 reveals their partial divergence between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2; however,
such words appeared to be closely conserved for different isolates of SARS-CoV-2 despite the load from
point mutations and indels (Chechetkin and Lobzin, 2021). The choice of the most conserved motifs at
the step s = 54 and the epitopes in N proteins responsible for the interaction between ssRNA and N
proteins provides the promising therapeutic targets for the development of an antiviral vaccine (Kramps
and Elbers, 2017; Chang et al., 2016; Dutta et al., 2020) (see also (Chechetkin and Lobzin, 2021) for
discussion and further references).
3.2. Motifs in the genome of the satellite tobacco mosaic virus (STMV)
The two next examples concern the viruses with icosahedral capsids. In the virus world, more
than a half of viruses belong to such species (Rossmann and Rao, 2012; Mateu, 2013). The icosahedral
symmetry comprises 15 axes of the second order, 10 axes of the third order, and 6 axes of the fifth order.
The total number of operations for the icosahedral symmetry is 60. The correspondence should be
searched between the (generally multiple) elements of icosahedral symmetry and the character of largescale quasi-periodic segmentation induced by weakly specific cooperative interactions between genomic
RNA/DNA and capsid proteins.

STMV, a small icosahedral plant virus with linear positive-strand ssRNA genome, may be
considered as one of the smallest reproducing species in nature (for a review and further references see
(Dodds, 1998; Larson and McPherson, 2010)). Its reproducibility needs both a host cell and a host virus
(tobacco mosaic virus in this case). The icosahedral capsid consisting of 60 identical subunits with
genomic ssRNA inside was resolved on 1.4 Å scale (Larson et al., 2014). The visible RNA revealed 30
double-helical segments, each about 9 bp in length, packaged along the edges of capsid icosahedron
(Zeng et al., 2012; Larson et al., 2014). The corresponding quasi-periodic segmentation on 30 segments

14

with the period p ≈ 35.3 nt was clearly pronounced in the Fourier spectra for this genomic sequence
(Chechetkin and Lobzin, 2019).
The genomic sequence of STMV is of length M = 1058 (GenBank accession: M25782). About a
half of the genome contains two overlapping ORF, the longer of which codes for coat protein, whereas
the other half contains UTR. The overview of TAMGI deviations for the genome of STMV is shown in
Fig. 3A. A significant deviation for s = 38 which can be associated with the period p ≈ 35.3 nt appeared to
be biased. The approximately equidistant peaks at s = 75 and 110 were biased as well. Only a significant
deviation at the step s = 69 can be associated with the doubled period p ≈ 35.3 nt. The capsid assembly is
presumed to be performed hierarchically via 5-fold intermediate (Rossmann et al., 1983). As genomic
ssRNA participates actively in virion assembly (Patel et al., 2017), a similar mechanism may be
suggested for RNA packaging. The peaks that can be associated with 5-fold segmentation are shown in
Fig. 3A (s = 211 and 427). The distribution of k-mers after TAMGI with the step s = 211 is presented in
Fig. 3B, whereas the complete distribution of k-mers after TAMGI with the steps from 1 to 528 is shown
in Fig. 3C. The deviations between these distributions and the counterpart distributions for random
sequences were found to be statistically insignificant by Kolmogorov-Smirnov criterion. The sequence
after TAMGI with s = 211 in GenBank format and the list of words with lengths k ≥ 9 are reproduced
explicitly in Supplements S5 and S6, respectively. The plot for the maximum length of words at the step s
is shown in Fig. 3D. The insert to Fig. 3D reveals short-range (up to s = 10–20) correlations for such
steps; the shorter the step s, the longer the maximum length of word. Note also the correlations between
significant deviation for the step s = 38 shown in Fig. 3A and the long maximum lengths for s = 37 and
38 (k' = 13 and 12, respectively) as well as the other significant deviations and maximum lengths shown
in Fig. 3D.
3.3. Motifs in the genome of the bacteriophage ϕX174
The bacteriophage ϕX174 belonging to Microviridae family presents an example of icosahedral
viruses with ssDNA genome packaging (for a review see, e.g., Doore and Fane, 2016). The capsid of the
mature virus is composed of 60 copies each of the coat protein F, the spike protein G, the DNA-binding
protein J, and 12 copies of the pilot protein H (McKenna et al., 1994). The proteins H and J are associated
with the inner capsid surface; the proteins H are beneath the centers of pentamers formed by the spike
proteins G. There is one-to-one association between J and F proteins. The interactions with J proteins
tether ssDNA to the inner capsid surface.
The circular genome of ϕX174 is of length M = 5386 and encodes 11 genes (GenBank accession:
NC_001422). Fourier analysis of this genome revealed a large-scale segmentation compatible with the
icosahedral symmetry (Chechetkin and Lobzin, 2019). The general overview for TAMGI deviations
determined for the ϕX174 genome is shown in Fig. 4A. The highest deviation for TAMGI corresponds to
s = 180 marked in the insert and can be associated with the segmentation on 30 segments compatible with
icosahedral symmetry. The deviation for the approximately doubled step s = 357 was also significant,

15

indicating a quasi-periodic nature of such segmentation. Another series of peaked deviations corresponds
to the step s = 30 associated with 180-segmentation. The commensurability of the steps s = 30 and 180
indicates the hierarchical nature of the genome packaging. Note that both modes of segmentation on 30
and 180 segments were highly significant by Fourier analysis (Chechetkin and Lobzin, 2019). The
deviation at the step s = 90 associated with segmentation on 60 segments, though not prominent, was also
significant. The high deviation for s = 1828 can be associated with 3-fold segmentation.

The distributions of k-mers for the step s = 180 and for the steps from 1 to 2692 are presented in
Figs. 4B and 4C in comparison with the counterpart distributions for the deviations for particular random
realization. Though the differences between two distributions are poorly seen on the logarithmic scale,
they are significant by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov criterion (Pr < 10-4). The plot for the maximum k-mer
lengths at the step s is shown in Fig. 4D and again revealed short-range correlations seen in the insert. The
clustering of maximum lengths around the steps associated with the characteristic segmentation modes
compatible with icosahedral packaging is marked explicitly in Fig. 4D. The sequence after TAMGI with
the step s = 180 in GenBank format and the list of words with lengths k ≥ 11 for the steps from 1 to 2692
are presented in Supplements S7 and S8. Generally, the results of analysis by TAMGI and Fourier
methods appeared to be concordant for the ϕX174 genome. The motifs found by TAMGI can be useful
for the experimental study of the genome packaging.
4. Discussion and conclusions
The common paradigm for the cooperative specific interaction between genomic RNA/DNA and
proteins is based on the consensus motifs in genomic sequences recognized by protein epitopes. The
length of consensus motifs is implied to be approximately fixed. Generally, the motifs may be clustered
into several groups with diverging consensus motifs. TAMGI indicates the possibility of the other
scenario for the molecular evolution of motifs. In the molecular mechanisms related to the correlational or
quasi-periodic motifs, the evolvement of motifs may start from approximately phased nucleotides of
particular type followed by subsequent generation of the longer and longer motifs with a distribution
resembling that of defined by Eq. (12). TAMGI reconstructs the longer motifs from the shorter ones. The
abundance of primary phased nucleotides facilitates the generation of the longer motifs in comparison
with counterpart motifs in the random sequences. As was argued above (Section 2.1), the correlational
motifs are robust with respect to indels. Longer correlational motifs are rather rare (cf. Eqs. (9) and (12))
and occupy relatively small fraction of the genome (the longer the motifs, the smaller the fraction of the
genome). If mutations in viral genomes were neutral, the occurrence of mutations directly within the
motifs would be rare merely because of their small statistical weight. This means that correlational motifs
are approximately robust to both point mutations and indels. The specific (correlational) surrounding of
motifs and their robustness with respect to mutations makes them the plausible candidates on the
functional significance in the mechanisms of virus life cycle. Indeed, the motifs that can be associated
with packaging of viral genomes within capsid are persistently abundant in the genomes considered in
Section 3. The longest motifs may serve as a seed of a particular molecular mechanism or play multifunctional role similar to cis/trans regulatory elements. The contextual analysis of the known cis/trans
elements with TAMGI may elucidate the mechanisms of their evolving and be useful for data mining.
The screening of the longest words against available databases would also be useful. The incorporation of
relatively long (about 20 nt) correlation motifs into oligonucleotides immobilized on the surface of
microarrays may facilitate the detection of viruses by microarrays (for a review on microarrays see, e.g.,
Dufva, 2009).

17

The extension of TAMGI on the mapping of complementary stretches is non-trivial. Such
analysis is important, e.g., for the predictions of secondary structures of ssRNA viruses within the
icosahedral capsids (Schroeder, 2014, 2018; Larman et al., 2017). The geometrical constraints imposed
by capsid and the interaction between RNA and capsid proteins make such secondary structure different
from free structure in solution. A possible extension of TAMGI for this problem can be achieved by using
two windows of equal lengths w with centers separated by step s. To exclude the overlapping of windows,
the inequality s > w should be fulfilled. The fragment within one of windows should, first, be mapped
onto its complementary counterpart and, then, such complementary fragment can be mapped onto the
fragment in the second window by the rules similar to TAMGI. Such complementary mapping retains the
mutually complementary nucleotides within windows. Varying s-w parameters provides a set of twoparameter complementary mappings.
The pool of k-mer motifs reconstructed by TAMGI needs additional analysis. The overlapping
shorter motifs can be used for the putative assembly of the longer motifs. Nevertheless, even relatively
short motifs with k ≥ 6 for the step s = 54 appeared to be stably reproduced in the genomes of SARSCoV-2 isolates (Chechetkin and Lobzin, 2021). In particular, the total number of 6-mers at s = 54 is 106
for SARS-CoV and 128 for SARS-CoV-2 that is nearly twofold higher than the corresponding number of
6-mers in the randomly reshuffled sequences. This means that the characteristic correlational and quasirepeating motifs can be used, e.g., for therapeutic targeting, subtyping of viruses or for the assessment of
evolutionary divergence between species. The inhomogeneity of motif distribution over the genome and
the regions with the highest and the lowest content of motifs may indicate their involvement into
molecular mechanisms. The application of the correlational and quasi-periodic motifs to the subtyping of
viruses is close to the general discriminant genomic analysis with k-mers (Tomović et al., 2006; Ounit et
al., 2015).
The short-range correlations of 10–20 nt shown in the inserts to Figs. 3D and 4D facilitate the
molecular recognition of long motifs. The near-by positioning of the perfect and mismatch motifs
enlarges effectively the recognition region. The proteins bound to such region may consecutively
kinetically re-jump from mismatch to perfect motifs.
To sum up, TAMGI method developed in this article is quite general and can be applied to the
combined detection/reconstruction of correlational and quasi-periodic motifs in the genomic RNA/DNA
sequences. The method provides insight into mechanisms of evolving specific motifs in the genomic
sequences. Its scope of applications comprises numerous molecular mechanisms with participation of
both quasi-periodic motifs and complete repeats. The method can also be applied to the study of
correlations in the genomic sequences.
