ABSTRACT

1

In the opening months of 2020, COVID-19 changed the way for
which people work, forcing more people to work from home. This
research investigates the impact of COVID-19 on five researchers’
work and private roles, happiness, and mobile and desktop activity
patterns. Desktop and smartphone application usage were gathered before and during COVID-19. Individuals’ roles and happiness
were captured through experience sampling. Our analysis show
that researchers tend to work more during COVID-19 resulting an
imbalance of work and private roles. We also found that as working styles and patterns as well as individual behaviour changed,
reported valence distribution was less varied in the later weeks of
the pandemic when compared to the start. This shows a resilient
adaptation to the disruption caused by the pandemic.

A new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) broke out in Wuhan, China in
December 2019 [27]. Within three months of its outbreak, it spread
around the world and led the World Health Organization to declare it as global pandemic on the 11th of March [20]. In Victoria,
Australia, the state of emergency was declared on the 16 March
2020 [10]. The pandemic has changed the way we live our lives,
encouraging more people to work from home. This has impacted
the way that people work as well as their outlook on the world.
Understanding the individual’s behaviours during this crisis will
help to take steps to mitigate the shock of pandemic on people’s
lives. Therefore, this paper aims to provide insights on how the
COVID-19 lockdown impacted personal lives.
The pandemic offers a unique opportunity to investigate the
impact that working from home has on people, and the practical
effectiveness of it during and coming out of the pandemic. Although
there has been literature on teleworking and the impact of working
from home [7, 22], the pandemic is a unique situation. The emotions
of people in the pandemic need to be considered. This study fills
this gap by providing an analysis of the valence and arousal of
individuals as they start to work at home. This study analyzes how
life has evolved for individuals during this pandemic condition and
how their mood and physiological well-being was impacted by it.
This study looks into the effects of COVID-19 from three angles.
Firstly, it contributes to the literature of the psychological effects
of COVID-19 [16, 26] by looking into the effect that the pandemic
has had on the happiness and excitement of individuals before and
during the pandemic.
Secondly, it looks into how individuals’ social roles have been
impacted before and during COVID-19. Social role theory finds that
an individual follows different roles or social positions in life, which
have different expectations for their own behaviour [3]. Based on
the changed working environment due to COVID-19, this study
focuses on identifying how often an individual finds themselves
in a private or work related role, or a combination of the two. We
hypothesised that as the participants starting working from home
more, they would combine their work and private roles more often.
Finally, this paper looks at how valence, arousal, social roles
and app activity were impacted by COVID-19. It tries to determine
whether the pandemic caused more varied happiness, excitement
and computer usage than before COVID-19. And whether that

INTRODUCTION

behaviour varies less in the later weeks of lockdown. Moreover, we
investigate whether individuals’ behaviour adapt and change over
time to former established routines before COVID-19.
This paper uses the terms "before the pandemic" and "before
COVID-19" interchangeably. These refer to the time before the
WHO declared the pandemic on the 11th of March 2020[20], even
though COVID-19 was already in China when we were collecting
this data. The "lockdown" is referring to the lockdown in Victoria,
Australia, when the state of emergency was declared on the 16th of
March. "During the pandemic" refers to any time after the 11th of
March.
The research questions this study attempts to provide insight to
are
(1) Whether COVID-19 lockdown has an influence on the distribution of social roles the participants assumed. Particularly,
the combining of work and private roles.
(2) Did the introduction of COVID-19 correlate with a decrease
in the happiness distribution of individuals
(3) Did the introduction of COVID-19 correlate with a change
the length of the work day?
(4) Were behaviour patterns in valence, arousal, social roles and
app activity disrupted during COVID-19? Did they stabilise
as the weeks went on?
One of the main challenges with this research is acquisition of
similar data for the same individuals that allows for a fair comparison between behaviour before and during the COVID-19 pandemic
on a personal level. COVID-19 could not be anticipated and have
the data controlled in such a way. To accelerate our understanding
to the impact of the pandemic on the individuals, this study uses
a novel dataset. The dataset was collected through an application
installed on the participants’ computer and/or smartphone before
and during the lockdown. This allows for a comparison between
the behaviour of individuals before and during lockdown.
In summary the contributions of this research are as follows:
• An overview of the effect the lockdown had on the valence
distributions of individuals.
• A statistical significance test, fisher’s exact test is performed
to measure the impact of the lockdown on social role of a
person.
• For the first time identifies and analyses computer and phone
behaviour clusters during the pandemic situation.
• An exploration to how much the behaviour patterns of individuals in terms of valence, arousal, social roles and app
activity were disrupted during the lockdown.

2 RELATED WORK
2.1 Social Role Analysis
There has been several investigations into social role theory and
it’s impact on the way that we interact with computers. People
combine their work and private lives in different ways. Recently,
Anderson et al. contributed to this by looking into how social roles
can be inferred from ICT usage [2]. This is moving towards building
intelligent attention management systems, controlling when people
can be interrupted for tasks that relate to different social roles [1].

S. Nolan, et al.

2.2

Happiness Measurement

The literature on COVID-19’s impact on valence and individual lives
is still developing. Kleinberg et al has recently introduced a new
dataset1 collecting emotions of individuals expressed through texts
during COVID-19 [13]. Furthermore Zhang et al have investigated
the impact of COVID-19 in Wuhan, and call to pay attention to
the mental and physical impacts of those not affected by the virus
epidemiological [26].
Another source of COVID-19’s impact on individual happiness
comes from the Hedonometer. The Hedonometer is a way of attempting to measure the general happiness of the population by
observing the word usage of tweets [8]. This project found that
although the COVID-19 caused a large dip in happiness, over time
happiness has rebounded to be close to levels before COVID-19,
asides from the dip in happiness caused by the murder of George
Floyd and the consequent protests against police brutality. 2 . This
would hypothesise that although a dip in initial happiness may be
observed, over time, the impact on happiness would be negligible.

2.3

App Usage Behaviour

Many of the existing literature regarding app usage behaviour analysis focused on how people use the apps in their smartphones [9, 25].
These research suggested that mobile usage pattern of a person
contain many micro-usage e.g, locking or unlocking phones. Some
researchers worked towards predicting the next app which is more
likely to be opened by the user [11, 14]. Jones et al. tried to determine which smartphone apps encourage mobile phone usage
behaviour. The have analysed the revisiting patterns of different
apps for 165 users. They found that the app usage behaviour on
macro-level is technology independent [12].

2.4

Working from home

The effects of working from home and work-related mobile phone
usage in the after-hours have been investigated in the field of organizational psychology and work management. On the one hand,
positive effects on individuals’ well-being have been found when,
for example, work-related usage of mobile phones is in line with
their motivation and individual preferences[19]. Also, the possibility to meet demands from both domains – work and private – have
been shown to have positive effects on well-being, especially for individuals who like to integrate work and private-related matters[6].
On the other hand, adverse effects related to conflicts between work
and private domains[5] as well as on individuals’ well-being have
been reported – originating from the blurring of work and non-work
domains[17].

2.5

Remarks

Due to the pandemic, a large number of people are currently working from home which has impact on daily app usage patterns. The
social role and temporal patterns in app use are different than previous times. Being attentive to the feelings plays vital role in staying
healthy during this tough time. This study shed light on all of these
by analyzing the data during COVID-19.

DATASET DESCRIPTION

Among others, the dataset comprises information on application
usage, locations, social roles and valence and arousal ratings from
five participants. All the participants in the dataset are information
workers in Victoria, Australia. The data was collected using an
application that was installed on their computer and/or their smartphone. The application was developed by Uni Kassel, Germany. All
data was gathered with prior written permission from participants.
The first data collection took place from the 20th of January to the
26th of February 2020. The second data collection started during
COVID-19 – 17th of March to the 21st of May 2020. In the following,
we present details on the collected data.

3.1

COVID-19

ESM surveys

This application used Experience Sampling Method ESM and gave
a survey for the user to complete every 90 minutes that the user
was active on their devices. This survey asked:
• How happy were you feeling in the last hour? (Valence: Scale
from 1 to 5)
• How excited were you feeling in the last hour? (Arousal:
Scale from 1 to 5)
• What role you were fulfilling in the past 15 minutes? (Work,
Private, or Both)
These surveys were optional and were collected before the outbreak of COVID-19 and during the outbreak. A total of 488 and 436
surveys were gathered before and during COVID-19, respectively.

For the comparison in happiness and roles, only the surveys
of those who participated during and before the pandemic were
used. The number of survey responses that were before and during
COVID-19 from each participant is noted in Table 1. The histogram
of surveys collected during COVID-19 is illustrated in Figure 1. The
left group is the surveys collected before COVID-19 and the right
the surveys collected during.

Application usage

The application also recorded the application usage of the user.
Recording the application that is currently active and the time it
was opened for both smartphone and desktop.
This study filtered out windows utilities, (Desktop, start menu
etc), Android home screen, and applications that were only used
very little to make a dataset of over 174,000 records of usage of different applications over the time measurement period. The sample size
used for the analysis is noted in Table 2. These applications were

METHODS

Our methods involved first looking at an overall comparison between the survey responses before and during COVID-19 in section 4.1 and move into analysis of how COVID-19 disrupted valence,
arousal, social roles and app usage.

4.1

ESM Analysis

This study first compares the roles assumed by the participants.
The aim of this is two fold. Firstly, to determine whether the pandemic introduced a change in social roles. Secondly, whether the

Conference’17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA

S. Nolan, et al.

introduction of COVID-19 caused a caused the proportion of work
roles chosen each day to change.
We used Fisher’s exact test for the first comparison. Fisher’s exact
test is a statistical method of determining whether two variables
are independent or dependent of each other. It is particularly appropriate when the number of samples in the distribution is small[4],
which is true in our case and particularly for participant 2. The null
hypothesis of the test is that the two distributions are independent.
The Fisher’s exact test used to compare the dependence of two
variables, the amount a person chose a role, and whether or not the
participant was taking the surveys during the lockdown. Below is
a sample table shown for participant 1 for which Fisher’s exact test
was run.

To determine whether the amount of work done in a day changed,
we found the proportion that a user would choose a work role
(that is, Work or Work and Private). Then did a t-test to determine
whether these proportions changed before and during COVID-19.
Box plots were also used to show the distribution of data.
To determine if the mean of the valence distribution changed
before and during COVID-19, a t-test, which is a test to determine
whether the mean of two distributions are different, was deployed.
This test is to determine whether the average valence of each participant before and after COVID-19 changed.

4.2

Figure 2: An example of transforming a day of valence survey results to a vector
To determine how the valence, arousal and social role of a participant changed over the days before and during COVID-19, a
four dimensional vector was created for each day, where each element was the average value recorded in the surveys between hours
[9 − 12), [12 − 15), [15 − 18), [21 − 24) respectively, four three-hour
segments. We chose these time intervals as these were the times
that our participants were working.
The similarity matrix between each day for each of the ESM survey vectors was measured using Jaccard index, which is a popular
method of similarity measurement between two finite sets specifically for sets categorical variables [18]. It measures the similarity
between two sets by dividing the common number of features with
total number of available features. Jaccard distance is the inverse of
jaccard similarity which can be obtained by using the equation 1.
|A ∩ B|
Jaccard ′Dist(A, B) = 1 −
(1)
|A ∪ B|
As social role is a categorical variable, we compute Jaccard distance
to find the non-similar days of a user during different periods of
interest (before, 2 weeks after and 6 weeks after the pandemic
declaration).

Stability of features in COVID-19

One of our research question was to determine whether before
COVID-19, the app usage activity, happiness, excitability and social
role would be more consistent than the earlier days of COVID-19
and whether the early days of COVID-19 would be more varied
than the later days of COVID-19.
This study takes inspiration from Sadri et al[24] who tried to
predict the afternoon movements of individuals based off what they
did in the morning. They did this by determining how similar each
day was to all other days within the observed window of time. A
similar approach was taken in looking at how similar each day was
to each other day in different time periods.
This study investigates the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown
on these four variables. The first three were gathered in the ESM
surveys presented to the users:
First, valence. Valence was gathered by asking the happiness of
the individual. The valence is measured between 1-5.
Secondly, arousal. Arousal was gathered by asking participants
how excited they feel, and is also measured between 1-5.
Thirdly, social role. The social role was a categorical value of
"work" "private" or "work and private"
Finally, app usage. The app usage was correlated by segmenting
the data with IGTS (described below)

Figure 3: Process for ESM survey and Application usage analysis
Information Gain Temporal Segmentation [23] (IGTS) was applied
to segment the app usage time series into different activities that the
participant did throughout their day. IGTS is a method of segmenting multivariate times series by attempting to reduce the amount of
entropy in each individual segment. The method creates segments
that in total have the lowest entropy. IGTS was applied to each day

Exploring the Impact of COVID-19 Lockdown on Social Roles and Emotions while Working from Home

to discern the activities that were completed throughout the day. To
use IGTS, an appropriate value for the parameter k must be chosen.
k is the amount of splits to be found in each day (the amount of
segments is therefore k + 1). Including more segments increases
information gain. Information gain is the amount of entropy lost by
segmenting the time series. However, too many segments decreases
the size and interpretability of the segments found. So choosing a
k that finds a good balance between the interpretability and size
of clusters is important. The original IGTS paper offers a method
of finding the knee point in the information gain vs k curve. This
method was used over all the segments for all users for all days
and the median k was chosen for this analysis. The median k was
found to be 27. An example segmentation for a day is in figure 4.
IGTS was then applied over all the time series, giving a list of
segments for each user.

being assumed during the lockdown period in comparison to private
only and both work and private roles.

during COVID-19 pandemic. The rows indicate participants
and the left column is before COVID 19 and the right column

Figure 4: An example segmentation of a day’s app usage
We compare the similarities between days in terms of app usage using cosine similarity. Cosine similarity is measured based
on the dot product of two vectors. Thus, the angle between two
vectors is considered in measuring the similarity. Given two N

In our experiment, the vector of each day contains the information gain of each type of app usage in a segment. We considered
maximum activity of an app category in a segment. Considering
total 12 app categories and 28 segments, each vector contains 336
elements. We applied the pairwise cosine similarity on the vectors
corresponding to each day to identify the similar days of each user
based on app usage activity during different periods.

5 RESULTS
5.1 Work and Private Roles
The venn diagram in Figure 5 shows the proportions for which
participants found themselves in different roles. Participant 2 and 3
showed a large increase in the proportion of work roles assumed
during the lockdown. It also shows the heavily skewed work role

To determine whether the results shown in the Figure 5 were
significant, we used fisher’s exact test twice. The null hypothesis
for the first test is that the roles that an individual chose were
independent of whether COVID-19 is currently occurring. The p
values for this test are reported in Table 4. The null hypothesis for
the second test was that choosing a combined role over a separate
role was independent of the pandemic. The p values are reported
in Table 5.

As shown in Table 4, the pandemic had a significant impact on
the social roles specifically for participants 2 and 3. In Table 5, we
observe that only participant 3 had combined social roles significantly.

To investigate whether COVID-19 caused a change in the size of

the proportions of work assumed by each participant in a box plot

using t-test and are found in Table 6.

impacted by the lockdown and working from home. This, however,
only shows an aggregate analysis. Later, in section 5.4 we present an
analysis of the fine-grained changes in the distribution of valence
during lockdown.
Figure 7 shows the distributions of reported happiness for each
participant. Participant 1 and 3 are similar. Participant 2 shows
a difference in distribution, however, it is not significant because
Participant 2 did not have a large sample size of surveys during the
pandemic.

This shows that 2 out of 3 participants showed a significant
change in work, increasing the amount of work in a day during
COVID-19, and all participants increased the proportion of work
in their days. This confirms our hypothesis that the lockdown has
an influence on longer hours dedicated to work daily.

5.3

Valence

Next, We analysed whether the valence distribution significantly
changed during COVID-19 compare to before COVID-19 or not. A
t-test of independence was performed to compare the distribution
before and during COVID-19. The null hypothesis of the test was
that the distributions of scores given (before and during COVID-19)
have the same mean.
In Table 7, µ is the sample mean before COVID. σ is the sample
standard deviation before COVID-19. µ ′ is the sample mean during
COVID-19 and σ ′ is the standard deviation during COVID-19.
It was found that only one participant (again, Participant 3) had
a significant difference in reported happiness. This also shows that
for the majority of participants, there was not a significant change
in valence. This does not provide strong evidence that valence was

COVID-19 lockdown’s impact on behaviour

The next research question is how COVID-19 impacted the stability
of valence, arousal, social role and app usage. We are reporting
the behaviour distribution similarity for participant 1 (with his
associated desktop app usage) and participant 4 (with his associated
mobile app usage).
Figure 8 shows the similarity of valence, arousal, social roles and
desktop app usage day to day for Participant 1 including periods of
before, 2 weeks into and 6 weeks into the pandemic. The grey cells
represent days that we do not have data.
Figure 8 shows that for valence, this user reports much more
stable valence before the pandemic. Two weeks after the pandemic
declaration, the stability of the participant’s valence was affected,
causing it to change every two to three days. After four weeks, the
valence of the participant has seems to have stabilised, showing
large portions of time reporting similar distributions of valance
each day.

Figure 8: Similarity matrix for valence, arousal, social roles and app usage (columns left to right) of participant 1 before
COVID-19, 2 week into state of emergency, and 6 weeks into state of emergency (rows top to bottom)
Figure 8 also suggests that the participant’s arousal distribution
is highly varied during the weekend and early part of the week
before the pandemic. During lockdown, the participant’s arousal
distribution changed across different days, including weekdays and
weekends. In the third phase (third row shown in Figure 8), signifying sixth and seventh week into the lockdown, the arousal seems to
stabilise, however, around 11th May, the arousal distribution was
highly dissimilar. We found that this was the time when restriction
was loosened in Victoria, and up to five visitors were allowed first
time indoors and up to 10 outdoors. This potentially explains why
the valence on 10th May also shows a different distribution given
that the news was released this day.
Interestingly, the social role of the participant shows a large
amount of instability at 6 weeks after the pandemic declaration for
this participant. This could be caused by changing between work

and private roles as they are becoming accommodated to working
at home. This is especially interesting considering the charts do
not show a large change in stability before the pandemic and 2
weeks in. We can also observe similar behaviour in social role for
an another participants in Figure 9.
Figure 9 shows similarity matrices for participant 4’s survey responses and the mobile app usage distribution. The figure suggests
that the valence of the individual varied less in the later weeks of
the pandemic, along with the arousal. At the start of the pandemic,
the valence distribution was found to be different from day to day.
Six weeks into the pandemic, the behaviours had stabilised and
only changed on the Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday of each
week.
During the pandemic, participant 4 had more varied work and
private roles later in the pandemic than earlier in the pandemic.

DISCUSSION AND LIMITATIONS

This study found that the impact that the pandemic had on individuals varied.
For only one of three participants, we found that COVID-19
caused more combined work and private roles while working at
home. The study also indicates that the days become unstable in
terms of social role for some participants during the latter weeks
of lockdown. Beyond the scope of this study, this findings shed
light on to scheduling and productivity management research. A
tool that is capable in assisting individual’s work and private job
management while working from home can benefit people in being
more productive. There are a few works which have been devoted
to productivity assistance or inferring concentration level in open
work place [21]. In [15], the authors proposed a novel task recognition framework based on app usage for productivity assistant in
our daily life.
Furthermore, only one of the three had a significant impact on
happiness. Although the happiness varies in the beginning weeks
of the pandemic, the happiness of participants seem to stabilise in
the later weeks. This shows that the individuals were not impacted
in terms for COVID-19 as much as was hypothesised. Therefore,
working from home could be considered a viable alternative for
work as we come out of the COVID-19 pandemic.
This study is limited in the amount of participants and all from
the same occupation and we do not find significant evidence that the
COVID-19 lockdown impacted the work and happiness of the majority of participants in this study. This means that former methods

of helping the work of knowledge workers could also be effective
during COVID-19. This research however, does not have enough
participants to produce any generalisable findings.
This study discovers that during COVID-19 lockdown, all participants are involved in longer work hours. And it is also observed
that the distribution of valence, arousal, and the corresponding app
usage patterns are much highly varied during the early weeks of
lockdown in comparison to the latter weeks.
As of writing this paper, the pandemic within Australia and the
world is far from over. This methodology could therefore be used to
measure the impact that COVID-19 has coming out of the pandemic
and the future of work. While a larger sample of people participating
from a range of different professions and backgrounds is required
to measure the true impact of the pandemic, the methodologies
developed in this article could help in characterising the behaviour
patterns of individuals coming out of the pandemic.
The changing nature of the world we are currently living in is
an urge for new ways to think about the work that we do. Further
research could look into the effectiveness of working from home
for a variety of different occupations. Many novel technologies are
yet to come to assist people in continuing work from home as we
come out of the pandemic.
Another future direction of this study is predicting application
usage and human behaviour in times of crisis, instead of just exploring its effect. This would assist those who are transitioning to
work from home. Machine learning models and recommendation
systems can be developed further to support this type of research.

Exploring the Impact of COVID-19 Lockdown on Social Roles and Emotions while Working from Home

7

CONCLUSION

This study used a novel dataset to help get an idea of the individual
behaviour patterns of people during COVID-19.
This study found that the impact that COVID-19 had on social
roles and valence varied between participants. With the majority
of participants not showing a significant change in valence nor
assumed social role. Furthermore, this study finds that the valence
distribution of an individual stabilised over time while the different
social roles assumed by the individual increased, showing a resilient
adaptation during the lockdown.
We end this paper with an invitation for future research into
the effectiveness of more working from home studies during and
coming out of COVID-19, looking into improving the productivity
and well-being of individuals in these troubling times.
