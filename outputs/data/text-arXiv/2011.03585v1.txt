Abstract Purpose: Recently, the outbreak of the novel Coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has seriously endangered human health and life.
In fighting against COVID-19, effective diagnosis of infected patient is critical for preventing the spread of diseases. Due to limited availability of test
kits, the need for auxiliary diagnostic approach has increased. Recent research
has shown radiography of COVID-19 patient, such as CT and X-ray, contains
salient information about the COVID-19 virus and could be used as an alternative diagnosis method. Chest X-ray (CXR) due to its faster imaging time,
wide availability, low cost and portability gains much attention and becomes
very promising. In order to reduce intra- and inter-observer variability, during radiological assessment, computer aided diagnostic tools have been used
in order supplement medical decision making and subsequent management.
Computational methods with high accuracy and robustness are required for
rapid triaging of patients and aiding radiologist in the interpretation of the
collected data.

Method: In this study, we design a novel multi-feature convolutional neural
network (CNN) architecture for multi-class improved classification of COVID19 from CXR images. CXR images are enhanced using a local phase-based
image enhancement method. The enhanced images, together with the original
CXR data, are used as an input to our proposed CNN architecture. Using ablation studies, we show the effectiveness of the enhanced images in improving
the diagnostic accuracy. We provide quantitative evaluation on two datasets
and qualitative results for visual inspection. Quantitative evaluation is performed on data consisting of 8,851 normal (healthy), 6,045 pneumonia, and
3,323 Covid-19 CXR scans.
Results: In Dataset-1, our model achieves 95.57% average accuracy for a three
classes classification, 99% precision, recall, and F1-scores for COVID-19 cases.
For Dataset-2, we have obtained 94.44% average accuracy, and 95% precision,
recall, and F1-scores for detection of COVID-19.
Conclusions: Our proposed multi-feature guided CNN achieves improved results compared to single-feature CNN proving the importance of the local
phase-based CXR image enhancement. Future work will involve further evaluation of the proposed method on a larger size COVID-19 dataset as they
become available.

1 Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a newly discovered
coronavirus [1, 2]. In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. Up to now, more than 9.23 million
cases have been reported across 188 countries and territories, resulting in more
than 476,000 deaths [3]. Early and accurate screening of infected population
and isolation from public is an effective way to prevent and halt spreading of
virus. Currently, the gold standard method used for diagnosing COVID-19 is
real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [4]. The
disadvantages of RT-PCR include its complexity and problems associated with
its sensitivity, reproducibility, and specificity [5]. Moreover, the limited availability of test kits makes it challenging to provide the sufficient diagnosis for
every suspected patients in the hyper-endemic regions or countries. Therefore,
a faster, reliable and automatic screening technique is urgently required.
In clinical practice, easily accessible imaging, such as chest X-ray (CXR),
provides important assistance to clinicians in decision making. Compared to
computed tomography (CT) the main advantages of CXR are: Enabling fast
screening of patients, being portable, and easy to setup (can be setup in isolation rooms). However, the sensitivity and specificity (radiographic assessment
accuracy) of CXR for diagnosing COVID-19 is low compared to CT. This is
especially problematic for identifying early stage COVID-19 patients with mild

symptoms. This causes larger intra- and inter-observer variability in reading
the collected data by radiologists since qualitative indicators can be subtle.
Therefore, there is increased demand for computer aided diagnostic method
to aid the radiologist during decision making for improved management of
COVID-19 disease.
In view of these advantages and motivated by the need for accurate and automatic interpretation of CXR images, a number of studies based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown quite promising results. Ozturk
et al.[6] proposed a CNN architecture, termed DarkCovidNet, and achieved
87.02% three class classification accuracy. The method was evaluated on 127
COVID-19, 500 healthy and 500 pneumonia CXR scans. COVID-19 data
was obtained from 125 patients. Wang et al.[7] built a public dataset named
COVIDx, which is comprised of a total of 13975 CXR images from 13870 patient case and developed COVID-Net, a deep learning model. Their dataset
had 358 Covid-19 images obtained from 266 patients. Their model achieved
93.3% overall accuracy in classifying normal, pneumonia, and COVID-19 scans.
In [8] a ResNet-50 architecture was utilized to achieve a 96.23% overall accuracy in classifying four classes, where pneumonia was split into bacterial
pneumonia and viral pneumonia. However, there were only eight COVID-19
CXR images used for testing. In [9], 76.37% overall accuracy was reported on
a dataset including 1583 normal, 4290 pneumonia and 76 COVID-19 scans.
COVID-19 data was collected from 45 patients. In order to improve the performance of the proposed method, data augmentation was performed on the
COVID-19 dataset bringing the total COVID-19 datasize to 1,536. With data
augmentation they have improved the overall accuracy 97.2%. In [10], Contrast
Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) was used to enhance the
CXR data. The authors proposed a depth-wise separable convolutional neural network (DSCNN) architecture. Evaluation was performed on 668 normal,
619 pneumonia, and 536 COVID-19 CXR scans. Average reported multi-class
accuracy was 96.43%. Number of patients for the COVID-19 dataset was not
available. In [11], a stacked CNN architecture achieved an average accuracy of
92.74%. The evaluation dataset had 270 COVID-19 scans from 170 patients,
1139 normal scans from 1015 patients, and 1355 pneumonia scans from 583
patients. In [12], the reported multi-class average classification accuracy was
s 94.2%. The evaluation dataset included 5000 normal, 4600 pneumonia, and
738 COVID-19 CXR scans. The data was collected from various sources and
patient information was not specified. In [13] transfer learning was investigated for training the CNN architecture. The evaluation dataset included 224
COVID-19, 504 normal, and 700 pneumonia images. 93.48% average accuracy
was reported for three-class classification. The average accuracy increased to
94.72% if viral pneumonia was included in the evaluation. In [14], performance of three different, previously proposed, CNN architectures was evaluated for multi-class classification. With 2,265 COVID-19 images, the study
used the largest COVID-19 dataset reported so far. Average area under the
curve (AUC), for classification of COVID-19 from regular pneumonia, was 0.73
[14].

diagnosis from CXR.

Although numerous studies have shown the capability of CNNs in effective
identification of COVID-19 from CXR images, none of these studies investigated local phase CXR image features as multi-feature input to a CNN architecture for improved diagnosis of COVID-19 disease. Furthermore, except [14,
7], most of the previous work was evaluated on a limited number of COVID19 CXR scans. In this work we show how local phase CXR features based
image enhancement improves the accuracy of CNN architectures for COVID19 diagnosis. Specifically, we extract three different CXR local phase image
features which are combined as a multi-feature image. We design a new CNN
architecture for processing multi-feature CXR data. We evaluate our proposed
methods on large scale CXR images obtained from healthy subjects as well as
subjects who are diagnosed with community acquired pneumonia and COVID19. Quantitative results show the usefulness of local phase image features for
improved diagnosis of COVID-19 disease from CXR scans.

2 Material and methods
Our proposed method is designed for processing CXR images and consists
of two main stages as illustrated in Figure 1: 1- We enhance the CXR images (CXR(x, y)) using local phase-based image processing method in order to obtain a multi-feature CXR image (M F (x, y)), and 2- we classify
CXR(x, y) by designing a deep learning approach where multi feature CXR
images (M F (x, y)), together with original CXR data (CXR(x, y)), is used
for improving the classification performance. Next, we describe how these two
major processes are achieved.

2.1 Image Enhancement
In order to enhance the collected CXR images, denoted as CXR(x, y), we use
local phase-based image analysis [15]. Three different CXR(x, y) image phase
features are extracted: 1- Local weighted mean phase angle (LwP A(x, y)), 2LwP A(x, y) weighted local phase energy (LP E(x, y)), and 3- Enhanced local
energy attenuation image (ELEA(x, y)). LP E(x, y) and LwP A(x, y) image
features are extracted using monogenic signal theory where the monogenic

Title Suppressed Due to Excessive Length

signal image (CXRM (x,y)) is obtained by combining the bandpass filtered
CXR(x, y) image, denoted as CXRB (x, y), with the Riesz filtered components
as:
CXRM (x, y) = [CXRM 1 , CXRM 2 , CXRM 3 ]
= [CXRB (x, y), CXRB × h1 (x, y), CXRB (x, y) × h2 (x, y)]
Here h1 and h2 represent the vector valued odd filter (Riesz filter) [16]. α-scale
space derivative quadrature filters (ASSD) are used for band-pass filtering
due to their superior edge detection [17]. The LwP A(x, y) image is calculated
using:
P

sc CXRM 1 (x, y)
).
P
2
2
sc CXRM 1 (x, y) +
sc CXRM 2 (x, y)

LwP A(x, y) = arctan( pP

We do not employ noise compensation during the calculation of the LwP A(x, y)
image in order to preserve the important structural details of CXR(x, y). The
LP E(x, y) image is obtained by averaging the phase sum of the response vectors over many scales using:
LP E(x, y) = {

P

sc

|CXRM 1 (x, y)| −

p

2 (x, y) + CXR2 (x, y)} × LwP A(x, y).
CXRM

2

In the above equation sc represents the number of scales. LP E(x, y) image
extracts the underlying tissue characteristics by accumulating the local energy
of the image along several filter responses. The LP E(x, y) image is used in
order to extract the third local phase image ELEA(x, y). This is achieved by
using LP E(x, y) image feature as an input to an L1 norm based contextual
regularization method. The image model, denoted as CXR image transmission
map (CXRA (x, y)), enhances the visibility of lung tissue features inside a local
region and assures that the mean intensity of the local region is less than
the echogenicity of the lung tissue. The scattering and attenuation effects in
the tissue are combined as: LP E(x, y) = CXRA (x, y) × ELEA(x, y) + (1 −
CXRA (x, y))ρ. Here ρ is a constant value representative of echogenicity in the
tissue. In order to calculate ELEA(x, y), CXRA (x, y) is estimated first by
minimizing the following objective function [15]:
X
λ
k CXRA (x, y) − LP E(x, y) k22 +
k Wj ◦ (Dj ∗ CXRA (x, y)) k1 .
2
j∈χ
In the above equation ◦ represents element-wise multiplication, χ is an index
set, and ∗ is convolution operator. Dj is calculated using a bank of high order differential filters [18]. The filter bank enhances the CXR tissue features
inside a local region while attenuating the image noise. Wj is a weighting matrix calculated using: Wj (x, y) = exp(− | Dj (x, y) ∗ LP E(x, y) |2 ). In above

equation the first part measures the dependence of CXRA (x, y) on LP E(x, y)
and the second part models the contextual constraints of CXRA (x, y) [15].
These two terms are balanced using a regularization parameter λ [15]. After
estimating CXRA (x, y), ELEA(x, y) image is obtained using: ELEA(x, y) =
[(LP E(x, y)−ρ)/[max(CXRA (x, y), )]δ ]+ρ. δ is related to tissue attenuation
coefficient (η) and  is a small constant used to avoid division by zero [15].
Combination of these three types of local phase images as three-channel input
creates a new multi-feature image, denoted as M F (x, y). Qualitative results
corresponding to the enhanced local phase images are displayed in Figure
2. Investigating Figure 2 we can observe that the enhanced local phase images extract new lung features that are not visible in the original CXR(x, y)
images. Since local phase image processing is intensity invariant, the enhancement results will not be affected from the intensity variations due to patient
characteristics or X-ray machine acquisition settings. The multi-feature image M F (x, y) and the original CXR(x, y) image are used as an input to our
proposed deep learning architecture which is explained in the next section.

2.2 Network Architecture
Our proposed multi-feature CNN architecture consists of two same convolutional network streams for processing CXR(x, y) images and the corresponding M F (x, y) respectively. Strategies for the optimal fusion of features
from multi-modal images is an active area of research. Generally, data is
fused earlier when the image features are correlated, and later when they

architectures.

are less correlated [19]. Depending on the dataset, different types of fusion
strategies outperform the other [20]. In [21], our group has also investigated
early, mid, and late-level fusion operations in the context of bone segmentation from ultrasound data. Late-fusion operation has outperformed the other
fusion operations. In [22], authors have also used late-fusion network, for segmenting brain tumors from MRI data, has outperformed other fusion operations. During this work we design mid-fusion and late-fusion architectures
(Fig.3). As part of this work we have also investigate several fusion operations: sum fusion, max fusion, averaging fusion, concatenation fusion, convolution fusion. Based on the performance of the fusion operations and fusion
architectures, on a preliminary experiment, we use concatenation fusion operation for both of our architectures. We use the following network architectures
as the encoder network: Pretrained AlexNet [23], ResNet50 [24], SonoNet64
[25], XNet(Xception)[26], InceptionV4(Inception-Resnet-V2)[27] and EfficientNetB4 [28]. Pretrained AlexNet [23] and ResNet50 [24] have been incorporated into various medical image analysis tasks [29]. SonoNet64 achieved excellent performance in implementation of both classification and localization
tasks [25]. XNet(Xception)[26], InceptionV4 (Inception-Resnet-V2)[27] and EfficientNetB4 [28] were chosen due to their outstanding performance on recent
medical data classification tasks as well as classification of COVID-19 from
chest CT data [30, 31].

2.3 Dataset
We use the following datasets to evaluate the performance of proposed fusion
network models: BIMCV [32], COVIDx [7], and COVID-CXNet [12]. COVID19 CXR scans from BIMCV[32] and COVIDx [7] datasets were combined

to generate the ’Evaluation Dataset’ (Table 1). For Normal and Pneumonia
datasets we have randomly selected a subset of 2567 images (from 2567 subjects) from the evaluation dataset (Table 1). In total 2567 images from each
class (Normal, Pneumonia, COVID-19) were used during 5-fold cross validation. Table 2 shows the data split for COVID-19 data only. Similar split was
also performed for Normal and Pneumonia datasets. In order to provide additional testing for our proposed networks, we have designed a new test dataset
which we call ’Test Dataset-2’ (Table 3). The images from Normal and Pneumonia cases which were not included in the ’Evaluation Dataset’ were part of
the ’Test Dataset-2’. Furthermore, we have included all the COVID-19 scans
from COVID-CXNet [12].
In order to show the improvements achieved using our proposed multifeature CNN architecture we also trained the same CNN architectures using
only M F (x, y) or CXR(x, y) images. We refer to these architectures as monofeature CNNs. Quantitative performance was evaluated by calculating average
accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores for each class [9, 7].

3 Results
The experiments were implemented in Python using Pytorch framework. All
models were trained using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer, crossentropy loss function, learning rate 0.001 for the first epoch and a learning rate

decay of 0.1 every 15 epochs with a mini-batches of size 16. For local phase
image enhancement, we have used sc = 2 and the rest of the ASSD filter
parameters were kept same as reported in [15]. For calculating ELEA(x, y)
images we used λ = 2,  = 0.0001, η = 0.85, and ρ, the constant related
to tissue echogenicity, was chosen as the mean intensity value of LP E(x, y).
These values were determined empirically and kept constant during qualitative
and quantitative analysis.
Qualitative analysis: Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM)

regions of interest localized in the normal, pneumonia, and COVID-19 data.
Quantitative analysis of Evaluation Dataset: Table 4 shows average accuracy

A Box and Whisker plot is presented in Figure 5. In most of the investigated network designs M F (x, y)-based mono-feature CNN architectures outperform CXR(x, y)-based mono-feature CNN architectures. The best average accuracy is obtained when using our proposed multi-feature ResNet50
[24] architecture. All multi-feature CNNs with mid- and late-fusion operation compared with mono-feature CNNs, with original CXR(x, y) images
as input, achieved statistically significant difference in terms of classification accuracy (p<0.05 using a paired t-test at %5 significance level). Except SonoNet64 [25], XNet(Xception)[26], and InceptionV4(Inception-ResnetV2)[27], all multi-feature CNNs with mid-fusion operation compared with
mono-feature CNNs with M F (x, y) images as input show statistically significant difference in terms of classification accuracy (p<0.05 using a paired t-test
at %5 significance level). We did not find any statistical significant difference

4 Discussion and Conclusion
Development of a new computer aided diagnostic methods for robust and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 disease from CXR scans is important for improved
management of this pandemic. In order to provide a solution to this need, in
this work, we present a multi-feature deep learning model for classification of
CXR images into three classes including COVID-19, pneumonia,and normal
healthy subjects. Our work was motivated by the need for enhanced representation of CXR images for achieving improved diagnostic accuracy. To this
end we proposed a local phase-based CXR image enhancement method. We
have shown that by using the enhanced CXR data, denoted as M F (x, y), in
conjunction with the original CXR data, diagnostic accuracy of CNN architectures can be improved. Our proposed multi-feature CNN architectures were
trained on a large dataset in terms of the number of COVID-19 CXR scans
and have achieved improved classification accuracy across all classes. One of
the very encouraging result is the proposed models show high precision, recall,
and F1-scores on the COVID-19 class for both testing datasets. In addition,
except for AlexNet[23], all multi-feature CNNs with late fusion operation has
less number of parameters compared with corresponding multi-feature CNNs
with middle fusion operation (Figure 9). Since the image classifier of AlexNet
[23] is consist of three fully connected layers (fc), which store majority of parameters, AlexNet [23] with late fusion operation almost double the number of
parameters compared with middle fusion operation. The rest of networks have
only one or no fc layer in the image classifiers. Finally, compared to previously
reported results, our work achieves the highest three class classification accuracy on a significantly larger COVID-19 dataset (Table 6). This will ensure
few false positive cases for the COVID-19 detected from CXR images and will
help alleviate burden on the healthcare system by reducing the amount of CT
scans performed. While the obtained results are very promising, more evaluation studies are required specifically for diagnosing early stage COVID-19
from CXR images. Our future work will involve the collection of CXR scans

the design of a CXR-based patient triaging system.
