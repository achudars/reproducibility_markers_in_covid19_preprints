Abstract. Millions of people have enrolled and enrol (especially in the Covid19 pandemic world) in MOOCs. However, the retention rate of learners is notoriously low. The majority of the research work on this issue focuses on predicting the dropout rate, but very few use explainable learning patterns as part of
this analysis. However, visual representation of learning patterns could provide
deeper insights into learners’ behaviour across different courses, whilst numerical analyses can – and arguably, should – be used to confirm the latter. Thus,
this paper proposes and compares different granularity visualisations for learning patterns (based on clickstream data) for both course completers and noncompleters. In the large-scale MOOCs we analysed, across various domains,
our fine-grained, fish-eye visualisation approach showed that non-completers
are more likely to jump forward in their learning sessions, often on a ‘catch-up’
path, whilst completers exhibit linear behaviour. For coarser, bird-eye granularity visualisation, we observed learners’ transition between types of learning
activity, obtaining typed transition graphs. The results, backed up by statistical
significance analysis and machine learning, provide insights for course instructors to maintain engagement of learners by adapting the course design to not
just ‘dry’ predicted values, but explainable, visually viable paths extracted.

Introduction

Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) platforms (e.g., edX, Coursera, FutureLearn,
Udemy) offer vast amounts of virtual course materials. With easy access, especially
during the Covid-19 pandemic, MOOCs are the de facto platform for self-learning.
However, in spite millions of enrolments, the completion rate is usually less than
10%, [1]. Researchers have attempted early identification of likely dropouts, to allow
for interventional activities of course instructors. Existing studies [2, 3, 4, 5, and 6]
mainly employ machine learning and statistical analysis. However, few can provide
sound insights and explanations to course instructors regarding the learning manner of
participants [7]. Importantly, to the best of our knowledge, there is no prior work on
visually comparing the learning path of completers and non-completers for the entire
course session. This paper addresses the following research questions:

2
1. How can learning paths be visualised to differentiate between completers’ and noncompleters’ behaviour (to inform teachers for early interventions)?
2. Are there (significant) differences in the learning paths of completers and noncompleters and can they be deduced from visualisation early on in the course?
3. What kind of level of granularity is necessary for the visualisation of significant
differences between completers and non-completers?
The main contributions of this paper are:
• Providing new insights into early learning behaviour exhibited by course
completers and non-completers through bird-eye and fish-eye visualisation of
partial or full learning graphs, with different levels of information disclosure.
• Proposing visual graph analysis as a pre-step to machine learning and prediction, here illustrated by discovering linear or catch-up behaviours, which then
can be reliable predicted.
• Showing that theme-based visualisation (which also can be at bird-eye or fisheye level) detects other relations in the course, e.g. the effect of forums.

Related work

Existing studies on MOOCs analytics mostly focus on finding reliable completion
indicators from learner behaviour patterns, using data of forum activities[8], clickstreams [9], participants’ time spent and number of accesses [10], assignment activities [11] to name a few. Other predictive studies [12, 13, 14] attempt to forecast the
performance, including final grade and pass/fail in exams. Overall, existing research
usually does not disregard the potential in using visualisation as an initial step before
prediction, nor do they consider the granularity of visualisation as a factor.

2.1

Visualisation

The explanatory power of visualisation has been stated to be crucial to provide more
insights for module instructors and designers, next to completion prediction [7]. A
learning path is defined as the learning trajectory through a course by learners; according to [15], participants generally study web courses in a non-linear manner. We
are specifically interested in comparing the transition behaviour between completers
and non-completers, as suggested by [16]. [17] investigated the typical learning activity sequences across two MOOC datasets and mined the difference in learning
themes among groups with different grades, by visualising the theme distribution.
However, they mainly focused on which topics were more popular, instead of visualising the entire learning paths of their four groups of learners (none, fail, pass and
distinction). Later, [7] visualised log traces of learners across four edX MOOC datasets, using discrete-time Markov Models and observed that learners were more likely to jump forward than backwards from video content. Additionally, they found that
non-passing learners were more likely to exhibit binge video watching, i.e., transit
from one video to another without answering questions, deviating from the designed

3
linear learning path. However, they only visualised the video interaction activity of
passing and non-passing learners, instead of the whole learning sessions, like in our
work. Recently, [18] used visualisation software, Gephi, to visualise clickstreambased learning paths. They observed that learners are more likely to skip the quizzes
at the end of each chapter, by watching the beginning videos of the next chapter, but
learn linearly within chapters. However, neither did such previous studies explore the
phenomenon in-depth, nor provided a convincing explanation. This paper validates
that completers behave differently from dropout learners, by visualising the entire
learning paths of participants. We also implement machine learning models, to statistically analyse students’ movements, by combining courses’ themes and content.

2.2

Statistical Analysis

According to [19], statistical analysis can be divided into descriptive statistics, to
summarise the demographics information of learners and inference statistics, to
explore behaviours exhibited by participants. For instance, [20] firstly examined if
there is any impact on the behaviour of learners, after they reached the passing state.
They examine weekly quiz score distribution for all learners by K-means clustering,
which showed that early passers obtained relatively lower scores immediately after
passing, compared with their previous performance. Later, [21] investigated the
motivation of two groups of completers: university students and general participants,
using Mann–Whitney U test, and concluded that as participants’ ages increased,
earning a certificate was less significant. Recently, [22] explored different behaviours
of course completers and non-completers from a discourse perspective on course
content review, via a chi-square test. They found that completers were more likely to
post original and less negative opinions, whilst non-completers were more willing to
reply to and criticise others’ posts. Inspired by their work, we implement a Wilcoxon
signed-rank test for completers and non–completers to learn their transition
behaviours among different learning themes, separately. Additionally, we also apply
two machine learning algorithms for early completion prediction, based on our
analysis of two groups of student activities during the first week.

Methodology

To explore if completers and non-completers behave differently, we apply visualisation analytics firstly, to identify the different learning paths executed by these groups
and then implements statistical modelling to analyse their learning behaviour (transition from themes such as video, quiz, discussion, review and article) across different
courses. Additionally, by comparing dropout learners’ transition from different learning activities across different courses, the paper offers insights into the impact of the
designed course learning path on the learning behaviour of participants.

Dataset

The dataset of learner activities has been extracted from 8 runs of 4 Future Learndelivered courses from The University of Warwick between 2013 and 2017, with over
than 106,036 learners. Runs are defined as the number of repetitive teaching session
for each course. We investigate learner activities across different domains: Psychology (The Mind is Flat and Babies in Mind), Literature (Shakespeare and His World)
and Computer Science (Big Data). The over 1.5 million learner activities include
watching videos, taking a quiz, discussion, submitting assignments, viewing assignment feedback and reviewing another learner’s assignment and giving feedback.

Of all participants, 50230 learners have accessed at least one step of the course, but
over half, 53%, have never accessed the course after registration. The 42024 learners
who accessed less than 80% are defined as dropout learners. The 8206 learners who
accessed 80% or more of the materials in one run are defined as completers. The 80%
threshold (as opposed to, e.g., 100% completion) is based on prior literature discussing different ways of computing completion [23]. Completers represent 7% of the
total and 16% of the learners who accessed at least once.

Visualisation of High & Low Granularity Levels

After analysing the learning path of learners, we have divided the dataset of learners’
activities into two components: linear and catch-up (Figure 1). The former shows the
linear path between two sequential steps and the latter shows the catch-up activities,
i.e., jumping behaviour. The paper implements a flow network analysis, to present the
learning pattern for linear (source: xi-1, destination: xi) and catch-up (source: xi-1, destination ≠ xi). Depending on the granularity, the learning pattern is further identifiable
as bird’s eye view, i.e., high granularity (a node representing multiple steps), and fisheye view, i.e., low granularity view (step-level representations). In addition, course
activities have been grouped by different colours, based on their themes.

b) Catch-up activities

The size of the circle represents the number of learners who accessed the course content and the thickness of the arrow shows the percentage of learners’ movements.

Statistical Analysis and Machine Learning

We applied the Shapiro–Wilk test for normality check. For non-parametric data, we
applied the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for significance measurement of differences
between groups. We report results as percentages, instead of a total number of learners, to eliminate the effects of having different numbers of learners for each course.
To explore more on learners’ engagement with different learning themes, we also
build an early dropout prediction model based on the time spent on each activity, by
ensemble machine learning methods: Gradient Boosting [24] and XGBoost [25].

Results and Discussion

The flow network analysis shows that completers are more likely to complete the
courses linearly (Figures 4, 5), whilst non-completers are more likely to skip quizzes
and assessments (the catch-up learning pattern; Figures 2,3 which mainly show the
overall learning pattern instead of providing a clear view in details due to the course
length). For instance, non-completers have various learning paths; some of them may
directly jump to lessons in week two after accessing the first lesson (Figure 3). Instead, completers are much more “obedient”, as they mainly follow the designed
learning path, compared with dropout learners; interestingly, this holds true across
different domains - as the bird eye views in Figure 2 show. Statistical analysis results
in Table 2 further confirm that these learning paths are significantly different.

Then, we chart the percentage of learning transition from different themes for the two
learner groups (Figure 6). We compared dropout after their last accessed activity:
video, discussion, quiz and article for the four courses. The figure illustrates that
learners are more likely to drop out after articles and videos. Interestingly, participants drop out the least after discussion. The attraction of discussion has been confirmed by our statistical analysis across courses. The reason may be that participants
feel encouraged to share their knowledge and can gain support [26]. In the Literature
course, Shakespeare, participants were more likely to drop out after the assignment.
The reason may be the difficulty of the creative writing at the final week that learners
are required to write their film, book, ballet or musical; this is useful feedback for the
course designers to change assignments potentially. The figures also suggest that the
dropout patterns, according to themes are similar across runs.

b) second run

Furthermore, we predict the early dropout (dropout in first 10% of the course’s duration) of the four courses based on time spend on each activity via two machine learning algorithms. The higher indicator of dropout per video shown in Figure 6, the

8
higher prediction accuracy demonstrated in Table 3, which indicates video theme is
more predicable at an early stage of learning. For instance, the numbers of dropout
per video in the Mind is Flat, Babies in Mind, Big Data and Shakespeare four courses
in second run are: 65, 48, 47, 42 and the accuracy also follows this order.

To explore the relationship between learning themes at a macro, i.e. bird-eye level, we
visualise the catch-up transition behaviour for dropout learners (Figure 7; as most
completers transit from themes as designed).

Fig.7. Babies in Mind (left) & Big Data (right): catch-up themes transition, dropout learners

The most significant component, 25.9% and 24.12% of the participants continue from
videos to videos and switch from videos to articles in the Babies in Mind and Big
Data courses, respectively. The transition from videos to articles is 24.12% in the Big
Data course, i.e., nearly one-quarter of the dropout learners lose interests after reading
papers. Therefore, course designers should consider replacing some readings with
interactive activities, to improve engagement. Interestingly, 17.1% dropouts transfer
from quizzes to quizzes, which could be inefficient attempts to finish quickly. Such
behaviour can inform instructors to intervene early.

Conclusion and Limitations

The paper visualises and compares different learning paths of completers and noncompleters across four MOOCs, and explores from which learning theme learners
tend to drop out. We have shown how different granularity visualisation (fish eye,
bird eye) allows both researchers, and potentially teachers, to understand where issues
occur and where patterns emerge, backed up by statistical analysis. Specifically, we
have shown that course completers are more likely to learn linearly, while the dropout
learners are more likely to jump forward to a later activity, which we dubbed here as
“catch-up” learning pattern. Additionally, we find that video learning pattern is a

9
powerful indicator for early prediction of dropout for learners, validated by two machine learning models, XG Boosting and Gradient Boosting. Our research has shown
the benefits of theme-based visualisation, based on which we have identified that noncompleters are more likely to watch videos and skip quizzes, shown by their transition
from other themes, to videos. Moreover, we show how this type of analysis can generate fine-grained ideas for instructors and course designers; e.g., to improve retention, instructors (and online course designers) should introduce more discussion support mechanisms.
Limitations include clickstream analysis not entirely reflecting the true engagement of
learners with learning activities (as learners may, e.g., click the complete button too
soon). Additionally, we only consider the first access, due to our data limitations,
which may underestimate jumping patterns of dropout learners. Other learning features could be considered, e.g., length of activity accessed.
