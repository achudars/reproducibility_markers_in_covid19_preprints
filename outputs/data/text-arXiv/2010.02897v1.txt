Abstract The classic SIR model of epidemic dynamics is solved completely
by quadratures, including a time integral transform expanded in a series of
incomplete gamma functions. The model is also generalized to arbitrary timedependent infection rates and solved explicitly when the control parameter depends on the accumulated infections at time t. Numerical results are presented
by way of comparison. Autonomous and non-autonomous generalizations of
SIR for interacting regions are also considered, including non-separability for
two or more interacting regions. A reduction of simple SIR models to one variable leads us to a generalized logistic model, Richards model, which we use
to fit Mexico’s COVID-19 data up to day number 134. Forecasting scenarios
resulting from various fittings are discussed. A critique to the applicability
of these models to current pandemic outbreaks in terms of robustness is provided. Finally, we obtain the bifurcation diagram for a discretized version of
Richards model, displaying period doubling bifurcation to chaos.

famous SIR (Susceptible Infected Removed) and SIRD (plus Dead) systems
were developed by Sir Ronald Ross nearly a hundred years ago; see [2]. The
former entails the use of non-linear terms in the model expressions [3–5] with
the aim of describing interactions between S, I and R populations, together
with the introduction of obvious critical points at vanishing populations of
infected or susceptible individuals. Since the introduction of those models in
the past century, the possibility of establishing control mechanisms based on
predictions has been part of public health policies. The relevance of sufficiently
simple contagion dynamics of this kind cannot be underestimated, particularly
in recent times. There has been a continued interest in this subject as shown
by [6–8], but modern and ongoing research based on SIR models can be found
in [9–11].
Motivation It may appear at first sight that the required equilibrium points
for any sensible dynamical model of epidemics would impose non-linearities
which are insurmountable for an exact analysis. It is well known that some
qualitative features of the SIR models can be extracted from the defining equations themselves, but the precise evolution of populations in terms of known
functions necessitates explicit solutions. It is also desirable that the resulting
expressions be amenable to numerical evaluations to avoid the use of robust
numerical algorithms for multivariable first order problems. For our purposes,
it is important to know whether non-linearities hamper full integrability. Integrability in the sense [12] that there exist a sufficient number of integration
constants that allow separability of multivariable differential equations, which
is more general than the existence of explicit solutions. The lack of this quality
would relegate the study to numerically obtained flows and unpredictability
when the system is in a chaotic regime. Fortunately, in the context of SIR
models we will be able to show that the standard versions of SIR models allow separability and a reduction to quadratures (in mechanical systems, these
would be the integrals for periods or lapses). Moreover, we shall see that the
associated integral transforms allow evaluation under reasonable assumptions
and approximations. The integrability of these models is another motivating
factor to carry out future work in the direction of determining and designing
appropriate policies to ameliorate the effects of an epidemic.
Goals and results Separable systems fall into the category of integrable models. In this paper we shall address the conditions for separability in in the
aforementioned SIR model. It is sometimes mentioned [2] that either, explicit
solutions of SIR do not exist or they are unknown. We assert that this is not
entirely correct: we shall see from the full integrability of the model that a last
quadrature related to the lapse function or time interval can be found. The
latter is given in terms of known functions, and it solves the problem explicitly
in its entirety by reverse substitution into all previous expressions for population functions S, I and R. Incomplete gamma functions will appear in the
results. The only caveat here is that such lapse or period integral cannot be

Exactly solvable SIR models

put in terms of elementary functions and only an infinite series of them can be
offered. However, their form is sufficiently amenable for numerical evaluation.
In the realm of non-autonomous systems and the application of policies
in real time, we shall address a generalization of SIR with a sliding infection
parameter –e.g. controllable by quarantine– and show that this problem is
integrable as well if the total population is conserved and whenever the control
parameter of infection depends explicitly on accumulated cases of infection at
a given time. A generalization of SIR to interacting populations will be given
in this work and we will see that the number of separation constants does not
match the number of degrees of freedom and then, only in this case, we shall
have a lack of explicit solutions.
As an important application of our results, we shall address the problem
of curve fitting in the context of COVID-19 acquired data in the case of Mexico, during the year 2020. A simple generalization of the logistic model, the
Richards model, may capture the general behaviour of the accumulated infection curve, but errors in data acquisition may give rise to poor forecasting a
few weeks ahead; the stability of the system in terms of data uncertainties will
be studied numerically and analytically.
Structure of the paper In section 2 we present a self-contained formulation
of SIR and SIRD models, together with their variations in both solvable and
non-separable cases. In subsection 2.1 explicit solutions are presented, including a lapse integral in terms of gamma functions and equilibrium conditions.
Subsection 2.2 contains a treatment with variable infection rates. The case of
two interacting regions is discussed in 2.3 and in subsection 2.4 the general
case of many interacting regions and total distributions is presented. Section 3
is devoted to an application of Richards model to the case of Mexico’s Covid19
outbreak in the year 2020. In Subsection 3.1 the explicit solutions of the model
are presented, together with an analysis of robustness under data fluctuations.
Subsection 3.2 discusses the various forecasting scenarios resulting from curve
fittings to COVID-19 in Mexico. In Subsection3.3 we study the dynamics of a
discretized version of Richards model and in Section 4 we draw our conclusions.

2 SIR and SIRD models
The total population P (t) is a differentiable function that can be divided into
susceptible individuals S(t), infected individuals I(t) and removed individuals
R(t). It is assumed that I can infect others contained in S, but R is inactive.
This removed population may contain cured and dead cases as R = C + D,
where C and D are also considered inactive. It is also assumed that neither
sources nor sinks are present in P , so this quantity is conserved; some generalizations relax this supposition. In this manner, C and D are not part of the
dynamical system and they can always be recovered by a statistical treatment
of death percentage D = qR, C = pR such that p + q = 1. This leaves us with
SIR instead of SIRD. The velocity at which contagion occurs can be estimated

4

E. Sadurnı́, G. Luna-Acosta

in controlled (experimental) situations when a few members of the population
come into contact. For two individuals sharing a common space of a given radius the initial values R = 0, S = 1, I = 1, P = 2 start a process for which at
time ∆ti we end up with S = 0 and I = 2. Because of proximity, the quantity
∆ti is a function of population density. Since the new infected population is 2,
∆S = −1 and we have ∆S/∆ti = −1/∆ti ≡ −δ, so our new infection constant
is reciprocal to the infection time. This situation can be scaled to more infected and more susceptible individuals; if a number S0 shares the space with
I0 = 1, they will pass to the next category in the same time ∆ti and if more
infected individuals are active I0 > 1 the probability of contagion increases
proportionally. This establishes, in the limit of small time steps, the law
dS
= −δSI.
(1)
dt
The constant δ so defined can be corrected in experiments involving larger
populations. Similarly, the infected I suffer a change ∆I which comes from two
contributions: a depletion term due to removal (death or recovery) modulated
by some coefficient α in a time ∆tr which is proportional to I and a gain in a
time ∆ti controlled by a coefficient β which competes with the loss in S. We
have
dI
= βSI − αI.
(2)
dt
Finally, the removed population can be fed only from I, assuming there is
no preventive cure to turn S into R (specifically C) directly. Therefore, the
growth velocity of R is proportional to I with a constant γ also measured by
the reciprocal time of the removal process:
dR
= γI.
(3)
dt
Even in the case where the proportionality factors were unkown, the conservation of P = S + I + R forces δ = β, γ = α, as can be checked by adding
the expressions (1), (2) and (3) with dP/dt = 0. The analysis can be simplified by redefining the time scale, τ = βt, leading to only one effective control
parameter κ in the model, i.e.

R = S0 + I0 + R0 − I − S = R0 − κ log(S/S0 ).

(7)

To extract the time behaviour S(τ ), I(τ ), R(τ ) we eliminate I(R) in the third
relation of (4) using the second relation in (7):
I = I0 + (R0 − R) + S0 − S0 e(R0 −R)/κ = P − R − S0 e(R0 −R)/κ

Integral transform for the lapse function From the growth relation dR/dτ =
κI we know that if κ 6= 0 and I 6= 0 i.e., away from the trivial equilibrium point,
it holds that dR/dτ 6= 0 for all times in [0, ∞). As a consequence (9) defines
a monotonic invertible function and R(τ ) can be recovered. Furthermore, the
integral transform in (9) can be calculated in two regimes: κ < 1 and κ > 1.
If κ < 1, then e(R0 −X)/κ < 1 as here X > R0 . A geometric expansion of the
integrand is viable and obtains

where we use κβ = α, c.f. Eq. (5). This states that as ∆t → ∞, R → P ≡ Rmax
and all the population P is transferred to the removed state, as expected from a
large infection rate β. On the other hand, if κ > 1, then ζ ≡ |e(R0 −X)/κ −1| < 1
by expanding the exponential. In this case, a geometric series in ζ is plausible,
and (9) leads once more to exponential integrals conforming a series of gamma

(12)

To lowest order (e(R0 −X)/κ ∼ 1), both, Eq.(8) and (9) yield
R = R0 + I0 (1 − e−α∆t )

(13)

which implies R → R0 + I0 at infinity, a less drastic behavior than than the
previous case (11). To further distinguish between these cases, we note that
κ also represents the susceptible population needed to reach the maximum
infection, as can be inferred from the vanishing derivative in (4). This means
that κ  1 in realistic models, where infection peaks take place and S  1
simultaneously.
Equilibria Before treating the case of jumping values of κ during a controlled
outbreak, it is important to recall the critical behaviour of the involved quantities. From (4) we see that the infection peak occurs when S = κ, and if we
use (7) the peak value Imax results in
Imax = I0 + S0 + κ (log(κ/S0 ) − 1)

(14)

which is meaningful when I0 + S0 ≥ κ (log(S0 /κ) + 1) (this is always the case
if P is large). If κ = S0 then Imax (min) = I0 + S0 − S0 = I0 and the peak
occurs trivially at the initial condition. On the other hand, as κ increases, the
function Imax (κ) decreases when κ < S0 ; indeed, if the susceptible number S
decreases with the dynamics, S0 is larger than the critical population S = κ
and from (14) we find that the last two terms are negative, reducing the value
of Imax (κ) and explaining the famous curve flattening.
In order to recover the total deaths we look now at R → R∞ as ∆τ → ∞.
By direct time integration (see Eq.(4)) , we have

Eq. (14) shows that I(τ ) depends on κ; hence R∞ is also κ-dependent.
From the definition of κ = Eq. (5) and the meanings of α and β, modification

Exactly solvable SIR models

of either β (by changing quarantine duration) or α (vaccine or cure) has an
important effect on the total number of deaths D∞ = qR∞ .
Remark 1: It can be shown, using (14) and (15), that the artificial
acceleration of infection (increase of β, thus decrease of κ) increases the final
number of total deaths.
Remark 2: The quantity R∞ can also be estimated from the final equilibrium point I∞ = 0 by solving I0 + S0 + κ log(S∞ /S0 ) − S∞ = 0 for S∞ and
substituting its value in R∞ = R0 − κ log(S∞ /S0 ).
A sequence of control parameters Suppose now that a new value κ0 is achieved
at t = tf for all times in [tf , ∞). The previously computed quantities undergo
a modification
Imax = I(tf ) + S(tf ) + κ0 (log(κ0 /S(tf )) − 1).

(16)

A piecewise definition of κ consists of a set of constants {κn } at intervals
[tn , tn+1 ]. Then, new predictions are obtained for the dreadful Imax :
Imax (n + 1) = I(tn ) + S(tn ) + κn (log(κn /S(tn ) − 1)
= P − R(tn ) + κn (log(κn /S(tn ) − 1).

(17)

Suppose now that In = I(tn ) < Imax (n) for a sufficiently large tn , i.e. at least
one peak has already occurred. The condition for the emergence of a new peak
of comparable proportions Imax (n + 1) > In is then
Imax (n + 1) ∼ Imax (n) = In + Sn + κn (log(κn /Sn ) − 1)
= In−1 + Sn−1 + κn−1 (log(κn−1 /Sn−1 ) − 1)

(18)

with Sn ≡ S(tn ) and Sn + κn (log(κn /Sn ) − 1) > 0. Using the total population
P = Sn + In + Rn = Sn−1 + In−1 + Rn−1 in the relation above, the removed
differential ∆R = Rn − Rn−1 is shown to satisfy
∆R = κn [log (κn /Sn ) − 1] − κn−1 [log (κn−1 /Sn−1 ) − 1] .

(19)

The new parameter κn is then given in terms of the old parameter and the
death differential ∆D/q. This quantity represents a comparison between consecutive regimes with infection peaks, and ∆D > 0 implies worse scenarios
in the evolution. In order to understand the effect of κ on D, let us define
x = κn−1 /Sn−1 , x0 = κn /Sn , such that
∆D/q = Sn x0 (log x0 − 1) − Sn−1 x(log x − 1) ≡ Sn f (x0 ) − Sn−1 f (x). (20)
From the dynamical equations, dS/dt < 0 regardless of κ, so we infer Sn−1 >
Sn and we may bound ∆D from below as

8

E. Sadurnı́, G. Luna-Acosta

∆D/q > Sn [f (x0 ) − f (x)] = Sn ∆ [f (x)]

(21)

∆D/q > Sn−1 [f (x0 ) − f (x)] = Sn−1 ∆ [f (x)]

(22)

if f (x) < 0, and

if f (x0 ) < 0. In the remaining case where both f (x) > 0, f (x0 ) > 0, then
necessarily x > e and x0 > e, so the infection is either too weak (large κ)
or we are at the end of the outbreak (small S), which is not interesting for
our analysis. In order to estimate ∆D in the previous cases, it suffices now
to study the sign of ∆f in the inequalities above. We have x, x0 ∈ (0, e),
thus f (x) < 0, f (x0 < 0) and f decreases in (0, 1), while it increases in (1, e).
Therefore ∆f > 0 if x0 < x < 1 or if 1 < x < x0 < e. The first possibility yields
1 > κn−1 /Sn−1 > κn /Sn > κn /Sn−1 and so κn < κn−1 < Sn−1 as expected,
i.e. a smaller κ worsens the infection. However the second pòssibility obtains
eSn > κn > Sn κn−1 /Sn−1 , which represents a failed quarantine unless κn
grows beyond eSn , despite being bounded below by κn−1 .
2.2 One spatial region with time-dependent control parameters
More realistic models of variable social behaviour can be studied. A nonautonomous system with κ = κ(τ ) can be proposed and solved explicitly
in some cases. From the conservation of P , we are always left with a twocomponent system, as R is a redundant function of S and I:
dS
= −SI,
dτ

dI
= [S − κ(t)] I.
dτ

(23)

As we saw before, it is always possible to re-parameterize using one of the SIR
variables. For example, let our new time T be the monotonically increasing
area under the curve I with time t as independent variable. For constant κ
this would be tantamount to parameterizing the dynamics with R alone. We
have

An iteration scheme can be applied to any non-autonomous model for general

The remaining problem here is to find explicitly the function T (τ ) or its inverse.
Non-linear, second order equation for lapse We expect T (τ ) to be governed
by a non-autonomous equation, expressing that such kind of systems are not
always separable, despite the fact that the existence of solutions is guaranteed
by the Picard iterative method. The non-linear, non-autonomous equation
for T (τ ) can be obtained by differentiating with respect to τ the following

This equation results from the application of the chain rule and the second
relation in (27). It is easy to see that for constant κ, (29) reduces to a separable
equation whose quadrature coincides with (9).
Quadrature Let us solve (29) by separation of variables. Here it is important
to note that κ(τ ) is assumed to be prescribed but, in contrast, κ(T ) needs
the function T (τ ). We might think, however, that the application of some
health policy rests on the knowledge of accumulated infections at time τ ,
which entails the use of κ(T ) instead of κ(τ ) as a specified control parameter.

Fig. 2 Evolution with piecewise κ parameter, S(t) blue, I(t) red and R(t) gold. For a
removal time ∆tr of 7 days, the time scale correpsonds to weeks. Between 0 and 2 weeks,
κ−1 = 4 × 10−3 , displaying strong infection. In weeks 2 to 5, a measure is applied κ−1 =
1 × 10−3 , but from week 5 it is again relaxed to κ−1 = 4 × 10−3 . A revivial in I is visible
around week 7 and the number R∞ / P .

Comparisons In fig. 1 we show the SIR evolution in weeks. The evolution of the
dynamical variables were obtained by numerically integrating Eqs.(1) to (3)
and their behavior is consistent with our analytical expressions. A reasonable
recovery time is 7 days, so 1/γ = ∆tr defines our time scale (for COVID19 it is two weeks [16]). In compliance with [17], numbers around 90 to 100
infected per 105 inhabitants are reported as world averages; these are used in
our simulations: we take as initial conditions S0 = 105 , I0 = 102 , R0 = 0 in all
cases. We illustrate in panels (b) to (d) the fact that the asymptotic R∞ , S∞
are particularly sensitive to variations of κ. In fact, the area under the curve
I is not constant with κ, as shown in (a) by plotting R.
In fig. 2 we show the temporal evolution of S, R, and I when κ also depends
on time as a piecewise constant parameter and compare it with the temporal
evolution of S, R, and I when κ is constant throughout the whole epidemic.
∆ti

Recalling that κ = ∆t
β , an increase in κ may be due to: i) Increase in
r
the removal rate α (i.e, a shorter time to recover) by, for example, improving
the medical treatment at early stages or to a quicker time to die, due to
perhaps some change in the environmental conditions, or ii) a decrease in the
infection rate (β), by imposing a quarantine policy, for example. The first
two weeks show a quickly evolving outbreak with κ−1 = 4 × 10−3 , until a
policy is applied, increasing κ by a factor of 4. From weeks 2 to 5 the infection
curve seems under control, but a relaxed regime starting at week 5 is capable
of generating a new peak in I. The revival occurs around week 7, and as a
consequence, the asymptotics R∞ increase D∞ assuming constant q. Thus, the

12

E. Sadurnı́, G. Luna-Acosta

effect of increasing κ from week 2 week 5, reduces notably the infection peak
at the expense of a second milder regrowth and an increase in the duration of
the epidemic. At the end the quarantine the removed population decreases by
about a half, implying a drastic reduction in the number of deaths at the end
of fifth week. However, right after week 5, the removed population picks up
again and asymptotically it is only about 10 per cent smaller than the case of
a constant κ throughout the whole outbreak. Fig. 2 also shows that the effect
of a quarentine depends on the initial and final date of its application.

2.3 Two interacting regions
When two regions come into contact by the exchange of susceptible and infected individuals, two species i = 1, 2 of quantities Si , Ii , Ri must be considered. It is reasonable to assume that infections between populations of separate
regions are not possible, i.e. S1 → I2 and S2 → I1 are forbidden processes.
However S1 ↔ S2 and I1 ↔ I2 are plausible exchanges. There are two types of
migratory trends that can be studied: the depletion of one population into the
other and oscillatory dynamics between regions. It is important to note that
in the limit of perfect isolation each set of SIR functions evolves as dictated
by (4). On the other hand, in the limit of negligible infectious rate, the system should decouple into independent migratory subsystems S1 , S2 , I1 , I2 and
possibly R1 , R2 if removed patients are all recovered and allowed to travel. As
before, the total population is conserved here, but the condition now reads
P1 + P2 = P , with Pi = Si + Ii + Ri .
The simplest way to take into account these considerations is by introducing an interaction term in our dynamical system
dS2
dS1
= −S1 I1 + F (S1 , S2 ),
= −S2 I2 + G(S1 , S2 ),
dτ

= (S1 − κ1 )I1 + J(I1 , I2 ),
= (S2 − κ2 )I2 + K(S1 , S2 ),
dτ
dτ
dR1
dR2
= κ1 I1 ,
= κ2 I2 .
dτ
dτ

(33)

The functions F, G, J, K must comply with conservation of P and, in the
absence of infection, the conservation of S = S1 + S2 , I = I1 + I2 and R =
R1 + R2 . Therefore, F = −G and J = −K. The change of partial populations
is thus dP1 /dτ = F + J = −dP2 /τ .
Autonomous vs non-autonomous interaction Now we distinguish two important cases: Autonomous (time-independent) interaction and non-autonomous
(ad hoc) external signal. In the first case we have two subcases, namely a)
logistic-type depletion and b) harmonic behaviour.
For a) the interactions are

Exactly solvable SIR models

13

F = λ(S1 − σ)(S2 − σ)Θ(S1 S2 ),

J = Λ(I1 − Σ)(I2 − Σ)Θ(I1 I2 ), (34)

with λ and Λ the intensity parameters given by the migration rate. The quantities σ and Σ are critical points of the isolated migration model, associated
with equilibrium populations. Θ is the Heaviside step function, which prevents
the undesired result Si , Ii < 0 for any τ .
For the subcase b), a harmonic motion can be achieved by employing
p

|S1 − σ||S2 − σ| Θ(S1 S2 ),
p
J = Ω Sg [(I1 − Σ)(I2 − Σ)] |I1 − Σ||I2 − Σ| Θ(I1 I2 ),

F = ω Sg [(S1 − σ)(S2 − σ)]

(35)

where ω and Ω are the frequencies and Sg is the signum function. That this
is so, can be inferred from a simple change of variable in typical the harmonic
2
2
2
system ẋ = ωy, ẏ = −ωx,
p where x + y is constant. Indeed, X = x and
2
Y = y leads to Ẋ = 2ω |XY | = −Ẏ .
When the interactions are modelled by external “signals”, a subcase b) can
also be considered. Oscillations can be treated with

F =

a
cos(ω∆τ ),
ω

J=

A
cos(Ω∆τ ),
Ω

(36)

where a, A are oscillation amplitudes.
Remark 3. External signals such as (36) or damped signals with factors
e−Γ ∆τ are useful for reproducing revivals. Bimodal curves for Ii indicate cycles
of infection parameterized by the frequency Ω.
Remark 4. Interacting models such as (35) display rigidity for critical
frequencies. A variety of numerical methods based on Runge-Kutta algorithms
diverge at finite times.
Remark 5. The total population of two interacting regions does not
behave as a full SIR, even in the absence of migration or exchange. Under the
change of variables S = S1 + S2 , I = I1 + I2 , R = R1 + R2 , s = S1 − S2 ,
i = I1 − I2 , r = R1 − R2 , K = (κ1 + κ2 )/2, κ = (κ1 − κ2 )/2 the system (33)
picks effective interactions. The large system is

2 × 103 = I2 (0), S1 (0) = 105 = S2 (0), R1 (0) = 0 = R2 (0). The damping for population
i = 1, 2 is given by Γi .

Results For regions interacting with autonomous harmonic terms such as (35),
we can show that the infection peak can display anomalous behaviour in different scenarios. The typical outbreak with initial conditions S1 (0) = 105 =
S2 (0), I1 (0) = 102 = I2 (0), R1 (0) = 0 = R2 (0) is shown in Fig. 3 panel (a).
There we see a shoulder in the infection curve (black thick line) and an anomalous revival in the second susceptible population (blue thick line) whereas in
panel (b) another set of initial conditions S1 (0) = 100 = S2 (0) = I1 (0) =
I2 (0), R1 (0) = 0 = R2 (0) describes the situation once the pandemic has been
run until S and I are comparable. In such a case we also see an infection
peak with a shoulder (black thin line) for the first population, but a drastically decreasing I2 (t) (black, thick line). A more conspicuous oscillatory effect can be achieved by non-autonomous terms in (36): The results in fig. 4

show an infection curve with notorious damped oscillations for parameters
I1 (0) = 2 × 103 = I2 (0), S1 (0) = 105 = S2 (0), R1 (0) = 0 = R2 (0). The frequencies are ω = Ω = 1/3 (in units of γ). For the second type population,
an infection curve with multiple “humps” in thick black is visible. Lastly, the
results of a migratory depletion model in (34) are displayed in fig. 5. The difference between panels (a) and (b) comes from a larger migration rate for (b),
albeit the use of similar initial conditions. As a result, the infection curve for
population 1 (black thin line) has a larger peak in (b), in compliance with a
migratory trend from region 2 to 1.

2.4 Total distributions
Our previous remark establishes that separate regions produce a non-trivial
joint effect even when they are isolated. Also, in the presence of migration,
the evolution of total SIR populations of a country or large region unfolds
differently as compared to non-interacting regions.

Uncorrelated case Let us suppose that during an outbreak a set of disconnected regions evolve under different, uncorrelated, conditions. The resulting
individual curves will have similar shapes but dfferent time shifts and peak
intensities. For example, the infection processes could have different starting
points, different initial conditions and varying values of κ. It is then natural
to consider a full distribution made of individual populations with a weight
factor W given by the local population fraction (e.g. France in the world:
(6.699 × 107 )/(7.8 × 109 ) = 8.588 × 10−3 ). Using a monotonic parameterization of such weight W (a), a ∈ [0, 1] one has

The integration has a smoothing effect in global measurable quantities. For
instance, in a strict quarantine, the resulting curve for world populations in
major scale events (see COVID-19 in [17]) has a regular behaviour in limited
time windows, as if modelled by a global SIR with effective κ. However, each
region has a distinct behaviour governed by a local κ and entirely different
sets of curves. With this, we would like to stress that the practice of performing a posteriori curve fitting does not necessarily validate the correctness of
dynamical models locally.

Note that the second and third relations contain t and not τ in the limit.
Once more we recall here that the absence of infection reduces to a model
of circulation with conserved quantities SIR. More detail can be introduced
if a is replaced by coordiantes r and Fa,a0 , Ia,a0 are replaced by generalized
distributions containing ∇r δ (3) (r − r0 ), ∂ri ∂rj δ (3) (r − r0 ), and so on, which give
rise, upon integration, to local operators such as ∇, ∇2 etc. From here we may
obtain as special cases the diffusion equations and continuity conditions in the
form of Fick’s law.

3 Reduction to logistic models with applications to current
outbreaks
The logistic model and its generalizations are useful in the description of
growth for many applications, including biology. Phenomenological uses were
originally proposed by Richards [18], based on historical discussions by Gompertz [19] and previous work by Von Bertalanffy [20, 21]. Such logistic functions can be viewed as a particular reduction of SIR models to a single variable, i.e. the accumulated population A, which is the time integral of I under
the condition P = S + I. This corresponds to the situation “once infected, always infected”. The reduction gives rise to an integrable model by quadrature.
Moreover, it allows to integrate the flow in terms of elementary functions for
a variety of non-linear systems that generalize the autonomous logistic equation. One of our aims here is to see how capable is the model, with constant
parameters throughout the whole outbreak, to give reasonably good fits to the
data and to express the model’s sensitivity to parameter variations and data
fluctuation; particular attention shall be paid to the total number D and its
fluctuations. This can be easily done with analytic solutions at our disposal.
Richards’ model for the accumulated number of infected population A is
defined by the flow
dA
a
= F (A; r, α, K) ≡ rA [1 − (A/K) ]
dt

(42)

where the accumulated population A is given in terms of new infections Inew
Z t
A(t) ≡
dt0 Inew (t0 ).
(43)
t0

The parameters are r: modulation of the infection rate, K = A∞ : final accumulated count of infected population , and a plays the role of recovery coefficient;
the larger a is the faster the infection ends. The parameter a also determines
the asymmetry of the curve of the daily new infections: – e.g. a = 1 corresponds
to a symmetric curve around A = K/2 – with fixed points A = 0, A = K. The
allowed values of the parameters are determined by the existence of such fixed
points; we have r > 0, a > 0 and r < 0, −1 < a < 0, satisfying the condition
ra > 0. In particular, a ∈ (−1, 0) generalizes the standard logistic map, where
a = 1.
3.1 Exact solutions, constant parameters
Assuming constancy of the paramters r, a, K, the autonomous system has solutions of the form

.

(45)

Robustness, data fluctuations It is straightforward to compute the fluctuations
in the predictions of final accumulated numbers of infected patients. The problem of interest is to analyze the error in forecasting due to bad data at a given
time. Assuming that such statistical error at time ∆τ is δA, then the constant
K changes to K + δK. To see this, one simply solves for K in (45) as a function of A and τ and proceeds with the partial variation of A as independent
variable, according to

K(A + δA; τ, a, A0 , ...) = K(A; τ, a, A0 , ...) +

∂K(A; τ, a, A0 , ...)
δA + ...(46)
∂A

Since A → K as τ → ∞, we expect δK → δA∞ , as can be verified explicitly.
Small errors in data produce then the variation

δK = δA

Aa0

A0 (e−a∆τ − 1)1/a
=
δA
, (47)
Aa0 − Aa e−a∆τ Aa0 − Aa e−a∆τ
A Aa0 − Aa e−a∆τ

where the first fraction has been identified as the function K(A, A0 ) obtained
from (45). Expression (47) supports the concept that final predictions have
different sensitivities at different times. For example, the variation on K due
to a variation (bad data) of A at δτ very large (that is, near the end of the
∞
pandemic) is easily seen to be δK = K δA
A∞ = δA∞ , a negligible amount. In
contrast, if the variation occurs at early times (∆τ ≈ 0) then the impact on the
prediction for K is δK = δA0 AK0 , which can be very large even if δA0 is small.
Since this expression for δK is a monotonously decreasing function of time,
the errors due to bad data at some time t gradually become less important as
t increases.

3.2 Examples of curve fitting and forecasting with Richards model
Here we try Richards model to fit Mexico’s COVID-19 data [22] for forecasting
and as an illustration of the sensitivity to small variations in data, obtained at
various times. See also [23]. First we obtained analytical expressions for relevant quantities, such as time of peak infections, number of daily new infections
at its peak, etc.
Integration of (42) with initial condition A0 gives
ln(B0 /Bt ) = ar(t − t0 ),

(48)

B(t) = (K a − A(t)a )/A(t)a .

(49)

where

Exactly solvable SIR models

19

Solution A(t) =(45) follows from (48). It is interesting to determine the
time tp at which the speed of infection reaches its peak.This occurs when
F (A; r, a, K) reaches its maximum value, i.e, when ∂F
∂A = 0:
Ap = A(tp ) =

(1 + a)1/a

(50)

It follows that
B(t = tp ) ≡ Btp = a.

(51)

1
ln(B0 /a).
ar

(52)

Hence,
tp = t0 +

Note that the term (1 + a)−1/a in eq.(50) is a monotonically increasing
fiunction of a, growing 0 at a = −1, reaching 1/e at a = 0 and approaching
1 at a → ∞ . The quantity (1 + a)−1/a can be roughly approximated by the
straight line 1e + e−2
2e a. So Ap grows roughly linear with a. Note that (50) limits the range of a to [−1, ∞) and, complementary, (52) indicates that negative
values of a are allowed provided r is negative simultaneously with a. Also note
that there is no problem with a being negative in the expression for tp = (52)
since B0 automatically becomes negative as a becomes negative
It is also useful to determine the temporal evolution of daily new cases. In
particular, we wish to know, for a given set of values of (a, r, K) when and what
is the highest number of daily new cases. This information can be obtained
numerically using the solution (42) and computing ∆A(t) = A(t) − A(t − 1).
It can also be obtained by noting that ∆A(t) = ∆A(t)
∆t ≈ Ȧ = F (A(t); a, r, K),
where ∆t = 1. This approximation is excellent since the function A(t) is very
smooth for all t. For the particular time t = tp the value F (A(tp ); a, r, K) =
rAp (1 − (Ap /K)a ) gives the maximum increase in daily new cases and can
readily be obtained using (50):
∆A(tp ) = raAp /(1 + a) = rKa/(1 + a)1+1/a ≈ rKa/4.

(53)

The fitting parameters (a, r, K) of solution (45) depend on the choice of
precision of the fitting and on the number of data used to perform the fitting.
Fitting precision is controlled by the maximum number of iterations M given
as an input in a subroutine that incorporates the method of least squares.
Increasing M improves the fitting up to a certain value M , after which the
values of the parameters remain almost unchanged, according to a prescribed
tolerance. Numerically we found M = 1150. Since the data are not very reliable
due to various factors, such as the lack of actual laboratory testing in all
suspected cases and the delay of gathering daily data, it is not indispensable
to make as precise a fitting as possible. In this context, we may regard various
different fitting precisions as possible different epidemic scenarios.

Table 1 Fitting parameters and predictions including negative values of a and r. Here and
elsewhere ni (nf ) is the initial (final) day of the fitting data
.

In what follows we shall fit the solution (45) of Richards model to the data
of cumulative number of infected people of COVID-19 in Mexico (data gathered from [17] www.worldometers.info/coronavirus). The first case of infection
was detected on February 28, 2020, the day number 1. Table 1 shows the values
of parameters (a, r, K) and the predictions tp , Ap , and ∆Ap, obtained from 8
representative fittings for two sets of data; one from day 1 till day 118 (June
24, 2020); the second from day 1 till day 134 (July 10, 2020).
The first four fittings (I+ , I− , II+ , II− ) used the data of the first set and
the last four cases (III+ , III− , IV+ , IV− ) used the second set of data. The sub
index in each case refers to the sign of the parameter a (both signs are allowed,
see discussion below (52)). Further, fitting I+ differs from fitting II+ in that
the latter does not include the first 25 days of the data. The same distinction is
true for the pairs (II+ , IV+ ). This was done in order to test if predictions could
be improved by resting importance to the initial data and to test how much
the fitting parameters change with time. Comparing the values of K, Ap , ∆A,
tp , and tf for the pair (I+ , II+ ) shows that, indeed, disregarding the initial 25
data points yields somewhat larger values of the number of total accumulated
infections and the duration of the epidemic. As we shall see below, the larger
values of K, tp , Ap makes the extrapolation of the fitting II+ come closer to
the data values for a few days after the end of the fitting, the day 118. The
root mean square deviation σ, a measure of how much the fit deviates from the
data, is appreciable smaller for the case II+ than for the case I+ , indicating
that case II+ is a better fitting. This improvement on the fitting correlates
with an improvement on the short term prediction. The same occurs between
cases III+ and IV+ ; this time with 134 as the final day of fitting; here σ
changes from 1856 to 1562 as the first 25 days are ignored.
In Figure 6 we plot A(t) = (50) for the 8 cases listed in Table 1 together
with the actual data. Figure 7 is a zoom of Fig. 6. The above mentioned cases
correspond to the four lowest curves, I+ (blue solid line), II+ (black solid
line), III+ (red solid line) and IV+ (magenta solid line). These illustrate that
even though cutting off the first 25 day of fitting does improve the predictions
it does it only for a week or so after the fitting final date.

It is evident that all 8 fittings give similar results for the first stages of the
pandemia but their asymptotic behavior is quite different, fanning out into
two sets. Specifically the set that diverts very soon from the data corresponds
to those fittings with positive values of a and r. The second set of fittings have
all negative values of a (simultaneously, negative values of r) is able to predict
the data correctly and for a much longer time.
The reason negative values yield better predictions is that the data for the
daily new cases ∆A is far from being symmetric about its peak value Ap . It is
symmetric when the peak Ap is K/2. Richards model allows for the asymmetry
through the parameter a. As Eq.(50) shows, the flow F (A; r, α, K) = (42) is
symmetric only for a = 1 ( the standard logistic flow). As a becomes less than
1, the peak moves to the left of A = K/2 and as a → 0+ , Ap → K/e. So, the
solution (45) would be unable to provide good fittings with a > 0 if the data demands that Ap be smaller or equal to K/e. This argument is consistent with the
ratios computed for all the fittings we have done. In particular, the ratios Ap /K
for the cases I+ , II+ , III+ and IV+ are, respectively, 0.36793, 0.36793, 0.36791,
and 3.6794; these are barely larger than 1/e = 0.36787.... The other 4 cases
have negative a (and r) and the ratios are little smaller than 1/e; namely,
0.3512, 0.34317, 0.35791, and 0.34313 for I− , II− , III− and IV− , respectively.
Note that as a becomes negative, r becomes negative also in order to preserve
the concavity of the flow function (42)
In conclusion, Figs. 6 and 7 show that the fittings with negative values
of a and r render not only a better fitting but their extrapolations after the
final fitting date are able to predict quite well the data for about 2 months.
Still, there is no certainty that the predictions will continue to agree with data
beyond a few days after the day 188 ( September 2, 2020) but one may venture
to forecast that the actual evolution of A(t) will follow a curve close to the
fitting I− with a total number of infected population of about 1.1-1.3 million
people, or close to 1 percent of the total population in Mexico.

3.3 Discretization and Bifurcation
For any given country or region the generation of data for epidemics is updated
daily, so it is interesting to see what differences may occur for the discretized
version of Richards model. Rescaling the cumulative number of infections A(t)
to the total accumulated number of infections K : A → x ≡ A/K the discretized version of (42) is the mapping
xn+1 = G((xn ; α, r) = (1 + r)xn − rxa+1
n ,

(54)

where we have taken the constant lapse time ∆t between gathering of data
as our unit of time. We can further simplify the flow (42) , by rescaling the
time by the infection coefficient r, t → τ ≡ r × t, leading to
dy
= y(1 − y α ).

Fig. 6 Accumulated number of infections A(t) for 8 cases listed in Table 1 versus data up
to day 187 (September 1st, 2020).

Note that we have changed the notation for the scaled number of infections
x = I/K to y = I/K since x(t) is in general not equal to x(r × t) ≡ y(τ ). Its
corresponding mapping is
yn+1 = Hα (yn ) ≡ 2yn − ynα+1 .

(56)

Here, our unit of lapse time is ∆τ = r∆t. We now list the basic properties of
this simpler homeomorphism
i) Zeroes of Hα (y).
Hα (y) = 0

and y ≡ ye = 21/α .

at y = 0

(57)

ii) There are only two period-one fixed points:
Hα (y) = y

at y = 0

iii) Hα has only one critical point yc .

and y = yp = 1 ∀ α

1+a

(60)

where 1/(1 + a)1/α is a monotonically increasing real function from 0 to 1
in (−1, ∞). (It is 1/e at α = 0) . Hence yc ≤ ye . Thus the critical value
occurs in between y = 0 and y = ye .

iv) The critical value is a maximum in (0, ye ) only if α > 0.
v) The critical value is minimum in (0, ye ) only if −1 < α < 0.
vi) Stability of the period one orbits. The fixed point y = 0 is repelling for all
α; yp = 1 is attracting for α ∈ (0, 2) and repelling for a > 2.
vii) Unbound orbits for α > 0. As α increases past the threshold value αt =
3.40349...,the critical value Hα (yc ) becomes larger than the end point ye
and the orbits escape to −∞.
Based on these properties we conclude that the interesting interval of α is
(0, αt ) since in this interval all orbits are bounded and the period one fixed
point yp = 1 loses its stability at α = 2. What remains to see is what kind of
dynamics occurs from α = 2 to αt .
Figures 8 and 9 succintly display the rich dynamics of the mapping Hα (y)
in the interval 1.8 ≤ α ≤ αb . The interval α ∈ (0, 1.8) is not included since all
orbits converge to the fixed point of period one yp = 1, as mentioned in item
vi above. This bifurcation diagram shows not only the (predicted) instability
of the period-one fixed point for α > 2 but that the dynamics undergo the
period doubling route to chaos. However, it should not be surprising given
that our simple mapping belongs to the universal class of unimodal mappings
with negative Schwarzian derivative in the interval [0, ye ]. [24] [25].
Remarks As regards the implementation of this simple map to the epidemics, one may also fit the data to the orbit (cascade) yn = Hα (yn ). Of
course, we would want a scenario where the orbits converge to one single
outcome, which implies that α should be less than 2. Small values of α, say
α = 0.2 yield sigmoid-like evolutions, Fig. 10 shows the evolution of y(n) and

The two parameter model F (x, α, r)= Eq.(42). A similar analysis can be carried out for the two parameter mapping (42). It can be shown that the maximum occus in three regions in parameter space, namely, region 1) r > 0, α <
−1; region 2) r < 0, −1 < α < 0 and region 3) r > 0, α > 0. Calculations of
the Schwarzian derivative of F (x, α, r) show that it is negative in large regions
where the critical value of F (x, α, r) is a maximum, so it is expected that it
will also display the period-doubling route to chaos. The detailed analysis of
this model shall be reported elsewhere.

4 Discussion
In this paper we have provided integrability conditions and exact solutions
for a suffciently simple model of SIR. In small steps, we improved the model
so as to encompass the variation of parameters with time and the interaction
between regions, including migration of susceptible and infected individuals.
A system with more than two regions is non-separable in any of its non-trivial
versions; the exceptions, of course, are the absence of population exchange or
the absence of infection. A variety of effects was discussed for infection revival
under migratory conditions and variable quarantine policies.
With respect to applicability, some comments are in order. In particular,
Richards model (a generalized logistic model) was employed to fit Mexico’s

COVID-19 data up to a certain date of the epidemic. As a result, a variety of
scenarios were obtained, consistent with strong fluctuations in the final number of casualties. It was possible to find a family of curves fitting the data up to
a certain date reasonably well, but with strong variations in the final outcome,
months ahead. In this respect, we have seen how small variations in parameters produce large deviations in projected number of accumulated cases, and
therefore, using D = qR, also in the number of casualties. This exhibits the
challenge of reliable metrics for SIR and logistic type systems; a great deal of
work and an impressive display of modelling methods in real time has been
seen during the year 2020. To name a few important examples, we refer the
reader to [26], [27], [28]. However, while acknowledging the merit of these valuable works, we should underscore the fact that forecasting and nowcasting are
strongly challenged by the careful determination of phenomenological parameters, especially the reproduction number R0 . Small inaccuracies may lead to
very large errors, not because of chaoticity (which is absent) but because of
exponential growth and the subsequent exponential depletion.
In this respect, the existence of exact solutions allows for a systematic
study of robustness, understood as error propagation under model variation
and uncertainties. Interestingly, in the branch of quantum dynamics and complex modelling applied to physical systems, the concept of fidelity is sometimes
mentioned as a useful measure, as it consists of an autocorrelation function
between solutions after evolution takes place under two slightly different dynamical systems. We believe that a similar analysis can be carried out in
population dynamics with the results provided in the present work.

Finally, it is important to stress the role of inverse problems, as opposed to
direct problems, typically addressed in this setting. The former consists in the
determination of a model from a desired behaviour, whereas the latter deals
with the determination of the evolution from a given model. Inverse problems
tap into exactly solvable systems and explicit formulas because of invertibility,
a key concept guaranteed by the implicit function theorem.
