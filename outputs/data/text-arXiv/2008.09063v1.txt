ABSTRACT The objective of this research is to explore the existing mobile applications developed for

the COVID-19 pandemic. To obtain this research objective, firstly the related applications were selected
through the systematic search technique in the popular application stores. Secondly, data related to the
app objectives, functionalities provided by the app, user ratings, and user reviews were extracted. Thirdly,
the extracted data were analyzed through the affinity diagram, noticing-collecting-thinking, and descriptive
analysis. As outcomes, the review provides a state-of-the-art view of mobile apps developed for COVID19 by revealing nine functionalities or features. It revealed ten factors related to information systems
design characteristics that can guide future app design. The review outcome highlights the need for new
development and further refinement of the existing applications considering not only the revealed objectives
and their associated functionalities, but also revealed design characteristics such as reliability, performance,
usefulness, supportive, security, privacy, flexibility, responsiveness, ease of use, and cultural sensitivity.

I. INTRODUCTION

ORONAVIRUSES (CoVs) are a family of viruses that
can infect human beings as well as different species
of animals like cattle, cats, and bats [1]. These viruses can
cause illness varying from the very mild cold to severe
health conditions including death. A pneumonia, referred to
as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), was
first recognized in China [2] with an overall death rate of
around .3 to 6% [3]. Like SARS-CoV, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) is also a member of CoVs
family. And, the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) is a new
betacoronavirus, which has infected humans recently. Common symptoms of COVID-19 virus include fever, cough,
and breathing difficulties, among others. In severe cases, the
infection can cause pneumonia and even death. People with
previous diseases related to heart, kidney, lungs, and diabetes
are more likely to develop serious illness from COVID-19.
After China, COVID-19 has been spread in more than 210
countries and territories [4]. On March 11, 2020, the World
Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 as the
global pandemic [5].

C

The immediate risk of being infected by COVID-19 is
increasing day by day as the outbreak expands. Since there
had been limited or delayed precautionary responses against
the new virus, it had spread rapidly from person-to-person
globally. It has been suggested that further COVID-19 spread
can be controlled by taking proper and urgent precautions
and raising health awareness among people [6]. Several International organizations like WHO [7], Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) [8] have suggested necessary
plans to deal with the pandemic. Countries have taken steps
such as providing health safety guidelines, imposing travel
restrictions, organizing enough quarantine and hospital facilities for infected people, and even complete lock-down [9]
[10] [11] [12]. To prevent virus infection some suggestions
include: frequent hand washing, avoiding crowded places,
covering mouth and nose, eating fully cooked meat and
eggs, and avoiding close contacts with anyone coughing and
sneezing, among others [1].
Some information and communication technology (ICT)
based initiatives have been taken for raising awareness for
preventing the pandemic caused by COVID-19. These in1

clude mobile applications, online dashboards to provide live
updates, websites to provide remote assistance, web portals
to provide useful information related to COVID-19, and
the development of electronic gadgets to detect or scan the
symptoms of COVID-19, among others [13] [14] [15].
At present, more than 45% people in the world use smartphones [16]. Indeed, smartphones and Internet penetration
in the developed world is high. At the same time, recent
studies show that the uses of smartphones and the Internet
have also been noticeably high in many developing countries
[17]. As an example, a study conducted by Islam et al. [18]
found that around 234 mobile health (mHealth) applications
were developed explicitly for Bangladesh. Developing countries have relatively weak healthcare facilities. Therefore,
there is a possibility that COVID-19 may hit hard in these
countries. Mobile apps can support interactivity, visual and
auditory content, real-time data collection, as well as links to

social functionalities [19] [20]. Considering the widespread
adoption of smartphones in the developing and developed
countries, there is a growing opportunity for the effective uses
of mobile applications for preventing, caring and controlling
the pandemic caused by COVID-19.
A number of review studies were conducted focusing on
the mobile health applications developed for cardiovascular
disorder [21], depression [22], human immunodeficiency
virus [23] [24], cancer [25], schizophrenia [26], monitoring
physical activity [27], and managing bipolar disorder [28],
among others. However, up to date, no study has assessed the
available apps related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Indeed, as
the COVID-19 pandemic is a newly developed phenomenon
and therefore, available apps in this area are still limited and
more efforts in app development will follow in the future.
However, at the same time, we believe that as it has become a
worldwide pandemic, research needs to investigate what apps

have been developed and make a synthesis to guide future
service development.
In order to address the above-mentioned research gap, this
study conducts a thorough review of the existing mobile
apps that have been developed focusing on COVID-19. Our
objectives were to (i) identify existing apps related to the
COVID-19 in the popular app stores; (ii) investigate the apps
in terms of their objectives and associated features or functionalities; (iii) explore the platform (operating system) of the
apps, country-context for which the app was developed, and
the language of the app; and (iv) identify important design
characteristics based on the positive and negative feedback
from users.
II. METHODS

Reviewing the existing apps developed for COVID-19 was
conducted by a systematic app review. The study was carried
out following the steps discussed in the following subsections.
A. SYSTEMATIC SEARCH CRITERIA AND SELECTION

A systematic review of mobile applications across three
major mobile app stores: Android Google Play, Apple Store,
and Microsoft Store was conducted on 30th April 2020. The
search keywords used to find out the related applications
were: “coronavirus,” “COVID 19,” “corona,” “corona outbreak,” “corona pandemic,” “corona and symptom monitoring,” “corona and self-care,” “COVID 19 and symptom monitoring,” “corona and COVID 19,” “corona and self-isolation,”
“corona and quarantine,” and “self-care and COVID 19.”
Each term was searched in each of the three app stores listed.
App titles, screenshots of the apps, and app descriptions
were considered for the preliminary screening. The second

round of exclusion criteria focused on removing the duplicate
apps that were found in multiple stores or from multiple
search terms or the apps that were no longer available (some
of the apps were removed from the app stores). Two members
of this research team meticulously reviewed the apps in each
round of exclusion. Finally, a total of 25 apps were selected,
downloaded, reviewed, and evaluated. The description of
the selected applications is provided in Table 1. The related
app screening, inclusion/exclusion, and selection process are
shown in Figure 1.
B. EXTRACTING THE STUDY DATA

To attain the research goal, we extracted data related to the
objective of the apps, functionalities provided by the apps,
the platform (operating system) of the selected apps, countrycontext, language of the apps, user ratings, first release,
and user comments. The objectives and features of the apps
were extracted both from the app description and by the
experimental use of the apps. For extracting the features, we
first went through the app description and kept notes of the
stated features. In some cases, when the app language was
not English, we used Google translator. After that, each app
was installed and explored to re-check (verify) the extracted
features and update the list of extracted features as observed
from the experimental use of the app. We ensured that the
features extracted against each app from the description must
be present in the actual app through the experimental use of
the app. Our approach helped us to explore the stated features
as well as other features (if any) from our experimental use
of the apps.
C. DATA ANALYSIS

An affinity diagram [29] approach was used to analyze the
data to find out the objectives of the apps. A noticingcollecting-thinking approach [30] was used to analyze the
user comments (n = 1574) of the selected applications to
identify the design characteristics of the apps. The other
data including the review scores, development platform, application languages, and the country-context were analyzed
using descriptive statistics and data synthesizing. We note
that our approach of data collection from online sources is
widely used in different disciplines [31]–[33], and known as
netnography [34].
Each of the selected apps was investigated to extract their
functionalities or features. Each author of this article separately participated in exploring the app functionalities and
then in grouping (mapping or clustering) process through
an affinity diagram [29]. Firstly, each author extracts the
functionalities and assigned names to the functionalities.
After that they met together to compare and verify the extracted functionalities for each application. The naming of
the extracted functionalities, conflicting functionality names,
and disagreements were resolved by discussion through consensus to finalize the functionalities of the selected apps.
Secondly, each researcher separately categorized the extracted functionalities into different groups based on their

similarities. Next, an intuitive name was given to each group
(which are considered as the objective of the application)
and then drew the affinity diagram. Finally, the four affinity
diagrams (by four authors) were analyzed together to review
the grouping or clustering. Thereafter, we came up with one
affinity diagram with the final clustering.
Since the user review data are qualitative in nature and not
all the reviews were related to the design issues, we have
followed the noticing-collecting-thinking [30] method to analyze each of the retrieved review comments. An example of
analyzing a review comment through the noticing-collectingthinking approach is discussed here. Firstly, at the noticing
level, we read a review comment several times to notice an
interesting or relevant aspect that may relate to the design of
the application and coded it accordingly. For example, the
following user review comment was noticed, which was relevant to the application design: “I did not like that you have to
sign up with your phone number before you can enter the app.
I am concerned about digital privacy and this is just not okay,
especially in this crucial time when information is crucial.”
The extracted code of this review comment was ’concerned
about digital privacy’. Secondly, in the collecting level, all

the related codes were grouped and given a self-expressive
or self-descriptive group name. The ’concerned about digital
privacy’ code was grouped under the category of ’Privacy’.
Finally, in the thinking stage, we examined the things (e.g.,
all codes related to ’privacy’) that we had collected to verify
whether the things make some type of sense (e.g., a design
characteristic or recommendation) out of each collection.
Furthermore, we checked whether any relationship exists
within a collection and across the collection. While collecting
and thinking, a review comment was coded as either positive
or negative based on its referential or indicative meaning.
For example, if any user review expresses the difficulties of
using a feature or reveals dissatisfaction with the app (e.g.,
providing unauthentic and outdated information), then we
have considered such a statement as a negative comment. The
example quote stated above expresses dissatisfaction of the
user as he/she was asked to sign up using a phone number
and therefore, was concerned about digital privacy. Thus, the
above comment was coded as a negative comment.
The review comments were independently analyzed by
two researchers. The comments were meticulously read to
notice, and code as we discussed above. The assigned key-

words or codes were then collected and categorized to represent common themes. After that, both researchers thought
about their coding to refine, verify and update the code
names, categorizations, relations among the categorizations.
Finally, all authors met to compare the coding and classifications. The inter-coder agreement [35] was 0.91. The disagreements were resolved by discussion through consensus. Using
an iterative process, all researchers read, sorted, reread, and
recombined the data until consensus was achieved.

III. RESULTS

This section discusses the findings of reviewing the selected
mobile applications.
A. APP OBJECTIVE AND FEATURES

3)

As an outcome, a total of 26 functionalities were found from
the 25 mobile applications. The extracted functionalities for
each mobile application are shown in Table 3 of Appendix A.
Through the affinity diagram, a total of nine objectives were
found for which the mobile applications were developed. The
extracted functionalities and their mapping to the objectives
of the mobile applications are presented in Figure 2. The
objectives of the mobile applications were also mapped to the
selected mobile apps and shown in Table 4 of Appendix A.
The results (see Table 4) show that most of the applications
were developed for the multiple purposes but there was
no single application found that addressed all objectives or
purposes. The number of applications that offered a specific
objective is shown in Figure 3. The revealed purposes of the
mobile applications for the COVID-19 pandemic are briefly
discussed below.

6)
1) Remote assistance - About 56 % of the applications
(i.e., 14 out of 25 applications) provide remote assistance to users or patients. The functionalities to
achieve this objective are remote consultation through
video communication, audio call, instant messaging,
and emergency call support. Patients may conduct selfassessment to check if their symptoms are related to
COVID-19. Some applications support self-reporting

of COVID-19 infection as well as receiving the virtual
medical assistance. A few apps also provide warning
notifications on a regular basis related to new affected
geographical regions and awareness information about
COVID-19.
Monitor patients - Around half of the applications (i.e.,
12 out of 25 applications) include features for monitoring patients by observing the users’ health parameters
such as temperature, heart rate, oxygen, and blood
pressure using Bluetooth certified medical devices. The
patients can consult with doctors through live video
and receive medical advice. Some apps provide virtual
assistance through interacting with people in natural
language and voice.
Current status - Most of the applications (i.e., 18
out of 25 applications) provide the current status and
statistics from a local (specific-country context) and a
global perspective through data-sheets and data visualizations. Such status includes the number of confirmed
infected people, recovery, death, incubation period, etc.
with respect to the time and geographical location.
Some apps provide the prediction data through different kinds of mathematical analyses; and some other
apps provide recent corona virus related news and push
notifications for any new suspected case, suspected
community/regions, death, and recovery.
Prevent COVID-19 - More than half of the selected
applications (i.e., 15 out of 25 applications) provide
services for the prevention of COVID-19 by providing
updated COVID-19 related news about newly suspected community/regions. Especially, these applications provide the preventive guidelines suggested by
the ministry of health, WHO, CDC, or other authentic
body. Some apps focus to provide the necessary information for staying at self-isolation.
Control COVID-19 - Around 40% of the applications (i.e., 10 out of 25 applications) target to control
the spread of COVID-19 by providing instructions
for self-isolation, facilitating to report the suspected
cases to the health authority, nearest hospital, or to
the government; and conveying the users feedback to
the government bodies to take necessary initiative to
control COVID-19. Some other applications provide
information related to COVID-19 symptoms and keep
people updated with the situation by providing updated
news regularly, which also assists end-users to control
COVID-19.
Communication support - Around one-third of the
applications (i.e., 8 out of 25 applications) include
services to provide communication support using live
chat or video consultation, instant messaging, regular or emergency phone calls to hot-lines/dedicated
help numbers. A few applications provide interaction/communication facilities between the government
bodies and people. The government can send notices,
health recommendations, and record people’s feedback

M. N. Islam et al.: A review on the mobile applications developed for COVID-19: An exploratory analysis

to take necessary initiatives to prevent or control the
spread of COVID-19.
7) Treatment services - Around half (48%) of the applications provide treatment services or treatment-related
information. The available functionalities to achieve
this objective are: search functionality to find nearby
medical facilitates with COVID-19 testing capacity
and pharmacies; provide information about the nearby
hospitals, hospital maps, and travelling information to
reach the nearby hospitals. Some applications provide
information related to COVID-19 symptoms so that in
case of suspected infection, users may conduct the selfassessment. Some other apps recommend suspected
patients to contact the nearby service centers or hospitals based on their geographical location and physical
symptoms.
8) Raise awareness - Similar to the current status objective, most of the applications (i.e., 17 out of 25
applications) make people aware of the pandemic by
providing the recent updates (corona news and corona
status). In addition, some applications provide useful web links related to the COVID-19, information
about when, how, and why to stay at self-isolation.
A few apps provide declarations about new suspected
cases, death, recovery, etc. from a local (a specific
country) perspective and the push notification for any
important/emergency alert message and news about
suspected community/regions.
9) Improve mental health - A total of seven (28%) applications focused on users’ mental health which is very
crucial for each individual during the pandemic. These
applications improve motivation and self-confidence
of the users through community building, sharing personal experiences with other people, and by providing
the positive COVID-19 news like recovery updates of
the patients and recent/new initiatives taken by the
government in order to prevent and control the spread
of COVID-19.

B. APP CONTEXT, LANGUAGE AND USER RATINGS

The summary of the evaluated apps as presented in Table
1, shows that among the existing applications, 4 apps (16%)
were developed exclusively in iOS platform, two apps (8%)
were developed in Windows platform, 12 apps (48%) were
developed in Android platform and the remaining apps were
developed in both iOS and Android platforms. All the apps
were freely available. Each application mentioned about its
privacy policy. More than half of the applications (n=13)
were developed for a specific country context that includes
India, Vietnam, Brazil, France, Bangladesh, UK, Canada,
Spain, Australia, and Greece. Among the apps, twelve were
developed in local language and one app COVA Punjab was
in English (see Table 1).

C. MINING THE APP REVIEW

A total of ten information systems design characteristics
were found on the mobile applications developed targeting
COVID-19 through mining the app reviews. Both positive
and negative experiences were found in each category of
design characteristics. The design characteristics codes and
the examples of users’ comments are presented with the
+ (positive) and - (negative) signs in Table 2. The design
characteristics related factors (see Table 2) are discussed
below.
Reliability refers to the dependability of the service [36]–
[38] such that it enables users to receive authentic and
updated information, and make sure that the app contents
don’t encourage panic but promote awareness. Performance
captures the predictability and functionality dimensions [36].
Therefore, performance relates to issues such as wellexecution of the app functionalities, help in slowing down
the spread of the virus, and failure to access some of the
app functionalities properly. Usefulness and Supportive are
concerned with the extent to which an application helps the
users to achieve their purposes such as raise awareness about
the coronavirus, properly keep track of the updated situation,
support for self-caring, and maintain social distancing. We
note that the concept of perceived usefulness has been widely
used in prior literature and has been suggested as one of the
main predictors of adopting and using a service [39]–[41].
Security and Privacy relate to the users’ concern on digital
privacy, accessing the application anonymously, unnecessary
resource access permission, and asking for personal information or phone number during sign-up. Both security and
privacy have been suggested important design considerations
in prior literature [42]. Flexibility refers to the way the system
adapts to the changing demands of the users [36], [37].
Therefore, in our context flexibility is about allowing the
users to post without world limit, avoiding rigid information
(e.g., phone number) input (i.e., in a specific data format), and
allowing options to hide the posts and setting up reminders.
Concerns related to receiving immediate feedback, activation
code or OTP, and fast response/load are related to the responsiveness factor of information systems characteristics. The
responsiveness characteristics can be captured through the
timeliness and speed characteristics that have been discussed
in prior literature [36]. Ease-of-use and usable refers to the
design aspect of user screens in terms of ease of use, visual attractiveness, user-friendliness, and convenience in delivering
services [39]. Therefore, these information systems design
characteristics are concerned with the easy and convenient
way to access information, use of intuitive navigation buttons
and visual representations, and proper organization of the app
contents (information architecture). Finally, the culturally
sensitive factor refers to developing contextual (in terms of
country and language) applications for more effective and
efficient use of the app functionalities by the local people. We
note that language has been emphasized by Wixom and Todd
[37], whereas Zakaria et al. [43] emphasized on designing

and implementing culturally sensitive IT applications considering privacy and cultural values.
Each of the above information systems design characteristics related factors are mentioned both positively and
negatively in the app review. For example, in the case of
reliability factor (see Table 2), users’ concerns related to
providing authentic information, respectfulness in publishing
information, and updating information in a regular basis were
positive user experiences; while user comments related to
providing insufficient information, spreading false information, discussing unrelated subjects and creating panic were
negative user experiences.
IV. DISCUSSION

The review found that only a limited number of mobile
applications have been developed. However, we note that
more application development efforts will eventually come
in the future. Our review revealed the main purposes of
developing the mobile applications and the functionalities
to achieve these objectives for the prevention, mitigation,
and containment of COVID-19. The review study also explored the key factors or concerns that affect the end-user
experience. Our results indicate that users prefer applications
with higher reliability, performance, responsiveness, supportive, ease-of-use, usefulness, security, privacy, and flexibility.
We also observed that culturally sensitive applications are
needed. COVID-19 pandemic creates a crucial situation in
the affected countries.
A. IMPLICATIONS

This research has implications for future research and practice. The outcomes of this review will greatly contribute to
the health institutes, health workers, practitioners, and the
governments of the COVID-19 affected countries. Our paper
summarizes the currently developed apps to raise awareness
about the existing mobile applications, their functionalities,
and design characteristics. The findings can help to take necessary initiatives in developing new applications or updating
the existing applications to receive maximum benefits out of
these applications during the pandemic. The review study
also can be considered as a requirement elicitation study.
The app developers may consider the revealed objectives and
functionalities as the user requirements. For example, if the
professionals or governments want to develop a mobile application to ensure population awareness about the COVID-19
pandemic, they may incorporate the services associated with
the ’raise awareness’ objective. In contrast, if a government
would like to develop a new application to provide all possible services related to COVID-19, it may consider the nine
objectives and the entire set of functionalities revealed from
this study as shown in Figure 2.
This review also helps to understand the key information
system design characteristics that need to be addressed to
develop such applications. The revealed design characteristics can be considered as the design recommendations to
the practitioners for developing and evaluating such appli-

cations. The design recommendations based on the revealed
design characteristics are as follows. The applications should
provide quick and accurate responses. The apps need to
be usable and useful. The applications should provide authentic information in order to be reliable. The applications
should also perform well with the required functionalities.
This will also ensure that the applications are useful and
supportive with respect to the user requirements. The security
and privacy issues should be addressed properly since these
aspects are critical to many users during the vulnerable time.
Responsive and flexible app design and development need to
be ensured. The application should be easy to use in order
to ensure that different types of users can use it. Finally,
the application should be culturally sensitive, when possible;
since users may prefer to have a contextual (local) app in their
own language.
In sum, the findings of our study would be a great source
of inspiration for governments to take necessary initiatives
to develop new applications and promote the adoption of
existing/new mobile application(s). Finally, for app development companies, these outcomes provide an indication for
developing new and innovative mobile apps targeting the
affected countries.
B. LIMITATIONS

The study presented in this paper has a few limitations that
are important to acknowledge. Firstly, the criteria (search
strings/keywords) chosen for selecting the relevant apps
for this study may not cover all the available applications,
especially the applications that are named in a local language. Secondly, this study does not include the relevant
apps that are developed or became available in the app
stores after April 30, 2020. Thirdly, the review data was
analyzed through the qualitative approach using the affinity
diagram and noticing-collecting-thinking. Qualitative analysis is subjective and partly depends on analyzers’ skills,
expertise, and knowledge. Therefore there might be some
flaws in the data extraction, coding, and clustering process.
However, in order to alleviate these limitations, researchers
meticulously conducted checks for apps selection and data
analysis, and made adjustments where necessary through discussions. Fourth, in this study, we did not investigate which
features are essential and which are nice-to-have. Thus, a
future study may explore or classify the essential and nice-tohave features to achieve the identified objectives. Finally, the
online review data collected from the app stores may contain
biases. Therefore, future research can use multiple methods
to collect and analyze data to investigate the validity of our
findings.
