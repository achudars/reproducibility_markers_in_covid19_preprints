Abstract—In this paper, we firstly propose SQIARD and
SIARD models to investigate the transmission of COVID-19
with quarantine, infected and asymptomatic infected, and discuss
the relation between the respective basic reproduction number
R0 , RQ and the stability of the equilibrium points of model.
Secondly, after training the related data parameters, in our
numerical simulations, we respectively conduct the forecast of
the data of US, South Korea, Brazil, India, Russia and Italy,
and the effect of prediction of the epidemic situation in each
country. Furthermore, we apply US data to compare SQIARD
with SIARD, and display the effects of predictions.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Since the first Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patient
was discovered in Wuhan, China in December 2019, it has
become the most serious infectious disease in the world
today. According to the reports of “WHO Coronavirus Disease
(COVID-19) Dashboard”, globally, as of 3:02pm CEST, 24
October 2020, there have been 42,055,863 confirmed cases of
COVID-19, including 1,141,567 deaths. This disease poses a
great threat to the health of the global population and damages
various developments in the world.
There is a lot of evidence that COVID-19 patients have a
very high proportion of patients with mild symptoms or no
symptoms. As a support to the possibility that there are less
symptomatic cases than previously estimated. In [1], the authors esitimated that in 11 European countries, there are orders
of magnitude fewer infections detected than true infections,
mostly likely due to mild and asymptomatic infections as well
as limited testing capacity. Lavezzo, et al [2] stated that, at Vò,
Italy, the asymptomatic cases were a fraction of 43.2% of the
total. In [3], the article assumed that the asymptomatic infected
population is about nine times larger than the population with
symptoms, based on government estimations. Gudbjartsson, et
al [4] also pointed out that in the overall population screening
group in Iceland, SARS-CoV-2 43% of the participants who
tested positive were asymptomatic. In [5], it found that the
proportion of asymptomatic individuals increased very fast
from 16.1%(35 asymptomatic infections/218 confirmed cases)
to 50.6%(314/621) a week. From this researching results, we
observed that the proportion of asymptomatic infections for

COVID-19 has dramatic changed. By the WHO’s report, it
also pointed out that the asymptomatic infections are not
non-infectious more and more. Therefore, the proportion of
asymptomatic infections is critical to the impact of epidemic
research. In this paper, we will use mathematical models and
data analysis methods to analyze the proportion of asymptomatic infections in various countries and predict the future
trend of the epidemic. In Table 1 of section 4, we list
the proportion of symptomatic infections α in six countries,
respectively. 1−α is the proportion of asymptomatic people. In
[2], the authors also stated that, at V‘o, Italy, the asymptomatic
cases were a fraction of 43.2 % of the total, which was
consistent with the 45 % of our numerical simulation in the
Table 1 for Italy. This also shows that our model can be applied
to find out the proportion of asymptomatic people in each
country.
In the study of the COVID-19 epidemic, one of important
topics is to estimate the basic reproduction number R0 . In [7]
and [8], they found the relation between the model locally
asymptotically stability and R0 . In [9], the authors found out
the relation between the globally asymptotically stability of the
model and R0 . In the nice results of [10], Chen, et al revised
the respective model into discrete time difference equations to
find the representation of each parameter. Then they further
used the iterative method to find the relation between R0
and model parameters. In our article, we will first use the
stability of the model itself to find out the relation between
R0 and model parameters, and further revise our differential
systems into discrete time difference equations to train the
model parameters for the epidemic prediction respectively.
In the previous SARS epidemic, many researchers have
discussed the modifications of the SARS epidemic in terms
of “quarantine” and “asymptomatic”, e.g., please refer to [7][8] and the related references. However, because SARS and
COVID-19 have different epidemic patterns, the disease patterns of asymptomatic infections are also different. Therefore,
we establish two mathematical models, SQIARD and SIARD
model, to simulate the COVID-19 epidemic. Strictly speaking,
the SIARD model is only a simplified form of the SQIARD
model. The difference between the two models is whether the
parameters “number of people to be screened for the epidemic”
is added. As the acquisition of this parameter is very difficult,

2

currently the United States has complete data on the number
of people in quarantine that can be used to train the model
parameters. In order to train the related model parameters,
we remove the parameter Q(t) and use the SIARD model to
conduct the prediction data of US, South Korea, Brazil, India,
Russia and Italy. We will first propose the effect of prediction
of the SIARD model, and then use US data which contains
Q(t) to show the effect of prediction of the SQIARD model.
The article is organized as follows: In Section 2, we
propose SQIARD to investigate the transmission of COVID19 with quarantine, infected and asymptomatic infected, and
discuss the relation between stability of the equilibrium points
and RQ . In our numerical simulation, we will observe that
SQIARD is available to conduct the forecast in US. In Section
3, we establish the SIARD model, also use FIR to train its
parameters and discuss R0 with the stability of equilibrium
for the model. Finally, in Section 4, we will show and discuss
the forecast of the data of US, South Korea, Brazil, India,
Russia and Italy, and the effect of prediction of the epidemic
situation in each country. At the same time, we use US data
to compare SQIARD with SIARD, and display the effects of
predictions.

II. SQIARD M ODEL
In this section, for consideration of the high proportion
of patients with mild symptoms or no symptoms and the
people with possibility of negative for the coronavirus back
to the susceptible group after the quarantine, we propose our
model, SQIARD to investigate the transmission of COVID19 with quarantine, infected and asymptomatic infected. First,
we give some assumptions for SQIARD and its relative basic
reproduction number; Secondly, in our numerical simulation,
we will observe that SQIARD is available to conduct the
forecast in US; Thirdly, we discuss the relation between
stability of the equilibrium points and RQ .
A. The Derivation and Basic Reproduction Number
The model has the following assumptions:
1) Q(t) is the number of quarantine people per day.
Those with positive quarantine results are further divided into “symptomatic patients”(I(t)) or “asymptomatic patients”(A(t)). Those with negative quarantine
results will return to S(t) at a rate of µ3 .
2) A(t) is claimed to be had less infectivity, 0 < δ < 1,
where δ is the proportion in infectiousness of asymptomatic infectives.
3) Total Population in our model are viewed as the same.
4) We simply the total population as a fixed value without
new born and non-epidemic death.
The variables are given as follows: [S: susceptible population; Q: quarantine population; I: infective population; A:
asymptomatic infective population; R: recovered population;
D: deaths].
The model parameters are given as follows: [β: the progression rate of susceptible to quarantine classes; δ: the
proportion in infectiousness of asymptomatic infectives, where
0 < δ < 1; µ1 : the progression rate of susceptible to infective

We note that S(t) + Q(t) + I(t) + A(t) + R(t) + D(t) = N =
S0 + I0 + A0 where N is the total population.

D(t + 1) − D(t) = η1 I + η2 A.
When the disease first spreads, the number of people
infected is much smaller than the total population. The total
population can be assumed to the same as the number of
suspected infections and let q = (a1 µ1 + a2 µ1 + a3 µ2 ) further

simplify as follows :

We can get the following inequality through simple
calculations,

I(t + 1) − I(t) = a1 µ1 Q(t) − γ1 I − η1 I

Q(t + 1) − Q(t) = β(I + δA) − qQ(t).

It is well know that such a system is stable if the spectral
radius of M is less than 1. In this case, I(t + 1) , A(t + 1)
and Q(t + 1) will converge asymptotically to a respectively
finite constant as t → ∞. In the following theorem, we show
that there is no outbreak if RQ < 1 and outbreak if RQ > 1.
Thus, RQ is known as the threshold for an outbreak in such
a model.

It’s easy to show that β <

This shows (a)⇔(b).
Now, we want to show the proof of (a)⇔(c). First, we prove
(a)→(c). Let M − I be stable. We consider the following two
case :
1) σ(M − I) ⊆ R
We may assume λi ∈ σ(M − I) and λ3 ≤ λ2 ≤ λ1 < 0.
Then it implies λi + 1 ∈ σ(M).∀i.. Since M is a
positive matrix, by Perron-Frobenius Theorem, we
have ρ(M) ∈ σ(M) and ρ(M) > 0.
Hence, it’s easy to see that ρ(M) = λ1 + 1 ∈ (0, 1).
Then we obtain ρ(M) < 1.
2) σ(M − I) = {λ, a ± bi|λ, a, b ∈ R}
We may assume that λ and a are negative.
Since
M
is
a
positive
matrix,
by
Perron-Frobenius Theorem, we have ρ(M) ∈ σ(M)
and ρ(M) > 0. Assume that ρ(M) 6= λ + 1 ∈ (0, 1), it
implies ρ(M) < 1.
Now, we prove (c)→(a) in the following.
Let ρ(M) < 1, i.e. λi ∈ σ(M) and |λi | < 1. for
i = 1, 2.
a) λi ∈ R, ∀i, then λi −1 ∈ σ(M −I) and λi −1 < 0
for i = 1, 2, 3.
b) If λ1 ∈ R, λ2 = a + bi and λ3 = a − bi, then
|λ2 | = |λ3 | = a2 + b2 < 1 and |λ1 | < 1. It follows
that |a| < 1.
Since σ(M − I) = {λ1 − 1, (a − 1) ± bi}, then
a) λ < 1 ⇒ λ − 1 < 0,
b) |a| < 1 ⇒ a−1 ∈ (−2, 0) ⇒ Re(λ2 ) = Re(λ3 ) <
0.
Therefore, M − I is stable.
This completes the proof of Theorem II.1.
The following Corollary states the relation of RQ and the
breaking property of the epidemic.
Corollary II.1. If RQ < 1 then there is no outbreak of the
epidemic. Moreover, if RQ > 1, then there is an outbreak of
epdemic.

1) If ρ(M) < 1, λi − 1 ≤ ρ(M) − 1 < 0 for i = 1, 2, 3,
then X(t) converge to 0 as t → ∞.
2) If ρ(M) > 1, λ1 −1 = ρ(M)−1 > 0, then ||X(t)|| →

This completes the proof.

I(t) = (1 − α) ∗ I(t), and δ = 0.5 (the infection rate
of asymptom about 0.5). Then, after calculating the data
{β(t), γ1 (t), γ2 (t), η1 (t), a3 (t), 0 ≤ t ≤ T − 1}, we can
use the machine learning method, e.g., the following methods of Finite Impulse Response filters (FIR), to predict
β̂(t), γˆ1 (t), γˆ2 (t), ηˆ1 (t), aˆ3 (t). We note that â1 (t), â2 (t) can

From Theorem II.2 we have the following numerical Algorithm 2.1.

Regularization Parameter m; Order of FIR J.
Compute A, b of (mI + A)x = b with cost function and
ridge regularization as theorem above.
Choose m ∈

Solve x = (mI + A)−1 b.

2) Option for the Orders of FIR filters: In order to
find the appropriate orders for training each FIR models
(β̂(t), γˆ1 (t), γˆ2 (t), ηˆ1 (t), aˆ3 (t)), we divide the parameters data
{β(t), γ1 (t), γ2 (t), η1 (t), a3 (t), 0 ≤ t ≤ T −2} into respective
two parts, the training data set (size: `T ) and the validation
set (size: `V ) where `V = T − 1 − `T .

By using the training set for fitting the model, we take
the prediction with the same length as the validation set for

The Algorithm 2 is the implementing details about the searching method of orders.
For FIG. 6 ∼ FIG. 19 in Section 4, after obtaining the
orders of respective FIR filters, we will apply the certain
range T − `V ≤ t ≤ T − 1 of the validation data to conduct
the 5%, 10% and 20% effective intervals which are the
respective error between prediction and true value for the
forecast.
3) Main Algorithm: Firstly, we apply Algorithm 1 to
train model (8) for obtaining β̂(t), γ̂1 (t), γ̂2 (t), η̂1 (t) and
â3 (t). Secondly, by using the following, we can estimate
ˆ Â(t), R̂(t), D̂(t) for t ≥ T − 1:
Q̂(t), I(t),

We assume the period of COVID-19 is finite. Then we can
append the prediction β̂(t), γˆ1 (t), γˆ2 (t), ηˆ1 (t), aˆ3 (t), ≥ T − 1
to increase the variety of training set.
Definition. (Appended Training Data Set)
Let f (t), 0 ≤ t ≤ T − 2 be the training set, fˆ(t), t ≥ T − 1
be the prediction depend on the trained model and P be the
stopping criteria of the forecast. Then the Appended Training
Data defined as: F := {F(t)|(F(t) = f (t), if 0 ≤ t ≤
T − 2) or (F(t) = fˆ(t), if T − 1 ≤ t ≤ T + P )}, e.g.,
the Appended training data set of β, B := {B(t)|(B(t) =
β(t), if 0 ≤ t ≤ T −2) or (B(t) = β̂(t), if T −1 ≤ t ≤ T +
P )}. Similarly we have (γ1 , Γ1 ), (γ2 , Γ2 ), (η1 , H), (a3 , A).
Before conducting the tracking Algorithm 3, we already
obtain the respective order of β̂, γˆ1 , γˆ2 , ηˆ1 , aˆ3 by Algorithm
2 and the effective intervals for the forecast.

We complete the proof.
We discuss the relation between the parameters of the model
as follows:

Fig. 2.

In the previous section, we established and discussed the
SQIARD model. However, data on the number of people
quarantined daily in most countries is not easy to obtain
no, and only a few countries have open data (such as the
United States). Therefore, in this section we will simplify the
parameter Q(t) to build a new model.
A. The Derivation and Basic Reproduction Number
In order to verify the epidemic effect of prediction of the
SIARD model, we will take the following two steps:
1) Remove the parameter Q(t), and simplify the SQIARD
infectious disease mathematical model under the other
assumptions unchanged. Use the same training method
to train the SIARD model and observe its effect of
prediction .
2) Use data from countries that have “data on daily quarantine population” to compare the effect of prediction s
of the two models on the epidemic.
The variables are given as follows: [S: susceptible population; I: infective population; A: asymptomatic infective
population; R: recovered population; D: deaths]. The model

For Figure 2, given β = 0.080; δ = 0.5; a1 = 0.04; a2 =
0.06; a3 = 0.9; η1 = 0.01; η2 = 0; γ1 = 0.06; γ2 = 0.06; µ1 =
1; S0 = 1000; I0 = 10; A0 = Q0 = R0 = D0 = 0. We want
to observe the relation of µ2 and RQ . By Figure 2, while the
value of µ2 increases, RQ decreases. That is, when the µ2
increases faster, the epidemic will be controlled better.
For Figure 3, given β = 0.27; δ = 0.5; a3 = 0; η1 =
0.01; η2 = 0; γ1 = 0.06; γ2 = 0.06; µ1 = 1; µ2 = 1; S0 =
1000; I0 = 10; A0 = Q0 = R0 = D0 = 0, and α =
a1 /(a1 + a2 ). We want to observe the relation of α and S. By
Figure 3, while the value of α increases, S decreases. That is,
if the proportion of infector is higher, the number of people
in S will be lower at the end of the epidemic, even all people
will be infected. Contrarily, if the proportion of asymptomatic
people is relatively high, the epidemic may infect a small
group of people eventually.

The flow chart of SIARD

parameters are given as follows: [β: the progression rate
of susceptible class to infective classes; δ: the reduction in
infectiousness of asymptomatic infectives, where 0 < δ < 1;
α: the fraction of susceptible from susceptible to I or A, where
0 < α < 1; γ1 and γ2 : the recovered rates of infective classes
I and A; η1 and η2 : are the disease death rates of infective
classes I and A].

When the disease first spreads, the number of people infected
is much smaller than the total population, the number of
suspected infections is approximated to the total of population.
Then above equations can simplified as follows :
I(t + 1) − I(t) = αβ(I + δA) − γ1 I − η1 I

A(t + 1) − A(t) = (1 − α)β(I + δA) − γ2 A − η2 A

It’s well know such a system is stable if the spectral
radius of A is less than 1. In other words, I(t + 1) and
A(t + 1) will converge asymptotically to finite constant when
t → ∞. In the following theorem, we show that there is no
outbreak if R0 < 1 and there is an outbreak if R0 > 1. Thus,
R0 is known as the threshold for an outbreak in such a model.
Theorem III.1. R0 < 1 if and only if ρ(A) < 1

In this section, we will propose the relation between the
stability of the SIARD model and R0 . First, we give the
following equilibria and their respective stability analyses. We
have the following asymptotic behavior as t → ∞

IV. I MPLEMENT AND N UMERICAL A NALYSIS
In this section, we apply SIARD model to US, Brazil, South
Korea, India, Russia, Italy, and SQIARD model to US, then
showing the result in each country. In [3], the authors adopted
SSE and the method of Markov Chain Monte Carlo to conduct
the 95 % confidence intervals for I(t) and A(t), in Mexico
from Mar.12 to Jul.2. We implement our SIARD model to
make the forecast during the same period in Mexico. Then
the result shows that the prediction in [3] is decreasing while
the prediction of SIARD is increasing as FIG. IV.

For the SQIARD model, we consider the case µ1 = 1 and
µ2 = 1 where µ1 and µ2 are the rate from quarantine to I and
A. First, we use 100 data to train model(Phase I in FIG. 6a) and
20 validation data to find the best fitting orders of respective
FIR model.(Phase II in FIG. 6a) In US, we obtain the effective
intervals with range 16 days in 5 % relative error(Phase III in
FIG. 6a) and 20 days in 10 % relative error(Phase IV in FIG.
6a). Secondly, we expand our training data to 120 data(Phase
I in FIG. 6b), and then predict for 20 days(Phase II in FIG.
6b). Finally, we apply the effective intervals to the forecast in
16 days(Phase III in FIG. 6b) and 20 days(Phase IV in FIG.
6b).

C. Comparison and Analysis of Forecasting Effects
Our model finds the proportion of people with symptoms
α in six countries. For example, in Table 1, the proportion of
symptomatic infections in Italy is about 55 %, which means
that the proportion of asymptomatic infections in the country
is about 45 %. This is in line with the 43.2 % of asymptomatic
infections obtained by the authors of [2] at V‘o, Italy. It proves
that our model does have the ability to judge the proportion
of asymptomatic infections.
By above figures in US, Brazil, South Korea, India, Russia,
and Italy, it is obvious that the trend of symptom and asymptom are in relation with R0 . When R0 increase, I and A also
increase, same as decrease. In other words, R0 can be viewed
as an important target of the break or not of the COVID-19.
According to the result of our prediction, the amount of
prediction days which more precisely depends on the origin
data. For example, since the data of Russia change periodically
or decrease on the whole, we can try to find out the appropriate
order for the Country and predict more days. In contrast, like
South Korea, the data in South Korea changes unsteadily and
exists an extreme value, so we can not predict more days.
In US, we have the data of quarantine, so we can apply
SQIARD model to predict data in future. Since we add
extra parameters into model, especially the speed rate from
quarantine to symptom or asymptom, we can predict the data
more precisely than SIARD. For instance, we use SIARD
model to predict, the effective interval has 8 days(FIG. 8a.).
However, when we use SQIARD model to predict, we can
predict about 15 days(FIG. 6a.), so the way of SQIARD model
to perform is better than SIARD model during this period.
