Abstract
It is evident that increasing the intensive-care-unit (ICU) capacity and giving priority to admitting and treating
younger patients will reduce the number of COVID-19 deaths, but quantitative assessment of these measures has
remained inadequate. We develop a comprehensive, non-Markovian state transition model, which is validated through
accurate prediction of the daily death toll for two epicenters: Wuhan, China and Lombardy, Italy. The model enables
prediction of COVID-19 deaths in various scenarios. For example, if treatment priorities had been given to younger
patients, the death toll in Wuhan and Lombardy would have been reduced by 10.4% and 6.7%, respectively. The
strategy depends on the epidemic scale and is more effective in countries with a younger population structure. Analyses
of data from China, South Korea, Italy, and Spain suggest that countries with less per capita ICU medical resources
should implement this strategy in the early stage of the pandemic to reduce mortalities.

Introduction
The continuous and recently accelerated spreading of COVID-19 in more than 145 different countries and regions
of the world has placed an unprecedented burden on the corresponding healthcare systems. As of December 1, 2020,
there have been more than 63.3 million confirmed cases with over 1.4 million deaths reported, and the daily number
of deaths [1] has exceeded 8000. To mobilize the available medical resources to the maximum degree to reduce the
COVID-19 fatalities has become the top priority in many hospitals and healthcare facilities. In a hospital, there are
two types of care resources for inpatients: General Ward (GW) and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds, with the latter
currently serving mostly COVID-19 patients. Increasing the ICU beds would undoubtedly reduce the COVID-19
fatalities. When a hospital is overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients so that the ICU beds are in a serious shortage, a

selective ICU admission policy must be invoked to allow specific groups of patients to receive the ICU care. In this
regard, from a sheer mathematical point of view, giving priority to the young age group will reduce the fatality rate, as
patients in this group have a better chance of being cured. Stretching the ICU resources to their limit and implementing
selective ICU admission policy are becoming inevitable and even absolutely necessary in many parts of the world as
the COVID-19 cases have continued to skyrocket in recent months.
It is intuitively evident that enhancing ICU capabilities and selectively admitting patients into ICU can reduce the
COVID-19 mortalities, but we lack a modeling framework to quantitatively assess and characterize their effects. The
main goal of this paper is to address this issue that is critically important to maximizing the usage and effectiveness of
the limited medical resources to minimize COVID-19 deaths.
There have been intense modeling efforts on early warning, prevention and control of the COVID-19 pandemic [2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. For example, Kraemer et al. [2] found that travel restriction in the early stage of the
COVID-19 outbreak can effectively prevent the infection imported from known sources. Once cases begin to spread
in the community, the contribution of newly imported cases tends to diminish, requiring a set of control measures
including travel restrictions, detection, tracking, and isolation to mitigate the pandemic. Kissler et al. [3] established
a SARS-CoV-2 transmission model with seasonal variations, immune duration, and cross immunization, where the
peak of SARS-CoV-2 infection is assumed to be low in spring and summer and a larger epidemic breakout can occur
in autumn and winter. A finding was that, with respect to imposing one time social distancing, intermittent social
alienation measures can prevent the overload of public health resources. Hao et al. [4] found that the new coronavirus
has two characteristics: high infectivity and concealment. If 87% of the infected individuals are not detected, without
any prevention and control measures, after 14 consecutive days of zero confirmed cases, the probability of a second
wave of epidemics will be 32%. If only 53% of the infected are undetected, the probability of an epidemic rebound
will drop to 6%. Premature removal of prevention and control measures will greatly increase the possibility of a second
outbreak of the epidemic. Long et al. [5, 6, 7] developed a time-delay transmission model that can accurately simulate
and predict the epidemic development in countries or regions, and the model enables evaluation of the impact of virus
detection and social distancing intensity on the epidemic, as well as an accurate estimate of the time zero point of the
epidemic in various countries and regions. In particular, it was found [7] that community-based transmission occurred
in Europe and in the United States in early January 2020. The study of Flaxman et al. [8] revealed that the outbreak
interventions implemented in 11 European countries have reduced about 1.3 million deaths and these measures are
enough to bring down the basic reproduction number R0 to less than one. Dehning et al. [9] studied the spread of
COVID-19 in Germany by combining epidemiological modeling with Bayesian inference, and found that the change
point of the effective growth rate of new infection is closely related to the time point when the intervention measures
were imposed.
There have also been recent studies on the interplay between the medical resources and COVID-19 mortality.
Particularly, in comparison with the common influenza virus, a higher proportion of the patients infected with SARSCoV-2 need to be hospitalized. The aggravated growth in the number of infected individuals in recent months has
stretched the capacities of the medical systems in many countries and regions to their limit. A shortage of medical
resources, such as the respiratory support devices, will result in a large number of severely ill patients not getting timely
and effective treatment, exposing them to a greater risk of mortality. Ferguson et al. [12, 13] evaluated the demand
for medical resources of the non-pharmaceutical interventions type, predicting that, even when the most effective
mitigation measures are implemented, the numbers of hospital GW and ICU beds in the UK still need to be expanded
by more than eight times to meet the needs of patient care. Miller et al. [14] used the age-specific mortality and
demographic data to predict the cumulative COVID-19 cases and medical resource burden in different regions of the
United States, pointing out that medical resources are relatively scarce in remote areas. When the medical system
is overloaded, the nursing standard for the patients will be compromised, which would affect the treatment outcome.
Without proper and rigorous care, the condition of critically ill patients with COVID-19 will further deteriorate, and the
shortage of ICU facilities will aggravate the high mortality rate of such population [15, 16]. These studies [12, 13, 14,
15, 16] made evident the potential significant impact of the medical resource availability on the COVID-19 mortality.
In this paper, we develop a comprehensive state transition model to predict the COVID-19 death and its evolution
over time for a regional healthcare system with limited medical resources and selective ICU admission policy. The
typical systems are a city or a region, e.g., Wuhan city in China or the Lombard region of Italy. Realistic time delays
associated with various state transitions are fully incorporated into the model, rendering it non-Markovian to better
describe the real world situations. The model is based on and validated with empirical data such as the number of
2

confirmed cases, clinical data, demographics, and the amount of medical resources, and it enables such questions to be
addressed as: if the ICU resources were deployed certain days earlier or if the ICU capacity was doubled or tripled,
how much reduction in the death toll would be achieved? The findings of this paper can be best described with concrete
numbers. For example, for Wuhan city, if the ICU resources had been deployed a week in advance or if the number of
ICU beds had been doubled, the death toll would have been reduced by 5% or 13%, respectively. For Lombardy, the
corresponding numbers are similar: 3% or 14%. For both Wuhan and Lombardy, tripling the ICU capacity would have
resulted in a 21% reduction in the mortalities. With respect to selective ICU admission policy, prioritizing younger
patients would have reduced the death toll in Wuhan and Lombardy by 10.4% and 6.7%, respectively. As illustrated by
the exemplary numbers, our model provides a framework to predict COVID-19 deaths in arbitrary scenarios. Because
the model has been fully validated with real data, we expect the model predictions to be reliable and accurate. A further
analysis of the data from China, South Korea, Italy and Spain indicates that the age-selective admission strategy is more
effective in countries with a younger age structure, while the countries with less per capita ICU medical resources
should implement the selective admission strategy in the early stage of the epidemic to suppress mortalities.

Supplementary Figure S1. Schematic diagram of the proposed COVID-19 patient admission model under limited
medical resources. Each node represents a possible state of the patients. The specific definition of each state and the
transition paths among them (light blue and light red arrows with time representing the average delay of the transition)
are described in detail in the text. The various quantities P·→· denote the fractions of the state transition paths, and the
time delays follow a normal distribution. The light red dotted arrows indicate the two admission paths of ICU, where
ICU admission I and II have the first and second priority, respectively. The light blue dotted arrows indicate the two
treatment paths of GW, which have a lower priority than ICU admission: GW admission I and II have the third and
fourth priority, respectively.
Our COVID-19 patient admission model under limited medical resources has ten dynamical states, as shown in
Fig. S1. It describes the basic transition process of a diagnosed individual’s state from onset to recovery or death. Time
delays associated with the various state transitions are taken into account, rendering non-Markovian the dynamical
evolution. In particular, state M denotes that a patient is infected with COVID-19, state F means that the patient needs
to be hospitalized but is currently under home isolation or centralized isolation, state C describes that the patient needs
ICU support treatment but is currently isolated, states G and U indicate an inpatient occupying a GW and an ICU bed,

3

respectively, a patient in state W currently occupies a GW bed but needs ICU treatment, a patient in the GU state is
transferred out of ICU who does not need to occupy a GW bed, a patient in the Mx state is discharged from the hospital
with lessened symptoms, and the R and D states represent two clinical outcomes: recovery and death.
The medical resources can be divided into two categories: GW and ICU resources denoted as QG and QU , respectively, which can be measured, e.g., by the corresponding numbers of beds. That the resources are limited is modeled,
as follows. when the GW beds are all used up, new patients will no longer be admitted. When all ICU beds have been
occupied, patients who require ICU care either continue to wait at GW (W-state) or continue to wait outside the hospital (C-state). A common hospital admission policy is “first-come first-serve” (FCFS), which gives priority to patients
who have had a long waiting time. The admission policies of GW and ICU thus consist of four admission paths with
different priorities: GW admission I/II and ICU admission I/II, where ICU admission I for W-state patients has the
highest priority, followed by ICU admission II for C-state patients, GW admission I for the remaining C-state patients
in GW, and GW admission II for the F-state patients. The priorities define the execution order of the corresponding
paths. For M-state patients, two different transitions can occur: some patients deteriorating into the F-state so as to
require hospitalization and others slowly recovering into the R-state. For patients in the F-state, there are three types of
transitions: (i) when the GW resources are available, the patients are admitted to the hospital through GW admission
II, (ii) a proportion of the remaining F-state patients deteriorate to C-state, requiring ICU treatment, and (iii) the rest
are cured so they switch to the MX -state. Patients in state C enter ICU through ICU admission II to transition into
U-state, or through GW admission I to enter GW to become W-state, while the rest are in D-state. For G-state patients,
some switch to MX -state and no longer occupy GW resources, while others deteriorate to the W state, requiring ICU
care. W-state patients will enter ICU through ICU admission I, and the remaining will be in the D state. Some of the
U-state patients occupying ICU resources will transition to the GU state, and the others will switch to the D state. For
patients in the GU state, the symptoms are relieved after a period time and they enter the MX state. Patients in the MX
state recover to the R state after a period of time.
Let 4QG and 4QU denote the changes in the GW and ICU resources, respectively. A decrease in the GW resources
is the sum of the number of patients admitted through the GW admission I/II pathway, and an increase is the sum of the
number of ICU admission I, the number of patients in G (W)-state cured (or died), and the amount of newly deployed
GW resources. Likewise, a decrease in ICU resources is the sum of the number of patients admitted through ICU
admission I/II pathway, and an increase is the sum of the number of patients cured (or died) in state U and any newly
deployed ICU resources. The state dynamical evolution described by a set of difference equations with time delays
characterizing the state ages [Supplementary Note 1 (SN 1)].

Results
We validate our ten-state model by simulating the trend of the death tolls in Wuhan and Lombardy, using the daily
number of confirmed cases, clinical and demographic data. The model then enables us to assess the overall effects of
varying the timing of resource deployment and its amount on the COVID-19 mortalities. At a more detailed level, we
divide the patients into several age groups and calculate the death-toll trend in each age group. This allows us to assess
the impact of resource allocation scheme of different age groups on the number of deaths, and to obtain the optimal
ICU admission strategy in terms of the age structure and outbreak scale with limited medical resources.

Impact of limited medical resource deployment
Model validation
To simulate the trend of the death tolls in Wuhan and Lombardy using the the second-order difference equations
in our modeling framework, three types of data are required: time delays associated with state transitions, patient
morbidity data, and local medical resource deployment data. The details of these data are described in SN2 and
Supplementary tables S1-S5. which include information such as the average number of days in the transition delay
from M-state to F-state and the average mortality rate of patients in ICU. Most of the data were obtained through
references and official reports [17, 18, 19]. As detailed in SN2, the values of some model parameters need to be
estimated in an optimal way, e.g., at the 95% confidence level, through model simulation and empirical data such as
the average fraction of the patients switching from G-state to W-state, denoted as |P|G→W , and that from F-state to
4

C-state, denoted as |P|F→C . We use the cumulative days of insufficient GW and ICU resources to quantify the level of
stress on the healthcare system, defined as the GW overload days OG and ICU overload days OU (see SN3 - medical
system stress level indicators).

(a,b) Actual data of cumulative death toll with time in Wuhan and Lombardy, respectively. The insets show the daily
numbers of new deaths. The open black squares and red crosses represent the actual data and simulation results, respectively. The pink shaded area marks the 95% confidence interval. There is a good agreement between the simulated
daily number of deaths and the actual data, validating our ten-state model.
With the optimal parameter values and empirical data as inputs to the model, we simulate the cumulative death toll
and new deaths over time in Wuhan (from December 8, 2019 to April 15, 2020) and Lombardy (from January 28 to
June 14, 2020), as shown in Fig. S2. It can be seen that the model predicted trends of the cumulative and daily new
death tolls agree with the actual data very well, validating the model. The model also gives that the values of OG are
14 and 17 days for Wuhan and Lombardy, respectively, and the corresponding values of OU are 49 and 74 days.
Deployment of medical resources
Since the onset of COVID-19 pandemic, many countries (most notably the USA) and regions have missed the best
time window to control the spreading. At the present, there is a skyrocketing increase in the demand for ICU beds and
5

medical resources such as ventilators and other special medical devices. Many hospitals and healthcare facilities have
reached or will soon reach the limit of their operating capacities.
Optimizing the usage of medical resources by deploying them as early as possible and augmenting them as much
as possible are key to reducing the mortality rate. Let DT and RI denote the two key parameters: the deployment time
and the resource input, where DT = 0 and RI = 1 represent the actual deployment time and the available normalized
amount of resources, respectively. If the resources are deployed seven days ahead of the actual time, we have DT = −7.
Likewise, if the resources are doubled (e.g., twice as many ICU beds as in the actual case), we have RI = 2 (see SN3
for COVID-19 special medical resource deployment plans). A virtue of our modeling framework lies in its ability to
provide a quantitative picture of the dependence of the mortalities on the two key parameters.
To uncover the impact of deploying medical resources on the patient mortality rate in a concrete way, we consider
the following three scenarios: (i) varying the GW resources only, (ii) varying ICU resources only, and (iii) varying both
resources simultaneously. Some representative results are presented below (more results in SN4).

mortalities. Each panel shows the number of deaths (color coded) in the parameter plane of deployment time and
resource input: panels (a,b) are for Wuhan, China, and (c,d) are for Lombardy region, Italy. In panels (a,c), the ICU
resource amount is fixed and the resource that varies is GW. In panels (b,d), the GW resource amount is fixed and the
resources that vary are ICU. The red hexagon indicates the true death toll under the actual resource deployment, and
the white circles mark the contour of the actual death toll in the parameter plane.
Figure S3(a) shows, for Wuhan, the impact of varying GW resource deployment on the number of deaths for fixed
ICU resource deployment, where the red hexagon indicates the true death toll under the actual resource deployment. If
the GW resources had been deployed one week in advance or if its amount had been doubled, the death toll would have
been reduced by 10%. While remarkable, this 10% figure is about the maximum reduction that can be achieved by
6

varying the GW resource deployment. For example, deploying the GW resources earlier than one week or an increase
in its investment over three times would not reduce the death toll further. The maximum reduction in the deaths that
can be achieved is determined approximately by the contour of the actual death toll - the curve connecting the white
circles Fig. S3(a). These results indicate that deploying the GW resources earlier and/or augmenting them have only
limited effects on reducing the deaths.
In contrast, deploying the ICU resources earlier and/or augmenting them can be more effective at reducing the
deaths in Wuhan, as shown in Fig. S3(b), where the GW resource deployment is fixed. If the ICU resources had been
deployed one week ahead of the actual time or if the ICU resource amount had been doubled, the death toll would
have been decreased by 5% and 13% respectively. While these figures are similar to those that would have been
achieved with the same adjustment in the GW resources [Fig. S3(a)], deploying the ICU beds earlier or increasing their
number can have a much more significant effect on the number of deaths. For example, if the number of ICU beds
had been tripled, the death toll would have been reduced by 21%! The maximum reduction in the deaths is achieved
for DT = −14 and RI = 2.5, which is about 30% (about three times more effective than that which can be achieved by
stretching the GW resources and their deployment). The corresponding ICU overload days would have been decreased
to less than seven days (comparing with the actual 49 days for Wuhan). Similar results are obtained for Lombardy.
We find that adjusting the GW resource deployment would have only limited effects in reducing the death toll. For
example, as shown in Fig. S3(c), if the GW resources had been deployed one week or two weeks earlier or if the
number of GW beds had been doubled or tripled, the reduction in the deaths would have been only about 1%. This
indicates that the deployment of the GW resources in Lombardy was timely and its amount was appropriate, a fact that
can also be seen from the value of the GW overload days OG : to make it less than a week, the resources would need
to be deployed only five days earlier or the number of GW beds would need to be only 1.4 times higher. In contrast,
deploying the ICU resources earlier or augmenting them would have been much more effective at r educing the deaths.
For example, if the number of ICU beds had been tripled, the death toll would have been reduced by 21%, as shown in
Fig. S3(d). The maximum reduction that can be achieved is about 22% and OU can be decreased to less than a week.
SN3 presents results on the impact of varying the GW and ICU resource deployment simultaneously on COVID-19
death toll for both Wuhan and Lombardy.

Admission strategy based on age groups
To improve the efficiency of treatment and to reduce the mortality rate, it is essential and imperative to allocate the
available resources as reasonably as possible because as they are not unlimited. For COVID-19, the hospitalization
and mortality rates of elderly patients are higher than those of younger patients [20]. A common strategy is to divide
the patients into distinct age groups. Our modeling framework provides a rigorous way to calculate the mortalities for
different age groups.
Age groups
Individuals in any age group have the possibility of getting infected by COVID-19 with certain death risk [21].
Currently available data indicate that, in most countries, the risk of hospitalization and death increases with age [22, 23].
A direct manifestation is that the fraction of hospitalized patients and ICU mortality vary among the age groups.
For Wuhan, the available data divide patients into three groups: [0-69] years old, [70-79] years old, and [80+] years
old. A similar division scheme applies to Lombardy. We use a linear regression to obtain the estimates of the fractions
of various state transitions for each age group: PM→F , PG→W , PF→C and PU→D . (SN4 provides more details.)
We input the parameters associated with each age group into the model and calculate the death tolls as a function
of time for Wuhan and Lombardy. Figure S4 shows that the mortalities obtained from the simulation agree well with
those of the actual data. Figures S4(a) and S4(c) show that the death toll of patients over 80 years old in Wuhan is
the lowest among the age groups, while it is the highest in Lombardy: about 59%. There are two possible reasons for
this difference. First, the aging populations in the two regions are different: the fraction of people over 65 years old
is 14.06% in Wuhan and 20% in Lombardy [24, 25]. The elderly have weak autoimmunity and most of them have
preexisting, underlying diseases, resulting in an excessively high death rate in Lombardy. The second reason is that
more extensive tests were conducted in China (near 100%), enabling more young people with mild symptoms to be
detected and included in the statistics. In contrast, as of April 29, 2020, there were about 1910761 people in Italy who

had been tested, of whom 203591 were diagnosed with COVID-19 - about 11% only [26]. Nonetheless, Figs. S4(b)
and S4(d) show that the mortality rate of patients over 70 years old is higher than that of patients under 70 for both
Wuhan and Lombardy. Especially, in Lombardy, the mortality rate of patients over 80 years old reached 41%.
When the population is divided into nine age groups, our model generates essentially the same phenomenon that
the risk of death increases with age (SN5).
Group weighting strategy
People of all ages have certain risk of being infected with COVID-19. Setting priority of admission for certain
age groups can reduce the number of deaths. In Wuhan, the ICU resources were more scarce than GW resources, so
making ICU admission policy dependent on age is especially important for suppressing the mortality rate. That is, the
conventional FCFS admission policy is not suitable for COVID-19 under limited ICU resources. To set the priority
of admission for different age groups, we shift the state age of each group by a priority weight. We then change the
admission order of different age groups with the goal to find an optimal set of weights that minimizes the number of
deaths. In particular, we set the priority weight of the ith age group as wi and record τi as the state age of the this age
0
group. After weighting, the new state age τi becomes,
0

τi = τi + wi .

(1)

The state age of patients in the ith age group is increased by wi days. The patients, after incorporating the weighted
state age, are admitted according to FCFS.
To carry out the optimization procedure, we fix the priority weight of the second age group, i.e., the [70, 80) age
group, to be w2 = 30. As the state age of each group does not exceed 15, we implement different admission strategies
8

for the age groups by changing the value of w1 and w3 (see SN5 for a specific method).

Supplementary Figure S5. Dependence of death toll on weights. (a,b) Model generated death toll and its dependence
on w1 and w3 for fixed w2 = 30 for Wuhan and Lombardy, respectively, where the blue and purple colors correspond
to relatively fewer deaths. In the regions marked by Roman numerals, the death toll changes slowly with weights. The
insets show the distribution of the number of deaths for different weight combinations, where the numerical values
represent the differences in the number of deaths than that from the FCFS treatment strategy. (c,d) Daily number of
new deaths under different admission strategies for Wuhan and Lombardy, respectively, where red circles, gray boxes,
and blue-purple forks denote the results from the three strategies: preferential treatment for elderly patients, FCFS, and
preference for young patients, respectively. Giving priority to young patients results in the lowest daily death curve.
Figure S5 shows the effect of the state age of groups 1 and 3 on the number of deaths when the weight of group 2
is fixed at constant (30). The larger the state age, the higher priority of admission is. When adjusting the weights of the
first and third groups, their correspond state ages will vary and so the admission order of each age group will change
accordingly. Different orders of treatment will lead to different death tolls. Figure S5 reveals, in the parameter plane of
(w1 , w3 ), five distinct death toll regions for Wuhan. For Lombardy, there are six such regions, as shown in Fig. S5(b).
The weight range in region V in Fig. S5(a) corresponds to the ranges in regions V and VI in Fig. S5(b), due to the
relatively small fraction of patients in the third group in Wuhan. When patients in the first group are given the priority,
the treatment order of the patients in the third group has little impact on the total number of deaths. While the patients
in the third group in Lombardy have a large proportion, giving the priority to the first group will have a significant
impact. In this case, the order of treatment for patients in the third group will affect the total number of deaths.
In Fig. S5, the number of deaths in Wuhan and Lombardy in parameter region I increases by 4.8% and decreases
by 3.2%, respectively, in comparison with the death tolls from the FCFS treatment strategy, for w2 > w1 > w3 . Area
II in Fig. S5 shows the number of deaths for w2 > w3 > w1 . Comparing with the FCFS strategy, the number of deaths
increases by 10.5% and 4.1% for Wuhan and Lombardy, respectively. In area III in Fig. S5, the weighting order is
w3 > w2 > w1 and the largest death tolls are observed in Wuhan and Lombardy, as characterized by an increase of
11% and 5.7%, respectively, in comparison with the FCFS case. In area IV in Fig. S5 where the order of priority is
w3 > w1 > w2 , the death tolls in Wuhan and Lombardy increase by 2.5% and 4.5%, respectively. In area V in Fig. S5(a),
we have w1 > w3 > w2 , and the number of deaths in Wuhan is the lowest as represented by a decrease of 10.4% relative
to that associated with the FCFS strategy. In the same area V for Lombardy, the corresponding decrease in the death
toll is by 5.3%, as shown in Fig. S5(b). In area VI in Fig. S5(b), the priority ordering is w1 > w2 > w3 and there is a

9

decrease of 6.7% in the death toll. The implication of these results is that giving the treatment priority to young patients
will reduce the number of deaths but giving priority to elderly patients will increase the death toll. Due to the resource
limit, this strategy is intuitively reasonable and has in fact been commonly practiced in many hospitals and healthcare
facilities. Our results provide a validation at a quantitative level.
Figures S5(c) and S5(d) demonstrate the evolution of new deaths over time in Wuhan and Lombardy, respectively,
under different admission strategies. In both cases, there is no significant difference in the number of deaths in the
early stages of the epidemic under three treatment strategies. When the epidemic has lasted for a period of time and
the death toll increases sharply, giving priority to young patients can significantly reduce the number of deaths. At the
end of the epidemic, again the differences among the three treatment strategies diminish. Taken together, these results
verify that, under limited medical resources, during the rapidly increasing phase of COVID-19 infection, admitting and
treating young patients are necessary to reduce the final death toll.
Optimization efficiency
When the ICU resources are in a serious shortage, medical staff have to face the hard choice of adopting the
strategy of giving priority to treating young patients with a higher survival probability. The strategy’s effectiveness
notwithstanding, it has serious implications for medical ethics. It is thus worth evaluating this admission/treatment
strategy further. To this end, we exploit our model to study more extensively the impacts of different strategies for
four countries: China, South Korea, Italy, and Spain. For each country, we collect information about the numbers of
GW and ICU beds per 100000 population and about the age distribution of patients diagnosed with COVID-19. For
example, in China and Italy, the numbers of ICU beds per 100000 individuals are 3.6 and 12.5, respectively. (A detailed
display of the information can be found in SN6). We define the time-dependent optimization efficiency as
E(t) =

VQ (t)
,
VY (t)

(2)

where VQ (t) and VY (t), respectively, are the numbers of new deaths per day with the FCFS and the age-selective
strategy. In the asymptotic time limit t → ∞ when the system has reached a steady state, E(∞) characterizes the final
optimization efficiency. Since information about the average state transition fractions for patients in all four countries
is not available, we use the model parameter values for Wuhan and Lombard to calculate the value of E(∞) for four
countries versus the average daily patient size.
Based on the per capita medical resource data of the four countries as well as the age distribution data of confirmed
patients in each country, making use of the relevant model parameter values for Wuhan and Lombard, we calculate
E(∞) of the four countries versus the daily average patient size. We assume that up to 50% of the medical resources
can be deployed to treating patients with COVID-19. As shown in Fig. S6, when the number of patients is below 100,
the value of E(∞) for the four countries is equal to one. In this case, there is no need to implement the age-selective
admission strategy. When the number of patients exceeds a critical value, E(∞) for all four countries increases rapidly
as the number of patients increases through the critical value and then reaches a peak value. In fact, for a wide range of
variation of the patient size, the values of E(∞) are high. Note that the peak values of E(∞) for China and South Korea
are slightly below 1.3, but those for Italy and Spain are lower than 1.2 with a relatively slow increasing rate to reach
the peak value. A plausible reason lies in the difference in the age distribution of patients diagnosed with COVID-19
in the eastern and western countries. In particular, in China and South Korea, less than 12% of the patients are over 70
years old, while those in Italy and Spain account for 37% and 34%, respectively (SN6). The value of E(∞) is highly
correlated with the availability of the ICU beds. For E(∞) = 1, ICU beds are fully sufficient, but E(∞) > 1 signifies a
shortage of ICU beds. Figure S6(a) reveals that, with the per capita medical resources of South Korea, Italy, and Spain,
the need for ICU of 1,000 cases per tens of millions of people per day can be met for a long time, while the capacity
of China may be less than half of the capacity of those countries. Indeed, the number of ICU beds per capita in China
is 3.6 per 100000 persons, while the corresponding numbers in Italy, South Korea, and Spain are 12.5, 10.6, and 9.7,
respectively (SN 6). We conclude that, while the age-selective admission strategy is more effective in countries with
a younger population structure, countries with less per capita ICU medical resources need to implement this strategy,
particularly in the early stage of the pandemic when the number of patients is relatively small.

Discussion
With the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in many countries and regions, a severe shortage of medical resources for
treating the disease is inevitable, potentially leading to a significant death toll. To study the impact of limited medical
resources on the patient mortality at a quantitative level can provide insights into developing optimal resource allocation schemes to reduce the number of deaths. Based on the COVID-19 data, medical resources and other relevant
information, we have developed an admission treatment model subject to limited medical resources, which enables
a quantitative and systematic assessment of the mortality rate associated with various resource allocation scenarios.
Using empirical data from Wuhan and Lombardy, we validate the model by demonstrating that it can reproduce accurately the evolution of daily death toll in both places. The validated model is then used to assess the impact of different
scenarios of medical deployment (including deployment time and resource investment) on the number of deaths. In
general, the ICU resources have a significant impact on the mortality rate, and it is intuitively evident that deploying
11

the ICU resources earlier and/or augmenting them will reduce the death toll. A virtue of our model is that it enables an
accurate quantification of such intuitive expectations. For example, we find that, if the deployment of ICU resources
had been made one week earlier or if they had been doubled, the death toll in Wuhan would have been reduced by 5%
or 13%, and that in Lombardy by 3% and 14%, respectively. If the number of ICU beds had been tripled, the death toll
in both Wuhan and Lombardy would have been reduced by 21%.
Our model enables an accurate prediction of the COVID-19 death toll for any combination of the two parameters:
the amount of advance or delay in the timing of ICU deployment and the enhancement factor of the ICU resources. Our
model asserts that simultaneously advancing the timing of ICU resource deployment and enhancing the ICU resources
will reduce the death toll significantly. For example, if the ICU resources had been augmented by a factor of 2.5 and
deployed two weeks earlier than the actual date, the final death toll would have been reduced by 29% in Wuhan. In
Lombardy, if the number of ICU beds had been three times the actual number and they had been placed into service
one week earlier, the final death toll would have been reduced by 22% and the ICU ward overload days would have
been suppressed to less than one week.
Likewise, our model is fully capable of assessing the impacts of GW resources on COVID-19 mortalities. For
example, if the GW resources in Wuhan had been deployed one week in advance or if the GW resources had been
doubled, the death toll would have been reduced by 10% comparing with the actual toll. However, the model predicts
that deploying GW resources earlier than one week or augmenting them further would have little effect on suppressing
the death toll further. For Lombardy, the GW resources play an even less role in reducing the death toll: augmenting
them or deploying them earlier would reduce the death toll by about 1% at maximum. This indicates that the GW
resources in Lombardy were sufficient. This should be contrasted with the scenario of significantly enhancing the ICU
resources, e.g., by a factor of four, where the death toll would be reduced by 26% and 22% for Wuhan and Lombardy,
respectively. The implication is that, in comparison with the GW resources, the actual ICU resources in Wuhan and
Lombardy were far from sufficient.
The morbidity and mortality of patients infected with COVID-19 increase with age. We have studied the role of
age selective admission and treatment strategies in the death toll. In general, giving admission priorities to patients in
different age groups would result in different mortality rate. In particular, if priorities had been given to the younger
age groups, the number of deaths in Wuhan and Lombardy would have been reduced by 10.4% and 6.7%, respectively,
in comparison with that from the normal FCFS strategy. In contrast, if priority had been given to elderly patients, the
number of deaths would have increased by 11.5% and 5.7% for the two places, respectively.
The optimal admission/treatment strategies also depend on the scale of COVID-19 outbreak, the age structure of
patients in the general population, and the per capita medical resources. We have quantified these effects by defining
the steady-state optimization efficiency E(∞) and calculated this quantity for four countries: China, South Korea, Italy,
and Spain. One finding is that, when the number of patients exceeds a threshold value, the values of E(∞) for the four
countries first rise rapidly with the increase of the epidemic scale and then reaches a peak value. Remarkably, E(∞)
can be maintained at a high value in a wide range of the epidemic scale. The peak values of Italy and Spain are both
lower than 1.2, and the rising rate is slower. However, the peak values of China and South Korea are both close to 1.3.
This discrepancy between the two eastern Asian and two western countries can be explained by the age distribution of
the patients diagnosed with COVID-19: in China and South Korea, less than 12% of the diagnosed patients are over
70 years old, while those in Italy and Spain account for about 35%. The per capita medical resources of South Korea,
Italy and Spain can meet the long term demand of 1000 cases per tens of million people per day, while the caring
capacity of China may be less than half of that of the these countries. This is due to the small number of ICU beds
per capita in China, which is 3.6 per 100000 persons, compared with 12.5, 10.6, and 9.7 in Italy, South Korea, and
Spain, respectively. We conclude that the age-selective admission strategy is more effective in countries with a younger
age structure, while the countries with less per capita ICU medical resources may need to implement this admission
strategy in the early stage of the epidemic when the number of patients is relatively small.
Our model provides a general evaluation framework for assessing, at a quantitative level, the necessary medical
resource deployment and admission strategy. It can be used to predict and articulate, under limited medical resources,
optimal scenarios with respect to resource deployment and hospital admission/treatment strategies to minimize the
death toll for future outbreaks of infectious diseases.

After admission of patients in the C state, the remaining available GW resources are ∆QG (t). There are two cases:
(i) the new resources available are sufficient to accommodate all F-state patients; (ii) new available resources can only
accept some or none of the F-state patients. In these two cases, patients in the F state are admitted according to the
strategy of FCFS (first-come first-serve). The number of F-state patients changing to the G state in (t,t + dt) is denoted
as 4F→G (t).

To get the number of C-state patients admitted to the hospital, we note that there are two admission paths: (a) through
ICU admission II to the U state; (b) through GW admission I to the W state.

There are two cases: (i) the newly available resources are sufficient to accommodate all the C-states patients and (ii)

Supplementary Note 2: Parameter estimation
Average delay and fraction of state transition
As shown in Tab. S1, we assume that the time delay of patients switching from state M to F follows the normal
distribution with the average of five days [17]. The distributions of the time delays associated with other state transitions
are also assumed to be normal. The average time delays from the U state to the D and Gu states are set as seven
days [18, 19] and eight days [18], respectively, and that from the G state to the W state is three days [17]. In our model
setting, the clinical symptoms of the F-state and G-state patients are identical, and the difference lies in whether the
patients are admitted (i.e., occupying GW beds), and the same rule applies to the C-state and W-state patients.
The average time delay from the F to the C state is two days [17, 27], and that from the G and F states to the MX
state is eight days [12]. The average time delays from the W and C states to the D state are assumed to be three days
and one day, respectively.
As shown in Tab. S2, we set the average mortality rate of ICU patients as 61.5% [18, 28]. During the epidemic, due
to the different testing methods and conditions, the fraction of M-state patients in the F state is different in different
time periods. According to the analysis of 32583 cases of laboratory-confirmed patients in Wuhan and reconstruction
of the epidemic trend [29, 4], we divide the epidemic process in terms of the fraction of the transition from the M to the
F state into five stages. As shown in Table S3, the time periods and the transition fractions of the five stages are [29]:
from 8 December 2019 to 10 January 2020 with the fraction |P|M→F (1) = 53.10%; from January 11 to January 22
with |P|M→F (2) = 35.10%; from January 23 to February 1 with |P|M→F (3) = 23.50%; from February 2 to February
16 with |P|M→F (4) = 15.90%; and after February 17 with |P|M→F (5) = 10.30% [29].
For Lombardy, the early epidemic can be divided into three stages [30]. We add a new time point: March 21, 2020,
leading to a division into four stages. After (including) this date, the intervention measures in Lombardy and Italy as
a whole reached maximum [31]. As shown in Table S4, the time periods and the fractions associated with the four
stages are: from 28 January 2020 to 19 February 2020 with |P|M→F (1) = 63%; from February 20 to February 25 with
|P|M→F (2) = 61%; from February 26 to March 20 with |P|M→F (3) = 56% [30]; after March 21 with |P|M→F (4) = 25%.
By using the weighted least-squares method, we obtain the optimal estimates of the parameters. In particular,
for the Wuhan scenario, we obtain the optimal set of parameters Ξ = (|P|F→C , |P|G→W ) by minimizing the sum of
the weighted difference squares between the reported death curve [32, 23] D(ti ) and the model fitting value F(ti , Ξ)
(i = 0, 1, . . . , n − 1), where
b = argmin ∑ wt [F(ti , Ξ) − D(t − i)]2 .
Ξ
i
(27)

To quantify the uncertainties of parameter estimation, we resort to the general bootstrap method [33, 34] and then
obtain the 95% confidence interval of the estimated parameter values. As shown in Tab. S2, the optimal values and
95% confidence interval of the average transition fractions from G-state to W-state and from F-state to C-state in Wuhan
are |P|∗F→C = 48.3%(41.06%, 54.97%) and |P|∗G→W = 27.4%(26.24%, 28.51%), respectively.
For Lombardy, the required optimal parameters are Ξ = (|P|M→F (4), |P|F→C , |P|G→W ). As shown in Tabs. S2 and
S4, the optimal values and the 95% confidence intervals of the average transition fractions in Lombardy are |P|∗M→F =
25% (24.29%, 25.65%), |P|∗F→C = 88.86% (76.8%, 100%), and |P|∗G→W = 63.77% (62.9%, 64.71%), respectively.
Incidence dates estimated from the confirmed data
According to the average time delay from the onset date to the diagnosis date of laboratory-confirmed cases in
the literature [29, 30], we determine the distributions of state transition delay from onset to diagnosis for Wuhan and
Lombardy using a backtracking method based on non-Markov processes that we have developed, where the incidence
dates are deduced from the confirmed cases. We designate a new state, the J state, to denote that a patient has been
confirmed. The dynamic process of J state to M state is described by the following difference equations:
J(τ + dτ;t − dt) = [1 − ωJ→M ]J(τ;t),
ZM (t − dt) =

Z +∞

J(τ;t)ωJ→M (τ)dτand

0

J(0;t − dt) = ZJ (t),

7

(28)

where ωJ→M (τ) is the conditional rate of transition from J to M states with state age τ, with the specific form
ωJ→M (τ) = R +∞
τ

fJ→M (τ)
,
fJ→M (τ0 )dτ0

with fJ→M (τ) being the probability density function of the transition time delay from J state to M state. For Wuhan
and Lombardy, the state transition delays are assumed to follow the Gamma distribution with the mean value of 9.5
and 7.3 days, respectively. The quantities ZM (t) and ZJ (t) are the numbers of new patients in the M and J states in
the time interval (t,t + dt), respectively, where the former is our estimated value and the latter is the newly reported,
daily confirmed data. We validate the accuracy of this method using data from early laboratory-confirmed cases in
Lombardy (January 28-February 27, 2020) [35], as shown in Fig. S7.
There are 50,008 laboratory/clinically confirmed cases in Wuhan, and 93,901 such cases in Lombardy. We use the
same backtracking method to trace the onset time of the non-laboratory confirmed cases. The incidence dates of all
confirmed cases is April 15 for Wuhan and June 30 for Lombardy.
Actual medical resource deployment
In response to an emerging public health event, the government usually adopts the policy of gradual deployment of
medical resources to designated hospitals. The dedicated medical resources in an area typically slowly increase with
time.
As shown in Tabs. S5 and S6, we collect medical resource deployment data dedicated to COVID-19 patients in
Wuhan and Lombardy, which include GW and ICU beds [32, 36]. For Wuhan, we count the number of open beds in
critical hospitals. As the official reports do not distinguish GW beds from ICU beds, we assume that ICU beds account
for 4% of the total beds [37].

Supplementary Note 3: Parameters of medical resource
Health care system stress metrics
In addition to the final number of deaths, the load of local special medical resources for COVID-19 patients is also
an important indicator to measure the stress of the medical system. We simulate and obtain the full-load working days
of GW and ICU in Wuhan and Lombardy during the recovery stage, denoted as OG and OU , respectively. When the
GW or ICU is under full load, no new patients can be admitted.
In Fig. S8, the remaining ICU resources after ICU admission I/II at time t is denoted as 4QU (t), and the corresponding quantity for GW is 4QG (t), which are given by
Z Te

OU =
OG =

Z Te

δ[4QU (t)]dt and
(29)
δ[4QG (t)]dt,

where δ(∗) is the Dirac-δ function, the integration interval is the whole recovery stage, Ts and Te represent the starting
and ending time of the recovery stage, respectively. For example, Ts in Wuhan is December 8, 2019 and Te is April 16,
2020. The time interval is set to be dt = 0.01 day.
Deployment plan of dedicated medical resources for COVID-19
The deployment plan of local officially dedicated medical resources is determined by two key factors: the deployment time DT and resource input RI, where DT is the time for local authorities to start the deployment of the dedicated
medical resources and RI represents the financial and personnel investment of the dedicated medical resources as
characterized by the open GW and ICU beds.
Figure S9 shows the effects of varying ICU deployment plan in Lombardy, where the black curve represents Lombardy’s current dedicated ICU deployment plan. The actual deployment time serves as the benchmark DT = 0 and the
actual resource input is RI = 1. The left blue arrow indicates the scenario where the Lombard authorities had delayed
the deployment time by two weeks (DT = 14 and RI = 1), and the red up arrow corresponds to the scenario where the
official resource input had been increased by 50% (DT = 0 and RI = 1.5).
Effects of varying medical resource deployment on death toll
We study the impacts of varying both GW and ICU resources on the number of deaths. As shown in Tab S7 and
Fig. S10, if resources had been deployed one week in advance, the death toll in Wuhan and Lombardy would have
been reduced by 14% and 3.4%, respectively. If the input of resources had been doubled, the death toll would have
been suppressed by 22% and 15%, respectively. If the deployment had been one week ahead of the actual time and
the input of resources had been doubled, the death toll would have been reduced by 30% and 17% in Wuhan and
Lombardy, respectively, indicating that varying the two factors simultaneously can be more effective at reducing the
death toll. Figure S11 demonstrates the change in the ward overload days when GW deployment is modified while
ICU deployment is unchanged. Figure S12 displays the change in the ward overload days when GW deployment is
unchanged but the ICU deployment plan is modified.

Supplementary Note 4: Estimation of state transition fractions for different age groups
In the main text, we divide the patients in Wuhan and Lombardy into three age groups: [0-69], [70-79] and [80+],
at intervals of 10%. The transition fractions from M state to F state, from G state to W state, from F state to C state and
the ICU mortality rates are different for different age groups. We articulate a linear regression method to estimate the
state transition fractions for different age groups. Take as an example the transition from M state to F state. We first
introduce the matrix of average transition fraction, as (detailed in SN2)


|p|M→F



..
(30)
|P|M→F = 

|p|M→F

where |p|M→F
represents the average transition fraction from M state to F state at stage i. The age distribution of
i
patients in the M state at different stages is
 M

DM =  ...
(31)

M
M
ds,1 · · · ds,y
where di,Mj is the fraction of patients in age group j among all patients at stage i. We then define the matrix of average
transition fraction from M state to F state in different age groups as
RM→F = [r1M→F · · · ryM→F ],

(32)

where rM→F
is the average transition fraction from M state to F state in the jth age group during the whole recovery
j
period.
The parameters can be obtained empirically. We make a linear transformation of matrix RM→F to obtain the
estimation of the fraction of the M-state patients to F-state whose weighted average transition fraction is |P|M→F . The
linear transformation LT of different stages is given by
LT =

|P|M→F

DM · RTM→F

Finally, the transition fractions from M state to F state for different age groups are
 M→F

where the rows represent stages, the columns represent groups, and pi,M→F
denotes the transition fraction from M-state

all one. The patient age distribution matrix DF is

Where R and DM and | P | are known (see Supplementary Table S3 and Supplementary Table S8.). Similarly, we
can obtain the estimation of the transition fractions among other states for different age groups at different stages. To
M = dM = . . . =
simplify the model, we assume that the age distribution of M-state patients at each stage is identical(d1,
j
2, j
M
ds, j , j = 1, 2, . . . , y), as shown in Table S8. The reference transition fraction matrix among the states is also given in
Table S8. Finally, as shown in Fig. S13, we divide the patient population into nine groups.

Supplementary Note 5: A scheme to realize different admission strategies – translation weighting
We have developed a translation weighting scheme to achieve different admission strategies. We set the priority
weight of the ith age group as wi and denote τi as the state age of the ith age group. After weighting, the new state age
τ0i becomes,
τ0i = τi + wi .
(36)
The state age of patients in the age group i is increased by wi units (days). The patients are then admitted according to
the weighted state age under FCFS.
We divide the patients into three age groups, which are patients younger than 70 years old, patients between 70
and 80 years old, and patients older than 80 years. Figure S14 presents examples of several weight combinations. For
example, in Fig. S14(b), the weights of the three age groups are w1 = 0, w2 = 30 and w3 = 0, respectively. The state
ages of the three age groups after weighting are also illustrated.

Supplementary Note 6: Medical resources per capita and the age distribution of confirmed
cases in four countries
We collect data on ward resources per 100,000 people per capita in China, South Korea, Italy and Spain, as well as
the fractions of COVID-19 confirmed cases in each age group, as shown in Tables S9 and S10.

Supplementary Figure S7. Validation of our backtracking method. The validation method is based on the data of
early laboratory-confirmed cases in Lombardy area (January 28 - February 27, 2020). The incidence data of patients
are estimated from the laboratory reported confirmed cases and the distribution of the time delay between the onset
of the disease and the reported confirmation. The blue dots and black crosses represent, respectively, the incidence
estimation curve and the retrospective survey data of laboratory-confirmed cases in the literature [35]. The light blue
shaded region represents the 95% confidence interval of the estimation.

Supplementary Figure S8. Remaining resources of GW and ICU in Wuhan after two admission processes. The
ordinate is on a logarithmic scale, and the red and blue dots indicate that the amounts of remaining resources of Wuhan
ICU and GW at time t are ∆QU (t) and ∆QG (t), respectively. The missing areas of the red and blue dots represent the
period of ∆QU = 0 and ∆QG = 0, respectively.

Supplementary Figure S9. Effects of varying ICU deployment plan in Lombardy, Italy. The black curve shows
Lombardy’s actual ICU medical resource deployment plan, as displayed in Tab. S4. The blue and red curves show the
two cases where Lombardy’s government would delay the deployment of ICU resources by two weeks (DT = 14 and
RI = 1) and the ICU resource is expanded by a factor of 1.5 (DT = 0 and RI = 1.5), respectively.
