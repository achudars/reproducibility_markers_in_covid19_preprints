Abstract
The world-wide lockdown in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in year 2020 led to
economic slowdown and large reduction of fossil fuel CO2 emissions 1,2, but it is unclear
how much it would reduce atmospheric CO2 concentration, the main driver of climate
change, and whether it can be observed. We estimated that a 7.9% reduction in emissions
for 4 months would result in a 0.25 ppm decrease in the Northern Hemisphere CO2, an
increment that is within the capability of current CO2 analyzers, but is a few times smaller
than natural CO2 variabilities caused by weather and the biosphere such as El Nino. We
used a state-of-the-art atmospheric transport model to simulate CO2, driven by a new daily
fossil fuel emissions dataset and hourly biospheric fluxes from a carbon cycle model forced
with observed climate variability. Our results show a 0.13 ppm decrease in atmospheric
column CO2 anomaly averaged over 50S-50N for the period February-April 2020 relative
to a 10-year climatology. A similar decrease was observed by the carbon satellite GOSAT3.
Using model sensitivity experiments, we further found that COVID, the biosphere and
weather contributed 54%, 23%, and 23% respectively. In May 2020, the CO2 anomaly
continued to decrease and was 0.36 ppm below climatology, mostly due to the COVID
reduction and a biosphere that turned from a relative carbon source to carbon sink, while
weather impact fluctuated. This seemingly small change stands out as the largest subannual anomaly in the last 10 years. Measurements at marine boundary layer stations such
as Cape Kumukahi, Hawaii exhibit 1-2 ppm anomalies, mostly due to weather and
biosphere. At city scale, on-road CO2 enhancement measured in Beijing shows reduction of
20-30 ppm, consistent with drastically reduced traffic during the lockdown, while station
data suggest that the expected COVID signal of 5-10 ppm was swamped by weather-driven
variability on multi-day time scales. By contrast, a clear stepwise drop of 10-20 ppm at the
city-wide lockdown was observed in the city of Chengdu where weather is less variable.
The ability of our current carbon monitoring systems in detecting the small and shortlasting COVID signal on the background of fossil fuel CO2 accumulated over the last two
centuries is encouraging. The COVID-19 pandemic is an unintended experiment whose
impact suggests that to keep atmospheric CO2 at a climate-safe level will require sustained
effort of similar magnitude and improved accuracy and expanded spatiotemporal coverage
of our monitoring systems.

The unprecedented world-wide lockdown in the first few months of year 2020 led to wide-spread
reduced economic activities. As a result, fossil fuel CO2 emissions were reduced by 7.9% in the
first 4 months of 2020 due to reduced transportation, industrial and power generation 2 and
anticipated annual reduction of 4-7% 1. This level of emissions reduction is on par with the
annual target set out by the Paris climate agreement, but the COVID-19 induced reduction is
short-lived as economic activities rebounds subsequently. While the lockdown increased
activities such as tele-collaboration that benefit climate, other measures do not lead to
transformation needed in energy systems. Monitoring and understanding such processes from
global to local scales are of critical importance for achieving our climate goals. Over the last few
decades, the scientific community has been developing world-wide carbon monitoring and
information systems aiming at enabling the monitoring and verification of emissions reduction
goals 4-7.
How big is the impact on atmospheric CO2 of this dramatic but short-term reduction in
fossil fuel emissions?
A back-of-the-envelope calculation goes as following. Current fossil fuel emissions rate is 10
GtC y-1 (Gigatonne carbon per year), of which about half is taken up by carbon sinks on land and
in the ocean, with the remaining half left in the atmosphere, resulting in a CO2 increase of 2.5
ppm per year, as observed in a world-wide network of CO2 observatories such as the renowned
Mauna Loa station in Hawaii. Assuming 7% reduction or 0.7 GtC for the whole year of 2020
(high estimate of reference 1), it would cause a 0.18 ppm relative decrease in global atmospheric
CO2 at the end of the year.
In reality, the emissions reduction does not occur uniformly throughout the year, for example,
China in February and Europe, US and India in March-April (Fig. S1). The estimated reduction
of 7.9% in January-April 2020 2 corresponds to a decrease of 0.26 GtC, a rather small quantity
for atmospheric CO2. However, we expect the COVID signal to stay largely in the Northern
Hemisphere (NH) for these few months because atmosphere inter-hemispheric transport takes
approximately one year. We further assume that the carbon sinks have not kicked in because of
dormant winter vegetation and sluggish ocean-atmosphere gas exchange. We therefore expect a
0.25 ppm decrease of Northern Hemisphere CO2 at the end of April. This magnitude of change is
within the capability of today‚Äôs high-accuracy CO2 analyzers, but small for carbon satellites such
as NASA‚Äôs OCO-2 and the Japanese GOSAT with targeted precision of ~1 ppm and their ground
calibration of 0.4 ppm3,8,9.
Challenges also arise from the fact that besides fossil fuel emissions, atmospheric CO2 is also
strongly influenced by the changes in the biosphere and atmospheric transport (weather).
The growth and decay of the northern vegetation causes a seasonal CO2 amplitude of 6 ppm,
while interannual climate variability such as ENSO causes biogenic CO2 changes of 1-3 ppm10-13.
Thus, a key question is whether a 0.25 ppm COVID signal can be seen among other (natural)

3

variabilities. We explored this question with carbon cycle models and a suite of space-borne and
ground-based observations.
Modeling atmospheric CO2 response to emissions reduction and biospheric anomalies
First, we created a high spatial-temporal resolution fossil fuel emissions (ùêπ!" ) dataset with daily
emissions data from a near real time product (updated from Liu et al., (2020)2; see Method). The
daily country-level data was disaggregated to model grid resolution based on the ODIAC
emissions database 14. As seen in Fig. 1a (detailed temporal evolution in Fig. S1-S2), carbon
emissions intensity decreased by more than 5 gC m-2 mo-1 during February-April 2020 in East
Asia, Europe, US and India, relative to the same period in 2019. While consistent with the
temporal variations in the original country-level data 2, the spatially disaggregated data here
further shows emissions reductions concentrated in industrialized regions and areas with high
population density such as the North China Plain, India‚Äôs Ganges Basin, Northeast and Midwest
US, as well as isolated centers such as Sao Paolo.

flux (FTA); (c) atmosphere transport model simulated column CO2 (vertically averaged); (d) Observed column CO2 from GOSAT.
Anomalies in (a) are relative to 2019 while those in (b)-(d) are relative to climatology of 2010-2019. Fluxes are in gC m-2 mo-1,
and CO2 in ppm. Locations in (c) are selected ground CO2 observation stations for model-data comparison.

For terrestrial biosphere-atmosphere flux (ùêπ#$ ), we used a dynamic vegetation and terrestrial
carbon cycle model VEGAS 10,15, while ocean-atmospheric flux came from a multi-model
product (see Method). The biospheric fluxes (Fig. 1b) have regional variations often larger than
ùêπ!" reduction, driven by climate variability. Overall, the terrestrial biosphere had wide-spread
negative anomalies that was particularly strong in April (Fig. S3). As a result, the spatial pattern
of net flux ùêπ%&' was dominated by biospheric fluxes.
Interestingly, when summed up
globally, the magnitude of 2020
ùêπ!" anomaly relative to 10-year
climatology is comparable to
that of ùêπ#$ (Fig. 2a), each about
50 MtC mo-1 decrease by April
2020. This is because fossil fuel
emissions are reduced almost
everywhere during COVID-19
lockdown, whereas the positive
and negative anomalies in ùêπ#$
tend to cancel out.
Consequently, the total flux
anomaly Fnet reaches -100 MtC
mo-1.

column CO2 data, both averaged for land area between 50S-50N to make them as
comparable as possible. Vertical shading of February-May 2020 indicates the ‚ÄòCOVID-19
period‚Äô.

These fluxes were then used to
drive the community GEOSChem atmospheric transport model for the period of January 2008-May 2020 (see Method). The
output of the model is a 4-dimensional depiction of spatial-temporal evolution of atmospheric
CO2 that can be compared to various types of CO2 observations, as well as expected COVID
impact (Fig. S4-S7). Using a method termed DCA (Detrended Climatology and Anomaly; see
Method), in which a CO2 time series is detrended to remove the low-frequency signal and
climatological seasonal cycle, we calculated sub-annual anomalies of column CO2, shown in Fig.
2b. After a large positive anomaly in Jan 2020, the CO2 anomaly trended downward, and was
0.19 ppm lower than long-term climatology in March-April 2020, and 0.36 ppm lower in May
(Fig. 2b shaded period). This anomaly is twice the second lowest monthly value in July 2016 and
stands out among the past 10 years, and particularly so for the same season.
Observations from carbon satellite
The Japanese GOSAT carbon satellite, launched in 2009, has collected column CO2 (XCO2) data
for over 10 years. The spatial pattern of February-April 2020 GOSAT anomalies (Fig. 1d) are
similar to the model over India, southern Africa, South America and central US where large

negative values are wide-spread, though the overall spatial correlation is modest and significant
sign differences exist near the northern edge in Eurasia (Fig. 1 c and d). Detailed monthly
evolution shows similar broad patterns of agreement as well as larger detailed differences (Fig.
S8 vs. S9). In a sense, the differences are expected because of satellite‚Äôs sparse spatial-temporal
sampling, particularly at higher latitudes and cloudy regions. However, the signal-to-noise ratio
is enhanced via spatial-temporal averaging: the time series of CO2 anomalies averaged over 50S50N (Fig. 2b) shows reasonable agreement. Most encouragingly, the drop in 2020 stands out
both in model and GOSAT.
To better appreciate how unusual year 2020 was, we plotted the CO2 seasonal cycle from May
2019 to April 2020 against those of the previous 10 years (Fig. 3). The 50S-50N land average
CO2 for especially March-April is outside the standard deviation as well as the envelope of the
previous 10 individual years for both model and GOSAT. Such agreement lends confidence in
using both model and satellite column CO2 for short-term anomaly detection. We also analyzed
data at smaller scales including the NH 0-50N where strongest COVID-signal is expected. The
model shows clear negative anomaly but the corresponding GOSAT signal is not as statistically
significant as in 50S-50N (Fig. S10), likely due to increase in noise towards smaller scales. The
more robust 50S-50N signal has contribution from GOSAT‚Äôs ability to capture the anomalies in
the Southern Hemisphere which is largely a biospheric signal. Similarly, a large decrease in
GOSAT anomaly for Eastern China in February 2020 (Fig. S11), though may be partly related to
COVID reduction, is not statistically robust.

Attribution of the 2020 CO2 drawdown to the biosphere, weather, and COVID reduction
We conducted two additional
model sensitivity experiments to
delineate the effects of biosphere,
atmospheric transport (weather),
and COVID reduction in ùêπ!" (See
Method and aspects of the detailed
result in Fig. S4-S7). The
monthly evolution of CO2
anomalies from these experiments
(Fig. 4) indicate that the roles of
the biosphere, weather, and
COVID vary from month to month.

February and April, all in comparison
with 2019 by model design. Averaged over February-April, the biosphere contributed 0.030,
weather 0.029, and COVID 0.069 ppm, leading to a February-April average of 0.128 ppm CO2
drawdown with March and April both about 0.18 ppm. By percentage, the biosphere, weather,
and COVID contributed 23%, 23%, and 54%, respectively. In May 2020, all three factors
contributed to CO2 drawdown, leading to a rapid decrease to 0.36 ppm.
In summary, the three factors impacted CO2 in an intricate way. In the period February-May
2020, the biosphere was recovering from a large carbon loss (relative to climatology) from year
2019, mostly in South America, Africa, and Australia in response to a moderate El Nino10, with
additional CO2 uptake from Northern Hemisphere including South Asia and Siberia (Fig. S3).
COVID emissions reduction was the most spatiotemporally consistent factor, contributing to
majority of the CO2 decrease. The weather impact on CO2 fluctuated from month to month. The
weather effect is not predominant because its variability tends to be averaged out on global
scales. Its importance rises at smaller scales to which we turn our attention now.
CO2 changes at surface atmosphere background stations
Similar to the global-scale analysis above, we also analyzed data from atmospheric background
CO2 stations from the NOAA global reference network ObsPack 16 (see Method). Fig. 5
compares model with surface observation at five marine boundary layer stations that span the

7

remote Pacific region from North
to South. Flask sampling at these
sites is carefully conducted to
represent atmospheric
background concentrations on the
scale of hundreds to thousands of
kilometers. Among these stations
is Cape Kumukahi, Hawaii
(KUM), a site downslope of the
Mauna Loa observatory, but is
better than Mauna Loa at
capturing large-scale atmosphere
background signal and more
comparable with model which
does not resolve the island.
The anomalies at Kumukahi are
relatively small in February and
March, 2020, but decrease
rapidly to lower than -1 ppm in
April. Model and observation are
broadly similar, in particular, the
decrease in April. It is tempting
to associate this drop with
COVID reduction. However, a
closer look at model sensitivity

+1 ppm from the biosphere and a
similarly large negative anomaly from weather in March. Of the total CO2 drop of 1 ppm in April,
0.5 comes from biosphere, 0.5 from weather, and only 0.2 ppm from COVID.
Unlike a decrease in Hawaii, CO2 at Barrow, Alaska (BRW) shows an increase in early 2020,
while Midway Island in the North Pacific Ocean (MID) has a decrease in February-March and
rebound in April, both attributable to the biosphere and/or weather (Fig. S12). Thus, while the
sub-annual signal of 1-2 ppm at these marine surface stations is a few times larger than global
mean column anomalies seen by the satellite, the variability at a given station is dominated by
the biosphere and weather. Nevertheless, the 0.1~0.2 ppm decrease due to COVID-19, though

8

smaller than biospheric and weather effect, are separable using model, and is consistent with the
global-scale COVID induced drop discussed above. The overall consistency between model and
station observations suggests the ability of both model and observation in capturing these subannual changes, regardless of the origin, thus lending support for interpreting the signal using
model experiments.
City-scale CO2 changes
Because major fraction of
emissions comes from cities with
high human activities, one can
expect large COVID signal in
urban CO2 data. Thus, we analyzed
CO2 measurements in Beijing and
Chengdu.

winter‚Äôs atmosphere was less
‚Äòventilated‚Äô. February was dominated by two high-CO2 weather events, one in each year. The
expected low CO2 values due to COVID in January-February (Fig. 6b) ‚Äòpredicted‚Äô by the model
do not have a clear correspondence in the weather-dominated CO2 fluctuations, and in general,
the modeled magnitude of change is much smaller than the variability. During March-April, the
difference between the two years decreases to much smaller values. It is tempting to explain this
difference as the result of emissions reduction, but it is mostly brought about by weather regime
shift in the spring season with dominantly northwesterly wind from Mongolian Plateau. Thus,
although COVID-19 signal is large, it is ‚Äòburied‚Äô in even larger weather noise. Other cities are
similarly dominated by weather (Fig. S13), for example, a monthly drop of 1-2 ppm at New
York City and Delhi, an increase of 1-2 ppm in Washington DC and Paris.
Interestingly, CO2 measured at the city of Chengdu shows a stepwise drop on January 24, the day
before traditional Chinese Lunar New Year, followed by city-wide lockdown with little urban
activity for the next 1-2 months (Fig. 7). The difference between the month before and after the
lockdown is 20-30 ppm and the temporal characteristics is consistent with a COVID signal.
Concurrent particulate matter (PM2.5) measurements support this interpretation because the

9

short-lived PM2.5 has similar pattern on timescales shorter than a few days, but it has much less
monthly and longer timescale variations compared to CO2.
Why is the COVID signal relatively clear in Chengdu, but not in Beijing? The answer lies in the
differences in weather. Chengdu, situated within the Sichuan Basin in southwestern China, is
surrounded by great mountain ranges including the Tibetan Plateau and has generally very calm
weather with a famously known atmospheric inversion layer that is rarely broken17, whereas
Beijing, being at the edge of the North China Plain is subject to large weather fluctuations,
frontal passages and seasonal shifts. Thus, while weather tends to dominate in Beijing, its
variation is sufficiently small in Chengdu to allow COVID signal to be revealed.

Figure 7. Hourly CO2 and PM2.5 measured in Chengdu, a city in the Sichuan Basin to the east of Tibet plateau. An abrupt drop on
Jan 24, 2020, following the Lunar New Year and city-wide lockdown is clearly visible.

Direct observation of on-road CO2 concentration has been conducted in Beijing periodically
since 2017 using mobile platforms18,19 (See Method). Some of these ‚ÄòCO2-tracking‚Äô trips took
advantage of light-weight low-cost CO2 sensors20. Three trips were selected from before, during,
and after the COVID-19 lockdown while minimizing differences in other factors such as weather
condition, rush hour, and weekend effects. The average CO2 is 513 ppm before, 455 ppm during,
and 501 after the height of lockdown (Fig. 8). To further remove the compounding effect of still
somewhat differing weather conditions, we subtracted CO2 concentration measured at the IAP
tower station. This difference can be thought as a traffic-induced on-road ‚ÄòCO2 enhancement‚Äô
relative to a ‚Äòcity background‚Äô. This ‚Äòtraffic enhancement‚Äô is 65, 30 and 50 ppm respectively for
the three periods. The more than 30 ppm less traffic CO2 during COVID, and still somewhat
depressed value during recovery is consistent with direct traffic data, not surprisingly, because

10

the reduced transportation is the largest source of CO2 reduction during lockdown in cities.

Figure 8. On-road CO2 concentration measured before, during and after COVID-19 lockdown in Beijing. These ‚ÄòCO2 tracking‚Äô car
trips covered the city‚Äôs 4 major transportation arteries, from the Second (innermost) to the Fifth Ring Road. The west-east
distance of the Fifth Ring Road is about 30 km. Each dot is 1-minute average of the original 1s or 2s data. Station data from the
IAP tower, marked by black triangle, is used as ‚Äòcity background‚Äô to compute on-road enhancement in the text.

Discussion
The detectability of COVID-19 CO2 signal depends strongly on spatial and temporal scales. Our
results show that the carbon satellite GOSAT is able to detect a short-term global mean CO2
anomaly decrease of 0.2-0.3 ppm, a number below the satellite instrument‚Äôs targeted accuracy of
individual measurements. This somewhat surprising result is made possible by spatial and
temporal averaging to compensate for the sampling sparsity, and importantly also by the
cancellation of biosphere and weather variability at large-scale. As a result, the drop in globalscale CO2 anomalies was dominated by the spatially coherent COVID emissions reduction,
followed by a biospheric recovery from previous year‚Äôs relative carbon loss, which became more
important in the spring season, while weather impact fluctuated. One implication for detection is
the need for meticulous approaches in enhancing signal-to-noise ratio and maximizing spatialtemporal data coverage21,22. A critical perspective here is the focus on sub-annual time scale
which has received little attention in the past compared to the much larger CO2 seasonal cycle
and interannual variability. Our results suggest that current observation and modeling capabilities
can depict sub-annual variations with some consistency, and the COVID period has the largest
sub-annual CO2 anomaly in the last 10 years.
Surface observations of the atmospheric background CO2 concentration have variabilities up to
1-2 ppm, substantially larger than the ~0.2 ppm COVID fossil signal. However, the modeling
results are sufficiently realistic in capturing sub-annual variabilities consistent with station
observations, lending support in using model experiments to separate the COVID effect from the
larger weather and biospheric variability.

11

At urban scale in many cities such as Beijing, New York City and Paris, atmospheric variability
dominates the signal. Seasonal variations in weather patterns prevented us from discerning the
COVID signal with confidence despite of the large fossil fuel emissions changes expected there.
A major caveat is that the model resolution is too coarse to resolve the cities properly and the
real signal is likely stronger than seen here and it would be better simulated by meso-scale
models. Moreover, where weather variability is modest such as in Chengdu, the lockdown
caused a clear CO2 reduction. Additionally, decrease in on-road CO2 enhancement larger than 20
ppm in Beijing was observed which is perhaps the most direct observation of localized emissions
reduction.
Despite of the dramatic reduction in economic activities during 2020 COVID-19 worldwide
lockdown, the short-duration of the event has left only a small signature in the atmospheric CO2
which results from fossil fuel emissions accumulated over two hundred years due to CO2‚Äôs long
life-time in the atmosphere. Nevertheless, our analysis demonstrates that its global-to-local
impacts are already detectable, albeit still imprecisely, by current carbon monitoring systems
using a variety of approaches, and that meaningful causality attribution to fossil fuel, biosphere
and weather can be made by combining model and observations. Continued improvement and
expansion of such capabilities can play a critical role in monitoring and verification of fossil fuel
emissions reduction target at local, country, and global scales. They can also facilitate climate
mitigation efforts from governments, cities, institutions and citizens.

where (' ! is the atmospheric CO2 growth rate, ùêπ!" is fossil fuel emissions, ùêπ#$ is terrestrial to
atmosphere flux, ùêπ*$ is ocean to atmosphere flux, and ùêπ%&' is net surface to atmosphere flux. The
model is run in a ‚Äòforward‚Äô fashion for each 3-dimensional model grid point (location), forced by
the three fluxes, as well as meteorological variables for atmospheric transport and mixing. Here
we use GEOS-Chem atmosphere transport model v12.5.0 (http://acmg.seas.harvard.edu/geos/) at
a horizontal resolution of 4o√ó5o with 47 vertical levels. The fluxes (below) at different
resolutions are re-gridded to 4o√ó5o. The model is driven by the meteorology field MERRA2 from
the NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office. Details of setup and evaluation were
described earlier23,24. The simulation period was from 1 January 2008 to 31 May 2020, and data
after January 2010 were used for analysis.
Fossil fuel CO2 emissions
ùêπ!" combines a number of sources, including the Global Carbon Project (GCP) annual countrylevel carbon budget for 1959-2018 25 with update for 2019 by Le Quere et al. (2020) 1, daily data
for 2019-2020 from Liu et al. (2020)2, the TIMES hourly scaling factor of Nassar et al. (2013) 26,
and the spatial information of the ODIAC database of Oda et al. (2018) 14.
Recently, a daily resolution, country-level data became available 2. This novel dataset achieved
daily resolution by taking advantage of a variety of sector-based energy and economic activity
statistics, including real-time traffic data and daily electricity generation data of major power
suppliers. However, the Liu et al. (2020) data was available only for early 2019 and 2020, and
for this work, it was updated to cover the period of Jan 2019 through May 2020. For the years
2008-2018 when we do not have daily resolution data, we use the 2019‚Äôs daily variation as a
surrogate but retain their annual total. Because the emissions of Liu et al. (2020) for 2019-2020
are slightly different from GCP, in order to maintain the consistency of ùêπ!" from 2018 to 20192020, we use the country-level GCP fossil fuel values as a constrain to rescale the yearly total
ùêπ!" from 2008 to 2020, and the same scaling factor for 2019 is used for 2020 to obtain a
harmonized time series. Further, we combine the diurnal scaling factor from the TIMES method
of Nassar et al.26 and the daily national CO2 emissions of 2019 of Liu et al. 2 to obtain an hourly
country-level CO2 emission in 2019 and 2020.
The gridded spatial information comes from the Open source Data Inventory of Anthropogenic
CO2 emission (ODIAC) 14. ODIAC uses the annual country-level fuel consumption bases CO2
emissions estimates 27 and disaggregate to 1 km or 1 degree resolution using satellite night light

observations and point source data. The annual data was disaggregated to monthly based on a
climatological seasonal cycle. Here we simply disaggregated the country-level hourly data above
to 1o√ó1o with the spatial information of ODIAC. Since COVID-19 reduction is more
concentrated in cities with major reduction in transportation2,28, this disaggregation in proportion
to ODIAC‚Äôs spatial pattern may underestimate the reduction in metropolitan regions.
Altogether, the method can be summarized in the following equation for 2008~2018:

LZ, with LZ for our updated Liu et al. (2020) dataset.

The terrestrial biospheric flux
ùêπ#$ is simulated by a dynamic vegetation and terrestrial carbon cycle model VEGAS 10,15. The
model is forced by observed climate variables including monthly precipitation, hourly
temperature and radiation, and historical land use pattern as well as atmospheric CO2. The model
was run at hourly time step and 0.5o√ó0.5o resolution from 1901 to Apr 2020. This version 2.6 of
VEGAS follows largely the simulation protocol of the TRENDY 29 and the MsTMIP 30 terrestrial
model intercomparison projects with some model and near real time (NRT) forcing data updates.
Carbon cycle models have been applied to long-term, interannual and seasonal variations
extensively, but rarely in sub-annual changes of interest here. VEGAS has been shown to be
among the models better at simulating such short-term changes 31,32.
The ocean-atmosphere carbon flux
ùêπ*$ uses the spatial pattern of pCO2 observation derived fluxes of Takahashi et al. (2009)33. To
obtain the temporal variation, we rescaled the Takahashi spatial pattern for the year 2013 with
the temporal evolution of ùêπ*$ from the GCP annual carbon budget analysis which is based on
estimates from multiple ocean carbon cycle models 25. The carbon budget was up to only 2018.
For the year of 2019 and 2020, the GCP ocean values are linearly extrapolated using the values
from the previous 10 years. The annual carbon budget thus does not contain possible sub-annual
contribution from ocean, which is generally believed to be small compared to land and fossil flux
anomalies.

To delineate contribution to CO2 changes from fossil fuel emissions ùêπ!" , biospheric flux ùêπ#$ ,
and weather, we designed three sets of experiments:
1. BWC (Biosphere+Weather+COVID): the full experiment described above with
realistically varying biospheric fluxes ùêπ#$ , weather, and ùêπ!" including COVID-induced
emissions reduction.
2. BW (Biosphere+Weather, no COVID): as in BWC, but replace ùêπ!" of 2020 with that of
2019.
3. B (Biosphere only): as in BW, but replace all years‚Äô meteorology (wind, etc.) with that of
2019.
Thus, compared to BWC, Experiment BW removes the effect of COVID emissions, while
Experiment B further removes weather effect. The differences among these experiments show
the effect on CO2 of each individual factor. In Fig. 4, anomaly for experiment B is calculated as
detrended anomaly, while those of BW and BWC represent the differences between 2020 and
2019, following the experiment design.
CO2 observations: satellite column CO2 from GOSAT
The satellite column CO2 data is Level-3 product from the National Institute for Environmental
Studies (NIES) 22 (http://www.gosat.nies.go.jp/en/about_5_products.html). The L3 data derived
from the L2 data with spatial interpolation using Kriging technique. The data is at 2.5 o√ó2.5 o
resolution, available from August 2009 to April 2020. There are 3 months of missing data
(December 2014, January 2015 and December 2018), which were gap-filled with spline method.
There are known biases in oceanic glint data, so we only used land data in our analysis. For this
reason, regional average analyses in such as Fig. 2b are over land only for both model and
GOSAT to facilitate comparison. Additional uncertainty comes from missing GOSAT data in
regions such as the core of the Amazon due to persistent cloud cover and the northern boundaries
where large solar zenith angle may lead to larger uncertainty (e.g., Fig. 15 of reference 22).
Global network of surface CO2 observations
The surface station data are from the ObsPack framework 16 that collects a great variety and
numbers of in-situ, flask sampling, aircraft and other CO2 measurements. The five stations data
used in our analysis are all flask sampling data. These are baseline stations managed by NOAA
that have been in operation for several decades. Great care is taken to sample air representative
of large-scale atmospheric background condition. Data product used here is GLOBALVIEW+5.0,
with most recent update ObsPack NRT V5.0 provided by NOAA‚Äôs CarbonTracker team34,35. The
most recent year‚Äôs data have been quality-controlled by an automated procedure, and they may
still be subject to modifications from further manual quality control.
City CO2 station observations
A network of 6 tower stations using high accuracy Picarro CO2 analyzers has been running since
2018 as part of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (JJJ) carbon monitoring project 19, run by the Chinese
Meteorological Administration (CMA) and the Institute of Atmospheric Physics (IAP) of the

Chinese Academy of Sciences. The CO2 analyzers are calibrated 4 times a day, with calibration
gas tracing to World Meteorological Organization (WMO) standard. The data have a nominal
accuracy of 0.1 ppm. A network of low-cost CO2 sensors has been running in various stages of
development since 2016, as a collaborative effort between IAP, the University of Maryland, and
the US National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST). These sensors were found to be
able to achieve an accuracy of ~5 ppm after calibration and environmental correction20. The data
used in this paper for Beijing stations are measured with Picarros while the data in Chengdu was
from a low-cost sensor node with 3 individual CO2 sensors.
On-road CO2 observation in Beijing before, during and after COVID-19 lockdown
We conducted several on-road CO2 measurements in Beijing and surrounding area using mobile
platforms before, during and after COVID-19 lockdown. Because urban CO2 concentration is
strongly influenced by weather, we selected three trips with closest weather as possible for the
days of February 20 of 2019, February 21 of 2020, May 9 of 2020. Additionally, we calculate the
on-road CO2 enhancement relative to a city ‚Äòbackground‚Äô measured at the IAP tower station. We
used CO2 sensors of different accuracy including Picarro and LI-COR LI-7810, both mounted
inside car with air inlet from above roof 18. We also used low-cost sensors mounted on
windshield, calibrated before and after each trip19. Some of the sensors were in the same car with
Picarro and their agreement was found to be within 5 ppm.
Analysis of CO2: separate sub-annual anomalies from trend and seasonal cycle
Atmospheric CO2 data contains variability on a variety of time scales, from long-term increasing
trend driven by fossil fuel emissions and carbon sinks 36, Decadal variations 37, interannual
variability dominated by ENSO 10, to a prominent seasonal cycle 15,38 in response to the annual
growth and decay of the biosphere. The possible COVID-19 signal of interest here lasts for few
months on sub-annual (month to intra-seasonal) timescales. Monthly-scale high-frequency
variabilities are generally less well studied and are often filtered out so as to focus on seasonal
and longer-term changes 39.
Here we calculate sub-annual anomalies using a 4-step ‚Äòdetrended anomaly‚Äô approach termed
DCA (Detrending, Climatology, Anomaly):
1) A 12-month running mean is applied to the original CO2 data. The running mean contains
mostly signals longer than a year, including long-term trend, interannual to decadal variations
(Fig. 9a)
2) This running mean is then subtracted from the original CO2 data. The result is considered
‚Äòdetrended‚Äô and is dominated by seasonal cycle (Fig. 9b black line)
3) A climatology is then calculated as the mean seasonal cycle (Fig. 9b green line).
4) The sub-annual anomalies (detrended anomalies) is the difference between the detrended
CO2 and its climatology

The approach using running mean
to remove low-frequency signals
has been used by various authors,
e.g., to study the CO2 seasonal
amplitude change 15. The last two
steps consist of a standard
definition of climatology and
anomaly. In comparison to the
DCA method, the standard
climatology/anomaly method
(simply called CA method here)
does not involve detrending, and it
retains low-frequency signal.
Therefore, the DCA method is
suitable for finding CO2 subannual anomalies, while the CA
method is used for flux analysis
such as in Fig. 2a which contains
both interannual and sub-seasonal
information.
