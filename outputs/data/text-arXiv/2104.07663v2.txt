Tourist route optimization in the context of
Covid-19 pandemic
Cristina Maria Păcurar ∗, Ruxandra-Gabriela Albu †and Victor-Dan Păcurar
Abstract: The paper presents an innovative method for tourist route planning inside a destination. The necessity of reorganizing the tourist routes within
a destination comes as an immediate response to the Covid-19 crisis. The implementation of the method inside tourist destinations can bring an important
advantage in transforming a destination into a safer destination in times of
Covid-19 and post-Covid-19. The existing trend of shortening the tourist stay
length has been accelerated while the epidemic became a pandemic. Moreover, the wariness for future pandemics has brought into spotlight the issue of
overcrowded attractions inside a destination at certain moments. The method
presented in this paper proposes a backtracking algorithm, more precisely an
adaptation of the travelling salesman problem. The method presented is aimed
to facilitate the navigation inside a destination and to revive certain less-visited
sightseeing spots inside a destination while facilitating conformation with the
social distancing measures imposed for Covid-19 control.

Introduction

At the end of December 2019, a new strain of coronavirus emerged in Wuhan,
China. The new coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2 in February 2020, causes
the Covid-19 disease, which has affected, at a steady pace, the entire world.
Currently, almost every country in the world has reported cases of Covid-19.
The pandemic has affected in a different proportion every industry and sector.
Among them, one of the industries which is severely and most probably longterm affected is the tourism industry.
The effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on tourism can be acknowledged at
many different levels. The measures taken worldwide to prevent the spreading

of the disease have affected all possibilities of travel and forced many people to
cancel their trips or postpone them to a later unknown date.
The lock-downs and numerous restrictions imposed by governments have
thrown many tourism-related businesses into collapse. Therefore, since international travel still comes with significant restrictions and poses great threats
in many places around the world, the revival of tourism will mostly relate to
national, or regional, maybe even local tourism.
On the other hand, the Covid-19 pandemic will leave significant marks on
the way people travel. The most visited spots in a destination, which are usually
overly crowded, require special attention and immediate reorganization.
Travel restrictions will continue to revolutionize the idea of tourism as we
know it, both from the point of view of the providers of tourism, as well as from
the tourists’ point of view.
We propose a method for organizing tourist routes inside a destination in
accordance with the objective of shortening the tourist stay length, which has
been an increasing trend even before the Covid-19 pandemic. For the local
community, the implementation of this method would bring advantages related
to each of the three sustainable development dimensions, namely the reduction
of the negative effects brought by overcrowding the destination, the possibility
of continuing the tourism business, while the current global crisis generated by
Covid-19 is ongoing and altogether maintaining the incidence rate of the new
coronavirus low and ensuring the inhabitants’ health.
The method we propose is based on a backtracking algorithm to find the
optimal route to take for visiting a certain number of attractions inside a destination. In order to find this optimal route (in terms of minimal length or
duration), we adapted the algorithm used for the traveling salesman problem.

Literature review

According to Chang et al. (see [1]) the future of tourism in the COVID-19
era is uncertain, the pandemics affecting not only humans’ healthiness but even
more the global economy and the very fabric of society. Consequently, there is
a critical need for new research aimed to identify the best solutions for reviving
the tourism industry, one of the economic sectors highly affected by the present
sanitary crisis.
The unique relationship between tourism and sustainable development derives from the outstanding peculiarity of this economic activity that sells the
physical and human environment as its product. In our opinion, there is one certain continuity element, as important in the future as it was before the COVID
pandemics’ outbreak, the need for tourist destination management based on
sustainable development principles. Overcrowding of certain destinations is an
old problem in tourism, changing in time the structural types of visitors and
finally spoiling the attractivity of this destination (see [2, 3, 4, 5]).
The appropriate spatial planning and its subsequent tourist flux optimisation
play a key role in preventing or reducing tourist overloading and its negative

2

effects.
The problems of overcrowding and extremely high concentration of human
traffic are increased to a peak in urban areas, and these are referring to both
tourism and anti-pandemics regulations. Cities are hot spots in the present
Coronavirus crisis, being associated with the highest risk of infection and, consequently, these destinations are confronting the strongest reduction of visitors
and, most probably, here, the effects of the sanitary crisis, especially on people’s
mentality, will be long-lasting.
Within the sustainable development paradigm, tourism is one peculiar industry, dependent on the natural and anthropic potential and the cultural heritage
as well. Tourism sells these assets, but at the same time, shares these and
additional resources with other stakeholders, among whom local communities
are of utmost importance. It is essential for tourism to be actively involved
in sustainable development and to cooperate with the other industries for preserving the quality of those resources essential for tourism activity. Sustainable
development is basically an intrinsic necessity for tourism, involving the need of
reducing the negative economic, social or ecological effects and their mitigation
can only be achieved through professional management, which attracts in the
decision-making process all the factors engaged in the development of tourism
(see [6]).
On the other hand, tourism can bring risks and opportunities for local communities as a study undertaken by UNWTO and IPSOS, in 2019, asserts (see
[7]). The survey, which collected 12 000 answers from 15 countries, was aimed at
a better understanding of the residents’ perceptions towards city tourism, its impact and the management strategies. The survey shows that 47% of respondents
consider that in their cities there are numerous visitors, with 52% indicating that
tourism has an important beneficial economic impact (moderate or big). From
the interviewed subjects, 46% thought tourism ”creates overcrowding”, while
49% indicated that measures should be implemented for better tourism management, including improved infrastructure and facilities (72%), expanded offer
of attractions, for both locals and visitors (71%), and ensuring that the local
community benefits from tourism (65%).
Presently, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted in September 2015 by the General UN Assemble, could be considered the document drawing the canvas of the global environmental consciousness. More specifically, the
seventeen Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) are presenting the correspondent directions for human society evolution in a green fashion, harmonised with
the principles of natural heritage preservation and natural resources sustainable management. As concerns urban areas development, among the Agenda‘s
SDG’s, there is one especially targeting it (SDG 11- Sustainable cities and communities), that clearly states the urgent need for significantly transforming the
way we build and manage our urban spaces, where it is already living more than
a half of human population, and this share is estimated to increase at two-thirds
of all humanity (6.5 billion people) at the middle of this century (see [8, 9]).
Based on the 2030 Agenda, one year later, at the following global summit on urbanization (the United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustain3

able Urban Development, at Quito, Ecuador, October 2016), the world leaders
adopted the New Urban Agenda which sets global standards for sustainable urban development, requiring a new approach in cities development, from design
to maintenance and lifestyle, thus implying effective cooperation of all the essential stakeholders (authorities and private sector, civil society and individual
households).
Sustainable Urban Tourism has been the main subject of numerous studies
(see [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]). The new global Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs), adopted by the World Leaders in 2015 affirm (in Goal 11) that
future cities must be inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable (see [8]). Certainly,
the safety component, in the previous listing, has added new constraints related
to the present pandemic crisis (social distancing etc.). One could say that the
old overcrowding issues require even more enhanced attention. Tourist overloading could be induced by the differences between accommodation demand and
supply, or by the spatial concentration of the lodging facilities. These problems
could be tackled by infrastructure development combined with an efficient promotion of the new facilities and services, because finally the subjective approach
of the potential visitors, their informed choice would make the difference. This
tourist choice question is even more important as regards the tourist traffic inside the destination, highly important especially in urban areas, where the list
of tourist objectives and attractions could be short, and consequently, there is a
potential risk of congestion points occurrence, extremely dangerous during pandemics. Most probably in the present situation the majority of tourists is highly
conscious of the importance of avoiding overcrowded places. Tourists would finally decide where, when and how they will travel and visit the objectives of
interest (see [18]).
Lately, urban tourism experienced an intense development. This increased
interest for visiting different cities (not only the widely known great metropolises,
popular for tourists over centuries) is related to both professional travelling (for
business, congresses, conferences etc.) and also to personal tourism targeting
cultural, art or leisure interests. (see [19]). Tourism management could increase
the demand for urban holidays, by developing new attractive locations, events,
facilities, in order to draw an increased attention of domestic and international
visitors (see [20]). All those development plans must follow a sustainable development policy that can play a global role in tourism attractiveness, contributing
especially to the recognition of its urban context (see [21]).
Tourism spatial planning has been in the spotlight for a long time and many
studies have tackled this topic (see [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]).
Route planning is an area of interest for many studies, as it is a key aspect
in providing (or obtaining - if regarded from the tourist’s point of view) an
improved travel experience. There have been many research papers concerning
route planning. The main findings in the literature regarding methods used in
route planning are presented in Table 1.
Even though route planning based on looking at the routes inside a destination as a graph has been used in previous studies, the shortest path algorithms
proposed in those researches (such as improved Floyd algorithm in [52]) result in

finding the optimal route between two nodes, more precisely, the shortest path
between sightseeing spots in a destination. However, tourism in smaller destinations needs to exploit all the small attractions one might find along a certain
route. Thus, our method, which involves the use of a backtracking algorithm
has two main useful novelties. Firstly, using the backtracking algorithm allows
the establishment of an optimal path in a destination that crosses through a
certain number of attractions. Secondly, the backtracking algorithm returns all
the possible ways of planning the route while finding the shortest one. This is
highly advantageous in the context of Covid-19, as overcrowded spots need to be
reorganized, and choosing the optimal route is not only dependent on the length
of the path, but it should also look at reducing the number of people present in
a place, at a certain time, in order to diminish the risk of disease-spreading.
We consider that the tourist destination management structures (DMOs),
must include in the destination development strategy, for the post-pandemics
period, clear solutions for the safe access of tourists to the important tourist

5

objectives, thus also enabling the small businesses to resume their economic
activities at a level at least similar to that before the pandemics (if possible,
increased activity would be welcome for partly compensating the 2020-2021
losses).

Materials and Method

We have chosen to test our method for the city of Bras, ov, Romania, one of the
major cities in Transilvania and the biggest in the centre region of Romania.
Bras, ov is one of the most important economic, cultural and sports centers in
the country, being a significant tourist destination and a historic city, with
numerous tourist attractions, such as: the Black Church, the First Romanian
School, Saint Nicholas Church, S, chei’s Gate, Catherine’s Gate, the Citadel, a.o.
As a tourist destination, Bras, ov has experienced in the past years an increasing
trend as regards the number of tourists.
However, the current situation has seriously affected the tourist industry in
Bras, ov, especially in the period March-May 2020, when the tourism dropped
close to zero as a result of the lock-down caused by Covid-19.
Like many places around the world, Brasov has been greatly affected by the
Covid-19 pandemic. The decrease in the number of tourists has been significant
as can be seen from Figure 1. The graph in Figure 1 is based on data from [53],
extracted from the database TUR104H.

Figure 1: Effect of Covid-19 on tourism in Brasov
For a comparative study on the attractivity of Brasov before and during the
pandemic see [54].
We believe that in order to face the current situation and revive tourism, new
innovative methods must be identified and employed to transform the tourist
offer, according to the changes in the hierarchy of the motivational elements that
determine people to visit a certain destination (safety rules and other measures

6

imposed by authorities to prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are the
priority now).

The method employed aims to find the shortest way of passing through a
number of attractions s which must be chosen between 2 (which is trivial), and
the maximum number of visiting objectives n.
The map of the attractions is considered as a not-oriented graph, which is
represented in Figure 2. The program asks for the number of vertices n (in this
case n = 22 as we have considered 22 main attractions in the old city of Brasov),
the number of edges m (for Bras, ov old town, m = 35 as can be seen in Figure
2), the starting point and the ending node.
The method employed is a backtracking algorithm. For further reading on
this method see [55]. We considered the problem of finding the shortest route
inside a destination that passes through a certain number of attractions as a
traveling salesman problem (for further reading on this problem see [56], [57]).
We describe, below, the steps of the recursive algorithm that we adapted:
- At each step, a new element (here, a new tourist attraction Oi, i = 1, 22),
indexed symbolically from 1 to n, is introduced in the stack.
- For every valid element at level k of the stack (an element is considered
valid at level k of the stack if there exists an edge between it and the
7

object existing at level k − 1 of the stack), the compatibility with the
other values of the stack is evaluated (an element is compatible with the
elements existing in the stack if it is not one of the objects in levels from
1 to k − 1):
a) if the element is compatible, it is introduced in the stack and the
algorithm passes to the next step (next level of the stack);
b) if for a certain value a solution cannot be built, the current element
is dropped and another element is introduced in the stack at the
current level, if there exists another element;
c) if all elements have been tested and there is no valid solution, the
lower level k − 1 becomes the current level.
- The algorithm has found a solution when the stack level is equal to
required number n (for passing through all nodes from the graph of
destination), or a lower number s, which is initially specified, and
highest level of the stack is occupied with the stop point fixed at
beginning.

the
the
the
the

- The algorithm has finished when all values acceptable at a certain level
of the stack have been tested. When a solution is found, the distance
from the starting and ending point is calculated. To obtain the shortest
path, the distance obtained is firstly compared to an initial number, which
is very large, and the smallest value is remembered. At every step, the
distance is compared to the last value accepted (smallest number obtained
until the moment of comparison).
The backtracking method presented, although it is not as efficient as the
Floyd algorithm, for example, it is used when it is important to obtain all
possible paths from a node x to a node y. This is the case in the context of
managing tourist routes inside a destination.
We implemented the algorithm in C++. For the implementation we used
two files for reading the graph, with the same nodes and vertices. The first
file contains the nodes and the corresponding distance between them in meters.
The second file contains the nodes and the distance between them expressed
in minutes. The distances in minutes are chosen according to the distances
calculated by Google Maps (see [59]). The motivation for choosing two files is
that for tourists the time required to move inside a destination is usually more
important than the distance covered.
The distances between nodes are synthesized in Table 2. This table should
be read in the following order: the first four columns, line by line, until the end
of lines, followed by the next four columns, which should be read line by line.
The columns node represent the index of a node. The columns m represent the
distance between the specified nodes in meters, while the columns min represent
the same distance, but calculated in minutes.
In order to empirically test the method that we propose we have conducted
a qualitative research. Recommendations on the sample size in the case of

qualitative research vary and some authors propose that the sample size should
be in the range of 12-26 subjects (see [60]). In our case, we interviewed 15
volunteers who were willing to participate in the study and test our method.
The questions included in the interview guide which were addressed to the
volunteers are presented in the Appendix.

Results

For obtaining the first results, we used, as input files, text files containing the
values in Table 2. We considered as a starting point node 21 - the Theater -, as it
is an easily accessible spot by all means of transportation, from public transport
(two bus stops are near, with one being right in front of it), to private transport
(car parking is available on-site) and walking. As the final destination, we have
considered node 22, the Citadel, which is further from other attractions, and
less connected, having only one vertice which connects the node associated with
it to the graph.
Computing the shortest route which passes through all attraction points in
the Old City of Bras, ov we obtain 8 possible itineraries. Measuring the distances
in meters, we obtain a significant difference, of over 1 km between the shortest
route (7330 m) and the longest (8570 m). The case is similar when calculating
the shortest path in minutes (110 minutes), which is 17 minutes less than the
longest itinerary. The shortest path, in both cases, starting from the Theater,
and ending at the Citadel is as follows:

(7) → White Tower (8) → Graft Fortress (9) → George Barit, iu County Library
(10) → House of Army (12) → Annunciation Church (13) → The Citadel (22).
The shortest route which passes through all of the 22 attraction points considered in Brasov is highlighted in red in Figure 3.
Although finding the shortest route which passes through all landmarks can
be useful, in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, emphasis must be put on
fluidized routes inside a destination to avoid overcrowding places and make
it possible for all the social distancing measures imposed by the crisis to be
respected.
Thus, we believe that identifying alternative routes, which yield multiple
possibilities for travelling inside a destination is much more useful in the Covid19 context.
To revive tourism and assure equity from the economic point of view in
accordance with the shortening of the tourist stay, we consider that the visitation
time for the old centre of Bras, ov should be of approximately one day. Thus,
although the old town of Bras, ov is not very big, an 8 km route is too much to
cover in one day. For this matter, we modified the method to find the route
which crosses through a smaller number of attractions.
Taking the target number of attractions to be 10, which is a reasonable
number considering the distances inside Bras, ov and the mean time spent at
one destination, we found all routes which start from node 21 and end in node
22. Table 3 shows the result in increasing order of the length of the route in
minutes, which represents the cost of following a certain route.
The optimal route which passes through 10 attractions is taking 52 minutes,
while the longest is a 63-minute walk. The optimal route, for which the cost

(the time needed) is minimal is highlighted in orange on the graph in Figure 4
and it proposes the following route:
Theater (21) → Tâmpa Cable Way (4) → Rope Street (18) → Synagogue
(17) → S, chei’s Gate (5) → Black Church (14) → Council Square (15) → Rectorate of Transilvania University of Brasov (11) → George Barit, iu County Library (10) → House of Army (12) → Annunciation Church (13) → The Citadel
(22).
As we can notice from Table 3, the differences between certain routes are
usually not significant, as only a small number of nodes differ. However, if
groups with different characteristics, such as age, physical condition, associated
diseases, a.o., take different paths, safe tourism can be undertaken as the risk
of infection is reduced and tourists’ needs are met.

Figure 4: Shortest route to visit 10 tourist attractions
The significance of finding the shortest route (minimal cost - time or distance) is underlined by the existing trend of shortening the length of the tourist
stay. The length of the tourist stay is computed using formula
LoS =

ON S
Arr

(1)

where LoS = Length of Stay, ONS = Over Night Stays, Arr = Arrivals.

Figure 5: Length of tourist stay in Brasov
Data for the number of arrivals in Brasov can be accessed from the database
TUR104H and the number of overnight stays from the database TUR105H (see
[53]). Based on these data and formula (1) we calculated the length of the
tourist stay in Brasov. As it can be observed in Figure 5, the trend is slightly
decreasing. However, the trend line of the real length of visiting the city of
Brasov has a much more significant negative slope (i.e. a steeper descending
trend) as most tourists chose to find accommodation in Brasov while visiting the

12

surroundings (especially - but not limited - Poiana Brasov, which is a mountain
resort situated 10 km from the city).
The importance of identifying not only the fastest route but all routes is underlined by the need to avoid crowded places. Thus, offering multiple itineraries,
alternatively available, to groups of tourists is a significant feature.

4.1

Optimisation of tourist route in the context of Covid19 restrictions

In order to adapt the algorithm for the restrictions imposed by Covid-19, we
evaluated the crowdedness of the 22 attraction points considered, based on the
feature Popular times, provided by Google [61]. The data about how busy a
certain attraction is corresponds to Winter-Spring 2021, which means that it is
calculated during the pandemic when (as can be seen in Table 1) tourism has
dropped significantly.
In order to avoid overcrowding and to ensure that social distancing measures
are respected, we impose certain additional restrictions to the algorithm:
- if at a certain time an attraction is very busy (VB), we block that objective
for that specific time;
- if an attraction is not busy (NB), that node is preferred for the route and
included in the final route;
- at least one preferred node is included in the final route.
While the first restriction ensures that the attractions are not overcrowded,
the second and third restrictions ensure that some less-visited points are included in the tourist route, thus providing equity among attractions and a revival of secondary attractions.
Taking into account the data from the Table 4, we determined the best
route for specific times. Since most attractions are not too busy at 10 am, 11
am and 5 pm, we decided to build only the optimal routes for the remaining
time intervals. The computed results for the optimal route for each time frame
are presented in Table 5. The cost of each route is calculated in meters.
In order to test the model for optimizing the tourist route presented in this
paper, we used a qualitative research based on a sample of 15 volunteers who
were willing to get involved in testing the model.
The objectives of the qualitative research were:
Q1 identifying the level of congestion on the five routes proposed in the specified five 5 time frames;
Q2 discovering some less popular attractions in the five routes, or located in
areas adjacent to them;
Q3 determining the degree of satisfaction of the volunteers regarding the
tourist experience related to the proposed route.

Q4 assessing the utility of implementing the method in the future.
The qualitative research was conducted in Brasov in April 2021. The volunteers were both residents of Brasov (7 volunteers) and tourists visiting Brasov
(8 volunteers). Each volunteer filled a questionnaire after completing the route
proposed based on the associated time frame. The tourists were recruited in
the vicinity area of crowded attractions in Brasov.
The questionnaire was composed of 12 questions, included in a previously
created interview guide (see Appendix). We present the most important conclusions that were drawn from the interpretation of the volunteers’ answers.
The distribution on the routes was as follows:

- 2 participants followed Route 2 and started the tour at 1 pm;
- 3 participants followed Route 3 and started the tour at 2 pm;
- 3 participants followed Route 4 and started the tour at 3 pm;
- 3 participants followed Route 5 and started the tour at 4 pm;
Most participants answered that they did not encounter overcrowded places
along their route (66.7%). All participants who chose Route 5 (3 participants)
answered that they encountered overcrowded places and pointed to the Town
Hall as one of the busiest attractions. However, almost all participants (14
out of 15) described the suggested route as helpful (5) and very helpful (9) in
maintaining social distancing measures imposed by the authorities. Thus, the
method proposed can be a useful tool in tourist route planning in the context
of the Covid-19 pandemic (see objective Q1 ).
Among the people interviewed, 60% (9) answered that they have discovered
new, less-visited places. Among the answers, the Annunciation Church (6 answeres), House of Army (4 answeres) and Art Museum (4 answeres) have been
discovered by most participants. Concerning attractions that were not listed on
the routes, but which were adjacent to the routes, tourists discovered the caves
and galleries in the Graft area, the trees and shrubs and the wood carvings in
the park near Schei s Gate, the ice ring near the Tampa cable way and the fresh
spring scenery of the forest at the bottom of Tampa. From the answers received,
we can conclude that the implementation of this method brings a revival of less
visited tourist attractions in a destination, thus ensuring a fair distribution of
tourists inside an urban destination (see objective Q2 ).

15

In terms of satisfaction, 13 participants described the route as satisfactory
(6) and very satisfactory, while 2 participants found the route to be neutral
(1) and a little satisfactory. Also, 13 participants admitted that following the
specified routes optimized their visit to a great extent in terms of its duration,
and the same number of respondents agreed that the route has been very efficient
(6) and efficient (7) (see objective Q3 ).
At the final question, which evaluates the utility of implementing the method
in the future, 66.7% (10) of volunteers said that they would definitely use a tool
to suggest the optimal route, while the rest of 26.7% (4) answered Maybe (see
objective Q4 ).
We believe that the results obtained from this first pilot study on the method
proposed are satisfactory and prove that the method would be beneficial for
tourists as well as for the community. The routes proposed proved to be less
overcrowded and brought to the spotlight less-visited sights inside Brasov, a
tourist city that was greatly affected by the pandemic.

Discussions

Optimizing the tourist routes within a destination in the context of COVID-19
is one of the main challenges which should be resolved by a joined effort from
authorities and tourism industry.
In the context of the COVID-19 crisis, the length of the tourist stay is
expected to be significantly reduced and thus, this already existing trend will
be accelerated. Another main effect of the present pandemic, which dictates the
imperative need to create specific routes inside a destination, is that the revival
of tourism should start locally to reduce the risk of spreading the virus, while
positively contributing to the local economy.
On the other hand, the COVID-19 crisis has brought to the spotlight the
significant issue of overcrowded places, which pose an imminent threat as they
are potentially outbreak points. Our proposal of an optimized route in the
tourist destination of Bras, ov aims to redirect people on slightly different routes
to partially solve this problem.
The method can be efficiently used by authorities to create an online application with interfaces both for web and for phone. Such implementation of
the method proposed can be an efficient tool in creating a safe environment for
tourism, which will bring benefits to all levels of tourism. Another benefit of
implementing our method in an application available for tourists is that tourists
with less available time for visiting can choose the number of attraction points
they want to visit and a starting and ending point and discover a suitable route
that would fit their time frame.
We believe that in addition to the many problems brought by Covid-19, the
global pandemic has highlighted a positive side, which demands a reinvention
of all tourist destinations due to an imperative adaptation to the restrictions
imposed by the pandemic. This could be reached with the help of creativity and
with support from all stakeholders which ought to start drawing a new type of

16

tourism in accordance with the obvious needs of tourists and investors, but also
with the protection needs of the natural tourist potential of the destination that means a true responsible tourism.
The method should be incorporated in a location-based application that
should get real-time data about the number of people present at a certain location at a certain point. Based on this data, the user will be able to choose
the optimal length of the visit, and (or), the number of attractions that should
be visited, as well as some additional information (existing medical conditions,
age, or other limitations) which will allow the application to choose the best
route.
According to Su et al. (see [58]), in order to innovate the services included
in the tourist offer and to ensure an enhanced attractivity of the touristic products offered inside a certain destination, the tourist offer must be correlated
with the image of the destination, as it results from its visitors’ descriptions of
the experiences welcomed there. We find the idea of creating an official website
where tourists can share an edited view of their personal life with people they
select so that tourists are more likely to transform utilitarian well-being into
intrinsic motivation and thus commit to their activities (see [58]) particularly
interesting as the customization of tourist routes inside a destination that we
propose in this paper should be realized based on certain particularities definitory to a specific group interested to visit the attraction points discussed. We
believe that the tourist routes adapted to the characteristics of tourists who are
interested in visiting the old town of Bras, ov, that we propose in this paper,
would encourage the active involvement of the tourists in determining the most
appropriate routes which comply with certain requirements previously stated
by tourists who have visited the old town of Bras, ov (safety, time spent, intrinsic
motivation, a.o.).

Conclusions

The implementation of the method inside tourist destinations can bring an
important advantage in transforming a destination into a safer one in times of
Covid-19 and post-Covid-19. Moreover, the existing trend of shortening the
length of tourist stay underlines the necessity of better planning the visit of
a certain destination, from the tourist’s point of view, as well as an optimal
organization of the tourist routes inside a destination in order to offer equity
for all beneficiaries of the tourist industry.
We consider that the proposed method of optimizing the tourist routes in
the context of the pandemic will be a tool with practical applicability for implementing a sustainable development strategy for tourism industry in Brasov.
This could be really useful for DMO (Destination Management Organisation)Brasov, in the process of developing and implementing a proper strategy, which
should take into account the particular interests of all stakeholders (tourists
interested in both the tourist experience and the safety of their families, local
authorities, investors, local community, environment, different NGO’s).

17

The implementation of the present method aims to cover all three instances
of sustainable tourism. From the economic point of view, well-organized tourist
routes will bring more income to the community while assuring a fair chance for
development to a greater amount of small businesses. Moreover, planning the
visiting route for one day will positively affect the time budget, increasing the
possibility to visit more destinations from Bras, ov county, thus improving the regional tourism. From the social point of view, reducing agglomeration in certain
spots by redirecting some tourists on different routes will result in an increase
of small business which provides jobs for people. Personalized routes are also
advantageous as they give the possibility to multiple categories of people to visit
the objectives. From this point of view, in the context of the current pandemic,
people with existing health conditions, which represent a risk category, can pick
a route based on attractions that are of interest to them, located exclusively in
the open. Finally, from the ecologic point of view, creating different routes for
visitors can reduce the agglomeration on some spots which can wear out if they
are overcrowded.
