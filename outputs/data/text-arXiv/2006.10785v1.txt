Abstract

A country-wide ‘lock-down’ imposed on the 23rd March 2020 in the UK had
a significant impact on the UK’s anthropogenic movements. The closure of
work-places and restrictions imposed on visiting friends and family has radically
reduced the amount of traffic on the roads. In this short communication, we
use data from UK air-quality sensors to quantify air pollution trends pre- and
post-lock-down. While we detect large falls in nitrogen dioxide at levels not
seen over the last decade, trends in other pollutants were mixed especially when
compared to historical data. It suggests that the implication that lock-down
was beneficial for the environment was not so obvious.

Introduction

The global pandemic emerging from a novel strain of severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; Covid-19) has ravaged the world in 2020.
This airborne infectious disease has shown to have a significant effect on mortality especially in vulnerable groups such as the elderly, those with cardiovascular
disease, diabetes, respiratory diseases and cancer [Huang et al., 2020]. Covid-19
has placed considerable social, economic and economic burdens on populations
globally and will likely cause an economic crash similar to that seen in 1929
[Huang et al., 2020, , WHO, Baker et al., 2020]. While national governments
have responded in different ways, most have introduced some form of social
distancing measures to slow the spread of the infectious disease. On the 23rd
March 2020, the United Kingdom (UK) government imposed a country-wide
‘lock-down’ which introduced some of the most stringent social restrictions witnessed since World War II. Non-essential businesses, shops and services were
asked to close. Individuals were asked to remain indoors at all times other than
to shop for basic necessities, undertake daily exercise, access medical services,
and travelling to and from work, but only when this couldn’t be done from
home.
The extensive upheaval of society is likely to have significant changes to
our environments particularly air quality. It may be hypothesised that with
fewer individuals travelling outside and businesses closing, vehicle emissions will
have fallen leading to improved air quality. The UK Department for Transport

(DfT) has reported a 39% decrease in all vehicle travel between 23 March and
28 April. However, this number had already been decreasing prior to the lockdown reducing from normal levels by 30% on March 16 up until ‘lock-down’ [dft,
2020]. Recent studies [Muhammad et al., 2020, Dantas et al., 2020, Tobı́as et al.,
2020, Mahato et al., 2020] of China, France, Spain, India the USA and Brazil
have shown that the effect of lock-down on their countries has had significant
impacts in reducing the production of primarily Nitrogen Dioxide across all of
these countries.
Air-pollution is a substantial global issue, which according to the World
Health Organization (WHO) is responsible for 3.7 million deaths annually [who,
2014]. According to Public Health England (PHE) air-pollution is the biggest
environmental threat to health in the UK, with between 28,000 and 36,000
deaths a year attributed to long-term exposure. The majority of this pollutants
are not visible to the human eye, whilst it is possible to obtain large snapshot
view of global pollution concentrations using satellites, these measurements have
a very low temporal resolution (monthly) and only describe atmospheric concentrations [Martin, 2008]. The most accurate way to determine ground-level
air quality is by using single-point sensors [Guo et al., 2017]. The UK’s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) Automatic Urban and
Rural Network (AURN) monitors has a large network of 300 sensors distributed
across the UK. The locations of these sensors are clustered around densely populated urban areas, with a higher spatial coverage around major cities. All
measurements meet the required European Standards as set out in the European Ambient Air Quality Directive (2008/50/EC) measuring a combination of
Nitrogen Dioxide, Sulphur Dioxide, PM2.5 and PM10 at hourly / sub-hourly
intervals.
Nitrogen dioxide (NO2 ) is a highly reactive gas which pollutes our air mainly
as a result of road traffic and energy production. In the UK in 2018, approximately 3 million tonnes of nitrogen dioxide was produced: 31% of nitrogen dioxide was produced from road traffic; 20% from energy production; 18% from manufacturing; 14% from other modes of transport; and, 17% from other sources.
Nitrogen dioxide is a considered a highly dangerous gas and has been associated
with mild respiratory symptoms even at low concentrations [Chen et al., 2007],
while few studies have failed to reach a general consensus on the full effects
nitrogen dioxide can have on the body the majority show that any exposure
can affect mortality rates and lead to cardiovascular problems [Esplugues et al.,
2011, Maheswaran et al., 2012, Hesterberg et al., 2009] and can even adverse
effect on young children’s development [PERSHAGEN et al., 1995].
Sulphur Dioxide (SO2 ) is formed when fuel containing sulphur such as coil
and oil typically created from energy production and manufacturing. In the
UK sulphur dioxide production has been steadily decreasing with the UK’s decreased reliance on coal-powered power stations. In 2018 the UK produced
approximately 0.16 million tones of sulphur dioxide with 30% being produced
by energy industries 25% domestic heating, 24% manufacturing and 21% from
other sources. Exposure to sulphur dioxide has been associated with a number of symptoms including dyspnea (shortness of breath) and cough [Pikhart

et al., 2001]. Epidemiological studies have reported exposure to elevated sulphur
dioxide can contribute to an increase in mortality due to these respiratory and
cardiovascular causes [Tertre et al., 2002]; even short term exposure to higher
concentrations leading to hospitalisation of the elderly and vulnerable [Martins
et al., 2002].
Particulate matter classified by the size of 2.5 and 10 (PM2.5 and PM10)
microns are two of the most commonly used in air quality assessments. Particle
matter is defined as everything in the air that isn’t a gas, they originate from a
number different sources including domestic heating, industry and vehicles and
are made up from a variety of different chemical compounds. In the UK in 2018
domestic combustion was a major source of PM emissions, accounting for 27%
and 44% of PM10 and PM2.5 respectively, industrial processing and accounted
for 43% of PM10 and 29% of PM2.5, vehicles 11% of both PM10 and PM2.5
and the rest from other sources. In 2018 the UK produced 0.12 million tonnes
of PM2.5 and 0.18 of PM10. Particle matter as shown to cause respiratory
problems [Pope III and Dockery, 2006] and smaller PM2.5 have been proved to
be easily absorbed into the bloodstream, causing hardening of arteries leading
to strokes and cardiovascular problems [Santibañez et al., 2013] with studies
also linking PM2.5 and SO2 causing lung cancer [Xing et al., 2019] PM2.5 and
SO2.
Clearly, all forms of air pollutants can have serious implications to human
health. Importantly, their risk to respiratory health, as well as interactions with
chronic co-morbidities, means air pollution can exacerbate outcomes related to
Covid-19 and may place individuals at higher risk of mortality. The aim of our
study is to explore how trends in air pollutants have changed in the UK before
and after the introduction of the lock-down. we hypothesise that emissions of
all major air pollutants have fallen since 23rd March.

Results & Discussion

Figures 1-4 show a series of contour plots created from the points the DEFRA
AURN stations. The point time-series data is gridded using a multi-resolution,
cubic, gridded-interpolator [Higham and Brevis, 2019]. The method assumes an
adaptive grid to distribute measurements ensuring at least one point is described
by one grid cell [Liszka, 1984]. In each of the figures the black dots signify the
locations of the air-quality sensors (please note that for different air-pollutants
there as a differing number of data points). In each of the figures the mean value
is determined between the date of 23rd March and 28th April for the past 10
years. A sample of 10 years is used to ensure there is a significant change caused
by the ‘lock-down’. In figs. 5 we present the daily average measurement for the
past ten years, we also present the mean plus or minus the daily standard
deviations (filled light grey area), this variance represents the average daily
production of the pollutants. The red highlighted areas show the regions used
to create the ensemble-averaged presented in Figs. 1-3. Figures. 6 focus in on
2020, comparing UK spatial average time-series with the previous 9 years. Here

the ‘lock-down’ phase is highlighted in grey, in the left-hand panes we present
the daily averages and on the right-hand pane the daily standard deviations.
As expected from the contour plots and yearly time average we can see
over the past 10 years there has been a general decrease in the production of
all air pollutants. This is likely to be attributed to the declining use in fossil
fuels. We also see that near heavily densely populated cities, such as London
and Birmingham, on average we see higher Nitrogen dioxide, Sulphur dioxide
levels, and generally in the UK England is the most polluted. We also see high
PM2.5 levels in Scotland, as the averages taken are during periods of colder
weather this is likely attributed to domestic heating in the cooler northern
regions of the UK. From the contour plots we also see results echoing those in
the studies of [Muhammad et al., 2020, Dantas et al., 2020, Tobı́as et al., 2020,
Mahato et al., 2020] we see, during the ‘lock-down’ period, there is a significant
average decrease in the production of Nitrogen dioxide. This contrasts with
levels around London and Birmingham, whilst lower in comparison with other
years, remain slightly elevated during the lock-down. The spatial average of
these results presented in Fig. 5 highlight compared with previous years there
is a significant drop. By focusing in on the period leading up to the ‘lock-down’
in Fig. 6 these changes are quite evident with levels reducing on average by
approximately one third and daily production almost halving. These findings
reflect the 69% decrease in road traffic as reported by the DfT.
Notably from all of the figures we see there is no real significant impact of
‘lock-down’ on the production of PM2.5 nor PM10. Figures 6 might suggest
there is a slight decrease in the production of PM2.5 and PM10, however as
discussed by [Zhang et al., 2016] the complex make up of these pollutants make
such signals difficult to interpret and a number of factors such as increased
humidity [Cheng et al., 2015] and dust storms [Vieno et al., 2016, Tao et al.,
2013] can easily distort these readings. Similarly, the on-average 2.5 degrees
Celsius increase in temperature during this period in 2020, compared with 2019,
might account for a reduction in domestic heating.
Most interestingly, and perhaps unexpectedly, preceding and during the
‘lock-down’ period we see that there is an increase in the production of Sulphur
Dioxide; Fig 5 even shows there is a five year high. Fig 2 shows an increase
in concentration surrounding Birmingham, London and central Scotland. Figure 6 shows, although there is an average increase the daily standard deviation
is comparable with previous years. This perhaps suggests there is an increase
in the background of Sulphur dioxide, apposed to daily cycles in production.
This could be attributed to several sources including wind speed, humidity and
climatic changes [Van Hove et al., 1990], although these could also be attributed
to increased human cremation as suggested by an older study [Qian et al., 2007]
conducted in Wuhan, China.

Conclusions

To our knowledge, our study presents the first analysis of air quality trends
in the UK. We demonstrate a mixed and complex picture. There has been a
substantial fall in nitrogen dioxide levels observed consistently across the UK
and at an unprecedented level. However, similar trends were not observed for
sulphur dioxide which has increased over the same period. Trends for PM2.5 and
PM10 suggest that recent declines are not significantly different from historical
trends.
Improved environments through less nitrogen dioxide may have public health
benefits both in short and longer-term - similarly, climate change emissions too.
Renewed interest in environments and seeing cleaner air might result in greater
future action unless people use ‘non-lock-down’ for travelling more to account for
their current comprised situations. An increase in sulphur dioxide is a worrying
finding, whilst at present current levels remain safe, further rises may require
action.
In this short communication that we do not look in detail at the drivers of
trends, rather just present the key findings. This will be the feature of a future
in-depth study where we will connect the trends in air quality to population
groups (e.g. inequalities by the level of deprivation), including how they may
affect responses to Covid-19 (air pollution appears to be a factor in experiences
and deaths - affecting respiratory health).
