Abstract
A large percentage of the deaths from COVID-19 occur among residents of long-term care
facilities. There are two possible reasons for this phenomenon. First, the structural features of
such settings may lead to death. Alternatively, it is possible that individuals in these facilities
are in poorer health than those living elsewhere, and that these individuals would have died
even if they had not been in these facilities.
Our findings show that, controlling for the population density, the percentage of older adults
in the population, and the number of hospital beds per capita, there is a significant positive
association between the number of long-term care beds (LTCB) per capita and COVID-19
mortality rates.
This finding provides support for the claim that long-term care living arrangements (of older
people) are a significant risk factor for dying from COVID-19.

1. Introduction
A large percentage of the deaths worldwide from COVID-19 have occurred among residents of
long-term care institutions. 2 Euronews reported that deaths due to COVID-19 among such longterm care residents could account for more than 50% of all COVID-19 deaths in Europe. 3
According to an article in The Guardian, data from the Kaiser Family Foundation indicates that
COVID-19 deaths among long-term care residents account for more than 50% of all deaths
attributed to COVID-19 in fourteen states in the United States. Additionally, the same article
notes that in the state of New Hampshire, 72% of COVID-19 deaths occurred among those
living in long-term care settings. 4 Overall, according to the New York Times, 5 more than one
third of the deaths in the United States from COVID-19 have occurred among long-term care
residents. The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has formally stated that
generally, people 65 years and older, and in particular “People who live in a nursing home or
long-term care facility” are at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19. 6
There are two possible explanations for the higher COVID-19 mortality rates in long-term
care facilities:
1. The structural features of such settings, such as a communal living area, multiple
residents in a room, care provided by multiple caregivers to multiple care recipients,
etc., can lead to a greater number of deaths.
2. Individuals in these facilities are in poorer health than those outside of such facilities
and they would have been likely to die even had they had not been in these facilities.
Each of these has different policy implications.
This paper examines the two competing explanations by studying the association between
long-term care beds per capita in a country and COVID-19 deaths per capita. Using countrylevel data from Europe, 7 and controlling for the percentage of older adults in the population,
the population density and the number of hospital beds per capita, we find that there is a
significant positive association between the number of long-term-care beds per capita 8 and
COVID-19 mortality rates in European countries. This finding supports the thesis that living

We do not have data on how many people aged seventy-five and older are living in long-term care
settings. Therefore, we use long-term care beds per capita as a proxy for older persons living in longterm care facilities. Since such facilities are typically “full to capacity,” we believe is an excellent proxy
for the number of people living in such setting.

in long-term care facilities presents a significant mortality risk factor for older people
contracting COVID-19.
Our results also provide a partial, preliminary explanation as to why the death rates from
COVID-19 differ so widely among the European Countries. This issue needs to be explored
in more depth once there is more detailed data available, including additional countries,
regional level data, and more. Therefore, there is a need for future research on this question.

Analysis Using European Countries

This research seeks to examine the factors that are associated with deaths per capita from
COVID-19, and, in particular, long-term care beds per capita. Before we write down and
estimate an econometric model, we examine the raw data.

Data
The data employed in the study are
•

Deaths_cap = deaths from COVID-19 per million residents through mid-May 2020

•

LTCB_cap = number of long-term care beds per million residents 9

•

Per_75 = the percentage of the population aged 75 and older 10

•

Pop_den = the population density: residents per square kilometer.

•

Hosp_cap = Hospital Beds per million residents

We included all European countries for which we have data on long-term beds per capita. We
have data on thirty-two of the thirty-six European countries with more than 600,000 residents. 11
Figure 1 shows a graph of deaths per capita in relation to long-term care beds per capita for

The European Health Information Gateway, which is part of the European Regional Office of the
World Health Organization is the source for the data used in this study and for the definition of longterm care beds. Their definition for long-term care beds is “beds available for people requiring longterm care in institutions (other than hospitals.) The predominant service component is long-term care
and the services are provided for people with moderate to severe functional restrictions.” The quote
is from the European Health Information Gateway,
https://gateway.euro.who.int/en/indicators/hfa_491-5101-number-of-nursing-and-elderly-homebeds/, which served as the data source for all countries except Portugal for this study. Most of the
data on beds from our data source is from 2015, the most recent year available. See the Appendix for
details. See the source for the detailed explanation. Although the quality of the settings, and their
structures may differ, the nature of the facilities included is well-defined by the agency.
10
All of the results on LTCB per capita obtain if we use “65 and older” or “70 and older” instead of “75
and older.” The “fit” of the regressions is best when we employ “75 and older.” Hence, we use this
variable.
11
Two small island countries, Iceland and Malta, were excluded from the analysis. We also excluded
Russia and Turkey since these countries are primarily in Asia. Our results are qualitatively unchanged
if we include Russia and Turkey.

care beds per capita. The figure also suggests that there is a positive association between Longterm care beds per capita and COVID-19 Deaths per capita. 12

We now turn to the Econometric Analysis.
Econometric Analysis
The first structural equation has COVID-19 Deaths per capita (Deaths_cap) on the left-hand
side. On the right side we include long-term care beds per capita (LTCB_capita,) the
percentage of the population aged 75 and older (Per_75), and hospital beds per capita
(Hosp_cap,) all of which are exogenous. 13 We also include COVID-19 cases per capita
(Cases_cap) in the equation. The first equation is thus
1. Deaths_cap = β0 + β1*LTCB_cap+ β2*Per_75 + β3*Hosp_cap + β4*Cases_cap + ε,
where ε is the error term.

Cases per capita is endogenous and likely depends on the two exogenous variables in
Equation 1, as well as on population density (pop_den), which is also exogenous, and on tests
performed for COVID-19 per capita (Tests_cap,) which itself may be endogenous. The
second structural equation is thus
2. Cases_cap = α0 + α1*LTCB_cap + α2*Per_75 + α3*pop_den + α4 *Tests_cap + ξ,
where ξ is the error term.

Tests per capita depends on exogenous variables like institutional features of the country, and
government policy, which we can reasonably assume are uncorrelated with the other

We would have liked to include the percent of the population with two or more preexisting
conditions in the older people in the population as an explanatory variable, but we do not have data
on this variable. It seems reasonable to assume that this variable is uncorrelated with the exogenous
variables used in our analysis.

exogenous variables and can be viewed as part of the error term. But tests per capita is also
likely a function of Cases per capita, that is, more cases lead to more tests. Thus, the third
structural equation is
3. Tests_cap = γ0 + γ1*Cases_cap + μ, where μ is the error term.
We are interested in the association between long-term care beds per capita (LTCB_cap) and
deaths per capita (deaths_cap.) Since the number of long-term care beds per million residents
is exogenous, we can solve for the reduced form of the above three-equation structural model.
We can then estimate the relevant “reduced form” equation with Deaths per capita as the lefthand side variable: 14
4. Deaths_cap = φ 0 + φ1*LTCB_cap+ φ2*Per_75 + φ3*pop_den + φ4*hosp_cap + ω

Hence, we can estimate equation (4) using ordinary squares, and the estimates will be
unbiased.

From Figure 1, it appears that the variance of the dependent variable increases with the
number of long-term care beds. Hence, we use robust standard errors, which is the way to
address heteroscedasticity.

In Column 1 of table 1, we estimate a linear model using equation (4.) In this case, we find
that the estimated coefficients on long-term beds per capita and population density are
positive and statistically significant at the 95 percent level of confidence. The estimated
coefficient on the percent of the population 75 and older is positive, but not statistically
significant. The coefficient on Hospital Beds per capita is negative and statistically
significant at the 95 percent level of confidence.

In column 2 of Table 3, we estimate (4) using a log/log model. The regression uses the natural
logarithm of deaths per million residents from COVID-19 as the dependent variable and the
natural logarithm of LTCB per capita, the natural logarithm of population density, the natural
logarithm of the percent of the population 75 and older, and the natural logarithm of hospital
beds per capita as explanatory variables.

There are also reduced form regressions for Cases per capita and Tests per capita as a function of
the same exogenous variables in equation 4. But we are interested in the association between longterm care beds per capita and death per capita.
14

Similar to the specification in Column 1 of Table 3, the results in column 2 show that the
estimated coefficients for both long-term beds per capita and population density are positive
and both are statistically significant, in this case at the 99 percent level of confidence. The
coefficient on the percent of the population seventy-five years and over is positive, but not
significant, while the coefficient on hospital beds per capita is negative and statistically
significant at the 99 percent level of confidence. Thus the results are qualitatively similar to
those using the linear model in Column 1 of the table.

The table also shows that the four factors in the log/log model explain 68 percent of the
variation in the death rate for European countries (versus 54 percent for the linear model.)
This is a very high percentage for such a small number of factors. Hence, we believe that the
fit of this model is quite good. While both the linear model and the log/log model provide
qualitatively similar results, the log/log model is our preferred specification since it provides
the better fit and makes sense intuitively. 15

The coefficient on the natural logarithm of LTCB per capita is an elasticity. Thus, the 0.58
coefficient from the second regression in Table 3 means that a one percent increase in the
number of long term care beds per capita is associated with a 0.58 percent increase in deaths
per capita.

Robustness Analysis

LTCB could be a function of wealth, such that wealthier countries will have more beds. If this
were driving our results this would imply that GDP per capita is positively correlated with
deaths per capita. While, it seems clear that increases in GDP per capita will not directly lead
to an increase in the death rate, our story suggests that it is not the earnings themselves but the
behavior of wealthier countries (specifically in terms of their treatment of older people) that
drives our outcomes.
•

In any case, when we add GDP per capita as an explanatory variable, the results are
qualitatively unchanged as shown in Column 4 in Table (3.) In particular, the

Other things being equal, the marginal long-term care “resident” in a country with more LTCB per
capita is likely healthier than the marginal long-term care resident in a country with fewer LTCB per
capita, and thus less likely to die if infected. This suggests that the relationship between LTCB per
capita and deaths would be such that the death rate would be increasing at a decreasing rate as the
number of LTCB per capita increases. In such a case, a log/log model is ideal.
15

estimated coefficient on long-term care beds per capita is positive and statistically
significant at the 99% level of confidence using the preferred Log/Log model. The
estimated coefficient on GDP per capita is positive, but not statistically significant.
•

GDP per capita might lead to more deaths if wealthier countries find it more difficult
to social distance due to economic activity, which in turn might lead to more deaths.
The ideal way to address this is to include a variable on “mobility” in the regression.

Our mobility index was calculated by taking the average of the following “Google
mobility” indices (I) "Residential", (II) "Workplace", (III) "Transit", and (IV) "Retail
& Recreation". 16 We do this, and report the results in column 4 of table 3. 17 We also
include GDP per capita in this regression. We find that our results are again
qualitatively unchanged. In particular, the estimated coefficient on LTCB beds per
capita is positive and statistically significant at the 97 percent level of confidence.
The estimated coefficients on mobility and GDP per capita are positive, but not
statistically significant.
•

Thus, even after controlling for GDP per capita, and mobility, as well as the other
factors, LTCB per capita is positively associated with death per capita and the effect
is statistically significant. Hence, we are confident that our results are robust.

•

In summary, controlling for other factors that might affect the death rate, the
estimated coefficient on long-term care beds per capita is positive and statistically
significant at the 95 percent level or a higher level. Thus our preliminary results
suggest that long-term care beds per capita emerges as a risk factor for death from
COVID-19.

See the appendix for the source of the mobility data.
We do not have data for Albania so there are 31 observation in the regression in column 4. The
correlation between mobility and LTCB is virtually zero (0.03.) Other indices of mobility give similar
results.

3. The Regions in Italy
For research purposes, having data on long-term care beds per capita for regions within a
country, and not just for the country as a whole, is ideal, as there is more similarity in other
(unobserved) aspects within a country than among countries. The one country that did have
such regional data available was Italy. This information also existed for us to break down the
data for Italy into the smaller sub-regions, which we denote as “counties.” The correlation of
deaths per capita and long-term care beds per capita is 0.70 when all counties are included.
Since the northern part of Italy had many more deaths per capita, the correlation between
COVID-19 deaths and living in long-term care facilities was again calculated excluding the
northern counties. The result of 0.74 was very close to that of the country as a whole. This
suggests that even when excluding the northern regions of Italy from consideration, there is
strong positive relationship between mortality rates per capita and long-term care beds per
capita. See Figure 2, which shows the data for Italian counties.

4. Discussion and Further Work
Controlling for the proportion of adults “aged 75 and older,” the population density, and
hospital beds per capita, the number of long-term care beds per capita is positive and
statistically significant in explaining the differences in the deaths per capita for countries in
Europe. This suggests that the structural features of such settings are associated with death
from COVID-19. In European countries with more long-term care beds per capita, the death
rate from COVID-19 is higher. These findings are, of course, very preliminary, but they
nonetheless raise policy implications. In particular, efforts should be geared to protecting
older adults living in long-term care settings. Policy makers might even consider alternative
dwelling options during the epidemic period, such as encouraging residents to live with their
families whenever possible. It appears that additional and more detailed data concerning
long-term care facilities may be available in the next few months, allowing us to continue and
improve our analysis.
