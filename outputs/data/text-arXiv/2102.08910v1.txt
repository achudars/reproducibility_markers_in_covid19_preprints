Biological processes at the cellular level are stochastic in nature, and the immune
response system is no different. Therefore, models that attempt to explain this system need to also incorporate noise or fluctuations that can account for the observed
variability. In this work, a stochastic model of the immune response system is presented in terms of the dynamics of the T cells and the virus particles. Making use
of the Green’s function and the Wilemski-Fixman approximation, this model is then
solved to obtain the analytical expression for the joint probability density function
of these variables in the early and late stages of infection. This is then also used
to calculate the average level of virus particles in the system. Upon comparing the
theoretically predicted average virus levels to those of COVID-19 patients, it is hypothesized that the long lived dynamics that are characteristic of such viral infections
are due to the long range correlations in the temporal fluctuations of the virions.
This model therefore provides an insight into the effects of noise on viral dynamics.

INTRODUCTION

The immune system of an organism provides the protection that it needs against foreign bodies such as microbes, viruses, parasites and more. The appearance of these foreign
entities inside the body triggers the immune response, which is an agglomeration of cells,
tissues and biochemical processes that function in conjunction with each other to protect
the body [1]. To stop the proliferation of such antigens, the immune system proliferates
its own cells and shields the body from foreign attack, thereby enabling it to carry out its
regular functions [2].
The immune response in humans can be understood as a system with two levels of increas∗

ing complexity. These are the innate and the adaptive immunity. Innate immunity is the
first line of defense and is non-specific. It has no immunologic memory as it cannot distinguish self from non-self [3]. Therefore, after the pathogens manage to evade the innate
immune system, the second line of defense, i.e., the adaptive immune response gets activated.
The adaptive/acquired immunity releases antigen-specific response and therefore provides
a targeted defense against foreign particles. It works by retaining the copies of antibodies
produced in the previous attack, therefore encoding the new memory for future use. This
helps the immune system in launching a faster and targeted attack on foreign bodies in the
future. The adaptive immunity is provided by a combined effort of two types of lymphocytes, which are, antigen-specific T cells (matured in thymus) and B cells (matured in the
bone marrow) which divide into plasma to produce antibodies. T cells have surface specific
antibody-like receptors that can recognize antigens inside the target cell of the host’s body
carrying the virus and directly destroys them [4].
Since T cells are responsible for the directed attack on virus particles, a study of the dynamics between these two is pertinent. Theoretical studies of such systems are helpful in giving
an insight into the complex dynamical phenomena involving their interaction. Therefore,
several groups in the past have developed theoretical models to analyze and predict the virus
and T cell dynamics in the system. These include models developed to look at the integrated immunological response to different viral infections such as Human Immunodeficiency
Virus (HIV), Influenza virus, Zika virus and the virus that caused the ongoing pandemic,
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [5–8], among others. These
theoretical studies generally use one of the two modelling approaches, viz. models without
and with the immune response. The models without immune response generally incorporate
kinetic interactions between healthy, susceptible and infected cells with the virus particles.
Various standard versions of models using this approach, such as, “Target Cell Limited
model” [7] and “Target Cell Eclipse Phase model” [9, 10] have been studied. On the other
hand, the models that include the immune response deal with interactions between immune
cells (T cells) and viral particles [8, 11]. The immune response model was also developed for
the Influenza A virus, where, the dynamics of cytotoxic T cells and virus population were
coupled through a set of coupled ODEs [6].
All of these models discussed above are deterministic. However, biological processes at the
cellular level, including the immune response systems are stochastic in nature [12]. Therefore,
one must take care to incorporate fluctuations/noise in these systems. In fact, an analysis
of experimental data has shown that the presence of random noise in gene expression leads
to increased variability in viral (HIV) gene products such as RNA, which contributes to the
replication of viral material and the latency period [13]. Stochasticity has also been reported
in the division and death time of lymphocytes [14].

3
Taking this variability and population heterogeneity into consideration, a few stochastic
immune response models have been developed in the recent past [15–17]. Dalal et al. in
their work introduced stochasticity in the deterministic model of immune response in HIV
infection by parameter perturbation [15]. Wang et al. showed that the stability of the
stochastic dynamical system of HIV infection is different when fluctuations are introduced
in terms of the Gaussian colored noise in contrast to the Gaussian white noise [16]. Another
recent stochastic model of T cell dynamics was used to explain the bistability and crossover
dynamics of the immune response [18]. These stochastic studies indicate that modeling fluctuations into the system can give a more accurate picture of the immune response dynamics.
In this work, we aim to look at the stochastic nature of the immune response with special
focus on the SARS-CoV-2 virus for the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic. To do this, we
model the immune response dynamics in viral infections by incorporating stochastic fluctuations in terms of the Gaussian white noise and the fractional Gaussian noise to the set
of coupled ODEs of T cells and virus particles. Our stochastic immune response model
provides a near analytic solution for the time dependent joint probability distribution of T
cells and virus, which we then use to determine the average number of virus particles in the
system. Considering the ongoing pandemic, we then also compare our results to the experimental SARS-CoV-2 viral infection data from Germany [19, 20]. The long mean incubation
period, which is approximated to be 5-6 days [21, 22] makes it important to analyse the
viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 using the stochastic immune response model. Although, in
this work, we carry out the numerical analysis for this particular virus, similar analysis can
also be applied to other viral dynamics.
This paper is organized as follows: In Section II, we formulate the stochastic immune response model using a set of coupled stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Section III provides the derivation of the temporal evolution of the joint probability distribution (FokkerPlanck equation) of T cells and virus particles from the set of coupled SDEs. Part A of
the results section includes a near analytic solution of Fokker-Planck equation in different
time regimes. The analysis carried out here is generic and is applicable to viral infections
in general. Part B has two subsections to show the numerical analysis of the stochastic
quantities of immune response in SARS-CoV-2 infection. We finally summarize our results
in Section V.

II.

STOCHASTIC IMMUNE RESPONSE MODEL

The simplest model of immune response dynamics needs to account for interactions between the immune cells and the virus. The immune response itself is activated when cells
are under attack by foreign bodies such as viruses. This activation is manifested through

4
an increased proliferation of the immune cells. Therefore, there needs to be a coupled interaction between the immune cells and the virus. Since the proliferation and death rates of
both these entities are intrinsically stochastic [14, 23], any realistic model needs to account
for this inherent variability as well. The inherent intrinsic variability can be accounted for
in the model via the Gaussian white noise (GWN), which is delta correlated. The GWN is a
fast decaying noise, where successive fluctuations are not correlated. We model the inherent
noise in T cells as a GWN. Viruses though are known to show population level fluctuations
between active and latent states [13]. This is a manifestation of fluctuations in the gene
expression, which in turn leads to variability in the gene products. We therefore model the
viral dynamics to evolve under the action of the fractional Gaussian noise (fGn), which is a
type of colored noise. Specifically, the dynamical interaction between T cells and the virus
particles can then be written as a set of coupled stochastic differential equations (SDEs),
given by

Here, x(t) and v(t) represent the concentration levels of T cells and virus particles in
the body which are cleared at rates γ and c respectively. p is the replication rate of virus

particles. β v(t) is a function of virions concentration, which incorporates the effect of virus

levels in T cell dynamics. β v(t) is a positive odd integer power law function that accounts
for the dependency between T cells and virus levels. This term therefore couples the viral

dynamics to T-cell dynamics. In general, one can consider β v(t) = rv m to account for

the fact that higher the value of m, faster is the rate of increase of β v(t) . Earlier immune
response models [6] also indicate the same, i.e., increase in virus levels lead to proliferation
of T cells with a rate r. In our study, we have set the value of m to be 1. A schematic
representation of the stochastic immune response model is shown in Fig. 1.
The terms θ(t) and ξ(t) represent GWN and fGn with noise strengths a and λ respectively.
These account for the variability in the system and have the following statistical properties.

hθ(t)i = 0

Here, the angular brackets represent an average over all realizations of the noise. As

fluctuations of a Markov process which is delta correlated, i.e., the fluctuation at any time
t is uncorrelated with the previous time t0 , while ξ(t) represents correlated fluctuations
characteristic of fractional Gaussian noise (fGn). fGn is a Non-Markovian process, which is
temporally correlated by a memory kernel K(|t − t0 |), which has the following form [24–28]
K(|t − t0 |) = 2H(2H − 1)|t − t0 |2H−2

(4)

Here H is the Hurst index such that 1/2 ≤ H < 1. The value H = 1/2 represents the
delta correlated limit of the memory kernel, whereas away from this value, the fluctuations
become more correlated. The strength of noise for GWN and fGn i.e. a and λ respectively,
specifies the deviation of noise from its mean.

III.

TRANSFORMATION TO THE FOKKER-PLANCK EQUATION

The advantage of representing a system through a stochastic model is the possibility of
obtaining a multivariate probability distribution function from the set of SDEs, Eqs. (1)
and (2). This distribution function can then be used to obtain the average values of the
relevant variables, in this case, the number of virions inside the host’s body at a given time.
To begin with, we first define the distribution function P (x, v, t) as the probability density
of finding x T cells and v virions at a particular time t. This can be written as
P (x, v, t) = hδ(x − x(t))δ(v − v(t))i

(5)

6
where x(t) and v(t) are functionals of the noise θ(t) and ξ(t) respectively and the angular
brackets represent an average over all realizations of the noise. Now, substituting the solutions of the differential equations, Eqs(1) and (2) into Eq (5) and making use of the noise
properties (Eq(3)), one can obtain the time evolution of the probability density function
P (x, v, t). This equation, known as the Fokker-Planck equation, is given by

P (x, v, t) = −β v(t) P (x, v, t) − LP (x, v, t)

The details of this transformation (from Eqs(1) and (2) to Eq(6)) are shown in Appendix
A. The exact joint probability distribution function, P (x, v, t), can be obtained from the
time dependent solution of the Fokker-Planck Equation (Eq(6)), which will then be useful
in studying the various statistics of T cells and virus particles.

RESULTS

Solution of the Fokker-Planck Equation: Obtaining P(x, v, t)

The Fokker-Planck Equation, Eq(6) can be represented through an equivalent form by
making use of the Green’s function. The system evolves with time from its equilibrium state
and therefore the formal solution of Eq(6) is given by [29]

Here the Green’s function, G(x, v, t − t0 |x0 , v0 ), is the time dependent conditional probability
of finding the system in the state (x, v) at time t given that it was in the state (x0 , v0 ) at
time t = 0. The detailed derivation of the Green’s function using the operator L is provided

Eq(8) can provide the implicit solution for P (x, v, t), but to determine the analytic expression
for the time dependent joint probability distribution function, we use the closure scheme
introduced by Wilemski and Fixman [30, 31]. The Wilemski-Fixman (WF) approximation
was originally developed to estimate the rate of the reaction between reactive groups at
either ends of a polymer chain [31]. This was later extended to the systems of catalytic
bimolecular reactions [32], non-exponential DNA escape kinetics [33], dynamic disorder in
chain unfolding [34] and chain closure in entangled polymer systems [35], among others.
In the original work by Wilemski and Fixman [30], a sink term was introduced to provide
a valid “closure approximation” for the diffusion equation in the many-particle system of
polymer reactions. Using this approximation, the solution of Eq(8) can be replaced by
an approximate expression which involves the product of two terms - (i) the equilibrium
probability density Peq (x, v), that is time independent and corresponds to the situation
when T cells and virus levels in the system are independent of each other and (ii) a selfconsistently determined time-dependent term which evolves with time from the equilibrium

distribution (Peq (x, v)) as a consequence of the sink term, i.e., β v(t) in the case of our
stochastic immune response model.
Therefore using this approximation, the probability distribution function P (x, v, t) can
be defined by the introduction of two functions w(t) and w̄ such that,
P (x, v, t) = Peq (x, v)

Following the above steps, one can see that w(t) is required in the calculation of the probability distribution for the immune response model, which in turn requires the evaluation of
C(t). Computation of C(t) is carried out by substituting Eq(9), Eq(10) and the expression
for β(v) into Eq [14] and then carrying out the integration. This gives

w(t) can simply be obtained by using the method of Laplace transforms. This requires the
Laplace transform of C(t) as well. Determining the simple algebraic form of the Laplace
transform of Eq(15) is non-trivial due to the presence of X (t) i.e. the Mittag-Leffler function.
However, viral dynamics are particularly interesting during the early and late stages of
infection. Viral populations reach their peaks in the early stage of infection and are especially
long lived and decay gradually during the late stages of infection [20]. Therefore, here, we
are primarily interested in viral dynamics, and in turn, X (t) in two different time regimes
i.e. at short and long times.

1.

Short time regime

In the case of short times (t/τ << 1 and γt << 1), the Mittag-Leffler function is
approximated to X(t) = 1 −a1 tb + O(t2b ), where b = 2 − 2H, a1 = 1/τ b Γ(3 − 2H). The

Another regime of interest is the viral dynamics in the long time regime. Therefore,
for large values of t, the Mittag-Leffler function is approximated to X (t) ≈ a2 t−b , where
a2 = τ b /Γ(2H − 1) and b = 2 − 2H [33]. Further, ignoring higher order terms and using

Numerical implementations of stochastic immune response model

The analytical results presented in the previous section, i.e., Eqs(22) and (29), provide
the joint probability density function P (x, v, t) for T cells and virus particles in different time
regimes, namely, the early (short times) and late (long times) stages of infection. Following
this calculation, we carry out its numerical analysis to study the temporal evolution of the
time dependent joint probability distribution function. Our analysis applies in general to
typical virus and immune response interactions, but, because the ongoing pandemic due to
COVID-19 demands special attention, we analyze our results in the context of the immune
response system for T cells and the SARS-CoV-2 virus, a pathogenic RNA virus with a lipid
envelope. SARS-CoV-2 has long mean incubation period, which is approximated to be 5-6
days [21]. The latency period i.e. the time lag between the time of infection and the onset
of the initial symptoms, makes it pertinent to analyse the viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2
using the stochastic immune response model. To gain an insight into the applicability of
our model to the real world data, we have carried out a quantitative analysis by comparing
our results to those obtained from the clinical data of COVID patients [19, 20].

1.

Temporal evolution of the joint probability distribution function

The time dependent joint probability distribution expression for T cells and virus particles in the short and the long time regimes are given by Eqs(22) and (29) respectively.
In this work, we have studied the evolution of probability distribution function in two different time regimes: (a) from the time when SARS-CoV-2 enters the host’s body to start
the infection and (b) during the extinction of SARS-CoV-2 from a patients’ body. The
parameters required for this study have been determined from the earlier research studies
[8, 10] which have looked at the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the basis of experimental data
of viral load within the patients’ bodies. The strength of the noise parameters, i.e., GWN
in T cells and fGn in virus particles are a = 0.3 and λ = 0.1 respectively. These are fit
parameters that are variable. The clearance rate of T cells, γ has been estimated on the

these calculations we set γ to 0.1 day−1 . Clearance rate of virus particles (c), proliferation
rate of T cells (r), and replication rate of virus particles (p) are set to the mean values of
these parameters for different patients’ in different time regimes. These are listed in Table
I. Fig. 2 shows the temporal evolution of the distribution function in the initial period of
infection, approximately up to 2 days. Fig. 3, on the other hand provides an insight into
the decrease in the joint probability distribution of T cells and virus particles at larger times

i.e. during virus extinction and when T cell levels drop to basal values. These results show
that the joint probability of T cells and virus particles increases with time at the start of
infection and shows the decrease in probability distribution when virus levels attain a very
low value (virus extinction period) within the host’s body.

Average level of virus particles

The next step in the analysis of the stochastic immune response model is to compute the
average level of virus particles in the system. The analytic expressions for this in different
time regimes are obtained using Eq(22) and Eq(29). For short times, the average level of
virus particles is given by,

After having obtained the expression for mean levels of virus particles, the next step would
be to compare it to experimental data. Fig. 4 illustrates the comparison between the
numerically evaluated average number of virions with that determined clinically in COVID
patients from Germany [20]. The rate parameters used in the analysis of each patient are
listed in Table I. The parameter values used have been selected on the basis of fits to data
available for experimental viral load in COVID patients in published papers [8, 10]. Other
parameters have been set to the same values as used in the analysis of the temporal evolution
of the joint probability distribution for T cells and virus particles, i.e. in Figs. 2 and 3. In
short time regime, the initial value v0 is considered to be 100 copies/ml (which is the lower
limit of detection in experiments [20]). In the long time regime, the initial value v0 is in

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

Understanding the functioning and dynamics of the immune system becomes important
given the role that it plays in fighting off infection and disease. However, this becomes
non-trivial because just like all the other biological processes at the cellular level, this too
shows a lot of variability. Therefore, stochastic models of the immune response, most of
which primarily focused on the HIV virus, have been more successful in explaining some

17
of the heterogeneity and variability associated with the system [14, 15, 17, 18, 40]. Earlier
theoretical studies that have attempted to explain different aspects of the immune response
have been based on deterministic models [5–8, 38], which illustrate the mean dynamics but
fail to account for the inherent stochasticity and variability of the process. In light of this,
in this article, we have developed and analyzed a stochastic version of the immune response
model.
Our stochastic immune response model is composed of coupled Langevin equations for the
T cells and virus particles with two kinds of noise, GWN and fGN, respectively. This
allowed us to account for stochasticity within the model itself and obtain the temporal
probability distributions of the main variables. In this work, we first derived the FokkerPlanck Equation, which we then used to compute the joint probability distribution of T cells
and virus particles by making use of the Wilemski-Fixman approximation. This approach
allowed us to obtain analytical solutions of the probability distribution functions and the
average virus particles in the limit of short and long times, showing how the infection begins
and ends (see Figs. 2 and 3).
A further advantage of an analytical expression is that a direct comparison can be made
between the predicted theoretical dynamics and the experimental results. We have carried
out such a comparison with the available SARS-CoV-2 virus data from patients in Germany.
At short times, i.e., during the early period of infection, the model predicts that there is
a steep rise in the virus levels with time, whereas, at long times, the virus levels drop
gradually, in accordance with the model’s prediction. As shown in Fig. 4, our Stochastic
Immune Response model gives a good fit to the experimental data at both short and long
times.
One of the parameters that is crucial in obtaining good fits is the Hurst index, H, which
in the case of fGn takes values between 1/2 and 1. H value between 0.5 and 1 corresponds
to a system with long-ranged correlated fluctuations and values between 0 and 0.5 stand
for anti-correlated time series [12]. The H value in the case of fGn, that represents the
Non-Markovian viral dynamics, indicates the long-ranged time correlation of the noise ξ(t).
Higher the H value, greater is the correlation between noises at any time t and the previous
time t0 . The H = 1/2 case on the other hand, is the GWN limit of fGN, where the noise ξ(t)
is completely uncorrelated to previous times t0 and therefore the two successive times are
delta correlated. In addition to the expression of the average level of virions at arbitrary H,
we have also calculated its expression in the limit of H = 1/2. In this limit, the expression
simplifies to simple exponentials. In the short time regime

In the long time regime, for H = 1/2, as evident from Eq(34), there is fast exponential
decrease in the virus levels. However, as seen from Fig. 4, the long time regime shows slow
temporal decay. This cannot be explained by the GWN limit (Eq(34)) of the average virus
levels. Therefore, our model, which includes long ranged noise correlations through fGn
provides a more accurate picture of the viral dynamics. For most of the plots in Fig. 4,
H = 0.55 gives a better fit in comparison to other values.
We have also looked at the effect of the strength of the noise on T cell dynamics. The average
level of T cells in two different time regimes can be derived using Eq(22) and Eq(29). In the
short time regime, this is given by

noise in T cell and viral dynamics respectively. The presence of f (λ) in the argument of
the Mittag-Leffler function leads to a faster increase in the T cells level with increased λ
(as clearance rate γ of T cells has been fixed). Thus in the short time regime, increase in
the strength of the noise will cause an increase in the rate of production of T cells. This
phenomenon may affect the system in a way where T cells attain its peak value before the
maximum viral load and thus might not be optimized to clear all the virus.
In the long time regime, the expression for the average levels of T cells is a product of
a slowly increasing function (power law in time) and a decreasing Mittag-Leffler function.
p
From the expression in Eq(36), it is clear that it is only the pre-factor a/γ that accounts
for the effect of the strength of noise. Thus, an increase in the value of a will affect the
increasing function, but the net effect on T cell levels will not be significant. The T cells
dynamics will show long lived dynamics in the long time regime and will have similar values
for different strengths of the noise. Thus, our model predicts that the noise in the system
may have a major effect at the start of the infection time. The time at which the population
of T cells reaches the maximum value within patients is an important factor. The analysis
of these levels may then help in determining when the immune response modifiers should be
administered to the patients.

19
The present formulation can also be extended to incorporate increasing complexity by considering the effects of susceptible and infected cells on the immune response system. This
model can provide useful insights into the dynamics of various other viral diseases as well,
such as measles, influenza, Zika virus, which also have long incubation period as found in
SARS-CoV-2 [41, 42]. The colored noise incorporated in the model accounts for the long
lived dynamics of the virus and can therefore provide more accurate predictions. These
stochastic models can therefore help in a better understanding of the immune response
system.
