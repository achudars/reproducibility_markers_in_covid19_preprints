Abstract.
COVID-19 is an emergent viral infection which rose in December 2019 in a city in the
Chinese province of Hubei, Wuhan; the viral aetiology of this infection is now known as
COVID-19 virus, which belongs to the Betacoronavirus genus. This virus produces the
syndrome of acute respiratory stress that h as been witnessed in other coronaviruses, such
as that MERS-CoV in Middle East countries or SARS-CoV which was seen in 2002 and
2003 in China. This virus mediates its entry through its spike (S) proteins interacting with
ACE2 receptors in lung epithelial cells, and may promote an inflammatory response by
means of inflammasome NLRP3 activation and unfolded protein response (these are
possibly consequence of the envelope E protein of COVID-19 virus). Efforts have been
made worldwide to prevent further spread of the disease, but in March 2020 the WHO
declared it a pandemic emergency and Mexico started to report its first cases. In this paper
we attempt to summarize the biological features of the virus and the possible
pathophysiological mechanisms of its disease, as well as a stochastic model
characterizing the probability distribution of cases in Mexico by states and the estimated
number of cases in Mexico through a differential equation model (modified SIR model),
thus will we be able to characterize the disease and its course in Mexico in order to display
more preparedness and promote more logical actions by both the policy makers as well
as the general population.

Introduction.
Coronaviruses are known for causing respiratory (if not gastrointestinal or neurological)
diseases in both humans and animals, however before 2002 and 2003 outbreaks of severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in China, this set of viruses was thought to cause
mainly affection in animals (Cui, Li, & Shi, 2019), for it has been calculated that annually
40ùë•109 Gallus gallus domesticus specimens in the world suffer from infectious
bronchitis coronavirus and that 90% of the infected swine by porcine transmissible
gastroenteritis coronavirus die (Cavanagh, 2005). After the 2002-2003 outbreak of SARS
in China, another epidemiologically relevant coronavirus infection rose in Middle East
countries represented by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERSCoV); finally, by the end of 2019, an increase in pneumonias of unknow origin was
revealed in Wuhan, a city in the province of Hubei in China, which were later revealed to
be etiologically related by a novel coronavirus, say 2019-nCoV.
Biology and pathophysiology of coronaviruses.
Coronaviruses are members of the Nidovirales order according to the International
Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (de Groot, et al., 2018) belonging to the
Cornidovirineae suborder, being themselves a family of viruses, the Coronaviridae in
which we may encounter two subfamilies: Letovirinae and Orthocoronavirinae; it is
within the latter subfamily of viruses that we find the genera: Alphacoronavirus,
Betacoronavirus, Deltacoronavirus and Gammacoronavirus. SARS-2003-related
coronavirus is found in the subgenus Sarbecovirus of Betacoronaviruses; while MERSCoV is found in the subgenus Merbecovirus of Betacoronaviruses. An alternative
classification was proposed in which coronaviruses are grouped in tetramers: Group 1
(TGEV, FCoV, CECoV, PEDV, HCoV-229E), Group 2 (HEV, BCoV, CRCoV, MHV,
RtCoV, PuCoV, HCoV-OC43), Group 3 (IBV, TCoV, PhCoV) and Group 4 (SARSCoV) (Cavanagh, 2005). Coronaviruses are enveloped positive-sense RNA viruses and
display the largest genome sizes amongst all RNA viruses (from 26.2 to 31.7 kb
(McBride, van Zyl, & Fielding, 2014). The virions have diameters that range from 80 to
120 nm, however smallest as 50 nm and largest as 200 nm diameters have been noted.
From the envelope some proteins project from 15 to 20 nm, these are spike (S) proteins
and all coronaviruses have genes to code these proteins (S gene) which internalize in the
virion and are mechanically bound by means of a ‚Äúfoot‚Äù like extension of 10 nm long.
Along with these spike proteins, there exist shorter proteins which protrude the virion
surface from 5 to 10 nm, these being the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) proteins (Masters,
2006). The nucleocapsid protein (CoVN) shows conserved regions: N terminal domain
(NTD), C-terminal domain (CTD) and an intrinsically disordered central region (RNAbinding domain); however the name of the domains, all three of them have been shown
to interact with viral RNA. The NTD has shown a grade of divergence amongst
coronaviruses both in amino acid content and length, this domain associated with the 3‚Äô
end of the viral RNA genome by means of Gaussian electrostatic interactions; the NTD
shows convergence in some structural aspects: secondary structures, such as the beta sheet
flanked by alpha helices, a basic RNA binding groove, enrichment in aromatic and basic
residues. The NTD resembles ‚Äúhand‚Äù-like structure: an acidic wrist, a hydrophobic palm
2

and basic fingers. The CTD domain is hydrophobic and promotes homodimerization of
the nucleoprotein (sometimes, not only homodimerization but also oligomerization). This
protein promotes the formation of the viral capsid protecting the virus from degradation
by extracellular agents; the self-association of the N protein has been seen as a target in
coronavirus infection treatment (McBride, van Zyl, & Fielding, 2014). Within the
coronavirus genome we may find the polyproteins, which show replicase activity; this
protein uses the genome as the template for the synthesis producing mRNAs, these are
then translated into structural proteins and others; the structural proteins transit then hatch
to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transiting then towards the ER-Golgi intermediate
compartment (ERGIC). The nucleocapsids are formed when the progeny genomes
interact with the N protein; these newly formed nucleocapsids bud into the ERGIC,
forming then virions ready to exit the cell (Masters, 2006). Coronaviruses‚Äô spike proteins
have been shown to interact with cellular receptors for their internalization into the cell,
such as the human aminopeptidase N protein (ANPEP, membrane alanyl aminopeptidase)
and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Masters, 2006).
CoV proteins.
Spike (S) protein.
This protein contains three segments: a large ectodomain (which consists of a subunit S1
with receptor-binding activity and an S2 subunit with membrane-fusion activity), a
transmembrane anchor and an intracellular tail. Trimerization of the protein is in order
when seen at the microscope having S1 subunits in one extracellular extreme and S2
subunits in the other extreme. Various domains of the spike protein bind to different
proteins/receptors in the host: S1-N-terminal domain binds to sugars (in
Alphacoronavirus), to CEACAM1 (in MHV Betacoronavirus), and sugars in BCoV and
IBV (a Gammacoronavirus). Whereas the S1-C-terminal domain binds to ACE2 (in
Alphacoronaviruses and SARS-CoV), aminopeptidase N (TGEV-PEDV, PRCV), and
DPP4 (in MERS-CoV). The S1 subunits display divergence in their sequences across
genera, however convergence is seen in those of the same genus. The S1 C-terminal
domain subunit contains itself two subdomains (as it has been seen in that S protein
corresponding to SARS-CoV) these subdomains are: a core structure and a receptorbinding motif, this latter subdomain binds to ACE2 by means of a concave outer surface,
this concavity is formed by a beta-sheet with two ridges (loops). Two virus-binding
residues in ACE2 have been shown to highly contribute to the binding of the virus by
promoting a regional hydrophobic environment: Lys31 and Lys353; this specificity can
tell us about how a couple of mutations in both ACE2 or the S1 subunit in the spike
protein may promote either resistance (or increased susceptibility) or species tropism in
regards to the infection. This S1-C-terminal subunit in MERS-CoV binds to DPP4, this
subunit contains as well, in itself, two subdomains: a core structure and a receptor binding
motif, however this motif is not concave but flat, and DPP4 forms a homodimer, each
monomer with a hydrolase domain and a beta-propeller domain (Li, 2016), said structure
(beta propellers) have been seen in various species, and several classes are known,
depending on the symmetry axis, for instance, the neuraminidase protein of the influenza
virus has six four-stranded beta sheets; this beta propeller structure is a highly
symmetrical structure with four to eight-fold repeats of a four-stranded antiparallel betasheet motif, this beta sheets are arranged around a central tunnel, and a hydrophobic
3

character of the interactions provides the stability (Pons, G√≥mez, Chinea, & Valencia,
2003), in the case of DPP4, the viral binding motifs are seen in the other surface of the
beta propeller domain (Li, 2016). It has been noted that the COVID19 S2 subunit displays
a high degree of conservation, contrary to the S1 subunit with 40% of identity with other
SARS-CoVs (Cascella, Rajnik, Dulebohn, & Di Napoli, 2020). The spike protein has
been considered a member of the class I viral membrane fusion proteins, including those
from: influenza virus, human immunodeficiency virus and Ebola virus; in which we may
see: hemagglutinin glycoprotein corresponding to the influenza virus, Env protein in HIV
(trimer of gp120 and gp41 heterodimers (Wilen, Tilton, & Doms, 2012)), and GP
(glycoprotein) in Ebola virus (which is a triplet of heterodimers, composed of a receptor
binding subunit GP1, and a fusion subunit GP2) (Salata, et al., 2019). Analogies can be
made from the fusion process corresponding to influenza virus and hemagglutinin, for
which there exist both a prefusion and a postfusion state, in the latter one there exists a
dramatic conformational change, fusion peptides are exposed and insert into the target
membrane, there is an energy barrier for such a conformational change which may be
overcome by means of receptor binding (as seen in HIV fusion), low pH (influenza virus)
or both (avian leucosis virus); this energy barrier in coronavirus is thought to be worked
out by means of proteolysis of the spike proteins: proprotein convertases, during virus
packaging, extracellular proteases, cell surface proteases, lysosomal proteases; low pH
and receptor binding (as seen in other class I fusion proteins) may as well promote the
reaction and overcome the energy barrier (Li, 2016).
Hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein.
This protein is exclusive to those corresponding to the group 2a of coronaviruses (Zeng,
Langereis, van Vliet, Huizinga, & de Groot, 2008) (mouse hepatitis virus, rat coronavirus,
human respiratory coronaviruses OC43 (HCoV-OC43), HKU1, canine respiratory CoV,
porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus, equine coronavirus, bovine
coronavirus and wild-ruminant coronaviruses (Hasoksuz, Vlasova, & Saif, 2008)),
toroviruses and orthomyxoviruses; this would indicate that RNA recombination and
genetic transfer may have occurred in the past. In coronaviruses, HE does not possess
fusion activity and is merely accessory to the spike protein, nevertheless, they do bind to
sialic acid and have shown to have receptor-destroying activity. The CoV HE has three
domains: a receptor binding domain, an acetylesterase domain, and a membrane-proximal
domain (the thrice show equivalence with those of HEF influenza protein) (Zeng,
Langereis, van Vliet, Huizinga, & de Groot, 2008).
Envelope (E) protein.
It is an integral membrane protein of 76 to 109 amino acids with a molecular weight
ranging from 8.4 to 12 kDa; this protein has a short hydrophylic N-terminus followed by
a large hydrophobic transmembrane domain, ending with a hydrophilic C-terminus; the
transmembrane domain contains ‚â• 1 alpha-helix which may oligomerize and forms an
ion-conductive pore. It has been also noted that mutations to the PDZ-binding motif
(PBM) are endured and may show value in vaccine development. It may have a function
in virion budding as it interacts with the Golgi apparatus. It has showed interesting protein
interactions with hosts, such as the one noted with BCLXL (BCL2 like 1), PALS1
(MPP5), Na/K ATPase alpha1 subunit, stomatin. Because of its interactions with the
4

endoplasmic reticulum, this has been linked to enhancement of the unfolded protein
response (UPR) during infection; and due to the fact that the envelope protein promotes
the formation of viroporins, transport of calcium by the E protein promotes
inflammosome activation (Schoeman & Fielding, 2019).
Host proteins.
ACE2.
This gene encodes the angiotensin I converting enzyme 2, which is a member of the
angiotensin-converting enzyme family of dipeptidyl carboxypeptidases showing
homology to human angiotensin I converting enzyme. This enzyme catalyzes the
cleavage of angiotensin I into angiotensin (1-9) and angiotensin II into angiotensin (1-7);
it is as well a receptor for the novel COVID19-virus. The gene encoding for this protein
is found in Xp22.2 and has 21 exons. This protein is expressed in the following tissues:
colon, duodenum, fat, gall bladder, heart, kidney, liver, testis, thyroid and lung amongst
others (NIH, 2020), the tissue expression of ACE2 is augmented in patients with type 1
or type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and those who are under treatment with
thiazolidinediones and ibuprofen (Fang, Karakiulakis, & Roth, 2020) however those who
have not yet received treatment show lower expression levels, this mechanism is thought
to be mediated by angiotensin II via ERK/p38 MAP or ERK1/2 and JNK, furthermore,
should we block AT1R, ACE2 levels rise, this rise can also be obtained by administering
low doses of aldosterone, and decreases are seen when treated with endothelin 1 (Clarke
& Turner, 2011); as well interethnic differences in expression patterns have been noted
which may predispose to different susceptibilities (Cao, et al., 2020). One of the catalysed
products of ACE2 is angiotensin (1-7) which serves to activate MAS1 proto-oncogene,
which is a G protein-coupled receptor, its actions include: vasodilation, vascular
protection, anti-fibrotic, anti-proliferative and reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines
(Clarke & Turner, 2011). Thus, we may consider ACE2 production pathways-blockage
in order to diminish the probability of COVID19-virus to be received and internalized by
the cell, by means of JNK (MAPK8), MAPK14 (p38), endothelin-1, AT1R agonists or
aldosterone receptors antagonists (spironolactone, eplerenone). ACE2 has been shown to
interact itself with two small molecules: moexipril and lisinopril, which may induce
conformational changes in ACE2 necessary to diminish the hydrophobicity of the region
responsible of the interaction with the spike (S) proteins of coronaviruses (TyersLab,
2020), other chemicals have been noted: 2-amino-N,N-diethyl-1,3-benzothiazole-6carboxamide (also displaying anti-HIV reverse transcriptase activity and antibacterial
activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis) (PubChem, 2020), losartan, D-glucose,
streptozotocin, captopril, diminazene aceturate (PubChem, 2020).
BCLXL (BCL2 like 1).
It belongs to the BCL2 protein family, which may homo- or heterodimerize and may
either promote or suppress apoptosis regulators; this protein may locate at the outer
mitochondrial membrane and may regulate the opining of the outer mitochondrial
membrane channel thus being able to change mitochondrial membrane potential, reactive
oxygen species production and release of cytochrome c, inducers of apoptosis. It shows
two isoforms, the longer is antiapoptotic and the shorter is a proapoptotic (NIH, 2020),
and it has been seen that BCLXL interacts with the envelope E protein of coronaviruses,
5

enabling then the apoptosis of T cells, compatible with the clinical features of
lymphopoenia seen in coronaviruses infections (Yang, et al., 2005).
Pathophysiology.
Until now, we have unravelled two clues which may lead to the development of a solid
pathophysiological theory: promotion of inflammasome formation and increase in the
unfolded protein response, as well as changes in the apoptotic range of certain cells (such
as T cells), in regards to the promotion of inflammasome formation, should there be an
activation of the NLRP1 inflammasome by means of NLRP1‚Äôs cleavage, inducing
NLPR1B, the latter would induce ASC protein or PYCARD protein (PYD and CARD
domain containing protein), promoting the activation of caspase 1 and the consequent
activation of interleukin 1 B and interleukin 18 or a pyroptotic death (Broz & Dixit, 2016).
However it has been seen that the E protein from SARS viruses induce NLRP3
inflammasome response (Chen, Moriyama, Chang, & Ichinohe, 2019) perhaps by means
of the interaction there is sustained with BCLXL and pore formation in mitochondria,
which may induce a potassium efflux (reducing the amounts of intracellular potassium)
leading to NLRP3 activation, this aided by means of NEK7 which has been shown as a
driving factor in cellular division, where NEK7 increased levels diminish mitotic rate and
inflammasome activation and caspase 1 activation, also leading then to IL1B and IL18
concentration increases (Broz & Dixit, 2016), the NLRP3 inflammasome activation has
been related not only to recruitment of caspase 1 but also of caspase 4 and 5 (PubChem,
2020), moreover, NLRP3 is an upstream activator of NFKB (NIH, 2020); because of
these various interactions that NLRP3 shows and the possible clinical signs and
symptoms we may encounter due to this activation, it could be advisable in certain cases
to induce NLRP3 inactivation in order to diminish respiratory distress by means of small
molecules (PubChem, 2020). In regards to IL1B signalling, it has been seen that it
interacts with its receptor IL1R, activating IRAK4 (interleukin 1 receptor associated
kinase), activating TRAF6 (TNF receptor associated factor 6) and some other
downstream proteins (TAB2, TAK1, MKK3, p38), finally promoting the activation of
IL6, IL8, as well as COX2, NFKB (Weber, Wasiliew, & Kracht, 2010); thus we may see
as well that the restrictions in oxygenation seen in SARS may be very well induced by
means of an overt inflammation by COVID19-virus. In turn, the unfolded protein
response pathway that is seen activated by means of the envelope protein promotes the
activation of NFKB and MAPK8, XBP1u (unspliced X box-binding protein 1) which
promotes UPR target genes transcription, EIF2A (this factor inhibits translation and
activates ATF4, augmenting UPR target genes transcription), AT6F (also promotes UPR
target genes); the phenotype of the UPR target genes transcription is: autophagy,
apoptosis, co-translational degradation, protein secretion, lipid synthesis (Hetz, 2012).
Model.
This model consists of two portions: a discrete time discrete Markov chain which shall
predict the probability distribution of COVID19 in time in the Mexican population, for
said chain we require the knowledge or the estimation of the infected population in given
time, information that shall be known by the SIR (susceptible, infected, recovered)
differential equation model of infections.
Discrete Markov chain.

This chain consists of 32 states which correspond to the states in the political territory
division of the Mexican Republic, thus ùê∏ = {ùëíùëñ : ùëí ‚àà ùëÄ, ùëñ ‚àà ‚Ñï} where M stands for the
Mexican territory, this set maps to ùëÜ = {ùë†1 , ùë†2 , ‚Ä¶ , ùë†32 } of discrete states ùëì: ùê∏ ‚Üí ùëÜ in a
bijective fashion; let us call U this process, then ùëá ‚äÇ ùëà where T stands for the set of
temporal parameters, ùëá = {ùë°ùëó |ùëó ‚àà ‚Ñï} where the j-th stands for the j-th day or [ùëó] = [ùëëùëéùë¶],
i.e., the corresponding unit of the temporal parameter is the day. Now let us establish the
conditions of probability, ‚àÄùë†ùëñ ùëÖùë†ùëò ‚àÉùëùùëñùëò ‚àà Œ©, for every existence of a relationship between
the i-th and the k-th state there exists an associated probability ik for the transition from
the i-th towards the k-th state, being this probability balanced between all the existent
possible interactions between one i-th state and another any k-th state, for example, should
the i-th state interact with n different states, then the associated probability for every ùë†ùëñ ùëÖùë†ùëò
1
is ùëùùëñùëò = ùëõ. The existence of an interaction between one state and another one is stated by
means of the sharing of territorial boundaries. This process is featured by a stochastic
matrix P,

This matrix is shown in Fig. 1 where ‚àë32
ùëñ=1 ùëù1ùëõ = 1.
The initial vector of this process is one which displays the COVID19 features in Mexico
by means of the report corresponding to 11/03/2020 issued by the Mexican Health
Department, with the following cases: Mexico City, 5 cases; Coahuila, 1 case; Chiapas,
1 case; Sinaloa, 1 case (also a recovered case); Mexico State, 2 cases; Quer√©taro, 1 case.
Thus, the total amount of cases can be described as the cardinality of the set of cases C,
#ùëêùëéùë†ùëíùë†
|ùê∂| = 11 and the probabilities of the initial vector ùúã 0 for any given state are ùúãùëñ =

|ùê∂|

The vectors then can be determined for any given discrete time ùë°ùëñ ‚àà ùëá,

ùúã 2 = ùúã 0 ùëÉ2
‚ãÆ
ùúã ùëõ = ùúã 0 ùëÉùëõ
By computing the powers of the stochastic matrix we have computed the probability
distributions when, ùëõ = 2, 4, 8, 20, 40, 80, 160, 320 reminding us that the units of this
temporal parameter is [ùë°] = [ùëëùëéùë¶] thus we may compute the probability distributions of
COVID19 for the following dates: 13/03/2020, 15/03/2020, 19/03/2020, 27/03/2020,
31/03/2020, 20/04/2020, 30/05/2020, 18/08/2020, 25/01/2020 whose graph is shown in
Fig. 2.
When we compute the n-th power of the stochastic matrix we may realize as well of the
stationary distribution of our set of variables or states, in this case, we may realize that
there exists a tendency towards a stationary distribution, and the comparison between
25/01/2021 and 11/03/2020 is shown in Fig. 3, in which we may come to notice the
7

decrease in inflexion points when ùëõ = 320 and the tendency towards a stabilisation,
where the peaks of infection are reduced, and a homogeneous spread of the disease is
witnessed. The probability distribution of every state when ùëõ = 320 is shown in Fig. 4;
this last graph allows us to regard that the state with the highest probability or the highest
prevalence at the given time is Campeche, followed by Quintana Roo; being the state with
the lowest prevalence the Baja California Sur; but in no state do we observe ùëù = 0. We
have then successfully computed the probability distribution of every state in time,
however we do not know the precise population in given time, the precise amount of total
infected people, for which we will need the second model.
Modified SIR model.
This model allows us to know the amount of susceptible, infected and recovered people
in our population set. The model will be derived from the following thesis,
ùëÜ ‚Üí ùëò1 ùêº ‚Üí ùëò 2 ùëÖ
Where S stands for susceptible population, I for infected population and R for recovered
population; by means of chemical kinetics we may construct an analogy to these set of
reactions,
‚àí

Now, let us consider ùë†0 as the initial susceptible population and ùë†0 ‚àí ùë• as the amount of
susceptible people lost in the time of the disease,
ùëÜ = ùë†0 ‚àí ùë•

We may estimate the proportions of the infected, susceptible and recovered populations
in Mexico (Table 1).
Gather round!
Let us now commute both models we have previously discussed in order to provide the
cases‚Äô distribution in the states of our Markov chain (or the States of Mexico) (Fig. 5)
where we may notice the slow infective rate of COVID19, and a tendency to spread in
every state in Mexico where by n=320, there will be ùëê ‚â• 1 cases per state, should there
be no preventive measures taken.
