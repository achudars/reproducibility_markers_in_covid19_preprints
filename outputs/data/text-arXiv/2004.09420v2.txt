Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered an urgent need to contribute to the fight against an immense threat to the
human population. Computer Vision, as a subfield of Artificial Intelligence, has enjoyed recent success in solving
various complex problems in health care and has the potential to contribute to the fight of controlling COVID-19. In
response to this call, computer vision researchers are putting their knowledge base at work to devise effective ways
to counter COVID-19 challenge and serve the global community. New contributions are being shared with every
passing day. It motivated us to review the recent work, collect information about available research resources and an
indication of future research directions. We want to make it available to computer vision researchers to save precious
time. This survey paper is intended to provide a preliminary review of the available literature on the computer vision
efforts against COVID-19 pandemic.

Introduction

COVID 19, an infectious disease is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) [51] and named
coronavirus due to visual appearance (under an electron microscope) to solar corona (similar to a crown) [14]. The
fight against COVID 19 has motivated researchers worldwide to explore, understand, and devise new diagnostic and
treatment techniques to culminate this threat to our generation. In this article, we discuss how the computer vision
community is fighting with this menace by proposing new types of approaches, improving efficiency, and speed of the
existing efforts.
Computer vision is an interdisciplinary field that deals with how computers can develop a high-level understanding
by interpreting information present in digital images. It has made substantial progress in the last few years, mainly
due to the success of deep learning, a sub-field of machine learning. Computer vision techniques have shown enormous
scope in various applications areas, especially in healthcare and medical research. A plethora of novel computer vision
approaches in healthcare applications exist that include, but not limited to, disease diagnosis, prognosis, surgery,
therapy, medical image analysis and drug discovery [25]. This success has enabled computer vision scientists to take
the challenge as soldiers in the fight against COVID-19 by contributing to disease diagnosis, prognosis, prevention,
control, treatment and management.
The scientific response to combat COVID-19 has been far quicker and widespread. According to PubMed [1], in
the year 2019, 755 academic papers published including the word “coronavirus” but even in the first 80 days of 2020
alone, the number rose to astounding 1,245 articles about the family of viruses. The economist has dubbed it “science
of the times” with the hope that such efforts would help speed up the development of a COVOD-19 vaccine [1].
Numerous approaches in computer vision have been proposed so far, dealing with different aspects of combat the
COVID-19 pandemic. These approaches differ from each other based on the way they approach the fundamental
questions: How can medical imaging facilitate faster and reliable diagnosis of COVID-19? Which image features
properly classify conditions as Bacterial, Viral, COVID-19, and Pneumonia? What can we learn from imaging data
acquired from disease survivors to screen critical and non-critical ill patients? How can computer vision be used
to enforce social distancing and early screening of infected people? How can 3D computer vision help to maintain
healthcare equipment supply and guide the development of a COVID-19 vaccine? The answers to these questions are
being explored, and preliminary work has been done. The goal of this survey is to group computer vision methods

1/24

into broad categories and provide comprehensive descriptions of representative methods in each category. We aspire
to give readers the ability to understand the baseline efforts and kickstart their work where others have left. Moreover,
we aim to identify new trends and ideas to build a more robust and well-planned strategy in this war of our times.

Our survey will include research papers in pre-print format due to time urgency imposed by this disease. It is
not an optimal approach due to the risk of lower quality and work without due validation. Many of the works have
not been put into clinical trial as it is time-consuming. Nevertheless, our intention here is to share ideas from a
single platform while highlighting the computer vision community efforts. We hope that our reader is aware of these
contemporary challenges.
We follow a bottom-up approach to describing the research problems that need addressing first. We start with
disease diagnosis, discuss disease prevention and control, followed by treatment-related computer vision research work.
Section 2 describes the overall taxonomy of computer vision research areas by classifying these efforts into three
classes. Section 3 provides a detailed description of each research area, relevant papers and a brief description of
representative work. Section 4 describes available resources including research datasets, their links, deep learning
models and codes. Section 5 provides the discussion and future work directions followed by concluding remarks and
references.

HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT

The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (previously known as 2019-nCoV ) is the seventh member of the Coronaviridae
family of viruses which are enveloped, non-segmented, positive-sense RNA viruses [33]. The mortality rate of
COVID-19 is less than that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome
(MERS) coronavirus diseases (10% for SARS-CoV and 37% for MERS-CoV). However, it is highly infectious, and the
number of cases has been increasing rapidly [62].

2/24

The disease outbreak first reported in Wuhan, the Hubei province of China [33], after several cases of pneumonia
with unknown causes were reported on 31 December 2019. A novel coronavirus was discovered as the causative
organism through deep sequencing analysis of samples of patients’ respiratory tract at Chinese facilities on 7 January
2020 [62]. The outbreak was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020. On 11
February 2020, the World health organization (WHO)announced a name for the new coronavirus disease: COVID-19.
It was officially being considered pandemic after 11 March announcement by WHO [75].

TAXONOMY OF KEY AREAS OF RESEARCH

In this section, we describe the classification of computer vision techniques that try to counter the menace of
COVID-19. For better comprehensibility, we have classified them into three key areas of research: (i) diagnosis and
prognosis, (ii) disease prevention and control, and (iii) disease treatment and management. This taxonomy is shown
in Figure 2. In the following subsections, we discuss the research fields, the relevant papers, and present a brief
representative description of related works.

Diagnosis and Prognosis

An essential step in this fight is the reliable, faster and affordable diagnostic process that can be readily accessible and
available to the global community. According to Cambridge dictionary [80], diagnosis is ”the making of a judgment
about the exact character of a disease or other problem, esp. after an examination, or such a judgment” and prognosis
is ”a doctor’s judgment of the likely or expected development of a disease or of the chances of getting better”.
Currently, Reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) tests are considered as the
gold standard for diagnosing COVID-19 [71]. During such a test, small amounts of viral RNA are extracted from
a nasal swab, amplified, quantified. Virus detection is then performed using a fluorescent dye. Although accurate,
the test is time-consuming and manual, which limits its availability in large scales. Some studies have also shown
false-positive PCR testing [10].

3.1.1

Computed Tomography (CT) scan

An alternative approach is the use of radiology examination that uses computed tomography (CT) imaging [3]. A
chest CT scan is a non-invasive test conducted to obtain a precise image of a patient’s chest. It uses an enhanced
form of x-ray technology, providing more detailed images of the chest than a standard x-ray. It produces images that
include bones, fats, muscles, and organs, giving physicians a better view, which is crucial when making accurate
diagnoses.
There are two types of chest CT scan, namely the high-resolution and spiral chest CT scan [77]. The high-resolution
chest CT scan provides more than a slice (or image) in a single rotation of the x-ray tube. The spiral chest CT scan
application involves a table that continuously moves through a tunnel-like hole while the x-ray tube follows a spiral
path. The advantage of the spiral CT is that it is capable of producing a three-dimensional image of the lungs.

Figure 3. CT images adapted from [62] [41] portray CT features related to COVID-19. Ground glass opacities
(top) and ground glass halo (bottom).
Important CT features include ground-glass opacity, consolidation, reticulation/thickened interlobular septa,
nodules, and lesion distribution (left, right or bilateral lungs) [42] [44] [13] [34]. The most observable CT features
discovered in COVID-19 pneumonia are bilateral and subpleural areas of ground-glass opacification, consolidation
affecting the lower lobes. Within the intermediate stage (4–14 days from symptom onset), crazy-paving pattern and
possibly observable Halo sign become important features as well [10] [3] [62] [3] [42] [44] [13] [41] [34]. One case of CT

images is shown in figure 3. As the identification of disease features is time-consuming, even for expert radiologists,
computer vision can help by automating such a process.
Representative Work, Evaluation and Discussion
To date, various CT-scanning automated approaches have been proposed [3] [78] [50] [22] [80] [77] [42] [44] [13] [41]
[11] [86] [40] [43] [85]. To discuss the approach and performance of the computer vision CT-based disease diagnosis,
we have selected some recent representative works that provide an overview of their effectiveness. It is worth noting
that they have been presenting different performance metrics and using a diverse number of images and datasets.
These practices make their comparison very challenging. Some of the metrics include Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity,
Area Under Curve (AUC), Positive predictive value (PPV), Negative predictive value (NPV), and F1 score. A
quick elucidation on their definition can be useful. The accuracy of a method determines how correct the values
are predicted. The precision determines the reproducibility of the measurement or how many of the predictions are
correct. Recall shows how many of the correct results are discovered. F1-score uses a combination of precision and
recall to calculate a balanced average result.
The first class of work discussed here approaches diagnosis as a segmentation problem. Jun Chen et al. [11] has
proposed a CT image dataset of 46,096 images of both healthy and infected patients, labeled by expert radiologists. It
was collected from 106 patients admitted with 51 confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and 55 control patients. The work
used deep learning models for segmentation only so that it could identify the infected area in CT images between
healthy and infected patients. It was based on UNet++ semantic segmentation model [86], used to extract valid areas
in the images. It used 289 randomly selected CT images and tested it on other 600 randomly selected CT images. The
model achieved a per-patient sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 93.55%, accuracy of 95.24%, PPV (positive prediction
value) of 84.62%, and NPV(negative prediction value) of 100%. In the retrospective dataset, it resulted in a per-image
sensitivity of 94.34%, specificity of 99.16%, accuracy of 98.85%, PPV of 88.37%, and NPV of 99.61%. The trained
model from this study was deployed at the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (Wuhan, Hubei province, China)
to accelerate the diagnosis of new COVID-19 cases. It was also open-sourced on the Internet as to enable rapid
review of new cases in other locations. A cloud-based open-access artificial intelligence platform was constructed to
provide support for detecting COVID-19 pneumonia worldwide. For this purpose, a website has been made available
to provide free access to the present model at (http://121.40.75.149/znyx-ncov/index).
The second type of work considered COVID-19 as a binary classification problem. Lin Li [40] proposed (COVNet),
to extract visual features from volumetric chest CT using transfer learning on the RESNET50. Lung segmentation
was performed as a pre-processing task using the U-Net model. It used 4356 chest CT exams from 3,322 patients
from the dataset collected from 6 hospitals between August 2016 and February 2020. The sensitivity and specificity
for COVID-19 are 90% (114 of 127; p-value¡0.001) with 95% confidence interval (CI) of [95% CI: 83%, 94%] and 96%
(294 of 307; p-value¡0.001) with [95% CI: 93%, 98%], respectively. The model was also made available online for
public use at https://github.com/bkong999/COVNet.
The diagnosis problem was also approached as a 3-category classification task: distinguishing healthy patients from
those with other types of pneumonia and those with COVID-19. Song et al. [40] used data from 88 patients diagnosed
with the COVID-19, 101 patients infected with bacteria pneumonia, and 86 healthy individuals. It proposed DRE-Net
(Relation Extraction neural network) based on ResNet50, on which the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) [43] and the
Attention module were integrated to represent more fine-grained aspects of the images. An online server is available
for online diagnoses with CT images at http://biomed.nsccgz.cn/server/Ncov2019.
Due to limited time available for annotations and labelling, weakly-supervised deep learning-based approaches
have also been developed using 3D CT volumes to detect COVID-19. Chuansheng Zheng [85] proposed 3D deep
convolutional neural Network (DeCoVNet) to Detect COVID-19 from CT volumes. The weakly supervised deep
learning model could accurately predict the COVID-19 infectious probability in chest CT volumes without the need
for annotating the lesions for training. The CT images were segmented using a pre-trained UNet. It used 499
CT volumes for training, collected from 13 December 2019 to 23 January 2020, and 131 CT volumes for testing,
collected from 24 January 2020 to 6 February 2020. The authors chose a probability threshold of 0.5 to classify
COVID-positive and COVID-negative cases. The algorithm obtained an accuracy of 0.901, a positive predictive
value of 0.840, and a high negative predictive value of 0.982. The developed deep learning model is available at
https://github.com/sydney0zq/covid-19-detection.

X-ray Imagery

The drawback of using CT imaging is the need for high patient dose and enhanced cost [38]. It makes digital chest
x-ray radiography (CXR) as the imaging modality with the lower cost and wider availability for detecting chest
pathology. Therefore, automated diagnosis of COVID-19 features in CXR will make it a highly useful diagnostic
tool against the disease. Digital X-ray imagery computer-aided diagnosis is used for different diseases, including
osteoporosis [55], cancer [4] and cardiac disease [66]. However, as it is really hard to distinguish soft tissue with a
poor contrast in X-ray imagery, contrast enhancement is used as pre-processing step [36] [21]. Lung segmentation of
chest X-rays is a crucial and important step in order to identify lung nodules and various segmentation approaches
are proposed in the literature [54] [9] [19] [24].
CXR examinations have shown consolidation in COVID-19 infected patients. In one study at Hong Kong [48],
three different patients had daily CXR, two of them showed progression in the lung consolidation over 3-4 days.
Further CXR examinations show improvement over the subsequent two days. The third patient showed no significant
changes over an 8-day period. However, a similar study showed that the ground glass opacities in the right lower
lobe periphery on the CT are not visible on the chest radiograph, which was taken 1 hour apart from the first study.
However, CXR is still recommended alongside CT for better radiological analysis. Various CXR-related automated
approaches have been proposed. The following section discusses the most salient work while Table 2 presents a more
systematic presentation of such methods.
Representative Work, Evaluation and Discussion
To date, many deep learning-based computer vision models for X-ray COVID-19 were proposed. One of the most
significant development is the model COVID-Net [23] proposed by Darwin AI, Canada. In this work, human-driven
principled network design prototyping is combined with machine-driven design exploration to produce a network
architecture for the detection of COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray. The first stage of the human-machine collaborative
design strategy is based on residual architecture design principles. The dataset used to train and evaluate COVID-Net,
is referred to as COVIDx [23] and comprise a total of 16,756 chest radiography images across 13,645 patient cases.
The proposed model achieved 92.4% accuracy 80% sensitivity for COVID-19 diagnosis.
The initial network design prototype makes one of three classes: a) no infection (normal), b) non-COVID19
infection (viral and bacterial), and c) COVID-19 viral infection. The goal is to aid clinicians to better decide which
treatment strategy to employ depending on the cause of infection, since COVID-19 and non-COVID19 infections
require different treatment plans. In the second stage, data, along with human-specific design requirements, act as
a guide to a design exploration strategy to learn and identify the optimal macro- and microarchitecture designs to
construct the final tailor-made deep neural network architecture. The proposed COVIDNet network diagram is shown
in Fig. 4 and available publicly at https://github.com/lindawangg/COVID-Net.
Ezz El-Din Hemdan et al. [31] proposed the COVIDX-Net based on seven different architectures of DCNNs;
namely VGG19, DenseNet201 [82], InceptionV3, ResNetV2, InceptionResNetV2, Xception, and MobileNetV2 [58].
These models were trained on COVID-19 cases provided by Dr Joseph Cohen and Dr Adrian Rosebrock, available
at https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset [17]. Tthe best model combination resulted in F1scores of 0.89 and 0.91 for normal and COVID-19 cases. Similarly, Asmaa Abbas et al. [2] proposed a Decompose,
Transfer, and Compose (DeTraC) approach for the classification of COVID-19 chest X-ray images. The authors applied
CNN features of pre-trained models on ImageNet and ResNet to perform the diagnoses. The dataset consisted of 80
samples of normal CXRs (with 4020 x 4892 pixels) from the Japanese Society of Radiological Technology (JSRT) Cohen
JP. COVID-19 image data collection, available at https://githubcom/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset [17].
This model achieved an accuracy of 95.12% (with a sensitivity of 97.91%, a specificity of 91.87%, and a precision of
93.36%). The code is available at https://github.com/asmaa4may/DeTraCCOVId19.
Uncertainty-Aware COVID-19 Classification and Referral model was introduced by tBiraja Ghoshal et al. [27]
with the proposed Dropweights based on Bayesian Convolutional Neural Networks (BCNN). In order for COVID-19
detection to be meaningful, two tyes of predictive uncertainty in deep learning were used on a subsequent work [20].
One of it is Epistemic or Model uncertainty accounts for the model parameters uncertainty as it does not take all of
the aspects of the data into account or the lack of training data. The other is Aleatoric uncertainty that accounts for
noise inherent in the observations due to class overlap, label noise, homoscedastic and heteroscedastic noise, which
cannot be reduced even if more data were to be collected. Bayesian Active Learning by Disagreement (BALD) [32],

Dr Joseph Cohen’s Github repository [17], augmented the dataset with Kaggle’s Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)

Prevention and Control

WHO has provided some guidelines on infection prevention and control (IPC) strategies for use when infection
with a novel coronavirus is suspected [49]. Major IPC strategies to limit transmission in health care settings include
early recognition and source control, applying standard precautions for all patients; implementing additional empiric
precautions like airborne precautions for suspected cases of COVID-19; implementing administrative controls and
using environmental and engineering controls. Computer vision applications are providing excellent support for the
implementation of IPC strategies.
Representative Work, Evaluation and Discussion
The use of masks or protective equipment to limit the virus spread was a strategy identified in the early stage of
disease progression. Some countries, China being the most prominent example, implemented it as a control strategy.
Computer vision-based systems greatly facilitated such implementation.
Zhongyuan Wang et al. [74] proposed Masked Face Recognition approach using a multigranularity masked face
recognition model, resulting in 95% accuracy on a masked face images dataset. The data was made public for research
and provide three types of masked face datasets, including Masked Face Detection Dataset (MFDD) [83], Real-world
Masked Face Recognition Dataset (RMFRD) and Simulated Masked Face Recognition Dataset (SMFRD) [18].
Infrared thermography was also recommended as an early detection strategy for infected people, especially in
crowns like passengers on an airport. A comprehensive review of medical applications of infrared thermography is
provided by B.B. Lahiri [74] [39], including fever screening. Somboonkaew et al. [63] proposed a mobile-platform
for an automatic fever screening system based on infrared forehead temperature. Best practices for standardized
performance and testing of infrared thermographs intended for fever screening are discussed by Ghassemi et al. [26].
Negishi T [47] proposed an Infection Screening System Using Thermography and CCD Camera with Good Stability
and Swiftness for Non-contact Vital-Signs Measurement by Feature Matching and MUSIC Algorithm. Earlier for
SARD spread control, Chiu et al. [15] proposed a computer vision systems help in fever screening, which was used
in earlier outbreaks of SARS. From 13 April to 12 May 2003, 72,327 patients and visitors passed through the only
entrance allowed at TMU-WFH where a thermography station was in operation.

Figure 7. Temperature screening in process using thermal images of a subject talking on a hand-held mobile phone;
(a) after 1 min and (b) after 15 min of talking. After 15 min of talking the temperature of the encircled region
increased from 30.56 to 35.15 C, whereas the temperature of the ear region (indicated by an arrow) increased from
33.35 to 34.82C. Similar system can be used for fever screening.
Additional miscellaneous approaches for prevention and control are also worth noting. An example is pandemic
drones using remote sensing and digital imagery, which were recommended for identifying infected people. Al-Naji
et al. [5] have used such a system for remote life sign monitoring in disaster management in the past. A similar
application is to use vision-guided robot control for 3D object recognition and manipulation. Moreover, 3D modelling
and printers are helping to maintain the supply of healthcare equipment in this troubled time. Joshua M. Pearce [52]
discusses RepRap-class 3-D printers and open-source microcontrollers. The applications are relevant since mass
distributed manufacturing of ventilators has the potential to overcome medical supply shortages. Lastly, germ
scanning is an important step against combating COVID-19. Edouard A. Hay [30] have proposed a convolutional
neural network for germ scanning such as the identification of bacteria Light-sheet microscopy image data with more
than 90% accuracy.

Clinical Management and Treatment

To date, there is no specific treatment for disease caused by the COVID-19 virus. However, many of the symptoms
can be treated and therefore, treatment will depend on the patient’s clinical condition. Clinical management practices
can be improved with practices like classifying patients based on the severity of the disease and providing them with
immediate medical care. Due to the multidisciplinary nature of computer vision, it has the potential to support
various teams that are currently working on creating vaccination for the disease as well as clinical management.
Representative Work, Evaluation and Discussion
An essential part of the fight against the virus is clinical management, which can be done by identifying patients that
are critically ill so that they get immediate medical attention or ventilator support. A disease progression score is
recommended to classify different types of infected patients in [29]. It is called corona score” and is calculated by
measurements of infected areas and the severity of disease from CT images. The corona score measures the progression
of patients over time, and it is computed by a volumetric summation of the network-activation maps.
Graeme MacLaren [45] supports that radiological evidence can also be an important tool to distinguish critical
ill patients. Yunlu Wang [73] used depth camera and deep learning as abnormal respiratory patterns classifier that
may contribute to large-scale screening of people infected with the virus accurately and unobtrusively. Respiratory
Simulation Model (RSM) is first proposed to fill the gap between the large amount of training data and scarce real-world
data. They proposed GRU neural network with bidirectional and attentional mechanisms (BI-AT-GRU) to classify six
clinically significant respiratory patterns (Eupnea, Tachypnea, Bradypnea, Biots, Cheyne-Stokes and Central-Apnea)
to identify critically ill patients. The proposed model can classify the respiratory patterns with accuracy, precision,
recall and F1 of 94.5%, 94.4%, 95.1% and 94.8%, respectively. Demo videos of this method working in situations of
one subject and two subjects can be accessed online (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.11493666.v1).
The CoV spike (S) glycoprotein is a key target for vaccines, therapeutic antibodies, and diagnostics that can guide
future decisions. The virus binds to host cells through its trimeric spike glycoprotein. Using biophysical assays, the
Daniel Wrapp et al. [76] showed that this protein binds at least ten times more tightly than the corresponding spike
protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV to their common host cell receptor. These studies provide
valuable information to guide the development of medical countermeasures for 2019-nCoV.
Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis has perspectives on drug discovery and toxicology [53].
It employs structural, quantum chemical and physicochemical features calculated from molecular geometry as
explanatory variables predicting physiological activity. Deep feature representation learning can be used for QSAR
analysis by incorporating 360° images of molecular conformations into deep learning. Yoshihiro Uesaw [68] proposed
QSAR (Quantitative structure-activity relationship) analysis using deep learning based on a novel molecular image
input technique. Such techniques can be used for drug discovery and can pave the way for vaccine development.

DATASET AND RESOURCES

CT images
• COVID-CT-Dataset [84]- The University of San Diego has released a data set with 349 CT images containing
clinical findings of COVID-19. It claims to be the largest of its kind. To demonstrate its potential, an AI model
is trained, achieving 85% accuracy. The data set is available at https://github.com/UCSD-AI4H/COVID-CT.
• An image-based model working with CTs for COVID-19 diagnosis can be found at https://github.com/
JordanMicahBennett/SMART-CT-SCAN_BASED-COVID19_VIRUS_DETECTOR/.

CX-ray images
• COVID-19 Radiography database [16] - A team of researchers from Qatar University, Doha, and the University
of Dhaka, Bangladesh, along with collaborators from Pakistan and Malaysia with medical doctors have created
a database of chest X-ray images for COVID-19 positive cases along with Normal and Viral Pneumonia images.
In the current release, there are 219 COVID-19 positive images, 1341 normal images and 1345 viral pneumonia
images. The authors said that they would continue to update this database as soon as new x-ray images for
COVID-19 pneumonia patients. The project can be found at GitHub with MATLAB codes and trained models:
https://github.com/tawsifur/COVID-19-Chest-X-ray-Detection. The research team managed to classify
COVID-19, Viral pneumonia and Normal Chest X-ray images with an accuracy of 98.3%. This scholarly work
was submitted to Scientific Reports (Nature), and the manuscript was uploaded to ArXiv. Please make sure to
give credit while using the dataset, code and trained models.
• COVID-19 Image Data Collection [17]- An initial COVID-19 open image data collection is provided by Joseph
Paul Cohen. all images and data are released under the following URL https://github.com/ieee8023/
covid-chestxray-dataset.
• COVIDx Dataset [69]- This is the release of the brand-new COVIDx dataset with 16,756 chest radiography images across 13,645 patient cases. The current COVIDx dataset is constructed by the opensource chest radiography datasets at https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset and https:
//www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge. It is a combination of data provided by many
parties: the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA), others involved in the RSNA Pneumonia Detection
Challenge, Dr Joseph Paul Cohen, and the team at MILA, involved in the COVID-19 image data collection
project for making data available to the global community.
• ChestX-ray8 [72]- The chest X-ray is one of the most commonly accessible radiological examinations for screening
and diagnosis of many lung diseases. A tremendous number of X-ray imaging studies accompanied by radiological
reports are accumulated and stored in many modern hospitals’ Picture Archiving and Communication Systems
(PACS), available at https://nihcc.app.box.com/v/ChestXray-NIHCC).

Other images
• Masked Face Recognition Datasets [74] - Three types of masked face datasets were introduced, including Masked
Face Detection Dataset (MFDD), Real-world Masked Face Recognition Dataset (RMFRD) and Simulated
Masked Face Recognition Dataset (SMFRD). MFDD dataset can be used to train an accurate masked face
detection model, which serves for the subsequent masked face recognition task. RMFRD dataset includes
5,000 pictures of 525 people wearing masks and 90,000 images of the same 525 subjects without masks. To
the best of our knowledge, this is currently the world’s largest real-world masked face dataset. SMFRD is a
simulated masked face data set covering 500,000 face images of 10,000 subjects. These datasets are available at
https://github.com/X-zhangyang/Real-World-Masked-Face-Dataset.
• Thermal Images Datasets - There is no dataset of thermals for high fever screening. However, a fully annotated
thermal face database and its application for thermal facial expression recognition were proposed by Marcin
Kopaczka [37]. Information on further ideas of related data that can be figured out by using such systems

CONCLUSION REMARKS

In this article, we presented an extensive survey of computer vision efforts and methods to combat the COVID-19
pandemic challenge and also gave a brief review of the representative work to date. We divide the described methods
into three categories based on their role in disease control: Computed Tomography (CT) scans, X-ray Imagery, and
Prevention and Control. We provide detailed summaries of preliminary representative work, including available
resources to facilitate further research and development. We hope that, in this first survey on Computer vision
methods for COVID-19 control with extensive bibliography content, one can find give valuable insight into this domain
and encourage new research. However, this work can be considered only as an early review since many computer
vision approaches are being proposed and tested to control COVID-19 pandemic at the current time. We believe that
such efforts will be having a far-reaching impact with positive results to periods during the outbreak and post the
COVID-19 pandemic.
