Abstract
Fitting Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) models to incidence data is problematic
when a fraction q of the infected individuals are not reported. Assuming an underlying
SIR model with general but known distribution for the time to recovery, this paper
derives the implied differential-integral equations for observed incidence data when a
fixed fraction q of newly infected individuals are not observed. The parameters of the
resulting system of differential equations are identifiable. Using these differential
equations, we develop a stochastic model for the conditional distribution of current
disease incidence given the entire past history of incidences. This results in an epidemic
model that can track complex epidemic dynamics, such as outbreaks with multiple
waves. We propose to estimate of model parameters using Bayesian Monte-Carlo
Markov Chain sampling of the posterior distribution. We apply our model to estimate
the infection rate and fraction of asymptomatic individuals for the current Coronavirus
2019 outbreak in eight countries in North and South America. Our analysis reveals that
consistently, about 70-90% of infected individuals were not observed in the American
outbreaks.

Author summary
Quantifying the lethality and infectiousness of emerging diseases such as the coronavirus
disease (COVID-19) pandemic is challenging because of under-reporting of incidence
cases. Under-reporting can be attributed to the presence of sub-clinical infections,
asymptomatic individuals and lack of systematic testing. We develop an extension of
standard epidemiological models to describe the temporal observed dynamics of
infectious diseases and to estimate the under-reporting from incidence data. The
extended model shows that fitting SIR model types directly to incidence data will
under-estimate the true infectiousness of the disease. Therefore, failing to account for
the under-reporting will under-estimate the severity of the outbreak, possibly leading
decision makers to call the epidemic under control prematurely. Additionally, from the
extended model formulation, we present a novel stochastic framework to approximate
daily infectious incidence cases given the past observed cases and to propose a likelihood
function for the model parameters: the infection rate and fraction of under-reporting
cases. By using the COVID-19 time series of newly reported incidence cases form the
World Health Organization for various American countries, we show the functionality of

Introduction

Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) models, introduced by Kermack and McKendrick
and further developed by Wilson and Worcester [1, 2], have been extensively used to
describe the temporal dynamic of infectious disease outbreaks [3–5]. They have also
been widely used to estimate the disease infection rate by fitting the models to observed
incidence data [6–8], such as time series of daily or weekly reported number of new cases
provided by [9–12], for example. Implicit in all these model fitting is the assumption
that all the infected individuals are observed. Yet that assumption is problematic when
disease incidences are under-reported. Under-reporting of incidence is prevalent in
health surveillance of emerging diseases [13, 14], and also occurs when a disease presents
a large fraction of asymptomatic carriers, e.g., Typhoid fever, hepatitis B, Epstein-Barr
virus [15] and Zika [16]. Lack of systematic testing and the presence of sub-clinical
patients, which are prevalent in both Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2), the cause of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic [17–20], and
Influenza [21, 22], also leads to under-counting incidence and death. Fitting directly a
SIR to raw under-reported incidence counts will underestimate the infection rate (see
Section 2.2.2), and therefore failing to account for the under-reporting will
under-estimate the severity of the outbreak, possibly leading decision makers to call the
epidemic under control prematurely.
To account for under-reporting in a SIR model type, Shutt et. al [23] propose to
split the infected individuals into two: an observed category and an unobserved
category. This is a special case of the Distributed Infection (DI) models introduced
in [24]. However, fitting this model to data is problematic since there are no data from
the unobserved category. Furthermore, making inference about DI model parameters is
difficult as there are no adequate stochastic model extensions for the DI models, which
implies that there is no analytic expression for the likelihood. A partial solution of this
problem is to use Approximate Bayesian Computations as in [23] or relies on particle
filtering [25]. Finally, we mention two recent approaches to model asymptomatic
individuals in SIR-type models: First Lopman et. al. in [26] model Norovirus outbreaks
using an SEIR model where the infected would progress from symptomatic to
asymptomatic to immune. Once immune, individuals can cycle between immune and
asymptomatic infection. Second Kalajdzievska et. al. in [15] propose an SIcIR model
where infected individuals are separated into asymptomatic and symptomatic groups by
a given probability as they progress from the susceptible group.
The aim of this paper is to present a novel approach to estimate the under-reporting
from daily incidence data and apply this methodology to estimate the under-reporting
of COVID-19 data. COVID-19 pandemic is a particular example of infectious diseases
that poses many of the challenges to quantify the newly incidence cases, and hence to
estimate its infectiousness [19, 27, 28], as under-reporting arises from the presence of
sub-clinical infections [20, 29], asymptomatic individuals [30, 31], and lack of systematic
testing [17, 18]. Accordingly, asymptomatic individuals account for 20–70% of all the
infections [30]. Additionally, early in China outbreak, before traveling restrictions, 86%
of all infections were not documented [19].
In the development of our methodology, we present two innovations: First, we
introduce an alternative to the DI models that directly describes the dynamic of the
observed under-reported incidences. Specifically, assuming that a constant fraction
p < 1 of the newly infected individuals are observed, we derive a set of
integral-differential equations describing the temporal dynamic of the observed number

of observed incidence. Second, we use the local dynamic of the observed incidence to
propose a model for the conditional expectation of new cases given the past observed
history. Making additional distributional assumptions, we obtain a likelihood for the
model parameters: the infection rate β and the fraction p of observed incidence. We
refer to Bettencourt and Ribeiro [32] for an interesting alternative framework that leads
to a likelihood for the basic reproduction number R0 . We show that as the epidemic
progresses, both of these parameters become identifiable.

Materials and methods
Data source

The time series of daily number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and total population, N ,
for each country were obtained from the World Health Organization (WHO) reports,
from January 03 to November 10, 2020. Both data sets are freely available
online [12, 33].

2.2

Model development

The model is developed in three steps. First, we present a generalized SIR epidemic
model formulation, which is then extended to model the dynamic of the observed
evolving infection. Second, we introduce a stochastic model to quantify the conditional
expectation of newly incidence cases given the past time series of observed incidence
counts. Third, we propose a methodology to approximate the conditional expectation of
the newly incidence cases, which can be easily implemented in programming languages.
2.2.1

Generalized SIR model

Classical mass-action epidemic models, such as the SIR models are simple yet useful
mathematical descriptions of the temporal dynamics of disease outbreak [3–5]. These
models describe the temporal evolution of the number of susceptible S(t), infected I(t)
and recovered R(t) individuals in a population of fixed size N = S(t) + I(t) + R(t). We
model their dynamic through the set of integral-differential equations [34]:
β
= − S(t)I(t)
N
Z t
(−S 0 (u)) (1 − F (t − u))du + I0 (1 − F (t))
I(t) =
0
Z t
R(t) =
(−S 0 (u)) F (t − u)du + R0 + I0 F (t),

S 0 (t)

(2)
(3)

with initial conditions S0 , I0 , R0 . The parameter β measures the infection rate and the
function F (t) is the cumulative distribution of the time from infection to recovery.
When F (t) = 1 − e−γt is the exponential distribution with mean γ −1 , our model
reduces to the standard SIR model, see Murray [35, Chapter 19] for example. For
completeness of this work, the proof of existence and unique solution of System (1,2,3)
is provided in the appendix, an alternative prove can be found in [34].
The model parameters β and F (t) are epidemiologically relevant and provide
insights into the outbreak. For example, the basic reproductive number as defined by
Lotka [36, 37]:

R∞
where γ −1 = 0 (1 − F (t))dt is the average recovery time, is arguably the most widely
used measure of the severity of an outbreak [38, 39], at least in the absence of
interventions to control it. It measures the expected number of secondary infections
attributed to the index case in a naı̈ve population. Other quantities of interest, such as
the maximum number of infected individuals and the total number of infections can be
expressed in terms of the reproductive number R0 , e.g. Weiss [40].
For many diseases, it is reasonable to assume that the disease progression, from
infection to recovery, is known, either because the disease is well characterized or
because date of onset of symptoms, hospital admission and discharge data are
available [41]. Thus we will assume throughout this paper that we know the distribution
of the recovery period F (t) and we focus on estimating the infection rate β.
2.2.2

Modeling the number of observed disease incidence

e
e and R(t)
e denote the observed number of susceptible, infected and

recovered individuals as a function of time. We make the following modeling
assumptions:
(A1) The true underlying dynamic follows a SIR described by Eqs (1) to (3) with
known fixed population size N and time to recovery distribution F (t).
(A2) A constant fraction p of newly infected individuals are observed. That is
Se0 (t) = pS 0 (t). The same fraction p of initial cases are observed, i.e., Ie0 = pI0 ,
e0 = pR0 , and Se0 = N − Ie0 − R
e0 .
R
(A3) The recovery distribution is the same for the observed and unobserved infected
individuals.
Under these assumptions, the observed number of infected individuals at time t is


e
I(t) =
−Se0 (u) (1 − F (t − u))du + Ie0 (1 − F (t)) = p · I(t),
(5)

e = p · R(t). The number of “observed” susceptible individuals is
and similarly, R(t)
e = (1 − p)N + pS(t).
S(t)

(6)

Eq (6) follows by solving the differential equation Se0 (t) = pS 0 (t) and using the identity
Se0 = N (1 − p) + pS0 , which results from the hypotheses (A2) and N = S0 +I0 + R0 .
These equations capture the intuitive idea that under-reported incidence results in a
larger number of observed susceptible and fewer infected and recovered individuals
through the epidemic evolution.
Consider the ratio, which yields from Assumption (A2) and Eqs (5) and (6):
−Se0 (t)

(7)

For a standard SIR model with p = 1, that ratio v(t) is unity. However, for the observed
process, the ratio v(t) starts at one and then monotonically decreases over time. It
follows that fitting an SIR model to observed incidence data, neglecting the
under-reporting, will produce a nearly unbiased, but possibly noisy estimate for β early
in the outbreak when v(t) ≈ 1. As more data becomes available and v(t) decreases, the
estimated infection rate β will under-estimate the true value. As a consequence, one
might at later times in an outbreak, under-estimate the severity of the outbreak and call
the epidemic under control prematurely.
The relationship between the actual and observed quantities are used to describe the
temporal dynamic of the observed number of incidence.

2.2.3

A stochastic model for the observed incidence

Observed incidence of disease are typically reported at regular time interval. Precisely,
let 0 = t0 < t1 < t2 < · · · < tn denote the boundary of the observation window. For
simplicity, we assume that tk = k∆, and we denote by Yk the number of new cases
observed in the interval (tk−1 , tk ], k = 1, 2, . . . , n. Our model for new incidences Yk will
depend on the actual observed past history of incidences Hk−1 = {Y1 , Y2 , . . . , Yk−1 }. As
a result, our model will take into account stochastic fluctuations in incidences. Indeed,
imagine that the reported incidences Yj is much larger than what is predicted by Model
(8,9,10). That excess of cases will alter the observed dynamic of the outbreak, making it
progress faster. Similarly, smaller number of incidences will slow down the outbreak.
Therefore, taking into account these effects, we first model locally the dynamic of the
process at each time interval given the history and then we model the conditional
expectation of new cases occurring in the interval.
Let Sek (t) and Iek (t) denote the temporal variables of the epidemic process observed
in the interval (tk−1 , tk ]. Then, from Eqs (8) and (9):

Hence, System (11,12,13) models the local epidemic dynamics in the interval (tk−1 , tk ]

From the local dynamics, Eqs (11) to (13), the calculation of Yk depends on the full
history of the susceptible and infected Se0 , Se1 (t), . . ., Sek−1 (t), Ie0 , Ie1 (t), . . ., Iek−1 (t)

We propose to approximate Yk such that the approximation depends only on the time
series, Y1 , . . . , Yk−1 , by further assuming that the incidence cases are uniformly
distributed in their observational window and using Eq (12) to posit the following
definition.
Definition 1 Let Y1 , Y2 , . . . , Yk the sequence of observed incidence. We model their
conditional expectation as

From Definition 1, given µk we model the conditional distributions of Yk given Hk−1
with a negative binomial distribution, i.e.,

With this parametrization, the expected and variance values are

(20)

in which the parameter r controls the amount of over dispersion. As the over dispersion
increases with the mean, and r very large makes the model more similar to a Poisson
distribution. Therefore, the advantage of the negative binomial over the Poisson, is that
it accounts for over dispersion, which we expect since we have averaged away the
stochasticity of the recoveries. Other distributions are possible, such as beta negative
binomial distribution [42] or the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson distribution [43].
Using the negative binomial distribution assumption, we are now able to write down
an approximate likelihood for the infection rate and the fraction of new observed cases.
Given a time series Hk−1 , the likelihood for β and p with r fixed is

Approximation of the conditional expectation

To reduce the computational burden of having to solve numerically Eq (17), we propose
to estimate the conditional expectation µk by linearizing both Sek (u) and Iek (u) around
tk−1 in the integrand of this equation and solve it. The below lemma summarizes the
resulting approximation, whose proof is provided in the appendix.
Lemma 1 Let us assume that each observed incidence Y1 , Y2 , . . . , Yk−1 is uniformly
distributed in its observed interval, i.e.,
− Sj0 (u) = Yj /∆,

for all

u ∈ (tj−1 , tj ]

(24)

and j = 1, . . . , k − 1. Then the conditional expectation µk can be approximated with

fraction p are identifiable.

If the vector (U1 , U2 , . . . , Um ) and (V1 , V2 , . . . , Vm ) are linearly independent, then β and

The proof of Theorem 2 is found in the appendix.
Remark 2 It follows from Theorem 2 that β and p are not identifiable from early
outbreak data. Indeed, early in the outbreak, Sek (u) ≈ N , so that the vectors (U1 , . . . , Uk )
and (V1 , . . . , Vk ) are essentially co-linear.

2.3

Numerical parameter estimation

Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique [44], is
implemented in python programming language to numerically estimate the posterior
distribution of the infection rate β and the fraction p of observed infected individuals for
e = (ξ, η) applying the
each country. First, the parameter Θ = (β, p) is mapped into Θ
transformation ξ = log(β) and η = log(p/(1 − p)). So that, we generate a Markov chain
e m } from the proposal bivariate normal distribution q(·|Θ
e m ) = N(Θ
e m , Σ),
sequence {Θ
e
with vector mean Θm and covariance Σ, the diagonal matrix with entries 0.001 and 0.01.
In the MCMC implementation, we use Eq (23) to calculate the logarithm of the
likelihood function, l(Θ̃m ), where µk is numerically computed by implementing the
equations from Lemma 1 with parameter value Θm . The algorithm was iterated 80000
times with burn-in period of 10000 and initial value Θ0 = (0.5, 0.5), with R0 = 0, ∆ = 1,
and r = 25, for all countries. While the initial infected individuals, I0 , was set to the
first incidence cases reported in the time series of each country.

Results
Analysis of COVID-19 incidence data

We apply our Bayesian analysis method to estimate the infection rate and the fraction
of under-reporting incidence cases of SARS-CoV-2 in various American Countries: the
United States of America (USA), Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Peru, and
Panama. We modeled the time to recovery as the convolution of the lognormal
distribution (mean=5.2, sdlog=0.662) with the Weibull distribution (mean=5, sd=1.9),
which yields a distribution with recovery mean time of 10 days and standard deviation
of 4 days [45, 46]. We refer the interested reader to [47] for a detailed description of
relevant disease progression parameters of SARS-Cov-2 infection.
The time series of daily number of incidence cases for each country, {Yk }, were
obtained from WHO reports and set from the first confirmed positive case to November
10, 2020. To reduce the impact of reporting weekly reporting patterns, e.g., fewer cases
are reported over the weekend, we apply a moving average of seven days to the raw
incidence counts before execute the algorithm as described in Subsection 2.3. The
assumption of constant infection rate does not hold, as each country implemented
various mitigation and control strategies, from national lockdown orders to closing of
public meeting places. Therefore, we decided to estimate the infection rate after
mitigation were imposed [48]. In the algorithm, this corresponds to initialize k from
Eq (23) at this intervention day accordingly to Table 1. However, the entire time series
of incidence data were used to estimate the number of susceptible and infected
individuals over time since the estimates for Sek−1 and Iek−1 do not depend directly on β
nor p, see Eqs (13) and (28), while they encode the force of infection, dependency on β
and p, in Eqs (26) and (27).
Table 1 summarizes the estimated values for the infectious transmission rate, β, and
the fraction of reported cases, p, for each country, while Fig 1 and Fig 2 show their
estimated posterior distributions. In the table, the parameter values correspond to their
median estimated values and the interval values are the 95% confidence level to their

In Table 1, from the estimated confidence intervals for β, the infectious transmission
rate range from 0.112 to 0.140 among all countries. Being Panama and USA the
countries with the smallest infection rate, whose median values are 0.116 and 0.117,
respectively. While Peru accounts for the highest infection rate, whose median rate is
0.135. It is followed by Brazil whose infection median rate is 0.130.
Additionally, in Table 1, from the estimated confidence intervals for p, the fraction of
reported incidence cases range from 0.021 to 0.288 among all countries. Being USA the
country with the biggest fraction of reported incidence cases, accounting for 0.170 in
median value. While Mexico have the smallest fraction of reported cases whose median
value is 0.025. Interestingly, from Table 1, Fig 1, and Fig 2, Brazil, Mexico, Chile, and
Peru are not observing more than 90% of their everyday infected individuals, while USA
and Panama are observing 70–80% of the everyday infections.

Approximation of the COVID-19 data

We now proceed to describe the application of the method to estimate the conditional
expectation of newly incidence counts with confidence bounds. The model is
implemented using the equations provided in Lemma 1, with β and p median values
from Table 1, for each American country. The predicted bounds for the numerical
approximation of the expected daily incidence cases, µk , are also computed using the
negative binomial distribution assumption, Eq (19), with parameter r = 25. The lower
and upper predicted bounds are set to value at the 2.5% and 97.5% of the generated
distribution with parameters r/(r + µk ) and r, for each k = 1, 2, . . . , n, where n is the
total number of observed days, starting from the day that the first no-zero case is
reported till November 10, 2020.
Figs 3–10 show the resulted numerical approximations for the expected daily
incidence counts and their predicted bounds, together with the WHO reported daily
incidence cases for each country. The expected approximation values are plotted with
red lines, the upper and lower predicted bounds are plotted with blue lines, while all the
expected newly incidence values predicted by the model lie in the blue-shadow area,

with predicted probability of 95%. In all the figures, the raw incidence data lie within
the confidence bounds as the epidemics evolves, resulting the model predictions properly
to estimate the progression of reported daily incidence cases for these countries.

Additionally, Fig 3 shows that USA had three main report risings: early April, late
June, and early October, which maintain that rising beyond November. Fig 4 shows
that Peru registered two maximum incidences counts: first week of June and September,
respectively. Its daily reported cases are now decreasing. Fig 5 shows that Chile
registered a maximum incidence count by meddle of June. Now, it exhibits a decreasing
trend in its reported incidence data. Figs 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 show that Brazil, Mexico,
Colombia, Argentina, and Panama have similar qualitative behaviours in their evolving
incidence reported cases, where the counts increase early in the outbreak, achieve a
maximum, and slowly decrease or sustain the epidemics. In all the figures, the model
tracks the complex transmission trajectories of the evolving epidemic for each country.

Discussion and Conclusion

Quantifying the lethality and infectiousness of emerging diseases such as the coronavirus
disease (COVID-19) pandemic is challenging because of under-reporting of incidence
cases [19, 27, 28, 49] that can be attributed to the presence of sub-clinical
infections [20, 29], asymptomatic individuals [30, 31], and lack of systematic
testing [17, 18]. In this paper, we present a novel approach to estimate the
under-reporting from daily incidence data reports and apply that methodology to
estimate the under-reporting of COVID-19 data in various American countries.
We first develop an extension of standard SIR epidemiological models to describe the
temporal dynamics of the observed infectious diseases. The model extension shows that
under-reported incidence cases lead to observe more susceptible and less infected and
recovered individuals through an evolving epidemic. Additionally, fitting a SIR model
type directly to raw incidence data will under-estimate the true infectious rate when
neglecting under-reporting infectious cases, Subsection 2.2.2. Such results were also
confirmed numerically by applying our methodology in the COVID-19 example, see the
appendix.
Next, we formulate a stochastic model approach to approximate the expected
number of newly infectious cases when we poses a time series of regularly incidence
reports. This stochastic formulation allows to propose a Bayes analysis framework to
estimate the infection rate and fraction of under-reporting. We prove mathematically
that both parameters are identifiable, Subsection 2.2.5. Then, we propose a method to
approximate the conditional expectation of newly infectious cases given the time series
data, which can be easily implemented in programming languages, Subsection 2.2.4. We
show the functionality of this method in Subsection 3.2.
Accordingly, from January 03 to November 10, 2020, assuming that in American
countries, the COVID-19 epidemic evolves properly to a SIR model per day, with
average recovered time of 10 days, and the time series of daily infection reports from
WHO data follows a negative binomial distribution, as described in Section 2 and
Section 3. Then, our analysis shows that the infectious rate in the United States of
America, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Peru, and Panama range from
0.112 to 0.140. Using the estimate of the reproductive number, Eq (4), it implies that
the COVID-19 disease still spreading among these countries. The model analysis also
reveals that consistently 70–90% of infected individuals were not observed in these
American outbreaks. These results provide further evidence that COVID-19 carries a
large fraction of under-reporting infectious cases [19, 30, 49].
The numerical simulations also show that the model can predict accurately the
different qualitative behaviour of the evolving COVID-19 epidemic dynamics in the
various American countries, with 95% confidence bounds. We performed sensitivity
analysis on the parameter r, which results r = 25 a reasonable value for the model
predictions. Therefore, the presented stochastic model can be easily implemented and
used to investigate the infectious transmission parameters and track complex epidemic
trajectories.

Appendix
Proof of existence and uniqueness of solutions of the
generalized SIR model

To prove existence and uniqueness of solution of System (1,2,3), it is further assumed
that the fraction of recovered individuals is defined through a probability distribution
function, F : [0, ∞) → [0, 1], with the following properties.

December 11, 2020

for all t ∈ [0, ∞).
Property 2 The average recovery time is finite, i.e.,

=
(1 − F (t))dt < ∞.

Theorem 3 Let U be an open set of [0, N ] × [0, N ] × [0, N ] ×[0, ∞) and K a compact
subset of U containing (S0 , I0 , R0 , t0 ), initial condition of System (1,2,3), with f (t)
continuously differentiable with respect to t, t ≥ 0 in U . Then there exist a unique
solution of System (1,2,3) through the point (S0 , I0 , R0 ) at t = 0, denoted
X(S(t), I(t), R(t), t), with X(S0 , I0 , R0 , 0) = (S0 , I0 , R0 ), for all t such that
X(S(t), I(t), R(t), t) ∈ K.
Poof 1 From Property 2, System (1,2,3) is well defined and it is equivalently to
β

f (t − u)S 0 (u)du − S 0 (t) − I0 f (t)

S 0 (t)

which is obtained by taking the derivative with respect to t of Eqs (2) and (3) and using
Property 1. Therefore, to prove existence and uniqueness of solutions of System (1,2,3)
is equivalent to prove existence and uniqueness of solutions of System (31,32,33). It
follows if the function G : U → R3 defined by
G(S, I, R, t) = (S 0 (t), I 0 (t), R0 (t))

(34)

∂G ∂G
is continuously differentiable in U , see for example [50, pp. 32]. Since ∂G
∂S , ∂I , ∂R , and
∂G
∂t exist and are continuous in U , then G is continuously differentiable in U . Therefore
the solution of System (31,32,33) exist for the initial condition S0 , I0 , R0 and is unique
in K.

Set α1 = β/p and α2 = β(1 − p)/p. Since

identifiability of α1 and α2 implies identifiability of β and p. We can estimate α1 and

A.4

Under-estimation of the infectious rate

In Subsection 2.2.2, we prove that fitting a SIR model types directly to raw incidence
data will under-estimate the true underlying infectious rate, β1 , when neglecting
under-reporting infectious cases. Here, we apply our methodology to confirm this
results, by fix p = 1 and estimating β1 for all the studied American Countries, see
Subsection 2.3 for the numerical model implementation. Table 2 summarizes the
contrasting numerical parameter results, where βp estimates coincide with the values
from Table 1, while β1 refers to the model estimated results with fixed p = 1.
