Abstract Chest X-ray is the first imaging technique that plays an important
role in the diagnosis of COVID-19 disease. Due to the high availability of
large-scale annotated image datasets, great success has been achieved using
convolutional neural networks (CNN s) for image recognition and classification. However, due to the limited availability of annotated medical images,
the classification of medical images remains the biggest challenge in medical
diagnosis. Thanks to transfer learning, an effective mechanism that can provide
a promising solution by transferring knowledge from generic object recognition
tasks to domain-specific tasks. In this paper, we validate and adapt a deep CNN,
called Decompose, Transfer, and Compose (DeTraC ), for the classification of
COVID-19 chest X-ray images. DeTraC can deal with any irregularities in the
image dataset by investigating its class boundaries using a class decomposition
mechanism. The experimental results showed the capability of DeTraC in the
detection of COVID-19 cases from a comprehensive image dataset collected
from several hospitals around the world. High accuracy of 95.12% (with a
sensitivity of 97.91%, and a specificity of 91.87%) was achieved by DeTraC
in the detection of COVID-19 X-ray images from normal, and severe acute
respiratory syndrome cases.

1 Introduction
Diagnosis of COVID-19 is typically associated with both the symptoms of
pneumonia and Chest X-ray tests [25]. Chest X-ray is the first imaging technique
that plays an important role in the diagnosis of COVID-19 disease. Fig. 1 shows
a negative example of a normal chest x-ray, a positive one with COVID-19,
and a positive one with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
Several classical machine learning approaches have been previously used for
automatic classification of digitised chest images [7, 13]. For instance, in [17],
three statistical features were calculated from lung texture to discriminate between malignant and benign lung nodules using a Support Vector Machine SVM
classifier. A grey-level co-occurrence matrix method was used with Backpropagation Network [22] to classify images from being normal or cancerous. With the
availability of enough annotated images, deep learning approaches [1,3,29] have
demonstrated their superiority over the classical machine learning approaches.
CNN architecture is one of the most popular deep learning approaches with
superior achievements in the medical imaging domain [14]. The primary success
of CNN is due to its ability to learn features automatically from domain-specific
images, unlike the classical machine learning methods. The popular strategy for
training CNN architecture is to transfer learned knowledge from a pre-trained
network that fulfilled one task into a new task [19]. This method is faster
and easy to apply without the need for a huge annotated dataset for training;
therefore many researchers tend to apply this strategy especially with medical
imaging. Transfer learning can be accomplished with three major scenarios [16]:
a) “shallow tuning”, which adapts only the last classification layer to cope
with the new task, and freezes the parameters of the remaining layers without
training; b) “deep tuning” which aims to retrain all the parameters of the
pre-trained network from end-to-end manner; and (c) “fine-tuning” that aims to
gradually train more layers by tuning the learning parameters until a significant
performance boost is achieved. Transfer knowledge via fine-tuning mechanism
showed outstanding performance in X-ray image classification [3, 9, 26].
Class decomposition [31] has been proposed with the aim of enhancing low
variance classifiers facilitating more flexibility to their decision boundaries. It

aims to the simplification of the local structure of a dataset in a way to cope
with any irregularities in the data distribution. Class decomposition has been
previously used in various automatic learning workbooks as a preprocessing
step to improve the performance of different classification models. In the
medical diagnostic domain, class decomposition has been applied to significantly
enhance the classification performance of models such as Random Forests, Naive
Bayes, C4.5, and SV M [20, 21, 34].
In this paper, we adapt our previously proposed convolutional neural
network architecture based on class decomposition, which we term Decompose,
Transfer, and Compose (DeT raC) model, to improve the performance of pretrained models on the detection of COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray images 1 .
This is by adding a class decomposition layer to the pre-trained models. The
class decomposition layer aims to partition each class within the image dataset
into several sub-classes and then assign new labels to the new set, where each
subset is treated as an independent class, then those subsets are assembled back
to produce the final predictions. For the classification performance evaluation,
we used images of chest x-ray collected from several hospitals and institutions.
The dataset provides complicated computer vision challenging problems due
to the intensity inhomogeneity in the images and irregularities in the data
distribution.
The paper is organised as follow.In Section 2, we review the state-of-the-art
methods for COVID-19 detection. Section 3 discusses the main components
of DeTraC and its adaptation to the detection of COVID-19 cases. Section 4
describes our experiments on several chest X-ray images collected from different
hospitals. In Section 5, we discuss our findings. Finally, Section 6 concludes
the work.

2 Related work
In the last few months, World Health Organization (WHO) has declared that
a new virus called COVID-19 has been spread aggressively in several countries
around the world [18]. Diagnosis of COVID-19 is typically associated with the
symptoms of pneumonia, which can be revealed by genetic and imaging tests.
Fast detection of the COVID-19 can be contributed to control the spread of
the disease.
Image tests can provide a fast detection of COVID-19, and consequently
contribute to control the spread of the disease. Chest X-ray (CXR) and Computed Tomography (CT) are the imaging techniques that play an important
role in the diagnosis of COVID-19 disease. The historical conception of image diagnostic systems has been comprehensively explored through several
approaches ranging from feature engineering to feature learning.
Convolutional neural network (CNN) is one of the most popular and effective
approaches in the diagnosis of COVD-19 from digitised images. Several reviews

have been carried out to highlight recent contributions to COVID-19 detection
[8, 15, 24]. For example, in [33], a CNN was applied based on Inception network
to detect COVID-19 disease within computed tomography (CT ). In [28], a
modified version of ResNet-50 pre-trained network has been provided to classify
CT images into three classes: healthy, COVID-19 and bacterial pneumonia.
Chest X-ray images (CXR) were used in [23] by a CNN constructed based on
various ImageNet pre-trained models to extract the high level features. Those
features were fed into SVM as a machine learning classifier in order to detect
the COVID-19 cases. Moreover, in [32], a CNN architecture called COVID-Net
based on transfer learning was applied to classify the CXR images into four
classes: normal, bacterial infection, non-COVID and COVID-19 viral infection.
In [4], a dataset of X-ray images from patients with pneumonia, confirmed
Covid-19 disease, and normal incidents, was used to evaluate the performance of
state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architectures proposed previously
for medical image classification. The study suggested that transfer learning
can extract significant biomarkers related to the Covid-19 disease.
Having reviewed the related work, it is evident that despite the success of
deep learning in the detection of Covid-19 from CXR and CT images, data
irregularities have not been explored. It is common in medical imaging in
particular that datasets exhibit different types of irregularities (e.g. overlapping
classes) that affect the resulting accuracy of machine learning models. Thus, this
work focuses on dealing with data irregularities, as presented in the following
section.

3 DeTraC method
This section describes in sufficient details the proposed method for detecting
Covid-19 from chest X-ray images. Starting with an overview of the architecture
through to the different components of the method, the section discusses the
workflow and formalises the method.

3.1 DeTraC architecture overview
DeTraC model consists of three phases. In the first phase, we train the backbone pre-trained CNN model of DeTraC to extract deep local features from
each image. Then we apply the class-decomposition layer of DeTraC to simplify the local structure of the data distribution. In the second phase, the
training is accomplished using a sophisticated gradient descent optimisation
method. Finally, we use the class-composition layer of DeTraC to refine the
final classification of the images. As illustrated in Fig. 2, class decomposition
and composition components are added respectively before and after knowledge transformation from an ImageNet pre-trained CNN model. The class
decomposition component aiming at partitioning each class within the image
dataset into k sub-classes, where each subclass is treated independently. Then

from chest X-ray images.

those sub-classes are assembled back using the class-composition component
to produce the final classification of the original image dataset.

3.2 Deep feature extraction
A shallow-tuning mode was used during the adaptation and training of an ImageNet pre-trained CNN model using the collected chest X-ray image dataset.
We used the off-the-shelf CNN features of pre-trained models on ImageNet
(where the training is accomplished only on the final classification layer) to
construct the image feature space. However, due to the high dimensionality
associated with the images, we applied PCA to project the high-dimension
feature space into a lower-dimension, where highly correlated features were
ignored. This step is important for the class decomposition to produce more homogeneous classes, reduce the memory requirements, and improve the efficiency
of the framework.

3.3 Class decomposition
Now assume that our feature space (PCA’s output) is represented by a 2-D
matrix (denoted as dataset A), and L is a class category. A and L can be
rewritten as

where n is the number of images, m is the number of features, and k is the
number of classes. For class decomposition, we used k-means clustering [35]
to further divide each class into homogeneous sub-classes (or clusters), where
each pattern in the original class L is assigned to a class label associated with
the nearest centroid based on the squared euclidean distance (SED):

SED =

k X
n
X

(j)

k ai − cj k,

(2)

j=1 i=1

where centroids are denoted as cj .
Once the clustering is accomplished, each class in L will further divided
into k subclasses, resulting in a new dataset (denoted as dataset B).
Accordingly, the relationship between dataset A and B can be mathematically described as:
A = (A|L) 7→ B = (B|C)

(3)

where the number of instances in A is equal to B while C encodes the
new labels of the subclasses (e.g. C = {l11 , l12 , . . . , l1k , l21 , l22 , . . . , l2k , . . . lck }).
Consequently A and B can be rewritten as:

3.4 Transfer learning
With the high availability of large-scale annotated image datasets, the chance
for the different classes to be well-represented is high. Therefore, the learned inbetween class-boundaries are most likely to be generic enough to new samples.
On the other hand, with the limited availability of annotated medical image
data, especially when some classes are suffering more compared to others in
terms of the size and representation, the generalisation error might increase.
This is because there might be a miscalibration between the minority and
majority classes. Large-scale annotated image datasets (such as ImageNet)
provide effective solutions to such a challenge via transfer learning where tens
of millions parameters (of CNN architectures) are required to be trained.
For transfer learning, we used the ImageNet pre-trained ResNet [10] model,
which showed excellent performance on ImageNet with only 18 layers. Here we
consider freezing the weights of low-level layers and update weighs of high-level
layers.
For fine-tuning the parameters, the learning rate for all the CNN layers
was fixed to 0.0001 except for the last fully connected layer (was 0.01), the min
batch size was 64 with minimum 256 epochs, 0.001 was set for the weight decay
to prevent the overfitting through training the model, and the momentum
value was 0.9. With the limited availability of training data, stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) can heavily be fluctuating the objective/loss function and hence
overfitting can occur. To improve convergence and overcome overfitting, the
mini-batch of stochastic gradient descent (mSGD) was used to minimise the
objective function, E(·), with cross-entropy loss

+ 1 − y j ln 1 − z xj ],

(5)

where xj is the set of input images in the training, y j is the ground truth
labels while z(·) is the predicted output from a softmax function.

3.5 Evaluation and composition
In the class decomposition layer of DeTraC, we divide each class within the
image dataset into several sub-classes, where each subclass is treated as a new
independent class. In the composition phase, those sub-classes are assembled
back to produce the final prediction based on the original image dataset. For
performance evaluation, we adopted Accuracy (ACC), Specificity (SP) and
Sensitivity (SN) metrics.They are defined as:

where T P is the true positive in case of COVID-19 case and T N is the
true negative in case of normal or other disease, while F P and F N are the
incorrect model predictions for COVID-19 and other cases.
More precisely, in this work we are coping with a multi-classification problem.
Consequently, our model has been evaluated using a multi-class confusion matrix
of [27]. Before error correction, the input image can be classified into one of (c)
non-overlapping classes. As a consequence, the confusion matrix would be a
(Nc × Nc ) matrix, and T P , T N , F P and F N for a specific class i are defined
as:

Having discussed and formalised the DeTraC method in this section in
details, the following section validates the method experimentally. The method
establishes the effectiveness of class decomposition in detecting Covid-19 from
chset X-ray images.

4.1 Dataset
In this work we used a combination of two datasets:
– 80 samples of normal CXRs (with 4020 × 4892 pixels) from the Japanese
Society of Radiological Technology (JSRT ) [5, 11].
– Chest X-ray images of [6], which contains 105 and 11 samples of COVID-19
and SARS (with 4248 × 3480 pixels).
We applied different data augmentation techniques to generate more samples
such as: flipping up/down and right/left, translation and rotation using random
five different angles. This process resulted in a total of 1764 samples. Also, a
histogram modification technique was applied to enhance the contrast of each
image.

4.2 Class decomposition based on deep features
We used AlexNet [12] pre-trained network based on shallow learning mode to
extract discriminative features of the three original classes. AlexNet is composed
of 5 convolutional layers to represent learned features, 3 fully connected layers
for the classification task. AlexNet uses 3 × 3 max-pooling layers with ReLU
activation functions and three different kernel filters. We adopted the last fully
connected layer into three classes and initialised the weight parameters for our
specific classification task. For class decomposition process, we used k-means
clustering [35]. In this step, as pointed out in [2], we selected k = 2 and hence
each class in L is further divided into two clusters (or subclasses), resulting
in a new dataset (denoted as dataset B) with six classes (norm 1, norm 2,
COVID19 1,COVID19 2, SARS 1, and SARS 2), see Table 1.

4.3 Parameter settings and accuracy
All the experiments in our work have been carried out in MATLAB 2019a on
a PC with the following configuration: 3.70 GHz Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-6100
Duo, NVIDIA Corporation with the donation of the Quadra P5000GPU, and
8.00 GB RAM.

The dataset was divided into two groups; 70% for training the model and
30% for evaluation of the classification performance. We used ResNet18 as an
ImageNet pre-trained network in the transfer learning component of DeTraC.
ResNet18 [30] consist of 18 layers with input image size of 224 × 224 and
achieved an effective performance with 95.12% of accuracy. The last fullyconnected layer was changed into the new task to classify six classes. The
learning rate for all the CNN layers was fixed to 0.0001 except for the last fully
connected layer (was 0.01) to accelerate the learning. The min batch size was 64
with a minimum 100 epochs, 0.0001 was set for the weight decay to prevent the
overfitting through training the model, and the momentum value was 0.95. The
schedule of drop learning rate was set to 0.95 every 5 epochs. DeTraC-ResNet18
was trained based on deep learning mode. For performance evaluation, we
adopted some metrics from the confusion matrix such as accuracy, sensitivity,
specificity, and precision. The results were reported and summarised in table 2.
We plot the learning curve accuracy and loss between training and test as
shown in Fig 3. Also, the Area Under the receiver curve (AUC) was computed
as shown in Fig 4.
To demonstrate the robustness of DeTraC-ResNet18 in the classification
of COVID-19 images, we compare it with ResNet18 using the same settings.
ResNet18 achieved accuracy of 92.5%, sensitivity of 65.01%, and specificity of
94.3%.

5 Discussion
Training CNN s can be accomplished using two different strategies. They can be
used as an end-to-end network, where an enormous number of annotated images
must be provided (which is impractical in medical imaging). Alternatively,
transfer learning usually provides an effective solution with the limited availability of annotated images by transferring knowledge from pre-trained CNN s
(that have been learned from a bench-marked large-scale image dataset) to the
specific medical imaging task. Transfer learning can be further accomplished
by three main scenarios: shallow-tuning, fine-tuning, or deep-tuning. However,
data irregularities, especially in medical imaging applications, remain a challenging problem that usually results in miscalibration between the different
classes in the dataset. CNN s can provide an effective and robust solution for
the detection of the COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray CXR images and this
can be contributed to control the spread of the disease.
Here, we adopt and validate our previously developed deep convolutional
neural network, we called DeTraC, to deal with such a challenging problem by
exploiting the advantages of class decomposition within the CN N s for image
classification. DeTraC achieved high accuracy of 95.12% with ResNet on CXR
images. DeTraC has demonstrated its robustness in coping with the limited
availability of training images and irregularities in the data distribution. More
importantly, the proposed class decomposition layer provides a generic solution
to improve the efficiency of a convolutional neural network.

6 Conclusion and future work
Diagnosis of COVID-19 is typically associated with the symptoms of pneumonia, which can be revealed by genetic and imaging tests. Imagine test can
provide a fast detection of the COVID-19 and consequently contribute to
control the spread of the disease. Chest X-ray (CXR) and Computed Tomography (CT) are the imaging techniques that play an important role in the
diagnosis of COVID-19 disease. Paramount progress has been made in deep
convolutional neural networks (CN N s) for medical image classification, due to
the availability of large-scale annotated image datasets. CN N s enable learning
highly representative and hierarchical local image features directly from data.
However, the irregularities in annotated data remains the biggest challenge in
coping with COVID-19 cases from Chest X-ray images.
In this paper, we adapted DeTraC deep CNN architecture that relies on a
class decomposition approach for the classification of COVID-19 images in a
comprehensive dataset of chest X-ray images. DeTraC showed effective and
robust solutions for the classification of COVID-19 cases and its ability to cope
with data irregularity and the limited number of training images too.
With the continuous collection of data, we aim in the future to extend the
experimental work validating the method with larger datasets. We also aim to
add an explainability component to enhance the usability of the model. Finally,
to increase the efficiency and allow deployment on handheld devices, model
pruning and quantisation will be utilised.
