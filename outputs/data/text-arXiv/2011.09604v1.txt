Abstract: In this article we detail the prototype development of the Personal Ultraviolet Respiratory Germ Eliminating Machine (PURGEM) to safely, efficiently and economically, continuously disinfect inhaled/exhaled air using Ultraviolet (UV) radiation with
possible 99.99% virus elimination. The PURGEM consists of a series of UV disinfection
chambers through which constant airflow is maintained via fans. A minimum air flow rate
of ∼ 20 − 30 L/min is sufficient to keep CO2 levels . 0.5% in the hood/helmet. We validated that using easily available PTFE wrap, a factor of ∼ 18 enhancement in UV power
can be obtained in our spherical chambers. Detailed analysis is presented for the air travel
time distributions through the cavities, and the expectation value for actual pathogen elimination is computed. We provide the scaling of pathogen elimination with the number of
cavities in series, reflective enhancement, UV source power, sphere radius and airflow rate.
We show that disinfection greater than 4-log is achievable for a series of three or more
spheres. We 3D printed our prototype, consisting of two spheres of 10 cm diameter each
in series for each direction of disinfection. Using UVC LEDs emitting ∼ 40 mW of power
each with an airflow rate of 30 L/min, actual SARS-COV2 virus elimination of ∼ 98%
is expected. While not manually feasible to construct smaller spheres in the lab, smaller
cavities can be commercially manufactured, leading to significantly higher actual pathogen
elimination, as well as reducing fingerprint and cost of cavity manufacture. Patent pending.

Introduction

The Personal Ultraviolet Respiratory Germ Eliminating Machine (PURGEM) was proposed in Ref. [1] as a reusable wearable portable device to safely disinfect inhaled/exhaled
air. A highly reflective spherical cavity was proposed to enhance initial Ultraviolet (UV)
source power irradiating inflowing air. As an example material, Polytetrafluoroethylene
(PTFE) [2] is a widely and cheaply available UV resistant material with > 95% reflectance [3]. Due to the high reflectance and spherical shape, the irradiance is expected
to be uniform throughout the sphere. Further, a series of cavities is proposed to obtain
efficient actual disinfection.
In this article, the prototype development of the PURGEM is detailed. In Sec. 2 the
results from investigations on the UVC LED power, reflectance of several materials and
consequent UV power amplification in spherical cavities are presented. It was found that
multiple layers of thin PTFE wrap provided a factor ∼18 amplification and was used in
the prototype constructed. Sec. 3 presents the analysis for the air travel time distributions
through the cavities and the computation for the expectation value for actual pathogen
elimination. The scaling of pathogen elimination with the number of cavities in series,
reflective enhancement, UV source power, sphere radius and airflow rate is provided. It is
shown that disinfection greater than 4-log is achievable for a series of three or more spheres.
Sec. 4 presents the prototype built together with a simple hood configured to couple with
the PURGEM to make a complete practically functioning device. The prototype was
mostly 3D printed, consisting of two spheres of 10 cm diameter each in series for each
direction of disinfection. Each spherical cavity was layered with 4 layers of PTFE wrap.
Using UVC LEDs emitting (measured) ∼ 40 mW of UVC power each with an airflow rate
of 30 L/min, actual virus elimination of ∼ 98% is expected. While not manually feasible to
construct smaller spheres in the lab, smaller cavities can be commercially manufactured,
leading to significantly higher actual virus elimination, as well as reducing fingerprint and
cost of cavity manufacture.

UV Power, Reflectance and Amplification

UVC LEDs with a peak wavelength of 265 nm, almost perfect Lambertian emission, and
purported to be 70 mW were obtained from Klaran [4]. A data sheet containing the
spectral intensity, thermal derailment etc. was provided by the manufacturer. A UVC
254nm Ultra Violet Light Meter (UVC-254SD) [5] was used to measure UVC power. The
responsivity curve for the meter, obtained from the manufacturer, showed good sensitivity
for the spectral output of the LED. Convoluting the sensor responsivity curve to the spectral
output of the LED corresponds to ∼ 93% accuracy in measuring the LED output.
The sensor face was covered with a small buffer, such that only a 1 cm diameter
centered region of the sensor face was exposed. This was done to correspond to situation
when making measurements for the UVC power inside the spherical cavities through a
circular port. The cosine response of the sensor was then measured experimentally. The
sensor was placed at distances d = 10, 13, and 15 cm away from the LED respectively, and
measured power was recorded as the angle of incidence was changed. Each measurement
was repeated 5 times, and consistent results were found at each distance. The measured

materials. A plate wrapped with the material being tested was placed at 45◦ to both the
sensor and the LED, and power measurements were recorded. Left: Drawing not to scale.
See text for details.
average values for d = 15 cm are shown in Fig. 1 scaled to the value at θ = 0 as blue points.
The blue line shows a fitted curve for the measured points and the yellow curve shows the
perfect cosine response. As can be seen, while at small angles, the sensor follows the
perfect cosine curve, the sensitivity falls sharply for angles θ & 0.3, and there is effectively
no sensitivity if the angle of incidence is & 1. Integrating the fitted curve and comparing
to the cosine curve, it was found that the power measured by the UVC sensor is ∼ 30% of
the all angle uniform incident radiation power.
The UVC meter was then used to measure the power output of the LEDs by making
power measurements as a function of the distance for d varying from 10 - 30 cm. Under
the assumption of a Lambertian emitter (Ptotal = πd2 ), it was consistently found that
for all the LEDs used in constructing the prototype, these measurements corresponded to
LED power ∼ 40 mW, significantly lower than the listed 70 mW, even accounting for the
approximately 10% thermal derailment expected. The LED manufacturer was contacted
but an explanation for the discrepancy has not been found. Therefore, for the purposes of
disinfection calculations for the prototype, a value of 40 mW will be used for source power.
The almost perfect Lambertian nature of the LEDs was verified by making relative angular
measurements around the LED, taking into account the cosine response of the sensor.
Relative reflectance of various materials was tested. A schematic of the set-up used is
shown in the left panel of Fig. 2. Each material was wrapped around a flat plate which was
placed at 45◦ to both the sensor and the LED. Power measurements were then recorded.
Materials included household aluminum foil, an assortment of common PTFE/Teflon tapes
found at hardware stores, as well as special ordered PTFE rolls and films. The highest
relative reflectance was found for PTFE “relic wrap”[6]. Since PTFE is a depth reflector,
reflectivity for multiple wrappings was measured. It was found that > 4 layers did not
increase the reflectance further.
Due to the reflectance of the walls in a sphere, one gets a geometric enhancement factor
for the UV power. This is reduced by any defects in the reflecting surface, such as those

–3–

due to the surface area occupied by the LED and the air vents. Therefore, the effective
reflectance Ref f of the cavity is given by:

Ref f = R

(2.1)
SAs
where R is the reflectance of the walls, SAs = 4πr2 is the surface area of a sphere of
radius r, and Adef is the total area of defects. The enhancement due to effectively infinite
reflections of light inside the cavity gives a multiplicative factor to PU V :
E=

1
.
1 − Ref f

(2.2)

To measure this power enhancement in a spherical cavity, cheaply available 6” acrylic
hemispheres were used, where two hemispheres were then clamped together at the equator
to form a sphere. A 2 cm hole was drilled at (slightly off-center) bottom of each sphere for
the LED port, such that the sphere is slightly tilted to the side when placed on top of the
LED. Each sphere further had a 1 cm hole drilled on the opposite side approximately 1”
off center used as the viewing port for the UVC sensor. A schematic is shown in the right
panel of Fig. 2. Since acrylic completely absorbs UVC in the range of wavelengths we are
investigating, a clear sphere was used as the control for source power. Layers of PTFE relic
wrap was applied to the test spheres using Elmer’s glue, and power measurements were
taken at the sensor port, always comparing with free standing LED at a certain distance
and in the clear sphere to confirm unreflected LED power. Amplification was computed
using the excess power measured in test spheres as compared to clear sphere, taking into
account the cosine response of the sensor. Further, power measurements were recorded at
different angles as the sphere was tilted around on top of the LED so that the incident
radiation would fall on different surface defects at different distances. Measurements were
also taken with the sensor port and LED port switched. Excellent agreement was found
at different angles and orientations, validating diffuse uniform radiation inside the sphere.
The sensor was also placed inside the test spheres at different locations and measurements
recorded. They were roughly consistent with even radiation, but due to the large sensor
size contributing to the surface defects in reflectivity, it was difficult to be quantitive.
While PTFE reflectance is somewhat lower at visible wavelengths, it was visually verified
that it was almost impossible to see any defects inside the test sphere, again validating
our expectation of uniform radiation. The amplification in the visible band was even more
striking in the spheres used for the prototype which were 3D printed from black PLA. Before
lining the interior with PTFE relic wrap, it was very difficult to see anything inside the
sphere, even when a light was shone inside. However, after the PTFE lining was applied, a
very even, bright glow could be observed in the interior from the LED port (with ambient
outside light), and only the edges of the air ports were barely perceptible.
Quantitatively it was found, unlike for the plate, that there was no difference in amplification between 3 and 4 layers. It was realized that while wrapping the plate could be
done almost perfectly smoothly, when lining the interior of the hemispheres, there were
multiple areas where overlapping occurred. Hence, even at 3 wrappings, there was a significant fraction of the surface area which already had 4 or more layers. An amplification of

–4–

∼ 18 was obtained for both 3 and 4 wrappings for the PTFE relic wrap, which corresponds
to 94.4% reflectivity according to Eq. 2.2. Measurements were also made with linings of
other materials, and were found to be consistent with previously reported UVC reflectivity
of such materials [7].

Series Cavity Disinfection

Figure 3: A schematic for the PURGEM showing a series of k spherical cavities in each
disinfection direction. Each sphere has a radius r, leading to total linear dimension of
2rk = 2R. A UV source (LED) in each sphere irradiates the internal cavities uniformly
due to high reflectance interior walls. Air flow at required rate is propelled by example
placement of fan as shown. The air is conducted through the series of cavities via curved
pipes/buffered ports to prevent straight flow through. Drawing not to scale. See text for
details.
A schematic of the PURGEM is shown in Fig. 3, configured for both in and out
disinfection. The UV disinfection takes place in a series of k spherical cavities, each of
radius r with high reflectance (diffuse) interiors. A UV LED is mounted in each sphere,
irradiating the entire sphere. There are several air inlets and outlets connecting the spheres
and ultimately the user, configured to be furthest away from each other in each sphere to
optimize diffuse turbulent air flow through the chamber [8–11]. The input fan assembly
may include a tight-weave cloth filter covering the opening to the chamber, and serves to
act primarily as a particulate filter [12]. More sophisticated particulate filters may be used
if desired. A current sensor could be incorporated into the circuit design which alerts the
user to current flow below a certain level, indicating LED/fan failure or low battery.
The quantity D0 may be computed as follows:
D0 =

E PU V V s
PU V
=
r,
SAs VAF
3VF (1 − Ref f )

–5–

(3.1)

where PU V is the UV source radiation in mW, Vs = 43 πr3 is the volume of a sphere and
VAF is the required air flow rate in cm3 /s. This quantity D0 is what would be naively
computed as the dose received by air flowing through.
As discussed and validated experimentally in the previous section, the spherical shape
of the UV disinfection chamber provides excellent spatial integration. Since there are
minimal radiation hot or cold spots, the UV dose received by in-passing air volume becomes effectively independent of path taken through the sphere. However, travel time
distributions, not average time, must be taken into account to accurately predict actual
disinfection, and in general will reduce the actual pathogen elimination significantly independent of geometry. To compensate for this effect, we use a series of spheres which will
effectively integrate the pathogen paths temporally, allowing for the achievement of much
higher levels of actual disinfection.
The time air spends in the spherical cavities we consider will follow an exponential
distribution distribution due to its turbulent motion, as has been verified both numerically
and experimentally [8–11]. The turbulent nature of air flow was verified visually in a clear
test sphere by filling it with incense smoke and then using a high speed phone camera to
record the smoke movement as air was exhausted from the sphere using a fan at one of the
ports. For turbulent airflow, the probability that a differential volume element of air will
spend a time t as it flows through a sphere is given by:
P(t) =

1 −t/τ
e
,
τ

(3.2)

where τ = Vs /VAF . The expectation value for virus elimination in this volume of air is
computed by weighting it by this distribution. The usual convention of defining pathogen
elimination in base 10 means one needs to convert

(3.3)

where D90 is the dose required for 1-log (90%) pathogen elimination, D is dose received,
and S is surviving fraction of pathogen. However, D must be computed using the time
that the pathogen actually spends being irradiated. Therefore, the expectation value of
the fraction of pathogen particles surviving passage through a sphere is given by

Since the path of an air packet through a sphere is independent of its path through another
sphere, given a series of k identical spheres, each of radius r, irradiated by PU V , pathogen
elimination will be given by
Ek = 1 − Sk0 .

In Fig. 4 we show the elimination possible in configurations with multiple spheres

elimination. Increasing values of D0 /D90 correspond to increase in enhancement factor,
PU V or r, or a decrease in air flow rate VAF . As can be seen, initially increasing D0 /D90
there is significant increase in elimination, however, at a certain point for any number of
spheres, the gain becomes progressively smaller. For the benchmark elimination of 4-log
reduction, we see that one needs to practically have 3 or more spheres in series.

The PURGEM Prototype

The prototype constructed consisted of 2 spheres in each disinfection direction. The size of
each sphere was dictated by the size requirement for installing the UVC LEDs manually.
The UVC LEDs are only 3 mm × 3 mm and are usually provided in tape form for easy
machine application [4]. However, the manufacturer provided the LEDs pre-mounted on
12 mm ×12 mm PCB boards for prototype use. Therefore, 5 cm radius hemispheres with

–7–

1 cm diameter ports for pipes and 2 cm diameter ports for the LEDs were 3D printed
using PLA. Pipes, fan grill/connector and exterior boxes for housing heat sink and wiring
were similarly printed. Internal curved pipes, such as shown in schematic in Fig. 3, were
glued to the hemispheres. External pipes were sized to fit standard CPAP hoses (22 mm
outer diameter and 19 mm inner diameter). The interior of the hemispheres, including
curved pipes, was then lined with four layers of PTFE. The LEDs were mounted on top
of the heat sinks [13] using thermal paste and adhesive, and attached to the base of the
hemispheres using mechanical connectors providing an airtight seal. Heat pipes, which
would have a significantly smaller fingerprint than conventional heat sinks, could be used
if manufacturing commercially, however they are not easy to install manually. The LEDs
were wired in series to a LED driver [14] to maintain constant current of 500 mA through
the circuit for optimal LED performance [4]. Since the LED driver was enclosed in the
case for the heat sinks and wiring, to prevent overheating it was also attached to a heat
sink using thermal adhesive. The hemispheres were sealed together and a fan [15] was
attached to the input port of one of the spheres. The fan was wired in parallel to the
LED circuit, and the entire circuit was powered by a 12 V rechargeable battery [16]. The
weight of the device, excluding battery, is ∼ 1 lb. The whole contraption was then mounted
to a water backpack [17] via provided bungee cords (and extra components of backpack
were removed). The wires were threaded through to front where battery was housed in a
separately attached pocket to the backpack front straps.
A freestanding GEM as constructed could be used for example for local air disinfection,
or attached to intake and exhaust vents for ventilators. However, to construct a fully
functional PURGEM, a simple hood was constructed using a heavy duty plastic bag [18].
Screw ports were 3D printed for attachment of plastic hood to CPAP hoses which were
then connected to the PURGEM. Further, soft muslin cloth was attached via lacing to
the bottom interior and the exterior of plastic hood for comfort. A visor removed from
lab googles [19] was attached to the front for optical clarity. This also served the purpose
of reducing problems with vision due to fogging of the interior. When in use, the whole
bag is sealed around the neck using an elastic velcro strap. Inflation of the bag during use
continuously confirms positive pressure is maintained. While there may be slight diffuse
leakage of air outwards from the bottom, the air escaping in this way would have to go
through multiple layers of cloth, effectively getting filtered.
The finished PURGEM prototype as worn is shown in Fig. 5. The back can be seen
in the left panel and the front of hood is shown in the right panel. Apart from the author, 3
adult and 1 child volunteer tested the complete functioning PURGEM for comfort during
use. The device was worn continuously for ∼ 2 hours at a time while performing normal
activities. Airflow was measured [20] to be 30-35 L/min, and CO2 measurements [21]
were . 0.2% after prolonged use. 1 The airflow was found to be sufficient for comfort,
with minimal fogging. Further, in case of exertion leading to higher airflow requirement
than what is propelled by the fan, due to the placement of the input air pipe, one can
simply orally breath unrestricted fresh air from the pipe. However, it should be noted that
1

See Ref. [22] for validation of 20-30 L/min as being sufficient airflow for healthcare personnel.

Figure 5: The PURGEM prototype as worn is shown: Left: Back view showing device

hood. Screw caps connecting plastic hood to CPAP hoses facilitating airflow can be seen.
Inflated hood shows that positive pressure is maintained.
disinfection for the duration of increased airflow will be reduced as shown in Fig. 4. To
avoid heat build up, plastic bag should not be tucked in too tight around the head, such
that airflow is maintained around head. There is a slight muffling/echoing of sound and
some plastic noise crinkling when breathing. However, due to the flexible nature of the
plastic, there is no real problem with communication. Clearly the PURGEM prototype
is somewhat bulky, however, due to its light weight, it doesn’t hinder functionality in any
significant way. Walking around, the impact on activity of wearing the PURGEM is
imperceptible, and for example if one is sitting down, the backpack can easily be taken off
and placed on the side.
A note is in order for the required power for the fan to propel sufficient airflow and
fan selection. While a myriad of fans in different combinations of size/power consumption/airflow/pressure are available for CPAP machines for bulk ordering, it was not possible to obtain them for testing purposes. Therefore it was determined that easily available
fans used for cooling in electronics would be used for the prototype construction. Again
a huge variety of fans is available, however, air output is not geometrically optimized for
input to a CPAP sized pipe. Multiple configurations for fan connectors to port air from
fan to sphere input were 3D printed, but it was noted that as soon as any of the tested fans
were connected to a different sized/shaped pipe, airflow dramatically decreased. At the
end, it was decided to simply use a direct short connector for the output of the fan to the
sphere input. Certainly a more optimized fan/fan connector should be used which would
reduce power consumption considerably if the PURGEM is manufactured commercially.

–9–

It was further noted that there was effectively very little difference in airflow measured
from fan connector outlet (before being input to spheres) as compared to air outflow from
the spheres, denoting a small pressure drop, as would be expected since the constriction to
airflow is very short (only immediately at the entrance and exits to the spheres). However,
once even a short CPAP hose is attached to the sphere outlet, a significant drop in airflow
occurs.
Summarizing, the constructed prototype consisted of 2 sphere in each disinfection
direction, with a radius of 5 cm each. For the constructed device, an enhancement factor
of ∼ 18 was validated experimentally. 40 mW UV LEDs were used with an airflow of
∼ 30 L/min. D90 for SARS-COV2 should approximately be 1 mJ/cm2 (see discussion and
references in Ref. [1]), hence for current situation, the x-axis in Fig. 4 may be read in units
of mJ/cm2 . This leads to

Significantly smaller spheres for example with r = 2 cm (ping-pong ball size) may be
manufactured commercially. In the lab prototype, there was probably some degradation
in the enhancement factor due to manual application of the PTFE wrap to the interior.
Commercial manufacturing could be expected to minimize such defects. Using the same
air flow rate, but higher power LEDs (which are available) a series of 2 spheres would give
similar disinfection as the prototype

Finally we note that due to their light weight, a series of such small footprint spheres
could be configured to be attached to the sides of helmet/hood or around neck eliminating
the need for a backpack. If the air input/output from the spheres is directly connected
to the helmet/hood, the need for CPAP hoses is eliminated, further reducing footprint
and power consumption of fans. The rechargeable battery powering such a one-piece
PURGEM helmet/hood could be clipped to belt or placed in a pocket.
