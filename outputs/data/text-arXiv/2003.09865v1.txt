Abstract
Here we present a toolbox for natural language processing tasks related to SARS-CoV-2. It
comprises English dictionaries of synonyms for SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, a silver
standard corpus generated with the dictionaries and a gold standard corpus of 10 PubMed
abstracts manually annotated for disease, virus, symptom and protein/gene terms. This toolbox
is freely available on Github (on https://github.com/Aitslab/corona) and can be used for text
analytics in a variety of settings related to the COVID-19 crisis. It will be expanded on and
applied to NLP tasks in the coming weeks and the community is invited to contribute.

Introduction
The analysis of various types of text from scientific articles to tweets can be used to support
research on SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 and public health management of the pandemic. It can
also be used for studying the social impact of the crisis.
One critical step in biomedical natural language processing (BioNLP), as for most types of text
analysis, is the identification of relevant keywords and phrases as well as the detection of
synonymous expressions. This so-called named entity recognition (NER) and disambiguation
can be especially challenging with newly emerging diseases such as COVID-19 because no
official name had been defined during the early phases of the outbreak. Instead, authors used a
wide range of descriptive terms such as “Wuhan seafood market pneumonia”.
NER can be performed using dictionaries of keywords or with the help of models, which are
often trained on annotated corpora in which keywords have been labelled manually by experts
(gold standard) or automatically (silver standard) 1. Dictionary and model-based methods can
also be combined as the approaches are complimentary. Here, we have developed a toolbox for
NLP related to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. It includes English dictionaries of synonymous
terms as well as an annotated gold and silver standard corpus. This work will be expanded over
the next weeks but due to the exceptional circumstances of the current health crisis we have
chosen to release the tools already at this stage so that other researchers can use them and
contribute to their improvement. Updated versions will be published on
https://github.com/Aitslab/corona.

Methods
Generation of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 dictionaries
Synonyms and biomedical identifiers for COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were identified by
reviewing a variety of databases and text sources including: NCBI Taxonomy database,

wikidata, the International Classification of Diseases (v. 10 and v. 11), Disease Ontology
(https://disease-ontology.org), Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), medical literature, twitter
feeds, and newspaper websites.
From this manually curated list, hyphens were stripped and letters changed to lower case. Then
variants for virus names and disease names were generated as follows:
Virus names:
• Adding '2019', '2019novel', '2019new', '2019 novel', '2019 new' as prefixes or 2019 as
suffix (only if '19' was not in the virus name)
• interchanging corona virus and coronavirus
• removing virus names containing the same word twice or containing both 'new' and
'novel'
Disease names:
• interchanging corona virus and coronavirus
• interchanging the virus name with any of its synonyms, the term 'Wuhan' or 'Hubei'
• interchanging the terms disease, disorder, syndrome, pneumonia, infection
• adding the adjectives acute, severe, and respiratory alone or in combination
• removing disease names containing the same word twice or containing both 'new' and
'novel'
Duplicate dictionary entries as well as automatically generated entries with duplicate or
semantically similar words (e.g. containing 2019 in beginning and end, containing novel and
new) were removed.
Production of Corona silver standard corpus
SARS-Cov-2/COVID-19 related studies were identified on PubMed on March 16 2020 with
the search term (((COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 OR (Wuhan AND virus) OR 2019-nCoV OR
(Wuhan AND pneumonia)) AND English[lang])) AND ("2019/12"[Date - Create] :
"2020"[Date - Create]). The 987 detected records were downloaded in text format (even those
containing only a heading and no abstract). The text was stripped of hyphens and ‘/’s replaced
with blank spaces. Tokenization (chopping up text into individual words/terms), and detection
of dictionary terms was performed with spacy (https://spacy.io/) pipeline using the spacylookup module in a capitalization-independent manner. A second tokenization step was
performed by splitting the terms matching the dictionaries on blank spaces. Annotations were
stored in IOB2 format where the first token of an entity is labelled 'B', subsequent tokens
belonging to the entity are labelled 'I', and all other tokens are labelled ‘O’. When matches
were found in both dictionaries, the correct one was selected manually.
Production of Corona gold standard corpora
Using BioQRator (http://www.bioqrator.org/), English abstracts related to COVID-19/SARSCoV-2 and published between Dec 2019 and March 6 2020 were identified on PubMed with
the following search query: (((COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 OR (Wuhan AND virus) OR
2019-nCoV OR (Wuhan AND pneumonia)) AND English[lang])) AND ("2019/12"[Date Create] : "2020"[Date - Create]). From the abstracts loaded into BioQRator without error, 10
were randomly selected and subsequently annotated for the following concepts:
• Virus_SARS-CoV-2: for terms representing SARS-CoV-2
• Virus_other: for terms representing a specific virus other than SARS-CoV-2 (e.g.
MERS, SARS-CoV)
• Virus_family: for terms representing more than one virus (e.g. coronaviruses) or all
viruses; for this concept, unique identifiers from the NCBI taxonomy database were
also indicated

•

Protein: for terms representing specific proteins or genes, but not a protein family (e.g.
IL-2 is annotated under this concept, but not protease, IL-1 family members or
interleukins); for this concept, unique identifiers from the UniProt database were also
indicated
• Disease_COVID-19: for terms representing COVID-19
• Disease_other: for terms representing a disease other than COVID-19 (e.g. Zika virus
infection) or general terms for disease (e.g. infection)
• Symptom: for terms representing disease symptoms (e.g. fever, cough)
“Pneumonia” was annotated as Disease_other or Symptom depending on the context.
Abbreviations were annotated independently, e.g. in the expression novel coronavirus (2019nCoV) both “novel coronavirus” and “2019-nCoV” were annotated as Virus_SARS-CoV-2.
Co-references (e.g. pronouns referring to the entities) were not annotated, but this is planned
for future updates of the corpus.
The corpus was exported from BioQRator as a csv and BioC xml file and converted to BioC
json format (Supplemental_file4, Supplemental_file5, Supplemental_file6) using the script of
the BioC-JSON tool from the NLM/NCBI BioNLP Research Group (https://github.com/ncbinlp/BioC-JSON) with minor changes (Supplemental_file7).

Results
Production of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 dictionaries
In this early stage, we have focused on synonyms for SARS-CoV-2 (virus) and COVID-19
(disease). Synonyms were collected from a variety of biomedical and general public text
sources. The dictionaries were then expanded by artificially generating variants. The final
dictionaries contain 215 virus synonyms (Supplemental_file1) and 12906 disease synonyms
(Supplemental_file2).
Production of Corona silver standard corpus
To generate the Corona silver standard (computationally annotated) corpus, 987 PubMed
records, including abstracts when available, were extracted as text file. After tokenization with
spacy, the corpus was annotated in IOB2 format by comparing tokens against the SARS-CoV2/COVID-19 terms in our dictionaries (Supplemental_file3).
Production of Corona gold standard corpus
To produce the gold standard corpus, 10 randomly selected PubMed abstracts related to SARSCoV-2/COVID-19 were annotated in BioQRator by a biomedical expert who labelled virus,
disease, symptom, and protein/gene terms. BioQRator does not allow for overlapping
annotations which was problematic when annotating the expression “respiratory, enteric and
systemic infections”. In this case, the words respiratory and enteric were annotated as
individual entities of the Disease_other category. In total, the corpus contains 155 annotations
across the 6 concepts (Table1). The corpus is available in BioQRator csv, BioC xml and BioC
json format (Supplemental_file4, Supplemental_file5, Supplemental_file6) and will be
improved and expanded further over the next weeks.
Updated files will be published on https://github.com/Aitslab/corona.

Discussion
The corona NLP toolbox can be used in a variety of text analytics settings, e.g. to extract
information from scientific and news articles or to identify social media posts related to SARS-

CoV-2/COVID-19. Even though the toolbox is designed for use with the English language, the
dictionaries can also be applied for NLP in other languages because many of the terms for the
virus and disease are highly similar across many languages.
Updated versions of the corpora and use cases will be published on
https://github.com/Aitslab/corona and the research community is invited to comment and
contribute. The tools can also be combined with other corona-related BioNLP resources which
have just been published 2, 3.
