Abstract:
Rapid antigen tests detect proteins at the surface of virus particles, identifying the disease
during its infectious phase. In contrast, PCR tests detect RNA genomes: they can diagnose
COVID-19 before the infectious phase but also react to remnants of the virus genome, even
weeks after live virus ceases to be detectable in the respiratory tract. Furthermore, the
logistics for administering the tests are different. In this article, we discuss the relative
advantages of the different testing procedures and summarise evidence that shows that
using antigen tests 2-3 times per week could become a powerful tool to suppress the
COVID-19 pandemic. We also discuss the results of recent large-scale rapid antigen testing
in Austrian schools.

2
Rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests are now widely available and have been provided free of
charge for home-testing in Austria since March 1, 2021. We focus specifically on their
comparison to PCR tests, which are the gold standard for diagnosing COVID-19. In contrast
to PCR testing, the widespread and frequent use of rapid antigen tests holds the potential to
identify COVID-19 cases when they are infectious. This may improve pandemic control by
lowering the transmission rate and the effective reproduction number. This potential can only
be fully realized if these tests are used effectively and if the public fully understands both
their capabilities and their limitations. A particularly important factor is that even when used
in a supervised manner, rapid antigen tests are less sensitive than PCR tests. The results
and discussion presented below focus on the base SARS-CoV-2 strain, dominant in 2020.
The main points are applicable to new variants as well, though some of their parameters
differ (for example, preliminary evidence suggests that for the faster spreading variant
B.1.1.7 [1], the infectious phase may be slightly longer and the viral load higher [2,3].)
In general, a virus can be detected by looking for its genetic material (DNA or RNA) or by
detecting viral antigens which are present at the surface of the virus. As opposed to antibody
tests, which detect antibodies from previous infection, antigen tests are used to detect
people who are currently infected – and infectious. A few dozen to a hundred virus particles
are sufficient for a rapid antigen test to detect SARS-CoV-2 [4]. Antigen tests are now readily
available to the public and can provide results within 15 minutes. Therefore, they are a
useful tool for rapidly identifying and isolating positive, infectious cases in order to reduce
further transmissions. In contrast, a PCR test can detect the virus at even lower
concentrations, as the PCR cycler multiplies the viral genetic material, but the execution of a
PCR test, from sample collection to delivery of the results, is time consuming. The resulting
delay in obtaining the result of a PCR-test may enable further transmissions.

Figure 1. Despite having lower diagnostic sensitivity, rapid antigen tests identify the vast
majority of infectious cases. Frequent testing is essential to identify these cases early and to
efficiently limit the spread of the virus in the population. Figure, first published in [5], is
modified from [6] with permission; viral load is shown on a logarithmic scale.

Within the first two to three days after infection with SARS-CoV-2, neither PCR nor rapid
antigen tests can detect the virus (Figure 1), as its concentration is too low [7]. During the
subsequent steep rise in virus concentration, a PCR test detects infection a little earlier than
a rapid antigen test [8]. This period, however, is short, lasting around a day or even less [9].
It is primarily within this 24-hour period that PCR tests provide additional benefit compared to

3
antigen tests for the purpose of reducing further transmissions. While detecting infections
early is key, the benefit of a PCR-test to detect cases at a lower viral load (earlier in the
infection) is negated by the significantly longer turnaround time of the PCR-test result. In
specialized settings such as hospitals, it is possible for an urgent PCR test to be returned in
a few hours, but in general practice, it takes about a day or even longer.
As the viral load increases and the person becomes infectious, the rapid antigen test will
start detecting the virus. This “infectious period” is shown in orange in Figure 1 and usually
lasts 5 to 8 days. Typically, SARS-CoV-2 concentration in the upper respiratory tract peaks
within a week after infection [10,11], which is when the vast majority of new infections occur
[12,13]. This short period of infectivity explains why a high frequency of testing is essential
for suppressing the spread of COVID-19: testing less frequently than once per week has little
effect on new infections as most cases will be detected too late. In the last phase of disease
progression (day 10 through 25), the load of live virus gradually diminishes and the
concentration of viral RNA declines. Without any live virus, a person is no longer infectious
and the antigen test will be negative. In contrast, PCR tests may produce positive results
even when infectious particles are no longer present, because viral RNA remains in the
respiratory tract at detectable levels. This post-infectious phase is shown in purple in Figure
1; the duration of the post-infectious phase is longer among those with severe infections and
somewhat shorter among asymptomatic individuals [11,14,15].
The sensitivity of a test is defined as its ability to detect infection by a virus, and PCR
remains the gold standard for diagnosing a COVID-19 infection. To suppress an epidemic,
however, the ability to detect and isolate an infectious person before they infect others is
decisive: timing is paramount. Identifying a case in the post-infectious phase is important for
diagnosis, but not from a public health perspective, i.e. for preventing secondary infections.
Importantly, the infectious phase (orange in Figure 1) is considerably shorter than the overall
time during which a PCR test can detect viral RNA in an infected person. Studying clusters
of infections enables estimation of viral loads of individuals transmitting SARS-CoV-2, and
indicates that self-administered rapid antigen tests can detect 84-91% of those cases which
cause secondary infections [12,13]. By identifying cases early, rapid antigen tests can
prevent the vast majority of subsequent infections.
In particular, it has been reported that over 80% of new infections are caused by fewer than
20% of cases [16–18]. Such so-called ‘superspreading’ is caused by ‘superspreaders’ who
have both a large number of contacts and often a higher viral load. These cases are more
easily identified using rapid antigen tests, and identifying them early would yield a large
reduction in further transmissions. As such, there is additional benefit in testing people with
many contacts even more frequently.
The mode of sampling may impact the sensitivity of both PCR and rapid antigen tests, e.g.,
nasopharyngeal sample collection versus gurgle tests or anterior nasal swabs. Evidence
suggests that the effect of sampling on the detection of infectious individuals is minimal. A
German study found that out of 30 individuals with high viral loads (more than 10 million of
viral RNA per swab; CT < 25) all were correctly identified through rapid antigen tests with
professionally administered nasopharyngeal swab, and 29 were identified through rapid
antigen tests with self-performed anterior nasal swab [19]. The authors also concluded that
“supervised self-sampling from the anterior nose is a reliable alternative to professional
nasopharyngeal sampling using a WHO-listed SARS-CoV-2 [rapid antigen test]”. Given the

4
ease-of-use of rapid antigen tests, self-sampling and self-testing at home or at work may be
a helpful approach to better control the pandemic. Larremore et al. [9] indicate that if half of
the population would self-test every 3 days with a rapid antigen test and isolate in the case
of a positive result, we could achieve approximately a 40% reduction of the effective
reproduction number R. For example, an R of 1.3 could be reduced to 0.8, and the epidemic
would dissipate. Similarly, [8] show that when testing twice a week, all tests (nasal and saliva
PCR test as well as Quidel SARS Sofia FIA rapid antigen test) find over 94% of infected
cases.
In order to interpret the outcome of wide scale antigen testing, it is helpful to have a rough
estimate for how many positive cases one expects to find. We consider testing a randomly
selected person from the general population whose infection status is unknown but who is
currently not in quarantine, i.e., a person who does not suspect to be infected at the time of
testing. What is the approximate probability that their rapid antigen test will be positive?
Bearing in mind that we only aim to understand the order of magnitude of antigen-detectable
cases, multiple lines of reasoning suggest that it is very low. First, a detailed epidemiological
model fitted to Austrian data on February 15, 2021 estimates that 0.09% of the population is
infected but not in quarantine [20]. Second, a back-of-the-envelope calculation arrives at a
similar conclusion. Assume that there are around 1,500 new cases reported per day (as
observed for much of February in Austria) and that there is a case detection rate of 50%
[21]. In this scenario, 1,500 people become infectious every day and do not quarantine.
Assuming that they are infectious for a week (in line with Figure 1), this results in around
10,000 undetected infectious individuals in Austria – i.e., cases which can be detected via an
antigen test. Since the population of Austria is 8.9 million, the probability that a person in
Austria tests positive via an antigen test is therefore approximately 0.1% under the given
scenario.1
Upon reopening schools in February 2021 after a prolonged lockdown, Austria started mass
rapid antigen testing of all school children twice a week. Tests were conducted every
Monday and Wednesday using the Lepu Medical antigen test, which uses an anterior nasal
swab. The first week of school antigen testing resulted in 198 positives among 470,000 tests
conducted in Vienna and Lower Austria (in the week February 8 to 12, 2021), yielding a
positivity rate of 0.04% [22]. Among these, more than 75% were subsequently confirmed
positive using a PCR-test (suggesting a rather high specificity of 99.99%). In weeks two
through six, the tests were conducted in all provinces, yielding weekly, Austria-wide positivity
rates of 0.04%, 0.065%, 0.09%, 0.08%, 0.08% and 0.08% [23–27]. Across all provinces, the
largest increase in positive tests between rounds – on average more than two-fold –
occurred between the first and second round of testing (see Supplementary Table 1). This
may be due to increased quality of swab taking; an explanation also offered by Austria’s
Minister of Education Heinz Faßmann after the second week of testing. In addition, it is
possible that COVID-19 incidence is lower in pupils than in the general population, especially
right after a lockdown [28,29]. Furthermore, it is conceivable that school children stay
infectious – and hence antigen-test positive – for a shorter period of time than adults. This

This calculation has been simplified by ignoring errors that are hard to quantify and have
countervailing effects. For example, many people will be infectious for some days before
they learn of their status, and others might never be detected but still quarantine themselves
because they are a close contact of somebody who has been detected or because they
have symptoms.

would lower the estimate of the expected proportion of positive rapid antigen tests for this
group compared to the calculation given above.
The recent average constant trend among pupils contrasts with the general population,
where the effective reproduction number R (based on PCR-incidence) is approximately 1.1
[30]. Roughly, it seems to be possible to maintain around a 10% lower R in the tested cohort.
Rapid antigen tests serve both to detect infectious cases among teachers and pupils, and to
identify nascent clusters: in case of a suspected outbreak, a whole class is PCR-tested. This
leads to a very high detection rate for the tested cohort: 5-14 year olds are now
over-represented among population-wide PCR-incidence.
Additional PCR testing in Austrian schools should help to quantify the ability of
self-administered antigen tests to identify infectious and pre-infectious cases. For example,
the ‘Gurgelstudie’ [gargling trial] [31] is set to resume in March 2021. While self-administered
antigen tests enable the prevention of the majority of future infections [12], there is a small
fraction of infectious adults which are not detected using self-administered tests [4,19,32],
and this may occur more often for children. Using gargling PCR tests in all schools in Austria
would likely detect some additional COVID-19 cases compared to antigen tests, a fraction of
which would potentially be in the important pre-infectious phase. Unfortunately, the current
capacity of PCR testing and sampling-to-result delay limits the applicability of wide-spread
PCR testing for controlling the pandemic.
Michael Mina, a professor of epidemiology from Harvard School of Public Health, has been
advocating the use of rapid antigen tests as a public-health tool since last summer
[5,9,14,33]. On average, a recent antigen test (self-administered or not), is a better indicator
of infectiousness than a test that is several days old, regardless of the type of test [19,32].
Inevitably, some people will swab incorrectly, leading to false negative results, and even
professionally administered antigen tests can miss cases with low viral loads that are on the
cusp of becoming infectious. As such, rapid antigen tests must not encourage reckless
behavior, but rather enable people to lower their risk of infecting others by testing at least
twice per week. Having longer gaps between tests decreases the potential benefit for
reducing transmissions [9]. In conclusion, testing frequently, even with self-administered
tests, can be a powerful tool to suppress the COVID-19 epidemic.

Supplementary Table 1.
Weekly positive rapid antigen tests in Austrian schools, per province. Approximately
10% of the Austrian population is tested in this program. Primary schools (age 6-10) are
open 5 days a week and pupils are tested twice per week. In secondary schools (age 10-15),
half of the pupils go to school Monday and Tuesday and are tested on Monday; the other
half attend Wednesday and Thursday, and are tested on Wednesday. (Exceptionally, schools
use alternate weeks instead). Initially, only Lepu Medical tests were used; lately, some
secondary schools started to use Flowflex (ACON) [34]. The frequency of school-testing has
now been increased to 3-times a week. All staff wear FFP2 masks, secondary school pupils
wear face masks in the classroom, primary schools pupils wear masks when indoors outside
of their class group. There is some variability to this general guideline for more specialized
institutions.
