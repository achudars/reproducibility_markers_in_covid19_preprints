Knowing COVID-19 epidemiological distributions, such as the time from patient admission to
death, is directly relevant to effective primary and secondary care planning, and moreover, the
mathematical modelling of the pandemic generally. We determine epidemiological distributions
for patients hospitalised with COVID-19 using a large dataset (N = 21,000 − 157,000) from the
Brazilian Sistema de Informao de Vigilncia Epidemiolgica da Gripe database. A joint Bayesian
subnational model with partial pooling is used to simultaneously describe the 26 states and one
federal district of Brazil, and shows significant variation in the mean of the symptom-onset-todeath time, with ranges between 11.2-17.8 days across the different states, and a mean of 15.2
days for Brazil. We find strong evidence in favour of specific probability density function choices:
for example, the gamma distribution gives the best fit for onset-to-death and the generalised lognormal for onset-to-hospital-admission. Our results show that epidemiological distributions have
considerable geographical variation, and provide the first estimates of these distributions in a low
and middle-income setting. At the subnational level, variation in COVID-19 outcome timings are
found to be correlated with poverty, deprivation and segregation levels, and weaker correlation is
observed for mean age, wealth and urbanicity.

INTRODUCTION

Surveillance of COVID-19 has progressed from initial reports on 31st-Dec-2019 of pneumonia with unknown etiology in Wuhan, China,1 to the confirmation
of 9, 826 cases of SARS-CoV-2 across 20 countries one
month later,2 to the current pandemic of greater than
12 million confirmed cases and 500, 000 deaths globally
to date.3 Early estimates of epidemiological distributions
provided critical input that enabled modelling to identify
the severity and infectiousness of the disease. The onsetto-death distribution,4,5 characterising the range of times
observed between the onset of first symptoms in a patient
and their death, has for example proved crucial in early
estimates of the Infection Fatality Ratio (IFR),6 and was
similarly integral to recent approaches to modelling the
transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2.7–12
Initial estimates of COVID-19 epidemiological distributions necessarily relied on relatively few data points,
with the events comprising these distributions occurring a period of time that was short compared to the
temporal pathologies of the disease progression, resulting in wide confidence or credible intervals and a sensitivity to time-series censoring effects.6 Global surveillance of the disease over the past 197 days has provided
more data to re-evaluate the time-delay distributions of

the disease. In particular, public availability of a large
number of patient-level hospital records – currently over
390, 000 in total – from the SIVEP-Gripe (Sistema de
Informao de Vigilncia Epidemiolgica da Gripe) database
published by Brazil’s Ministry of Health (MoH),13 provides an opportunity to make robust statistical estimates
of the onset-to-death and other time-delay distributions
such as onset-to-diagnosis, length of ICU stay, onset-tohospital-admission, onset-to-hospital-discharge, onsetto-ICU-admission, and hospital-admission-to-death. In
this work we fit and present an analysis of these epidemiological distributions, with the paper set out as follows.
Section 2 describes the data used from the SIVEP-Gripe
database,13 and the methodological approach applied to
fit distributions using a hierarchical Bayesian model with
partial pooling. Section 3 provides a description of the
results from this study from fitting epidemiological distributions at national and subnational level to a range
of probability density functions (PDFs). The results are
discussed in Section 4, including associations with socioeconomic factors, such as education, segregation, and
poverty, and conclusions are given in Section 5.

Data

The SIVEP-Gripe database provides detailed patientlevel records for all individuals hospitalised with severe
acute respiratory syndrome, including all suspected or

2
confirmed cases of severe COVID-19.13 The records include the date of admission, date of onset of symptoms,
state where the patient lives, state where they are being
treated, and date of outcome (death or discharge), among
other diagnosis related variables. We extracted the data
for confirmed COVID-19 records starting on 25th February and considered records in our analysis ending on 7th
July. The dataset was filtered to obtain rows for onset-todeath, hospital-admission-to-death, length of ICU stay,
onset-to-hospital-admission, onset-to-hospital-discharge,
onset-to-ICU-admission and onset-to-diagnosis. Onsetto-diagnosis data were split into the diagnosis confirmed
by PCR and those confirmed by other methods, such
as rapid antibody and antigen tests, called non-PCR
throughout this manuscript. Entries resulting in distribution times greater than 133 days were considered a
typing error and removed, as the first recorded COVID19 case in Brazil was on 25th February.14
Additional filtering of the data was applied for
onset-to-ICU-admission, onset-to-hospital-admission and
onset-to-death in order to eliminate bias introduced by
potentially erroneous entries identified in the data for
these distributions. We removed the rows where admission to the hospital or ICU or death happened on the
same day as onset of symptoms, assuming that these
were actually incorrectly inputted entries. The decision
to test removing the first day is motivated firstly by the
observation of a number of conspicuous data entry errors in the database, and secondly by anomalous spikes
corresponding to same-day events observed in these distributions. An example of the anomalous spikes in the
onset-to-death distribution is shown in Appendix Figure
4 for selected states.
Sensitivity analyses on data inclusion, regarding the
removal of anomalous spikes in first-day data indicative
of reporting errors (e.g. in onset to hospital admission),
and regarding the sensitivity of the dataset to time-series
censoring effects, are set out in the Results Section 3.3.

Model fitting

Gamma, Weibull, log-normal, generalised lognormal,17 and generalised gamma18 PDFs are fitted to
several epidemiological distributions, with the specific
parameterisations provided in Appendix Section 10.1.
The parameters of each distribution are fitted in a joint
Bayesian hierarchical model with partial pooling, using
data from the 26 states and one federal district of Brazil,
extracted and filtered to identify specific epidemiological
distributions such as onset-to-death, ICU-stay, and so
on.
As an example consider fitting a gamma PDF for the
onset-to-death distribution. The gamma distribution for
the ith state is given by
Gamma(αi , βi ) ,

(1)

where shape and scale parameters are assumed to be
positively constrained, normally distributed random variables
αi ∼ N (αBrazil , σ1 )

(2)

βi ∼ N (βBrazil , σ2 ) .

(3)

and

A summary of the data, including number and a range
of samples per variable from the SIVEP-Gripe dataset
is given in Table I. A breakdown of the number of data
samples per state is provided in Appendix Table IX.

The parameters αBrazil and βBrazil denote the national
level estimates, and

Basic exploratory analysis to explain geographic variation observed in time-delay distributions adopts GeoSES
(ndice Socioeconmico do Contexto Geogrfico para Estudos em Sade),15 which measures Brazilian socioeconomic
characteristics through an index composed of education,
mobility, poverty, wealth, deprivation, and segregation.
We investigate correlations between the GeoSES indicators and the time-delay means that we estimate at the
state level. Additionally, we consider correlations with
the mean age of the population of the state and the
percentage of people living in urban areas, data we obtained from Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatstica
(IBGE ).16

where N + (·) is a truncated normal distribution. In this
case, parameters αBrazil and βBrazil are estimated by fitting a gamma PDF to the fully pooled data, that is
including the observations for all states. Prior probabilities for the national level parameters for each of
the considered PDFs are chosen to be N + (0, 1), except for the generalised gamma distribution where we
used: µBrazil ∼ N + (2, 0.5), σBrazil ∼ N + (0.5, 0.5) and
sBrazil ∼ N + (1.5, 0.5).
Posterior samples of the parameters in the model are
generated using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) with
Stan.19,20 For each fit we use 4 chains and 2, 000 iterations, with half of the iterations dedicated to warm-up.

σ1 ∼ N + (0, 1) , σ2 ∼ N + (0, 1) ,

The preference for one fitted model over another is
characterised in terms of the Bayesian support, with the
model evidence calculated to see how well a given model
fits the data, and comparison between two models using
Bayes Factors. The details of how to estimate the model
evidence and calculate the Bayes Factors for each pair of
models are given in Appendix Section 10.1.

RESULTS

Brazil epidemiological distributions

Five trial PDFs – gamma, Weibull, log-normal, generalised log-normal and generalised gamma – were fitted to
the epidemiological data shown in Figure 1.
All of the models’ fits were tested by using the
Bayes Factors based on the Laplace approximation and
corrected using thermodynamic integration,21–23 as described in Appendix Section 10.1. The thermodynamic
integration contribution was negligible suggesting the
posterior distributions are satisfactorily approximated as
multivariate normal. The conclusions on the preferred
PDF were not sensitive to the choice of prior distributions, that is the preferred model was still the favoured
one even when more informative prior distributions were
applied for all PDFs. The Bayes Factors used for model
selection are shown in Appendix Table V.
The gamma PDF provided the best fit to the onset-todeath, hospital-admission-to-death and ICU-stay data.
For the remaining distributions – onset-to-diagnosis
(non-PCR), onset-to-diagnosis (PCR), onset-to-hospitaldischarge, onset-to-hospital-admission and onset-to-ICUadmission – the generalised log-normal distribution was
the preferred model. The list of preferred PDFs for each
distribution, together with the estimated mean, variance
and PDFs’ parameter values for the national fits are given
in Table II. The 95% credible intervals (CrI) for parameters of each of the preferred PDFs was less than 0.1 wide,
therefore in Table II we show only point estimates.
Additionally, in Figure 1, in each instance the cumulative probability distribution is given for the best model
fit, revealing that out of patients for whom COVID-19
is terminal, almost 70% die within 20 days of symptom
onset. Out of patients who die in the hospital, almost
60% die within the first 10 days since admission.
The estimated mean number of days for each distribution for Brazil is compared in Table III with values found
in the literature for China, US and France. The majority of the data obtained through searching the literature
pertained to the early stages of the epidemic in China,
and no data was found for low- and middle-income countries. The mean onset-to-death time of 15.2 (95% CrI
15.1 − 15.3) days, from a best-fitting gamma PDF, is
shorter than the 17.8 (95% CrI 16.919.2) days estimate
from Verity et al.,6 and 20.2 (95% CrI 15.1 − 29.5) days
estimate (14.5 days without truncation) from Linton et
al.12 In both cases, estimates were based on a small sam-

ple size from the beginning of the epidemic in China. The
mean number of days for hospital-admission-to-death of
10.8 (95% CrI 10.7 − 10.9) for Brazil matches closely the
10 days estimated by Salje et al.24

3.2.

Subnational Brazilian epidemiological
distributions

The onset-to-death distribution, and other time-delay
distributions such as onset-to-diagnosis, length of ICU
stay, onset-to-hospital-admission, onset-to-hospitaldischarge,
onset-to-ICU-admission,
and hospitaladmission-to-death, have been fitted in a joint model
across the 26 states and one federal district of Brazil
using partial pooling. The mean number of days,
plotted in Figure 2, shows substantial subnational
variability – e.g. the mean onset-to-hospital-admission
for Amazonas state was estimated to be 9.9 days (95%
CrI 9.7-10.1), whereas for Mato Grosso do Sul the
estimate was 6.7 (95% CrI 6.4-7.1) days and Rio de
Janeiro - 7.2 days (95% CrI 7.1-7.3). Amazonas state
had the longest average time from onset-to-hospitaland ICU-admission. The state with the shortest average
onset-to-death time was Acre. Santa Catarina state on
the other hand had a longest average onset-to-death
and hospital-admission-to-death time, as well as longest
average ICU-stay. For a visualisation of the uncertainty
in our mean estimates for each state, see the posterior
density plots in Appendix Figures 5 and 6. Additional
national and state-level results for the onset-to-death
gamma PDF, including the posterior plots for mean and
variance, are shown in Figure 7 in the Appendix.
We also observe discrepancies between the five geographical regions of Brazil, for example states belonging
to the southern part of the country (Paran, Rio Grande
do Sul and Santa Catarina) had a longer average ICUstay and hospital-admission-to-death time as compared
to the states in the North region. Full results, including
detailed estimates of mean, variance, and estimates for
each of the distributions’ parameters for Brazil and
Brazilian states can be accessed at https://github.
com/mrc-ide/Brazil_COVID19_distributions/blob/
master/results/results_full_table.csv.

Sensitivity analyses

In order to remove the potential bias towards shorter
outcomes from left- and right-censoring, we tested the
scenario in which the data to fit the models was truncated. For example, based on a 95% quartile of 35 days
for the hospital-admission-to-death distribution, entries
with the starting date (hospital admission) after 2nd
June 2020 and those with an end-date (death) before 1st
April were truncated, and the models were refitted. With
censored parts of the data removed, the mean time from
start to outcome increased for every distribution, e.g. for

Figure 1. Histograms for onset-to-death, hospital-admission-to-death, ICU-stay, onset-to-hospital-admission, onset-to-hospitaldischarge, onset-to-ICU-admission onset-to-diagnosis (PCR) and onset-to-diagnosis (non-PCR) distributions show data for
Brazil extracted from the SIVEP-Gripe database.13 For each distribution, solid lines are for fitted PDFs and the dashed line
shows the cumulative distribution function of the best-fitting PDF. The left hand side y-axis gives the probability value for
the PDFs and the right hand side y-axis shows the value for the cumulative distribution function. All values on the x-axes are
given in days. State-level fits are shown in Figure 2 and Appendix Figures 5 and 6.

hospital-admission-to-death it increased from 10.0 (95%
CrI 9.9-10.0) to 10.8 (95 % CrI 10.7-10.9), and for onsetto-death it changed from 15.2 days (95% CrI 15.1-15.3)
to 16.0 days (95% CrI 15.9-16.1). The effect truncation
on censored data is given in Appendix Figure 8.
To test the impact of keeping or removing entries
identified as potentially resulting from erroneous data
transcription (see the Methods Section 2), we fitted the
PDFs to some of the distributions on a national level
with and without those entries. For onset-to-hospitaladmission, onset-to-ICU and onset-to-death we find that
generalised gamma PDF was preferred when the first day

of the distribution was included, and gamma (for onsetto-death) and generalised log-normal PDFs if the first
day was removed. For hospital-admission-to-death, a
gamma distribution fitted most accurately when the first
day was included, and Weibull when it was excluded.
The effect of removing the first day results in means
shifting to the right by approximately 1 day for both
onset-to-hospital- and ICU-admission, and by 0.5 days
for hospital-admission-to-death (see Appendix Figure 8).
Sensitivity analysis regarding the model selection approach is detailed in Appendix Section 10.1.

DISCUSSION

We fitted multiple probability density functions to a
number of epidemiological datasets, such as onset-todeath or onset-to-diagnosis, from the Brazilian SIVEP
Gripe database,13 using Bayesian hierarchical models.
Our findings provide the first reliable estimates of the
various epidemiological distributions for the COVID-19
epidemic in Brazil and highlight a need to consider a
wider set of specific parametric distributions. Instead of
relying on the ubiquitous gamma or log-normal distributions, we show that often these PDFs do not best capture
the behaviour of the data. For instance, the generalised
log-normal is preferable for several of the epidemiological
distributions in Table II. These results can inform modelling of the epidemic in Brazil,30 and other low- and
middle-income countries,31 but we expect they also have
some relevance more generally.
In terms of modelling the epidemic in Brazil, the variation observed at subnational level – see Figure 2 – can be

shown to be important to accurately estimating disease
progression. Making use of the state-level custom-fitted
onset-to-death distributions reported here, we have estimated the number of active infections on 23rd June 2020
across ten states spanning the five regions of Brazil, using
a Bayesian hierarchical renewal-type model.7,30,32 The
relative change in the number of active infections from
modelling the cases using heterogeneous state-specific
onset-to-death distributions, compared to using a single
common Brazil one is shown in Figure 3 to be quite substantial. The relative changes observed, up to 18% more
active infections, suggest assumptions of onset-to-death
homogeneity are unreliable and closer attention needs to
be paid when fitting models of SARS-CoV-2 transmission
dynamics in large countries.
On the origin of the geographic variation displayed
in Figure 2 for the average distribution times across
states, there are multiple potential factors that could
generate the observed variability and in this work we
present an elementary exploratory analysis. We exam-

7
ine the correlation between socioeconomic factors, such
as education, poverty, income, etc., using a number of
socioeconomic state-level indicators obtained from Barrozo et al.(2020)15 and additional datasets containing the
mean age per state and percentage of people living in
the urban areas (urbanicity).16 The Pearson correlation
coefficients, shown in the Appendix Table VII, suggest
that segregation, poverty and deprivation elements were
most strongly correlated with the analysed onset-time
datasets. E.g. poverty was strongly negatively correlated with hospital-admission-to-death (-0.68), whereas
income and segregation had a high positive correlation
coefficient for the same distribution (+0.60, +0.62 respectively). The strongest correlation was observed for
hospital-admission-to-death and deprivation indicator,
which measures the access to sanitation, electricity and
other material and non-material goods.15 Interestingly,
the indicators measuring economical situation were more
correlated with average hospitalisation times than mean
age per state, which suggests that although the low- and
middle-income countries typically have younger populations, their healthcare systems are more likely to struggle in response to the COVID-19 epidemic. More detailed analysis is necessary to fully appreciate the impact
of the economic components on the COVID-19 epidemic
response.
In the work presented we acknowledge numerous limitations. The database from which distributions have
been extracted, though extensive, contains transcription
errors, and the degree to which these bias our estimates is
largely unknown. Secondly, the PDFs fitted are based on
observational hospital data, and therefore should be cautiously interpreted for other settings. Thirdly, though we
have fitted PDFs at subnational as well as national level,
this partition is largely arbitrary and further work is re-

quired to understand the likely substantial effect of age,
sex, ethnic variation,33 co-morbidities, and other factors.

We provide the first estimates of common epidemiological distributions for the COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil,
based on the SIVEP-Gripe hospitalisation data.13 Extensive heterogeneity in the distributions between different states is reported. Quantifying the time-delay for
COVID-19 onset and hospitalisation data provides useful input parameters for many COVID-19 epidemiological models, especially those modelling the healthcare response in low- and middle-income countries.

Change in active infections (%)
Figure 3. This figure shows the percentage change in active infections, estimated on the 23rd-Jun-2020, that results
from using state-specific onset-to-death distributions (see Appendix Table VI) compared to a single national-level one. The
effect for each state is coloured according to the mean of the
state’s onset-to-death gamma distribution, given in days. The
mean onset-to-death for Brazil is 15.2 days.

For each model pair, Bayes factors were computed from

Mj , the Bayes Factor (BF) is

APPENDIX
Model selection

To characterise which model (gamma, log-normal, etc.)
best fits the data, the Bayesian model evidence z =
z(y|Mi ) is evaluated. Here and throughout this section
y denotes the data and Mi denotes the ith model from
the analysed model set. As determining the model evidence requires calculating an integral over the model parameters (θ) which is generally intractable, we approximate it with z0 = z0 (y|Mi ), which is based on a secondorder Laplace approximation,34 q0 = q0 (θ|Mi , y), to the
true un-normalised posterior density q = q(θ|Mi , y). The
second-order approximated density is estimated as:


1
q0 = q(θ̂) exp − (θ − θ̂) Σ−1 (θ − θ̂)T .
2

(5)

Here q(θ̂) denotes the value of the un-normalised posterior evaluated using the mean estimates of the model’s
parameters θ̂, and Σ the covariance matrix built from
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samples of the posterior distribution. From this expression, a second-order
approximation
to the model evidence, z0 , is given by
p
z0 = q(θ̂) det(2πΣ−1 ), where det(·) denotes the deter-

Bij =

z(y|Mi )
,
z(y|Mj )

(6)

where z(y|Mi ) is the evidence of model Mi given y. If
Bij > 1, the evidence is in favour of model Mi . Here, for
readability we will report the Bayes Factors as 2 log(Bij )
following Kass and Raftery notation.35
The sensitivity of our model evidence is tested with
respect to the choice of hyperprior distribution, and secondly with respect to the use of the approximate secondorder density q0 . In the latter instance this is done by
performing thermodynamic integration21–23 between q0
and the true density q in order to obtain an asymptotically exact estimate of the marginal model evidence,

z = z0 exp 0 Eθ∼q(θ; λ) [log q − log q0 ] dλ . (7)
The right hand term corrects the z0 approximation to
the exact Bayesian evidence by a path integral evaluated
with respect to a sampling distribution that interpolates
between the two densities as q(θ; λ) = q (1−λ) q0λ in terms
of the auxiliary coordinate λ.

Table V. Bayes Factors (BFs) for the analysed distributions and models. For each distribution (rows), the values represent BF
for the best fitting model against other models. Value of 0 indicates the model that fits the data the best. Value > 10 indicates
a very strong evidence against given model compared to the best one. GLN - generalised log-normal, GG - generalised gamma.
NA - not analysed. The BF values are reported here as 2 log(Bij ) following Kass and Raftery notation.35

Figure 7. Gamma PDF Gamma(α, β) fitted to the onset-to-death data for Brazil and five states of Brazil. The PDFs were fitted
with HMC partially pooling each state with the whole country. The red lines represent the model using the mean parameter
estimates. Individual PDFs selected during MCMC sampling are shown in yellow. Posterior mean and variance distributions
for each region are given in the middle and right hand side columns.
