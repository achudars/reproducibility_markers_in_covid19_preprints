Abstract
On March 10, 2020, Italy imposed a national lockdown to curtail the spread of COVID-19. Here we
estimate that, fourteen days after the implementation of the strategy, the net reproduction number to
has dropped below the epidemic threshold – estimated range 0.4-0.7. Our findings provide a timeline
of the effectiveness of the implemented lockdown, which is relevant for a large number of countries
that followed Italy in enforcing similar measures.

On February 21, 2020, the first case of locally transmitted COVID-19 was detected in Italy, in a 37year-old man residing in Lombardy [1, 2]. Since then, a number of interventions have been deployed
to contain disease spread, initially on a geographic basis and eventually culminating in a nationwide
lockdown since March 11, 2020 [3, 4]. At the time of writing, the national lockdown is still in force.

Net reproduction number
To evaluate the impact of performed interventions, we derive updated estimates of daily disease
transmissibility, measured in terms of the net reproduction number R. This quantity represents the
mean number of secondary infections generated by one primary infector in the presence of control
interventions and human behavioral adaptations. When R decreases below the epidemic threshold of 1,
the number of new infections begins to decline. The objective of this study was to evaluate R at the
end of March 2020 in Italy.
Case-based surveillance data were collected by regional health authorities and collated by the Istituto
Superiore di Sanità using a secure online platform, according to a progressively harmonized trackrecord. Data include, among other information, the place of residence, the date of symptom onset and
the date of first hospital admission for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases [4].
The distribution of the net reproductive number R(t) was estimated by applying a well-established
statistical method [5-7], which is based the knowledge of the distribution of the generation time and
on the time series of cases. In particular, the posterior distribution of R for any time point t was
estimated by applying the Metropolis-Hastings MCMC sampling to a likelihood function defined as
follows:
!

ℒ = # P %C(t); R(t) - φ(s)C(t − s)1

P(k; λ) is the probability mass function of a Poisson distribution (i.e., the probability of
observing k events if these events occur with rate λ).
C(t), is the daily number of new cases (imported or locally acquired) at time t;
R(t) is the net reproduction number at time t to be estimated;
φ(s) is the distribution of the generation time calculated at time s.

As a proxy for the distribution of the generation time, we used the empirical distribution of the serial
interval, estimated from the analysis of contact tracing data in Lombardy [4], i.e., a gamma function
with shape 1.87 and rate 0.28, having a mean of 6.6 days. This estimate is within the range of other
available estimates for SARS-CoV-2 infections, i.e. between 4 and 7.5 days [8-10].
We computed the value of R(t) from two different data sets: (i) the time series of COVID-19 cases by
date of symptom onset (estimate denoted by Rsymp) and (ii) the time series of hospitalized cases by
date of hospital admission, H(t) (estimate denoted by Rhosp). As cases are admitted to the hospital at
delayed time D from their symptom onset, we computed Rhosp(t) using the shifted time series of
hospitalized cases, H(t+D). The median value of D was estimated at 7 days from surveillance data,
using 32,893 cases for which both the date of symptom onset and the date of hospital admission were
available.
To account for the geographical heterogeneity in contacts, healthcare organization, timelines of
interventions, and compliance to social distancing and use of precautions for transmission reduction,
R was estimated separately for different provinces and regions. We included in the analysis provinces
and regions having a proportion of cases with a recorded symptom onset date of at least 40% with
respect to the overall number of reported cases.

Overall, the selected provinces and regions covered a total population of 37 million inhabitants, 61.3%
of the Italian population and accounted for 61,707 symptomatic cases (90.4% of the total) and 34,708
(87.0% of the total) hospitalizations.

Effect of the lockdown on the net reproduction number
We found that the estimated values for Rsymp at March 25 were consistently below the epidemic
threshold of 1 for all the analyzed regions and autonomous provinces (Figure 1). The 95% confidence
interval (CI) of the posterior estimate for Rhosp exceeded the unit only for Apulia and Sardinia. These
two regions reported the lowest relative cumulative incidence among the included ones (27 per
100,000, compared for instance to 322 per 100,000 for Lombardy – the most affected region).
The mean value of R across the regions and autonomous provinces, weighted by the number of
reported cases at March 25, was 0.7 for Rsymp and 0.46 for Rhosp. Results were consistent when
analyzing estimates from the 57 selected provinces, belonging to 14 unique regions. The mean value
of R was below the epidemic threshold for 84% of provinces when using the time series of symptom
onset dates and for 88% when using hospital admission dates. The upper limit of the confidence
interval was below 1 for 58% of the provinces when using Rsymp and 60% when using Rhosp. Provinces
with mean R above 1 reported a significantly lower number of cases (average: 163 cases and 77
hospitalizations) compared to provinces with mean R below 1 (average: 1,215 cases and 681
hospitalizations; t-test p-values < 0.005). The mean value of R across the provinces, weighted by the
province’s number of reported cases at March 25, was 0.68 for Rsymp and 0.40 for Rhosp. Figure 1 also
shows that the value of R estimated with the two methods was consistently and largely above the
epidemic threshold at March 10 in all considered regions.

Discussion
Our results suggest that the restrictive interventions put in place to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in
Italy have been successful in bringing the reproduction number significantly below 1 within two
weeks from the national lockdown on March 11, 2020. As of March 25, we estimated a mean
reproduction number between 0.6 and 0.8 for the same regions. At March 10, the value of the net
reproduction number 2020 ranged between 1.5 and 3.2 in the same regions (Figure 1 and [4]).
Notably, the reproductive number had been declining steeply, although insufficiently, even before the
national lockdown, especially in the hard-hit regions of Lombardy and Emilia-Romagna, thanks to the
initial geographically targeted measures taken after the discovery of the epidemics [4]. The lockdown
was fundamental to prevent an explosion in the number of cases in regions that had a great epidemic
potential by March 10th, but where transmission had started weeks later compared to the outbreak
epicenter.
One limitation of the method for estimating the reproduction number consists in the requirement that
the case notification rate remains constant over time. However, during the course of the epidemic,
some regions had to face severe limitations in testing capacity and were forced to change the criteria
for testing accordingly. If the result of these changes was a reduction of the notification rate over time,
the reproduction number might be underestimated [11]. On the other hand, a massive and sustained
scale-up of testing capacity was also set up in all regions during the course of the epidemics (Figure 3)
[12], which was not accompanied by a corresponding increase of confirmed incident cases in the
weeks following March 25. This suggests an increase of notification rates and thus a possible
overestimation of R [11]. To compensate possible biases, we supplemented our estimates of the
reproduction number using alternative estimates from the time series of hospitalized cases. Criteria for
hospitalization are more homogeneous across the local health systems and over time than testing
criteria, as they are grounded on the patient’s need for medical assistance. Furthermore, the
hospitalization date is easier and more reliable information to collect with respect to the symptom

onset date, which requires an epidemiological investigation and may be subject to recall bias. Results
obtained with this additional method further support our conclusions.
On the same day that the WHO declared SARS-CoV-2 a pandemic [13], Italy was the first country in
the western hemisphere to impose a nationwide lockdown, although with softer restrictions compared
to the Chinese experience. Many countries worldwide followed Italy in the same decision with a delay
of a few days to a few weeks and similar degrees of enforcement. The effectiveness of lockdown
interventions had been shown in China, where the reproduction number was estimated to fall to about
0.3 in Wuhan [14] and 0.5 in other Chinese provinces [11]. Here we demonstrate that the
comparatively lighter measures implemented by Italy were capable to achieve rapidly control of the
epidemics, although at probably higher values of the reproduction number. Whether residual viral
circulation will result in new epidemic waves after lockdown removal remains undefined. These
results are of high importance for worldwide efforts to contain the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2
pandemic.
