Abstract
Without vaccines and treatments, societies must rely on non-pharmaceutical
intervention strategies to control the spread of emerging diseases such as COVID-19.
Though complete lockdown is epidemiologically effective, because it eliminates
infectious contacts, it comes with significant costs. Several recent studies have suggested
that a plausible compromise strategy for minimizing epidemic risk is periodic closure, in
which populations oscillate between wide-spread social restrictions and relaxation.
However, no underlying theory has been proposed to predict and explain optimal
closure periods as a function of epidemiological and social parameters. In this work we
develop such an analytical theory for SEIR-like model diseases, showing how
characteristic closure periods emerge that minimize the total outbreak, and increase
predictably with the reproductive number and incubation periods of a disease– as long
as both are within predictable limits. Using our approach we demonstrate a sweet-spot
effect in which optimal periodic closure is maximally effective for diseases with similar
incubation and recovery periods. Our results compare well to numerical simulations,
including in COVID-19 models where infectivity and recovery show significant variation.

Author summary
The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed how emergent infectious diseases can be
extremely disruptive to a society, both in terms of socio-economic and health outcomes.
In the early days of an emergent disease pandemic, the primary method for
societal-level control revolves around reducing contacts between people, which in the
most extreme cases takes the form of complete lockdown and stay-at-home orders.
However, for obvious economic and social reasons, indefinitely long lock-down has
proven hard to maintain. Consequently, many recent modeling and simulation efforts
have focused on determining optimal cycles of closure and relaxation. In this work, we
develop an analytical approach for predicting periodic-closure cycles that minimize the
size of disease outbreaks. We show how a characteristic optimal period arises, for
diseases with tunable periodic contact rates, as a function of the reproductive number
and incubation periods of a disease.

Introduction

The COVID19 pandemic, caused by the novel RNA virus SARS-CoV-2 [1], has resulted
in devastating health, economic, and social consequences. In the absence of vaccines and

treatments, non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) strategies have been adopted to
varying degrees around the world. Given the nature of the virus transmission, NPI
measures have effectively reduced human contacts– both slowing the pandemic, and
minimizing the risk of local outbreaks [2, 3]. The use of drastic NPI strategies in China
reportedly reduced the basic reproductive number, R0 , to a value smaller than 1,
strongly curbing the epidemic within a short period of time [3, 4]. On the other hand
widespread testing protocols and contact tracing, in e.g., South Korea, significantly
controlled spread during the initial phase of the pandemic [5]. In other countries, the
implementation of NPI policies has not been as strict [2], with an optimistic reduction
in transmission of roughly a half. To complicate the containment of the disease, early
reports indicated significant amounts of pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic
transmission [6, 7]. For instance, recent estimates point to asymptomatic infection
accounting for around 20−30% of the total, with a similar percentage for
pre-symptomatic infections [8]– together producing a majority. These findings have been
supported by other experimental studies [9] and analysis of the existing data [10, 11].
As NPI controls such as quarantine, social distancing and testing are enforced, it is
important to understand the impact of early release and relaxation of controls on the
affected populations [12, 13]. Recent studies have attempted to address how societies
can vary social contacts optimally in time in order to maintain economic activity while
controlling epidemics [14]. For instance, preliminary numerical studies suggest that
periodic closure to control outbreak risk, where a population oscillates between 30-50
days of strict lockdown followed by 30-50 days of relaxed social restrictions, may
efficiently contain the spread of COVID-19 and minimize economic damage [15]. These
studies test interesting hypotheses, but cannot be immediately generalized to new
emerging diseases. A basic understanding of why and when such risk minimizing
strategies are effective remains unclear, and may benefit from a general analytical
approach.
As a first step in this direction we analyze SEIR-like models with tunable periodic
contact rates. Our methods reveal the existence of a characteristic optimal period of
contact-breaking between individuals that minimizes the risk of observing a large
outbreak, and predicts exactly how such an optimal period depends on epidemic and
social parameters. In particular, we show that the optimal period for closure increases
(or decreases) predictably with R0 and the incubation period of a disease, and exists as
long as R0 is below a predictable threshold, and when there is not a time-scale
separation between incubation and recovery. We demonstrate analytically that periodic
closure is maximally effective for containing disease outbreaks when the typical
incubation and recovery periods for a disease are similar – in such cases suppressing
large outbreaks with R0 ’s as large as 4. Our results compare well to numerical
simulations and are robust to the inclusion of heterogeneous infection and recovery
rates, which are known to be important for modeling COVID-19 dynamics.
To begin, we first consider the canonical SEIR model with a time-dependent
infectious contact rate parameter, β(t). Individuals in this model are in one of four
possible states: susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered. Following the simplest
mass-action formulation of the disease dynamics, and assuming negligible background
births and deaths, the fraction of susceptible (s), exposed (e), infectious (i), and
recovered (r) individuals in a population satisfy the following differential equations in
time (t), where dots denote time derivatives:

ė = β(t)si − αe,

i̇ = αe − γi,

(3)

ṙ = γi.

Such equations are valid in in the limit of large, well-mixed populations and
constitute a baseline description for the spreading of many diseases [16, 17]. Note that α
is the rate at which exposed individuals become infectious, while γ is the rate at which
infected individuals recover. If β(t) = β0 = constant, it is straightforward to show that
the basic reproductive number for the SEIR model, R0 , which measures the average
number of new infections generated by a single infectious individual in a fully susceptible
population, is R0 = β0 /γ [17–19]. Note in this work when R0 is written as a constant
(no time dependence) it should be taken to mean this value. Typical values for the R0
of COVID-19 range from 1−4, depending on local population contact rates [4, 20].

Methods

As a simple model for periodic closure we assume a step function for β(t) with
infectious contacts occurring for a period of T days with rate β0 , followed by no
contacts for the same period, β(t) = β0 · mod(floor{[t + T ]/T }, 2) [21]. A schematic of
β(t) is plotted in the inlet panel of Fig. 1(a). In S1 Appendix we show results for
smoothly varying β(t) and asymmetric closure, where lockdown and open contacts occur
for different amounts of time. It is demonstrated that the results presented in the main
text do not qualitatively change under these generalizations. Also in Fig. 1(a), we plot
an example time-series of the infectious fraction, normalized by the initial fraction of
non-susceptibles, for three different closure periods: green (short), blue (intermediate),
and red (long). For periods that are not too long or short, the disease remains in a
linear spreading regime (as we will show below), and therefore normalizing by the initial
conditions gives time series that are initial-condition independent.

Fig 1. Periodic closure examples. (a) fraction infectious, normalized by initial
conditions, versus time for T = 10·days (green), T = 25·days (blue), T = 40·days (red)
closure periods. The inlet panel shows a schematic of β(t). Other model parameters are:
γ −1 = 10 ·days, α−1 = 8.33 ·days, and β0−1 = 5 ·days. (b) Outbreak size versus the closure
period. Curves correspond to different R0 = β0 /γ, starting from the bottom: first
(R0 = 1.5), second (R0 = 1.7), ..., top (R0 = 3.3). Other model parameters are identical to
(a).
Intuitively, since the incubation period, α−1 , is finite, it takes time to build-up
infection from small initial values. As a consequence, we expect that it may be possible
to allow some disease exposure, before cutting contacts, and the result may be a net
reduction in infection at the end of a closure period. For instance, notice that all i(t)
decrease over a full closure cycle, 2T , in Fig. 1(a). If the closure period is too small,
infection can still grow (e.g., as T → 0, R0 (t) ∼ hR0 (t)it = R0 /2 which could be above the
epidemic threshold), while if the period is too long, a large outbreak will occur before
the control is applied. Between these two limits, there should be an optimal T (Tmin ),
that results in a minimum outbreak. To illustrate, in Fig. 1(b) we show an example of

the final outbreak-size, r(t → ∞) ≡ rf starting from i(t = 0) = 10−3 , as a function of the
closure period for different, equally spaced values of R0 : the bottom curves correspond
to smaller values of R0 , while the top curves correspond to larger values.
As expected from the above intuitive argument, simulations show an optimal period
that minimizes rf . A natural question is, how does Tmin depend on model parameters?
Our approach in the following is to develop theory for Tmin in the SEIR-model, and
then show how such a theory can be easily adapted to predict Tmin in more complete
models, e.g., in COVID-19 models that include heterogeneous infectivity and
asymptomatic spread [11, 20].

Optimal control

It is possible to estimate Tmin by calculating its value in the linearized SEIR model,
applicable when the fraction of non-susceptibles is relatively small. When
e(t), i(t), r(t), 1−s(t)  1, the dynamics of Eqs.(1-4) are effectively driven by a
2-dimensional system:

(5)
(6)

where a ≡ α/γ, R0 (t) ≡ β(t)/γ, and Ψ(t)> = [e(t), i(t)].
The first step in calculating Tmin is to construct eigen-solutions of Eqs.(5-6) in the
form
Ψp (2T ) = ν(T ) · Ψp (0),

(7)

where ν(T ) is the largest such eigenvalue; the superscript p denotes the corresponding
principal eigenvector. Ignoring the subdominant eigenvalues assumes that after a
sufficiently large number of iterations of periodic closure, the dynamics is well aligned
with the principle solution no matter what the initial conditions. Unless stated
otherwise, simulations are started in this state so that initial-condition effects are
minimized. The second step is to calculate the integrated incidence, r(2T ) from the
solution of Eq. (7), by integrating i(t) over a full cycle
Z
r(2T ) =

where [Ψp (t)]2 denotes the infectious-component of Ψp (t). The third step is to calculate
the final outbreak size from r(2T ). To this end, it is important to realize that as long as
ν(T ) < 1, the outbreak will decrease geometrically after successive closure cycles, and
therefore rf (T ) = r(2T )+ν(T )r(2T )+ν(T )2 r(2T ) + ..., or
rf (T ) = r(2T )/[1 − ν(T )].

Finally, we can find the local minimum of rf (T ) when ν(T ) < 1 by solving

Since our analysis is based on a piecewise 2-dimensional linear system, it is possible
to give every quantity in the previous paragraph an exact expression [22] in terms of
epidemiological and social parameters. See S1 Appendix for full derivation and exact
expressions for Eqs.(7-10). Following our procedure gives the prediction curves shown in
Fig. 2(a). The solid red line indicates the solution to Eq. (10), and agrees well with
simulation-determined minima of rf (T ) over a range of R0 given initial fractions of
infectious 10−6 (circles), 10−4 (squares), and 10−2 (diamonds). The
simulation-determined minima are computed from rf (T ) curves like Fig.1(b). It is
important to note that our optimal-control theory assumes the validity of the linearized
SEIR model, applicable when the total outbreak size, rf  1. In general, the total
outbreak size will increase with the initial fraction of infectious and R0 , and hence, the
larger both are, the more simulations will disagree with theory. For example, this
explains the better agreement for initial fractions of infectious 10−6 , as compared to
10−2 in Fig. 2(b).
On the other hand, the solid blue line in Fig.2(a) indicates the threshold closure
period, satisfying
ν(Tthresh ) = 1.

(11)

The closure period Tthresh results in the largest eigenvalue of Eqs.(5-6) equalling unity
such that the principal component of exposed and infectious fractions is unchanged after
a full closure cycle. If T < Tthresh , ν(T ) > 1 and a large outbreak occurs, even with
closure, as infection grows over a full cycle for any small non-zero Ψ(0). Given this
property, Tthresh gives a lower bound for the optimal period, Tmin > Tthresh . Note: the
red curve is always above the blue curve in Fig.2(a).

dashed lines are theoretical predictions (exact and approximate, respectively), and the

10−4 (squares), and 10−2 (diamonds). The blue and dotted curves are predictions for
the threshold closure period (exact and approximate, respectively). Other model
parameters are: γ −1 = 10·days and α−1 = 8.33·days. (b) A refocused version of (a) for
smaller values of R0 . (c) Period versus a = α/γ. The color scheme and parameters are
identical to (a), except β −1 = 5.55·days.
Before analyzing Eqs.(5-10) further, we point out two basic dependencies in the
(normalized) optimal period Tmin · γ. The first is intuitive: as the reproductive number
R0 increases, so does Tmin · γ. Hence, the faster a disease spreads the longer a
population’s closure-cycle must be in order to contain it. The second is more interesting.
Notice in Fig. 2(c) that Tmin · γ → ∞ as a → 0, and Tmin · γ → 0 as a → ∞. Therefore,
recalling a = α/γ, if a disease has a long incubation period, then the optimal closure
cycle is similarly long. On the other hand, if a disease has a short incubation period,
then the optimal closure cycle is short. In order for periodic closure to be a practical
strategy, with a finite Tmin , our results indicate that a ∼ O(1), roughly speaking, or that

the recovery and incubation periods should be on the same time scale– a condition that
generally applies to acute infections [19].
Another observation from our approach that we can make is that periodic closure is
not an effective strategy for arbitrarily large R0 , as one might expect. One way to see
this from the analysis is to notice that the optimal period diverges for the linear system
at some R0max , as Tthresh → Tmin → ∞ (at fixed a). This transition can be seen in
Fig.2(a), as the blue and red curves collide. Above the transition R0 > R0max , no
periodic closure can keep a disease from growing over a cycle. In this sense R0max (a)
gives an upper bound on contact rates between individuals that can be suppressed by
periodic-closure as a control strategy. We note that an optimal Tmin still exists even
when our linear approximation no longer applies, e.g., R0 > R0max (in the sense that
r(t → ∞) is minimized by some Tmin ), but the benefit of control becomes smaller and
smaller as R0 is increased, and the optimal period becomes increasingly dependent on
initial conditions. In such cases, one must resort to numerical simulations of the full
non-linear system, Eqs.(1-4).
A sharper analytical understanding can be found by making the additional
approximation that Ψ(t) ∼ exp[λ11 γt]v11 , for t < T and β(t) = β0 , where
p
−a − 1 + (a + 1)2 + 4a(R0 − 1)
.
(12)
λ11 =
2
Equation (12) is the largest eigenvalue of M(t < T ) with eigenvector v11 . Hence, we
ignore the time-decaying part, Ψ(t)dec ∼ exp[−(a + 1 + λ11 )γt ]v12 , of a general solution
where v12 is the other eigenvector of M(t < T ). Our assumption becomes increasingly
accurate with increasing T , and Eqs.(7-11) simplify significantly:

where

(a − 1)(2λ11 + a + 1)

(15)

and r̄ is a constant that depends on β0 , α, γ and initial conditions, but is independent
of T . Substituting Eqs.(13–15) into Eqs.(10–11) gives a single fixed-point equation for
the approximate Tmin and Tthresh each, which can be easily solved. See S1 Appendix for
further details. Examples of the approximate solutions are plotted with dotted and
dashed lines in Fig. 2, and are almost indistinguishable from the complete linear-theory
predictions shown with solid lines.
Using the simplified expressions, we can now show several interesting features of
periodic closure. First, since Eqs.(13-14) are exact for large T , we can determine R0max
as a function of a. As T → ∞, Eq.(13) has two scaling limits depending on whether a ≥ 1
or a < 1. In the former, the second term on the RHS of Eq.(13) becomes negligible. As
T → ∞ the solution of ν = 1 is λ11 → 1. Solving for R0 in λ11 = 1 gives R0max . Similarly
when a < 1, as T → ∞ the solution of ν = 1 is λ11 → a. Putting the two cases together,
gives R0max (a), and the phase-diagram for optimal-periodic closure:

Equation (16) is plotted in Fig.3. In region I, the optimal period is predicted to be
finite, in which case small outbreaks can be contained by optimal closure. In region II,
such outbreaks can not be contained. The blue squares plot numerically-determined
thresholds for the piecewise linear system Eqs.(5-7) in the long closure-time limit. We
compute each point by: picking a fixed value of a (starting with R0 = 2), solving for
Tthresh according to Eqs.(5-7) and Eq.(11), and then repeatedly incrementing R0 in
small steps of 0.001 and solving for Tthresh (R0 , a) until it is a large number, i.e.,
Tthresh (R0 , a)·γ = 500. Note that as long as the system Eqs.(1-4) is below threshold, we
can always start with initial fractions of infectious and exposed that are small enough
for the linear system to apply.

Fig 3. The largest reproductive number R0 for which periodic closure can keep an
SEIR-model disease under threshold. The two regimes are a = α/γ ≥ 1 (solid line) and
a < 1 (dashed line). Blue squares represent the numerically-determined threshold for the
piecewise linear system Eqs.(5-7) in the long closure-time limit. In region I, outbreaks
are contained by optimal closure. In region II, they are not.
There are several important cases to notice in Fig.3. The first is that R0max has a
peak when a = 1 (α = γ). The implication is that periodic closure has the largest range
of effectiveness, as measured by the ability to keep infection from growing over any
closure-cycle, for diseases with equal exposure and recovery times. In this symmetric
case, periodic closure can prevent large outbreaks as long as R0 < 4 (compare this to the
usual epidemic threshold without closure, R0 = 1). On the other hand, when there is a
time-scale separation between incubation and recovery, a → ∞ or a → 0, the
phase-diagram nicely reproduces the intuitive, time-averaged effective epidemic
threshold hR0 (t)it = 1, or R0max = 2.

3.2

COVID-19 model

Now we turn our attention to more complete models that derive from the basic
SEIR-model assumptions, but have more disease classes and free parameters which are
necessary for accurate predictions. In particular, epidemiological predictions for
COVID-19 seem to require an asymptomatic disease state, i.e., a group of people
capable of spreading the disease without documented symptoms. Such asymptomatic
transmission is thought to be a significant driver for the worldwide distribution of the
disease [23, 24], since symptomatic individuals can be easily identified for quarantining
while asymptomatics cannot (without widespread testing). Many models have been
proposed to incorporate the broad spectrum of COVID-19 symptoms, as well as control
strategies such as testing-plus-quarantining [11, 20]. A common feature of such models is
the assumption that exposed individuals enter into one of several possible infectious
states according to a prescribed probability distribution (e.g., asymptomatic, mild,
severe, tested-and-infectious, etc.) with their own characteristic infection rates and

recovery times. Following this general prescription, we define M infectious classes, im ,
where m ∈ {1, 2, ...M }, each with its own infectious contact rate βm (t) and recovery γm
rate, and which appear from the exposed state with probabilities pm . The relevant
heterogeneous SEIR-model equations become

(17)
(18)

Taking a common closure cycle for all individuals in the population,
βm (t) = β0,m · mod(floor{[t + T ]/T }, 2) [21], we would like to test our method for
predicting Tmin in the more general model Eqs.(17-18), and demonstrate robustness to
heterogeneity. In terms of an algorithm, we could simply repeat our approach for the
effective 1 + M dimensional linear system; though, we loose analytical tractability. On
the other hand, because Tmin is well captured by a linear theory, which depends only on
R0 , a, and γ, we might guess that quantitative accuracy can be maintained for higher
dimensional models such as Eqs.(17-18) by swapping in suitable values for these
parameters in our SEIR-model formulas above. This is analogous to the
epidemic-threshold condition (R0 = 1) being maintained in such models, as long as the
correct value of R0 is assumed.
The R0 for Eqs.(17-18) is easy to derive using standard methods [17, 18],
X
R0 =
pm β0,m /γm .

Note: the updated R0 is simply an average over the reproductive numbers for each
infectious class. Using this averaging pattern as a starting point, our approach is to
substitute the average values of α/γm and γm ,

into Eqs.(7-10), or Eqs.(13-15) for approximate solutions. Namely, for the SEIR model
we have an equation 0 = F (R0 , a, γ, Tmin ), where F is a function that is determined
from Eq(10). Our averaging approximation entails solving the same Eq.(10) for Tmin ,
but with parameters given by Eqs.(19-21).
We point out that this approximation is not arbitrary since in the limit of
heterogeneous infectivity only, γm = γ ∀m, one solution of Eqs.(17-18) is im (t) = pm i(t),
where i(t) is the total fraction of the population infectious. In this case, the linearized
system is still effectively 2-dimensional with parameters γ, α/γ, and R0 , where R0 is
given by Eq.(19). For this reason we expect our averaging approximation to be exact in
the limit of heterogeneous infectivity only, and a good approximation when the
variation in recovery rates is not too large.
Examples are shown in Fig.4, where each panel shows results for an M = 2 model in
which asymptomatics are significantly more (a) and less (b) infectious than
symptomatics [11]. Symptomatic infectives are denoted with the subscript 1 and
asymptomatics with the subscript 2. The optimal closure period is plotted versus the
fraction of asymptomatics, p2 . Within each panel the different colors correspond to no
variation in recovery rates (red), moderate variation (blue), and large variation (green).

to match similar models [11, 20], which were fit to multiple COVID-19 data sources. As
expected, the agreement between theory and simulations ranges from excellent to fair
depending on the heterogeneity in recovery rates

Discussion

Figure 4 demonstrates that the optimal closure period for COVID-19 can depend
significantly on the amount of asymptomatic spread, particularly if there is a large
difference in infection rates compared to symptomatic cases. Since asymptomatic spread
is difficult to measure directly, especially in the early stages of an emerging disease
outbreak, it may be difficult to estimate the optimal control accurately enough for
periodic closure to be an actionable strategy on its own. A possible solution is to deploy
effective and widespread testing within a population, early, and capture the fraction of
asymptomatic infections. In any case, if basic parameters are known for an emerging
disease dynamics, periodic closure is very effective – producing large reductions in the
final outbreak size (e.g., Fig.1(b))– and can be predicted using our methods.
An additional component of population heterogeneity not treated in this work is age
dependence, which is known to be particularly important for modelling the COVID-19
pandemic. When considering expanded models that include age compartments, various
mixing mechanisms across age groups generate different reproductive rates of
infection [25–27]. One extreme compartmented grouping is to decompose a population
into young, middle aged, and seniors with age-dependent contact rates between groups,
age-dependent recovery periods, and some modest age-dependence in incubation periods.
Under weak inter-age mixing assumptions, the result is a system of equations similar to
Eqs.(17-18). As demonstrated in Sec.3.2, the emergence of an optimal periodic control
depends primarily on R0 and the mean incubation period, and persists in spite of
population heterogeneity. Although our controls are based on mean epidemiological
parameters, it is easy to see how such controls may be distributed across age-dependent

groups, and/or spatial clusters. Thus, we expect the inclusion of age-dependent effects
to quantitatively change the results presented, but leave our methodology and
qualitative findings intact.
Finally, we should remark that in addition to the heterogeneity discussed, parameter
fluctuations for COVID-19 spread can occur in space and time. In fact, noise in
reporting, differences in local policies, and adherence to the various forms of
intervention may cause drastic fluctuations in the local spreading parameters. Given
these facts, the well-mixed nature of our model may be insufficient to provide accurate
optimal-control predictions. In such cases, a meta-population or network framework
may be more appropriate. Yet, the approach that we lay out can be naturally
generalized to more accurate and heterogeneous contact-network models, particularly
since SIR and SEIR model dynamics on random networks can be described by relatively
low-dimensional dynamical systems [28–31], which could be analyzed using the methods
described in Sec.2. For small levels of infection, the main contribution from contact
heterogeneity is to increase the effective, network R0 . Once the correct R0 is assumed,
however, we expect the network results to be similar to those presented here, though
this is a subject for future study.

Conclusion

In conclusion, a main socio-economic issue with an emerging virus, in the absence of
vaccines and treatments, is the enormous damage at all levels of a population. Here we
considered a simple approach to model and control an emerging virus outbreak with a
finite incubation period. We show that by tuning periodic control of social contact rates,
there exists an optimal period that naturally minimizes the outbreak size of the disease,
as long as the reproductive number is below a predictable threshold and there is not a
time-scale separation between incubation and recovery. Our basic assumption for the
existence of such an optimal control rests on early detection of the disease, in which
non-susceptible populations are small. Such a basic assumption allows one to
analytically predict the optimal period, and provide parameter regions in which an
optimal control exists. While in general it has been suggested that periodic closure may
help curb the spread of an infectious disease like COVID-19, the implementation of such
measures has been, to the best of our knowledge, mostly based on observations of
recovery periods and absence of new cases for a given period of time. In this paper, we
provide a general formulation that can be utilized to rationally design optimal
intervention release protocols. While we start from an SEIR model and expand to
heterogeneous models that capture the basic dynamics of COVID-19, our theory can be
generally applied to acute infections, with the caveat that recovery and incubation
periods should be roughly on the same time scale.
