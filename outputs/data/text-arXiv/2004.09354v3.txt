Flow physics plays a key role in nearly every facet of the COVID-19 pandemic. This
includes the generation and aerosolization of virus-laden respiratory droplets from a host,
its airborne dispersion and deposition on surfaces, as well as the subsequent inhalation of
these bioaerosols by unsuspecting recipients. Fluid dynamics is also key to preventative
measures such as the use of face masks, hand-washing, ventilation of indoor environments,
and even social distancing. This article summarizes what we know, and more importantly,
what we need to learn about the science underlying these issues so that we are better
prepared to tackle the next outbreak of COVID-19 or a similar disease.

1. Introduction
Transmission of respiratory infections such as COVID-19 is primarily via virus-laden
fluid particles (i.e. droplets and aerosols) that are formed in the respiratory tract of an infected person and expelled from the mouth and nose during breathing, talking, coughing,
and sneezing (Jones & Brosseau 2015; CDC 2020b; Asadi et al. 2020; Bourouiba 2020).
Wells (1934, 1955) showed that the competing effects of inertia, gravity, and evaporation
determine the fate of these droplets. Droplets larger than a critical size settle faster than
they evaporate and contaminate surrounding surfaces. Droplets smaller than this size
evaporate faster than they settle, forming droplet nuclei that can stay airborne for hours
and may be transported over long distances.
Human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 occurs primarily via three routes: large
droplets that are expelled with sufficient momentum so as to directly impact the recipients’ mouth, nose or conjunctiva; physical contact with droplets deposited on a surface
and subsequent transfer to the recipient’s respiratory mucosa; and inhalation by the
recipient of aerosolized droplet nuclei from the expiratory ejecta that are delivered by
ambient air currents. The first two routes associated with large droplets are referred to
as the “droplet” and “contact” routes of transmission, whereas the third is the so-called
“airborne” transmission route (Jones & Brosseau 2015). Respiratory infections hijack our
respiratory apparatus to increase the frequency and intensity of expiratory events such
as coughing and sneezing, which are particularly effective in generating and dispersing
virus-carrying droplets.
Each stage in the transmission process is mediated by complex flow phenomena ranging
from air-mucous interaction, liquid sheet fragmentation, turbulent jets, and droplet
evaporation and deposition, to flow-induced particle dispersion and sedimentation. Thus,
flow-physics is central to the transmission of COVID-19. Furthermore, given the centrality
of flow phenomena to the transmission process, the methods, devices and practices

employed to mitigate respiratory infections are also rooted in the principles of fluid
dynamics. These include simple methods such as handwashing and wearing face masks,
to fogging machines, ventilation (Tang et al. 2006) and even practices such as social
distancing. However, despite the long history of medical research and experience in the
transmission of respiratory infections (a fascinating account of the Spanish Flu can be
found in Soper (1919)), the rapid advance of COVID-19 around the world, has laid bare
the limits of our knowledge regarding the physics underlying the transmission process,
as well as the inadequacy of the methods/devices/practices used to curtail transmission
rates. For instance, one factor that is contributing to the rapid growth of COVID-19
infections is the higher viral load of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the upper respiratory
tract of asymptomatic hosts who shed virus-laden droplets during normal activities
such as talking and breathing (Bai et al. 2020). This knowledge gap has also manifested
through guidelines on practices such as social distancing and the wearing of face masks
(Dwyer & Aubrey 2020; Elegant 2020), which are based on outdated science (Asadi et al.
2020; Bourouiba 2020; Anchordoqui & Chudnovsky 2020).
This article attempts to summarize our current state of knowledge, regarding the
flow-physics implicated in the transmission of COVID-19. The challenge of summarizing
such a vast topic is amplified by the need of the hour, that speed take precedence
over comprehensiveness. Readers are therefore referred to other articles on this topic,
(Asadi et al. 2020; Bourouiba 2020; Jones & Brosseau 2015; Johnson & Morawska 2009;
Tang et al. 2009; Xie et al. 2007; Tang et al. 2006) to fill the many gaps that are sure to
be left by this article.

2. Respiratory Droplets and Aerosols
This section addresses the generation, expulsion, evolution, and transport of droplets
and aerosols generated from the respiratory tract during expiratory activities such as:
breathing, talking, coughing, and sneezing. The primary objective of fluid dynamic analyses in this setting is to (a) determine the mechanisms for the generation of these droplets
within the respiratory tract; (b) characterize the number density, size distribution, and
velocity of ejected droplets; (c) determine the critical droplet size for transition between
the large and small droplet transmission routes; (d) estimate the settling distance of
large droplets; (e) determine evaporation times of small droplets; (f) characterize the
transport of small droplets and droplet nuclei in the air; and (g) quantify the effect of
external factors such as air-currents, temperature and humidity on all of the above.
2.1. Mechanisms of Droplet Formation
It is generally established that respiratory droplets are formed from the fluid lining of the respiratory tract (Morawska et al. 2005, 2009; Johnson & Morawska 2009;
Edwards et al. 2004; Almstrand et al. 2010). Mechanisms of formation are usually associated with distinct locations in the respiratory tract; this is important because both the
characteristics of the respiratory tract (length scales, airway elasticity, mucus and saliva
properties etc.) as well as the viral load carried by the lining are functions of the location
(Johnson et al. 2011; Almstrand et al. 2010).
One key mechanism for the generation of respiratory droplets is the instability
(Moriarty & Grotberg 1999) and eventual fragmentation of the mucus lining due to
the shear stress induced by the airflow. Predicting the fragmentation and droplet
size distribution resulting from this fragmentation is non-trivial because mucus is
a viscoelastic shear-thinning fluid subject to surface tension. This enables multiple
instabilities to bear on this problem (Malashenko et al. 2009) including surface tension

Flow Physics of COVID-19

driven Rayleigh-Plateau instability (Plateau 1873; Rayleigh 1878, 1879; Lin & Reitz
1998; Eggers 1997), shear driven Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (Thomson 1871;
von Helmholtz 1868; Scardovelli & Zaleski 1999; Kataoka et al. 1983), and accelerationdriven Rayleigh-Taylor instability (Lord 1900; Taylor 1950; Joseph et al. 2002;
Halpern & Grotberg 2003). The Rayleigh-Taylor instability is particularly important in
spasmodic events such as coughing and sneezing.
The second mechanism for droplet formation is associated with the rupture of the fluid
lining during the opening of a closed respiratory passage (Malashenko et al. 2009). One
important site for this mechanism is in the terminal bronchioles during breathing. These
sub-millimeter sized passages collapse during exhalation and the subsequent reopening
during inhalation ruptures the mucus meniscus, resulting in the generation of micronsized droplets (Almstrand et al. 2010; Johnson et al. 2011). A similar mechanism likely
occurs in the larynx during activities such as talking and coughing, which involve the
opening and closing of the vocal folds (Mittal et al. 2013). Finally, movement and contact
of the tongue and lips, particularly during violent events such as sneezing, generates
salivary droplets via this mechanism. The fluid dynamics of meniscus breakup associated
with this mechanism are difficult to predict, especially given the non-Newtonian properties of the fluids involved, the dominant role of moving boundaries, and the large range
of length- and time-scales involved in this phenomenon.
2.2. Droplet Characteristics
The number density, velocity, and size distributions of droplets ejected by expiratory
events have important implications for transmission, and numerous studies have
attempted to measure these characteristics (Duguid 1946; Wells 1955; Han et al. 2013;
Morawska et al. 2009; Xie et al. 2009; Bourouiba et al. 2014; Scharfman et al. 2016;
Asadi et al. 2019). A single sneeze can generate O(104 ) or more droplets with velocities
upwards of 20 m/s (Han et al. 2013). Coughing generates 10-100 times fewer droplets
than sneezing with velocities of about 10 m/s, but even talking can generate about 50
particles per second (Asadi et al. 2019). Measured droplet sizes range over four orders
of magnitude: from O(0.1) to O(1000) microns. Recent studies have noted that while
breathing generates droplets at a much lower rate, it likely accounts for more expired
bioaerosols over the course of a day than intermittent events such as coughing and
sneezing (Fiegel et al. 2006; Atkinson & Wein 2008). Consensus on all these droplet
characteristics continues to be elusive due to the multifactorial nature of the phenomena
as well as the difficulty of making such measurements (Han et al. 2013; Chao et al. 2009;
Morawska et al. 2009).
2.3. The Expiratory Jet and Droplet Transmission
Droplets generated within the respiratory tract by the mechanisms described above are
carried outward by the respiratory airflow, and those droplets that are not reabsorbed by
the fluid lining are expelled within a two-phase buoyant jet from the mouth and/or nose.
Breathing and talking generate jet velocities that seldom exceed 5 m/s (Tang et al. 2013)
and mostly expel small droplets. Violent expiratory events like coughing and sneezing
on the other hand generate turbulent jets with Reynolds numbers of O(104 ) and higher
(Bourouiba et al. 2014). Mucus and saliva that are expelled out of the nose and mouth can
be stretched into ligaments and sheets and eventually fragmented into small droplets if the
Weber number is large enough (Jain et al. 2015). This breakup process likely contributes
to the generation of large droplets that fall ballistically and contaminate nearby surfaces
(Bourouiba et al. 2014).

4

R. Mittal, R. Ni and J-H Seo

Wells’ simple but elegant analysis predicted that the critical size that differentiates
large from small droplets is about 100 microns (Wells 1934). Subsequent analysis has
shown that typical temperature and humidity variations expand the critical size range
from about 50 to 150 microns (Xie et al. 2007). For the droplet transmission route,
an important consideration is the horizontal distance traveled by the large droplets.
Thus the 3-6 ft. social distancing guidelines (WHO 2020; CDC 2020a) likely originate
from Wells’ original work. However, studies indicate that while this distance might be
adequate for droplets expelled during breathing and coughing (Xie et al. 2007; Wei & Li
2015), large droplets expelled from sneezes may travel 20 feet of more (Xie et al. 2007;
Bourouiba et al. 2014). Studies also suggest that social distancing in indoor environments
(Wong et al. 2004) could be complicated by ventilation system-induced air-currents.
It has also been shown that the respiratory jet transforms into a turbulent cloud or
puff (Bourouiba et al. 2014). While large droplets are mostly not affected by the cloud
dynamics, small and medium size droplets can be suspended in the turbulent cloud
for a longer time by its circulatory flow, thereby extending the travel distance significantly (Bourouiba et al. 2014). This also has important implications for transmission
via indirect contact with contaminated surfaces and social distancing guidelines, since
SARS-CoV-2 is able to survive on many types of surfaces for hours (van Doremalen et al.
2020). The turbulent cloud also moves upward due to buoyancy (Bourouiba et al. 2014),
thereby enabling small droplets and droplet nuclei to reach heights where they can enter
the ventilation system and accelerate airborne transmissions (see Sec. 2.5). The notion of
a critical droplet size that was introduced by Wells (1934) might need to be reexamined
in the light of our rapidly evolving knowledge about these expiratory events (Xie et al.
2007; Bourouiba et al. 2014).

2.4. Droplet Evaporation and Droplet Nuclei
Droplet evaporation plays a singularly important role in the eventual fate of a droplet
(Wells 1934). The rate of evaporation depends on the difference between the droplet
surface saturation vapor pressure and the vapor pressure of the surrounding air, the latter
being dependent on humidity. The evaporation rate also depends on the mass-diffusion
coefficient, which is a strong function of surface-to-ambient temperature difference, as well
as the relative velocity between the droplet and surrounding gas. Thus, Reynolds, Nusselt,
and Sherwood numbers for the droplets are just some of the non-dimensional parameters
that determine this phenomenon (Xie et al. 2007). This dependence of evaporation rates
on the ambient temperature and humidity has implications for the very important, and
yet unresolved questions regarding seasonal and geographic variations in transmission
(Tang 2009; Ma et al. 2020) rates as well as transmission in various indoor environments
(Tang et al. 2006; Li et al. 2007).
Higher temperatures and lower relative humidities lead to larger evaporation rates that
increase the critical droplet size (Wells 1934; Xie et al. 2007). However, temperature
changes are usually accompanied by changes in humidity, and the overall effect of
environmental conditions on transmission rates has been difficult to ascertain. This is not
only due to the fact that these factors modulate the relative importance of the droplet
and airborne routes of transmission, but also because survivability of enveloped viruses
such as SARS-CoV-2 seem to be linked to these factors in a complex, non-monotonic
manner (Geller et al. 2012). Models that can combine droplet/aerosol fluid dynamics
with virus microbiology and/or population dynamics could help unravel this complex
effect of ambient conditions on transmission rates.

2.5. Airborne Transmission
The airborne transmission route is associated with small droplets that are suspended
and transported in air currents. Most of these droplets evaporate within a few seconds
(Xie et al. 2007) to form droplet nuclei, although the vapour-rich, buoyant turbulent
expiratory jet can slow this evaporation (Bourouiba 2020). The nuclei consist of virions
and solid residue (Vejerano & Marr 2018) but water may never be completely removed
(Mezhericher et al. 2010). These droplet nuclei are submicron to about 10 microns in
size, and may remain suspended in the air for hours. Each droplet nucleus could contain
multiple virions, and given the approximately one hour viability half-life of the SARSCoV-2 virus (van Doremalen et al. 2020) and the fact that SARS-type infections in a
host may potentially be caused by a single virus (Nicas et al. 2005), droplet nuclei play a
singularly important role in the transmission of COVID-19 type infections (Asadi et al.
2020). The evaporation process of virus-laden respiratory droplets and the composition
of droplet nuclei require further analysis because these have implications for the viability
and potency of the virus that is transported by these nuclei.
The transport of droplet nuclei over larger distances is primarily driven by ambient
flows, and indoor environments such as homes, offices, malls, aircraft, and public transport vehicles pose a particular challenge for disease transmission. The importance of
ventilation in controlling airborne transmission of infections is well known (Tang et al.
2006; Li et al. 2007) and much of the recent work in this area has exploited the power of
computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modeling (Thatiparti et al. 2017; Yang et al. 2018;
Yu et al. 2018). However, indoor spaces can have extremely complex flow domains, due
not only to the presence of recirculatory flows driven by ventilation systems but also
anthropogenic thermally-driven flow effects (Craven & Settles 2006; Licina et al. 2014).
COVID-19 transmission from asymptomatic hosts (Bai et al. 2020; Ye et al. 2020) makes
it more critical than ever that we develop methods of analysis that provide better
prediction of these effects.

3. Inhalation and Deposition of Bioaerosols
The process of inhalation of virus-laden particles/droplets and deposition of the virus in
the respiratory mucosa of the host is the final stage of airborne transmission. Fortunately,
particle transport and deposition in the human airway has been studied extensively in
the context of drug delivery (Heyder 2004), food smell (Ni et al. 2015), and pollutant
transport (Morawska et al. 2005). The deposition of a solid particle is governed primarily
by the mechanism of transport, whereas for liquid aerosols, the evaporation/diffusion
process contributes significantly to the deposition mechanism. The latter is, however,
a complex subject and has not been studied extensively so far (Rostami 2009). There
are six mechanisms that determine the deposition location: impaction, sedimentation,
interception, diffusion, electrostatic precipitation, and convection (Hinds 1999). The
relative importance of these mechanisms depends on the particle size and the region of the
airway where deposition occurs. In general, for larger particles, impaction, sedimentation,
and interception are more important than diffusion and convection(Rostami 2009). For
droplet-nuclei-sized particles, sedimentation will drive significant deposition in the upper
respiratory tract of the host (Willeke et al. 1993).
Deposition of virus-bearing droplets on respiratory tract does not always result in
infection, since the mucus layer provides some level of protection against virus invasion and subsequent infection (Zanin et al. 2016). The rate of droplet/nuclei deposition
on the respiratory tract is quantified by the non-dimensionalized deposition velocity

6

R. Mittal, R. Ni and J-H Seo

(Friedlander & Johnstone 1957; Liu & Agarwal 1974), which can vary by over four orders
of magnitude (Guha 2008). For small droplets, deposition relies completely on turbulent
diffusion (Friedlander & Johnstone 1957) but for large droplets, the deposition velocity
increases substantially due to impact on the highly-curved and complex passage walls of
the respiratory tract. Large droplets, despite a higher deposition velocity, likely deposit
in the upper respiratory system, and could be deactivated by the first defensive layer of
the mucosa (Fokkens & Scheeren 2000). On the other hand, droplet nuclei, despite their
smaller deposition velocity, will penetrate deeper into the respiratory system, and this
could affect the progression and intensity of the infection.
Imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) provide realistic anatomical models for experiments (Ni et al. 2015) and
CFD models (Rostami 2009), from which local deposition can be quantified. A recent
study even included the immune system response in the model (Haghnegahdar et al.
2019), and similar models that combine fluid dynamics, biomechanics and virology, could
serve as important tools in combating such pandemics.

4. Measures to Mitigate Transmission
4.1. Mucus Property Modification
Physical properties of the mucus play a key role in droplet formation within the
respiratory tract. Transient modification of the physical properties of the mucus lining
via material delivery to enhance mucus stability therefore provides a means for reducing
infection rates. Fiegel et al. (2006) used isotonic saline to change the mucus lining properties via the induced ionic charge to reduce droplet formation, and Edwards et al. (2004)
explored the use of surface-tension-enhancing inhalants to reduce droplet generation.
These techniques involve complex multiphysics flow phenomena that could benefit from
advanced experimental and computational techniques.
4.2. Fogging Machines
Fogging machines provide an effective means for disinfecting large spaces, such as
hospitals, nursing homes, grocery stores, and airplanes. Fogging machines that rely on
the dispersion of a fine mist of disinfectants in the air have proven their performance in the
healthcare sector (Otter et al. 2013) and the food industry (Oh et al. 2005). Commercial
fogging machines are also designed based on the same flow physics of aerosolization, and
their droplet size is below 10 µm (Krishnan et al. 2012) in order to facilitate extended
airborne duration. For this range of droplet sizes, it is likely that inertia-effects is small,
and the collision between these disinfectant aerosol droplets and virus-bearing droplet
nuclei might be dominated by diffusion. It is unclear if the collision rate will be enhanced
by the turbulence generated by heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems. Given
that fogging machines have been widely employed in particle image velocimetry (PIV),
experiments would be particularly well-poised to study these phenomena.
4.3. Handwashing
Transmission of infection from surfaces with virion-laden respiratory droplets usually
occurs via hands (Nicas & Jones 2009), and handwashing with soap therefore remains
the most effective strategy for mitigating this mode of transmission (Stock & Francis Jr
1940). Soap molecules have a polar ionic hydrophilic side and a non-polar hydrophobic
side that bonds with oils and lipids. Handwashing therefore works by emulsifying the
lipid content of the material adhering to the hand into the bulk fluid and convecting

Flow Physics of COVID-19

it away. For enveloped viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, soap molecules also dismantle the
lipid envelope of the virus thereby deactivating it (Kohn et al. 1980). The detritus from
this disintegration is then trapped by the soap molecules into micelles, which are washed
away.
These molecular-level mechanisms are powered by macro-level flow phenomena associated with the movements of the hands. Amazingly, despite the 170+ year history of
handwashing in medical hygiene (Rotter 1997), we were unable to find a single published
research article on the flow physics of hand-washing. The relative movement of the hands
generates complex shear-driven flows of the soapy water, which forms a foam-laden,
multiphase emulsion. Soap bubbles, which trap micelles, segregate rapidly from the fluid
phase, thereby further accelerating the removal process.
It is known that liquid foam exhibits elastic and plastic deformation under small and
large stresses, respectively. With large enough deformation rates, the foam can rearrange
its network and flow (Weaire & Hutzler 1999), which can be studied experimentally
(Janiaud & Graner 2005). Reynolds numbers for these soapy liquid layers could exceed
O(1000), suggesting that inertia, viscosity, surface tension, and gravitational forces would
all play an important role in this process. An improved understanding of handwashing
flow physics in the COVID-19 era could provide a science-based foundation for public
guidelines/recommendations as well as new technologies that could improve the effectiveness of this practice.
4.4. Face Masks
One issue that has generated significant controversy during the COVID-19 pandemic is
the effectiveness of face masks (Elegant 2020; Dwyer & Aubrey 2020; Feng et al. 2020).
Indeed, it is likely that the years ahead will see the use of face masks become a norm in
our lives. Understanding the physics that underpins the effectiveness of face masks as a
defense against airborne pathogens is therefore, more important than ever.
Face masks provide “inward” protection by filtering virus-laden aerosolized particles
that would otherwise be inhaled by an uninfected person; and “outward” protection by
trapping virus-laden droplets expelled by an infected person (van der Sande et al. 2008).
The effectiveness of a simple face mask such as the surgical, N95 or homemade cloth
face mask is a function of the combined effect of the filtering properties of the face mask
material, the fit of the mask on the face, and the related leaks from the perimeter of the
face mask. Each of these features implicates complex flow phenomena, which are briefly
addressed here.
4.4.1. Inward Protection
The face mask material traps droplets and particles via the combined effects of
diffusion, inertial impaction, interception, and electrostatic attraction (Thomas et al.
2016; Fleming 2020). Filter efficiency (the ratio of the particle concentrations upstream
and downstream of the mask) is a function of the particle and fiber size based Reynolds
numbers, fiber-based Peclet number (for diffusion), particle-to-fiber size ratio (for interception), and Stokes number (for impaction). The non-linear variation of filtration
mechanisms on these parameters generates a complex dependency of the filter efficiency
on flow velocity, particle size, and filter material characteristics such as pore size, fiber
diameter and electrostatic charge.
The process of inhalation generates a low pressure in the region interior to the face
mask, thereby sealing (or at least reducing) perimeter leaks. Thus, with a reasonably
well fit face mask, inward protection depends primarily on the face mask filter material.
In this regard, an important characteristic of a face mask is the dependence of filtration

8

R. Mittal, R. Ni and J-H Seo

efficiency on particle size. Studies (Chen & Willeke 1992; Weber et al. 1993; Baazy et al.
2006) have shown that for a given filter, there is an intermediate particle size where
filtration efficiency is minimum. Below this size, electrostatic attraction (active for masks
such as N95) and diffusion dominate filtration, whereas above this size, impaction and
interception are the dominant mechanisms. Aerosolized virus-laden droplets and droplet
nuclei vary in size from sub-micron to millimeters and therefore the aforementioned
size-dependent filtration efficiency is an important consideration for inward protection
against COVID-19 infections. An increase in fiber density to enhance filtration efficiency
is accompanied by an increased pressure drop across the mask (Lai et al. 2012), which
requires a greater inhalation effort by the wearer. Thus, an appropriate balance has to be
achieved via proper design of the filter material, and this might be particularly important
in the post COVID-19 era, if wearing face masks becomes routine.

4.4.2. Outward Protection
The outward protection afforded by face masks has emerged as a particularly important
issue in the COVID-19 pandemic because a SARS-CoV-2 transmission may occur early
in the course of infection, not only from symptomatic patients but also asymptomatic
as well as minimally symptomatic patients (Zou et al. 2020; Bai et al. 2020; Ye et al.
2020). Indeed, the late switch to recommending universal use of face masks in the US
(Dwyer & Aubrey 2020; Elegant 2020) was based on the recognition that this spread by
asymptomatic hosts might be a significant driver of COVID-19 infections.
While a mask can significantly reduce the velocity of the throughflow jet during
expiratory events (Tang et al. 2009), the increased pressure in the region between the
mask and the face pushes the face mask outwards, resulting in increased perimeter leakage
(Liu et al. 1993; Lei et al. 2013). This fluid-structure interaction problem is mediated
by the structural design as well as the permeability of the mask. The leakage jets
that issue from the perimeter can be turbulent and highly directed (see for example,
the flow visualization in Tang et al. (2009)), potentially serving as effective dispersers
of respiratory aerosols in transverse directions. Spasmodic expiratory events such as
coughing and sneezing that generate high transient expulsion velocities will significantly
diminish the outward protection effectiveness of face masks (Lai et al. 2012). However,
in a conceivable future where people will wear face masks while engaged in their daily
routines, mask effectiveness during normal activities such as breathing and talking, might
be equally important.
In contrast to the problem of inward protection, which has been studied extensively
(Chen & Willeke 1992; Weber et al. 1993; Baazy et al. 2006), flow physics of outward
protection from face masks is less well studied. Tang et al. (2009) used Schlieren imaging
to visualize cough-induced flow with and without face masks (surgical and N95). The
study was extremely inventive but mostly qualitative, and future experiments should
provide quantitative analysis of the leakage and throughflow jets, the aerosol dispersion
through these jets, as well as the deformation of the mask during a variety of expiratory
events. Recent CFD studies of face mask aerodynamics (Lei et al. 2013; Hua Zhu et al.
2016) demonstrate the potential of computational modeling for this problem, but there is
a critical need for modeling flow-induced billowing and associated leakage enhancement
during expiratory events. Ultimately, analysis should not only enable a detailed evaluation
of the protective efficiency of face masks; it should drive design changes that enhance
mask performance and provide data that informs guidelines on practices such as social
distancing.

5. Closing
The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed significant scientific gaps in our understanding
of critical issues ranging from transmission pathways of such respiratory diseases, to
the strategies use for mitigating these transmissions. This article summarizes a fluid
dynamicists’ perspective on important aspects of the problem, including respiratory
droplet formation, two-phase expiratory flows, droplet evaporation and transport, and
face mask aerodynamics. COVID-19 touches almost every major arena of fluid dynamics,
from hydrodynamic instability to porous-media and turbulent shear flows, from droplet
breakup to particle deposition, and from Newtonian gas flows to non-Newtonian liquids.
For the topics that we have discussed, breadth and medical context have taken precedence
over a detailed exposition. COVID-19 has thrust the field of fluid dynamics into the public
eye in a way (Parshina-Kottas et al. 2020; Bourouiba 2020) not seen since the space race
of the 1960s. Our hope is that not only will this article serve as a call-to-arms to fluid
dynamicists, it will also provide a starting point for the researcher who is motivated to
tackle the science of COVID-19, and other similar diseases that are sure to appear in the
not-too-distant future.
