Abstract. In this work we present a method for the detection of radiological findings, their location and differential diagnoses from chest
x-rays. Unlike prior works that focus on the detection of few pathologies,
we use a hierarchical taxonomy mapped to the Unified Medical Language
System (UMLS) terminology to identify 189 radiological findings, 22 differential diagnosis and 122 anatomic locations, including ground glass
opacities, infiltrates, consolidations and other radiological findings compatible with COVID-19. We train the system on one large database of
92,594 frontal chest x-rays (AP or PA, standing, supine or decubitus) and
a second database of 2,065 frontal images of COVID-19 patients identified by at least one positive Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test. The
reference labels are obtained through natural language processing of the
radiological reports. On 23,159 test images, the proposed neural network
obtains an AUC of 0.94 for the diagnosis of COVID-19. To our knowledge, this work uses the largest chest x-ray dataset of COVID-19 positive
cases to date and is the first one to use a hierarchical labeling schema
and to provide interpretability of the results, not only by using network
attention methods, but also by indicating the radiological findings that
have led to the diagnosis.

patients with COVID-19. While most methods are focused on the classification
of images into the categories COVID-19, other pathologies or no pathology, the
early detection and localization of lesions such as infiltrates, in particular ground
glass opacities, is essential both for the diagnosis and to predict the evolution of
the patient in order to help making clinical decisions.
The typical findings that suggest a COVID-19 infection are ground glass
opacities that, even in the initial stages, affect both lungs, particularly the lower
lobes, and especially the posterior segments, mainly with a peripheral and subpleural distribution [26,33,19]. These findings were present in 44% of patients
in the first two days on chest CT scans [2], in 75% of patients in the first four
days [20] and in 86% of patients during illness days 0-5 [32].
Therefore, beyond classifying an image as COVID/No/Others, it is very important to obtain the radiological findings in order to understand the severity
of the disease and to predict the possible evolution of the patient. Moreover, it
should be taken into account that some PCR positive COVID-19 patients may
show a normal RX, therefore only with the image information it may not be
possible to perform a correct diagnosis. Similarly, not all radiological findings
compatible with COVID-19, such as ground glass opacities, are indeed produced
by a Sars-Cov-2 infection. Unlike diagnoses, findings are reported by the radiologists and they can be seen in the images, being less dependent on other clinical
variables.
An example of the proposed methodology can be seen in Fig. 1. A chest
x-ray (left) is tagged by processing its radiology report with natural language
processing to a set of hierarchical labels (middle). The network predicts such
labels that include not only the presence of the disease (COVID-19), but also
the radiological findings that have lead to it. Please note that the model detects
two findings that were not present on the radiology report but are consistent with
COVID-19. The proposed method is not constrained to COVID-19, but contains

UMLS-ChestNet

an extense set of labels that encompasses most of the diseases and radiological
findings that can be interpreted from a chest x-ray.
Deep learning methods are widely used for chest x-ray pathology detection.
In order to train these models, it is essential to have a large dataset of images
properly annotated. In the literature there are many datasets intended for this
task such as [13,14,31], with a maximum of 14 output variables associated with
them, and none with ground glass opacities or infiltrates as part of their covariates. To the best of our knowledge, the only open dataset currently labeled
with a large set of radiological findings is PadChest [6]. PadChest includes more
than 160,000 images obtained from 67,000 patients that were interpreted and
reported by radiologists at San Juan Hospital (Spain) from 2009 to 2017, covering six different position views, and including additional information on image
acquisition and patient demography. Padchest labels were extracted from the radiological reports, resulting in 22 differential diagnoses, 122 anatomic locations
and 189 different radiological findings mapped onto standard Unified Medical
Language System (UMLS) using controlled biomedical vocabulary unique identifiers (CUIs) that are organized into semantic hierarchical concept trees. Padchest is the only open dataset that provides labels for consolidations, pneumonia
and ground glass opacities, as needed to diagnose COVID-19.
Different neural network architectures have been proposed in the literature
for the classification of pathologies [23,29] from RX images using the datasets
from [13,14,31]. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no previous work
addressing the classification of a large set of radiological findings as described
by [6].
Some recent models based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have
been proposed for the detection of COVID 19. Most of them can be found in
recent review articles, such as [25,17,5]. However, they all rely on the same
public dataset [8] for positive samples [18,11,1], or subsequent works derived
from it [15,30,10,7]. The dataset from [8] is obtained by gathering images from
other publications, which are indeed of low spatial and bitdepth resolution. As
negative samples the cited work uses data from the RSNA challenge [22] or from
the Kaggle competition [21], which is composed of pediatric images. Moreover,
it should be considered that there is a domain mismatch between the positives
and the negatives, and therefore, it may happen that models would find events
on the images that are not related to the disease but on the domain itself.

Material and methods
Dataset

In this work we use the images and labels from PadChest [6] and BIMCV
COVID-19+ [12]. Both contain labels that are mapped into NLM Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) controlled biomedical vocabulary unique identifiers, referred as CUIs, along with the localizations. Four additional labels with
special coding rules were explicitly defined: normal, exclude, unchanged and suboptimal study. Although the excerpts from the report are provided in Spanish,

labels are mapped onto CUI codes, thus making the dataset usable regardless of
the language. In addition, the labels are structured using a tree structure.

Table 1. Examples of the hierarchical radiological findings, diagnoses and locations
present on the reference standard. For the full tree we refer the reader to the supplementary material.

Some examples of the tree for differential diagnosis, radiological findings and
localizations are shown in Table 1. Overall, PadChest contains more than 160,000
images with 189 different radiographic findings, 22 differential diagnoses and 122
anatomic locations. The 92,594 frontal images of the PadChest dataset were used
for this work.
Since PadChest’s data were collected until 2017, it does not include COVID19 labels. However, the recently released BIMCV COVID-19+ dataset, whose
acquisition methodology and organization is based on PadChest, is intended for
training machine learning methods to detect this pathology. This is currently
the largest open chest X-ray COVID-19 dataset. It contains chest CXR (CR,
DX) and computed tomography (CT) imaging of COVID-19 patients along with
their radiographic findings, pathologies, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and Immunoglobulin M (IgM) diagnostic antibody tests,
and radiological reports from Medical Imaging Databank in Valencian Region
Medical Image Bank (BIMCV).
Like in PadChest, the BIMCV COVID-19+ labels cover a wide spectrum of
thoracic entities, images are stored in high resolution and entities are localized
with anatomical labels in a Medical Imaging Data Structure (MIDS) format.
In addition, 18 image studies were annotated by a team of expert radiologists
to include semantic segmentation of radiological findings. Moreover, it provides
extensive information, including the patient’s demographic information, type of
projection and acquisition parameters for the imaging study, among others.
The BIMCV COVID-19+ iteration used in the presented work includes 1,380
CR and 885 DX that were added to the full PadChest samples for training,
testing and validation. COVID-19 is a pathology where RT-PCR is considered
the gold standard for diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia [16]. Its pattern of
radiological findings, even if typical, are not pathognomonic, i.e. their presence
does not mean that COVID-19 pneumonia is present beyond any doubt and
other pathologies as other atypical and viral pneumonias need to be ruled out.
For this reason, COVID-19 pneumonia was included in the taxonomy tree under
the differential diagnosis branch [12].

Image preprocesing

Only frontal images, either with PA or AP, supine, decubitus, lordotic or standing
were included in this work. Such images were identified in the databases by
inspecting the manual annotations. Images with photometric interpretation of
MonochromeI, as signaled on the DICOM fields were inverted. Image intensities
were normalized by subtracting the mean dividing by the variance before using
them to train any of the proposed networks.
In order to normalize the image size, we first cropped a centered square region
of interest, with the size of the smallest image axis. Such technique is preferred
to interpolating to a square grid in order to prevent anatomical deformations,
and also preferred to image padding to prevent misleading the network at the radiography edges. Images were finally re-scaled to 299×299 pixels to be processed
by the neural network.
2.3

Label propagation

The labels for each image are mapped to the UMLS hierarchy. They are extracted
from the NLP interpretation of the radiological reports. Only few nodes of the
UMLS tree are extracted from each radiology report. The UMLS hierarchy has
an is-a relationship for both the differential diagnoses and radiological findings
trees, and an is-part-of relationship for the anatomical location tree. We therefore
construct for each image a target vector that places ’1’ on each node that is in
the interpretation of the radiology report or any of their parents until the root.
For instance, if the image is associated with a COVID-19 diagnosis as interpreted
from the radiological report, and using the tree shown in Fig. 1, we would flag
the image as being positive for viral pneumonia, atopical pneumonia, pneumonia
and differential diagnosis. An image with a label of pneumonia would not have
a COVID-19 diagnosis.
2.4

Training

We evaluate three image classification topologies in this work: EfficientNetB4
[28], Inception-Resnet-V2 [27] and XNet [4]. Each of these architectures is extended by using two fully connected layers of 512 units with rectified linear
units (ReLU) activation and a final classification layer of length 306 with sigmoid activation. Dropout layers with dropout coefficient of 0.2 were interleaved
between the fully connected layers. The model weights were pre-trained using
the ImageNet [9] database.
The loss function employed is a binary cross entropy for each of the output dimensions independently, since correlations between dimensions are already
handled by the construction of the target labels through the label propagation
method. The networks are trained using adaptive momentum optimization with
a learning rate schedule that decreases the learning rate between 10−3 for the
first epochs to 10−6 for the last ones. Training is performed for 50 epochs and
the model with the best validation accuracy was selected.

in such manner that two images from the same patient can not appear in the

Results
One class versus all

First, the performance of the method is evaluated in a per-label setting. As
such, we consider as positive for a radiological finding, differential diagnosis or
location, any image that has such variable or any of its children on the reference standard interpretation of the radiology report. This allows us to obtain

UMLS-ChestNet

a per variable positive and negative class. The comparison results of the three
networks favors EfficientNetB4, with an average AUC over all radiological findings, locations and diagnoses of 0.787, in comparison with XCeption (AUC of
0.768) or InceptionResnetV2 (AUC of 0.737). Table 2 shows the top eight and
bottom eight diagnoses or radiological findings detected by each network. In the
supplementary material we show the performance for the whole UMLS tree.
3.2

COVID-19 Results

The aim of this work is to assist in the diagnosis of COVID-19. We therefore
put special focus on the evaluation of those findings that are compatible with
the disease. In chest x-rays, COVID-19 is associated with ground glass opacities,
consolidations and alveolar patterns. Fig 2 shows the performance of the classifier
for such variables. The area under the curve for the EfficientNetB4 network for
COVID-19 is of 0.937 (95% CI between 0.924 to 0.950), for consolidations is of
0.924 (95% CI between 0.910 and 0.938), for ground glass opacities is of 0.840
(95% CI interval between 0.783 and 0.897), for alveolar patterns is of 0.923 (95%
CI between 0.914 and 0.933) and for infiltrates of 0.871 (95% CI between 0.863
and 0.879).
Of interest is to show the capacity of the model to distinguish between
COVID-19 and other pneumonias. To perform such test we have selected the
images from the test set that have any type of pneumonia and evaluate in such
subsets the performance of COVID-19 detection. The AUCs obtained are 0.73
for EfficientnetB4 and 0.70 for both InceptionResnetV2 and XCeption. When
evaluating the EfficientNetB4, no image from padchest had a score for COVID19 higher than 0.5, showing that the network does not produce false positives
on COVID-19 negative images.
We have used the well known GradCam [24] method to estimate the regions
of the image that contributed most to the prediction of the variables. An example
is shown in Fig. 3. Consolidations appear mainly at the left lung, ground glass
opacities at the right lung and the diagnosis of COVID 19 is produced by features
located at both the left and right lungs, mainly on the lower lobes. While the
three heatmaps are obtained independently, thy complement each other and
explain the decisions made by the network.
The software was implemented with Keras and Tensorflow libraries in Python.
Training was performed in parallel on four Nvidia 1080Ti GPUs cards. It took
11.4 minutes per epoch for the EfficientNetB4 network, 11 minutes per epoch
for InceptionResnetV2 network and 21 minutes for XCeption.

Discussion

In this work, we present a method for chest x-ray image classification based on
deep neural networks which outputs hierarchical radiological findings, differential
diagnosis and localization outcome variables. The reference standard is obtained
using natural language processing from the radiological reports.

and quantified in the legend.

On the 23,159 test images, the method shows a high average AUC score
of all the variables (0.79 for EfficientNetB4), holding promise for its future use.
Radiological findings that are large in size, specially due to artificial objects such
as pacemakers or heart valves, are the ones showing higher AUCs. Smaller or
subtle findings such as azygos lobe, rib fractures or air trapping show significantly
lower performance. This could be partly explained by the image size that has
been used in the method. Due to computational reasons, the image size had to
be reduced to 299x299 pixels. Full-size images are around 8 megapixels. Such
reduction in the image resolution eliminates textures and edges, that could be
of great importance to detect subtle structures.
When evaluating the performance on COVID-19, the proposed method successfully distinguished COVID-19 patients, with an AUC of 0.94, showing promising results for the diagnosis of cases amidst the pandemic. When evaluated to

distinguish between COVID-19 caused pneumonia and other pneumonia types,
the AUC dropped to 0.73. When evaluating the network on the subset of patients with pneumonia from the PadChest dataset, no subject had a COVID-19
score higher than 0.5. The drop in the AUC can be explained by several reasons.
The first one is the source of the reference standard. The BIMCV COVID-19+
dataset has been acquired amidst the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and
the radiological reports may not have correctly included COVID-19 information.
For instance, 10 out of the 18 image studies with regions of interest included in
the dataset were not marked as being COVID-19 positive in the radiology report,
although they have ground glass opacities or consolidations that were marked
by reviewing radiologists specialized in COVID-19.
The reference standard used for training comes from natural language processing methods applied to the radiological reports. As mentioned by [3], such
reference standard is considered of moderate quality, and task-specific expert annotation is preferred for the training and development of artificial intelligence
methods. The source of the reference standard is a limitation of the proposed
work. It should be note that all prior art related to automated interpretation
of chest x-rays using the datasets of [13,6,14,31] have the same limitation. An
evaluation of the quality of the reference standard would be necessary to solidify
the results.
Further, the reference standard is composed of disease and locations, which
are classified independently. It would be of interest to intertwine them, such that
diseases that are in certain locations can not produce outcomes in incompatible locations and vice-versa. For instance, cardiomegaly as a single radiological
finding can not appear at the same time as the location peripheral. Beyond locations, the hierarchical relationships of the variables are exploited at training,
but not at detection, and they could be used to make stronger predictions. For
instance, a moderately positive ground glass pattern could be rejected if their
parent neurons did not fire adequately. Such methods are left as future work.
Different image classification networks can be used for the proposed methodology. In this work we have evaluated XCeption, InceptionResnetV2 and

X

G. González et al.

EFficientNetB4. The performance order followed that of the original networks
on the ImageNet classification database, being EfficientNetB4 the network that
has a highest average AUC. Still, the network and the training methodology
chosen in this work are relatively simple for current state-of-the-art deep neural
networks. Methods such as ensemble learning and cosine decay learning rate [15],
uncertainty estimation [11] or more advanced hierarchical training methods may
improve the results.
A topic of discussion is whether the construction of the prediction labels by
placing a ’1’ on the labels in the reference standard as well an all its parents is
correct. For instance, while ground glass opacity (GGO) is an infiltrate, when
describing the radiological findings in one image, one should clearly state that
it is a GGO and not an infiltrate. We have addressed such topic in a two-fold
manner. For training, we place ’1’ on all variables until the root. We do so since,
using the same example as before, all GGO are indeed infiltrates. However, when
we perform testing for GGO, all images that does not have GGO in the reference
standard, even those with other kind of infiltrates, are marked as ’0’. This allows
us to accurately evaluate the performance of GGO detection.
While the two datasets mixed for training are from the same region of Spain,
they differ in their origin. Padchest is a single institution dataset (images were
obtained from one hospital), while BIMCV COVID-19+ images were obtained
from several institutions. This may lead to domain subtleties that are guiding
the performance. A more in-depth evaluation of whether such is the case would
be needed and is a limitation of this work. Furthermore, it should be considered
that the majority of the population in the Valencian region is Caucasian.
Despite the above-mentioned limitations, the proposed work has value, since,
to our knowledge, it is the first neural network used to interpret chest x-rays that
uses hierarchical labels based on the UMLS entity relationships of radiological
findings, differential diagnoses and locations. Further, it is the first work to use
a large, open, dataset of COVID-19+ images for training and evaluation that
comes from the same sources as the COVID-19 negative samples.

Conclusions

We have presented a method for the detection of hierarchical radiological findings
(189 nodes), their anatomical location (122 nodes) and the diagnoses associated
(22 variables) from chest x-rays. The method has been trained and evaluated
on a composed large dataset of 94,659 frontal chest x-rays, achieving an average
AUC of 0.787 for all the variables. When evaluated on COVID-19+ cases, results
show a reliable performance, with an AUC of 0.94. The main advantage of the
proposed method compared to previous works is that it provides explainability
of the diagnoses, since not only the outcome variable are given, but also the
radiological findings that have led to diagnoses, such as ground glass patterns
(AUC of 0.84), consolidations (AUC of 0.92) or alveolar patterns (AUC of 0.92).
We believe that the proposed hierarchical labeling and training could be
applied for further work on chest x-ray image interpretation. It is also planned to

UMLS-ChestNet

annotate COVID-19 related findings at a pixel level in order to perform semantic
segmentation, since the number and area of these lesions is relevant both for the
diagnosis and the prognostic.
