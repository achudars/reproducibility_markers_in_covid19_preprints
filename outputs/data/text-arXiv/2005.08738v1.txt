Abstract
The emergence of the novel Coronavirus Disease in late 2019 (COVID-19) and subsequent
pandemic led to an immense disruption in the daily lives of almost everyone on the planet.
Faced with the consequences of inaction, most national governments responded with policies
that restricted the activities conducted by their inhabitants. As schools and businesses shuttered,
the mobility of these people decreased. This reduction in mobility, and related activities, was
recorded through ubiquitous location-enabled personal mobile devices. Patterns emerged that
varied by place-based activity. In this work the differences in these place-based activity patterns
are investigated across nations, specifically focusing on the relationship between government
enacted policies and changes in community activity patterns. We show that people’s activity
response to government action varies widely both across nations as well as regionally within
them. Three assessment measures are devised and the results correlate with a number of global
indices. We discuss these findings and the relationship between government action and residents’
response.

1. Introduction
The emergence and global spread of the novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), caused
by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, will have a lasting impact on human life. In late 2019, the disease
was identified in Wuhan, China and quickly spread across the globe [1]. Nations responded in
a variety of ways as cases of the disease increased dramatically within their populations. Some
governments responded immediately, severely restricting residents’ mobility and pausing most
economic activity [2] while others chose to implement less restrictive policies [3]. Across the
globe, borders began to close and many national governments chose to close schools and businesses, essentially shutting down local economies, while others limited their response to simple
physical distancing practices [4]. The speed at which countries responded to this pandemic also
varied drastically with some governments taking action within days of their first confirmed cases,
and others waiting to implement public health policies until a pattern could be identified. Still
other governments have yet to instrument meaningful COVID-19-related policy choosing instead
to make an argument for “herd immunity” [5].
At the heart of the pandemic, however, are the inhabitants of these different countries. People
look to their government for information on the severity and spread of the disease and rely on
what they are told to make informed decisions on how to act. For most, government enacted

policies dictate how they will conduct their daily affairs during a global health emergency. As
officials around the world began to cancel public events and limit public transit options, inhabitants were forced to respond by limiting their mobility and changing their activity behavior.
A decade ago, this change in community mobility would have been measured at a large scale
through survey samples of the population. Today, however, this change in activity behavior is
being monitored and recorded in real-time through context-aware technology. The ubiquity of
location-enabled mobile devices means that mobile device manufacturers (e.g., Apple, Google)
and data providers (e.g., Verizon, Deutsche Telekom) have unlocked access to the mobility activity of people around the planet to a degree previously unattainable.
During this crisis, a few of these companies have offered limited public access to anonymized
aggregations of this data. Apple, for example, is reporting a decrease in human mobility globally
based on route searches performed by users of their Maps platform over the past few month [6].
In some instances route queries have dropped below 80% of their baseline suggesting that a
significant amount of users have reduced their mobility due to the pandemic. Similar results have
been released by the Descartes Lab, an analytics company, for counties in the United States [7].
Aside from purely spatial movement data, other companies have focused on discrete places,
using location-enabled mobile device data to identify the types of places (e.g., Bank, Grocery
Store, Restaurant) people visit, and how their visiting behavior has changed over the past few
months. For instance, Foursquare [8] has demonstrated the impact of COVID-19 on place-based
social media check-ins within the United States1 and SafeGraph [9] is publishing similar data
based on a panel of location-based mobile surveys.
Aside from the Apple Maps data, however, the vast majority of data published on changes
in human activity behavior has focused exclusively on the United States. In this work, we are
interested in how the residents of different countries respond to their government’s policies related to COVID-19, therefore identifying the place-based activity responses of people from a
range of countries is essential. With this goal in mind, we make use of the Google Community
Mobility Dataset. This dataset is an aggregate of the place-based activity behavior of millions
of individuals as collected through their location-enabled mobile devices. If a mobile device
user has Google Location Services enabled (required when using the Google Maps application),
their location data is anonymously collected, aggregated with other users across a region (e.g.,
Country or District), and reported in one of six place type categories. Further information on
these categories is discussed in Section 3.1. Not only are these data based on one of the most
widely used location-based services on the planet, but the data is also passively collected thus
reducing the bias of the mobility patterns, as compared to active collection such as surveys or
“check-ins” [10]. For the purposes of this research, this data is an ideal representation of activity response to the COVID-19 pandemic and forms the foundation on which we conduct our
analysis.
As of early May 2020 (time of writing) most governments have responded to the crisis to the
degree they are likely to, and we are currently observing many governments announce plans to
lift lock-downs, relax mobility restrictions, and re-open their economies. Now is an opportune
time to examine the relationship between government action and resident response with respect
to place-based activities. Understanding how residents of certain countries responded to their
government in a time of crisis is essential for predicting how people may react in future crises
and exposing the dynamic between politicians and their constituents in difficult times. It also

helps us to identify which countries respond to crises in similar (or different) ways. With these
objectives in mind, our analysis focuses on developing three assessment measures on which
to compare and contrast countries through their response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These
assessment measures will be developed by addressing the following five research questions (RQ).
RQ1 Is there a quantifiable relationship between the policies enacted by a country’s government
and the place-based activity response from their inhabitants? For instance, is the magnitude
of policy action mirrored by the magnitude of activity response? Do countries differ in their
responses? This question helps us understand whether the changes in activity patterns that
we see world-wide are actually due to the imposition of government policies, or perhaps
due to some other reason, e.g., international media. The differences between countries
give insight into differences among governments in their ability to enact the envisioned
policies.
RQ2 Which of the six place-based activity categories, as reported by Google, are most affected
by policy action? Do these remain consistent between countries? This helps us to identify which policies are most effective for influencing human behavior in order to limit the
spread of COVID-19, and also which policies are less effective. Since limiting different
kinds of activities will lead to different economic outcomes, better understanding this relationship helps us optimize our responses for the desired outcome.
RQ3 Is there a measurable temporal lag between policy enactment and activity response? If so,
does this lag vary between countries? During an exponential growth phase of a disease
such as COVID-19 a delay of just a few days can make a large difference in the outcome.
Understanding temporal lags between policy enactment and activity response is critical to
inform policy-makers who are trying to quickly enact social distancing policies.
RQ4 Does an increase in activity pattern variability within a country (at the subnational level)
correlate with a decrease in similarity to government response (RQ1)? This helps us to
understand whether a unified, national response is more or less effective than one that is
managed by regional and local governments.
RQ5 How does the relationship between government policy action and place-based activity response correlate with global indices (such as the Development Index or Corruption Perception Index)? This last research question gives some insight into whether there are distal
causes based on the socio-economic and political conditions within countries that influence
how place-based activity manifests under government imposed lockdown conditions.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we discuss existing work
on this topic and related topics. An overview of the data used in this analysis is presented in
Section 3. Section 4 presents the methodology used in developing the assessment measures and
showcases how these measures can be applied to compare and contrast nations. This is followed
by Section 5 where we compare our three assessment measures with existing global indices.
Finally, our findings are discussed in Section 6 and future work and conclusions are presented to
the reader.
2. Related Work
We are still in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. A burgeoning domain of biomedical research has developed around the virus itself with many researchers just now beginning
3

to study the global societal impacts of the disease. Much of the emerging peer-reviewed work
has focused on the regions with early outbreaks. One such study by Kraemer et al. [11] studied
the correlation between real-time mobility data from the internet service company Baidu and the
spread of the disease in Wuhan, China. The authors found that once the national government
established control measures, the correlation decreased substantially. Further work on the transmission rate of the disease found that travel restrictions enacted by the government delayed the
epidemic progression by 3-5 days within China, but significantly slowed the spread elsewhere in
the world [12] pointing to the global impacts of the policy actions taken by a single country.
Much of the response research being conducted on COVID-19 is still in its infancy, but we
can look to other recent global events to understand how nations and their people respond. There
is an existing body of literature exploring the impact of natural disasters [13], terrorism [14], and
economic crises [15] on human mobility and activity patterns. Most of these studies define human mobility at the scale of migration between localized regions and little research has explored
the day-to-day impact on the mobility of individuals or groups at a multi-national level, brought
about by a global crisis.
In attempting to find parallels to the current pandemic, we turn to research on the response to
previous global pandemics. There have been a series of studies that explore the impact of human
movement on the spread of diseases including influenza [16], ebola [17, 18], and infectious
diseases in general [19]. Many of these studies make use of local population datasets including
mobile device call detail records (CDRs), location histories, and the results of travel/mobility
surveys. For instance, Dallatomasina et al. [20] used cellphone records to track the transmission
of ebola in rural West Africa with some success. Early research out of Brazil has shown this
methodology to be useful in tracking the spread of COVID-19 [21]. Much of this work is a precursor to mobile device-based contact tracing applications that are currently in the works [22].
Few studies, however, have had access to the breadth or volume of data now being collected and
published by private technology companies as a response to this specific pandemic.
As companies release their data to researchers, a growing body of work is emerging related to
COVID-19 mobility response. The vast majority of this work is focused in the United States with
very limited work concentrated at the global scale. Visualization tools for supporting analytics
have been a target for many researchers [23, 24]. Other efforts have investigated the relationship
between political views and compliance with government policy [25, 26]. U.S.-focused research
has also demonstrated that government policy that limits every day life has been shown to be
having an impact on many sectors of the economy [27]. A recent study of high school students
suggested that school closures and concerns over COVID-19 are significantly impacting performance of students in their subject areas [28] and will continue to have a lasting impact on our
education system. While limited data is available, similar educational and economic impacts are
also being found outside of the United States [29].
Similar work to what we present here has investigated certain economic factors that contribute to a change in place-based activity patterns (also using Google community mobility patterns) [30, 31]. These efforts, however, did not look at government policy as a whole or the correlation of response over time. Other researchers have used this data to predict specific countrylevel responses in the future [32, 33]. To the best of our knowledge, no research has investigated
the relationship between government policy action and place-based activity response at the scale
we present here, or using the range of methods we propose.

In early April 2020 Google began publishing static reports showing daily change in activity
patterns starting from February 15th [34]. These reports, which Google call their Community
Mobility Reports,2 present plots containing daily percentage change from baseline (baseline being January 3–February 6, 2020) for six activity categories in 129 countries. The place types
that contribute to these activity categories were determined by Google and labeled as Grocery
& pharmacy, Parks, Transit stations, Retail & recreation, Residential, Workplaces. Brief descriptions of these categories are available in the Google community mobility documentation.3
In late April, Google began providing the raw values for these data along side the original PDF
reports. For this study, we are using activity reports that cover an eight week time period from
February 15 to April 11, 2020. The maximum baseline change in the negative direction was
100% and 497% in the positive direction (an outlier due to a country-wide festival). An example
of these activity patterns are shown in Figure 1 along with the stringency index for the country
(introduced in the next section).

3.2. Government Policy and Stringency Index
As nations around the world were faced with the spreading COVID-19 pandemic, their governments responded with a range of measures and policy decisions. A team of researchers at the
Blavatnik School of Government, University of Oxford developed a tool to track these measures
and produce a response dataset4 that allows national policy responses to be compared across a
range of measures. The key product of this Coronavirus Government Response Tracker is the
Stringency Index. This index is made of up 13 indicators of government response, recorded daily
for 149 countries. Nine of these indicators assign an ordinal value to policy action related to
school closures, travel bans, public event cancellations, etc. The other three focus on financial or
monetary measures. The Stringency Index is calculated through a weighted combination of these
indicators with a minimum value of 0 and maximum of 100. The index was calculated back to
January 1, 2020 and through to at least April 11 (the end of our temporal analysis window). The
full methodology for how this stringency index was developed is available at [35]. The dataset is
currently being used in a range of preliminary COVID-19 related analysis [36, 37, 38].
3.3. Indices and Country Information
Finally, we compare the results of our analysis to a number of other country-specific attributes
and global indices. The latest population counts, areas, and population densities for each country
were accessed from GeoNames.org.5 The number of confirmed cases and deaths due to COVID19 were downloaded from the World Health Organization Coronavirus dashboard.6 Two indices
of global development were used, the United Nations Human Development Index [39] and the
World Bank World Development Indicators.7 Finally, the results of our analysis were compared
against the Corruption Perception Index [40] and the World Press Freedom Index published by
Reporters Without Borders.8
4. Assessing place-based activity response to government policy action
In this section we discuss the methodology used to assess the relationship between the stringency index, representing a country’s government policy action, and the place-based activity patterns recorded via mobile devices, representing inhabitant response. We establish three methods
of assessing the response: similarity in magnitude of response, lag response time, and subregional variability of the response.
4.1. Similarity
Two different methods, cosine similarity and Pearson correlation, were initially used in addressing RQ1—assessment of the similarities between the stringency index and activity patterns.
The cosine similarity approach views both sets of data as a set of vectors, measuring the cosine
of the angle between each pair and producing a similarity value bounded between 0 and 1. While
both cosine similarity and Pearson’s correlation are fundamentally variations on the inner product, they vary based on centering. For our purposes, cosine similarity is the most appropriate

method for comparing activity patterns to government policy over time due to the fact that it is
not invariant to shifts, a feature that is not true for Pearson’s correlation. We will use both of
these approaches, however, for assessing similarity and report later on the correlation.
Given our hypothesis that activity patterns decrease over time in response to an increase in the
stringency index, we first inverted five of the six mobility patterns, namely Retail & recreation,
Grocery & pharmacy, Workplace, Transit stations, and Parks in order to conduct similarity assessment (as opposed to dissimilarity). These five activity patterns are expected to decrease with
an increase in government policy. The Residential pattern, on the other hand, is expected to
increase as government restrictions increase, so this was not inverted.
4.1.1. Assessing activity patterns across countries
After flipping five of the activity patterns, cosine similarity and Pearson’s correlation were
calculated between each of the six categories and the stringency index for each country. Averaging across all countries, the cosine similarities are shown in Table 1.

Table 1: Average cosine similarity comparing each place-based activity category to the stringency index across all countries.

The results of this analysis identify differences in the relationship of each activity pattern to
the stringency index (RQ2). Three categories, Transit stations, Residential, and Retail & recreation, all report relatively high similarity and low standard deviations suggesting that these similarities are relatively consistent across all countries. The Workplace activity category clearly
aligns with the stringency index though not to the same degree as the previously mentioned
three. Some potential reasons for this are explored in Section 6. As expected, Parks are least
similar to the stringency index, and with a high standard deviation, which indicates there is considerable variation in this mobility pattern across countries. The Grocery & pharmacy category
is not as close to the stringency index with a larger standard deviation across countries than one
might expect. Again, some potential reasons for this are discussed in Section 6. Notably, the
ranked order similarity for activity categories based on averaged Pearson correlation is the same
as that of cosine similarity.
4.1.2. Assessing countries across activity patterns
The previous section focused on the six categories and averaged across countries, here we
average across activity patterns and compare individual country responses. We calculated the
mean of the cosine similarity between each activity pattern and the stringency index for all activity categories excluding Parks (due to the volatility and weather dependency of this category).
This resulted in a single similarity value for each country. We also calculated the average Pearson’s correlation coefficient value in a similar manner. Provided a cosine similarity and Pearson’s
correlation for each country, we computed Kendall’s τ to measure concordance between the two
7

measures. This produced a τ correlation coefficient of 0.602 (p < 0.01), indicating a high level
of concordance between these two approaches.
Countries were then ranked based on their average activity pattern to stringency index similarity. In essence, this similarity value provides a relative indication of how a population responds
to COVID-19-related policy enacted by its government. A high average similarity suggests that
an increase in government policy leads to a decrease in overall place-based activity. Plots for
three of the countries with the highest average similarity are shown in Figure 2 with three of
the least similar shown in Figure 3. The full rank of countries is available in the project data
directory at https://platial.science/covid19code.

Figure 2: Highest average cosine similarity between stringency index and five place-based activity patterns.

Visually we see a high degree of similarity in the magnitude and absolute slope of the lines
in these Figures, representing the actions taken by the government and the response from residents. Exploring the countries with the least similar patterns, the country with the lowest value
was South Korea. Further investigation found that this is solely due to the time window of our
analysis. The peak of new cases in South Korea occurred on February 29, 2020 and local health
officials started testing airport staff on January 21, 2020. This is supported by the high stringency
index value of 60 as it enters our analysis window on February 15th. Similarly, Japan, Taiwan,
Mongolia, and Hong Kong all show high stringency indices entering our analysis window suggesting that if a substantial decrease in residents’ place-based activity occurred, it likely took
place prior to February 15th and adjustments from the baseline (the previous months as mentioned in the Data section) would be quite small. The first country that entered our time analysis
window with a relatively stable stringency index near zero was Sweden followed closely by all
other Scandinavian countries. This supports reporting by journalists and policy risk analysts
that Scandinavian governments, specifically Sweden, are approaching the pandemic differently
than most other countries [41, 42]. Tanzania (Figure 3c) is the country with the lowest cosine
similarity between citizen activity response and government stringency index outside of Asia or
Europe.

the activity patterns overall without explicitly focusing on any one aspect of the curves. In some

instances, however, there is a delay effect between the policy enactment and the response. We
might see that the slope of the stringency index suddenly increases and three days later that
change is mirrored by the activity patterns. In addressing RQ3 we must first test to determine
if there is a quantifiable temporal lag between government action and population response. If
a lag response exists, we can then identify which countries demonstrate the smallest or largest
response lags.
The lag response analysis was done using a signal processing approach, calculating the crosscorrelation as a measure of displacement similarity between each place-based activity pattern and
the stringency index for each country. The result is a vector containing the cross-correlation of the
input vector based on lag. For example, if there is no significant lag between the stringency index
and an activity pattern, the highest cross-correlation would be found at lag zero and diminish as
lag increases and decrease. Should a larger number of high cross-correlation values appear in
negative lag positions, this indicates that a significant change in the stringency index occurred
before a significant change in the activity pattern. Given that our units are days, the lag steps are
also days.
Rather than focus purely on the single lag value with the peak cross-correlation value, we
instead calculate the number of lag days with cross-correlation values above a significance alpha
value of 0.5 and split them into lag days above and below zero. We then subtract the number
of remaining negative lag days from the number of positive lag days to produce our average
lag for that activity pattern–stringency index pair. This approach is intended to be more robust
than looking for the single highest cross-correlation value as it considers skewness in the lag
distribution. This is a weighted approach to identifying the peak lag day as a function of all lags
above the threshold avoiding an approach that ignores neighboring lag values in favor of a single
peak.
Similar to our previous analysis, cross-correlation analysis was done between each activity pattern and the stringency index for each country and then averaged across all five activity
patterns (excluding Parks) producing an average, signed lag response in days. The countries
were then ranked based on the lag response. Three countries with the largest lag—as reported
by a significant change in the stringency index occurring well before or after the citizen activity
response—are shown in Figure 4. The vast majority of countries reported a negative lag response
9

with a mean of -2.4 days. In a select few instances the lag response was positive. Most of these
could be explained by significant non-COVID-19 related events. For instance, Egypt’s positive
lag is due to a severe weather event on March 12, 2020. Removing this event results in a lag
of -4.0.

The average lag time for each activity pattern was calculated across all countries and is shown
in Table 2. The high standard deviation for each of these categories speaks to the high degree
of global variability in this assessment measure. The Grocery & pharmacy category reports the
highest average lag time including the largest standard deviation. As many grocery stores were
labeled essential services in many countries, and therefore not mandated to close, people could
choose to go to a grocery store immediately, or a few days after, to stock up on supplies in
response to an increase in government COVID-19 related restrictions.

4.3. Subregional variability within countries
Of the 108 countries with suitable place-based activity data for our analysis, 46 of them also
contain sub national regions (e.g., provinces or states) with their own activity patterns. While the
stringency index is only reported at the national level, we thought it important to investigate the
variation in place-based activity responses between subregions in the same country.
To accomplish this task we extracted all subregional activity data and again split them by
category. Cosine similarity was computed for each subregion to each other subregion for each
10

category producing six matrices per country. The standard deviation were taken for each category
matrix in each country. Finally, we calculated the mean standard deviation across all categories
in a country to produce a single “within country” variation value on which to compare nations.
The purpose of this analysis was to determine the degree to which countries vary in their response to government action, within their own borders. The results speak to the power afforded
national governments during crises. A low standard deviation indicates that communities within
the same country responded similarly. A high standard deviation implies that communities in
different subnational regions responded differently, possibly heeding advice from local governments instead of at the national level.
The results of this subregional similarity analysis were compared to the results of our first
cosine similarity assessment approach, namely the stringency index to country level activity
average similarities, using Kendall’s τ method. The resulting concordance coefficient was 0.41 (p
< 0.01) indicating that there is reasonably high positive correlation between the two results (RQ4).
This indicates that countries whose residents respond to national government policy actions by
reducing activities are also more likely to respond consistently across subnational regions.
To this point, two countries that exemplify this difference are the United States and New
Zealand. The United States ranked as having one of the highest sub-national region standard
deviations, which is to be expected given the authority placed on state governors during the
COVID-19 pandemic and the hands-off approach of the federal government [43]. The similarity
of the United States’ country-level activity response to the stringency index was in the lower
30th percentile of all countries in our dataset. In contrast, New Zealand ranked quite high in
both measures reflecting the perceived authority of the national government and commonality of
the response from residents across subregions within the country. Overall the countries with the
highest variation in subregional response were Nigeria, Uruguay, Australia, USA, and Canada.
The countries with the least variation were clustered predominantly in Europe with France, Italy,
and Spain topping the list.
4.4. Spatial relations
Next, we investigate how our three measures (cosine similarity, lag response, subregional
variation) align with the spatial relationships of the countries themselves. First, we take a high
level approach by calculating the Euclidean distance between each pair of country response vectors. Each vector is comprised of the six activity categories in each country. Three response
similarity distances are computed for each pair of country vectors. We then calculate the shortest
geographic distance between each pair of countries in our dataset.9 Using the rank correlation
approach, we computed the degree to which the geometric distance correlates with each of the
response similarity distances. Given the non-normal spatial distribution and size of countries, it
is not surprising that the results, while significant, reported very low positive Kendall’s τ values
for all three measures (cosine similarity, lag time, subregion variability).
We then explore countries based on the continent to which they belong. The average similarity distance values for each of our three measures are reported in Table 3. These values are split
by continent and also reported overall within the same continent and between countries from
different continents. In general, there is a slight difference between the average similarity distance between countries within the same continent and those between continents. The difference,
however, is less than one might expect implying, as reported by the previous correlation values,
9 Using

the PostGIS St DistanceSphere function

that the spatial distribution explains little of the variability in country responses. There are,
however, substantial differences between continents. For instance, the cosine similarity distance
of countries within South America is quite low indicating a high degree of similarity between
countries within this continent, at least as reported by their response to government policy actions. The number increases for lag response suggesting that though they responded similarly,
there was greater variety in the lag response time than in Europe, for example. This pattern is
repeated for Africa. The reverse, however, is true for Oceania though it must be noted that data
for only three countries were used in this analysis and Papua New Guinea had a significantly
different cosine similarity response than Australia and New Zealand. These numbers should be
interpreted relative to one another within the same measure, not as absolute values or compared
across measures.

Table 3: Mean distance values between countries within the same continents for each of our similarity measures (median
in parentheses). Overall averages for within the same continent and between different continents are shown in the last
two rows.

Taking a multidimensional scaling approach, we compress the cosine similarity and lag response distances (again based on vector similarity) into two dimensions in order to visually
represent the similarities and differences between the countries in a 2D plot. Figure 5 shows the
results of this approach with countries assigned colors based on continent. This figure nicely
visualizes a few important findings. The first is that there is a large cluster of countries that are
all quite similar in their place-based activity response to COVID-19 policy changes. It is difficult
to single out any one specific country but we do see a mix of countries from different continents.
Second, we can identify a number of countries that exist outside of the main cluster and many of
these countries are from the same continent, and in some cases, the same subregion within the
continent, namely Scandinavia. Last, we can observe the outliers. Our previous analysis indicated that South Korea and Japan responded very differently from many other countries, likely
due to the fact that their governments responded before the temporal analysis window of our activity dataset. We also see that South Africa and Egypt presented very different responses, both
of which have been mentioned in previous sections. While multidimensional scaling is a good
visualization tool for displaying similarity between entities such as these, we acknowledge that
it is a dimension reduction technique and so does not fully represent the nuances within the data.
Increasing the spatial resolution of our analysis, we assess the similarities in mobility responses between countries that share a border with those that do not. For our cosine similarity
measure, those countries that shared a border reported a mean similarity distance of 0.378. Those
that do not share a border reported a mean distance of 0.589. A similar difference in mean distance was found for the lag response and the subregion variation measures. In pulling apart these
distance values for each country pair, we found this to be the case in most countries but with a

few notable exceptions. For instance, through this approach, Germany is shown to be quite dissimilar from its neighbors based on cosine similarity, which mirrors what has been reported in the
media [44, 45]. The United States and Mexico were also quite dissimilar in their responses, considerably different than the United States and Canada. The most similar countries that shared a
border according to our cosine similarity measure are on the continent of South America, namely
Columbia and Venezuela, Ecuador and Peru. The largest lag difference in neighboring countries
was also identified in South America in Columbia and Panama, as well as Central American
Honduras and El Salvador. The neighboring countries that were most similar with respect to lag
response time are India and Bangladesh, with Hungary and Romania also being quite close. With
respect to the subregion variation analysis, the most similar neighboring countries were Italy and
France (also highly similar for cosine similarity) followed by the Czechia and Slovakia. The
largest variance was also found in Europe between Italy and Slovenia as well as Switzerland and
France. Figure 6 presents a visual representation of these similarities and differences through
a dendrogram based on subregional variability. Again, this is a subset of all countries where
Google published subregional activity patterns. One of the interesting things that this visualization shows is the degree to which Kenya and Nigeria (bottom two countries) are dissimilar from
all other countries. This hierarchical clustering approach suggests that should all the countries
be clustered into two groups based on their subregional variation, that Kenya and Nigeria would
make up one cluster while all other countries would be in the second cluster.

5. Correlations with other indices
The analysis thus far has focused on the relationships between government policy action, as
proxied by the stringency index, and the place-based activity response, as proxied by Google’s
location services-based community mobility patterns. In this section, we explore the relationships between the findings of our analyses, country-specific attributes, and third-party global
indices (RQ5).
5.1. Country attributes, COVID-19 cases, and deaths
One possible reason for the differences we see between countries could simply be attributed
to basic information about the country such as size and population. To further investigate this we
compute Kendall’s τ and find no significant rank correlation between our mean cosine similarities
14

and population, area, or population density. Similarly, there is no significant rank correlation
between response lag and these three variables. Turning to the variation within country results,
we do find a significant negative correlation between population and subregional variation (τ=0.243; p<0.05) indicating that as the population of a country increases the variability of activity
between regions decreases. No significant correlation was found with area or population density.
Turning our attention to the immediate discussion of COVID-19, we investigated the relationship between our computed similarity values, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases per
capita, and number of deaths due to COVID-19 per capita, by country. These values were taken
on the last date of our time window April 11, 2020. There was a positive correlation for each of
these variables with our cosine similarity measure, τ=0.181 (p<0.01) and τ=0.160 (p<0.05), respectively. Similarly, there was a negative correlation with response time lag, τ=-0.177 (p<0.01)
and τ=-0.145 (p<0.05), respectively. Finally, variation between subregions shows no significant
concordance with number of confirmed cases, but slight negative correlation (τ=0.165; p<0.1)
with number of deaths.
On this, one might reasonably ask whether the changes in people’s place-based activity were
due to increases in confirmed cases or deaths rather than government policy responses to the
disease. To address this we return to the stringency index and compare this index to the number
of confirmed cases and deaths over time by country. Given the difference in magnitude (stringency index is out of 100, while number of cases and deaths are limited only by the population
of a country), we chose to measure the rank correlation of the variables rather than the cosine
similarity. As was reported in [35], there is a strong positive correlation between cases, deaths,
and the stringency index. For our purpose, however, we find that the rank correlation between
the average activity pattern and either confirmed cases (τ=0.610) or deaths (τ=0.569), by country, is lower on average than the correlation between activity patterns and the stringency index
(τ=0.631). This slightly larger τ value suggests that a change in place-based activity patterns is
more likely a response to government intervention than to reported numbers of cases or deaths,
though the three are obviously highly correlated.
5.2. United Nations Human Development Index
Next we compared the results of our three different similarity measures with the United Nations Human Development Index (HDI). This index consists of a large, and broad range of indicators but we restricted our analysis to the top five as identified by the UN, namely HDI rank, Life
expectancy at birth, Expected years of schooling, Mean years of schooling, and Gross national
income per capita.
We found no significant correlations between the cosine similarity and any of the top HDI
indicators including overall rank. There was, however, positive correlation (τ=0.156 (p < 0.05))
between the HDI rank and our response lag measure suggesting that countries with a lower HDI
rank demonstrated a greater lag response time to government policy action. Three of the HDI indicators also correlated significantly with lag response time, namely Life expectancy at birth (τ=0.191; p <0.01), Expected years of schooling (τ=-0.145; p<0.05), and Gross National Income
per capita (τ=-0.126; p<0.1). Comparing HDI to our standard deviation of similarity between
subregions, we discovered no significant correlation with overall HDI rank or any contributing
indicators.
5.3. World Bank World Development Indicators
We next looked at a series of World Development Indicators (WDI) from the World Bank. Of
the 284 indicators that were reported by the World Bank, only five of them resulted in significant
15

(p<0.1) correlation with our cosine similarity approach. They are Financing through local equity
market, Quality of land administration, Pupil to teacher ratio in primary education, Diversity of
workforce, Hiring and firing practices. All τ values were quite low with the first three indicators
showing positive correlation and the last two being negative.
By comparison, 97 of the WDI significantly (p<0.1) correlated with our computed response
lag with 25 of them reporting high rank correlation significance (p<0.01). Of these, the most interesting, and highest correlation coefficients were found in Life Expectancy and Infant Mortality
Deaths, findings that reflect those of our comparison with the United Nations HDI indicators.
Additionally, cases of Tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS also positively correlated with lag time indicating that an increase in lag response occurred in countries with high numbers of these diseases.
Comparing WDI to our standard deviation of similarity between subregions, 53 of the WDI
significantly (p<0.1) correlated with our measure with 10 of them reporting high rank correlation
significance (p<0.01). The highest positive rank correlations were computed for Gross Domestic
Product (GDP), and Foreign and Domestic market size indicating that the larger the variance in
activity responses within a country, the larger the GDP and market sizes of the country.
5.3.1. Transparency indices
Finally, we looked at three different indices broadly related to the topic of transparency. The
first of these indices, the Corruption Perception Index, did not significantly correlate with any
of our three computed measures. Similarly, there were no significant relationships between the
World Press Freedom Index published by Reporters Without Borders. Lastly, we revisit one of
the indices published by the World Bank, namely public trust in politicians. As was reported
by omission in the World Bank section, this indicator did not significantly correlate with any
of our three measures. These findings broadly suggest that overall, trust in government and
transparency did not play a substantive role in people’s reaction to government policy.
6. Discussion & Conclusions
The purpose of the research presented in this paper is to identify the similarities and differences in how the inhabitants of different countries responded to government policies enacted
during the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this section we discuss the findings as well as
the limitations in our approach and future work. We also describe an online tool for researchers
and the public to further explore these data themselves.
In addressing our first research question, RQ1, we investigated the relationship between the
policy actions taken by national governments and the place-based activity response from people
living the countries. Through our analysis we found that there is indeed a quantifiable correlation
between the two. Using two different measures, we demonstrated that an increase in the COVID19-related policies introduced by governments lead to a decrease in the mobility and activity of
their population. We further demonstrated that the correlation between these two are greater than
the correlations with the underlying causes of the policies, namely confirmed COVID-19 cases,
and deaths. Investigating the countries themselves we found there to be significant variability
in responses from country to country suggesting that some countries have a greater ability to
actually enact envisioned policies than others.
In comparing the six different place-type activity categories (e.g., Grocery & pharmacy),
we discovered that some types of activities were more responsive to policy changes than others
(RQ2). Transit and residential-based activities were most responsive while Grocery & pharmacy
16

and Parks showed the highest degree of variability between countries. These results were supported by the findings from RQ3, namely that there is a measurable lag between policy action
and activity response. On average the lag response equated to approximately 2.4 days across
countries and activity categories, but again the Grocery & pharmacy category demonstrated the
highest degree of variability between countries. That this activity category would be the most
volatile is reasonable in that groceries and pharmacies provide essential food and medication.
While many of the activities related to the other categories could be lawfully enforced through
closures, establishments offering access to essential supplies remained open, thus permitting visits and reflected through increased activity. The Workplace category, while not as volatile as the
Grocery & pharmacy category also varied a bit between countries. In some countries we noticed
weekly patterns in the data indicating that people were still going to work in some countries, even
while the transit category remained low and residential was high. This requires further investigation but points towards the variability between country responses, equity issues, and enforcement
of policies. We also identified considerable differences in lag time from country to country. Some
countries, such as New Zealand reported virtually no lag between government policy and community response, whereas others, e.g., South Africa, demonstrated a substantial lag (mean 8.5
days). Of our three similarity measures, lag response time demonstrated the highest correlation
with global indices including development indicators such as life expectancy, GDP, and market
size.
Further to our goal of understanding the relationship between government policy and activity response, we investigated the variability of responses between subregions within countries.
Using a subset of countries for which Google reports subnational activity patterns, we calculated
the variability of responses for each subregion to the national government policies. We answered
RQ4 by showing that there are quantifiable differences in the variability of activity responses
within a country. The ranking of these countries correlated with country-level cosine similarity
and lag response values suggesting that countries who’s residents responded quickly and with
a similar degree of magnitude to the policy actions, were also more likely to respond similarly
across subregions.
In addressing our final research question, RQ5, we compared our list of countries, ordered
by our three assessment measures to a range of global indices developed and curated by leading multi-national organizations. A country’s Gross Domestic Product, Life Expectancy, and
Infant Mortality Deaths showed the highest correlations and suggest that there is a link between
peoples’ activity responses and a country’s level of development. Surprisingly, none of the transparency indices correlated with our assessment measures indicating that public trust or perceived
corruption in government had little impact on whether or not residents of a country followed their
government’s advice.
This work is not without limitations. The most notable limitation is the lack of transparency
in how the Google Community Mobility dataset was created. While this is a fantastic resource
for researchers, very little is known about the data collection methodology, sample sizes, geolocation accuracy, etc. As researchers we are working under the assumption that the data released
publicly is valid and is a representative sample of mobile device users around the world. This is
a large assumption, but one we must live with given the limited availability of COVID-19 related
activity data. Additional contextual factors may have played a role in assessing the similarity
of activity responses as well. We know weather, for instance, affects mobility and place-based
activity. As the COVID-19 pandemic spread, northern hemisphere countries were just beginning
to enter Spring which itself causes a change in activity behavior. Parks are likely the category
most impacted by this, but other activity categories may have been impacted. Similarly, the par17

tisan politics surrounding government policies and activity responses were largely ignored in this
analysis. A wide range of political hierarchies exist with many governments wielding most of
the control at the national level and others delegating health-related policy to local districts and
municipalities. Indices that report on the political underpinnings of a country would be useful to
include in future work.
6.1. Future work
As we are currently in the midst of this pandemic, there are a lot of unknowns and it is not
yet clear what the outcomes of COVID-19-related government policies, nor activity reductions
will be. Future work on this topic will extend to analyzing people’s response to relaxation of restrictive government policies and re-opening of economies. It would be interesting to determine
if residents respond to policy relaxation in similar ways. Additional datasets are being made
available everyday and many of these datasets could be used in future analysis. While we compared activity response to three different measures, namely stringency index, confirmed cases,
and deaths, more government-related response indices would be worth investigation should they
become available.
6.2. Interactive visual analytics platform
During our analyses, we developed a visual analytics platform for quickly comparing country
responses across the range of activity categories (Figure 7). We decided to share this platform
publicly with the goal of allowing the public and researchers to explore these data and relationships.

Figure 7: Interactive COVID-19 community mobility country comparison platform.

The platform ingests all place-based activity data as reported by Google, at the country level
(and subnational level when available). Users are encouraged to toggle between the different
categories and regions to compare activity responses. The platform was built using JavaScript

6.3. Conclusions
The COVID-19 pandemic will undoubtedly have a lasting impact on the global economy and
society at large. While we are racing to coming to terms with the global impact of this crisis, it
is important to investigate the early patterns emerging from the spread of this pandemic in order
to help us plan for future crises or a potential second wave of this current disease. Our focus in
this paper was on gaining a better understanding of the relationship between the actions taken
by national governments, with respect to COVID-19-related policy, and the response of their
inhabitants, specifically as it relates to their activities. We showed considerable differences exist
between countries. Three approaches were used to quantify the relationship between policy and
response. Though countries varied between measure, commonalities emerged. A number of the
similarities and differences between countries can be explained through correlations with global
indices such as market size, or life expectancy. Not surprisingly, countries that share a border
were also more similar in their activity responses. As this pandemic continues to spread and we
look towards an uncertain future, understanding how people respond to their government is an
important step in combating this crisis.
