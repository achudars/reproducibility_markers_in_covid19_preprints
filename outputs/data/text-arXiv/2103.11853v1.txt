Abstract
In this paper, we study the moral framing of political content on Twitter. Specifically, we examine differences in moral
framing in two datasets: (i) tweets from US-based politicians
annotated with political affiliation and (ii) COVID-19 related
tweets in German from followers of the leaders of the five
major Austrian political parties. Our research is based on recent work that introduces an unsupervised approach to extract framing bias and intensity in news using a dictionary
of moral virtues and vices. In this paper, we use a more extensive dictionary and adapt it to German-language tweets.
Overall, in both datasets, we observe a moral framing that is
congruent with the public perception of the political parties.
In the US dataset, democrats have a tendency to frame tweets
in terms of care, while loyalty is a characteristic frame for republicans. In the Austrian dataset, we find that the followers
of the governing conservative party emphasize care, which
is a key message and moral frame in the party’s COVID-19
campaign slogan. Our work complements existing studies on
moral framing in social media. Also, our empirical findings
provide novel insights into moral-based framing on COVID19 in Austria.

Introduction
Politicians and political campaigns increasingly use social media to connect and communicate with potential voters (Graham et al. 2013). The effectiveness of such communication is influenced by how the message is framed (Kusmanoff et al. 2020). Framing corresponds to the act of
changing the formulation of a problem to affect the choices
of people (Tversky and Kahneman 1981).
Recently, several related works focus on the characterization of frames: Walter and Ophir (2019) use topic modeling
and network analysis to identify frames in news. Shurafa,
Darwish, and Zaghouani (2020) categorize political discussions related to COVID-19 in Twitter into either blame
frames or support frames. Wicke and Bolognesi (2020) find
that the discourse around COVID-19 on Twitter is framed
using war-related terminology.
In our work, we aim to study differences in moralbased framing in content created by members and followers of opposing political parties on Twitter. We base our

approach on the work of Mokhberian et al. (2020), who
have recently introduced an unsupervised, embedding-based
method to characterize moral frames in text. Moral frames
are frames that emphasize specific moral virtues and vices,
such as care or harm. The approach of Mokhberian et al.
is grounded in the Moral Foundation Theory from the social sciences (Haidt and Joseph 2004), which defines five
basic moral foundations and their associated virtues and
vices (Haidt and Joseph 2007). Based on the theory, several
moral foundation dictionaries (Graham, Haidt, and Nosek
2009; Frimer et al. 2017) have been developed that contain
prototypical words for each moral foundation.
In this paper, we employ a similar approach to Mokhberian et al. However, while they utilize the moral foundation
dictionary by Graham, Haidt, and Nosek (2009), for our experiments, we use the more recent and more extensive dictionary by Frimer et al. (2017). Besides, we translate the
content of that moral foundation dictionary to German using
a list of sample translations of positive and negative valence
words (Weichselbaum, Leder, and Ansorge 2018) and two
sets of word embeddings, i.e., one for English and one for
German (Grave et al. 2018).
For our study, we create two Twitter datasets. The first
dataset contains tweets from US-politicians annotated with
political affiliation (democrats vs. republicans). The second
dataset contains COVID-19-related tweets from the followers of the five major Austrian political parties’ leaders in
the German language. From the tweets, we extract moral
frames corresponding to the five moral foundations, their
frame bias, i.e., the emphasis towards either virtue or vice,
and frame intensity, i.e., the extent to which a frame is used.
To study the prevalence of moral frames, we train a logistic
regression classifier to predict party affiliation and investigate its coefficients.
In both datasets, we observe a moral framing congruent
with the public perception of the political parties. In the US
dataset, high frame intensity on care and fairness are predictors for democrats, while high frame intensity on loyalty and sanctity characterise republicans. In the Austrian
dataset, we find a frame bias toward care in the COVID19-related tweets of the conservative political party leader’s
followers. We attribute this to the followers’ adoption of the
conservative COVID-19 slogan’s moral framing that stresses
caring.

Figure 1: Axis of the five moral foundations. Each axis is created by the centroid of words assigned to virtues and the centroid of
words for vices and surrounded by moral words associated with the other axes. The black arrow goes from the vices’ centroid to
the virtues’ centroid and describes the axes. The high-dimensional space is reduced with Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
All the axis point approximately in the same direction, which indicates that virtues are more similar to other virtues than to their
corresponding vices, and vice versa. A kernel density estimation of the underlying point cloud is used for the colored contours.

Characterization of Moral-based Framing
In the following, we describe our approach to investigate
moral-based differences in the framing of tweets.

Capturing Moral Frames
In our work, similar to Mokhberian et al. (2020), we capture moral frames by combining the FrameAxis approach
introduced in Kwak, An, and Ahn (2020) with a dictionary
of moral values. FrameAxis enables the quantification of
framing of a particular text using semantic axes (Kwak, An,
and Ahn 2020). It is built upon the SemAxis approach (An,
Kwak, and Ahn 2018), which defines semantic axes by the
difference of opposing word pairs using their word embeddings in the vector space. FrameAxis learns in an unsupervised way by estimating the contribution of each word towards the target axis. The contribution per word is defined
as the cosine similarity between its word embedding and the
target axis in the vector space. For all contributions of every
word in a given document, we calculate the frame bias and
frame intensity of a moral frame. The frame bias corresponds
to the mean of the contributions and the frame intensity to
the variance of the contributions in relation to the baseline
frame bias of the corpus. The latter denotes the mean of
frame biases over the whole corpus.
As a dictionary of moral values, we use the Moral Foundation Dictionary version 2 (MFD-2) (Frimer et al. 2017).
It is an extension of a moral values dictionary developed
by Graham, Haidt, and Nosek (2009) and consists of prototypical words to moral foundations. Moral foundations are
described in the moral foundation theory (MFT) as factors
that guide emotional and ethical reactions to various social
situations. MFT describes five foundations in the form of

virtues and vices: (i) care/harm, i.e., the dislike for others’
suffering, (ii) fairness/cheating, i.e., dislike of cheating, (iii)
loyalty/betrayal, i.e., loyalty, (iv) authority/subversion, i.e.,
respect for authority, and (v) sanctity/degradation, i.e., concerns with purity (Mokhberian et al. 2020).
The Moral Foundation Dictionary MFD-2 assigns words
to virtues and vices. As virtues and vices are opposing
moral values, we use them as poles to create moral frame
axes. Then, for each pole, we associate its words with word
embeddings, i.e., the 300-dimensional GloVe representation (Pennington, Socher, and Manning 2014) trained on 840
billion tokens and calculate their centroids for virtues and
vices. Each pair of virtue and vice centroid forms a semantic axis, i.e., moral frame axis, that we use for FrameAxis
instead of individual words. For each axis, we extract the
frame biases and intensities per tweet by aggregating its
words’ contributions (i.e., the cosine similarity with the axis)
towards the corresponding moral value. Please note that we
name axes using the name of the morals’ virtues in the remainder of this paper, e.g., the care axis.

Validation of Moral Frame Axes
We define four properties of the word embedding space to
investigate the validity of the moral frame axes. P1: All axes
should be close to the zero point. Note that each axis is dividing a moral space into a positive and a negative part. P1 prohibits the dominance of one pole (i.e., the pole closer to the
zero point) that could be caused by an association of an overwhelming majority of words. P2: The words associated with
a pole should be semantically closer to each other than to
words of the opposite pole. If words are added to or removed
from an axis, then P2 ensures its stability. P3: The orientation of axes should not oppose. Adherence to P3 allows the

axes to be combinable and form a meta-axis for virtues and
vices, e.g., care virtues are closer to fairness virtues than fairness vices. P4: The orientation of axes should differ in the
hyperspace. We expect the axes to be orthogonal to a certain
degree. A violation of P4, i.e., two axes are pointing directly
in the same direction, suggests that these axes likely relate
to the same concept and could be combined.
A visual analysis of the moral frame axes (see Figure 1) shows the first two principal components of word embeddings using probabilistic Principal Component Analysis
(PCA), moral frame axes, and up to three density regions for
virtues and vices using a kernel density estimation, which
has a lowest level threshold of 33%. Results indicate all the
four properties hold, e.g., all the axes point in the same direction. Due to some ambiguous words, there is some overlap
in the projected point clouds (e.g., unharmed). Furthermore,
some words (e.g., wounds) belong to both poles, i.e., virtue
and vice in the dictionary. In addition to the visual depiction,
we also perform the validation numerically1 .

Validation on Annotated Tweets
To validate our approach, we perform classification of moral
frames similar to Mokhberian et al. (2020) on the Twitter
dataset provided by Hoover et al. (2020), which is annotated
with virtues and vices. We conduct our experiments using
a logistic regression classifier with the MFD-2 dictionary.
Table 1 contains the results of this experiment, and a comparison of our results with the results of Mokhberian et al.
(2020). While we observe similar results as Mokhberian et
al., we find that the use of MFD-2 improves the F1-score on
care, fairness, and loyalty, but performs worse on authority
and sanctity. In terms of accuracy, we achieve a higher performance on care and loyalty using MFD-2, but a lower performance on fairness, authority, and sanctity. We conclude
that the classifier accurately captures moral frames in tweets.

Experiments and Results
We perform experiments on two datasets: firstly, in tweets in
the English language created by US-based politicians, which
we gathered based on the Twitter user list provided by Barberá et al. (2015), and secondly, in German-speaking tweets
that contain COVID-19 related content created by followers of the leaders of the five major Austrian parties. Our selection of datasets is motivated by their differences in contextual attributes, concretely their language (i.e., English vs.
German), topics (i.e., various topics vs. COVID-19-related
topics), account type (i.e., politicians vs. followers of top
politicians), and distribution of political parties (i.e., twoparty system in the US vs. multi-party system in Austria).

Datasets
For the US Twitter dataset, we collect the most recent tweets
of democrats and republicans using the party-associated
Twitter handles (Barberá et al. 2015). The resulting dataset
consists of 1, 388, 198 tweets, i.e., 704, 392 tweets from 243
democratic (D) and 683, 806 from 252 republican (R) accounts. We label the tweets according to the account owner’s
party affiliation.
For the Austrian Twitter dataset, we manually extract
the Twitter handles of the five major Austrian parties’ lead
politicians, i.e., @BMeinl for the liberal party (NEOS),
@WKogler for the green party (Greens), @norbertghofer for
the national-focused freedom party (FPÖ), @rendiwagner
for the social-democratic party (SPÖ), and @sebastiankurz
for the conservative people’s party (ÖVP). Then, we collect
the most recent tweets of followers and labeled each tweet
of the follower with the politician they follow. To avoid
mutual labels, we restrict our collection to users that follow only one of the five accounts. Besides, we only consider tweets that contain COVID-19 related hashtags (e.g.,
#Corona). This results in a collection of 22, 205 tweets, i.e.,
17, 230 tweets labeled with @sebastiankurz, 2, 090 labeled
with @WKogler, 1, 164 labeled with @rendiwagner, 901 labeled with @BMeinl, and 820 labeled with @norbertghofer.
We normalize the tweets in both datasets and (i.e., lowercase, removing URLs, punctuation), remove stopwords, and
apply tokenization before extracting the frame biases and intensities for training a logistic regression classifier1 .

Moral-based Framing in US-based Tweets
We group the tweets by parties and report the coefficients of
the logistic regression classifier in Table 2a. The frame biases do not deviate considerably and, in general, share the
same direction on all moral frames but on authority, which
is positive for republicans and negative for democrats. We
observe that democrats score higher in fairness and lower
in sanctity, whereas republicans score higher in the frame
bias for care and exhibit a high negative score in the frame
bias for loyalty. Concerning the frame intensities, we observe opposing and more distinct results. The frame intensity for care is much higher for democrats, and conversely,
the frame intensity for loyalty is higher for republicans. The
frame intensities on fairness and sanctity agree with their
corresponding frame biases, i.e., fairness has a higher frame

(a) Moral frames in US politics. Democrats
(D) and republicans (R) differ most in
terms of frame intensities (in bold).

(b) Moral frames in Austrian politics. Frame biases are distinct between the followers of the
party leaders, whereas intensities are very small in comparison. Minimum and maximum of
frame biases per moral are in bold. Frame bias in fairness exhibits the greatest difference.

intensity for democrats, while sanctity has a higher frame
intensity for republicans. We find that our observations are
congruent with Graham, Haidt, and Nosek (2009), i.e., liberals are predominantly associated with care and fairness.

Moral-based Framing in Austrian-based Tweets
To investigate differences in moral-based framing in the
Austrian Twitter dataset, we first translate the content of the
MFD-2 dictionary. To that end, we use a list of sample translations of positive and negative valence words (Weichselbaum, Leder, and Ansorge 2018) and two sets of word embeddings, i.e., one for English and one for German (Grave
et al. 2018). Using a translation matrix estimated from the
valance word translations, we translate the words of the
MFD-2 to similar words in German in terms of their word
embeddings. We see that the top words seem to be congruent
with the moral values, e.g., top translation of authority being
Befehl – command, but also observe words of opposite moral
values in their vicinity, e.g., harm having Schadenfreude –
malicious joy as the second, and Freude – joy and third nearest neighbor. Such inconsistencies are expected since we
previously established that some words are neither clearly
associated with virtues nor vices.
Then, we group the tweets by followers of Austrian party
leaders and report the coefficients of the logistic regression classifier in Table 2b. We find substantial differences
in frame biases between the tweets of the groups, but not
in their frame intensities. The reported frame biases reaffirm the parties’ public perception, with fairness having a
stronger association with left parties (with @WKogler followers being the highest), while sanctity is predominantly
associating with right parties (i.e., the highest for @norbertghofer followers). Noteworthy, the followers of @sebastiankurz have the lowest association with fairness, which
might indicate a contention point between the viewpoints
of the governing coalition, i.e., the ÖVP (@sebastiankurz)
and Greens (@WKogler). Moreover, the results show that
@sebastiankurz followers are mostly associated with care, a
moral frame that is prevalent in the government’s COVID-19

information campaign through the slogan ”Schau auf dich schau auf mich”, which translates to ”take care of you - take
care of me”. Followers of @rendiwagner, who is also a scientist and epidemiologist, are associated with authority. We
suspect that is the result of her emphasizing to listen to doctors and experts. For followers of @BMeinl, all frame biases
are negative, which we relate to the party being an opposition party arguing against government COVID-19 policies.
In summary, we find differences in the moral framing of the
tweets on COVID-19 of the followers of the party leaders
that reflect the ideology and messages of the corresponding
political parties.

Conclusion
In conclusion, our experimental results show that the moral
framing in the tweets of US-based politicians and the tweets
of the followers of Austrian politicians is congruent with the
public perception of the political parties. In the tweets from
US-based politicians, we find that democrats are associated
with high frame intensity in care and fairness, whereas high
frame intensity in loyalty and sanctity is associated with
republicans. In the tweets from followers of the five major Austrian parties’ leaders, we find that high frame bias
in fairness is mostly associated with followers of the green
party’s leader, while high frame bias in sanctity predominantly indicates followers of the freedom party’s leader.
Besides, we find that followers of the ruling conservative
party’s leader have a notable frame bias towards care in
the case of COVID-19-related tweets. We attribute this to
the followers’ adoption of the framing of the conservative
COVID-19 slogan that stresses caring. From a methodological perspective, our experiments show that the use of the
extended moral foundations dictionary MFD-2 increases the
accuracy of moral frame characterization.
We recognize several limitations of our work: our analysis is restricted to two specific political Twitter datasets.
We chose these datasets, as the interpretation of results requires the researchers’ domain understanding and language
skills. Through making a validity analysis of the approach,

we aimed to mitigate the potential impact of constraints.
Also, since we did not filter out retweets, 63 tweets in the
Austrian dataset are from the political party leaders.
For future work, we aim to research the interplay of frame
bias and intensity in more detail. We will also study how
followers engage with moral frames shared by politicians
and if they are more prevalent in retweets or comments.
