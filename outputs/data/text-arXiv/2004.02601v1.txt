A BSTRACT
We present a compartmental SEIAR model of epidemic spread as a generalization of the SEIR
model. We believe that the asymptomatic infectious cohort is an omitted part of the understanding
of the epidemic dynamics of disease COVID-19. We introduce and derive the basic reproduction
number as the weighted arithmetic mean of the basic reproduction numbers of the symptomatic and
asymptomatic cohorts. Since the asymptomatic subjects people are not detected, they can spread the
disease much longer, and this increases the COVID-19 R0 up to around 9. We show that European
epidemic outbreaks in various European countries correspond to the simulations with commonly
used parameters based on clinical characteristics of the disease COVID-19, but R0 is around three
times bigger if the asymptomatic cohort is taken into account. Many voices in the academic world
are drawing attention to the asymptomatic group of infectious subjects at present. We are convinced
that the asymptomatic cohort plays a crucial role in the spread of the COVID-19 disease, and it has to
be understood during government measures.

Introduction

We started modeling the Wuhan COVID-19 outbreak with the standard SEIR model with WHO premised basic
reproduction number R0 between 2 and 3, the incubation period around 5 days, and the serial time around a week
using GLEAMviz network simulator that includes populations, traffic, and measures. Soon we realized, the simulation
predicts outbreaks in European countries too late. The outbreaks fitted better for R0 much higher than it is generally
considered. Afterwards, serious outbreaks in Italy, Spain, UK, and the US happened very quickly. The paper [1]
appeared in Science, estimating 86% of undocumented infectious (published 16.3.2020). Padova University recently
informed about an experiment in town Vò, where areal testing showed that the majority of the positive 3% of citizens
were asymptomatic at the beginning of the outbreak. We made a hypothesis that the asymptomatic cohort can play a
crucial role. This could also be a clue to understanding why early enough closing school policy contributes to slow
down the outbreak. We propose a model that counts in with this asymptomatic infectious cohort, and we derive its basic
reproduction number R0 . We proved that the basic reproduction number is a weighted average of reproduction numbers
of both the symptomatic and asymptomatic cohorts, which seems to be very intuitive. On the other hand, this implies
that in case of a disease with the majority of asymptomatic cases, this basic reproduction number R0 is much higher
than the one gained from standard estimates based only on the symptomatic cohort. This can explain the "invisible" and
fast increase in COVID-19 outbreaks since it also acts through the asymptomatic cohort. There are already studies that

estimate R0 higher than WHO proposed (for example, Diamond Princess estimate 14.8 at [2]). Probably we can see
just the tip of the iceberg. The consequences are very important since it gives a much shorter time to governments. Late
measures have almost no effect.

SEIAR model and the basic reproduction number

We propose a simple model that generalizes the SEIR model commonly used for virus disease modeling. The total
population is partitioned into the following compartments: S, Susceptible; E, Exposed; I, Infected (symptomatic
infected); A, Asymptomatic (asymptomatic infected); R, Removed (healed or dead, no more infectious).

(3)

(5)

where parameter β denotes the transmission rate (i.e., the probability of disease transmission in a single contact
times the average number of contacts per person) due to contacts between a Susceptible subject and an Infected or
an Asymptomatic subject2 . Parameter β can be modified by quarantine government measures that increase social
distancing as closing schools, remote working, using masks, or similar. Parameter γ usually denotes the probability rate
at which the Exposed subject develops clinically relevant symptoms. The period 1/γ (days−1 ) is called an incubation
period. In the case of COVID-19, it is known that an Exposed subject is infectious one or two days before developing
symptoms, and so we will define the Exposed compartment as a latent non-infectious compartment. Due to this, we
assume that the period 1/γ is shorter than usually estimated (see [3], [4]). We assume that every Exposed subject
becomes infectious, but subjects that enter I cohort later develop symptoms with probability p and those who not enter
A cohort with probability 1 − p. This assumption is based on recent studies [1] and experiments in the Italian town
Vò. Parameters µ1 or µ2 , respectively, denote the remove rate, so µ11 is the average period to isolation for Infected
symptomatic subjects, and µ12 is the average recovery period for Asymptomatic subjects. We assume that µ12 > µ11 ,
since the COVID-19 patients are treated or isolated very quickly after developing symptoms. We omit the probability
rate of becoming susceptible again after recovery, although this is not evident (mainly for Asymptomatic subjects). We
assume S + I + E + A + R = 1 (a non-dimensionalized model with a constant incidence rate).

Unstability of the non-epidemic equilibrium – outbreak

The non-epidemic equilibrium of the system (1), (2), (3),(4) (we can separate independent equation (5)) is obviously
(1, 0, 0, 0). The Jacobian linearization matrix of the system (1), (2), (3),(4) is

The model can be improved by incorporating different transmission rates for cohorts I and A as βI and βA , respectively. It is
difficult to compare them since, on one side, people tend to avoid contact with subjects showing symptoms, but on the other side, an
asymptomatic subject is less infectious more probably. Due to this dichotomy, we use one the mean β.

p(λ) = λ3 + (γ + µ1 + µ2 ) λ2 + (−β γ + γ µ1 + γ µ2 + µ1 µ2 ) λ + β γ pµ1 − β γ pµ2 − β γ µ1 + γ µ1 µ2

implies negative real parts of all the eigenvalues of the matrix A. The condition (7) is satisfied always. Violation of the
condition (8) implies that at least one eigenvalue has positive real part. The condition (8) can be equivalently rewritten
as

R0 :=

and so the left-hand side as a weighted average of reproduction numbers of both the symptomatic and asymptomatic
cohorts can be defined as R0 . If R0 > 1 the epidemic outbreaks. Since the infectious period 1/µ2 of an Asymptomatic
subject is much longer than the infectious period 1/µ1 of a symptomatic Infectious subject, and 1 − p is majority
percentage for the COVID-19 disease, the derived R0 is much higher than the one estimated using SEIR model ([5], [6],
[7]). Violation of the condition (9) give birth to an unstable focus (two complex eigenvalues cross the imaginary axes).

Case Study: Numerical results for the COVID-19 Outbreak

We do not aim here to fit and predict the curve of the infected. We are trying to explain that the principal difference
between SEIR and SEIAR models leads to principally different outcomes in for example times and rates of outbreaks, a
percentage of the population affected. It also has implications for state measures that are being introduced to keep the
disease contained and controlled under health system capacity.
For commonly used parameters of COVID-19 β = 1, γ = 1/4, µ1 = 1/3, µ2 = 1/10 and p = 0.14 (see [8], [5], [6],
.
[7], [4]) we get R0 = 9 > 1 from (10). Condition (9) is satisfied.

Figure 1: Dynamics of the model (1), (2), (3),(4). The peak time tp = 48, a proportion of infectious in the population
in the peak I (48) = 0.0268.
Figure 1 shows the disease dynamics in case that no strong restrictions are held (without social distancing and other
measures except hospitalization or isolated home treatment). The health system has to contain around 2.7% of Infected

symptomatic population at once3 at the moment of the peak (day 48 from the first Infected subject in a million
population). Commonly, 20% of symptomatic Infected subjects are hospitalized, and 10% need intensive care ([9]).
That is 0.27% of the whole population. 60% decrease of β (e.g., mask protection in the whole population) causes the
peak to be halved in approximately doubled time. SEIR model without the Asymptomatic cohort gives five times higher
and about 3 weeks later peak values (for β = 1), which seems to be very different from the actual dynamics of the
disease COVID-19.
2.3

GLEAMviz simulation of COVID-19 pandemic

The GLEAMviz simulation software is a platform that gives a possibility to simulate the global pandemic on a network
background. The Global Epidemic and Mobility Model (GLEAM) is a stochastic computational model that integrates
high-resolution demographic and mobility data and uses a compartmental approach to define the epidemic characteristics
of the infectious disease [10]. We simulated the pandemic starting in Wu-Han on the 1st of December using SEIAR
model with parameters β = 1, γ = 1/4, µ1 = 1/3, µ2 = 1/10 and p = 0.14 and an exception that β = 0.3 from
20/01/2020 in the whole China (Figure 2). The outbreaks in Europe fit in time, unlike the much later onsets of the
epidemics in case of using the SEIR model. Simulation-based on SEIAR showed good times of local epidemic outbreaks
in Wu-Han, Italy, Germany, Czech Republic, and others (with differences in days, Figure 3) and much closer proportion
of infected in a population (difference in the order). Due to the gradual cancellation of flights, air traffic slowed down,
so we cannot simulate the real situation. Possibility to decrease air traffic during simulations could be a good software
improvement.

Efficiency of quarantine government measures with respect to the time of their
introduction

One important information that governments need is to estimate the efficiency of introduced measures. For the SEIAR
model, we will show the dependence of the peak height on the time of the introduction of quarantine and social measures
that affect transmission rate β. It turns out that there is a time threshold for the introduction of quarantine and social

Ten times new confirmed cases

Figure 3: COVID-19 outbreak without European protective measures in GLEAMviz based on the model (1), (2), (3),(4)
with parameters β = 1, γ = 1/4, µ1 = 1/3, µ2 = 1/10 and p = 0.14 – a comparison for Czech Republic new daily
confirmed cases data set ([11]). Transmission rate β is decreased to 0.3 from 20/1/2020 for the whole China. Air traffic
and local traffic is not decreased, there is no decrease of R0 due to government measures in Europe, so the simulation
fails after 20/03/2020 (around a week after first measures). Real data are 10 times lower (that could be due to the
lack of testing at the beginning of the outbreak and undetected mild symptomatic cases) and delayed 16 days (due to
the incubation period, developing symptoms period and testing period, plus possible time for undetected first cases).
Simulation for SEIR model with the same parameters (p = 1, R0 = 3) moves the outbreak more than a month later,
and the infected cohort is more than five times bigger. This is evidence of the unsuitability of models without the
asymptomatic infectious cohort since the parameters are based on clinical characteristics of the disease (commonly
used, [8], [5], [6], [7], [4]).
measures for both SEIR and SEIAR models4 . Early measures lead to a significant reduction of the epidemic peak,
whereas after a certain threshold, the epidemic peak cannot be significantly affected.
We will show this threshold for parameters β = 1, γ = 1/4, µ1 = 1/3, µ2 = 1/10 and p = 0.14 used above . Figure
4 shows how the dynamics of the system change abruptly as β reduction from 1 to 0.3 is introduced at times t = 30
and t = 40. We have to highlight the fact that the time t = 30 is counted from the first Infected subject in a million
population, but due to delay (the incubation period, few more days of asymptomatic disease, test duration to confirm
positivity) first COVID-19 patients in a new country were confirmed after around 10 days.
3.1

Existence of a threshold

Depending on the time of the introduction of government measures that reduce β, we can draw the peak of the epidemic.
The heatmap 5 may serve to gain a good insight into the effectiveness of government measures in terms of time and

Figure 4: β reduction from 1 to 0.3 is introduced at times t = 30 and t = 40. For t = 30 the peak time tp = 73, a
proportion of infectious in the population in the peak I (48) = 0.0091. For t = 40 the peak time tp = 47, a proportion
of infectious in the population in the peak I (48) = 0.0130.

strength. It displays a steep growth that is almost beta independent. This property is not exceptional for taken parameter
values, but it is a generic behavior.
This could imply that countries that took action quickly (not later than 20-25 days from the first confirms) are probably
on a good way to contain the outbreak. On the other hand, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, UK (with a lack of testing) or the
US at highly populated areas face a sharp increase in the infected since the measures were introduced too late (this is of
course not true for local areas with later outbreaks, where measures took place early enough).
3.2

Efficiency threshold estimation

It is challenging to estimate the efficiency of measures threshold during an ongoing outbreak. It is not possible to
compare the time of the introduction of measures with the time of epidemic peak because we do not know it. A possible
approach could be to compare the time of the fastest growth (denoted as Phase 2) with the time of introduction of
measures.
Figure 6 shows the possibility to efficiently contain the outbreak by quarantine, social distancing, mask-wearing, and
other government measures that decrease transmission rate β for various original R0 (β respectively). The dashed line
indicates the outbreak of the epidemic (the maximal steep), the dotted line is the peak time. The threshold is orange,
but the measures have to be introduced a few days before it. Again, parameters γ = 1/4, µ1 = 1/3, µ2 = 1/10 with
p = 0.14 are used. Figure 7 shows the quarantine efficiency as decrease of infected in peak (proportion of population)
for various original R0 . Each column is labeled with a percentage that shows a relative difference with respect to the
peak of the epidemic without a quarantine.

Conclusion

We presented a compartmental model of epidemic spread, which is a generalization of the SEIR model by adding
an asymptomatic infectious cohort. The derived basic reproduction number is the weighted arithmetic mean of the
basic reproduction numbers of the symptomatic and asymptomatic cohorts. In a limit case (for an empty asymptomatic
cohort), the SEIAR model is the SEIR model with standard R0 . This model was developed based on studies and clinical
characteristics of COVID-19, but can be used, for example, to model the dynamics of the H1N1 influenza epidemic and
other human-to-human transmission diseases.

infection started). Days are shown from day 9, which is an estimation of a start of the phase 2 (outbreak). In case of two
peaks of the epidemic, it displays the first peak.

We are convinced that model SEIAR is the most simple model that can be used to simulate the epidemic dynamics of
COVID-19. The standard SEIR model without an asymptomatic cohort does not match existing data, while the SEIAR
model does quite well. Moreover, the onset of epidemics in different European countries corresponds to the simulations
in GLEAMviz. The extremely rapid outbreaks in Italy and other countries, the functionality of only extreme measures,
and the failure of measures that tried to protect and isolate only vulnerable groups are indirect supports for the suitability
of the SEIAR model. Voices in the academic world are drawing attention to the asymptomatic group of infectious
subjects. We are convinced that the asymptomatic cohort plays a crucial role in the spread of the COVID-19 disease.
The graph 5 indicates that all measures need to be taken early and vigorously to be effective. Late or insufficient measures
have little effect on the outbreak. All measures have economic, social, logistical, and psychological consequences.
Their balance is up to the authorities.
