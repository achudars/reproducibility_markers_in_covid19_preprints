Abstract

The global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has followed complex pathways, largely attributed
to the high virus infectivity, human travel patterns, and the implementation of multiple mitigation
measures. The resulting geographic patterns describe the evolution of the epidemic and can
indicate areas which are at risk of an outbreak. Here, we analyze the spatial correlations of new
active cases in USA at the county level and characterize the extent of these correlations at different
times. We show that the epidemic did not progress uniformly and we identify various stages which
are distinguished by significant differences in the correlation length. Our results indicate that the
correlation length may be large even during periods when the number of cases declines. We find
that correlations between urban centers were much more significant than between rural areas and
this finding indicates that long-range spreading was mainly facilitated by travel between cities,
especially at the first months of the epidemic. We also show the existence of a percolation
transition in November 2020, when the largest part of the country was connected to a spanning
cluster, and a smaller-scale transition in January 2021, with both times corresponding to the peak
of the epidemic in the country.

INTRODUCTION
The high infection rate of COVID-19 1, combined with modern society behavioral patterns and a
high volume of travel 2, enabled the rapid spreading of the virus globally 3. The COVID-19
pandemic is among the few examples of an infectious disease which spread widely in a relatively
short amount of time and whose evolution was closely monitored and documented 4, 5. In the
absence of restriction measures, the entire population would have been exposed to the virus
resulting to a much higher number of active cases and consequently deaths. Many measures have
been implemented at different countries and most of them target to limiting contacts between large
number of people 6 and limiting travel over large distances 7. These measures include travel
restrictions, quarantine, social distancing, lockdowns, curfews, and others 8. Such restrictions have
led to a varying degree of success which is difficult to estimate since individuals may not have
followed state directives or the measures may have been inadequate 9. However, it is clear that
these mitigation measures have had a significant impact on the evolution of the pandemic and that
the geographical spreading would have been very different if the virus was left to spread
uncontrolled within the population 10.
The special features of this virus and the unprecedented global response present potentially novel
paths of disease transmission that have not been observed in modern times 11. The combination of
these transmission paths manifests itself as the number of new active cases over a region of interest,
e.g. a county in USA, and these numbers are reported daily. The geographical arrangement of
variables such as the number of new cases gives rise to larger scale spatial patterns which span
broader areas on the map. The analysis of these patterns and their pertinent features can provide
important information on the extent of the epidemic at a given time and areas which may be at
higher risk of an outbreak. In practice, it is possible to identify geographical clusters whose
connectivity is based on similar local levels of infections or similar trends in the local progress of
infection 12. We can then assess how these clusters evolve with time, e.g. in terms of their size and
persistence.
Here, we suggest that the use of spatial correlation statistics and cluster analysis of spreading
indicators can provide valuable information on the extent of spatial spreading and how spatial
correlations arose within and between geographical areas. Similar approaches have been shown to
be very successful in other contexts of spreading 13, 14, where they have provided important results
and insight in problems related to spatial epidemics.
We find that during the one year of spreading from February 2020 to February 2021, when
vaccinations started becoming widely available, there were three main phases in terms of spatial
spreading, which can be roughly described as localized, dormant, and system-wide outbreak.
Interestingly, if we consider the whole country to represent one system, then these three phases
can be compared to the progression of a disease in an individual, moving from an acute infection
to false recovery to severe illness. In spring 2020 (the localized, acute phase), spreading was
contained within small clusters and there were only a few local outbreaks mainly located in the
Northeast. From May 2020 to October 2020, (the incubation phase) correlations in new active
cases were weaker across the country but at the same time the underlying clusters started growing
in size while still remaining mostly localized in space. November 2020 marks the beginning of the
2

third stage (the system-wide outbreak phase), when correlations spanned the largest part of the
country as these clusters merged. Even though this spanning cluster dissolved in less than a month,
correlations remained strong for the rest of this time interval indicating that virus transmission
could still increase at a fast pace.
It is also noteworthy that correlations among neighboring urban centers remained strong
throughout this year. On the contrary, until November 2020 there were only weak or no
correlations between rural areas, even for counties which are geographically close to each other.
After November 2020, these correlations increased in strength and became comparable to those
between urban counties. This behavior can also explain the percolation transition to a cluster
spanning the largest part of the country at that time.

METHOD
We analyze COVID-related data for USA at the county level using the Johns Hopkins dataset 5, 15.
The main quantity we study is the number of new COVID cases. We use a 7-day window in order
to alleviate problems with inconsistent data reporting, such as weekend vs weekday testing
patterns. Starting on February 1 2020, we aggregate the total number of newly infected cases in a
given county over the past 7 days (including the given day) and calculate the daily average during
this time period. We then convert this number to the average daily fraction of the population in
each county that was infected during this week by dividing with the county population. In short, if
zt(i) denotes the number of new cases in county i on day t, then for week T we calculate the fraction
ZT(i) as:

𝑍𝑇 (𝑖) ≡

1
7 𝑝𝑖

∑7𝑇
𝑡=7𝑇−6 𝑧𝑡 (𝑖)

(1)

where pi is the county population. We remove 697 counties with population less than 10000
because a small change in the number of cases in a small population can lead to large fluctuations,
which results to a total of 2411 counties in our calculations. In this way, we create weekly maps
for the infection rates of each county Zt(i) for the time period from February 1, 2020 to February
1, 2021. Some of the resulting maps are shown in Figure 1a. As expected, these maps indicate that
the spatial coverage of the virus is not uniform but incidents are geographically clustered. These
clusters change significantly with time, both in terms of their size and location. Our main goal here
is to quantify these clusters through a spatial correlation analysis 16, so that we can detect the
evolution of spreading and the impact of restriction measures.
We start by detrending the data for the correlation analysis. We use the differences method 17 where
we consider the difference of Z between two consecutive weeks T and T-1, i.e. XT(i)=ZT(i)= ZT(i)ZT-1(i). In practice, XT(i) measures the extent to which the relative number of cases increased or
decreased on a given week compared to the previous week. We consider the equal-time two-point
correlation function on week T, CT(r), which is the average of the correlation of XT over all counties
at distance r, as measured between the centroids of two counties:
1

∑𝑁(𝒓) 𝑋𝑇 (𝒔)𝑋𝑇 (𝒔+𝒓)−𝑚𝑇,𝑠 𝑚𝑇,𝑠+𝑟

𝑁(𝒓)|

2 𝜎2
√𝜎𝑇,𝑠
𝑇,𝑠+𝒓

𝐶𝑇 (𝑟) ≡ |

3

, (2)

where the average values m and variances  are defined below. There is no explicit dependence
on time in this calculation and we calculate the spatial correlation using information only of a
given snapshot in time and subsequently analyze these correlations at different times. For this
calculation we consider the vector from a site s (as represented by the geographical coordinates of
a county centroid) to all the centroids lying at a circle s+r of radius r=|r|. Because of the natural
inhomogeneity in the geographical distribution of the counties, in practice there are not any
counties at an exact distance r and we use all data values within the neighborhood of r. Therefore,
in the above formula N(r) represents the set of pairwise distances between counties which are
within a distance [r-dr,r+dr] from each other. In practice, we bin the distances logarithmically, so
that dr increases by a factor 1.05 between successive bins after fixing the first bin in the range
[0km,75km]. The average values 𝑚 𝑇,𝑠 = ∑𝑁(𝒓) 𝑋𝑇 (𝒔)/|𝑁(𝒓)| and 𝑚 𝑇,𝑠+𝑟 = ∑𝑁(𝒓) 𝑋𝑇 (𝒔 + 𝒓)/
|𝑁(𝒓)| are calculated at the origin and the end of the vectors respectively. Similarly, the variances
2
2
2
of these distributions are given by 𝜎𝑇,𝑠
= ∑𝑁(𝒓)(𝑋𝑇 (𝒔) − 𝑚 𝑇,𝑠 ) /|𝑁(𝒓)| and 𝜎𝑇,𝑠
=
2

∑𝑁(𝒓)(𝑋𝑇 (𝒔 + 𝒓) − 𝑚 𝑇,𝑠+𝑟 ) /|𝑁(𝒓)|. The set of points s includes all counties in the area that we
study. For example, in country-wide calculations s includes all the counties and since each county
is counted as both an origin and an end of the vector, the two distributions XT(s) and XT(s+r) are
identical. When we focus on a smaller area, such as a region or a state, then the set s includes only
counties within this region while the set s+r includes points which may lie outside this region and
therefore these two distributions are not necessarily the same.
The function CT(r) in Eq. (2) is an indicator of how correlation decays with distance on week T as
we move away from a given point in space 18. The correlation length, , is then defined as the
minimum distance where this function assumes a value of 0, i.e. CT()=0 19. Long-range
correlations are manifested by a large correlation length, while  vanishes for a random
distribution. In the context of an epidemic process, long-range correlations are a hallmark of virus
transmission through travel between distant places 20. If travel was severely limited and people
could only interact locally then the evolution of the disease at different areas would be largely
independent of each other which would be manifested by weak correlations and small correlation
lengths.

RESULTS
The evolution of the COVID epidemic has been highly inhomogeneous and did not follow spatial
and temporal patterns of typical infectious diseases 21. The implementation of quarantine and other
travel restriction measures at relatively early stages of the outbreak resulted in the general absence
of infected clusters persistently spanning a significant fraction of the country 22. To study the extent
of these areas we calculate the correlation function C(r) as a function of the distance r at different
times, where the set s in Eq. (2) includes the 2411 counties with population greater than 10000
people. As expected, correlation values start at C(0)=1 and decay to 0, which also defines the
correlation length  as the shortest distance where C(r)=0. In Fig. 2a we calculate C(r) for the first
week of each month from March 2020 to February 2021. It is obvious that correlation varies
significantly over time, both in terms of the local correlation strength at small distances (typically
less than 100km) and in terms of the correlation length. In Fig. 2b we focus on some of the strongest
4

correlations and use double-logarithmic axes to highlight their different behavior. For example,
during July 2020 the local correlations are weak but persist over a distance of 800km, while in
April 2020 the local correlations were much stronger and decayed faster with a correlation length
of 400km.
We found that the epidemic patterns changed significantly over time, as shown in Fig. 2c where
we isolate four C(r) curves per plot for clarity. In the first phase of the epidemic, from March to
June 2020, correlations fluctuated around zero with the striking exception of April when local
correlations were strong and decayed fast. Local correlations were higher in the next time interval,
from July to October 2020, but remained relatively weak. However, the correlation length
increased significantly during this time. While the relatively low infection numbers during summer
seemingly suggest that the country is “recovering” from the pandemic, the increasing correlation
length tells us the opposite - that the virus is silently taking root everywhere, which will lead to
the eventual outbreak in the next phase. This indicates that the correlation length is not just a
different way to look at the raw numbers but can reveal underlying phenomena that can serve as
warning signs to policymakers not to relax restrictions too early. Indeed, during the next phase of
the epidemic, from November 2020 to February 2021, the local correlations increased significantly
and the correlation length remained relatively large. In a fast-spreading epidemic, the expectation
is that correlations become strong and extend over long distances, especially if they are facilitated
by long-range travel 23. Here, we see that after an initial peak in April 2020, it took many months
for correlations to increase and to remain strong over a long period of time.
Importantly, these curves are averages over all US counties but the evolution of the epidemic may
be different at different regions of the country. In Fig. 2d we calculate correlations in each of the
four Census Bureau-designated regions, i.e. Northeast, Midwest, South, and West 24. In the
examples shown, local correlations and correlation lengths vary quite significantly in different
regions and while Northeast dominates in May, the West exhibits much stronger correlations in
August.
The evolution of the C(r) curves carries a lot of information and we need some way to probe this
information and compare different instances in time. If the functional form remained the same
throughout this process then we could compare any parameters that would appear in a model that
could describe the evolution (for example, if these curves could be described by a power-law we
could compare the power-law exponents). As can be seen in the various plots of Fig. 2, the
dependence of C(r) on r cannot be described by the same form. For example, in Fig. 2b some
curves can be described by a modified power-law while others are fitted better by an exponential
form, but there is not a uniform description over the entire time interval. Therefore, we choose to
characterize this behavior by comparing both the strength of ‘local’ correlations, i.e. the value of
C(r) at small distances around 50km, and the spatial extent of correlations through the value of the
correlation length. In a sense, these two parameters capture the basic trends that we are interested
in these plots: all curves decay from a given value at C(r<50km) down to C()=. Even though we
lose the exact form of the decay, these two points define in very broad terms the extent and strength
of the correlation function and here we are not concerned about the curvature of the line in the
intermediate regime. The combination of these two parameters can already inform on whether
5

counties tend to belong to large clusters and whether the influence within these clusters is strong
or weak.
So, how do we characterize the COVID evolution to determine if spreading expands
geographically or if it shrinks? As discussed above, the correlation length itself is important but is
not fully adequate. Even if ξ is large, it is possible that correlations in shorter distances could be
weak and, as a result, less influential. In Fig. 3a we plot the correlation function continuously from
Feb 1, 2020 to Feb 1, 2021 in weekly increments. The correlation length is marked as the distance
where C(r) becomes zero on each week. The correlation length fluctuates significantly but we can
distinguish two peaks in April and July, followed by a rather constant high value from October to
January. Time periods with stronger local correlations are identified by red color. Even though
many of the correlation values may seem small, these are averages over the entire country where
spreading may be very inhomogeneous.
The consideration of these two parameters allows us to plot the ‘trajectory’ of the epidemic in a
phase space of C(r<50km) and ξ (Fig. 3b), where we plot these two quantities continuously for
different points in time. To conceptualize this plot we can split the phase space into four quadrants.
When C(r) is small, i.e. at the bottom quadrants, then correlations are weak. The large correlation
lengths found at the quadrants at the right, indicate that epidemic can spread easily across large
distances. From the diagram in Fig. 3a we can see that in April 2020 there was a significant increase
in local correlation strength but correlation length was still relatively small. The trajectory returned
close to the origin (indicating a random distribution of cases) until the end of summer, when both
the intensity and length increased significantly. The trajectory has remained at the area of the upper
right quadrant from October 2020 until the end of the year, which indicates extended correlations
over space. Starting in January 2021, both the correlation length and the correlation strength
decreased considerably, with an abrupt increase of C(r<50km) at the beginning of February 2021.
These trajectories can shed light on the different evolution of spreading in different areas of the
country (Fig. 3c). For example, the correlation length in Northeast has remained relatively short
(this region is also the smallest) but the local correlation strength increased significantly in April
2020 and January 2021. This shows that at the early stages of the epidemic there was a strong
cluster in this area but it remained localized. In contrast to that, the correlation length in the West
was consistently large since June 2020, with spikes of the intensity between September 2020 and
January 2021. The behavior in the Midwest was also different. The trajectory there remained close
to the origin from the beginning until October 2020 when both the intensity and correlation length
increased. Notice that in all regions the correlation length in November 2021 grew larger, which
is an indication that local clusters joined into a larger cluster spanning the majority of the country.
In typical epidemic processes, it is expected that correlations are higher in areas geographically
close to each other, since the main method of transmission is close contact between individuals 25.
Travel represents another important mechanism which contributes to long-range correlations,
where now the underlying mechanism is the direct transfer of the virus over a large distance
through air or ground travel 26. To determine the contribution of travel we calculated the correlation
as a function of the distance in the case of urban areas vs rural areas. Here, we set an arbitrary
criterion for an urban county as one with population larger than 250,000 people and a rural county
6

with population less than that. Using this threshold, there are 273 urban and 2138 rural counties.
We then calculate the correlation function for the new active cases between urban counties only,
between rural counties, or between rural and urban. In Fig. 4a, we plot C(r) for these three cases
for the week of May 1, 2020. There are practically no correlations between rural areas even for
short distances and there is only weak correlation between rural and urban areas, and this is true
only for short distances. In contrast, correlations between urban places are much higher for
distances up to roughly 300km. This is an important observation because at that time air travel was
severely limited and passengers were heavily screened, while car transportation was not restricted.
Therefore, there are two possible explanations. Assuming that the first significant center of the
epidemic was located in the urban NYC area, either virus transmission was facilitated through car
transportation from city to city or the city lifestyle made the virus spread easier in an urban
environment and cities presented similar behavior independently of each other. Interestingly, in
Fig. 4a correlations between urban places that are farther than 300km become largely uncorrelated,
which favors the idea of local transmission through ground transportation.
Similar results were obtained at other times, such as in August 2020 shown in Fig. 4b, when the
difference between cities and city-rural areas was more pronounced. Correlations between urban
counties remained stronger. However, travel had increased during summer and the restriction
measures were relaxed, which in the plot is manifested by smaller peaks at 300km and 600km. In
January 2021 (Fig. 4c), the differences vanished and correlations were practically independent on
the urban character of the counties. At that time, the correlation length increased to 800km
indicating again a global outbreak covering the largest part of the country.
To explore the time evolution of these observations we calculated the average correlation <C(r)>
for the three cases (urban-urban, urban-rural, and rural-rural) over three distance intervals,
r<250km (Fig. 4d), 250km<r<1000km (Fig. 4e), and r>1000km (Fig. 4f). When we consider short
distances the correlation between urban areas is consistently higher than in the other two cases. In
fact, from February to October 2020 the spreading in rural areas was uncorrelated when rural areas
were involved which shows that the epidemic was largely contained in urban environments. After
October 2020, correlations became stronger in all cases for short distances, and the behavior was
consistent independently of the rural or urban character of the area.
In the case of intermediate distances (Fig. 4e) the value of <C(r)> mostly fluctuates around 0 with
a small peak of inter-city correlations from June to August 2020. This plot supports the idea of
ground transportation transmission since long road trips are much more rare than local road trips
and in these distances air travel is typically the preferred mode of transportation. For distances
longer than 1000km, the inter-city correlations are consistently zero or weakly anti-correlated. This
shows that not only spreading in the west coast was different than in the east coast but in general
they had opposite trends (notice that these are averages over the entire country and it is possible
that locally correlations may be much stronger or weaker than these averages).
As shown above, in November the average correlation length for the entire country was of the
order of 800-1000km which is comparable to the size of the system. For reference, a 1000kmradius circle centered in the middle of the continental US would cover roughly half of the country

7

(the distance from New York to Los Angeles is around 4000 km). This is a strong indication of a
widespread epidemic which approaches the percolation threshold.
To determine how close the epidemic came to percolating throughout the country and when this
happened we performed a clustering analysis 27. For a given point in time, we consider all clusters
created by connected counties whose weekly difference ZT(i) exceeds a given threshold. We
create two types of clusters, depending on whether these differences are positive or negative.
Positive clusters are areas where the epidemic has increased significantly over the past week and
negative clusters are areas where it decreased. We determine the size of a cluster by the total
geographic area covered by the counties that comprise this cluster. Fig. 5a shows that the largest
clusters were relatively small and localized until September 2020, which was followed by a rapid
increase in the size of the positive cluster which within two months covered an area of around
4.5x106 km2 (the total area of the 48 contiguous states is roughly 8x106 km2). This cluster was
dissolved within two weeks and its size remained small with an exception of a smaller peak during
January 2021. The size of the negative cluster remained small until after the large positive cluster
was formed in November 2020. It is interesting that the two processes of positive or negative
change above a given threshold are not completely synchronized and cannot fully explain each
other, i.e. the extent and location of the negative clusters do not necessarily follow the positive
cluster. This can be seen in the largest decrease of the positive cluster size compared to the smallest
increase of the negative cluster in December 2020, as well as the second peak of the negative
cluster in January 2021 which was not preceded by a positive cluster of comparable size.
In the maps of Fig. 5b we present the two largest positive and the two largest negative clusters at
different times. In agreement with previous observations the clusters from April to October 2020
are relatively small. In October 2020, the clusters started getting bigger to the west and south of
the country and in November 2020 there was a transition to a country-spanning positive rate
cluster. This cluster started dissolving in December 2020, when the middle part of the country was
connected through a negative rate cluster leaving connected areas of positive rates at the east and
west parts of the country.
Clustering can also be used to identify areas of the country where the epidemic persisted the longest
time as part of a large cluster. For this, we considered all the counties which belonged to a cluster
of at least 10000 km2 for a minimum of 1.5 months during a three-month period. The results in
Fig. 5c show that from April to August 2020 there were only few isolated counties involved in the
largest clusters. Contrary to that, a large part at the north of the country was consistently included
in large clusters during the period of September to November 2020. For the next time period, cases
were consistently increasing throughout the southern part of the country and mainly in the
southwest. In general, we see that the epidemic has been spreading quickly but has not persisted
over extended areas for more than a few months, perhaps as a result of implementing restriction
measures when active cases were increasing at a local level.
DISCUSSION
One loose interpretation of a correlation-based spatial cluster is that the virus may be transmitted
more easily within counties in this cluster, compared to counties whose active cases are
8

uncorrelated 28. This is a phenomenological manifestation of the underlying transmission
mechanisms, even though these mechanisms are not explicitly known 29. This macroscopic
evaluation of the epidemic footprint can identify areas of a country where spreading is highly
correlated and since spatial correlations can exist almost independently of the current level of the
number of active cases, they can potentially be used as warning signals.
Using spatial statistical analysis, our results indicate that the COVID-19 epidemic in continental
USA went through different phases. The first localized clusters started dissolving quickly, which
indicates that there was not any significant long-distance transmission during spring 2020. By the
summer of 2020, many local clusters started emerging whose size was continuously increasing
and by November 2020 they had merged into a country-spanning cluster. This formation was shortlived and even though local correlations remained strong, the global correlation length started
decreasing.
A similar approach can be applied to smaller areas, such as regions or states. We have created an
online tool, where the user can select individual states for further analysis. This analysis could
provide additional information on how the epidemic evolved at a smaller geographic scale and a
possible extension of this work is to relate differences in virus spreading with state-level mitigation
measures.
