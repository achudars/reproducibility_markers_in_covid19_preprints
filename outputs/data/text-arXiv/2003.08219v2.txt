Abstract
Recently, emerging epidemics like COVID-19 and its variants require predictive mathematical models to implement
suitable responses in order to limit their negative and profound impact on society. The SIR (Susceptible-InfectedRemoved) system is a straightforward mathematical formulation to model the dissemination of many infectious diseases. The present paper reports novel theoretical and analytical results for a perturbed version of an SIR model with
Gamma-distributed delay. Notably, our epidemic model is represented by Itô-Lévy stochastic differential equations
in order to simulate sudden and unexpected external phenomena. By using some new and ameliorated mathematical
approaches, we study the long-run characteristics of the perturbed delayed model. Within this scope, we give sufficient
conditions for two interesting asymptotic proprieties: extinction and persistence of the epidemic. One of the most
interesting results is that the dynamics of the stochastic model are closely related to the intensities of white noises and
Lévy jumps, which can give us a good insight into the evolution of the epidemic in some unexpected situations. Our
work complements the results of some previous investigations and provides a new approach to predict and analyze the
dynamic behavior of epidemics with distributed delay. For illustrative purposes, numerical examples are presented for
checking the theoretical study.

1. Introduction
Epidemic models under various formal frameworks are an auxiliary tool to acquire information about the dynamics
of epidemic transmission and the impact of different intervention strategies [17]. Recently, the employment of these
models to generate long-term epidemic forecasts is increased with the rising number of emerging and re-emerging
epidemic outbreaks. For example, COVID-19 and its new variant identified in England present an urgent and serious
challenge due to their contagious nature and frequently changing characteristics [20, 46, 19, 9, 2]. A mathematical model for measuring and preventing the continued spread of COVID-19 is firmly required to understand the
mechanisms of its dynamic and predict its future. Considerable attention has been paid to the analysis of susceptibleinfectious-removed (SIR) type model, which is proposed to describe the dissemination of COVID-19 before suggesting
more adapted and complex epidemic models. In the SIR model, we often assume that recovered individuals can get
continuous immunity [3]. Many studies have paid close attention to the characteristics of the long-term epidemics
immune response [12, 31, 37, 50]. To confer the realistic aspect of the epidemic model and make it biologically reasonable, numerous scholars considered the SIR epidemic model with time delay because an individual may not be
infectious until some time after becoming infected [23, 3]. In the above-mentioned works, the time delay is assumed
to be single-valued. The constant delay may be considered if the variation of the time is known exactly, which is
not real for many biological reasons [28]. Considering the variable infectivity in the time interval yields a model with
a distributed delay [4]. Therefore, it is more realistic to introduce a continuously distributed delay in the biological
modeling [45, 42]. Analyzing the characteristics of the SIR model with a distributed time delay still a rich subject that
may deliver new comprehension of the epidemics propagation which motivates our work. According to Rthe approach of
∞
Muroya et al. [32], we consider the delay kernel G : [0, ∞) → [0, ∞) as a normalized L1 -function, i.e, 0 G(s)ds = 1.

The average delay for the kernel G can be presented by the following quantity 0 sG(s)ds < ∞. Hence, the incidence

rate at time τ can be presented as the following form: βS(τ ) −∞ G(τ − s)I(s)ds, where β denotes the transmission
rate, S(t) and I(t) represent the fractions of susceptible and infective individuals at time t. The SIR epidemic model
with distributed delay can be expressed as follows [26]:

where R(t) is the fraction number of recovered populations at time t. The remaining parameters appearing in this
system are described as follows:
• A is the recruitment rate of susceptible individuals corresponding to births and immigration.
• µ1 , µ3 are the natural death rates associated respectively to the susceptible and recovered populations, µ2 is a
general mortality rate including the effect of the disease fatality.

is suitable to describe the transmission process of some known epidemics such as Rubella, Whooping cough, Measles
and Smallpox. Due to many biological and mathematical considerations [26], in this paper, we consider the delay

function G with n = 0. By letting D(t) = −∞ ηe−η(t−s) I(s)ds and using the linear chain approach, system (1) can
be transformed into the following equivalent system:

The threshold number of the deterministic system (1) is T ⋆ =

Although the use of deterministic models can explain and simulate some phenomena in real life, such models do
not actually consider the effect of the natural stochasticity, and we plainly wish to learn how randomness affects our
epidemic models [49, 52, 51, 39, 1, 33, 36]. Generally, one of the ordinary extensions from the deterministic SIR model
to the stochastic version is to incorporate environmental white noises, which appear from an almost continuous series of
small variations on the model parameters [6, 58, 56, 40, 41, 34, 38, 30]. Therefore, the stochastic delayed SIR epidemic
can be an accurate tool to predict the long-run dynamics of infectious epidemics [25, 27, 47, 16, 14, 15, 24, 18, 13].
In [26], the authors inserted the stochastic perturbation in the model (1) by assuming that the white noise is directly
proportional to the variable S and they obtained the following stochastic system:


dS(t) = A − µ1 S(t) − βS(t)D(t) dt + σS(t)dW(t),

where W(t) is a standard Brownian motion with associated intensity σ > 0. Specifically, they proved the existence
and uniqueness of an ergodic stationary distribution to the model (3). Then, they established sufficient conditions
for the extinction of a disease that spreads according to this model. On the basis of these findings, one question was
catches our attention. It is possible to develop and generalize the stochastic model proposed in [26]?. So, the objective
of this work is to expound on this problem and provide a suitable analytical context. Specifically, we aim to describe
the strong fluctuations by considering a general version of the dynamical model (3). It is clear that the population
2

systems may suffer certain sudden environmental catastrophes, such as earthquakes, floods, droughts, etc [54, 55, 57].
For example, the recent massive explosion in the port city of Beirut. The impact of this unexpected disaster has
been extremely devastating, especially when it has occurred simultaneously with the COVID-19 pandemic. This led
to a sudden worsening of the health situation and a jump increase in the number of deaths. Mathematically, we use
the Lévy process to describe the phenomena that cause a big jump to occur occasionally [11, 43, 44, 53, 61]. By
considering this type of random perturbations, the model (2) becomes the following system of stochastic differential
equations with Lévy jumps (SDE-Js for short):

Our approach allows us to close the gap left by using the classical method presented for example in [60]. Furthermore,
we give an optimal sufficient condition for the stochastic extinction. For the purpose of well understanding the
dynamics of the delayed model (5), we give a sufficient condition of the disease persistence. The analysis in this paper
seems to be promising to investigate other related stochastic delayed models with Lévy noises in epidemiology and
even in biology.
This work is organized as follows. In section 2, we verify the well-posedness of the stochastic model (5). In section
3, we give sufficient conditions for the extinction and the persistence in the mean of the disease. Finally, in section 4,
numerical simulations are carried out to confirm the theoretical study.
2. Existence and uniqueness of the global positive solution
To study the long-term properties of an infectious disease system, the prime concern is whether the solution is
unique, positive and global in time. In this short section, motivated by the approach presented in [21], we show the
3

well-posedness of the stochastic model (5). Mainly, the primary key to treat the said problem is to construct a suitable
Lyapunov function. According to some analytical and mathematical reasons, it is necessary that we make the following
two hypotheses:
Z
λ2i (u)ν(du) < ∞ (i = 1, 2, 4).
• (H1 ): We assume that the jump coefficients λi (u) in (5) satisfy
U

Z 

• (H2 ): For all i = 1, 2, 4, we assume that 1 + λi (u) > 0 and
λi (u) − ln 1 + λi (u) ν(du) < ∞.
U

By assumption (H1 ), the coefficients of the system (5) are locally Lipschitz continuous, then for any initial value
(S(0), I(0), D(0)) ∈ R3+ there is a unique local solution (S(t), I(t), D(t)) on t ∈ [0, τe ), herein, τe represents the
explosion time. In the following theorem, our goal is to show that the solution is positive and global.
Theorem 2.1. Let hypotheses (H1 ) and (H2 ) hold. For any initial value (S(0), I(0), D(0)) ∈ R3+ , there exists a
unique positive solution (S(t), I(t), D(t)) of the SDE-J (5) on t ≥ 0 and the solution will remain in R3+ with probability
one, namely (S(t), I(t), D(t)) ∈ R3+ for all t ≥ 0 almost surely (a.s.).
Proof. We only need to prove that τe = ∞ almost
 surely. Let ǫ0 > 0 be sufficiently large such that each component
1
, ǫ0 . For each integer ǫ ≥ ǫ0 , we define the following stopping time
of (S(0), I(0), D(0)) all lies in the interval

ǫ

Set inf ∅ = ∞ (∅ denotes the empty set) and let τ∞ = lim τǫ . Evidently, τǫ is increasing as ǫ → ∞. Moreover, τ∞ ≤ τe .
ǫ→∞

If we can prove that τ∞ = ∞ a.s., then τe = ∞ and (S(t), I(t), D(t)) ∈ R3+ for all t ≥ 0 almost surely. Specifically, we
need to show that τ∞ = ∞ a.s. By supposing the opposite, we can consider a pair of positive constants T > 0 and
k ∈ (0, 1) such that P{τ∞ ≤ T } > k. Hence, there exists an integer ǫ1 ≥ ǫ0 such that
P{τǫ ≤ T } ≥ k for all ǫ > ǫ1 .

3. Conditions of stochastic extinction and permanence in the mean of the epidemic
In mathematical epidemiology, we are generally interested in two things, the first is to know when the epidemic
will die out, and the second is when it will continue and persist. In this section, we will try our best to find sufficient
conditions for these two interesting asymptotic proprieties in terms of model parameters and intensities of noises. For
the sake of notational simplicity, we define
• σ̄ , max{σ12 , σ22 , σ42 }

and

ϑ , min{µ1 , µ2 + γ − η, η}.

For the convenience of discussion in the stochastic model (5), we introduce two lemmas which will be used in our
analysis.
Lemma 3.1 ([22]). We assume that the conditions (H4 ) and (H5 ) hold. Let (S(t), I(t), D(t)) be the positive solution
of the system (5) with any given initial condition (S(0), I(0), D(0)) ∈ R3+ . Let also ψ(t) ∈ R+ be the solution of the

Remark 3.2. By using the same approach adopted in Lemma 2.5 of [22], we can easily prove the last result. Note
that the hypothesis (H5 ) is an ameliorated version of it corresponding hypothesis frequently used in many previous
works, for example, [8, 7, 10]. Therefore, the adoption of χ1,p in our paper raises the optimality of our calculus and
results.
Remark 3.3. In the absence of Lévy jumps (see for example [48]), the stationary distribution expression is used to
estimate the time averages of the auxiliary process solution by employing the ergodic theorem [29]. Unluckily, the
said expression is still unknown in the case of the Lévy noise. This issue is implicitly mentioned in [60, 59] as an open
question, and the authors presented the threshold analysis of their model with an unknown stationary distribution
formula. In this article, we propose an alternative method to establish the exact expression of the threshold parameter
without having recourse to the use of ergodic theorem. This new idea that we propose is presented in the following
lemma.
Lemma 3.4. Assume that the conditions
(H4 ) and (H5 ) hold. Let ψ(t) be the solution of (6) with an initial value

We are now in the position to state and prove the main results of this paper. In the following, we always presume
that the hypotheses (H1 )-(H5 ) hold.
3.1. Stochastic extinction of the epidemic
In this subsection, we give a sufficient condition for the stochastic extinction of the disease in the system (5), but
before stating the main result, we shall first recall the concept of the stochastic extinction.
Definition 3.5. Let X (t) be a stochastic process that describes the evolution of an infectious disease under a host
population.
• The disease is said to be exponentially extinct if lim sup t−1 ln X (t) < 0 a.s.
t→∞

• The disease is said to be stochastically extinct, or extinctive, if lim X (t) = 0 a.s.
t→∞

Remark 3.6. Obviously, it can be seen from the above definitions that the exponential extinction implies the extinction.
For brevity and simplicity in writing the next result, we adopt the following notations:

Theorem 3.7. Let us denote by (S(t), I(t), D(t)) the solution of the stochastic system (5) that starts from a given

corresponding to T ⋆ . This vector will be denoted by (e1 , e2 ) = (1, T ⋆ ). Then, T ⋆ (e1 , e2 ) = (e1 , e2 )M0 . On the
other hand, we define a C 2 -function M : R2+ →R+ by
M(I(t), D(t)) = ω1 I(t) + ω2 D(t),

It is easy to check that J3 (t) is a local martingale with finite quadratic variation, and by the hypothesis (H3 ) we can
affirm that J4 (t) is also a local martingale with finite quadratic variation. By the strong law of large numbers for local
martingales [29], we get

disease will die out with probability one and this completes the proof.

Remark 3.8. When the jumps coefficients λi (u) (i = 1, 2, 4) and the white intensities σi (i = 2, 4) degenerate to zero,
our results in Theorem 3.7 coincide with Theorem 2.3 in [26]. Therefore, our results generalize the consequence of the
mentioned paper.
3.2. Persistence in mean of the epidemic
The study of the persistence in the mean is a significant characteristic to know more about epidemic dynamics. For
this reason, in this section, we will give the condition for the disease persistence, but before stating the main result,
we shall first recall the concept of persistence in the mean.
Definition 3.9. An infected population I(t) is said to be be strongly persistent in the mean, or just persistent in the

mean, if lim inf t

Theorem 3.10. Let (S(t), I(t), D(t)) be the solution of (5) with any initial data (S(0), I(0), D(0)) ∈ R3+ . The
stochastic model (5) has the following property: if Tf⋆ > 1 holds, then the disease I(t) persists in the mean almost
surely.
Proof. Begin by considering the following function

Z(S(t), I(t), D(t)) = −c1 ln S(t) − ln I(t) − c2 ln D(t) + c3 D(t).
where ci , (i = 1, 2, 3) are positive constants to be determined in the following. From Itô’s formula and system (5), we
have

Remark 3.11. Persistence in the mean is an important concept in mathematical epidemiology. It captures the longterm survival of the disease even when the population size is quite low at t = 0. Moreover, the persistence of the
model refers to a situation where the disease is endemic in a population.
4. Numerical simulations
This section is devoted to illustrate our theoretical results by employing numerical simulations. In the three
following examples, we apply the algorithm presented in [35] to discretize the disturbed system (5). Using the software
Matlab2015b and the parameter values listed in Table 1, we numerically simulate the solution of the system (5) with
the initial value (S(0), I(0), D(0)) = (0.6, 0.3, 0.05).

4.1. The stochastic extinction case
In order to exhibit the strong random fluctuations effect on epidemic dynamics, we present in Figure 1, the
trajectories of the stochastic solution (S(t), I(t), D(t)). We assume that U = (0, ∞) and ν(U) = 1, then by using the
parameters listed in Table 1, we must check the existence of p such that χ1,p > 0. By simple calculation, we easily
get χ1,p = 0.0206 for p = 2.1. Then, the condition (H5 ) is satisfied. With the chosen parameters, we can obtain the
following values:

Table 3: Some expressions and their corresponding values.

Therefore, Tf⋆ > 1. From Figure 2, we observe the persistence of the epidemic I(t) in this case, which agree well
with Theorem 3.10. Furthermore, the solutions S(t) and D(t) are persistent which implies the non-extinction of the
stochastic model (5).
4.3. The Lévy jumps effect on the epidemic dynamics
To find out the effect of white noise and jumps intensities on epidemic dynamics, in this example, we will compare
the trajectories of the following systems:
• The deterministic model (3) (σi = 0 and λi = 0, i = 1, 2, 4).
• The stochastic version of (3) with degenerate diffusion [26] (σ2 = σ4 = 0 and λi = 0, i = 1, 2, 4).

• The SDE-J system (5) (σi 6= 0 and λi 6= 0, i = 1, 2, 4).

We take the values appearing in Table 1 which are the same as those used in [26]. For the rest of parameters, we
choose σ1 = 0.2, σ2 = 0.15, σ4 = 0.13, λ1 = 0.5, λ2 = 0.3, and λ4 = 0.7. For the sake of a comparison, we choose
the following initial value used in (S(0), I(0), D(0)) = (0.2, 0.3, 0.4) used in [26]. We see from Figure 3 that the
effects of Lévy jumps lead to the extinction of the disease while the deterministic model (3) and the perturbed model
driven by degenerate diffusion both predict persistence. Therefore, we say that the jumps have negative effects on
the prevalence of epidemics. This means that jumps can change the asymptotic behavior of the epidemic model
significantly. To examine the effect of jumps intensities on dynamical system (3) in the case of persistence, we shall
decrease the intensity σ1 to 0.169 and take other parameter as in the last column of Table 1. From Figure 4, we
observe the persistence of the epidemic in all cases with a greater variation in the case of Lévy jumps.
5. Conclusion and discussion
Environmental factors and unexpected phenomena have significant impacts on the spread of epidemics. This paper
takes into account these two factors. Specifically, we have analyzed a delayed SIR epidemic model that incorporates
proportional Lévy jumps. For analytical reasons, we have employed the linear chain approach to transform the model
with a weak kernel case (1) into the equivalent system (2). After proving the well-posedness of this perturbed model,
we have analyzed its long-term behavior. Under some hypotheses, the main epidemiological findings of our study are
presented as follows:

1. We have given sufficient condition for the extinction of the epidemic.
2. We have established sufficient condition for the persistence in the mean of the epidemic.
Compared to the existing literature, the novelty of our work lies in new mathematical analysis techniques and improvements which are summarized in the following items:
1. Our work is distinguished from previous works [8, 7, 10] by the use of the expression χ1,p which boosts the
optimality of our calculus and results.
2. Our study offers an alternative method to the gap mentioned in (Theorem 2.2, [60]). Without using the explicit
formula of the distribution stationary π ⋆ (·) of ψ (which still up to now unknown), we calculate the following
time averages:
Z

3. In order to find an optimal and good majorization, we have considered the inequality (10) in our analysis without
eliminated it (since ln(1 + x) − x ≤ 0 for all x > −1) which differs from the calculus presented in [7].
Generally speaking, our theoretical results indicate that the conditions of extinction and persistence are mainly depending on the magnitude of the noise intensities as well as the system parameters. From numerical simulations, we
remark that Lévy jumps affect significantly the long-run behavior of an epidemic. Eventually, we point out that this
15

paper extends the study presented in [26] to the case of Lévy jumps and delivers some new insights for understanding
the propagation of diseases with distributed delay. Furthermore, the method developed in this paper can be used to
investigate a class of related stochastic models driven by Lévy noise.
