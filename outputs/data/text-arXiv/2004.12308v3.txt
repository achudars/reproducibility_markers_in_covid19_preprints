Abstract A novel coronavirus, designated as COVID-19,
emerged in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019. In this paper,
a mathematical model is proposed to analyze the dynamic
behavior of COVID-19. Based on inter-city networked coupling effects, a fractional-order SEIHDR system with the
real-data from 23 January to 18 March, 2020 of COVID19 is discussed. Meanwhile, hospitalized individuals and the
mortality rates of three types of individuals (exposed, infected and hospitalized) are firstly taken into account in the
proposed model. And infectivity of individuals during incubation is also considered in this paper. By applying least
squares method and predictor-correctors scheme, the numerical solutions of the proposed system in the absence of the
inter-city network and with the inter-city network are stimulated by using the real-data from 23 January to 18 − m
March, 2020 where m is equal to the number of prediction days. Compared with integer-order system (α = 0), the
fractional-order model without network is validated to have
a better fitting of the data on Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan,
Huanggang and other cities. In contrast to the case without network, the results indicate that the inter-city network
system may be not a significant case to virus spreading for
China because of the lock down and quarantine measures,
however, it may have an impact on cities that have not adopted
city closure. Meanwhile, the proposed model better fits the

number of confirmed people is also predicted by this fractionorder model. Furthermore, the existence and uniqueness of a
bounded solution under the initial condition are considered
in the proposed system. Afterwards, the basic reproduction
number R0 is analyzed and it is found to hold a threshold:
the disease-free equilibrium point is locally asymptotically
stable when R0 ≤ 1, which provides a theoretical basis for
whether COVID-19 will become a pandemic in the future.

1 Introduction
In December 2019, the first case of respiratory disease
caused by a novel coronavirus was identified in Wuhan City,
Hubei Province, China. Contrary to the initial observations
[8], COVID-19 does spread from person to person as confirmed in [6]. It quickly spread to all parts of the country
and parts of Southeast Asia, North America and Europe.
As of 5 February, 2020, more than 24550 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had been confirmed, including over 190 cases outside of China, and more than 490
reported deaths globally. Several intervention strategies have
been implemented in China in order to contain the epidemic.
Whereas assessing the intervention measures of COVID-19
epidemic poses a major health concern.
Wuhan is the capital of Hubei Province, as the major
air and train transportation hub of central China with huge
population movement during the period of spring festival.
The geographical factors plus self-sustaining human-to- human transmission in the community of the new coronavirus
have added radical difficulties to the prevention and interference of this epidemic. The outflow of domestic passenger

2

volumes from Wuhan was estimated to be 5 million during
the spring festival, about 0.7 of which went to other cities in
Hubei province. which made it difficult for the infected people to track back to the population. Government has progressively implemented metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan
since 23-24 January, 2020 which ultimately contributes a
lot of the containment of virus. The epidemic was seeded
by a force of frequent human contact generating from communication. Prasse et al. proposed a network-based discrete
model to describe this condition and they found the networkbased modelling was beneficial for an accurate forecast of
the epidemic outbreak [22]. Peng et al. constructed and analyzed a generalized SEIR model to analyze COVID-19 and
their work showed that the outbreak of COVID-19 in China
could be dated back to the end of December 2019 [21].
In addition, the basic reproduction number R0 is ’the expected number of secondary cases produced, in a completely
susceptible population, by a typical infective individual’. If
R0 ≤ 1, on average an infected individual produces less than
one new infected individual over the course of its infectious
period, and the infection cannot grow. Conversely, if R0 > 1,
each infected individual produces, on average, more than
one new infection, and the disease can invade the population [10]. There have been abundant articles estimating the
basic reproduction number R0 of COVID-19 to determine
whether the epidemic disease will spread widely [15,18,24].
Meanwhile, in the process of infectious disease transmission, susceptible individuals contact infected individuals and
become infected with a certain probability. There is a lot of
evidence that the incidence rate is an important tool to describe this process [4,5,28]. It represents the infection ability
of a infected individuals in per-unit time. So because of high
infectiousness of COVID-19, the bilinear incidence rate is
always considered. And the classical SEIR model assumes
that the incubation of infected person is not infectious, but
this assumption is quite different from the infection characteristics of the new coronavirus infection COVID-19 [27].
What’s more, due to a variety of special conditions, patients
with COVID-19 cannot be admitted to hospital for immediate treatment, and individuals infected with COVID-19 have
a high mortality rate both in the incubation period and notreatment period.

that, its derivative for a constant is zero. What’s more, the
precision of the Caputo fractional-order can supersede the
integer order resulting from its changes at every instant of
time and nonlocal behavior. Khan et al. considered a fractionalorder model to describe the brief details of interactional among
the bats and unknown hosts, then among the people and the
infections reservoir (seafood market) and found the fractional model can be helpful for the infection minimization
[14]. Yu et al. establish a novel fractional time delay dynamic system (FTDD) to describe the local outbreak of COVID19 and the reconstructed coefficients are used to predict the
trend of the Corona-Virus [7]. Shaikh et al. estimated the effectiveness of preventive measures and various mitigations,
predicting future outbreaks and potential control strategies
using a Bats-Hosts-Reservoir-People transmission fractionalorder COVID-19 model [3]. Xu et al. proposed a generalized
fractional-order SEIQRD model and this model has a basis
guiding significance for the prediction of the possible outbreak of infectious diseases like COVID-19 and other insect
diseases in the future [29].
The purpose of this paper is to incorporate time-fractionalorder and inter-city networked coupling effects into a SEIHDR epidemic model to investigate the dynamic behavior of
COVID-19. There are a lot of research for COVID-19 that
not only individuals are contagious, but those in the incubation period may have the same incidence rate as well as
those with symptoms. So the infectiousness of the infected
person’s incubation period is considered in this paper. Also,
considering an individual hospitalized with COVID-19, the
different mortality rates are investigated in this model. Thus
based on the above analysis and the memorability of Caputo fractional-order derivatives, a fractional-order SEIHDR
model for COVID-19 with inter-city networked coupling effects are built. Should such a model can be fitted with data
reasonably well, some epidemic parameters can be extracted.
Then, based on the official data given by NHC (National
Health Commission of the people’s Republic of China [1])
every day, several numerical examples are exhibited to verify the rationality of the fractional-order model and effectiveness of inter-city networked coupling. Compared with
integer-order system (α = 0), the fractional-order model without network is validated to have a better fitting of the data
on Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Huanggang and other cities.
In the case of inter-city networked coupling effect, the results indicate that this system may be not a significant case
to virus spreading for China, but may have an impact on
preventive measures in other countries. Finally, the stability of disease-free equilibrium point is obtained by the basic
reproduction number R0 , which provide theoretical significance for the development of COVID-19 in futher.

It is worthing to point out that the state of epidemic models does not depend on its history in the classical integerorder epidemic model. However, in real life, the spread of
infectious diseases depends not only on its current state, but
also on its past state. Smethurst et al. find that the waiting
times between doctor visits for a patient follow a power law
model [26]. At the same time, a power law waiting time distribution P[Jn > t] = Bx−α leads to Caputo fractional time
derivative Ct0 Dtα of the same order [19]. And the Caputo fractional- The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section

2 Model Development
Fractional-order calculus have been found wide applications to model dynamics processes in many well-known
fields of science, engineering, biology, medicine, and many
other [11, 12, 20, 23, 25]. Before presenting the epidemic
model in fractional derivative, some necessary preliminaries are introduced.

2.2 System description
A novel coronavirus disease, named COVID-19, broke
out in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, in December 2019. A
great deal of epidemic models exists to describe spread of infectious diseases mathematically [2]. However, the outbreak
of COVID-19 began during the period of spring festival in
China, which large population movement made cities more
interconnected. Meanwhile, Wuhan is the capital of Hubei
Province, as the major air and train transportation hub of
central China, which makes it necessary to built a inter-city
networked to analyze the spread of COVID-19. And due to
limited medical conditions, individuals in incubation and infection periods cannot be hospitalized immediately for treatment, which increases the mortality of COVID-19. Moreover, Tang et al proposed that the incubation of infected person of COVID-19 is infectious [27]. Based on the above
analysis, a fractional-order SEIHDR model with inter-city
networked coupling effects in this paper is developed as follows:

3 Model Analysis
In this section, some dynamical behaviors of the proposed system (1) are analyzed.

3.1 Nonnegativity and Boundedness
It is significant to demonstrate the existence, uniqueness
and boundedness of a nonnegative solutions for system (1)
before implementing its numerical process. Thus this subsection moves to the discussion of proprieties mentioned
above.
Theorem 3.1. For any given initial condition (Sk (0), Ek (0),
Ik (0), Hk (0), Rk (0), Dk (0)) ≥ (6≡)(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), there exists
a unique nonnegative and boundedenss solution (Sk (t), Ek (t),
Ik (t), Hk (t), Rk (t), Dk (t)) of system (1) for all k = 1, 2, ..., n
and t > 0 where t = 0 represents 23 January, 2020.
Proof: Let Nk = Sk + Ek + Ik + Hk + Rk + Dk . Adding all
equations of system (1) gives C0 Dtα Nk = 0 which Nk = Mk is
a positive constant. So one has Sk ≤ Mk , Ek ≤ Mk , Ik ≤ Mk ,
Hk ≤ Mk , Rk ≤ Mk and Dk ≤ Mk where k = 1, 2, ..., n.
Let Xk = (Sk , Ek , Ik , Hk , Rk , Dk ), X = (Sk , E k , I k , H k , Rk , Dk )
and Fk = ( f1k , f2k , f3k , f4k , f5k , f6k ) where

Through the comparison theorem, it is not difficult to find
that (Sk , E k , I k , H k , Rk , Dk ) = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) is the lower solution of system (1). Thus, one has Sk ≥ 0, Ek ≥ 0, Ik ≥ 0,
Hk ≥ 0, Rk ≥ 0 and Dk ≥ 0 for t ≥ 0 and k = 1, 2, ..., n. 

3.2 Stability Analysis
Turning now to the exploration on local stability of system (1) by considering first the disease-free equilibrium and
the basic reproduction number denoted by R0 . According
to system (1), the disease-free equilibrium for system (1)
is E 0 = (S1 (0), 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ..., Sn(0), 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) where Sk (0)
(k = 1, 2, ..., n) are the initial condition of system (1).
Theorem 3.2. The basic reproduction number of system
(1) is

taking the derivative of F0 , V01 , V02 and V03 with respect to

A fractional-order SEIHDR model for COVID-19 with inter-city networked coupling effects

Based on the basic reproduction number R0 , the following theorem can be taken into consideration:
Theorem 3.3. If R0 ≤ 1, the disease-free equilibrium
point E 0 = (S1 (0), 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ..., Sn (0), 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) of system (1) is locally asymptotic stability.
Proof: The disease-free equilibrium point E 0 of system
(1) is locally asymptotically stable if all eigenvalues of the
Jacobian matrix of system (1) at E 0 namely,



satisfies |arg(s)| > απ
2 and unstable if for some eigenvalues
απ
s, |arg(s)| < 2 , where V41 = diag(λ1 (t), ...., λn (t)), V51 =
diag(µ11 , ...., µ1n ), V61 = diag(µ21 , ...., µ2n ) and V71 = diag
(κ1 (t), ...., κn (t)). One can calculate that the eigenvalues are
s1 = 0 and s2 = −s(V31 ) and
s3 + s4 = s(F1 − V10 − V21),
s3 s4 = s(F1 (V20 − V21) + V20V21 ),
where s(V31 ), s(F1 −V10 −V21) and s(F1 (V20 −V21)+V20V21 )
are all eigenvalues of the matrix V31 , F1 − V10 − V21 and
F1 (V20 − V21 ) + V20V21 , respectively. Then if R0 ≤ 1, one
has |arg(s)| > απ
2 . Thus the disease-free equilibrium point
E 0 = (S1 (0), 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ..., Sn (0), 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) of system (1)
is locally asymptotic stability.

Remark 3.1. When there is no interaction between city
k and city j (i.e. city k is isolated from other cities), the basic
reproduction number in city k is given:
Rk0 =

βkk Sk (0)(δk + µ2k + rk )
.
(δk + µ2k )(µ1k + rk )Nk

In this case, the disease-free equilibrium point Ek0 = (Sk (0), 0,
0, 0, 0, 0) of city k is local asymptotic stability when the basic number Rk0 ≤ 1.
Remark 3.2. It is obvious that the basic number Rk0 is
dependent from the onset λk and κk . The sensitivity of Rk0 to
the other parameters βkk , µ1k , rk , µ2k and δk are calculated
as follows:
Aβkk =

βkk ∂ R0
µ1k ∂ R0
µ1k

R0 ∂ βkk
R0 ∂ µ1k

Aδk =

where Aβkk , Aµ1k , Aµ2k and Aδk denote the normalized sensitivity indexes with respect to βkk , µ1k , µ2k and δk , respectively. It is remarkable that the m times’ increase in βkk results in the m times’ increase in Rk0 , but the m times’ increase
in µ1k , µ2k , δk and rk results in the m times’ decrease in Rk0 .

4 Numerical Analysis
From the previous discussion, it can be seen that system
(1) is locally stable at the disease-free equilibrium point E 0 ,
and it has one unique bounded solution, which may provide
a theoretical basis for the coronavirus control. This section
presents the numerical stimulation of the coronavirus system (1) by fitting the real-data dating from 21 January to
18 March, 2020, given by NHC every day. System (1) is
solved by applying least squares method [9] and predictorcorrectors scheme. To evaluate the prediction accuracy, the
data can be moved for a fixed number of days, say m, prior to
March 18. The prediction model is determined upon the data
from 23 January up to 18 − m March, 2020. Then we predict
the course of the disease up to 18 March, and the number of
omitted days m is equal to the number of prediction days. It
is reasonable to assume like in [21] from COVID-19 that the
cure rates λ (t) and the disease-related death rate κ (t) vary
over time as

λ (t) = λ0 (1 − eλ1t ), κ (t) = κ0 e−κ1t ,
where λ0 and κ0 are initial cure and death rate. In the absence of the network (i.e. k = 1), one can see from Fig. 1,
Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 that the fitting effect of the
fraction-order system (1) is better than that of the integerorder system (i.e. α = 1) both the peak number and time
of confirmed individuals. Particularly, the fractional-orders
are α = 1.1913, α = 1.2873, α = 1.4343, α = 1.2403 and
α = 0.0332, respectively. Corresponding the basic reproduction number R0k are 0.8855, 0.8833, 0.9848, 1.1491, 0.9568,
respectively. Then the sensitivity of the basic reproduction
number is presented from Fig. 6, which is consistent with
Remark 3.2. In addition Fig. 7 give a observation iconically
on that as the disease transmission coefficient βkk and the
hospitalization rate of infective individuals δk change, the
peak time and final infection size are given (if control measures before January 22 are to continue). The numerical results reveal that strict control of human contact, increased
accounting reagents and clinical testing plays a critical role
in reducing the number of confirmed case and postponing
the occurrence of peak in Hubei province. However, it also
can be found from Fig. 7 that when the disease transmission
coefficient βkk increases, the number of the infected reaches
its peak time earlier, meanwhile, its peak size increases. It
can be induced that the measures taken by some countries
are feasible and effective.

6

In the case of the inter-city network effect involving the
cities in Hubei and their interactions (eg. traffic flow), the
precise interactions between cities are known and must be
inferred from system (1) by applying least squares method.
Then the relationship between Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan
and Huanggang are described in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9. It can
be seen that the network-based model is no longer suitable
for China, since China imposed city closures on 23 January. Nevertheless, with regard to population mobility in
other countries, it can be hypothesized that the networkbased model shows a better performance in describing the
disease situation which will be the ensuring research focus.
Finally, based on the data of symptoms, hospitalizations,
deaths and recoveries in Italy from 24 February to 31 March,
the short-term prediction for future outbreaks is realized in
Fig. 10. Then by calculation, the basic reproduction number R0k = 1.3368 × 103 is significantly greater than 1, which
suggests that COVID-19 of Italy will not be eliminated in a
short term. In addition, it can be seen from Fig.10 that the
number of symptomatic individuals peaked on 30 June and
the peak day of the number of hospitalizations occurred on
20 April, without surprise, the number of death and recovery
individuals have increased.
5 Discussion
In this paper, incorporating inter-city networked coupling
effects for Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan and Huanggang, a fractional order SEIHDR epidemic model is proposed. By applying least squares method and predictor-correctors scheme,
the numerical solution of system (1) is compared with the
real-date from 23 January to 18 March, 2020 about Beijing,
Shanghai, Hubei, Wuhan and Huanggang. One of the most
significant findings to emerge from this investigation is that
the fractional-order system has a better fitting effect than the
integer-order system. In addition, in the case of the inter-city
network effect, the results indicate that the network system
may be not a significant case to virus spreading for China.
Meanwhile, system (1) better fits the data from 24 February
to 31, March in Italy and the peak number of confirmed individuals in Italy is predicted according to system (1). Moreover, the existence, uniqueness, and positivity solution by
the initial-value problem of system (1) are establish. Then
the local stability of disease-free equilibrium point are studied by the basic reproduction number R0 . And in the absence
of network, the sensitivity of Rk0 to the other parameters is
analyzed, which provide theoretical basis for disease control.
While this study did not confirm the epidemic model
based on inter-city networked effects in China cases due to
their strict lock down measures, it did partially substantiate
that the fractional-order model based on network may yield
more accurate predictions than modeling the epidemic for

Zhenzhen Lu et al.

other countries independently. In spite of its efficiency in
predicting the case of COVID-19 in China, this study has
inspired several questions in need of further investigation:
if the network model can be adapted for predicting the epidemic in other regions; how the factors like medical treatment affect the tendency of virus spreading and so on. It
is recommended that further research be undertaken in predicting outbreaks in other countries with networked effects
included in the dynamic model.
