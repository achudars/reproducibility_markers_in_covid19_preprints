Abstract
Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) created dire consequences globally and triggered
an intense scientific effort from different domains. The resulting publications created a
huge text collection in which finding the studies related to a biomolecule of interest is challenging for general purpose search engines because the publications are rich in domain specific terminology. Here, we present Vapur: an
online COVID-19 search engine specifically
designed to find related protein - chemical
pairs. Vapur is empowered with a relationoriented inverted index that is able to retrieve
and group studies for a query biomolecule with
respect to its related entities. The inverted index of Vapur is automatically created with a
BioNLP pipeline and integrated with an online
user interface. The online interface is designed
for the smooth traversal of the current literature by domain researchers and is publicly
available at https://tabilab.cmpe.boun.
edu.tr/vapur/.

Introduction

Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak had severe impacts on human health all
around the world since December 2019, but also
triggered an exceptional amount of scientific work.
As of September 2020, PubMed recorded over 45K
articles (Chen et al., 2020) related to COVID-19
since its inception, including works on diagnosis
(Dorche et al., 2020), drug repurposing (Gao et al.,
2020), and text-mining (Tarasova et al., 2020). As
the body of literature keeps growing in the form of
unstructured text, it also becomes more and more
challenging for researchers to find the relevant information they need. Furthermore, the publications include domain-specific named entities and

relations that challenge the general-purpose search
engines. Therefore, it is of critical importance to
build a search engine that can find relevant documents in this terminology-rich and domain-specific
literature.
Biomedical named entity recognition (NER)
and relation extraction can be utilized to semantically structure publications around the biochemically related entities. When named entities and their relations are extracted, a document can be expressed as a set of triplets of the
form (Entity1, Entity2, Relation). This formulation can be converted to an inverted index
from the related entities to the publications in
order to enable retrieving relevant documents to
a query by entity and relation matching. If the
same entities are referenced with different words
(e.g. ACE2, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2,
Q9BYF1), named entity normalization can be used
to identify different mentions of the same entity.
Enhanced with named entity normalization, the
inverted index can retrieve the documents that contain biochemical relations of a free-text query, as
grouped by the related biomolecules.
In this work, we present Vapur, an online search
engine to find related protein - compound pairs in
the COVID-19 anthology. Vapur is empowered
with a biochemical relation-based inverted index
that is created through named entity recognition,
named entity normalization, and relation extraction on CORD-19 abstracts (Wang et al., 2020a).
Thanks to the underlying biochemical domainspecific tools and relation extraction model, Vapur
identifies biochemically related entities to a freetext query and retrieves the publications that mention the relation. The design of Vapur offers a novel
approach to explore COVID-19 literature with a fo-

Related Work

Keeping up to date with the growing body of
biomedical literature is a big challenge and almost a
kind of magic in scientific research. Efforts such as
ChemProt (Krallinger et al., 2017) aim to promote
research in this direction by presenting PubMed
abstracts in which proteins, chemicals, and their
relations are manually labeled. Liu et al., 2018 and
Lim and Kang, 2018 developed sequential models for chemical and protein relation extraction on
ChemProt, while Peng et al., 2018 used an ensemble of deep models with SVM. However, all these
models depend on the named entities to be recognized beforehand.
Named entity recognition and normalization are
widely studied topics in biomedical text mining
to extract and link entities. Conditional Random
Fields (CRF) was a popular approach in early
biomedical NER studies (Leaman et al., 2015;
Wei et al., 2015, 2018) and with the rise of deep
learning, sequential models were also integrated
(Sachan et al., 2018). Recently, transformers-based
NER models attracted more attention, including
BERN (Kim et al., 2019), which is a state-ofthe-art biomedical named entity recognition and
normalization tool that uses BioBERT (Lee et al.,
2020b) to identify and normalize the entities in
a sentence. BERN is adopted by recent generaldomain biomedical text mining studies (Jang et al.,
2019) as well as a model to answer COVID-19
related questions based on CORD-19 (Lee et al.,
2020a).

CORD-19 (Wang et al., 2020a) is a data set comprising scientific publications related to COVID-19
and it has provided a valuable resource for text
mining studies (Su et al., 2020; Esteva et al., 2020;
Wang et al., 2020b), including COVID-19 specific
search engine development such as SemViz (Tu
et al., 2020) and KD-COVID1 .
SemViz aims to present subtle relations between
entities by semantic visualization of a CORD-19
based knowledge-graph. KD-COVID, on the other
hand, identifies the most similar sentence in CORD19 to a query and retrieves the corresponding publication. KD-COVID also provides links to large protein, disease, and protein-disease relation databases.
Vapur is different from these approaches, since it
is based on an inverted index from biochemically
related entities to publications. While most other
systems depend on existing knowledge bases to
provide information about related entities, Vapur
uses NLP techniques to automatically extract the
most up-to-date information from the scientific literature.

System Description

Vapur is an online search engine with a focus
on finding related proteins and chemicals in the
COVID-19 literature. Vapur is able to retrieve relevant documents to a query as categorized by the
biochemically related entities thanks to its relationoriented inverted index. In order to obtain the index, Vapur first identifies and normalizes the named
entities in CORD-19 abstracts using a pre-trained
model, BERN (Kim et al., 2019). Afterward, Vapur
determines if the entity pairs in the same sentence
are related to each other by the binary relation ex1

traction model we trained on the ChemProt data
set (Krallinger et al., 2017). The result of the relation extraction model is a list of related entities
for each abstract. This list is then used to construct the inverted index that represents biochemical relations as entity pairs and maps each relation to the documents in which the relation was
mentioned. Vapur is publicly available at https:
//tabilab.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/vapur/ and Figure 1 illustrates its workflow.
Vapur represents the entities as equivalence
classes learned from the named entity recognition
and normalization steps. For instance, “Interleukin1b” is the member of the class {interleukin-1b, IL1beta, IL1B, HGNC:5992, . . . , BERN:323737602}
in the index and Vapur retrieves related entities and
relevant documents with a mention “Interleukin1b” even if the query is “IL1B”. The equivalence
classes cover a wide range of mention types from
free-text to chemical IDs and enable a flexible
search experience for the search terms.
Vapur represents each entity mention as a string
and adopts a 3-gram based matching algorithm to
search the queried entity in its index. Given a query,
Vapur first creates a multi-set of all 3-grams of the
query and computes the similarity of this set to all 3gram multi-sets of the mentions in the index, which
are pre-computed. Vapur measures the similarity
of the query to a mention by generalized Jaccard
similarity:
P
min(Qi , Mi )
J(Q, M ) = P i

i max(Qi , Mi )

where Q and M are query and mention vectors
that store the count of each 3-gram. Generalized
Jaccard similarity makes Vapur more robust in retrieving results for typos in a query.
When the related entities and their abstracts are
retrieved, Vapur ranks the related entities by the
number of times they are co-mentioned with the
queried entity. Each entity is displayed with its
most frequent mention alongside the links to the
papers.
We also interpret the relation-oriented index of
Vapur as a graph to find similar entities to the query
that cannot be trivially inferred from the inverted
index. We construct a graph from the index such
that the nodes represent biomolecules and the edges
denote biochemical relations. The resulting graph
satisfies the bipartiteness property, since we identify the relations only between the proteins and

chemicals during binary relation extraction. Table 1 demonstrates the summary statistics of this
bipartite graph computed via networkx (Hagberg
et al., 2008).
We leverage the bipartite graph structure to identify similar biomolecules of the same type. We
use SimRank (Jeh and Widom, 2002) to compute
pairwise node similarity and list the five entities
most similar to the query, in addition to the search
results. Our goal is to allow researchers to explore
information in the literature not only for the query,
but also for entities similar to the query.

Use Case Scenario

We consulted with domain experts to build scenarios in which Vapur can help researchers. We
present a use case that highlights how the relationbased index of Vapur and the similar entity prediction can extend the scope of a research. We
illustrate the scenario in Figure 2.
Relation between Favipiravir and RdRp: A
medicinal chemist working on COVID-19 drug development is interested in “Favipiravir”, one of the
drugs clinically used in COVID-19 therapy. She
searches Favipiravir on Vapur and the results highlight RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) enzyme as the most frequently co-mentioned protein
that is identified by Vapur as being related to Favipiravir. Vapur displays sentences from the publications stating that Favipiravir inhibits RdRp and also
proposes “Examorelin” as a contextually similar
molecule to Favipiravir. The researcher decides to
extend her research to Examorelin, another drug

Methods
Data sets

CORD-19 We create a relation-oriented search
engine for CORD-19 abstracts. CORD-19 is a
regularly updated data set that contains studies related to COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2. We use
the CORD-19 snapshot of August 23, 2020, that
contains ≈ 233K documents for which ≈ 143K
unique abstracts are provided. Vapur indexes these
abstracts, but is also able to return the linked fullpaper.
ChemProt We trained a binary relation extraction model using the ChemProt data set (Krallinger
et al., 2017), a curation of PubMed abstracts
whose entities and relations are manually annotated.
ChemProt consists of 2432 abstract, 62,147 entity,
and 45,171 relation files. An abstract file contains a
PubMed abstract ID and its text, whereas an entity
file lists the chemicals and proteins in the linked abstract. Last, a relation file reports the relation type
between entity pairs in the same sentence whose
relation types can be inferred from the sentence.
The relations in ChemProt are categorized into

11 categories, where the first 10 categories (CPR:0
to CPR:9) denote various types of biochemical relations, while the last category (CPR:10) is reserved
for “not relation” (i.e., the sentence explicitly states
that there is no relation between the specified pair
of entities). In this work, we focus on binary relation extraction, where we aim to determine whether
a sentence states that there is a relation between
the specified two entities or not. Therefore, we
consider the entity pairs in the first 10 categories
as positive samples. We treat the CPR:10 and the
“Other” categories as the negative class, since the
sentences for these two categories do not state that
there is a relation between the corresponding pair
of entities. We describe each relation type and report their instance counts in the ChemProt data set
in Table 2. We also provide summary statistics for
ChemProt in Table 3.

Named Entity Recognition and
Normalization

We used BERN (Kim et al., 2019), a neural NER
architecture with an integrated normalizer that can
perform in a multi-type setting, to identify and normalize the entities in CORD-19 abstracts. BERN
is an ensemble of existing tools and models (Wei

Table 3: ChemProt summary statistics. We split abstracts to sentences via GENIA (Kim et al., 2003) and
compute the statistics accordingly and therefore some
relations in ChemProt that are not in a sentence are filtered out. We refer to relations in the same sentence
with the same protein, chemical and relation type as
duplicate relations and consider them only once during
training. We observe that the number of mentions is
considerably higher than the number of unique entities
for both proteins and chemicals, emphasizing the need
for normalization. In addition, negative entity pairs are
significantly more frequent than the positive ones, but
their distribution across the training, development, and
test folds is similar.

2015; Wei et al., 2016, 2018; Lee et al., 2020b)
and outputs a set of IDs for each recognized entity,
given a sentence.
In this study, we first tokenized the abstracts with
GENIA (Kim et al., 2003) and identified 1.23M
sentences. We used BERN to extract named entities and their IDs in these sentences and recognized
1.58M entities in total, in which 171K are chemicals, 318K are proteins, and others are diseases
and species. With normalization, we computed the
number of unique chemicals and proteins as 20K
and 70K, respectively.
4.3

Relation Extraction

We propose a BioBERT-based model to identify
related entities in CORD-19 abstracts. To this
end, we first preprocessed the sentences to explicitly encode the entities in the input and then finetuned BioBERT with the preprocessed sentences
in ChemProt. We used the binary labels in Section
4.1 as outputs.
Preprocessing We surrounded the named entities in the sentences with opening and closing tags
to mark their location. We tagged chemicals with
<e1> and </e1> and proteins with <e2> and
</e2> to encode entity type and location during
training. When a sentence had multiple chemical
- protein pairs, we considered each pair separately

Table 4: An example of preprocessing. The raw sentence contains two chemicals (gefitinib, erlotinib) and one

two preprocessed forms.
Model We trained a binary model that decides
if two entities in the same sentence are biochemically related. The goal of training a binary model
instead of a multi-class one is to identify biochemical relations beyond the classes in ChemProt. By
formulating the problem as binary classification,
we can potentially identify the biochemically related molecules in CORD-19, whose biochemical
relation type cannot be categorized under any of
the ChemProt classes.
We used BioBERT with the addition of a singlelayer binary log-softmax classifier and trained the
classifier with the inputs and outputs from the previous step using the cross-entropy loss. BioBERT

Experimental setup We conducted a hyperparameter search with different optimizers, learning rates, and weight decays. We trained a model
10 times per parameter combination and selected
the best one based on the F-score on the development set. We found that the AdamW optimizer
with a 0.00003 learning rate and 0.1 weight decay
yields the best results. We selected the best setting
for relation extraction and computed mean precision, recall, and F1-score as well as the standard
deviation on the ChemProt development (dev) and
test sets.

Results and Discussion

In order to assess the performance of Vapur, we
evaluated the performance of its components both
as separate modules and together as an end-to-end
pipeline. Since BERN, the named entity recognition and normalization module, has already been
shown to be successful (Kim et al., 2019), we focus
on automatic evaluation of the relation extraction
model and expert evaluation of Vapur in this work.

Relation Extraction Model

We built the relation extraction model by finetuning a binary classifier on BioBERT and then
computed precision, recall, and F1-Score on the
dev and test sets of ChemProt. We also finetuned the same classifier using English BERT based
model and report the results in Table 5.
Table 5 demonstrates that BioBERT obtained
higher scores in terms of all three metrics on both
folds, indicating that BioBERT is superior to BERT
as a pre-trained language model for relation extraction on ChemProt. We relate this with the fact that
BioBERT is trained with a more domain-related

We evaluated Vapur from two different perspectives. We first analyzed 41 sample sentences in
which Vapur identified a biochemical relation as a
first step to discover the limitations of the complete
pipeline. Then, we asked six biologists/chemists to
use Vapur and rate its different aspects to demonstrate the success and usefulness of Vapur for future
research.
Our inspection of 41 sample sentences indicated
that most of the incorrect relation labels were due
to incorrect entity assignment by BERN. In some
cases, parts of the protein sequence such as Nterminal, carboxyl terminal or residue names such
as Asp238 are recognized as compounds. Table 7
illustrates sample sentences with incorrectly labeled entities. Other examples that were manually
checked by a domain expert are presented in the
Appendices.
In order to evaluate the real-life usefulness of
Vapur, we asked six domain experts to use Vapur
for five COVID-19 related queries (totalling up to
30) of their own. They each filled in a questionnaire where for each query they indicated (i) if
each of the top three search results is related to the
query, (ii) if similar molecules predicted by Vapur
are in fact useful, and (iii) if the extracted sentences
are useful. They also rated the ease of use of Vapur between 1 (very difficult) and 5 (very easy)
and assessed its usefulness for future research on
COVID-19.
The expert evaluations demonstrated that 27 out
of 30 (90%) top search results and 76 out of 902
(84%) top three search results are biochemically
related to the query, suggesting that Vapur successfully retrieves biochemically related entities
to the query. During these experiments, Vapur retrieved at least one related document for each query.
It returned only one result for two of the queries,
which caused 4 of the 14 unsuccessful cases. These
evaluations suggest that the inverted index of Vapur spans a comprehensive range of entities and
contains sufficient number of documents to find a
biochemically related result for each of the tested
queries.
For each of the 30 queries of the domain experts,
5 similar molecule predictions are returned, resulting in a total of 150 molecule predictions. The
questionnaire results indicated that 78 out of 150

We further investigated the performance of our
relation extraction model by computing the test accuracy per CPR category and illustrate the results
in Table 6. We observe that the relation extraction
model achieved the highest accuracy in the Other
category, indicating that the model can successfully
identify whether the context is sufficient to deduce
a relation between the entities or not. We relate
the high performance for the Other category by
using a contextual model for relation representation, BioBERT. Context-awareness enables Vapur
to eliminate the documents that mention the queried
entity in irrelevant contexts and to retrieve a document only if it contains relation information for the
query.

(52%) similar molecule predictions were identified
as correct by the domain experts. For 14 out of
30 queries, 4 or 5 of the predicted molecules were
identified as correct suggesting that Vapur was able
to identify similar molecules successfully for about
half of the queries. On the other hand, for 9 out
of 30 queries, none of the similar molecule predictions were identified as correct by the domain
experts. We should note that the definition of “similarity” may be subjective. Here, Vapur extracts
similar molecules if they are contextually similar
to the query molecule. Therefore, the molecules
may or may not be structurally similar.
The evaluation further showed that for 22 out
of the 30 queries (73%) the extracted sentences
are useful for research. Besides, the experts unanimously expressed that Vapur is very easy to use
(5/5) and useful for future research.
Overall, both manual inspection and expert evaluations showed that Vapur can successfully find
biochemically related proteins and chemicals in
CORD-19 and can help future research on COVID19.

Conclusion

We present Vapur, a search engine with an emphasis on identifying protein - chemical relations in
the COVID-19 domain. To the best of our knowledge, Vapur is the first search engine that uses relation extraction to construct an inverted index of related biochemical entities beyond knowledge bases.
Thanks to the relation extraction model, Vapur is
able to categorize documents relevant to a query by
biochemical entities related to it.
We evaluated the relation extraction model
on ChemProt and observed that BioBERT-based

model has the highest performance. Expert evaluation of the sample annotated sentences from CORD19 showed that Vapur successfully finds relations
between entities when the entities are identified and
normalized accurately. Finally, six domain experts
used Vapur with 5 different queries and expressed
that Vapur is easy to use, retrieves results that are
related to the queries, and it is useful for future
research.
Although we focused on COVID-19 in this
work, our approach can find application in any
biomedical domain with a different choice of
database to index. We believe that domain-specific
scientific search engines will gain more interest
in the future since COVID-19 is unlikely to be
the last global health crisis. Consequently, we
plan to improve Vapur by integrating full-papers,
developing more robust named entity recognizers and normalizers, and indexing text databases
on different domains. In order to help similar efforts, we make the underlying pipeline
and Vapur available at https://github.com/
boun-tabi/vapur and https://tabilab.cmpe.
boun.edu.tr/vapur/, respectively.

The N-terminal domain of the coronavirus nucleocapsid (N) protein
adopts a fold resembling a right
hand with a flexible, positively

Alanine substitution of either Arg76 or Tyr-94 in the N-terminal domain of IBV N protein led to a
significant decrease in its RNAbinding activity and a total loss of
the infectivity of the viral RNA to
Vero cells.
Rat microsomal aldehyde dehydrogenase (msALDH) has no aminoterminal signal sequence, but instead it has a characteristic hydrophobic domain at the carboxyl

The IMPDH inhibitor merimepodib (MMPD) is an investigational antiviral drug that acts as
a noncompetitive inhibitor of IMPDH.

Thus, EMA/PMA treatments offer
a new approach to lower the amplifiable hg/cont in clinical samples
and increase the success of PVDA
and HTS to identify viruses.

A role for glycosylation in cellsurface tetherin expression is supported by tunicamycin treatment,
which inhibits the first step of Nlinked glycosylation and impairs
both cell-surface expression and
antiviral activity.
The effects of cholesterol depletion and PI3K/AKT signaling
pathway activation during S.
agalactiae-human
umbilical
vein endothelial cells (HUVEC)
interaction were analysed by
pre-treatment
with
methylβ-cyclodextrin (Mβ CD) or
LY294002 inhibitors, immunofluorescence
and
immunoblot
analysis.
Inhibition of complex-type glycosylation with kifunensine, an inhibitor of the oligosaccharide processing enzyme mannosidase 1,
had no effect on either the cellsurface expression or antiviral activity of tetherin.
Conversely, results from cell-based
small molecule screening studies
have shown that the antibiotic hexachlorophene can down-regulate bcatenin in colon cancer cells.
The CT of tetherin contains an
”STS” sequence that is implicated in ubiquitylation, and a
highly-conserved tyrosine-based
motif, ”YxxY”, that is essential for
clathrin-dependent endocytosis of
tetherin, and activation of nuclear
factor-κB (NF-κB) [16] [17] [18]
[19] .
Here we report that hexachlorophene also counteracts
the elevated bcatenin levels in
EBV-infected B lymphomas.
Our results suggest that Siah-1
is targeted by both LMP-1 and
hexachlorophene with opposite effects.

The hexachlorophene modulation
of Siah-1 and b-catenin is independent of p53 and results in reduced
expression of cyclin-D1 and c-Myc
(target genes of b-catenin), leading to the growth arrest of B lymphoma cells.
Alanine substitution of either Arg76 or Tyr-94 in the N-terminal domain of IBV N protein led to a

Rat microsomal aldehyde dehydrogenase (msALDH) has no aminoterminal signal sequence, but instead it has a characteristic hydrophobic domain at the carboxyl

Also, the protease Factor Xa, a
target of Ben-HCl abundantly expressed in infected cells, was able
to cleave the recombinant and
pseudoviral S protein into S1 and
S2 subunits, and the cleavage was
inhibited by Ben-HCl.
Since the 3a protein forms ion
channels, we were interested to see
any conformational changes occurring in the Cyot3a upon calcium
binding, using fluorescence spectroscopy and circular dichroism.
These studies clearly indicate a significant change in the conformation of the Cyto3a protein after
binding with calcium.
Our results strongly suggest that
the cytoplasmic domain of the 3a
protein of SARS-CoV binds calcium in vitro, causing a change in
protein conformation.
Further, the drug hexamethylene amiloride (HMA), but not
amiloride, inhibited in vitro ion
channel activity of some synthetic
coronavirus E proteins, and also
viral replication.

The high prevalence of variants
in the G6PD gene found in this
analysis suggests that it may be
a significant interaction factor in
clinical trials of chloroquine and
hydrochloroquine for treatment of
COVID-19 in Africans.
In an effort to circumvent resistance to rapamycin -an mTOR
inhibitor -we searched for novel
rapamycindownstream-targets that
may be key players in the response
of cancer cells to therapy.
We found that rapamycin, at nM
concentrations, increased phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2a in rapamycinsensitive and estrogen-dependent
MCF-7 cells, but had only a minimal effect on eIF2a phosphorylation in the rapamycininsensitive triple-negative MDA-MB-231
cells.
Addition of salubrinal -an inhibitor of eIF2a dephosphorylationdecreased expression of a surface marker associated with capacity for self renewal, increased
senescence and induced clonogenic cell death, suggesting that excessive phosphorylation of eIF2a
is detrimental to the cells’ survival.
Treating cells with salubrinal enhanced radiation-induced increase
in eIF2a phosphorylation and
clonogenic death and showed that
irradiated cells are more sensitive
to increased eIF2a phosphorylation
than non-irradiated ones.
Similar to salubrinal -the phosphomimetic eIF2a variant -S51D
-increased sensitivity to radiation, and both abrogated radiationinduced increase in breast cancer
type 1 susceptibility gene, thus
implicating enhanced phosphorylation of eIF2a in modulation of
DNA repair.

In addition to its effect on radiation, salubrinal enhanced eIF2a
phosphorylation and clonogenic
death in response to the histone
deacetylase inhibitor -vorinostat.
Finally, the catalytic competitive inhibitor of mTOR -Ku0063794 -increased phosphorylation of eIF2a demonstrating further
the involvement of mTOR activity
in modulating eIF2a phosphorylation.
Moreover, glycyrrhizin treatment
still enhanced IFN-γ and reduced
IL-4 levels in glycyrrhizin-treated
mice.
While determining the 5’ ends of
C. elegans actin mRNAs, we have
discovered a 22 nucleotide spliced
leader sequence.
The actin mRNA leader sequence
is identical to the first 22 nucleotides of a novel 100 nucleotide
RNA transcribed adjacent, and in
the opposite orientation, to the 5S
ribosomal gene.
The evidence suggests that the
actln mRNA leader sequence is acquired from this novel nucleotide
transcript by an intermolecular
frans-splicing mechanism.
We found that the aspartic acid at
position 95, previously believed to
be required for binding of PSGs
to cells, is not required for PSG1
activity but that the amino acids implicated in the formation of a salt
bridge within the N-domain are essential for PSG1 function.
In vitro expression of a construct

In contrast, conversion of LC3I/LC3-II could be significantly inhibited by 4-PBA, an ER stress
inhibitor, indicating that ORF3induced autophagy is dependent on
ER stress response.
All the studied molecules could
bind to the active site of the SARSCoV-2 protease (PDB: 6Y84),
out of which rutin (a natural
compound) has the highest inhibitor efficiency among the 33
molecules studied, followed by
ritonavir (control drug), emetine
(anti-protozoal), hesperidin (a natural compound), lopinavir (control drug) and indinavir (anti-viral
drug).
Using degenerate PCR primers
complementary to the most conserved genome regions of adenoviruses, the complete nucleotide
sequence of the penton base gene,
and partial nucleotide sequences of
the DNA polymerase, hexon, and
pVII genes were obtained.
Estradiol is connected with CD4+
T cell numbers and increases T-reg
cell populations, affecting immune
