Abstract
COVID-19 has become one of the most widely
talked about topics on social media. This research characterizes risk communication patterns by analyzing the public discourse on
the novel coronavirus from four Asian countries: South Korea, Iran, Vietnam, and India,
which suffered the outbreak to different degrees. The temporal analysis shows that the official epidemic phases issued by governments
do not match well with the online attention on
COVID-19. This finding calls for a need to analyze the public discourse by new measures,
such as topical dynamics. Here, we propose
an automatic method to detect topical phase
transitions and compare similarities in major
topics across these countries over time. We examine the time lag difference between social
media attention and confirmed patient counts.
For dynamics, we find an inverse relationship
between the tweet count and topical diversity.

Introduction

The novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has
affected global health and the economy. Social
media and Internet usage to seek and share information about the virus have increased massively (Lazer et al., 2018), leaving them to be an
excellent medium to examine the patterns of risk
communication during a pandemic. Unfortunately,
unconfirmed and intentional spread of false information can be seen on these platforms, jeopardizing
public health. Studies have shown that people tend
to share misinformation faster and more profoundly
than real information (Vosoughi et al., 2018; Kwon
et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2018). The sheer amount
of information and a mixture of right and wrong
confuses people of what safety health guidelines to
follow. A new term named Infodemic, which com∗

bines information and pandemic, has been newly introduced to describe this phenomenon1 . In practice,
Infodemic has already heavily impacted on society. For instance, the rhetoric of misinformation on
COVID-19 has shifted from false preventive measures to the anti-vaccination movement (Stecula
et al., 2020) and vandalism towards telecommunication infrastructures (Ahmed et al., 2020).
In this research, we gathered data from social media to understand public discourse on the pandemic.
Understanding the public concern will help determine which unproven claims or misinformation
to debunk first, which contributes to fighting the
disease. Primarily, we aim to discern what people
say in the wild. For instance, identifying prevalent
misinformation in a handful of countries first can
help debunk the same piece of misinformation in
other countries before the misinformation becomes
a dominant topic and poses a threat to public health.
To detect timely topics by phase, we need to
decide temporal phases first that can well reflect
the real events and prevailing circumstances. If
epidemic phases issued by each government are
credible, we can directly use them. Otherwise, we
can think of an alternative approach where we extract topics corresponding to the decided temporal
phases by utilizing natural computational language
processing methods. Based on those topics, we provide implications of the unique traits of risk communication locally and globally. This attempt helps
to alleviate the propagation of false claims that can
threaten public safety amid the COVID-19 pandemic. In this light, we have set up the following
four research questions. Note that the developed
codes can be accessed via Multimedia Appendix 1
and a GitHub page2 .

Issue Attention Cycle. The issue attention cycle
model can provide a pertinent theoretical framework for our analyses (Downs, 1972). The model
conceptualizes how an issue rises into and fades
away from the center of public attention. In the
first stage, labeled as the pre-problem stage, an
undesirable social condition (e.g., the appearance
of COVID-19) emerges but has not yet captured
much public attention. The second stage, alarming
discovery and euphoric enthusiasm, occur when a
triggering event (e.g., the national spike of newly
confirmed cases of COVID-19 or WHO’s a statement on COVID-19) heightens public awareness
of the issue. In the third stage, realizing the cost of
significant progress, people begin to recognize the
hardship that requires a significant restructuring of
society and significant sacrifices of some groups in
the population to solve the problem. This causes a
gradual decline of intense public interest, the fourth
stage. In the final stage, the post-problem stage, the
current issue is replaced by a new one and moves
into a twilight zone of lesser public attention.
Not all issues follow the five stages of the issue
attention cycle (Nisbet and Huge, 2006). As the
cyclical patterns of public attention evolve, a wide
array of public discourse has been found across
multiple issues of climate change (McComas and
Shanahan, 1999), emerging technologies (Anderson et al., 2012; Wang and Guo, 2018), and public
health risks (Shih et al., 2008; Arendt and Scherr,
2019). There are also cultural differences (Jung Oh
et al., 2012). Despite these fragmented findings, issue attention cycle provides insights on how public
attention dramatically waxes and wanes. An issue
that has gone through the cycle is different from
the issues that have not, with two respects, at least.
https://github.com/dscig/COVID19_tweetsTopic.

First, amid the time that the issue earned the national prominence, new institutions, programs, and
measures would have been developed to deal with
the situation. These entities are likely to persist
even after public attention has shifted elsewhere,
thus having persistent societal impacts afterward.
Second, these entities’ prolonged impacts are subject to what was heavily discussed when the issue
was the primary public concern.
With this regard, scholars need to look at the
specifics of public conversations about a target issue. Although the issue attention cycle was initially
conceived concerning traditional media, including
newspapers and televisions, there is burgeoning
literature applying the model to social media platforms. Most notably, in Twitter, the public is increasingly turning to for information seeking and
sharing without the gate-keeping process (David
et al., 2016). Twitter conversations, as such, are
more resonating with real-world word-of-mouth. It
is not uncommon for journalists to refer to social
media in their news stories. Research consistently
finds that Twitter takes the initiative and greater
control over public discourse, especially in the
early stages of the issue-attention cycle (Jang et al.,
2017; Wang and Guo, 2018). Building on these
prior studies, we analyze the volume of Twitter
conversations about COVID-19 to demonstrate an
issue attention cycle on a social media platform.
COVID-19-related Analyses. Many studies
have looked into the impact of the pandemic on
various aspects. Some researchers have focused on
predicting the transmissibility of the virus. One
work estimated the viral reproduction number (R0 )
of the virus. It showed R0 of SARS-CoV-2 seems
to be already more substantial than that of SARSCoV, which was the cause of the SARS outbreak
firstly found in the Guangdong province of China
in 2002 (Liu et al., 2020). Another work claims that
by reducing 90% of travel worldwide, the spread
of epidemic could be significantly reduced, via a
stochastic mathematical prediction model of the
infection dynamics (Chinazzi et al., 2020).
Other lines of works are about understanding the
propagation of misinformation related to COVID19. One study modeled the spread of misinformation about COVID-19 as an epidemic model on
various social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Reddit, and Gab; it showed that
users interact with each other differently and consume information differently depending on the plat-

forms (Cinelli et al., 2020). In this light, media platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter claim
to be trying to bring people back to a reliable source
of medical information. To do so, they have direct
communication lines with CDC and WHO (Frenkel
et al., 2020).
When narrowing down to local-specific matters,
one article claims that the fake news online in
Japan has led to xenophobia towards patients and
Chinese visitors, based on the qualitative analysis upon Japanese online news articles (Shimizu,
2020). Meanwhile, a work surveyed with 300,000
online panel members in 2015, South Korea, while
the MERS outbreak was prevalent in this country,
and claimed that if the information from public
health officials is untrustworthy, people rely more
on online news outlets and communicate more via
social media (Jang and Baek, 2019).
Another report argued that the public could not
appreciate the information shared by public health
officials due to prevalent misinformation on fake
cures and conspiracy theories (Analytica). The efficacy of the response to restrain this Infodemic
varies from country to country and depends on public confidence in the authorities. There is an attempt
to compare three countries in terms of political
bias. The authors conducted a large-scale survey
across the US, the UK, and Canada. Statistically,
they found that although political polarization of
COVID-19 exists in the US and Canada, the exact
belief in COVID-19 is broadly related to the quality of an individual’s reasoning skills, regardless of
political ideology (Pennycook et al., 2020).
Many types of datasets are released to the public,
as well as the research communities. One research
crawled and opened tweet information from ten languages with the COVID-19-relevant keywords for
around three months (Chen et al., 2020). Another
work collated over 59K academic articles, including over 47K full research papers about COVID19, SARS-CoV-2, and the related Coronavirus issues (Wang et al., 2020) [27].

Our focus is on South Korea, Iran, Vietnam, and
India. These are all Asian countries, and thereby,
we can control covariates concerning significant
differences shown on social media between Western and Asian cultures (Cho and Park, 2013; Li
et al., 2018). These four countries were unique in
terms of dealing with the current outbreak. In Iran,
the number of confirmed cases has gradually increased since the first confirmed case, whereas in
Vietnam, the numbers have consistently stayed (relatively) low. There was an abrupt increase in the
numbers after the first confirmed case in Korea, but
it seems they have successfully flattened the rising
curve of confirmed cases, unlike other countries. In
India, the situation had been relatively mild until
mid-Mar, since then, there has been a drastic surge.
We have set up two keywords, “Corona” and
“Wuhan pneumonia” to crawl tweets (see Table 1
to find exact keywords used for crawling tweets
for each country) and collected tweets for the three
months from January to March in 2020.

Pipeline for Detecting Topical Phases
then Extracting Topics

The data collection pipeline includes the following
four modules to eventually extract and label
major topics for certain phases, as shown in Figure 1. This process is repeated for all four countries.
Preprocessing Data. To extract topics from the
collected tweets by NLP, we first need to tokenize
the data, which can be defined as converting data
to the smallest units that have meaning. We have
filtered unnecessary textual information like stop
tweets from the first tweet in March 2006. See also
https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/search/.

Figure 1: The pipeline of the topic analysis.

words, special characters (non-letters), special
commands, and emojis. We then utilize the existing
Python tokenizer libraries corresponding to each
specific language. Detailed information about the
language-specific tokenizers is explained at the
provided web link.
Decide Topical Phases. The next step is to set
up specific target phases divided by dates to extract
topics. This is nontrivial since there are multiple
fluctuations and changes on the topics reflecting
the real events such as an increase in COVID-19
patients. Furthermore, we do not consider to use the
epidemic phases announced by governments since
the offline epidemic phases seem not to capture the
actual online topic trends, as will be explained at
the forthcoming Basic Daily Trends section.
We, therefore, devise a bottom-up approach to
decide dates that show the sign of sudden increases
in the daily volume of the tweets. We set up two
learnable parameters of the first derivatives (hereafter velocity) and the second derivatives (hereafter acceleration) of the daily tweet volumes, as
illustrated in the formulas below where D is a day,
t is a target date, and t − 1 is one past date from t.
# of tweett − # of tweett−1
Dt − Dt−1
velocityt − velocityt−1
acceleration =
Dt − Dt−1
velocity =

(1)

We reckoned the velocity and acceleration values when the first confirmed case was announced as
the ground truths (GT) by country. The intuition of
this approach is that the velocity and acceleration
values are proxies to unique communication traits
for each country in terms of a specific subject (i.e.,
COVID-19 in our case). Once they have been computed from the first confirmed date, they would be
the same for the following period.
We have set up joint thresholds for velocity
and acceleration to find dates that show while
velocity is still smaller than the velocityGT ,
acceleration becomes more substantial than the
accelerationGT : 0 < velocity < velocityGT &

acceleration > accelerationGT . In this light, we
learn two parameters from the first confirmed
date by country then detect other dates that
can be conjectured as the start of forthcoming
topical phases. When learning parameters, for
velocity, we round down the velocityGT value
and add 1. For acceleration, we round down the
accelerationGT , which is similar to the loss minimization concept of the machine-learning approach
(i.e., a learning process is finished by one step).
We adopted a low-pass filter with 0.2 as the
low-frequency threshold to remove noisy signals
to smoothen the data. Finally, the temporal data
was divided into topical phases (See Appendix 1 to
find the computed daily velocity and acceleration
trends and decided phases accordingly by country).
Extract Topics – Model Topics. We have utilized the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) for the
topic modeling task. The LDA is a well-known
machine-learning method to extract topics amid
given textual documents (i.e., a collection of discrete data-points) – tweets in our case (Ostrowski,
2015). The LDA generates and maximizes the joint
probability between the word distribution of topics
and the topic distribution of documents (Blei et al.,
2003). The number of topics for each phase is a
hyperparameter. We have set the range of the number of topics is between 2 and 50, and calculate
perplexity (PPL), probability of how many tokens
can be placed at the next step (i.e., indicating the
ambiguity of the possible next token). PPL is a
well-known metric to optimize a language model
with a training practice (Adiwardana et al., 2020).
During the iteration, we have fixed the minimum required frequency of words among the entire tweets
for each phase to be 20 and the epoch number for
each topic to be 100, respectively. We then decide
the optimum number of topics for each phase by
choosing the minimum PPLs.
As a result, we have decided on the number of
topical phases and the corresponding optimized
number of topics for each phase, as presented in
Table 2. For example, in the case of South Korea,
after the number of phases was decided as four
from the ‘Decide Topical Phases’ module, the
optimized number of topics is computed for each
phase as 2, 41, 15, and 43, respectively.
Extract Topics – Label Topics. This step involves labeling the main themes for the extracted

each topic and to analyze the semantic trends. We
first sorted all tweets with the estimated topic numbering by descending order (i.e., tweets with larger

into a higher category. The final count of themes
is shown in the third row for each country in Table 2. Besides, if one topic corresponds to several

Basic Daily Trends

We first depict the trends by plotting the daily
number of tweets (see Figure 2). We then see the
daily tweet counts, and the daily number of the
COVID-19 confirmed cases simultaneously by
country, as depicted in Figure 3–6: adding to the
two trends, we include official epidemic phases
announced by each government as vertical lines.
We confirmed that the tweet trends are associated
with the confirmed case trends by seeing the tweet
and confirmed case trends. Yet, the epidemic
phases do not explain the tweet trends accurately.
South Korea. The first COVID-19 patient was
reported on January 20, 20205 . This explains why
the tweet count remains relatively low during early
January, and it increases mainly only after late Jan5

uary (see Figure 3). On January 25, the Korean
government issued a travel warning on Wuhan and
the Hubei province, as well as the suggested evacuation of Korean citizens from those areas, which
was primarily discussed on Twitter. On February
18, the numbers increased sharply due to the 31st
confirmed case, which was related to a cult religious group "Shincheonji" in Daegu city. After the
31st confirmed case had been found, the quarantine
authority tried rigorous testing focusing on Daegu,
and the number of the confirmed cases were drastically increasing until mid-March. The tweet trends
follow the same pattern. However, the official epidemic phases announced by the government, divided by the vertical dash lines in the figure, seem
to lag from the increasing number of tweets. This
pattern shows that the official epidemic phases do
not match well with online attention.

changes across time with plots for the four target
countries. One plot shows daily trends based on
the number of tweets. In contrast, another plot
shows the trends based on the number of tweets
that contained mentions of country names like the
U.S. Overall, as people increasingly talk more on
the COVID-19 outbreak (i.e., the daily number
of tweets increase), the topics people talk about
become less diverse.

South Korea. The data yielded a total of four
topical phases, which are used in Figure 7. Phase 0
has no related topic. Then from Phase 1 to Phase
3, the number of topics diverged as 8, 5, and 11. In
Phase 1, people talk much about personal thoughts
and opinions linked to the current outbreak, and
they cheered each other. On Phase 2, as the crisis
going up to its peak, people talked less on personal issues and mainly talked about political and
celebrity issues. The political issues were about
shutting down the borders of South Korea for China
and other countries for Korea. On Phase 3, as the
daily number of tweets becomes smaller than Phase
2, people tended to talk on more diverse topics, including local and global news. In particular, people
were worried about hate crimes directed towards
Asians in Western countries. People might be interested in different subjects as they think the crisis
seems to be off the peak.

Other countries. We repeat the same analysis
and interpret the results for other cases, Iran, Vietnam, and India, as depicted in Figure 8–10. See
Appendix 3 for the derived topical trend graphs and
the detailed corresponding explanations by country.

tweets.

We see the daily trends on the mention of other
countries by counting the tweets remarking on
other country’s name, either in their local languages
or in English. Korea, China, and Japan were mostly
mentioned, and we suspect that political and diplomatic relationships mainly triggered it. Meanwhile,
the US and Italy similarly were steadily mentioned
across the three months, and the media outlets
broadcasting global news affect this phenomenon.

Discussion

We have analyzed tweets to understand the public
discourse on the COVID-19 pandemic. In South

Korea, the daily numbers of tweets reached local
maxima with major offline events. However, in the
case of Iran and Vietnam, the tweet counts did not
synchronize well with offline events. It may be because Twitter is not as widely used in these two
countries. Overall, it is interesting to observe that
peaks in Twitter data do not necessarily correlate
with significant events identified by local governments. Therefore, we use a bottom-up approach to
explore the topical phrases which resonate with the
flow of the open views.
After extracting the topical phases, number 4 in
South Korea, 2 in Iran, 6 in Vietnam, and 3 in India, respectively, we used the LDA, and found the
optimum number of topics for each topical phase,
and then labeled the corresponding topics with appropriate themes. In general, as people talk more
about COVID-19, the topics they refer to tend to be
smaller in number. This was more apparent when
tweet depth value is used for phases, as presented
in Table 2. Tweet depth is defined as the number of
retweets per day divided by the number of tweets
per day. It can be deemed as a standardized cascading depth, and therefore, the more considerable
value signifies the greater extent of the depth for
one tweet. From the case from South Korea and
Vietnam, we could verify the observation as tweet
depth tends to get larger when people communicate
more on COVID-19. This phenomenon reaffirms
another research that found the diameter value of
the online Coronavirus network was lower than
that of others (Park et al., 2020). However, for Iran
and India, the number of phases were too small to
observe the topical trends’ general traits.
Moreover, we found that the daily tweet trend
peak succeeded in the daily confirmed cases. In
Iran, Vietnam, and India, the peak of the daily
tweet trend preceded the peak of the daily confirmed cases up to a few weeks. Although the two
peaks are close to each other in South Korea, it is
worth noting that around that time, the country was
becoming the most affected by COVID-19 outside
mainland China. Interestingly, as shown in Figure
3-6, the upsurge of the number of tweets in South
Korea, Iran, and Vietnam (except India) was simultaneously observed at the end of February, before
the upsurge of the locally confirmed cases. Given
that COVID-19 is a global issue, this suggests that
the issue attention cycle of COVID-19 on a social
media platform is more responsive to global events
than local ones. In this regard, the COVID-19 pan-

demic offers an exciting opportunity for future research to theorize the issue attention cycle model
on a global scale and see how it evolves in conjunction with local specific topics such as increasing or
decreasing confirmed cases, government measures,
and social conflicts.
When comparing South Korea and Vietnam,
there is an intriguing point to discuss. The topic
of Phase 0 in Korea was not related to COVID-19,
whereas Vietnam was about global news with confirmed cases. We do not attempt to generalize any
findings due to the small tweet volume in Phase
0 for both countries. Still, Vietnamese users discussed the global epidemic issue more from the
first place, and this tendency affects successful defending against pandemic later on.
To be specific to each country, in case of South
Korea, when the local pandemic (offline) situation
has become severe (Phase 2), the number of topics
becomes smaller, which means people focus more
on a handful of issues. A unique trait can be observed that in the (phase 0), people cheered each
other up and hustled to express solidarity in the
difficult times. In the case of Iran, the number of
topics has been relatively steady across time, while
the significant topics discussed have been confined
to news and information: we interpret that Iranian
users tend to be cautious about using social media.
In case of Vietnam, at Phase 4, where the tweet
traffic is relatively lower as compared to the Phase
3, the number of topics becomes more substantial,
and the themes of topics become less direct to the
confirmed and death tolls, e.g., people talked about
the economy in Phase 2 and 4. Meanwhile, the
Indian case indicates another unique trait: many
topics were mainly related to misinformation, the
scale of which was much lower in other countries.
A large portion of misinformation, disinformation,
and hateful contents is steadily observed on both
Phase 1 and 2 (see Multimedia Appendix 3).

Concluding Remark

There are several limitations to be considered. First,
we analyzed tweets solely from the four countries,
and therefore, we need to be cautious about addressing explanations and insights that can be applied
in general. We plan to extend the current study by
including more countries. Second, there are other
ways to decide the topical phases. Our approach can
be aligned with the issue attention cycle as we compute unique communication traits (i.e., velocity

and acceleration by country) that would be relatively consistent in a pandemic of COVID-19.
Nonetheless, the current research provides a
valuable picture of critical topics from multiple
countries on COVID-19. We automatically divide
topical phases and extract major topics by phase.
We then find several issues that were uniquely manifested in the recent pandemic crisis by each country. For instance, we may discover the emergence
of misinformation in Hindi tweets. Our findings
shed light on understanding public concerns and
misconceptions under the crisis and, therefore, can
help determine what misinformation is to be discredited with priority. This attempt helps defeat the
Infodemic and limit the spread of the pandemic.

Appendix 2. Daily COVID-19 Confirmed
Case and Tweet Count Trends by
Country
Iran

On February 19, two people tested positive for
SARS-CoV-2 in the city of Qom6 . After this date,
we see a significant surge in the number of tweets,
and it reaches a peak in a few days (i.e., a peak
shown on February 25). On February 23, the government changed the alert from white to yellow.
Although the number of confirmed cases keeps increasing, the number of tweets starts to decrease
gradually with a little fluctuation, as shown in Figure 4. Therefore, the trends of these two numbers
show different patterns in contrast to Korean tweets.
Meanwhile, the government gradually increased
preventive measures, and several cities with the
highest rate of infection were announced hot spots
or red zones. Overall, they did not place the whole
country under the red alert. However, the government announced new guidance and banned all trips
on March 25. On March 28, the president said that
20% of the country’s annual budget would be allocated to fight the virus, which might be implicitly
a sign of the red alert.
7.2.2

Vietnam

On January 23, 2020, Vietnam officially confirmed
the first two COVID-19 patients, who come from
Wuhan, China7 . After that, the number of tweets increased sharply and reached to peak in early February, as shown in Figure 5. Although a few new
cases were detected, the number of tweets tended
to decrease and remained stable. In the second half
of February, there are no new cases. However, the
number of tweets increased rapidly and created a
new peak. This peak could not remain for a long
time. Two possible reasons can explain this trend.
The first is that the pandemic has spread over the
world. The second is that the last cases in Vietnam were treated successfully. After a long time
with no new cases, Vietnam had confirmed continuously new cases in Hanoi and many other cities
from March 6. The number of tweets of this phase
increased again and remain stable at a relatively
higher level than the initial phase.

7.2.3 India
The first case of COVID-19 was confirmed on
January 30, 20208 . The number of cases quickly
rose to three on account of students returning from
Wuhan, China. Throughout February, no new cases
were reported, and the first weeks of March also
saw a relatively low number of cases. The number of cases, however, picked up numbers from the
fourth week of March, notable were the 14 confirmed cases of Italian tourists in the Rajasthan
province. This eventually led to the government of
India declaring a complete lock-down of the country. The daily number of tweets followed a similar
trend as that of the number of cases as depicted
in Figure 6. First confirmed cases around January
30, 2020, caused a sudden spike in the number of
tweets, that subsided in February. First COVID-19
fatality on March 12 and some other COVID-19
local events led to an exponential increase in tweets.
The tweets peaked on March 22 when the government declared lock-down of areas with infected
cases and started trending downwards after that.
It is strange that the government’s declaration of
nationwide lock-down on March 24 only caused
a small spike in the number of tweets and trend
continued downwards. However, March 31 saw a
significant spike in the number of tweets owing
to confirmation of mass infections in a religious
gathering. Overall, the tweet trends seem to be synonymous with the government’s release of official
information (e.g., # confirmed cases and fatalities
on COVID-19).

Appendix 3. Daily Topical Trends Shown
in Social Media by Country

7.3.1 South Korea
Please refer to the “Basic Daily Trends – South Korea” subsection in the manuscript for the detailed
descriptions.

Figure 15: Daily topical trends on South Korea: based
on % (top), based on # of tweets (mid), based on # of
tweets country names mentioned (bottom).

7.3.2 Iran
Figure 16 top and mid illustrate two topical phases,
their proportions, and daily topical frequencies in
Farsi tweets. Phase 0 includes global news about
China and unconfirmed local news that reflects the
fear of virus spread in the country. Political issues
form a remarkable portion of tweets in this phase,
as the country has been struggling with various internal and external conflicts in recent years, and
there was a congressional election in Iran. In phase
1, a significant increase in the number of tweets occurs, where local news regarding the virus outbreak
constitutes the majority. An intriguing finding is
that informational tweets about preventive measurements overshadow global news, which can be
explained by the sociology of disaster that when
people in a less developed country are at risk, they
naturally tend to share more information. However,
political tweets are still widespread because of the
reasons above and public dissatisfaction about the
government response to the epidemic. This finding
is also highlighted in Figure 16 bottom that the U.S.
is the most mentioned name after Iran and China.
One possible explanation is that the outbreak puts
another strain on the frail relationship between Iran
and the U.S.

Figure 16: Daily topical trends on Iran: based on % (top), based on # of tweets (mid), based on # of tweets country
names mentioned (bottom).

7.3.3 Vietnam
There are six topical phases with Vietnam, and they
are visualized as in Figure 17 top and mid. Phase 0
related to global news because, in this period, Vietnam did not have any cases. From phase 1 to phase
5, topics diverged separately, but they focused on
local news except phase 3. Phase 3 was the phase
when no new cases in Vietnam were detected. We
can see a common point of phase 0, and phase 3
is no new cases in Vietnam (local news), so tweets
tended to talk more about global news. Especially
in phase 3, we can see the increase of personal topics that most did not have in other phases. It was
because a conflict event that related to Korean visitors made a huge of personal tweets. Next, we show
the number of tweets that mentioned countries as
in Figure 17 bottom. The most three countries mentioned are Vietnam, Korea, and China. Vietnam and
China were mentioned frequently across phases because Vietnam is the local, and China is the original
place of the pandemic. Besides, Korea was mentioned in many tweets, but they concentrated only
on Phase 3. This is similar to topics changes due to
the Korean visitor event in Vietnam.

Figure 17: Daily topical trends on Vietnam: based on % (top), based on # of tweets (mid), based on # of tweets
country names mentioned (bottom).

7.3.4 India
We have established three topical phases for Hindiwritten tweets (Figure 18 top and mid). In case of
India, the starting phase mainly has tweets that are
focused on sharing information about COVID-19,
and global news about COVID-19 in China. People tended to share the news about COVID-19 and
useful information on how to be safe. Thereafter
in phase 1, the number of topics become more diverse. Although the topics in this phase are related
to information about the virus and global news, especially China, a large chunk of it is formed by
rumors or misinformation. The number of tweets
spike on January 30, 2020, when the first case was
confirmed in India. Towards the end of Phase 1 is
a spike in the number of tweets. This is primarily
due to the beginning of announcements of some
measures by the government to contain the virus
(such as halting issuing new Visas to India). Lastly,
in phase 2, a huge spike in the number of tweets is
witnessed. The proportion of informational tweets
decreases, whereas local news tweets confirming
new cases increases. Regrettably, a marked portion
of the tweets still consists of hateful content and
misinformation. Interestingly enough, although the
situation continued to worsen, tweets expressing
dissatisfaction with the government are negligible.
Phase 3 also witnesses an increase in the mentions of other countries, especially Brazil and Europe, in addition to China and understandably, India as depicted in Figure 18 bottom. This could be
attributed to a growing number of the confirmed
cases in Italy, Spain, and Brazil, as well as the
news surrounding the use of Hydroxychloroquine
in Brazil. The U.S. also finds considerable mentions due to the same reasons.

names mentioned (bottom).
