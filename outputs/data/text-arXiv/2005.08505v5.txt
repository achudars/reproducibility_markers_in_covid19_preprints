Abstract
We study how the COVID-19 pandemic, alongside the severe mobility restrictions that ensued, has impacted information access on Wikipedia, the world’s largest online encyclopedia. A longitudinal analysis that combines pageview
statistics for 12 Wikipedia language editions with mobility reports published by Apple and Google reveals massive shifts
in the volume and nature of information seeking patterns during the pandemic. Interestingly, while we observe a transient
increase in Wikipedia’s pageview volume following mobility
restrictions, the nature of information sought was impacted
more permanently. These changes are most pronounced for
language editions associated with countries where the most
severe mobility restrictions were implemented. We also find
that articles belonging to different topics behaved differently;
e.g., attention towards entertainment-related topics is lingering and even increasing, while the interest in health- and biology-related topics was either small or transient. Our results
highlight the utility of Wikipedia for studying how the pandemic is affecting people’s needs, interests, and concerns.

Introduction

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has
led to the implementation of unprecedented non-pharmaceutical interventions ranging from case isolation to national
lockdowns (Flaxman et al. 2020). These interventions, along
with the disease itself, have created massive shifts in people’s lives. For instance, in mid-May 2020, more than a third
of the global population was under lockdown (Liverpool et
al. 2020), and millions have since lost their jobs or have
moved to work-from-home arrangements (Hale et al. 2020).
This scenario has fueled an unprecedented effort to better understand the disease and its spread (Cohen 2020), as
well as to develop clinical treatments and vaccines (WHO
2020; Collins and Stoffels 2020). Yet, recent work suggests
that the impact of the pandemic transcends health-related issues (Ryan et al. 2020). Thus, research should also identify
how the pandemic has impacted human needs, interests, and
concerns. After all, many challenges of the COVID-19 crisis
did not originate directly from the virus, but from the social,
economic, and psychological implications of the measures
taken to prevent its spread (Bonaccorsi et al. 2020).

Figure 1: Wikipedia access vs. mobility — Association between increase in time spent at home (from Google mobility reports; red) and increase in Wikipedia access volume
(from Wikipedia pageview statistics; blue), both in terms
of relative change over a five-week baseline period in early
2020. Top: time series for Sweden/Swedish Wikipedia and
Italy/Italian Wikipedia; dotted vertical lines: changepoints
in mobility time series. Bottom: summary for 11 of the 12
languages studied (excluding English); x-axis: post-minuspre-changepoint difference in relative mobility change; yaxis: post-minus-pre-changepoint difference in total Wikipedia access volume (Pearson’s r = 0.63, p = 0.03).
Quantifying the impact of COVID-19 is particularly challenging due to its global nature: traditional survey-based
studies face the difficulty of scale, since participants ought
to be spread throughout the globe, and of immediacy, since
the pandemic is an ongoing crisis where needs, interests, and
concerns are dynamic (Diaz et al. 2016; Salganik 2019).
Unlike most previous events that directly impacted so many
lives around the world, the COVID-19 pandemic developed
in a time of widespread Internet access. This digitization
enables researchers to explore the impact of the pandemic
across society by analyzing how it has impacted users’ digital traces. For instance, Wikipedia, the world’s largest encyclopedia and one of the most visited sites on the Web, captures rich digital traces from readers and makes them publicly available in aggregated form. Wikipedia is used hun-

dreds of millions of times each day to address a wide spectrum of information needs, ranging from getting information
to make personal decisions to reading up on what was discussed in the media (Singer et al. 2017).

interventions (cf. Fig. 1). This increase, however, was transient: our careful differences-in-differences study suggests
that in the long run, there was either a decrease or no significant increase for 11 out of the 12 languages.

By analyzing Wikipedia access logs, we may thus study
how the shifts in needs, interests, and concerns brought by
COVID-19 have affected the readership of a key information
source on the Web, while addressing the challenges of scale
(since Wikipedia has versions for languages spoken all over
the globe) and immediacy (since the “always-on” nature of
usage logs allows us to analyze information seeking patterns
at any time).

Considering not the volume, but the nature of information seeking in Wikipedia (Sec. 4.2), as measured through
our “distance from normality” metric, we again observe the
same patterns: a sharp increase following mobility restrictions, followed by a decrease after mobility returns to normality. Yet, here, our differences-in-differences study suggests that part of the increase remained, suggesting that the
impact of the crisis on information seeking behavior persisted beyond mobility restrictions.

Present work. This work aims to elucidate how information
access patterns across 12 Wikipedia languages editions have
shifted during the current COVID-19 pandemic, in response
both to the disease itself and to the massive mobility restrictions imposed by governments. More specifically, we ask:

Lastly, we zoom in on what kinds of articles received more
or less attention throughout the pandemic (Sec. 4.3). We find
that some topics (e.g., BIOLOGY) saw transient increases or
decreases in volume, while others saw persistent increases
(e.g., VIDEO GAMES) or decreases (e.g., SPORT). Overall,
surprisingly, many of the topics with persistent increases relate not to basic needs related to the pandemic, but to entertainment and self-actualization.

• RQ1 How has the COVID-19 crisis impacted information
seeking behavior in Wikipedia?
• RQ2 Have changes in information seeking behavior
lasted after mobility restrictions were lifted?
We argue that a longitudinal understanding of information
seeking through the lens of Wikipedia is a starting point to
measure the impact of the pandemic and its associated interventions on information seeking behavior. Examining the
differences in the volume (i.e., how much?) and in the nature
(i.e., what?) of information seeking may shed light not only
on the needs, interests, behaviors, and concerns of people
throughout the crisis, but also on how the pandemic is shaping society in the long run. Also, observing what changes remained after mobility returned to normality can prove useful
to disentangle effects due to the lockdowns from the drifts
created by the pandemic itself.
Methods and data. Our analyses combine Wikipedia access
logs, mobility reports made available by Apple and Google,
and information on the dates of non-pharmaceutical interventions. We enrich the Wikipedia access logs in different
ways, categorizing articles as COVID-19-related or not, attributing articles to a series of predefined “topics”, and calculating how distant from normal is the distribution of views
over articles. Also, we calculate relevant points in time related to mobility change, capturing, for different countries,
when mobility suddenly decreased and when it returned to
normality. Methodologically, drawing meaningful conclusions from the longitudinal Wikipedia access logs is challenging due to the presence of trends and seasonalities. We
overcome these hurdles by performing careful differencein-differences analyses in a regression framework. We detail
our methods and the data employed in Sec. 3.
Findings. Our analysis of the number of pageviews over
time (Sec. 4.1) shows that there was a sharp increase in the
volume of Wikipedia usage, by up to 40%, following the
sudden decrease in mobility induced by non-pharmaceutical

We conclude by discussing our findings in the light of the
research questions and in the overall context of assessing the
social impact of the pandemic (Sec. 5). We make available
all the code and the data necessary to reproduce our results

Related work

We review related work that focused on the COVID-19 infodemic, work that measured changes in user behavior during
the pandemic, and, lastly, other research that studied Wikipedia in the general context of crises and pandemics.

2.1

The COVID-19 Infodemic

COVID-19 was the first event of its magnitude to take place
in the era of social media and of user-generated content. The
important role that platforms such as Twitter and Facebook
have in today’s society has prompted researchers to study
patterns of virality and of information sharing in social media during the pandemic.
Kouzy et al. (2020) studied the spread of COVID-19-related
misinformation on Twitter by analyzing a sample of tweets
(n = 673), collected in February 2020, with trending hashtags and keywords related to the disease, finding a high
prevalence of mis- or unverifiable information. Other studies
that followed have found similar and complementary results.
Yang, Torres-Lugo, and Menczer (2020) also found a high
prevalence of low-credibility information, which is disproportionally spread by bots. Ahmed et al. (2020) identified
and analyzed the drivers behind one of the main COVID-19related conspiracies, which postulates the spread of the infection to be related to the 5G standard for cellular networks.
Analyzing data containing conspiracy-related hashtags, they
found that a handful of users were driving the conspiratory
content and that many of those using the hashtag were denouncing the conspiracy theory.

Whereas these studies detected and measured content that
may impact behaviors and beliefs (e.g., conspiracy theories),
we focus on the inverse question: Can we uncover changes
in behavior via digital traces? We argue that both these directions are important to the overarching goal of understanding the social dynamics of the spread of the virus (Depoux
et al. 2020), since to understand the impact of misinformation, one must be capable of measuring people’s needs, interests, and concerns.

2.2

The Web in Times of COVID-19

Recent work has also more broadly characterized how
COVID-19 has altered people’s online behavior, and how
digital traces can be used to better understand the pandemic.
A first and broader theme in this direction concerns how
COVID-19 has increased Internet traffic. Feldmann et al.
(2021) showed that, as a result of COVID-19-induced lockdowns, Internet traffic of residential users increased by
15–20%. Traffic increases were observed in applications
that people use when at home, such as Web conferencing,
VPN, gaming, and messaging. Results in the same direction
were also found in survey-based studies analyzing Internet
time (Colley, Bushnik, and Langlois 2020), and by a smallerscale study measuring the increase in the stress on a campus
network (Favale et al. 2020).
Second, and more related to the work at hand, are works
leveraging digital traces to understand the impact of
COVID-19 on mental health, economy, society, and human
needs (Abay, Tafere, and Woldemichael 2020; Gupta et al.
2020; Tubadji, Boy, and Webber 2020). We highlight two recent papers based on search data. Lin, Liu, and Chiu (2020)
used Google search data on COVID-19-specific keywords to
predict the speed of the spread of the disease. They found,
e.g., that searches for “wash hands” are correlated with a
lower spreading speed of the disease. Suh et al. (2020) measured changes in human needs using Bing search logs. They
found that, for a variety of different “need categories”, there
was elevated increase in search activity, and that subcategories related to the most basic needs received the largest
boost.
The outlined related work is complementary to the study
at hand. Having signals from multiple distinct digital traces
such as network usage, social media activity, and search logs
may allow stakeholders to paint a more comprehensive picture of how the pandemic has impacted society.

2.3

Wikipedia in Times of Crisis

Finally, our work extends a rich literature studying behavioral changes of Wikipedia readers during unexpected
events, crises, and catastrophes (García-Gavilanes et al.
2017; Zhang et al. 2019). In work that is most closely related, researchers used Wikipedia pageviews in order to
monitor and forecast diseases at a global scale (Generous
et al 2014a,b) and to study anxiety and information seeking about infectious diseases, such as influenza (McIver and
Brownstein 2014), H1N1 (Tausczik et al. 2012), and Zika
(Tizzoni et al. 2020).

each Wikipedia version, and the number pageviews received
in 2019 (full year) and 2020 (January through July).
Resonating with existing work, our results highlight the integral role played by Wikipedia in times of crisis and its usefulness to understand how these events impacted the behavior of its readers. Moreover, it is worth noting that the difference-in-differences methodology we employ here may also
be of use for future research aimed at understanding how a
given crisis has impacted user behavior while accounting for
seasonal effects.

Materials and methods

Data

The analyses of this paper combine information about the
content and usage of Wikipedia with information about the
progression of the pandemic.
Wikipedia. We selected 12 languages that have Wikipedia
editions of various sizes. When choosing language editions,
we considered (1) the size of the edition, (2) whether the language was spoken in relatively few countries, (3) the kinds
of non-pharmaceutical interventions imposed in those countries. The overarching goal in selecting the languages was
to have relevant language editions representing different attitudes towards the crisis, preferably from languages easily
tied to one country. For each language edition, we obtained
publicly available pageview statistics,1 which specify how
frequently each article was accessed daily between 1 January 2018 and 31 July 2020, aggregating both the desktop
and the mobile versions of the site. The languages selected
as well as basic statistics for their Wikipedia editions are
listed in Table 1.
Enriching Wikipedia articles. To gain further insight into
which kinds of articles people are reading, we enriched our
pageview data with two additional sources. First, we labeled each article with one of 57 topics based on the ORES
article topic model.2 We collected the topic predictions (one page can belong to multiple topics) from the

Figure 2: Robust detection of mobility and normality
changepoints from Google and Apple mobility reports —
The reports specify by what percentage the time spent at
various location types has changed, compared to a baseline
period in January 2020. We use time series for all location
types, with multiple changepoint detection algorithms and
varying hyperparameters. Given the abruptness of the decrease in most countries, different runs largely agree; we use
the average as a robust changepoint. For languages spoken in
multiple languages, e.g., German (right), we average mobility time series from the main countries where the language
is spoken (here three), weighted according to the proportion
of native speakers (details in Appendix A).
model for each of the articles in English (the language for
which the model was developed) and linked articles across
the 12 languages studied. Second, we determined for each
article if it was related to the pandemic.3 Analyzing such articles separately allows us to disentangle the changes in Wikipedia usage due to seeking information about the COVID19 pandemic from other, perhaps less obvious patterns.
Pandemic timeline. Nine of the 12 languages are primarily
spoken in a single country. For each country, we used Wikipedia to manually determine five days of particular interest
in the context of COVID-19: first reported case, first death,
ban of public events, school closure, lockdown. Two problems with employing the aforementioned days of interest in
statistical analyses are (1) that it is not guaranteed that they
would impact movement patterns across different countries
homogeneously (e.g., it could be that for some of the countries people stayed more at home even before the lockdown
was enacted), and (2) that not all days of interest were observed for the countries of interest (e.g., in Sweden there has
been no country-wide lockdown by 31 July 2020).

cellphone location signals. The mobility reports specify, for
each day, by what percentage the time spent in various location types (e.g., residential areas, workplaces, retail and
recreation, etc.) differed from a pre-pandemic baseline period in early 2020. Both government-mandated lockdowns
as well as self-motivated social distancing measures manifest themselves as sharp changes in the mobility time series, which we detect automatically using changepoint detection algorithms (Fig. 2, left; details in Appendix A). We
henceforth refer to these points as mobility changepoints. We
use mobility changepoints as heuristic dates for when people started spending substantially more time in their homes.
Unlike choosing one of the days of interest, this leads to a
meaningful “treatment” across different countries.
Three of the 12 languages are spoken more widely than in
one predominant country: English, German, and French. As
Wikipedia pageview statistics are available only at the language level, not at the country level, we determined a mobility changepoint for these language editions by aggregating
mobility reports for the countries in which the language is
official (Fig. 2, right; details in Appendix A).
We emphasize that, since any Wikipedia edition can be accessed from anywhere (barring censorship), the link between Wikipedia language editions and countries is merely
approximate, even for languages that are official in only a
single country. This should be kept in mind when interpreting our results, especially for the English edition, which is
read widely across the globe.
Additionally, we calculated another important set of
“changepoints”, which do not represent abrupt changes in
mobility patterns, but rather corresponds to the times when
mobility returned to normal. We refer to these as normality changepoints (also depicted in Fig. 2). These times were
also calculated with mobility data, by identifying the time
when the future average mobility remained within a 10%
band around the respective baseline level (defined as the prepandemic mobility levels by Google and Apple). In cases of
languages spoken in multiple countries, we maintained the
same aggregation scheme as for mobility changepoints.

3.2

Difference-in-differences

Mobility reports. To address these limitations, we turn to
daily mobility reports published by Apple and Google,4
which capture population-wide movement patterns based on

We now introduce our study design. Difference-in-differences regression is a “quasi-experimental” technique that
mimics an experimental design with observational data by
studying the effect of a treatment (e.g., mobility changes) on
a treatment group vs. a control group (Angrist and Imbens
1995). The specific regression models are discussed as we
present results, whereas here we focus on explaining and justifying our setup, illustrated on the left-hand side of Fig. 4.

3 Based on the article list in https://covid-data.wmflabs.org. The
number of COVID-19-related articles varied substantially across
language editions; e.g., English had over 300, Swedish had only 9.
4 https://www.(apple|google).com/covid19/mobility/. We use
country-wise mobility data from January to the end of July for all
countries that have the languages chosen as official languages (see
Appendix A).

The difference-in-differences method aims at separating
the true treatment effect from simultaneous (e.g., seasonal)
changes that would have occurred even without the treatment. To do so, we calculate the post-minus-pre-treatment
difference (in 2020) and compare it to the difference between the corresponding time periods in the previous year
(2019). Subtracting the 2019 difference from the 2020 dif-

ference (yielding the “difference in differences”) thus removes changes that would have occurred even without the
intervention (assuming 2020 would otherwise have looked
like 2019) and gives a better estimate of the treatment effect.
In the first scenario, Fig. 4(a), we compare the difference in
activity five weeks before vs. five weeks after the mobility
changepoint. The idea here is to capture what changes were
introduced by the sudden halts in human mobility induced
by non-phamaceutical interventions. In the second scenario,
Fig. 4(b), we compare the difference five weeks after the mobility changepoint vs. five weeks after the normality changepoint. Here, we capture how information seeking patterns
changed as mobility restrictions waned. The third scenario,
Fig. 4(c), compares the difference in activity between two
scenarios where mobility was similar in 2020: five weeks
before the mobility changepoint and five weeks after the normality changepoint. Lastly the fourth scenario, Fig. 4(d), is
an adaptation of the first for events other than mobility (e.g.,
school closure or official lockdown declaration).
Notice that for some languages there were less than five
weeks in the data after the normality changepoint. In these
cases we used all data up to 31 July 2020 (and the same period of 2019).

3.3

Distance from Normality

We introduce a notion of “distance from normality” as follows. On each day, the pageviews in a given language edition
form a distribution over articles, characterizing how users’
attention was distributed. We represent each daily distribution as an “attention vector” with one entry per article and
entries summing to 1.
With over 6 million Wikipedia articles, many of which are
rarely visited, attention vectors are large and noisy. Therefore, we first applied principal component analysis (PCA)
in order to project attention vectors into a low-dimensional
subspace. In the subspace, two attention vectors are naturally
compared via their Euclidean distance.
The notion of “normal” attention is captured by the average
attention vector over all days of 2019, i.e., well before the
pandemic; and for each subsequent day, the distance from
normality is given by the Euclidean distance of that day’s attention vector from the average attention vector. Notice that
we calculated the attention vector separately for each Wikipedia language edition using all its articles and then performed the dimensionality reduction.
We use this metric in addition to the aforementioned topics to understand overall changes in the information seeking
patterns of Wikipedia users.

Results

Shifts in Overall Pageview Volume

We begin by examining the volume of information seeking
throughout the pandemic. To do so, we leverage the count
of pageviews across all articles for each of the 12 languages.
To distinguish between an increase in information seeking

about COVID-19-related articles vs. the remainder of Wikipedia, we analyze the two sets of articles separately.
Pageview trends in COVID-19-related articles. Wikipedia has been shown to be an accurate and up-to-date source
of COVID-19-related information,5 and we start by investigating how heavily this information was accessed by users.
Fig. 3 (column 1) tracks the popularity of COVID-19-related
articles (as a fraction of all pageviews) in all 12 languages
over the course of the pandemic, from 14 January (the earliest time for which mobility reports are available) to 31 July
2020. Vertical lines in the figure represent the dates associated with noteworthy events (e.g., first case), as well as
non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., lockdowns).
In nearly all languages, the share of COVID-19-related
pageviews increased up to the mobility changepoint (dashed
vertical line), from where their daily pageviews tended to
slightly decrease.6 The eventual return to normal levels of
mobility did not seem to have any sharp impact on the pageview share of these articles. We emphasize that these time
series are plotted on logarithmic y-scales, such that a linear
slope in the plots, even if small, corresponds to an exponential rate of change.
COVID-19-related articles were generally among the most
popular during the period of study; e.g., 12 of the 15 most accessed articles in the English version were related to the pandemic. In some languages, the fraction of pageviews going
to COVID-19-related articles surpassed 2% on some days,
a considerable share of Wikipedia’s overall volume, considering that all Wikipedia editions considered here have over
half a million articles (Table 1).
Pageview trends in non-COVID-19-related articles. Next,
we focus on Wikipedia articles not related to COVID-19, the
vast majority. Their popularity during the period of study, in
terms of the daily total number of pageviews, is shown as
solid lines in Fig. 3 (column 2; linear y-scales). The dotted
lines correspond to the same period in 2019, precisely one
year earlier.7 Notice that, in this plot, the y-scales vary per
language edition, since their sizes differ substantially.
A clear pattern emerges in many language editions. Access volumes in 2020 closely mirrored those in 2019 up
to the mobility changepoint associated with the respective
language. Thereafter, the access volumes of 2020 began to
rise up and above those of 2019 for nearly all languages.
The trend was particularly strong for languages spoken in
the countries with the most severe lockdown measures (e.g.,
Serbia, Italy, France), and weakest for languages spoken
5 https://wikimediafoundation.org/covid19/
6 Some languages saw extreme upticks on certain days. Most of
them can be linked to the creation of important COVID-19-related
articles; e.g., the Swedish article CORONAVIRUSUTBROTTET 2020
I SVERIGE (English: COVID -19 PANDEMIC IN SWEDEN ) was created on 22 March 2020 and immediately received wide attention.
7 Since Wikipedia access volumes tend to follow a weekly periodicity, our alignment was manually adjusted to ascertain that
matched days correspond to the same day of the week.

Figure 3: Evolution of Wikipedia access for 12 language — Column 1: percentage of pageviews spent on COVID-19-related
pages (logarithmic scale). Column 2: total number of pageviews for all other pages (linear scales); solid: 14 January to 31 July
2020; dotted: corresponding period in 2019. Column 3: cumulative difference in total number of pageviews between study
period of 2020 and corresponding period of 2019, reported in terms of multiples of average daily number of pageviews in 2019
(y-axes identical across languages, except for Serbian, where cumulative volume is much higher). Column 4: “distance from
normality” with respect to topical attention (cf. Sec. 4.2) for 2020 (solid) and 2019 (dotted). All plots show, as vertical lines,
mobility changepoints and pandemic-related events.
where mobility-related interventions were weaker than elsewhere (e.g., Japan, Scandinavia). Finally, once normality
was approximately restored (as indicated by the normality changepoint), we see that the pageview volume again
aligned itself with the quantities observed in the previous
year. Again, for countries with weaker lockdowns, the “back
to normality” effect is less noticeable since the pageview
counts never deviated substantially from the baseline pattern
to begin with.
We further explore this relationship in Fig. 3 (column 3) via
cumulative plots, where the daily 2020-minus-2019 difference is accumulated from 14 January onward. Since languages have vastly different access volumes overall (cf. column 2), and to have a common scale across languages,
we express the cumulative difference in terms of multiples
of the average daily pageview volume attained in 2019 by

the respective language. The increase is dramatic for some
languages; e.g., the Serbian Wikipedia edition experienced
about 57 days’ worth of surplus access volume between
mid-March and late July 2020, corresponding roughly to a
tripling in access volume, compared to the previous year.
Strong effects are also observed for Italian (27 surplus days
at its peak), French (21 days), Japanese (17 days), English
(13 days), Dutch (7 days), and Finnish (7 days). As mobility
returned to normality, the cumulative gain stabilized (e.g.,
Serbian, French) or even decreased (e.g., Dutch, Italian).
Note that eight of the 12 languages (Italian, Japanese,
Finnish, Dutch, German, Korean, Danish, Serbian) initially
ran a deficit, with Wikipedia being visited less in 2020 compared to the corresponding days in 2019 (reflected as negative values in the plots of column 3 of Fig. 3), but all except three languages (Norwegian, Swedish, Danish) recov-

Figure 4: Estimated effects of restricted mobility in pageviews and in attention — For the 12 studied language editions, we
depict the results of difference-in-differences for estimating effects of changepoints non-pharmaceutical intervention in the total number of pageviews (on the left) and in the distance from normality metric (on the right). Effects are shown for different
diffs-in-diffs setups illustrated in diagrams in the left-hand side (see Sec. 3.2 for details). Error bars represent 95% CIs approximated as 2 standard errors. Dependent variables are used in logarithmic form, such that exponentiated coefficients capture the
multiplicative increase due to the treatment. (R2 > 0.95 for all models.)
ered and eventually ran a surplus by the end of the study
period.
Difference-in-differences regression. In order to go beyond visual inspection and to precisely quantify the shifts
in pageview volume, we take a regression-based differencein-differences approach, as described in Sec. 3.2.
In this setup, we consider, for each language, a time window of 10 weeks (70 days) split around either the mobility
or the normality changepoint in 2020, as well as the corresponding time window in 2019. Each of these 140 days contributes one data point per language, for a total of 140×12 =
1,680 data points. As the dependent variable y, we use the
logarithm of the number of pageviews, and as independent
variables, the following three factors: year (2019 or 2020),
period (before or after calendar day of mobility changepoint), language. We now model y as a linear function of
these three factors and all their two- and three-way interactions. In R formula notation,
y ∼ year ∗ period ∗ language.

(1)

Here, a ∗ b is shorthand notation for a + b + a : b, where in
turn a : b stands for the interaction of a and b.

Pageview volumes were considered in logarithmic form for
two reasons: first, because raw pageview counts are far from
normally distributed, with numerous large outliers, and second, because the logarithm makes the model multiplicative,
thus implicitly normalizing the estimated effects and making it possible to compare languages with different pageview
volumes: if b is the coefficient of the three-way interaction
year : period : language, then eb captures the multiplicative factor by which pageview volumes increased when mobility dropped, after accounting for differences stemming
from the year alone or the period alone,8 which are already captured by the coefficients of year : language and
period : language, respectively.
The estimated logarithmic effects are plotted for all languages in Fig. 4(a) (column 1). The results confirm the effects observed visually in Fig. 3 (column 3); e.g., the logarithmic pre-vs.-post mobility changepoint effect on the Italian version is around 0.38 (corresponding to an increase in
pageviews to e0.38 ≈ 146%). For language editions where
8 For instance (cf. Fig. 3, column 2), Swedish pre-mid-March
pageviews were consistently lower in 2020 than in 2019; and
Finnish post-mid-March pageviews were higher than pre-midMarch pageviews even in 2019, without the pandemic.

the effect was less pronounced in the visual analysis, we also
find smaller (e.g., for Swedish the increase was to approximately 108%) or insignificant (e.g., Danish) effects. Another set of interesting cases are languages for which the increase in pageviews was substantial but more gradual, e.g.,
Japanese. Although Japanese saw a larger cumulative pageview difference than English (Fig. 3 column 3), here its effect is smaller (0.10 for Japanese vs. 0.16 for English).
In a similar fashion, Fig. 4(b) (column 1) shows the same
analysis, but now comparing the five-week period after the
mobility changepoint with the (up-to-)five-week period after the normality change point. Interestingly, the results of
this analysis are, to a large extent, diametrically opposite
of those of the above analysis. Whereas there (around the
mobility changepoint), Serbian and Italian saw the biggest
increases in pageview volume, here (around the normality
changepoint), they saw the biggest decreases. For instance,
the logarithmic effect is −0.43 for Italian (a multiplicative
decrease to e−0.43 ≈ 64% of the original value).
In Fig. 4(c) (column 1), we fit yet another model that shares
the pre-intervention with the setup in Fig. 4(a) and the postintervention period with Fig. 4(b). Its purpose is to determine long-term effects, i.e., whether there were any changes
between the periods before the mobility changepoint and after the normality changepoint. From Fig. 4(c) (column 1),
we observe that most languages saw no long-term effects,
whereas two (Norwegian and Danish) saw a significant negative long-term effect, and only Italian saw a significant positive long-term effect.
Lastly, in the fourth and last setup, we fit a slightly different
model:
y ∼ year ∗ period + language,
(2)
where the dependent variable y is again the logarithm of the
number of pageviews, language now merely serves as a
language-specific baseline, and year : period is the only
interaction term which, captures the estimated effect in a
language-independent way. We fit this model not only for
the case where period is defined by the mobility changepoint, but also where it is defined by the five other pandemicrelated events. This way, we may compare effect sizes for the
various events when considered as “treatments”.
The estimated logarithmic effects are plotted for each event
in Fig. 4(d) (column 1). We find that events that are more
tightly related to decreased mobility are associated with the
largest increases in pageviews. For example, the pre-vs.-post
first-death effect is only around 0.09 (e0.10 ≈ 110%); for
school closure, it is around 0.16 (e0.16 ≈ 117%); and for the
actual lockdown, it is largest, at 0.27 (e0.27 ≈ 131%). Moreover, as expected from the previous results, we also find that
the effect around the normality changepoint is significantly
negative, at −0.11 (e−0.11 ≈ 89%).
This corroborates the previous results on mobility and Wikipedia access from yet another angle. Earlier, in Fig. 3 and
Fig. 4(a), we showed that languages spoken in countries with
a stricter lockdown saw a larger pageview increase, whereas

here we showed that not only does this hold when considering all languages together, but also that events associated
with a mobility decrease are significantly more associated
with an increase in pageviews than other pandemic-related
events.

4.2

Shifts in Information Seeking Patterns

So far, we observed an overall increase in pageviews following mobility restrictions. Then, once mobility went back to
normal, so did pageviews. Next, we explore whether these
shifts affected pageviews evenly across articles or whether
users’ attention shifted from certain topics to others.
To gain a better understanding, we analyze the temporal
trends for the distance-from-normality metric (defined in
Sec. 3.3) and perform a difference-in-differences analysis in
the same setup as in Sec. 4.1.
Distance from normality. Distances from normality are
plotted as time series in Fig. 3 (column 4). We also plot a
baseline time series computed on data from exactly one year
earlier (dotted line), where normality is defined as the average attention vector of 2018, and distance from normality was computed for mid-January to the end of September
2019. We observe that the (dotted) 2019 baseline curves stay
flat around the mobility changepoints. If additional pageviews gained after the changepoints mirrored the average attention distribution, one would expect equally flat curves for
2020. Quite on the contrary, however, the curves for 2020
increase sharply at the mobility changepoints, a clear indication of large topical shifts in overall attention. Interestingly, we find that these changes occur even for languages
for which there was no substantial pageview increase, such
as Danish, Swedish, and Norwegian. This suggests that, although these languages were not reading more, their information seeking patterns still differed overall.
As mobility returned to normality, we find that Wikipedia
readers’ attention also shifted back towards normality. That
is, the distance from normality became smaller after the effect of mobility restrictions waned. Yet, it is important to notice that the level at which the distance from normality settled thereafter was generally larger than in the previous year
(e.g., 0.3 vs. 0.03 for Italian). Also, for some language editions (Dutch and Scandinavian languages), we see a second
sudden increase in the metric around mid-July, for which we
found no obvious explanation.
Difference-in-differences regression. To quantify the attention shifts more objectively, we perform a differencein-differences regression analogous to the one of Sec. 4.1
(Eq. 1), but this time with the outcome y being the logarithm
of the distance from normality, rather than of the pageview
volume. We again employ the setups previously described
and show the interaction terms on the right-hand side of
Fig. 4. Overall, in the two first setups (Fig. 4(a-b), column 2),
we see results similar to those obtained in the pageview analysis. For all languages, there was a sharp increase in the distance from normality when comparing the periods before vs.
after the mobility changepoint. Comparing the period after

Figure 5: Shifts in topic-specific pageview volumes — Effect of mobility decrease (and eventual return to normalcy) on relative
pageview share of 57 topics, estimated via difference-in-differences regression, pooled across 12 languages. Again we use three
different setups in order to capture how things changed through different moments of the pandemic (see Sec. 3.2 for details).
Topics are grouped according to their behaved given changes in human mobility, as shown in the brackets in the right-handside.
Error bars represent 95% CIs. (R2 > 0.85 for all models.)
the mobility changepoint with the period after the normality
changepoint, we observe a significant decrease. Results are
also similar to what we observed for pageviews in the fourth
scenario, (Fig. 4(d)), where we compare “before vs. after”
for several pandemic-related events. Here again, we see a
gradation, where the regressions for events more closely associated with mobility decrease (e.g., lockdowns) are associated with stronger effects.

This suggests that a portion of the effect was transient and
clearly associated with the mobility decrease, but that there
was also another part that lingered months after mobility decreases waned. A plausible explanation for this phenomenon
could be that the societal impact of the pandemic and its associated non-pharmaceutical interventions have altered the
interests, needs, and concerns of people for good.

4.3
Interestingly, the picture in the third scenario (Fig. 4(c)) differs from the pageview analysis: here the distance from normality remains higher than baseline for eight of the 12 languages. This scenario compares the period before the mobility changepoint with the period after the normality changepoint. This indicates that attention shifted massively during
the mobility restrictions but settled in a new state after mobility went back to normal.

Shifts in Topic-specific Pageview Volume

So far, we observed a massive increase in pageview volume
following the sudden mobility change induced by COVID19-related interventions, which was not explained by a simple proportional increase according to the prior attention distribution (Sec. 4.1). Rather, the increase in pageview volume
was accompanied by major shifts in attention (Sec. 4.2).
Moreover, we have also found that, although the shifts in
pageview volume were reverted once mobility restrictions
waned, this was not the same for the shifts in attention: in-

formation seeking patterns seem to have been impacted in
the long run. Next, we investigate the shift further, with the
goal of identifying which topics gained, and which lost, attention, and also which of these changes remained after the
mobility reverted to normality.
Again, we account for trends and seasonality by formulating difference-in-differences regression models analogous to
that of Eq. 1, but we now use a model without a language
term and with an added topic term (for notation, cf. Eq. 1):
y ∼ year ∗ period ∗ topic.

(3)

We code the 57 topics as 56 dummy variables, with one
arbitrary topic serving as a baseline topic. This amounts
to 95,760 data points, one for each combination of year,
calendar day (35 days before as well as after), topic, and
language. The outcome variable y of interest is the logarithm of the fraction of pageviews going to articles of the
respective topic on the respective day. We again fit models for different setups (here we consider only the first
three scenarios discussed in Sec. 3.2). Summing the coefficient of year : period : topic with the coefficient of
year : period (corresponding to the baseline topic) reveals
changes in topical interest around the changepoints of interest. Given the three distinct difference-in-differences estimations, we are able to categorize different topics according
to how they behaved given changes in human mobility: Did
they change? Did these changes endure once mobility went
back to normal? The 57 topics are annotated with these different “behavioral groups” on the right-hand side of Fig. 5.
In the first two sectors of the figure (the first two colored
blocks), we have topics for which a persistent increase or decrease was observed. These topics experienced an increase
following the mobility changepoint, as shown in column (a),
which was sustained once the pandemic ended, as shown in
column (c). Among the topics for which there was a persistent increase in pageview volumes, we see entertainment-related subjects such as VIDEO GAMES, BOOKS, and INTER NET CULTURE. Meanwhile, topics that experienced a persistent decrease include a geographical location (e.g., WEST
ASIA ) as well as SPORTS , a topic clearly related to outdoor
activities. These findings suggest that people shifted information seeking needs from outdoor (e.g., SPORTS) to indoor
activities (e.g., VIDEO GAMES).
In the third and fourth sections of the figure, we have topics
for which the increase or decrease in pageview volume was
transient. A noteworthy topic here is BIOLOGY, which may
have received a boost given the sudden importance of all
things virus-related, but that eventually, as people got used to
the pandemic, returned to the normal levels of volume compared to the previous year. After the mobility changepoint,
as shown in column (a), pages related to biology had an increase to around 109%, followed by a decrease to around
89% after things went back to normal, as shown in column (b). Overall, comparing the five-week period before
the mobility changepoint with the five-week period after the
normality changepoint, the effect is not significant.

Lastly, the last five sections of the figure contain either topics that observed a “reversed” increase or decrease,9 shown
in the sixth and seventh sections, or that experienced no
change following the mobility changepoint at all, in the
eighth, nineth and tenth sections. For the latter kind, some
topics also saw an eventual increase or decrease in the difference-in-differences scenarios depicted in columns (b) or
(c). Of these last sections, a remarkable topic is MEDICINE
& HEALTH, which presents a substantial decrease overall,
as shown in column (c), but which did not experience an
increase following the mobility changepoint, as shown in
column (a). We further investigated the time series for this
topic and found that this happened because the shift in interest for the topic happened before the mobility changepoint for many countries. This is aligned with previous suggestions that the “panic” of the disease preceded its actual
spread (Depoux et al. 2020).
All in all, our results suggest that, while COVID-19-related
topics saw transient increases (e.g., BIOLOGY) or no increase at all (e.g., MEDICINE & HEALTH) following mobility restrictions, several topics related to entertainment saw
long-lasting increases. Similarly, SPORTS, a topic related
to the outdoors, saw persistent decreases. Importantly, although mobility returned to normal in many places, the pandemic is far from ending. It will be interesting to see whether
these shifts are medium-term changes that will revert once
the pandemic is over or long-term changes that will remain
for years to come.

Discussion and conclusions

In summary, our findings suggest that the sharp decrease in
human mobility induced by COVID-19-related non-pharmaceutical interventions has boosted the volume of information
seeking on Wikipedia and has changed the nature of the information sought, even considering non-COVID-19-related
articles (RQ1). Once mobility returned to its normal levels,
the volume of information seeking also returned to its prior
levels, but the kinds of content sought did not (RQ2). Lastly,
touching upon both research questions, we zoom in on what
articles received more or less attention during this period,
finding that some topics, e.g., BIOLOGY, saw transient increases or decreases in volume, while others saw persistent
increases (e.g., VIDEO GAMES) or decreases (e.g., SPORT).
These findings may be help in characterizing the societal
impact of the pandemic. First, the trends in the volume of
pageviews may themselves be interpreted as a trace of the
social impact of the pandemic. The increase in information
seeking that closely followed changes in mobility patterns
suggests that, once we are deprived of activities halted by
non-pharmaceutical interventions, we resort even more to
information seeking on the Web, an activity related to entertainment and self-actualization.
9 That is, they changed in one direction with the decrease in mo-

bility, but then experienced a “bounce back” after mobility went
back to normal.

Second, our analysis of the nature of what the information
sought suggests that the societal impact of the crisis has persisted beyond the associated mobility restrictions. This acts
as evidence that long-term changes induced by the pandemic
are not only geopolitical or economic in nature, but also related to human needs, interests, and concerns.
Third, our results suggest that most of the topics that experienced persistent increases (e.g., VIDEO GAMES and IN TERNET CULTURE ) are not related to needs often framed
as “basic”, such as safety and physiological needs (Maslow
1943). Although this does not imply that the latter were not
increased,10 it nevertheless reinforces that there was an increase in people’s need for entertainment and arguably selfactualization.
An alternate angle in which we can frame the aforementioned discussion is to consider not how Wikipedia logs shed
light on the societal impact of the pandemic, but how this
specific event sheds light on Wikipedia’s role in times of
crisis. While previous work has highlighted how Wikipedia
is able to provide crucial information to millions of people
during epidemics (McIver and Brownstein 2014), we show
that things do not stop there: Wikipedia can also play the role
of providing information related to non-essential needs, and
browsing Wikipedia becomes more widespread once other
activities are hindered by an unexpected crisis.
Limitations. In this paper, we performed a careful analysis of access patterns on Wikipedia. As our findings are observational, we cannot conclusively establish causal effects
of pandemic-related events on user behavior. Indeed, lockdown measures and the ensuing decrease in mobility coincided with numerous other life changes inflicted by the pandemic, and any of these concomitant changes—rather than
the increase in time spent at home—might in principle be the
true cause of the changes in Wikipedia access patterns. For
instance, one might argue that an increased concern about
health issues might drive people to access more encyclopedic information. Nevertheless, our work presents circumstantial indications that there is indeed a causal link between
mobility and the volume and nature of information seeking,
as we find that Wikipedia -derived signals follow mobility
patterns closely (Fig. 4a-b analyzed jointly) and that there
exists a dose–response relationship between mobility interventions and Wikipedia -derived signals (Fig. 4d).
Another limitation of this work has to do with the biases of
Wikipedia readership. Given the popularity of the world’s
largest online encyclopedia, it is tempting to try to generalize our findings to large populations. Yet, we must recall
that this may not be true due to uneven access to the Internet
and varying levels of digital literacy. It could be the case,
for example, that the groups with the largest increase in basic needs lack the capability to access Wikipedia, and that
we therefore lose the signals associated with this important
population.
10 And

indeed previous work has found evidence of increases on
queries related to such basic needs (Suh et al. 2020).

Future work. A further interesting causal question asks in
what activities people engage when forced to spend time
at home. Answering this would require drawing conclusions from the particular lockdown that we are observing in
the context of COVID-19 to general situations of restricted
mobility. One idea would be to treat COVID-19 as an instrumental variable (Angrist and Imbens 1995), i.e., a haphazard event that systematically nudges people to stay at
home, while affecting people’s interests only via the lockdown measures. For instance, it would be interesting to explore whether COVID-19 can be used as an instrumental
variable to estimate what books people read, or what dishes
they cook, when they are forced to, or—let the glass be halffull!—when they are given the chance to, spend more time
at home.

Obtaining mobility changepoints

Mobility data. To estimate the effective lockdown dates,
we use the mobility reports made available by Google and
Apple. Google released community-level reports (Aktay et
al. 2020) indicating the daily percentage change in visits
to predefined categories of places: Retail and Recreation
aggregates places like restaurants, cafés, shopping centers,
Grocery and Pharmacy, Parks, Transit Stations for public transport hubs, Workplaces, and Residential which estimates stay-at-home changes. The changes, for a given place
on a given day, are reported in comparison to a baseline
value, i.e., the median volume for the same day of the week
computed across a five-week period between 3 January and
6 February 2020. Similarly, Apple reports relative changes
compared to a baseline volume measured on 13 January2020
along 3 dimensions of mobility: Driving, Walking, and Transit. Combined, these represent nine types of time series capturing mobility behavior.

Handling the language-vs.-country mismatch. Some languages (e.g., English, French, German) cannot easily be
matched to one particular geographical area. For them,
we collect the largest countries in terms of native speakers for which mobility data was available. We then produce an aggregate of the mobility data across countries
weighted by the percentage of native speakers of the language in each country. For English, we aggregated: United
States (68.9%), United Kingdom (16.1%), Canada (5.8%),
Australia (5.4%), South Africa (1.5%), Ireland (1.2%),
and New Zealand (1.1%). For French, we aggregated:
France (62.9%), Canada (10.1%), Cameroon (9.2%), Belgium (7.9%), Senegal (4.3%), Benin (3.8%), and Switzerland (1.8%). For German, we aggregated: Germany (87%),
Austria (8.7%), and Switzerland (6.3%).

identify the effective time of lockdown based on changes in
mobility time series. These techniques usually rely on two
components: (1) a cost function assessing the quality of a
particular signal segmentation and (2) a technique to search
the space of possible segmentations, guided by the cost function (Aminikhanghahi and Cook 2017). For more details, we
refer to the review of (Truong, Oudre, and Vayatis 2020). In
this work, we considered the cost functions and search algorithms available as part of the ruptures package.11
Several different design choices can be made: (1) different
subsets of mobility time series can be selected and (2) different changepoint algorithms can be employed. We ran the
pipeline with many different parameters and report the results in Table 2. The standard deviations are due to changing
parameters and are small, often below one day. Indeed, for
most countries, the changes in mobility are very clear, and
different methods largely agree.
