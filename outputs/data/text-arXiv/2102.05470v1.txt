Abstract
The ongoing COVID-19 vaccination campaign has so far targeted a less than 2% of the world
population, and even in countries where the campaign has started many citizens will not receive
their doses for many months. There is clear evidence that previous shortages of COVID-19 related
goods (e.g., masks and COVID-19 tests) and services pushed customers, and vendors, towards illicit
online trade occurring on dark web marketplaces.1, 2 Is this happening also with vaccines? Here,
we report on our effort to continuously monitor 102 dark web marketplaces. By February 6, we
found 22 listings offering a COVID-19 vaccine. Three listings offer the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, one
listing the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine, and three listings a fabricated proof of vaccination against
COVID-19. Several listings appeared before the summer of 2020, and can be deemed as scams.
Illicit trade of uncertified COVID-19 vaccines poses a concrete threat to public health and risks to
undermine public confidence towards vaccination.

Introduction
COVID-19 officially became a threat to the global public health on March 11, 2020, when it was declared
a pandemic by the World Health Organization.3 Restrictions, such as social distancing, quarantine, and
travel bans, have only partially contained the COVID-19 pandemic,4 which has now infected more than
100 million people and caused over 2 million deaths worldwide.3 Several pharmaceutical companies and
universities have been researching a COVID-19 vaccine at unprecedented speed. More than 200 possible
1

COVID-19 vaccines have been proposed,5 with only a few currently approved and several others in late
testing phases. Russia was the first country in the world to approve a vaccine against the virus that
causes COVID-19 on August 11, 2020.6 Its Sputnik V vaccine started to be available in other countries
much later, for instance Argentina began the vaccination campaign with this vaccine on December 29,
2020.7 Pfizer/BioNTech was the first international pharmaceutical company to have its vaccine approved
in several countries: in the UK on December 2, 2020,8 in the USA on December 12, 2020,9 and in the
European Union on December 21, 2020.10
At the moment of writing, the availability of COVID-19 vaccines remains limited and a less than
2% of the worldwide population has received the vaccine.11 Shortages of COVID-19 related products in
the regular economy, like masks, have encouraged customers to purchase products through illicit online
channels.12, 13 A similar transition to the shadow economy is likely to happen with shortages of COVID19 vaccines, according to reports by Interpol14 and Europol.15 Citizens currently waiting to get their
doses may be willing to illicitly purchase them online.16 Also, according to a global survey,17 only 70%
of the population is willing to take the COVID-19 vaccine; the remaining portion may decide to buy a
fabricated proof of vaccination to avoid taking the vaccine shot, as already happened with falsified test
results,18 with airlines encouraging governments to allow proofs of vaccination to become a way to safely
travel.19, 20
Dark web marketplaces (DWMs) can be accessed via specialized browsers, like Tor21 and offer a
variety of illicit goods including drugs, firearms, credit cards, and fake IDs.22 DWMs immediately drew
the attention of thousands of buyers and sellers, with a trading volume that rapidly reached hundreds
millions United States dollars (USD) per year.23, 24 The growing popularity of DWMs has attracted the
interest of the scientific community, security researchers, and law enforcement agencies. The scientific
community has explored the behaviour of DWMs users through comparative analyses25–30 and case
studies.31–33 Law enforcement agencies have successfully closed many DWMs, seizing millions of United
States dollars, and performing dozen of arrests.34–40 However, DWMs have shown resilience to these
interventions,24 and 2020 has been a record year for DWMs revenue.41, 42 Previous studies have shown
that DWMs sell several COVID-19 related products, including masks, COVID-19 tests, and COVID-19
related medicines (e.g., hydroxyclorochine).1, 2 In a first report,1 222 COVID-19 related unique listings
were registered in April 3, 2020 in 20 DWMs, while, in another previous work,2 788 COVID-19 related
unique listings were observed 9, 464 times between January 1, 2020 and November 16, 2020 in 30 DWMs.
Given that DWMs offered several COVID-19 related products, they are suitable websites where COVID19 vaccines can be found and illicitly purchased. The availability of COVID-19 vaccines on DWMs
remains an open research question.
Here, we report on the monitoring of 102 DWMs between January 1, 2020 and January 15, 2021. We
also manually surveyed DWMs – offering officially approved vaccines (e.g., Pfizer/BioNTech) or proofs of
vaccinations against COVID-19 – on several days until February 6, 2021. We detected 22 unique listings
offering COVID-19 vaccines, which were observed 328 times. Listings related to approved vaccines were
detected on the Invictus marketplace starting from November 17, 2020, almost 2 weeks before their
official approval. Also, three listings offering a fabricated proof of vaccination were registered on the
Hydra marketplace since January 15, 2021. As the deployment of the COVID-19 vaccine continues with
slow pace, new vaccine listings may appear on DWMs, calling for a constant monitoring of DWMs.
To reach a large audience beyond academia, we released a website,43 where we are providing constant
updates on the effect of the pandemic on DWMs.

Our results confirm the concerns that several international agencies have expressed for the past
months. Interpol released a global warning about the illicit selling of COVID-19 vaccines on December
2, 202014 affirming that “ensuring the safety of the supply chain and identifying illicit websites selling
fake products will be essential”. Other local agencies in Canada,44 Nigeria,45 UK,46 and Europe15 have
also highlighted the danger of illicit fake COVID-19 vaccine listings. They stated that these listings pose
a real public health risk and will become more and more important with the increase of the number of
approved vaccines and their worldwide coverage. Moreover, recent delays in production and delivery of
approved vaccines47, 48 could also push more people towards illicit websites like DWMs, a real danger in
countries where vaccines are still not delivered.49

Data and methods
Our dataset was gathered by Flashpoint,50 a company specializing in online risk intelligence. It included
the most popular DWMs in 2020 and 2021, such as White House, Empire, Hydra, and DarkMarket.1, 51
Note that the landscape of active DWMs is constantly changing: Empire exit scammed on August 23,
2020,52 while DarkMarket was shut down by Europol on January 12, 2021.53 The dataset was obtained
by web crawling DWMs, which consists of extracting and downloading data from these websites. To this
end, the web crawling pipeline has to overcome strong CAPTCHAs54 and authenticate into the DWMs
of interest. Downloading content from DWMs remains a challenging task, and the objective becomes
even harder when the research study requires monitoring multiple DWMs for an extended period of
time. Previous research groups have tried establishing a web crawling pipeline through a combination of
PHP, curl, and MySQL,55 through the Python library Scrapy,56 and through an automated methodology
using the AppleScript language.57 Despite these efforts, only a few open-source tools are available54, 58 for
crawling DWMs. More often than not, researchers, companies, and federal agencies rely on commercial
software, like X-Byte,59 and specialized companies, like Flashpoint,50 to crawl DWMs.
Overall, our dataset includes a total of 102 DWMs active between January 1, 2020 and January
15, 2021. Each unique listing is observed at most once per day. Our method for pre-selecting the
COVID-19 vaccine related listings is as follows. From the listings, we considered two different text
fields: the title and the body (that is, the listing’s detailed description). We then pre-selected all listings
which contained, either in the body or title, at least one word from two different lists of keyword (case
insensitive). These lists of keywords are shown in Table 1: the first list contains keywords related to
vaccines; the second list contains keywords related to COVID-19 or vaccine brands like Pfizer/BioNTech.
Note that using keywords like “antibod” or “vaccin” allows to match all words including these sets of
strings, that is, antibode, antibodes, vaccine, vaccines, vaccinations, and so on. We considered several
different languages, such as, English, Russian, Chinese, and German. Afterwards, we manually inspected
the listings to exclude false positives from the dataset, and we standardised the analysed attributes for
the analysis. For example, we converted all prices to USD at the daily exchange rate at the time of
observation.
While each listing had an associated url to determine its uniqueness, which allowed us to track listing
over time, vendors receiving bad reviews sometimes put identical copies of the same listing online. To
overcome this issue and correctly count the number of listings, we manually inspected the listings and
created a new identifier of unique listings. We considered two listings as unique if the same vendor was
posting almost identical listings in the same market, with small variations in the title or description. We

also excluded listings with prices larger than 40, 000 USD. Vendors post listings at high price to hold
sales of these relative items, with the expectation of selling it again in the future.60

Results: Vaccine listings
DWMs have been offering several COVID-19 vaccines, with two relevant examples shown in Fig. 1. In
Fig. 1(a), a AstraZeneca/Oxford COVID-19 vaccine was offered at 909.8 USD on the Invictus marketplace. In Fig. 1(b), a fabricated proof of COVID-19 vaccination was offered at 55 USD on the Hydra
marketplace.
Overall, we registered 22 unique listings offering COVID-19 vaccine and divided them in three categories: approved vaccines, other vaccines, and proofs of vaccination. Listings in the approved vaccines
category explicitly mentioned official vaccines, an example is given in Fig. 1(a) and another one in Fig 4.
Listings in the other vaccines category referred to vaccines, either by selling alleged unapproved vaccines
well before research was completed, as shown in Table 3, or by referring to preventive cures for the
immune system, as visible in Table 4. Listings in the proofs of vaccination category offered a fabricated
certificate of COVID-19 vaccination, as shown in Fig. 1(b) and Fig. 5 with their English translations in
Table 5 and 6, respectively.
The other vaccines category contained the largest amount of detected COVID-19 related listings.
The price of these listings ranged from 2 to 15,000 USD. For example a $2 Xanax listing which had a
description saying “get the cure vaccine for coronavirus. contact asap if you need to secure your dose”.
We speculate that the $2 price was for the Xanax only, while the actual vaccine might have been offered
at a higher price, as the vendor encouraged to contact him through wickr contact. These listings were
offered by 9 vendors, seven of which offered only one listing, while two of them offered two and six
listings, respectively. Nine of these listings were offered on DarkBay, while one listing was offered on
ASAP, Asean, Kilos, Empire, Televend, and White House.
Listings in the approved vaccines category, which explicitly mentioned currently approved vaccines,
appeared much later on November 17, 2020. The first listing in this category offered the Pfizer/BioNTech
vaccine at 1,000 USD. Two other listings were offering the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine but at half of the
price. The last listing in this category offered an AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine at 909.8 USD. These listings
were offered by four different vendors, who posted them on the Invictus marketplace. The vendors of the
Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines do not provide any shipping information, with one of these vendors suggesting
the potential customers to establish a direct contact via email, phone, or wickr. The vendor of the

AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine listing ships worldwide. We manually checked that one Pfizer/BioNTech
and the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine listing were active as of February 6, 2021.
Finally, the three listings in proofs of vaccination category appeared in January 15, 2021, in the early
stage of the vaccination campaign. The fabricated certificates were offered at similar prices, between 46
to 66 USD on the Hydra marketplace, which notoriously operates mostly in Russia and neighbouring
Eastern countries.61 We manually checked that these listings were active as of February 6, 2021. A
summary of the above findings can be found in Table 2 and Fig. 2. More information about the DWMs
where COVID-19 vaccines were detected are available in Table 7.

Temporal evolution of vaccine listings
The evolution of COVID-19 vaccines on DWMs closely followed major COVID-19 related events, as
shown in Fig. 3. The first COVID-19 vaccine listing appeared on January 29, 2020, just after the release
of the complete genome sequence of COVID-19 on January 12, 202062, 63 and the Wuhan lockdown on
January 23, 2020.64 Multiple vaccine listings were simultaneously present on DWMs when the first

vaccination trials were undergoing, between March 16, 2020 and April 14, 2020.65 Toward the end of the
first wave of contagions in Europe on June 9, 2020,66 no more vaccine listings were present on DWMs
from July 1, 2020. These listings reappeared on September 16, 2020, at the beginning of the second wave
of infections that started in September 2020.67 Up to this moment, we detected only COVID-19 listings
in the other vaccines category. The first listing in the approved vaccines category was a Pfizer/BioNTech
vaccine and was offered since November 17, 2020, two weeks before its first official approval (by the
UK) on December 2, 2020.8 A similar pattern was registered for the first AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine
listing on DWMs. It was offered on December 27, 2020, three days before the first official approval of
this vaccine (by the UK) on December 30, 2020.68 On January 15, 2021, in the middle of the early
vaccination phase, we registered the first proofs of vaccination on DWMs.

Discussions and conclusion
We have been monitoring the presence of COVID-19 vaccine listings in 102 DWMs since the onset of
the COVID-19 pandemic. We have identified a total of 22 unique listings related to COVID-19 vaccines.
Nine of these listings were offered on DarkBay, which has more listings categories than other DWMs.69
Four of the 22 detected listings offered currently approved vaccines. They were all offered on the Invictus
marketplace, which started to operate in September 2020. Its administrators claim to start a new era
for DWMs by offering an intuitive control panel, experienced staff, and innovative features.70 We also

detected three fabricated proofs of vaccination on the Hydra marketplace, the largest DWM in Russia
that allows shipping only within that country and neighbouring Eastern countries.61
A key contribution of the present work is the constant monitoring of DWMs to detect the presence
of COVID-19 vaccines. This work is similar to a previous study2 which observed that the evolution of
listings related to COVID-19 vaccines is correlated with major COVID-19 related events. This study
detected a number of COVID-19 vaccines during the first and second wave of contagions, however there
were no listings between the contagion waves. We also observed four listings explicitly mentioning the
Pfizer/BioNTech and AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccines. These listings appeared around the time of the
official approval of these vaccines, reflecting the claims of other mass media news.71–73
A limitation of the present work is that, while the number of DWMs simultaneously monitored over
time is greater than most previous studies, we cannot ensure that all DWMs were surveyed. In fact,
the number of active DWMs is constantly changing due to closures or new openings24 and obtaining
full coverage is challenging due to the active efforts of DMWs to obstruct research studies and law
enforcement investigations.
The unregulated diffusion of illicit vaccines on DWMs constitutes a major threat to public health, and
could undermine the ongoing COVID-19 mass vaccination campaign.74 By highlighting how COVID-19
vaccines appear on DWMs, our analysis may help raise awareness of the phenomenon and support the
effort of law enforcement agencies to contain it by repeating past successful approaches .34–40

Coronavirus / Covid / Corona vaccination certificates
Hello Friend! The coronavirus has made adjustments to everyone’s life. And more than once
many of us will face its consequences. One of them is the provision of a COVID-19 vaccination
certificate, which can be presented at work, at the place of study and in any other place where
it is required. To order, you need to indicate your full name, date of birth, date of the issued
document. If you need a non-Moscow institution, you will need to pay extra for the production
of the necessary seals. Production time is 2-7 days. Delivery when sent by courier will have to
be paid for upon receipt. It is possible to send by registered or regular mail, then we will take
on this heavy burden. An ordinary letter has no track, therefore, until we receive the letter, we
will remain in the dark about its fate.
